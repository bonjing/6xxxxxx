Anchored by young love-struck characters named Jude (Jim Sturgess) and Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), the film features the cast, which also includes Joe Cocker and U2\\\'s Bono, performing Fab Four tunes with great gusto. Among the many highlights of the soundtrack are Sturgess\\\'s emotive rendition of the title track, Cocker\\\'s stomping version of \\\"Come Together,\\\" and an energetic take on \\\"I Am the Walrus\\\" by Bono and the Secret Machines. Like Cirque du Soleil\\\'s LOVE show, UNIVERSE presents Beatles classics cast in a dramatic light, giving the album a wide appeal with its boisterous, Broadway veneer.
