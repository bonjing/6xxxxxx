I'm looking forward to this.  It reminded me of the other excellent soundtrack for, ""I Am Sam""

Ben Harper's, ""Strawberry Fields"" is beyond excellent...."
[T],insinuendo,2011-04-17T13:49Z,"Like the movie, this soundtrack has some great moments. A fine collection of Beatles' renditions.

This version of ""Let it be"", accompanied with the take from the film is absolutely brilliant.

See it on youtube.

Without forgetting ""Strawberry Fields"", and ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" which are even better when seen in context of the film.
