,SpicyMayoChicken,2011-04-14T21:11Z,Is THIS ENGLIS VERSION?!?!?! because THE LAST ONE WAS SPANISH! xPP
,Peevesomania,2011-04-14T21:20Z,"I hope this is a good one. ;)
Let us seeeee. =D 
Last time I downloaded HP, it was a Spanish version, too. It was a great quality of the video, but IT WAS SPANISH!! -.-"
,armedman7,2011-04-16T10:20Z,"""Resolution: 1920 x 800"" isn't it suppose to be 1080?"
,mike18xx2,2011-04-16T12:20Z,"1) Armed man 7; it's 2.35 aspect-ratio wide-screen film; you only get 1080 vertical at 1920 horizontal if the AR is 17/9 or 1.777.

2) Video quality 7; obvious blocking and banding artifacts in dark areas."
,USAmiCZka,2011-04-16T14:45Z,"I can't make it to play from begining it looks like the movie is there somewhere but i starts several minutes later for me, how to fix it?"
,shesher,2011-04-16T22:09Z,"OK, this is annoying the hell out of me. I cannot seem to get my downloads to work anymore. I use Transmission and I have changed my settings several times but I still keep getting told that I have 0 of 3 seeders seeding to me (and at the moment its showing that there are 536 seeders). Does anyone know why this keeps happening? I can still seed out just fine, but I can't leach for crap."
,patike98,2011-04-16T22:31Z,SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!!!
,Peevesomania,2011-04-16T23:57Z,"Perfect!!! 
10/10"
,thatgeeza,2011-04-17T16:59Z,"Perfect?  It's nowhere near perfect!

Picture is ok (7) not 1080 quality
Audio is crap (2) really low bit rate

Why do people bother to upload crap like this"
[V],ExtraTorrentRG,2011-04-17T18:34Z,"USAmiCZka : try playing it using VLC or Media Player classic,which uses less cpu usage.

shesher : i dunno man, it is being seeded alright, do you have Windows?

thatgeeza : Well you can't obviously compare this with blu ray disc, the size is much smaller :D i agree the audio bit rate is low,but that keeps the file smaller. the movie itself is dark(the production made sure it is scary lol)

,finisher489,2011-06-27T13:53Z,"OMG.... thx thx thx thx thx man, ExtraTorrentRG, Don't stop uploading you're amazing movies. after I dl this, I will definitely look for HP 1,2,3,4,5,6 on blu-ray 1080p aswell. Dude, you are a lifesaver. I'd say this is the best HP Deathly Hallows P1 out there. Do you know, how I can prove it (Because of the .mp4 file). I'mma gonna download this before P2 comes out in 3D Cinemas. You know what, I think ExtraTorrentRG can upload 3D movies aswell"
,finisher489,2011-06-27T14:47Z,Amazing man!!!! This is definitely the best HP Deathly Hallows torrent out there!!!! Well obviously it's not 1080p but its the best resolution there is available to hack on PC - 1920x800. I've gotta watch this before Part 2 comes out on 3D Cinemas. THX ALOT ExtraTorrentRG.
,finisher489,2011-07-02T09:50Z,Works amazin man
,baronkorea,2011-07-13T08:08Z,Thnx 4 the upload!
,Gh057man,2011-11-26T07:07Z,All the haters ... please stop dissing Anoretic. He is obviously an extreme noob and needs to be left in peace to spank himself in the corner.
,Gh057man,2011-11-26T07:13Z,oops ... wrong torrent *sheepish grin*
