[T],Djofullinn,2011-04-21T22:37Z,"xswcdevfr, bullcrap. 

The book is extremely well documented and this scaam was admittted long ago."
,xswcdevfr,2011-04-22T17:05Z,"Nope, upon investigation the ""documentation"" he uses for this and other books has been shown to be distorted quotes taken out of context, and in some cases the sources he claims denies ever having talked to him att all."
,xswcdevfr,2011-04-22T17:12Z,"As an example, what Caspar Weinberger was talking about was just the normal, routine exercises that many nations navies regularly engage in when their ships visit each others waters. And he gave no details, he repetedly stated that he was just talking in general terms.

This interview Tunander distorted and interpretad as an admission that all submarines that have ever been hunted in Swedish waters are from the west, something that has absolutely no basis in what Weinberger said.

That's just one example, and it's far from the worst one."
