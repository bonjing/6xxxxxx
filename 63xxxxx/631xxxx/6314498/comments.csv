,lontrus,2011-04-14T14:48Z,"rob66699 i dont like rars cause most of the time i need to download some or the rars twise or even more times cause i get the error corrupted files
and this is torrent so whats the point of the rars in torrent if it's on a system where you download peace by peace anyway .. and the rars are waist of hdd space when unpacked they are deleted so that means no seeding"

,smokeskreen420,2011-05-25T01:21Z,the .sfv file is a virus dumb fucks
,antonaros,2011-05-29T17:15Z,DOES IT HAVE A VIRUS???
,antonaros,2011-05-29T19:11Z,YOU CAN DELETE THE .sfv file
,Quesse,2011-06-19T18:48Z,"Thank you. Great upload of a great game. I just finished it so you can be sure it works.

@smokeskreen Maybe you should do some thinking before you start blurting out insults. I scanned the sfv file with Kaspersky and there's nothing wrong with it.

If you get some random files on your drive, that's because of the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 installation (it's not because of the torrent). Just delete the files."
,RebelwaClue,2011-07-13T22:06Z,"@smokeskreen420 
No virus in that file, it's nothing but a textfile containing the checksums. And can't contain a virus. The game is virusfree and runs smoothly"
,mh89,2011-08-15T08:00Z,"I've installed this but when I run it to play, it comes loading then a black screen, then a white and it comes an error that I have to close the program. Not working, anyone can help?
Does it need any crack?"

I upload maps to settlers  myself, so I know a little bit of appreciation is nice.  So thank you again.  Cheers"
