,indiaman,2011-04-12T14:36Z,"True, pages are missing and that is unfortunate because the pages that are there contain explanations of complex phenomenon in such a simple and lucid way.Thanks nevertheless lionzbay for your efforts and hopefully we will see this wonderful book with all its pages uploaded by you soon."
,terrentius1,2011-04-12T14:48Z,"Agreed, Indiaman."
