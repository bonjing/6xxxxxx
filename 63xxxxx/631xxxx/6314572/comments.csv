Dear Sir or Madam:

I, the undersigned, CERTIFY UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY, that I am an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner of certain intellectual property rights, said owner being named Cengage Learning (""Cengage""), and that the information contained herein is, to the best of my knowledge, truthful and accurate. 

It has come to our attention that [My ISP] is the service provider for the IP address listed below from which unauthorized copying and distribution (downloading, uploading, file serving, file ""swapping"" or other similar activities) of Cengage's intellectual property is taking place. Cengage has a good faith belief that use of the property in the manner described herein is not authorized by Cengage and therefore infringes Cengage's rights according to state, federal, or United States law.

More specifically, the unauthorized copying and distribution of Cengage's intellectual property identified below constitutes copyright infringement under Section 106 of the U.S. Copyright Act. Depending upon the type of service [My ISP] is providing to this IP address, it may have legal and/or equitable liability if it does not expeditiously remove or disable access to the material listed below, or if it fails to implement a policy that provides for termination of subscribers who are repeat infringers (see 17 U.S.C. B' 512).

Although various legal and equitable remedies may be available to Cengage as a result of such infringement, Cengage believes that the Internet community benefits when copyright matters of this type are resolved cooperatively.
