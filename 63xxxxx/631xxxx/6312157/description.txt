Awake & Aware - Volume 5
========================

A conglomeration of several political activist documentaries together on one \"movie\" DVD. This is an attempt at packing the biggest \"punch\" in one DVD title. I call the DVD\'s, \"Awake & Aware\" after a similarly titled conference in LA September 2009. Enjoy and please spread around :)

P.S. a few mentionables in the DVD:

David Wilcock - The 2012 Enigma
David Icke - 1991 interview with Fern Britton
Dr Bill Deagle - Granada Forum, (2006,part)
