Freshman Xander is trying to get his college courses worked out, but heâ€™s really struggling. Thing is that he wants to major in philosophy, and his parents, of course, want him to do some more sensible, like accounting. Ms. Hunter is his counselor, and definitely has some suggestions. How about majoring in something like computer science, with a philosophy minor? She points out that with his glasses and all heâ€™s looks bookish, a thinker, and could probably get into something heady like programming. Xanderâ€™s been hearing the nerd thing his entire life, and enough is enough! Bookish?!?! Nerdy?!? At his wits end, Xander comes around the desk and starts putting serious moves on the hot Ms. Hunter. It isnâ€™t long before this â€˜bookishâ€™ freshman is educating his counselor that you should never judge a book by its cover!
