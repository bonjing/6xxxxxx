Unfortunately my guess is all will be blocked within 1 day, as is the current trend. My last license worked for 74 days and was never blocked, but now it's becoming something I have to update daily. Is there a possible long term solution or a new crack method? Yeah yeah...buy the software!

Anyway, big thanks to eagerforcc and congrats on the pink. You've been very helpful and it is appreciated more than you see here."
[T],h4ck3r2012,2011-04-11T16:16Z,"First at all, thanks for your congrats...
And second, i am also a user of kaspersky, and i update daily, and if the key get blacklisted then just write a comment and i will upload new keys immediately.
No need to worry, i have a lot of keys, and i know to make them...:)"

Set your KIS to update manually. Do a manual update once a week or so. That ways, your keys will last much longer."

Check out the trial reset tool @ http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6300077/Kaspersky_Internet_Security_2011_Trial_Reset_By_UA_v2

It worked for me and resets KIS 2011 trial back to 30 days.

@eagerforcc:
Thank you for providing updated keys. Is there any chance of you to teach me how to write new keys on my own?"
[T],h4ck3r2012,2011-04-12T12:05Z,"Sorry but its a secret...;)
I am not going anywhere, just come, when the keys get blacklisted and download new keys...:)"
