- "Don't Punish the Poor" Economist Jeffrey Sachs Slams Obama-GOP Budget Deal

President Barack Obama and congressional leaders reached a last-minute budget deal on Friday, narrowly averting a government shutdown. The deal would cut roughly $38 billion from a federal budget expected to exceed $3.7 trillion this year. We speak to Jeffrey Sachs, director of The Earth Institute at Columbia University. "Many of of us who supported President Obama just feel that he has abandoned the field," Sachs says. "He has left it to the right-wing, which wants nothing more than taxes cut for the rich, whereas the American public is saying very clearly in every opinion survey that if you want to close the deficit go after taxes for the rich, raise them, cut military spending, cut the excess profits in the insurance industry and healthcare. Do things that would really make a difference-don't punish the poor."

Although the U.S. government believes he is an international terrorist, Posada Carriles was freed on Friday. Will the Obama administration let him walk the streets of Miami?
