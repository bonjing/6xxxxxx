Well if the amount of Air play on Europe's FM stations is anything to go by this re mixed 1990 Song re issued by German Duo 'Milk & Sugar' could be one of the surprise hits of 2011! 

The original Band info from the Wilki:

Vaya Con Dios is a Belgian musical group founded in 1986 by Dani Klein, Dirk Schoufs, and Willy Lambregt (the latter subsequently replaced by Jean-Michel Gielen). Their name is Spanish for "Go with God". It is one of the most successful Belgian groups ever.

They had some international success with the songs "Just A Friend Of Mine" (a hit in France), "What's a Woman?" (a number 1 hit in the Netherlands in 1990), "Nah Neh Nah", "Don't Cry for Louie", "Puerto Rico", "Heading for a Fall", "Johnny", "Sunny Days" and "Don't Break My Heart".

In total, Vaya Con Dios have sold more than 7 million albums and more than 3 million singles.[1

Here you have a TV rip (pretty clean) featuring the original black and white Video without Milk & Sugar, but it is there remix and going down a storm in the dance bars here in Malta I may add.

So you have all three versions now here on TPB...  This one, the one with Milk and Sugar 'transporting back in time into this video' and the Promo Only USA short version.   A refreshing bit of Fun for club dancers all over the World.

My thanks to the original seeder for the MKV format file which I have converted to the more common MPEG or DVD VOB using the excellent video converter or Transcoder now built into the Vuze Bit torrent client for you all.
