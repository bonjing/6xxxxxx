,allblackbatman,2011-04-12T05:16Z,once again no RARS apparently means RARS
,QborT,2011-04-12T05:42Z,"allblackbatman, they are referring to their website ""torrentzone"" as having no rars.  They upload rars here hoping to entice you to their registration type semi private torrent site."
,Leib,2011-04-12T06:36Z,"Thanks QborT for your explanation. So, if they have no RARs on their website but they upload RARs to TPB, Then they must also not have fakes on their website, but they do post fakes here right ??? !!!! O_o"
