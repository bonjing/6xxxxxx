,jermtpb,2011-06-23T17:14Z,"@markusminix2
you really asked this question? Why are you even downloading videos to begin with?

47GB vs 4.7GB The difference is quality. 
(although some may argue, it doesn't really depend on the size but the bitrate and the codec used)-"
,JackSchit,2011-07-12T11:27Z,"From the second half of season 5 (can't recall which episode specifically) I noticed the audio is synched from the video. I haven't watched everything yet. If you are playing this in vlc, you can correct this by using the ""Track Synchronization"" option under the Tools menu.

After a bit of trial and error, I discover that a value of -0.250s under ""Advance of audio over video"" seems to fix it.

a: 9 (only because of the above issue)
v: 9.5 (possibly due to the screen I'm using: 65"" rear projection creating a margin of error is 0.5)"
,JackSchit,2011-07-12T11:27Z,*audio NOT synced. padron the tpyo
,JackSchit,2011-07-14T14:00Z,"Please disregard my comment about the audio/video sync issue I previously mentioned. The problem is not with the video files. More specifically, it's occurring for ALL videos that I play on that system, even those not related to this torrent."
,jude2017,2011-08-04T21:11Z,"all but 2 of these files seem to stop after the first minute or so, and after that all i get is a white screen. anyone else seen this? or is it just me? "
