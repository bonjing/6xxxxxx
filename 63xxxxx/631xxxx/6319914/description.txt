XVID, 512x368, Qf=0.19 (see note below), AC3 9192 kbs), 1 hour 43 mins

Note: Although this is ripped of a DVD the video quality is very ordinary. It appears to have been ported from a VHS and is no better than VHS quality (It was made 26 years ago). Still worth a look.

This documentary was authorized by the Beach Boys (and their lawyers, more than likely), so the film steers clear of the band's already well-publicized internal problems, focusing solely on their music. The band is covered (via live concert footage and clips from TV variety shows and specials) from their early years up until the mid-'80s. Also shown are some clips from the movies they appeared in, such as Girls on the Beach, and some footage that was cut from The T.A.M.I. Show. Brian Wilson is interviewed (in his bed) from a 1976 television special, and there is also some footage from a German and a Czech concert tour.
