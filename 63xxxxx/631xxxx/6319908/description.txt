Technology :

This is HD DVB-T, and the broadcaster (arte) harcoded the french subtitles on the video. Nothing I can do about that. Mpc-hc displayed other subtitles at the same height over these, which you may like or not (you should have the option to move them as you see fit, if you don't).

Very few and short imperfections because of the reception (which was very good), they should not be a concern.

This is, as always with current french HD DVB-T, pseudo 1080p. It's interlaced in 25fps, and it actually is 1440x1080 to be displayed in 16:9 (which gets you to 1920x1080, aka 1080p).

The quality of the encode is great tough, and since The Blu-Ray is out of stock, I guess that's technically the best version you'll find for now.
