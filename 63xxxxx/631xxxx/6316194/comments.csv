Any idea when you could upload an R5 or DVD Rip for ""No Strings Attached"" ? "

Audio - 6/7 sounds like from CAM

thanks froggie great upload"
,DiscGolfNutt,2011-04-14T03:59Z,The quality and sound are really good for the first 2 minutes..... Then comes the cinavia error. You won't be able to watch it on the PS3. Bleh. Now I have to DL another version.
,StormseeD,2011-04-14T21:01Z,"DiscGolfNut .. are you a nut ? the movie which you download is ""free"".. you remember that nuthead ? 

At least thank the ULer for his efforts for the copy made available to people like you who do not deserve to download free of cost..  "
,flextm71,2011-04-18T01:52Z,"@StormseeD - DiscGolfNutt was just stating that this one can't be viewed on the PS3 because it has the cinavia protection. I appreciate his comment, because I watch all my movies on my PS3 and won't bother with this one. It has nothing to do with the uploader, his efforts are appreciated."
,StormseeD,2011-04-22T07:53Z,COOL! My apologies for the misleading interpretation.
,Eolo_DaSilva,2011-04-23T12:12Z,Thanks PBU...
