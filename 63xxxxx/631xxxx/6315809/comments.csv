""After long wait, Windows 8 build 7850 has been leaked and is available for download at private ftp on betaArchive forums.The build string of this build is 6.1.7850.0.winmain_win8m1.100922-1508 and it was compiled on 22nd September 2010. We have got several confirmations from our sources that the build is original.Windows 8 build 7850 belongs to Milestone 1 and is pretty old, so we may see very less changes in this build.

Here are the details of the build-

6.1.7850.0.winmain_win8m1.100922-1508_x86fre_client-enterprise_en-us.iso â€“ 2.45 GB (2,637,101,056 bytes)

The build is expected to hit the torrents soon and file sharing sites soon.""

Only the install.wim is changed: it's normal you see win 7, but the OS is Win 8 (see the screen before post).

Again, if you don't wont, don't take the file.

Thank'n bye and sorry for my bad english."
