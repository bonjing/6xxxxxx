,Frackz,2011-04-26T16:23Z,This worked like a charm! And it is fully activated! Thank you.
,ash.rnand,2011-04-30T09:03Z,"No activation key is provided and automatic activation does not work.

Install files seem okay though. "
,ash.rnand,2011-04-30T09:17Z,"sorry just found the crack, its in BIE directory and works beautifully!!! 
full activated, thankyou Stun!!!

*NB: I was mounting the ISO in VMWARE,  so just be aware that you need to view the actual iso contents to retrieve the crack**"
,huangxao,2011-05-02T11:09Z,"Installed, not activated; Tried both cracks in BIT directory, the first one hit 0x7008000D error; second one ""workaround"" claims successful, but after re-boot still not activated; Is there any clue?"

,clint1285,2011-06-04T17:02Z,"does anyone know why i get a ""cyclic redundancy check: error"" when i try to extract the .rar file  with 7z?"
,Darqsido,2011-06-05T20:36Z,Can someone please list step by step how to do this. I haven't had to work with an archive before. i am used to the .ISO's. Much appreciated.
,Darqsido,2011-06-05T20:45Z,Nevermind. I didn't have PowerISO installed in my somewhat fresh install of Windows 7. WHen I opened one of the many archives in the folder all I would see is one archive almost 4GB in size. I instaled POwerISO then it showed as an ISO file. thanks for the upload.
,koolrahul007,2011-06-08T19:43Z,after full installation it's prompting to enter administrator password...what i've to write in the password box...pls help me...:(
,schmidlap,2011-06-12T10:13Z,"This torrent is a piece of shit.  First, what jackass creates a torrent with over 60 rar files instead of just the iso to begin with.  Ok, that's fine, we can handle that but the piece of crap ""crack"" doesn't even work.  Neither the crack nor the ""workaround"".  Neither does the best bootloader you can get that works on every edition of 2008 and 7 I have except for this one.  This is a waste of time.  Don't bother with it."
,Hubology,2011-06-15T13:22Z,"Works, BIE KMS works as well (activation). If you're unable to get this to work, stick with workstations."

,C157723,2011-06-23T16:41Z,"OK, installed no problem. But like one other guy, I get this error 0x7008000D, which google tells me can be quite a few different things, not the least of which is windows thinks a file might not be right, which kind of makes sense I guess.

At any rate, I, like the other guy, try to run the workaround, it claims success, restart and it says it is still not activated...does this mean it is? I have used others which continue to show they are not activated but the crack makes it so the sw just doesn't care...is this the case? I am going to continue to use it to see what happens...if anyone has anything thoughts/help I'd appreciate it.

Either way TY for the upload."
,blaize9,2011-06-27T22:00Z," How to fix error 0x7008000D
1. copy bie_2k8install.exe to your server desktop
2. Right click on it
3. click on run as administrator "

,Reigefyre,2011-07-03T10:03Z,"If anyone is experiencing problems with activation, you may consider trying the Windows Loader written by Daz. A google search should point you in the right direction, and it is by FAR the best activation software available."

1) I wonde rwhy you have Server 2008 in the first place if you can't understand password complexity.

2) A password like 'john' won't let you go in, however a password like 'j0hN123' Will. "

,SinAppz,2012-01-01T03:33Z,"OK, I had a problem with activation as well.  But I'm glad I didn't give up.

Logged in as the ""Administrator"" account will not work.

BIE run off the CD won't work either.  Don't copy the entire BIE folder to your desktop either.

Just copy the bie_2k8install.exe (only this file) to your desktop (not logged on as the ""Administrator"" account), but right click and do ""Run As Adminstrator""

And it worked!  HA!  Was about a click away from giving up on this thing."

I know this because its on 3 of my servers. a HP Proliant D380 G3, Hp Prolaint D360 G3,and a IBM M50 workstation-all of which can't run 64 bit.

,skuzzbag,2012-04-08T15:56Z,"Server 2008 is 64 bit only since the R2 release. If you want to use 32 bit then you need to use R1.
"
,chuckdm,2012-04-16T18:08Z,"@majmuntrinaest Well it has been over 4 years now and I believe the largest single disk is still 2TB so WTF is the issue man?

@Butters24 & @skuzzbag As skuzz said, there are several ""release versions"" (not to be confused with service packs or actual full OS releases or whatever else...thanks MS) that are basically the base OS with fixes up to a certain date integrated.  Since Server 2008 us based on Vista, and Vista was a steaming pile of failure UNTIL SP1 (which didn't fix everything, but it's on par with XP now anyway) then there's a couple very good reasons to use a 64-bit R2 version if you can.  If not, yes, the 32-bit R1 will work, but it will be lacking a full year of hotfixes, and not all of those fixes were ever released for 32-bit systems."
