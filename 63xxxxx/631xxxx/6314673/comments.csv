,hotkillerz,2011-04-20T20:29Z,does it included the activation code?
[T],TeamPS,2011-04-21T05:39Z,Doesn't need one. This is the lite version.
,TRMxKNW,2011-04-22T13:39Z,"Downloads fast, and has an easy installation.

I found 3 .rar files though?
One in my Downloads folder, one in my C and one in my D hard drives. Not sure why?
I just deleted the spare 2 then installed, and it worked great.


Thanks!"
