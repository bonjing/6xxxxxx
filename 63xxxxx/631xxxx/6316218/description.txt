The Bourne Identity is a 2002 American spy film loosely based on Robert Ludlum's novel of the same name. It stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, a psychogenic amnesiac attempting to discover his true identity amidst a clandestine conspiracy within the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

PLOT

An Italian fishing boat crew working off the coast of Marseille, France finds an unconscious man (Matt Damon) adrift in the Mediterranean with two gunshot wounds in his back. When he wakes up, the man comes to realize he suffers from retrograde amnesia, having only one clue to his identity: the account number to a safe deposit box provided by a tiny laser projector surgically implanted in his hip. Traveling to ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland to find the corresponding bank, the man discovers he is skilled in advanced hand-to-hand combat when he instinctively defends himself from two policemen questioning him for loitering in a closed park at night. The man arrives at the bank and finds the deposit box contains a significant amount of cash in differing denominations and several passports with his photo, but with numerous aliases. He assumes the name on the first passport, "Jason Bourne," and leaves as a bank employee notifies a CIA Special Activities Division group, "Operation Treadstone", about his visit. Bourne evades the ZÃ¼rich police and flees to the embassy, where he is accosted by the officials there but once again manages to elude capture. A few blocks away, he approaches Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente), a woman he'd seen earlier in the embassy and who is now getting into her car, and offers her US$20,000 to take him to Paris to the address on his "Bourne" passport. Eventually she agrees and they leave.

Meanwhile, back at CIA headquarters, Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper), the head of Treadstone, reveals to his supervisor, Deputy Director Ward Abbott (Brian Cox), that Bourne was the covert operative responsible for a failed assassination attempt on African dictator Nykwana Wombosi (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Intending to sever all connections between the CIA and Wombosi, Conklin sends three highly-trained "assets" (assassins) to eliminate Bourne. Bourne and Marie arrive at the apartment in Paris, where he finds that one of his aliases, "John Michael Kane", was supposedly killed two weeks ago. The first asset, code-named "Castel" (Nicky Naude), ambushes them but Bourne subdues him after a brief fight. Marie checks Castel's bag and panics when she discovers a hit list package with photos of CCTV footage of her and Bourne at the embassy the day before. As Bourne tries to calm her down, Castel escapes and jumps out the window to his death before Bourne can learn anything else......
