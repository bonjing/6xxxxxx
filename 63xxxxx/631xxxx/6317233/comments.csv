,DeafMackem,2011-04-14T11:52Z,Perfect quality. One thing I wanna ask is where is the subtitle? as you mentioned on your info that subtitles is english- muxed (can turn off/on) I cannot find any sub in this movie. 
,sdw7,2011-04-14T17:03Z,awesome man thanks
,DeafMackem,2011-04-18T20:47Z,Still no reply to my query about where is the english sub??? Guess I'll have to put in a thumbs down for this movie!! Good quality but no english sub :(
,Mcspiffles,2011-06-11T14:25Z,Was surprised by the high resolution of this rip. The video and audio quality are both great. Excellent torrent.
,extrakt,2011-06-12T09:42Z,"I opened mine with DivX and it doesn't do anything for a while and then when it does start to play there is only Audio.  I am sure it is something I am doing, but can anyone help me out?"
,extrakt,2011-06-12T10:07Z,So I used VLC instead and I will never use DivX again.  Great upload!!!

,MaleManX,2011-11-07T21:25Z,"What is the point of uploading a torrent without giving us subtitles?  All english subtitles found are not synchronized to this rip, totally making this rip worthless."
,m00se1207,2011-11-29T00:54Z,"@MaleManX 

If you really think a rip is worthless because they did not include subs and you are not efficient enough to find one then you shouldn't be downloading movies. These groups/people take their time to rip a move and then post it online for you to see. You should shut up and be thankful for having the chance to watch it in the first place. Thank you Uploader!"
