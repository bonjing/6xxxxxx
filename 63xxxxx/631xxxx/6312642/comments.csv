,Kilotone,2011-04-12T11:17Z,"EZ i registered just to say thanks for your fine work(s). It's been a few years overdue so i'll say it again.

Thanks man......really thanks your time spent here makes my time more enjoyable.

It's a shame that this series was misrepresented & finally defiled before it was dropped like the corpse that was season 1. If season 2 took it's place i'm sure it'd be alive and thriving today.

4 eps to go *sniff cry*

,ysername,2011-04-20T01:45Z,"This is great! I like when they swalow the words, acting nervous, blaming and acusing each other all the time and monsters that first are invissible sudenly are visible. Then when the episode are running out of time because of all the silly talking and the slow pace, suddenly the monsters are not hungry any more and everyone can walk home like happy campers. Great! I give this episode 10 of 10 retard stars!   "
