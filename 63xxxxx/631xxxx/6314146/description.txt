Synopsis
This seventh edition of a long-established introductory text prepared by the team of Campbell (deceased; formerly of U. of California, Riverside) and Reece (who has a PhD from UC Berkeley)--along with numerous contributors and reviewers--continues in its mission to cover concepts in a way that engages students in scientific inquiry through examples and research opportunities. Web access and a CD-ROM are part of this package; students trying to use a previously-owned text may find that web access must be purchased again. Annotation Â© 2006 Book News, Inc., Portland, OR
