The entire collection is over 25GB so I have also broken in down into several smaller parts as well as one of the complete collection.
To find all pieces of the collection search on "dpsecl babes".

This is a collection of pictures I've collected from the Internet over the years.
It's intended to be the target of a screen saver slide show (I use XP's built in one).
Large images have been trimmed/reduced to a max dimension of 1900 pixels 
(i.e. full screen for my monitors).

I have attempted to improve the image quality where possible by trimming, 
sharpening, defocusing backgrounds, color correcting, improving the dynamic range, etc. 
Many images that were beyond color correction were converted to black & white 
instead (actually a slightly greenish off-gray.)

There are a few duplicates, as I've come across better/larger images over time, 
especially in some of my favorites (like Angelina Jolie), but not many --- 
except that the /ICONIC sub tree are all duplicates of other files 
(most, but not all, having the same number). These are particularly "high impact", 
large, colorful images, hence "iconic".

Where I have only a few images of a particular girl, they're put in the /OTHER subtree. 
The directory sizes are typically <500 files so it doesn't take XP forever to make/cache
thumbnails.

ENJOY!
