,captainzain,2011-05-11T13:38Z,"I am sorry to say that, the dll named armaccess.dll is a dangerous trojan. This opens the back door for the remote attacker. 
   The following is the report from Microsoft essentials.

Category: Trojan

Description: This program is dangerous and executes commands from an attacker.

Recommended action: Remove this software immediately.

Security Essentials detected programs that may compromise your privacy or damage your computer. You can still access the files that these programs use without removing them (not recommended). To access these files, select the Allow action and click Apply actions. If this option is not available, log on as administrator or ask the security administrator for help.


   Guys beware!!!

Any hw, the back ground music is nice. Thanks for it."
,saasalpern,2011-05-13T16:47Z,"NOD32 removed the installer file, urs-ursoft-silent-us.exe, and, after I allowed that file to work, NOD32 then removed armaccess.dll (which apparently registers the program).  With all due respect to ChattChitto (& friendlytec), this is the first time I've had ANY problems with his work.  I'd say avoid  this like the plague.  Something is wrong."

Are we talking about the same file used ina crack as a part of the crack of Norton Utilities v14.5.0.118 ?

I think i wont go for this one and will keep my previous version until this is sorted out .

I will let uploader know about this one but otherwise DO NOT FORGET whom we talkin' bout... 

ChattChitto one of the best TPB'z ĂÂľpl0ader .

Greetingz"
[V],ChattChitto,2011-05-26T02:13Z,"I've been using this since it has been released. Totally clean :)
But just to be more sure I uploaded it here again:
http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=5b0ee28bb367aed5f2fed4dd9ef5261704367df54b5c575df141edcbd33ff54a-1306367917

Its a part of the crack, which is why your getting a False Positive out of it. Usually this kind of cracks makes Anti-Virus go crazy..

Anyway the best Antiviruses report it clean so you would be relaxed:
Kaspersky	9.0.0.837	2011.05.26	-
TrendMicro	9.200.0.1012	2011.05.25	-
BitDefender	7.2	2011.05.26	-
Avast5	5.0.677.0	2011.05.25	-

and NOD32	6152	2011.05.25	probably a variant of Win32/Agent.EXXFNGM

which said probably because its not sure if its bad. (False Positive)

while even SAS reports clean:
SUPERAntiSpyware	4.40.0.1006	2011.05.26	-


But If you trust me, I tell you: It's 100% CLEAN :)"

Special note:                                           

On some antivirus scans, FFF releases packages can reveal ""Type_Win32"" or ""Trojan_Type"" virus...  Don't be stupid! It is not a virus nor anything else like that. It is just some packers/cryptors which have the   
 same binary signature.                                  
 However, some crackhosts can modify or add malicious 
things on FFF releases (like ""crack.exe""), so please,   
TAKE CARE.
This note was left by FFF team  the creators of the crack which explain everything it's not ChattChitto fault btw thanks for the great torrent."

Hey torture666killer,

You are a fucking hopeless loser moron. Buy an ipad, then when you have a problem, you can bend over and give apple a few euros to fix it for you. And CHANGE the useless bloated anti virus shit you got. Get Kaspersky or kill yourself."
,varna_81,2011-08-06T09:47Z,"To avoid frustration of the users he should just send the dll's to most big AV websites to check them and remove the detection if they are clean.

I have custome made software and all AV's on virustotal was detecting it as Trojan and so on but the file was clean.What i did is i wen to every AV website that detects it like a virus and i reported the file,then they checked it and removed it from the DB.

This here is working with KIS 2012 without any problems so i quess most AV's are wrongly detection it as virus.

So get Kaspersky and stop crying or report the dll to be checked and usse after they remove the detection.

Thank to the uploader,."

BTW you have saved me a fortune in software that I couldn't have afforded otherwise.
Note to those who are complaining and sceptical-ever heard of false positives?  Installed yesterday without a hitch after un-installing the 2010 version.
