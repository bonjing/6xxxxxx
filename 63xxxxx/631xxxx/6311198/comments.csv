How about the thirtynine steps .. with ... (wait for it) jimmy stewart and doris day.. the origional one is ... I don't like it as much.
I think we are having a psychic moment..
Grand and lovely . I will wait for ""Some enchanted evening"" and enjoy the ""Happy Talk"" here until you are able .. I think you have been busier than ever "
,ammotusker,2011-04-11T19:45Z,tx a ton 4 all d classics...!
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-11T20:11Z,"RE: The Thirty Nine Steps
I've seen the 1935 version, and the 1978 version, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078389/, and IT is the only one worth watching, imho (rather fond memories re-watching a bad vhs copy recorded during a rainstorm with my ex-wife--it was one of our favorites).  IMDB does not mention one made with Jimmy Stewart, although a 1959 version follows the Hitchcock original fairly closely"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-11T20:44Z,"@believenu: 39 steps is pre WW2, and not the one you think. Later remake is few years old. The Man Who Knew  Too Much 1956 is the only time when absolute legends, Stewart and Day, played together.
Pillow Talk (1959) and Tea for Two (1950) are my favored Doris Day movies, but unfortunately, never released (or aired) in HDef form.

Digression to what you said few hours ago: your saying ""funding Hollywood again"" describes what I constantly have in mind. All movies I loved I watched ten, sometimes fifteen times - in theaters. Bought a ticket. I think I've done my share. This ""torrenting thing"" is payback in my last days (figuratively, I don't plan to drop dead by the end of the week)."
,believenu,2011-04-11T22:43Z,you are right it is the the man who knew too much .. based on the 39 steps.. 
,froglog,2011-04-11T23:51Z,Thank you very much for these great classic's. I will get lots of brownie point's from the wife! 
,dude8888,2011-04-12T01:15Z,"A=8, V=8, M=8
very good video quality
However, there is a HDTV station logo in the top right throughout the whole movie

This HDTV version is much better than a good 1.8Gig avi rip that I have"
,justregged,2011-04-12T03:18Z,"Your rating is a bit insulting, you give this an 8 and its much better than a 1.8gig avi encode you have so what did you rate that a 5? lol

I rate this a 10 for a/v no great suprise there is a hdtv logo its from hdtv ^^

Im off to bed thanks again for a great encode"
,neil_diamond ,2011-04-12T03:35Z,Anybody know the name of the movie where a guy makes little ships out of 100 dollar bills and floats them in a fountain? all I know is they showed the movie with MASH at drive-ins so I would assume it was within a year of MASH's release. I believe it was Black and white.

Hi, 'discovered' your uploads few weeks back, but finally today could register myself on TPB. 
First comment to 'salute' you for tireless efforts.
Have loaded [TV.Shows.Pack.4th.Week.Mar.Plus.H264[CHOOSE]]few days back for lost Girl s01e01 to e13. Currently at 82%. If you may kindly grant re-seed to help me complete.
Thanks even if you cant manage.
p.s. --> Ohh and +1"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-12T11:03Z,"@x5x5x7: Avoid loading of huge packs after 48 hours. Read everything written to avoid dissapointments, especially first lines there:

""NOTE: TimeToLive 24h (torrent's TTL) - because it's reupload

ONLY IF YOU'VE MISSED SOMETHING
!!! Do NOT take too much, seeding time is limited !!!""

I loaded that torrent, but I can seed long enough, once is ""dead"" and removed from server - it should be left alone.

Click on ""believenu"" handle, she was kind enough to pack my Lost Girl in one pack. Load that torrent and as download location choose the same place where you have unfinished ones and your torrent-program would do Recheck and - resume.

And - Welcome to TPB"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-12T11:13Z,"@rajmxxx: You requested two movies yesterday. I answered (Anaconda has go, Taxi no-go).

You have slow connection and you cannot seed back decent enough.

Think about - and be reasonable and fair to others."
,monkey_brain,2011-04-12T13:58Z,Thanks a lot!
,micmac33,2011-04-13T00:34Z,"Thanks a lot, for sharing these classics.
I'm stupefied to see such old movies with such a great quality  of image."
