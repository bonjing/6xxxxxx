The game is impossible to beat. I've been playing on the EVO for the past hour and still haven't gotten past level 1. The sensitivity is way too high. You tap to go right and he takes five steps. Also it doesn't thelp that they put a huge ad bar in between the buttons so you keep accidentally hitting that. Plus the buttons are way too small. Half of the time I tell him to jump he doesn't. So he falls off the ledge. So frustrated I had to leave a comment."

Give it a shot people, it will work, or it wont."
