Five ambitious cousins set out on a family reunion during the dead of winter. 
The purpose of the retreat is to secure their inheritance, a fortune that dates 
back many generations. Upon their arrival, Uncle Melvin (Keith David) welcomes them 
with open arms, but warns them to respect their family traditions. During the weekend, as
each of the cousins mysteriously disappear, they learn the truth about their family legacy,
blood ancestry and the ultimate sacrifice they must make in exchange for
their beloved inheritance.
