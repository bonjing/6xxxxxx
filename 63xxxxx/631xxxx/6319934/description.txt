There is an uneasy peace between the two lands of Tephos and Ferrenis. Volle, a young spy from Ferrenis and fresh out of training, is to impersonate a Tephosian noble. He is the only fox available for the job, or his superiors would certainly send someone else. For Volle is known to chase almost every male on two legs. Can he cut back on his personal life enough to play his part convincingly? "Volle" shows the fox's struggle to fit into his new role and the bitter realization he has to go through to understand the burdens of his new responsibility. 

Volle is the first published novel by Kyell Gold--a stirring tale of romance, espionage, and the intrigues common to both. Follow the adventures of a young gay fox trying to be a spy in a foreign palace, where enemies and temptations abound. Received the Ursa Major Award for Best Anthropomorphic Novel of 2005.
