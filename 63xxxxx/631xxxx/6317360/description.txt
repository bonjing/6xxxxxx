This is an album born out of love and friendship towards a great musician, who've made a difference in the lives of everyone who contributed to this project and many more. His name is bLiNd, and fell very ill a while back, and as a response to this the community of OverClocked ReMix put together this album in order to support him in his recovery.

His recovery went well, and he eventually contributed his own music to the album. Now everyone can listen to the music and read the stories of the people who wanted nothing but to help a friend in need.
