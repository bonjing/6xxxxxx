this is the final version of vlc 1.1.9
official from today : April 12th
I just renamed the exe with Final to avoid too much confusion since i seed much version of this one.
not a fake ,i swear !
100% trust and clean !
again and again use fast upload from your part for any torrent i seed,please !
If you are a slow uploader,then there is no way for you so;excepted by other peers
who will do what you will not doing yourself :
sharing !!!
stop using crapware like : FDM,Flashget and few other soft like that.
use utorrent,vuze,azureus or BitSpirit.
Bitspirit is particulary good when you might be under router and can work sometimes even better than utorrent.
Avoid using too old version who can make few conflicts sometimes as well.
Unless you are a confirmed advanced user otherwise let down such idea.
I got many problems with few vpn connections...
Guys,don't forget that VPN connection will always slowing down your internet connection
Try an hide ip to see if better...
Anyway,more you will filtering your ip and more your connection will be bad...
Set correctly your network and give a correct upload speed also :
minimum 45 ko/s for any torrent from me...
More you will give upload and more you will get fast download.
A peer downloading a torrent without giving upload is not a peer and therefore has no interest to stay on torrent network so.
Torrent means sharing ! down and up at the same time so !
ty for understanding !
seed asap with me as long as you can,please !
