Gonna Report if it works or not. Thanks Man!"
,Haegr_Wulf,2011-04-13T22:16Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! He Saved that in .exe not .app >.< Not good for anything!
,illiria,2011-04-14T02:16Z,"@ Haegr_Wulf

I have no idea what you are talking about. I'm uploading this BY REQUEST. If EXE files don't work, that's not my problem. I have NEVER seen Dragon Age 2 patches in APP extension. Maybe Mac patches don't even exist?"
,uhappinow,2011-04-14T07:16Z,"@ illiria

I already am using your ""Dragon Age 2 DLC Pack (with Patch 1.01)"" (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6243153/Dragon_Age_2_DLC_Pack_%28with_Patch_1.01%29_-illiria). So can I just download 1.02 Patch from the official site then copy paste your crack from this torrent over? Will this work?

I'm concerned over reinstalling the DLCs on top of each other again, don't know what will happen.

Thankyou so much"
,Poeticile,2011-04-16T08:31Z,"I'm confused. What is this? Obviously an executable file isn't going to do anything for a Mac, why even both uploading this? "
,gourgeon,2011-04-16T16:31Z,"Btw Illiria (I wont say youre dumb, dont take it like that), but Mac doesn't work with executable files. Still, the programs are most of the time are most of the time using wrapper, like Dragon age 2. Dragon age 2 was installed from a disk, not from a exe file :( (one guy told you just copy addins file, I think its what you did so I'm gonna try it and give feedback about it)"
,razdolbay,2011-04-16T20:14Z,"omg guys... Thanks for torrent

and for those who just bought mac... right click dragon age 2 app>show package content>Contents/Resources/transgaming/c_drive/Program Files/Dragon Age 2/bin_ship swap exe file 
and yes, official DA2 for Mac is a native port"
,salfanar,2011-04-16T21:32Z,"it actually works quite well!
just wondering where to copy the DLC's to..?"
,salfanar,2011-04-16T21:34Z,"works like a beauty and the DLC's work as well like a charm. great upload, good work.
let's hear it for illiria!"
,gourgeon,2011-04-16T22:19Z,"Your patch doesnt work for me... So I uninstalled my game and didnt add any patch. I put DLCS in addinsn Dragon age 2 file, they work like a charm, makes me happy :D . Anyway, patchs were mostly for PC fixes... "
,Poeticile,2011-04-17T07:57Z,Is there a DA 2 for Mac torrent?
,BlueBallsItch,2011-04-22T17:20Z,"I tried using this ""crack"" with my existing 1.00 installation in two ways:

1)  Let DA2 download and update the original exe file to 1.02, then replaced it with the crack.

2)  Simply replaced the 1.00 cracked exe with the 1.02 crack.

In either case, even though I may be able to play the ""pro-logue"" portion, the moment it goes to the player creation screen, OR I try to load an existing game, it crashes (typically with ""abnormal program termination"") and returns to the Finder.

This is using a 2008 Mac Pro 2x2.8, 12GB, ATI Radeon HD 5870.

I have not tried using the included updater via virtualization or Boot Camp.

So, for those stating they ""got it to work"" can you explain step-by-step what you did?"
,manny0509,2011-05-15T15:13Z,"I am also experiencing the same problem as BlueBallsItch(>.>). I've tried using crossover to launch the patch but it doesn't work... Those who say it works, can you please explain how? Thanks."
,MadMadDan,2011-05-29T08:42Z,"The crack, indeed, does not work. However, the DLCs included with it work perfectly. No patches necessary, if that's what you're after. If you're too lazy to uninstall/reinstall the game to make it work again, then simply copy the original crack (I use the RELOADED crack btw, I dunno if it'll work with other cracked versions.)

For those of you confused on how to apply said DLCs, just copy the addins folder, show package contents of Dragon Age 2 (right click the applications in Finder), go to Contents->Resources->transgaming->c_drive->Program Files and paste it into the Dragon Age 2 folder.

Hope this helped."
