Rowling's novels feature a teenage boy named Harry who grows up in a normal world. When he is eleven years old, he discovers that he is a wizard and attends a magical academy called Hogwarts, where Albus Dumbledore is headmaster. Harry discovers his past about a dark wizard and attempts to destroy him once and for all.

In the books, the fantasy is about magic. Harry Potter is born with the power to do magic, as he is a wizard. He soon discovers that there are a lot of magic people, other wizard and witches, in the world, living unknown to most non-magical people (known as "muggles"). When he is eleven, he gets a letter inviting him to go to a boarding school called Hogwarts for young witches and wizards. Each book tells about one year of his life at school, about the people that he meets there, the things that he learns, and his adventures.
