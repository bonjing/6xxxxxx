,brownkity,2011-07-16T15:53Z,"No Problem. I LOVE Harry Potter, and am sad that the books and movies are over for now... but who knows, J.K. Rowling says that it's her baby, and if in 10 years, she feels that she wants to continue HP, she will, because it is her baby. I hope that she does. I'll be waiting... Until then... Happy Reading. I have the hard copies, but sometimes I just want to whip out my iPod and read it. E-Books beats lugging around 7 heavy books any day. That is why I decided to upload these books. Thanks Seeders! Continue to keep Harry Potter alive!"
,rdc422,2011-07-18T11:52Z,Thank you. Rowling is working on more books that center around the kids.
