,Polant,2011-04-12T07:25Z,EVERYONE is a leecher until you've finished downloading.  A new torrent will ALWAYS have a ton of leechers.  Failure to understand this concept is the reason stupid people shouldn't be allowed on the Internet.
,catfly,2011-04-12T09:55Z,I second Polant.. sanitysnoop why doncha read a book about the internet man.
,jerma88,2011-04-12T11:52Z,"Great quality! V/A 10/10

,DickDickstein,2011-04-13T01:46Z,"It amazes me that people are at least smart enough to download a bittorrent client, but have no concept of how a torrent actually ends up with seeders. They act like it is some magical thing where the second it is put online it automatically just has thousands of people waiting to upload it to them. 

You stupid fucks need to search ""how torrents work"" on Google and not hurr durr every fucking torrent 5 minutes after it is listed. "
,egkefalos,2011-04-13T13:51Z,thanks!
,btomi,2011-04-13T19:44Z,eztv! you are amazing!
,Nufec,2011-04-14T00:09Z,"eztv mate your a fucking legend, cheers man"
,rst108,2011-04-24T01:37Z,"@sanitysnoop Sorry dude, My ISP has a fair use policy that limits my upload and download total per month to 300GB. If i seed anymore my speed could be reduced to crap. 

I do normally seed for two weeks on every torrent but they sent an email recently saying that i had reached 280GB that month and that they could reduce my speed. 

The ISP is actually a pretty lenient one so if i change the situations not gonna be much better, especially considering its the only ISP in the area that is Fibre optic and others would cut my speed in half."
