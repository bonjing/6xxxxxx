This contains all 11 of the completed Horatio Hornblower audio books by C.S. Forester that I have managed to collected from various locations. I wanted to put them all together in one place to make it easier for others to find.

These sea-fairing swashbuckling stoires chart the rise of Horatio Hornblower from a lowly Midshipman up through the ranks of the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic wars. You may remember these stories from the TV shows but they don't do these tales the justice they deserve.

Include audio books (these are in chronological or listening order):

1 - Mr Midshipman Hornblower
2 - Lieutenant Hornblower
3 - Hornblower and The Hotspur
4 - Hornblower and The Crisis
5 - Hornblower and The Atropos
6 - The Happy Return
7 - A Ship of the Line
8 - Flying Colours
9 - The Commodore
10 - Lord Hornblower
11 - Hornblower in the West Indies

If you like the Sharpe series by Bernard Cornwell or the Emperor series by Conn Iggunden then this should be right up your alley. These are often cited as Sharpe at sea, even though they were written many years before, and are just as entertaining.

These are in all in MP3 format mostly at 128Kbps but are good quality.
