,Robin5555,2011-04-12T00:23Z,"WOW ! SIRJI ! no words to say, i just asked a request to you knowing that probably it's not possible for you as Sadgati was not a cinema hall release, it was released in TV.
And you have it & make a torrent for me within a day !!!
I have all Ray's collection except Sadgati ! And you make my collection FULL ! HATS OFF SIRJI !

WHAT YOU HAVE MADE JUST UNBELIEVABLE ! ACCEPT MY 'PRANAM' & 'NAMASKAR', WHAT A MODEST PERSON YOU ARE ! LONG LIVE SIRJI & TPB !!!

,Sharp-shooter,2011-06-03T23:00Z,"Dear Malikjee,

First let me thank you for some outstanding work buddy. You have some great choice of films that have been very very hard to find.

I am a researcher in Canada and am looking to find a copy of SAMAR by Shyam Benegal. Could not even get a copy from Mr. Benegal himself. You are my only hope now.

Cheers!"
