              The movie details the experiences of            
               "Peter Pan" author J.M. Barrie, which lead      
               him to write the children's classic. He         
               got to know four children who have no          
                 father. Drawing from his time with the          
                 kids, he writes a story about children who      
                don't want to grow up.
