,jmac85,2011-04-13T22:18Z,"Thank you for this pack. [+1]

That's as short, non-stupid, and to the point as I can produce."
,ladderman22,2011-04-13T22:33Z,hmmm. I am sure this has been asked before but are you doing full season rips of any of your shows? I ask cause sometimes I miss your uploads and hate to watch a show skipping episodes. I also hate to make requests of somebody so obviously busy so I wont ask you to re-up stuff but if you're dong full season packs (at least of certain shows) that'd be cool.
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-13T23:28Z,"No reason to miss a thing. I never miss the shows I really like and if I have (not knowing that some show is good) I was prepared to go any length to get episodes. Point being, I know that ""I"" have missed something and ""I"" am and have been only one who can make it as ""I"" need. Catch what I'm trying to say? If ""I"" find help in that, I am happy, but ""I"" realize that asking for help is not really needed today, when any movie, any show can be found by powering little gray cells we have between ears.

I DID season packs for most of the shows. You just haven't look hard enough. And if I did not - maybe I haven't because I hate making surplus in season collections for shows available like in 16 incarnations - in ALL sizes possible. Why, for fuck's sake is needed to make 14th pack of ""House"" season - when 13 packs already exist? I don't get many things, and obviously, these are ones I never would - understand."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-13T23:36Z,"Thank you for this iCarly epi; also, The Good Wife, NCIS, Waking the Dead, and Body of Proof."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-13T23:39Z,"a small request--could you, in future, include in your .nfo files for movies the short synopsis and imdb link page that you post to the pirate bay to introduce the movie?  Would be SO appreciated!"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-13T23:41Z,"... and I personally seed EVERY episode in specific week 4 days out of 7 - on fastest line this planet have. 4 days - (2 days Daily packs + 2 days Weekly pack) where one can download one episode in 6.2 SECONDS. Not to tell that many put in their mouths more candies than  they can swallow... (figuratively)

And because I am doing  it for free, I cannot be hold responsible for crappy lines individuals have. "
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-13T23:44Z,"RE: why would someone want a 14th season pack of (ugh) House when 13 exist elsewhere?
most all exist as ~350MB/episode, whereas 20-40's exist as ~127 to ~148 MB/episode, generally with better quality, often with subtitles."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-14T00:02Z,"@formerly_azrielle: NFO is done in moment of creation of specific encode, by specialized program and is untouched and unedited, It must stay like that as sort of certificate.

IMDB link and synopsis are pulled in time of upping, what could even months later, and are done by hand, by my pure good will.

Any browser have integrated Google Search - marking (pulling cursor over) the name and year and right-clicking ""Do Google search"" takes less time than writing these lines.

First result Google spew is - IMDB.

Than, copying and pasting info one needs and a link in existing .nfo (Notepad, Wordpad) or in separate Info.txt file for future reference should be easy task for any common computer user."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-14T00:09Z,"@formerly_azrielle: Regarding small-size and quality, that's not the case. Many encode better than myself, many encode in similar size... 

I KNOW that because I search every day because of requests here.

People wants one-place-have-it-all and easy-peasy approach - and I cannot provide that."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-14T00:25Z,what could = what could happen
,mdiggity,2011-04-14T05:58Z,Thanks
,ladderman22,2011-04-16T01:39Z,"Wow - didn't mean to excite anybody!
I wasn't asking about packs already created, I was asking about shows that are not done with their seasons yet. Like Formerly azrielle I like and trust your packs best, but i do know that others make them too So I'm not asking you to create anything you don't want to. I wasn't asking if you've already made packs; I was asking if it's in your future plans..."
