Scream Machine is female-fronted industrial machine rock. Monster music. It is your soundtrack for the impending zombie apocalypse. 

Mixing hardcore gabber beats and bass with more traditional percussion, industrial sounds, metal, rock and punk guitars with Scream Machine frontwoman SinDelle Morteâ€™s alternately sexy and ripping vocals, Scream Machine is not your everyday mainstream industrial sound. According to SinDelle Morte, â€œA lot of the industrial and electronic music today sounds really over-processed and over-produced to us. Itâ€™s industrial. Itâ€™s not pop. Itâ€™s supposed to be hard and heavy and gritty and nasty-sounding. We want to kind of get away from that over-processed sound.â€

Scream Machine receives play on many web and land radio stations all over the world and in many bondage, fetish and S&M nightclubs, as well as many fetish venues, including London Fetish Fair and SPANK! Festival. Scream Machine was a featured artist on MyStage Music 5 times in 2009, was the theme song for the Halloween episode of horroraddicts and was voted \\\"Best Band: Season 3\\\" on HorrorAddicts.net .
