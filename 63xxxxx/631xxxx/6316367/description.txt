If you like this album, please buy a copy. They self-publish their work and anything you spend actually goes to them, not a multinational record company. Their website is www.bowserandblue.com (easy to remember) and you can purchase their albums and DVDs there; if something is currently out of print, they`re willing to burn a copy for you.
