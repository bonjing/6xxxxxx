Unlike many of King's early '70's boots, which have been in tape circulation almost as long, his April, '75 show at Cain's Ballroom in Tulsa, Oklahoma seems to have bobbed to the surface somewhat more recently. As far as I can tell, it first started popping up in trading circles only about 6 years ago, having been cleaned up and sound adjusted along the way. The end result is a crisp-sounding, high-octaned show that just rips.

Playing the ballroom circuit, as opposed to festival or televised slots, usually meant Freddie had the time and space to stretch out, as he treats us to here, producing a two-disc beast of a show that comes on strong and keeps on swinging.
