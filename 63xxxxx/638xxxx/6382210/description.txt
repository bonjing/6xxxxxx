The setlist of my first all ages gig on February 12th 2011 - complete with mess ups, crowd noise, improvisation, and anything else that comes without warning in a gig! It was my first, big, REAL gig. I was nervous, can't deny that, but I had an absolute blast overall and wouldn't change any of it for the world. Hopefully the first of many gigs in the future!
