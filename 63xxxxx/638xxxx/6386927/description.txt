same job than my previous seed about
preactivated version !
same tips also.
all credit goes to Dimitry then.
Special thanks to him.
this is a minor update so decide yourself about...
however i decided to stop to seed previous version...
as usual 100 % clean of course.
to all morons :
please,stop vomiting your stupid lies and bullshits to me !!!
this is pretty disappointing and kinda really pathetic !
live your life but far away from me,right ?
I don't want to waste my time with you as i perfectly know what i do,what i seed
and this since i was born so.
But it seems it is really not your case...
So stop bitching and go back to school or learn more intelligent things instead of bother me.
Don't affirm anything without knowing what you do or saying.
And try to be mature,first !
I hopefully this will resolve the hard conflict in your small head...
Anyway i really hope so !
...
Ty for understanding 
Btw there's a lack of a super moderator here...
Would be very usefull for such stupid guys so...
Right now !

Enjoy and have fun

wish you have a prompt download so.

as usual,if you like it,please,seed a moment with me to the other peers.
Thx in advance


regards
