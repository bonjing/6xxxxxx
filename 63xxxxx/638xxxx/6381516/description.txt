- EXCLUSIVE: Playwright Tony Kushner Speaks Out on CUNY Controversy, Academic Freedom and Israel

In a global broadcast exclusive, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Tony Kushner appears on Democracy Now! to announce he will accept an honorary degree at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, following a controversy that sparked national attention. Last week, the Board of Trustees of The City University of New York voted to shelve the degree after one member cited Kushnerâ€™s critical views of Israeli government policies. But on Monday night, the CUNY board reversed its decision. Kushner says he is still hoping for an apology: "In lieu of an apology, I would accept what is clearly an admission of error, judgment and lapse of responsibility on the part of the Board on defending open exchange and academic freedom." Kushner, one of the worldâ€™s leading playwrights, has long defended the human rights of Palestinians and has publicly criticized Israeli policies. â€œIt is impossible to shape a legitimate and successful path towards peace based on rhetoric and demagoguery and fantasy,â€ Kushner says. His new play, "The Intelligent Homosexualâ€™s Guide to Capitalism and Socialism with a Key to the Scripture,â€ just opened at the Public Theater in New York City.


- Historian Adam Hochschild: Lessons For the Antiwar Movement From the Pacifists of World War I

As the Obama administration continues to engage in military operations abroad, we turn now to the makingâ€”and sustainingâ€”of war from a historical perspective. How do politicians galvanize populations to support wars? Why do people continue fighting in unpopular conflicts even after nationalist fervor has waned? In his new book, the historian Adam Hochschild examines these questions and many others through the prism of one of the worldâ€™s bloodiest conflicts, World War I. The book is called, "To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion 1914-1918."
