As a result it is full of wholesome family-friendly jokes, such as:

Q: How does an evangelical Christian woman know when her daughter gets her first period?
A:  Because her son's dick tastes funny!

I plan to use some of these godly rib-ticklers at the wedding reception after I get married to my pregnant cousin at Graceland next week."

""6 shots?!? Are you celebrating something?"" ""Yeah, my first blowjob."" ""Well, in that case, let me give you a 7th on the house."" ""No offense, sir. But if 6 shots won't get rid of the taste, nothing will."""
