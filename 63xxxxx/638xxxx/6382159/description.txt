Rotterdam, Holland 1996
Date: 96-12-10
Venue: Sportspaleis Ahoy

Recording: AUD
Quality: 6
Menu: YES
Extras: None
Comments: Single cam on the balcony stage left. Shooting is a bit shaky and it looks a bit out of focus but it's hard to tell since it's a high-gen transfer. Audio is decent though, just muffled and slightly distant. Die-hards and Rotterdam show attendees only.
