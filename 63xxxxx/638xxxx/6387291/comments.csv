,humantorchid,2011-10-01T17:54Z,hey ramondryche i dont know how to seed cuz i'm new to these torrent stuff..can u tell me what you mean by seeding??
[V],RR-NE,2011-10-03T09:43Z,"After you finish a torrent download in whatever client you use, the torrent should automatically start seeding.

Seeding means that you upload the torrent so other can enjoy and they will have a speedier download.

I guess"
