N.W.A. or Niggaz With Attitude was an American hip hop group from Compton, California, widely considered one of the seminal acts of the gangsta rap sub-genre. The original lineup consisted of Arabian Prince, DJ Yella, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, Dexter Mickle, and MC Ren. Arabian Prince embarked on a solo career in 1989 and Ice Cube left that same year over royalty disputes.

Active from 1986 to 1991, the group endured controversy due to the explicit nature of their lyrics. They were subsequently banned from many mainstream US radio stations and even at times prevented from touring. In spite of this, the group has sold over 9 million units in the US alone. Their debut album Straight Outta Compton marked the beginning of the new gangsta rap era as the production and the social commentary in their lyrics were revolutionary within the genre. Rolling Stone ranked N.W.A 83rd on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Although largely unknown at the group's inception, members Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, and MC Ren would all become platinum-selling stars as solo artists.
