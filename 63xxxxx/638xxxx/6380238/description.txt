"Pretty Dead"

During rehearsal for "Baron's All-American 
Beauty Pageant," the contestants are 
shocked to discover the body of Miss 
Illinois - strangled, but by whom? As 
Castle and Beckett delve into the cut-
throat competition of the pageant world, 
they learn that a number suspects had 
motive for murder, including jealous fellow 
contestants, the pageant's larger-than-life 
millionaire sponsor, Victor Baron (Michael 
McKean, "Curb Your Enthusiasm"), and the 
show's host -- hedonistic TV personality, 
Bobby Stark (Sasha Roiz, "Caprica")

Enjoy :)
