Release Notes....: This documentary movie was aired at what I'm assuming is its original AR, 1.85:1. It was not formatted to fit a 16:9
		   screen. The only allowed resolution for 720p TV releases would have yielded a nearly 4% AR error and the picture
		   would have looked ridiculous. As such, the release was resized to the closest AR to the original with mod 16 height.
		   1280x688 yields a less than 1% AR error.
