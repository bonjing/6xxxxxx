,ChiliNoMoreX,2011-05-13T15:08Z,such an horrible game.. letdown of the year.
,NanoEntity,2011-05-13T15:25Z,"Its not too bad if you like objective shooters with RPG elements for example Borderlands co-op, obviously if you play COD or BC2 you def wont like it.

The down side is, the game needs more maps, alot..."
,RMJ13,2011-05-13T16:24Z,"No SUCH AP, However you can play this on Tunngle with Smartsteam But even with the best game pc,s KNOWN, it lags to no end!

 Worst game of the year! same issues on the xbox!"
,YeOldeSnake,2011-05-13T16:32Z,"They said they will release mod tools , so people make their own mods and maps"
,xRaccoon,2011-05-13T17:42Z,"This works :O
Thanks for the upload man! Brink was pretty boring with the bots. Online is actually enjoyable ^^. I might go out to buy it.

The GreenLuma thing is interesting too. Never knew these hacks existed. But can you be banned on steam? Is it detectable?"
,NanoEntity,2011-05-13T18:15Z,Make a separate steam account if you wanna be really safe for your main gaming one.
,dragas123,2011-05-13T18:51Z,dont work i go to free play and no servers what problem?
,xRaccoon,2011-05-13T19:22Z,"Thx for the quick reply, I don't have a main steam account, only a one for haxors so I'm safe :]

Does this patch connect me to other pirates only? Or the official servers? Cause the ammount of servers is pretty low for such a high profile game."
,cabatr03,2011-05-13T19:26Z,"not work for me


no server
"
,NanoEntity,2011-05-13T20:17Z,"I see servers, like many other people do.

Try
Steam - Settings
Downloads + Cloud
Download Region
US-Miami / Atlanta"
,NanoEntity,2011-05-13T20:17Z,Else your behind a firewall or you have a router and need to open Ports.
,pieGoodman,2011-05-14T03:25Z,"Doesn't work. I only see like 3 servers with a very high ping. 

I forwarded my ports, added to firewall exception list, and set my Steam location.

This crack doesn't seem to work. Only lets you connect to hacked/Update 1 servers.

Update 2 (which everyone is using) does NOT work."
,NanoEntity,2011-05-14T04:35Z,"Thats the idea, it works with update 1/hacked servers.

Obviously you wont be able to connect with retail users."
,xiIix,2011-05-14T07:09Z,"Dunno why people even bother with this kind of shit. The servers are always slower than dogshit and the population could fit in a closet. It's not worth it, it never was worth it, if you want to game online just buy the game."
