,weaping_reaper,2011-05-13T00:30Z,Fuck no this aint real... It's just a tracklist and nan music!
,weaping_reaper,2011-05-13T06:43Z,Why won't VLC play any of it? Never had that problem!
,weaping_reaper,2011-05-13T06:52Z,"Heh, My mistake dude, I hear ""The Music"" now.. I don't know what happened? I couldn't hear SHIT the first 2 times I downloaded this.. Sorry I was a fuckin Jackwagon."
,weaping_reaper,2011-05-13T07:00Z,"I give up on this torrent man, It lets me preview the songs, but when they get done, nothing plays."
,freakinsweet24,2011-05-15T04:38Z,It is real. weaping_reaper was just being a jackass. Awesome quality dude. Thank You!
[T],PeteSapai,2011-05-15T18:23Z,"WReaper, try updating vlc, older versions (1.0.5) cant play these files, the latest vlc can. Or just use a decent audio player (yes, I said it, vlc sucks! ;)). Even windows' old mplayer2 can play these files :p
Anyway, this is real (and over a month in advance!). Thanks!"
,weaping_reaper,2011-05-15T23:24Z,"Thanks PeatSapai.. The new VLC is just what I needed, I can hear new CROSSFADE now! AWESOME!

This torrent is real, and AWESOME!"
,jrob8705,2011-05-22T19:42Z,Bit Rate?
,weaping_reaper,2011-05-27T20:15Z,Dude! This album is AWESOME! I'm gonna buy it twice! OPEN YOUR EYES is AMAZING!
,twiztid_clown65340,2011-06-13T10:54Z,awesome man thanks!!
,NFlynn,2011-06-14T14:03Z,"You know why Crossfade was fired from Colombia Records? Because not enough copies of their 2nd album were sold.

Sloan (frontman) got into depression, the band was practically dead. But Hall joined and the band resurrected with this album.

Please realise that the same same might happen to this amazing band again because you've uploaded this torrent."
,ColdWicked,2011-07-12T05:46Z,iTunes doesn't load these files
,gember25,2011-07-15T22:28Z,yeh hes right you can add them to itunes library but will not play once on an ipod
,prs_fan,2011-09-22T17:52Z,"@NFlynn, yes that's what I read on Wikipedia. The second album sold around 200,000 copies, whereas the self-titled sold over a million. Which, let me tell you. If I was to sell even 10,000 copies of an album, I'd be a happy camper! So I'm looking forward to checking this album out."
