I'm hoping for at least 320kbps AC3 6 channel, unlike Baum's release of similar size which is 256kbps - low for 6 channels.
And I assume it's 720X304 video - could you confirm the specs(such as bitrate) on that if you can?

Even if you just paste the 'mediainfo'.

I have expensive broadband so I have to be a bit fussier before deciding to download something  so I'd really appreciate your help.

Cheers mate!"
