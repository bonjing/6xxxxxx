''File Not Found""error"
,roundtoit,2011-05-13T15:33Z,"call me stupid!  It's a patch which should be copied and pasted into the program folder not to be treated as a click on patch button. I think that's right, but I am still getting the trial period window minus the registration file tab on start up"
,roundtoit,2011-05-14T14:04Z,"sorry to say but cannot get this crack to work at all, get all you can done on the free trial period folks"
