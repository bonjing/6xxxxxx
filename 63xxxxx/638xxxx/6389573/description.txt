The Jam were an English punk rock/mod revival band active during the late 1970s and early
1980s. They were formed in Woking, Surrey. While they shared the "angry young men"
outlook and fast tempos of their punk rock contemporaries, The Jam wore neatly tailored
suits rather than ripped clothes, and they incorporated a number of mainstream 1960s rock
influences rather than rejecting them, placing The Jam at the forefront of the mod revival
movement.

They had 18 consecutive Top 40 singles in the United Kingdom, from their debut in 1977 to
their breakup in December 1982, including four number one hits. As of 2007, "That's
Entertainment" and "Just Who Is the 5 O'Clock Hero?" remained the best-selling import
singles of all time in the UK. They released one live album and six studio albums, the last of
which, The Gift, hit number one on the UK album charts. When the group split up, their first
15 singles were re-released and all placed within the top 100.

Collection of 49 digitally remastered tracks on two CDs from Paul Weller, Bruce Foxton and
Rick Buckler AKA The Jam. This trio remains one of the most successful singles bands in
England, notching up consecutive Number One singles during the last few years of their
existence. Although they never made inroads in America during their short life-span (1977-
82), their legend and legacy has continued to grow in the U.S. with tracks like 'Town Called
Malice' (included here) used on numerous movie soundtracks and bands like Green Day
proudly admitting the influence the band has had on them. This compilation features classic
punk/pop/mod anthems like 'In The City', 'Down In The Tube Station At Midnight', 'The
Modern World', 'To Be Someone', 'The Eton Rifles', 'The Butterfly Collector, 'Going
Underground' and more..
