Helen Shapiro (born 28 September 1946) is an English singer and actress. Helen Shapiro began her singing career as a 14 year old in 1961. Hearing her voice on the first cut from Helen Shapiro at Abbey Road: 1961-1967, "Don't Treat Me Like a Child," one would never believe it. She sounds confident and as assured as someone who had been in the business for 20 years. Shapiro had some big hits in the early days of her career: "You Don't Know," "Tell Me What He Said," and the bouncy "Walkin' Back to Happiness."

Abbey Road Studios is a recording studio located at 3 Abbey Road, St John's Wood, City of Westminster, London, England. It was established in November 1931 by the Gramophone Company, a predecessor of British music company EMI, its present owner. Apart from the facility's use as a recording studio, the premises
have also been used to remaster many of the classical music recordings made at Kingsway Hall. It is most notable for being the venue in the 1960s for innovative recording techniques adopted by The Beatles, Badfinger, Pink Floyd and others.
At the end of 2009, the studios came under threat of sale to property developers, but the studio received historic site status from the British government in 2010 to protect it.
