Jason Wilber first got his foot in the door to the world of the rock and roll business at the age of 13 upon playing guitar for a local rock-a-billy band. Ever since then, he's been touring with various folk and country acts as a backing musician for such acts as Carrie Newcomer, Bill Wilson, Kim Fox, Hal Ketchum and John Prine. After winning some recognition from Billboard Magazine and the Chris Austin Songwriting Award in 1995, Jason Wilber finally released his solo debut in 1998. Courtesy of Flat Earth Records, the album's entitled "Lost in Your Hometown" and takes a cue from his country influences of Tom T. Hall and Johnny Cash.
