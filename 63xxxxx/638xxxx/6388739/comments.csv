,tpb2009Nov13jb,2011-05-19T12:05Z,"Works OK. Thanks CC!
karlocool - I also wonder what the QT means.
ChucksterP - I never burn directly with DVDFab and have no idea why yours failed. You can of course burn it later with ImgBurn or another burn utility."

DVDFab 8.0.9.0 Qt Updated!
New: Rewritten user interface with Qt.

,argusvidicon,2011-05-28T01:23Z,It's important to me to thank you for many of your uploads.  They have allowed me to experience several programs.  Many of which I would purchase after a lengthily trial thanks to you.  My 15 day trial of VideoReDo TVSuite H.264 was not long enough.  That would be really nice to have you take a look at.  Thank you for everything!
