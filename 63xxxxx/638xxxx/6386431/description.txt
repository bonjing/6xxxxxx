\"Good Cop Bad Dog\"

Phil and Claire swap parenting roles for the 
day - Claire will be the fun loving good cop 
and Phil the disciplinarian bad cop - and 
it\'s literally a shock to each kid\'s system. 
Meanwhile Gloria is at it again, taking in 
every sob story and stray she comes across, 
Jay finds himself dispensing business advice 
to an overzealous entrepreneur (guest star 
Lin-Manuel Miranda) about his dog training 
business scheme, and Cameron is bedridden 
with the flu -- leaving Mitchell torn about 
the Lady Gaga concert tickets they have for 
later that night.

Enjoy :)
