not a great blu-ray rip 
especially the sound

also has ""Encoded by: 20-40"" hardcoded as a subtitle at the beginning"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-10T18:39Z,"LOL, moron, do not make it so obvious."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-10T18:49Z,"Regular visitors would recognize full meaning of having two user-names on TPB.

""It is quite funny, especially considering the lousy sound quality of said moron's encodes. Even commented on by his LOYAL fans!""

We know who moron is."

,XLight05,2011-05-11T23:21Z,"Wow what has happened? A twentyforty rip that is over 700mb in size!?

Noticed other user dude say the quality is poor - so if you have the bandwidth, better to grab ""12 Monkeys 1995 BDRip H264 AAC-SecretMyth (Kingdom-Release)"" although its slightly larger.

Nice 1280x688 quality picture on that one :)

twentyforty it would be great if you would start making your rips in 1280x720 or so."
,XLight05,2011-05-11T23:24Z,"Regarding the above, while I and others appreciate these rips unfortunately due to the filesize and resolution used it means become no better than a XviD / DVD Rip.

Go on twentyforty, be ruthless, use up a few more megabytes and a 1280x720 resolution in the next rips."
,yesh.vepa,2011-05-14T13:23Z,gud one..thnx
,berty35,2011-05-20T13:20Z,"twentyforty you are doing a great job, great audio/video for file size. Like the 720p but would like some movies in 1080p"
