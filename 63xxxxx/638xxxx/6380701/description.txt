A little hidden gem, this recording. Never lauded as much as other INXS releases, this one really grows on your ears so to speak, from the lush Middle Eastern melody on the opening piece to the forever lovely Beautiful Girl. Inxs explores some new avenues, using arrangements and instruments that were a wide variation from anything the band had tried before, and the result is one heck of a good collection.
