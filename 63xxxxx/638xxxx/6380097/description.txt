Despite over half a century of diplomatic and economic exchange, there are still times when the English and Japanese languages break down in communication. We'll assume this is why a Google search of Mushi-No-Ne produces no less than half a dozen variations on the PR statement of intent for the album. What we can gather is that the title means "the sound of insects" and that elements of jazz and hip-hop make up the musical intention of the artists known only as No. 9. The jazz technique is there for certain, with ensemble selections dissected into ultra-minimal movements of rhythm. The opener, "Gates," sounds like DJ Shadow excavated beats trimmed of all but their barest digital skeletons while "Survive" pixilates free jazz through a trill '70s thriller organ tone. "Insatiable World" actually just sounds like bugs while the 17-minute title track (indicated with only the Japanese characters) doesn't sound like much of anything except for the occasional spacey synth scale. With microscopic antennas, No. 9 picks up the barest essence of Four Tet's folk and Koop's jazz leanings, and deposits them in a fragile pile on the ground. Step cautiously.
