AC/DC are an Australian rock band, formed in 1973 by brothers Malcolm and Angus Young. The band is commonly classified as hard rock and are considered pioneers of heavy metal, though they themselves have always classified their music as simply (rock and roll). To date they are one of the highest grossing bands of all time. AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, in 1975. Membership remained stable until bassist Mark Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1978 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980, after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group briefly considered disbanding, but Scotts parents urged them to continue and hire a new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released their highest selling album, and ultimately the highest-selling album by any band, Back in Black.

Recorded live on Jul 21, 1979 at Oakland Coliseum Stadium (Oakland, CA) Day On The Green #3: Ted Nugent, Aerosmith, AC/DC, Frank Marino & Mahogany Rush, St.Paradise (July 21, 1979).
Also called "The Monsters Of Rock" show. Aerosmith's set has been bootlegged in video form. This was reputedly the only footage from any of the 1970s Day On The Green concerts to be available (other film footage has been found, but not widely released - Fleetwood Mac from 1976 for one). It was somehow taken from the famous Bill Graham vault sometime in 2006/2007.
