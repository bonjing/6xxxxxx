Summary:
Tupe (Om) and Tien (Om) are twins who are the exact opposite. Tien is carefree and a total playboyâ€“or so he seems. Tupe, however, is a stern guy who is a workaholic and doesnâ€™t care for any romance. So when Tien meets Krachao (Min) at a beauty pageant, it was like love at first sightâ€“or so he thought. Tienâ€™s mother got very worried and asked Tupe to fly back from Switzerland to deal with his little brother. Meanwhile, his father doesnâ€™t really care and totally stays indifferent.

Krachao didnâ€™t exactly care for Tien thinking that he was just some drunk loser that she would never meet again. Plus, she didnâ€™t have the time to deal with him anyway since she has a drunkard as a mother and her father left to be with some other woman issues to deal with! Krachaoâ€™s mother kept pressuring her into finding a rich husband so that theyâ€™d be rich, hoping that Krachaoâ€™s father would come back to them. Krachao caves in and decides to go to work where Meegrob (Sammie) is working when she found out that the family have a single son!

And you guess it, Tupe and Tien are the owners of the Rachinee Orchid Farm, the best and most well-known orchid farm in Thailand. A little mishap occurred that caused Tupe to believe that Krachao is a terrible woman. He tries in every way to get in between Krachao and Tupe in order to protect his little brother. Was he wrong? He wasnâ€™t, as Meegrob was trying to help Krachao catch Tien as well! However, Krachao isnâ€™t really into Tien and Meegrob happens to have a crush on him too. Oh, not to mention that Tupe starts having feelings for the girl his brother is going for!
