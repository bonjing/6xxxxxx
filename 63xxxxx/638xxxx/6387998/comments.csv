,kcg420,2012-06-12T09:52Z,"I have been waiting for this to dl for over 2 weeks now because the speed goes up and down, but mostly down.... get it off the list if you are fucking watching it or quit fucking with other uploads until more dedicated uploaders have it "
,kcg420,2012-06-12T09:57Z,This may be free but its not worth the wait....find a smaller file size if you want it by tomorrow
