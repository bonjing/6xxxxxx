With a multitude of options and a comprehensive library of plugins, skins and skin packs, you can extend and customize Trillian in any way imaginable. Show RSS feeds or even play music while chugging along with a contact list right out of Terminator 5. Trillian is built directly in C++ using native Windows APIs.
