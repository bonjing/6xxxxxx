Little question about blocking to call home and guide updates.

I blocked eye TV with Little Snitch for  all connections but would like to use TV Guide.

Does any one know how to block home but still use TV Guide ?"

,MandySTFU,2011-07-15T14:51Z,"Works great! (People, please give this +1)
I'll be seeding for a day.

Anyone know if you allow the updater, will it de-validate the license or am I stuck with this version until the next crack?

For now I'll have Little Snitch deny, thanks again."

,DvT093,2011-08-10T12:11Z,"Sorry for double-post, but @MandySTFU: I know you can't update, or even allow any connection to Elgato, because at some moment your serial becomes devalidated.
And then you have to use EyeTV Reporter (Elgato's removal utility) to uninstall EyeTV completely.
Then you can install the old one again and use the same serial, only be sure to block all connections."
