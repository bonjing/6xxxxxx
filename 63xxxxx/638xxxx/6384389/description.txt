Lars Bo Hanson couldn't write a bad book if he tried....Improve Your Chess is just a fantastic read from beginning to end. If you haven't been turned onto any books of his then I suggest you start with this one. I can't help but love it because I think it's very important for any player to get an understanding, a feel, for the history of the game. He gives us this with plenty of prose and none of these silly informant style notes. This guy writes great chess books that teach because he cares. When you're done reading this one go and get anything else by him. He will never dissappoint....
