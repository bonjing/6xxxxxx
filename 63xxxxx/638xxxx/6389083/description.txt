You don't have to be mad, murderous, drunken, driven, lonesome, ornery, or blue to sing country music ... but it sure helps. Ira Louvin wasn't a" of the above, but he was something. Emerging in the 1940s, Charlie and Ira Louvin slotted neatly into the country music tradition of close-harmony brother duet singing-following in the footsteps of The Delmore Brothers and acting as an early template for The Everly Brothers.

This, their first full album, remains one of country's essential bedrock releases. Charlie's baritone and Ira's pure high tenor trade and fuse with lilting style and beauteous grace. It is gospel-fired bluegrass shot straight from the heart. The artwork most commonly associated with the record features Charlie and Ira superimposed over a distraught blonde clutching a crumpled letter, dime store novel style.

This illustration was added for later reissues, and it romanticizes the truth. In fact, for Ira and Charlie these songs of sin and weakness, tragedy and temptation were all too real. There was nothing at all knowing or kitsch about them. Still, it was Ira's self-destructive bent that lent them their knife-sharp edge. Charlie was stable but Ira was a drinker, a womanizer, and prone to flying into violent rages.

By 1963 Charlie had had enough and quit to go solo. Ira had survived much-including being shot by his third wife, Faye-but in 1965 he was killed (with his latest bride) in a car crash in Missouri. Gram Parsons would later be responsible for a renewal of interest in the brothers' music, and since then the Louvin legend has continued to deepen and grow over the decades.
