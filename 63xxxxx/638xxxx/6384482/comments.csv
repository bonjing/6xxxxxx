This is to thank all Finnish people that approved the bailout and tell you:

1) Almost all Portuguese citizens are serious people, concerned with Portugal and its obligations;

2) The real CANCER lies on the politicians: 
THEY SHOULD ""ALL"" BE TAKEN TO JUSTICE!!!! AND STAY IMPRISONED FOR LIFE!!!! 

With LOVE from PORTUGAL."
