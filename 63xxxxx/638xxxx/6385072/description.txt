This is how a remix album should be done. Each track is reinvented, but maintains some sort of link to the original.
It starts off with the weakest track, which wasn\'t what I expected when I saw Matthew Herbert\'s name next to it (his remix of Serge Gainsbourg\'s \'Bonnie & Clyde\' is something else), yet after that things stay at a consistently high level.
Jan Bang\'s reworking of \'Dead Indeed\' is ululating and hypnotic; The Cinematic Orchestra\'s take on \'Vilderness\' incorporates a fair slab of their own material, which is fairly original for a remix (any fan of Molvaer should check out The Cinematic Orchestra\'s own albums); the Deathprod remix of Kakonita is dark, watery and cinematic; while the TeeBee version of \'Ligotage\' steps things up a bit, with a kind of drum \'n\' bass/two step rhythm.
The Funkstorung remix of \'Solid Ether\' and the Pascal Gabriel take on \'Dead Indeed\' are fairly average, but then they have just been preceded by eight fantastic reworkings. Taken outside the context of the album, they\'re still good remixes.
The finale, The Incunabula Mix of \'Merciful/Ligotage\' by Bill Laswell is the most beautiful and accomplished track on here. The tablas are incorporated brilliantly, oscillating with the brass, and leading the rest of the bass and drums in. I can\'t put into words the quiver that this track brings to my insides.
