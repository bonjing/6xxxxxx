Version 5.0.73 (Released January 20, 2011)
â€¢ Feature: Added a help link to the file system event log display window to assist users in interpreting common events.
â€¢ Feature: Added an option indicating whether or not the folder browser panel should rebuild itself in response to storage device change notifications broadcast by the Windows operating system.
â€¢ Feature: Added experimental support for low-priority I/O on Windows Vista and later. This option can be enabled on the Advanced pane of the Options window, and causes disk I/O generated by file system analysis and search threads to be scheduled at a low priority. This helps to reduce I/O contention at the expense of performance.
â€¢ Feature: Added several new how-to topics to the FolderSizes help file.
â€¢ Feature: Added the ability to Run a scheduled task directly from the Task Scheduler window.
â€¢ Bug fix: Resolved issues with scan filtering that could produce unintuitive results for top-level file system objects in specific circumstances.
â€¢ Bug fix: Sorting on the file types detail view file report was not being retained between analyses.
â€¢ Bug fix: Resolved memory leak in largest / oldest file reports, occurring only in specific circumstances involving sequential scans.
