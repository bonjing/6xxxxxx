Some tips:
An initial dialogue box of alarm clock appears at the startup.
To stop it go to System>Preferences>Startup Applications and deselect Alarm clock.
You can also deselect some other startup items if you do not use them, if you are not sure about
something please do not deselect it.
If you are too desperate to use microsoft office 2007, then you can install it using
Applications>Games>PlayOnLinux
ALL THE BEST!
