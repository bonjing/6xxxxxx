A TOP 10 MOVIE - at least for me.
Beautiful movie, sad, moving, provocative. It\'s a really great taboo movie.

Riekes Liebe is a drama about a girl who can not live without her brother and goes to the extreme to make him stay so they can be united. This is the story of an uncompromising and tragic love.

Since the early death of her mother Nils and Frederike are an inseparable pair - woven into a magical web of games, jokes and rituals. The crowning achievement of their togetherness is the figure skating. Frederike is an outsider at her school but wholeheartedly feels like she belongs when around her brother. Nils in contrast wants to prove himself at last as a man, grow up and be free.

The paths of the siblings begin to separate the hard way, as Nils falls in love with the cool-ice erotic Star Lydia. Frederike feels marginalized and betrayed. But the more she pouts with intrigue, and clinging, the more it eludes the Nils. Because Frederike believes she will no longer be able to live without Nils she begins a dangerous game with her brother. She begins to flirt with her brother.

Sibling flirting turns into desire.
Desire turns to tragedy.
