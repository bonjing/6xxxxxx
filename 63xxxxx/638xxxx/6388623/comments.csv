,zimbixel,2011-05-13T12:46Z,Why is it not uploading to any of the peers???
,NightimeDemon,2011-06-04T06:41Z,"I agree, I'm not used to the UK voices, either.

I notice nobody is seeding (according to trackers here), and then I see your comment. I'm not sure why it isn't uploading to any peers.

Just out of curiosity, are the port(s) used by your bittorrent client open? If they aren't, try opening them. Maybe it'll help, but I can't guarantee it. It's just a suggestion. If your ports are open, then I'm not sure what else you can do."

All the required ports appear to be open, there is the green tick in utorrent, but I can't even download it from a computer a few meters away!"

,OutThere877,2012-04-07T05:08Z,US-language version. Works great. Thanks!
