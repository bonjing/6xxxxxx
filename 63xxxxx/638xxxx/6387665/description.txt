Quote:
Only three years after collaborating with Alan Moore on "Watchmen," artist Dave Gibbons joined with another of comics' legendary writers for a smart and biting, but ultimately hopeful, look at the future of America. Frank Miller, who had just come off "Dark Knight Returns," tapped Gibbons to tell the story of a woman born into absolute poverty who nevertheless rises to heroic status in a country riven by internal divisions, beholden to corrupt or incompetent politicians and embroiled in wars it cannot (and possibly should not) win. Miller and Gibbons's Martha Washington, through six volumes of comics beginning with "Give Me Liberty" and ending with "Martha Washington Dies," explored the evolving contemporary culture through satire and over-the-top adventure.
