      Two Turkish anti-terrorist agents are sent to New York City       
      on a mission to find and bring back the dangerous Islamic      
      leader codenamed "Dajjal", believed to be hiding in there.     
      Working with the FBI and NYPD, the agents orchestrate the      
      arrest of Hadji Gumus, a well-respected Muslim scholar and     
       family man who years before fled to the United States after     
       being released from a Turkish prison, where he served time      
       for murder. This tale love, friendship, peace and prejudices    
    takes us on a journey  seeking to answer the question of     
     whether innocence or guilt even matters to one wholusts for   
   vengeance
