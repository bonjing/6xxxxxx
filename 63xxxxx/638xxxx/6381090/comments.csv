,Blackout046,2011-05-12T04:25Z,Stun! Do you believe 1080p Bluray file size reduction will soon be possible? Imagine this file being encoded to the size of 2 GiB...
[T],fachman,2011-05-12T09:42Z,"Well, it is already possible to shrink this movie to 2GB, but i do not think you would enjoy the final result. There are plenty of small size HDrips here where the only common thing with HD is the resolution. Do I believe it will be possible to shrink it to 2GB at good quality? At some time yes. Well if we would combine QEBS 3.4 with the really good per frame filter which would remove all the noise it would already be possible, but the problem is that I do not know such perfect filter even exists"
,F.A.S.T,2011-05-13T12:26Z,"Like to say thanks, the video quality is so good for such a small file.
However have a problem with the audio only playing in stereo. 
AAC sound must be decompressed and send through HDMI or SPDIF as PCM
How do I do that, this is my set up.
Medion 8822 Computer with  win 7 WMC.
 HDMI to my T.V (7650GS graphics card)
SPDIF to my Sony Amp, on board Realtek HD Audio
Using Shark007 codec
Tried installing/uninstalling different driver for both audio and graphics card with no luck. 
Any ideas please"
[T],fachman,2011-05-13T14:04Z,"as far as i know the player program does the decompression and send the PCM data to realtek audio. If you have the normal sound on normal speakers, what you need to do is just go into REALTEK configuration and check DIGITAL OUTPUT as the DEFAULT one. 
First check the instruction."

Please do workout the noise problem .Almost Your every recent releases having noise including Saving Private Ryan and may be this also (It seems from the snapshot)
