You dont hit make keyfile straight away... it will create an error, you gotta run the installer first, only hit make keyfile when there is a path specified. Also, they should be saved in D :/ Plugins / Akvis.

what, really? :|

,bitemeborb,2012-03-26T04:28Z,You are correct. It does not not seem to work on Win 7. Not sure what that reference D :/ Plugins / Akvis is supposed to mean. That reference does not work make it work on Win 7 either.

I just get either an ""Application has stopped working"" as soon as I try to open it or absolutely nothing happens at all."
