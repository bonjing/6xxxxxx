Victoria Williams is a storyteller of her own kind who possesses a matchless whimsicality. On her fifth album, Sings Some Ol' Songs, Williams' peculiar vocal beauty comes alive in an exciting collection of traditional standards. It's a great fit, too. Williams is delightfully intelligent in giving some of these songs new life, but doesn't miss out on the initial grace behind them all. Williams soaks herself in light jazz sounds on the blushing rendition of Henry Mancini's "Moon River." Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart's classic "My Funny Valentine" is vocally sleek, while the old-timey good time of "Keep Sweeping Cobwebs Off the Moon" and the sassy salsa beats of "And Roses and Roses" are fashionably more her style. The obscuro fun of Eden Ahbez's "Mongoose" is equally playful. Sings Some Ol' Songs is essentially a reverie of traditional pop and its musical roots. The production is clear and concise, allowing the dreamlike quality of Sings Some Ol' Songs to simply arrive. Williams keeps things innocent in a natural way in keeping listeners interested. With this particular album, she's introducing swan songs of yesteryear to a new audience. It's absolutely lovely.
