Once Huey Lewis and The News took control of their sound on Sports, their canny blend of R'N'B, Rock and Pop made them superstars. They established themselves as a first-class live act, their videos were polished and clever, and as a front man, Lewis had become a star in his own right. The follow-up was "Fore," an album that seems a bit caught up in its own desire to please and sound serious, still having enough ace craftsmanship that two of the songs went to number one.
