This book is AMAZING. It speaks to the humbling christian and will stir up thoughts in your mind, and will also give you great jump start or ending to each day. If you need to get in the Word, but do not think you have the time, or the committment, this book will help you. Most of the passages can be read in 5 to 10 minuites.
