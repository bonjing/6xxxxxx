 Stereoscopic Player description

                     Allows you to play stereoÂ­scopic videos and DVDs

The Stereoscopic Player application was designed to be a versatile 3D movie player. It allows you to play stereoÂ­scopic videos and DVDs (external decoder required) and also allows you to watch live video from a capture device.

Since it is based on DirectÂ­Show, it can handle almost any media format, for example AVI, MPEG, WMV and ASF. Videos can be coded in several different stereoÂ­scopic formats.

Why is it necessary to use a special software for 3D movie playback? The reason is that there are a lots of different ways to watch stereoscopic content as well as different ways to store the content.

In the past, it was necessary to encode a stereoscopic movie for each viewing method, for example you had to create an anaglyph file, a interlaced file for use with shutter glasses and a side-by-side for for free-viewing without glasses.

Quality was often very low, because most video codecs don't handle interlaced content well and subsample color information (reducing color resolution to quarter of original resolution), which reduces anaglyph quality dramatically.
