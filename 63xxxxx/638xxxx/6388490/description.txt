6. Forgotten Sons 


In summary, a stunning debut from a band that sounded very Gabriel style Genesis, and an extremely enjoyable album from start to finish. The quality of the songwriting, the intensity and emotion of the singer (Fish), the dark atmospheres created by the music, make this a great album.
