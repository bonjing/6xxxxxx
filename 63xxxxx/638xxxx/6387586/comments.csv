[V],meech,2011-05-15T02:57Z,"But why rar when you don't have to.  It really doesn't serve a purpose anymore.  And it leads to less seeding.  User downloads, unpacks to watch and deletes the rar files after unpacking.  They save the unpacked file but get rid of the rar files taking up extra space.  Seeding over before it began.  On the other hand, if a user downloads an unrar'd version, they leave it on their machine seeding, while they watch it and some even after they watch it.

All and all, it's an extra unnecessary step thrown in that leads to less seeding overall.  Why take the extra step to rar it in the first place.  I (and just about the rest of the community, just don't get it).

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the shows and the effort put into encoding the end result.  But if I can choose between a rar'd and unrar'd torrent, the unrar'd gets the download every time."

Can't you see no one benefits from it?"
