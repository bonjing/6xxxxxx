[V],NomDePlume,2011-05-10T06:39Z,Unfortunately my cable went out this past Thursday.  So I had no internet or TV.  It is back working fine now.  I will post last Thursday's episode when it re-airs on Tuesday.

[T],mdprosser,2011-05-13T15:35Z,"hi -- as always, thank you so much for uploading Chelsea Lately... I DL them every day :) you rock! was wondering if (crossing fingers) by any chance you have Chelsea on Piers Morgan Tonight? She was his guest on 05/11/2011. You are the ultimate Chelsea uploader, so was hoping you had it! If not, no worries! Thanks, again, for always uploading!"
