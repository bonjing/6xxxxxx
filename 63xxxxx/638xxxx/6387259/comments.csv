[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-05-13T08:48Z,it all works just fine. perhaps try running as admin? or in compatibility mode for windows xp?

,funguseleet,2011-05-13T16:16Z,"I figured it out. Once in the game, only use the keyboard at the menus to start the game ,not the mouse. And set settings thru launcher, Then play the game thru the .exe in game folder not launcher. Thats what workd for me. Win7 x64bit"
