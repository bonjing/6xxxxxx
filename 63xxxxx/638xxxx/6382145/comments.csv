1. Download (if you have ATI Graphics) the Update listed previously and install it first.

2. Download the game torent.

3. download the patch torrent.

4. Download the Update torrent.

5. Run the Patch torrent to fix the .Iso file, I did this.

6. Install the game and copy the cracked filed from the Skidrow folder into the game.

7. Next run the update and again copy the cracked files into the game folder and overwrite all.

Run the game as admin.

I have it working on my system, no crashes no problems.

,Havick007,2011-05-12T14:30Z,"@Nephilim83

It might be your resolution.

I had similar issues with some recent releases yet no one onlone could answer the questions...

What soze monitor do you have?

If it's anywhere from 22-24in then change change your desktop setting before chaging in game settings.

It helped me massively with Assasins Creed. It lagged so badly for me with a 24in Hd monitor. But after i changed the desktop res setting and then matched it 'in-game' it ran so much better with no lag at all!! :)

Although while your in desktop your res may seem wrong, in game it will run much better!"
,Havick007,2011-05-12T14:37Z,"@Nephilim83 

I meant to write; lower your desktop res, it's trial and error but eventually you will find a good match for the game and graphics will still be good quality :)"

Ok i will go through step by step what i did to get it to work.

1 - download skidrow 'Brink' Game
2- Download Skidrow .iso Patch 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6391099/Brink.PPF.Patch-SKIDROW
( Follow Instuctions to fix .iso )

3 - Download Skidrow Update 2 -

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6390055/Brink.Update.2-SKIDROW

4- Patch Iso

5- Install ( Dont worry about Skidrow files )

6- Run Skidrow Update 2 ( Dont worry about Skidrow files again )

7- Download Crack and then copy and paste everything from the crack file to the main install folder.
( Everything in that cracked folder, just copy and paste it except for the second zip file )

8 - Play and be dissapointed :( the game wasnt worth it my opinion.


For some reason this install seems really touchy, it varies with every OS and system spec.

Also make sure to update your DirectX and C++ ( Comes with game in installed folder )

Last resorts - Update graphics drivers and run as Admin"
,Havick007,2011-05-14T13:00Z,"Just to add to my above statement - 

Also copy the 'config' file into the main install folder but in the config file change your player name to watever you want it to be.

The only problem i have now is the save game does not work, so everytime i restart the game i have to customise my character from scratch and i have no Exp points...

So if your playing to gain your Exp points then i owuld recommend playing for as long as possible otherwise if you exit and start again you will have no saved game.

If anyone knows of a fix then please post and also as far as i know this only applies to the 'REV' crack"
,Dave_247,2011-05-14T14:08Z,I've played Brink on Multiplayer and it is a LOT better then those stupid bots. Despite a few annoying bugs which will hopefully get fixed soon it's pretty good.
,Havick007,2011-05-14T14:22Z,"@Dave_247

lmao oh yeah those bots are craaap!!

Also on campaign mode the objective indicator is annoying and the constant respawns give me the shits.

This game was built to be a campaign / mulitplayer hybrid like lost planet and just like lost planet it had sooo much potential but because they made it more like multiplayer in the single player mode it just totally killed the game.

There is a multiplayer mode on games for a reason. Some people like multi and if your like me some people prefer campaign story based games.

Why bother mixing the 2 of them up, especially when this games other features are great. The character upgrades and weapon mods are fantastic along with enviroment interface ( wheich means you can run, slide and vault around any obstactles ) although there is no realistic damage to buildings or objects and the player deaths are not realistic.

It seems that they did great on everything but the basics of a great shooter... lmao thats what happens when poms build a game hehe :P\


FYI: Bethesda isnt the greatest of developers - Fallout 3 was one of the worst games i have ever played..... although this game comes close."

Hi,

I posted a solution to this previously. Google search Brink Crack and download the torrent from ahashare.

It comes with files that will overwrite the Skidrow steam cracks and also comes with a loader - 'revloader' 

One you download it, copy everything over to the install folder and use the 'revloader' to launch the game :) it worked for me. Although the save game does not work for me now, so everytime i restart the game i have to start from scratch :(

Hope that helps, i would have posted the link to ahashare but it doesnt work on here and keeps giving me erros when i try to submit my post.


@SRD


Goto the config / skidrow file you copied across from the crack and change ''player name'' to whatever you want it to be.

Save it and the start the game and it should have changed."
,Havick007,2011-05-15T15:30Z,"@serall


With the file erroryou get while installing you need to download a Skidrow patch for the .iso.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6384248/Brink_PPF_Patch-SKIDROW

( follow instructions in the nfo file to patch the .iso ) once it is patched you can run the installer again and it will be fine.

There is also an update which you should run after the install is finished -

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6392618/Brink.Update.3-SKIDROW


Then if you keep getting the error ''brink has stopped working '' donwload the other crack from ahashare with 'revloader'' and it should work.

In the rev crack folder, there is another folder 'config' did you copy the rev file into the main install folder. Dont copy the entire config folder ( there is only one file in it anyway ) Just copy the config file to the brink folder with the rest of the cracked files.

I cant say 100% that will work but within the config file there is a line that that sez:

Procname=Brink.exe 

I think that is the problem, i just moved that config file out of the install folder and got the same error.

I havent found a working solution yet, those links i gave you yesterday helped with finding the save directory but even after moving the save file to that directory it still didnt work for me. Sorry i couldnt help more, hopefully someone else will find a solution.

,Havick007,2011-05-16T06:46Z,"@senishz2


oh and dont put the rev file into the config file in the install directory, the same error comes up for me.

Just put the .ini file in the brink folder so it is in the same place/folder as the loader.

You can also change playername to whatever you want your name to be in the game. 

If you get it working you will probably have the same issues as me and some other poster's on here, you wont be able to save your game, it resets everytime i restart the game. So if your playing for exp points and upgrades etc it's gonna reset everytime you exit the game.

I hope someone finds a fix for that. The actual save game directory is:

,Havick007,2011-05-16T06:55Z,"@@rrrapper

This is how i found the save directory:

Info below courtesy:

http://www.splashdamage.com/forums/showthread.php?t=25133




Any files Brink needs to run are stored in either C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\brink or 

C:\Users\YOUR_WIN_LOGIN\AppData\Local\Splash Damage\Brink

If you want to know the specific paths on your machine open the console using ctrl+alt+` and type one of the following commands to get the path:


fs_basepath 
fs_savepath 
fs_userpath 




Ok, so while you in the game and playing a mission ( wait till spawn countdown has finished and keyboard is active )

Open the game/script console;

ctl+alt+`


Then type fs_savepath and press enter.

It will give you the save path. I dont know how to change or even if it can be changed and i dont know how to make it actually create a save game file.

With the crack i used 'revloader' it came with save.game file, but even after i cut and pasted to the above directory it still didnt help.


So goodluck and if you work it out let us know.."

To start i answer your first two questions.
1> Yes it is your videocard that doesn't support 
     3.1 shader and means it cant run.
2> Yes you can buy another videocard                
     and let this instal..(This cant be done whit 
     all models and brands so, go to your dealer 
     and ask if this can be done whit your model.) 
     Altough i do not recomment this because 
     most likely the rest of your system will also
     fall under the recommended system  
     requirements. Also it's not a lowcost  
     thing to do with a laptop.

My Advice!
Unless you have a money tree, are/or have 
very rich/parents.
Next time you buy a pc consider buying a 
desktop instead of a laptop.
This because its much cheaper overall and cheaper to upgrade. Also desktop pc are mostly better for gaming unless we start talking about alienware but then all the above doenst aplly.
Hope this answers all of your questions.

,Tyl0rC,2011-05-16T20:22Z,"After using the revloader crack and finally being able to play the game...

The game runs extremely shitty.  Unbelievably so.  11.5 drivers for ATI/AMD with the 11.5a hotfix that's supposed to improve performance for Brink.  Still huge the annoying fucking gridding which wasn't helped at all by update 2 or 3.

Backing up saves doesn't fix the revloader problem, doesn't seem to help people who bought it legitimately either.  I backed them up both in the Appdata folder in the splash damage section and created a remote folder in the steam folder.  Still have to create a new character when I start the game.

The game is...alright I guess.  Not sure why there is so much hate.  It's pretty much like TF2 though not as good but with huge amounts of customization.  

The game was quite obviously built for multiplayer with a story thrown in to say why these people are killing eachother and why they are there.  Missions can be really long if the offensive team gets the objectives done in the final seconds, or really short if you the defense wins on the first try.

Anyone else think escaping the Ark was MUCH easier?  I haven't saved it yet because I got a BSOD from one of my display drivers crashing.  The 2nd mission for ""Saving the Ark"" is annoying as hell."

What i did was open the iso that you downloaded with for example IsoBuster than select all files and extract them in the map you want. than start the exe. and when its al done put the crack in the Brink map. You dont need to burn it ore whatever.. goodluck and injoy =D THX for all your uploads extremezone

I downloaded the revloader crack and I was finally able to play except I couldn't save, but now I finally found a fix and registered in order to share with you guys. This fixes start-up crashes as well as not being able to save. 

1. Download this torrent (it only works with this SKIDROW release):    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6392044/BRINK_SKIDROW_MP_SUPPORT_V2_(NanoEntity)

2. Follow steps outlined in instructions outlined in that torrent EXACTLY. This includes not using any other skidrow cracks, so my recommendation would be to uninstall and do a fresh clean install of this release

NOTE: this torrent also works with update 3, so instead of installing update 2 that is included in that torrent and the instructions say to install, just download update 3 off piratebay and use that instead.

Enjoy the game!"

,Druidblue,2011-05-27T02:33Z,"Brink has stumped the scene, apparently. $6k machine, every driver fully updated... no combination of Skidrow patches allow the game to run, as soon as you execute the brink exe it immediately gives you a ""game stopped working"" generic crash. 

Only way around this is another patch with ""RevLoader"" in it- copying those files over and using RevLoader allowed the game to run (and work flawlessly) however, saving was impossible and thus every exit you'd lose any progress making it an exercise in frustration.

Issue seems to be with those of us who have Vista Ultimate- that tells me the scene should have no problems figuring out what's causing the crash and release a cracked brink.exe (or whatever) to fix the issue- or get the game to save when using the RevLoader approach."

The file that is 'corrupt' is one that you should have elsewhere via Dx, if IIRC.

Anyone who frequents pirate's bay for PC games should really purchase Pinnacle Profiler. It's only $20. I know we're all cheap around here, but in this instant, it's well worth the investment."

,Banzay27,2011-09-19T17:37Z,"Plays just fine with the SKIDROW update #3.
My only disappointment is how the story takes 2nd place so much. There's a lot to be told but 95% of actual playing is devoted to either passing challenges with no story background or Battlefield type of matches, with lots of fragging and dying, and the AI didn't feel to par for that kind of gaming. I always skipped abilities that only boost team mates because I could rarely rely on them. And I can safely say the enemy team AI felt considerably more dangerous. I believe that how our team mates' AI responds to us originates quirks in their behavior, such as facing us while an enemy is shooting our way or, even, a Medic trying to rush between the whole enemy team to throw us a revive.
I'd like to have seen a more story-devoted single player because I'm rather attracted to the background story. We don't even see anyone but the couple of dozen of combatants and that always takes away immersion when the story tells us that the Ark is actually way overpopulated, at least in the Guest zone.

Anyway, thanks extremezone. The gun variety and moding can be nice and a few other aspects, it's really not all bad. And I bet it's pretty fun in multiplayer."

I saved it as a non-steam game or mod in my games library to see if that would trick steam, but it didn't. Please help because I would really like to play this game asap."
,tackfurlo,2011-11-02T09:09Z,"To all those having trouble: I'm using OpenSUSE with WINE and it's working for me, can't be that goddamn hard to use in actual Windows.  To be fair, I installed in Windows 7 x64 (dual booting) but I do run the game within Linux probably 90% of the time.

Also, anyone who has Steam shouldn't be surprised when you get conflicts with Steam.  I swear, you people make me laugh.  STEAM IS DRM, NOTHING MORE!  Steam adds no value you could not get elsewhere, i.e. Gamefly, Amazon, even the local fucking brick and mortar store, without the fucking DRM!  Sorry, but you asked for it, idiots.  Anyhow, at this point sales of Brink have gone so poorly you can literally nab this puppy for $11.99 at your local Wal-Mart.  After torrenting it and playing it for a month, I did.

As to the game itself...it's all features and no content, basically.  I love the level design, the abilities, S.M.A.R.T. isn't dumb (not a freaking genius, but it does go where I want it to about 95% of the time, and the rest it's pretty close) and I even like the art, even though I normally hate this gangster-style shit.  It's not my thing, but it does fit the game - and it's a perfect contrast to the iLifeboat-esque backdrops you fight in.  The problem is really just the weapons.  Some are badly OP, some are so weak you can empty 2 clips into an enemy at 5 yards away and they can just walk over and melee you to death (I'm looking at you, Tampa SMG!)  Basically you have to equip every single stability and accuracy attachment you possibly can to every gun else most of them can't hit the side of a fucking barn.  On the other hand, if you roll a medium character, you can always equip a pair of Galactic SMGs and hipfire them from 20 yards away and do the whole run'n'gun thing and you WILL score kills.  Anyhow...just saying, they could use a metric fuckton of weapon damage balancing.  Besides that and the unfinished story mentioned elsewhere, Brink is actually one hell of a shooter.  Too bad it has done so poorly financially - we'll probably see no more DLC and no sequel so the few problems it does have will remain forever."

,TorrentQualityChecker,2011-11-29T11:26Z,I am sorry to say the game does not work.. I have tried all the methods possible. I tried 3 times thinking i was doing something wrong since this was a SKIDROW torrent. 
,TorrentQualityChecker,2011-11-29T13:28Z,"m sorry about the last comment.. The game works !!!!!!! The drivers have to be latest for OpenGl. The .iso has to be patched with SKIDROW ppf patch has to be done.
Update 9 from SKIDROW has to be applied as well. For sure after this the game works. I tried 7 times, one step at a time to check what works and what does not... Thankyou SKIDROW !! Keep em torrents coming. Peace !"

,Resilience777,2012-04-08T08:31Z,"@silversparrow

Fuck each & every one of you who declares that a game is bad just because its the ""popular"" thing to say. This game got an average rating of 6.0, so fucking what? It was all because of the poor AI scripting, but if your playing online all the time, what the fuck does it matter? AI scripting is an incredibly hard thing to master, let alone making it work with the SMART movement system that Bethesda used. Play the game yourself & form your own opinion on it, and don't gangrape it with the ""popular"" opinion.

Seems like its the hardest fucking thing in the world for people to think for themselves..."

We don't know your PC specs... But seeing as you didn't post these I assume you know close to nothing about computers :P Short answer: Get a half decent graphics card?"
