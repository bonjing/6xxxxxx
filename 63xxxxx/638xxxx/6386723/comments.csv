,stzfrkx,2011-08-13T06:18Z,Why always hardcoded swedish subs in swedish films????? A few deaf people appreciate it but all the others hate it. I found good english subs but its terrible watching the film with both subs at the same time. Thx for the rip but the hardcoding is really getting on my nerves :-(
