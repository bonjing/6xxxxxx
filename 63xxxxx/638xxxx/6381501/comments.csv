Note: For those of you that have downloaded the previous Tim Sykes torrent, rename that folder so that it reads 'Timothy Sykes Collection', then download this torrent and begin seeding.  You'll already have most of the files.  From my count, 3 more files where added and that's all you'll really be downloading.  At least this way though we can get this updated torrent fully seeded.  Thanks."
