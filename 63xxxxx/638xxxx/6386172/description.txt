With DESTROYED,Moby introduces the listener to the strange
and disconcerting life of touring that is not often
exposed -- the time spent isolated in anonymous,mundane
hotel rooms,airports,and backstage waiting areas. These
experiences are then juxtaposed with moments of intense
beauty and excitement,such as the connection that can be
felt with an audience.With touring comes extensive
worldwide travel,and Moby has fallen prey to insomnia most
of his adult life,a condition he turns to his
advantage.All of the songs on DESTROYED were written by
Moby on the road during the small hours of the night,when
his insomnia was in full tilt.The silent urban nightscapes
provided much inspiration for this album. To illustrate
the music on DESTROYED,a book of the same name with 55 of
Moby's photographs will be released simultaneously.These
shots were taken around the world while he was on
tour,illustrating the sense of contrasting emotions Moby
feels during that time.
