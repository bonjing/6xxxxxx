After a couple brief introductory tracks, Freddie comes blazing out of the gate with Big Legged Woman, kicking off a set that doesn't let up till the last note fades. From this gig are showcase readings of Yonder Comes Your Man (a Look Over Yonder's Wall update that just romps), Have You Ever Loved a Woman, and a cover of Bill Withers' Ain't No Sunshine that's just front-end loaded to burn a feller down...
