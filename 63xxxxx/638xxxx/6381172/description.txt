â€¨QuarkXPress provides a toolset that lets you design and publish for a variety of output formats â€” including the Web, smartphones, e-readers, and tablets â€” without having to learn a different skill set for each, learn to write code or program, or purchase additional software applications.

Integration with other Applications

Layout Automation

â€¨QuarkXPress not only provides you with world-class layout tools â€” it provides you with automation tools that allow you to create top-end design quickly and efficiently.

Collaboration

â€¨Do you need to keep style and color definitions consistent within a workgroup? Would you like to be able to have more than one person working on a layout at the same time â€” even if theyâ€™re in different locations? Would you like to be able to import an Excel spreadsheet, then automatically update the layout when the spreadsheet changes? QuarkXPress helps you to make sure that when you work with others, youâ€™re really working together.
