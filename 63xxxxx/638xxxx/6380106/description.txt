The Allmusic review by Tim Sheridan awarded the album 4 stars and stated "Always the iconoclast, here pianist Bley applies her keen musical skill on baroque and chamber styles with tongue firmly in cheek and a fine string section to set the mood".[2] The Penguin Guide to Jazz awarded it 3 stars stating "Very little to separate the fancy from the funky. Vintage Bley".
