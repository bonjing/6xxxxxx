[V],DeGun,2011-06-07T15:56Z,"Normaly you should find in the crack folder the serial + a DLL named ENTRY.DLL 

copy entry to instal folder , run app , enter serial , re start app REFUSE INTERNET OUT OR UNPLUG IT FROM COMPUTER then check ABOUT and GO TO OPTIONS and UNCHECK : UPDATES AUTO .

here is the crack if needed : go to  http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=95651

,ningyoh,2011-10-20T07:41Z,"Mine asks for a registration code, not a serial, and it doesn't look like the screen shown in the image above. Do I need to make an 'instal' folder in the program folder under Program Files? Please help!"
,ningyoh,2011-10-20T07:44Z,"ETA: It also asks for an email address, not a name."
