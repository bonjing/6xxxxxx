2. The keygen is not a virus, though some antivirus will say so. Anyway, it is not needed for the game to run, so you can delete it.

3. Install the openAL when the installer offers you to do it. If not, the game will not work.

4. To change the language of the game, at the main menu, go to ""opciones -> vĂÂ­deo -> idioma"" and select English or another one."

Also what is this keygen u are talking about? "
,Spirit986,2011-09-23T06:56Z,"OK, 
To everybody with Windows 7 or Vista, that has a problem with the error ""Bad Serial given in setup"" while starting the game, You have to turn off User Account Control, or the game will not run!

Just go to ""Start"" enter ""User Account Control"" in the search field, select ""Change User Account Control Settings"" and deactivate it from the console that pops up :)

That's it and have fun :)"

,gorva,2012-05-10T17:39Z,"Just found the way to make it work... it involves messing with Windows Registry, though.
1. Start -> Run; and type ""regedit""
2. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWoW6432NodeBohemia Interactive StudioArmA
3. Edit the ""KEY"" setting by double clicking on it.
4. In the ""value data"" field, type one of the following hex keys (you will have to type it, there's no copy paste here):


5. You'll see that, as you type, strange symbols appear, don't pay attention to them.
6.When you're finished, exit Regedit.
7. Enjoy! Execute ArmA.exe"
,gorva,2012-05-10T17:42Z,"Damn, forgot to paste the hex keys. In step 4, type any of these:

,gotdeadmansluck,2012-05-13T16:18Z,Ah I have figured it out no regedit BS no control panel BS to get past the Bad Key During Setup or w/e it was is to go into (after installing) Program Files(x86) into ArmA folder open #JIMBO folder then unrar arma-1_18rc it'll have a version of ArmA paste it into installation folder over original version then PLAY thanks for explaining how to install uploader :/
