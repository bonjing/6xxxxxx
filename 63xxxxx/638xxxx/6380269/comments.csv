I'm sure it would be very confusing only seeing the one ruleset that didn't work! So just be careful! Make sure to remember if you have a 32-bit system or a 64-bit system."
,kyrillos27,2011-05-10T23:50Z,"I mean, in reference to the above comment, if you don't install the proper regkey. Hopefully this will be a non-issue, but either way, good luck, comment if you need help. I'm happy to do so"
,kyrillos27,2011-05-11T00:51Z,"I'm so sorry on some of these horrible instructions on the FGII. Please excuse that. After finishing the reg edit, move the file to C:\Program Files (x86) for vista/Win 7, or C:\Program Files for XP

if it still doesn't work, just remember, if you have a 64-bit version, place it in the (x86) folder and run the vista/win 7 regkey. If you have a 32-bit, run the XP regkey and place the FGII folder in the Program Files folder"
