WhatSize helps find out what files are taking up all of that space. Then it makes it really easy to remove or move those files. Youâ€™d be surprised how many useless files are lying around on your Macâ€™s hard disk. While the app is measuring a folder the user can browse the files within that folder and immediately see the size in bytes. Hidden files, cache files, directories will all show up with their corresponding size. This application is similar to the ancient NeXTSTEP, DarkForest. Once the measuring of a folder has ended the user can also view the information by filtering for particular file sizes or types. The user can also move unwanted files and folder in the corresponding Trash bin similar to the Finderâ€™s Delete button.
