,RexRexroth,2012-03-04T00:44Z,"I am very happy to see this on TPB!  I was the music supervisor for the film (all those old torch songs from Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Anita O'Day, etc., plus the instrumental background sequences - that was all my doing).  I had great fun with everyone in making this film (especially Harvey and the late composer Peter Matz), and I sincerely hope you enjoy it!"
,peilass,2012-03-28T00:39Z,This is a wonderful film - terrific cast and soundtrack. Saw the original as a stage play in London many moons ago -- the movie catches all the best aspects of the play. To be enjoyed.
