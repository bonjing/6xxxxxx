,britneylynn,2011-09-05T13:41Z,"Only tested about two minutes of gameplay, but the games looks fine.

I just mounted it and installed the no cd which was included. The ""YASU"" tool didn't work (could not find bla bla it said), but seems to work without it. What does YASU do?"
,PiratWizard,2011-09-22T16:03Z,"The game installs fine but i got a few complains..I would be VERY happy if you would be able to help me..

Y.A.S.U : Doesn't works.. Nothing happends when i try to extract yasu.exe.

SCDALauncher : When i enter the game and press New game the game crashes and says that Splintercell.exe blablablabla crashed..
