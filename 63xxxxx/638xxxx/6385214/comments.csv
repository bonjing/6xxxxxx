,un13,2011-05-12T11:54Z,thanks! but WTF happend to south park? the 3 episodes so far sucks....
,nath6023,2011-05-12T12:32Z,I think they quit using DXM. These episodes suck so far. It goes to show how one can lose themselves while being a good strait boy. Very sad indeed.

Awesome torrent, thanks eztv!"
,mister_pirate,2011-05-12T23:14Z,"Terrible TERRIBLE episode. I dunno which one was worse - Last weeks Funnybot ep or this one. There is some sort of subtlety that is missing from the humor this season - It's too superficial ""in your face"" and trying to stay current to events (rushed is the word). This might be the last season of SP, and I think that's ok because we've enjoyed it so far, and I'd hate to see it end up like a shite show"
,benstevens1,2011-05-13T00:27Z,"Human centipad was alright, Funnybot was the worst episode iv ever seen .... hope this ones better and SP aint gonna continue to go downhill this season."
,PaddyBognor,2011-05-13T00:35Z,"there signed up for a further season and if ur english and seen all the fuss over the royal wedding ud get the humour, otherwise you wont"

,doser69,2011-05-13T05:33Z,"Definately agree with the above comments.

Funnybot was the worst episode ever.

Definately the worst since Super Fun Time.

I too hope they end South Park before it gets ""really really really shit"" like The Simpsons.

They should at least start waiting weeks and weeks between new episodes like they used to - so they can actually come up with decent ideas."
,doser69,2011-05-13T05:37Z,"This is definately better than the last episode.

Already cracked up a few times in first minute."
,doser69,2011-05-13T05:56Z,"Much better than Funnybot

But still shit by South Park's standards."
,lingling2000,2011-05-14T05:23Z,"great torrent. I don't know what you guys mean, I agree that Funnybot was the worst episode ever but this one was good. Funnybot had 1 semi-funny joke but this one has plenty. the wedding comments are brilliant, mr macee was awesome and it was great to see Scot and Ugly Bob again. 
Looking forward to the new episode."
,yamaraja77,2011-05-14T07:11Z,"I have used Filestube, filesonic and other stuff to downlosd this episode, but failed. They stop in the middle. But this torrent was awesome!!! believe me there is nothing wrong in this torrent, its working fine. nice quality as well.

Thank you for uploading this"
,DarthExile,2011-05-15T00:28Z,stfu its still funny even if no one gets the chosen one jokes come on princes william bites off kates arm and then shoves it up his ass
,tuggtugger2,2011-05-15T08:44Z,"rips off her arm

,bannoura1,2011-05-16T19:45Z,"stupid EP, this season is been shit so far"
,cx420ns,2011-05-20T22:48Z,You people are crazy this episode was great. I guess you guys opened your Box of Faith early and ruined the surprise
,Jay2him,2011-06-10T21:38Z,"EZTV! everything i search for, you have it. i love you. you are brilliant!"
