Its crazy they cancelled this series, it was one of the most popular TV series on TPB and on a lot of other torrent sites too, every episode getting 15'000+ leeches within hours of its upload!
I never even liked any of the Stargate's series until this one lol. Gonna miss it big time now :-(

,Sattori,2011-05-10T19:09Z,All those decision makers at Syfy suck. Talent and commitment can hit them straight into their faces and they won't see it. RIP Stargate Universe.
,Sattori,2011-05-10T19:37Z,"Woud be interesting to know if donations from the fans would have kept it alive (like the VODO series which are exclusively funded by donations). Don't know though how much one episode SGU costs, probably too much for private funding."
