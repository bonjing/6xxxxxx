The eighth season of NCIS premiered on September 21, 2010 in the same time slot as the previous season and the second season of NCIS: Los Angeles premiered afterwards.[1] The season story arc involved Ziva's largely unseen boyfriend, Ray, and the CIA continuing to meddle in NCIS's day-to-day workings. Notable events included the terrorism and internal affairs threat during the Enemies two-parter, and the arrival of another MCRT from Rota, Spain, the team that Tony was offered to be lead of in the beginning of season 3. The season ended on a five part story arc involving the Port-to-Port killer that menaced both teams. The finale airs on May 17th.
