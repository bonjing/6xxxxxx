,IslandChuckie,2011-05-11T16:40Z,"I have BitDefender Total, and it won't let me install the crack. Any ideas for me to get around that? BTW thanks for all your uploads."

Does anyone know how to fix this?"
,about37mexicans,2011-05-11T18:27Z,"Still cant figure out how to use the crack ]: just cant get past the serial key part. Even tried using keygens, but that was a fail.. Someone please help on what to do with the crack?"

[T],PirateBoy,2011-05-12T09:02Z,"@ extremezone

Well, i may sound a bit stupid, but i don't know that's why i wanna ask you...Where do you get all these games from???"
,reyanother,2011-05-12T14:01Z,"hhmmm... I can't see the  crack, where is it. i mounted the iso then it created a folder for the game and when i click the faery.exe it asks for a serial. i searched for the crack but i can't see it. where is it located? help please ^^"
,reyanother,2011-05-12T14:04Z,found the crack! I never knew it was in the .iso file. gonna try it now.
,Falstyr,2011-05-12T19:48Z,AVG gives the message that the faery.exe contains a virus. anyone have that file without a virus in it?
,karkar99,2011-05-13T11:59Z,maybe its false alarm dude 
,Nerd4ever,2011-05-13T14:43Z,"Works great on my Win7 machine. Just disabled the false alarm from my anti-virus.

Thanks for the upload mate."
,Felix-Cat,2011-05-14T02:03Z,"I did what @matimike did and added the crack to bit defenders exception list.I started playing and everything went great, untill I meet Aziel on the beach and after defeating the goblins head to the dragons cave.When I press enter at the caves entrance the loading window shows up but the game never loads and I have to force exit the game.
Any help would be appreciated.
And thanks for the upload @extremezone"
,Stickans,2011-05-14T12:28Z,I discovered that AVG is removing the exe file in the 'identity protection' section. There you can exlude it.
,Stickans,2011-05-14T12:36Z,"This 'error' shows even in the retail version.
I discovered that AVG is removing the exe file in the 'identity protection' section. There you can exlude it."
,zxD347Hxz,2011-05-15T05:50Z,"AVG always gives false positives cause it's a garbage virus detector. If you want a better virus scanner, use avast, it actually works unlike AVG. But anyways, I scanned the .exe with several of mine and it came up clean, runs fine. Okay game, not really my thing."
,xbnrxout,2011-05-16T08:05Z,I cannot figure out what to do after i get to the screen that says enter product code can someone help me!!
,Felix-Cat,2011-05-16T17:01Z,"@xbnrxout
Probably it's because you haven't installed the crack.
Anyway, The game freezes when entering portals. Does anybody else have the same problem?"
,dasmit27,2011-05-17T18:40Z,Bit Defender detected virus.
,rdee,2011-05-17T18:48Z,I mounted the iso and installed the game.. Where's the crack?
,Felix-Cat,2011-05-18T03:50Z,"@rdee
Explore the virtual drive that you mounted your iso on, you'll find the CRACK folder there."
,Felix-Cat,2011-05-18T04:04Z,"@rdee
Explore the virtual drive that you mounted your iso on, you'll find the CRACK folder inside the iso."
,fjfds,2011-05-18T07:02Z,"Im getting an installation error with the file c:\...\packs\datapco.spk     It says the source file is corrupted. If i choose to ignore it the installation completes and when I open the game I get stuck on the loading screen, with the walking gnome.... havnt found anything on this issue yet"
,Felix-Cat,2011-05-18T14:12Z,"I beat the game already! It was loads of fun but very short,only three mirrors were restored.And it said ""To Be Continued"" so there must be a sequel in the making."
,Ears14U,2011-06-26T04:41Z,"AVG is a pain in the ass sometimes people. Like Stickans was commenting on, you really need to disable not only your ""identity protection"" section, but make sure ""Resident Shield"" is disabled also. Now this is for ALL installs of torrents period! I'll tell you another that ""I"" had the same shit with...and that's ""Brink"". You can waste time trying to download from another site, believing the torrent is ""corrupted"". Chances are it's not, and the Heuristics for the ""crack"" files are not a shitty ""Trojan"" or ""Virus"" either. Pirates treat their Torrent files just like they do their food! Usually people don't fuck with it...So relax you fuckin' newbs.....lol."
,acruzado,2011-07-13T06:15Z,so only played for a little bit and already lovin this game \(^-^)/
,dariadays,2011-07-29T02:41Z,I was wondering if anyone else was having trouble after character creation the game crashes. I have already fixed the game so that avg doesn't think it's a virus but it still crashes after character creation any ideas
,Akkierra,2011-09-11T01:16Z,"Okay, downloaded fine, no viral content opened and everything, but this is the first game i have ever downloaded. I found the crack file folder easy enough, however i have no idea how to open it. Can someone link me to what ihave to DL to open a .dll file? Or tell me what i have to do to run it with the setup?"
,Caldrumr,2011-10-27T09:20Z,"The game downloads fine, and the crack works fine.  Unfortunately, it crashes on character creation, so it's not actually playable."
,Kayla7x,2012-05-19T14:28Z,"Hey guys, I seen a lot of people having issues with the crack, or don't know how to use the crack. I ran across this image to help you guys out.

If you're having a hard time finding the actual files to the game, go to computer> OS C: > Program Files > Faery Legends of Avalon
This is where you will copy the file in the ""crack"" folder, (in this torrent) and replace it in the Faery Legends of Avalon folder."
