,Atsaluum,2011-06-05T14:42Z,"Hard coded subs sucks ass. The CHD 1080p remux/encode release also include those. I wonder if it's in the BD release itself. When the movie itself is not in English, I prefer subs in my native language. Also the placing and coloring for these hard coded's are dead wrong."
,askanioff,2011-07-05T08:35Z,I think there is not yet any clean version of this film all of them have the hard coded crap
,AlfNader,2011-09-25T22:31Z,"Atsaluum: The blu-ray itself did in fact have hardcoded subs, so the release group isn't to blame for them.
