,Rando_q1,2011-05-13T12:31Z,ingame before patch with 4870x2 fps was like 30-50... now its on same track 55-60(vsync) crossfire works perfectly forcing afr-friendly d3d with radeonpro. no flickering occurs and handling is way way much better:) seems like graphics are improved too... so happy gaming nfs fanboys:P
,kajosin,2011-05-13T16:31Z,"grr i dont see any changes with this crack, i still have input lag (360 controller) and no fps boost"
,Rando_q1,2011-05-13T17:08Z,"wtf?

,kajosin,2011-05-13T17:29Z,"i installed the reloaded's shift 2 (without crack), then i install the 1.01 patch and i use this crack. i have no idea why not change anything"
,mwelwa,2011-05-15T14:56Z,are we supposed to patch on original installation or on this crack
,Raiyus13,2011-05-16T09:07Z,"@mwelwa

You need to apply the patch on a fresh installation, and then apply this crack"
,AsssKisser666,2011-05-25T18:36Z,"Cracks works, but after the intro movies the game crashes?? So something isnt right?"
,Ultimrace,2011-07-02T10:23Z,Rando Q1 create  please crack for DLC patch  NFS Shift 2 ....
,BortaMaga,2011-08-15T00:14Z,how to make a game crack (not download)?
,mwelwa,2011-09-10T14:23Z,no seeds cant download:(
,Rando_q1,2011-09-28T23:02Z,if you even dont know how to make a crack for a game then its too hard for you...... and guy's i really dont have no more time for piratebay.... because im working hard... maybe some bf3 updates and the run cracks:P
,evrythgzen,2012-03-21T19:13Z,"Trojan!  Don't pay any attention to anyone saying it's a ""false positive."" It knocked-out avast! & microsoft security essentials after a reboot, causes Win7x64 to hang for about an hour during boot, and fucks-up a bunch of .dlls.  I tried it on several VMs and avast!, avira, & comodo missed it.  MSE & kaspersky caught it though, and both say it's Obfuscator.XZ. (Yes, I know what that is & that it can have legitimate uses.  Not in this case, though.)  Just trying to warn everyone.  Unless you really want to wipe your HDDs & re-install, leave this one alone & keep Shift2 un-updated.  If you think I'm lying, go ahead and get it.  I don't care. Enjoy the mess this will make of your PC.  To everyone that installed it & thinks there are no problems, I'd just go ahead & wipe my HDDs if I were you.  I haven't had a chance to really dig into what this does yet, but whatever it is, it's nothing good."
,Rando_q1,2012-03-23T20:13Z,causes Win7x64 to hang for about an hour during boot???? wtf???? still no problems here... crack made by ali213.....
