Also pls note, This is Animated, not live action"
,wizzkid1970,2011-05-12T09:02Z,why is it every fucking time some person uploads new movie some dickhead confuses fucking everyone else by uploading something with a similar name in cartoon quality?

@wizzkid1970 - Read before you make expletive comments."
[T],despo1ler,2011-05-22T14:11Z,"@wizzkid1970, I was just the 1st person to upload this, there are loads of different rips of it out now, and the reason ppl upload cartoons when a similar title RL movie is making the rounds is because that is when the cartoon is released, what do you want us to do, just not upload the cartoon because you might get confused?!?
I think the title is clear enough, anyway, that this is not the Thor movie in cinemas at the moment, if it was just called ""Thor"" you might have a reason to complain but as it is all you have done is show yourself up."
