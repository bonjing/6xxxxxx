to verify it's integrity....if it checks out, then you can guess that any marked threat by an antivirus would be a false positive, as ""Hiren"" is a trusted source,

Tell the folks what you did to it astuz?
Yes, there are many NOOBS out there, 
so it's our job to help them out so we don't have to deal with as many NOOBS.
Remember, a little time spent logically checking things out helps to avoid future problems."
