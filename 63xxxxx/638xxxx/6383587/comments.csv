,xdfgvfh,2011-10-09T04:53Z,"Plays fine on VLC or with CCCP in a DirectShow player (even WMP). To anyone still burning dvd's: buy $15 HDMI cable, plug one end into video card, plug other end into tv, buy $20 wireless kb/mouse, put wireless kb/mouse on coffee table, watch anything you want, whenever you want without freaking out over dvd's."

You are totally wrong.

For a couple of years now, MP4 and MKV have become the standard for video files - I wouldn't touch an AVI file with a bargepole now.  

They will play on practically any media player.  You are not restricted to VLC!  If you can't play it on your media player, that is probably only becauase you don't have the necessary codecs installed.

As for being unable to burn the file to a DVD, that is nonsense.  Convert the file to DVD format first - as you would do with any other media file such as AVI - and it will burn fine.

Why bother though?  Burning to a DVD is a completely pointless exercise and defeats the purpose - quite apart from the fact that you will dilute the quality of the video.

Do yourself a favour.  Crawl out of the dark ages and connect your TV to your PC, laptop or portable hard drive etc so you can watch videos like these in glorious quality far better than DVD.

No disrespect intended, but you should get your facts straight before being so wrongly critical of an uploader's efforts."
