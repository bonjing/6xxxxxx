Hi there..


Jonathan Gray's latest book.


In this one he sums up so much actual knowledge and explain so many things, it should be mandatory reading for those that wonder about anything from the Great Deluge to the real meaning of star-signs, the Exodus, the Ark of the Covenant, the love of Christ.. I could go on and on..

It's the kind of book you don't really want to quit reading until you're on page "the end".


I wrote Br. Gray about torrents and sharing his material that way, and I received this answer [selection]:

"..It is the e-books that supply most of our profits for carrying out our
charitable work.

I trust you understand.

However, "The Forbidden Secret" is the result of two years' labour
of love to get something completed that will be adequate on its own
to supply the saving knowledge to anyone who honestly wants to
know the truth. We are taking no profit from that book.

You can share it with every unbeliever you wish, on the Internet or in
very other way you desire.

I wish you you many blessings as you do this.

Best regards
Jonathan."

So, with that I present to you this completely mindblowing book.. ;-)

"Personally I've found the hope of deliverance and enlightenment through Yeshua Ha'Mashiach to be the greatest mystery and riddle, shrouded in the shadows of shame, but revealed to those who seek the Truth, no matter the cost."
