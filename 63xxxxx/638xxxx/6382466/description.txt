Description: Evidence-based practice is becoming an increasingly important topic in physical therapy clinical practice, especially as the cost of health care continues to accelerate. As a result, evidence is now being incorporated into all aspects of physical therapy patient/client management including examination, evaluation, diagnosis, prognosis, and intervention. Designed as a handy, quick-reference guide, ORTHOPAEDIC CLINICAL EXAMINATION: AN EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH FOR PHYSICAL THERAPISTS takes a uniquely visual, evidence-tables approach to make it easy for clinicians to locate relevant evidence of the diagnostic utility of commonly utilized tests and measures.

 * Features 281 evidence-tables with essential information clinicians need to make appropriate decisions on clinical tests for their patients.
 * Provides information specific to the diagnostic accuracy of specific tests ... measures that have been investigated in controlled studies ... and each test's sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios. In addition, each table offers an easy-to-follow guide to the performance and scoring of every test and measure.
 * Offers information on the patient population and reference standard that was utilized in the corresponding study, with an overview of the study results and their applicability to the clinician's environment.
 * Includes 169 Netter and Netter-style images and 173 photographs assure that clinicians have an understanding of the relative anatomy, arthrology, myology, and neurology behind the examination process.
