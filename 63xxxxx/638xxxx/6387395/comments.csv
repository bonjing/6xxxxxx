Under: 

Defaultmode= W1280 H720 F60

try W1024 H768 F70, at least it made my day a bit brighter ;) cheers fellow gamers and thanks Stun for another great game!"

How do you get these games?
Do you actually buy these games and crack them and upload them?
Its a great ""Pre-Buy-Test"" anyway THANKS!"
