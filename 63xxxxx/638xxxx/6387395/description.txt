 Game Notes:





National Geographic Challenge comes with the imprimatur of one of the

world s oldest and most respected scientific publications in a bid to

make planetary exploration both educational and fun.



On the video game side, the game was developed by Gusto Games (which

put together John Daly's ProStroke Golf, among others) which has

managed to create a gaming experience that also makes use of the

massive video and knowledge libraries of National Geographic

magazine.



National Geographic Challenge features both single player and

multiplayer Quiz games to test and grow the players  knowledge of

their world. It also comes with a competitive two-player Puzzle

Battle to pit wits.



For the younger player (and maybe the more mature) there are also

richly detailed Jigsaws to complete. This features alongside a set of

puzzle-form mini-games.



At the heart of the experience is  Explorer mode  in which up to four

players compete to claim territories on the planet. Unlike Risk

however, this global domination is achieved by correctly answering

questions as well as competing in the puzzle based mini-games.
