Inpatient units treat some of the most difficult psychiatric patients. This compact clinical manual is convenient for use on the ward and serves as a standard guide for treatment, addressing the common questions and issues that clinicians face in day-to-day psychiatric work with this challenging patient group. Chapters are organised around the diagnoses found on inpatient psychiatric units, with additional chapters addressing documentation and the care of young adult inpatients. Charts, tables and clinical hints amplify the text, allowing practising clinicians to find the information they need quickly and easily, and enabling students to master the field for board and end-of-clerkship exams. This practical manual is essential reading for practising psychiatrists, psychiatric residents and all psychiatric educators, as well as serving as an accessible reference for physicians in other specialties who consult on the psychiatric ward, psychiatric nurses and medical students.
