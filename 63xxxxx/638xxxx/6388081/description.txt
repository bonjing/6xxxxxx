Eric Le Van: piano

If there is any recording of these pieces you should have, this is the one. Sheer magic under Le Van's hands, these performances are utterly heart-wrenching. Le Van is a master of nuance and inflection, indispensable to a great Scriabin performance. Here one finds an all-too-rare understanding of Scriabin's unique multifarious sound-world, and the interpreter milks these long-neglected gems for all of their poetry and emotional urgency. Compared to this version of the Mazurkas, all others sound pedestrian, with the exception of Samuel Feinberg; but Feinberg only recorded a selection from op.3, whereas here you have the whole set. This is an absolutely must for any record collection.
