Sometime in late 2005, Ross Ballard approached me with the idea of using my music for the background of his audio book, â€œCrumâ€, the novel by Lee Maynard. This kind of project was a first for me and I was intrigued. It sounded like it would be fun. I had no earthly idea. Ross gave me a copy of the book and I was stunned. It was simply brilliant. Yes, itâ€™s crude, sexist, bawdy, and crass. But itâ€™s arguably the best coming-of-age novel ever written about growing up as a lower class country boy. Itâ€™s especially piquant if one is from the South, or anywhere else in the backwoods of America. â€œCrumâ€, though a novel, is the truth, nothing but the unadulterated truth.

I wrote two tunes specifically for the project and had several previously unrecorded pieces that seemed to fit the timbre of the book, that being a mixture of melancholy, glee, hope, introspection, and potential catharsis. We recorded them all on a cool November day in 2006, and I could sense that Ross, Donnie, and I, shared the same feeling â€“ that we were onto something special. But that special nature had little to do with me. The three of us were merely latecomers, lucky enough to hitch a ride on a phenomenal literary train, a work of dazzling (if off-colored) truth. Iâ€™m honored to be a part of it, even if only vicariously. Thanks Ross; thanks Donnie; and most of all, thank you Mr. Maynard for chronicling my (and many othersâ€™) adolescence."
