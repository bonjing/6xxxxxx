The other day they stopped seeding a torrent when everyone was at 99.9%. What I have done in the past is take what I have and get the rest somewhere else. If it is all possible I would wait for TvTeam to release whatever it is you are after."
[T],jerry7_57,2011-05-11T00:32Z,I Just picked up the rest of this torrent somewhere else so now I am going to clear everyone that has been waiting all day for this.
