Plot:Moving between a local microcosm and the global oil crisis, H2Oil weaves together
a collection of compelling stories of people who are at the front lines of the
biggest industrial project in human history: Canada's tar sands. H2Oil is a 
feature-length documentary that traces the wavering balance between the
urgent need to protect and preserve fresh water resources and the mad
clamoring to fill the global demand for oil. It is a film that asks: what is more
important, water or oil? Will the quest for profit overshadow efforts to protect
public health and the environment in Canada's richest province?
