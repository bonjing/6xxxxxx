Okay here is our cam for jumping the broom video was pretty decent slightly dark and colors needed adjustment,added a rgb,slight sharpen,denoiser other usual video filters

now for the READ NFO PART the first 11 mins has some shaking i cropped some out but not really worth me spending so much time on for 11 minutes,take out 3 to 4 mins
of opening credits and you have about 7 minutes of shaking after that it's all good.

On to audio pretty decent cam audio slight drop in goldwave to remove a slight noise and volume adjustment all in all very watchable imo but to each his own

I am including 2 samples one regular and one that shows the shaking for the first 11 minutes so if you are a quality whore you have been forewarned

Enjoy
