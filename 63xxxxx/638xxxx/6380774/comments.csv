,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-01-05T22:28Z,"What I can't understand is why people insist on uploading albums that have already been uploaded at least 30+ times already...

We don't need any more uploads of:

Nirvana - Nevermind
Pink Floyd - Dark Side Of The Moon
AC/DC - Back In Black
Led Zeppelin - IV
Metallica - The Black Album

For fuck's sakes let's get some new content!!"
