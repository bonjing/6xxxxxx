Rotterdam, Holland 1996
Date: 96-12-10
Venue: Sportspaleis Aho'y

Recording: AUD
Quality: 7(+)
Menu: YES
Extras: None
Comments: Single cam high on the balcony, extreme right. The shooting is shaky and a lot of times it's poorly cropped (I don't care to see that much of the lighting rig, thank you). Mostly wide and medium-range shots, closeups are really shaky for the most part. Picture quality is OK but with a lot of grain. Audio is distant and a little muffled but fairly good.
