Pretty tomboy Kim Matthews, 19, used to be a champion skateboarder -
but now she's stuck in a dead end job trying to support her Dad.
Opportunity comes knocking in the form of a catering job in the one of the most
exclusive chalets in the Alps. At first, Kim's baffled by this bizarre new 
world of posh people, champagne and skiing - but then she discovers snowboarding,
and the chance to win some much-needed prize money at the big end-of-season
competition. But before she can become a champion again, Kim's going to have to
dig deep to overcome her fears. Hard enough, without the complicating factor of
Jonny, her handsome - though spoken for - boss...
