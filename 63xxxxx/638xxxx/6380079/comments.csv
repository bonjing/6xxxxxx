Still it didn't cause a big deal with watching z movie - there are only one part that between 9:46 and 10:03 (17 seconds) is gettin' skipped, that's all. Besides that video quality is great, 2 audio tracks - cantonese (OG) and mandarin, eng subtitles needs to be timed out all throughout z whole movie, back and forward =J That's z biggest problem =] Will seed.. 8)"
