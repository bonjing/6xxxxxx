"Chuck Versus The Last Details" 

Chuck (Zachary Levi) and Sarah's 
(Yvonne Strahovski) wedding prep 
includes one final detail: ensuring 
that the mother-of-the-groom (guest 
star Linda Hamilton) makes it to the 
ceremony alive. Meanwhile, Morgan's 
(Joshua Gomez) responsibilities as 
Best Man include his most dangerous 
mission yet, as he faces Vivian 
Volkoff (guest star Lauren Cohan). 
Elsewhere, Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) 
tends to the last details of the 
rehearsal dinner and seeks help from 
an unlikely source.

Enjoy :)
