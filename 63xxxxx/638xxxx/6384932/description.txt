PLOT:
Pretty tomboy Kim Matthews, 19, used to be a champion skateboarder 
- but now she's stuck in a dead end job trying to support her Dad. 
Opportunity comes knocking in the form of a catering job in the one 
of the most exclusive chalets in the Alps. At first, Kim's baffled 
by this bizarre new world of posh people, champagne and skiing - 
but then she discovers snowboarding, and the chance to win some 
much-needed prize money at the big end-of-season competition. 
But before she can become a champion again, Kim's going to have to 
dig deep to overcome her fears.
