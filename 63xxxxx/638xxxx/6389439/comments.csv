You're gonna wish you had been there after listening to this scorching live set from the '80s. It features the blues singing of Little Milton superbly accompanied by Lucky Peterson, who distinguishes himself on the organ, and the Tony Brown Band. This CD is a combination of two concerts recorded separately in a single day -- one for men, one for women, in 1983. Milton does none of his big hits, which doesn't seem to bother the captive crowd, most of whom probably didn't know them anyway. Highlights include an emotional reworking of O. V. Wright's ""Eight Men, Four Women,"" a 16-minute medley of soul and blues songs, and the deep soul classic ""That's How Strong My Love Is."" Milton really gets into it for the women. He coughs up two smoldering original compositions ""Friend of Mine,"" and ""Loving You Is the Best Thing That Happened to Me."" The most surprising thing about Live at Westville Prison is why it took so long to surface on CD."
