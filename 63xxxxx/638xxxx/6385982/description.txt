Outrageous skate video introduced the world to Bam Margera, the insane, parent hassling daredevil that would gain fame for risking life and limb on MTV's Jackass series. Includes a very chaotic trip to Iceland, some rather disgusting fecal footage, a some furniture surfing on the highway, and a demonstration of how to destroy a rental car and get off scott free.
