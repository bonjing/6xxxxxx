,shesashairy,2012-02-08T12:52Z,Thanks! The greatest Reggae Culture movie ever made. As a white bloke who used to have dreads and get persecuted for my way of life I see this movie from a double perspective. In reality though very few white folk have suffered the oppression that the Afro Caribbean community withstood. Wherever we  may be our hearts are on the frontline.
