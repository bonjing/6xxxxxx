There's just no pleasing some people..:)

@ allswelles 

You burnt a preview to DVD get a life.. it's on Saturday don't panic"
[V],catflap,2011-05-14T21:25Z,"160MB for less than 9 minutes is
ridiculous, unnecessary and a waste.

it looks excellent on my HD laptop, HD 3D BD player and my HD 3D tv, as well as my regular
dvd HDD recorders, all of which play xvid.

if you have to convert every avi file to dvd
because your dvd player can't play
xvid files, buy one that can.

it's not my problem."
