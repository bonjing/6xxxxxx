,myhandle,2011-05-12T03:57Z,So what is PhoenixRG? The other ripper seems to be doing higher bitrate rips with 6 channel audio. You are doing tiny rips with 48kbps stereo audio (which is insufferable; you should at least bump it to 96kbps). Doesn't seem like you have much in common?

[T],MitZep,2011-05-12T12:31Z,"@all welcome!!! :)

@myhandle we encode with various styles to meet everyone's need,, if yu dnt like the enoding, then don't download...
abt the bit rate, i use 48kbps with he aac 2 + ps..
the ps i.e parametric stereo is used for low bit rates which gives quality almost equivalent to 128 kbps aac...
so if yu dnt like it, i can't help you, srry.."
