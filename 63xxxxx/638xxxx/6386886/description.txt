Artist: David Ackles
Title: Subway To The Country
Genre: Folk Rock
Origin: US

This is David Ackles' excellent third album (according to AMG...I thought it was only his second?) from 1970, issued on CD by Elektra/Collectors' Choice Music in 2002.

Even after his death from cancer in 1999, David Ackles continues to influence contemporary singer/songwriters with his combination of dark and desolate lyrics, emotionally wrenching songs, and subtle, sonorous delivery. Singers like Elvis Costello have acknowledged a creative debt to him, and his albums, especially American Gothic, have become cult favorites. --- Subway to the Country is not the classic that American Gothic is, but it remains a fine testament to Ackles' truly awesome poetic power as both a writer and a singer.
