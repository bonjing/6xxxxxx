btw the actual beta version of vlc 1.2.0-git seems have been stopped
and i dunno exactly why yet.
This does not forcibly mean a bad news by far as well...
I will try to let you know why asap...
ty for understanding !
and many thanks to all ppls who still continue to trust in me here on tpb.
because i'm not a fucker and i never try to inject or hide any virus in any file of my torrents.
All i seed with you is always untouched,unmodified and never hide any virus that
few morons try to let you believe here.Probably jalous or stupid guys or extra paranoid guys as well few of them seem extremely racist and injurious...
sad ! very sad and pretty disappointing...
Beware and take really care then...
We are all free to decide to download and seeding here on tpb
But you are still free to decide and choose what you want.
We never force you to download our torrents.
we propose--->you decide ! for ever and ever so !
