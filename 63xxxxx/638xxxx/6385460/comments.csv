,outraged2010,2011-05-12T23:19Z,but it only go's up to vlc 1.1.9 iv tryed searching for update and that it says i have the latist version at 1.1.9 so sorri man
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-05-13T02:05Z,"ok bro,i can forgive you !
Well you know,
you cannot get this version if you have already installed the official vlc 1.1.9 final cause the one i seed here is not official yet but stay avalaible to public for all ppl for testing purpose then.
And if you are intelligent,you can even find it quite easily by a search from google...
This comes from the continuous nightly builds branch section and is still as beta version.
So don't be troubled or confused so.
I'v just renamed it with branch,date and last version of the day to let you know all about.
simply all ! :)
anyway this is a real version and therefore it is definitivelty not a fake,dude.
as usual still untouched,original and delivered such as then.
peace and love mate
regards"
