So I right click and go to open file location. When I try to extract the files, the extract box comes up and I click ok, but then a 7-zip diagnostic box pops up and says this ""can not open file C:\Users\etc..."" and it lists the file. I don't know what to do. Please help me. Thanks."

,akshay101,2011-09-03T16:08Z,"What is OpenCandy? 

OpenCandy is a platform and network which enables software publishers 
to recommend other products, during installation of their software, they 
believe you will find valuable. 

Soâ€¦ What is this folder, its contents, and why is it here? 

These files are only on your computer because you accepted a software 
recommendation. These files are TEMPORARILY copied to a folder within 
the publisher's program files directory until the recommended software 
is downloaded and installation is performed. 

This folder contains: 

  * OpenCandy_Why_Is_This_Here.txt
    - This text file youâ€™re reading. :) 

  * OCSetupHlp.dll
    - This file is used to display a recommendation during the 
      publisherâ€™s software installation and to facilitate the download 
      and installation of the recommended software. This file also 
      allows us to provide software publishers with *non personally 
      identifiable* information such as statistics like install 
      initiated and completed, country, operating system and language, 
      and whether the software recommendation was accepted or not. 

Once the recommended softwareâ€™s installation is started (and regardless 
of whether it is successfully completed) these files and the 'OpenCandy' 
folder will be automatically deleted. 

The possible reasons this folder and its contents remain are: 

  A) You rebooted before installing the recommend software
  B) You lost power before the recommended software was installed
  C) Your computer exploded before the recommended software was 
  installed (Then how are you reading this?) 

Feel free to delete this OpenCandy folder (and its contents) at any 
time; there is no harm in doing so. If you believe this folder and its 
files should have been deleted and were not (and neither A, B, or C 
happened), we'd appreciate if you contacted us (see below) and told us 
what you think happened. If it happens to be a bug, we'll fix it so this 
doesn't happen to anyone else. Oh yeah, and we'll send you an awesome 
purple t-shirt for helping us out! 

If you have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us at 
www.opencandy.com/contact/. 

Thank you. 

- The OpenCandy team"

,tfsp22,2011-10-16T03:41Z,"NEED HELP
i downloaded the torrent and installed the fl studio 10 demo in the folder and launched it. then i first tried closing it and launching the crack; then i left the fl studios open and launched the crack, but nothing happened when the cracked finished. it was still the demo version. and also once i close fl studios its just gone, and i have to install it again.
please HELP"
,Oiiii,2011-11-01T21:01Z,"Nice1 for this. Just wondering though.. How come that ""new stuff"" that loads up when you first load it up doesn't play right for me? It sounds all distorted and laggy? Does anybody else get that?"
,slammer381,2011-11-02T17:26Z,"can someone please explain to me why people fail at installing this...? 
works great! tnx seeding..."
,gts2550,2011-11-11T11:35Z,"@hackster117 since you didn't quote the whole error message, I can only guess 2 possible reasons: 

1)Your downloaded file might be corrupted (deleting the data and re-downloading it should fix it)
2)This is actually weird but happened to me more than once, so not to count this one out; if the file name consists of quite a few characters (i.e. it has a huge filename) it might exceed the permitted character use for naming a folder in your os, thus won't letting you extract it. You should be able to change the soon-to-be-extracted folder name to a shorter one to get around it."
,SebasstijanDJ,2011-11-22T21:38Z,Great! Thanks!

,02KingGriz02,2012-01-03T11:48Z,"I'm new to downloading programs. So if you could e-mail me back or comment with some detailed instructions, that would be awesome. My e-mail is christian_johnson02@hotmail.com Thank you. "
,the00negative,2012-01-28T04:25Z,"Excellent torrent, worked with no problems whatsoever. vAin4us made it so easy all it is is click and install. nothing else. Thanks so much man. I screwed up when I bought the fruity edition, this is the one that I wanted."
,blankb,2012-02-08T06:00Z,"Once I finished the download, bitorrent told me that this torrent contained harmful files. Although I scanned the files with MSS and MBAM, I'm still cautious to try these..."

1) Uninstall previous FL

3) Move crack into the FL folder and run it
4) Slap your grandma
5) Enjoy!!!!"
,xXCorpseGrinderXx,2012-03-16T07:46Z,"Does this work under Win7 64-bit ? If not, can you upload the FL Studio 11 ?
(I had the FL11 but ... had to format, see how bad it is ?! no ? ok... that's ok! :)
Either way, I'm pretty much screwed but ... could be worst!"

,kaizeran,2012-04-02T08:44Z,"@Oiiii  It's probably Just too much for your computer hardware not able to keep up. A lot of people don't realize that when your running that many channels it's a pretty big hit on your resources. I believe Fruity Loops has a monitor so you can see that status of your CPU and ram and all that. 

All that Aside. Great Upload Thanks vAin4us"
,Snowwie888,2012-04-13T03:45Z,"This torrent is perfect, no problems with it all.
Downloading, installing, executing the crack, Avira Anti-Virus did not protest. Program works like a charm. Good torrent."
,afryan,2012-04-20T01:15Z,works great!!
,fould12,2012-04-29T06:36Z,"@Oiiii
That's because you need a more powerful CPU, it happens with me too. You need a VERY powerful PC."
,QuaintBelial,2012-05-03T05:39Z,"Thanks, works beautifully! "
,Mancunian10,2012-06-17T23:05Z,"@ Oiii

""How come that ""new stuff"" that loads up when you first load it up doesn't play right for me? It sounds all distorted and laggy? Does anybody else get that?""

You have to go to your sound settings and adjust the delay of the sound. If you put more delay your cpu will have less trouble playing it and it will come out smooth."
,cityndn,2012-06-19T16:52Z,works perfectly!! thanks for this!!
