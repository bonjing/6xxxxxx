Basil Kirchin's two experimental LPs from 1971 and 1973, both titled Worlds Within Worlds, have long been out of print and near impossible to track down. Quantum, recorded in 1973 and not released until 30 years later, offers another glimpse at Kirchin's oeuvre of sonic weirdness, which borrows from free jazz, musique concrÃ¨te, and a lot of other things for something quite undefinable.
