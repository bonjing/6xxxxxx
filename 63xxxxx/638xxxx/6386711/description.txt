In this book, Swedish grandmaster Tiger Hillarp Persson presents his own favourite defence against 1.e4, the Modern Defence with a6. With his trademark laid-back approach, he explains the different White replies to his system. His repertoire is based on deep understanding, common themes, and interesting games, rather than simply theory to be memorised. Pieces are sacrificed in a great number of games and famous grandmasters meet their doom on the pages of this refreshingly lively opening book. In today\'s chess teaching, opening theory often reaches deep into the middlegame, and players struggle to create something new and inspiring at the chessboard. Here, Tiger Hillarp Persson shows that it is possible to be original at an early stage.
