,AdamB1924,2011-05-11T22:18Z,"I've tried to uninstall and reinstall a couple of times now but this Update/Fix still doesn't get the game to start. 
I'm not saying it wont make a difference for you guys but for me it doesn't.

Really awesome quick service you, Mbb15/Crackers, have though, keep up the great work! Cheers!"

,Kasseopea,2011-05-11T22:30Z,"Doesnt fix anything, thx"
,jls_14,2011-05-11T22:36Z,Same here. Im running on win 7 x64 and even with this update the game keeps crashing on startup!!! Mbb15 do u know whats the problem?
,thehatsoff,2011-05-11T22:39Z,after patching and updating i still have issues with particle effects looking like either blue or black squares.. really takes stuff away from the game =(
,Kasseopea,2011-05-11T22:42Z,"i guess it isnt the fault of skidrow, seems like the uncracked version was made shitty"
,thehatsoff,2011-05-11T22:51Z,"ive uninstalled and re installed about 6 times already and done the entire process a couple times.. i still have issues with the particle effects and the crosshairs, minimap and other HUD  features being cut in half. the game installed fine and runs smooth other than that, its just i cant stress how annoying it is when dust in your face is just a black square that you cant see through. thanks anyways for the hard work Mbb15 hope you guys can fix it proper =)"
,GrimMaggot,2011-05-12T02:13Z,"Grrr...this needs to get fixed soon, i don't wanna spend 50$ on a crappy game, i wanna play it some first!"
,johnniebrasco,2011-05-12T03:43Z,"I'm running it in win7 x64 with no problems, did you make sure to install directx and vcredist from the install folder? But I do think this is best when playing in teams with voip, and for that you have to buy it."
,johnniebrasco,2011-05-12T03:44Z,"Btw, thank you mbb15! You rock!!"
,sthlm080808,2011-05-12T08:58Z,Thanks Mbb15! the game works flawless =) running W7X86 without any problems.. make sure to have the latest drivers for graphics and such things.. and install vcredist and directx! 
,SuXeS,2011-05-12T11:22Z,I've got a problem with no sound in any of the cinematics. Anyone else got this problem? Anyone care to share what this update does exactly?
,YeOldeSnake,2011-05-12T12:12Z,"Starting the game from steam is the reason it crashes , just launch it off your desktop.
It crashes ingame while playing due to some rendering errors though , and it happens randomly in-missions"
,Marcvss,2011-05-12T12:30Z,Followed the instructions... Still can't get it installed. Advice anyone?

,macfly59,2011-05-12T18:51Z,"thanks but error

warning

AppID is not configured  wtf !!!!"
,nexus856,2011-05-12T20:02Z,"to all people that have problem with this game. all of you try to update your graphic driver!
I had some strange problem where game has minimized the window. i maximized it, after a second it's minimized. after the update no more problems. maybe you need to do the same. "
,jls_14,2011-05-12T20:18Z,can anyone help? is that so hard??? The errors are the same for everybody. We only ask for one person to dedicate 5 mins of their life explaining how the fuck do we get past these errors!!!!!!
,Darksteel165,2011-05-12T20:33Z,"If you read the log inside the download to see what was fixed... They fixed a problem where if you closed the program while starting you would lose you're characters. The game not starting has nothing what-so-ever to do with this crack or the download, simple go onto the steam or official Brink forums and you will see that a ton of people can't even get it to start (mostly ATI graphics users) because of hardware issues."
,hgreezy,2011-05-13T01:31Z,"yo bro(s), if your having trouble google is your friend. Don't hate on the crackers because you are incompetent or have inferior hardware. The torrent is perfect, if your having an error it's an operator error...not the crackers.  If you can't install, run and troubleshoot without someone holding your hand..don't pirate shit.  grow up bitches."
,sage1210,2011-05-13T09:52Z,"this game is no thing but the bugs nest.

crash on steam, error while playing, bad optimizing, sound disappear and malfunction......bah bah bah.

now i think i lucky that not pre-order this game from steam. "
,yelloo,2011-05-13T10:30Z,Thanks Mbb15.
,johnniebrasco,2011-05-13T11:34Z,"hgreezy: I fully agree!! And guys, this is a pirated game... don't start it in steam... You would think everybody got that... There is a dll-file that replaces steam on startup."
,johnniebrasco,2011-05-13T11:35Z,"i have ati btw, no probs with that either"
,Kasseopea,2011-05-13T11:39Z,would anyone finally upload the fckn 1.01 patch?!?
,mokaey,2011-05-13T14:13Z,does this update make the xbox 360 controller work?
,jls_14,2011-05-13T15:15Z,None of the solutions available are good for me. I can play crysis 2 on this pc so i think i can play brink too. So i tried do disable triple force buffering didnt work. run as admin neither. i tried a lot more including installing and unnistalling programs and it didnt work. So can anyone help me please?
,mindkiller1,2011-05-13T20:19Z,trid this one but got  a error concern ap id so i tried the KaOs version and it works great bypasses steam and installs without daemon tools too
[V],Mbb15,2011-05-13T23:22Z,"update 2 is here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6390055/Brink.Update.2-SKIDROW

hope this helps if you still cant play..."
,jls_14,2011-05-14T00:01Z,"Arrgh!! Still doesn t work. Now it gives me another error. ""the current video card doesn t support opengl 3.1 or newer"" and i have updated my drivers!!!!!"
,jls_14,2011-05-14T01:15Z,Ok I got it to work. I went to the nvidia site and downloaded latest version of my nvidia 9600GT. Then I put the settings all to perform better and disabled triple force buffering and it stopped crashing. My specs are way below the minimum and I play the game perfectly anyway!!!! Thank you!!!!
,LordOrwell,2011-05-14T22:30Z,now wait a minute.  You're way BELOW specs and wondering why you've been getting issues?  Please slap yourself.
,BlAdEAnGeL,2011-05-18T02:16Z,"Having problems with installing, I downloaded 2 differet SKIDROW torrents and both fail during set up, anyone can shed light on the issue please. TIA"
