The file HDSentinel.key created by the keygen is corrupt and will not go into the registry.

I have voted you down for this. :-("
,donkeydick121,2011-07-18T18:28Z,My apologies. The key file was not corrupt but it can't be imported to the registry and has to be introduced via the help button. You did not provide this information but it works fine and I will vote you back up again :-)
,donkeydick121,2011-07-18T20:03Z,"I have used v3.50 of this for a long time but it does not support raid arrays. THIS ONE DOES :-)

Excellent!!!

I will vote you up loads.

ps just found out one of my drives is on the way out and as it's on a raid array I wouldn't have known with the previous version so this has saved me a lot of grief :-)"
