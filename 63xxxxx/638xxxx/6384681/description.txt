* Tangible Structure of the Soul.

The \\\\\\\'road-map\\\\\\\' through the contours of multi-dimensional human anatomy, through which the interwoven biological and spiritual aspects of human evolution can be understood and consciously accelerated. The primary objective of this programme is: \\\\\\\"To accelerate the Bio-spiritual Evolution, through expansion of the personal consciousness and integration of the spiritual aspects of Being\\\\\\\". The paradigm of Bio-Spiritual Evolution recognises the intimate connection between the human DNA, multi-dimensional levels of identity and anatomy, and the spiritual integration process. The focus of this programme is to provide practical techniques of bio-energetic mechanics through which the consciousness can expand by integrating the constructs of the multi-dimensional anatomy. You will become acquainted with the basic structure of 15 Dimensional Human Anatomy and the energetic Hova Bodies, which house the multi-dimensional awareness. You will encounter the identity aspects of the Incarnate, the Soul and Archetype, the Over-Soul and Monad, and the Avatar, Rishi, God-self and God-Seed that correspond to this basic anatomy structure.

The Tangible Structure of the Soul course is designed specifically to create a strong energetic alignment between you and your Highest Identity levels so that your expansion of consciousness can proceed unimpeded and your exploration into the frontiers of multi-dimensional being can unfold safely in a gentle manner. It is highly recommended to study this programme in conjunction with the Kathara Bio-Spiritual Healing system. The Tangible Structure course was released before the 12th dimensional Maharic frequency was anchored here on Earth and is therefore an ideal preparatory and supportive step for any newcomer starting to use the \\\\\\\"Maharic Seal\\\\\\\" technique. . It thus begins to build the lower currents all the way up to the eleventh dimension, bringing the frequencies from dimension 4 through to 11 into our bio-field and consciousness. When used in conjunction with the Kathara Bio-Spiritual Healing programme, the Tangible Structure program will greatly amplify the strength of one\\\\\\\'s personal Maharic Seal, the core technique of Kathara Level One.

There are specific techniques and exercises of consciousness that will begin to open the fields of higher consciousness and spiritual enlightenment into the earthly conscious awareness. The techniques are geared towards assisting you to make a conscious connection with these transcendent portions of yourself and towards accelerating the natural bio-energetic processes by which these portions of your awareness can be brought into conscious embodiment. You will learn direct applications of Keylontic Morphogenetic Science, through which you can begin to transform your reality to a higher level of joy by healing and realigning the blueprints of light and sound upon which your manifest reality is built. The techniques are easy to follow and one only needs a rudimentary understanding of the ideas presented within the included lectures, in order to receive the benefits of the Keylontic Science techniques provided.

The Lectures provided on each CD provide a short orientation to the subject matter featured in the technique on the same CD, to assist one in becoming familiar with the concepts and terminology used in the exercises. The 68-page Handbook contains an abridged transcript of all lectures, plus an extensive and detailed glossary of the terms used in this programme. The latter is an extremely valuable reference, with sections on topics such as Ascended Master, Avatar, the Crystal Body, Dimensions, the God-Seed, Kundalini, Merkaba, Miasms, Monad and many other terms, which are used extensively throughout later publications of the Azurite Press. It is thus an indispensable companion for further study, serving to clarify these terms as understood within the paradigm of Keylontic Science. Also included in the Manual is a Summary Charts section which provides helpful diagrams and \\\\\\\'information bites\\\\\\\' related to the Bio-Spiritual Evolution process. It is not necessary to review all the technical information in order to use this programme successfully, since its primary purpose is to establish a strong connection between you and your Levels of Higher Consciousness. However, it is also useful to integrate the mental body in the process of bio-spiritual evolution and extremely valuable to have access to so much foundation material in such an accessible reference format.

* The Veca Codes + Kathara Colored Schematics.

Veca Codes: the \\\\\\\"Time Vector Codes\\\\\\\"; mathematical programs of manifestation that govern the formation of Fire Letter Sequences in manifestation templates.

Each Dimensional Field, and the Primal Light and Sound Field have a set of Veca Code programs, that when activated in a Planet or Being allow the corresponding Life Force Current, in its original organic \\\\\\\"Eternal Divine Blueprint\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Divine Right Order\\\\\\\" form, to progressively embody.

The High Veca Codes of D-12 Divine Blueprint and Primal Light/Sound Trion-Meajhe Fields above have the power to restore all Veca codes and Scalar Template below them to their original Divine Blueprint or \\\\\\\"Divine Right Order.\\\\\\\"

Veca Code Bio-Regenesis programs allow the unnatural 7 Jehovian Seals to be cleared from the body and Veca Code RRT\\\\\\\'s allow rapid anchoring of the D-12 Planetary Divine Blueprint for expedited fulfillment of the Planetary Christos Realignment Mission.

When used with the Temporary Maharic Seal, Toning of the Veca Code \\\\\\\"names\\\\\\\" (auditory translation of their core mathematical vibration. Mu-A\\\\\\\'-va, Ha-Sha, Shar-DA\\\\\\\'z-a, DU-A\\\\\\\'jha and Ec-ka), activates corresponding mathematical codes in the DNA Template, expediting embodiment of the personal D-12 Pre-matter Divine Blueprint and corresponding levels of personal expanded consciousness.
