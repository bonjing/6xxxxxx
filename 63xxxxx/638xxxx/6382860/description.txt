"Welcome to The Dinner Party. This erotic feast is an orgy for the eyes! Appetite for passion? Kaylan Nicole's confession involves being mounted by a two-man posse (Marc Wallice and Nick East). Juli Ashton and Tammi Parks get cooking in a girl/girl kitchen scene. The girls use their bodies to mix all of the ingredients (chocolate, egg whites, etc.) The hottest scene by far is the gynecological office grouping of Celeste (gorgeous!). Debi Diamond is soarily good, and Misty Rain, what an ass! A beautiful and classy film that is both aurally and visually stimulating. The Dinner Party is one of the finest films made in a long time!"
