Plot:
PRIEST, a post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller, is set in an alternate 
world -- one ravaged by centuries of war between man and vampires. 
The story revolves around a legendary Warrior Priest from the last 
Vampire War who now lives in obscurity among the other downtrodden 
human inhabitants in walled-in dystopian cities ruled by the Church. 
When his niece is abducted by a murderous pack of vampires, 
Priest breaks his sacred vows to venture out on a quest to find her 
before they turn her into one of them. He is joined on his crusade 
by his niece's boyfriend, a trigger-fingered young wasteland sheriff, 
and a former Warrior Priestess who possesses otherworldly fighting 
skills

Notes:
There is some camera movement through out the movie, in which every now 
and then you can see 2 chairs. Now not all the time you can see both the 
chairs at the same time some times its just 1 and it is only for a few 
seconds at most also its just the top part of the chairs and not to much 
(this happens around about 5 or so times) but theres no heads or people 
walking around. 

Enjoy :)
