Good Work Uploader, Please Up More!"
,trejedy2,2012-04-12T18:42Z,"Yeah, and I often wonder about that. I mean, it seems to me that if the bitches sign a model release that means a person can do anything with it they want. I would think this could therefore be legal because in truth he isn't lying: other porn producers WILL look at this and if they like her will hire her. Just because he doesn't know who will look, and just because most of the people doing the looking are just consumers, doesn't mean his basic line isn't true. I'm sure it would cause issues as far as having to move frequently, but, hell, the line is that the chicks all want to get into porn, they can't possibly expect to be incognito. I would think that if this weren't fake, it could actually be done."
