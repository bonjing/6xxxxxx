,soupcip,2011-05-11T13:27Z,"wollyy...really?? ""as good as ben saunders"" ?? are you seriously saying you think that tattooboy can sing ? Mygod what is the world coming 2...
But I agree the american version isn't as well produced as its original. It feels rushed and cheap imho.
Anyway thanks eztv ;)"
