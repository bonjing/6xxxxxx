irst up let me just say this movie is incredibly flawed. Some parts of the movie, the editing is just way off. Some of the actors, especially the lead, the lead chick, and the mom had inconsistencies with their acting. In some scenes, they really shine whereas in others, I feel the direction was just off. The dude who plays Kayce, the antagonist of the film, is fun to watch but is never really established as a credible threat thanks to a pointless cat and mouse chase between him and the lead chick. Some scenes had really poor writing where you notice the characters tend to go in circles as far as conversation. I'm not sure whether that's the writer's fault or the actors not having their lines memorized.

But aside from those criticisms, this is a fun movie to watch. For a street-racing film it has a lot of heart and puts so much value in family and friendships. The lead guy has a great family and a posse whose got his back, made up of a hot mechanic, the funny token Asian guy, and another wacky guy to round out his group.

As an action film, don't expect F&F status, don't forget this is a low budget film made by the guys that did Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus. Big budget action films take many months to film, while low budget ones like these take like a month, maybe even just days. And for a low budget feature, it works. The cars and the chase scenes are cool and all female characters are strippers. Except one. But don't worry, she's the hot mechanic chick."
