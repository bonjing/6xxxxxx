,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-05-12T13:31Z,Great upload. +1
,nyder,2011-05-12T15:17Z,"No, crappy quality.

Why do you sqish your HD vids down so much?  Thy look like crap when your playing them.
Normally an 45ish min episode should take at least 1gb file, not a 350k file.

For example, your Jericho looks so  bad, it's not even worth watching.

Appreciate what you are trying to do, but sheesh, at least put twice the size of the kpbs in each rip."
[V],mkvGOD,2011-05-12T21:35Z,"@nyder
I have already said that I messed up on Jericho and will redo it. Maybe you should download and see for yourself first!"
,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-05-13T01:12Z,"""Normally an 45ish min episode should take at least 1gb file, not a 350k file.""

You obviously haven't gotten used to the modern world, dumbass. MKV format makes this possible - better quality, smaller sizes. This is a fine upload."
,ankit280,2011-05-13T08:05Z,"Yes, very good upload and Riddler, yify, Stylishsalah, Kickass and now mkvGOD have proved that small size files too can have great quality
I loved your FNL torrent man.. good quality even when it wasn't Hi-Def"
,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-05-14T14:42Z,Seed people.. what the fuck! 
,nyder,2011-05-15T15:40Z,"okay, i can accept jericho was a bad rip.

And MKV is a container format, not what the files are compressed with.  I suggest fearloathingandparanoia, you learn to use google or something.

And mkvGOD, i will download these and see how the quality is.

Just so you know, I have a 1080p TV and when i can see boxes in a 720p rip on it, during the smallest movements, it is not a good quality rip.

And also, those 45 min 1gb files are also compressed with x264, same compression mkvGOD uses.

[V],mkvGOD,2011-05-15T20:44Z,"@xwusv
what do you mean you will miss me? I'm not going anywhere!

@nyder
you need to remember these are designed to have a low file size. Total size of ALL 3 seasons is 11GB vs. around 100GB for all 3 of the original source. These are ripped form bluray. The special thing about the mkv x264 container is that you can achieve very similar quality to the originals with a low bitrate. The people who have files that are 1GB per episode usually do not lower the bitrate, they just convert straight to x264. The point is that, although they are not identical to the original, they are very close in terms of video quality and take up 3x less space than the other x264 and 10x less space than original blu-ray source. 

If you can afford the space and want absolutely perfect files than download the blu-ray version. If you want very similar quality in a manageable  size than get these."
,xwusv,2011-05-15T22:44Z,"you said on facebook ""I will be very busy for the next week""

I check your page everyday!
big fan!"
[V],mkvGOD,2011-05-15T23:12Z,haha ok. Just for a week tho! Will be uploading again soon. Glad you like everything :)
,theartpirate,2011-05-16T00:36Z,One of my top 3 series of all time! Thanks.
,nyder,2011-05-16T08:10Z,"mkvGOD, I owe you an apology.   The Deadwood looks fine.  I based my judgement on the Jericho and shouldn't of assumed these would be bad also.  My apologies.  =)

[V],mkvGOD,2011-05-16T08:26Z,"@nyder

no problem. Thanks for giving me another try!
I will try to fix Jericho ASAP"
,Stonecaper,2011-05-17T11:40Z,What Source do u use?

,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-05-18T10:10Z,"@nyder - did your daddy raise you to be a whiny lil bitch? you don't like this, dont fucking download it. download the 1 gb files moron. dont come bitching here. 

@mkvgod - might as well do gossip girl season 4 (just ended). the girls are just too fucking hot."
,nyder,2011-05-22T04:49Z,"@fearloathingandparanoia naw, my daddy wasn't around. He was too busy fucking your mom."

,Jexic,2011-06-28T20:41Z,"so im new to torrents and such. what program can i use to watch these after they finish downloading?
thanks for the upload too!"
[V],mkvGOD,2011-06-28T22:04Z,"VLC Media Player is good for all video files

Read the info"
,gushman,2011-06-29T04:36Z,Quality is great. Thanks!
,pjsmoke,2011-06-30T06:15Z,"I downloaded this weeks ago but I didn't want to appear to be a freak fanboy or something posting in all of his torrent chat boxes...Anyway,

For 720p, 

1280x720 + video bit rate 700kbps + mkvGOD = excellent quality

And, if he takes the time to get these 720p rips looking this good, his DVDrips and TVrips will be almost identical as the source video as well.

Also, if you turn off edge and colour enhancement/or a denoise filter in your video player or graphics card these compressed small size videos will look even better if you are ""extremely"" picky about video quality...this helps with all small size mkvs."
,iamcims,2011-07-05T00:05Z,"i compared this to the dvd rip and the difference is huge. these look so much better. yet the same file size.

thank you for this high quality rip.

people who complain about compressed high res rips aren't getting the point. if you must have the full quality to watch in your 1080p tv, then buy it or look elsewhere, keep in mind, the file size will be massive. these files, each episode is the same size as a dvd rip, about 350mb. easy choice. the quality is great."
,Nolimitt,2011-07-10T12:38Z,"Thanks for a great torrent! 

Went well for season 1 but now in 40s% it's in single digits and hardly ever going over. Sometimes it shoots to full speed but soon after I guess that guy stops it :x"
,steveosrage,2011-07-21T11:27Z,please seed!
,chuckdeely,2011-07-24T01:34Z,"Horrible quality for a so called 720P torrent. you can't even read the titles properly it is that bad.

Not for people who are looking to stream to a good plasma.

V=4
A=6

Can't believe anyone wants to pretend this is OK because it is a small download, it is shit quality if you want a real 720P. A 345mb SD file looks better then this."

,sharpshot94549,2011-10-01T08:53Z,"This is a great DVD rip that has been re-sized to 1280x720, but this IS NOT GOOD HD. If you really care about quality, don't get these and make room for the bigger files"
