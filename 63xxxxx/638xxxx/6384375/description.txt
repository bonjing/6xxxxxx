HOPE (Hackers on Planet Earth) Conference mp3 recordings from the first in 1994 to the last which was in 2010. This is my first torrent created and a lot of hard work went into downloading and renaming these 467 recordings. Also in the 1994 pack, I could only get one audio probably because no recording exists now from then, but the rest are complete. Maybe someone can located these for me. Please seed till you get a 1.0 ratio.

Includes:

HOPE: Hackers On Planet Earth
Beyond HOPE
H2K
H2K2
The Fifth HOPE
HOPE Number Six
The Last HOPE
The Next HOPE

Also I have provided a page with the description of every panel and links to original file location which some provide videos.
