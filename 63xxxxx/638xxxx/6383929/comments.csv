,sarsapil,2011-05-17T21:38Z,"Sorry to disagree. For those who want reasonably good sound and video in small size, this torrent is just fine. I converted the mkv into avi and it was just fine. Thanks."
,missJiaLi,2011-05-26T03:16Z,"Mmkay, like i suspected before downloading, @cheeky2305 is a melodramatic, and @sarsapil was more reasonable.

The video is blurred SLIGHTLY, yes, but it's completely watchable. 
The audio, is a pain in some parts, yes.........i had to rewind a few times to hear certain parts clearly.........and then like two other parts, are just impossible to hear, but brief.

In short, people - this movie just came out not even two weeks ago - you can't expect some BR rip.......but nevertheless, this wasn't the best camera in the world, and the very first scene is EXTREMELY dark......but something tells me that was just meant to be a really dark scene, and was most likely very dark in theatres too.........so almost any camera phone would pick up a scene like that, badly to some degree.


But yeah,  not the best camera alive, and so my ratings are:

V=6
A=5

I thank you VERY MUCH though for not only uploading this, but uploading it in such a reasonable size! =)"
