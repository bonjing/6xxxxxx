Thank you for the great music! You have a lot of good music and I like the R&B music from the 40's, 50's and 60's. I'm asking you to seed and to reseed the fantastic music you got Wynonie Harris ""Good Rocking to night"" ""Bump Jump & Jive vol 1"" Bump Jump Jive vol 5"" ""Midnight at the barrelhouse"" and so on. The R&B series from 1948 to 1955 there is someone I still got missing. It's really good music who's making me feel happy. So please reseed, the world is waitng for the good music. Once again 1000 tanks for your good music."
