,Eval555,2011-05-13T14:33Z,Sigh... And no ID tags either...
,Eval555,2011-05-14T16:53Z,"Haha, thanks ;) Nah, I was just surprised, that's all.
ID-Tags are tags like the name, artist, album etc, which a media player can read and implement. It's virtually required to use in a torrent, as a lot of players can't make the name and artist up from the file name.
A program like Stamp ID3 Tag Editor can create ID tags for mp3 files."
