,MMusic123,2011-05-12T14:57Z,"thanks for this.  I wish Flac would be compression 8 (the best) otherwise it really isn't a lossless copy....but still better than a mp3, so thanks for the effort"

Hey man, why don't you shut your stupid fucking mouth, lame.
You've uploaded 2 torrents here on TPB & they're both in mp3.
All of a sudden you're an expert? I not impressed with your credentials. Have a nice day."

Please, give me some of whatever you're smoking."
