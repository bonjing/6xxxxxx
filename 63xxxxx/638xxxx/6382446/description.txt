From Wiki:


The Cars are an American rock band that emerged from the early New Wave music scene in the late 1970s. The band consisted of lead singer and rhythm guitarist Ric Ocasek, lead singer and bassist Benjamin Orr, guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes and drummer David Robinson. The band originated from Boston, Massachusetts, and were signed to Elektra Records by George Daly[1], then A&R head, in 1977.[2]

The Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synth-oriented pop that was then becoming popular and which would flower in the early 1980s. The Cars started fresh with their debut album The Cars which went on to go platinum in late 1978, The Cars debut album was called a "genuine rock masterpiece" by allmusic. Probably the most successful and well known song from the album "Just What I Needed", started as a demo in 1977. The song was sent as a mix tape to a local DJ in the Boston area, who played the song in heavy rotation. This soon caught the attention of other DJ's, which led to the signing of the band by Elektra Records in 1977. The Cars have mentioned this numerous times including in their "last" interview in June 2000. Robert Palmer, music critic for The New York Times and Rolling Stone, described The Cars' musical style by saying: "they have taken some important but disparate contemporary trendsâ€”punk minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of art rock, the '50s rockabilly revival and the melodious terseness of power popâ€”and mixed them into a personal and appealing blend."[3]

Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented on their style saying "the Cars were nevertheless inspired by proto-punk, garage rock, and bubblegum pop."

The band broke up in 1988, and Ocasek had always discouraged talk of a reunion since then, telling one interviewer in 1997 "I'm saying never and you can count on that."[4] Bassist Benjamin Orr died in 2000 from pancreatic cancer. In 2005, Easton and Hawkes joined with Todd Rundgren to form a spin-off band, The New Cars, which performed classic Cars and Rundgren songs alongside new material. The remaining members reunited in 2010 to record a new album, titled Move Like This, which will be released May 10, 2011, and a tour to start on the same day







Move Like This 2011


Move Like This is the seventh album by American rock band The Cars. The album is their first since 1987's Door to Door and features all of the original band members except for bassist and vocalist Benjamin Orr, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2000.


Move Like This is the first reunion of The Cars to feature vocalist Ric Ocasek since their 1988 split. In 1997, Ocasek told a journalist that the band would "never" reunite: "I'm saying never and you can count on that."[3][4] A partial reunion of the band occurred in 2005 when keyboardist Greg Hawkes and lead guitarist Elliot Easton toured with singer Todd Rundgren, drummer Prairie Prince and bassist Kasim Sulton as "The New Cars"; neither Ocasek nor Cars drummer David Robinson participated, and the Rundgren lineup split following two years of touring.[4]

According to Paste magazine, Ocasek said that he was "amazed at how we clicked when we got back together."[5] Exclaim! has noted that The Cars' Facebook page features a picture of producer Jacknife Lee, "which suggests that he will be producing the new album."[6] According to Rolling Stone, Lee produced five of the songs from the album; The Cars themselves produced the others.[7]

The Cars did not add a new bassist to the lineup to replace Orr; instead, the album's bass parts were programmed or performed by Hawkes and Lee, with Hawkes playing a bass once owned by Orr.[7] While Ocasek and Orr split vocal duties on past albums, Ocasek sings lead on all the tracks from Move Like This.[7] In a Rolling Stone interview, Ocasek said, "I was aware that on half of the new songs, Ben would have done better than I did. But we never wanted anybody from the outside."[7]

In October 2010, the band released a one-minute clip of "Sad Song" and a 73-second sample of another track from the album, "Blue Tip", on their Facebook page; a snippet from another upcoming track, "Free", was later posted on the band's page.[4][8] FMQB describes "Free" as a "return to the classic Cars sound that fans know and love."[8]

On February 17, 2011, the band posted the full video for "Blue Tip" on their Facebook page.[9] According to Billboard, the album was recorded in engineer Paul Orofino's home studio in Millbrook, New York.[4] Additional recording sessions were held in Los Angeles.[7] One of the working titles for the album was Sharp Subtle Flavor.[10]

The first single was the track "Sad Song".[1] Exclaim! magazine comments that "[d]espite the title and lyrics, it doesn't sound particularly sad, as it contains a cheery beat and a catchy mix of synths and guitars."
