From Wikipedia:
Phonographic Memory is the first album by the indie pop group The Alice Rose, released November 10, 2006, on Emerald Wood Records. It debuted at number one on Waterloo Records' Shiner TX Top Ten[1]. The album was recorded February to August, 2006, at Congress House Studio in Austin, Texas, with producer Mark Hallman and engineer Ned Stewart. The record's 10 songs, written by lead vocalist JoDee Purkeypile, draw heavily from 60's rock and 80's power pop influences. Shortly after the record's release the song "West" was named as NPR's "Song of the Day" on November 27, 2006[2]. Two years later, the song was also featured in the soundtrack of the award-winning indie horror film "Splinter" by director Toby Wilkins, released in October 2008.[3]It remains the band's most critically acclaimed album to date.
