Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory (Season 4) | Ep. 6 | Ginger Lion

Rob gives his mom, Patty, the full Hollywood superstar treatment when he casts her in an absurd commercial for a new credit card company he has invested in. Rob's cousin, Big Cat, loses a bet and is forced to appear in the commercial dressed as a "man-cat / ginger-lion", inspiring Rob and the crew to don red wigs and explore their "inner-gingers" for a day. At the red carpet premier of her commercial, Rob surprises Patty with an incredible special guest.
