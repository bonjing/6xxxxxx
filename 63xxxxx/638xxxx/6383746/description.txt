A cold drizzle is falling on the Pentagon parking lot. The memorial 
for those who died here on 9/11 was dedicated in 2008--just a 
year ago--but it`s almost deserted. In nearly four years at the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security (DHS), I never managed to visit any of 
the 9/11 memorials. Now that I`m out of office, along with the rest of 
the Bush Administration, I have time to pay a quiet visit.

  I don`t like the place. Flat and unadorned, it feels like an exten-
sion of the vast Pentagon parking lot. The trees are scrawny, and 
the grounds are a utilitarian expanse of gravel and rain-slick paving 
stones. Beyond the sparse vegetation and a concrete wall, traffic hisses 
and thrums on a highway.

  I think I know what the designers had in mind. They wanted 
everything understated and austere. There`s a bench and a lighted pool 
of water for each victim who died here. Each bench bears a victim`s 
name. The benches and the paths trace the course that Flight 77 must 
have taken--smack into the massive west wall of the Pentagon that 
looms nearby, gray in the rain. 

  The site is all about good taste and minimalism. Security is tight. 
The grounds look as though they`re swept clean each night to remove 
any trace of the day`s visitors, their litter, their mess, their grief.

  But I`m not in the mood for good taste. The place feels cold and 
runic. Some benches arc toward the building; others arc away. Some 
of the pools have names in them; most don`t. The benches are arranged 
by year, from 1998 to 1930. 

  I`ve come for a memorial; instead I`ve found some kind of puzzle.

I practice law for a living, but off and on I`ve spent years in govern-
ment. This last tour has been a tough one. DHS was a startup, begun 
in the wake of disaster and assembled on the fly. two years in, DHS 
suddenly realized that it needed a policy office, and I got the job. A 
startup within a startup, the office had to be built from scratch. 

  Everything was up for grabs--policies, procedures, authorities, per-
sonnel. I knew that wouldn`t last; slowly the demand for routine would 
crowd out innovation. So in the midst of chaos--uncertain budgets, 
borrowed staff, no backup--I felt the pressure to push new ideas and 
policies into place as quickly as possible. Early on, what matters is how 
good your ideas are. later, what matters is whether your ideas have 
been vetted with every office that thinks it has a stake in the decision. 

  So all at the same time, I had to build the office, recruit great peo-
ple, solidify the budget, and put a solid policy structure under much 
of what DHS did. 

  I did that.  Now I`m tired. I need time to clear my head.
