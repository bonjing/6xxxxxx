Practical Electronic Model Railway Projects-viny

Electronic projects for use with model railways are a relatively modern development, but these circuits have now developed to such a degree that it is possible to produce layouts that have an amazing degree of realism in both appearance and sound. The aim of this book is to provide the model railway enthusiast with a number of useful bur reasonably simple projects that are easily constructed from readily available components
Stripboard layouts and wiring diagrams are provided for each project. The projects covered include: constant voltage controller, pulsed controller, pushbutton pulsed controller; pulsed controller with simulated inertia, momentum and braking; automatic signals; steam whistle sound effect; two-tone horn sound effect; automatic two-tone horn effect automatic chuffer. The final chapter covers the increasingly popular subject of using a computer to control a model railway layout, including circuits for computer based controllers and signalling systems.
