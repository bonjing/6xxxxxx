Plot:
A so-called Thai lesbian movie, Yes or No tells the story of Pai, a college girl who holds a negative attitude about tomboys. Yet she finds out that her new room-mate, Kim, is a woman who dresses like a man and who likes women. The initial mistrust slowly changes into something else as Kim begins to pursue Pai.
