,MCWacker,2011-05-28T08:13Z,Many thanks :D
,blackdragon13,2011-06-08T22:40Z,There is no season 4 they are still on season 3.
,MacTee,2011-06-09T00:30Z,Hes got the episodes link right in the description.  This is 28 of the 32 episodes of season 4.  Their might be more ep for s04 but i don't really know i'm way behind on the series(why i'm here in the first place).  Thanks alot Jerry =)
,skabb0,2011-07-22T01:26Z,"Confirmed:  These are from SEASON 3.   There is no season 4 yet (As of this posting, S03E62 & S03E63 were just uploaded yesterday after airing this week).  It's a convenient way to get 28 episodes from season 3 in one torrent, but that's it."
,skabb0,2011-07-22T01:30Z,"To further specify:  The link to wiki in the description lists episodes as being part of season 4 which are on TPB as ""S03EXX"".  On the wiki link, the episode numbers on Season 3 only go up to 26, whereas here, season 3 is up to 63 episodes.  If you download all of the ""S03EXX"" episodes, then you already have every episode in this torrent."

im pretty sure i have not seen these episodes cause my History channel mostly spam season 2 and 1 and shows season 3 to but never know when :P "
,DRAGON3000,2011-09-24T09:34Z,"People, quit saying they don't have a season 4. They do. The first episode of season 4 was released in December of 2010. THIS is season 4!"
