,zaxafreon,2011-05-30T18:14Z,"Can i just say that very impressed with the quality of your efforts. Streamed from my HDD to watch on My 42"" Samsung LCD and video/audio great (10/10).
Its a shame the film itself only deserves about 3/10, but you cant be held responsible for that!"
,zephyr172,2011-06-04T08:14Z,"if the sample is anything to go by:
A = 10
V = 10

Thanks for the upload"

,scottsasse,2011-08-02T05:28Z,"@ ameet6233, Many THANKS for the up!! I am so looking forward to watching this. Never downloaded from you before and my hopes are that ""bert2006"" was wrong about not getting 5.1 and just didn't know how to adjust receiver sound settings. If I have same problem I'll let you know. Once again many THANKS and THANKS to all seeders!! Lotta Love, DrScott "

This is The stupidest super hero Movie i seen in which the super hero has less power and courage then his mate..."
