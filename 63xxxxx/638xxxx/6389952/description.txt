Jordan & The Lynn Rebels is the solo project of Jordan Kratz the long time NE USA punk rocker.Jordan has been supporting punk rock since he went to his first show in the summer of 1976.Within a few years he put together his own punk band, recorded 4 track live and demos for local bands, and of course went to nearly every show in town throughout the 1970's and into the 1980's.

    Jordan grew up in Lynn, Massachusetts and started jamming in rock bands in 1972.Always an innovator he turned his friends onto smaller little known rock music acts.When the punk revolution started he turned on many to the new music.He was the 1st punk in the northern suburbs of Boston.
