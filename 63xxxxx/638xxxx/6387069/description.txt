About 18 month ago (December 14 2009) I posted a torrent with the three first CD's (double) in the series "Lost and Found".

Now Iâ€™ve found (!) volume 5 with hitâ€™s from 1956 â€“ 1964. Still donâ€™t know if this series of CDs has been released in any other country than Sweden. Havenâ€™t found any info on Internet about this CD, except for Freedb.
It is all original recordings.
Still searching for vol. 4.
