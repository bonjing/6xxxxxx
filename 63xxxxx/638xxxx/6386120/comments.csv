,drarvi,2011-05-12T14:07Z,"Yah, banukaknight is right, its already been done by stylishslah, just 280mb and good quality too, but still thanks to twentyforty and as usual +1 :)"
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-12T14:17Z,thanks for this smaller encode.
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-12T17:38Z,"Guys, it doesn't make sense at all,
By you, I would encode ONLY what your favored have not - or what ANYBODY else haven't.
Whoever can't download my 720p should directed to ""other guy""?
I should do all that?
Keep track what have been done and be governed by that?
By the way - you can't marry all the girls in town - and you cannot
make others to love same things as you do, right?

If you cannot say just plain ""Thanks"" - please, shut the fuck up.

Try not to be so stupid or make rooting so obvious. Please.

I released 720p and 480p versions few minutes apart - smaller one for people on crappy connections, limited HDD space or budget, and not for myself. Capische?

@peeyoosh & @azrielle: Thank you. You obviously know what  I am talking about.

,myrabbitisdead,2011-05-12T19:28Z,thank you twentyforty!!!
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-12T20:15Z,"Thanks.

@myrabbitisdead: My deepest condolences."
,dark_defender,2011-05-13T01:30Z,"I have just got a 40"" LED, and now when i compare 720p encodes from various uploaders that i used to download earlier, it turns out that the ones from 20-40 are best. Let alone 1080p.On smaller screens you will not find much difference. But if you are collecting movies(Bluray or HD) like i do, you have got to think for the future(big screen). So, now i only download from him.

Without meaning offence to any uploader as i respect them for what they put in, but even in encodes of uploader like YIFY, pixelation is there."

great victories comes with great sacrifices.
great men... do shit cos they are human.
some listen. cos they have ears.
some don't; cos they are high & don't give a damn.
spirit.

Thanks."
