,Moonshaft,2011-05-10T23:25Z,"Is this also cracked correctly to work on Steam, or is it pretty much just the Single Player campaign online?"
,xiIix,2011-05-10T23:25Z,Nice! Hats off to SKID!
,Zaknaberrnon,2011-05-10T23:28Z,is this one good?

,NarcoPolo,2011-05-10T23:54Z,"Great man, thank you for this, and to Skidrow of course."

,mcKrackerT,2011-05-11T00:49Z,SEEEEEEEEEEEEED! 
,mesa_one,2011-05-11T01:01Z,"Before anyone complains about the DL speed: This was released today, and the seed ratio is 0.008 right now. That's why it is slow. I'll seed until I get 4.0 ratio at least"
,mesa_one,2011-05-11T01:03Z,"@Moonshaft single player only. Multiplayer requires a unique, valid key. Steam will never work with pirated games."
,xboXtrme,2011-05-11T01:12Z,SERIAL? plz
,Rhidd,2011-05-11T01:30Z,"Does the Multiplayer on this work?


*Seed*"
,jhelm,2011-05-11T01:55Z,Please seed!
,pipboy650,2011-05-11T04:46Z,"Gaah! I've been uploading over 30 GB and haven't got the game yet, come on guys Seeeeeed! :D"
,BF2X,2011-05-11T08:34Z,Can find everything EXCEPT for a key. All I find is just links to survey sites and shit. For christ's sake. Just a waste of time for me.
,Black-Embrace,2011-05-11T09:10Z,"Dont worry about the corrupt file. After install go to brink install folder and find and run DX setup. One this is done copy ALL THREE FILES from skidrow folder, and should play no problem, fixed the appid error for me, hope it can help you all out too! Goodluck and happy gaming!"
,lukegoodman2001,2011-05-11T09:18Z,wow this games is bad i am glad it tried it before buying it. there is no single player to speak of and the gameplay just feels flat  
,kaz050,2011-05-11T09:48Z,lukegoodman2001 
,lozzer22,2011-05-11T10:19Z,"@lukegoodman2001

WTF are you on about? There is a single player campaign for both of the sides and lots of challenges."
,Moonshaft,2011-05-11T12:28Z,"@mesa_one

One of the Skidrow cracks from the Skidrow link that was posted on the ""Razor1911"" torrent that's up and it said that there was a Steam-cracked version. I guess I was just hoping that they had cracked the multiplayer as well or something.
Oh well, I guess one can always have their hopes up. xD;"
,lukegoodman2001,2011-05-11T12:53Z,its bot multiplayer with cutscenes not a single player campaign reminds me of UT3 but not as good
,PsXgAm,2011-05-11T14:56Z,Search serial on http://www.serials.ws/index.php
,PsXgAm,2011-05-11T14:57Z,has thise single player or no ?
,PsXgAm,2011-05-11T14:58Z,is thise game single player or no ?
,pipboy650,2011-05-11T15:26Z,"I kinda agree with Luke, it's basicly the same as trying to make a ""single player"" version of team fortress 2"
,Felkynde,2011-05-11T16:57Z,"It's generally meant to be played multiplayer.
If you would like the full experience, buying the game seems like the best option, otherwise be happy with your free demo."
,Moonshaft,2011-05-11T18:58Z,"Considering that this game does rely pretty heavily on the Multiplayer feature (that's unfortunately not really accessible through this version), is there really any sort of Single Player at all, or is it more along the lines of ""lol here are a few levels to play by yourself""?
I guess it was my understanding on the game website that there was a big Single Player campaign and when you finish that you can take that same character into multiplayer and use him there as well."
,lukegoodman2001,2011-05-11T19:51Z,"no single player is the multiplayer with cutscenes and co op no real point to it only takes a few hours to do, and multiplayer will be boring within a week"
[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-05-11T19:57Z,"If your install is corrupt then try to fix that with that patch -

,pingstein,2011-06-02T05:28Z,"Works great, had to play around a little to get it to install correctly. Use run as administrator for everything. My kid loves it. A great upload, needs some instructions for the nubs."
,domedidome,2012-02-10T12:22Z,the game works but it s a shit!
