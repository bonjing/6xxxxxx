(But before I begin, I'll like to specify that if you don't have any of the following ones, even letting me know that would be highly appreciated.) Okay, here it is:

Awaiting the DVDRip for Game now (it's too early to ask for I AM or Shor in the City or Chalo Dilli).

SaM, can you let me know if you have got the DVDRip for any of the following:
1] Monica - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1887817/
2] Madhoshi - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430328/

If you've and you'd share it, I'd highly appreciate it. Even otherwise, thanks for spreading and sharing so much entertainment. Cheers.


P.S. Can anyone please tell me what does ""RC"" stand for in the release title (The Adjustment Bureau 2011 RC BDRip......)? Is it the same as R5?

Sorry for the dumb question, but I hope someone will answer it. TIA."

@ feartruth: DVDs are released in 5 Region codes from 1 to 5 (as you know, I guess); Blu-rays releases are divided only in three regions (hallowed be thy name, you mighty Blu-ray Disc Association) this time having letters associated A, B and C. So the RC you were asking about, stands for Region C - Central Asia, East Asia (mainland China and Mongolia only), South Asia, Eastern Europe (Belarus, Russia and Ukraine only), and their dependencies.

you can have Madhoshi (2004) (released by T-series) at the local market,most probably spending Rs 35/- only. Madhoshi(2004) was uploaded previously here in TPB but now it's dead.thanks."
,feartruth,2011-05-13T07:27Z,"@muLineZu: Thanks a ton for enlightening me. My technical know-how is too low.

@Robin5555: Thanks for your response. I looked for it at various stores in and around our area, but in vain. I haven't tried online transactions as yet, and don't intend to as of now."
