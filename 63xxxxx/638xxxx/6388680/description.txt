There\'s a distinction in the world of online erotica between "art" and "porn". Art is supposedly appreciated by the higher senses, savored for its form and composition, its beautiful figures and elegant poses, and viewed from a critical distance. Porn is supposed to be relished by the lower senses, used for immediate gratification, and viewed as closely and uncritically as possible. And never the two shall meet. Until Joymii.
