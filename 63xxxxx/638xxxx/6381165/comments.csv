,Girate,2011-06-11T15:59Z,Torrents probs made by drum and bass music collector (cds) imported them to itunes but didnt change the default to 320kbps so they are all 192 which is a bit of a shame but they have been encoded with a large filesize so the majority of quality is there just lack the loudness and clarity of 320s. none the less thank you very much for sick torrent 
,hadza2390,2011-06-11T22:08Z,"Girate,

itunes hasnt yet invented to life when all this stuff was released. In that time 192 kbps was fucking badass, most stuff was like 128 kbps.

thx for collection"
,Girate,2011-06-16T18:23Z,that is true. i would have thought that 320s where about but does make sense why the 192s are a big size. cush T
,tpbandjelly,2011-07-25T04:14Z,holy crap i want this...... however it would take at least 4 days 16 hours and 53 minutes to organize into folders.
