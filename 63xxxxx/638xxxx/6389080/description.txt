Originally released in the mid-1970s on LP as Ain't Gonna Be Your Lowdown Dog No More, this 1992 CD covers parts of two sets from Piano Red's very successful Montreux concerts. Piano Red treats his huge Montreux audience to the same mixture of good time blues and boogie woogie as the visitors to Muhlenbrink's Saloon in the old Underground Atlanta, where he was a fixture for years. Highlights include "The Right String Baby, But The Wrong Yo Yo," a medley of "Pinetop's Boogie" with "Red's Boogie," and the original record's title track.

Twelve studio tracks recorded a few days after Piano Red's Montreux performances are an added bonus.
