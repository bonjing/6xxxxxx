Thanks locobot12.

Your the man!"
,wullie7362,2011-05-12T18:07Z,"01. Disconnect internet during installation.

02. Install avast.IS.6.0.1125 or avast.AV.Pro.6.0.1125 (not both!) in trial mode.   

03. It's recommended to uncheck ""Participate in the avast! community"".
    (Such info is used to add crack signatures etc to virus databases.)

04. To install additional avast languages choose avast ""Custom Installation"". 
    > Don't download languages through avast (it will render the license invalid)!

05. After installation do NOT reboot, and run avast.
If avast does not start but requires reboot.. then Reboot Pc without Internet . 
06. At Settings -> Troubleshooting: uncheck ""Enable avast! self-defense module"". 

07. Launch Windows Task Manager by pressing keyboard keys CTRL - SHIFT - Esc, 
and let it show all users running processes.
Important :
08. Terminate AvastSvc.exe and AvastUI.exe in Windows Task Manager.
Note - Avastsvc is avast service can be stopped through services tab also!
Stop firewall Service for avast IS 
09. Replace the original ashBase.dll with the crack, then reboot computer.

,Jigjin,2011-05-15T18:24Z,"Hi locobot, 

I always admire your work and support for those having problems.

This time, i am having some serious problem. Firstly the ashbase.dll is not for the version 6.0.1125. Its for previous version 6.0.1091 with same 782 kb size. Have a look-


Then also looking at positive above posts, i have decided to use it and then it started to show that my subscription is expired. :( I have uninstalled that version and again installed previous version 6.0.1091 with provided crack, but it continues to show that my subscription is expired. :( Take a look-


Pls help me. :("
,Chiken0divine,2011-05-15T18:50Z,Why there is 2 antivirus   in this torrent  ( one being avast pro edition and the other avast internet security ) ? witch one is better .. witch one shoul i instal on my computer ? thanks :)
,Jigjin,2011-05-15T20:29Z,"Oh god, thank you. Finally i got it working. HOW???

I would strongly recommand all to use the little application to remove the old version of avast from your pc downloaded from www.avast.com/uninstall-utility given by pramodsharma earlier. Thanks mate, otherwise i was planning to format my pc as i cant think of running internet without Avast Security.

But still i am wondering what has happen and that crack still showing me that it is for v6.0.1091 :confused:

ANY WAYS, THAT CRACK IS ALSO WORKING. SO NO WORRIES AND ENJOY.

THANKS LOCOBOT. "

,Chiken0divine,2011-05-21T03:45Z,":D that was all i need to hear .. thanks man .. perfect torrent you got here .. keep up the good work.

Last Request ( if not possible explain me because i'm noob in these things ) : is any possible  away you ' ll  be releasing a version of avast so people who use it can upgrade program by itself without expiring? (crack becoming invalid) if that is not possible expect a visit from me to your avast torrents everytime a new comes out :D  "

,egor_sosna,2011-06-02T17:18Z,"all is working perfectly, thx (im on win7x64sp1 ult)! for butthanded folks - just start installing, during installation you should  copy cracked ashbase.dll to avast folder (before installation completed), reboot, run avast, go to updates -> unmark update avast program, keep viruses' bases updated only, activate your trial for like 40 years :P"
,egor_sosna,2011-06-02T17:20Z,"+ for those constant whining about ""NOT WORKING FFS"", maybe u should buy that software/games if you cant install em (for free omg?!) & when other thousands got no probs? :P"
,FridayToker,2011-06-03T15:17Z,"@imupendra

It is most likely you still have traces of the old avast on your system, when you un-install it go to the program files folder and remove any avast files, re-boot then get a registry cleaner and clean your computer before installing the new Avast."

,netrek,2011-06-15T08:07Z,Is this version good until 2050 also? If i use this version does it mean I cannot update my virus definitions? I would have bought avast but they are so fucking greedy they charge you for a license good for 1 year only! When you buy software it should last forever! Microsoft started this shitty subscription based pricing model and we as consumers need to REFUSE TO BUY such software until manufacturers stop doing this! I am not paying $70 USD every fucking year just to have AV! GREEDY BASTARDS! YOU ARE SATANIC!

,FridayToker,2011-06-15T14:01Z,"Avast has started to spot the ashBase.dll in the program and is moving it to the virus chest.

That last message was not help with your problem, i only posted to let everyone know that avast has started to notice it's a crack.

If you installed Avast recently and followed all the instructions then the chances are that it doesn't work any more.

You should maybe remove avast and delete the folder in c:/program files then clean the registry and install avast again and apply the patch in safe mode."

,LordMerkadis,2011-06-29T15:08Z,Works fine.
,LordMerkadis,2011-06-29T15:23Z,"Heres how u do it:

Part1:

1. install
2. go settings>updates set program to manual.
3. Exclusions - (inserd your disc letter instead C as to where you installed the prog) C:\AVAST Software\Avast\ashBase.dll*
4. Community - uncheck ""Patricipate in the avast community""
5. Troubleshooting - uncheck ""Enable avast self defense module""

Part2:

1. Next copy the cracked ""AshBase.dll"" (ctrl+c) and paste it into avast installation folder (ctrl+v) window will pop up that u need administration privileges to replace, leave the window hanging there as is for now and do this: ctrl+shift+esc then in the task manager u'll see 2 avast processes called: ""AvastSvc.exe"" and ""AvastUI.exe"" now u kill those two processes then FAST switch to the file replacement window which we got hanging there and replace AshBase.dll with the cracked one if u weren't fast enough to replace file repeat this until u replace it.

2. Restart ur comp and u done, don't need to enable avast self defense module or anything else again either."

,aime76,2011-07-05T08:34Z,"OK. I have tried with Windows 7 Ultimate, it goes perfectly smoothly. Install the progam. I have done it with being disconnected from net, i guess it's not even needed. The problem is, Avast start to work immediately as service (locks folders and sets permissions for any further change) which can not be turned off as normal user (it's maybe possible to turn it off through runas.exe command in cmd), so restart the comp, press F8, choose Safe Mode and copy cracked file to the Avast folder, where original file is (you might rename the original file to .dll.bak for any chance).
