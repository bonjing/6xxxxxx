1986 BBC Documentary:

This is a short 28 minutes documentary that tracks 3 traders at the same time on a single day in 1986.  The traders are from from London, New York and Hong Kong and they work either for the banks forex department or as a private trader running a fund.  On that particular day, it shows how they make or lose money trading 1 Billion Dollars.  It will be very interesting for modern traders to see how these people traded back in 1986, when all that they used was a phone and some simple computer equipment, employing various strategies and tactics to gain the upper hand against their counterparts.
