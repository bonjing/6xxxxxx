,Dragonite_9,2011-05-11T03:28Z,"Hi 3Li, may I ask you why you changed to .mkv instead of .mp4 (on this one at least, dont know about any other, except older from you I got, The Lord of The Rings trilogy for example) ?

I, as so many other really prefer .mp4 and would love if you would not do as HDLiTE who changed to .mkv recently (too).

What's the reason?
From my experience .mp4 runs smoother, and generally works better when you run it on a computer, vs .mkv. VLC just as any other player with matroska (ofc) etc codecs ""installed"".
Really do not like .mkv.

And size wise .mp4 and .mkv files same properties (over all bit rate at least) should be about the same, right? 

So would really appreciate if you could answer why you (and probably same reason HDLiTE) have started to use .mkv instead of .mp4?

Assuming you did not just up load an old rip of yours ?
, that was in .mkv, which you used before in ""the beginning"" of the awesome 3Li! :D

Thank you very much in advance for an answer, and as well as the time you took to up load the torrent, love your work, (although .mp4 are really prefered instead of the .mkv).
Big fan, really would like to be able to do as good brrips as you, but cant get it quite that good yet :/

Have a nice day!
Best regards, daWaith.

PS.
Greetz from all of us in the ""The Cureless release group"", who hope to be able to start upload own rips in the same quality as you in the near future, just not there yet, and/so we so far mostly just have uploaded very rare torrents.

And not so much anymore here on tpb, people here can be so fucking rude idiots for against uploaders for no reason, so we do not feel like uploading anything anymore for them, but we respect you a lot for coming back and uploading here again, after all those people wrote all that shit about you in you torrents! Keep up the good work, and hopefully please stay in .mp4! 

Cheers m8! "

ps
@ Dragonite_9 :
hey mate this is ""BluRay 720p DTS"" not BRRIP or BDRIP  , that is why MVK and not MP4 ....."
,Dragonite_9,2011-05-26T07:30Z,"@mylky11

That explains a lot if so..

BUT however:

""*Source/File Size..........: BluRay 1080p=13 GB""

3Li has taken a bigger BluRay and made it smaller, but still with great quality, BluRay rip?"
,Dragonite_9,2011-05-26T07:35Z,"PS.

The name is ""Pirates Of The Caribbean The Curse Of The Black Pearl 2003 BluRay 720p DTS x264-3Li"" 

I'm too tired and very very sick, disregard my last post. He made a copy of ""his own"" BluRay disc, not a downloaded one that he made a BRRIP of.. pretty obvious yes.."
