,Krisiun,2011-05-13T22:14Z,"kolagen: mark all zips and right click, choose extract...now you have even more files ;) Choose the first .rar and again right click, choose extract. Now you have the keygen and setup-file all good to go."
,andreLeo,2011-05-14T17:26Z,"Nice download. But what about for Mac. The disk is usually duel boot so can't you post a disc image?

,kolagen,2011-05-15T07:14Z,"up all night wrestling with installation,it sez over and over;serial not valid.please comment?"
,dragongator,2011-05-16T15:25Z,"This might be a very good upload, but without STEP BY STEP installation guide it's USELESS. Not everyone understands how to properly unzip so many files. I've got just complete mess out of it. Waste of time only. Sad... Did not even see keygen.
If you had time to upload this stuff, why don't spend a few minutes more to explain how to properly unzip and what to do next and next and next and next and next e.t.c.?
@Stun - I'm stunned for such a nice upload! The only bad point is it does not work. Simply because I don't know how to install and activate it. Therefore I can name this upload USELESS.
Thanks for your time (mine was wasted)."
,st_jo,2011-05-17T13:33Z,"I sent a msg thru his youtube acct.
Haven't heard back yet.
Got as far as keygen not working.
Also, encountered ""threat"" via McAfee."
,Lady_Malice85,2011-05-19T10:54Z,"Installing is rather simple. 
All I did was the following:
1)Extract the files into its own folder. This makes it easier to find the setup file.

2)Extract Setup files and install Painter

3) After you install, start the program and setup an account (I used an old email that I never check)

4) EXIT PROGRAM! It should pop up a window that asks to register the program. Open the Keygen and copy the serial number. 

5) Click the option to register by phone and you should get an installation number. Copy this into the Keygen and it will generate an activation number. You are done!"
,AbhorentMongrel,2011-06-03T02:53Z,"Okay ladies and gentlemen,  for those of you struggling to get this torrent working here is a step-by-step.

Step 1: Download the torrent.

Step 2: If you haven't already, download Win-Rar.

Step 3: Go to the folder that you downloaded Painter 12 to, find the Painter folder and look inside, you should see a load of Rar files with odd names.

Step 4: Select all of the rar files, right click and choose extract files, it should automatically create a new folder within the folder of rars.

Step 5: Enter the new folder, you will have another lot of rar files, setup.part01, setup.part02 etc and the keygen.  Double click setup.part01 and extract the setup file where it asks you to, it will go through all of the rars in the folder and combine them into one setup file in its own folder, if you are missing any parts double click the original rars until you find the missing number and re-download it.

There should now be a new folder named setup.

Open the keygen and star the setup file.

Run the setup file as you would for any other peice of software, enter the serial number given by the keygen and install the software.

Star the software and wait for the activation window to pop up, you might have to close corels main window for this happen, choose phone activation.

Copy the installation code into the keygen, click activate and paste the activation code into corel and click activate.

You're done!"
,danihel,2011-06-17T14:32Z,"man these core guys their midis are just bad

other than that, nice work ;)"
,Ekkusu,2011-06-19T22:35Z,"Like to note that for those who get an invalid Serial the first time you start up the keygen, make sure it's on Corel Painter v.012. Gave me a start that's for sure.
Other than that, just follow the others' instructions and thanks for the torrent! Seeding now!"
,Squiddy09,2011-06-24T20:34Z,"I've installed everything fine, however, when I go to start the program it gives me the activation screen, it says I have 30 days left, blah blah blah. 

The problem is, none of the buttons work, no matter how many times I click activate now or other activation options, even clicking the red x in the top right to close it doesn't work. 

I'm on Windows 7 64bit - any ideas?"
,blinkyrage,2011-07-11T20:07Z,Thank you for the huge work. I wonder why my VIPRE finds Trojan in the setup file! Check it.
,Vanhline,2011-07-22T10:53Z,"i extracted all the the files and there was no keygen, just the setup file and a lame music video/credits for cracking...

where is this mythical keygen im hearing about cause ive backtracked all your ""walk troughs"" and nothing your all saying to do produces a kergen.

when the file is completed un-rar the files you get are:
CORE.NFO
CORE10k.EXE(just a music vid/credits)
file_id.diz
setup.exe

no keygen....."

it says the activation code is invalid my serial worked when i installed it tho..

and for everyone who cant find the keygen it's in one of the extracted files named ""cr.qacXX"" i just extracted them one by one"
,stbrides,2011-08-08T17:00Z,"I put in the serial number from the keygen - it says invalid - I tried a few.
I used the serial shown here http://i1088.photobucket.com/albums/i332/demoneyeskyo22/Capture.jpg

,g8mate,2011-08-11T09:19Z,"thank you for your guidance Lady_Malice85 and  AbhorentMongrel . Had downloaded this program from btjunkie and I was lost in the wood of these numerous zip files. I start to unzip each file one by one and finally just gave up and delete the program. 
Thanks to uploader MAFIAA as well. Waited for working version of Painter 12 so long.    "
,GutterT,2011-08-23T16:46Z,"For whoever didn't get the keygen after extraction, try deleting the extracted files and doing it again. I only got it the second time.

Try by selecting all the ""cr"" files, clicking right-button and choosing ""extract here"". The keygen should show up."

,Amy McGregor,2011-12-11T20:12Z,"I seem to have kind of the same problem as Squiddy, but this happens when I'm going to install the program. I get to the first part ""term and license agreement"" and I check the box that I agree to the terms and conditions, click ""Next"" but nothing happens. I can click the cross in the corner of the window and ""cancel"", but then when I come to the box that says that I chose not to install blah blah I can not click ""finish"", but have to click the cross in the corner.

I also have Win 7 64-bit."

,LOLren,2012-03-13T14:38Z,"
OK I signed up to this site JUST to give clearer installation instructions.

1. Download torrent.

2. If you haven't already, download Win-Rar.

3. Open folder Corel.Painter.v12.0.0.502.Incl.Keymaker-CORE

4. Select ALL the Zip files starting with the letters ""cr""

5. Create a NEW folder on your dekstop or wherever and extract ALL the zip files to this folder
for example:
> Extract files...
> Desination Path: C:UsersNameDesktopCorel Painter

6. Once all files have been extracted you should find files called
> Core.NFO
> CORE10k.EXE
> file_id.diz
> keygen.exe

and a whole bunch of setup.part00.rars

7. Double click ""Setup.part01.rar""

8. Double click the ""setup.exe"" file which opens in the zip folder

9. Continue installation as you would with any program

10. Select the trail key instead of ""I already have a key""

11. Corel should open after installation, create an account with Corel (I used an old e-mail address) then close it

12. Once it's closed, an activation window should pop up giving you a 30 day period to use Corel. Go back to your folder on your desktop and open ""keygen.exe""

13. Select and paste the serial number in Corel and click the option to register by phone and you should get an installation number

14. Copy and paste that number provided into the Keygen and it will generate an activation number. This should activate Corel.

You're done - enjoy!"

Make sure to select Corel Painter 12 in the KeyGen.

Thanks Mafiaa!"
,ironymon,2012-03-22T16:41Z,"Theres a lot of confusion why is it not registering right...

1Extract the files.
2 install the software - do not use generated serial key, let it install under trial key. (use 30 days trial)
3 open the corel paint and close it.
4 open the corel paint click enter serial, use generated serial from keygen (be sure to have selected corel paint 12)
5 once you put the serial in the tab the option to ""phone core"" will appear clickable, do so.
6 copy installation code from there to keygen, either with   -   or without, no spaces in between use ctrl c to copy and ctrl v to paste, use mouse to highlight the code.
7 Click activation and keygen will generate activation code. 
8 copy activation code to the corel and click continue.
9 the software should have been activated by now, go paint, buy the software if you can afford it."
,matthewbatt2029,2012-04-05T03:26Z,"I think i made a mistake... i had it installed perfectly fine, but then one day pressure sensitivity stopped working with this program, it works on all other programs but not this one any more not even one tool. so i tried to uninstall and re install it, and now i can't even update...

,Clunk47,2012-04-10T18:23Z,"IF THE KEYGEN IS DISAPPEARING:


DISABLE ANTIVIRUS AUTO PROTECT!
ONCE YOU HAVE FINISHED USING THE KEYGEN, AND THE PROGRAM IS RUNNING, YOU CAN DELETE THE KEYGEN AND RE ENABLE ANTIVIRUS.


MOST CRACKS AND KEYGENS SHOW AS VIRUSES. THIS DOES NOT MEAN IT IS A VIRUS, IT IS A FALSE POSITIVE. IT'S CALLED REVERSE ENGINEERING. ANYTHING THAT ACTS FUNNY, LIKE A FILE TRYING TO ACCESS A PROGRAM IN ANY ODD WAY, A KEYGEN FOR EXAMPLE, APPEARS MALICIOUS TO ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE!"

,rsullivan77,2012-06-19T04:43Z,"worked perfectly for me, just make sure to follow the directions that LOLren posted if you're having trouble. Also, make sure that when you're looking at the keygen, you select corel painter v.12 from the dropdown list of applications.

many thanks for the awesome program!"
