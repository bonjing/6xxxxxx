
In spite of the fact that "Congo" is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, Jerry Goldsmith has managed to create another score that is better than the movie itself. 
Once again, Goldsmith created one of his best main titles for this film with 'Spirit Of Africa', this time he is joined by Lebo M, the same African artist who contributed with his magical chants on the soundtrack for "The Lion King". As with "The Ghost And The Darkness", Goldsmith fancies African rhythms that fit perfectly to the soul of the movie, if it ever had one. The action music is fantastic, especially 'Bail Out', 'Hipo Attack', and 'Amy's Nightmare'.
It's too bad that this good piece of music was written for a terrible movie. However, Jerry Goldsmith knows how to make his music stand on its own. (Customer from Amazon)
