A short essay I wrote encompassing how I see the world based on the opinions of people I have met over the last 8 years. An issue that many people I know find controversial and helping TPB make a point in the world.

Hopefully to be a series as time goes on and people I meet and talk to give me some new insight as to what is going on. This is the way around 150 people would see the world, it is a shame it is not a majority but I believe the majority may not like to abide by what it sets out to say. Have a read and enjoy. Perhaps I'll change your mind, make a point you can use in an arguement.

Either way, 3 pages is very short for this kind of work, so not much of your time lost if you don't like it.

Cheerio,
And TPB FOREVER!
