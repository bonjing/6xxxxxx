,cuzkelly,2011-05-13T10:45Z,"...is there any chance you would be able to re-upload some old videos in 1280x720 (HD resolution)???

...the few music video's you did in the:
1280x800 resolution???
(I have Black Bars top AND bottom in this wierd resolution)

I'm a HUGE fan, hope this doen't offend...
Video's like:
Pixie Lott - Broken Arrow
Rihanna - What's My Name
Rock Mafia - The Big Bang feat. Miley Cyrus
Selena Gomez - A Year Without Rain feat. The Scene
Taio Cruz - Higher feat. Kylie
 thanks in advance!"

1.You don't offend me with that.
2.the resolution 1280x800 have a ratio 16/10
3.some videos have black bars,an example is the video i upload from Pitbull ft.NeYo(in my opinion is that a terrible video,but they have made it so)"

If you want that Pitbull ft.NeYo video i got another one without black bars.
Those other videos you asked i don't have it,but i will see what i can do for you."
