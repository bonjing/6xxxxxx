EDDIE MACK SHOTGUN BOOGIE THE BEST OF 1947-1952
Label: Master Classic Records
CD Released: 2010 
Format:Mp3@320


Eddie Mack (real name Edmundson or Edmonson) joined Cootie Williams' Orchestra by the late 40's, sharing the vocal duties with Bob Merrill, after this band had a hit featuring Eddie "Cleanhead" Vinson as vocalist. The influence of "Cleanhead"'s blues-shouting vocal on Mack is certain. One single was cut in the fall of 1949, for Mercury. After that, we find this singer on Apollo Records with the support of members of Erskine Hawkins Orchestra ("King Loving Daddy", "How About That", "Heart Throbbing Blues", "Behind Closed Doors"). Before the end of 1949, Mack recorded the two Rudolph Toombs' tunes: "Cool Mama" and Hoot And Holler Saturday Night". Three singles were released in late 1949 and early 1950. "If You Want To Come Home","Long Time" are issued from this stuff.
After leaving Apollo, Eddie Mack returned with Cootie Williams, recording a pair of singles for Derby records in N.Y.City and an outstanding session for Savoy in 1952; an aural evidence indicates that Mack may have been the vocalist disguised as Pigmeat Peterson who recorded with Lucky Millinder for King/Federal during the same year.
In 1953, Eddie Mack brought his contribution in the growth of Rock and Roll, influenced by Big Joe Turner and Louis Jordan, with Mickey Baker of whom we can hear the guitar in "Last Hour Blues", "Seven Days Blues", "Good Time Woman", "Keyhole Blues"...

Fine reissue featuring all the recordings by this obscure but very fine blues shouter. Eddie Mack (Mack Edmondson) was part of the Brooklyn blues scene in the late 40s and early 50s but his subsequent career is a mystery. He is featured here with various groups including Cootie Williams & His Orch. (he replaced Eddie Vinson), Lucky Millinder & His Orch and others. Sidemen include Willis Jackson, Bill Jennings, Bobby Smith, Haywood Henry, Rene Hall, Mickey Baker and others. Includes his intriguing and fine covers of Tennessee Ernie Ford's â€œShotgun Boogieâ€ and Merle Travis's â€œDivorce Me C.O.D.â€.
