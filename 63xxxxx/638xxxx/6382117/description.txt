Here on â€˜Normal For Bridgwater,â€™ Peter Bruntnell kicks it into low gear and stays there ... and while that may be a drawback for most artists, itâ€™s where Peter lives, playing to the heartbeat of a person who's thoughts are lost in a world of their own.

Peter has a genuine talent for building gentle memorable hooks, not hooks that perk you up, but hooks that live in their own space, hooks that you donâ€™t even realize until theyâ€™ve passed.  This is an exquisite Alternative Country album, one on which Peter makes all of the right moves, and of the right connections ... those to Son Volt, some dreamy twangy pedal steel guitar, and moments that almost crank up to be outright pop songs; but then in the same instant, even as the tunes are happening, he cools them right down.  Peter has one of the most unique and recognizable voices out there today.  Thereâ€™s a wounded sense of intimacy to his vocals, filled with the warmth and comfort of someone whoâ€™s pressed right up against you, and saying just what you need to hear.
