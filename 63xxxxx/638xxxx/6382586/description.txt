Stargate Universe (often abbreviated as SGU) is a Canadian - American military science fiction television series and part of MGM's Stargate franchise. It follows the adventures of a present-day, multinational exploration team unable to return to Earth after an evacuation to the Ancient spaceship Destiny, which is traveling in a distant corner of the universe. The series, created by Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper, premiered in the United States on Syfy on October 2, 2009. The series features an ensemble cast and is primarily filmed in and around Vancouver, BC, Canada. A second season of 20 episodes was announced by Syfy in December 2009. The first 10 episodes were aired in the United States beginning on September 28, 2010; the remaining 10 beginning on March 7, 2011. Syfy announced on December 16, 2010 that it would not be picking Stargate Universe up for a third season and that the Spring 2011 season would be the last to air on its channel.

The second season (and last) of SGU is planned to end as a cliffhanger. To resolve this a movie was being planned; however, due to timing constraints, Stargate writer and executive producer Brad Wright announced on April 17, 2011 that the SGU movie was not going to happen.
