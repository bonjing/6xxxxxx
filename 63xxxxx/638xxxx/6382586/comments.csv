[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-05-13T11:41Z,"Come on guys seed. I've uploaded 2TB on this so far and there are 3 seeds, 2 of which are me. This is the first 720P upload I've done. If people are too selfish to seed it will be my last."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-05-14T19:01Z,"Philsallsorts, no it's not. It doesn't cost you anything and it's not much to ask for all the latest shows for free. It's a shame more people aren't like you, keep up the good work."
,mathsterk,2011-05-19T06:21Z,"i'll seed this for 2 weeks @ ~2 MiB/s.

The A in Stargate is an Å(ish), and in norwegian it becomes Stargåte(star riddle) :P"
,jahnee,2011-06-01T14:26Z,dont seed let this peace of shit series die
,jahnee,2011-06-01T14:28Z,philsallsorts if you used your laptop for other things such as gaming and if you downloaded over 100GB of shit every month it's hard to seed all the stuff
,dkent555,2011-06-19T22:29Z,"Thanks mate, great show this is. I'll also seed this permanently (and my mac is on 24/7). I have a 20mbps connection so I'll seed at 5mbps minimum.

P.S: Are you really a toilet sniffer? O.o"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-06-21T18:54Z,"No, I don't really sniff toilets. It's a very old name from years ago that kind of stuck. Look up Martin Edwards on Wikipedia. Ex-Chairman of Manchester United, sold his shares for £80M and then shortly after got arrested for going into women's toilets and sniffing the seats."

P.S: Thanks for the story lol"
,Scottboard,2011-06-28T18:24Z,"Thank you very much! :) I will seed until atleast 1,0 ratio. My internet is very slow so it will take some time."

,aquamanUK,2011-11-11T12:19Z,"Stuck at 50%, with no further torrent available... please re-seed. (nov 2011)"
,bjohahe,2011-11-29T23:30Z,Could people PLEASE seed? I'm downloading at an average of 3 kilobit per second! WOOHOO!!! I feel very nostalgic -_-
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2012-02-04T06:44Z,"I've put this back in my seedbox, it has a 1 gig connection."
,PauloFran,2012-04-01T11:24Z,"Good quality for HDTV.
Thank you!"
,Vetyver02,2012-04-07T23:09Z,"I don't know if you're going to get this message Sniffer, but I'm downloading a lot of your science fiction torrents. You're honestly one of the best torrentors out right now for large scale media devourers like myself. I noticed your main issue was seeding, and I'd love to help be one of those people who keep seeding to offset those hundreds of leechers.

I have 38 gigs uploaded so far, and will continue at my meager 222kb/s upload speed. But I'll keep uploading for a few months. Keep up the good fight!"
,CakeMonster,2012-05-21T18:05Z,"This torrent here is great BUT for those who want Season 1 DVDs with the directors commentaries and DVD stuff go here

It also has an unofficial soundtrack

,serbforce,2012-06-07T19:51Z,"Thanks a lot. Took a while, but worth it. Seeding."
,nutnnut,2012-06-09T14:15Z,"Seeding at 15kbps [yeah its slow]
But i will keep seeding as long as i can"
