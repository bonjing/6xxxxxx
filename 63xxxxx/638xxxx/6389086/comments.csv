,donsje,2011-06-12T23:53Z,"I followed the instructions.
I try starting it up and then it says

'It looks like you have an unofficial game modification that does not match your current version of The Sims 3. We recommend that you either uninstall these game modifications or get updated versions of them - otherwise you may experience crashes or significant bugs.

Do you want to quit?'.

When i try the continue button it says error after it. 

Also when i try using the launcher it says that it has stopped working and then fails."
,new_2334,2011-06-13T01:09Z,You have to update sims 3 using the ea launcher to make it work if you cant then use the files within the vchukkrit to do it manually it is easy and the instructions are in there. It works for me it should work for you.
