Taking the best elements of 1960s bubblegum, pop, and surf music (and even 50s rockabilly at times) and processing them through the most jaded sensibility imaginable, "Psychocandy" is a pivotal album in post-punk history. Classic. Every song is drenched in reverb and the knobs are stuck on ten. The guitars keen like bagpipes, squeal like tires, change into Coltrane-like lines then dissolve in clouds of white noise. Made in 1985, it still sounds fresh.
