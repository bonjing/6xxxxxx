,feartruth,2011-05-11T19:04Z,"Awaiting the DVDRip for Game now (it's too early to ask for I AM or Shor in the City or Chalo Dilli).

SaM, can you let me know if you have got the DVDRip for any of the following: 
1] Monica - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1887817/
2] Madhoshi - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430328/

If you've and you'd share it, I'd highly appreciate it. Even otherwise, thanks for spreading and sharing so much entertainment. Cheers.


P.S. Can anyone please tell me what does ""RC"" stand for in the release title (The Adjustment Bureau 2011 RC BDRip......)? Is it the same as R5?

Sorry for the dumb question, but I hope someone will answer it. TIA. "
