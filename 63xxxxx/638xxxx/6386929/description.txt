Rockets were a French space rock band that formed in Paris in 1974. Some of the former members had played together since 1970 in a local band called Crystal. In their most successful era (1977-1982) the line-up comprised vocalist Christian Le Bartz, bassist and vocalist "Little" GÃ©rard L'Her, guitarist and keyboardist Alain Maratrat, drummer and percussionist Alain Groetzinger, and keyboardist Fabrice Quagliotti went through a number of name changes, being known as Rocket Men and Rok-Etz, among others. In the year 2000 Fabrice Quagliotti decided to reform the band (initially with the name Rockets N.D.P.), but with a totally different line-up. This brought to an anomalous situation, as far as none of the former members agreed to hold a reunion. In fact, the last former member to leave the band was Alain Maratrat, in 1992.
