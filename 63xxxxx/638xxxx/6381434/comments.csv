,GopherTee,2011-05-13T05:52Z,POINTLESS FOR NOW! YOU MUST HAVE 3.6 FIRMWARE FOR THIS GAME!
,GopherTee,2011-05-19T05:30Z,None of you fools read the comments?  126 people and counting going to be dissapointed when this doesn't work!
,Phibz408,2011-05-21T20:25Z,"GopherTee, you are so smart... please teach me how to think....

common sence tells me that once this is patched for use with 3.55 their will be a ton more leechers resulting in a slower download speed.

so it will take you twice as long to dl later... you are a pretty fart smeller."

,Fuqthegovt,2011-06-19T12:27Z,personally I rather just dl slow than get it fast and a patch never comes (bandwidth=$). Only reason infamous 2 was patched same day as release was a million people want it and the crackers got ahold of the original eboot 2 weeks before release.
,Fuqthegovt,2011-06-19T12:29Z,"personally I rather wait til there's an actual patch, if it ever comes. Bandwidth=$"
,Fuqthegovt,2011-06-19T12:29Z,"shit, sry for the dbl posts >"
