Quote:
In \\\"Demon Father John\\\'s Pinwhel Blues, Part 1\\\" Amber Benson (Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\\'s Tara) and Ben craft a tale of a syndicate of vampire street children that is turned upside down by new recruit Pinwheel. In \\\"Shunt, Part 1\\\" Christina Z and Ash present the tale of the perfect woman, who gives up the perfect life to uncover a heinous human slavery ring run by an elite group of vampires. Vampires who transform their beautiful female victims into the most sensually marketable product. Within the torture and depravity lies a twisted tale of obsessive passion and furious loyalty.


Shadowplay was originally slated to be part of the 30 days of night universe like bloodsucker tales but for some reason never came to be. As far as I can tell there are no major differences in canon therefore no reason for it not to be in the universe.
