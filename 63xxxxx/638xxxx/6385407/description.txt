Combining Tom Lehrer with Spike Jones (would that make Tom Jones?) and Nichols and May with Joe Friday (a May weekend perhaps?), musical comedian Stan Freberg skewers everyone from Walt Disney to Cole Porter. Mumbling through "Sh-Boom," Freberg drags "The Great Pretender" snarling to "The Heartbreak Hotel," snares "The Yellow Rose of Texas," and takes Harry Belafonte's famous "Banana Boat" sniffling down Lonnie Donnegan's "Rock Island Line." Along the way, he reveals Little Red Riding Hood's true colors, turns Chicken Little over to a shrink, arrests a dragon for overacting (a "dragonet" -- get it?! Duuumb da-dumb dumb!), and puts Ebeneezer Scrooge in the modern-day business world (not a far stretch!). Musical? Maybe. Funny? Definitely! ~ Matthew Robinson
