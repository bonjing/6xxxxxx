,YaBoyBob87,2011-05-12T22:39Z,Sorry velvet. Didn't mean to step on anyone's toes. My primary purpose for uploading this was for a specific purpose to obtain a copy. I didn't think to check for existing torrents. :(

What this trilogy talks about is the same exact thing as the NWO, ruled by Lucifer. What could be the purpose of this framework? Well, simple enough, to console you all and make it look like some ""bright future of mankind"" so you accept the NWO and give an oath to serve Lucifer and Lucifer only, as all of you will be required to do according to information on record.

Remember this well: without your agreement, the NWO and a rule of Lucifer can not be established as it would be a violation of one of the most fundamental Laws of existence, which is Free Will. If this is done without your explicit agreement, the punishment to those who violated this Law would be more than they bargained for. This is the LAW! Under no conditions whatsoever it can be violated, and they know it really well, no matter what they tell you, deluding and zombifying you all and converting you into biorobots - functional biological machines.

This whole ""paradise on earth without God"" ideology is meant not to free you but to enslave you and in the most drastic and violent ways. If you agree to it, you will sign your own death sentence as it is planned to destroy at least nine tenths of the world population ""to restore the balance with nature"" and create that ""paradise"" for the ""elite"" of parasites to parasite on the fruits of labor of the rest of you - ""slaves"", in a LITERAL sense.

Conceptually, this framework does not make any sense even though some things seem to correspond to reality. Because someone has to rule it and make decision to allocate the resources, to initiate the projects and make all sorts of decisions. It can not just work by itself. Someone has to direct this grand show, and who would that be but not the same biggest and baddest bankers that change their dress to look like some ""elite"" while controlling the world just the same. What do you need money for if you OWN the whole world?

Can you even conceive of an idea of getting rid off the bankers and their deadly grip on the world? HOW? WHO has any power to force them to accept their own bankruptcy unless they are even bigger bankers? You mean the UN? Well, but the UN is their ""back door to enslave the world"", just as Harold Wallace Rosenthal states in his six hour long interview on record. It is them who created the UN in the first place.

If you can understand this and see it, there is no need to even read the rest of this critical review. "
,esotericsophist,2012-05-23T22:20Z,"@Sparx101 You have not written a critical review.  You've written 

a rant. You need to take a course in critical thinking because on 

you're own, you're never going to get there. If you don't, I or 

some other learned person will respond to your intellectual 

graffiti.
You are comparing TZM to the NWO.  You have made a controversial 

claim and you have not cited your sources.  I believe you are 

operating under the flawed assumption that if you type the word 

Lucifer enough times, you can create an association without 

presenting any evidence. Nobody is that stupid! You didn't even 

quote scripture.  The audience has a few idiots that'll lap up 

ever word you say; however, normal people will demand proof.
""Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap"" (King James 

Bible, Galatians 6:7) appears to be compatible or at least, 

similar in quality to Newton's first and third laws of motion: 

""Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in 

that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it"" 

and ""For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction."" 
The book of Galatians is known to predate the work of Newton 

(ck); however, it is inappropriate to make an argument that 

concludes that this temporal relationship settles the debate.  

This would be an example of a ""post hoc ergo propter hoc"" 

fallacy.
From these claims, it follows that there is no such thing as free 

will.  The claim that free will exists is not supported by 

scripture or modern science.  In point of fact, both modern 

scientific texts and the Authorized King James Bible contain 

statements that can only be taken to mean that ""freedom"" is a 

fairy tale.  
	Law doesn't mean much to a person who is systematically 

deprived of the things he needs to survive.  Know why?  Your 

money is fake.  Property rights are a joke. Law is fiction.  It's 

a bunch of fairy tales we tell out children to keep them in line. 
 	Nature is a dictatorship.  This is one of the few facts 

that is truly self-evident; however, if a man has been programmed 

to see ""Lucifer"" in anything that isn't blessed by the religious 

gurus of the day, then no amount of empirical observation will 

lead him to truth.

Where are you getting this fantasy zombie and Borg stuff?  

Resident evil?  Star Trek?  the Matrix?  Get with it man!  Those 

are movies"
