,shayweis,2011-05-10T09:20Z,"the cancellation of this show, shows us all what happened when you let a first grader run a network. but lets face it, tv is not about quality anymore, or about the show's ability to tell a story. its about the money. and with that attitude, i see no reason to keep on following this network's shows. whats the point if they'll cancel it before it even began?"

,apbsommer,2011-05-10T11:37Z,"In 7 hours this episode has >13,000 seeds. Perhaps syfy should reevaluate the interest this show has generated. Or another station can pick up the rights and syfy can continue to embarrass themselves with new episodes of wwe smackdown."
,.Mystery.,2011-05-10T12:25Z,"For everyone basing their conclusions of why this show gets so much hype on TPB yet wonder why SyFy cancelled the show you misunderstood some key factors. 
A blogger pointed out one of the reason SGU was doing poorly was because it's target audience was the much younger much more tech savvy demographic. Since so many users (Like me and you. Yes, you) rather pirating the show to the alternative of waiting for it to come on TV or simply to avoid advertising or for what ever reason, TV ratings (The ones that matter in making money) drop considerably. 

Pirating is a powerful medium, i would be both a hypocrite and an idiot to demand you stop doing it but if you enjoy something, buy it (Err, watch it).   

Also i hate to be the one that ruins everything (Everything...) But the show wan cancelled what like 6 months ago, the staff and crew have been released of their contracts (I believe one of the actors said this themselves) in order to get them all back is quite close to impossible, i guess they could write it in for spoiler-us reasons.   "
,WileyAnon,2011-05-10T12:29Z,"Sad to see SGU end. Having watched and loved SG1 & Stargate Atlantis, I looked forward to SGU starting, but I was in the beginning a little put off by it's slow start. Seemed like it was destined to become another ""Eastenders in Space"" style of show, much like what happened with BSG.

Then, then, it picked up and got very interesting, and yes, along with Fringe, is, or was, one of the best shows on TV currently.

I suppose, being a show that attracts geeks, who will download instead of watching on TV, we may have actually contributed to it's demise by downloading, instead of viewing on-air to generate audience numbers...

At any rate, RIP SGU, you will be missed."

,zingo_punkbuzter,2011-05-10T15:57Z,"Shit... so this is the end?
I don't think so... This series was about getting the ship to a place beyond everything we call ""space"". They didn't reach their destination.. which i thought they would give us as this would be the last one. but no... they didn't. i don't think this is the end. just like many other shows that says they are gonna quit, but they come back.
They just say it to make the ""comeback"" even bigger.
That's what hope anyway...
I remember... The first Stargate movies. It was awsome!

Here i give you the links to the movies that has been made since 1994 ( non-series )

Yes views but they are counting it from their channel not piratebay from where they earn no profit than a simple thanks.

If you really like it...you should have got syfy and watched it from their channel.

Though i'm not a perfect example(dl'd all the episodes)

But the fact is i have syfy but it's some russian crap that is showing season 1 so nowhere near the season 2.But i watch season 1 there"
,brdavs,2011-05-10T19:43Z,"One has to point out that a lot of ""pirating"" of shows is going on by people that dont have access to syfi even if they wanted to subscribe. 

Atleast thats the case in my country. Chanel not available on iptv or cable (not sure how the satelite situation is) so pirating is the only possible way."

,fdhypno,2011-05-10T21:19Z,"The problem here in Europe is that we cannot watch the show unless we download it or wait for yet another year. They claim this is because they need subtitles or some other bullshit, but who in for instance the Nordic countries does not know English at the age where you watch TV-Series?

Give us the damn episodes the same day as in US/Canada, and you will find you get these 10000 leechers and 20000 seeders in per torrent actually watching it on TV. The same goes for each and every other series.

Conclusion; no we are not the ones to blame, but rather the poor kid at school who brings down the average rating of the class only because the teacher wont give him/her the attention he needs."

How exactly do you think a network knows what you watch?  I'll give you a hint: they're not monitoring your tv.  I'm not going to further educate you on how it's done.  Read about how it's done and stop being retarded.

I hope they realize their mistake and bring the show back."

This can't be the last episode D: I sincerely hope that they continue with the show, but they most likely will make a movie instead. This tv series is the most amazing and spectacular thing I have ever had the honor of watching. I will cry when it is all finally over. I wish SGU would have lasted as long as SGA or SG1."

That doesn't make sense!
I watch it on TV when it gets here.  With friends and/or family usually. Don't dodge the ads more than any other show.
And I get the DVD's, looks shelf with boxed sets of Stargate SG1 & Atlantis. All of Startrek. Sliders, Num5ers, House, Buffy & Angel,Andromeda, Firefly, Quantum Leap, Supernatural, and misc others.  (but not yucky modern BSG :(  )
 Who do you think buys the DVDs?? People who care enough to download.    Just because their 50year old wornout misused advertising system doesn't work, there's no need to dump the bait (good shows), they just have to learn how to market it properly (and hopefully before the internet signal to noise gets inefficient and expensive - looking at the crappy ads on the TPB page for stuff there's no way on earth I'd be seen dead buying, let alone part with mi hard earned readies.  Do Not Want.)"

I always by the DVD set of sci-fi shows and would watch them again on TV. I'd subscribe to ScyFy channel too, if I wasnt so sick of these fuckwitts giving me no END to a bloody story. 

If they cancel this show for good and V doesnt start back up, I'll NEVER watch another TV show again!!!... whats the fucking point of a story with NO FUCKING ENDING!!!

BAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

Still not forgiven em for stopping Farscape, but atleast they gave us an ending."

,buketsful,2011-05-13T10:05Z,what a crap ending to a good tv program told us fuk all what happened to them all. soft arse americans couldnt be bothered  again just put them all to sleep and call this the end of the program wtf are you 4 real worst end to a tv program i have ever seen how can you leave it like that with so much still to happen and as 4 them not making the money is bull shit you have adverters every 5 mins in america 
,buketsful,2011-05-13T10:19Z,also you lot are banging on about them not making the money well over hear in uk we only have aderverts every 15 mins and all of are tv companies are doing fine well making millions and you say america who have ads every 5 mins cant make money your talking out of your arse plus the people who do actually do download this are the fukin people that are most likly to go buy the dvds but will i like fuk buy with that ending you americans need to learn to make a fukin ending
,B.Genaaid,2011-05-13T20:04Z,"The worst possible ending ever, total lack of fantasy and just ending without an end. Oh and according to the Fan site, the planned movies are canceld as well so there will not even be an ending in a movie.
I downloaded these episodes all because I can't wait for the DVD to come. But... when it would come I would buy it.... but NOT NOW anymore. only if they will end the series properly, then I might maybe perhaps buy the DVD boxset.
First season just came to store here, asked the guy why he sells something that will not be finished, he did not even know... MAFIAA is what I say. pure robbery"
,Bob__Dole,2011-05-17T22:05Z,"Kids, you did kill the show and here is why:
They determine viewership by Nielson households watching. Sci-fi shows are liked by tech savvy people who are more likely to get shows from torrents so the network showing them has fewer realtime viewers than they want in order to get advertisers to pay a lot for commercials.  It doesn't matter if you would buy the product, advertisers pay based on viewers seeing the commercial."

,Kilotone,2011-05-20T07:38Z,"Look guys there's been a LOT of conjecture over this series & even more blame being thrown around as to who's responsible for it being axed.

The first season (@ LEAST half of it) was a pathetic drama based plot line trying (in vain) to develop characters alone (apparently the writers had prepared for a 5 year storyline) instead of focusing on MISSIONS as all other SG series have.

I've been watching SG since it began & i've seen them all (even animated) & i can honestly say i will miss star gate universe more than atlantis (there's only so many times i can handle ""Voyagers emergency medical hologram"" being in charge) & WTF was with the second last ep in vegas (i'd love to torture the gimp that came up with that idea in turn RUINING the final ep for SGA)

I'm sure just like the rest of you have said this ending was abrupt & poorly handled, i'm not going to even TRY justify this last ep it's not the worst ending they could've done but still OMG it's just criminal that the LAST thing to go through the star gate was a fcuking keyno sled full of damn ROCKS!!!!!!!!! WTF????!!!!!!!

That being said tho i want you to open your minds, eyes & ears a little a lay blame where it belongs.

The ONLY reason this season was cancelled was because they lost their viewer base within the first season...........second season was redeeming but just too damn late.

Torrents/downloads/posts/opinions DID NOT kill this show.

THE WRITERS DID with the BS character focus."
,Shoodaben,2011-05-24T05:26Z,"Forgive me for doing this here.  I don't know where else to write it.  Torrents have nothing to do with this show's cancellation any more than any other show.  It was doomed from the start.  I loved SG-1.  When they cancelled it I broke all ties with the sci-fi channel.  I was slightly enamored with Atlantis, but I didn't miss it so much when it was gone.  With each attempt they get worse.  The sad part is that Universe had serious potential.  What destroyed it is the fact that the writers concentrated on too much character study.  Yes, it's necessary to care about the characters, but too much and you end up with a show for one of those women's channels.  When you combine that with the fact that sci-fi is run by a bunch of ignorant suits that think wrestling and ghost hunting belong in the sci-fi genre, you get the end of a series.  Like everyone else, these guys are in business to make money.  They're making less and less money because they're making poorer and poorer decisions.  These guys are pumping out crap like the turd monster versus the hyperbolic nymphomaniac of doom at an astounding rate.  Their only concern is the advertising dollar.  At least one person on the writing staff was thinking ahead however.  There may be hope.  Putting them in stasis and waiting on them to get to the next galaxy is the perfect pause to give a more insightful production company a chance to re-introduce the series on a different and more insightful network.  The series has great potential.  I'd have like to seen it done with a little less emotional fluff.  Know that this cancellation pushes the sci-fi channel ever closer to it's inevitable demise.  Perhaps then someone will start a station that actually contains science fiction instead of wrestling and beginners attempts at 3d animation.  It's the suit's fault.  Not torrents."
,pimpmobile,2011-05-30T04:43Z,"Shoodaben is right this series was screwed from the git go all this series was, was a soap opera that talked about feeling and relationships!  This was not scifi as to the so called SyFy that chanel has gone down hill with their crap!"
,CaptainBeefheart314,2011-06-23T18:32Z,"Wow so many opinions... here's mine: torrenting this can't be the only reason for the show's demise, say rather that the general public likes its SciFi shows to be obvious and shallow... point in fact are many of the comments I've read here: missions this, action that... you do realise that's what hollowed out every scifi canon since the dawn of time don't you? I liked SG.U because it bridges the gap between scifi action and scifi humanism. And yeah, I hate the cliffhanger too, but actually it wraps up rather nice, with that major decision from Eli hanging over its head... a noble gesture to go out on, although now everybody's gonna be fretting about whether they all come out of it alive, or if they'll ever find their ""message from god"" - type thing :-)
Oh well... let's see what happens, Firefly got its wrapup movie thanks to massive Browncoat support, how about Gaters getting into the spirit and attempting to coax the franchise into a closing-deal movie? I mean hey, if they allowed for the complete nonsense that is ""The Arc of Truth"" in order to close the Ori storyline (really a bad, BAD film, and I'm understating here) then the least they can do is give us closure for the various SG.U storyarcs.
Just sayin' :-D"
