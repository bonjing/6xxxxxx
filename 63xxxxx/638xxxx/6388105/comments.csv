,xoferbean,2011-06-21T22:29Z,Boooooo! Crap EZTV. Thought you were supposed to be good. This ain't ripped properly. It cuts out and all you can hear is the dialogue whilst the previous scene plays visually. Please check before uploading and @feetback please check before commenting and giving it 10/10. Pointless waste of time.
