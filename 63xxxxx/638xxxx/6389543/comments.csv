,laned130,2011-12-17T13:21Z,"@DJPidu - Win7 Enterprise and Ultimate are identical (this was not true for Vista).

@Gonz - SKU stands for Stock Keeping Unit, and is what MS uses to differentiate between individual products on their parts lists.

@Firekick - many thanks for the up! P.S. it's nice of you to include the MD5 etc., but FYI torrents have built-in hash checks anyway. Also, I clicked on your name, to see what other torrents you had upped, and it doesn't list any - not even this one! Don't know if this is an issue with your account, or TPB search engine.

Also, does anyone know if these are FPP (retail), OEM, MVL (volume licensing), or MSDN copies - so I know what keys I need?

This is reported as S/L of 2/0, but I currently see 55/92."
