An engineer creates the ultimate weapon in a battle against aliens, only to be suspected as an alien himself. Second in a three-part anthology on relationships between humans and aliens. 
In 2079, Spencer Olham (Gary Sinise) had a perfect life: a loving
family and a beautiful wife, Maya (Madeleine Stowe). On Tuesday
evening he went to bed an acclaimed and well-respected scientist. On
Wednesday morning, he woke up public enemy number one.

The Earth has been at war with an alien force for over a decade.
Spencer is a lauded governmental scientist whose latest work promises
to save the planet. But suddenly he is accused of being an alien spy,
and becomes the subject of a nationwide manhunt. Olham is faced with a
two-tiered dilemma - can he prove his identity to the secret police in
time to help mankind? Can he ultimately prove his identity to
himself?
