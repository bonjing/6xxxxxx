,cb8709,2011-05-16T02:57Z,"I put it on my flashdrive and installed, but the save is not on my game?"
,elresfrio,2011-05-17T00:54Z,"Weird, try once more. I have given this save to my friends through a memory stick, worked like a dream. Maybe you should try that instead? I'm not an expert on flash drives and memory sticks, but it might solve the problem. For further notice, this is for PS3 (just in case you did not notice)."
,cb8709,2011-05-18T07:44Z,IK its for ps3!!! LOl
,elresfrio,2011-05-18T20:05Z,"I assumed you already knew. This save was saved on slot 1, so if you have a save at slot 1 try the following:

1. When in-game save at for instance slot 2 or 4.
2. Delete the slot 1 save.
3. Copy my save.

This might solve your problem."
