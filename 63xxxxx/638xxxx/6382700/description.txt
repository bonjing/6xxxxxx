"Baby Monitor"

When Hope's baby monitor picks up their 
neighbors' conversations, Burt and Virginia 
go out of their way to meet the troubled 
couple (guest stars Jaime Pressly and Ethan 
Suplee) and try to help their marriage. 
Meanwhile, Howdy's Market has the entire 
community, including baby Hope and Maw Maw, 
involved in a commercial competition with a 
rival store.

Enjoy :)
