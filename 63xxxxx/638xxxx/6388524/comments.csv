@atak_sanjpera: One should be noted as regular before placing the requests, I mean, one can, so can I turn blind eye on it.

However, Once Upon a Time in the West can fly, if I find BluRay, Mr. Smith can't..."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-13T15:55Z,"@atak_sanjpera: BluRay was announced to be released in May 2010, but only HDTV version is available today. In cases of old movies and especially well known Italian inability to achieve decent filming and post-production - HDTV seems as reasonable choice. Unless you want to search for some existing DVDrip."

It IS a good movie.  The book was even better.  It is somewhat LDS-centric though, which may limit its market appeal."

[V],twentyforty,2011-05-14T08:42Z,"@mao789: Charly 2002 was requested last week and I tried to get it back than. Sorely, I got only a copy with missing four minutes in middle of the movie, and no one have good one."
