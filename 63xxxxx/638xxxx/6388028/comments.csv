,bglamb,2011-05-13T14:19Z,Another fake.
,Nivius,2011-05-13T15:06Z,"bglamb, any chance you might understand that its maybe just... you?!

all versions on tpb works, they are otherwise deleted pretty fast

then again some are just different versions.
this is the same version as the 1.0.0.0 one, but there are no added installers for .net or xna.

basically, same version pbat used when he couldn't find stars."
,poorbots,2011-05-13T15:13Z,:/.......
,swankles,2011-05-13T17:12Z,"Im having trouble getting this to work, it crashes immediately. is there anything else i need to do besides extracting it?"
,brandonlol,2011-05-13T17:16Z,this works just delete a few files and its playable. saves work too. falling stars dont appear for me though. :( i wil be buying this just cuz there will be so many updates. and i wanna support.
,brandonlol,2011-05-13T17:16Z,this works. saves work too. falling stars dont appear for me though. :( i will be buying this just cuz there will be so many updates. and i wanna support.
,Duhya2,2011-05-13T18:25Z,"I had a version that didnt work but i got this one and it works if you have the 4.0 XNA shit installed.
If you do not have that then get it from here: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9ac86eca-206f-4274-97f2-ef6c8b1f478f

I am trying to make sure some people can get the REAL leak instead of those damn fucking virus' scattered over the web."
,brandonlol,2011-05-13T22:24Z,"the other one that was posted that said beta on it, i got that one to work, idk why it was removed..."
,Duhya2,2011-05-13T22:58Z,"The beta one does not work for all people.
The one here works on most of my friend's PCs so 
i decided to remove the other one so everyone gets a version that works."
,Duhya2,2011-05-14T01:34Z,This torrent is now the only Terraria alpha download on TPB. It seems someone removes every single one that isn't mine.
,Duhya2,2011-05-14T01:35Z,"Sorry nvm im AM BACON 
and have no clue whats going on. lol"
,dbee16,2011-05-14T16:37Z,"so the 1.0.0.0 one is the exact same as this one? 
except without framework? "
,rpg500e,2011-05-14T18:31Z,OOOOO someone deletin all the torrentssss haha

,mahyaz96,2011-05-14T21:51Z,"also,stars don't appear on large size worlds,dunno about medium.also,there are no dungeons."
,Duhya2,2011-05-14T22:42Z,"You do not need to remove any files to play the game.
The other torrent had a virus."
,Casaundra,2011-05-14T23:02Z,It crashes no matter what I do. How do I play this?
,brandonlol,2011-05-14T23:33Z,"wait, what virus did it have? cuz i am using the other one and i havent seen a virus and the game works fine."

,Figinator,2011-05-15T00:59Z,"Is it just me, or does it take really long to load?"
,Figinator,2011-05-15T01:10Z,"Agh, it wont even boot up, i double-click and then nothing happens. Help?"

,christonian,2011-05-15T04:47Z,"i cant get a merchant for the life of me i have like 4 rooms(1 already for guide uses) lots of gold and other stuff

played probably 3hrs+ on lvl

big world build if that helps"
,Daidraco,2011-05-15T06:19Z,Whats your IP man? Id love to see what its like with other people.
,draxlt,2011-05-15T09:20Z,"christonian
I have 3 rooms, every with full walls, background walls, torches, chandelliers, tables and chairs, doors and still no merchant. I think this version doesn't have NPCs"
,shadsy,2011-05-15T11:48Z,"NPCs work perfectly. 
So far tested helper, merchant, nurse and demolitions expert. Waiting for Weapons expert.

The first gun you get you have to find, either in a chest or by smashing a shadow orb. Then the salesman moves in and you get more options.

Dungeon also works, i've got a green one and tried beating the skeleton twice so far with no luck.

Hell world works, as does corruption and shadow orbs + meteor stuff.

For NPC's make sure you meet the requirement before you make the room or else there's a chance they may not recognize it. So, first get 50 silver, THEN make a room complete with back wall, source of light (torches will do) 1 table and 1 chair. 

The only bug i've found so far other than the falling star problem is that at one point it spawned two of the same merchant for me, but i had loads of extra rooms so it's not a big deal."
,shadsy,2011-05-15T11:50Z,"P.S: Stone walls don't count as viable background walls, nor does dirt. It has to be wood or the different tipes of brick, NOT stone wall. "
,ZeroFr3aK,2011-05-15T13:00Z,"When i try to run the ""Terraria.exe"" file nothing happens... help please."

,lycanwarrior,2011-05-15T15:50Z,can some1 tell me how to get it working it just crashes every time i start it plzz tell me how to start this thing plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
,Vidiot58,2011-05-15T18:47Z,"To get this to work you have to delete all the files in the folder with the file extension "".cdf-ms"" I figured this out because the previous version of the game that this guy uploaded did not have these files and it worked fine. For example: ""terraria.exe.cdf-ms"" is one of them."
,Ubes,2011-05-15T18:48Z,"ANYONE WHO CANNOT GET MERCHANT MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE FOLLOWING:
1.Door
2.Table
3.Chair
4.Light Source
5.Recieved 50 Silver
6. All of the background wall is filled in and no pieces are missing
7. Make sure the guide isnt living in it 
Need more information or answers just send me an email at aaronbot@gmail.com hope i helped"

,Someone4956,2011-05-16T02:56Z,"Yeah, so it crashes every time you try to join a server, so to those trying to host a game, I doubt you'll get anyone."
,Duhya2,2011-05-16T05:16Z,"It does not crash everytime, try 2 or 3 times and you will get in. I have been playing online the last 3 days."
,EliteASH_11,2011-05-16T07:24Z,"So this doesnt work on laptops, but will the proper release work?"
,Strikefear13,2011-05-16T09:37Z,Works fine on laptops.  You're doing something wrong.  Read the comments or wait for the proper release today.
,dbee16,2011-05-16T11:33Z,"@Duhya2 same, what hamachi netwoprk you in?"
,deviantdigi,2011-05-16T13:26Z,"Scanned clean AVG 2011, sandboxie clear. Runs great on Win7 32 bit after installing Visual and XNA 4.

Thanks for the ups Du and seeders"
,AudioBox145,2011-05-16T18:08Z,There is 2 problems the goblin army wont stop coming.and i cant play multiplayer 
,deviantdigi,2011-05-16T18:20Z,"After quite sometime and restarting the game. I have gotten a AVG 2011 notification for the Terraria.exe.

Threat name Unknown
security level 4
No description

the infection is either a conflict or is crypted. I haven't seen any suspicious background processes, yet."
,deviantdigi,2011-05-16T21:18Z,"No one else got a infection notification? 

Be cautious , kind of a generic infectious torrent with tags like ""real"" and up loader only having 1 upload total. 
"
,Duhya2,2011-05-16T21:30Z,"Deviant, people have been playing this torrent for days and the comments are mostly good, i have no viruses either."
,Duhya2,2011-05-16T21:34Z,"It works on laptops that have a directx 9 or above graphics card, the laptops i tried it on all got errors saying something about the graphics card."
,FerocityX,2011-05-16T23:28Z,I have a server that doesn't require Hamachi if anyone wants to come join us. The address is 173.81.44.75. The most people we've had on at once was 6.
,iGotaPistola,2011-05-17T00:26Z,It doesn't even start up for me. Anyone else have the same problem?  Windows 7 64bit
,TheNonFlyZ,2011-05-17T00:42Z,What should i drive it with ?
,Luxas-kun,2011-05-17T01:17Z,"I've got the problem of not being able to create any kind of Hammers. Axes, etc etc, I can make. But no hammers at all."
,Duhya2,2011-05-17T03:54Z,"Everyone download the Theta terraria torrent, it is the latest steam release and works from my experience. This torrent is outdated."
,Timmi245,2011-05-17T06:28Z,"I wasn't so sure myself but I took the risk of opening it. It's safe and clean.

You will find ""Terraria.exe"" in the ""t-terra1"" archive. It's a custom installation and that's probably why it looks so damn dodgy.

So I say again CLEAN and SAFE. Now to try it out and make sure it's bug-free."
,Momssi,2011-05-18T14:40Z,Doesn't work :S when i try to run it it crashes.
,Duhya2,2011-05-20T00:32Z,"Do not download this, it is outdated. Download the THETA release and install it, it works and is virus free. DOITFAGGOT!"
