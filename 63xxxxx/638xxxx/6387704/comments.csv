We are the legal rightsholders of this documentary. You have uploaded the entire film to make it available to everyone in the world, which is illegal. 

We are urging you to take the film off immediately, otherwise we have to take immediate legal actions against you. You have 24 hours to do so.

On behalf of the filmmakers,

SND Films, Amsterdam"
,ZeTomes,2011-05-20T03:30Z,"I will for sure, my intention is to divulgate this amazing documentary, not profit with it, so people can buy it since it was recorded from tv and it has portuguese subtitles incorporated.

But first you have to prove me you're the alleged SND films rightsolders of the documentary - of course you'll understand that it's not just by posting with an ambiguous piratebay account that I will take it for granted.

You can contact me here (tasfastas@hotmail.com)"
