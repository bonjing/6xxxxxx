Storyline:Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage), a retired master car thief, is forced to return to Los Angeles, California and his former trade to steal 50 cars in 72 hours for British crime boss Raymond "The Carpenter" Calitri (Christopher Eccleston). Raymond is threatening to kill Memphis' younger brother, Kip (Giovanni Ribisi), in his car compactor, after Kip and his associates did not make the deadline to deliver the stolen cars. Memphis quickly reassembles his old crew including his mentor Otto (Robert Duvall), former girlfriend Sway (Angelina Jolie), former colleagues Donny (Chi McBride) and Sphinx (Vinnie Jones), and some of his younger brother's associates. With LAPD Detective Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and his partner, Detective Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant), breathing down his neck, Memphis decides to steal all the cars in one night to avoid tipping off the cops. Stealing the cars en masse the night before the deadline, Memphis is forced to change the plan midstream when he realizes Castlebeck is onto them, deciding to steal three of the cars from the police impound lot. Discovering the 'shopping list' from Kip's earlier job, Castlebeck predict that Memphis will save one particular car, the 1967 Shelby Mustang GT 500, or codename "Eleanor", for last; Memphis had unsuccessfully tried to steal the car numerous times. When he catches Memphis in the act of stealing it, a high-speed chase ensues through Long Beach. This concludes with a high-risk jump over a traffic jam on the Vincent Thomas Bridge.
