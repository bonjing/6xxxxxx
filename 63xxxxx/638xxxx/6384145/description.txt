With DESTROYED, Moby introduces the listener to the strange and disconcerting life of touring that is not often exposed; the time spent isolated in anonymous, mundane hotel rooms, airports, and backstage waiting areas. These experiences are then juxtaposed with moments of intense beauty and excitement,such as the connection that can be felt with an audience. All of the songs on DESTROYED were written by Moby on the road during the small hours of the night, when his insomnia was in full tilt. The silent urban nightscapes provided much inspiration for this album.
