Description:
Machete Maidens Unleashed! is the first detailed examination
and celebration of Filipino genre filmmaking. From the early
'70s well into the '90s the Philippines was a back-lot for a bevy
of renegade B movie makers and cinema visionaries alike. The
country was utilised for its inexpensive labour, exotic locations
and distinct lack of rules. A tidal schlock-wave of genre work
emerged that somehow managed to capture the raw, chaotic
energy of contemporary Filipino culture. These productions (a
cavalcade of monster movies, jungle prison films,
blaxploitation and kung fu hybrids) were miraculously made at
a time when the country's political situation was repressive at
best. This was a revolution that even the Marcos dictatorship
couldnt crush!
