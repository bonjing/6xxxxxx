It was Jordan who formed BMH back in 1989.He had played in a Punk Band from Boston which first formed in 1977 called The Transplants.Lenny played in one of Portland\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s First Punk Bands The Technicians.Skummy had played in Skull 69 and he started playing in bands back in the late 60\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s.A Punk Band needed to be formed up here that would keep the spirit of free speech alive in a sea of Conformity.Yes Portland is a small city but rest assured BMH does what it can to shake up the community and keep Punk alive.       Punks Not Dead !!!   We have done    Public TV Shows  with Bands playing.............. Underground Home Made Films and lots of Beer Parties.
