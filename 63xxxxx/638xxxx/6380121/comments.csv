,wistful_herbz,2011-05-10T05:18Z,"utorrent shows 0 out of 37 seeders, why is it so hard for some people to seed what they download, And for those that don't know Just pause your download when its done copy and paste the file then resume. It's not that hard "
,10001101,2011-05-10T06:33Z,I've been wondering what has been happening.  The past few days torrent speeds are getting worse and worse for me.  And now things are pathetic.  But I look at the peer list and everyone is the same.  Are there just too many things being seeded now?  I thought my ISP was throttling me or is trying to cap my usage.
