Capital, Volume I is the first of three volumes in Karl Marxâ€™s monumental work, Das Kapital, and the only volume to be published during his lifetime, in 1867.

Marxâ€™s aim in Capital, Volume I is to uncover and explain the laws specific to the capitalist mode of production and of the class struggles rooted in these capitalist social relations of production. Marx said himself that his aim was â€œto bring a science [i.e. political economy] by criticism to the point where it can be dialectically representedâ€, and in this way to â€œreveal the law of motion of modern societyâ€. By showing how capitalist development was the precursor of a new, socialist mode of production, he aimed to provide a scientific foundation for the modern labour movement. In preparation for his book, he studied the economic literature available in his time for a period of twelve years, mainly in the British Museum in London.
