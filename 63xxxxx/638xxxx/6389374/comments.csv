[V],twentyforty,2011-05-13T19:25Z,"Thank you guys. 

You are my inspiration, Killjoy88."
,gavin12,2011-05-13T19:55Z,"Awesome 20-40. Could you do a 360p if possible, but any will do of http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0326429/ a brilliant film.
Thanks so much, a true hero"
[V],DownTYU,2011-05-13T19:57Z,"Herr twentyforty did a TOOOOOO BIGG and TOO SMALL RIP of the series.

Got the first three in DVD...Thnx anyways"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-13T20:09Z,"LOL. One is too big, other one too small... how is that even possible? ROFL"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-13T20:51Z,"@gavin12: Should it be 360p because of iPod/Nokia compatibility? I can, but I rather be not ""restrained"" by that. If you meant ""small-size"" - tell me what size should it be. I can make both ways."
,rajmxxx,2011-05-13T20:52Z,I have got this Quadrology in 8.92 GB blu ray. And you did this in just 1.29 GB. You are God 20-40. 
,dark_defender,2011-05-13T21:07Z,"dark_defender at 2011-05-13 01:30 CET:

""I have just got a 40"" LED, and now when i compare 720p encodes from various uploaders that i used to download earlier, it turns out that the ones from 20-40 are best. Let alone 1080p.On smaller screens you will not find much difference. But if you are collecting movies(Bluray or HD) like i do, you have got to think for the future(big screen). So, now i only download from him and preferably 720p.

Without meaning offence to any uploader as i respect them for what they put in, but even in encodes of uploader like YIFY, pixelation is there.""
But 20-40 encodes are clean as a whistle."
[V],DownTYU,2011-05-13T21:26Z,"@ twentyforty

LOL No It will take 24 hrs to download Re Evil 720p full set SO its a big torrent for me

And Blu ray rip to 300 mb is a treat SO I'm calling it small

Love ur work"
,gavin12,2011-05-13T22:38Z,@20-40 Well I only suggested 360p due to it being the biggest iPod compatible resolution but whatever you think is best and easiest would be amazing. Thanks again
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-14T00:34Z,Thanks for this small footprint encode.
,davux,2011-05-14T04:56Z,This is amazing. I'm replacing my dvdrip collection with this one. Thank you again 2040.. +1 as always
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-14T08:00Z,"@puplone: Do you read the torrent title or read poster? ""Afterlife"" was released as standalone BluRay only.
One CANNOT put two posters on upload page - you know that much.

BTW, should I include games too?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-14T08:17Z,"@@gavin12: Thank you for reply. Problem is that movie is dubbed on English - and I cannot get German disk.
Is it OK? I don't like it, but I can't do anything else."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-14T10:57Z,"@puplone: Cartoons is the real name. 

Regarding .idx/.sub - only way is to open .idx in SubResync, choose exact FPS, when main window is open choose ""Save As..."", in lower drop-down list choose Subripper .srt as output format, in line below write output name and press ""Save"".

Old MicroDVD .sub conversion can be done using Subtitle Workshop - just Open, change input and output fps if needed, then Save As  SubRip....

That's it."
,sadhu19,2011-05-14T11:01Z,"@twenty-forty,
i am a great fan of your uploads and regular for more than a year now.quality in small size is superb.
i was searching ""the blair witch project"" and couldn't find any decent HD upload.i would request yo to include this movie in your upload list.
thank you

IMDB rating:6.7/10

[V],twentyforty,2011-05-14T11:02Z,"...""main window is open"" 
add: choose desired output language from drop-down list and
...""choose ""Save As...""

Sorry."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-14T11:13Z,"@puplone: ^^^^

@sadhu19: On TPB you can find three HiDef rips, from small scorp to HDcinema. I wont do that movie in any format above BluRay 480p. Sorry."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-14T11:47Z,"@puplone: Great! If TPB ""Edit"" wasn't broken for months - I would ripped you off in a second.
Sorely, I am to busy to play with Photoshop anymore,  even if that may take two minutes only.

And - nobody but 37 souls have actually read nor peek in properly, thousands just hit ""DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT"" and nothing more."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-14T11:53Z,"Gee, guy knows Photoshop! 
^_^"
,sadhu19,2011-05-14T12:09Z,"by HD i meant your usual 480 or 720p versions. i requested because the 720p scorp version that is available is as good as dead no seeders. and all other HD versions are above 4GB.
so if you could upload it in 480p that will be great 
you can club it with your TV show pack in future i can wait."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-14T12:46Z,"@sadhu19: OK then. 480p. Next week inside TV pack - I have no free slots for next week and how it looks, I cannot support (financially) one unlimited (movies only) anymore. Well, getting back is not so bad, I guess."
,sadhu19,2011-05-14T13:02Z,"thanx a lot bro!!!!!
understand your concerns. .. .. . "
,sadhu19,2011-05-14T13:03Z,"thanx a lot bro!
i understand your concerns."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-14T14:21Z,"@puplone: Double click on one of the lines at beginning and then near the end. If you see same shift on both, do Edit>Timing>Set delay ... choose + or - for all lines.
Best way to manually readjust subtitles is Edit>Timings>Adjust and enter exact times for first and last line, got from playback window. Sometime lines at the end (often signature of maker) or similar must be deleted before. Good thing is to find one good subtitle and work from there."
,the_shroud,2011-05-14T16:00Z,She's sooo hot
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-14T18:50Z,"@sadhu19: Be aware of ridiculous quality of amateurish filming with plain video camera (keep in mind when was shot) - IMHO good for VHS only - and releasing that title on BluRay is pure and simple - stupid.
Making 720p or 1080p is even more stupid. Burning 4 or 6.6 GB is - act of morons.
Especially because transfer on BR is completely and endlessly done wrong - aspect-ratio from original (1.44) is ""widened"" to modern 1.77. ALL BluRay rips have such completely wrong aspect ratio.
Therefore I said  ""480p only"". That is good enough."
,gavin12,2011-05-14T21:52Z,"@20-40 German with hardcoded Eng subs is ideal, but whatever you can do would be awesome :)
Thanks 20-40"
,sadhu19,2011-05-15T02:01Z,"@twenty-forty,
totally agree with you mate. As the film is shot by 16mm camera and a Hi8 video camera so not much difference between 1080 or 720 or 480p.
so 480p will work very well."
,believenu,2011-05-15T02:25Z,thank you. seeding is sharing.
