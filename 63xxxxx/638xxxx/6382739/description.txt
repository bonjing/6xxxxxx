 proverbial end of their ropes with one another. Set in Atlanta during
 the 2008 Presidential Election season, Breaking Up Is Hard To Do is the
 touching story of what happens when two people feel they have nothing
 more to give to a relationship. A funny and intimate look at how people
 fall in love and what it takes to stay there, Breaking Up Is Hard To Do
 touches on the reality of the outside forces that can make or break a
 relationship. They say the truth will set you free, but when Shonda and
 Vince are armed with the truth, will they use it to set themselves free
 for once and for all?
