,xk3nvel0x,2011-05-11T15:24Z,"P.S:
Please use my setups for install the Uniblue products, because i think that you copy the wrong serial or use another setup who is another version.
This serials are only for Uniblue Products 2011 !!!! "

thanks"
,gario666,2011-05-12T19:43Z,does not work tried like 5 times u have a new serial #?
,xk3nvel0x,2011-05-14T11:48Z,"For all who have problems with RegistryBooster serial, try these:

RB-NQ523-BJAL7-LFLWA-N4BTP-29E4N-NNWFC 

RB-T5Q5J-TLUEE-8A4TE-9KTJ5-8FADX-BUBRG

Or this method:

1) install (dont allow internet access)
2) open regedit
3) open find window Check all options including ""Match the whole String""
4) search for ""FC"" (without Quotes) it will be like
eg. ""HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Wow6432Node\CLSID\{16202563-2579-3429-2ff3-452b757a0104}"" for 64 bit
""HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{16202563-2579-3429-2ff3-452b757a0104}"" for 32 bit
5) right click in the empty space below ""FC""
6) New > string value
7) name it ""License"" with ""RB-T5Q5J-TLUEE-8A4TE-9KTJ5-8FADX-BUBRG"" as its value/Data
8) Quit Registry Booster from the system tray
9) restart it.

Or

Create a notepad file with this content:
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{66135455-2579-3429-2ff3-452b757a0104}]
""License""=""RB-T5Q5J-TLUEE-8A4TE-9KTJ5-8FADX-BUBRG""
save file as RegistryBooster2011.reg with .reg extension not .txt (default notepad extension)
and open it with 2x click

If you need more help please post a comment
When you enter serial please disconnect from the internet (unplug network cable)"
,xk3nvel0x,2011-05-14T11:52Z,"Or this method:

1) install (dont allow internet access)
2) register with ""RB-T5Q5J-TLUEE-8A4TE-9KTJ5-8FADX-BUBRG""
3) it will say it needs net access & will give u a manual register link, click it
4) it will open webpage with a download link of a ""register_uniblue_product.reg"" file
5) download it & run it.
6) Quit Registry Booster from the system tray
7) restart it.
Done. Enjoy....."
