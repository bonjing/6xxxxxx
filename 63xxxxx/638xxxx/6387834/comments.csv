[T],iamgreat,2011-10-17T13:00Z,":(  The first episode has been altered to include a promotion for Kablam!!!'s collections of complete seasons at the start of the file. Then there is a promo for The Chicago Code. And one for FRINGE. That takes up nearly the first 6 minutes of the playing time of the file. Then there is the episode of Nikita, reencoded. And after that is a promo for Breakout Kings that takes up the last 3 minutes of the not-quite-51-minute file.  All this in a 353MB file? Sadly, not a joke. Result = the first episode looks like crap. Get it anywhere else if you want scene quality. The rest of the files appear to be unaltered scene releases, but i haven't watched them all and only sampled a few. 

Sadly, this was my first time ever watching the show.
Way to make a bad impression :( 
Way to make a bad file :(
Way to turn someone off from a show you offer :(

I am a TV series junkie.
I use most of my spare time to watch decent TV series. Someone recommended this series to me. 
If i find an episode has been altered by some arrogant jerk and slipped into a torrent with primarily legitimate content i get cranky and oftimes aggressive.

I want to KABLAM!!! the uploader. But it was easier to write this and say BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU GET FROM THIS UPLOADER. It took me 2 days to download the season and then i got to replace the first episode with a proper, unaltered file rather than be watching it right now.  I guess i had to learn the hard way to avoid this uploader, who oddly enough has VIP status. That makes this deception hurt even more."

Way to many people on here think of TPB as a place to grab stuff they seem to think they are entitled to!
Well, you are NOT!

OMG, I turned you off from a show I offer?! How can I make it up to you?
...oh...wait... I don't care ;)!

I do what I do here for fun, I neither have the obligation to do any of it nor do I have any ""customers"" who I would have to please (although some people act like they payed good money for what they leech her...).
I have to admit, that I should have stated in the description, that I recoded the first episode to include the trailers, which I enjoy to alter/create to promote the KABLAM!!!, the place on Suprbay, where I promote my torrents.
But I simply forgot. So, what.
I am a deceptive, arrogant jerk. I just live up to my reputation ;)!
But seriously - man, I don't run a business here, I just have fun.

BTW: the phrases you use - ""[...]episode has been altered by some *arrogant jerk* and *slipped into a torrent*[...]"" (paranoid), ""I want to KABLAM!!! the uploader"" (aggressive), ""That makes this *deception* hurt even more"" (paranoid) - and your user name (""iamgreat"", seriously? But then again, user names are always ridiculous :D, including mine) tell me that you should probably stay off the powder for a while ;)...

Oh, and maybe you should google (or maybe look it up in a decent encyclopedia) the phrase ""constructive criticism"".

Cheers

P.S.: As I care about quality and although this will render my torrent here obsolete, I will give you the link to a better torrent by a fellow pirate and no worries - his first episode is not altered ;):
