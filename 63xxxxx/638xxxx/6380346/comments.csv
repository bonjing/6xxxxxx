Arrived as a rar file and when i convert it, i am asked for a password."
,keybladekyle,2011-05-11T13:54Z,"@starfish294: Your probably not extracting it properly, or you need to get winrar."
,keybladekyle,2011-05-11T13:56Z,"Wait, never mind that, it shouldn't be a .rar file anyway."
,brytewhite,2011-05-11T15:50Z,"@starfish294. It's not rar'd or passworded, it's an avi file. Stop misleading everyone! Many thanx, eztv."
,Skywatcher2012,2011-05-13T19:10Z,"@ brytewhite STOP spreading your shit torrent here on PB.. 

Starfish294 you are 100% right ..""Arrived as a rar file and when i convert it, i am asked for a password. ""

,mkmacabre,2011-05-14T01:52Z,"To clarify, 

A couple of people on this thread are liars. EZTV never use's RAR for a start. I downloaded this and it is fine, as it always is.

So stop bullshitting you pair of fags!!!"

,SamuelTheDamned,2011-05-15T23:55Z,"@starfish294=Skywatcher2012, probably the same motherfé€ &%er who's spreading fake torrents as his dayjob"
,neuraljam,2011-05-17T20:41Z,"When you open the torrent you can clearly see it's an .avi and not a .rar, I don't know how they expected anyone to fall for that... eztv always do great torrents!"
