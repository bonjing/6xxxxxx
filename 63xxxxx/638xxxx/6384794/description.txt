     "50ft Queenie" is the third single by PJ Harvey, and the first from her second studio album "Rid of Me". It is performed by Harvey's eponymous trio, consisting of Harvey on vocals and guitar, Rob Ellis on drums, and Steve Vaughan on bass. Released in April 1993, the song charted in the United Kingdom and was a Top 30 hit, but failed to chart in the United States.
     "To Bring You My Love" was Harvey's first album proper since disbanding the original PJ Harvey trio in 1993.   It is considered to be PJ Harvey's breakthrough. It garnered massive critical acclaim worldwide and became her best-selling album' reaching #2 on Billboard's Modern Rock chart. The album itself debuted at #40 on the Billboard chart and #12 in her native UK, and went on to sell roughly one million copies. The single "Down By the Water" received extensive airplay on radio and on MTV.
     "Is That All There Is?" is a song written by American songwriting team Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller during the 1960s.

It yielded only one single, "That Was My Veil", which spent a week at #75 in the UK charts. Harvey later admitted that she left all promotional duties for the record to Parish because she was exhausted following a year of intense promotional activity for her own "To Bring You My Love" album in 1995.
