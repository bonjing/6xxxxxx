"Rajiv Ties the Baraat Pt. II"

After Rajiv (Rizwan Manji) is found in a 
compromising position he worries that the 
wedding will be called off. These worries 
are replaced by his own doubts of the 
pending nuptials when he learns his bride 
is not exactly who he thought she was. It 
is up to Todd (Ben Rappaport) to convince 
Rajiv that the ceremony must go on. 
Meanwhile, Manmeet (Sacha Dhawan) is 
excited about his new love, but Madhuri 
(Anisha Nagarajan) and Asha (Rebecca 
Hazlewood) learn that she has a different 
idea of the state of their relationship.

Enjoy :)
