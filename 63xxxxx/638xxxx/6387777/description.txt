Conversion:     DVD9 to DVD5
Requirements:   Modded/Chipped Ps2, or Swap Magic Disc method.



Compressed with 7Zip. Both games were tested and work.


Note: (The GOW DVD9 cutscenes or GOW 2 DVD9 cutscenes included are
      there just for your enjoyment to watch .wmv. These cutscenes 
      are still in the game and haven't been removed.)



There is one glitch or cutout in GOW2 at the Lair of the Titan, after you use your bow to shoot Prometheus down to the fire pit, it will start the cut-scene of when you get the chronos rage, instead of the cut-scene when you get rage of the titans. All's you miss is just one small scene however you get the rage of titans power and returns back to the lair of the titans, nothing to major just a small thing. Your not missing much that's the only problem that I found with GOW2 but it doesn't hang or freeze you can still play all the way to the end with all bonus's features.


- Release Notes -

This upload contains FMCB with esr and guides and an emulator. 
If you need them or only use this method. You don't need to use these 
though if using swap magic or if your ps2 is mod-chipped. You only need to 
burn the iso with DVD Decrypter to respectable media with DVD Decrypter if 
thats the case. FMCB may not work in some ps2's.


This is the real deal, not corrupted or crap like some other rips floating around the net. You can play from start to end without any crashes.

Game Description God of War 1:

In God of War, the dark world of Greek mythology comes to life right before your eyes. As you take the role of Kratos, a story unfolds with various plot twists and multiple endings that take you through traps, stunts, and puzzles. With a deep combat system built around double chain blade weapons, the game places you in a variety of environments, in which you must fight challenging enemies, swing on ropes, scale mountain cliffs, swim through rivers, and slide down zip lines.

Game Description God of War 2:

God of War saw Kratos, a mortal warrior, set upon an epic quest to dethrone a God. But his journey did not end there. In God of War II, Kratos sits atop his Olympus throne, as the new God of War ÃƒÂ» far more ruthless than Ares ever was. To end his continued torment, Kratos must journey to the far reaches of the earth and defeat untold horrors and alter that which no mortal, or god has ever changed, his fate. God of War II sets an epic stage for a devastating mythological war to end all wars.

                                 How to Burn
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Burn with DVD Decrypter or ImgBurn, (DVD Decrypter recommended) both Included in download.

If Imgburn doesn't work try Dvd Decrypter.

Burn at 4x or 8x speed. 

Verbatim is recommended to burn with.  Try Verbatim DVD+R (Booktype to DVD-ROM), or use Taiyo Yuden. Using any other brand might not work at all. But these two mentioned are the best you can get. And the ps2 can be picky about certain media, sometimes even if using verbatim you still have to mess around with your modded ps2 or swap magic to get it to run the game, but this is sometimes normal. 

(No ps2 game backup or copy will work on any ps2 console unless it's hard/soft modded or if you use swap magic).

                                Other Game Info
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the full & complete versions for both God of War 1 & 2 DVD5 Converted and  working. As with other god of war 1 or 2 dvd5 version torrents or downloads, game crashes at The Great Chasm for GOW2 or GOW1 crashes and some point because they weren't properly ripped right with the ripkit or was corrupted and mistakes were made. so I wanted to upload a working dvd5 version for both games in one download pack for your convenience.  These games have been tested and properly ripped right with ripkit, and work %100. You can play pass the great chasm for GOW2 and all the way through the game normally just like you would with the original dvd9 version.

I also included the other disc named 'special features' or bonus disc for Gow2 converted to DVD5 format and which is a dvd movie. And can play GOW1 to but for GOW1 some of the movies and bonus features were removed resulting from the conversion.

But with GOW1 you can still play the main game all the way through. Of course the only way to play the extras or all the features like the original is to find a 2 DVD5 disc GOW1 version for download or just buy the game. 


Game pics included.


Any Problems with either game, questions, or anything else please post a comment.


Please Seed. I can't always seed support this download and seed to keep the torrent healthy.



Enjoy!
