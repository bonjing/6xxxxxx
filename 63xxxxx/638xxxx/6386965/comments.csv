Keep seeding peeps!"

,soupcip,2011-05-13T00:03Z,"@prebbs and all other who still don't get it, that isnt due to pirate bay, it's just that as this torrent has just now been uploaded by our beloved tvteam, making tvteam the only seeder at first, and everyone jumping on it at once -which is logical, or better human, cos it aint logical if you think about it- it takes a long time to get more seeders in the first hours, for tvteam has to share it's single position as a seeder over thousands simultanous people. Its the same for all newly seeded torrents until there is a decent amount of seeders, and it has been like this in the torrentscene for the last decade since it started, nothing has changed. If you try and dl this file again tomorrow it will fly as fast as your bandwidth will allow."
