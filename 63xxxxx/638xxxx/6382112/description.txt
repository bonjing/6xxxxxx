Blue Valentine 2010 DVDRip Eng (Span Subs on/off) -by Bakura2


PLOT:
Blue Valentine is the story of love found and love lost told in past
and present moments in time. Flooded with romantic memories of their
courtship, Dean and Cindy use one night to try and save their failing
marriage. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams star in this honest portrait
of a relationship on the rocks.

Rated R for a scene of explicit sexual content, language, and a beating.
