Seems that drivers for your HDD are not included.
Anyway, you can still install this by changing something in your BIOS.
Look for AHCI Mode and change it into IDE.
Good luck.

Burn the CD with minimal speed.

Dear, it's sure from RAM, change the rams and reinstall again

Second thing major it's from CD-R, maybe you copied it by fast speed, try to copy it with low speed, after reinstall it.

if the problem coming again, CHANGE THE CD-R DRIVE 100% THE PROBLEM FROM IT, this resolve if you sure you download the torrent perfectly.

If you think there's some problems when you download, then download it again.

[T],Maherz,2011-05-23T22:02Z,"@DJPidu
I'm not Indian :)
I'm still reading and testing about Windows 7 slipstreaming.
Didn't make my mind up yet which way is the best!
Regarding your question about SATA drivers:
There's 2 type of hard disk drives (3 actually), the old type which is called IDE or PATA, the new type which is called SATA, and SSD.
In the original Windows XP SP3 disk there is no SATA drivers, so you will not be able to install it on a new PC which has SATA hard disk.
That's why I slipstream SATA drivers into Windows XP SP3 disk.
Hope you got it :)"
