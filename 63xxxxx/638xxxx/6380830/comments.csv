,optimum106013,2011-05-10T10:58Z,Just Canucks? Any Red Wings Games? LOL. I'm a transplant not a bandwagon.   
,optimum106013,2011-05-10T11:00Z,I work with a lot of Canucks fans and I had to follow the game online. Pretty much sucked. So now I want to watch it. But it's going to take a long time to download. But I'll seed for 48 hours after I download it. thanks.
