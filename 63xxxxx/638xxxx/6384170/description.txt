Brothers Michael and David (Michael Crawford and Oliver Reed) are typical 60s gadabouts; it's all wine, women, song ... and breaking into the Tower of London. Using comic dexterity to hint at the era's underlying distemper, Michael Winner (yes, that Michael Winner) divines magic from Ian La Frenais and Dick Clement's restless script. A swinging caper so effervescent and breathless, you'll forgive even Ollie Reed's attempts at dancing.
