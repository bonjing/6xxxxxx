Quote:
Golgoth is a super-villain who achieved his ultimate goal; to rule the world. He has found however the biggest threat to his continued reign comes from his supposed allies who pose a far greater threat than the last few free outposts against his Empire.


Imagine If Dr Doom had defeated all the superheroes (including curb-stomping a superman expy, now thats a cross-over) and is on the cusp on taking over the world. This is the universe the empire takes place in.
