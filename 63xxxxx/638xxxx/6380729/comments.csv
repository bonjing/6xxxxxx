,enkilleridos,2012-01-17T21:18Z,"@amirrazorr You are an idiot, and you need to learn to read before telling the whole world that you are an idiot.

Posted in read me above:

 Also these files have been downloaded by me from eztv

eztv DOES NOT do DVD Rips. eztv does TV and HDTV rips. 

So your waste of a day is not the uploaders fault, your waste of a day is your own fault for failing to read something that is very clear. Plus HDTV rips in .mkv format are not all that different from DVD Rips. If you want to see the show on DVD GO BUY IT! It is worth the money. 

A/10
V/10

Excellent quality, it is what the UPLOADER says it is."
,enkilleridos,2012-01-17T21:35Z,"@moizizzy You should consider removing the DVDRip from the title..I just saw that, and I am the idiot that only downloads torrents based on the read me and not the full title shown. (My browser cut off everything after Season 3 on the search page.)"
,RegPulp,2012-02-28T20:36Z,"seasons 1&2 have been compressed a bit too much.

x264 is good, but to maintain high quality when compared too Xvid compression, 30% is a good number.

season 1&2 have been compressed nearly 60% more than what Xvid release sizes would be..... Too much, and quality enthusiasts will notice the high compression artefacts that are present."
