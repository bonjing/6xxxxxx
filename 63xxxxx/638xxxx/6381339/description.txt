    Codes of Gender, The                                                     
    Identity and Performance in Pop Culture                                  
                                                                             
    Written and directed by MEF Executive Director Sut Jhally, The Codes     
    of Gender applies the late sociologist Erving Goffman's                  
    groundbreaking analysis of advertising to the contemporary commercial    
    landscape, showing how one of American popular culture's most            
    influential forms communicates normative ideas about masculinity and     
    femininity.                                                              
                                                                             
    In striking visual detail, The Codes of Gender explores Goffman's        
    central claim that gender ideals are the result of ritualized            
    cultural performance, uncovering a remarkable pattern of masculine       
    and feminine displays and poses. It looks beyond advertising as a        
    medium that simply sells products, and beyond analyses of gender that    
    focus on biological difference or issues of objectification and          
    beauty, to provide a clear-eyed view of the two-tiered terrain of        
    identity and power relations.                                            
                                                                             
    With its sustained focus on how our perceptions of what it means to      
    be a man or a woman get reproduced and reinforced on the level of        
    culture in our everyday lives, The Codes of Gender is certain to         
    inspire discussion and debate across a range of disciplines.
