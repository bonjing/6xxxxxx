Maybe some rich fan guys buyout franchise and find the way to both do great TV and make money. There is some much opportunity in Sci-Fi TV in torrents. Only need some 2x20 mil USD per season and wickedly smart management people.

If you REALLY want to save chappa'ai don't participate in truly silly weak shit ""save-our-show"" events. Instead, invent ways to monetize torrents for show producers. Write to them. Reach for Stargate fans with money. Geeks love stargate, internet startups bubling, economy recovering. TV changing, smart TV, Sci-Fi, show for geeks migrate from TV/cable to bittorent. And currently no money from torrents for shows. SGU killed, The Event killed, Rubicon kiled, Caprica killed, Fringe stepped into last season. Everyday TV get dumber and dumber. Layman just can't tolerate multi-episode story arcs, because its so hard to remember that happened on show even few episodes before."

What a shame. Best series ever."
