,.Leto.,2011-11-16T01:04Z,"hilarious movie but poor rip in my opinion, picture is excessively clear, resulting in a lack of contrast."
,.Leto.,2011-11-16T04:45Z,"try this one instead 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6372099/Tucker.and.Dale.vs.Evil.2010.BRRIP.720P.H264-ZEKTORM
size is similar but picture quality is much better, more definition, more details"
,.Leto.,2011-11-19T00:58Z,"I've downloaded the Flawless version as well and from all of them the Zektorm release is by far the best one. The difference in definition is really obvious, no contest at all."
