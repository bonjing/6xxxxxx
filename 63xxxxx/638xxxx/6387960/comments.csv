,ZeTomes,2011-05-14T03:46Z,"Excuse me but I guess you guys are a little spoiled for what it matters. This is the best I can do with my national ratio upload (2mb highest), and yes there's nothing I can do about it, 32 mb download rate results in 1 mb now calculate 2mb in practice. So, wait 300 hrs or continue be upset. If you like so much this movie it worths the effort, specially when the 2nd finishes downloading, and yes, I have been also downloading movies for about 5 months but worth it. If the question is about viruses or quality stuff, thrust me it is indeed an original"
,ZeTomes,2011-05-14T03:49Z,"You're welcome, it is indeed the best I can do."
,ZeTomes,2011-05-14T03:59Z,Do you think if I fragment it to several rar files it will help? Any tip?
,ZeTomes,2011-05-14T04:31Z,"But you got a point, I didn't know putting this nยบ of torrents would affect so much the up speed"
,ZeTomes,2011-05-14T04:34Z,"so, don't forget, after downloading continue seeding "
,ZeTomes,2011-05-14T08:59Z,"Agentbay, I'm green on these subjects and thanks for clarifying me. It's good to see people defending sharing philosophy as one can see here. I'm finishing downloading some torrents (1day), after that it will be concentrated on uploads - it will raise the upload ratio for sure. Nice Weekend :~)"
,ZeTomes,2011-05-18T19:20Z,this is NTSC (30 fps) not PAL as I specified (edition command not available)
,ZeTomes,2011-06-16T17:24Z,"I cannot afford to keep the movie on hard disk, continue seeding. Thks"
