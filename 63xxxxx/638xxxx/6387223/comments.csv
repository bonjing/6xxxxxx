,remzicavdar,2011-05-13T00:07Z,"Is this update include also a crack???

Because I have update my cracked Shogun 2 and now it doesn't work it redirects me to the steam page!!! "
,Kongo117,2011-05-13T00:18Z,This does include the crack.
,Featherawr,2011-05-13T06:11Z,It works!!  HUZZAH!
,Echiman,2011-05-13T06:44Z,Does this patch fix the missing clans intro & victory movies too?
,remzicavdar,2011-05-13T10:11Z,"I have also one question: Why is the torrent file 1.6 GB?

The official patch 2 is 2.1 GB?

Why is it not so?

Because it is a zip file or because the copy protection is deleted?????"
,Kongo117,2011-05-13T15:01Z,"@ remzicavdar 

Because it's a zip file..."
,LoLzzz2,2011-05-13T15:56Z,"It's working ... It version 3409.285490

Thank's Kongo117"
,Kongo117,2011-05-13T17:17Z,"@LoLzzz2

No prob. just finally giving back to this site :)"
,boomer01,2011-05-13T18:28Z,"Thanks mate. You're a diamond for uploading this. Much appreciated.

Do you know if this includes all the patches though or you gotta apply the old patches before applying this? "
,Kongo117,2011-05-13T18:59Z,"@boomer01

You can just apply this without the first updates."
,Kangaxxx,2011-05-13T19:02Z,"Thanks, does this fix the relations bug if your trade route gets broken?"
[T],Tanauser,2011-05-13T20:21Z,"Great Upload thanks to the Uploader 

All for a free world"
,artpirojkov,2011-05-13T22:40Z,"can anybody tell me, does the patch change the localisation files? can i apply it for no-english version of the game?"
,m3ick,2011-05-14T03:20Z,"Thx Kongo117, it works great!!! So, thanks for uploading."
,m3ick,2011-05-14T03:22Z,"As far as I can see, this patch doesn`t change any location. I was just ask if I like to choose DX9 or DX11."
,necro111,2011-05-14T13:06Z,"This patch does not work, I play the game and it crashes."
,dsnyder24,2011-05-14T17:08Z,"well then you guys are dumb because it works perfectly fine for me. just copy all the files to the shogun 2 folder and overwrite everything. 
thanks for this man, i like the new effects and especially some anti aliasing. :) 

ps: make sure you have a DX11 supported video card first to run it.. seems obvious but ive seen ppl complain about why it wouldnt run dx11 on gtx 2xx cards and radeon 4xxx cards."
,coolman1312,2011-05-14T21:23Z,"for those of you who need help, on how to install the game and this Direct X patch, please go to this helpful walkthrough.

,eXoflow,2011-05-15T10:20Z,Works perfectly :)
,xian18,2011-05-16T04:49Z,It works! Thanks alot! However the encyclopedia has a few missing unit images.
,8487,2011-05-17T19:55Z,Kongo117 can you please post update with build 3444? Thanks
,8487,2011-05-17T20:00Z,Kongo117 can you please post update build 3444. Thanks
,slipp3ry,2011-05-18T02:36Z,"game is playable but it still crashes a bunch . also it tells me that my card isnt directx 11 compatible, and it is "
,LoLzzz2,2011-05-19T11:04Z,Please ... A update for 3444
,Sir_Mark,2011-05-20T20:33Z,"After applying this update Hattori clan disappeared just like few (two?) historic battles. :(

HOW FIX THIS ??

Also I would be grateful for providing other language packs (especially polish one)! "
,dan9khoa,2011-05-22T03:49Z,"To fix the Hattori clan problem, copy the following

steam_api.dll
Steamclient.dll

from the Hattori clan unlocker torrent (the one you used to unlock it) and paste it to the installation folder.

It works for me.

@Kongo117: thx for the torrent"
,AkhoSS,2011-05-22T09:29Z,doesn't seem to work with DMS 2.15
,Bad213Boy,2011-05-26T04:44Z,"I downloaded one of these updated versions. However, the Takeda movie intro still doesn't pop up. Anyone know if there is even a movie for them? Might have issues with other clans but I haven't uses any but the Takeda.

Supposedly the DX11 patch is suppose to have already fixed the movie add-on problem and sound. "
,Bad213Boy,2011-05-27T05:47Z,"Someone still needs to fix the movie .pack files. Even the Add-on Torrent one is wrong. I had to used Pack File Manager to open the movies2.pack file and half of the intro and ending videos were all wrong.

I had to install RADTools and FMV-Extractor. You can't just play the .bik files using RADTools. I needed something to analyze the info first and unlock the file in order for RADTools to play the videos. This is where FMV-Extractor came in. I was able to analyze each .bik file and then play them within FMV-Extractor, but it still needed RADTools installed to play the videos.

There are quite a few ending videos missing. The Mori, Oda, Takeda, and Uesugi are all missing."
,eXoflow,2011-06-01T15:49Z,thx 
,Bad213Boy,2011-06-03T05:37Z,"I tried downloading some HD youtube cut scenes and converting them to .bik and then adding them to the movies pack file but the game crashes when the videos need to start playing.

I'm no hacker, but I'm sure there's a way to add these videos in. I'm probably just not doing something right. I had a hard time trying to find the missing clans endings. I only found the Takeda ending. "
,axe500,2011-06-03T12:19Z,would be great if someone will upload the latest Ikko Ikki DLC.
,Echiman,2011-06-07T02:33Z,@Bad213boy : i've search it on youtube too. But couldn't find it. Could you post the url adress? what the search pass keyword? thx
,Echiman,2011-06-07T11:38Z,Oops.. turn out i already got the takeda victory clan too. What about the other movie? could u post it?
,Louco_da_feira,2011-06-09T15:58Z,"yo Echiman and Bad boy, y'all need to watch out the videos width and height, when converting to .bik, plus, the pack file manager automatically saves the files as a release, u gotta save it as ''movie'' then it should be able to play, i've managed to do it, but somehow couldnt upload a torrent"
,atomisticxkid,2011-06-14T04:31Z,"So i did what you told me to do but i still cant get dx11 and when i put it on dx10 itll crash when its at the start menu, help me please. i own a m11x alien ware laptop and it does have dx11 support.
i have version 1 3444."
,jessez,2011-07-15T03:29Z,does this come with the DX11 crack ?????? I refuse to play this game in DX9
,Crasher323,2011-08-10T11:27Z,"The patch is working great! The loading times are longer but the graphics look awesome. Played one day of it and no BSOD, errors or anything like that meaning that the game is very stable with it.. Thx uploader!!!"
,mr.playa.ma,2011-08-25T22:10Z,is this the latest version ?
