Plot
PRIEST, a post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller, is set in an alternate world -- one ravaged by centuries 
of war between man and vampires. The story revolves around a legendary Warrior Priest from the last
 Vampire War who now lives in obscurity among the other downtrodden human inhabitants in walled-in 
dystopian cities ruled by the Church. When his niece is abducted by a murderous pack of vampires, 
Priest breaks his sacred vows to venture out on a quest to find her before they turn her into one of 
them. He is joined on his crusade by his niece's boyfriend, a trigger-fingered young wasteland sheriff, 
and a former Warrior Priestess who possesses otherworldly fighting skills
