A strange concoction of skits, parodies, performance art, and music, loosely connected to the peace movement.  Richard Pryor pops in and out, seemingly performing some of his stand-up in a casual setting (off the stage). A bit of nudity, and plenty of coarse language.

There are way too many names to list, but here are a few of the more substantial ones:

Tuli Kupferberg
Joe Namath
Andy Warhol
Al Goldstein
Fred Willard
Allen Ginsberg
Richard Nixon

...and a stripping nun!

It looks, from the title sequence, like it has been cropped to 4:3, but I haven't seen a version advertised as widescreen.
