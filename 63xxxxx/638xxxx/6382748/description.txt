Home Schooling - Volume 1 (Beta Version)
========================================

To go along with the "Awake & Aware" series, this is the first volume of "Home Schooling" DVD's i've put together (beta version) from educational videos gathered from around the internet...note this version is meant for children between 3-6 (though never too late to start, and it's fun for "adults" too;) ...please enjoy and spread around to your friends and family...peace :)

Note: the main difference from the alpha version is this has better video quality and a basic Geography section has been added, though there is still much work to do, it is a usable "starter" version. :)
