Several things, first of all, it's entirely Japanese/Chinese/Korean. I cannot differentiate between the three, but it's Asian, about 99%, with almost no English. Not to mention it's all text, as it's a Visual Novel, not a game.

But some people would argue and claim that they ARE games, despite no actual gameplay, just a lot of clicking.

SO that's this summed up, it's a VN, little to no English or any other non-asian language (again, cannot say which it is), and you don't do anything other than read and click, or if your not reading, click yourself into Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.

It would probably be better had I been able to understand the language, but at the end of the day, it's still just a book with pictures, and frankly a good old fashioned Hentai would do me just fine, much shorter and quicker to punchline."
