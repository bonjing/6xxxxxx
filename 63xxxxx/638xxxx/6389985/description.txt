Alex welcomes to the show Texas Republican Rep. David Simpson, who is the sponsor of a bill passed in the Texas House that will make it a criminal offense for the TSA to inappropriately touch travelers during airport intrusive pat-downs. Simpson says the legislation will prevent TSA officials from treating travelers like criminals. Former newspaper journalist and New York Times best-selling author Jim Marrs also makes an appearance. Alex also talks with regular Friday guest Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster about the economy and other subjects. Alex covers the latest news and takes your calls.
