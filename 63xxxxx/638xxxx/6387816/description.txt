Biography
From Ashes To Kings is a 6 piece band from the Edmonton area with strong hopes to bring a new sound to the scene.
Composed back in September by founding members, Garrett Wilde, Robbie Townsend, and Aaron Blackburn; the band set their eyes on filling up all spots with as much diversity as possible. It was then that a synth player, Alicia Blackburn was introduced, followed shortly after by Tanner Ferbey and Marc-Andre Morin.
With the diverse blend of pop punk riffs, fused with hardcore breakdowns, and synth work; From Ashes To Kings is hoping to bring out a change in sound anywhere they reach out.
