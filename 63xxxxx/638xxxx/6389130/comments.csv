,Ataractic,2011-05-13T14:22Z,"NO! I like happy endings! Please don't kill it!

Just recovered from another PC crash; surprisingly, I could download every episode I missed :) thanks to all the seeders, almost all daily show packs are still alive.

2040: Sir, if it isn't too much to ask, can you please include happy endings episodes 1 and 2 in the weekly pack, please? I couldn't recover them after the crash.

And thanks for TBBG, mentalist, Happy endings and most importantly- charlie chaplin (:

I was wondering if you could upload Full Charlie Chaplin Collection in volumes

Say 1 GB every week..."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-13T14:39Z,"Thanks.

@Ataractic: I must drop the shows which have not gained popularity. It must be done. I cannot physically do such great number of shows. And - every-time I must drop some show - there is lot of sorrow.
Episodes 1. and 2. will be re-upped however."
