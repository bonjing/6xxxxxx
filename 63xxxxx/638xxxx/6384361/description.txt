Part 10. The Smile of Reason.
The sensible, sophisticated men and women who met in the salons of 18th-century Paris wanted to change society. In the end they got more of a change than they bargained for. The polite tete-a-tete in those elegant salons was the precursor of revolutionary politics. Kenneth Clark's theme takes him from the palaces of Versailles and Blenheim, to Edinburgh and to the hills of Virginia, where Thomas Jefferson made his home in the 1760s.
