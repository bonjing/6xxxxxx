Here's why dutchsinse is wrong.  This is information he censored from multiple youtube users, and banned us outright rather than having a sane, logical discussion about it.

I simply took the address of the website that he claimed had been taken down (it had), looked at it on google cache, clicked through and found a simulator page which dealt with the SAME data he thought they were trying to hide. This page was still up on the normal internet, which he acknowledge before banning me and stickying a comment saying it was no big deal, and didnt contradict his viral video (5/12/11).

When I insistently pointed this out, that this page existed, he finally responded by claiming it was dealing with separate, deceitful data, or some sh*t like that. So I fact-checked this by taking a screenshot from HIS video of a simulator particle map from their zardoz file directory, took the date/time data etc from it and was able to easily produce the SAME image with the simulator which was still online  (do this yourself if you do not believe me). When I went to post this in his comments as a response to his reply, I found i was BANNED (lol)."

So I've got this all compiled in IMGUR screenshots for the record here: 

imgur DOT com/a/94YUw

The second (bottom) image shows the comment that he didnt like, the first (top) image was going to be my reply to his comment.

Oh, I even even proved the levels of exposure to the fallout probably arent anything to lock yourself in a bunker over. Those images he is yammering about, those values are a TOTAL for an 11 mile column of the atmosphere. Thats why the units are bq/ meter square (m2).   Its the particles within a 3ftx3ftx11mile box.  I've include those calculations at the bottom of the first image.


Unlike our 'friend' dutchsinse, please feel FREE to fact check, or ask questions, about EVERYTHING I said above and decide for yourself if this accurate."
