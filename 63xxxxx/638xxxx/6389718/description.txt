:Plot::
 Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a 2005 crime/dark comedy film, which engages many conventions of the classic film noir genre in a tongue-in-cheek fashion. It is based, in part, on the novel Bodies Are Where You Find Them by Brett Halliday. The cast includes Robert Downey, Jr., Val Kilmer, Michelle Monaghan and Corbin Bernsen. The screenplay was written by Shane Black who also directed the film. It was produced by Joel Silver, and co-produced by Downey's wife Susan Downey (who is credited as Susan Levin).
