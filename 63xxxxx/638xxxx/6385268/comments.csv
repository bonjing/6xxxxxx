,AyresUK,2011-05-13T14:00Z,I Have The Same Problem Only French Has Anyone Got A Fix For This?
,noob66600,2011-05-13T19:04Z,i went though every menu option and not seen anything that can change the language
,Fantafaust,2011-05-13T20:28Z,"Well, I'd say this torrent is mis-advertised. It said ""ENG, GER"" and I speak both English and German. But French, I do not speak. If you speak English, until the uploader tells how to change the language, DO NOT download this torrent."
,Fantafaust,2011-05-14T03:02Z,"Uploaded English version here for you guys. Enjoy.

[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-05-14T18:29Z,"For English just edit language.config under BLES01304\PS3_GAME\USRDIR\platform\ps3

You can open and edit it with notepad.

Sorry guys for mess up."
,Shauncold,2011-05-15T18:32Z,"this game works and is in french, I couldn't change language.config with notepad from folder but it can be downloaded if you look hard enough with google. I currently have this game running in English thanx to a download that I found by searching google and deleting the original language.config  and replacing it with downloaded one. Hope this helps.

,bo.leaper,2011-09-21T11:38Z,to all those downloading please read the comments before you download a game .... this will help you see if the game works and if there are any problems .... for example this one .... only if you r a french speaking person download this .... this game is in french but the title states otherwise
