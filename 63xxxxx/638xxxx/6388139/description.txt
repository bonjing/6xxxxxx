The master songwriter's first two long-players have been released on a single import CD that is more than worth searching out for listeners with a thing for impressionistic story-songs delivered in a voice as dry and true as the dust of West Texas. These classic recordings, including "She Ain't Goin' Nowhere" and "Desperados Waiting for the Train," may date back to the mid-'70s, but their production holds up decades later. None of that horrible Nashville spit and polish of the era distracts from Clark's fine songs. Essential listening for fans of today's alternative country and folk singer/songwriters.
