,zvengar,2011-05-10T05:33Z,why does it have to be in 23rar files?
,tiss2,2011-05-10T05:58Z,"If you don't like it, download one of the other torrents.. 

I for one is taking this one since it's the first. sceneline is always first, ergo the best. "
,euphoria4949,2011-05-10T06:30Z,"Perfect as always, big thanks :-)

#zvengar....... Seriously why moan about RARs?
If it takes you ages to extract this, then thats your fault as your PC is obviously useless! A 1GB file like this extracts in less than 10 seconds even on a basic PC!! 
Is it really that much of an inconvenience for you? 
Just think it would be even more of an inconvenience if it wasn't here to download so you had to wait for the DVD and buy it!!! :-O

Thanks sceneline A+"
,leogyn,2011-05-10T16:32Z,"i really think that 1Gb mkv files could be with no RARs .... but if they are, no problem at all ... it extracts in seconds, and the problem is gone :) There's no reason for complaining about that besides being a very annoying person hehehe"
,chrizx888,2011-05-10T16:36Z,thanks much! :)
,Dk90,2011-05-10T17:33Z,"MORE SEEDERS PLEASE.



10x"
,fordizama,2011-05-10T17:35Z,"I agree with euphoria4949,
please stop complaining! what a big deal to Unrar?
be thanks full instead !

Great upload!"
,WoNHommer,2011-05-10T18:24Z,"First of all, thank you for the release!

I'm not complaining, but I have a reason why this should not be in rars... If someone is short on hard drive free space, they would probably unrar and delete the rar files, so that would stop him from seeding the torrent.

I myself don't really mind at all, I have tons of space and it takes less than 10sec to unrar, so I thank you a lot for the release. But maybe it would be better for the torrent if you wouldn't rar the files!

Also, it's better for the uploader! It's one less step for the uploader, so it's less efforts for whoever is bringing these GREAT releases to us!

I think I have a point here..."
,dingo8baby,2011-05-11T07:33Z,"@tiss2: please point me to the other 720p release of this episode.

@euphoria4949: if you were only downloading one episode per week, your argument would be valid. however, if you download many titles, all in this outdated rar packaging shit, then it becomes very burdensome to continually have to unpack every episode. Also, please don't bring up the ""buy it"" argument. we are all on piratebay, downloading things we don't want/have the ability to buy. don't be a fool.

the reality is, there is absolutely NO reason to package these files on a torrent site this way. the uploader just wants to be contrary.

,the_one60,2011-05-11T22:07Z,"Secene groups use RAR because they initially post to newsgroups. Rars have no useful purpose in torrents other than hiding cracks and patches from Anti-virus progs. All the other reason given for using rars ONLY APPLY TO NEWSGROUPS! Back when The Scene started, newsgroup servers restricted the size of attachments in messages and RAR was the only compression utility that would easily split up large files.

Scene groups sever a useful purpose, but people who just take these rar files and post them as torrents are just trying to make a name for themselves and don't care that they make more work for torrent users.

By the way...users have every right to complain. If they didn't, then all of the great, free and open source software (like Utorrent, Audacity, Blender, Linux, etc.) would be useless.

Please UNRAR before you post."
,johnylux,2011-05-12T19:39Z,does this replace the DIMENSION release?
,gandalf_tr,2011-05-12T20:02Z,Please unrar video files before sharing. I use a plug computer for transmission (also as a nas server) and it takes nearly 30 minutes to unrar 1 GB video files after downloading. 
,the_one60,2011-05-12T21:14Z,The DIMENSION release will show up in a few days.
