,boggyb99,2011-06-25T12:49Z,"What settings did you use to compress the file with so little quality loss? This is amazing! I'm working on a project and I would really appreciate any tips you have on compression. Right now, my clips are in the quicktime .mov format and every 4 minutes of footage is approx. 1gb - which sucks. (1080p) Please help mate. Maybe you could PM me.."
