Please stop using Imageshack to host screens, the links don't work.

There are lots of excellent alternatives!

,scottsasse,2011-07-24T10:04Z,"I agree Imageshack links are almost always a big waste of time, besides nobody should need check images for quality on a BRRip that is 600MB plus as they are almost always 720per. It's the audio that can be sometimes a bit iffy. Anyhoo ..........THANKS to SaM for another quality upload!! And who is the big anal-beast who is driving down the quality rating on this torrent?? The quality is fine!!"
