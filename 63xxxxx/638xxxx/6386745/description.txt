The aim of the Space Exploration annuals is to provide a yearly update on recent space launches, missions and results, to be published every September in a format that will be suitable for, and appeal to, the Christmas market. The annual will cover space exploration from a variety of angles, looking back at past missions, reviewing those currently under way and detailing those planned for the future, and encompassing both manned and unmanned spaceflight.
