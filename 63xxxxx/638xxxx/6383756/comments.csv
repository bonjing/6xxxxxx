,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-11T15:41Z,damn--the only things I could chuck to reduce the size of the download was Campus and The Daily Show.  Thanks!
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-11T15:47Z,"Thanks.

@hardik_860: Tootsie can go (I don't know exact time) and '70-es  got No-go before, and nothing has changed. I don't do TV shows seasons I don't follow through - especially ones with gazillion episodes. Be reasonable. Do Search, Google - many collections are available."
,t.trikiti,2011-05-11T16:15Z,thank you very much for each tv show!
,rajmxxx,2011-05-11T17:21Z,"Thor: Tales of Asgard is out on blu ray. Please upload this 20-40.
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1667903/"
,hubby1723,2011-05-11T17:46Z,thank you:)
,believenu,2011-05-11T18:09Z,"thank you, seeding is sharing."
,DMVIN,2011-05-11T18:16Z,"You speak swahili?

A request if possible, Kingdom of Heaven in 480p. Thanks"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-11T18:58Z,"@DMVIN: Last October I did
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5869486/Kingdom.Of.Heaven.2005.Dir.Cut.BluRay.352p.H264[REQ]

It is too early and maybe pointless, 480p against 352p for such long movie."
,Cavemann,2011-05-11T20:03Z,"Thanks again.

 I have less than 50 KB/s upload speed on a real good day, but I have been seeding to above 1:1 ratio for a while now, the only time I turn it off is when I am doing the initial seeding for one of my torrents I upload on Demonoid, or when I have computer problems. Regardless of my speed, I will continue to upload at least as much as I download from you."

Ultimate Avengers II  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0803093/
.....NO idea if Bluray is out by now, its jus tat 'rajmxxx' stated BluRay is out for Thor.. im fairly certain its out for Avengers I & II, no idea about Green Lantern... can u do something in small size ~ around 500mb if possible?? i guess a 480p should do the trick
