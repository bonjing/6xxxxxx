[T],thetorrentlord,2011-05-14T16:37Z,"A big thanks for putting all the sound files seperate instead of one big file. That leaves it up to the downloader, which saves a considerable amount of bandwidth. Once again a big thanks!!!!!"

please try to upload the departed brrip with multiple separate audios-english dts 1500kb/s"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-05-15T15:48Z,"I'll upload ""The Departed (2006)"" next week though I encode all DTS & THD 1500+ to DTS 768 KB/s. The difference between DTS 1500 and 768  is as much as between BD and BDRip, almost impossible to tell the difference.
You do a test yourself (use eac3to, Sonic for decoding, surcode to encode) and switch between the two audios while playing...
99% of the BDRips have the untouched DTS etc because people won't bother to do more work, not because of the quality difference.
Not so rare the case that the Audio track alone is 4 GB!
I've seen not once that in a 4.3 GB BDRip the audio alone was 2gb! (so 2.3 GB was for video!)
If I uploaded in this torrent the original 1500 DTS-s (would be 2 GB each) the torrent would be 14 GB and would put off many people.
The difference between 1500 DTS and 768 is not even as much as between Flac (or wav) and 320 KB/s mp3."
,Night_89,2011-05-16T03:52Z,"thanks
and no prob for 768kb/s
I didn`t knew about dts decode
thought that it is just the original
thanks for your reply and support"
