Don't download, files screwed up.. "

,NeutralGold,2011-05-12T18:20Z,"tkhawari, I was pretty irked myself. I ended up having to watch it from one of the websites I watch anime on at low quality. Starting in high and finishing in low was worse than not watching it at all. It really dulled things for me on this episode. lol."
