,catfly,2011-05-17T12:20Z,"thank u eztv, u are the best.
this episode right up there with the best ever for this series, after a shite season full of 'why do i bother watching this crap', this one just rocks. And i don't just mean for the UST being finally resolved (or was it?) but also for the excellent sniper fight at the end and the fact that every actor in it is totally on their game in this episode. And no boring bits & no irrelevant bits for once. it finally reminds me what caught me about this show. Thanks & back to your normal programming."
