The first episode contains a lengthy commercial of some sort at the beginning, and there are KABLAM group clips about three times at the beginning of the episode.

There is, of course, the SyFy logo crap at the bottom right of each episode.

Overall, I'm not pleased with the pack, and I'm actually now downloading a different one, as I'm looking for something to retain in the long term, so I want decent quality.

V: 6
A: 7
Pack: 4"

KABLAM!!! is NO group ( :D I LOLed) - it's just the section on Suprbay I promote my torrents in:

The pack consists of the regular HDTV.XviD scene releases. Only the first episode was recoded, I never laid hand on the rest ;).

Not only that, but you've degraded the value of the content by doing so.

To me, that seems a bit dickish. I appreciate that you've gone to the trouble of providing this pack, but as I mentioned in my last comment, your modifications to the content have seriously degraded it."
,hughzi23,2011-06-16T15:08Z,FoxNSox Stop pissing and moaning and if you want something to keep long term go and buy it! No pleasing some people.
,Etherous,2011-10-09T07:59Z,I agree with FoxNSox. Poor quality. Commercials not appreciated. Currently downloading alternate.
