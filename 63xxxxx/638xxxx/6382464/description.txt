
In this speech.., a very angry David Irving recalls incident after incident.., where the Holocaust-Lobby.., which he coined the phrase, "The Traditional Enemy".., tried to discredit his up-till-then.., brilliant career as a skilled biographer of important historical figures of the 2nd World War.

It's an outspoken speech about the little-known AND career destroying "modus aperandi" of the "gate-keepers" of the traditional.., but never forensically verified.., Holocaust claims of large-scale "mass-gassings"...

His speech here is 60 minutes long with a good quality of  A9 / V8

As always.., after watching.., do your best to "pass it on".....

"Truth Does Not Fear Investigation"

AND...

"He who Wins the War.., also Writes the History"
