Very recently, I've started getting an error message ""Video GMC not supported"" when trying to play these files on my Philips DVD/Avi player. GMC is apparently Global Motion Compensation. Whatever you've recently changed in encoding, please go back to what you were doing before."

I DL them every day :) you rock! was wondering if (crossing fingers) by any chance you have Chelsea on Piers Morgan Tonight? She was his guest on 05/11/2011. You are the ultimate Chelsea uploader, so was hoping you had it! If not, no worries! Thanks, again, for always uploading!"
