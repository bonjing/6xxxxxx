,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-14T02:11Z,"How do you determine an ""8"" versus a ""9"" or a ""7""?  And just wtf is an ""M""--your opinion of the MOVIE??  We can get that from the IMDB link.  If you can't provide objective quantifiable standards for your judgement of the audio and video quality, could you have the courtesy to keep your opinions to yourself."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-14T02:15Z,"The high and mighty A=8 V=8 M=7 person cannot be addressed directly, oddly enough.  looks like the pirate bay's mods have been compromised yet again."

[V],twentyforty,2011-05-14T09:59Z,"@formerly_azrielle: Same here - I don't know now many times I asked our midget ""Do you compare it  to best encode EVER? Best movie EVER? What is your playback system? Have you original to compare to and see how WRONG YOU ARE? Who to fuck you are? Why do you think your opinion means a shit when a) you are nobody b) we don't know your scale nor metrics and are not interested at all in shoveling your opinion through people's throat... and similar.

Of course, I never have one answer - and - dude666 cannot be - addressed by his screen-name. Strange? Not anymore."
