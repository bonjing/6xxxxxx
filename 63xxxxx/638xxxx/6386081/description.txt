Housewife Lucy Chadman (Shelley Long) comes to an untimely end while nibbling on a chicken ball... but says Hello Again when her wacky, mystical sister Zelda (Judith Ivey) brings her back from the great beyond! Only one year has passed but oh, how things have changed. Lucy's miraculous return creates laugh-filled pandemonium with everyone she re-encounters... especially with her upwardly mobile husband (Corbin Bernsen), who now is wed to her "former" best friend! Suddenly solo, Lucy must piece together a new life - in a riotous odyssey that bewitches her handsome doctor... bewilders her ex-husband... and bedazzles both press and public alike!
