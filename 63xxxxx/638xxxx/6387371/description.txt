This is Betjeman reciting his own poems with the music of Jim Parker.  This album is a sheer delight.  The music and the poems match perfectly and this CD just leaves you wanting more.  It is the best of the CDs that Betjeman created and I encourage all who are remotely interested to take a copy of this.  You will not be disappointed.  Please seed.
