,oldtimer48,2011-10-28T02:30Z,"Arguably the most despised pest in all Australia. It was introduced by man to fight the cane beatle but then its population exploded. This is a documentary with Neil Young which allows you to walk in the webbed feet of the cane toad.  Will report back on A/V quality, download slow though, about 9kbs second, only one seeder at the moment"
