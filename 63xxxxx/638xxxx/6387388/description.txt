Description: 
In this episode, Michael Mosley shows how existence is a 
struggle and how, minute by minute, from your first breath
to your last, your body performs countless small miracles to 
keep you alive.It starts with a dramatic water birth, shot in 
slow motion, before a stunning graphics sequence takes 
us on a breathtaking journey into the heart. We see how 
that first, crucial breath leads to a dramatic re-plumbing of 
your entire circulatory system.Michael meets remarkable 
people who demonstrate how well the human body 
adapts to extreme environments: Herbert, a world-champion 
free-diver, who can hold his breath in the depths of the 
ocean for up to nine minutes; Wim, the Ice Man, who can 
swim in glacial lakes so cold they would kill a normal 
person; and Debbie, who has lived for 10 years on a diet 
of crisps.

And finally we see what happens when your body finally fails; we share the last moments of Gerald, an 84-year-old, as he passes away at home with his family gathered around him.
