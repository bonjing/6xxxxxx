Time Changes Everything brings Wilson's contemporary voice and message to a timeless jazz project.  This critically-acclaimed studio album, with two new bonus tracks, brings classic melodies, lyrics and arrangements, reminiscent of the golden age of the Great American Songbook into the modern era with original jazz and big band music that sets standards all their own.  It features 14 original songs, including the bossa nova wine inspired single Drink It Up, that showcase her dexterity as both a singer and songwriter.  She delivers a sonically masterful collection of modern-day life and love-lessons that pull from diverse influences, ranging from Cole Porter to Laura Nyro.
