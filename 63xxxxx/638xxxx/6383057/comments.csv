 Sir, will you please do this one?

@rajmxxx: My first choice is always 480p, 720p follows - and 1080p (with my 54 kB/s upload to seeding server) is a kind of treat. Not anything I would do more than before - every once in a while."
[V],DownTYU,2011-05-11T10:25Z,"Thanks for this one.

Is the second part coming???"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-11T10:52Z,@DownTYU: Nope. This one was requested.

Btw, love your 480p
Thx again."

[V],twentyforty,2011-05-11T16:32Z,"Thanks DownTYU, I've checked and, as usual, any BluRay subtitle would do. BluRay disks are uniform,  people  just need to pay attention in cases of Director's Cut or Extended versions."
,the_shroud,2011-05-11T16:59Z,Thx for the subs DownTYU
