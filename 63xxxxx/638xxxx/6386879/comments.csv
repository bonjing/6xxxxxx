,Tokerific,2011-05-13T14:10Z,"Torrent also includes some additional ADDONS that I personally use with this version.

Tbag - TBag is a WoW Addon that provides an alternative bag and bank interface. It was built by modifying Engbags an addon who has essnetially the same functionality is missing some of the features of TBag.

Questhelper - Questhelper tells you how to finish your quests in the easiest, fastest manner. It includes a database of quests, monsters, and items, telling you the exact location of that dang Perfect Satyr Horn you can't find. It also computes the fastest path to complete all your quests - and gain experience - as quickly as possible.

TomTom - TomTom is your personal navigation assistant in World of Warcraft. This addon is very simple, but provides a nice set of functionality. Thanks to Esamynn for Astrolabe, which does the bulk of the work in this addon.

TomTom offers the following major features:
Set waypoints via command, or by clicking on the world map
A draggable coordinate display with customizable accuracy. This frame can be hidden or locked.
Player and cursor coordinates on the World Map (these can be hidden)
A floating ""crazy-taxi"" style arrow that points you to your destination
Displaying the ""crazy-taxi"" arrow or coordinate block in compatible LDB displays (such as NinjaPanel)
Show a waypoint that points you towards your corpse for easy recovery
Can set waypoints by clicking on quest objective POIs on the World Map and watch frame.

Mailopener - Mail Opener will give a nice indication of the amount of mail remaining in your mailbox and the estimated time required to open everything. This will look like the following (this first number indicates the amount of mail currently visible, the second indicates the total amount of mail remaining):

Many other ADDONS available, just remember to get ones compatible with this version (3.3.5)"
,redshirtmb,2011-05-14T21:53Z,the ITR WoW account signup page is down. Anyone know if/when it'll be back. Thanks.
,Tokerific,2011-05-15T10:38Z,The website itself is currently experiencing technical difficulties. Those with accounts are still playing uninterrupted. Everything with sign ups should be fixed very soon.Personally I check back several time a day to check so if no one posts here before I do I'll let you know and see you there
,redshirtmb,2011-05-15T18:32Z,"Excellent. Don't mind waiting, just wanted to make sure everything was fine."
,Tokerific,2011-05-16T00:09Z,Your very welcome
,Mr.Wolfe,2011-06-14T18:01Z,"I don't have high hopes for ITR anymore, but I do already have an account. I just needed the download since I had to wipe my laptop's hard drive.

Based on what I've seen with ITR it looks to me like the server may be going down. Many of the best members I've met have already left, when I was last online I saw glitches and bugs getting worse instead of better (glitches that did not exist even after the 3.5.5update began occuring), and the website has gone down twice now. ITR's original Facebook page disappeared and, I'm not certain about it, but I was told something changed with their Myspace page as well.

Maybe the server won't go down, but there's definitely something a little more than just ""technical difficulties"" going on. Could be hackers and it kinda sounds like that to me since problems occurred on Facebook as well."
,Tokerific,2011-06-26T10:52Z,"http://www.itrwow.com/ WEBSITE BACK UP so feel free to create your accounts and we'll see you online. The website has been down for new members but has always been available to existing members by using the 'website' prefix (website.itrwow.com). As for the server going down, apart from the couple of minutes a day 'refresh' time personally I have never seen and drop. Perhaps it's your laptop Mr.Wolfe, or your OS settings. Still, to be able to play for free is the main thing :)"
