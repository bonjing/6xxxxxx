,hii2ii2,2011-08-09T02:49Z,Hi! Don't know if it is the downlod or VLC but for whatever reason the video stalls while the timer continues in every episode. 
,birdo108,2011-08-26T19:04Z,"The quality of the episodes are great. Thanks a lot Famouz!

Can't wait for the new season on September 22."
,gaaraisgod3,2011-12-18T21:59Z,"Force a recheck on your torrent or update your installation of VLC Media Player or try a different player (like MPC) because LOL and FQM are two of the most consistent groups. Not to say they couldn't mess it up but just make sure the problem isn't at your end, at least until someone else can verify."
,ForRevGreen,2012-01-20T23:37Z,"LOL, you are wonderful."
,dsblink182,2012-03-16T22:09Z,"Just got an email from my ISP for this, it might be because of the 17+gigs that got uploaded while i was seeding."
