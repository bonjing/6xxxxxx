Smash hit music factory - UndergÃ¥ngen (2011/MP3/320kbit)

From Stockholm Sweden. Brewed in the woods of VÃ¤rmland. This record is like a furry man with a light smell of alcohol in his breath, running out of the forest to tell of impending doom. The look on your face when he grabs your shoulders and starts ranting. That is the feeling that this record has when it views the world.
