Your Proxy always remain open no matter what you do, which leads to the threat of someone hacking into our computer and using our IP address. With proxy being open he can also look into our data...!! So be careful don't download this file."
,manishmahabir,2011-08-02T20:00Z,I am sorry codin if you are facing certain issues...you are most welcome to file a bug-report on launchpad or ask help from the ubuntu-community. Be assured that I have not tinkered with any settings...this torrent is only an attempt to help new ubuntu users with all the good intentions.
