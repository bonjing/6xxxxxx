,Philonetic,2011-06-13T05:23Z,"There is a CURE FOR CANCER that was recently discovered in Canada in the form of a DIETARY SUPPLEMENT

If you or anyone you know is afflicted with any type of cancer, please research into this as it HAS BEEN PROVEN but will NEVER be approved by the FDA. "
,capturetwist,2011-07-23T23:25Z,why don't you tell which one it is the supplement? So that people like me with breast cancer have a more than easy time trying to research into it.
,brttfrmn1,2011-11-26T22:27Z,"@capturetwist, the supplement is Dichloroacetic acid, also known as DCA it was used a long time ago to treat hereditary diseases, since no one owns the rights to this drug it is not used to treat cancer although they have done studies and DCA has killed cancer in animals wich had more than one type, like breast,spinal,and brain cancer. another cure is taking a pound of marijuana and extracting all the thc into a gram of like an oil, this method is very expensive, and is illegal because pharma companies want to sell their drugs that do not work. DCA can be bought for very cheap considering it is a cure, some companies label this as a dangerous chemical, in an attempt to stop the use of it as a cure. "

The fundamental criterion for the suppression of a cancer cure is that it actually works. ALL cures, proprietary and otherwise, have been blocked. Monetary gain is a secondary concern in the bigger game the owners of the pharmaceutical companies are playing."
