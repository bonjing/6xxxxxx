I ripped these Ariana Grande songs from videos using Audacity so some of the audio is great. I just did it so I could hear her beautiful voice when I'm not at my PC.

Song List:

Beautiful (Live)
Born This Way/Express Yourself
Born This Way/Express Yourself (Live)
Grenade (Bruno Mars Cover)
Hide and Seek (Imogene Heap Cover)
Love The Way You Lie (Rhianna's Version)
Rolling In The Deep (Adele Cover)
Vienna (Billy Joel Cover)

This girl is SO talented! Enjoy!
