If you like the download/encode/upload (not the movie) and my work please click on the ""+1"" next to quality and do comment on it ..

Please seed atleast 1:1 so other people could download as well..

Thank you"
[V],RajMahal,2011-05-07T22:43Z,"I want to WARN about two things in this release.

1) The movie switches between 2.35:1 and 1.85:1 aspect ratio automatically (i didn't have anything to do with it ..It was the Blu-Ray)

2) It does come with a bag of noise included and i am sorry to say but that's how the film was shot and released.

If you got a problem with these two please leave it (check the sample first if you have any doubt) and if you did download it before reading this comment  ...Well ...I am sorry .
Peace "

,miknos,2011-07-15T04:54Z,"Quality is good. Just two noob mistakes. Hardcoded subs and hardcoded black stripes.

Thanks for sharing tough."
,miknos,2011-07-15T20:37Z,I was wrong about the black stripes. Those appear only in the beginning of the movie.
[V],RajMahal,2011-07-16T09:26Z,"Hardcoded subs were in the blu-ray and they were in the video.
Even if you buy the blu-ray they are gonna be there...it's not my fault."
