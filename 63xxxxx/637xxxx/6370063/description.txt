Selected by International Film Guide in 1988 as one of the ten best Hungarian films of the quarter-century, this lush, sensuous, vivid work is based on a series of stories by Hungarian surrealist Gyula Krâ”œâ•žÃ†â”¬â•‘dy, and features acting great Zoltâ”œâ•žÃ†â”¬Ã­n Latinovits as an aging Don Juan fondly remembering a life of wine, women and song â”œÃ³Î“Î“Ã‡ÃœÂ¼Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¬Â¥ but mostly women. Each fragment of memory, each wistfully recalled romance, is rendering in ravishing, luxuriant detail, creating â”œÃ³Î“Î“Ã‡ÃœÂ¼â”¼Î“Ã‡Â£a wordless tapestry of, not images, but life breathsâ”œÃ³Î“Î“Ã‡ÃœÂ¼â”¬â”¬Â¥ (Peter Rubin).
