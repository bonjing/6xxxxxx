Flatgrass Map for Minecraft


This is a map of complete flat grass. I am currently using it to build a complete city, I will upload the map when Im finished but it's going to take a while. You can also use it to build "Mega-Structures" or anything you want.


Install:

1. Click Start

2. Search "Run"

3. (Inside Run) Type in "%appdata%"

4. Look for the ".Minecraft" Folder. (It should be the first one)

5. Open ".Minecraft" Folder

6. Open "Saves" 

7. Copy and Past the Downloaded content into the "Saves" Folder (You can rename it if you want)

8. Close the window

9. Open Minecraft

10. Play!




I know there are a lot of steps but I'm just being specific for anyone that might have trouble installing the map.
