Not only one of the most gorgeous albums I've ever heard, but also one of the "most English." These evocative, powerful and under-appreciated pieces by 20th century English composers capture the spirit of the land as well as anything by Vaughan Williams or Elgar. An absolute must-hear for all Anglophiles.

Frank Bridge 1879-1941
Gerald Finzi 1901-1956
Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry 1848-1918

 - I also posted this album here in 320kbps MPEG Layer III: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6161213/Finzi-Parry-Bridge_-_An_English_Suite . Been meaning to upload the FLAC for months but kept forgetting. Better late than never. :^)

 - I seed using "Initial Seeding" which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for several days until there are other seeds.

 - PLEASE MAKE SURE TO SEED as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) Please do your part so free media will always be available.
If everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.
