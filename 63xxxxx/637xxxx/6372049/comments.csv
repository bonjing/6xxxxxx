Directed by Uwe Boll
with Arved Birnbaum, Maximilian Gì²œrtner and Uwe Boll
.
In ""Auschwitz"" Uwe Boll asks German schoolchildren what they know about the Holocaust and specifically about the events at Auschwitz. When the movie concludes that they know very little, Boll switches over to gruesome images of Auschwitz. No main characters or heroes, just a showing of the facts."
