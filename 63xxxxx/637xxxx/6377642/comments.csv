,sriepetine,2011-05-09T16:35Z,"FUCK THIS UPLOADER (if you're not responsible for the file, fucking still applies as you haven't check the friggin' file first)! Someone should strip his VIP badge off the damn dude!

This cuts at 59 minutes. Waste of time! I usually don't swear but I damn hate evil bastards, some of us have limited bandwidth available!

Anyway..."
,kingguff,2011-05-09T18:40Z,"Waste of time, cuts out in the boardroom. Torrentzone can suck my balls"
,dancandy,2011-05-09T21:41Z,"Confirmed. Show cuts off at 59min. in the board room. Can't even see who gets fired.

Don't waste your time and bandwidth. Find another torrent."
,deadroleguy,2011-05-09T23:04Z,"yeah i notice its 59 min for 700mb file? come on
im gonna vote negative on this one"
,dumbasstheives,2011-05-09T23:59Z,"Torrentzone screwed this up. If you look at the NFO for this release on other sites. You'll see that it was a 3hr episode and therefore its 2x700. Seems Torrentzone only uploaded CD1.
