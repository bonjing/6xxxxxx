Keep doing what you're doing..You know people really appreciate this.. im downloading this as we speak and i ll make sure I seed it for quite a bit of time!"
,Niagra,2011-05-09T07:18Z,"Oh boy, I've been keeping my ears all day yesterday to avoid getting some spoilers waiting for your upload! This will be awesome, thank you so much!"
,baxim,2011-05-09T07:48Z,yay... thanks again
,jorrell0733,2011-05-09T08:07Z,"Yeah Guys, I know you've been waiting for this ALL day, but Im finding that recoding HD content to a decent acceptable quality and compressing to a good file size is very time consuming. I.E This took 9 hrs to recode on a quad core Win 7 PC, with 8GB RAM! Im glad you're happy with the downloads and prepared to wait for mine.. Its appreciated"
,yaksox,2011-05-09T08:47Z,"I appreciate the effort, but surely it can be encoded to be a little less huge. Unfortunately this is the only BBC torrent I can find and the speed is *crawling*."
,synchronicityii,2011-05-09T09:19Z,"Thanks for the upload, we realize it's hard work that you're doing for free... so any winers/complainers out there... just ignore them and know that your hard work is appreciated!"
,xtrlrg,2011-05-09T10:37Z,You are freaking awesome!
,VR6VR6VR6,2011-05-09T11:31Z,"thanks man please continue doing this for us man
so we can watch f1 in HD 
many thanks to you "
,shores,2011-05-09T12:23Z,"Again, thanks so much. I don't mind file size or waiting at all, it's worth it. Only trouble is -- I always manage to spoil the race for myself by seeing headlines on the news. :("
,kanevolfeed,2011-05-09T13:41Z,hahaha thanks man!! I watched it live... but I will watch again to look for details in the race! *--* Thanks for your work! It's great!
,shirakawa0,2011-05-09T18:26Z,"Hey Jorrell, just want to say you are awesome! The world is truly better with someone like you, thanks for all the hard work! The quality is awesome, and the file size is good. Don't listen to those whiners who complain about the size..."
,VR6VR6VR6,2011-05-09T23:01Z,"yes jorrell we dont mind the size of the file as long as its in HD because i enjoy watching it on my big a** screen tv lol 
keep it up man 
cheers "
,brumby,2011-05-10T02:44Z,"Many thanks!

Love that it's in HD. who cares about file size!"
,udp2,2011-05-10T06:34Z,"jorrell0733, it's really cool you take so much time to rip even the practice sessions!

There are, however, those of us who don't have the bandwidth for files this big (and ~1GB looks good enough when it's more about the action on track anyhow).

Currently, SAFCukO09 is uploading files around 2GB, so that's covered for the time being.

There's no right and wrong when you're doing us all a favor, but in the future (especially if no one else is uploading), that's a factor you may want to take into consideration.

Again, many thanks for your efforts!"
,rbertb,2011-05-10T14:27Z,What a guy!!!  I must thank you for all your hard work.  We watch it live on speed tv and then download all your uploads and watch it all again.  The BBC does a much better job hands down and I have to thank you again for making it available for us to watch. CHEERS
,farhan_raja,2011-05-10T20:44Z,"Jorrell0733 I havent got enough words to say how thankful I am for your hard work. I love your HD F1 uploads and look forward to them.
I have recently moved from UK to Pakistan (bad move I know) and StarSports coverage of F1 is SHIT!! Its handy to know that I can download your BBC Race and enjoy the 'professional' production and coverage by Jake, Martin, Eddie & DC.
Keep up the good work mate!!!"
[T],reactor90,2011-05-11T00:21Z,We could use good uploaders at RU. would you like to defect into a private site? message me on the forum. reactor903
,Phraed,2011-05-11T07:02Z,Thanks so much man. China was awesome. can't wait to see Turkey! Really appreciate your work.
,gfbgfb,2011-05-11T19:56Z,lets talk add me linesogscajr @ h0tmail d0t com
,hoaha,2011-05-14T04:25Z,Great! Thank you so much
,bloodred125,2011-05-15T22:57Z,"is there anyway you can compress videos in a rar file and upload it so its smaller? HD is awsome but when files get to 8GB's , thats way to large. Even though im happy that someone is actually uploading F1 this year :):)"
