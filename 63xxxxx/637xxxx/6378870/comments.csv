,Titouf2609,2011-06-21T15:33Z,With this one I can't play LAN games anymore... Anyone knows how to do ?

If you want to play LAN follow theses steps:
1. Download xvi32 (hex editor. its free)
2. Open the skidrow.ini with xvi32
3.You'll see SKIDROW, just change that to the LAN name you want (make sure its 7 characters though)
4. Save and now go enjoy LAN.
Some people think that this patch makes it so only 2 people can play LAN and that's a load of crap. Just make sure everyone changes their names from skidrow to something else."
,Bvrns,2011-06-29T00:54Z,".ini files are standard text files, doofus. You don't need a bloody hex editor for them; they can be opened and modified in notepad."
,tontraub,2011-07-04T03:03Z,"Is there any chance to get the new update (.332)? It changes a lot of things, and I cant wait to play it, however, a week has past and nobody released it... :/ Pozdrav"
