Chapel Club
Palace (2011)




A throwback to the Manchester scene, specifically the sound of the Smiths, Chapel Club formed in the summer of 2008 in London. Guitarist Michael Hibbert founded the group along with drummer Rich Mitchell, vocalist Lewis Bowman, and childhood friends bassist Liam Arklie and guitarist Alex Parry. After much debate, Chapel Club were ultimately named as a reference to St. Lukeâ€™s Church, where the band practiced. After the group made waves in England with live performances, debut single "Surfacing" was released at the end of 2009, and followed up with a second single, "O Maybe I," on East City Recordings in February 2010. Chapel Club continued touring throughout the year while recording their atmospheric debut album, Palace, which was released in early 2011.
