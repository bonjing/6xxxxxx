
Lady Gaga Judas WEB 720p x264 2011 FRAY INT[ICM369]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the epic creation myth of Mother Monster in "Born This Way," 
the video for Lady Gaga's "Judas" feels modest by comparison; here 
she's merely co-opting the foundational story of the entire Christian 
faith. 

Gaga presents the video as "a motorcycle Fellini movie," and in a sense, 
that's precisely what we get. 

She's invoked the Italian auteur in the past, notably with the gigantic 
fish set piece of her Monster Ball Tour, and Fellini's influence is 
apparent here in the pushing of Catholic iconography to lurid excess. 

Interspersed throughout the dance-heavy videoâ€”directed by Laurieann Gibson, 
Gaga's longtime choreographerâ€”is the story of Jesus (Rick Gonzalez) and his 
apostles, reconfigured as an outlaw motorcycle gang with Gaga as Mary Magdalene. 

Gaga leans heavily on the iconography: Jesus is crowned with glittering, 
jewel-encrusted thorns, and there are golden crosses strewn all over the place.

It's music video as mystery play, taking advantage of the form's penchant for 
slow motion and rapid cutting to present the story in a series of imagistic 
tableaux.  

As always, the whole production is visually stunning, and there's an illicit
energy that comes from putting Gaga-as-Magdalene center stage. 

The video ends with the death of neither Judas nor Jesus, but of Gaga as she's 
stoned to death by the crowd. 

For all its beauty, however, "Judas" is the work of a repertory, not a 
revolutionary,it takes familiar swatches from Gaga's palette (the leather-and-
chain aesthetic of "Telephone"; the plaintive, tear-stained camera stare of 
"Bad Romance") and puts them all together for a competently executed work. 

It's Born This Way's "LoveGame": an energetic clip that effectively translates 
the track into visual form, with a few powerful grace notes to recommend it, but 
it leaves open the possibility that the album's true visual signature is still 
yet to come
