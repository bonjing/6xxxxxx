,snowsquirrel,2011-05-07T23:14Z,"You're welcome, it took me awhile to compile all of it, figured I'd share!"
,rolstoel123,2011-05-09T20:01Z,i appriciate it. But you cant seed 24/7 then? I will seed 30mb but i only have 0.5% now.
,snowsquirrel,2011-05-10T12:18Z,"No, I can't seed 24/7 sorry. I am offline while I am at the office. Just stick with it. I will keep seeding forever on this one so you will get it sooner or later."
,snowsquirrel,2011-05-10T12:19Z,"Are you DL'ing the lot, or just a piece of the collection?"
,willen93,2011-07-22T20:34Z,"First of all i need to say a fews words to you snowsquirrel.
I don't know how to thank you but i can say it what this collection represents to me. I live in brazil and tolkien's works are very expensive to buy it and i can't buy it them all. when i found this torrent here, indeed made my night and day and so on. Thannks for all this! Now i have a way to read and dream with tolkien's work! Again, thank you."
,snowsquirrel,2011-08-07T17:44Z,"@willen93 Thanks brother, hope you enjoy it."
