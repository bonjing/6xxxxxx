,ABosno,2011-08-09T22:42Z,"Hey Amir,

I've downloaded your torrent and started installation. Disk 1 was OK, but when it came to disk 2, i had some problems. Install wizard couldn't find some files like EFLC.exe.
What's wrong? Seems like you forgot to UL some files. If you can help me, help."
,ABosno,2011-08-10T16:43Z,"EDIT: Oh sorry, I didn't crack it. I'm so dumb.

But now, i'm experiencing a different problem - when I start EFLC exe message pops up saying:
""SecuLauncher: failed to start application. [2000]""

Help?"
