[V],MeMar,2011-05-12T16:25Z,"Geen idee Hans,
te zien echter aan het commentaar op Demonoid schijnt de film nogal wat stof te doen opwaaien. Ik ga hem zeker kijken, ik weet alleen niet wanneer ik daar de tijd voor vrij kan maken :)"
,tai69,2011-05-13T02:13Z,"This is more Jewish propaganda in order to justify the Jews stealing the Palestinians land...the Jews always portray themselves as the eternal victims. Forget the fact that more Russians were butchered under Stalin, or that more Chinese were killed under Mao. Forget the fact that the 6 million number doesn't add up or that experts have said that no one was killed by gas, the holocaust is the worst tragedy of the last century...yeah right "

,zutty,2011-05-17T20:11Z,"comments like tal's only solidify the ignorance and presence of evil in this world. Thank you for showing just how important a film like this is, for if there weren't people like you the world would surely be a better place. Keep on hating, it just proves that ignorance is bliss."
,prasnto,2011-08-25T04:49Z,"Extras included: An interview with Uwe Boll, Premiere footage at a film festival.

Extras stripped: Historical footage of the liberation of Auschwitz, Production Photos.

Can you please either upload an untouched DVD9 that includes ALL extras and doesn't compress the video, or upload an XviD rip of the historical footage?

In general, please don't strip out any content."
