,tyrabit,2011-05-30T15:35Z,"does not install on windows xp, installer corrupted. 
why the fuck did you have to zip it into 4 files and ant then rar it into 4 files?? "
,waterbong,2011-06-09T02:03Z,It's not just XP.  Installer corrupted on 7x64 too.  Skip this one.
,Tatletz,2011-06-29T07:41Z,"Same problem ""Installer corrupted/broken""
Such a waste of time uploader."
,brianxxx,2011-07-03T16:36Z,"Worked fine for me on Windows 7 x64. Try re-downloading.

But mine expired. Probably because I did not block with firewall."
,letheaqua,2011-08-22T06:23Z,"Same problem for me""Installer corrupted/broken"""
,number_1_n1nja,2011-10-10T00:17Z,Ditto with the problem
,bzrwon,2011-10-28T11:50Z,"Simple solution is to download the original .exe from Slysoft, then use the keygen, just make sure you do the usual steps, like disconnect from the net first before entering the serial/license/reg info. :)"
,bzrwon,2011-10-28T11:55Z,"In fact, you can still use your old 2.9.2.8 serial to register this, just tried it then, worked for me, lol. "
,lobster169,2012-01-22T22:38Z,Does NOT work! Garbage..
