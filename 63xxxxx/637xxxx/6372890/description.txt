                           The Complete Season 3


The FBI teams up with a formerly-institutionalized scientist - who was performing experiments on the fringe of real science - and his son to investigate weird crimes that are seemingly part of a larger pattern, and may be connected with a global company called Massive Dynamics.

Season 3 presents episodes that alternate between the two universes. "Walternate", Walter's doppelgÃ¤nger in the parallel universe, has set events in motion to assemble a doomsday device that reacts only to Peter's biology, sending his Olivia, "Fauxlivia", into the prime universe in Olivia's place to get close to Peter and guide him to find and study additional device components. Olivia, trapped in the parallel universe, is subjected to experimentation by Walternate to explore her Cortexiphan-induced powers. She is able to escape to her own universe using her Cortexiphan abilities and expose Fauxlivia to Peter, but has difficulty coming to emotional grips with Fauxlivia's influence on Peter and her life. The prime universe has also found the parts and assembled their version of the doomsday device, though prior to her return to the parallel universe, Fauxlivia was able to withdraw a key component and send it to the parallel universe. Upon her return, Fauxlivia discovers she is pregnant with Peter's child.
