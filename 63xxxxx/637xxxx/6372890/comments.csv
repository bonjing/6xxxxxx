,dantronica,2011-08-31T22:12Z,zomg why is this torrent so slow? :/
,redactedwv,2011-10-08T02:21Z,"GO ELSEWHERE FOR EPISODE 1, at least (only one i've seen so far). It's one of those oh-so-fucking-annoying files that some asshole has added their own personal trailer to.

---> Was about to 'submit', but stopped to check the info above. Down near the bottom it's mentioned that episode one was ""recoded to integrate trailer"". Nice, huh? At least they included a special subtitle file made to correct the time lapse that the trailer created, right? Oh...no....wait....They didn't bother. Lovely!

On behalf of everyone that depends on subtitles.... Thanks! Thanks for the stupid fucking trailer! Ever so thoughtful, and it really improved the seed!

After all, the most important thing isn't creating/maintaining a complete, functional collective file repository using the highest quality source available to the uploader - it's self aggrandizement and advertising! Hurray for personal 'glory' at the expense of the integrity of the source! Hurray for crap!

Perhaps next time it might be worth including a special 'absurd bullshit' edition .srt.

IMH2ĂÂ˘O. obviously enough.

Having said all that (moments after discovering my archive copy had been encoded w/ a goofy ad that caused the subtitles to be totally out of sync), thx for the rest of the seed. From the info, it would appear ep 1 is the only one that's fucked up - so sincere thx for the rest."
[V],manOtor,2011-10-11T19:42Z,"Hi redactedwv,
'tis me, the asshole ;).

I usually don't feed the trolls, but sometimes I just have to respond...

- ""Down near the bottom it's mentioned that episode one was ""recoded to integrate trailer"".""

That's right. It is mentioned in the description.
Just read before download and you know what you're up to ;).

- ""After all, the most important thing isn't creating/maintaining a complete, functional collective file repository using the highest quality source available to the uploader - it's self aggrandizement and advertising! Hurray for personal 'glory' at the expense of the integrity of the source! Hurray for crap!""

Well, I am doing this for fun! That(!) is the most important thing to me! Having fun with what I do here! You should be happy, that I don't let any crappy comment like yours spoil the fun for me ;).
The quality loss of the 1st episode is minimal and as far as the self aggrandizement goes, that is one way to see it. The other point of view would be, that I am doing those teaser and trailer thingies for fun! I simply don't care if anyone likes it or hates it ;).
You think it is crap? Why bother downloading it, then?

- ""At least they included a special subtitle file made to correct the time lapse that the trailer created, right? Oh...no....wait....They didn't bother. Lovely!""
First of all you can talk to/about me in singular - it's just me ;).
I bet you include subtitles in all of your uploads, right? Oh...no...wait...You've never uploaded anything at all, ever. Lovely!

Oh, and your opinion is anything but humble and obviously more than enough ;)...

Sincere thx for nothing but being unappreciative!
---> Was about to 'submit', but checked your comment again and saw that you at least thanked me for the ""not fucked up"" rest.
Well, that's big of ya ;).

Cheers"
,Mr.AquuaH,2011-10-12T05:46Z,thnx m8
,Xeginy,2011-10-13T06:43Z,"thanks for the download.

no need to rip into @redactedwv, though. those trailers at the beginning of the first episode are REALLY annoying. part of the reason I download torrents is to get away from the commercials. even sites like Hulu have mandatory commercial breaks. I'm certainly not faulting them for it, I understand how funding for stuff like that works, but that doesn't mean I have to watch it.

you, on the other hand, are doing this voluntarily, rather than attempting to run a business (and thus make a profit). if you cram some trailers onto the first episode, I'm allowed (as is anyone else) to be really, really annoyed. I'm even allowed to bitch about it, without you undermining anyone's arguments without some bullshit fallacy, ""if you don't upload, you can't complain.""

in conclusion, commercials = annoying. but all in all, the whole thing was great. audio and video were good, and thanks."
[V],manOtor,2011-10-18T01:33Z,"@Xeginy:

You are right: everyone is allowed to be annoyed and to bitch about it... - as I am allowed to bitch back.
I thought his comment to be hilarious and was just in the mood to make fun of it :P!
If he would have told me in some other manner (like you for instance - I mean you even had the decency to say thanks in the end) and added some productive criticism, I would have done it politely, if I would have answered at all.

And you are right again: I do this voluntarily, and as I want to have fun while doing so, I create and add those little trailers and teasers (which some people even appreciate) :).
BTW: I really don't understand the hustle about it - just skip what you don't like ;).

Cheers"
,ninjasquirrel81,2011-10-22T23:04Z,"Bitch bitch bitch thats all you people ever seem to do.

Don't like his trailer being in the first episode? Don't download it, get it from somewhere else.

Did I like that the first episode here was muddled with his crappy trailer? No, did I sit through it? Well the one at the end I did but only because I was too lazy to get up and skip to the next episode.

Point is all of these episodes are readily available here from other sources, nobody put a gun to your head and made you download this one, nobody put a gun to your head and forced you to watch his crappy trailers (sorry dude but they were crappy). 

Just take the 5 seconds it takes to skip past them and move on with your life."
,ninjasquirrel81,2011-10-22T23:07Z,"Almost forgot, trailer aside this was a great torrent, thank you manOtor."
,abriljant,2011-10-28T21:24Z,ths torrent is missing episodes and the ones that are here are named incorrectly!! this is so fucking typical...why are you all seeding it???
,TedLilly,2011-12-13T02:35Z,thanks for the up
,nsofast,2011-12-14T04:22Z,"manOtor you are only part of the life of a torrent so get the fuck off your high horse.This is science fiction, for many of us pirates the most important files we share.
 These files are downloaded and shared by people who expect not to have a bunch of garbage as part of the deal.
 If this was some obscure stuff that would not have seen the light of day without you, I would be willing to put up with your shitty attitude.BUT THIS FUCKING TORRENT ROBS SEEDERS FROM TORRENTS MADE BY BETTER MEN THAN YOU! 
If you had not uploaded this crap, all the seeders would be supporting a garbageless post.
People are angry because you are pissing in the fucking pool.We do not need you.
Shape up or get the fuck out."
,jannes9,2012-01-09T17:19Z,"Lol at some of the comments regarding the build in trailers in manOtor's torrents. 
I remember the VHS time and those were full of trailers. I loved those trailers cuz you got to see what was coming..
I rented about two videos a weekend which contained an average of three to five trailers each ! My girlfriend loved them too and although it meant that i had to watch the occasional chickflick it also meant happy times on the couch :P 
Also, OP and others take a lot of effort and time in uploading good stuff which you download for the price of fuck all !!!
I have downloaded from manOtor before and have come to appreciate his torrents. 
I haven't the slightest idea how to make one myself, i'm guessing most of you don't either, so what is your butthurt exactly ???
@ manOtor ; Thanks for this upload.

Thanks for the great up manOtor."
,werdbooty,2012-03-01T18:06Z,"Simple Solution A: Cut the trailer from the first episode and include it in the torrent as a separate file anyway.

Simple Solution B: Get off the uploader's back, suck it up, learn how to use video editing software, and cut the trailer from the episode yourself once you're done d/l'ing.

Simple Solution C: Enjoy the fact that you just picked up 7 and a half gigs of FREE episodes with NO TRAILER, and thank the uploader for this good quality torrent.

Thanks mate. I agree, the trailer is a pain, but I see what you did there. Great quality, btw!"

,Under_Dog,2012-05-08T09:22Z,"So many people bitching about some 11 minute trailer nonsense in the first episode..I must be the only person that has fast forward or scene skip.

Seriously, bitch about something else or go buy the box set, faggots."
,Anonymous_Legend,2012-05-20T21:32Z,"i normally dont give bad reviews but this turrent desearves one. i could only put up with the first episode and after that deleted the entire thing. 

there was an 11 minute trailer in the begining, and at the end. but thats not the least of it, the quality was also poor but the audio was good.
