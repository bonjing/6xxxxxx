,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-09T13:25Z,"Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for this--one of the best movies ever made in my not so humble opinion.  Means I can now get rid of my home-encoded HIGHLY PIXELLATED 717MB version made with Gordian Knot and XVID back in 2004.  I'm so grateful I'm even downloading (and seeding) all the miscellaneous language subtitles that I can neither speak nor understand.
:D :) :) :) !!!!"
