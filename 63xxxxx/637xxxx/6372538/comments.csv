,workit,2011-05-16T12:50Z,You should make it MORE CLEAR that this is for MAC. Goddamnit.
[V],polisdavid,2011-05-19T10:02Z,"workit,

Isn't this the MAC applications folder?

I think you should read which directory you are in, before making stupid comments like that."

,Pirate-GURU,2011-12-21T04:53Z,"polisdavid,
in your instruction, the very first line you've asked to install trial version using Bryce3D-kg.app but its a keygen app and how do you install trial using a keygen? i couldn't make it work but not sure if its crashing for OSX Lion 10.7.2. the app crashes as soon as i enter the registration key. any advice will be appreciated. "
,XyonN1980,2012-01-21T12:02Z,"I have the same issue with Bryce. As soon as i press enter after copying the serial, i get a beach ball of death and Bryce quits directly. I have a 2008 17"" MBP, 2TB disk and 4 GB mem, running Mac OS X 10.7.2. I believe Bryce is incompatible with Lion...

Gr,
XyonN"
,XyonN1980,2012-01-21T12:06Z,"Whoops, for anybody having problems with Lion, Daz3D.com indeed states that it is incompatible with Lion. So hold on to your hats, my free software lovers... :D"
