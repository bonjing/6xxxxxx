Also i was wondering is you have the subtitles for all your downloads? Or can refer me to a website where their subtitles will sync with your uploads? Im trying to burn these episodes to DVDs using DVDFlick. Thank You for any help! And also to the rest, I have been seeding these for over a week, and will continue to do so :]."
