,stormrage2007,2011-05-08T15:59Z,"Don't be faggots. Buy the damn game. GOG.com offers no DRM and a preload option (in 2 days).
If you know you're gonna enjoy this game so much, why not give money to the devs to make another, even better game. I know you won't be able to play the game till May 17th, and only then scene hackers can begin working on a crack, because right now there is nothing to crack, so if you buy the game, you will be able to play sooner and it will be much more convenient to download updates and free dlc (there won't be $$ dlc, only free, at least for a while)with ease, and not wait for SKIDROW to crack every single patch.
And 45$ is not a lot, unless you're from Australia, then you're pretty much fucked. Can't say anything good about that. I advice you to immigrate to some better place where they don't charge double the price and censor the shit out of games. "
,71460,2011-05-08T16:24Z,Well my pirate friends. This game I wont download. I will buy it. They are putting a lot of effort to make this a amazing experience for PC gamers. They deserve my coins lol

I want the old PC games back. With huge maps, huge stories, lots of creativity, free roam. Today it's everything made for kids in their idiotized consoles. Stupids FPS railshoot, stupids rpgs with 10 hour gameplay. Look what happened to Crysis..Very sad times to PC players indeed."

There are multiple reasons why games are not as compelling/challenging/interesting as they used to be. It's not directly a fault of ""consolization"" of the industry. It's mostly because it's AN INDUSTRY now (hey, we had consoles back in 80s!). Now people with money decide what's to be made and they aren't willing to risk; why do that when kids today are used to being spoon-fed yearly Call of Duty clones?
You don't have many options there. Either accept the facts and go with the flow while enjoying the few gems that there are or quit gaming altogether. Or hell, even fire up dosbox and play some good old RPGs like Realms of Arkania or Betrayal at Krondor.
It's NOT a fault of piracy either. It's an excuse and a sketchy at best. PIRACY WAS ALWAYS THERE. There were fucking bootleg NES/SNES cartridges! PC crackers were around since 80's. People quit making PC exclusives simply because it's cheaper and more reliable to cater to a wider not-so-picky audience. It's a fact of life.
So it's everyone's choice to buy or download the game, the point is there is no changing the state of affairs. If everyone on here will buy every game they currently have an image of and then die in spasms of shame (so they wouldn't download anymore) it won't change anything.
Having said that, I only with the best of luck to CD Projekt and hope they get as many sales as they deserve to. Godspeed."

Just scare-tactic bullshit, they can't actually make you pay anything without taking you to court (and costing themselves alot more than they can gain)

If you ever get any notifications like that of some faggot screaming that you owe them ""a fine"" ignore it, or mail them a baggy of catshit. Whichever amuses you. "

,cyril19,2011-05-09T21:49Z,"the best reason to download a game is to try before you buy. Fox example you'd expect bioshock 2 to be simular to the first game however without the usb support for xbox 360 controller the game is not interesting for me and I've only tried the downloaded game for maybe 30 minutes. I bought gta4 before I played and after 10 minutes I started throwing with the dvd's because the game is so gta3 like. Game devellopers should maybe spend less time worrying about copyrights and maybe spend some more time on making better games so that people want to buy the originals. Currently I'm not able to buy this game because buying the game would mean I couldn't buy food for an entire month (somehow copywright people never think about it that way)

Waiting for the englisg version of this game and then I'll download. (p.s. I've gotr the witcher 1- extended edition original, the problem isn't that I don't want to buy original good games, I just like to eat and pay rent)."

we are all registered to a pirate website.

we have all download things here.

stealing is not black and white...it is not ""you either steal everything or steal nothing""

what we have here are alot of people with robin hood complexes (swim included) who believe that certain companies and developers do not deserve a successful product, and do not deserve our money due to the output of a shoddy product or a disregarding attitude towards pc gaming.

those same people believe that an independent company, who has risked personal gain and popularity in order to not only create a truly unique and substantial product but also cater to the pc crowd, deserves our money and also deserves to be defended on this forum against the flat out thieves who dont know the difference between embezzling money from a billion dollar corporation who doesnt deserve it, and robbing a mom and pop store.

,Nadldnas,2011-05-12T11:57Z,"Another nice thing CDProjekt has done is that Australia usually gets screwed over by the publishers there, as in ridiculously expensive games and cut content.

The Witcher 2 was no different as their publisher in that region increased the price and forced CDProjekt to change a few scenes in order for it to get approved.

What does CDProjekt do then? The next day they remove their geo tracking IP from their retail website, meaning that it does not track if the region you have entered is your real one. Which enables the AUS region to get the unaltered version for ~30$ less :) "

Also, there are more screenshots already showing off full interface, certainly of the beginning of the game.

Bottom line is that this could be the last AAA game semi-exclusive to PC, ever.  By semi-exclusive, I mean it will be coming out on consoles later, but it's being designed for the PC first and foremost.  Other than this, we can look forward to some Blizzard titles and that's about it.  Support CD Projekt, guys.  Fable 3 is coming out on the same day (the 17th), and that game is surely a piece of shit.  Pirate that one just out of the principle of the thing and buy Witcher 2."

The issue isn't whether or not CDPR -want- to come out with console versions of their games, the issue is that they need publishers and need MS/Sony to want their games on their systems as well (as well as the aspect of the games actually working on their systems). CDPR has stated multiple times that TW2 is very much a PC game with included gamepad support, I doubt anything has been ""dumbed down"". I can play tons of PC games with a gamepad just fine (just not FPS), and they're very obviously PC titles. I already bought TW2, but I'm seeding this anyway because I'd like as many people as possible to play and enjoy this game (buy it if you ever can though, I'm sure it will be worth it).

Dude, that absolutely does not work... it's frustrating when people talk crap so why do that?

Also people justifying that they're pirating because the game is not available in your country for purchase or because your poor, that's just bullshit excuses.  The game is available through online downloadable methods to ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD for very cheap and really, the only excuse to use is that you just don't WANT to pay for it because you can get it free because you're a tight arse stooge.

I am here, I want to get a copy of it going because I want to play it early, however I only ever use downloadable copies of games like this to 'try before I buy' when developers don't provide a demo.  In this case, I've already paid and simply want to play early.

Honestly, If you're going to pirate you're going to pirate - I can't do anything about it and giving you shit isn't going to stop you, but just consider what it is you're affecting when you're pirating - especially on PC because it hurts the industry.  This means less high quality PC exclusive games like the Witcher available to the people who want to play them."

I didn't judge u dude, did you not read my post? If you did, then perhaps my tone or delivery was off.

I don't care that you pirate games (well I do care because people who pirate games such as this, ESPECIALLY this game) are HURTING the industry.  It's not like it's expensive, check gog.com or whatever.  Even as such, if you were never going to buy the game anyway, then you're never going to buy the game - I kind of don't care what your damn excuse is, but stop trying to justify yourself as 'not a bad person' and that you're not doing the wrong thing because you can't afford it or your 'reasons' to pirate - there are no reasons to pirate other than that you want to get something for free that you otherwise should be paying for.  It is stealing, pure and simple.  It's not like stealing a granny's purse, but it is still stealing money from the pockets of the hard working people who are bringing you this brilliant game. People who think there is nothing wrong with piracy are deluding themselves.  If you're gonna pirate a game, pirate Skyrim because that's gonna sell millions but by Witcher, it's a PC exclusive, as PC gaming fans we need this game to sell as many as possible to ensure that more games of this quality are made for the PC you see.  You don't see this kind of talk going on on Pirate Bay very often, it's just the nature of this game that it would be better not to pirate.

But people who are complaining on a PIRACY site about the consolisation of a game are complete fucken dickwits, absolutely the lowest of the low scum of the earth as it because of people who pirate PC games that console versions of every PC game is a Console port these days, yet the pirate is complaining... what a fucken loser man."

It annoys me when there are few games that are developed with the PC as the lead platform with the reason of 'piracy' cited as why.

You would think this would be a reason to deter more people, but in the end - most of the people how pirate are just selfish assholes.

@ SynapsisXXX

Pretty words indeed, I just signed up today because of the interesting comments I made here.  I don't believe that all game developers deserve their game to be purchased and thus, I like to try before I buy.  In the case that I try a game and I don't like it, I generally don't play it any more after that.  If I paid full price for that game I wouldn't be very happy.  If they offer a demo for such game I wouldn't need to download from TPB but these days, PC demo's are a rarity so it's required.

I want to get TW2 so I can play early.  Have already pre-ordered and paid for my copy, only reason I want to get a copy from here is because I'm finding the wait unbearable.  TW2 is the kind of game where the developers deserve the money, however BRINK I think is an example where (in the state it was released) the developers do not deserve all the sales.

You can say that i'm arguing semantics, but people pirate for all different reasons - I myself have a huge gaming collection and I don't play a game for more than a couple of hours if it's pirated, I'll buy the game if I like it and I want to play it."
,Cogollito,2011-05-14T13:47Z,"@justaguynamed

I think that most pirates cannot afford to buy every game on the market. As I, on my country foreign products are extremly expensive, and I'm not rich, to be expending $200 bucks for every game I would like to have. And worst of all, TW2 wont be released in my country, so the only way to buy it is by Steam, and I dont have a credit card.."

,eqzitara,2011-05-14T23:26Z,I want to download and play game early but I bought game and own it on d2d. No idea why you guys are being dicks to people who want you to buy games. If no one buys games guess what company goes out of business and no more games. Probably 1/4-1/3 video game companies went of business in last 5 years. I see no problem with not paying for shitty games but if a game was good and you enjoyed and it was worth money why not?

Blizzards starcraft 2 sold 1.5 million copies on the first day. So..... 1.500.000 x 40 euro = 60.000.000 euro ON THE FIRST DAY ONLY!!!! 

In all fairness let's say that all the costs of printing, marketing, transportation and game development etc... cost  20.000.000 euro (which is of course totally absurd i think it didn't even get above 5 mil) can you imagine how big a ripoff this gaming industry is...
...so chew on that for a while than tell me that games aren't overpriced! Besides where i come from 40 euro is 1/10th of monthly paycheck of minimal wage. So giving hard earned money to money grabbing fucks is kinda stupid. Especially if the game sucks! I think witcher 2 won't suck and i liked the first one but 40 euro is still 4 times to much."

So in Japan, Australia, New-Zealand and similar the date is already 17th... they could upload the files without problem. This is why I don't understand why don't we have a crack yet."

,Jcanon,2011-05-16T19:37Z,"I'm just downloading this one ^, just in case if it would work with upcoming crack afterall. Site seems popular and it's uploaded by adminstrator so i don't think it's fake (Pics pics!) Grr if it only would go with Skidrow version crack, it would be great :)"

My version of windows apparently didn't have the resources to give the install folders the proper names in RU so they substituted gibberish....which the patches don't count as being the proper file path..etc etc. update if I figure it out."
