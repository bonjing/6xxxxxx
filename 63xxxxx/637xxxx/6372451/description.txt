And here you go, an OLD euro comic that i found in a used book store, an euro classic by Loisel, Roxanna and the Quest for the Time-Bird. Hopefully someone will have book 2-4 and scan scan those, because i dont have access to them.


The world of Akbar is in danger. Ramor, the cursed god, is about to be liberated. The sorceress Mara has found a way to prevent the gods resurrection and to bound him again to his prison, a conch. To succeed during the incantation however, she needs the legendary Time-Bird, a mythical beast able to control the flow of time. She sends her daughter, Roxanna to a past lover, Bragon, once a fearsome warrior, now a gray-haired lord of the manor, to convince the aging hero to embark on one last adventure in order to save the world of Akbar.

One of the good point of the comics, apart for the character of Roxanne and RÃ©gis Loisels vivid depiction of the fantasy world of Akbar, its faune and flora, is the melancholic mood that permanates the whole story. how aging heroes deal with their fading glory, how villains accept their past and manage to find peace, and how young heroes arise, take their predecessor place and learn to accept their first losses.
