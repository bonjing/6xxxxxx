,otto_eisenbrot,2011-09-03T22:05Z,There is a virus in the patch!
,Saitekman,2011-09-09T23:54Z,Scanned and found a Trojan.  Do not download or install this.  Hate downloading .exe files.  They are always trouble for the most part.  Uploader should be banned from this site.
,BDSMers,2012-02-26T00:35Z,"guys, what is a patch... its a friggin peice of software that convinces the program its legit, its a virus/trojan/ accoprding to a antivirus scanner because its designed to BYPASS restraints on the original program. If you dont want to risk it, dont download it, but please remember that guys with skulls have been granted a status by TPB that is not awarded to virus merchants"
