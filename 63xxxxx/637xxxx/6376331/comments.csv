,xnaevs,2012-06-08T05:11Z,"axel_aj is right, but if you use VLC, which is the only media player anyone should use:

Go to: Tools - Preferences - Subtitles & OSD - Force Subtitle Position -300px (or however much it takes). 

That works for me, it forces both the bottom subs & top subs to the bottom without it going off the screen.

I don't know how to put subtitles below the video in the black, which is my ultimate preference, oh well..."
