Recorded:  Winter 1994
Label:Ichiban
Format:Mp3@320


From the album notes:

The winter of 1994 in Chicago was particularly brutal. The kind of freezing, miserable winter that can numb your soul and give you the blues. Blues and pain. The influence of these conditions are behind this new Jimmy Dawkins release. Jimmy stuffed his amp in the trunk of his Cadillac, grabbed his big guitar and his drummer Ray Scott, and drove straight on through from Chicago to Atlanta. The next two days were spent holed up in KALA studios, where Jimmy and the band ripped into the piercing, tormented set of blues contained on this disc. The only luxury was that we had 16 ounce beers instead of the regular kind. Producer Bryan Cole and engineer Edd Miller silently smiled at each other as the tape ran and the shredding guitar lines sprang forth from Jimmy's trademark Gibson. The reigning king of Chicago's west side expelled all the feelings that had built up after extensive international road travel. Blues and Pain is a volcanic eruption of soul, made all the more intense by turning up the volume. Crank it !
