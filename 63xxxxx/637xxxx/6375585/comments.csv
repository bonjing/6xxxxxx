,technosailor,2011-09-26T17:56Z,The audio is AAC/MP4?
,ManoloCIA,2011-12-09T17:55Z,Great sci-fi horror.
,TaiTheGuy,2012-03-07T17:26Z,"This movie is really, super-sweet. I mean- I hate lots of movies, but this one's friggin' awesome!
And, I like to imagine that this has to do with the same planet as avatar. Maybe @ a different time, or alternate reality.
Not that I thought Avatar was a great movie- cause it really wasn't. Fuckin cliche bad guy fighting in his robo-bionic-machine-suit @ the end- weak. I prefer Pandorum. (probly cost 10% as much to make too)."
