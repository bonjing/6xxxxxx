ok so after what seems like years of searching for the complete Rolling Stones Studio Discography all i could find was a whole bunch of bullshit compilations... i had to hunt down these albums and after that i felt i was obliged to share with you guys. There is no live albums here or compilations for they always seem to give you about a million repeats and i fucken hate that.... i hope u enjoy
