,Vigola,2011-05-14T02:23Z,"Try marking all rar files and click Extract here.

[T],Shepard76,2011-05-14T14:29Z,Thanks! Can I update it after installing it without losing crack activation ? 
,dbee16,2011-05-15T01:32Z,"when i download it i get lots of zip folders.. do i extract all of them?
also what is the .diz file for?"
,Stamax338,2011-05-15T10:36Z,"When I try to extract Universe sandbox setup it says: Next volume is required, You need to select the following volume to continue the extraction. wtf do I do?"
,Thundernail,2011-05-15T21:17Z,"Good game, however, it was RARed in a retarded way. probably saved me 10 sec download time and gave me 120 sec to decrypt the rar."
,Richer07,2011-05-15T21:24Z,"I got it.. thanks maan

,BioHaZZarD99,2011-05-17T19:32Z,"Installer is in a stupid double-rar. highlight each one, and ""extract here"" hitting yes to all. Then right click the first of the news ones and extract here again, then run universe-sandbox-setup.exe. Copy over cracked files, and -1 people on TPB who double rar. Useless!"
,jowjowjow,2011-05-18T14:33Z,"Everything extraded wonderful. After copying the Activation dll it works sweet.

To be honest: I will buy this game, its worth it and only US$9.95"
,tech.33,2011-05-19T02:12Z,"To get the game Full, go to 
MainMenu> Settings> ""I already bought act. code"" 
And Type anything in the ID field and you'll get the full game.   
I did random numbers.. example: 163857837 "

,rulerdude,2011-06-21T22:26Z,"@mitsman89 select all the .zip files and extract them. Then select all the .rar files that were just extracted, and extract them. You need to extract them all at the same time."
,DMiBY,2011-07-05T16:48Z,"Awesome. Downloaded in about 12 seconds xD Nice compression.

Follow what Wolfcry said about installation and activation:

1. Unpack the release with WinRAR or equivalent 
2. Install by running universe-sandbox-setup 
3. Copy the content from the included Unleashed folder to installation 
folder 
4. Start game (read activation process info below) 
5. Enjoy! 

Activation Notes: 

Go to game options - click on the ENTER YOUR PRODUCT KEY button and 
type anything in to activate it.


Will continue to seed. Thanks. Might buy this if it is on Steam summer sale."
,iora,2011-07-14T22:43Z,"I've tried about a thousand different variations for the product key and always just end up with the same warning. 

Product Key Not Valid

Please check your product key and try again.

Universe Sandbox version 1 license codes do not work in version 2.

I give up."
,iora,2011-07-15T03:07Z,"Scratch that, I finally got it to work. It took 4 or 5 tries to extract everything and find the crack folder. It's a very poorly constructed torrent, but, with a bit of work and a minor miracle, it is possible to get everything running properly. 

The program itself is interesting and shows a lot of promise, but it's still a little lacking in terms of features. Most people will probably get bored with it relatively quickly. I think I'll hold off on buying it for the time being, but it's definitely something I'd keep my eye on. It's very good at simulating aspects of the universe such as our solar system. With some expanded features and more flexibility, it very well could become something that would hold my interest for extended periods of time. Until there is more stuff to experiment with though, it feels more like a novelty, and very good teaching tool, than something I could really sink my teeth into. I'm looking forward to seeing how the program evolves."
,JorLeoSun,2011-07-19T09:24Z,"the 'game' itself is very boring. nothing much to do in it. i don't like calling it a game cuz it lacks what makes a game. rather, its a fancy simulation of gravity"
,erikblazer,2011-07-20T07:40Z,"Worked grate with me, if you have problems with the .rars then you should be messing with it, you need to know how to use winrar first.... i love it, cheers mate"
,KhanGirey,2011-07-31T18:53Z,Good setup guide by wolfcry yet not in depth. Once downloaded the folder will contain 8 rars. Highlight them all and extract them to their seperate folders. Once done go to the first unl-unia and extract unl-unis. This is where it gets complicated. You will be brought up a screen which says Next volume required. Browse for unl-unib and just double click on the rar. Do this in alphabetical order and once you get to unl-unih it willl finish. Then go to unl-unia and run the setup.
,AmeNoKarasu,2011-08-03T21:30Z,"I don't get what the hell you're all talking about.

Highlight all .rar files -> right click -> ""unpack here"" -> highlight ""unl-unis.rar"" -> ""unpack here"" -> run the .exe -> copy the ""unleashed"" content into install-dir -> ingame at options choose ""enter serial"" -> type ANYTHING in the form asked for(i used 0000-0000 and so on) and DONE"
,mcm1010,2011-08-21T20:21Z,"its say in a small window on win rar the file is corrupted and yes i extracted all at once


i need help"
,mcm1010,2011-08-21T20:28Z,it also says unexpected end of archive for all except the last
,stoicsilence,2011-12-29T08:30Z,"Ok I've go the program working (after a lot of experimentation) but im still having problems with the product key. I'm entering random numbers and still it doesn't work. 

""Check your product key and try again.

@iora - Where is the Crack folder? I've looked through all the files and there's not a single file or folder that looks anything remotely like a Crack or a KeyGen.

Please be specific on how you managed to activate the full version. Vague directions doesn't help me or anyone with the same problem."
,mojeeq,2012-01-13T00:13Z,"Thanks dude!, appreciate it :)"
,Draginz,2012-01-31T03:14Z,"What if I opted out of having my context menu clogged up with shit I'll only use once, on a poorly constructed torrent? Why are torrents even made like this?"
,CortlinMcMurry,2012-02-20T17:02Z,"For anybody having trouble with the activation key, here's what I did. Download and unrar like usual. Run the setup, then open the Unleashed folder (same location as ""universe-sandbox-setup""). In the folder is a .dll, copy the .dll to the directory that the game saved to, mine was ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Universe Sandbox"". It will ask if you want to replace the file, say yes. Now you will have the full version of the game, and you won't be asked for an activation code."
,Saint.Jimmy.Rotten,2012-05-12T23:42Z,"Downloaded this a few times,the Rar is corrupted and Yes I did what ""KhanGirey"" said.Unleashed usually does great/easy torrents,i'm pretty disappointed in them at the moment,due to the fact I love the game and I actually have to buy it."
,zerosa1,2012-05-29T15:03Z,your shitty torrent has to many Winrars
