~INFO~
Do you remember the last time you fully geeked out? You are about to. Universe Sandbox takes the joyous freeplay of Powder and such into 3D. Astronomical scales are laid out for you with a fully zooming and rotatable camera, trails tie knots and stream like ribbons, light waves pulsate at remarkably slow speeds, time is at your command. You can throw a star through the asteroid belt and see what happens. It brings out the awed child in all of us.

Create and destroy on a scale youâ€™ve never imagined with the ultimate space simulator.
Harness the power to create black holes, collide galaxies, and manipulate gravity with just a few clicks. Inspired by the software astronomers use to unlock the mysteries of our universe, never before has astronomy been so interactive or so much fun.
Spawn a massive moon to tear apart Saturnâ€™s rings or launch a rogue star to rip the planets from their orbits around our sun. After unleashing catastrophic destruction, create your own solar system and share it with friends.
