A boon for aspiring filmmakers, the TromaDance Film Festival encourages wannabe directors to submit their films to the company free of charge. Troma then screens the movies â€” at a number of venues â€” free to the public. The operation is run at low cost â€” no lavish premiere parties or VIP treatment â€” in order to maximize exposure for the films. This video presents some of the best (read: grisly and gory) films that have been submitted.
