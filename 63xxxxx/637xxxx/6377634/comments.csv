,mommyducky,2011-06-27T11:20Z,The sound is horrible on this. Too bad because the video quality is great and it has subtitles so I recommend it only to those who can't hear anyway and are okay with reading subtitles instead of actually hearing it. Ugh. I was so looking forward to watching this and now I'm so disappointed.
