     Will sex ruin a perfect relationship between a man and a woman?  That's
     what Harry (Crystal) and Sally (Ryan) debate during their trip from Chicago
     to New York. And eleven years later, they're still no closer to finding
     the answer. Will these two best friends ever accept that they're meant
     for each other or will they continue to deny the attraction that's existed
     since the first moment When Harry Met Sally?
