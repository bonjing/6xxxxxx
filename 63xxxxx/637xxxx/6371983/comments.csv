,bazquux,2011-05-06T21:52Z,Is there a log file for this and your previous music torrents? This would be v. useful to establish no ripping errors.
[H],politux,2011-05-06T22:16Z,I generally don't bother including a log or cue file but my torrents don't have errors in them.  I listen to the songs before I upload.  If you find one let me know.
