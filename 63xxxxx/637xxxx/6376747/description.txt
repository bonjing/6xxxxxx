OHMphrey, is an American collaborative project formed in January 2008 featuring three members of the Chicago-based jam-band Umphrey's McGee (keyboardist Joel Cummins, guitarist Jake Cinninger and drummer Kris Myers) and OHM guitarist Chris Poland, a legendary player whoâ€™s perhaps best known for work with headbanging pioneers Megadeth, and bassist Robertino Pagliari .

The bands met and played together for the first time at Martyrsâ€™ Restaurant and Pub in Umphreyâ€™s McGeeâ€™s hometown of Chicago. After their Chicago meeting the idea for a collaborative project between the two bands was formed. Soon the opportunity arose to record in a band setting and the five that would become OHMphrey want to Polandâ€™s downtown L.A. studio to rekindle the experience they created months earlier at the Chicago gig. The band recorded over the course of two days resulting in a unique and improv-heavy album.

Complementing and rooting the stratospheric musical moments heard on this record is the rubbery and often tricky rhythmic approach of the Myers-Pagliari/drum-bass tandem. The combination of Myers' complex time grooves and Pagliari's fretless acrobatics (a la Brand X's Percy Jones) lays a powerful foundation that allows immense freedom for the soloists. Poland's virtuosic playing evokes Holdsworth and Beck while Cinninger pulls from a huge array of textures pulled from Pink Floyd to Metallica to Prince. Cummins tastefully adds in both background coloring and a few impressive solo spots of his own.

The band released their self-titled debut "OHMphrey" on May 19, 2009 with Magna Carta Records.
