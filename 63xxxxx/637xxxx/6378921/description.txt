The staff of Fags, Mags and Bags are tireless in their quest to bring nice-price custard creams and cans of coke with Arabic writing on them to an ungrateful nation.

www.comedy.co.uk Review: 
[quote]A fairly middle-of-the-road Scottish radio sitcom. Fags, Mags & Bags has some amusing moments, but if you missed an episode it's probably not something you'd cry about. That said, as the series have progressed, we have started to love this show as we get to know the upbeat characters a bit more... so lets hope there's another series.[/quote]
