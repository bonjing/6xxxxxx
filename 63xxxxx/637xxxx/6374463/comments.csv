,monday89,2011-05-08T00:17Z,Damn. I was really hoping that it was true. But this is a Shitty version of Thor. Sure the auip is great but the video is nowhere near good quality. I would like to know how in the hell this guy thought that this video was good quality? I mean the video has a flicker!! I advise my fellow pirates to wait for a better quality version of Thor. whoever calls this video good quality must be on CRACK!!!

What about downloading the sample before you start wining? And like sushiface2010 said, the upper never stated this was good quality so the only one who's on crack must be you!
