WOW! WTF! This is the worst ridiculous mockbuster knockbuster movie ever. The acting, wardrobe, script, cheap looking plastic and styrofoam weapons, the dialog, plot, etc., it was all shite!!!"

,Revisionist,2011-05-09T18:02Z,Seriouslsy...DONT WASTE YOUR TIME.  Saw this on TV and barely got thru 10 minutes.  Thought Grieco would be campy fun....wrong.  Its just bad.  Really bad.  It is more like a student film. If you must see it HD isnt going to add anything to your viewing pleasure.
