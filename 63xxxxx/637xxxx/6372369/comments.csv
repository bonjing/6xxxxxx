,winfreak,2011-06-25T09:55Z,"awesome upload....clean and working.
who said that it is a virus?"
,etornam,2011-07-02T01:08Z,please help .how do i fix the pacth?
,FuelStream,2011-07-31T00:06Z,"Am I the only one who can't get the patch to work ?
It still asks for a serial when i start the program.

Maybe I made the mistake of letting it run after install berfore ""pathing"".
I closed and ""pathed"", but no go.

I will  try on a fresh image of my test mashine and see how it goes.."
,FuelStream,2011-07-31T00:08Z,Sorry about the spelling and c-key fails.. :)
,Iniquity6,2011-08-07T16:41Z,Patch not working for me either...
,Junna2022,2011-08-07T17:08Z,"Patch did not work for me either.

Hey, DeGun, any suggestions?

In any case, thanks a lot man!"
,kraftx1,2011-08-10T04:30Z,"I Can't Stand Morons like mickeygwhatever, what a stupid Noob!!!  Everyone knows that DeGun posts only First Class torrents and if there are any flags it is just a ""false positive"".  I hope mickeyboy NEVER comes back to your posts as he is a Loser!
Thanks again DeGun for all of your posts!"
,CrazyDarkFlame69,2011-08-28T04:47Z,Run crack as administrator and it should work
,bacjbencher530,2011-08-28T17:11Z,NO VIRUS. IT WORKS. RUN THE PATCH AS THE ADMINISTRATOR OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK (IM USING WINDOWS 7). THE SOFTWARE DIDNT HELP ME THOU................
,MrHosser,2011-08-29T15:38Z,"Ok peops, patch works but when you click on it it says file not found, you need to browse to the place where the program is installed (prob program files - migo) and click on digi rescue app. That will install patch and will work. Sadly hasnt helped much with the 1tb I cant access, what a bitch. Regarding virus, three programs identified trojan but uploader has green scull and other torrents look good. If in doubt do a system restore point but as has been said many times, cracks are often false posatives. Remember these guys are doing us a massive favour and spending alot of their time to share these things with us so before getting abusive look into it. MANY THANKS UPLOADER"
,ixionlynx,2011-09-04T00:21Z,the patch detected by avg as virus
,Bean-Bandit,2011-09-09T12:57Z,This isn't working for me either. When you use the patch and find the target it still comes up as Nothing patched. Might be a VIP for torrents but this thing is NOT working.
,Bean-Bandit,2011-09-09T12:59Z,"Ok scratch what i just said. This is very odd but after 5 times I got the damn thing to patch. Perhaps you needed it to run as admin but i thought i did that before. Maybe i did and maybe i didn't but it is working now.

Thanks"
,noel_lee,2011-10-13T04:56Z,"guys,this is how u should do.
go to the program files>>.....>>digital rescue4 premium>>double click the application file ""DigitalRescue"". it should work.all the best.an thanks degun for this one."
,irfinity,2011-10-17T16:50Z,"Scanned with nod32 ss5. NOT a virus. Yet to check though.
My hard disk has some corrupted drives. Hope this does the trick. Presently tryingwith active file recovery."
,tpboss,2011-10-20T10:28Z,"""Bitdefender Antivirus - Infected file detected! Virus name: Trojan.Generic.5923490""

I don't really care that theres a virus on there cus I have good a.v protection, but just letting you all know."
,long4U92592,2011-11-29T01:53Z,"Nice...  :-)  Run the patch as Admin and you are good to go.

I downloaded the application .exe from http://www.dtransfer.com/downloads/ and ran the patch with no problems."
,Chocobear,2011-12-01T19:56Z,perfect... thank you....... installed on Win 7 ultimate 64 bit.......
