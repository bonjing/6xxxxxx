,moshster,2011-05-07T11:07Z,@AnshulBansal - There is a 10mb sample included
,Hydraah_,2011-05-07T11:56Z,"This about giving scores on A/V is just bullshit. Some people give A/10 V/10 on any shitty cam rip.

The quality of this rip tho is great. Won't get better than this until the bluray is out. But you should download the sample and decide for yourself."

A - 9   V - 9. "
