  As the new night nurse at a soon to be abandoned children's     
  hospital readies the last group of orphans to leave, it becomes 
  increasingly clear that these are not normal children.          
  Something living in the hospital, something the children call   
  the "mechanical girl," has a terrifying hold over them and will 
  stop at nothing to keep them in the hospital with her forever.
