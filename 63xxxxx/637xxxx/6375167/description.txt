Yellowcards One for the Kids is a power punk album full of hooks and catchy choruses as strong as any of the syrupy sweet punk bands around southern California, except that Yellowcard is from Florida. Nevertheless, Yellowcards take on punk is a bit different but isnt that what punk is all about anyway, as one of the major instruments incorporated on the album is the electric violin. It truly adds a whole new dynamic to the album, as it seems more like the Dave Matthews Band at some points rather than Lagwagon or New Found Glory. The guitar playing is furious and full of stops and starts, very reminiscent of early Slick Shoes material. And if all this werent enough, there are a couple of acoustic tracks to boot. This all makes for a pleasant shot of diversity for the punk-pop style (if it can even be called that, considering the range of sound on the album) that seems to become more and more diluted of its power as the years go on.
