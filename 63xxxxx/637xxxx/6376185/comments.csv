Really really bad aspect ratio.
Are you the same FASM who uploaded casino royal,ninja assasin in 1080. It is a free advise for you Please don,t try 720p you are not good in this format. Try uploading 1080p but remove noise i dont know what is the quality it is giving on Xbox or Tv But on monitors equal or large than 23"" there is so so much noise . i played on different players your this movie and saving private Ry . not good enough.and if a movie having 8Gb size still having noise then it is not good for your repotation.Anyway thanks."

Only the best rippers can preserve it coz its hard as hell to do it. It gives you additional details and film effect ie. crispness. If you dont like it Media player Classic have noise filters."
