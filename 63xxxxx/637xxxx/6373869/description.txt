Description

 

Decompose is an application allowing an easy and flawless extraction of elements from pictures in order to use them to make composite images. It is the perfect tool for making images for web pages, newspapers and magazines or simply for your own creations. Extracted objects are saved as a TIFF file with transparency. Decompose also corrects colors to remove all traces of the previous background, thus generating perfect mattes.
