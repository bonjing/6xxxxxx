,captainzain,2011-05-13T12:21Z,"Hello Dada, Why are you deleting my comments?? I asked for your help as the IDM downloaded from your torrent suddenly stopped working and asking for serial number. it is saying that the serial number is fake. What should i do?? It was working fine for 3 days only."
,.hailey,2011-05-13T14:55Z,@captainzain you should run again the keygen and close the idm before running it
[T],dada_sh,2011-05-13T17:44Z,"@ /captainzain/ Kindly note i can never delete your comments & why should i do so... if you ask for help & i have the solution Iâ€™ll deliver instantly.

Do not panic ;-) Uninstall IDM clean your registry & re-install using idman606b3.exe from my torrent & register using your own details + the serial provided 

I advise using you uninstalling the software using Revo uninstaller you can find it here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6329430/Revo_Uninstaller_Pro_v2.5.3_(clean__amp__safe_crack)

If anything let me know Iâ€™ll be happy to help."

,wengki,2011-05-31T02:40Z,"I'm sorry if you find this question a bit naive (coz it's my first time dloading this stuff) but why is the registration button disabled? the instruction says we can register it in any name, email but why can't I do it? I'm really worried there might be something wrong again.My friend installed idman in my laptop b4, but I accidentally clicked the update button and so his patch kind of didn't work anymore,so I had to uninstall it and look for this torrent.I would really appreciate your reply.:)"
[T],dada_sh,2011-05-31T11:46Z,"Dear /Wengki/ the registration button is disabled because your software is registered for you to be sure: Go to Help ~ About IDM there you'll see ""This product is licensed to"" and the name under & also the version as 6.06Beta Build 3 (May/05/2011) Full 
nothing to worry about enjoy the software full version & for any future upgrade visit my account http://thepiratebay.org/user/dada_sh/ Download & install ;-) Cheers Buddy!"
