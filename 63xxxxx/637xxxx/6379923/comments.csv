,RedVenim,2011-11-23T16:09Z,"@ js497891, sorry man I don't understand the question... ...do you need like a arabic/ farsi translation reader tool? Not that you'll need it for this collection as most of the works have been translated to english.

This particular torrent didn't really take, so there's an updated torrent, I was having problems uploading it to TPB, but you'll find it on the web at other torrent sites... ...do a search for: ""Islamic Books & Stuff (Collection 21-11-11)"" (Not available via Piratebay) "
