All episodes are XviD, quality varies, but I've tried to find a DVDrip of every episode. The best quality XviD I could find is in the torrent file.

Contains DVDrips, HDTV-rips and PDTV-rips and is one of the most complete collections of The Penguins of Madagascar S1 episodes with the right names.
