Four decades later, Carole King's Tapestry still can hold it's own and will forever be a landmark album. The proof is sure in that Carole King is touring again, with James Taylor, and singing the time-enduring songs she penned long ago. Tapestry features the two hit songs It's Too Late and I Feel The Earth Move, and King's own version of You've Got A Friend: the greatness of this album lies in the incredible quality of the songs. A classic masterpiece.
