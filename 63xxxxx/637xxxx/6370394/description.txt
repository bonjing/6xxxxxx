3. Install

Serial for program and model packs are the same. The serial is located in the Model Pack folder.

Notes:
Some packs are wacky. Ive noticed if you install some and use them in a game you will get an error. I dont know why.  Best to install one at  time and try it out to see if it works then move on to next pack.
