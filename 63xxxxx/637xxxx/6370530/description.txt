When the orgy was over, the slaughter began. The next morning, thirteen of the revelers were found naked and butchered. Dismembered. Mutilated. But the fourteenth body was never found.

The screams have faded and now the blood has dried, but the house remains...watching. Now five very special people have dared to enter the infamous house of horrors.Who - or what- awaits them? And who will live to tell Hildreth House's ghastly secrets?"

I was worried my A.D.H.D would go off the friggin' rocker trying to follow along with all the charactersand it looked like a bunch of weary and trodden haunted house hocus pocus, the likes of which has been beaten to death by other one trick pony writers.I have been aware and a fan of Edward Lee's cannon of work for quite some time, I just couldn't quite take the initial dive into this one.

Some people have a sixth sense when it comes to books. They say things like, "I heard it call my name from the shelf."
