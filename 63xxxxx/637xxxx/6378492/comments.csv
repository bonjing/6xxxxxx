,ninline,2011-05-23T02:43Z,keygens mostly turn up as threats to virus checking software.  It's the nature of the beast.  If it makes you nervous you can always just buy the software from the publisher and avoid any complications.  Life as a pirate isn't safe.  If you can't run with the big dogs....stay on the porch.
