A full-force, hardcore psycho thriller. Unlike anything you've seen from Ed Lee before.

Psychopath
She shackles them to the bed.
She glues their eyes closed.
She punctures their eardrums.
She sews their lips shut.

Torturess
They can't move. They can't see or hear.
They can't scream.
All they can do is feel.
And with her tools -- her scalpels and needles,
her bonesaws and her knives --
She gives them a lot to feel...
