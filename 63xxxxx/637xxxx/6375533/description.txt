Product Description[/b]
This book by Alex Varga is not meant to question God or Jesus but to 
question the writers of the Bible and expose their fallibility and the 
resulting contradictions. The inevitable consequence of disagreement 
within the Church was that it split into countless denominations. The 
best way to point out the fallibility of the Bible is to use the Bible against 
the Bible.

[b]About the Author[/b]
Growing up in Europe Alex Varga was exposed to many different 
religious beliefs by his parents and relatives. He came to the United 
States as a political refugee following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 
where as a soldier he fought against communist forces. After settling 
down in California he discovered liberal as well as alarmingly 
fundamental Christian religious beliefs that reminded him of 
communist indoctrination that led to the inevitable loss of personal 
freedom. He is a retired educator and lives with his family in the Napa 
Valley.
