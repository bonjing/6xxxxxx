- Native American Activist Winona LaDuke on Use of "Geronimo" as Code for Osama bin Laden: "It is the Continuation of the Wars Against Indigenous People"

The Obama administration has sparked outrage in the Native American community following the revelation it used the name of the legendary Apache leader Geronimo as a secret code word during the raid that killed of Osama bin Laden. Geronimo was an Apache leader who fought to preserve tribal lands against U.S. and Mexican forces in the 19th century. We get reaction from Native American activist and writer, Winona LaDuke. "The reality is that the military is full of native nomenclature," says LaDuke. "You've got Black Hawk helicopters, Apache Longbow helicopters, you've got Tomahawk missiles. The term used when you leave a military base in a foreign country is 'off the reservation into Indian Country.'" So what is that messaging that's being passed on? Basically, it is the continuation of the wars against indigenous people."


- Native American Activist, Author Winona LaDuke on "The Militarization of Indian Country" and Obama Admin's "Lip Service" to Indigenous Rights

Native American activist and writer Winona LaDuke joins us to discuss her new book, "The Militarization of Indian Country." LaDuke covers the legacy of the seizure of Native American lands by the U.S. government, which became sites for for industrial and military use, including army bases, nuclear testing sites, coal and uranium mining, and the military-industrial complex is encroaching on Native communities. LaDuke lives and works on the White Earth Nation in northern Minnesota and is Executive Director of the group, Honor The Earth. "Indian country is to not be assaulted by the U.S. military," says LaDuke.


- Oil Wealth, U.S. Backing Enables Saudi Arabia to Crush Dissent in Bahrain and at Home

Saudi Arabia-the oil rich kingdom that is the birthplace and former home of Osama bin Laden-has staved off the widespread popular protests that have swept across the region since January. The country's oil-rich Eastern Province, bordering Bahrain, has witnessed protests from the minority Shia Muslim population. In March, Saudi Arabia sent troops to Bahrain to support its royal family after a month of protests. We speak with Toby Jones, author of "Desert Kingdom: How Oil and Water Forged Modern Saudi Arabia," on the role of Saudi Arabia in suppressing the Bahrain uprising, as well as its own. "We should not assume there is a lack of interest on the part of Saudi citizens in achieving some sort of democratic or political reform. There is deep frustration in Saudi society," says Jones.


- Tech Giants Sony, Apple, Google Face Outrage Over Privacy Breaches in Devices

Technology giants Sony, Apple and Google have all faced major scandals in recent weeks that raise a host of questions about privacy in the digital age. Apple's popular iPhone was designed to secretly track a user's location without the user's knowledge, and so was Google's Android system for smartphones. Sony's PlayStation Network has exposed the personal records of more than 100 million of its customers. We speak to Mark Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, who notes that in addition to privacy breaches, these private companies are essentially doing a better job with popular surveillance than the government, creating a detailed personal record that then can be released by a subpoena.
