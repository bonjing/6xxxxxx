 Howards End in Blu ray, Rear Window in HDTV(love ur hitchcock movie rips) 

> twentyforty at 2011-05-08 11:20 CET: 
 @jamydoug: I can do both, but Rear Window should be available on TPB (some moron advertised his torrents on my threads month back) and Howards End can be 480p only, it is too long movie for 720p, probably."

[V],twentyforty,2011-05-09T22:25Z,"@puplone: Just two days ago I gently instructed you to get familiar with my ways (because it seems as we started of wrong foot) by reading a long header accompanying my TV packs torrents, regarding your confusion ""why all encodes doesn't use same parameters"". There is stated:
""Do NOT request movies which have IMDB score lower than 4.4.""
for years, and for very good reason - such movies are bad - and I don't feel a need to waste my time on those.

New Moon Rising (1995) has - 1.6 iMDB score.

BTW, potato or potatoe,

may solve your need to get other's vocabulary straight. Just an advice."
,believenu,2011-05-10T03:11Z,"Ok now, you are killing my free space and I cannot get the time to put them on dvd.. I use convertxtodvd4 as I find it works on all older and newer but it is slow slow to do.. any others you can recommend to out these gems on disc for older and newer players, kemo sabe?
 I am going to have to chat with you regarding other ""classics"" from the golden age Arsinic and Old Lace, bus stop ...been so busy juggling have not had time,  I will do wed night.. until later.j
Thank you as always, Seeding is Sharing."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-10T08:14Z,"@believenu: Don't convert them, burn them on empty DVD as they are for archiving purposes only (to keep your hard-disk at max. 80% full). 

If you need conversion because you need playback on older DVD player which doesn't have MP4 capability - be aware that DVD format is at least 4 times more space consuming (2 hours movie in decent quality barely fit 1 empty DVDR) and quality suffers too much, as in any conversion.

My MP4 are incredibly small already, and I humbly suggest to burn them unchanged, and standalone MP4 players cost nowadays 30$ - it may sound as too much but it is lot cheaper than other options. Find player which have USB input, buy cheap 8$ USB stick (2MB) than transfer files from computer on stick, plug it in player - and watch it from stick directly. My sis have learned doing that in few minutes."
,atak_sanjpera,2011-05-10T09:00Z,"To TwentyForty:
I am downloading your staffs for some times and now I have a problem with one of your rip which I think you can help.

You must be knowing that mp4 is a good container and I generally remux the downloaded staffs embedding all the subtitles, cover art and supporting files in a single file (using mp4box commandline tool) for better file management.

But when I was trying to do the same to your Scary Movie 3, it losing data at the end (rest three parts are just perfect). Even I've tried alternate tools (like mkvmerge). but the problem remains for that particular file. Will you please guide me on this?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-10T09:25Z,"@puplone: No, sorry, I realized later that my ""quadrology"" was too much. Sorry for that.

Regarding your request however - it was 'de facto' against the rules other follow for years, and you know how stupid it be to take your request - where others got No.

I downloaded (because I am not a bad person) TNT XviD version from Rapidshare, and you are right - it is unwatchable, so ugly that I would be ashamed to have anything with distributing some capture done by insane person - that guy should be hanged by neck and shot twice afterward, just to make sure that he never touches computer again.
Better copy could be DVDrip, but any sources are dead, as you've said.

If you're eager to get ""the howling 7 joe briggs"" (TNT shit) - do plain Google for full title. I've found it in ten minutes.

In future, please, spend some five minutes for reading my own rules, to avoid ""one step forward, two back"" situations."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-10T09:49Z,"@atak_sanjpera: When you de-mux elementary streams with mp4box -raw, these h264 and aac tracks could be mkvmerged (mmg, fps determined 24000/1001. Subs could be added without any problems.

nicmp4box -raw 1 Scream.3.2000.BluRay.480p.H264.mp4
extract aac

nicmp4box -raw 2 Scream.3.2000.BluRay.480p.H264.mp4
extract h264

and put in mkv container (or mp4 but converting subs with srt2ttxt) as I did right now (without subs). Both in mkv and back to new mp4.

If you are ""atak_snajpera"" from doom9 - I even cannot comprehend why you have been asking."
,atak_sanjpera,2011-05-10T10:11Z,"Ha ha, I'm not the RipBot author. I'm just a stupid person using a legend's name (just like people keep their name of god's name).

Well, Mr. I've done the same way what you've instructed. Even used GUI (YAMB). But when playing in VLC, the last 5 mins just jump out. I can't even drag the slide bar to that area : video exits.

Anyway, thanx for the response ..."

@atak_sanjpera: Follow instructions I just gave. I DID it before I replied. "
,atak_sanjpera,2011-05-10T11:08Z,"Eh!!! That was all wrong with that vi.srt. Just see its timetags!!! upto 01:20:56,924 and the main stream is of 1:12:17 only (end credits half removed already). If I include that srt, a 1:20:57 mkv is being produced having that 8min 40sec jump thing in its tail.
I don't know how to fix that srt (I'm not that learned) but I have done a cool headed skip file as I even don't know that language. Everything is fine now. Thank you Mr. TwentyForty."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-10T11:16Z,"@atak_sanjpera: Easy: Google for SubtitleWorkshop, download it, open .srt with it, delete lines, hit Save."
,atak_sanjpera,2011-05-10T12:08Z,"Ya I have Subtitle workshop (not familiar with it). But if its all about deleting the lines I can do it opening with notepad also. Isn't it required shrinking the time gaps of the textlines?

I can't even trace if the srt is synced with the video or not - I don't know that language. How this srt is lengthy wrt that two? How there are dialogues during end credit? Something is mismatching and its complicated."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-10T13:19Z,"Look, you have said it yourself, you don't need Vietnamese subs. 
If you want to play with muxing-in subtitles (I have no clue why you need that), learn what must be done to achieve desired outcome.
Hint: I always delete end credits if they doesn't have anything important, I do not need info who fixed hair for Mrs. Kelly or who hold the mike boom.

Moreover, I do test subtitles by playing them before upload - and - I have not experienced problems using .srt subs as they are.

You use inferior playback system and that is a background for problems you have. Use Recommended one."
,atak_sanjpera,2011-05-10T14:35Z,"Ho ho ho ho...
Well described Master for the point of removing end credits. You have a good sense of humour.
Well, I have no problem with your staffs, they are excellent and also I don't continue with the problematic things and skipped that srt then and there which I don't need at all, as you suggested lastly.

Waiting for your next ""unique piece of art"" eagerly ..."
,atak_sanjpera,2011-05-10T14:40Z,"Regarding playback system: I have my Core2Duo - Win7Ultimate - 4GB RAM (3GB usable) - 320HDD - NVidia GeForce Cuda LAPTOP. Thats all I have. Thats my entertainment media as well as work portal. They say my laptop is my wife and I'm happy with that.
I'm not a rich man, Master ..."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-10T15:44Z,"@atak_sanjpera: Your computer hardware is not what I meant. To get most of your nice hardware (waaay above like 98% here) install Recommended playback system (mp4, .mkv) - CoreAVC (CUDA is supported, VLC is pointless). DivX 1.0 and VobSub and ACfilter. Everything is explained in every long header of my daily TV packs.

For some reason, srt should match duration of video tracks in your case - so, easiest way is to obtain duration with MediaInfo, then open .srt in SubtitleWorkshop and delete all lines which timing surpasses length of video, Just do Save, do not change other things. Also, some subs refuse to play properly - use SubtitleWokshop>Informatio>FixErrors and different errors would be fixed. Save changed subtitle and everything would be fine."
