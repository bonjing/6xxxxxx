,pupp3too,2011-05-18T20:20Z,"Thank you but  when I tried to run it after installing, it tells me that i've got no rights to write on the registry of it.... and the program is not starting? 

Can someone help me....?"
,iAnonymous,2011-05-29T05:47Z,"@pupp3too the same thing happened to me. 
Try: 
1. going back into the folder you saved it under then 
2. go to the downloaded folder (should be named PhotoshopPortable) 
3. go to App folder
4. go to PhotoshopCS5 folder
5. Scroll down until you see Photoshop with it's icon. Double click that and it should work.

It worked for me, hopefully I helped out. :)"
