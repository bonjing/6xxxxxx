CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D

Here is my version, yes a bit late, but took me over 3 days to create.
Since the russian source avi was available i could do my own version from that avi.
I cut the movie in around 30 parts, wrong aspect scenes, scenes at daylight,scenes at darkness, scenes with borders, and fixed every part differently.
Scenes at daylight are nearly untouched just sharpened, dark scenes are brightened up as needed, and all scenes with wrong aspect are fixed in aspect without cropping anything away. i added a border above and below and resized and centered the video so that it looks right in fullscreen.
Yes you have a different aspect after 47min runtime like in the movie Tron, but it doesnt bother at all, as long as the aspect is right and you dont see eggheads in the video.
The most complex thing was to have a single resolution 720x304 but having 5 different videos with different resolutions and aspects inside.

work that was done in detail:

The Russian avi was already a wild mixture of different cams. 
At the beginning the first 1,3 mins have wrong aspect and were stretched to max.
[color=red]i fixed the aspect and centered that part, with black bars left and right, but its not overstretched anymore[/color]

After that the next 46 mins were rather fine just dark a lot.

After that follows a 40 sec different cam, also stretched to max that you cant even see from which movie this scene is.
[color=red]fixed the aspect centered and resized again with borders around to let you actually see that scene[/color]

Next is the good cam again but has a black bar at the bottom and the aspect is way off till the end of the movie, which looks really weird.
[color=red]fixed aspect with borders above and below,sharpening and correcting brightness when needed for dark parts[/color]

Nearly at the end after shaking a lot the border is gone and the aspect is right again for couple mins.
[color=red]just sharpening[/color]

And finally the endscene is from the not as good cam and was interlaced along with wrong aspect again.
[color=red]fixed aspect,removed interlace,denoised[/color]

I also attached 4 samples.
2 from the first half of the movie at daylight and darkness
2 from the second half of the movie at daylight and darkness

[color=blue]Was it worth that much work? prolly not,but who is gonna do it else?
I hope its still appreciated by someone
