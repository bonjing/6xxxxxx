,MusicNutt,2011-05-07T12:45Z,"Hahaha. It's funny how people get offended about stuff they themselves stole. :) As if people who made the torrent somehow deserve more credit than the folks who actually made the content. (tv, movie, music, what-have-you)

Thanx for the no-rar."
,Spooje,2011-05-20T13:14Z,"I'm not offended about that part, it's just fucking dumb.  All you accomplish is you split off traffic from the real release, slowing down everyone's download because less peers on that download etc.

Also if you know what the fuck you're doing the individual rars can be crc'd check so if there is an error in the download you can redl the proper piece w/o having to go through the whole thing again.

Law of unintended consequences.  I know you think you're doing people a favor by putting out something that is more convenient but the reality is that the trade offs aren't worth it (see aforementioned reasons).  Let people take the 20 seconds to unrar their own stuff and stop fucking with a system that exists for very good reasons."
