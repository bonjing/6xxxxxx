EDDY CLEARWATER  TWO x NINE
Label: New Rose Records
Format: Flac


Recorded originally for Clearwater's own Cleartone label and later leased to Ron Bartolucci's Baron imprint, these late-'70s sides were potent indicators of his maturing blues style. These weren't homemade sessions; all-star sidemen include drummer Casey Jones, guitarist Jimmy Johnson, and saxist Abb Locke. The title cut is a blistering Chuck Berry-styled rocker, "Came Up the Hard Way" displays a firm grasp of the West Side sound, and "A Little Bit of Blues, A Little Bit of Rock & Roll" utilizes a funky groove to foot-stomping advantage.
