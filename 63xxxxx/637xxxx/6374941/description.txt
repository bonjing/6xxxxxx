Matt Lucas presents his very own comedy show. Matt and his guests will be handing out the most prestigious awards of the year - 'The Lucases'.

Each week Matt welcomes three funny guests on to the show to nominate people, places, songs, films and every other kind of thing for the Lucases, handed out to the best, worst, funniest, ugliest and scariest - as well as every other possible superlative - before Matt decides on the winner of the coveted award. 

The nominations are provided by the guests - but the ultimate decision is down to the whim of the host. Who will walk off with their very own Lucas?
