|Plot/Storyline|
+--------------+

In the 1920's era Italian air pirates, bounty hunters and high fliers of all sorts rule the skies. The most cunning and skilled of these is Porco Rosso, a bush pilot who just happens to look like a humanoid pig. A former Ace, he now makes a living flying contract jobs, such as rescuing those kidnapped by air pirates. A man named Donald Curtis, Porco's rival in the air and in catching the affections of women, provides a constant challenge to the hero, culminating in a hilarious, action packed finale.
