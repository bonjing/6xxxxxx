[V],Anacondaz,2011-05-08T04:21Z,plss read the readme files inside the crack and fix folders mates
,Neuromods,2011-05-08T04:44Z,"Very sorry, but the Readme file was all messed up and un-readable. It could be because I'm on a Japanese PC but can you copy the readme's and post them here please on the comments? Would help me much, thanx!"
,Neuromods,2011-05-08T04:53Z,"The readme file was corrupt, please post both reame files here in the comments section."
,Itbankrock,2011-05-08T19:14Z,ReadMe file is in Indian language O_O

,Neuromods,2011-05-10T10:54Z,"OK, why even post this if you are NOT gonna help others?

As I and others said, the ReadMe file is in Indian and corrupt. So tell us how to install the files to fix Vegas and make it work. I been waiting 2 days now for a reply."

[V],Anacondaz,2011-05-10T17:01Z,"nope

,Neuromods,2011-05-11T00:55Z,"Alright, well I'll research and see what I can find."

,andri226,2011-06-10T03:57Z,"READ THIS-THE SOLUTION FOR INVALID AUTHENTICATION KEY !!!!

After puting my brain into the work, I realized that when I was attempting to patch Sony Vegas, the product name in the keygen window was ""Sound Forge 9.0 Series"" (the default one)..CHANGE THAT TO ""Vegas Pro 10.0 (32 and 64 bit) Series"" BEFORE YOU START PATCHING!!

That should get the job done, at least here.
Good job, and nice torrent."
,tulunadu,2011-06-16T21:11Z,"Thanks Anacondaz for your great work. Thanks ROBOTSHI for your kind explanation. Please forgive me for my dumb question but where on fix i paste the code generated by the crack? 
""Serial Number IR8xx00xxx, Activation code xyz134251xpt"" or I replace whatever written between ""   ""  with the codes generated?

 tried 10 times today with all option - it failed to patch"

,IWalkAlone247,2011-06-26T02:33Z,"Okay...I know you guys are pretty much TIRED of people asking this question....

Thanx to everyone who've been helping and everything, but there's one little piece of info that's just not exactly clear yet...

I know it says to enter in the keygen info into the parenthesis, but there are TWO THINGS in the parenthesis...

It says ""serial number, activation code""...in the keygen those are two totally different codes.....

So do I enter BOTH codes in the parenthesis, or JUST the ""Serial Number"" field from the keygen?

I'm a little confused.....thanx in advance..."

,dorf65,2011-07-14T21:14Z,"Noob here,

Thank you so much to 2therock for the instructions - they were very easy to follow.

However I'm obviously still doing something wrong. I made sure I re-installed and followed the instructions 3 times before posting, but it seems everything works fine up until I need to open Sony Vegas Pro - it's asking me to register online which I thought weird since I just cracked it.

Just to be sure, I opened the .reg file for editing again and copied and pasted the generated serial and authentication numbers which it liked until it asked me to submit them -which then gave me an error about not being to locate the authentication server....

I didn't want to go any further than that. Can anyone suggest anything? I must be blatantly missing something- I've read the comments over as well but I'm quite new to this stuff :]

Thanks for your help! "
