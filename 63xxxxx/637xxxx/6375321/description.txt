This is Fred West Murder Music.

This album features the Arizona artist Alan Richard aka Alan Tanz
an American poet with depth and a sinister mind.
Ol Der E also features an artist called Gem Indigo who plays guitar and sings in is own twisted demented way. I like to think of him as the Charles Manson of New Zealand

This is a brilliant futuristic take on sound and word play this is the defining album of what Fred West Murder Music is!
Welcome to the mind of a serial killer!
