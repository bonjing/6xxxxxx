Spider-man and Red Sonja #1-5 [complete]-P2P

The wise-cracking Wall-Crawler collides with the She-Devil with a Sword! Longtime Marvel readers know that these two legends have met before â€“ but that was just the warm-up! They may be from two different eras, but Spider-Man and Red Sonja have both faced the maniacal mage known as Kulan Gath. Now the sadistic sorcerer makes a play for power that will once again bring these two famous heroes together â€” but will it be as friends or foes? Writer Michael Avon Oeming (OMEGA FLIGHT, Red Sonja) and Mel Rubi (Red Sonja) plus series cover artist Michael Turner (CIVIL WAR) â€“ answer the eternal question: Whatâ€™s better in a fight, the proportional strength and speed of a spider, or cold, hard steel and a chain-mail bikini?
