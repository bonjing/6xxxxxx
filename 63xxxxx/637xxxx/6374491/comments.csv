only for linux"
,Largex,2011-05-15T20:01Z,"That would work I guess. Tried to make one myself for my Windows server but that didn't work out well, so I guess I can set up a Linuxbox in the mean time I'm looking for a working Windows version."
,no-name09,2011-05-31T15:43Z,"thanks. but when I add a server, it does not come, I know it works normal."
