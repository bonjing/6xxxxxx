=============================

The X-Men anime is written by famed English comic book writer/creator Warren Ellis, 
and borrows story elements from famed Scottish comic book writer Grant Morrisonâ€™s early 2000s 
story arch for New X-Men, as well as Joss Whedonâ€™s mid-2000s run on Astonishing X-Men.
-----------------------------

For those who donâ€™t like anime, youâ€™ll be pleased to hear that this X-Men anime series 
(unlike the Wolverine anime) seems to be staying fairly true to the source material. 
Cyclops, Professor X, Beast, Storm and Wolverine all pretty much look like 
recognizable versions of themselves -- albeit â€œanimetedâ€ -- which, if you think about it, 
isnâ€™t too far from what a lot of American superhero cartoons are doing today 
(see: Wolverine and the X-Men).

Synopsis

05 "Power - Unity"
---"Power - Kessoku" (Power - çµæŸ)  May 6, 2011

As Hisako starts training to use her powers, she finds herself at odds with Cyclops who still 
doesn't trust Emma and shows a dislike to Xavier recruiting her as part of the X-Men. 
As the other X-Men discuss the possibility of Mastermind having a hand in Jean's death, 
Cyclops pits Hisako in a real battle against him, pushing her to go beserk with her powers so she can take control of it. 
Noticing Hisako lacking self-confidence, Emma agrees to have Xavier read her mind, revealing her childhood and her affiliation with the Inner Circle and her reason for leaving, 
also proving she was not involved with the battle with Jean. As a result, 
Cyclops apologises to Emma whilst Hisako strives to learn from her mistakes. 
As the X-Men prepare to leave for Tohoku with the vaccines, Emma questions Xavier about a woman named Yui Sasaki which she saw when their minds were linked.
