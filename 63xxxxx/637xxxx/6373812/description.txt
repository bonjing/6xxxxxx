All subs show the right characters (saved under the right Unicode ISO).
In the future if you find subs not showing the right characters do the following:
If the subs are muxed in mkv download & use "MKVextractGUI" to extract(demux) the subtitles from mkv, and "mkvmerge GUI" to mux back the edited/repaired sub in the mkv.
Download "Notepad++" (free):   http://sourceforge.net/projects/notepad-plus/
The sub you demuxed from mkv: Open and save as...ANSI !(Important!)
Right click on the sub/Open with nppIExplorerShell.exe (Notepad++ exe)/
click Encoding(upper part menu)/Character sets and chose the language ISO.
Click again on Encoding/then click on Convert to UTF-8/save as...srt. 
You're done with the encoding, now you can mux it back in the mkv with mkvmergeGUI, select the language & mux.
