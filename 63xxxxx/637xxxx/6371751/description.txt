Description

Hey these guys have worked so hard to get this deserved break and the results are fantastic. This album will be huge and with original songs like Gambling Man, makes the future look extremely bright for the lads. Perfectly pitched between the Plan B/Amy Winehouse and Michael Buble fans! The harmonies are tight and real, Timmy's lead vocals are sublime.... All the best lads!
