Stockholm Metro photos and wallpapers
==========================================================================

The Stockholm Metro (Swedish: Stockholms tunnelbana) is the metro system in Stockholm County, Sweden. The system has 100 stations in use, of which 47 are underground and 53 above ground. There are seven lines numbered from 10 to 19, in three groups identified by a color: the Green, Red and Blue Lines. Each color line has two or three numbered lines on shared sections through the Stockholm City Centre.

The metro system is owned by the Stockholm County Council through Storstockholms Lokaltrafik. Operation was contracted to Veolia Transport until 1 November 2009, after which MTR Corporation took over.

There are 100 stations in use in the Stockholm Metro. One station, Kymlinge, was built but never taken into use. One station has been taken out of use and demolished. The Bagarmossen old surface station was demolished and replaced with a new underground station there instead, this prior to the metro extension to Skarpnack metro station.

The Stockholm Metro is well known for its decoration of the stations; it has been called the longest art gallery in the world.
