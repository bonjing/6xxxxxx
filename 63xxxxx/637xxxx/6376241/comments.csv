,witcher142,2011-07-23T20:56Z,"aaaa i figured it out ...

Not working if you have dx11 it seems."
,telep_man,2011-08-03T23:51Z,"Am I stupid or what? I extracted each ""sub-archive"" from each archive (don't see the point of that double-archiving, but ok), extracted the exe file, chose the destination folder an when I click Supermeatbo.exe i got this message: Runtime error! C:\Program Files, bla bla... This application has requested the Runtime to terminate in an unusual way. Please contact the bla bla...
I have Windows 7 64bit, tried compatibilty mode, still the same."
,telep_man,2011-08-04T00:27Z,"Alright, looks like I got it. Gotta run it in 640x480 resolution (right-click on the exe file, then properties, then compatibility, there it is). That's for Windows 7 users."
