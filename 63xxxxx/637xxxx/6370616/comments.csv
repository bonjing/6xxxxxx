,Jorfnar,2011-05-10T01:53Z,This torrent OK to DL? Its 3x larger than the last Zone Archive I found.
,iamfanboytoo,2011-05-15T22:19Z,"It's .8 gigs because it includes everything 4chan CLAIMS belongs to Zone, even things clearly belonging to someone else - ALL the hentaikey flashes, the Fina Fellatio X-2 flash (and the edits). Also the stuff 'edited' (stolen) from Zone's work, like the Famous Toon Facials. 

For all of that, it IS an OK zip file, with no viruses (that Avira can find) and quite a few flashes I didn't already have, but it'd be more appropriate to call it ""Zone Hentaikey and Famous Toon Flashes as of May 5th""."
,pupshadow117,2011-05-28T09:52Z,"How exactly do you open this and view it, i normally use irfanviewer for watching .swf files. and i also used winrar to open the archive. any help"
,MasterXelcas,2011-06-20T19:17Z,"I used 7z for all my zip and rar files, it works great. Hey theOPisaGOD this upload is fantastic, all the things i could imagine from zone plus way more, the only problem is you have only a couple broken files and several repeats.. but otherwise great job, i will seed as long as i can. Thanks. (love legend of kristal :)) "
,naruto71,2011-11-15T06:43Z,can you do an update of this ?
,zellpiccolo,2012-01-22T21:19Z,"I cant seem to get this to unpack right. every way i try it i keep getting invalid paths. only thing that seems to work is the bonus file. Feeling retarded, can i get some help here?"
