The Antlers are an indie rock band currently based in Brooklyn, New York, fronted by Peter Silberman.
Initially, The Antlers was a solo project created by vocalist and guitarist Peter Silberman immediately after he had moved to Brooklyn, New York. Silberman wrote the first two albums, Uprooted and In the Attic of the Universe by himself and under his own name. Afterwards, he recruited Michael Lerner and Darby Cicci, becoming a collaborative group. The band recorded two EPs: Cold War and New York Hospitals. Silberman's collection of songs would later become a full-length album titled Hospice. The story behind Hospice has been debated, but Silberman has explained the record as being the story of an emotionally abusive relationship, told through the analogy of a Hospice worker and terminally-ill patient. The album was independently released by the band in March 2009, selling out of all of the quantities in stock. The band later commented that they "bit off more than they could chew." The band later signed with New York-based label Frenchkiss Records, and the label released a remastered version of Hospice on August 18, 2009. The album received critical praise for both its narrative and musicianship, and has since been listed on several "Album of the Year" lists.

The band recently appeared at the Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona, and are opening for The National. Additionally, the band played the 2010 Osheaga Festival in Montreal, as well as the 2010 Lollapalooza Music Festival in Chicago. The song "Kettering" from Hospice appeared in a third season episode of Chuck, entitled "Chuck Versus the Other Guy.", as well as the series premiere of Lone Star (TV series)

Silberman has said the bands' name is taken from a The Microphones song called "Antlers".
