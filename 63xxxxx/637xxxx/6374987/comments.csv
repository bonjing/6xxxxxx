,BoonesFerry,2011-05-08T04:22Z,UGH! I've already downloaded two fakes of this episode. I thnk I'll wait a couple hours in the hopes that someone will come back and comment after they have downloaded this one. What up with the trusted regular uploaders on this one???

[V],catflap,2011-05-08T04:50Z,"it's real. excellent quality, btw."
[V],catflap,2011-05-08T04:53Z,"you know in the future if you have any doubt, google the file name and see if there are any comments attached on other sites. superpunx posted this several hours earlier on demonoid. that's why there are so many seeders."
,PhilLesh12,2011-05-08T06:49Z,"yeah, it's real.  Downloaded it, and I'm watching it now."
,eigosensei,2011-05-08T10:33Z,Good quality
,thnx-ppl,2011-05-08T11:42Z,"Superpunx thanks man! you are my hero, and so cool you added overtime. Hope you have a great week!"
[V],phatwarez,2011-05-08T12:43Z,"Thanks. I hope people keep adding overtime, because it often takes HBO 2-3 days to put it up after the initial showing."
,zygarch,2011-05-08T18:25Z,Thanks superpunx! I was literally apoplectic at the thought of not getting my Maher today... It would've been ugly. ; )
