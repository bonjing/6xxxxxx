Have fun!"
,deep92,2011-06-14T13:03Z,"--- From the SWKOTOR 1 torrent ---

I've read through the entire thing and looked some things up.
For Windows XP you should do everything in this list, except for step 7 (Do *NOT* replace the Mss32.DLL!)
That DLL file is the actual Win Vista/7 fix. The rest is just patching and cracking properly.
Again, I did not test it myself. You may want to try out what happens in Service Pack 3, without Service Pack 2 comp. mode, but I don't think that should actually matter.

Sorry for the inconvenience."
,Igorrrrrrrrrr,2011-06-19T17:45Z,Thanks deep92 for all the effort! It's working fine!
,NixoTT,2011-06-23T23:16Z,"Hey I have som problems with this.

I use windows 7 home and I have followed this guide step by step. I still doesnt work. I can create my character and watch the first cinematics, but when they end my game crashes. If I skip the cinamatics the game crashes too. 
Any help would be greatly appreciated."
,deep92,2011-06-24T13:47Z,Did you try what was suggested a few comments above?
,forcecrush,2011-07-01T10:53Z,"Thank you for this torrent, I spent a lot of time trying to get this game working with Windows 7, but your version was the only one that worked. This is totally worth downloading, thank you again :)."
,shakesbeard,2011-07-02T06:09Z,damn thing crashes after character creation
,Kitkun,2011-07-02T19:20Z,"Um... a question.  While I have yet to try this Torrent, I am wondering if missing audio is common in for the PC version?  The other Torrent has an issue I think, as it sometimes skips through dialogue, and if it is a cutscene, it might cut out the audio of that cutscene.  When talking to a party member, no text or dialogue appears for them, but it skips to where I would input my answer, and then skips there dialogue again and have me input again.

Is that just me (or the Torrent), or is it a common occurrence with the game?  Thank you for you help."
,shakesbeard,2011-07-02T21:36Z,Its a great torrent if the only part of the game you like is creating a character and then having it automatically exit for you.  !!THUMBS UP For this shitty torrent!!  fuck you
,shakesbeard,2011-07-02T21:37Z,or maybe im the shitty one for not knowing how to do it.  who knows
,deep92,2011-07-03T15:36Z,"Thumbs up for the shitty game that doesn't work with win vista/7 properly.
I just wrote the guide the way it worked for me every time. I do know that there are different issues that can arise at different PCs.
I never had an audio issue, nor heard of one. You could check out the forum (linked in the readme or text above)

@Shakesbeard: I'm sorry to hear that it doesn't work for you, but bitching at someone that took the time to write you a step-by-step guide and even gave links that could help you with issues isn't very nice of you.
I'm not a helpdesk, just here to share the game with those who want to play it.

Again, Steam has a working version for sure.
Check it out at: "
,Deathsmind,2011-07-04T04:31Z,"@shakesbeard: your an idiot. Just go through all the steps and it will work. You actually have to know something about computers to actually be able to get stuff for free.  You dont know anything you pay for your stuff

@deep92: thanks bro. Just downloaded and did every step you said to do and works perfectly. First time actually using pirate bay, was recommened this site by a friend and i love it so far thanks for the great game. Downloaded number 1 as well. Replaying them before SWTOR comes out."
,deep92,2011-07-04T13:26Z,"Your welcome brah. Let's all hope SWTOR will be good, but I bet it'll be fine, given it's BioWare and all :)"
,MemphisAhn,2011-07-06T02:26Z,"Hey guys, thanks for taking the time to upload this, but like the others have said, I'm crashing after the first cinematic. Any suggestions? Has anyone figured the route of the problem yet? 

I'll check back. Thanks all "
,MemphisAhn,2011-07-06T03:27Z,^^Also I'm running win7 64 
,deep92,2011-07-07T10:45Z,"You can try these things:
- Reinstall it and make sure you follow every single step very securely.
- Try a handful of compatibility modes
- Make sure you got all your win updates installed (I don't know if it matters, but heck, who knows right?)
- Video Card Drivers, make sure those are up to date.

If nothing works, you could disable the videos completely in ""swkotor2.ini"". Search for ""Disable Movies"" and ""Disable Intro Movies"".
Maybe disabling intro movies is enough, who knows.

If all fails, check this out. It seems to hold solutions for a handful of issues: http://www.tweakguides.com/KOTOR2_1.html"
,BrettL,2011-07-11T05:14Z,"every time, i get the torrent and mount the image just fine, but every singal time i try to install, it says ""please insert the next disc with datacab3"" and its no where to be found! helppp"
,BrettL,2011-07-11T15:48Z,"sorry, figured that part out. now after ive downloaded it, it says wrong disc."
,deep92,2011-07-12T00:37Z,"I don't know what virtual drives you are using, but the game is a bit hard with some of them and keeps bitching about piracy software. E.g. Daemon tools. You might want to fiddle with some security settings to get it to run.
It could also be that your download is corrupt, meaning you would have to redownload the game."
,wakiceyer,2011-07-12T23:24Z,Hey I got a question so far everything is great but after every combat I get stuck and the only way I can move is to reload the saved data in game. Anyway to fix it or is it a game control XD
,deep92,2011-07-12T23:57Z,"Try hitting the spacebar. The game automatically pauses at some points.
You can also try to fiddle with the settings a bit and see if you can find anything that may be causing the issue."
,wakiceyer,2011-07-13T06:02Z,"have you ever heard of this problem? and I tried pressing space and stop combat and everything, ill mess around with the compatibility settings and stuff thanks so much :D "
,mattron89622,2011-08-01T21:40Z,"I searched far and wide and this was the only one that finally worked. I followed the instructions to the letter and then updated my video drivers and that was it. I was previously using virtual PC to run the game in XP but then I found this torrent. Excellent torrent and superb instructions deep92, much admiration and respect.
System: Win7 64bit onboard radeon HD 3300 series"
,watchmexplode,2011-08-06T00:11Z,"Whenever I try to run the game, it always stops responding. Can anyone help me with this? I'm running on Windows 7"
,mwvolkma,2011-08-22T07:46Z,"windows xp

will this work???"
,Doomshadow-HaX,2011-09-04T15:47Z,what disc do i mount on daemon tools lite to play TSL? 
,Doomshadow-HaX,2011-09-04T15:51Z,ban that shit called shakesbeard
,acefighter2112,2011-09-20T21:06Z,when I try to install the game it still out fine but never asks for disc 2 it just goes straight to 100% and asks for disc 1. Am I doing something wrong? I use Vista.
,RC_Ebooks,2011-10-12T12:47Z,"Issues with loading this, MagicDisk complains it cannot find files. Fix was to put all data cabs in a directory on harddrive and that smoothed out the process considerably."
,RC_Ebooks,2011-10-12T20:08Z,"Put forward my best efforts and cannot get past the character build, I can tell it's a hardware compatibility issue. So does anyone know what TWEAKS need to be done to get this airborne on a little Asus 1005HAB netbook? The onboard gfx is the Intel 945 chipset. All EXTRAS folder options have been applied.

Also, is this strictly a multiplayer online game or more like Academy & Outcast? I am not interested in online/multiplayer stuff, too much a waste of ones time. Let me know, thanks!"
,RC_Ebooks,2011-10-12T20:09Z,Does anyone also know of a cutscene player? I enjoy those!
,deep92,2011-10-17T18:54Z,"@RC_Ebooks: I'm unknown with any errors. I've had the luck that the game worked on all my computers, at any given OS atm.

Maybe this can give you the answer: http://www.tweakguides.com/KOTOR2_1.html
I didn't read it, but someone told me it had a lot of anwers to issues. Let me know when and how you got it fixed."
,deep92,2011-10-17T19:00Z,"You can play the videos with BINK Player (videos are .bik = bink file)
http://www.radgametools.com/bnkdown.htm seems to work. I didn't try it, didn't scan it, don't know it. Just googled for you. Seems legit though :)"
,Wythyr,2011-10-19T07:02Z,"I read in the post that all the patches are included but when I installed the patch, it updated the game to 1.0, or so it said.

Is the restored content mod also included in this?"
,Wythyr,2011-10-19T07:27Z,"Also, when I start up the game using the swkotor2.exe, I receive a message saying that the game has stopped working and then it just shuts down. I followed all of your instructions, so I don't know what the problem is. Have any ideas how I could resolve this?"
,TheLordOfChaos201,2011-11-09T10:14Z,"Wat the hell people. i'm seeding 38kb and its only downloading 0.5 kb. u guys are so evil
!!!!!!!"
,picturewatcher1,2011-12-07T03:31Z,"Hey guys. I was only wondering what version this game is. There are 1.0a, 10.b and 1.0c patches out there all over the place. I've read their patch notes, and they all fix a truckload of game bugs. If this version is 1.0, I should probably expect all those said bugs to still be here. Deep92, your thoughts? 

Thanks for your time folks."
,picturewatcher1,2011-12-07T03:35Z,"EDIT: I've also found a 1.03 and a 1.03b patch on the net, again, fixing a host of game errors.

I was only asking because I'd hate to start the game, build a character, then get stuck somewhere and have to stop, patch and start the game from scratch. After all, the time is short and SW:TOR is almost out! lol"
,deep92,2011-12-07T18:38Z,"It's 1.0b, I'm afraid.
I didn't know there were additional patches.

I'll look into it some time, but as you said, sw:tor is releasing so I'm not going to do it any time soon.

If you choose to patch it, you might need a new crack. Apart of that, the .DLL should be working fine.

If you actually have the original disk, you should be fine as well."
,kontsnor,2011-12-14T20:34Z,"thx deep92 for taking the effort to write a good tutorial and sharing this torrent
I actualy know for a fact that this game would have worked perfectly if I didn't have windows 7..
it's not the fault of this torrent but of Bioware for not presenting a decent fix..

Good thing I didn't actualy buy it i guess.."
,DarthPhnx,2012-01-24T20:02Z,I'm able to make my character and stuff but when it gets to the end of the beginning cut scene it crashes. Is there a way to fix that? I have Vista.
,KIDWizdom,2012-02-06T02:52Z,didnt get an extras folder
,helenstephanou,2012-03-13T22:36Z,Seed please :)
,Mr.hatchetman,2012-03-25T08:11Z,i hope this works........
,nateq,2012-03-25T21:49Z,"Excellent torrent!  This is one of the best I've ever downloaded.  I actually bought the game online a few months ago, but it never came in the mail. This was a great replacement--possibly better than the original with the inclusion of the no-cd crack.

I'm a novice downloader, but I used Power ISO and followed the readme to the letter, and the game works perfectly.  I encountered none of the problems below on my Windows 7 64-bit."
,rndm94,2012-04-07T20:22Z,i'm running windows 7 and i'm having the crash problem after the character creation. my laptop and desktop are nearly identical except for the video cards and it ran fine on the desktop. my laptop has an intel chipset while my desktop has an nvidia. 
,rndm94,2012-04-07T20:26Z,"oh, and my laptop is 64 bit while the desktop is 32"
,yesnohello,2012-04-29T04:07Z,"Hello, i followed the instructions step by step, but it doesnt work.

when i try to run it the game ""stops responding""

i use W7 32...

One thing....The step when u r supposed to copy from the No-crack folder into the installation folder(?) it says ""i can create a shortcut here, do you want to create a shortcut to desktop instead?"" or something like that....? :c"
,seamus1995,2012-05-05T15:32Z,works for me thanks
,duffman94,2012-06-02T00:38Z,im running windows xp and would like to know if this will work on my system. i have an intel pentium 4 2.80ghz. itd be great to know if itll work cuz im a huge fan of the star wars KOTOR games and would love to play it
