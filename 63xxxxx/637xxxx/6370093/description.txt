Dr. Phil continues his frank discussion with four women whoâ€™ve had affairs with married men. While two scorned wives watch from backstage, the women reveal what they really think about their loverâ€™s wife. What would they say to her if confronted? Then, Dana, 39, and Sue, 45, are reeling from the news that their husbands had affairs and are trying to pick up the pieces of their lives and family. Hear their heartfelt and angry reactions to the mistresses when they confront the women face to face. Plus, one mistress reveals that sheâ€™s married. Her husband joins the discussion to share the damaging effects that her infidelity has had on him and their son. And, former mistress Sarah Symonds has words of warning for the other women. Will this be a wake-up call for the mistresses? Will the wives find some healing or closure? Donâ€™t miss the explosive finale, and find out: Did the other women cut their married men loose?
