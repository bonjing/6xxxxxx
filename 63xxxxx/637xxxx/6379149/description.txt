Ripped from the new live stream from Glenn Beck's web site. I have edited out the  music played during the commercial breaks.

NOTES: This is my last upload before getting on a plane back to the States!  25 hours of flying so I will miss at least one show if not 2.  I'll up them when I get on the ground.

Stu & Pat only today.  So it's like 4 hours of the 4th hour so 16 hours, but I only got 3 hours so that's like 16/3 = 5.3333 hours, right?
