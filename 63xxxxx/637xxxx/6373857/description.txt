Sao Paulo Indy 300, May 1/2 2011:
---------------------------------
The race was scheduled for Sunday May 1. After a rain delay the race was stopped and the remainder was postponed to Monday May 2. A total of 14 laps were completed on May 1. 
Due to the delays and TV contracts, the race was not able to go the scheduled 75 laps, and turned into a timed race. A total of 55 laps were completed.
This file contains:
- Highlights from the Sunday laps including the start and some crashes. A good part of the 14 laps from Sunday were run under yellow.
- All the racing from Monday.


Technical issues regarding .mkv files and some Media Players:
-------------------------------------------------------------
I recently bought a Patriot PBO Core Media Player and noticed that some .mkv files would play sound, but not video. The player did not recognize the video codec. 

After a bit of research I found that this happens with some Media Players. According to matroska.org the problem is "broken/incomplete players". They have released a command line tool, "mkclean tool" which according to them: "Also comes with mkWDclean to modify files in a way they can play in broken/incomplete players."

The "mkclean tool" can be downloaded from matroska.org
The steps to use the tool are very simple:
- I did this in Windows XP
- Extract the downloaded .zip file to a folder of your choice. I usually stick with short folder names when using command line tools to avoid problems. I suggest renaming the video file into something small and workable to avoid typos.
- I will use "c:\mkclean" as the folder name and "movie.mkv" as the file name
- Start a command prompt, then go to "c:\mkclean" and type:
mkWDclean movie.mkv

The process creates a new file with name "clean.movie.mkv"
I was only getting sound and no video from this file in Patriot PBO Core Media Player, but after running it through "mkWDclean" the video works fine.


Remember that this is free! If you have something positive to say great, if not, no one cares about your bitching!!
