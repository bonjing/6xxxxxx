,fastmine,2011-05-15T21:00Z,Forgot to mention that I usualy watch anime late so I cant seed all nights but I will seed almost all day. And if you want to find out when you should have on the program you use to download then you should find out what time it is in Norway cuz that is the time im using.
,thegr8pistachio,2011-05-24T14:15Z,"For a first torrent it is excellent!
The only problem(for me) anyway is that most of the anime is mkv, rm, rmvb etc. and i find them a pain to burn.
Had I been informed in the description i probably would not have downloaded(although I got the avi and other ones).
Also can you try and compress them? Most of the torrents I've downloaded are compressed.
I know Its a bit rich for me to make comments as I haven't created a torrent but These are some tips for you next ones!
TL:DR Great Torrent, Filestypes should be in discription"
,fastmine,2011-05-26T21:05Z,"I am sorry but since this is the first torrent I have uploaded I dont know so much about what to put in the desc. But thanks for the tip. Just to say it, I usualy watch the anime on my computer and I hook it up to the TV. And I got a storage device, so everything is saved in there."
,fastmine,2011-07-07T18:39Z,"When you are done seeding please help me seed since I cant seed all the time. And you all know how long it may take. But if you relly love anime it will be worth it. I have downloaded many other anime series since I uploaded this and I plan on making a new upload. Hopfully it wont be so big and im sorry but I dont know how too compress the files so I wont do it. But it might take a few months untill im gonna upload anohter pack but if you are interested, you should check back in maybe 6 months or more because I will gather many more and try to get those who arnt uploaded anymore in it. But I will also put out many new ones so only download it if you think its worth it. "
