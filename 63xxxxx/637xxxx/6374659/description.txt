The Troma Team brings you a front-row seat to the first ever Tromadance: the only film festival of the people, for the people and by the people!! Thumbing its nose at the arrogant Sundunce Film Fartstival, Tromadance also takes place at Park City, UT at the same time. Best of Tromadance, Vol. 1: Soiled Shorts presents a behind the scenes VIP pass to all the subversive, idealistic and artistic energy of truly independent cinema. Some selections from the event are The Nothing Deal, Reds Breakfast II: Dawn of the Red, Zitlover, Spag, and Harry Knuckles and the Treasure of the Aztec Mummy. In addition thereâ€™s an exclusive documentary of backstage and insanity by drunken Tromadance volunteers, celebrity interviews and arousing footage from the Tromadance â€œGlow in the Darkâ€ party starring the gynoâ€™s of Miss Hawaiian Tropic!!! Tromadance can boast something no other film festival can! It gives Independent film back to the people!
