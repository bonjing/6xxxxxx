Here is the patch notes for Civilization V - patch 1.0.1.275 + DLC http://forums.2kgames.com/showthread.php?89117-Patch-Notes

This is incremental update, so you need to install SKIDROW Update 7 first.

All DLC released after Update 7 are included:
-Polynesia DLC
-Denmark - The Vikings DLC
-Explorerâ€™s Map Pack

Crack is obtained from Chinese 3DMGAME forums, so big thanks to those guys for their hard work.

For installation, just copy files from this archive to game main folder.


Important note:
This release is English only! Patched files for several important text files are only provided in English language.
 
Basically just make sure you have SKIDROW Update 7 already installed/cracked first. Then download this torrent and extract the entire thing into your Civ V folder. Enjoy and seed away. For some reason it says viking content is available for download even though this contains the viking content. Don't worry about it as the vikings are there; trust me.
