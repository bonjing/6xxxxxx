[V],SAFCukO09,2011-05-08T19:30Z,720p is up
,EdoSensei,2011-05-09T08:00Z,"Is this downloading very slowly for everyone else? Only at 19% after 12 hours!

There's 289 seeds so that's strange no?"
,EdoSensei,2011-05-09T17:22Z,"It's finished now, but I have a question for you SAFCukO09.

Is there anything you do differently between the standard def qualifying file and the standard def race file? 

I ask because the qualifying plays fine when I copy it to a USB stick and play it through my PS3, but the race file doesn't play!??? I have to watch it on my PC which is a small monitor. I think the 1st race of the season didn't suffer from this problem but the subsequent 3 races have."
,udp2,2011-05-10T06:28Z,"SAFCukO09 rulez!  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!  Some of us don't have the bandwidth for the HD version, and don't care when this is more than pretty enough.  PLEASE I beg of you, don't stop uploading smaller resolution (actually I'd love ~1GB)!  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!"
,doser69,2011-05-13T15:09Z,"ANGELiC ... PLEASE ... Stop encoding videos using whatever shit fucked up codec this is.

Doesn't open in Windows Media Player.

STOP TESTING STUFF IN VLC.

It's not DivX, it's not Xvid, I have FFDshow and AC3filter installed - and it doesn't work.

Sort it out.

Get the 720p instead people."
,doser69,2011-05-13T15:15Z,"According to VLC it is XviD

It just doesn't open in Windows Media Player

Meaning the file is FUCKED.

Don't bother people - get the 720p instead."
,skjeggbulbul,2011-05-15T09:50Z,"The encoding is fine (complain to Microsoft if your player is broken). However the video is aborted right after the awards ceremony - no interviews or post-race comments. This seems to be a recurring problem with Angelic uploads.
