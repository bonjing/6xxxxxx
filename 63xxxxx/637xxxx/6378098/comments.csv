,frogshare,2011-06-16T17:12Z,"Why don't you make 480p rips at that size. It'd turn out to be of much better quality. A 3,5 hrs movie cannot be squeezed into 720p resolution at that size. It simply looks horrible then, with lots of artifacts. Big frame size isn't everything. It doesn't mean more quality. If the bitrate is too low, then it's just artefacts at bigger size."
,uglifruit,2011-07-21T17:40Z,The best movie ever.

,Mr.Lucifero,2011-12-13T09:39Z,"Decent copy for the small size....V=7.5....Below DVD quality....In my opinion, more MiB is needed....Any scenes in the dark or dark article of clothings worn by characters noticeably suffers in terms of visual quality....Watchable but not a Great copy...."
