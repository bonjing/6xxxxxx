A good deal on car phones provides and excellent opportunity for Arthur to do a deal with an old business colleague just out from prison. When the local plod get wind of the dodgy car phone signals and the attention of Chisholm, Terry is busy falling in love, and being stitched up from all sides.

Poor old Terry gets a right old pasting half way through this episode with very little help from Arthur. This episode really shows the depths that Arthur will go to make a little earner even if it involves taking total advantage of Terry, though watch out for the twist in the tail in which everybody gets what they deserve. Television stations in the UK seem reluctant to repeat this episode in any re-runs and as yet we have not found out why!061. Return Of The Invincible Man - 18-Sep-85

Who is this we see here? Is it really Mr Black? 

This episode sees Arthur living in a fantasy world as he resorts to desperate measures to avoid the inland revenue.

Terry is fortunate to receive tickets for the Orient Express after he helps the daughter of the deceased Jack South, a villain from years back. Arthur, who is trying to avoid a court subpoena from Chisolm and Rycott due to his involvement with Brain \'Brain\' Damage, decides his best course of action is to tag along, much to the dislike of Terry. Chisolm meanwhile, has landed an observatory position with Interpol aka \"Interplod\"..

Many fans consider this to be the point at which the series peaked - a classic British TV film with a host of star names. Both George Cole and Johnny Goodman (Executive in Charge of Production) have stated that this is \'probably\' their most favourite episode of the whole series, and certainly the most fun to make as it had such a diverse supporting cast.
