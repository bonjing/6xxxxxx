        Not that he's bragging or anything.

        In April 2009, Tom brought his debut solo show, Tom Ballard Is
        What He Is to the Melbourne International Comedy Festival  and
        was  the  youngest person  EVER  to take  out  the prestigious
        Melbourne Airport Best Newcomer award. Is What He Is was  also
        nominated for a Golden  Gibbo Award; an award  that recognizes
        independent shows  that "buck  trends and  pursue the artist's
        ideas more strongly than it puruses any commercial lure". 

        Following  on from  his successes  in Melbourne,  in 2009  Tom
        travelled overseas to perform at the Just For Laughs  festival
        in  Montreal and  then on  to the  Edinburgh Fringe  Festival.
        Rounding out 2009, Tom then brought a brand new stand-up  show
        to the Melbourne Fringe  Festival.In 2010, Tom returned to the
        Melbourne  Comedy  Festival and  visited  the Brisbane  Comedy
        Festival for the first time with a new show, Cogito Ergo  Some
        Funny where he played to packed houses.

        Tom has been a guest on an extensive range of radio shows  all
        around  Australia,  and can  be  seen as  a  regular guest  on
        Network Ten's Good News Week and The 7PM Project.

        In 2011,  Tom's first  DVD was  released of  his award winning
        show Is What  He Is as  part of the  Warehouse Comedy Festival
        series.  A 30 minute television special of this recording will
        also be aired on ABC TV in 2011.

        La-di-dah.

        Tom's  mum thinks  he's quite  funny, but  wishes he  wouldn't
        swear quite as much as he does.
