,thoth1964,2011-05-09T23:31Z,Where we can find a copy without hardcoded subs?
,abhikrit,2011-05-19T08:09Z,why would you ask for a copy without hardcoded subs? 
,valiumHD,2011-05-20T09:06Z,"@ abhikrit

Hello ! The reason why is simply because a few people on this planet don't live in a country where english is mainly spoken. For example, i'm french and need french subs... hardcoded eng subs bother me most of the time..."
,valiumHD,2011-05-20T10:17Z,"And for changing aspect ratio, that's how this movie has been shot."
,AlfNader,2011-09-25T22:25Z,"FYI: English subs are hardcoded on the actual blu-ray.
