,LethalKi11ler,2011-05-09T09:26Z,"@knight90 Depending on your console's language the game's language will adapt. So if your console's language is english, the game will be in english.

On another note please seed people, 7 seeders and 207 leechers is selfish as hell. I'm downloading at 100 kb/s and seeding at 300 kb/s..."
