,traloth,2011-10-05T17:22Z,"hmmm I feel I should elucidate that its the lack of talent of the performers which I find disappointing and that there is no flaw, anyway, shape or form with the torrent, which is of an excellent quality. Unlike the cast....."

,MOOKandBEE,2012-03-19T00:23Z,"I have a considerably different opinion from the other commenters.  The only sheer lack of talent in this cast is the Jonas brother destroying the Marius role.

Otherwise, this cast, like all casts, has strengths and weaknesses.  I grew up with the Broadway Cast recording.  It's my standard.

Yet I must admit that I think Colm Wilkinson has met his match in this one.

So don't dismiss this.  Watch it.  Have your own opinion.  But to say there is ""no"" talent is a gross and unfair overstatement."
,MOOKandBEE,2012-03-19T00:42Z,"I think I need to qualify my statement.  Colm Wilkinson has a great ""character"" voice.  You know it's Colm before he sings his second note.  And that's fine.

Alfie Boe is the new Jean Valjean and he's more operatic in training.  He sounds like a total pro.  And he delivers in a very different and, in my opinion, more satisfying and interesting way.

So it's a matter of preference.  Lack of talent is a non-issue."
