,BROKEN81,2011-05-18T21:08Z,i can see why u would say im spamming. did not mean to put my code in 2 times. i guess it takes time for it to show up so i just press submit alot. or just exit the page come back and to it again. this code i played full price for. so it cost me alot of money. so i want everone to have it as well as you.
[V],DeGun,2011-05-19T15:25Z,"@@ BROKEN : so i did instal the version of tunebit 8 from my torrent , then entered your key then had full version after have restarted Tunebit so thank you for sharing your key which work perfectly .

I'm sure TPB userz will appreciate it as well .
Credits to you - well done .

Jah Bless

,BROKEN81,2011-05-19T23:08Z,"thanks for that man, also i cant find on the net anything about this. audialsone 4 had about 5 skins. audials 8 only has 2. is there any way i can get audials 4 skins to work with 8? or any way i can make my own?"
