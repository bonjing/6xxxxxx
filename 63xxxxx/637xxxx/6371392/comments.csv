,tweezy,2011-05-08T01:58Z,not sure if why or how it happened but the audio in mine is corrupt.  pops and pings every second.  Could've just been a bad transfer during download.  Can anyone confirm?
,scanovic,2011-05-09T00:43Z,Same situation here. Waste of 2 days to download this now have to look for an inferior video quality just get the sound to work.  Thanks for your download regardless.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-05-12T20:35Z,there are problems with the video.  it is true.  But I don't know if it effects the overall experience.  Seems audio is in sync and picture is ok.  some sort of hiccups in the data tracks.
