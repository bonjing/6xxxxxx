Recalling Siouxsie Sioux and Sinead O'Connor, Morissette's vocals coo and writhe, exuding a spectacular confidence of self, and letting her get away with lines like "I recommend biting off more than you can chew." The audio palette of flamenco guitar fills, distortion-drenched power chords and house-ready drum beats allow for Morissette to weave her songs in and out of genres, as easily as she goes through moods. Seemingly contradictory emotions come through in her feelings on falling in love on "Head Over Feet" ("You've already won me over in spite of me.../I couldn't help it/It's all your fault"). JAGGED LITTLE PILL is modern and aware music from a daring young songwriter.
