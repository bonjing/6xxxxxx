Next description is taken from official website:

Life is like a movie. Bringing itself only emptiness of motion image blowed up by music could breath, completely changing impression of reality. Music is the one you couldnâ€™t feel without.  Specially Addictive Soundtrack brings life to revive.

There is a day when you feel loneliness. There is a mind that everyone turns away from you. There is a strong feeling that this is your ideal attitude. Thing you couldnâ€™t live without. Solitude. Your own world where you could dream for hours. World which forever will stay inside of you and always will be as just as you wished to. This is the world of genius. It was imaginary by you.

Nobody. Nobody could be the same as you are. Nobody could think in a similar way and have identical fantasies. One is the word which will be forever with you. nobody.one
