A nice collection for Katy Perry die-hards. Practically it's an updated version of the one found on my "The Ultimate Complete Discography & Videography Collection" torrent. Check it out http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6147645/Katy_Perry_-_The_Ultimate_Complete_Discography__amp__Videography_Col and also download this one. 

Includes live collaborations and covers, previews, demos and unreleased tracks that don't fit elsewhere(e.g. the interludes).

All of the songs are in the highest quality possible, that means there are no songs recorded by cameras or mobiles, only songs ripped from HD videos,official TV or radio broadcast, official online stream, (except "Playing House, cuz it's an original song)". Enjoy, comment, seed and rate!
