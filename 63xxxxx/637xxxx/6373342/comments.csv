,BloodyxCape,2011-05-10T05:27Z,hey seedkey....i was wondering if the disc you uploaded was scratched at all. for some reason it skips near the hour and a half mark. i tried burning it again thinking maybe something was wrong with my disc but it did it again. just wasn't too sure.....still enjoyed it though. but regardless thanks so much for all your uploads including this one! i appreciate everything you do for us.
