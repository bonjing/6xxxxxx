,thehellhound456,2011-05-22T20:38Z,Downloading right now. will seed. Arent there 64 episoeds of FMA Brotherhood? They been dubbed yet?
,Horseband,2011-06-03T04:41Z,"@thehellhound456

The highest episode dubbed in english is 52 as of this moment. I'm not sure how people have episode 52 already even, because cartoon network is only at episode 48.

The series should be fully dubbed in like 4 months or so assuming they don't take a break playing episodes"
,darkyslay,2011-06-04T16:27Z,how is the quality?
,shawny23,2011-06-10T01:05Z,"Thanks so much for the up!!! Love the show! I have trouble reading subtitles and I don't understand Japanese so I really appreciate these dubs!

Any chance on episodes 53-64?"

,freezoid,2011-08-25T18:47Z,I just cant understand how u ppl can watch it dubbed...
,Jashadow,2011-10-12T06:59Z,"@freezoid
Because Full metal alchemist brotherhood subbed is terrible.  There are only some anime's that are better dubbed than subbed, and FMAB is one of them."
