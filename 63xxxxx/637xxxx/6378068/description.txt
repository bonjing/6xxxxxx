Formula One 2011 Season Turkey, Race(Torrent)

This is NOT meant to be a dig, but the only person that is being generous in providing coverage of F1 this year, is now only providing it only in HD. PLEASE do not think of me badly, but I live in Thailand where there is the worst provision of the internet of anywhere I know. The quickest speeds are (supposed to be) 6 Mb! I am lucky to get 450 Kb - indeed - normally around 80 - 180 Kb! So, HD files, at more than 3 Gigs are just to big to download in any sort of realistic time!

For that reason, I am providing - with a time lag I'm afraid - normal low res files, which I, and perhaps others, wil find more realistic for their needs.
