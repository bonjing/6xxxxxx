NOTE: It will give an error (The User account has been Modified so won't load correctly). Just click the [A] button until you get back to the dashboard.

2) Using your normal Controller Log into your Account

3) Using your account load the game you want to play

NOTE: As long as the game owner is logged in on your console any user can play the games. If you try to play without the owner logged in they will show as demo's

NOTE: You must be able to connect to XBoxLive (Gold or Silver) so will not work on banned consoles"

You don;t even have to do that much. It's DRM-Free. Just move to HDD and Play."
,SYNAESTHE5IA,2011-05-11T15:21Z,"Can anyone, besides the original uploader (thanks for the upload, by the way), confirm that these work?

Also, if they do, can you play these while connected to XBL, or do they need to be played offline only?"
,Bigtimer5,2011-05-11T22:28Z,"@SYNAESTHE5IA:
Just trust me. And yes you CAN be connected to XBL."
,shasashu,2011-05-12T20:48Z,hi... thanks for the upload. can you pls upload some other big xbla titles?
,Bigtimer5,2011-06-29T18:58Z,"@shasashu:
Sorry. I could but not many others are DRM-Free."
