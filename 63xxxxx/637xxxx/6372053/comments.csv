Waiting for reboot. My ipod touch 4g 4.3.3 shows lines and nothing more i can turn it off and nothing has changed. What did i do wrong? Can someone help me?"
,steve2080,2011-10-13T05:45Z,cooky23 if you have a multicore processor (which i am guessing you do since i do also and had this exact problem too) make sure your affinity is set to cpu 0 before opening redsnow or similar program by opening task manager pointing to redsnow under the processes tab in task manager and right click then click on set affinity uncheck all but cpu 0 should work...oh and remember to do this every time you reopen redsnow it doesnt stick after a session.
