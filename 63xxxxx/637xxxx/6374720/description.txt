With refreshing practicality and easy-to-follow instructions, Weight Watchers' chief scientific officer Miller-Kovach shows how a family can take small steps to eliminate childhood weight problems and establish a "healthy-weight home... in which everyone who lives there has a lifestyle that encourages them to be at a weight that is right and healthy for them." The steps in this process are unthreatening lifestyle changes, such as focusing on nutritious foods, including treats; rationing nonhomework TV time; being active one hour or more every day; and having these changes apply to the whole family. Miller-Kovach outlines parents' responsibilities for ensuring a healthful diet for their kids: they must be food role models, food enforcers, activity providers and activity enforcers.
