    THE AVENGERS, the hip secret-agent series from '60s TV, is reinvented for
    the movies with a stylish blend of wit, fabulous retro fashions and
    effects-packed action. Ralph Fiennes is the very dapper John Steed and
    Uma Thurman is the smartly catsuited Emma Peel, two secret agents who fight
    crime with style. Sean Connery portrays Sir August De Wynter, an evil genius
    out to control the world with his high-tech weather machine. This madman
    poses quite a threat to mankind with his raging icestorms, scorching
    temperatures and mechanical buzz-bombing bees. But come cold, heat or
    dreaded plight, our two heroes never lose their cool. Tea anyone?
