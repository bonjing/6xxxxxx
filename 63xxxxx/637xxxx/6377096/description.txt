A while ago, I went through a really big Nightwish phase and wanted to hear some of the older songs with Anette singing. This audio is all ripped from live concerts on Youtube, so the quality is iffy at best. However, I don't think any of it is too terrible. I hope you enjoy it.

"Kuolema Tekee Taitejilian" isn't from a Nightwish concert, but from a performance by Anette with a Swedish orchestra.

Tracks included:
She Is My Sin
Kuolema Tekee Taitejilian
Dark Chest Of Wonders

Ghost Love Score (my favorite of the bunch)
