Well here i go with my version of Thor.Thanks to Imagine and Our French and German friends for the Cam and IMAGINE for audio.Now everyone has taken IMAGINES video and reencoded a reencode i used the original files and worked from there.Onto the Work done.This was a really good cam aside from that they cut some pieces out now i didnt include them as i didnt see any need for them no dialogue or nothing is being missed there was none in these 2 scenes thanks to imagine for pointing it out but i decided not to use them then it was on to resyncing the file 3 cuts and done.I did include the ending portion as i seen that was important thanks to imagine again for providing me with it.Now onto the filtering lowered the saturation a bit changed the hue slightly increased gama and black levels and sharpened the video.all in all it looks good.Hope you all enjoy from BDK
