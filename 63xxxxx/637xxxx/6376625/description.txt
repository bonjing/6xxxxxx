plot

Young mother Madylyn Mabry puts her daughter to bed while her husband Jack watches golf on television. A bee buzzes around the window as she stays with her girl. After the child is asleep, she goes downstairs and announces she's leaving, saying "You keep my soul in a dungeon." He takes a moment to disconnect from the game, then runs upstairs to the bedroom and holds their daughter out the window, threatening to drop her if Madylyn leaves. "Do you think I won't? Do you think I won't?" he yells at her. She agrees to stay but rushes to close the window, killing the bee that was a focal point earlier in the scene.
Many years later, Jack Mabry (Robert De Niro) and Madylyn (Frances Conroy) return home from church for a quiet afternoon in what appears to be an idyllic lifestyle of a long-married couple approaching retirement together. He watches TV and drinks in an identical pose to his younger self in the earlier scene, while she works on a jigsaw puzzle. Late that night a call wakes them. Jack picks up the phone and hears a woman's voice. "Betsy?" he asks, obviously distressed. We find him at church the next day, speaking at his brother Bobby's funeral.
