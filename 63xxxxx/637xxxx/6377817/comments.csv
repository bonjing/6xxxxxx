Hi-Def .mp4 video of ALL fights including the main event.  NO PASSWORD needed.  Rapidshare, download each file individually.  DO NOT batch download.  Use winrar to extract."
,rapm3tal666,2011-05-09T15:04Z,Fake video ... Cant play ......just wasting time ..
,NewMex52,2011-05-09T16:35Z,"Hi-def .mp4 video files require a special viewer (like VLC Media player) to playback.
It would also help to have a fast computer - at least a Pentium 4 with 2gb or more ram.
Download the files soon, before the links go dead.  The .mp4 video playsback very clean
with no problem, using VLC Media player.  I have not downloaded any of the torrentz here."
