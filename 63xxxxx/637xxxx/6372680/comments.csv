,Duhya2,2011-05-07T03:36Z,I'd like some people to confirm this is not fake to not scare off people who think everything is a virus.
,NadTheBat,2011-05-07T03:45Z,"So far I think it's fake. It crashes immediately after you open it. But then again, all the files that would make up a normal game are there. so who knows. I'll comment again if I can get it to work. (Some INSTRUCTIONS would be nice...)"
,BigD145,2011-05-07T04:09Z,You need the dotnet 4 and xna 4 frameworks. This is supposed to be such an early version that it's not even worth looking at. You'd get more out of the youtube content.
,alxalxalxalx,2011-05-07T04:13Z,"BigD145 is correct, download those 2 n it will work, but it is a VERY early version. As the torrent says, PRE-alpha, this is the version before even alpha release. The version they are playing on youtube is late alpha/early beta."
,Duhya2,2011-05-07T04:14Z,"Just download, unzip, and click on the Terraria application file. It has a xbox controller for a icon.
When ingame ESC opens Inv. Q throws items.
Space jumps. You can kill some motherfucking monsters and mine stuff, but it is lacking most of the items in the newest version."
,zxywlol,2011-05-07T04:20Z,It works!
,NadTheBat,2011-05-07T04:55Z,"Well, it does work, and like most other people have said, it sucks. Good if you want to try it out I guess."
,Duhya2,2011-05-07T06:15Z,Just a teaser so you get ready to buy (or torrent) the real game.
,voidelo,2011-05-07T06:29Z,"Just what i wanted before make my mind to buy, test the controls.
You sir, is a saver."
,Mikeydunn420,2011-05-07T08:20Z,its only a tease but thank you!!
,Stafare,2011-05-07T11:41Z,"This is legitimate! nice work uploader, no idea how you got it, but its exactly as described just unzip it. its a very VERY early version but its a good way to get an idea of how it feels to play the final version!"
,Katnipz,2011-05-07T17:31Z,"I would like to confirm that this is the game, thank you for uploading it.

A few other things I would like to say it that there are caves.

They are DEEP underground though. (There will be a background of dirt and rocks.)

I was able to gather silver down there, and there is also red slimes.

Me and my inventory."
,Duhya2,2011-05-07T18:00Z,Holy shit there are caves? I only explored the surface for caves before uploading but i will check now. I wish there was a way to save besides hiding in a dirt house.
,xxmahrixx,2011-05-07T18:40Z,"so , how do I save the game ?"
,Katnipz,2011-05-08T16:32Z,"@Duhya2
You need to go very, very deep underground to get to them.

A few other things I want to mention is that there is (Of the ores I found)
Gold, Silver, Iron, and Copper.

And the monsters in the game are:
(All slimes) Green, Blue, Yellow, Red.

(I'm not trying to spoiler it for anyone I just don't want people to feel that there is no content to go searching for.)"
,Duhya2,2011-05-08T19:26Z,"I went deep and found some caves.
I noticed that you cannot build with wood, you can smelt without a furnace. When you die you lose everything thats not in one of your 10 hot keys."
,Katnipz,2011-05-10T18:28Z,Does anyone know why the other terraria download got removed?
,christonian,2011-05-10T23:11Z,no idea hope it didnt have anything
,Duhya2,2011-05-11T00:49Z,"The other one was the same version as this torrent, it had the source code in it according to the description though."
,Katnipz,2011-05-11T01:01Z,"I was just wondering if it had a virus or not, I can re-upload it if needed."
,Duhya2,2011-05-11T06:00Z,"If you want to, but i don't think its worth it messing with the source code when newer, more playable versions will be released as early as June."
,N.N.N.N,2011-05-11T17:46Z,"yeah, i'd like the source. if you got time.."
,webmaster9,2011-05-12T01:52Z,"The other upload had INDEED a virus. It was removed cause it was the second time he posted that cause the first too had a virus. If you had the source thigny, DELETE IT AND GET AN ANTI-VIRUS NOW! Cause an virus sucesfullly entered ur pc :3. Hope i helped into the aknowelge of what is undergoing right now. "
,dbee16,2011-05-12T18:59Z,"I know this is not a virus, i downloaded it on my shitty PC but when i try to play it on my other computer (windows 7 64bit) it won't start, i have 7zipped it and clicked on the ee and nothing happens.. any ideas?"
,christonian,2011-05-12T20:58Z,no idea this works on my Win 7 64bit

,Duhya2,2011-05-12T22:47Z,"If it doesn't work google up XNA 4.0 and download that shit.
Terraria will be released on May 16th (MONDAY!)
for $9.99USD.
Can't wait to get it legally or otherwise."
,coladraken,2011-05-12T23:37Z,"Warning to those who downloaded the 0770/0881 builds that has been around.

If you tried to run the 0.8.8.1 you now got a keylogger trojan/virus. Don't feel safe just because you have an antivirus because this one sails past several I tried with. NOD32 and Avast! didn't notice at all. Panda saw some activity but didn't block it.

Check your TEMP folder (easy way: start/run and type %temp% and it will open) for the file dclogs.sys wich will contain the stolen data. It will be created whenever you type in any program. If you open it in a texteditor you can see for yourself what it has collected."
,christonian,2011-05-13T00:31Z,duhya where did you see the price please post link
,Duhya2,2011-05-13T00:49Z,"http://terrariaonline.com/threads/terraria-coming-to-steam-monday-9-99.2702/

Do you guys want me to upload a legit beta?

Someone will have to find out why it crashes on my computer when i try to run it though. I went through the files and it has all the items and npcs and such."
,christonian,2011-05-13T01:14Z,"ya go ahead on beta

,Duhya2,2011-05-13T03:38Z,"Shit i just noticed i got ninja'd. Whatever, two torrents never hurt anybody, its not a contest. Share the love."
