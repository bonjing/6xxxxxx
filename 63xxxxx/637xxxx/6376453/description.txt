This third volume of the best-selling GPU Gems series provides a snapshot of todayâ€™s latest Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) programming techniques. The programmability of modern GPUs allows developers to not only distinguish themselves from one another but also to use this awesome processing power for non-graphics applications, such as physics simulation, financial analysis, and even virus detectionâ€”particularly with the CUDA architecture. Graphics remains the leading application for GPUs, and readers will find that the latest algorithms create ultra-realistic characters, better lighting, and post-rendering compositing effects.

Major topics include

Geometry
Light and Shadows
Rendering
Image Effects
Physics Simulation
GPU Computing
