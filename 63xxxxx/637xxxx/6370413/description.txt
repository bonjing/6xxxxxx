Life's not so great for Mitch Weaver (Macdonald). He's just lost his girlfriend, his job and now his best friend's dad (Warden) needs a new heart! But the only way to arrange the transplant is to cut a deal with a surgeon (Chase) with a gambling problem in other words, find $50,000 or the old man dies! Out of work and out of options, all Mitch and his friend have to rely on is their one natural talent, revenge! Whether planting phony hookers in cars or stinking up houses with rotting fish, these "Revenge Specialists for Hire" are sick, dirty and good! But when a rich client refuses to pay up after a job well done, they make him realize exactly who he's messing with after all, getting even is their business!
