These are the 16 tracks that NPR has been streaming for free, just that I fished their FLV file and then extracted the audio track, which was a 44100 Hz, 128 kbps MP3.  The raw stream was extracted, so the quality is exactly the same as what NPR served out.  I assume the not yet released iTunes digital download will be better quality, but until then, enjoy.

I added basic MP3 tags and an album thumbnail image, but that's about it since there will be better torrents out there after the soundtrack is released.  I am definitely going to buy this CD, which honestly doesn't happen unless I am totally blown away by something like this that lives up to the hype and exceeded my expectations.
