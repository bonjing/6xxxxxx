,keith28,2011-05-08T17:00Z,its  not working for me either usually if its ap2.5 it will at least read the disc it wont even say what game is in the system is this ap2.5 or can anyone shed some light on my situation sounds like is gonna play but doesnt then i get a disk read error and still wont reconize the game
,Lobyone,2011-05-08T17:17Z,has anyone played the game? how is it? is it that good that everyone is stuck playing it?
,ShinoBoy,2011-05-08T17:25Z,"@keith28: I think it is ap25 then, because it's acting similarly (black screen, not showing info on dashboard).  Ran it through abgx and nothing, so might have to wait until abgx database is updated with Brink info to patch it."
,keith28,2011-05-08T18:35Z,so i got it to work what i did was run it through abgx it made a dvd file for me then burned the dvd file and wolla bam its working. I didnt run through abgx thee first time i burned it i just burned the iso maybe thats tha problem But all in all this game sux i played for 20 minutes figured it would be alot better kinda like left 4 dead just no zombies maybe the online portion of the game will be better

If you didn't know that you needed the .dvd file file as well as the .iso, then you shouldn't be downloading games. Seriously it is not that difficult. I know chris, you shouldn't HAVE to put the .dvd file in with, but it may work out a little better for the morons that don't know how to do this. But great upload thanks dude."

,dragkhar,2011-05-12T02:58Z,"Am i missing something here, Maybe I'm reliving my Noob days, but where is the .dvd, or should i be asking how do i get it from a game i just downloaded. My agbx also says "".iso isn't recognized as an Xbox or 360 ISO or stealth file!"" 

I never comment on these because there's always douchebags that wanna point out what a dumbass people are and never give an answer, but in this case, bring on the insults because i wanna know. This isnt the first game i've seen without the .dvd. Thx (for whoever helps)"
,dragkhar,2011-05-14T04:59Z,"Well i answered my own question, For whoever may not know, run it through AGBX and it will generate the file needed for Img burn (that's what i use). 

And for the noobs, the only stupid question is one not asked. Were all noobs at one time or another.  

P.S. I downloaded this twice and didn't get it to work, in the end i downloaded the other one that's currently on the top 100 in 360 games. "
,IMUSA73,2011-05-14T06:43Z,"I just wanted to make a comment about the game itself... I watched several trailers of this game and it seemed a little interesting... I was sorta leery since it had a unique art to the graphical animation and thought that it would be just something different.. I also liked some of the features it was presenting with being able to play as different characters with special abilities and also being able to customize them some... I thought.. wow... what I cool change... different approach to a multiplayer game....

Then I played it day of release and was sadly disappointed.   Everyone I know that had great expectations were really let down like myself.   

So if you value your bandwidth and you had similar expectations of the game you may want to think before deciding to download this game and playing it.  It's not the worse game I ever played.. but it didn't exactly come anywhere close to what I was hoping to see in this game.   I apologize for giving such a negative review of the game... but I think there are alot of people that would agree with me on this one mates.   

Bottom line don't waste your time or money on this game if you are looking for something sweet like Call of Duty/Crysis type first person playing... because it doesn't hold a flame to the obvious best rate FPS games."
,d15a5t3r,2011-05-15T12:56Z,"Just got the download done been knowing what to do for a while however have never received a CRC error in ABGX anyways this is what I get when I run it through ABGX...

     AnyDVD style corruption was not detected
     Game CRC = 8F4D4EB6

Game partition CRC does not match the verified ini! There are 4 possibilities:

1. This is a bad rip (the most likely cause). If you're checking a DVD backup
and have AnyDVD or a similar app installed, make absolutely sure the process is
killed! If this is a scene release, search for it on abgx.net and look at the
column ""Bad CRC or Needs Fixing"". If you see a  icon, hover over it with
your mouse to read the alt text. If it says something like ""Bad game data CRC""
or gives the name of a fix (PPF patch), we already know about it. It's also
highly recommended to run abgx360 again with AutoFix set to level 3 if you
applied a PPF to make sure stealth files haven't been corrupted. See ""What is
AnyDVD style corruption?"" in the GUI Quickstart tab for more info on game data
corruption.

2. Your CPU/RAM/HDD/data bus is unstable and corrupted the data during
extraction/burning or while checking the CRC. Make sure to run the sfv and try
extracting it again (assuming you have the sfv/rars) and recheck the ISO/DVD to
see if you get the same CRC.

3. Game data was intentionally modified for some reason. Microsoft does not
take kindly to modifications for any purpose, and even benign changes to game
data or settings will get you banned from Xbox Live!

4. The verified Game CRC in the database is wrong (very unlikely).

,d15a5t3r,2011-05-16T05:07Z,"Dude this has nothing to do with the .dvd file, this is about the game data not matching what is on the ISO.
