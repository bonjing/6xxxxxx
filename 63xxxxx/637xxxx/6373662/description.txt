           PLOT: 
                                           
                                                                     
           Two years after the horrible incident, Julie is back      
           in college and is worse than ever having dreams about     
           the killer. She gets comfort from a new friend named Will.
           Julie's other friend Karla tries to hook the two of them  
           up and when she wins a trip to the Bahamas, she knows     
           that it is perfect. But Ray is still in the picture and   
           Julie only goes as friends. Karla, her boyfriend Tyrell,  
           Julie, and Will take flight right before Ray encounters   
           the fisherman again. He tries to tell Julie not to leave  
           but it is too late. Now in the Bahamas Julie is starting  
           to lighten up and have fun. Then suddenly things start    
           going terribly wrong when a storm hits the Island and     
           people start to disappear. Ray takes a boat to the Island 
           to warn Julie but will he make it on time to save Julie   
           again from the fisherman ?
