Please check the screens and sample before downloading..

If you like the download/encode/upload (not the movie) and my work please click on the ""+1"" next to quality and do comment on it ..

Please seed atleast 1:1 so other people could download as well..

Thank you"

,rogershan12345,2011-05-13T09:32Z,its shit poor audio
,univ_code,2011-05-13T16:32Z,"i don't really care as much about video quality, but if the audio is poor, i'm not watching it. "
,Glowyrm,2011-05-13T18:21Z,"The Audio is not ""shit poor"" as one commenter has said.

It's not 10/10, but it is WAY above ""watchable"". The sound isn't ""tiny"" or ""hollow"" and you don't need much more for a movie like this where it's mostly drama/talking/story.

DL the sample and take a listen, the video is great and the audio is almost as good."
,Mamba4ever,2011-05-13T23:50Z,Why do all releases of this film so far have sub standard audio?  Thought Blu-Ray was out?
,alexpz,2011-05-14T08:55Z,thanks a lot. :)
,sun2244,2011-05-15T02:33Z,"Good rip, good movie
V10 A9.5
Audio could be a little better if u r a perfectionist."
,cinders38,2011-05-16T03:38Z,can someone please help!!! I have downloaded a few movies now with the extension MKV and it takes me to a movie maker programme so I can't seem to watch the movie... what do I do? ;)
,masterac,2011-05-16T07:37Z,"@cinders38

use VLC to watch your video, its a free open-source video player, and work for everything

you can find it on their web site :

,ninline,2011-05-17T02:55Z,"I highly recommend the Western Digital HD TV live box.  I picked up one for 99 bucks at best buy and it plays everything.  I put the movie on a thumb drive and plug it into the box and it plays in glorious HD on my TV.  1080P looks great out of it.  No more worrying with converting video formats. AVI, MKV's no problems.  Love it."
,phrend,2011-05-18T10:15Z,"Can someone please tell me what the ""RC"" means in the ""Source""? (Source: RC 720p Blu-Ray)"
[V],RajMahal,2011-05-18T15:30Z,It's Russian Blu-ray muxed with audio from a R5- line
,phrend,2011-05-19T00:14Z,"Thanks for the up, and the reply RajMahal!"
,kath3,2011-05-19T06:25Z,"Looks and sounds perfect.

Thank you very much"

,fklammer,2011-06-21T20:00Z,"If I use VLC the audio is OK, if I use Windows Media Player (Windows 7) the audio sucks. So go change to VLC if you don't like the audio."
,dvda4evr,2011-08-05T12:15Z,"Audio IS, terrible. I used speakers first, then tried my 2.1 headset. Just got finished watching ""Sucker Punch"" and the difference is night and day. And I don't mean in favor of ""The Lincoln Lawyer"". Or at least not THIS copy. Downloading another copy now to replace. And don't say shit about not being bad audio. It IS! It's like trying to play ALL BASS through speakers no bigger than 4X6... DISTORTION OUT THE ASS!"
,dvda4evr,2011-08-05T12:21Z,And YES! I'm fully aware... and posses VLC. Better but still shitty. V.9-9.5 A.4-> through miro. A.4.5-6.0 at best through VLC!
,dvda4evr,2011-08-05T12:25Z,You better stop taking down the negative posts faggot. TPB is watching!!!
,dvda4evr,2011-08-05T12:28Z,Sry. wrong person. Too many things at once. Sorry RajMahal.
,coderX,2011-10-28T20:37Z,For fucks sake. PUT THE MOVIE IN MP4 OR AVI OR DON'T BOTHER UPLOADING AT ALL YOU STUPID DONKEY DICK BRAINED MOTHERFUCKERS. FUCK!
