I will never understand what so many people find so very difficult about using 7zip or WinRAR to extract an archived release.

Since the uploader is not typically using the files that he is uploading, it is very likely that he never downloads them from his seedbox. It is likely that he controls the seedbox through a residential broadband connection. Would you truly like to wait an extra day while he downloaded and re-uploaded the decompressed file to his seedbox at residential upload speeds? I think not. Oh, and as this file was uploaded by a prolific uploader, he would be doing that for EVERY FUCKING FILE. 

It should also be noted that all Scene releases are packed in this manner. The uploader did not do it himself in case you have not figured that out yet. There are various reasons for this related to FTP/Usenet among other things."

And yes, it takes around 5-10 seconds to extract this release. If that kills you (whiners), fuck off and stay off."
,baretoof,2011-05-09T08:46Z,"@ jmd88 thanks for explaining. I myself hate extracting, but I rather spend 10 sec on extracting then wait more hours for the file to be here unextracted."
,lasa,2011-05-13T19:13Z,"I don't care how it got RARed, but some idiot had to do it in the first place. It sure as hell did not come out recorded/re-encoded like that. 

FYI I'm going to stay and keep whining."
