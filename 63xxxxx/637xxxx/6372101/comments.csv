,JtotheC420,2011-11-12T03:19Z,"I've been seeding this torrent for you guys on my cable internet for 6 months and I've only gotten one comment on the torrent? You guys suck. If you're going to take the time to download the books, at least leave me a comment and let me know what you thought of it."

That should give you a good idea of what it is. "
,Circadian78,2012-01-16T20:53Z,"I registered here just to comment on this torrent. Thank you JtotheC240, you have done a great job compiling this collection. I loved Werewolf more than any other RPG I ever played and I have many of the books in this collection but not all.

Thank you again, man, great torrent. "
,JtotheC420,2012-01-17T14:26Z,"@Circadian78. That's why I compiled it, no one else on the internet has a full torrent. I'm only half a dozen books or so away from having the entire oWoD collection compiled and that's going to be the next thing I upload."
,Circadian78,2012-01-18T21:40Z,"All of the WoD books? That's damn impressive. Much appreciated J, cheers once more!"
,Armoredwerewolf,2012-03-02T05:04Z,"This is AWESOME!!  I LOVE the character sheets!  Makes it a LOT easier to make characters.  Was wondering though, I've been trying to find a world of darkness book.  I THINK it was just called WOD Combat.  It had a bunch of fighting styles and such in it.  Any ideas?"
,jazbrujah,2012-05-04T11:42Z,"Sweet ass torrent bud, lots of thanks!"
,JtotheC420,2012-05-08T16:12Z,"@Armoredwerewolf. I have that book, and have uploaded it with a small collection of misc. WOD of darkness books for you. Here's the link: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7252581"
