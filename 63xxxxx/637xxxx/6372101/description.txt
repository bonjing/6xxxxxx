This is every Werewolf: The Apocalypse book except for the special limited edition of the revised players manual. The only difference between that one and the regular one was a shiny cover, so it is not included. Also included are interactive character sheets for all tribes, breeds, and even Hengeyokai. I have spent a long time putting this together for your pleasure, so seed and enjoy!
