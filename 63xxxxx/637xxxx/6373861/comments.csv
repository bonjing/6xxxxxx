,jorrell0733,2011-05-07T16:46Z,RE: Minimof1. Qualifying in HD will follow later today but will take several hours to encode HD content. Be Patient pls it takes 4-5hrs to encode with handbrake for excellent results!

Sitting in a place where BBC is not available it would be hopeless to follow the F1 scene without your awesomeness! 

Cheers!"
