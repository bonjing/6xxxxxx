This collection features 12 recordings from the early 1970s through 1986, focusing on the vocals of Gomis and SidibÃ© and the guitar work of Togolese virtuoso Barthelemy Atisso. The strength of the collection is the wonderful orchestrations in the early Baobab songs (tracks 1-7), with many of the musicians that Baobab fans love to hear (like Medoune Diallo, N'Diouga Dieng, Mountaga KouyatÃ©, Charly N'Diaye and Issa Cissokho). The swing is relaxed, the feeling one of early evening in a bar, a single couple sweetly tracing the floor. The melodies are lovely; the compositions stir moments of joy, melancholy, reverance and romance. The arrangements highlight Atisso's exquisite touch and timing and the slurry soulfulness of Cissokho's sax. Above all, the voices of Gomis and SidibÃ© (primarily the former) are subtle, passionate and blend beautifully.
