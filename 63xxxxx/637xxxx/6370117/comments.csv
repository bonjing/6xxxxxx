There is a folder called ""-CD1"" that you can just delete because it is ""Seitaka"" from ""F.I.D."", which is already included in the ""F.I.D."" folder.

There is also a file ""01-Ananga-Ranga.mp3"" that you can delete because it is included already in the ""Venereology"" folder.

The albums ""April 1992"" and ""Kamadhenu"" will be added soon on seperate torrents."
