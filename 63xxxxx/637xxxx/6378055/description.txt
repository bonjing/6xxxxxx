Paradiso is an international album from New Zealand soprano Hayley Westenra.

Paradiso was a collaboration with master Italian composer Ennio Morricone in 2010 and releasing from New Zealand on 18 April 2011 to all around the world.

Paradiso features new compositions written by Morricone for Westenra, as well as some of his best-known film compositions of the last 50 years.
