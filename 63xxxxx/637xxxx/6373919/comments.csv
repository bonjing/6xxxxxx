,Ultimaniac,2011-07-17T01:12Z,That'll teach me to read the comments before downloading...I spent about three days downloading this before finding out about the corrupt file...
,taarna23,2011-07-27T03:15Z,"Same here, I rarely download before reading comments, so of course, the one time I hit the magnet link from the search list... But yeah, r14 is incomplete, 5-ish mb instead of the 50 it should be."
