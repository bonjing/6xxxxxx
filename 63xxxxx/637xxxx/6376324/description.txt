This is a non-official collection of Radiolab episodes dating from may 2002 to june 2005 in mp3 format.

The episodes were downloaded from the episode archive at: 
http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes

Only the episodes in RealAudio format were downloaded. The audio files were then transcoded to mp3 and tagged properly with episode information from the web site. There are some near duplicates because the episodes have been aired multiple times, some with exactly the same content, in those case I have only kept the one with best sound quality. Also there are episodes with multiple 1 hour long parts where only the first part is available from the Radiolab archive.

Tip if using iTunes to sync to your iPod or iPhone:
1. Select all episodes
2. Right click and select "Get Info"
3. Go to the "Options" tab
4. Change Media Kind to Podcast
5. Change Remember position to Yes
6. Change Skip when shuffling to Yes
Now the episodes will behave as a regular podcast.
