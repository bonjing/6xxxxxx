RELEASE NOTES

Hydrophobia: Prophecy is the ultimate version of this jaw-dropping
action-adventure set onboard a floating city, where terrorists take
control and heroine Kate has to overcome her haunting childhood
memories to fight back using all her skills and expertise as a systems
engineer

2051. The world has become consumed by the ever rising tide of the
global population flood. Fertile land has been reclaimed by rising
oceans and expanding deserts, resulting in famine and poverty on an
unprecedented scale. Water is now mankind's most precious resource, and
conflict erupts wherever it flows

A new political and ideological struggle has arisen. On one side are
the Malthusians, who seek to control and reduce the global population
On the other side the Cornucopians, who want to find a technological
solution to feed it. As desperation turns to despair, extremists on
both sides are emerging

Only one buble of the old capitalist world survives. The Queen of the
World is the largest ship ever to grace the oceans, a colossal city at
sea where the wealthy elite live in exile from the chaos which
surrounds them. Onboard this stateless paradise the Five Founding
Fathers set about pursuing their Cornucopian research unimpeded

The contempt of the outside world is offset by NanoCell Corporation
one of the five, who promise to develop nano-technology to purify sea
water at the molecular level and make the deserts bloom with the food
of the world. But as they move closer to their goal, the bitterness of
fanatical Malthusians grows

The so called 'Neo Malthusians' timed their attack perfectly. 9.8
billion watched as they recast hope as hatred, following a prophecy to
commit global genocide; drowning the planet with blood as they slash
the worlds population to a mere half billion 'righteous souls'. A
prophecy they will soon find themselves in a position to fulfil
