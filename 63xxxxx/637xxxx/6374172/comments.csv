only thing I notice so far is that there's no audio for the 1st season at all.  other then that, it's a great quality torrent

kudos."

Either way, still a great upload, thx .BONE."

Just wanted to mention some differences between the original files and the ones included in this torrent for season 4:

ep 3: @080A6F1D: 8A (orig: 8B) -- visible at 15:23 in the video
ep 9: @0D524F1D: 50 (orig: 51)
ep 13: @116AAF1D: 36 (orgi: 37) -- visible at 33:49 in the video
ep 15: @1335EF1D: EC (orig: ED)
ep 21: @029CEF1D: 84 (orig: 85)
ep 23: @09292F1D: AA (orig: AB) -- visible at 17:19 in the video

The other seasons seem ok, except maybe for season 1 which I couldn't check"
