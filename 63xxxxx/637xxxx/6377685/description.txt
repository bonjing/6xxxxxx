Comhrac Bas is an \"outcome performance based system\" that allows you to control any confrontational situation presented to you. If you are in harms way then Comhrac Bas will demonstrate an easy to learn, effective way to get you out of danger in seconds. With Comhrac Bas we will teach you how to \"get off the line\" of an attack and \"off balance\" any aggressor who threatens you. You will improve your physcial mobility as well as gain a \"mindset\" which tranfoms your body image from that of a potential victim to one of \"strength and confidence.\" Comhrac Bas was developed so that an inexperienced learner with no \"martial art\" training can take advantage of learning how to defend themselves with outstanding results!
