,afkuser,2011-05-07T17:34Z,"Why settle for crap quality when there is already another one out there?

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5262949/Life_2009_BBC_BluRay_720p_x264

(I don't use 3.5"" floppies any more, so I don't need to download such small files)"
,lol69lol,2011-05-07T17:40Z,amazing!
,minus111,2011-05-07T18:17Z,"@afkuser If you dont want it we never asked you to talk,we dont want to keep a freaking 17-18 gb as few video files in our HDDs or external HDDs!
Now days people like smaller but they also want it better!
This is a combination of both!!!"
,maraizen,2011-05-07T18:31Z,"@afkuser 

Yify is darling of mass. Who will download 141.12 GiB which u uploaded. If u don't know how to compress the files with quality kindly sit quiet. It's not a crap quality."

,TPBWhore,2011-05-08T06:05Z,"It's obvious that afkuser is just a troll. It's also obvious that no one here gives two sh!ts about anything he has to say, so simply ignore him.

Some of us (afkuser being the exception) are intelligent enough to know that, depending on the compression method, it IS possible to retain excellent audio/video quality while reducing file size by a significant amount thus reducing the amount of time & bandwidth used."
,ranjitkgupta,2011-05-08T08:30Z,"@afkuser

GET WELL SOON!"
,hakuna_matata,2011-05-09T23:03Z,awesome
,Johnny24071982,2011-05-11T22:18Z,"These are some of the best quality torrents I've downloaded all thanks to YIFY. At least YIFY adds uploads almost everyday and informs us about it on Facebook. afkuser you need to learn something from YIFY. Size doesn't matter, it's what you do with it that counts. Keep it coming YIFY."
,schizo440,2011-05-12T20:30Z,Thank you so very much YIFY. 
,goku0989,2011-05-13T11:10Z,long life YIFY...MAY GOD BLESS UUUUUU
,Kb1325,2011-05-15T02:02Z,"@ afkuser...

We don't use floppy disks either.. it's called preference, i'd much rather download this than a 18GB rip... If you want to download this, go ahead, if not don't comment.

@tylr..

Some of this stuff is actually interesting... if you don't want it, don't comment. Sound like a good idea?"
,kooool,2011-06-06T07:53Z,from the screenshots it looks like a good compromise between quality and size.. thanks for all your hard work!
,kxm,2011-06-14T17:08Z,"thanks.. nice rip..

can you upload The Universe and The World at war in high resolution mkv? "
,honestlyidontknow,2011-06-17T12:43Z,"Thanks great stuff, the mkv and the mp4 have saved a lot of time and space on these channels with not a lot of loss of quality..."
,projectxsmoke,2011-07-17T21:53Z,"@afkuser 

shut the fuk up and respect the uploader its free so who gives a fuk about size m8 your a fukin idiot :)

keep up the good work YIFY ur the best out there i prefer the smaller files faster download and the quality is great just like a 2gb rip of it 

cheers and fuk u afkuser"
,whitecatz,2011-08-02T09:27Z,How does this compare to sailo1's? Comparison screenshots and technical specs would be good thanks!
,bumba2,2011-08-05T22:05Z,"thanks yifi....
ur awesome man,this rip is too good.....
its  guaranteed that  the quality of video is mind blowing.who cares of downloading a 18.6gb crap when 1 is getting almost d same quality in3.91gb.

moreover this is a must watch for nature lovers and who wants to know some extraordinary facts abt life.(HATS OFF!!BBC......)

i can assure u'll never regret for ur bandwidth by downloading this torrent.i am going to seed till 1:1.

LONG LIVE TPB...."
,fofo141,2011-08-11T01:17Z,You are actually five stars
,DickDickstein,2011-09-01T10:01Z,"Thanks bro. I for one am one that doesn't want to d/l 18 GB files :). I don't burn anything I just watch it once and I'm done. Too much to watch in one lifetime to watch things more than once right?

Anyways, thanks man. BBC always has better narrators. Not sure why American versions of this kind of stuff thinks we want to hear fucking Oprah, or Sygorney Weaver. Maybe the dumbshit Christians will listen to Oprah more which is good I guess. I prefer the Brit narrator always. Just way more clear and easy to listen to IMO. "
,foxboy23,2011-09-23T09:42Z,Awesome job man looks great and the size is easy yo hold on to. much better then keeping 18 GB of a file on my laptop. A+keep up the amazing work man.

,aviatsit,2011-10-24T04:14Z,"hi guys !!!
