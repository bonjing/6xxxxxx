[V],twentyforty,2011-05-06T19:46Z,"@puplone: OK. Clean slate. No more escapades, please. I am one of the guys who wrote hDOT a decade ago,  understand me...

Point being, I am in torrents by nature exposed to  kind of public scrutiny, but I am at least twice older than majority here, I encode from 1989., I am in torrents for seven years now, on TPB two - and there is no question I haven't answered at least hundredth times. 
Here would come my friends, some of them from way long back, and I know that repeating same answers over and over again whenever some new face pops-out and start giving advices, or ask to many questions Why-this-Why-that makes them sick, as myself.

I repeat, I am too long in this jazz, to old and too sick to refute or answer on everything, especially in way one may find appropriate. 

I use English, as language of communication - but I am not Englishman - I have my own metrics, measuring stick and definitely a short temper. If anybody doesn't like me or my work - is two clicks away from eternal bliss and happiness. 

I never understood why people visit places they don't like. Also - from what background came urge of many people I met - to force their opinion or their ways - on me. I never met anyone here, I owe nothing, to nobody, as other ""side"" should accept too and apply as their MO too.

So - enjoy the ride and please - behave. I know you can.

Wow for someone who use's english regularly to communicate... your english is, well, terrible. I'd say you got a long ways to go, I didn't understand anything you said in both those rants."
