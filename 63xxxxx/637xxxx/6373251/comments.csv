@redriding: Few more hours, my friend. Approx. 14:00 CET.

@DJkid90: I know you asked for 720p, but I must think on people with small allowances. Also, Gnomeo and Juliet was encoded day before and already on seeding server. Because you asked for BluRay encode - OR - DVDrip ( who cannot be above 480p anyhow) I guess that you wont be terribly disappointed."
,DMVIN,2011-05-07T10:23Z,oh thank so much for this :)
,DJkid90,2011-05-07T10:29Z,"no its alright buddy this will gonna work foe me like a charm

[V],twentyforty,2011-05-07T11:52Z,"@puplone: Never load 3 months old torrents, especially packs - and [quark] encodes are super tiny tawny encodes for people on dial-up. They never  seed. I cannot.

All formats (Particle physics: quarks are member of leptons) are explained once per day in long Header of TV pack torrent. Click on my screen-name then on last TV.Pack and read through."
