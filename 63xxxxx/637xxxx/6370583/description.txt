SHIFTER Richard Locke is a poet. He hasn't written much since Clare, the woman he was going to propose to, told him she wasn't in love with him anymore. Captain Jack Cordesman is investigating a series of murders in which the victims appear to have been partially eaten. So far the only evidence linking these murders are the red, female hairs found at the crime scenes and a bar napkin with one of Locke's poems scribbled on it. With a rundown mansion, priceless automobiles, and guest houses filled with brutalities the likes of which you'll never forget, Shifters is full of fun time gore.and monsters.
