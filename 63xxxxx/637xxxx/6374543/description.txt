Jane's Addiction
Ritual De Lo Habitual (1990)




Jane's Addiction were one of the most hotly pursued rock bands when they gained notice in Los Angeles in the mid-'80s, with record companies at their feet. Flamboyant frontman Perry Farrell, formerly of the band Psi Com, had an undeniable charisma and an interest in provocative art (he designed the band's album covers), and Jane's Addiction played a hybrid of rock music: metal with strains of punk, folk, and jazz. The quartet, comprised of Farrell, bassist Eric Avery, drummer Stephen Perkins, and guitarist Dave Navarro, had already released its debut album as well, in the form of a live recording from the Roxy in Hollywood. Finally, Warner Bros. won the bidding war and released Nothing's Shocking in 1988. The band's abrasive sound and aggressive attitude (typified by the nude sculpture on the cover) led to some resistance, but Jane's Addiction began to break through to an audience - the album spent 35 weeks on the charts.


Three Days is not just a song about a heroin-fueled weekend with two girls. it's a memorial of sorts to a girl that Perry loved, a girl who was a budding artist, who ODed before achieving her promise. yes, some of the lyrics are about one lost weekend, but it also commemorates everything about his lost friend ("we miss you, my dear Xiola..."). this theme was carried forth into Then She Did (the original title was Then She Died) and Perry addresses his dead friend in the last stanza, asking her to say hello to his own dead mother when she gets to heaven: "will you say hello to my ma, will you pay a visit to her, she was an artist just as you were, I'd have introduced you to her..." Three Days is like four distinct songs weaved together into one amazing masterpiece. it always carries enough power to justify its length, and it never gets dull.
