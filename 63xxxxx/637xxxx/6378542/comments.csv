 Sunday night was overcrowded, and The Borgias must be dropped - and according to what I've seen here and in past few weeks - it wont be terribly missed."
,DMVIN,2011-05-09T16:41Z,thanks for breakout kings 
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-09T17:04Z,The Borgias sucked raw eggs.
,jmac85,2011-05-09T18:12Z,Thanks for this pack. I watched the first four eps of 'Borgias' and wasn't terribly impressed. It's just too slow and not my style of show. Sorry I'm not grabbing GoT...I grabbed the 720p from BoB... [+1]
,Cavemann,2011-05-09T18:29Z,Thanks
,abj642,2011-05-09T18:44Z,thanks 20-40 for all your efforts
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-09T18:47Z,@jmac85:  388 MB is too much for people who need to save - and probably too close to 550 MB XviD. I did plenty of TV shows in 720p - but reason prevailed.
,t.trikiti,2011-05-09T20:55Z,thanks man! have a great rest of the day
,ladderman22,2011-05-09T21:51Z,tahnks 4 GOT ;)
,midge8,2011-05-10T00:01Z,Thanks for Breakout Kings and Game of Thrones
,believenu,2011-05-10T02:55Z,"thank you, seeding is sharing"
,cindal,2011-05-10T07:44Z,thank you so much for... well everything!
,jmac85,2011-05-10T12:36Z,"@20-40: Yes, the size is large for many...but sharing isn't required. My client is set to share 1.5x of all I download. So if I dl 200mb and upload it I'm still out 400mb. No offense, I know the quality of your rips/encodes is better than BoB's. I just think 720p on GoT is very nice."
