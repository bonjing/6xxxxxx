A TOUR OF HELL
Hell has become a sprawling metropolis where evil translates into order and monsters mate with the damned. Here Golems stand watch in smoking alleys, while gargoyles prowl the ledges of mile-high skyscrapers made of pulverized bone. Horror is harnessed as energy, and atrocity, torture, and murder are public law. And now Satan has discovered a method to bring little bits of his demented city to earth.
Cassie is the only woman in the world who has the power to enter this unspeakable domain. Will she succeed in foiling the most diabolical plot of all time? Or will she fail and be damned forever in the never-ending streets of the city of Hell?
