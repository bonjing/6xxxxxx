,Toxinus,2011-05-23T22:02Z,@ becuse: i just checked and it looks pretty much DVD and i'd give the quality V:7 and A:8

,bondoMaga,2011-05-25T00:03Z,"Toxinus what torrent ap do you use that allows you to d'load just the sample and not the entire package?

Older vuse aps allowed you to untick what you didn't want--but the current vuse install has no such selection option that I can find.

Thanx"
