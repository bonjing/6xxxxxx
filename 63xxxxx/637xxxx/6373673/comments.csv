Good to see you back on form!"
,grodudu271,2011-05-07T15:01Z,Thnks man. Fringe no longer has the same intensity as the 1st and 2nd season.Too much drama now.lol
,spiritualiste,2011-05-07T15:04Z,"Thanks a lot for this...+1...A10-V10...
Live Long and Prosper...
Spirit..."
,t.trikiti,2011-05-07T15:38Z,"excellent! thanks!

,the_shroud,2011-05-07T16:03Z,Thank you so so much
,hakuna_matata,2011-05-07T17:04Z,"Thanks 20-40

Great ... This torrent should reach the TOP100 :-)"
,DMVIN,2011-05-07T17:22Z,seriously I agree all should seed and make it beat eztv's game of thrones numbers
,silveroakleaf,2011-05-07T23:57Z,"I've got them already downloaded from you.  Hopefully, I can successfully contribute to seeding."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-08T01:44Z,"Seeding this.  How about a pack combining the first season of Endgame and the 3rd season of The Mentalist, when they get finished, as they seem to explore similar themes."
,dark_defender,2011-05-08T14:00Z,Thank you 20-40. Thanks !! Means a lot !!
,hakuna_matata,2011-05-08T19:43Z,"It would have gone to Top100 if the name has  ""Season"" in it. like the title should be like ""Fringe.Season.03.HDTV.H264.20-40"". Then its easily searchable, I generally search for TV Series name + Season to get the season torrent. Writing S03 is not common. so miss out."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-09T08:18Z,"Sure, ""S"" is always a mystery to some."
,davux,2011-05-12T09:25Z,"Thanks for all you uploads twentyforty. +1 to all of it :-) IMHO

I noticed that a lot of uploaders are doing encodes like you're doing now.. but for me YOU R D MAN ..


"
,davux,2011-05-12T09:26Z,"btw, my seed ratio for this upload is 1.718 and seeding.. :-)"
,hakuna_matata,2011-05-21T23:27Z,"No .. That Season makes it better to search to lamers and chances are that it will reach higher up in the ladder to top100 list. Fringe is a great series, and your encoding is top class. It shopuld be Top100 torrent not those stupid 8gb ones. I done like Xvid 350mb rips, when people can have the awesome 480p."
,hakuna_matata,2011-05-21T23:29Z,"sorry for typo .. done=don't, shopuld=should

point is .. why not this belongs in top100."
,LostAngel169,2011-06-09T22:49Z,"screens anyone? I got s2 from riddler, and the quality is... well, not so good..."

,koeperkop,2011-09-04T08:30Z,"[koeperkop]can you upload Heroes1-2-3-4-5 Complete 480p x264
i love heroes and all the others are to big i am waiting 8months now for a nother heroes just never comes down"
,laned130,2011-09-16T16:27Z,"@Hakuna Matata: Agreed! This torrent would be a lot healthier if it had been properly labelled and indexed. If you search ""Fringe S03"" then you get all the results: Fringe S03E01, Fringe S03E02, etc., but if you search Fringe Season 3 then it narrows your results better. If it had just been given keywords, it would have been better. Or a description. Or an IMDB link!
@twentyforty: Great torrent, and many thanks, but 20 seconds, and a little thought, would have made all the difference to our download speeds."
,laned130,2011-09-16T16:39Z,"Having said which, there are at least two people trying to give me over 800K, so it's not hanging around! Great seeding guys!"
,laned130,2011-09-17T13:21Z,"Having said which, I had two seeds trying to give me over 800K each, so it didn't hang about!

And the quality is excellent!"
,laned130,2011-09-17T13:22Z,Rofl - forgot I wrote that yesterday!
,hakuna_matata,2011-09-25T20:47Z,@laned130  Thanks for understanding Brother .. thats what I actually meant to say. you put it rightly. thanks. Hope more people find this torrent.
,koeperkop,2011-10-01T21:41Z,"CAN YOU GYUS GIVE US 800KBS AGAIN IAM TRYING TO DOWNLOAD THIS SUPER SHOW
THANK YOU IN ADVANCE"
,Early_Riser,2011-10-23T18:50Z,Thank you twentyforty for this. I had no problems finding the season and episodes I was looking for. I guess those that complain abut your description just like to complain. Great job and thanks again.
,FrostPeace,2011-10-24T21:58Z,"10/10, works with VLC, small filesize, what more could anyone possibly want? Thank you so much :]"
