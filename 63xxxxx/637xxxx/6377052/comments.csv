,HardcoreAndMore,2011-06-16T21:32Z,"Okay, It seems there is no Dutch subs for the first movie. But now my sound? When right clicking and searching for Audio. It finds nothing, And i've downloaded the whole pack ^^?(and also downloaded  (  http://cccp-project.net/  )"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-06-17T12:42Z,"HardcoreAndMore 
I realized that you're not able to... say thanks at least for the other 3 subs, because I missed one, oh God that's so bad. 
Grow up and fix your childish problems little trusted boy.
21 subs for 4 movies and nobody said a thanks. 
Show me one uploader who put so many subs in their HD torrents. Just one.
You know what, I won't spend hours any more on searching/synching your god damned subs. Do them yourselves. "
,Nirjoy,2011-06-24T22:20Z,thanx bro.. great upload :)
,MrLiquid,2011-07-04T22:49Z,Fantastic upload. The fact that you put all those subtitles in shows you're dedicated to quality. I will gladly seed this.
,Tuzazz,2011-07-12T04:02Z,grate upload who cares there is everything in English!!! Just enjoy ;]
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-07-13T23:07Z,"thx boiz & gils for appreciation and seeding.
I reccomend to use the mkvmerge 4.0.0 instead of the newer versions.
http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKVtoolnix/old-versions#download
more complexity & less troubles.
Always run the ac3 trough delaycut (  http://www.videohelp.com/tools/delaycut  )
& fix  before mux. cheers"

Thanks."
,Manorakis,2011-07-26T14:37Z,I also downloaded this torrent recently and i have no sound on media player classic and media player. Any ideas why the sound is disabled? :D
,samzeh,2011-08-04T05:07Z,uploaded about 2 tb nuw ;3 and the sound dosnt work so i use divx for image and VLC 4 sound
,Leosen,2011-08-20T00:43Z,"Looks good. Could use some more seeders though. Please, if you have downloaded these movies to 100%, make sure to seed so the rest of us may enjoy them too. And great job with all the subs. Even though i don't use/need subs, i know there are people that do, and i'm sure they appreciate it, even if they are a bunch of pussies that won't admit it."

,Wave_rider,2011-09-15T11:50Z,"a/v: 10/10
Uploader could have merged files for us, so we didn't have to merge (using MKVtoolnix) files ourselves. But thanks anyways. Good quality. +1"

,Dorge,2011-11-30T17:40Z,"Thanks mate, awesome quality V/A torrent
Seeding away! =]

Has anyone managed to play these in Divx or VLC player with audio and no subs? I used MKVmerge (for the first time, not sure what i was doing) managed to get audio in VLC but had subs aswel.

Works fine in Media player classic, but i'd prefer to use Divx or VLC.

Thanks again for the upload and any help"
,wtfwth,2011-12-13T21:56Z,http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net/ downloaded and installed made me able to play the english dts audio where the cccp package did not play or (show) the dts files... TY for the upload

,riojg,2012-04-14T17:36Z,"Awesome! Thank you so much! Unfortunately I'm having the same problem as paulomoreira4, no audio. I'm sure this has to be something I'm doing wrong. Does anyone have any tips for how I can get the audio to work in VLC? I'd appreciate any help! jetpantheravin@gmail.com"
,-Norcal-,2012-04-22T02:45Z,Cruisin' at 1mb/sec.  Not bad.... Lotta work went into the sub sync.  By what I can tell this torrent is a real gem. THANK YOU FF69
,fuall,2012-05-05T08:29Z,"Resident Evil 2002.mkv (video file):
01:40:21

Resident Evil 2002.English.dts (audio file):
01:36:53

Clearly the English DTS audio is from a different source than video, it came most likely from some speed-up 25fps PAL crap (since it is about 5% shorter than 23.976 film). Geez, dude...

Someone else please post info about the rest, as I didn't check the other films in this torrent (needed only the 1sr RE flick)."
,Tazadar3,2012-05-31T21:15Z,"atm 100-300kb/s down and 1MB/s up.
For some strange reason they have Resident Evil 1,2,3,4 boxset on dvd, but the BluRay boxset dont include the first film(so its 2,3 and 4). I know the first film is in bluray as well, but as far as i know and have read and researched in div forums, there aint a scandinavian release of it(not on bluray). Might explain why the audiofile is different from the video on the first movie.(to get the subs and audio).  All i have to say is, thx for this torrent and all the work you have put into it :)"
,jdizzle22,2012-06-19T20:04Z,"For anyone who can't get audio to work:
1.Download and install MKVmerge @ 
http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/
2.Run Program and under the ""Input"" tab select ""add"" and select BOTH the .mvk AND the .dts file. information about the files should then be displayed in the white box.
3. From the white box select the subtitles you would like by unchecking all other subtitle boxes. DO NOT uncheck the box for the audio or video files!!!!!
4.Start Muxing
5.DONE!!"
