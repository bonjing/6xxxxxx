I have had quite a few requests to re-up this series. I liked to do so earlier but did not have the old torrents to re-seed. Anyhow I will start posting them, each three volumes in one single torrent, except for vol 16 and 17 as I am seeding them. In the process of re-posting these, I have replaced duplicate songs with those that never made it to this series along with some bonus tracks. Hopefully a few more listeners will discover this popular series as well. Enjoy them people!
