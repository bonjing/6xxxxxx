,rstarsteve,2011-06-07T03:57Z,"Sounds is a little screwed. If you live in an apartment beware. The dialogue needs full volume, but when music or sound effects kick in, it full-freakin' blast!!!!!! TOO LOUD!!!!!!!!
Annoying to deal with"
,waynegacy,2011-10-15T13:14Z,"RStarSteve is correct that the music and certain parts are loud, but it's not a fault in this file, it's how the movie was originally made... this comment turned me off this download... just a heads up. You can read this review or others to see: http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie-critic-reviews/suspiria.1/"
