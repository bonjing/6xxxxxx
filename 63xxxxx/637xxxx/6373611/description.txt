  Four friends sruggling with life meet in the Maine woods for     
  their annual hunting trip. When a stranger stumbles in to their 
  camp disoriented mumbling things about lights in the sky the    
  four friends put in a struggle with a psychotic army colonel    
  and a being that has taken control of one of their minds.

  RIPPER NOTES:                                                   
                                                                  
  Ok so TWCiSO was faster than us... but does faster always mean  
  better? NO, their release has a bad cropping (6% off the        
  original aspect) and CD2 is oversized (you can't burn it        
  without overburning...)                                         
                                                                  
  Oh, and for suspicious minds, this rip was made from the retail 
  DVD. A small vob sample is included.                            
                                                                  
  Enjoy the movie!
