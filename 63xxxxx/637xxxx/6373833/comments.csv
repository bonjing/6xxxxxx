,LeoLeonardo,2011-05-08T13:12Z,"A great torrent for getting all the episodes of season 1 at the optimal quality. Great release, glad to see someone put this together so quickly!"
,HbAcolyte,2011-05-14T09:22Z,"I'm going to download this now, thanks for sharing :) Will definitely seed"
,arthasftl,2011-05-17T07:11Z,I think I speak for all my fellow Bronies when I say great torrent!!
,stuhp,2011-05-17T22:10Z,"Seems like some scenes are deleted in this collection, like in episode 23 - Cutie Mark Chronicles - there's a distinct part when kid Rainbow Dash licks her lips before the race.

Where did this collection come from?"
,stuhp,2011-05-17T22:15Z,"Actually I could be mistaken. I was under the impression that it took place during Fluttershy's cutiemark story. Will have to double check through youtube.

Great torrent, regardless :D"
,vincit_omnia_veritas,2011-05-22T19:22Z,@stuhp - Have you been able to find out for sure? I'd like to know :)
,ltamake,2011-05-31T08:59Z,"17 gigs? Must be good quality. ;P

Thanks for the upload. :)"
,davidfg5,2011-06-09T01:54Z,"@stuhp @vincit_omnia_veritas
I did a comparison to a different source, and did not notice anything missing. Remember that the start of the race is shown twice, once in Fluttershy's flashback, and again in Dash's. Dash's flashback is the one where she licks her lips, in Fluttershy's flashback Dash does not lick her lips."
,nabnew,2011-06-11T10:52Z,PLEASE SEED!!!
,AshArmy,2011-06-13T03:23Z,"Thanks, and that's all that can be said. Seeding like a pony."
,Alexnader78,2011-06-14T12:54Z,@davidfg5 thanks for the clear-up
,Alexnader78,2011-06-15T23:02Z,"Just wanted to add that this is a fantastic torrent, all episodes are there and in beautiful HD quality. Will seed for as long as possible."
,AnalLust,2011-06-17T07:20Z,What the dick why does it open in that movie maker thing?
,Akaen,2011-06-18T06:57Z,@AnalLust you need the VLC media player to watch mkv files.
,Skriox,2011-06-28T09:39Z,SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
,SoonDae,2011-06-30T18:26Z,"24fps and 5.1? Is this legit 5.1 or just matrixed? And if legit, where did you get such awesome quality?"
,matthew_rs7,2011-07-04T06:10Z,"I admit it, I like my little pony.

Thanks for making this torrent! sadly 17.4 GB is too large for me, so I will download them in sections of 5 episodes as time goes on so I don't chew up too much bandwidth."
,DaSpartan,2011-07-07T15:02Z,"Fantastic quality on these. And we don't even have to feel mildly guilty, since these are all free on Youtube anyway! :D"
,Thyrai,2011-07-21T09:20Z,I can't believe I'm downloading this...
,goombafan333,2011-07-25T02:34Z,My little pony my little pony...
,Dekrypted,2011-07-29T03:52Z,This is amazing quality. *Brohoof*
,matthew_rs7,2011-07-30T05:47Z,"Only problem is that it's too quiet. I am using these video files to make some MLP YouTube Poop. In the process I could take all the episodes and make their audio a proper volume, and encode them so they are still 720P, but much smaller in size."
,GPeas,2011-07-30T14:59Z,"How do you get rid of the washed out colors? The info file provided isn't very helpful. I've tried loading the ffdshow preference files, but no matter what video player I use (VLC, Media Player Classic, Windows Media Player) the colors stay the same. Specifically telling ffdshow to load when using those players makes no difference, either."
,RinTosaka,2011-08-11T21:17Z,"I just figured out how you can very easily fix the color saturation issue in VLC.

Go to:
Preferences -> Video
Uncheck ""Use hardware YUV->RGB conversions""

It should make a negligible difference in CPU usage; I only saw 5% more CPU usage on my measly Athlon 64 x2 at 1GHz!"
,RinTosaka,2011-08-11T21:20Z,"Take note that you still have to restart VLC after clicking the ""Save"" button for it to take effect."
,AsplosiveForce,2011-08-27T07:56Z,"None of the MLPFIM torrents are downloading for me...

D:"
,lemonsyay,2011-08-31T20:02Z,"Thanks RinTosaka that worked really well, but honestly I found it hard to tell if the colours were washed out unless it was compared to the same image with the fixed settings."
,phoenixlk27,2011-09-02T02:15Z,"Can't wait to marathon the whole season :) thanks for the upload, it's gonna be much better than youtube. And it'll give me something to do when internet isn't available to me..."
,Zurenriri,2011-09-06T00:49Z,"WMP users can do this to fix the saturation issues:
Right-click on screen > Enhancements > Video Settings. Then slide the Saturation bar (bottom left) until you find your sweet spot.
Here's an example of what it looks like: i.imgur.com/Df4wT.jpg"
,NeonVictorian,2011-09-19T19:56Z,ponies gonna pwn :3
,arsefacey,2011-10-07T16:44Z,"I'm having a bit of trouble with this torrent. This page says 119 seeders, but utorrent, bittorrent and bitcomet are all saying there aren't any seeds. All the proxy settings etc are set to no, and yesterday I was able to download other torrents fine. Couple of hours ago I was partway through downloading a torrent, which I canceled. Anyway, is someone able to help me with this?"
,arsefacey,2011-10-07T16:50Z,"Checked the trackers tab. 3 say ""UDP Tracker no response""
""http://tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce"" says ""Tracker connection error: 10061 No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it"""

,wiezimag,2011-11-10T16:32Z,"Torrent is awesome, but NOTHING OPENS THESE CRAPPY FILES. fu"
,StormDewleaf,2011-11-16T05:18Z,wiezimag: VLC player. It does just about everything.
,manolo12,2012-02-10T19:34Z,"Nice upload, currently downloading."
