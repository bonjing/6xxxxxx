,tcelt,2011-05-09T17:15Z,"Good work, man. Keep uploading it. Don's listen to lievenazerty.
I prefere to watch such great series in high quality. If lievenazerty can't afford himself a good large-screen HD TV and a couple of 4 TB mediastorages, it doesn't mean noboday else can. "
,lievenazerty,2011-05-09T17:52Z,"It's not about the HDTV, I download all my show 720p, but yeah storage capacity is the issue here, a 2TB nas station that's completely filled up makes me wonder how much I download :) As for don't listen to me, there are better compressions available, switching form MPEG2 to MKV would already be a HUGE win... just sayin' "

Thx alot!"
,KaLaNco69,2011-05-10T16:25Z,"""HighDefinition ' - Your welcome! I aim to please!

Not my cap, but Figured being such a popular show, there would be others out there who would also like to appreciate it in 1080i.....

About your comment on being well seeded, that's probably due to the popularity of the show, and the 380GB I initially uploaded on it LOLZ! My poor seedbox was hammering it out!"
