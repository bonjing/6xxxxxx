Celtic/Eastern folk fusion played on a menagerie of instruments such as bagpipes, hurdy gurdy, mandolin, violin, bass and tabla, with stunning vocals by Maya Preece.
The Tudor/Gypsy/Celtic style music has Scottish and Irish influences â€” you only have to look at the list of instruments that feature and you'll know it's something completely different. It's Folksy, magical and stirring and a genuine music adventure. If you want to bring out the hippy in you or recreate the feeling of the Seventies, Familiar Shores will wash you up on a musically-inspired journey. 

Dragonsfly mainly perform in venues and festivals around the South West of England, but have also developed a dedicated following in France and Sweden through playing festivals there too. 

Maya Preece is the lead vocalist and also responsible for the bagpipes, guitar, recorder and melodica; Daygan Robinson for the mandolin, Bouzouki and backing vocals; Tom Simenauer on Saxophone, flute, Rauschpferge, Hurdy Gurdy, bagpipes, keyboard (harpsichord) and more backing vocals; and Stephen 'Iccy' Slade for the bass and backing vocals. 

Other musicians who have contributed are Gem Quinn on drums and Archie Churchill-Moss (Melodeons). 

Pure Magic!
