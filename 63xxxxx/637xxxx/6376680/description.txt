Cat's Eyes
Cat's Eyes (2011)



Subverting the romance of â€˜60s girl group pop and male-female duos like Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra with plenty of psychedelic atmosphere, Catâ€™s Eyes features the Horrors' Faris Badwan and Canadian soprano Rachel Zeffira. The pairâ€™s first release, the Broken Glass EP, arrived in February 2011; soon after, they made their live debut at the Vatican, performing the song â€œI Know Itâ€™s Overâ€ in the Basilica during a Mass. Catâ€™s Eyes played their first full-fledged concert and issued the Face in the Crowd EP in March, a few weeks before their self-titled debut arrived.
