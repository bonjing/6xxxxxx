one of your files is ""nearly"" 480p, but still off, the other 3 are barely 360p. piss off man, label your torrents right."
,jhoff,2011-11-28T01:10Z,"Not the best quality. All this has going for it is convenience. 

A: 7 (Really low volume and I have mine turned up the whole way.)
V: 6 (Get's a little blurry at times.)"

,crash6192,2012-04-02T11:41Z,is this the unrated version?

,NuSeble,2012-05-04T07:05Z,"@tuggtugger2: WTF? you're complaining because you wanted the quick and smallest download to get four movies that you didn't do shit to get? Piss off yourself jackass. Perhaps if you didn't live in a basement, surrounded by Mountain Dew cans and wondering what your mommy will be making for your next snack it wouldn't matter if the label is wrong and you could appreciate those who make it possible for us to get this shit for free, Douche Bag!

Thank you for the UL ILPruny"
