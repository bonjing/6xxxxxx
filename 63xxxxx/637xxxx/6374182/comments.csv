,TobiaSSss,2011-05-07T18:49Z,I want seeders fast so i can play this game
,Bourqe,2011-05-07T19:05Z,Yup i need seeders :p
,jolle747,2011-05-07T20:04Z,"Why would you want to upload 2 of these ?
This seems like virus. The real minecraft client is about 30mb large. Remember to scan ppl!"
,TobiaSSss,2011-05-07T21:58Z,Yes thats true it is probaly a fake!
,SomberMoon,2011-05-07T22:11Z,"It's not a fake. It's MinecraftSP.exe (probably) It allows you to download by using the ""Force Update"" checkbox. It works, I use it myself, though I got it from a different torrent a few months ago. The MinecraftSP.exe file isn't big. It's just the normal client really. Put in any username and Force Update and it downloads the full game. I haven't had any problems with it, so I doubt you will."
,SomberMoon,2011-05-07T22:14Z,"Okay...I take most of that back. I don't know what else is in this, 'cause the MinecraftSP.exe file itself is only 679KB..."
,Propinquity,2011-05-08T00:30Z,You can get MinecraftSP to update? Anytime I do the game crashes after the intro screen.
,wtfminecraft,2011-06-13T13:49Z,theres a mess with that stupid loader it wont work
,kyliandeman,2011-09-01T23:35Z,"oke, guys listen, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS ******* FILE, 

this is one ************* virus in it! i downloaded it and than my computer shut down saying ''error kdjfbf''  and all kind of weird lists with numbers and letters and ik couldnt get it on no more, i ended up going back to the store were i bought it and they completely removed my harddrive and i had to buy a new one, which costed me a loooots of money, just warning you guys because this is not save!!
always look at the ''skull'' sign if youre downloading something on the piratebay!"
