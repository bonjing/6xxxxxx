The series is named after the lead character, a half-Icelandic half-Danish police officer named Halgrim Ã˜rn Hallgrimsson, nicknamed "Ã˜rnen" (the eagle). In the first episode, a new international criminal investigative unit is being formed under Thea Nellemann (Ghita NÃ¸rby), and Hallgrimsson (Jens Albinus) is persuaded to take the job as the lead investigator for the unit. He puts together a small team of experts in their fields. Their cases cross the borders between Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Russia and various other countries; and involve biker gangs, former Russian KGB, possible terrorist threats and international fraud. Throughout the series Hallgrimsson deals with recurring flashbacks and possibly post-traumatic stress from a childhood incident.

There are English, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish subs.
