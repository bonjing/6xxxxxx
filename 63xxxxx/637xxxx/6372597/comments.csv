It could be written by Son of Sam or John Wayne Gacy, who probably chat and compare notes with the author in hell at this very moment, just read this book and see what this Bohemian little corporal planned for the world... and did to the best of his ability, causing the deaths of 50 million people (and 8 million Germans) in the process. Sick leader of a bunch of sick pathetic losers, yesterday, today and tomorrow."

No matter how much people say that he was deranged and foolish, it doesn't change the fact that this man brought back Germany from ruins, stabilized economy and conquered half of Eurasia. Foolish and sick people can't even talk properly. Intelligent people, no matter how monstrous their actions are, are the only ones that able to do that. Keep in mind that almost every civilization and nation were built on blood of millions of innocent people. You can't change that fact."
