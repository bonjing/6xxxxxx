Thanks for your great torrents."
,amishbuggy116,2011-07-29T17:23Z,"Just to let you know, I installed it and I ended up reinstalling windows cause something got in and screwed things all up."
,Marcuskac96,2011-09-10T13:35Z,"amishbuggy116 It is cause you are a noob and dont know shit.This torrent works perfectly.you just need to install it , put the crack in the ""bin"" folder in the install directory and the mocha.lic file in the C/D:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing.And thats it!!"
,LikUranus,2011-11-03T08:20Z,"This works great, though instructions are not easy to understand.  

copy bsc.dll from crack and overwrite original

The 'mocha lic' file goes in ""C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing"", which is not quite clearly stated in the instructions.

This program creates no problems at all on my Win 7 64 system.  

You're welcome."
,KillerTheGuy,2011-12-19T15:49Z,Can you make a x32 version please?
,Skblzzzz,2012-01-19T21:57Z,"I downloaded the files and installed them but i can't find the ""C:\ProgramData\Imagineer Systems Ltd\Licensing"" to put the 'mocha lic' file in.
Can any body help me? "
,berkinovish,2012-02-26T10:32Z,On windows 7: go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Imagineer Systems Ltd\mocha Pro V2\bin
,DACreech,2012-03-27T22:33Z,"I hate to admit it but I guess I am a Noob.  I don't normally mess with software but could use this program.
I downloaded this and installed it.  How do I locate the bsc.dll (database file???) and what am I copying to replace what> This is a tad confusing.  And if you are bothered that I asked, please go help someone else.  We have to start somewhere."
,lurkxt,2012-03-31T18:47Z,Follow LikUranus' directions.  Change folder options to show hidden folders if you're having trouble finding them.
