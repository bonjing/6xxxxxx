no comment..."
,xDrTran,2011-05-10T10:27Z,"Quick and easy download as always, thanks.

In terms of the game, it's pretty good, love the water physics, only problem I found, is that it runs pretty badly, might just be my graphics card, but I can run other games way better, but either way, decent game."
,PcBiga,2011-05-10T10:33Z,"extremezone you are the best,i downloading your games 1 year,can you upload pc game Brink?"

,Xan1ty,2011-05-10T12:22Z,"Hello extremezone/SKIDROW, I have a question:

I don't know the correct technical words so I will just say it my way, did you do anything to this game? 
Like shrink any of the files, reducing quality of the graphics/cutscenes especially, to maybe shrink the file size of the overall game?

I ask this because the graphics of the actual game play are not PERFECT. The models are good, but the colouring/textures are slightly blurred.
In the actual cutscenes, it looks really blurred/fuzzy sort of thing.

I thought it was my graphic settings at first, because default the game wanted everything on medium. So I closed it down and turned everything to high and enabled everything, but its still the same.

Just wondering is the game supposed to be like this or is it something yourself did?


P.S

This game will be great. I Love these sort of games to those asking.
Uncharted, Assassins Creed etc... Love them!"

,Endetium,2011-05-12T20:07Z,"couldnt really get an actual opinion of the game seeing as i quit in around 20 mins and deleted due to the overwhelming amount of bugs and the ""walk 5 secs, cutscene, rinse and repeat"" style (eventhough you can skip them they still annoy the hell out of me). the game works, had no issues installing or starting and playing."
,ultrarapid,2011-05-12T23:32Z,good game  but very short

The major changes include:
Fix for some users experiencing cracking and popping audio
Camera tweaks and improvements
Performance improvements
Fix for some instances of audio effects cutting out or triggering out of sync
Fix for issue where users could not complete the back jump to the vent in the Plaza level
Added some extra checkpoints according to Darknet data

Fix for MAVI / CCTV not scanning items or opening doors which the FPS is 93+ (an additional fix for the same issue caused by low FPS is coming next)
More performance optimisations, particularly water spray to help improve FPS
Fixed a control lock up which would occur if you grabbed floating cover immediately after tapping zoom aim
Fixed leaderboard self rank showing the wrong listing if you happened to be at the bottom of a leaderboard page

there have been two updates addressing some of the major bugs that some of you are probably experiencing. As of yet a crack of these updates has not been released so do not download any of the several viruses pretending to be updates."
