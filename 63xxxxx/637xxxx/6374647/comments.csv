,com8472,2011-05-08T01:57Z,"@err0001

Can you pls explain to me why does this show drops trough the scene cracks so often? All other shows are never late, but this one almost every other time..."
,niceworkbuddy,2011-05-08T02:17Z,"Well done Err. This is my favourite political show, and after this weeks events I was dying to see it. EZTV hadn't uploaded it, and I downloaded two bullshit copies from bullshit sites, just in hope they were good. 
Thnx Err!"
,foxdrake,2011-05-08T02:25Z,"my guess is that this has something to do with hb0. they have been very aggressive lately with threatening to and having isps cut off service. Moreover, the success of gam3 0f thr0n3s hasn't helped matters any as Tim3 Warn3r wants its $."
,Dynablade,2011-05-08T02:26Z,"Made an account here so I could tell you thanks!! 

Sometimes people really drop the ball on Bill, hope that maybe you'll pick up the slack when that happens? Regardless, thanks again, was going somewhat crazy looking for it.."
[V],err0001,2011-05-08T02:45Z,I just want to say thanks here to a few people who really helped out with this. You know who you are.
,cindy25,2011-05-08T02:50Z,"thanks; EZTV and TVTeam only post scene releases and  the scene has been so lazy lately.

can u also post the Listener ? "
[V],err0001,2011-05-08T03:24Z,I don't think The Listener actually aired this week.
,BoonesFerry,2011-05-08T04:27Z,"Many thanks. 
I was so relieved to wake up and find this episode finally uploaded by a trusted member. "
,pazuzu9,2011-05-08T04:49Z,Much appreciated.
,S.Knight,2011-05-08T08:08Z,"I subscribe to HBO... but I missed it, and my cable's ON DEMAND sucks ass, so I was not going to wait days to see it... I often download to view at another time when I am busy... HBO gets $$ from me regardless... But I am never ever getting a DVR... Not with INTERNET and SEXY folks like my good friends at the pirate bay! I think torrents are good for business."
,BardusEtPhilosophus,2011-05-08T08:54Z,"I can confirm it's the real thing and the quality is fantastic!Hope your lap is heavy with heads, err0001!"

,foxdrake,2011-05-08T20:50Z,"@ s.knight 

noticed how hb0 launched a new on demand service via the web called go hb0. to end the i subscribe but missed it so i need torrents - no you don't if you subscribe go to ""go hb0"" and watch it there.

they sent out a ton of DMCA emails last week...it was my guess that's why Maher went away."
,cindy25,2011-05-09T08:08Z,"supposedly Fox asia has Listener eps 212 and 213 on today. 

but Wiki has these as May 17 and 24"
,cindy25,2011-05-09T09:01Z,pulled from the schedule here also.  
[T],geogaddi000,2011-05-10T12:40Z,err - were you able to capture the Piers Morgan / Michael Moore interview?
,robert53,2011-05-10T17:38Z,"Hey err0001
do you know anything about THE LISTENER s01e11? Is it aired yet?
thanx for all hard work!"
,cindy25,2011-05-11T03:16Z,"Listener was pulled from the schedule in Canada, to make room for Flashpoint replays. but 211-213 will air on Fox Europe 5/10-5/24; 211 is already showing up on some private sites. "
