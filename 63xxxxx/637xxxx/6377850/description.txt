John Cougar Mellencamp - Pink Houses [promo].VOB


HQ rare promo music video. "Pink Houses" is a song written and sung by John Cougar Mellencamp. It was released on the 1983 album Uh-Huh on Riva Records. It reached #8 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in early 1984. "Pink Houses" was ranked #439 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

Recorded in a farmhouse in Brownstown, Indiana, the song was inspired when Mellencamp was driving along an overpass on the way home to Bloomington, Indiana from the Indianapolis airport. There was an old black man sitting outside his little pink shotgun house with his cat in his arms, completely unperturbed by the traffic speeding along the highway in his front yard. â€œHe waved, and I waved back,â€ Mellencamp said in an interview with Rolling Stone. â€œThat's how 'Pink Houses' started.â€

The "young man in a t-shirt" segment was shot in Little York at the former Moody Grocery (among other proprietors) - it's now (2010) the local Masonic lodge.
