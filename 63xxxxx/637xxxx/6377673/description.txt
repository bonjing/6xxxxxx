thx mate

Encode:
got this great new amazing full line right when the russian bluray popped up, timing couldnt be more perfect.
The Bluray has a very good quality, better than most of some R1 Blurays.
I synced the audio back to my blurayvideo "lipsync" you know me, it will be lipsync and entered it back into the russian 5.1 track which i cleaned of the russian voice.
Finally a damned good version.
GET IT!

Like always my audio will fit on any Bluray Direct-Encode.
