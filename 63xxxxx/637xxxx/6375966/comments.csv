Thanks a lot for this masterpiece...its not only a horror movie,its overall a well-executed piece of cinema(not equalled in anyway by today's crap horror/gore fest)...this is a Brrip...much appreciated....still I'll say the the atmosphere of this movie is best captured in that rugged,not so refined print of the good old VHS or a normal dvdrip...thanks again...!!"
