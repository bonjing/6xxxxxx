â€œ This is an afternoon studio session between George Harrison, Bob Dylan and some friends at Columbia Studio B (NYC) on May 1, 1970 while Bob was drumming up material for his New Morning project. The sound quality is absolutely perfect in every respect. There are a few remarkable performances here, particularly Da-Doo-Run Run (Bob & George duet), the Everly Brothers' classic All I Have To Do Is Dream, Song To Woody, and the Beatles' Yesterday (which is hard to believe he actually sang!) Overall, it's a very enjoyable way to spend an hour. â€
