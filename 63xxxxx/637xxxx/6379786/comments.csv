1) file.id.diz
2) laxity.nfo
3) Read Me.txt
4) lxx426m0.zip
5) lxx426m1.zip
6) lxx426m2.zip
7) lxx426m3.zip
8) lxx426m4.zip
9) lxx426m5.zip
10) lxx426m6.zip
These are probably stupid questions, but:
1) The contents of the zip files seem to be duplicates.
2) Where do I find the executable installer file?"
[V],scene4all,2011-05-12T03:49Z,"The files aren't duplicate, extract lxx426m0.zip, lxx426m1.zip and so on to a separate folder then in the folder you should have more zip files, extract one and you should have the exe and patch."
