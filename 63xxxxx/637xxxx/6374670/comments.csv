Absolutely agree with ya bro...I saw this at a double feature drive-in with Colossus, The Forbin Project and was mesmerized..

I think I watched about 20 minutes of that new one and kicked it to the curb.  Some movies should never be copied...

Enjoy all!!"

,axo666,2012-01-18T18:36Z,"Aspect ratio is wrong (2.80:1 when it should be 2.20:1).
Image quality is fuzzy and sound is tinny, as should be expected from a video bitrate of 656 Kbps and an audio bitrate of 80 Kbps...
I'm once again bewildered by the fact that of all these folks who praise this release nobody seems to have noticed these flaws...

I'm thinking that most of these people simply appreciate this for what it is and do not worry so much about it....;)  Thanks for your input.

Enjoy!"
