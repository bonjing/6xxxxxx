Well, does this work for the original wow from blizzard? i have gone to stepp 5 then the zygor guide do not appear on character screen what do i do?

have you ever used addons in wow before?

instructions are clear, install these folders into the addons folder for your copy of wow log into your wow account before you select your character there will be a button says addons click that enable zygor guides and talent advisor then hit enable all and load out of date and then hit ok then select your character and enjoy"
,Coraxar,2011-05-22T02:27Z,"Is this safe to use? Does Blizzard allow them, and is there any risk for keylogger or similar? (Yes I have authenticator, just checking)."
,Etarip_o0,2011-05-22T13:26Z,"@Coraxar

Yes its safe, it uses files that cannot be executed outside wow. and inside wow its just commands that cannot be sent over internet. addons can contain web adresses but you have to open them in regular browser etc. and blizzard allows Zygor. its safe :)

btw there is a new update of zygor now please put it here for download :)"
