If it is for PC, cn it be installed on an AMD system?"
,hish123,2011-05-16T22:56Z,When I open the iso in finder to mount it. The iso mounts but it appears blank. Has anyone been able to install this succesfully? All I get is a blank iso.
,dougcjohn,2011-05-27T15:11Z,"After successful download and successfully creating an ISO from 39 RAR files, with indicated size over 3 Gig... I mount ISO and it's Blank. Using BURN, I created a DVD from ISO... it too mounts but is Blank. "

,kma1,2011-06-19T02:56Z,"@Machiavelli1 - Your screenshots are clearly indicating that the characters are too long and cannot exceed X amount of characters. Try the Extract To option and give a new folder name, feel free to try the Extract Here option first.....

@dougcjohn - I will assume you burned in Windows....the contents sometimes show blank because the ISO should be based on HFS file system (could be hybrid ISO with ISO9660 and HFS). If you use a program like UltraISO you will see the contents, or even MacDrive. 

@hish123 - Same as above (dougcjohn); if you're mounting in Windows there's a high chance you won't see the contents. Use MacDrive and you should see whatever it is you're looking for. 

*Remember to burn DVD at lowest speed (recommended 2x if available or 4x). 

****Great torrent webchella****

,kma1,2011-06-19T12:08Z,"@Machiavelli1 - Allow me to apologize and correct myself. After some thought it occured to me that you might be right....so I downloaded this torrent to see what problem you were having. Indeed you were right, it would not extract no matter which of the options you chose - use 7zip to unzip instead of WinRAR, extracted it should come out to about 4,588,544KB but will show that it's 4.37GB. Mounted with UltraISO....the label is Hazard_10.6.6. Hopefully you hadn't deleted the torrent download yet :)"
,Machiavelli1,2011-06-21T13:30Z,"kma1 tnx for this , but already deleted and im using hazard 10.6.6 ! :) TNX again ! :)"
,furious_D1234,2011-06-24T13:56Z,"I downloaded this and like other users the ISO appeared to be empty. I tried it in windows and the install files were there. I managed to get the loader started (by changing the startup disk in windows) and I got the warning ""this is a windows intel install, don't install on a mac!""

So, THIS IS NOT FOR MAC COMPUTERS, THIS IS A PC INTEL INSTALL DISK.

What a waste of time!"
,AndyRixon,2011-09-30T16:01Z,"If you are having issues extracting this, try renaming every part, including the file inside to something smaller, or you can try extracting to your C drives root (Easiest Option), it worked for me."
,Kaqanikudc,2011-10-11T13:47Z,"rar can not be extracted, just that we come within the rar and click on the iso, and burn CD's just do us, or you do not overdo bother at all because I wanted to make extract, but not made ​​there ... !"
,Kaqanikudc,2011-10-11T17:19Z,"not working ! do not download...!
do not waste time in vain"
