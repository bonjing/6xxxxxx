The Cars
Move Like This (2011)



This title will be released on May 10, 2011.




Move Like This, The Carsâ€™ first album of new music in many years, is a vibrant and ingenious collection that expertly extends their already extraordinary canon. Retooling innovative art rock, sleek New Wave, and punchy power pop in their own idiosyncratic image, The Carsâ€™groundbreaking sonic approach continues to influence artists and airwaves today. Singer/guitarist Ric Ocasek emerged as a master songwriter with his enigmatic integration of evocative, beat inspired lyricism with radioâ€friendly hooks and harmonies, fueling a multiâ€platinum body of work that includes such indisputable masterpieces as 1978â€™s selfâ€titled debut and 1984â€™s blockbuster Heartbeat City.


Blondie may have had a string of number one hits and Talking Heads may have won the hearts of the critics, but the Cars were the most successful American new wave band to emerge in the late '70s. With its sleek, mechanical pop/rock, the band racked up a string of platinum albums and Top 40 singles that made it one of the most popular American rock & roll bands of the late '70s and early '80s. While they were more commercially oriented than their New York peers, the Cars were nevertheless inspired by proto-punk, garage rock, and bubblegum pop. The difference was in packaging. Where their peers were as equally inspired by art as music, the Cars were strictly a rock & roll band, and while their music occasionally sounded clipped and distant, they had enough attitude to cross over to album rock radio, which is where they made their name. Nevertheless, the Cars remained a new wave band, picking up cues from the Velvet Underground, David Bowie, and Roxy Music. Ric Ocasek and Ben Orr's vocals uncannily recalled Lou Reed's deadpan delivery, while the band's insistent, rhythmic pulse was reminiscent of Berlin-era Iggy Pop. Furthermore, the Cars followed Roxy Music's lead regarding LP cover art, in their case having artist Alberto Vargas design a sexy pinup-style illustration for the cover of their sophomore album, Candy-O. Similar cover art remained the Cars' primary visual attraction until 1984, when the group made a series of striking videos to accompany the singles from Heartbeat City. The videos for 'You Might Think,' 'Magic,' and 'Drive' became MTV staples, sending the Cars to near-superstar status. Instead of following through with their success, the Cars slowly faded away, quietly breaking up after releasing one final album in 1987.

Move Like This reveals The Cars to be as creatively progressive and melodically poptastic as ever. Songs like 'Blue Tip' and 'Free' are invigorating and imaginatively wrought, with all the trademark elements in place, from Ocasekâ€™s sardonic, manâ€machine vocalizing and Greg Hawkesâ€™ swirling synths to Elliot Eastonâ€™s turboâ€charged riffing and David Robinsonâ€™s popâ€motorik beats. Brimming with confidence and imaginative energy, Move Like This boasts all the vitality and dynamism of a truly great rock â€˜nâ€™ roll band operating at the peak of their considerable power.
