I have downloaded several games lately that didn't work when burnt to disc. Been told I need to fix them with abgx360 before I can burn & play them.
Please can you tell me if I need to do anything to this game or can I just burn to Disc as it is?"
,nikolai1uno,2011-05-07T02:56Z,thanks will seed
,abernick00,2011-05-07T03:12Z,"download this game,,, it usually comes in ISO or RAR format... if RAR, use WinRar or another prog to open and drag and drop ISO file to a folder... then when you have it in .ISO format, run through abgx360, but make sure you have all the wave updates you need, you can get them on here, i believe there are 10 or 11 of em... if you dont have the abgx updates then download them, and run the files that come with that to update abgx program. Open abgx, I usually goto ""autofix"" and change top bar to level 3... run and make sure all is yellow or green.  then use Imgburn and use ""write image file to disc"". then goto the folder where you ISO's are... there should be a .dvd file named the same as your ISO you want to burn, only AFTER running ISO through abgx. select .dvd file and burn to Verbatim dual layer, if not Verbatim use what works for your burner, i find verbatims are the best. make sure you have the latest firmware on your xbox 360 disc drive and it should run! good luck"
,abernick00,2011-05-07T03:17Z,"to pickled_egg
    sorry, wanted to add one more thing... in between changing the bar in abgx from level two to level 3 and burning, make sure you select the ISO you want to burn at the top, THEN run the program... 
  have you modded your 360? some ppl come on here and think you can just put a burned disc in a normal 360 and play it... not true, you need to have someone who knows what they are doing change the firmware on your drive, to the latest, LT+ i believe for most new 360's.... "

Yes I have had my 360 Flashed. I'm not quite that daft LOL
I have had a flashed 360 a long time ago but back then I just downloaded, burned to disc & all was fine. But got banned when I didn't upgrade my flash. Now got new 360 with LT+ & suddenly found things have changed & most games didn't work when I burned them :( 
Thanks for all the info. I think I'll be fine now :)

Note... I use ""Infiniti 360"" disc's. (used to use ""Verbatim"" but found that sometimes the disc degrades with time & stop loading, 'Get dirty disc error' but I have ""Infiniti 360"" disc's that I wrote in 2007 & all still work fine)"

,stadion2,2011-05-13T18:12Z,"I have a big problem. Till today I always used wave patcher to change wave when ive downloaded xbox game, always to wave3, onetime i tried to play wave4 but didnt worked. After a long time, I once again downloaded xbox game - this game - and did what i always did, change wave to wave3 and burned it. When ive putted fresh burned dvd into xbox an update started that later changed my dashboard to newst looking one - with kineckt, then ive started game and before it can be started it tells me that i need to update in order to play this game, and when i say OK, it starts to extract update and then suddenly, ""it cant read from disc, is unreadable and console resets"". What has happened after all this months, has something changed that i cant play new games anymore? Any help to this? What is this AP 2.5 ..is this game protected or do i need to change my firmware? its 2-3 year old firmware, still from previous owner ..never had any problems till this game. :S DVD is burned nicely, no scratches"
,dogface72,2011-05-13T18:51Z,"That is really strange about the PC version.  The XBOX, PS3, DS, and PSP versions all got released first.  Not sure if I've ever seen that before.  Ooh, maybe Lego Pirates PC is the fabled uncrackable game!!... yeah, prob not."

,allex_torris,2012-01-21T15:03Z,"@slipsen10 - I have the same problem as your one. My xbox is updated to LT 3.0, and I first take the game through abgx 1.0.6 and then I burn it ... after I finish the disc I put it in the console and says that I have to clean the disc or restart the console ... any sugestions?"
