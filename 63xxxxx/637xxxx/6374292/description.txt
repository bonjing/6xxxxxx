Directed by Goran Dukic. 

Starring Patrick Fugit, Shannyn Sossamon, Tom Waits, Will Arnett, Leslie Bibb. 

A film set in a strange afterlife way station that has been reserved for people who have committed suicide.

NOTE: One of my personal best; weird, strange, phantasmagoric movie - but I love it.
