,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-08T00:38Z,Saw this several years ago specifically because it had Shannyn Sossamon in it.  You're right--it IS quirky and weird--but worth watching all the same.

[V],twentyforty,2011-05-08T12:27Z,"@peeyoosh: For extremely small-sized encodes from time to time look into TV packs. I stopped to make stand-alone torrents for those, because people on slow connections or with tight budget never seed. [quark] was abandoned because of that - it was publicly announced here a year ago (and you are new here).

 Btw - ALL my encodes, even 720p or 1080p are small-sized encodes. Maybe not the smallest, maybe not the best - but twas never goal I pursued.

 Also - Handheld compatibility (such as here - 360p) has a price."
