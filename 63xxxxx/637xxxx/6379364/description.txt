ITV Perspectives The Pitmen Painters HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

Robson Green, the son and grandson of miners, returns to his Northumberland roots to explore the true story of the group of pitmen who gathered together in 1934 for an art appreciation class and subsequently became celebrated artists themselves. It is this story which also inspired playwright Lee Hall, author of Billy Elliot, to write his recent stage hit, The Pitmen Painters. The miners set out to capture the everyday lives of their communities, whether it was hewing at the coalface or peering into the kitchen where wives baked bread.
