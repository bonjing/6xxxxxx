,staticx106,2011-05-14T04:29Z,The video quality for this upload is very poor it looks like up-scaled dvd 
,mkvluv,2011-05-14T04:43Z,everyone's upload is labeled r5 rip. this is most likely a r5 dvd upscale. don't waste your time.
,cptLAGER,2011-05-19T16:54Z,"Do not recommend this one, the quality is sub-par and the video stops at random frames."
,Krabaman,2011-05-25T09:35Z,Great quality!!!!!!!!!!
,jenchai,2011-06-01T07:02Z,"From the comments below, it looks like RC. Why  couldnt you put RC when its not proper Bluray release.

Thats how it should be :


The Lincoln Lawyer (2011) RC 1080p MKV AC3 NLSubs DMT"
