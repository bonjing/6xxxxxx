                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Gordon's Great Escape sees Gordon traveling to India to learn more about      
 Indian cuisine. The second series saw him travelling to South East Asia.      
                                                                               
 Chef Gordon Ramsay embarks on another culinary quest, this time to learn how  
 to cook the dishes of south-east Asia. Starting in Cambodia, he samples       
 delicacies including fried tarantula, stuffed frog and raw duck eggs, and his 
 journey across the country takes him to a tribal wedding feast and a cookery  
 school in Phnom Penh. The visit concludes with him preparing a traditional    
 banquet for the nation's royal family, with help from a talented student      
                                 Enjoy!
