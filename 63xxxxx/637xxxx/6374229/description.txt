Call of duty: Black Ops Escalation Map Pack for non JTAGed Xbox 360.

Tutorial for Zombies (Call of the Dead)

You first need to download the modded profile (Prince of Crack) Profile from: 



1. On the dashboard, sign into Your profile on controller 1.
2. Grab your second controller and sign into the modded profile.
3. Start the game
4. Sign out of the modded profile when the intro videos are on (just sign out straight away)
5. You're ready to play zombies.

Tutorial for Multiplayer (Complicated but easy once mastered)

1. YOU MUST ENABLE BOOT TO MULTIPLAYER BY GOING TO THE MULTIPLAYER MENU, THEN OPTIONS, THEN ENABLE THE OPTION THAT SAYS SOMETHING LIKE BOOT TO MULTIPLAYER.
2. You then need to repeat steps 1 and 2 in the multiplayer tutorial.
3. This is the tricky part, you need to prepare to sign out from controller 2, to enable you to sign out exactly when you see 'Call of Duty' in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.
4. If it has worked, you should now be able to play the new maps.
