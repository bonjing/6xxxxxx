,dumbasstheives,2011-05-10T00:00Z,"So Mr Scenebalance, you post the nfo which shows that it should be 1400mb yet you only upload the first 700. Way to go idiot! Your incompentence makes the group who did the capping look bad. No wonder the scene hates that p2p people like us get access to their files."
