,Rapier_Wit,2011-05-08T18:51Z,"Works like a charm. Use Little Snitch or similar to make sure it never calls home though. I lost the use of Toast 10 through this. Thanks Stun, nice one. "
,chandie,2011-05-14T22:38Z,works great! cheers
,regressiveparty,2011-05-24T04:37Z,"Booo. Are you f*in serious? No keygen no crack - it just asks for a serial code. No instructions even?

Don't download this is worthless. Thanks ""Team Hot"" your torrent blows"
,telvet,2011-05-24T17:06Z,"Thanks for this. 
@regressive: dude :) there are 77 SE and 26 LE for this already. Doesn't it occur to you for a second that you may be doing something wrong? :) Check the nfo file!"
,winealot,2011-06-01T21:01Z,"Hey Stun - I'm new to bit torrents. Program DL fine, but how do you open nfo file for the serial? Thanks for the torrent!"
,Shunnabunich,2011-06-05T17:47Z,"@winealot: NFO files are plain text, so although your Mac doesn't know it and thus doesn't give you any ""open with"" options, pretty much any text editor (i.e. TextEdit) can be used to open the file."
,AardvarkFirefly,2011-06-05T22:40Z,"regressiveparty:

I have never seen a more immediately ignorant response to a faultless upload.  You give Mac users a poor reputation with your selfish and small-minded reaction to a generous uploader; just because you are also completely ignorant of many sources for serials available to us doesn't mean WE don't know how to help ourselves, versus your ""I am helpless AND ignorant and fault YOU for my shortcomings"".  Own your own problems and stop playing the victim like a spoiled girl.  It reminds me of my sister."
,Fyeguy12,2011-06-08T07:35Z,"Ok idk if im doing something wrong, I havnt been doing this too long but all I have is all text files and one movie file and are almost all 15 MB. Am I doing something wrong?"
,MoonDookie,2011-06-18T00:43Z,"i second that, what AardvarkFirefly said to the N0OB= regressiveparty grow a brain...;O) "
,srlucino,2011-06-29T07:46Z,the serial number is GS-X6MCP-VYL48-3P57V
,geekoid,2011-06-29T17:15Z,"Yup, it appears most of the Mac users complaining have never heard of RAR files or how to open an NFO file.  If you're going to use files provided by the torrent scene, at least find out how to open them before complaining about how stupid you are.

Thanks, MAFIAA. for your flawless torrent."
,goofyfoot,2011-07-09T18:46Z,Many thanks MAFIAA - superb upload... seed on dudes :D
,sinx5,2011-07-11T23:51Z,"Thanks a lot, and it works as advertised :)."
,Damen96,2011-07-26T13:28Z,Thanx for it man...hey.. and btw i newly gotta mac.. so can sum one tell me how to actually install this! :P than
,udaiveer,2011-08-03T00:58Z,"WHY THE SERIAL IS MISSING @winealot @srlucino
just a silly mistake... i made,
If u extract all the rar files, into a DMG,
then most likely u will delete the far files.
BEWARE NOT TO DELETE THE .nfo. That HAS THE SERIAL NUMBER. ;-]]]
n i think i'm smart.
HEY @winealot @http://thepiratebay.org/user/winealot/answer
THANKS @srlucino

,udaiveer,2011-08-03T01:05Z,"@regressiveparty.

,DarkOpus,2011-08-11T06:49Z,"Hey guys, I need some help here. Once I've downloaded the torrent all I have is a load of files numbered like h-rtt1102.r21 (the number after the 'r' goes from 00 to 25), an 'nfo' file and an 'sfv' file. 

I've opened the 'nfo' which has the serial number, but no instructions about what to do with the other files. I also have a file called h-rtt1102.rar which, when extracted, creates an empty folder of the same name. Can someone help?"
,MT95PB,2011-08-11T07:32Z,"@DarkOpus - Just download ""StuffIt Expander"" from the Mac App Store, free of charge, and double click the ""h-rtt1102.rar"" file - It should automatically open in ""StuffIt Expander"" and create a .dmg file called ""h-rtt1102.dmg"" in the ""Roxio.Toast.Titanium.v11.0.2.MAC.OSX-HOTiSO"" folder. Hope this was helpful!"
,DarkOpus,2011-08-11T09:32Z,"@MT95PB Thanks! That worked a treat! I wonder why Archive Utility was creating an empty folder from the .rar file... doesn't matter now, I've set Stuffit Expander as the default for .rar files. Once more, thanks for your help, much appreciated. :-) "
,Ashengar,2011-08-14T00:33Z,"I extracted the files. Opened the dmg. file. Installed the program.  But when i try to open toast titanium it says ""You cannot open the application âToast Titaniumâ because it is not supported on this architecture."" Im new with macs so I'm pretty clueless here. Any suggestions?"

,Funkybeatzzzz,2011-08-28T18:24Z,Is anyone else having trouble with Disc Cover?  Mine freezes while uploading.  I've already uninstalled and reinstalled.  Help will be appreciated.
,Regnaloube,2011-08-28T20:47Z,"Would anyone know why I do not get any sound when I convert the files into DVD format? There is sound if I watch the files on iMAC, but none when I make images or burn them with Toast 11. Thanks"
,Regnaloube,2011-08-29T22:55Z,Found the answer in Suprbay FAQ tutorial.  Audio codec software needed.  Recommended site: http://perian.org/

,uNUTZbro,2011-12-17T11:35Z,"Can someone please help me? I'm still new with Mac as I only got a Macbook Pro recently. I'm trying to open the files with Stuffit Expander that I downloaded from the App Store but whenever I try to open it it says ""A failure has occurred. The structure of the archive is damaged."" and then Stuffit Expander quits unexpectedly. Can someone please help me?"
,jackflash,2011-12-20T14:02Z,"@uNUTZbro:
This upload is in a rar archive.  I don't know if StuffIt can unrar those.  I use a free program called UnRarX.  You should be able to find it easily.  Then just double-click on the first file of the archive, it will put them all together for you."

,Luc1dity,2012-05-06T08:31Z,"For a while last year, I had trouble finding a good LS torrent, so I did some Googling around. You guys should look into a thing called Radio Silence. I use it now (hard drive failure, so I was looking into getting all my old apps back) and it works like a charm. It's free, so you don't have to worry about it phoning home."
