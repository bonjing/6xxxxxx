Befriend and Betray

Police informant Alex Caine (Tim Rozon) infiltrates a ruthless gang and is tasked with moving their heroin into Eastern Canada. Complicating matters is Alex's girlfriend, Melanie (Christina Horne), who has no idea that he's agreed to work with the police. Tom Jackson (North of 60) is probably the best known actor in this video.

The pilot is written by Michael Amo and is based on the book "Befriend and Betray" by Alex Caine. It is unclear whether it has been picked up as a series. It aired on Showcase Canada on April 30, 2011.
