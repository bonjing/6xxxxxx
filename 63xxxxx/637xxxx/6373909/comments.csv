,Lunar_Knight,2011-05-09T07:52Z,"If the screen shots aren't working, try just coping the link itself into your browser. Image Shack are being wankers and saying The Bay violates their ToS."

seriously dude, i applaud your efforts to bring us all (who are to cheap to go see these movies in the theaters or buy the DVD when it comes out) these fine movies...but you got to leave the camera still. treat it like the plague and don't touch it...lol

,StoopidMerekat,2011-06-03T09:11Z,"Was downloading at over 2mb/s for the whole time. Decent quality, crappy audio."
,StoopidMerekat,2011-06-03T09:11Z,"That's why you get peerblock, and only keep it long enough to watch it."
,nautica002,2011-06-19T23:28Z,"movie is clear- ""screen shots are in the descrip."", sound is VERY clear, movie cut off at the sides.20%.not in the beggining-THE ENTIRE MOVIE.subtitles cut off when peeps speak spanish. if it wasnt for that, i give it 9.5 out of 10.but its free,watch if u cant wait.i saw in the theatre anyway.=P"
,Dlea,2011-06-20T22:37Z,Only 'bout 35-40% of the left side of the screen is even the frame A/7 V/2. Not very good even for a drunken cam!
