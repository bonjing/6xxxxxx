Formula One 2011 Season Turkey Quali(Torrent)

This is NOT meant to be a dig, but the only person that is being generous in providing coverage of F1 this 

year, is now only providing it only in HD. PLEASE do not think of me badly, but I live in Thailand where there 

is the worst provision of the internet of anywhere I know. The quickest speeds are (supposed to be) 6 Mb! I am 

lucky to get 450 Kb - indeed - normally around 80 - 180 Kb! So, HD files, at more than 3 Gigs are just to big 

to download in any sort of realistic time!

For that reason, I am providing - with a time lag I'm afraid - normal low res files, which I, and perhaps 

others, wil find more realistic for their needs.

Turkey Grand Prix Qualifying in Standard Definition

Race 4: Turkish Grand Prix, Istanbul Park Circuit

Recording Source: BBC One HD

Jake Humphrey, Martin Brundle, David Coulthard & Eddie Jordan present the F1 Qualifying coverage to the 4th 

Race meeting of the 2011 Formula One season, The Turkish Grand Prix, from the Instanbul Park Curcuit.

Please Note: The BBC Broadcast had audio problems at the beginning of the coverage (before the quali) for 

around 8.5 minutes or so. The sound, is initially dead and then very quiet. Near the end (after the quali) the 

sound gets a bit noisy and the level is reduced.
