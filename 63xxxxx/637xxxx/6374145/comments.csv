Howards End in  Blu ray, Rear Window in HDTV(love ur hitchcock movie rips)"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-08T11:20Z,"@jamydoug: I can do both, but Rear Window should be available on TPB (some moron advertised his torrents on my threads month back) and Howards End can be 480p only, it is too long movie for 720p, probably."
,TheSyPhER,2011-11-30T18:01Z,"this rip, like everything else's of twentyforty, is horrible with pixels and weird cuts and jumps. avoid like the plague, that's what I've been doing for years with this guy at this point. I downloaded this file without realizing who upped it, went to watch it and couldn't believe the shite I was witnessing. Came back and of course its fucking twentyforty."
