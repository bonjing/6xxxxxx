,herbigesmoke,2011-05-09T12:58Z,"thanks again eztv
i know its a sore subject but any idea when the hurricain eps crossover of famguy, amdad and cleaveshow will be aired?"
,dstar75,2011-05-09T15:40Z,"anybody askin about the hurrican crossover read this ""FOX has decided that the Hurricane Crossover will be the season openers for all 3 Seth McFarlane shows next tv season. Due to the recent events in the southern US of an outbreak of destructive storms, Fox left it would have been in bad taste to air these episodes at this time."""
,missmirei,2011-05-09T19:13Z,thank you eztv!! big kiss and a hug. :)
[V],.BONE.,2011-05-09T19:36Z,spot on 10/10 but who else thinks most of the eps this season have been slow asif they have ran out of jokes ??
,crewy99,2011-05-09T22:50Z,"yeah,this season is nowhere near as good as the last one,shame!"
,hajimaru,2011-05-09T23:52Z,"You know. These guys or at very least, this guy, who's presented as Eztv. Has done something so remarkable, that he's like TPB's version of HBO.
Always spot on time, a vast number of shows for the vast differences amongst us watchers.

I salute you.
I thank you.

It's not torrents, it's Eztv!"
,Sepideh,2011-05-10T08:18Z,"So, I guess this isn't actually Brothers and Sisters but The Big Bang Theory. "
,hairyshit,2011-05-10T19:54Z,"normally eztv stuff is good, but did anyone notice the volume being abit low."
,dlarrym1111,2011-05-11T00:36Z,"Big time thanks! , great quality as usual. Brilliant!! 
As far as the HUMOR quality and weather it has diminished this season compared to prior seasons. . . I don't feel this season has any more ""DUD"" episodes then any other season.
As I think about it, I don't know of ANY comedy series (animated or not) that NEVER had a ""BEAT"" or ""DUD"" episode. 
AGAIN, GREAT upload  many thanks."
,jmettam,2011-05-11T06:31Z,"Downloading now, thanks a lot eztv. Keep up the good work!"
,nielsniels12,2011-05-11T21:43Z,"utorrent wont download this torrent.. very weird.
never had this before with eztv. me sad.."
,CrazyTurk42,2011-05-13T17:00Z,hmm its not downloading with bitlord? never happend this
,MrPirate8,2011-05-13T22:21Z,This is actually episode 16 called The Big Bang Theory. Goos share though. I'm sure it's just a stupid mistake from eztv
,viothy,2011-05-14T23:13Z,"I agree with MrPirate8, I think a lot of family guy S09 episodes on piratebay seem to be numbered incorrectly?

anyway, thanks for the ep"
,Luque840,2011-05-16T15:22Z,eztv does it again. Everything I've had of you has been 10/10. 
,downloadmeee123,2011-06-05T07:41Z,"Family guy is becoming worse. Lost its originality, No creativity and No humor in it anymore.Simpsons and south park are way better than this show."
,Tamarind777,2011-07-01T11:59Z,"The reason this show is so bad now-a-days is that McFarlane is using it spew forth his pro-abortion, God-hating political opinions and views. In other words, his own religion."
[T],MrLore,2011-07-13T16:09Z,"@Tamarind777

""God-hating""? Hard to hate something you know to be fictional."
,JohnShit,2011-07-16T19:01Z,"@Tamarind777
God doesn't exist. Hate to break it to ya, pal."
