,sparkle28,2011-07-06T10:24Z,"How come that when I press to download all I get is a torrent file on 21.5kb?  please help me,
I havent downloaded in a year or so, have something changed?"
,j.o.,2011-07-14T13:33Z,"Sparkle28. I don´t know what you are doing wrong. Do you use utorrent, bittorrent or something else? Anyway, maybe you need to update if you haven´t used them in a year. If that dosen´t work, try to uninstall and download it again. There is nothing wrong with this file. I´m downloading it right now."
