This greatest hits is an excellent introduction to the work of Nick Drake. It also provides an entirely new perspective on his genius since the tracks are not arranged in chronological order. Mellow, melancholy folk music, haunting vocals, sensitive and bittersweet lyrics that stands head and shoulders above most popular music. Genuine art.
