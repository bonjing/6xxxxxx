,Adnrw,2011-05-08T21:16Z,"Is this legit?
I've had problems with the last 2 I've downloaded so I'm not taking the risk."
,Stoltz84,2011-05-08T21:26Z,"No, this is probably the same Alurion virus this Dwarfs -THETA faker has uploaded a couple of times now ;)

DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS: This is a rootkit virus.
If u do get this virus, use TDSSKiller to remove it."
