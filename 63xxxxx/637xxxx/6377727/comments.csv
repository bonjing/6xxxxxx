SEED PLEASE!"

your ""SEED PLEASE!"" was posted less than 30 minutes of this torrent being posted. srsly? it's not like the leechers got 100% of the torrent instantly. Don't be so impatient.

@TvTeam

As i've posted many times before, I love the no rar releases, it allows me to seed more since I don't have to have the show on my hard drive 2 times just to watch it and seed at the same time. Keep em coming!"
