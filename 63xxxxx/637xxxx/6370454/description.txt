RELEASE NOTES:

Traditional 3D programs are notoriously difficult to use
and understand. Not so Xara 3D Maker 7. Unlike many 3D
programs that take an age to learn and understand, Xara
3D Maker 7 has been created to perform one job, and
performs that job with style, speed and simplicity.Xara
3D Maker 7 is solely designed to create the highest
quality 3D text and graphics, such as headings, logos,
titles and buttons. It's the perfect way to add impact to
your web pages, mailshots, movie titles and credits, and
presentations (all images are fully anti-aliased for that
smooth, professional quality). Xara 3D Maker 7 can also
create awesome 3D animations in seconds - GIFs, AVIs and
simple Flash movie sequences - and you can even enhance
your desktop by saving any animation as a screensaver
