From BBC Radio 4 Extra. Written by Jane Austen; Full cast dramatisation starring Hannah Gordon, Amanda Root, Michael Williams, Jane Lapotaire and Louise Jameson; Dramatised by Elizabeth Proud; Directed by Sue Wilson.

Fanny Price, the timid eldest daughter of a large and struggling family, is nine years old when she is sent to live with her aunt and uncle, Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram, at Mansfield Park. At first homesick, Fanny is no match for three of her witty and vivacious cousins, but finds friendship with the fourth, Edmund.

In time Fanny's steadfast and purposeful character makes her an indispensable member of the household. But when Sir Thomas is away on a lengthy journey to the West Indies the Bertram children indulge in 'theatricals' and romantic flirtations which ultimately lead them into a web of intrigue. Fanny, by now in love with Edmund, is dismayed to find him enraptured by their cousin Mary Crawford, whilst Mary's brother Henry has himself become besotted with Fanny, whose hopes of finding love with Edmund seem ever more unlikely.
