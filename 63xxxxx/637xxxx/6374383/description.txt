It took Architecture in Helsinki a while to follow up Places Like This, which they had recorded with founder Cameron Bird in Brooklyn and the rest of the group scattered across the globe. All the bandmembers reconvened in Australia to make Moment Bends, and it is hard not to think that this is a large part of why they sound much more focused than they did before.  Moment Bends shows Architecture in Helsinki moving forward by looking back - not only to their own skills with hooks and melodies, but to 80s synth pop too.
