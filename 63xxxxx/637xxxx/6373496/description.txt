In Days of Old When Knights Were Bold, and Lusty Ladies Were Bawdy... You'll Find This Tale of Canterbury is Definitely Very Naughty! Hyapatia Lee is your hostess in the most erotic version of Geoffrey Chaucer's 13th century classic you'll ever see! The sets are fabulous, the costumes sensational, and the sex is hotter than HOT. Join in the lusty merriment as a group of pilgrims recounts one ribald tale after another on their way to Canterbury.

First there's the classic "Miller's Tale," where a miserly miller cheats two students (Jon Martin & Peter North) until the miller's wife (Stevie Taylor) and daughter (Page Turner) repay the boys with a piston-pumping daisy chain. Playing a gypsy, Hyapatia has a sizzling girl-girl encounters with his wife of Bath (Colleen Brennan), while later she inflames the crystal balls on the two gypsy studs!

There are many, many more Ribald Tales of Canterbury. And as our lusty travelers reach their final destination, the romantic air of their journey lingers on to become a reality!
