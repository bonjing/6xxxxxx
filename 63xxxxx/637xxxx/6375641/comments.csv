,Kara-kan,2011-06-30T15:48Z,What is the quality of this rip? How was it possile to create such a small file?
,Kara-kan,2011-06-30T16:51Z,"It has hardsubs, which I wasn't able to turn off.
It's quite annoying."
,Mikeman2000,2011-08-06T05:34Z,"I must say, I first watched this movie when I was in the fifth grade. I've loved it since. This is a cinematic masterpiece, and one of my favorites. Thanks for the up."
,lewdel,2012-01-21T18:31Z,"The movie has the great audio and video quality I have come to expect from YIFY considering it was filmed 70 years ago.

I thought this section was for commenting on the audio and video quality of the download not for begging the uploader for their favorite film. I could be wrong.

Kara-kan: High profile AVC (H264) encoding allows a low bit rate with acceptable quality. Also subtitles can be turned off, at least with VLC and PotPlayer."
