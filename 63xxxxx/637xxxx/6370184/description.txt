"The Signs in the Silence"

A 15-year-old Jane Doe, who is hearing 
impaired and unable to communicate, is 
found on the streets covered in blood 
and wielding a knife, leading the team 
to believe she is responsible for a 
recent murder. Meanwhile, Angela keeps 
Hodgins in the dark regarding the 
details of her pregnancy.

Enjoy :)
