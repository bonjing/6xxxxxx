,jorrell0733,2011-05-06T21:00Z,"RE:grz911. Dude im uploading at 3mbps but ive been bandwidth throttled today by my ISP. Nothing i can do, but there's no need to write comments like that! So ill drop to your level and tell you to fuck off and go download elsewhere moron! I do these torrents for those who really want decent quality. If you cant make positive comments where there is nothing actually wrong with the torrent, the keep it to yourself!"
,jorrell0733,2011-05-06T21:02Z,"Im just about gettng sick and fucking tired of people coming on here and doing nothinbg but complain! If this continues ill cease uploading ANYTHING for F1 in future, If you dont want my torrent, thats fine go elsewhere, but dont slag off those who take the time and effort to provide quality torrents for F1 Fanatics!"
,jorrell0733,2011-05-06T21:07Z,"RE: grz911, Ok LOOK! Yet another person moaning and complaining who has never even uploaded ANYTHING on TPB, You people want it all for nothing, and still you bitch and fucking moan, go suck your boyfriend off you prick!"
,mojazubarka,2011-05-06T21:17Z,grz911 are you buddy with Viciously?
,jorrell0733,2011-05-06T22:08Z,"Yes Ive found grz911 is Viciously, so obviously he's goona just slag off all my torrents all weekend now. Ignore Him!"
,xparty,2011-05-06T22:56Z,"Signed up just to comment on this (been following your F1 feed since the start of the season).

Excellent quality stuff you got here. The trolls will be just that, and to add a cherry on top of this stack of shit, no matter how much they'll whine, they haven't got too many alternatives. 

Looking forward to seeing what the video quality is like; I've become a bit skeptical since Australia P2, but regardless, can't wait. 

Loving your effort, keep it up!"
,xparty,2011-05-07T01:11Z,"This is fucking hilarious. When it actually comes to physical threats over the internet, I just fucking lose it. Well done, mate, my sides are in pain.

Also, my downloads have both finished, and it took far less than 4 hours. Looks like someone can't handle their downloads."
,xtrlrg,2011-05-07T06:33Z,"@Viciously, no one reads your dull comments ace. No one fcking cares if you like to sucks balls three times a day. It is something between your swollen lips and half of the gay parties in your area.

Try Africa. There you'll find a wide range of animals with balls so big that will keep your mouth busy for a decade.

If you want better quality get a flight to Turkey and run naked on the track. With a bit of luck you'll be fucked before you know it."
,xtrlrg,2011-05-07T06:39Z,"Jorrell, all these guys could be the same troll. He is  trying to put you off. 

There is no one else, as far as I know, doing the job you are doing (uploading practice, qualifying and race). 

Please, ignore these fudgepackers. Personally, I can't thank you enough."

,baxim,2011-05-07T11:17Z,"yeah Jorrel, you may have a few trolls commenting here but you have hundreds of people that appreciate your uploads, so statiscally, you are doing awesome. Keep up the good work man. Deep inside, everyone appreciate you. "
,rcevans80,2011-05-07T18:06Z,"@jorrell0733

Just wanted to say that I really appreciate your work in uploading these files. Please don't let some idiots get you down. I rely on torrent files to watch F1 racing.

Could you please post the qualifying from Turkey? 

Thanks man, Randy"
