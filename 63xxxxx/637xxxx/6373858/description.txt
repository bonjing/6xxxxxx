Apptivate v2.0 (Mac App Store)

Description

A simple, beautiful hotkey manager.

Launch applications, execute scripts, run automator workflows and open files or folders. All of this at the press of a key combination.

Apptivate 2.0 introduces hotkey sequences, which are simply a sequence of key combinations. In previous versions of Apptivate, you could only bind an item to one key combination/hotkey. In Apptivate 2.0, it's possible to bind one item to something like âŒƒA + T, and another item to âŒƒA + H. To activate one of the items, you simply press the key combinations in order: first âŒƒA and then either T or H.
This greatly simplifies your key combinations if you've got a lot of items.

Apptivate also includes a preference for hiding the application if it's active when the hotkey is pressed. You can also take a quick look at an application by pressing and holding the hotkey; when the hotkey is released, the application is hidden.
