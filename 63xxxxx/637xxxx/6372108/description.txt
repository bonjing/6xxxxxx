Ch4 Time Team Special Boudicas Lost Tribe HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

Boudica is revered as one of the greatest female warriors in history. In this Time Team Special, Tony Robinson traces her story and follows a major excavation in Norfolk that may hold the key to uncovering what happened to Boudica's tribe after they were defeated by the Roman army. Boudica's tribe, the Iceni, used to make exquisite torcs: jewellery that required metalworking skills more advanced than anywhere else in the world; and they left behind some of the greatest treasures of prehistory.
