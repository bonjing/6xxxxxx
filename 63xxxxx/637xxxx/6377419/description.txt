                                  Darwin on the rocks
                     Produced to mark Charles Darwin's bicentenary.
                       A joint project with Answers in Genesis UK
 
Take a world-wide tour with Creation Research International Director, John Mackay of the geological evidence which supports the Biblical account of earth history and contradicts Darwin's belief that rock formations had taken vast amounts of time to be laid down. One supporter told us that it was the best DVD produced by a creation ministry he had ever seen. Fast moving and information packed - with John Mackay at 
full throttle in his outback Australian style.
