First of all the beginning is missing.....secondly I cannot play it in DivXPlus player and in Windows Media Player it starts but the sound is distorted. Third; I can not stream it to HDX media player and on my TVIX media player it starts but there is no sound....
What about including some file info) (codecs etc.)"

The mkv container is not supported by many units and media players, including Windows Media Player. :)
Use VLC, or convert the file to a format to fit you and your needs."
