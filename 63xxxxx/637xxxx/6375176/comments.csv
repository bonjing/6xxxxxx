,zvengar,2011-05-17T02:04Z,"What instructions?
The download includes; SERIAL TXT,(no instructions just the code) WINDOWS XP ACTIVATOR(which didnt work for me.) and the ISO FILE.
there are no instructions in the ISO file either.

when i tried the activator i got the:""this application failed to initialize properly."" box.

or i'm just dumb and need further instructions.thx."
