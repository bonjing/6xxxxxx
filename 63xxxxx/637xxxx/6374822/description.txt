      Episode five in the second series of the comedy sketch show
      written and performed by Iain Connell and Robert Florence, and
      set in the fictional but strangely familiar Scottish town of
      Burnistoun. This time the town's caped crusader, Doberman Man,
      comes face-to-face with his archenemy Big Sanny Tolan's boy,
      Peter and Scott go to great lengths to avoid seeing the faces of
      rival fans celebrating a televised football match, and James
      Bond finally arrives in Burnistoun for an unpromising encounter
      with his local female contact. A vending machine fights back
      after being kicked by a dissatisfied would-be customer, we find
      out what action to take when being kept awake by noisy seagulls,
      and Carlos Zumba demonstrates why his dance craze is such a hit
      with the ladies. A local undertaker offers a surprising funeral
      deal and Burnistoun's local MP gets caught out by online
      technology. Finally, we go back in time to the local dance hall
      at the time of the Second World War and see how the local girls
      reacted when the Yanks came to Burnistoun.
