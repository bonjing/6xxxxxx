The most popular electricians' handbook for the past 95 years has been completely updated to provide the latest NEC and NESC rules and standards, and new references to solar power, photovoltaics, induction lighting, and more. Providing all the information you'll need to design, maintain, and operate systems and equipment, the Fifteenth Edition of the American Electricians' Handbook is the key to tackling even the most complex jobs with complete confidence. This one-stop resource focuses on systems and equipment rather than codes and calculations, making it the most practical, hands-on guide available. No matter what kind of electrical project you plan to take on, the American Electricians' Handbook is the only guide you'll need.
