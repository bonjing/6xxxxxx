,lcn,2011-05-06T23:52Z,"Can someone help me please,

I installed JeppView v3.6.2.0 (built 13219) first and then cycle 01 - 2009.

Jeppview has been installed with serial ending with 7G8F

However, i can't register Jeppview with phone method : the site code has already been filled-in automaticaly and i can't change it.

So i can only use Jeppview during 30 days, can you tell me how to fix it ?

Many thanks,"

It looks the map is not well detailled ...

Should it use FliteStar in order to get more detailled maps ?"
