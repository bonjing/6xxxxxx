Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Technology 6th Edition by Bill Whitman, Bill Johnson, John Tomczyk and Eugene Silberstein

Review
"The three greatest strengths of this text are: 1) the graphic illustrations which strike a good balance between realism and expression of concept; 2) the inclusion and content of Section 10 which provide a needed addition for technicians who are working in facilities maintenance or commercial AC; and 3) the plain style of writing which seems to come more from a technician than from an engineer."
