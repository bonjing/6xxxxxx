BBC Civilisation 08of13 HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup 1969

Re-mastered version converted from the original 35mm film to BluRay and recently broadcast on BBC HD.

Part 8. The Light of Experience.
The telescope and the microscope revealed new worlds in time and space and in a drop of water. And the realism of Dutch painting carried a stage further the observations of human character. Sir Kenneth Clark's story takes him from the Holland of Rembrandt and Vermeer to the London of Wren, Purcell and the Royal Society.
