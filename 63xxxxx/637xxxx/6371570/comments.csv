thx for comments"
,gylgamesh5000,2011-05-19T17:45Z,I think poster made an error when posting this. He/She should have archived the material in Zip or RAR format. The torrent has included several invisible files that should have been excluded. I'm guessing this data was stored on a hard drive formatted for PC.
,rushy68,2011-07-21T20:30Z,"There is already a version 11.03. Even Toast 10 still works with lion. 
Beside that: 10 looks even better than 11. So, why update? "
,giraffa78,2011-08-24T15:23Z,Works great thank you! :)
,Regnaloube,2011-08-29T23:31Z,"Mes amis, I am getting a message when I try to install the HD/BD plud that the installation can not be made because the file is either incomplete or corrupted.  Would DeGun or anybody else can provide me with assitance here?  I am also concerned that I may be seeding a corrupt or incomplete file. "
,jackflash,2011-12-20T13:14Z,"I don't recommend this torrent.
When I try to open the plugin installer:
""You can't open the application Toast 11 HD_BD Plug-in Installer.app because it may be damaged or incomplete.""
Also, this is an odd upload as it has all the resource forks etc. as separate files.  Perhaps that's why people always put them in rar or zip files."
