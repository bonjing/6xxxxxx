Instructor's Solution Manual for Theory of Vibration with Applications, 3rd Edition by W. T. Thomson (c1988). Problem statements and solutions in separate DjVu files (you can load both files in the same DjVu reader and view them independently by switching windows). All 14 chapters combined in a single bookmarked DjVu file. Units: US, SI & nondimensional. Scanned from book at low resolution. To read files in DjVu format, you will need a stand-alone DjVu reader. I recommend the one available at  http://sourceforge.net/projects/windjview/files/ (freeware; WinDjView + MacDjView). Current edition: 5th, 1998.

Once your download has finished, _please_ seed this torrent as often and for as long as you possibly can.
