,evilworm13,2011-05-07T05:03Z,"Lots of different versions of this out. A file called ind.dll is infected with Trojan.CryptRedol.Gen.1 in all of them. I would not recommend anyone downloading this one, ind.dll appears twice in this torrent.

,klankpulse,2011-05-21T00:45Z,"Fantastic torrent, For all of the kiddies out there, you have to frag the files that are located in the crack folders into the main DT installation folder.

The virus warnings are a false positive, just ignore them. This was a fantastic torrent, seeding indefenitly."

,Fangheart,2011-08-26T00:37Z,when i try to move the file mfc100u.dll to the daemon tools program file it says access denied! i know this is some stupid mistake i'm making but could someone help plz?
,dasumianco,2011-09-28T12:09Z,"to all those that are getting TRIAL PERIOD EXPIRED when running the installer now that .315 has been released.. this little trick will allow you to bypass the version check in the DT installer..

1. google 7-ZIP, Download & install

2. right click on the daemon tools installer and use the 7-zip option extract to (folder name, should be DAEMON Tools Pro Advanced 4.41.0314.0232). This will extract all the files in the installer to a directory.

3. copy SND's cracked .dll's into the folder you just created..

4. click DTPRO & Install Gadget & windows will take care of the rest..

5. ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Tested on Win 7 64bit"
