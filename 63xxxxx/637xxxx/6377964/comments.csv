,MOVNGFWD,2011-05-10T15:07Z,"...pulled up the info on this film: looks interesting!  Thank you for continuing to introduce me to so many films I would have otherwise missed (and for always providing such incredible quality!)  

Here's a write up on the film:
Umay, 25, is torn between two cultures when she leaves her abusive husband and takes their young son, Cem, from Istanbul to her family home in Germany. Seeking refuge with her parents, Umay hopes to start anew, but her family disapproves. She finds work in a restaurant and falls in love with a German co-worker, Stipe, who happily welcomes her and Cem into his life, but turmoil erupts when Umay's family decides to return Cem to his father.

Cheers, GoodFilms!  :)"
