,Bynx,2011-05-07T23:34Z,This is great. If you are a UFC fan you gotta see how it all started. Pure boxers vs wrestlers vs judo vs karate. Teeth fly and hands and feet break. One dutch master broke his hand and foot and came back to win another match only to loose to the master Royce Gracie. This is a real keeper DVD.
