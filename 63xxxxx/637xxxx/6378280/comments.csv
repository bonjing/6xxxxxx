Is this file the same as the known leaked one:
ISO Size: 2.62GB (2.821.873.664 bytes)
ISO MD5: E5A1A4A431C25A1D8B2428066487FC45

If no, what is the difference can you confirm please?"
,MrFKM,2011-05-10T12:25Z,OK i have downloaded and confirmed that this indeed has the  new installer u just have to go in sources folder and then run installprep.exe
,WhiteCobra,2011-05-10T20:10Z,is just for testing not 8 :P
,fredpc,2011-05-11T13:22Z,"To those saying that this is Win 7 ......It is not true ....it is just using the Win 7 GUI at the moment 
The heart of the Os is Win 8 

If you don't believe then try using a Win 7 loader or patches ....it will not work....coz the Os is different  "

,dell-1525,2011-05-13T04:16Z,Which language is it??
,LH-TAIMI,2011-05-13T10:03Z,its english
,puma_ile,2011-05-19T20:09Z,Is it bootable ?
,fredpc,2011-05-20T23:09Z,"puma_ile
yes it is bootable ...but if you boot from dvd it will only show the Win 7 installer not the Win 8 

The Win 8 installer is run from thre installprep.exe .......which you have to run as an upgrade 

This version pof Win 8 is still using Win 7 gui at the moment....the next leak should be more like Win 8 ........build compiles have passed 8005.....this one is build 7955"
,Anirudh28,2011-05-22T15:34Z,"Thank u.
Your windows 8 build 7955 worked succesfully.
I also unlocked windows 8 build 7955 & now enjoying with them."
,spacedecade,2011-05-28T20:24Z,"angelfire23,

when you boot it as a dvd in the boot menu when you start computer i think it uses the autorun.ini to find what application to start"
,Anirudh28,2011-06-10T08:51Z,"The old srtup is of windows 7 when boot from dvd.
But it is the windows 8 pre release.
I unlocked all the features using NOPILL."
