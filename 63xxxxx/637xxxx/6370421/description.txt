ItÃ‚'s been 25 years since the Scranton High School basketball team won the state championship. And every year, four of the victors and their coach (Mitchum) gather to relive the glory of their shining moment. But tonight, the reunion is rife with accusations of betrayal, backstabbing, infidelity and fraud. Can their friendship survive their crimes against each otherÃ‚... or will the dirtiest secret of all destroy what remains of their finest hour?
