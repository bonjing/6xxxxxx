├óΓé¼┼ôWhat would the ├óΓé¼╦£80s have been like without the franchise band?  Iconic New York/New England-based songwriters ├óΓé¼┼ôJoe and Dan├óΓé¼┬¥ spearheaded the concept in the early years of that lost decade. Their meteoric rise to obscurity was almost matched by their sudden crash and burn as the decade came to a close. The idea of franchising rock music was hardly unexpected, but the way these two (or was it an art collective?) engineered it was both subtle and in-your-face. Encouraging the many dozens of bands using their material to ├óΓé¼┼ômake it their own├óΓé¼┬¥, the origins have been mostly obscured. There are rumors of ├óΓé¼┼ôbasement tapes├óΓé¼┬¥ but they have remained just that, even now, more than 15 years after the concept faded to simple influence.  Their influence is as undeniable as the inspiration present in their original, if a bit oddball, lyrics. One gets the impression that they would simply throw a record on the turntable, and the process - let├óΓé¼Γäós not call it stealing, they were far more original than that term would imply ├óΓé¼ΓÇ£ would start from there.  Their styles were all over the place, yet, still, bands were able to make it their own, sometimes cannibalizing them wholesale, combining two or more songs, using contrasting styles, even translating them into other languages ├óΓé¼ΓÇ£ Esperanto included! Evidence is hard to come by, since the bands never credited them ├óΓé¼ΓÇ£ was that part of the contract?...├óΓé¼┬¥

├óΓé¼┼ô├óΓé¼┬ªthat fans discovered the music of their favorite bands wasn├óΓé¼Γäót original, put such a strain on the concept that there were soon riots, and plenty of denial coming from the bands themselves. Ultimately being linked to ├óΓé¼┼ôJoe and Dan├óΓé¼┬¥ was the kiss of death├óΓé¼┬ª├óΓé¼┬¥

├óΓé¼┼ôPerhaps the most successful prank ever played on the Music Industry. Prank or successful business model?├óΓé¼┬¥

├óΓé¼┼ôWith the varying versions of their songs, it is hard to imagine what the writers├óΓé¼Γäó original vision was. The songs seem so plastic, in a way, that any style would suit them well.├óΓé¼┬¥

Well, I ran into these (in CD format) recently, and it seems they must be part of the ├óΓé¼┼ôbasement tapes├óΓé¼┬¥ mentioned above.  The quality is not perfect. I don├óΓé¼Γäót know how they were transferred, or how they were originally recorded.

A side note: Though the references above seem to point to their demise as being in the late eighties, I remember hearing some of their songs in Berlin in 1989 and Oslo in the early ├óΓé¼╦£90s.  Though they were translated, their origin was clear to me. The bands had mixed them in with their own songs, or so it seemed at the time.  Maybe their end of activity in the States didn├óΓé¼Γäót stop them abroad├óΓé¼┬ª

It came on two discs, one titled ├óΓé¼┼ôSquawk-A-Doodle-Dandy├óΓé¼┬¥ and the other ├óΓé¼┼ôThey Can Do What They Can Do├óΓé¼┬¥.├úΓé¼Γé¼192 kb/sec rips
