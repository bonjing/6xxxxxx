This is a nice audience recording. Nowhere near as good as the 'Toad's Place' DVD (which was pro-shot) but still very nice. It's the complete show from the August 28, 1991 show from Koln, Germany. The taper was in the middle of a busy crowd but managed to shoot between all the heads and hands in front of him. Well at least most of the time. There are moments that the screen shows black video but that's because the crowd was blocking the camera. The audio is also very decent and clear. And the show itself is major fun!
