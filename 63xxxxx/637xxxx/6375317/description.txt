Key Benefits

TrackStudio Enterprise - is a versatile task management system, optimized to manage projects that contain tens of thousands of different types of tasks. System-in many respects unique, are the key advantages:

1 TrackStudio supports the hierarchical structure of work WBS (Work Breakdown Structure), allowing you to effectively manage large hierarchy of tasks.
Complex problems easier to solve if separate them into smaller pieces, and they, in turn, into even smaller. To accomplish this, the control system must maintain a hierarchy of tasks. However, full support for a hierarchy of tasks - a great rarity, the vast majority of systems implement only a few fixed levels of nested tasks.

2 TrackStudio maintains an organizational structure (OBS) Organizational Breakdown Structure, allowing you to manage a large number of different users: managers, developers, customers, etc.
A lot of companies use a matrix organization structure, when the project manager shares with the functional managers responsible for specifying the priorities and management of people assigned to the project execution. But for the support matrix structure requires a hierarchical organization of users into divisions. Other systems do not allow you to manage hierarchies of users and administrators have to deal with the usual lists of hundreds of users.

3 TrackStudio maintains uniform standards of project management, taking into account the individual characteristics of the configuration of specific projects.
Your company may use one copy of TrackStudio to develop a completely different projects for different clients. We know of no other system that would support a complete system setup for each project or group of projects, in most cases you will need to configure multiple instances of the system.

4 TrackStudio help simplify the administration of a large number of projects and increase the safety of their development.
TrackStudio has a unique safety system that gives managers full control over all their projects and their subordinates, while providing the possibility of complete isolation of different development teams and customers.

5 TrackStudio will conduct business around the world.
