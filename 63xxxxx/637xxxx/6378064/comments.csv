NOBODY have completed download - yet."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-09T13:03Z,"Not interested in this one, Shailesh, but if I was, you can rest ASSURED that, if given a choice between a 400 and a 700 MB Rip, I would be downloading--and complimenting the considerateness of the encoder--the smaller one.  Why it it such a difficult concept for you to fit into that tiny little mind of yours??  of course, the icing on the cake of REALITY is that twentyforty's 400MB encodes surpass most others' 700MB ones.  With my 17"" desktop screen with ancient Quadro 500FX video card, or my 10"" netbook screen with Intel integrated graphics, I could care less if pixellation occurs on 19"" HD monitor.  I get to watch a MOVIE, for FREE!  Why can't you cultivate AN ATTITUDE OF GRATITUDE?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-09T13:11Z,"@puplone: LOL. ""How he is doing that? Encode and upload so many - and I can't. Fucker...""

Further, they are not clever enough - living proof are comments 17 minutes after - torrent upload.
I have 23.5"" LCD. by the way."

,jmac85,2011-05-09T18:08Z,"@shailesh417: I watch 480p on my 27"" LCD at 1920x1200 res. 480p when viewed at full screen 3 ft. away is pixelated. It will be at any resolution, unless you a.) watch at proper distance and/or b.) watch on quality LCD/CRT/TV. Don't like it? Download 720p at whatever 2+ GB. And, DO NOT fucking comment if you haven't even completed the download.
@20-40: I do not hesitate nor worry about quality of your rips. You've proven again and again that your quality is pristine (based upon source). In conclusion: THANKS, and please ignore the half-wits. [+1 of course.]"
