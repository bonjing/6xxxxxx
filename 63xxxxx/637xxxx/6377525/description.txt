Were you one of the lucky readers to receive the supplementary DVD in the June/July 2010 issue of Vogue Paris?

If not, donâ€™t fear. Weâ€™ll keep you in the loop. The latest glossy created under the diligent tutelage of Carine Roitfeld featured a special documentary called Les Filles en Vogue, featuring five top models of the season: Sessilee Lopez, Sasha Pivovarova, Natasha Poly, Freja Beha Erichsen, and Constance Jablonski, as they experience the latest Paris Fashion Week. Sure, the majority of the short film is in French, but itâ€™s really the behind-the-scenes look which is most intriguing.

Though the film stars all five girls, thereâ€™s an extraordinary amount of Flip cam action from Sasha - including a moment in her hotel room where she lets it slip that her little bunny stuffed animal may be the star of a cartoon that the model plan to create in the future.

Now we know why Sasha was snapped by photographers carrying a camera!
