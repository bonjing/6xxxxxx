This one was the only disc in the series that I compressed.  It came on a dual layer, but it was just out of the threshold of a single layer DVDR (4.38Gb), and I no longer have the original Uncompressed ISO. Can you live with it? Ok then! : )

Compressed ISO file 4.36Gb created with ImgBurn. Disc 7 is.......well you know.
