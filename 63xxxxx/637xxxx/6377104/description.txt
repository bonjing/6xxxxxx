A full bootleg Nightwish concert with Anette Olzon. Quality is pretty good. Unfortunately, the track "The Poet And The Pendulum" is screwed up and just repeats the first 4 minutes or so for 15. Other than that, it's okay, maybe a bit skippy at places. I didn't film or record this concert; I merely worked hard to find Nightwish bootlegs and decided to place it here so they're easier to find.
