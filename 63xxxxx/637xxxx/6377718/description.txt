Radio Caroline is an English radio station founded in 1964 by Ronan O'Rahilly, to circumvent the tight hold the record companies had on the broadcast of popular music in the United Kingdom. It originally commenced transmissions as an offshore radio station broadcasting from a ship anchored in international waters off the coast of South East England. Originally unlicensed by any government, for the majority of its early life, it was labelled as a pirate radio station.

The station continues today as a satellite and internet broadcaster, with occasional transmissions via a low power Restricted Service Licence, usually emanating from the final offshore ship, the MV Ross Revenge. Music ranging from the 1960s to today is broadcast, with an emphasis on album-oriented rock (AOR) but also "mixing things up" with nostalgic tracks and some specialised music programmes.

The British government responded to the burgeoning popularity of Caroline and the other offshore stations in 1967 by passing the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act, which made it an offence to advertise or supply an offshore radio station from the UK. However, a rearguard action was attempted by the Manx parliament Tynwald to exclude the North Ship from the legislation with an appeal to the European Court on the legality of the act being applied to the Isle of Man. All offshore stations off the British coast closed, with the exception of Radio Caroline, which moved its supply operation to the Netherlands, where national laws had not made unlicensed offshore broadcasting a criminal offence.

Radio Caroline's original disc jockeys were Simon Dee, Chris Moore, Donny Kerr, Tom Lodge, Gerry Duncan and Carl Conway. They were later joined by Dave Lee Travis, Emperor Rosko, Tony Blackburn, Colin Berry, Tony Prince, Bob Stewart, Tommy Vance and also Johnnie Walker and Roger Day who moved from Radio England. Andy Archer moved there, from Radio City, as did Tony Allan and Steve Merike who came from Radio Scotland.
