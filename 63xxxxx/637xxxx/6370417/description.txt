Paratopia Special: Dr. Dennis McKenna and the Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss

What started as a 15 minute discussion for Paratopians to help finance Dr. Dennis McKennaâ€™s memoirs via Kickstarter.com turned into its own 90+ minute discussion about his own perspectives on psychedelics and the nature of reality, his adventures in the Amazon, and his brother Terenceâ€™s final days and beyond. Jer is nowhere to be found and Jeff mostly listens as Dennis takes us back to his days of journeying through the Amazon, and the mind, with Terence McKenna. This oneâ€™s so special, we decided to share it for free with everyone.

This is a worthy project that we hope all listeners will help out with â€“ this is where community counts. Letâ€™s help Dr. McKenna get this book done!
