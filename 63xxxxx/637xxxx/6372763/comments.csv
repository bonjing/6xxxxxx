,jkeller80,2011-05-11T00:29Z,"I just read about this and had to check it out.  I have no urge to download b/c I despise these types of shows but it seems Anonymous has struck again.  Instead of a DDoS attack, they've stolen the finalists names and contact info from the FOX servers."

,thekiller2,2011-06-05T18:18Z,@LulzSec           you should give away loads of sony redem codes (i think thats how you spell redeem) for free it would be epic 
,Haliax,2011-06-08T15:29Z,"@jkeller80 what are you smoking? LulzSec is not Anonymous. Anonymous isn't even an organisation. Hell they're hardly organised at all.

On another note. Very lulzy, I'm sure this is information easily abused though..."
