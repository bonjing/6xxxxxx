,phorensic,2011-05-08T20:13Z,"Files in the torrent don't match the description.  There are 5 MKV's instead of 2 AVI's.  Also, the resolution in the description isn't even close to 720p, not even 540p!  Anyone completed the download and can confirm quality?"
,raymond_u,2011-05-08T20:53Z,Will the forum be coming up?

,il_grammo,2011-05-09T10:25Z,"Phorensic, you should just be grateful, as I am, that SAFCuk009 has gone to the trouble to give us the F1. Where I live the local F1 coverage is awful. Iâ€™ve been following F1 for 30yrs and I have never enjoyed it as much as I do now with the BBC coverage. There are 19 races this year, thatâ€™s 38 feeds to record, prepare and post. Itâ€™s a lot of work. Would you go to the trouble of doing this? And you will probably complain when you canâ€™t find what you want free on the net. So from the people who do appreciate the generosity of people like SAFCuk009,  Phorensic shut the fuck up!"
,kanevolfeed,2011-05-09T13:48Z,"It's exactly how Il grammo said!!!  u__u He's doing a great work...We have to be thankful for his hard work, because It's not that easy!!"
