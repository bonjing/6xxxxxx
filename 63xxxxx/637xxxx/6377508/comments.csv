,mizzllat,2011-05-09T06:31Z,"Is anyone else having any problems with seeding?  I really don't mean to beee-atch, but first, so many of the torrents tonight were posted unseeded.  Now the same ones are showing seeds, but when I try to download, I'm still reading ""0.""  Like with this file, I'm getting ""0 of 7.""  ""The Killing"" reads ""0 of 14"" and ""The Borgias"" even worse, with ""0 of 19.""

Don't ever recall running into this kind of thing with every single torrent I've tried to DL in one night.  Thought it my ISP was squeezing my traffic to a trickle, but checked, and it's just fine.  (DLed a couple of movies from FXM as I'm writing this, and they both dropped in just a few short minutes.)"
