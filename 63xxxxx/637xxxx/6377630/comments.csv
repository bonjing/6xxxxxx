,hajimaru,2011-05-09T23:54Z,"You know. These guys or at very least, this guy, who's presented as Eztv. Has done something so remarkable, that he's like TPB's version of HBO.
Always spot on time, a vast number of shows for the vast differences amongst us watchers.

I salute you.
I thank you.

It's not torrents, it's Eztv!"
,joemaori,2011-05-10T05:22Z,thanks again EZTV-top show keep up the good work
,richietay,2011-05-10T09:23Z,Awesome. Why download from anyone else?
,pcsinfo,2011-05-10T11:20Z,"Why download from someone else? 
Its stuck at zero.
If I go to iso_hunt it works.
I don't know why, it only happens for some torrents, mostly eztv. Started 1-2 weeks ago.
Can't use another client, this thing is on my network disk working 24/7."
,pcsinfo,2011-05-10T11:22Z,"BTW, check entire thread, others have same problem, stuck for hours on 0%."
,kareru,2011-05-10T14:56Z,"man this show is so badass

,zapphb,2011-05-10T20:33Z,Thanks eztv
,vivaldi0,2011-05-11T00:00Z,"This series started good for episode 1, but now I am getting quite tired of politics.  Some action or dragons, or sword fighting or something would be interesting....watching 2 guys scrub a table talking about never having sex is quite boring.  Whispers in hallways...yawn...."
,bloodpool11,2011-05-11T07:37Z,"Thank you!! always very reliable, looks great!! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!! excelent series."
,bigbud13,2011-05-11T13:07Z,"I keep on getting same error msg on all TPB torrents `rejected by tracker-Requested dwnld is not authorized for use with this tracker` anyone else getting this on Virgin B/band UK??.
As always thnx EZTV for upload. "
,crazygamer22,2011-05-11T17:41Z,totally agreeing with vivaldi0
,wadap,2011-05-11T19:24Z,i'am always on ymesger:NicoleSpellv997
,hettbeans,2011-05-12T02:33Z,"If you are watching this show expecting mindless action and no exposition, politics, etc, then you are watching the wrong show. This is a series for adults -- maybe you should stick with Power Rangers and DBZ."
,DWarbird,2011-05-12T04:22Z,You kids DO know that this show follows the books do you not?  Books....you know stacks of papers with written words bound together.  Turn off the TV go get the books and you'll find out if there even are dragons in Game of Thrones.
,rialin,2011-05-12T19:56Z,"This series follows the books almost exactly as written, not like the rewritten Ring trilogy and the books are some of the best in the ""fantasy"" genre despite the lack of overpowered magicians and horde of dragons and monsters. The big thing with these are actually the politics and plots so if you dont like them I advise you to follow hettbeans advice.

I really love this serie, first time ever a filmatisation that actually follows the original books. I hope they keep up through all the books. A lot of things IĂÂ´ve dreamt of seeing filmed."

,foxdrake,2011-05-14T12:45Z,"@vivaldi0

... read the books. very good but you're right it is a bit slow.  These early episodes need to be 2 hours instead of 1 to get us through the background bullshit. 

But as usual HB0 sees $$$ and wants to milk it as long as they can."
,vartego,2011-05-14T17:27Z,"Holyshit i love this show:) amazing quality!
and a big thank you to eztv! dude you rock! ( i always download top gear and other shows from you)
