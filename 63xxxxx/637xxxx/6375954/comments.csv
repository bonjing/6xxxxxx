,Hamashedo,2011-05-29T21:05Z,I have an issue with your instructions in the readme. Wtf are you supposed to unrar? .001 file isnt a zip file. and I have nothing that read .sfv
,Rhodderzxii,2011-05-31T21:43Z,"@Hamashedo
.001 IS a rar achive file so use 7-zip or winrar, use notepad, notepadd++ or wordpad to read the sfv file"
,netsoldi3r,2011-06-07T01:36Z,use checksum to read .sfv lol as we make commerial comment
,freestyle_mccnasty,2011-06-25T13:26Z,"Nothing in this DL is a rar file they are all 7z. 
also where is the Crack? 
and do you need a disc in the physical drive to play? 
when i try to play it says ""no disc inserted"" even with all 5 discs mounted with Power ISO. 
your instructions could be better."
,freestyle_mccnasty,2011-06-25T20:22Z,"Nevermind, found crack, got to start, but none of the controls work so cant play."
,stitch53186,2011-06-27T22:15Z,"Game Works Perfectly!

I installed 7zip.
Extracted all 5 the folders and used the power iso files left behind,
Opened em individually in PowerISO
dragged all the files into a new folder,
ran the setup.
I than copied the crack and the patch into the installed folder.
Ran the Patch.
Ran the launcher to setup my controller to work on the game.
Ran the game.

No Virus.
Long process but this torrent is fine."
,deathdie,2011-07-20T16:54Z,"why do i get 'wrong disk inserted""???
please help"
,netsoldi3r,2011-07-25T01:08Z,"why you get 'wrong disk inserted""??? cause you don't change the .exe file its the crack"
,ode1234,2011-08-05T18:53Z,"What on earth do all the controls translate to? There's no option to change them so I'm stuck trying to figure out what keys translate.
I found out the numpad controls it, but Idk what all the buttons are."
,PirateEm,2012-05-13T02:24Z,"For anyone having trouble:

Download of course and go to the folder. Inside it will be some folders. Disc1-disc5.
In each folder, go inside and highlight everything then extract here.
You'll get a .bin file that can be mounted.

From here mount disc 1 and start the installation.
While you're at it, go into the actual disc's contents (explore/ open the drive through my computer) and copy and paste the crack folder somewhere.
Go through all 5 discs whenever it tells you to change them.

Once it's installed, go to the new THAW folder. Then go into the game folder.
Put the contents of the crack folder inside the game folder.
Or at least put the crack in there.
Then run the patch.

The game should now be installed.
If for some reason launching the game doesn't bring up the settings then go into the THAW folder and click the launch exe.
You'll then be able to adjust resolution and controls. 

Last, you may need to restart your computer before the game will run.
I kept clicking it and nothing would appear.
After restarting, it worked fine."
,PirateEm,2012-05-13T02:28Z,"Confirmed virus free.
Torrent worked great.
Thanks a lot for the upload netsoldi3r

I just played through Thug1 and Thug2 before this. They were good games, but the missions (especially in Thug2) were a bit tedious and the level design wasn't all that grand to me.
Furthermore the online servers weren't running so no online multiplayer unless you host yourself and play with friends.

But everything of that sort changed in THAW.
I'm really surprised at how good this game is. 
The story mode missions actually aren't pointless and make some sense, the level design is great and very open with lots of room for exploring and skating.. not to mention there isn't level select features, you can just keep skating around in a big open world.
And there are online servers up with people on.

My only complaint is you can't use your custom skater in the story mode which means no female players. You can play as a custom skater/ female in classic and free skate though.

So yeah, if you haven't played this then go for it. It's way better than every other TH game I've played by far. "

If you don't kow how to use torrents--GOOGLE IT!
If you don't know how to extract an archive--GOOGLE IT!
If you don't know what to do after you get your disk images --GOOGLE IT!
If you don't know what a crack it or how to use one--GOOGLE IT!
And for christ's sake quit littering the comments with cries of ""I't a virus--don't download--I've got two words for you--""FALSE POSITIVE"". If you don't know what that is--GOOGLE IT!!!
If you are a total moron then by all means--QUIT TORRENTING ILLEGAL SOFTWARE AND ASKING IN ONLINE POSTS ""HOW DO I DOWNLOAD THIS GAME OR THAT!!!"
