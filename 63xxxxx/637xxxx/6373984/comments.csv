,d15a5t3r,2011-05-16T23:39Z,"Everyone stop! This is a VERY bad download all seems well and it works and everything. However after I played it last night I just went to sleep leaving my game up and the game uploading in Bitlord. Now after closing the game I see my Bitlord has become corrupt and corrupted all my downloaded bitlord files along with my desktop files, C program files, and of course the game won't open now. When you download look carefully at the location you're downloading to if it has changed from your originally chosen spot and locked the text entry like mine has you could already have a virus or stop/don't download!!!!!"
