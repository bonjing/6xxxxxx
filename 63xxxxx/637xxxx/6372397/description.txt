Patrick Doyleâ€™s score at times helps convey the grandeur of Asgard and nicely accentuates the action set pieces, but at times itâ€™s the weak link in the film, playing up the drama with a melodramatic tone that may leave you rolling your eyes occasionally. Itâ€™s these moments that remind me of Branaghâ€™s early directing attempt â€œDead Again,â€ a favorite of mine, but ultimately the melodrama that works so effectively in that film doesnâ€™t go over as well in â€œThor.â€
