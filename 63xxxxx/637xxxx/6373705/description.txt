Boris Feoktistov was born in Krasnoiarsk, he was noticed at the age of 6 for his talent for improvisation on the balalaÃ¯ka. He began studing the violoncello in Moscow which led to him playing in the orchestra of the Red Army in 1938, up until the point where his musician friends ask him to play the balalaika. His performance leads to him becoming the soloist in this orchestra. In 1939 he received the winning prize of the "All-Russian Competition". He made many records mainly focusing on traditional Russian folklore and toured numerous times throughout Russia and the world during his long career.
