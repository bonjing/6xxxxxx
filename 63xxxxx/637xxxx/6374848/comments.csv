,pooloop,2011-05-08T02:32Z,"I think your a little early mate,The Premier League still has two weeks to go yet,Its the football league that has finished today bud,That show will be up as soon as I get seeds on this."
,3amkick,2011-05-08T02:43Z,nice work pooloop! thanks for all the uploads you've done this season. The highlights programme on NZ sky sports is crap compared to motd.
,feraledge,2011-05-08T02:46Z,thanks a ton for this and all your uploads! you are a lifesaver for EPL fans overseas like myself. kudos.
,b1r0nald,2011-05-08T03:07Z,I just want to echo the sentiments of others below.  You can't get MOTD in Australia and so you're my saving grace.  Thanks for all the posts.  I hope you're able to continue next season and beyond.  Thanks again.

,george1880,2011-05-08T11:38Z,"Thanks pooloop, you're a lifesaver. The other week you said something about only uploading on private sites next season. If you do that please, please, please let me know where. I'll follow you anywhere for my MOTD fix."
,golpster,2011-05-08T11:50Z,"thanks mate, you are a legend"
,dantheeducator,2011-05-08T12:45Z,I echo the Norwich fan's comments as a QPR fan myself. It's been a great season and I look forward to the rest of the EPL and next season. Thanks for the great work pooloop!
,NicknYoshi,2011-05-08T13:48Z,"My head's on Championship time - of course, a lot of your seasons are far from over. I should remember I'm in no condition to comment on anything sensibly late on Sat nights :) Well done QPR too - glad the best team in the division went up as deserved..."
