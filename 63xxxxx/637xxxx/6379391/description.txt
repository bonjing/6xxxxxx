The Fashion Show: Ultimate Collection (popularly known as simply The Fashion Show) is an American reality television series on the Bravo network which focuses on fashion design and is hosted by fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi and supermodel Iman. 

The contestants compete against each other to create the best clothes and are usually restricted in time, materials, and theme. Their designs are judged and one or more designers are eliminated each week.

It replaces Bravo's former fashion-competition TV show Project Runway, which has moved to Lifetime.
