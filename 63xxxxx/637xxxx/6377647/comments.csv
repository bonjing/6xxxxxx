,LostOne88,2011-05-09T11:42Z,"Dudes, we are living in 2011. If you suffer from insufficient disk space, buy a new harddisk. That's not so expensive. Or don't watch 720p videos.

There are only 7 sources seeding the unzipped version of this file, because everyone else is downloading your useless .rar files just because it somehow has more sources than it."
,exaulted,2011-05-09T12:40Z,"RAR is so obsolete. I am very happy to see people are starting to complain about RAR. It was marginally useful many years ago but does anyone care to save 5kb when so many of us have terabytes of storage? Newegg has the Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex Desk 2TB external drive for $120 with free shipping and similar internal drives for $75 and free shipping. 

I wish RAR would go away. Its especially annoying when RAR is abused like when RARs are zipped and then RARed again. Go away, RAR, go away. "

I usually agree with what TF's articles, but in this case, the person who wrote the article was ignorant of why multipart RARs are used. The articles assumption that the practice does nothing for the BitTorrent protocol is absolutely correct, but please understand that they are not being archived for BitTorrent downloaders. This archival method DOES have many benefits for older protocols like FTP and is also important on the Usenet.

Now to the important part. Automated scripts are used to download files from Usenet, FTP sites, or private trackers and post them here. This allows you to get you files much sooner and at much higher speeds. Prolific uploaders like sceneline could not comply with your request if they wanted to.

It should additionally be noted that packaging of already compressed data is NOT being done to save space by any stretch of the imagination. It actually makes the file-size ever so slightly larger.

If you want to complain, complain to sceners instead of pillars of our online community. Hint: You won't get very far."
,rafael1234,2011-05-09T13:26Z,Excellent speed the other 720 episode was on 10% when this one finished (100 Mb line) and quality just as the other episodes. Don't listen to the whiners too lazy to unrar. They share nothing with others just complain about getting stuff for free. thank you
