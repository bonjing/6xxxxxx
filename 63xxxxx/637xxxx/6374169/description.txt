SUMMARY:
There is not one universe, but there are many, which is a multiverse. 
Supposing you are just one person, there are many other versions of you 
in the other universes, there are ways to travel, but only a police agency,
MVA, can travel only for police procedures. Gabriel Yulaw is a former MVA 
agent, who killed another version of himself in self-defense. It made the 
other versions of him stronger. When Yulaw found out about this, he became 
power-hungry killing the 122 other versions for two years. After killing 
Lawless and getting captured by his former partner Roedecker and a new MVA 
agent Funsch, Yulaw managed to escape the prison and is trying to kill his 
last target, Gabe Law who is a police officer. He is also at Yulaw's strength. 
Roedecker and Funsch now have to arrest Yulaw before he can kill Gabe. There 
is a possibility that the universe could die or make Yulaw invincible. After 
encountering Yulaw for the first time, Gabe thought that it was his split 
personality, but it wasn't. Will Gabe be able to confront Yulaw before or 
after Yulaw ruins his life?
