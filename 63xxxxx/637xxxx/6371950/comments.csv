My Soul to Take (2010) PAL Retail MultiSubs DMT

you might see a lot of copies of this movie titled as : My So Take,
there should be . (dots) in between each word for the title of this movie to avoid this bug.

Thanks for the upload, +1:)"

+1 = Epic BoWoW & R-E-S-P-E-C-T .

The depth of the BoWoW & R-E-S-P-E-C-T is related to the degree of respect or gratitude i like to show NLupper.

This Upload is truly a perfect HOW-TO-DESCRIBE tutoriall at the same time."

Inquiry, the cover say 3D !?  

Is this dvdrip 3D only perhaps or both 2D & 3D ?

cheers"
