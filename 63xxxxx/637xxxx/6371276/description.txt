The Ranch (2004)

They're young, beautiful and every man's fantasy. Join the women of Diamond Ranch as they let go oftheir inhibitions and release unbridled passions in this seductive and unflinching look behind the doors of a private club that's based on a real-life brothel! Just outside Reno lies a paradise that caters to a gentleman's every wish. Under the protective eyes of their "manager" (Amy Madigan, Field of Dreams), the girls of the Ranch ply their trade in an almost idyllic and carefree world. But when a newcomer (Nicki Micheaux, "Soul Food") arrives, she brings more heat than this female oasis can handle and a dark secret that could jeopardize not only her life, but also the livelihood of all the working girls at the Ranch!
