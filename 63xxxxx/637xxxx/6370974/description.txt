The Creedence Clearwater Revival are an unique band. They may not have been revolutionary - their style was by-the-numbers blues, country, and rockabilly - but their songs are powerful, melodic, soulful and captivating, perfectly delivered by that voice (John Fogerty) and the harmony vocals. They were sincere in what they did and although CCR had many popular singles over their five-year existence that enjoyed heavy airplay, they never really got the recognition they should have. This compilation contains their best hits.
