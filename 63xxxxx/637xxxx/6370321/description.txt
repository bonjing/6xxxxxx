Since this was recorded to digital from a VHS, the quality is mediocre at best, but bearable. Since the movie is difficult to find in any form (VHS or DVD) it will be unfortunately difficult to get a better version. It took me around a month to track a copy down and change it into a digital format.

Make sure to read the reviews on IMDB. It is probably better to check and make sure you want to see this movie before you download it.
