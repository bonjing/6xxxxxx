Grade 5 Upâ€“This fact-filled, accessible revision of the excellent 1995 edition provides new material for researchers and general readers. It offers a comprehensive investigation of ancient Greece, from the dawning of Minoan civilization to the conquest of Romeâ€“2000 years of a remarkable civilization that left an indelible imprint on human history. The original format of this volume has not changed, but many of the alphabetical articles have been updated and rewritten.

New and expanded material includes pieces on Aesop, architecture, black peoples, Euripides, Jews, magic, land warfare, the climate and landscape of Greece, and wine. In addition, there are modern transliterations of ancient Greek (e.g., Hephaistos instead of Hephaestus), and a bibliography after each entry. Accurate cross-references, an information-packed time line, and a thorough index add to the volume's usefulness. The black-and-white maps, photographs, and illustrations are all high quality. This is a first-rate purchase for libraries on a topic of endless inquiry and fascination.â€“Hillary Jan Donitz-Goldstein, formerly at New York Public Library
