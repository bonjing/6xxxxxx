Enrique Iglesias has joined forces with Usher and Lil Wayne on 'Dirty Dancer,' the new single from the Spanish singer's album 'Euphoria.'

The club-ready track begins with a dedication from Usher, who says the song is "for the dirty girls all around the world." The song incorporates an infectious beat, which would create the perfect soundtrack for any foam party.

Iglesias and Usher trade verses throughout the song, which includes a repetitive chorus that asserts that this seductive woman is, well, a "dirty, dirty dancer." Wayne then comes in with a slinky rap, assessing the situation.

"Hello, baby it's Weezy, baby / It's going down, depreciating / Okay now, I don't dance unless we dancing dirty / Skinny leather pants, I'm on my Eddie Murphy / Shawty shake it fast like she in a hurry."

'Dirty Dancer' follows the release of 'Tonight (I'm Loving You),' which was released separately from Iglesias' latest album. 'Euphoria' is the first record from the pop star to incorporate both Spanish and English-sung tracks.
