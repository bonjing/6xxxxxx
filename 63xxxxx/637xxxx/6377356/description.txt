A sublimely enjoyable dub-influenced ambient and electronic outing by Jah Wobble, the British bassist who first came to fame as a member of John Lydon's Public Image Ltd. MU is a series of instrumental workouts that take their inspiration from ancient religion and modern trash culture in equal measure. "Viking Funeral" is propelled by its mighty bass figure and an appealing vocal chorus, the jazzy funk of "Kojak Dub" conjures the sweaty streets of 1970s New York, and "New Mexico Dub" performs the same trick for sun-baked Southwestern border towns. Wobble excels in playing the thunderous, loping bass lines of his reggae heroes, while the subtle mix of acoustic and electronic instrumentation gives these pieces an almost cinematic sweep.
