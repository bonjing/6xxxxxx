The panel and the studio audience will be debating:

Is the Bible still relevant today?


Nicky Campbell presents a special edition of The Big Questions
recorded at Bury Grammar School Boys.

To commemorate the 400th anniversary of the publication of the
King James Bible, the programme debates just one topic: is the
Bible still relevant? Contributing their views from the panel are:
the Right Reverend Michael Nazir Ali, the former Bishop of Rochester;
the scientist and atheist campaigner, Professor Richard Dawkins; Rabbi
Laura Janner-Klausner from the North Western Reform Synagogue; and the
Bible scholar Dr Francesca Stavrakopoulou, who presented the BBC Two
series, The Bible's Buried Secrets.
