just click on files right over the torrent size and you will see

@prathaprabhu
Thanks for all your hard work with this. I have downloaded the whole collection at filesonic and I wounder if you can send me some keys just in case mine dont work. That would be so greate.
Thanks again for your good work. IÂ´v been looking for all windows collections from Technet for so long.

,enjoi_9,2011-05-10T12:48Z,oh great :) many thanks for your awesome work!
,omenovelvelot,2011-05-10T22:02Z,The uploader (prathaprabhu) charges you $$$ to activate after the downloading. Don't bother unless you are OK to pay.
,bluewing29,2011-05-16T18:36Z,"How about seeding a little bit. It's been very very very slow, and now it has stopped completely. A lot of people are stuck at 37,9%."
[T],prathaprabhu,2011-05-17T16:07Z,"I have already seeded about 250GB+ with about 3,500 leechers. The files are no more in my server."
,bluewing29,2011-05-19T18:54Z,"Well, 250GB+ sounds nice, but how many have reached 100% from your seeding? Not many, I'm sure. I would dare to guess ZERO.
You have to let a few people reach 100% before you stop seeding."
,dylan75,2011-05-19T22:17Z,Please seeeeed !
,IlyesSoleil,2011-05-19T23:46Z,100% works
,arainc,2011-05-20T14:58Z,"i can confirm that the volume edition (english) of office 2011 sp1 installs correctly.  I had a different torrent, but it ended up being a dud.

This one is good.  OP did good by uploading many different languages, allowing the user to pick 1.  I picked ""dvd5 office 2011 standard w SP1 english"" from the volume folder;  worked in osx 10.6.6.  make sure you do clean uninstall of any previous copies of office 2011 first:  http://mac2.microsoft.com/help/office/14/en-us/word/item/9e879258-ed91-43d0-94b8-002c3292fdc6   :D  will seed the one I quoted above on seedbox until maybe 50-100gb."
,dylan75,2011-05-24T15:03Z,Seed please :-((

,samsamsamsamsam,2011-07-09T05:37Z,"Hi to all,
I'm a newbie and first time posting. I'm downloading the package through Vuze and obtained 100% with image ""dvd5 office 2011 standard w SP1 english"" the whole collection is stuck at 43% however there are many files that are at 100%. My question is: Will I need a key for installing? I've read all the comments and readme files but did not anything referring to it except that I won't need to activate. Does it mean no key required?

Thanks"

Retail editions requires an activation key.

Cheers"
,wannapod,2011-07-21T03:43Z,"I am having a problem with this torrent. I tried to use the volume english with sp1 iso. I tried to mount it and I got an error message the format was not recognized. I then mounted it through toast and saw an installer file which I tried to run but when it got to the point to actually install the software it said there was no software to install. I then actually burned the iso to a disk with toast and it does not mount when inserted into the mac. What am I missing here? I tried to just mount the non sp1 version and I get the same error.  Thanks for your help, If there is another version that does not need a retail key that works please feel free to suggest it.
"
,wannapod,2011-07-21T03:52Z,"ok nevermind that comment. I just noticed the iso I am trying to use was not actually completed. Duh.
Thanks anyway everyone"
,jazchill,2011-08-13T09:37Z,"The English Standard Volume (not Retail) edition installed smoothly & no serial needed on OS X Lion with latest updates. The updates went fine along as well after a new install. Thanks a lot ""Prathaprabhu"" for a great share. Looking forward to more Mac stuff. "

earn money for stolen software is not a good idea,
just think about Kim Dotcom"
