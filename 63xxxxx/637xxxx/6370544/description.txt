DVDRip of a mini-series run on free-to-air TV in Australia in the 90s, combined into one long movie (no credits between episodes). Not an easy one to get your hands on, but a BRILLIANT series (i give it an 8.5 out of 10 :D ).


"Filmed on South Australia's glorious River Murray, this television mini-series is set during the 1920s and tells of the story of a runaway who escapes to the river to work on a paddle-boat steamer and his friendship with an old salt captain played by Bill Kerr. Based on an original novel by Max Fatchen." (imdb).
