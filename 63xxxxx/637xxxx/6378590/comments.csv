,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-09T18:16Z,"RE: One of the supporting actors in this movie, Joe E. Brown to be exact, how about a REAL OBSCURE title available in the public domain, even on TPB--http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4354106/Earthworm_Tractors_(1936), http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027562/ .  Don't want to waste 957MB of my precious disk space on 69 minutes of Black & White.

But it sounds like a comedy worth seeing.  Thanks."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-09T18:21Z,"Tried downloading the Ogg vid from the public domain but that was a no-go, apparently, and my internet connection is too slow to watch the mp4 streamed without extreme irritation and about 3 hours to watch 1 hour."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-09T18:57Z,"@formerly_azrielle: It's marked as ""DVD ready"", meaning MPEG-2 and strict compliance with DVD authoring tools (I did literary thousands of such MPEG-2 encodes for mastering purposes, while back). Size is pretty small - regarding that factors - and quality of public-domain movies is obscure, same as the titles too. Mark the title, right-click and do plain Google - maybe is some small avi available."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-09T19:12Z,"@formerly_azrielle: I checked on Google, and lot of bullshit as usual.
However, 277 MB iPhone encode and 638 MB wmv seems as available for download.

and download, not watch on-line. Google video has it too, crappy one, but you can (should) download any, not watch it on-line. Your connection (line) speed is irrelevant, restrictions usually came from semi-choked streaming servers."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-10T00:37Z,Thank you--I got the small one in about an hour.
