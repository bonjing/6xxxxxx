This is the Cave from Florida, not the psych-funk band from Chicago, they took the name when this Cave broke up.

They were mildly known for a short, best known in Fl. Its unfortunate they only got 1 album out. But I think they broke up because their live just took them in all different directions. They rocked, they were a straight-up rock group.
