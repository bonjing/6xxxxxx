Safe connections
Internet Security 2011â€™s built-in firewall defends your PC from hackers on the hunt for unprotected targets. The Home Network Manager protects your wired or wireless network from cyber burglars. Vulnerability exploits and drive-by threats are blocked with our strong intrusion prevention shield. And infected USB drives will not be allowed to communicate with your PC.

Safe browsing
Once youâ€™re online, Pandaâ€™s Collective Intelligence kicks in to protect against viruses, spyware, Trojans, rootkits, bots, and other malware. The secure browser keeps you safe from suspect sites, and the powerful content filter lets you customize site blocking according to whoâ€™s online. For gamers and streaming-media fans, the new multimedia/gaming mode keeps you safe without interrupting your fun.

Safe communications
Identity-theft tools like phishing attacks and the notorious banking Trojans are a thing of the past with Internet Security 2011. Emails and instant messages are scanned for spam, scams, and any malware trying to get past your defenses. And TruPrevent analyzes how programs behave, putting an immediate stop to any application that tries to download itself and attack your PC from the inside.

And that's not all
The new remote access tools lets you tap into your PC from anywhere. And no matter if you spill coffee on your PC, your children delete vital work files, or your laptop is stolen, the integrated online backup ensures that your data is thoroughly scanned, then safely and securely stored where only you can retrieve it â€“ any time you need it.
