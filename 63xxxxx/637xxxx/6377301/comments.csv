,hakuna_matata,2011-05-11T12:19Z,"THANKS FOR Smaller Size.. Scrubed release.. no point downloading the 2.3Gb extra empty data. and secondly, isnt it better to have .WBDS file instead. its generally even smaller."
,simonserenade,2011-05-17T14:47Z,Does the sound work after level 2 on this one?
,Anonsen,2011-05-18T22:47Z,"@hakuna_matata, for wbds files, don't you need to convert them anyway if you're using UBS GX loader? I've got a copy of metroid that I can't get to work because it's in this format, and I can't convert it unless I upgrade to snow leopard (mac). 

Cheers flat for the upload."
,WiiNerd,2011-05-20T04:20Z,Thanks for the upload works great with USBloader GX
,benji_z123,2011-06-05T13:02Z,sound does stuff up after dead mans chest set of levels.. but all you do is exit game and go back in and its all good again. Hope it helped... great torrent btw

You just have to transfer the files to Fat32 partition of your harddisk and Wii-Flow loads it. it is so much better to use wbfs then .iso files. So much less activity on harddisk and saves the much needed space bcoz i dont need much larger hdd anyways.

Also, you can just use your friends pc and by using wii-backup-manager transfer the files to harddisk."
