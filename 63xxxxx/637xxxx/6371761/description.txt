Wild Beasts release their third full length, entitled Smother. Their 2009 album Two Dancers was critically acclaimed and even earned them a nomination in the prestigious Mercury Awards. A year and a half later, Smother reveals a much more mature band. They've kept their distinct sound intact: oscillating falsetto and baritone vocals, lyrical wit, and a penchant for seedier topics. However, this album incorporates rich electronic textures and a subtlety of melody not heard in their earlier work. Wild Beasts fans will not be disappointed.
