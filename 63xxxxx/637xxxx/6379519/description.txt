Emalkay has gone from strength to strength with a series of heavyweight tracks that includes the phenomenal When I Look At You and recent smash Crusader. Comprised of 11 tracks, Eclipse is a bold and powerful album encapsulating perfectly everything that makes Emalkay such a prodigious talent, effortlessly showcasing the depth and diversity of his sound while always remaining true to his inimitable style. As addictive as it is hard hitting, the album doesnt just provide a collection of dancefloor tracks, but a confident and coherent artistic statement.
