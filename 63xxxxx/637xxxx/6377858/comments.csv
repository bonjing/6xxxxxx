,midnightculture,2011-05-09T11:15Z,"Jiminy, you namecalling 13 year old bedwetter you are obviously to dumb to understand that in order to seed, one has to complete a download first, which means we are all leechers before we seed for a while after a release, including yourself .... now go sit in the corner with a cheesegrater  and please remove yourself from the genepool. it's idiots like you that spoil the mood on the net. the world is better off without your kind. seriously. you are adding NOTHING to the experience. save us the bandwith and leave. NOW !"
,Jiminy12,2011-05-09T11:46Z,"Midnightculture are you actually serious? I'm not sure if you are or not. I'm not talking about the seeder count. You can begin uploading as soon as you have a bit of data from that file. It doesn't need to be finished you nub.

Go and learn how bit torrenting actually works and then shove your head up your ass. 
"
,decifear,2011-05-09T12:04Z,"@midnightcultre
actually, as soon as you have donwloaded even the smallest part of the torrent (with in reason of course) you become a seeder. due to the fact I live in Australia, I get pretty slow speeds, and occaisionaly end up uploading more than i have downloaded before the torrent even finishes. so understand yourself informing someone else that ""they are too dumb to understand'."
,scylla91,2011-05-09T12:57Z,thks man !
,phattsao,2011-05-09T13:14Z,"You're not a ""seeder"" until you have 100% of the file, no matter how hard you think otherwise"

,emhanser,2011-05-09T17:49Z,Thanks;)
,soupcip,2011-05-09T17:58Z,"Indeed, you are NOT a seeder if you upload the portion you have downloaded sofar, that just makes you an uploader. A SEEDER is one who completed the file, and then continues uploading. A leecher is one who stops the uploading when the file is completed or one who doesnt upload at all.
So yes , we are all uploaders if our file is not yet completed, and we become either a seeder when we continue after completion, or a leecher when we stop uploading at that time. Offcourse when you don't upload at all you are a leecher period lol.
Ow and thanks eztv, this upload rocks :)"
,soupcip,2011-05-09T20:44Z,claudiu you simple f#ckface. Go and advertise your spam elsewhere. I can download at 50 mb/s fine without youre spam software. don't go for it people.

,ShivAsmodaeus,2011-05-09T23:02Z,"@Jiminy12: Seeding is a courtesy, and people often don't extend courtesies when it's demanded of them.  Shrieking like a limbless retard will not help your case, as fundamentally righteous though it may be.

Given that this is fairly simple logic that any speech-capable monkey would be able to comprehend, I'll merely assume you're a big whiny bitch that, for some unexplained reason, thinks his opinion matters.   Frankly, your time would be much better spent shutting the fuck up."
,GATORBATE,2011-05-10T01:18Z,I THANKYOU GRACIOUSLY!! I JUST CANT WAIT TIL THEY START MINGILING WITH THOSE UNHUMANNOIDS ON THE OTHSIDE!
,Jiminy12,2011-05-10T07:24Z,"@ ShivAsmodaeus Why even bother mentioning courtesy with a comment like that. And the fact you have used the word logic like you actually think your post contains some is laughable.

 The fact is, the vast majority download and don't upload at all and this is what slows down bit torrents. Instead of spreading shit information around so our torrents remain slow, we could actually spread the right information and have them speed up.

There is no difference between uploading part of a file or part of a full file. You are still uploading that file and you are still adding your bandwidth to the cause. This is seeding.
Just because you torrent software doesn't say the word ""seeding"" until the file is 100% doesn't mean you are not seeding before then you morons."
,Pheenthlye,2011-05-10T12:34Z,"Battle of the bored seeders/uploaders or whatever you call it?
