A Change in the Willows

From BBC Radio 4. Written by Ian Buchan; Full cast dramatisation.

Toad is back on a spending spree and dismissive of his friends - until he needs their help for a rather irritating ghost problem! Ratty finds himself flooded out of his river side home by rising river levels.

Mole tries to understand the link between the pang in his stomach and the desire all animals have to be amongst their own kind. And good old Badger is upset that nobody listens to him and his friends take him for granted.
