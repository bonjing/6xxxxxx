,CashBailey,2011-05-09T00:37Z,Devin is the greatest musician in the world. Please buy his records. Or a t-shirt.
,Raithfyre,2011-05-09T00:45Z,"Agreed. I should actually go add that into the description. I'll be buying both records as soon as they're out, and then the mythical boxset too."
,danabo,2011-05-09T01:43Z,"Thanks for the upload. Great pre-view. The mp3 doesn't do Dev's music justice, or any music in fact, but at least it's good enough to ease the waiting for the official release. All hail the new flesh..."
,sh0tgunfacelift,2011-05-09T01:47Z,"Thanks for the upload, Only downloaded track 8, I'm not a townsend fan but i'm a fan of those being featured on Track 8. So I won't be buying this just jamming track 8."
,Raithfyre,2011-05-09T03:05Z,"Mhm, glad you enjoyed it too! I can't wait for the full release and all that. And hey, last commenter, if you happen to see this: You really oughta check out the rest of the album; there's a good chance you'd like it, I think. All hail the new flesh indeed."
,vlangjahr,2011-05-09T23:39Z,Thanks for the upload! Truly amazing album.
,chimairacle,2011-05-14T15:52Z,"This album is amazingggg. Dev doesn't have a problem with people downloading his stuff but he's still barely making a living off what he does and all his stuff is truly worth every dollar. Going to preorder this and Ghost, and definitely get the boxset when it's released too. :)"
,D4rklight,2011-05-18T09:41Z,"already preordered this and Ghost, but can't wait another month!"
,opeth49,2011-05-24T19:55Z,"I downloaded this but the quality does not give it justice I think. This is definitely an album worth buying.

Devin puts a lot of work into what he does. You can tell by the making-of videos of this release on youtube. If you download this, I suggest you consider paying back a little by buying the disc, a shirt or attending a show. His facial expressions alone are worth the price of the ticket. 

Thanks for the upload!"
,Raithfyre,2011-05-25T19:47Z,"I certainly agree with everyone that's said you should go out and buy the disc - I know I sure will be. I uploaded this because it was floating around on a private torrent site and my friend nabbed it for me, and I figured I'd open it to the masses. I feel kinda bad now, given Dev's reaction, but I guess it's too late. All we can really do, I think, is make sure we show the man how much we love and appreciate him and his music by buying it as soon as we can. June 20/21st. Be there."
