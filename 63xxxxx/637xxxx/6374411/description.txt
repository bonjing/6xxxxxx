How to install:

1. Unpack with 7-zip/WinRAR to your game folder
and rename or replace VOICE file (~195 Mb) with this one (~765 Mb).
2. Run game.
3. Ignore message (press "Yes" if you have this one):

There will be no voice or sound effects because the system does not support ADPCM files. Do you wish to continue? (CODE =0:0)



It's done now. Relax.

WARNING! This pack also contains SE file that brings sounds in the game menu (buttons click etc.) you needed to unpack it too and replace SE (~17.5 Mb) with this one (~69 Mb).
If it does not work... then Your system is truly hard to play PCM:(
I try(ed) different versions of msadp32.acm and others codecs on Win XP different locales (with and without SP's)- it doesn't work on my system. That's why the Voice Pack is here.
