,heatgirl,2011-05-07T10:42Z,"If you want to know if it will work on a ps3 with that STUPID protection thing this is an easy way to find out.
Step 1 - go to IMDB, type the movie in.
Step 2 - Scroll down to COMPANY CREDITS and click SEE MORE.
Step 3 - Read the Production Companies and Distributors. If you cannot see SONY, under any of those headings, your scott free. it only effects Sony movies."

@ Kikee_31 -  I hope this will help to find your answer :
""R5 or R5.Line
R5 releases differ from normal releases in that they are a direct Telecine transfer of the film without any of the image processing. They take the information from the DVD disc and sync it to an English version of the film, usually a previously released version. Which means that the sound often isnâ€™t as good as DVDRips. In some cases, R5 DVDs may be released without an English audio track, requiring pirates to use the direct line audio from the filmâ€™s theatrical release. In this case, the pirated release should be tagged with â€œ.LINEâ€ to distinguish it from a release with a DVD audio track."""

I know there are times when i rate 10/10 but thats just cuz i didnt have any  problems on my small screen and couldnt find any thing lacking in my viewing experience, BUT i dont see how anyone could have anything bad to say about this UL, (even the little nit-pickers).  
I boldly rate A=10
