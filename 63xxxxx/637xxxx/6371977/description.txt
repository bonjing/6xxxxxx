Originally written in German, this unique "cookbook" was founded upon scientific principles encompassing physics and medicine. Therefore, much care and attention was necessary in translating this very important work for the benefit of layperson and professional alike.
Dr. Budwig _ scientist, author and lecturer, has spent more than half of her 85 years explaining her simple truth to the world _ how highly unsaturated essential fatty acids (like those found in flax oil), when combined with high qualÂ¬ity protein (which makes essential fats easily soluble), will counteract toxic and poisonous accumulations in all tissue.
Her flair in preparing food is an extension of her scientific discoveries and will inspire many as they get a sense of this amazing woman's enthusiasm - her zest for life. The very young and not so young _ the athlete as well as the conva-lescing _ will benefit greatly by adhering to the simple reg-imens outlined within these pages.
Hippocrates wrote, "...let food be your medicine!" ...Dr. Budwig shows us how!
