You donÂ´t happen to have a japanese flick called ""H-man""?
Saw it as a kid in the 60Â´s in the States..."

,chloro2008,2011-05-09T05:42Z,"I don't write often, brother, but every day I come to take a look at the last gem you found. The Vapor Man a/k/a The H-Man was the last movie from Inoshiro Honda that I was totally unable to find. So thanks. 
And I owe you a lot. Sometimes, it doesn't take much to get someone back on the right path, like...huh...Tobor the Great! Thanks again. You really make life less difficult to a lot of people. God Bless you and take care, my friend.
