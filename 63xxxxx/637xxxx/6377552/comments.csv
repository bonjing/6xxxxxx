,brister417,2011-05-09T05:55Z,Downloading and will seed but what's with the files broken up? New to this so just trying to get an understanding on how some downloads are setup. Thanks!
,chair_tard,2011-05-09T05:59Z,"heh... for realz, thx torrentzone"
,Mabcreg,2011-05-09T06:01Z,Will seed as well. Crossing my fingers that it's real.
,Farmer-John,2011-05-09T06:04Z,finally the real deal took forever tonight.
,chair_tard,2011-05-09T06:04Z,"some one is going to tell you there is a reason for breaking a file up into rars... but really this is a throwback from usenet, where stuff degrades, so breaking into rars with par2 files is essential. With torrents, it tends to work against the torrent, because once downloaded, no one keeps seeding the split files, and the torrent suffers. Truly, there is no reason to do this with torrents because torrents have built in fixes... here's a good write up that some posters just ignore... but we love themselves anyway:

,jeeaar,2011-05-09T06:05Z,"To watch the video just extract the first file with winrar, it'll give you an AVI file."
,funkAdub3,2011-05-09T06:06Z,".r1, and on files are RAR files.  A compression tool (WinRAR for example) is used which splits up the info into sections and compresses it.  helps for faster uploading and downloading usually.  Be hesitant though if you see a password protected one... those are usually bs fake stuff, remember who you d/l from and keep track of the good ones.  Torrentzone has never steered me wrong. Keep up the good work "

,shweetboet,2011-05-09T06:19Z,"for the broken up files/rar files use 7zip or winrar to make them a avi file, both are free downloads. with 7 zip once you have completed the download and download 7zip just right click on the first rar file and click extract here and in a few seconds its done"
,Kur1os1tY,2011-05-09T06:20Z,Finally! Will seed till next episode comes out :D
,shweetboet,2011-05-09T06:22Z,I would only download rar file from a trusted source/green skull no virus as of yet
,parteedown,2011-05-09T06:46Z,ya'll know of any good programs to extract rar files on a mac.?
,tarball8,2011-05-09T06:47Z,"@funkAdub3 RAR can't compress a video more than it's already compressed, and no it does not make upload/downloads faster   RAR's are absolutely pointless for torrents.  Worse than pointless, since it forces me keep around these silly RAR files if I want to keep seeding.  Guess what?  I don't.  I do my 1.00 share ratio and it's gone."

,denorfolk,2011-05-09T07:10Z,SEED! Game of Throne torrents are always the slowest!!
,chair_tard,2011-05-09T07:21Z,"@Benishdamenish
not a big deal, but unnecessary... and frankly, kind of annoying. The uploader wastes time splitting the rars (again, for no good reason whatsoever), and the downloaders must then waste time unraring. And once the file is concatenated, how many are going to keep the split files around? No one... which means the torrent will suffer."
,drarkan,2011-05-09T07:52Z,Why split the files??? People shouldn't have to extract the files on a torrent! Not downloading any split files!
,fnrandom,2011-05-09T08:24Z,"Too funny, so much whining. Download it or not, but don't complain about free content."
,g0dsize,2011-05-09T08:33Z,"RARing uploads is oldschool & no longer necessary, especially for avi files, where there's little/no compression possible [avi files are by their very nature already compressed files].  Typically, when someone downloads a RARed file, they extract it & delete the original pieces, and we lose yet another seeder for the file.  It's not a matter of it being more/less work -- it's a matter of the file being seeded as long as possible.

Thanks for the upload. Good quality."
,Yellowbeard-X,2011-05-09T08:36Z,"Stop using RAR on AVI files! It's completely pointless! AVI is already compressed so it's not like it makes it any smaller. Any benefit you THINK RAR files give you, BitTorrent negates and improves on it. It's just an extra, unneeded, pain in the ass step to unRAR the file and you can't preview to see if what you are getting is real. STOP IT!"
,dryadd,2011-05-09T09:45Z,"C'mon people, stop whining. Don't like the rar files? don't download it! and wait for another torrent. Shut up and seed!"

,michaelsammler,2011-05-09T11:34Z,"Thank you thank you thank you
Just curious, what is the hassle of keeping the broken up rar files? Don't they just sit in the folder like an AVI while you upload? "
,Groovejet,2011-05-09T12:01Z,The uploader might be splitting the files to upload to a news server.
,phattsao,2011-05-09T13:17Z,"This is the only place in the world where people constantly complain about free shit.  I don't care if you .zip it, .rar it, or make up your own file type, as long as the thing works.  Thanks."

The leechers have spoken!!
@muchaelsammler
the problem is no one keeps rar files after concatenating...  and if they delete them, they obviously are not seeding. Why don't they keep them? Why would they? After concatenating, rar files are worthless and take up space.
@Goovejet
If that was the case, there would be par or par2 files, for redundancy to correct errors. There are none."
,TechnocratX,2011-05-09T16:31Z,"Thanks for sharing!
To the ignorant, ungrateful whiners: This is a scene release that is made for other means of sharing than p2p - if you don't like it, gtfo. If it's not to your liking just leave it and maybe YOU could rip it yourself and upload it anyway you want. Whining just make you look like idiots..."

,oribius,2011-05-11T19:43Z,WTF !? RAR file is not a big deal but where the hell do I find the password ? the txt file provides a link to a website but once you get to the website it says that it was shut down and website is no longer active. very disappointing and frustrating :-( 
,Dinnetia,2011-05-12T08:05Z,The split rar file and avi will take up 1 GB of space on my 1 TB drive.  Oh noes!!! :(

That's because a virus or spywear is hidden in the RAR; always Download straight avi to be safe."

,digprot,2011-05-31T10:14Z,"Please no rars! They're obsolete, especially on AVI files. My mediaplayer has a bittorrent client that downloads the videos, but it would mean I have to copy it to my PC, unrar it, then move it back, which negates the usefulness of having a built in bittorrent client in my mediaplayer.

Also, password protected? Wtf? GTFO WITH YOUR CRAP!"
,weightedcube83,2011-07-22T21:40Z,Thanks Torrentzone awsome ep. If it takes 2 minutes longer to unrar it so f***ing what stop bitching about free stuff!
