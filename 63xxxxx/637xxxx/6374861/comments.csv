,ouldscratch,2011-05-08T02:21Z,This will ba a bit slow to start off but should pick up with a few more seeders. 
,ouldscratch,2011-05-08T04:52Z,"By the way, sorry about the name of the iso. I didn't know I was going to be seeding it before I named it. "
,GRIZZLYFFS,2011-05-09T21:01Z,"It does boot, no more Error Code 5. So I get into install and do Custom Install (I want to start fresh, XP previous install), select the partition to install on and it starts installation but after a few seconds an error box pops up. ""Windows cannot install required files. Make sure all files required for installation are available, and restart the installation."" Any ideas?"

,Spawn1479,2011-05-12T15:46Z,I'm new to this and i don't know if i did something wrong. I keep getting a box after installing this that says that my version of windows is not legit. I did not install (KB971033) like it says before. i just want to know if this is normal?
,ouldscratch,2011-05-12T18:27Z,I'm after using this to install a 64bit version and I have no problems at all. Also used it for 32bit with no problems. Not sure why people are having problems. I use PowerISO when burning if that's any help. 
,Gator420,2011-05-13T23:56Z,I don't have a CD drive is there anyway that I could boot this with a thumbdrive in bios?

,xerox20001,2011-06-04T05:14Z,why it ask for serial number
,ouldscratch,2011-06-07T04:35Z,For some reason it removed the auto activate when I changed the boot loader but if you download this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5621974/Windows_7_Loader_eXtreme_Edition_v3.503-NAPALUM_DiBYA you should have a full free version. Tried and tested!
