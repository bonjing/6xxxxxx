           PLOT: 
                                           
                                                                     
           It has been two years since the tragic events at          
           Woodsboro. Sidney Prescott and Randy Meeks are            
           trying to get on with their lives, and are currently      
           both students at Windsor College. Cotton Weary is out     
           of prison, and is trying to cash in on his unfortunate    
           incarceration. Gale Weathers has written a bestseller,    
           "The Woodsboro Murders," which has been turned into the   
           film, "Stab," starring Tori Spelling as Sidney.           
           As the film's play date approaches, the cycle of death    
           begins anew. Dewey Riley immediately flies out of         
           Woodsboro to try to protect Sidney,                       
           his "surrogate sister." But in this sequel to the         
           1996 horror film, the number of suspects only goes        
           down as the body count slowly goes up!
