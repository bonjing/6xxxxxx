Mobility modded drivers based on catalyst 11.5 Hotfix
Vista/Win7 both version
complete package normaly !
unless you might need xcode and hydravision full package for latest catalyst 11.5 official mobility drivers.
But i don\'t think so.
However i\'m not the author
credit goes to asder00 from guru3d for his very nice work again
same supported products list than previous catalyst 11.4 mobility modded drivers posted here by me few times ago.
Should work fine but might be possibly unstable also as these drivers are absolutely not official from AMD
for advanced users only and therefore try only at your ownn risk so !
for internal testing purpose...
no support for such drivers
Seed asap with me,please while a moment,thanks !
GL to all

Enjoy

cu later so.
