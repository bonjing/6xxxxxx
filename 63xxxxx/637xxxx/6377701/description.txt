[W4F PRESENTS]: Gaddafi-Our.Best.Enemy.HDTV.XviD-W4F

[RELEASE DATE]: 2011/05/09


Genre: Documentary


Description:
This insightful essay-style doco by Frenchman Antoine Vitkine puts 
current events into perspective by examining the motivations behind 
the actions of Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, a man whose 
peculiar appearance belies savvy negotiation skills. Born in a tent in 
the Libyan desert, this Arab nationalist gained notoriety at 27 after 
toppling King Idris I. He went on to survive revolts, military strikes 
and embargoes while showing a knack for playing to Western 
interests, namely geopolitical security and oil reserves. It's no 
surprise many of the interviews about hidden dealings are tainted by 
realpolitik. These personal accounts from key players are a 
fascinating foray into the diplomatic world of riddles, theatrics and 
hidden agendas.


Note:
This appears to be the same doco as 
Les.Grands.Reportages.Kadhafi.Notre.Meilleur.Ennemi.DOC.FRENCH.HDTV.XviD-BAWLS
However ours is an English version with English narration etc, and is 
also complete at 94 minutes (BAWLS is 44 minutes - incomplete?)
