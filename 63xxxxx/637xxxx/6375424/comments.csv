,kalinga28,2011-05-08T14:03Z,"Thank you twentyforty for this .Thank You For Your Previous Works Of Pure Genious .You are the Unique Uploader if we consider about quality regarding size of movie or tv shows but you are brilliant if you consider about the quality of torrent files and seeds .Just an example----
I just discovered a previous movie pack .It had  0 seed  and just 3 leechs .But the intresting part is that i could dowload 2 movies from it .I am not from high bandwidth region .so i conclude that if a download can be possible from 20-40 then it must complete,that is guarrented 100% .But not in the other cases with other uploadeers.
So keep seeding what you got before you request something .I am doing my best .Thank you twenty forty . Long live the uploader  who 1st introduce ""movie packs"" of various kinds and give us a choice from bunch , in tpb ."
