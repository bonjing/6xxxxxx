In 6 hours time, this UL will land on my computer...!"
,bronco3,2011-05-12T05:15Z,"Was I cheering too early? 
Praising the Seeding Hero too Early?
Why did you quit seeding?
I wish we were living in the same house, so I could buy you beer..., no, make that two....! ;-)
But PLZ, make this UL happen...., 
it means so much for so many....!"

Despite being a broadband, it is not really up all the time and it is not much faster either. It may take some time but I will keep on seeding as best the situation allows."
,bronco2772,2011-05-15T03:21Z,Congrats to the seeder now that you have done it many more will carry on your noble work.  Now just get those other ups seeded and you can take a much needed break.
