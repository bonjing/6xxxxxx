MacCleanse is a small yet powerful application geared towards purifying your system. In only seconds, it can perform over fifty tasks which would take nearly an hour to perform manually. Safely erasing caches, logs, cookies, histories, and more... MacCleanse won't miss a thing and could reclaim hundreds of megabytes of storage space.

Going above and beyond the call of duty, MacCleanse provides detailed information on each item it cleanses, and can even securely wipe files if desired. It is definitely an ideal solution when shopping for gifts, cleansing the system after someone else has used it, or when preparing to sell your computer. Ensure your personal information is out of reach.

MacCleanse also contains enhanced features for specific applications like Acquisition, Adium, AIM, aMSN, Azureus, Bit Torrent, Colloquy, FireFox 2 & 3, iCab, iChat, ICQ, Internet Explorer, Mozilla, MPlayer, MSN Messenger, Netscape, OmniWeb, Opera, Preview, QuickTime, Safari, Skype, Transmission, Unison, Xtorrent, and Yahoo Messenger. These enhanced features allow you to pick and choose what exactly to remove from the application - be it only auto-fill values from Safari or the recent download history in Xtorrent.
