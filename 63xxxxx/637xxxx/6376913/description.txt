                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Richard Hammond's Engineering Connections sees Richard Hammond taking a look  
 at different major examples of technological innovation.                      
                                                                               
 The presenter explores the design secrets of the world's tallest hotel, Burj  
 Al Arab, which is located on a custom-built island off the shore of Dubai. He 
 discovers how engineers tackled the challenges of building a steel structure  
 in the desert heat and protecting the island from wave damage, and learns how 
 a component from a camera flash helps prevent fires in the hotel's rooms      
                                 Enjoy!
