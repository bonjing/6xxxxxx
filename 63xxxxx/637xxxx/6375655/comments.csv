,dark_illusions,2011-05-08T13:11Z,"my internet has been going real slow on the upload ive been working for hours trying to figure out why the ports are opened and everything is fine on utorrent from diagnostics and all on it only other thing could be some1 else in the house seeding something on the network sorry about the slow speed :( 

and its in a rar file cuz i uploaded it once and couldnt get it to work right it said 0 seeders and lota other stuff only 2 working trackers and network issues so i deleted it and when u delete a torrent on pirate bay u cant reupload the same torrent again so i put it in a rar its considered a diff file for the torrent so a new hash check made it uploadable again. 

3 hours and a major headache later tho i got it working being this was my first torrent i uploaded it took some work sorry bout the slow speed and all :("
