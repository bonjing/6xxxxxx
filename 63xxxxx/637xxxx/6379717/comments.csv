,EdoSensei,2011-05-10T05:06Z,"Boobychuk, having not watched the game yet, or looked for the result I can't say for sure but what you wrote seems like a spoiler to me. As if you're suggesting Liverpool won. So if they did win it kind of is a spoiler whether you meant it or not. So please don't write comments like that!"

,EdoSensei,2011-05-10T18:09Z,"pooloop!!!

Since last weekend's MotD you've changed the Video Codec on your files from XviD to H.264 and now nothing plays on my PS3 or portable DVD player! 

Why? This must be affecting a number of people. Please return to XviD files, PLEASE."
,liverpoodlian,2011-05-10T18:20Z,"Someone here on piratebay should give pooloop a gold medal for his achievement. Thanks brotha pooloop, you're just great!"
,EdoSensei,2011-05-10T18:44Z,"Don't get me wrong, I've shown my appreciation for his efforts before, and all was perfect though I can now only watch all his files on my PC which isn't convenient, especially as I spend quite sometime on the train each week!"

both PS3 and Xbox 360 supports H.264 codecs,but u have to know how to encode the video properly for it to play on PS3 and Xbox.
