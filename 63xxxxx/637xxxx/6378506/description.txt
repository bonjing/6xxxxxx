When driving a band with the double bass, Charles Mingus looked--and was--gigantic, in more ways than one. He had huge creative appetites, at all points touched by gospel's emotive depth, Duke Ellington's orchestral breadth and Mingus' own combination of hard bop, blues, and avant-garde styles. There was no one more powerfully multifaceted than Mingus between the 1950s and 1970s
