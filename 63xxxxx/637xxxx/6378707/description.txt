...................................NFO:.................................................This controversial documentary by Roberto Hernndez and Geoffrey Smith openly shows the world the broken and corrupt justice system that Mexico currently has in place.

The Mexican government has just banned viewing the documentary inside the country which means that there is extra reason to spread this as much as possible, join the struggle against censorship, spread the word!
