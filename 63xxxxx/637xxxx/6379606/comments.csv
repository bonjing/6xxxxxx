The crackprogg works in XP good, but not find the file in W7 and buggy so you can only ripp, not convert because then the program ask for registration."
[T],TrettioSju,2011-05-17T14:02Z,"Forgot to say, I got XP-32 bit and W7-64 bit, so maybe it is at bit-problem.
The patch better be re-written/fixed.

XP-32 = OK
W7-64= Rip OK, not convert."
