If you are going to up a competing torrent tibalt at least make it a good one that has the audio in sync. Ill stick with Sceneline thanks."

Well, it's not about the 30 seconds it takes to un-rar. It's about the fact that it's much less convenient compared to a single file. For example: if you downloaded a RAR-ed version of a torrent and you intend to seed AND use the data in the RAR's at the same time, you must keep both RAR's and an extracted file, which takes up twice as much space on your hard drive. Unrared torrents give you much more freedom."
