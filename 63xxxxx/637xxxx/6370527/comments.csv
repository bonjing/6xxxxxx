,Justme1204,2011-05-26T07:46Z,So there's no English subs for the Russian parts?
,Justme1204,2011-05-26T07:47Z,"Nevermind, I realized it's either all in French or all in Russian, right?"

Very good quality subs, perfectly synchronised and excellent translation, they have both the French and English versions + the PAL and NTSC system timecodes."
