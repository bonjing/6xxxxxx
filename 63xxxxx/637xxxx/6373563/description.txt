                After escaping from the alien planet, the ship
                carrying Ellen Ripley crashes onto a remote and 
                inhabited ore refinery. While living in the ore
                refinery until she is rescued by her employers,
                Ripley discovers the horrifying reason for her
                crash: An alien stowaway. As the alien matures
                and begins to kill off the inhabitants, Ripley is
                unaware that her true enemy is more than just the
                killer alien.

                Well, here it is again. Yes were a new group,
               but like all new groups, were old players of the
               same tune we've all grown to love and download.
              We don't claim to be the best, or even second best,
           we leave that to those who have nothing else better to do.
              We're just some dudes ripping our lives away
                     so we can get some porn and glory.
                  Hope you enjoy some of the stuff we rip,
                 if not, well no one forced you to download
               it in the first place. If you want to help out,
                   feel free to e-mail us. And as always,
              Tuesday is ladies night, so all the women drink free!
