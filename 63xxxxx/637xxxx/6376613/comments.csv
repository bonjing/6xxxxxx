,dark_defender,2011-05-08T21:06Z,"Hi 20-40,

I want to thank you for a lot of things you have done and i unfortunately, do not get much time these days to get here and do that. I will every now and then try and make up for it.

I hope for your well being not just because you upload so much stuff everyday, but mainly because you symbolize all those people(very few though) who still do good to other people.

THANK YOU !!"

Thanks for doing Goemon too."
,spiritualiste,2011-05-09T17:16Z,"Once again and again and again...+1...A10-V10...
Thanks a lot for sharing your ÂŤunique-piece-of-artÂť work. We (your regulars) understand the time and love you put on your shares and that's what makes your gifts so appreciated...
Live long and Prosper Twentyforty."

[V],twentyforty,2011-05-11T10:50Z,"@i_am_sid: Never. I've done hundreths of Asian movies just this year. Japan is Asia, don't you think so?
However, Chinese used my torrents for never-ending ""discussion"" between language of mainland China, Taipei, and political emigration. Korean movies are just grabbed and never seeded, and Bollywood produces - garbage. Who doesn't like what is offered, and said, can easily go someplace else.

I am puzzled by your question - because you KNOW what happened, how many times I explained these specific things and you might have pretty good insight."
