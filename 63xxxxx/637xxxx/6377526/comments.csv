Good on you for your first torrent! :)"
,pinkling,2011-05-09T07:24Z,"Ah, good catch - yes, I will try and re-categorise it into Video-Other once I've finished uploading (in case doing so messes something up.)

Thank you!"

But please SEEEEED!!"
,pinkling,2011-07-22T06:28Z,"Hi Leon,

Sorry for the delay in replying. I am seeding this, but with 300+ torrents seeding (12 concurrently), my client does not seem to want to seed this one very often. I have tried setting it to super-seeding with no appreciable benefit.

If anyone knows how I can (with Vuze aka Azureus) force this file to be seeded preferentially to all others, please let me know.

Otherwise, eventually my client will pick this one to seed and you'll get it then. I'm sorry if that takes a while."
