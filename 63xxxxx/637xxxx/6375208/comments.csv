The video is archived and requires a password that you have to get from a website.

And if you even take the ""survey"" like they ask, the file's corrupt."

crashmd, you're making a name for yourself as a lying troll out there. Take it easy man."
,Astarael,2011-05-08T11:33Z,"I agree with arisniam. Besides there are torrents that are exactly the same on other sites that are completely valid.
