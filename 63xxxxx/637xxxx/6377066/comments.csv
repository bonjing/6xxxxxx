Just wanted to give everyone an update. All my math videos plus a lot more, including exercises, are still available on my site at http://www.chycho.com

However, for ease of reference and since I plan on creating a curriculum, I’ve now set up two additional sites containing the math related material. 

1st) http://www.mathinreallife.com – only about math since people wanted a site specifically just for this work. Includes a pull down tree menu and everything cross referenced so that you can find what you need easily. 

2nd) http://420math.com – mirrors everything on “Math in Real Life”. Site dedicated to teaching mathematics and raising money for organizations that are working towards ending prohibition. So if you like this work, please support some of the organizations I’ve listed in the right column. 

Both sites are set up like an online video text book. The video you want to start with to figure out how to find things is “Navigating Through this Site: Finding What You Need”. 

Thanks to everyone who has been seeding this torrent and all the kind words. 

Peace,

chycho
