The following are my math instructional videos that I created in 2010-11 to help those interested in learning The Language of Mathematics. These are the videos for the second part of Series III - "Solving Equations, Graphing Polynomial Functions, and Factoring Polynomials". 

Videos and torrents are also available for Series I (created in 2007), Series II (created in 2008), Series IIIa (created in 2009).
