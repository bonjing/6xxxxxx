
Preface:
When I first watched HBO's "From the Earth to the Moon," I was especially captivated by Mason Daring's music in the episode "Spider" (episode 5.)  So I figured that it would be on the soundtrack. However, like so many others have discovered, the officially released soundtrack only has the various pop songs that were included; none of the orchestrated incidental music is on it (except for the main series theme that opens each episode.)

Eventually I found a short clip of "Spider" from Mason Daringâ€™s own website.  It wasnâ€™t the piece in its entirety (being a mere 1 min. and 53 sec.) but I was content, nonetheless.  And then a few years down the road, I watched the series again. When I got to "Spider," and hearing the music all over again, I was no longer content with the 1 min. and 53 sec. clip that I had listened to so many times.  I wanted the whole thing, dammit!  So I was determined to "rip/extract" the music myself straight from the DVD.

Unlike plain stereo that has only LEFT and RIGHT channels, the 5.1 sound track from a DVD has six discrete channels (LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT, LEFT SURROUND, RIGHT SURROUND and SUBWOOFER.)  On-screen dialogue and sounds occur in the CENTER channel.  Simply removing the CENTER channel should solve the problem.

I ended up capturing just the LEFT and RIGHT channels from the 5.1 signal.  The only real problem was the substantial volume fluctuation of the music.  It would go real quiet during any instances of dialogue/narration that had been in the CENTER channel.  I simply increased and decreased the gain accordingly during recording (it's an analog capture.)

After the gain adjustment, the "First In Space" track ended up just fine as-is.  But the "So Long, Spider" track had one portion that exhibited substantial unwanted background noise (i.e., rumbling sounds from firing rockets on the LM.)  Coincidentally, though, the "official" [1-min. 53-second] clip from Mason Daringâ€™s website (which seems to be from Mason Daringâ€™s unadulterated score) just so happens to be from this part.  A simple sync and fading of the two sources effectively removed the unwanted noise from the DVD source.


Enjoy!
