,Zionfreak,2011-06-23T03:40Z,WDTV doesn't do 5.1 audio. You have to mux 2.0 for it to work. Same on XBOX 360. Nice copy. I have this on DVD but loaned it out and never got it back. I love H-264! Thanks for uploading. This is my favorite movie!
,selmir2003,2011-06-29T19:00Z,V154 audio
,Sit3UserX,2011-11-17T00:44Z,"A: 9/10 - V: 8/10

About the video: Although the quality is good, I wouldn't give it V 10/10 rating. I'm not totally satisfied. For such a big file, I was expecting better quality, but don't misunderstand me, the print still is very good and I enjoyed it.

Thanks for the torrent.-"

as far as the movie its just another anti-white film portraying the whites as racist and hateful. Its always typical to see whitey a cop in movies too as we all know all cops are bastards."
