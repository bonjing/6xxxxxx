A lot of good melodic rock has come from Canada; many for example are familiar with Bryan Adams. This album from Tom Cochrane is another Canadian melodic rock gem. The fantastic hit Life is a Highway is a catchy, upbeat "driving song" that still sounds great to this day. Sinking like a Sunset opens you immediately think Bruce Hornsby. Strong, enjoyable album from beginning to end.
