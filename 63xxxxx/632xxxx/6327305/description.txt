Sunset Mission is the third full length record from Bohren & der Club of Gore. The liner notes include a quote from Matt Wagner's Grendel comic book, which reads: "Alone in the comforting darkness the creature waits. As confusion reigns on this hellish stage, the deafening grind of machinery, the odious clot of chemical waste. Still, the trail of his ultimate prey leads through this steely maze to these, the addled offspring of the modern world."

Deftones frontman, Chino Moreno, has declared this album one of his top thirteen favourite albums.[1]
