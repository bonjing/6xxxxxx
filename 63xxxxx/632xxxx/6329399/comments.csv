i looked into it and you can play for free 'up to level 65' ... umm what about after that?  

you know if you're going to spend all that time leveling up your character, you are going to want to keep on playing, and what about all of the 'real live people' you are going to get to know on your way up to level 65... 


i'm sorry but i can't see myself making that kind of commitment, then giving it all up because the man is going to ask for a monthly fee that i am not willing to shell out because i'm a stingy bastard...heh ;)

good up tho"

The thing about 'free to play' is that there is no monthly fee. 
Also.. the level cap is 65 ;)"
,btbam006,2011-05-01T05:24Z,"yeh I havent even played past level 10 yet haha. I am stuck on Oblivion on my ps3... I dont know anything about having to pay after a certain level though, if anything, like any mmo really, it might just be for special items or something."
,jfkadsjlkjlkjl,2011-05-01T12:25Z,"You pay for perks and expansions that's all. 

But really everything is explained on the site itself...

,nightquaker,2012-03-17T15:48Z,"@alienzerox dude, shut up, it's your opinion. And also, level cap is not restricted..."
