,theblade180,2011-05-01T22:00Z,"I wish FXG was faster to get new movies...FXG is more convenient, but theres another uploader on a different site(Not going to say who or where) who uploads the dvdrips like several months before release."
,finski91,2011-05-03T17:57Z,"@ theblade180 and who might that be ? theres absolutely no one who uploads dvdrips ""several"" months before releases.. R5 rips maybe.. but dvdrips.. is that even possible? Not today.."

,Rob200099,2011-05-28T10:08Z,"I know this is a download site and not a movie comment site, but I think this movie is wickedly awesome, funny as hell and i couldn't take reading the other comments on how bad they thought it was without posting a thumbs up for this flick! O.k. the action is kinda lame and poorly choreografed. But the jokes are pretty good!"
,Dantheman420,2011-05-30T08:17Z,"i agree, its funny. but its almost a parody of itself.

 its just like every other ROGAN movie.... witch isnt a bad thing, except for the fact that is suposto be a SUPERHERO movie"

,GreenSmoke87,2011-06-14T02:15Z,Thank You!! Ill Seed!!
,JazzTrmpter,2011-06-17T01:20Z,"Nice job!  

I do have to say though, that the included subs are a bit annoying after encoding them.  What I mean is that the subs, for example, will say:  
""MAN [OVER PHONE]:
The mayor doesn't want
the article to go to print""  

That's an actual sub from the file, the 4th sub.  Yes, I can see it's a man, and yes, I can see he's on the phone. Thank you very much."
,Kiraqt1,2011-06-18T00:44Z,"Well deaf people don't hear the difference, that is why it says *man on the phone*"
,PsB21,2011-06-25T13:30Z,Pls seed!
,stanDePain,2011-06-28T00:28Z,"rhiannonraia8979 

You've got some front, I'll give you that.

To anyone with half a brain, however, your comment reads along the lines of: 'don't download torrents from tpb blah blah bs bs blah, go to this inferior, non-functional blah blah bs bs blah site instead ... bs blah bs blah bs blah'

At least try to be creative in your attempts to get people to stop using the torrent network.

Keep the comedy coming yeah."
,ariseacp,2011-06-28T20:12Z,"thx FXG.
