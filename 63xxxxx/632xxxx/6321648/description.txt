Qualifying. Jake Humphrey presents coverage of qualifying for Formula 1's Chinese Grand Prix, the third race of 2011. Last year saw German star Sebastian Vettel take pole at the Shanghai International Circuit, with Red Bull team-mate Mark Webber second on the grid, and Ferrari's Fernando Alonso third. The seven previous Grands Prix in China have all produced different winners, with British drivers triumphant in two of the last three races at Shanghai. With commentary from Martin Brundle and David Coulthard.
