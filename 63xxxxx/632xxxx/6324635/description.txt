The Golden Record opens with an ethereal, echoing melody that sounds as though itâ€™s being sung from the altar of a cathedral. An acoustic guitar slowly enters the mix, then the distant thump of a kickdrum, followed by background harmonies and a hazy, watercolor swirl of orchestral instruments. The rest of Little Screamâ€™s debut follows suit, flitting between scaled-down folk music and lush, widescreen panoramas of sound. Recorded in Montreal with a host of local hotshots -- most notably Richard Parry, who shares production credit with Little Scream herself -- The Golden Record approaches its loudest moments like an artsy Arcade Fire, adding acoustic instruments and scant, repetitive riffs into a towering jumble of chamber pop.
