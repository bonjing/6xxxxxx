,head_banger,2012-01-14T22:54Z,"No, I'm not missing any (official) albums. Both ""Carolina County Ball"" and ""Trying To Burn The Sun"" are on the 1991 album ""The Elf Albums"". In fact, this is the only release, I know of, to go with, if you want to buy these tracks on CD, as the last 2 Elf albums have never been released as separate CDs - at least to my knowledge."
