- This is basically just an update of my other RJD torrent found at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6106457/Ronnie_James_Dio__35_Original_Releases_(MP3___Highest_VBR) .
- Those of you, who have downloaded the previous one + the 2011 version of Dehumanizer, won't find anything new here.
- I had to re-upload it however, because, I corrected some tagging + renamed some files, thus preventing myself from being able to seed properly!
- Thanks for your understanding (I don't like these "doubled" uploads either!).


* Please, only download this if you really love Ronnie's work!!!
- Also note that you should buy at least some of these albums!!!
- Ronnie is irreplaceable, both as a musician and person, so I think, that that's the least you can do to honour his memory!!!
* Blessed be the name of Ronnie James Dio!!!
- You're the man!!!
- R.I.P. Ronnie: You rock!!!
