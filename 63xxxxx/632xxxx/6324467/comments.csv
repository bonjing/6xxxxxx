,newvista,2011-04-19T18:02Z,This is a PRE-RELEASE version that no longer works without downloading the working version - that requires a real serial - IOW - this version will not work! Ever.
,4somebody,2011-04-20T03:25Z,"Hello: everything went fine as per the instructions. I installed it successfully on two machines. HOWEVER, I only ave the new routes, none of the old ones is to be found. I do have the new rolling stock however.
Please advise, thanks "
,pc_tech_ohio,2011-04-20T17:47Z,It does work if you block some of the executables e.g. contentmanager.exe with a firewall. One of the torrents lists which files to block. 12 has great graphics but not as much content as 2010.

Oh Lord.
Please forgive me.
I downloaded it to take the piss.
But got addicted.
Spare my wretched soul as I go to CoD Multi-Player and die the horrid gratuitously pixelated  death I deserve.

Amen.

,Laranth,2011-04-23T11:56Z,"See if this helps.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6327564/Trainz.Simulator.12.Nfo.Fix-SKIDROW"
,Laranth,2011-04-23T11:57Z,Block the .exe's.
,Laranth,2011-04-23T12:03Z,"Windows 7 users. If you have tried running it and it quits. I think you may have to uninstall it. (And naturally try again.)

Be 100% sure CCP.exe, ContentManager.exe, Launcher.exe, TADDaemon.exe,  trainz.exe, TrainzUtil.exe are blocked in you firewall for connections  to go online before starting the game for the first time.

http://www.trishtech.com/win7/block_a_program_in_windows_firewall.php

The above site is supposed to help."
,Laranth,2011-04-23T13:11Z,"Just to be sure. I have re-installed from this ISO. Used the afore mentioned website as a guide. Taken the list to block the requested .exe files.

And it works. Remember for each file you block you have to name it at the end ie ""Block ccp.exe"" or ""Block trainz.exe"".

I will come back and check this torrent over the next few days. If you have any problems Put my name up in capitals to get my attention. Also add whetever the problem is, too. lol"
,visaporr69,2011-04-23T16:27Z,"I have done as instructed and blocked all the exe files from my firewall. Still during startup I get an error saying: ""Cannot connect to the Trainz asset database."" and the program quits. Any idea whats wrong ?"
,Laranth,2011-04-23T21:02Z,Did you remember to uninstall and re install the game. If you did try using CCleaner to clear your registry.
,Laranth,2011-04-23T21:02Z,Plus did you do it exactly as stated
,swamp33,2011-04-24T08:51Z,"I got this torrent working after a few attempts.

To get it to work you should be able to positively answer the following statements.

A.  You know what a software firewall is and know how to tell it what to block and what not to.

B. You can identify a ""Private IP"" range.

C. You can identify a ""Public IP"" range.

If I blocked every exe from every IP it didn't work for me either.  I had to allow the exe files access to my loopback and private IP addresses while blocking the public update IPs before it would quit asking me to upgrade out of the beta version.

On a more serious note if you can't operate a firewall and know what it blocks and what it doesn't you really shouldn't be running pirate software on a machine with any type of internet connection in the first place.
You're machine is pretty much calling the software companies who made it and letting them know where to find you and your crappy (i.e. Windows Firewall) or non-existent firewall and all your pirate software.

Some helpful google searches if you can't think of them yourself.

wikipedia private IP range.
wikipedia loopback address or localhost
Any Firewall Other Than Windows Firewall"

The first patch for TS12 is released. 
This takes your build number from 46957 to 47059.


It is an auto-patch so you will be prompted to download and install the patch when you start your Trainz Simulator 12.


You need to have your Trainz PC connected to the internet and your Planet Auran account details registered in the Trainz Simulator 12 client to use the Auto Patcher.


In case your Trainz PC is not connected to the internet, or if you want to download and patch your copy of Trainz Simulator 12 manually, you can download the patch from:
http://download.ts2009.com/patch/46957_to_47059.exe


File Size: 8,634,985 bytes

Changelog:

* Fixed a case where a disconnected iTrainz client would not reconnect.
* Improved iTrainz network stability on some network configurations
* Improved the accuracy of the latency display for Trainz sessions
* Hide multi player user names in the 3D world while the driver UI is hidden
* Fixed Script HUD Thread Exception Errors

,FatFreddy465,2011-04-25T16:46Z,"I have EXACTLY the same symptoms of problems that BillyCZ (the above comment) has. Please help!

I installed the game with no problems, then I run the game, it crashes just as it says ""loading"". Then I install the patch update to 47059, and I still crash. Kaspersky Internet Security (my AV) is completly off, even after trying to block the program, and The Windows firewall is also off. Any advice would be warmly welcome"

,SJCarline,2011-05-15T15:16Z,"Well i must be special cause i had no issues, just before it finished installing i had already started blocking outgoing connections from all programs in the bin folder. I used the windows firewall. I did nothing special except maybe that i didnt update it i just left it as is...now trying to figure out how to use the game is another story hahaha"
,carclah,2011-05-21T12:07Z,guys how i can blow taddaemon with firewall?
,Arni765,2011-05-24T00:37Z,"I have found a solution for offline play,just disconnect yourself off the internet and reactivate the key,after that dont try to play whith internet connection while skidrow comes up with something,i have tried to block everything but those are beta keys and cuz of that it shows beta warning,download and install the new patch manually."
,Arni765,2011-05-24T00:39Z,I know that i have written already posted solution but thats a final conclusion untill skidrow makes something to play online
,Mr.Extra,2011-05-31T07:07Z,"Auran has made a way against pirated serials. If some one tries to register the serial number on your auran profile when some one else has it done it already, the serial will get black listed, wich will couse the game to crash. The only way around this is to buy your own serial number and to not spread it around."
,Keithuk,2011-07-11T01:12Z,Its out of date it won't run.

,johncool,2011-07-31T20:03Z,"It runs... you need to block every .exe in the bin folder by creating rules. Run ""wf.msc"" and create those rules.
