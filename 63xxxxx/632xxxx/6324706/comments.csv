,remoted25069,2011-09-18T16:29Z,Thanks for this great upld. Works perfectly. Fantastic job as always.
,ozzie79,2012-02-03T13:23Z,Doesn't work. When applying the patch I get some Spanish text and that's it.
,ozzie79,2012-02-04T03:21Z,"I give up. I have used cracked and patched versions of IM for 5 years now. Most of my laptop runs on pirated software. This is he first time I can not get this to work. 
I don't know where to put the patches. I ran them from my desktop and also from the bin file in the install file, but I keep getting the spanish comment of the directory doesn't exist and with the win7 patch I get to read that the file might be in use and if I want to try again.

I went into my taskmanager and triple checked anything IM related isn't running.

I think it's time to throw in the towel and go with the standard version, junkmail and all.

Ik woon nu al 9 jaar in een Engelstalig land, misschien als je het in het Nederlands uitlegt, dat het meer helder is voor me. Ik denk het niet, maar aangezien ik nu al 2 dagen bezig ben met dit programma, ben ik het nu wel beu."
,ozzie79,2012-02-04T03:42Z,"I know why it isn't working.

3) Now open the AIO Click ENglish

5) Click Install Plus Licenses 

These aren't in the downloaded files. Can't find them anywhere"
