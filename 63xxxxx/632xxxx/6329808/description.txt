THE SOVIET UNION AND THE TRANSFER
OF TECHNOLOGY
A study of the influence of Western technology upon the early stages of
Soviet economic development may then be a profitable field for research and,
in fact, may change our view of those forces allegedly 'released* by socialism
and traditionally held responsible for Soviet economic growth. No rigorous
analysis of this technological transfer has yet been attempted, although its
existence has been noted within the Western world.3
