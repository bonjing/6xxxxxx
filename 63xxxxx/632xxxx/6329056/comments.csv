,lattari,2012-04-09T00:45Z,Thank you very much. A year after the release and this was the only copy I was able to find that included nordic subs and didn't have the obnoxious english subs hardcoded in it. Thank you for the release and for keeping the something Scandinavian in the Bay. I shall come and check out your site.
