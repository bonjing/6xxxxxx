,shreddir,2011-04-18T06:28Z,"SAFCukO09, please upload the ANGELIC 720p version.  There's a 1080i version upped by Jorrel(?) but my PC is too old and underpowered to play it smoothly.  I don't want to go back to watching crap SD.
Thanks"

,SuperSkyline89,2011-04-20T23:10Z,"skjeggbulbul,
When an uploader puts HDTV in the title is only means it's a TVrip of an HD broadcast, the torrent itself is still in SD. Criminal Minds, House, The Big Bang Theory, all torrents use that title format.

Unless the title specifically says 720p or 1080p in the title it's not an HD upload and you shouldn't assume it is."

I have ""thehannibal"" one, but it's split into 3

1 file is better."
