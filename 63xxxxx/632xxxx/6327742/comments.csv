,enuff27,2011-12-01T23:27Z,"i have never seen such an inconvinient way of compressing files, such a waste of time, unzipping all parts one by one, and then unrarring the unzipped files. hilarious..."
,TuNiSiE,2012-02-13T12:18Z,"enuff27, you can use WinRAR to extract all the zip files at once."
,devanson,2012-03-10T13:22Z,"Not able to get the torrent.... :-(((

I need this software badly....."
,Ianp,2012-03-19T09:27Z,"Bit unusual, but you have to extract all 17 zips, so that you have 17 folders. Create another folder, called mintab or whatever, take out of the 17 folders, the 17 new zips and place in new folder.
Then as always extract 1st zip and the rest will follow."
,huntdilan,2012-03-19T16:07Z,"Thank you very much. Keep up with the good work.
For those having trouble to get this software running you may do the following:
1. Download the torrent first. It takes less than 60 seconds to finish.
2. You must have WinRAR to extract all these 17 zips at once.
*Just highlight them all from 1 to 17 only
*Right-click on them (while they are still highlighted) then click: Extract file
*It takes less than one second to extract and creates a new folder called Minitab.v16.1.1 right on top of those 17.
*Go inside Minitab.v16.1.1 you will find actual 17 rar folders
*Right-click on either one, then press Extract files
*It will take one second again and create a folder called f4cg on top of those 17 rar folders.
--> In f4cg folder is where your software is.
*Right-click setup rar and click Extract files
You will get a setup folder which has Minitab Setup in it.
*Also right-click and Extract the zip file 
During installation you may just press next when it asks you for the key or as our uploader said use anything. I just pressed next and skipped the key stuff.
When done, you don't have to restart the computer. Just go to your hard drive and to: C:Program Files (x86)MinitabMinitab 16, copy the Mtb from crack folder then paste it into C:Program Files (x86)MinitabMinitab 16 then Hit copy and replace.
And there. You are done.
The whole process takes from 2 to 4 minutes.

My daily many thanks to the uploader "
