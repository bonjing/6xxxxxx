,iamthewalrus016,2011-04-20T17:13Z,would you mind sharing your secret how to convert xbox iso's to 360 iso's? Or just upload Fable Region Free.. Thanks!
,frantic_30,2011-04-20T17:20Z,it's doesen't work !
,iamthewalrus016,2011-04-20T17:46Z,it worked fine for me... just burn it without changing the layer break (its different from a normal 360 game) and make sure to use verbatims and it should work.
,iamthewalrus016,2011-04-20T17:47Z,and you need an xbox with ixtreme 1.6 or lower.

,quaderquader,2011-04-25T12:38Z,thank u very much for this and kotor. Is there any Chance you could get us Project Zero/Fatal Frame 1-3? that would be so cool.
,dariuskzoot,2011-04-25T21:18Z,"For those who are still wondering ...

This works perfectly on the latest LT+ firmware!!!

Just follow the instructions, and don't change the layer break settings that the Uploader has set, and you should be fine ...

Burned with 'Imgburn' on a Verbatim DL disk ...

Tested & working 100%

THANK YOU 'yakuzasi'!!!
