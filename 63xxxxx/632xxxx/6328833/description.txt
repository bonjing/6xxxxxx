The story opens in the Gingo Lounge, where you are introduced to Destiny and Oriena, two hot and horny strippers who just want a little more out of life than having men glare at their bodies. During their strip they seduce Dr. Roy Glickman on stage and find out why Dr. Glickman is so down. It seems he's the head of the local hospital and all the nurses are on strike. He convinces the girls to become Candy Stripers. Along the way Otto Ricotta, a mob bigwig, is having sex with his girl friday in a hot tub, when his secretary tells him the police are coming to arrest him. Ricotta fakes a heart attack and finds himself in the same hospital as the girls.
