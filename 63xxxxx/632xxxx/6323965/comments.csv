Blue House contains eight gems of swamp boogie fusion delivered in Ball's supple, slinky voice. Listen to ""The Facts of Life,"" a slow, sensual, worldly piece of Louisiana soul with an irresistible melody. It takes some living to write this kind of song, and considerable skill to give it this memorable delivery. Consider ""St. Gabriel,"" a song that sounds so much like a lost blues classic that you'll check the credits to see what Delta legend penned it. Surprise! It's Marcia Ball. Her covers on Blue House are unusually well chosen -- ""Fingernails"" fits her so well that it's hard to believe it's a Joe Ely tune, and her piano work on ""Red Beans"" does the song proud. And if her slightly subdued performance on ""If This Is Love"" isn't quite up to the energy level that the song deserves, it's one cut out of 12, and the other 11 are stellar. Blue House is a marvelous album with plenty of personality and character, and highly recommended."

Thanks again for all your hard work. :D)"
