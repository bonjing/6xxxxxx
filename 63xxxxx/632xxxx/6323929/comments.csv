It's Dutch, not German, try to get it right"
,general_monash,2011-07-17T04:01Z,"@stijnito, Monkeyjj pointed out something that's useful to everybody who might download this, and that's the kind of comments we need. You pointed out something that's true but useless. You are rude and a dick. Nobody cares what you think."
,Sarmatae1,2011-09-29T00:06Z,"Actually...I thank both of them, because I speak German, but not Dutch. I'd have been pissed if I'd gone ahead and gone to the trouble expecting German. But I agree...these are the kind of comments we need more of. 

Moving on..."
