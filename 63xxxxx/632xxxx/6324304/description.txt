                           DESCRiPTiON 

 New series. Ant and Dec kick off another search to find the nation's most impressive
 performers. The format is the same as previous years, but there are two major
 differences - no Piers Morgan on the judging bench and Simon Cowell is absent until
 the live shows.

                                 
                                 Enjoy!
