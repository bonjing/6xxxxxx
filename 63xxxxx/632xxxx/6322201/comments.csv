There is a bug in this version. Make sure you save a copy of the crack, as you wil have to download a 2.0.0 version from the net  that will most likely be a demo. The crack works with this version also. Bug occurs when you bo back through Blackrock Rd. to get a ship. You are prevented from doing so at the right screen bridge. I copied crack after I got past the bridge, but you can probably copy to file after you install new version. You won't lose any saves either. Thanks for the up. This is basically an old style Nintendo game and has been fun to play so far. About half way through."
