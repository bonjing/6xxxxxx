Description :
In God Eater, the earth has been ruined by mutated beasts known as the Aragami and mankind's only hope against them is the Jinki weapons and the God Eaters who wield them. Players will create their own hero and battle more than 35 unique enemy types to find items to customize their weapons, guns, bullets and shields to increase their strength and stamina. A unique predator mode will add a new level of strategy as players transform their Jinki to beast form to gain a boost in stats and special bullets to launch potent attacks solo or with up to four friends.
