[V],polisdavid,2011-04-21T17:19Z,"Knock, Knock jpmacdonald, - anybody home?

we really could use that last 5% of the data from this torrent.  I've be dying to try out the NMR predictions."
,TGDr-aka-RG,2011-04-22T10:15Z,"Come on, jpmacdonald, please seed this, I'm stuck at 94%!"
,murex8125,2011-05-02T05:28Z,"Jpmacdonald, please seed!"
,jpmacdonald,2011-05-02T14:15Z,Sorry about all this. Reseeding.
,nexttq,2011-05-03T23:28Z,Does anyone have the Registration Code and Serial Number? Thanks!
,jpmacdonald,2011-05-09T17:06Z,All of the registration information is attached in the text file in the order it asks. The serial number is 3 and i believe the registration code is --JAKKO--
,nexttq,2011-05-15T20:34Z,"Yeah the serial number with the number 3 doesn't work.  How does everyone else get it to work and what is the serial number, I need this asap thanks!!"
,cfg117,2011-06-28T01:06Z,"i've downloaded the file, I'm a bit confused about the registration and serial numbers. Any help? The .doc file doesn't appear to have any working registration combinations"
,mosteveo,2011-07-04T20:59Z,"Use the serial info in the file as written, copy it exactly and it will work. Verified working"
,david_pelz,2011-08-25T08:21Z,"Hey jpmacdonald and anyone here 
I downloaded this pirate and got the serial numbers, but recently i reboot the mac book and now i dont have serial numbers. original dmg and zip files are lost 
please can u send me the serial number and regestration code to sampop45@yahoo.com 
thanks a lot"
,aegishjalmur,2011-10-26T14:17Z,This makes no sense. The info in the .doc file is 3 words and 1 number. How can any of this be the registration code and serial number?
,jms_tor,2011-11-04T09:50Z,"Hi guys. The right way to do the registration is:
Name: JKO
Organization:	CambridgeSoft
SN:			3
Reg. Code:	--JAKKO--

It really works!! Enjoy
BR"
