,TheBadGuy05,2011-04-25T16:08Z,"Couldnt wait to see this movie.. loved the trilogy.. as far as A/V Goes, A9/V8.... As far as ""The Master Of Horror"" Wes Craven... once again re-defining the genre... NOPE, it was a good movie, dont get me wrong.. but, with everything else ive seen from him i expected alot more out of Wes than i got this time... "
