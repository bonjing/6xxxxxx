,longdistance,2011-04-16T17:59Z,"Hmm. I wonder what about ""NO REQUESTS ... TILL FURTHER NOTICE"" is hard to understand?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-16T18:05Z,"@rajmxxx: You placed request for Anaconda and Taxi two times already. I answered already twice, explaining why Anaconda has Go and Taxi No-Go.

Please, do not waste my time."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-16T18:13Z,It IS a funny movie--if you can get past the fact that Rob Schneider is in it.
,believenu,2011-04-16T18:53Z,"Ok I am going to repeat this comment for a while(If thats ok 20-40) as some peeples are stund and don't get how easy it is to do..
By the way leeches are blood sucking slimey creatures which you burn off you so BEWARE!

for most of people who are in my situ (I have a dsl line) or those on a regular cable which is open as long as computer is on even if I am not online I am seeding torrent I have d/l even I my sleep I am sharing with others . It realy is, for anyone who does not have a limited internet service(I would say a lot or most in The largest country in North America) easy to share .just leave utorrent running(or whatever one you use) .. check to see if it needs a forced start and go to bed. even if you have laptop.. just plug it in turn it on and go to bed it is simple and easy I leave it there until whenever and I only have a computer with 75Gb so if I can do it...If you have a limit do at least 1:1 .take 500mb give 500mb simple.
At the end of the week when this genus(20-40) does his weekly pack you can add it to his but d/l torrent select none or one you missed or would like to try and the rest would seed automatically..I know this has been explained too many times to mention but come on everyone give me a break .I am a true beginner at this but even I can do it.. 
remember SEEDING IS SHARING. 

ok will try. I need a laugh.having rough week. thank you"
,rajmxxx,2011-04-16T19:47Z,Ok 20-40. It was just request. So please don't take it so serious. I download each and every uploads of yours. Just a big fan of Yours.. Don't get angry

[V],twentyforty,2011-04-16T22:39Z,"@rajmxxx: You should learn how to say ""Sorry"" and to - read, things like:

""AND - NO REQUESTS WOULD BE TAKEN TILL FURTHER NOTICE.""

and probably stop before writing ""It was just request. ""

Please, do not take this wrong, but saying and doing are two separate things. And - I am not angry - I am annoyed by couple of things already. OK?"
,rajmxxx,2011-04-17T05:10Z,Sorry dude. But i am a huge fan of yours. Don't just get me wrong...
