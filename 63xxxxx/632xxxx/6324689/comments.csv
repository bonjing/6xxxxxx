,Pyrokinesis9001,2011-04-19T05:49Z,I didnt believe this was a cam. A guy walks in front of the camera once. Otherwise its near DVD quality.

,kritos222,2011-04-20T02:31Z,Awesome thanks man
,aroyals,2011-04-20T15:25Z,"people keep saying ""can't top the 1st 3"" maybe i need to watch again bcoz i thought part 3 sucked

decent ending but the rest was pretty boring (compared to the 1st 2 but still... of all the slasher flicks the scream series are my fav for the mix of horror with some comedy and the references to other horror movies

as far as the rip goes, i'm sick of waiting for dvd rips, waited for months for ""The Rite"" and it was a pretty crap movie so i won't let the anticipation build like that for this"
,Twist3d_Nova,2011-04-20T16:52Z,"NOTE TO ALL PEOPLE SAYING VID SUCKS:  If you think you can do a better cam, by all means, DO IT.  otherwise, deal with whatever shit you get from them, these people work hard to get this shit just be glad you can see it at all.  selfish jerks.."
,isaiah_123,2011-04-20T18:38Z,i dont want to be a dick but it says here in your description that this movie is 1h 39mn but the real movie has at least 111mn or a total of 1h 51mn.
,Zigakos,2011-04-21T20:38Z,"the Scream.4[2011]R5.480p[Audio]-Extra-TorrenT will be released in 4 dayz !!!

,gnetix,2011-04-23T01:03Z,"Looks okay I guess, but comes out in black and white on my ps3. Usually real telesync vids have better quality. Still, I'm not really complaining. Thanks for the upload! "

thx safcukO09"
,tigersquall,2011-04-24T10:57Z,"not bad for a cam, if it were a hardcore action movie id be a bit more pissed off about the fading in and out of focus, but still a decent effort.
A: 7
V: 5
M: 7"
,renaudparisfrance92,2011-04-25T01:41Z,"Hello
the movie is watchable, but the story is very stupid.

the good ideas of the beginning are soon ruined by the bad acting, and the inconsistency of so many details.

a:8
v:5 with some blurs and people passing... 

We wanted to go to the movies for it... hopefully we didn't"
,crazydog30,2011-04-25T04:06Z,I hope this is a good copy
,SinWindow,2011-04-26T10:41Z,she gets visited by a rapper??
,arielmercoledi,2011-06-16T10:18Z,"everybody: stop claiming that this film is not as good as the trilogy.

i'll try something here.

i promise that i am a very intelligent person & discriminating viewer of black comedy slasher horror.

this new trilogy should not be compared to the original trilogy.  the reason for this should be obvious, & is that it is 15 f'cking years later.

i read a bad review of scre4m that said ~""the problem is that the film doesn't care if we're laughing with it or at it"" - why should the film care?  it's a black comedy disguised as a horror movie.

(strangely it also is a proper slasher - hoho!)


*if you cannot explain why you dislike scream 4, then do not comment on it*

as not to be a hypocrite:

i love scream 4 because of the wildly-creative use of meta-reference during the opening & throughout the film -- the idea of meta-reference is taken to a new level when the factors of cellphones, use of the intraweb by computer illiterates (probably you - think about it - think about 15 years ago) etc are accounted for.

why should the film care whether we're laughing with it or at it?  i'll tell you why:

it shouldn't.  but the idiocritics who give negative reviews to pieces of absolute genius such as this are primarily concerned with making sure that their asshole audience laughs with them, at something else, not at them, with something else.

OR i am wrong and am an idiot for finding this film suspensefully stimulating, philosophically interesting & relevant to the present day.

and if i am wrong, it is your responsibility to tell me.  so i expect well-thought-out responses from anyone who has spoken of this film negatively.  or i expect them to shut the fuck up & watch their back, because:

5cream & s6ream are going to be made, it's official and,

what would be a better scream 5 than a film based off of the actual ghostface murders of victims who insulted scream 4 without justification?  by now, it should be obvious that there are fans out there who are hardcore enough to die for scream 5 & 6 to be made.

and it's going to happen, perhaps in the way i've described, based off real events.

so the way for you fucking naysayers to remove yourselves from the victims list (don't imagine you can't be found thru intraweb then boeing'd in real life) is to apologize or to explain why this film is not the brilliant piece of black comedy slasher horror that many believe it to be.

this isn't a comedy.

it's a horror movie.

people live.

people die."
