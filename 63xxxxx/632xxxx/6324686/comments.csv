These douche bags are shooting .408 and .50 cal. rifles without the slightest kick. If your gonna make a movie about sniping you should at least make it look a little realistic. One guy gets shot in the chest with a .408 like 6 times and just keeps walking toward the sniper. And no he's not wearing a vest (like it would matter). These asshole might as well just yell bang real loud. It would have more effect. Of course if it was Chuck Norris yelling bang it would be extremely devastating! Spending and hour and a half jerkin your gerkin will be more fulfilling than watching this piece of crap pathetic excuse of a movie. What a shame. Sniper movies have such good potential, but we're usually left with this exact kind of garbage. At least we got Shooter."
