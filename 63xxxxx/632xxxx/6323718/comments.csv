,ilsennodipoi,2011-04-17T22:02Z,@luke_zx6r: It's no good uploading a torrent if you don't intend to seed.
,luke_zx6r,2011-04-18T09:58Z,"true, apologies all, i'm trying!

i'm having serious mobo issues 
(unexpected unscheduled unproductive reboots).

:("
,ilsennodipoi,2011-04-18T15:02Z,"@luke_zx6r: Accidents will happen (or so Elvis Costello tells us), so don't think of it as complaining. I was just afraid that you didn't understand how torrents work."
,ilsennodipoi,2011-04-20T19:29Z,I'll help you seed 'til we get some more seeders!
,Segofam,2011-04-23T01:53Z,There are a few peers but no seeders! Would some people open up their upload speeds for a while if you have some spare Gigs!?
,taieth,2011-04-24T08:48Z,"Thank you heaps!  I am letting it seed a fair bit, in appreciation.  Have uploaded 11gb so far since I added it on the 21st.  Sorry it's not a huge amount, as sometimes I need to cap it to 60kb/s to play my mmorpg."
,FINGERMOUSE,2011-06-22T16:36Z,"nice upload my kids love this, just what happened to 24 and 34 ???? "
,xposya,2011-08-07T10:38Z,"yes, what happened to the missing two episodes? i cant find them anywhere 24 & 34"
[V],matimike,2011-09-16T17:04Z,"a/v 10
my kids thank you"
,vespadelus,2012-06-04T06:06Z,"Thanks for the upload, although it is cropped to aspect ratio 4:3. Quality of video is average up to episode 33 and then becomes really good from Ep 35 onwards. Still best torrent out there if you want (almost) all of the series...."
