[V],IndexTrance,2011-04-17T19:30Z,"They just vanished .. So i just didn't do the rest after .. 

I've started splitting them and finished the first CD until i realized that i do not have the time for this .. 

Sorry but i will concentrate on the radioshows now instead with a busy summer coming up ..

Take Care!"
