When you are up to your ass in alligators, it is hard to remember that the original objective was to drain the swamp.  Similarly, when the objective is to watch a movie that you cannot afford to see in a theatre, you tend to care not whence the source cometh.  Considering the multitudinous and time-consuming hoops one must jump through in order to utilize the free links at 300mb--I refuse to fault YIFY for saving me the time and trouble.  One would expect a purist such as yourself to have multiple pages of original encodes, but I notice that you--surprise, surprise--haven't done any torrents at all."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-16T06:21Z,"(shame on me) I notice they have posted a link to a PPVrip of I Am Number Four.  Mr. YIFY, a small request, please."

,skull-shaker,2011-04-16T10:36Z,people the whole point of my comment was the fact yifi doesnt give credit to the people that encose these movies other sites would kicj his ass off for not posting the original encodes details
