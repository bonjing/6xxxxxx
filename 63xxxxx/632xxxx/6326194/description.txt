This is the "S&M" live album, with the recording of the 21 / 22 04 1999 concert at Berkeley Community Theatre in California, performed by the band Metallica with accompaniment of The San Francisco Symphony Orchestra conducted by maestro Michael Kamen. It was released released only on DVD, but I've extracted it to mp3

===============================================================================

I've semi-remastered all of the tracks by adjusting the volume or making them lauder where it needed to be done [fuck the dynamics!]. And that's without sound quality lost because I did not use some quick automatic normalization option but instead of that I used my senses and expierience. I have also cleaned the tracks from any clicks / pops / pitches / glitches that would have been otherwise hearable on moderate volume on speakers. The transitions between the tracks there are smooth [that means there are no gaps between the tracks]
