While most people try to avoid drama, todayâ€™s guests not only embrace it, they admit they create it! Kellyâ€™s friends say chaos follows the 34-year-old. In two incidences, Kelly was hauled off by police or security personnel following an argument or confrontation. How does her on-again, off-again boyfriend, Clarence, handle chaotic Kelly? Then, Alyssa, 21, is not shy about saying sheâ€™d rather get physical than argue. Once punching another driver in the face, and even pulling a screwdriver on a girl in a fight, Alyssa says she is a drama queen, and sheâ€™s proud of it. Then, Todd, 41, says heâ€™s always in a rush and everybody else is just in his way. Will Kelly, Alyssa and Todd learn how to take their chaotic energy and turn it into something productive?
