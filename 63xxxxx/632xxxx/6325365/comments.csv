,Rawrrrrr,2011-04-18T03:35Z,"^ weird my name is Darren and my last name starts with H... But I don't really enjoy 2009 so as similar as our names might be, we are most certainly different. I'm guessing this is the new episode Back to Cool, since eztv uploaded e15 as Tiegs for Two, the last one... Taking my chances."
,wullie7362,2011-04-18T04:33Z,Thanks eztv..good rip!
,neil_man,2011-04-18T06:58Z,Thanks a Lot Bro......ď
,henry76,2011-04-18T10:54Z,Thanks :)
,MarieDesu,2011-04-18T11:03Z,"This is actually episode 15, ""Brothers & Sisters"". But with all the fakes circulating around I'm sure it helps to call it the most recent episode. I don't blame you. 
When DLing from you I will assume every Family Guy episode is titled one episode in advance. 
Works for me.

Anyways, good upload, good quality."

,spunkedunken,2011-04-18T16:26Z,"who the hell votes eztv down, seriously, get a life"
,Screamokid,2011-04-19T04:09Z,"@spunkedunken - That was kind of a gay comment... they clearly do have lives, more than that of someone who cares how many down votes a good ripper guy has...

I do agree with you though, voting down is a little silly, kinda have been slipping"
,jerma88,2011-04-19T14:52Z,"Great episode and quality!
V/A 10/10"
,dlarrym1111,2011-04-20T09:32Z,"GREAT upload, but the Title is actually the title of last weeks new season 9 episode. This one is ""Brothers and Sisters"". Its all good, eztv has def earned the right to mis label an episode. He/She has a LONGGG history of consistently great uploads. No complaints here."
,macbookpro13,2011-04-20T11:35Z,"If you want this very same episode, but with the correct title, download this one - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6331373/Family_Guy_S09E15_-_Brothers__amp__Sisters_%5BMBP13_

Otherwise stop complaining :)"
,spunkedunken,2011-04-21T09:29Z,"@ screamokid so you think it's good of them to vote down one of the best seeders? Look who's talking...

bad comment"
,aParadox,2011-04-23T03:42Z,"First off- Same amazing quality and quick upload time, as always many thanks for keeping up a high standard of uploading!.

I think it would help if eztv used the nomenclature that the rest of the internet uses- The main resource sites for production dates, production codes, air dates, and titles, all label this Season 9, episode 15, ""Brothers & Sisters""

To deny the simple fact that those who produce Family Guy themselves have set the production code for this episode as ""8ACX15"" should pretty much be all that you need to stop this arguing!
Honestly, go to the source- if you can't number episodes the way the six executive producers of Family Guy choose to do specifically, why even try?"
,jimmybgoode,2011-04-24T04:35Z,good copy:) thanks eztv
,rebel7777,2011-04-24T10:04Z,"@ aParadox. The production code has nothing to do with the airing order, the previous episode was 8ACX16, the next one will be 8ACX20, the 15 in this one is just a coincidence. Yeah, the scene fucked up, it's all confusing now, so if you want to be sure just download directly from the eztv homepage."
,zamack,2011-04-26T14:57Z,thanks
,oikjgbvguiugfc,2011-04-28T20:58Z,"This show f***ing sucks!
It's all just drama now, I want more of Peter and his gang, aswell as Brian.
The shows should be based around humour not whatever the hell this is.

Seriously the season's worst than the cleveland show."
,tjw4rd,2011-04-29T00:01Z,"thanks again EZTV - even if the episode title is slightly incorrect (which i beleive has fallen to ep07/08 during xmas, which prob should have just been listed as 07?
either way, can't complain, quality is always top notch."
