Releasing heavy-weight productions for nearly a decade, has made Irishman John O'Callaghan establish himself as a quality producer, DJ and label owner. Awarded for 'Best Producer' and 'Best DJ' at the Irish Dance Music Awards, taking in the number 33 of the DJ Mag Top 100 of 2010 and proudly owning the successful Subculture record label. But there's much more to come.

A relentless drive to give the crowd that energetic push and mesmerize them with a breathtaking intensity. That's what's been keeping John busy, while in the studio to produce the follow-up to his 'Never Fade Away' album. With his eyes fixed on the future he reveals 'Unfold', the third artist album that's going to spread the JOC sound even further. The third single from the album is the beautiful Betsie Larkin collab, 'Save This Moment'. With the same potential as big hits 'Find Yourself' and 'Big Sky', 'Save This Moment' will take you in with lush guitar, thick, low bass and lush vocals.

To remix this vocal beauty, John asked no one less than globally acclaimed DJ and producing talent Gareth Emery. The UK producer always knows how to give a track something extra. The real Gareth Emery sound takes over 'Save This Moment' and lets it bursts with melodic violence. Pure energy!
