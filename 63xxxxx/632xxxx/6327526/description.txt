The debut recording of Brand X. I've done the entire Brand X catalog, from the best copies I have. The UK Charismas (cut by Ray Staff at Trident) sound a bit better than the US Passports. Unfortunately the Brand X catalog has not had decent CD remastering. I've read that the Japanese CDs use the same masters as the standard Virgin CDs. I've also heard the original Passport CD of this title, and it sounded very similar to the Virgin. They're not brickwalled, but they're badly EQd. I've compared this pressing with the Passport, and the original Japanese pressing, and this is the clear winner.
