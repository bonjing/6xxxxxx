,bert16,2011-04-16T21:26Z,These are just the drivers or is it the entire Radeon package?
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-04-17T03:25Z,"complete package bro ! np :)

more details :

These drivers are not WHQL.
OpenGL is newer, Direct3D and 2D are the same (vs latest 11.4 pre)
This driver is not a part of the early catalyst preview 11.4 branch,(pre build: 8.840.x this build: 8.841) it will probably end newer and better than 11.4 WHQL.
We have some reference of this driver in HERE(http://developer.amd.com/gpu/amdappsdk/ ... ility.aspx)
and at bottom of the page you can read: ""ATI Catalystâ„¢ 11.4 Update Driver (8.841)"".
Nice boost in DirectCompute applications.
OpenCL version: OpenCL 1.1 AMD-APP-SDK-v2.4 (595.10) FULL_PROFILE
99% bug is FIXED.

Build Info:
8.841-110405a-116955C
DriverVer=04/05/2011, 8.841.0.0000
Sign date: April 14 â€Ž2011 20:47:55 (ATI)

[T],Tyr3ll,2011-04-19T10:34Z,"guys,listen to me :
if you are alone on my torrent,it might be more difficult to get the file for you,so in this case,you must absolutely give your maximum upload for best chance to get this one.
And especialy if you have a slow connection or low upload or more so.
Don't forget to make a speed test by your torrent client settings option,thereby it will be the best way to rightly set this one in mirror of your personal connection.
for exemple :
you have a connection with 10 meg down and 1 meg up
right settings in Bandwidth section will be like :
max upload rate (kb/s) : 90
alternate upload rate when not downloading kB/s : 0 (checked,enable)
Global Download rate (kB/s : 0
Number of Connections :
Global Maximum number of connections : 450
Maximum number of connected peers per torrent : 100
Number of upload slots per torrent : 6
use additional upload slots if upload speed "
