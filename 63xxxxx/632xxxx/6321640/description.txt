I USE THIS SOFTWARE TO TRY OUT OPERATING SYSTEMS WITHOUT THE NEED TO FORMAT YOUR DRIVES YOU CAN INSTALL ANY OPERATING SYSTEM ON YOUR CURRENT HARD DRIVE
AND STILL USE YOUR NORMAL DESKTOP SYSTEM.YOU CAN SWITCH BETWEEN BOTH NORMAL AND GUEST SYSTEM WITH A SIMPLE CLICK.ALSO NO NEED TO BURN CD/DVD ISO.JUST CHOOSE THE ISO YOU DOWNLOADED IN THE SETUP AND OFF YOU GO
