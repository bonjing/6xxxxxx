,P2P-ftw,2011-05-17T03:33Z,"Heya rune, if you see this message, post a throw away email addy, I'm gonna hook you up with an invite to a site that deals with retro video things (this for example), and other rarities you dont usually find on the open net.

ANYONE WHO SEES THIS (include a link to a pic documenting a good torrenting ratio and an email to send an addy too, if you want an invite)"
