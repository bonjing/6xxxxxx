,Yskonijn,2012-02-27T18:36Z,"Got the install up and running under an hour!

With a few bumbs along the way. Keep in mind: read the install text, its all in there!

Bumbs:
I also started with PowerISO and got the 'insert cd...' message.

I installed DTools and got the install conpleted.

The activation also went well. Read the install text file. (I do think the install text file could be a little clearer a this point)

Keygen: be mindfull of inserting the request code in the first bar and check the bar for that only the request code is up there. 

I also got a code generated activiation code that was to short, so I check the bar for the request code, where at the beginning a the first few characters from the original text was left in:

""Paste Authentification here""

So I did a bad copy paste. ;)

So I got a activation cade that was to short.

Checked the request code bar that it would only contain the request code and got a good activation code.

I am no PC wizard but I hope this might clearifly some stuff for people who bumped in to some things."
