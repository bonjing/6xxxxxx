KOOLHAAS, Rem / AMO / OMA.
Domus d\'Autore - Rem Koolhaas: Post-Occupancy.
The new \'Domus d\'Autore\' series is dedicated to \'listening to the voice of those who know how to look beyond current confines and have the strength to direct and influence our way of perceiving the city and the spaces beyond it.\' This first issue is edited by AMO/Rem Koolhaas and analyses four recent OMA buildings - the Netherlands Embassy in Berlin, the Seattle Central Library, McCormick-Tribune Campus Center, IIT, and the Casa da Musica - in the light of everyday experience, examining the way they are used rather than their form. Italian/English.
