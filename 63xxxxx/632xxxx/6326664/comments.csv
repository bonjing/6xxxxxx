Before using this fix, I would recommend that you try the suggested Adobe troubleshooting:

1. Set the computer clock back to January 1, 2006.
2. Launch the affected application, or any application within the affected Creative Suite package.
3. Go to Help > Deactivate, and check the option ERASE THIS SERIAL NUMBER (CS4) or DEACTIVATE PERMANENTLY (CS5).
4. Quit the application.
5. Set the computer clock back to the current date.
6. Start the application.
7. When prompted for the serial number, enter the number from your purchased product.

For me, this still didn't work. When the clock was turned back, it worked fine, but once I updated back to the current date, the ""License has Expired"" error.
So I searched and found the previously suggested fix file that was previously suggested on a different torrent's comments. The website and the mirrors did not work, but I did find the .rar on a different host. So, to help others, I uploaded it here.

This is the last thing to try. Follow the Readme.txt in the RAR and you should be fine. All I did was the last step and copied the amtlib.dll to: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator CS4\Support Files\Contents\Windows 

Program works without a hitch now. Give it a go and see how it works for you. Comment if it works or if you still need further help."

,madecepeda,2011-08-11T04:38Z,Just copying amtlib.dll to: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator CS4\Support Files\Contents\Windows worked for me. Thank you!
,InFi[D]eL,2012-03-22T00:08Z,"the crack.bat file is a little temperamental if you install in any location other than the default.

However the manual replacement of ""amtlib.dll"" to each individual CS4 program solved the issue immediately. 

Thanks for the upload.

FYI for those who need to do this for After Affects the file to replace is here:

%%%Adobe After Effects CS4Support Files not the root directory."
