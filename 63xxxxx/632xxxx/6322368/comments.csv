first one ;)

thanks twentyforty"
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-16T18:35Z,"WOW--the original Charles Bronson version.  I don't suppose you would consider encoding some of his other movies, such as Red Sun http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067770/, or Breakheart Pass http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072735/?"
,believenu,2011-04-16T18:49Z,"Ok I am going to repeat this comment for a while(If thats ok 20-40) as some peeples are stund and don't get how easy it is to do..
By the way leeches are blood sucking slimey creatures which you burn off you so BEWARE!

for most of people who are in my situ (I have a dsl line) or those on a regular cable which is open as long as computer is on even if I am not online I am seeding torrent I have d/l even I my sleep I am sharing with others . It realy is, for anyone who does not have a limited internet service(I would say a lot or most in The largest country in North America) easy to share .just leave utorrent running(or whatever one you use) .. check to see if it needs a forced start and go to bed. even if you have laptop.. just plug it in turn it on and go to bed it is simple and easy I leave it there until whenever and I only have a computer with 75Gb so if I can do it...If you have a limit do at least 1:1 .take 500mb give 500mb simple.
At the end of the week when this genus(20-40) does his weekly pack you can add it to his but d/l torrent select none or one you missed or would like to try and the rest would seed automatically..I know this has been explained too many times to mention but come on everyone give me a break .I am a true beginner at this but even I can do it.. 
remember SEEDING IS SHARING.

,sharan007,2011-04-16T19:20Z,i agree with above.As other guys from india myt know seeding using available networs is a real pain here and if i can do it so can you people.The net in other countries can surely not b worse.20 40 has some of the best rips but his torrents seem to die in around 4 days.Im currently downloading falling down from 1 seeder at 10kbps...this is so not fair.U leechers suck

spelling mistake"
,rajmxxx,2011-04-16T19:45Z,Thank you 20-40.. 
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-16T20:11Z,"@sharan007: Just few days back, Falling down has been downloaded 124 times, number is very low, even devastating for me, because movie is good and rip is more than fine, regarding 326MB size. I know how much time it took, to rip, encode and up the movie, one fucking day of my life which I cannot get back... and for greedy bastards who have balls to grab it, but gave shit back.

Other side of the coin is - prevalent misunderstanding how torrenting works:
I have loaded Falling down and see:
-four American hosted peers and one from India
-top one has 83%,next 73.5%, 29.5, 19.2, 17.2 lowest one
TOGETHER they have 1.27 WHOLE MOVIES - but pure stupidity would prevail and exchanging practically nothing - three would never finish. And they have right now more than enough bytes in swarm to finish."
[V],DownTYU,2011-04-16T22:42Z,Bloody Hell! I seeded for a 10 hours. I am seeding it now. Its gonna be bad coz my upload speed is capped at 40 kBps.
[V],DownTYU,2011-04-16T23:33Z,"Hey 20-40 srry but can you plz upload Woody Allen's Alice coz I couldn't find a decent version anywhere. Those I checked are corrupted from 1.32.00. Any size will do...doesn't matter if its not highly compressed.
P.S. yeah I know the shits one has to pull to create high x264 compression.I use handbrake and it squeezes life out of my PC when it gets done.So from past year I haven't gave a f*** about pic quality as long as its watchable."
,neeru,2011-04-17T02:05Z,"seeding it..

[V],DownTYU,2011-04-17T10:08Z,The American a**hole from Florida who was downloading this last night. Go and rot in hell. I seeded you for half an hour. And when you completed you were gone. Didn't even seed for a minute. There were 11 seeds and all were visible to me.
[V],DownTYU,2011-04-17T10:13Z,"@sharan007

[V],twentyforty,2011-04-17T21:09Z,"@hotrod666: Nope , moron. You could ask. I have few requests in past two weeks and declined all waiting for BluRay release - this one. Both 1972. and 2011.
