IF PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO STAY AND SEED 
AFTER THEIR BELLY IS FULL
TORRENT DIES!!!

Last 30 days I have steady 99% of Hit&Runs.
I haven't asked for "great" sacrifice or martyrdom:
"Share with other people, best way you can. (notice BEST WAY... not NONE)
Give back - at least a little.
Exchange bytes DURING the download. Share. 
Do not Hit & Run."

Number of Hit&Runs - increased.

It cannot be forever.

ANTI HIT&&RUN MEASURES ARE ACTIVE NOW!!!

SORRY FOR "COLLATERAL" DAMAGE.

AND - NO REQUESTS WOULD BE TAKEN TILL FURTHER NOTICE.
