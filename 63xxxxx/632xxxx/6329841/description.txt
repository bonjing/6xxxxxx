SOURCES:
VIDEO:scream 4 720p ADDiCTED .... Many Thanks Guys 
AUDIO:Thanks m8ty 

NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Scream 4 720p

Here we go with a decent 720p TS.....same source as our 720x rip but this time no resizing,just cleaned up video.

Source for a cam is mint ...no to ways about it.However it was cammed at a angle and also needed some TLC.

So pulled the video straight and cropped any unwanted borders,also had to deinterlace it and then fix brightness,contrast,Chroma and sharpness.
Audio same as before,cut,filtered,synced and then remuxed.

Some will say why??WTF a 720p TS  ...blah blah blah ..but what can i say "go fuck yourselfs" sounds about right to us All of the highest quailty cams come in a 720,1080 formats and weight in about 7 -16 gig in size.It means when you get a release like this your getting closer to the source files ....hence better viewing.
So if you think 720p ts's are a joke....jog on and move onto something you want.
For the rest ( with brains ) Enjoy Folks
