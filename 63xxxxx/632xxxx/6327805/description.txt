                Comedy series following the personal and professional
                challenges faced by the team responsible for
                delivering the 2012 London Olympics. The decision to
                hold equestrian events in Greenwich Park is one of
                the most controversial choices made by the
                authorities. Among the many groups against it are
                local residents, led by film director Tony Ward.
                Given that it's over thirty years since he made his
                one and only successful film, Ward has had a lot of
                time on his hands to plan his campaign of protest. It
                starts with the arrival of a pile of horse manure on
                the pavement outside the Deliverance Commission
                offices and climaxes with a live head-to-head debate
                with Head of Deliverance Ian Fletcher on Radio 4's
                Today programme. All is not well in Ian's personal
                life either, but his ever-loyal PA Sally is on hand
                and ready to pick up the pieces.
