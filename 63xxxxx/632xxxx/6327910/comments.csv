[T],MelloYello,2011-05-16T10:38Z,Somebody seed this please.  I'm stuck at about 53%.  The 2 seeds im connected to are limiting what they are uploading to almost nothing at all. There is 1 peer and he is doing the same.  Lol so I limited what he is getting from me.  He's trying to finish his download from me without sharing back.  So whoever is trying to download fix your settings and we can finish this download.
[T],MelloYello,2011-05-16T10:41Z,I'm done trying today anyways.  I'll try again tomorrow.  Let me get this finished and I'll seed back 4 to 1.
