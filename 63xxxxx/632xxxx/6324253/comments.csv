,lol21,2011-04-19T15:08Z,"@ SlAiN121 if you say that mkv is shit you really should start to download a movie from YIFY or RiddlerA they do mkv files at the same size as avi files only with way better quality. 
And really start using VLC-Player. Or just install K-Lite codecs. 
Burning mkv files is just as easy as avi files so dont see your problem there."
,Bellfry,2011-04-19T22:32Z,"Hi, My Name is Kurt, But call me Bellfry. Im new here and Im looking for some help on how to Upload my own Torrents.

,ashen77,2011-04-20T21:24Z,"The best answer for the real player problem is NOT to use it. DL VLC media player ffs.

Oh, and WHY do people still burn to DVD's? Run it str8 from your PC to your TV! its a whole lot better. Get a 1tb external hard drive or whack em on a memory stick. Never have problems with scratched disks or crap loads of dvds every where.

Thnx for the up Xzone, you ARE the dogs bollocks(and thats a good thing where i come from)!"

Thanks extremezone for another great upload."
,iamhelix,2011-04-23T12:33Z,"@lacywest:

That is the stupidest and worst way ever to watch movies on your tv. If you want to use something other than a PS3 (which is already plugged in to your tv) then use USB hard disk and DVD player that plays them, or network media players. burning to disk is the hardest and slowest way you could do it."

,Yenrock7,2011-04-24T02:42Z,Don't download torrents from Yangoo. I was surprised today to see so many torrents from him and is DVDRip but it certainly is FAKE. extremezone is the best!
,Powerslave0,2011-04-24T08:04Z,Another CINAVIA protected movie for PS3 viewers.  I am beginning to suspect this is done on purpose. A lot of Arrow & Vision torrents are being tracked by AP2P organizations. 
,PirateBayFanatic,2011-04-24T10:29Z,the video and sound were 10/10 but yet another CINAVIA protected movie..first time ive encountered this >

The movie was okay...til the ending. Kind of predictable. Worth seeing but the fight scene at the end was ridiculous. "

,gnetix,2011-05-06T21:22Z,"@ lacywest, FUCK YOU! The PS3 is one of the best devices to stream media too. Not to mention it plays .avi files without the need to convert unlike Xbox. I can just plug in my external and usually watch whatever movie I want. Not to mention I don't want to use a disk for every single movie I want to watch. I appreciate the upload as always but this Canavia shit is garbage! I wish you guys would start including this in the description so I can know before I download!"
,gnetix,2011-05-07T00:29Z,"Sorry for the gripe. I have had this on my PS3 for a while now and just got around to trying to watch it. The Dark Side took over for a moment :) I know you guys can't tell if the disk has the Cinivia crap in it or not unless you try it on PS3. 

At any rate, the movie looks great to me on pc and disk! Thanks as always extremezone! Just had to use a disk on this one ;)"
,aradiel,2011-05-07T02:59Z,"Cinavia is done intentionally, yes. It's part of the audio track. If you want a clean digital source, then Cinavia is likely to be there.

The problem is your hardware. None of my hardware has it, and it's fairly inexpensive stuff. If yours does, you either need to get it chipped/hacked/patched etc. or buy something that doesn't have DRM hardware."

OK, mentioning the AV quality is useful, but whether you like the film is subjective and is only a guide. But, any criticisms of the uploader are really wrong: he/she has taken some time and effort to put this up for us, for FREE! - so don't knock them! Don't look a gift horse in the mouth!"
,alb0416,2011-05-19T19:27Z,Anybody know where I can find a good free(or trial version) DVD movie burning software? I tried Nero and as I got one movie out of it.

,HeyyStacy,2011-06-28T05:10Z,"Move quality was great, keeping actual movie opinions aside, the torrent was crap.
This is because maybe 20-30 min in the sound cuts out and an ad comes up saying the audio was temporarily muted for my device.
Whatever. Just came on here found another one. Downloaded the copy from Scenetime.
By the way, am using a PS3. 
Avoid this torrent because no one wants to have date night stalled by a muted movie."
