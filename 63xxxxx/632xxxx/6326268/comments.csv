,ReligionPoisonsEverything,2011-08-21T15:43Z,1] I will be seeding it for 100% until the end of the year 2011. And after that- I don't know
,shaumofd,2011-08-28T06:34Z,PLESE SEED
,ReligionPoisonsEverything,2011-09-08T17:14Z,"2] Track ""Desert Of Doom"" shoudn't be here at all [becaue it's from a ""Dune II: The Building Of A Dynasty""]"
,ReligionPoisonsEverything,2011-09-08T17:24Z,"3] I am still seeding almost everyday, during daytime [Europe time zone]. The 0.996 Problem is not my fault- there is some glitch in the fucking Matrix. I can copy those uncompleted files to my torrent folder but they are seen be my uTorrent as still incomplete. Resets, deleting and adding torrent file from stratch, restoring my system [with Ghost] don't do shit. I've already wrote about this on 2011 08 21 and added some external links, but as I can see now that comment is gone [propably removed because it had links to hings like rapid- and mega-you-know-what]"
