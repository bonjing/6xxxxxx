,euphoria4949,2011-04-19T13:18Z,"I can't believe its just 3 more episodes of SG-U then that's it....... forever gone :-( 
All of my favorite shows get cancelled in their 1st or 2nd season and replaced by more shitty off the conveyor belt bullcrap that we already have in bucket loads on every channel! (Wow another show about celebrities no one has ever heard of, desperately trying to jump start their long failed careers by doing stupid shit and trying to act!)

Makes me sad that the TV shows that get to air are dictated by how much money is thrown at the TV channel by the shows creator and sponsors, and not base on what we the viewer ACTUALLY WANT TO WATCH!!

Thanks eztv perfect as always :-)"

Maybe if someone actually bought the shows instead of dl illegally the show would have its true ratings... When it comes to tv shows then piracy is truly shooting itself in the foot."

,countkurt,2011-04-21T19:46Z,"Is it just me, or does this episode end somewhat abruptly?"
,pimpmobile,2011-04-22T06:13Z,I can't wait for this crappy series to get canceled now Sg1 or atlantis those were good they had action and no mention of some crap called feelings like this soap opera manure!

I do pay for it, through my Satellite TV Subscription. I do not wish to buy a $300 DVR, however, nor do I want to record it on VHS. I DO, however, want to be able to watch it at my convenience.

SG-U airs in the US on SciFy (aka, the wrestling/craptacular-not-so-reality-tv-channel) on Monday. It airs in Canada on Space (A REAL Science Fiction channel) on Tuesday. I generally hold off on downloading until after it airs on Tuesday.
I'm doing nothing wrong, but using my computer to make a digital copy of a program I paid to watch. You cannot call the decline in television quality/cancellation of good shows the fault of the Internet."
