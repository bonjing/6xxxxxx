Ya know.., I find it quite amazing at times, how some people are so ""biased"" in their thoughts (and just resort to ""name-calling"").., that they seem to have an attitude that virtually says: ""I've already got my mind made-up.., so PLEASE don't confuse me with the facts"" !!

Also another important point to consider is:

""He who wins the War.., also writes the History"" !!

Yes / No ??"
