
In this video.., Ernst Zundel lectures at the 13th International Revisionist Conference (for the year 2000) in southern California.  Here he's among friends.., and speaks far more freely than in the more formal interviews with the "mainstream media".  Actually quite entertaining !!  :-)

This speech is particularly memorable.., mostly because Mr. Zundel offers his commentary on the (then) David Irving versus Deborah Lipstadt trial..,  the tolerance that revisionists have with other people's point of view.., the growing censorship laws in Canada.., how the internet is (and has) begun to be a powerful "tool" for revisionism (of ALL types!).., and he even comments on his early publications into esoteric topics.., such as UFOs !

The video is 56 minutes long, with a more than "watchable" clarity of about A8 / V7

As always.., after watching.., do your best to "pass it on".....
