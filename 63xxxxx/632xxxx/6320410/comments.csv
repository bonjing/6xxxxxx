Burn the ISO image you downloaded on a CD.
Insert it into your CD/DVD ROM drive, and restart your PC.
Setup will start.
For more help, search Google.

I don't understand you!
This is a unique release made by me, you will only find it here.
Let your brother's friend download it and give it to you.

Thanks for your reply.
Yes, I meant to check if the file I get is the one you are sharing here. The file that he gave me is with the same filename ""Microsoft.Windows.XP.Professional.SP3.Integrated.April.2011.SATA.By.Maher.iso"". But I just want to confirm it is the same file as you are sharing here.
I am very sorry that I couldn't download the file here. Anyway, I check the md5sum for the file I got is ""5af005780b19d3965059534421f432d7"". I am so scared of trojan/malware. :("

Thanks for a great upload! just to confirm with tpb community, this torrent is fully functional/bootable iso of windows xp sp3. It installed in no time and works well. 

I used Roxio Cd Creator to burn this iso to a cd and tried the original Windows burning software on my roomates windows 7 vaio which also worked fine.

If my requests matter any, maybe you can incorporate some basic features that I believe most windows xp users require..
Ie8
WMP11
Silverlight
dx 9
Net Framework 2.0 sp2
Flash
Java
Winrar

Aside from that, this torrent is awesome! great job removing MSN explorer and windows messenger and IE6.

downloaded on a mac ,  mount the iso and burned it with toast (ROXIO).

Installed it successfully on an AMD64bit , (I know this is a x86BITver), it recognizes 3,25 GB of ram (I have 4) -> THIS IS VERY GOOD FOR 32 BIT OPSYS , did the drivers , internet and automatic updates working too.

I will install a 64bit winSYS so that I can have a dualBOOT system.

Again thanks a lot.

6. NO VIRUSES FOUND

You have to read on their website and find the difference.
I didn't use any of them yet, so can't really tell which one is better.

@Goku12c
You're welcome.
No, no! It doesn't mean that :)
+SATA drivers means that you will be able to install XP on your machine ;)
Regarding what to install after Windows, you have to install drivers forr your hardware at first (video card, network card, etc..).
If you don't have them you should download them from their manufacturers site.
Then you have to install most needed software like flash player, antivirus, java runtime, winrar etc.
You can find lots of these programs on http://www.nomaher.com or here at TPB.
