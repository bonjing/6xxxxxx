                       Too long of a plot summary to write here
                      go to the above url and read it :)           
                      
                      TWIZTED/DEFACED proof says region A but the m2ts sample 
                          they provided has Italian audio, nordic/hindi subs, etc.
                               Funny enough the exact same disc showed up two days ago on chdbits.
                           (Obviously we don't have an account there, scroll back in the RSS feed:
                     http://chdbits.org/torrentrss.php?rows=30&cat401=1&med1=1&cod1=1&cod2=1&sta1=1&sta2=1)
                          Now if you check this link: http://www.ibs.it/blu+ray/the-green-hornet/michel-gondry/8013123038067.html
                               you can see that the subs on the retail italian disc are similar to TWIZTED's proof, 
                               with the addition of spanish but there are much more audio tracks on this retail disc. 
                               Anyway, Italia is region B, not A. 
                               We included m2ts sample and pictures of retail region A bluray as well as dvdr.
                               As you can see, the discs are completely different. Ours has tiny copyright
                               writing on the edge of the disc (each region is supposed to have that, theirs obviously hasn't).
                               Our guess it that TWIZTED's source is the same as METIS/AVS720's or at least similar, some kind
                               of chinese bootleg with fake art disc.
                               Shout out to the real sceners out there, and to all the sceners wannabees, 
                               please make sure you have a valid source and don't waste our time. Thank you.
