,Busoap,2011-04-20T01:23Z,"ok ;D i did it ><

Instructions:

Mount the image.
Install Game
Find and replace TSM.EXE with the one in the crack dir.

the TSM.EXE is in the map resources -> transgaming -> C-drive -> program files -> Electronic art -> The sims medieval -> Game -> Bin -> Than just replace the things that are in the crack map 

Then go to info.plist and search for 

CedegaGameName
C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims Medieval\Game\Bin\S3LAUNCHER.EXE


Change the last part to TSM.ex_ instead of S3Launcher.exe
save it
Launch Game

Enjoy!"
,beat22,2011-04-20T19:38Z,"Thanks Busoap

but instead of:

Change the last part to TSM.ex_ instead of S3Launcher.exe

I changed the last part to TSM.exe and it worked

Thanks for the help though"
,Busoap,2011-04-20T22:58Z,"Yeah i did it my way 
Cuz the TMS.exe didn't work for me so yeah 

Have fun ^^"
,superhelt22,2011-04-20T23:51Z,"Dear Beat22 and Busuap: I've done everything im suppose to, except the part when I should use TextEdit, and search for the folder. I dont know how to search, please help me! Looking afford to play! Thnx for your help so far! :D"
,Poeticile,2011-04-21T01:32Z,"Sorry about that guys, I hadn't even finished torrenting it. Thanks Busoap for the tech. :]"
,superhelt22,2011-04-21T14:30Z,"Is there any way you could crack it, and then reupload? This is the part I suck at :/

If you could make it a DMG file, that didnt needed any cracking would be fine! :D

But thnx for upload anyway! ;)"
,beat22,2011-04-21T15:48Z,"To superhelt22 and others,

I did not even download this torrent. I used:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6262574/The_Sims_Medieval-RELOADED

sorry Poeticile, thanks for the upload but take one took half the time if not less.

so if you use that torrent.

Step 1:
Mount (rld-tsmk.iso) than load (B23T-BXK8-P75Q-WP72-WRLD works)

Step 2:
open crack and rename file TSM.ex_ to TSM.exe

Step 3:
Copy crack TSM.exe and TSLHost.dll

Step 4:
Right click Sims Medieval icon and show package content

Step 5: 
Content -> resources -> transgaming -> C-drive -> program files -> Electronic art -> The sims medieval -> Game -> Bin ->paste both cracks and replace

Step 6:
Go all the way back to Content and open Info.plist

Step 7:
Find something that looks like this
     CedegaGameName
	C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims Medieval\Game\Bin\S3LAUNCHER.EXE

Rename S3LAUNCHER.EXE to either TSM.ex_ (as busoap said) or TSM.exe

Step 8:
Save Info.plist

Step 9:
Play game and enjoy The Sims Medieval

Hope that clarifies and thanks again to busoap for figuring all this out!!"
,superhelt22,2011-04-21T17:22Z,"Thanks alot, will inform if it works! ;)"
,zogulusnig,2011-04-21T23:39Z,"What's with all the talk of ""C"" drives and ""EXE"" files?

I assume this is a PC game in the MAC section?"
,JimmyHat408,2011-04-22T14:50Z,"@zogulusnig when you have a ported game from PC to MAC when you right click on the game icon it shows a drop down selection called ""show contents"" within that section there are options such as c_drive,program files, exe, ect, with all the native PC file names. it is actually quite normal especially for EA games to be patched by overwriting an internal file to play without a CD or serial key. twas confusing to me at first as well but then i learned how to read.   "
,JimmyHat408,2011-04-22T14:54Z,so basically all of the people asking for serials or cd cracks just have no idea what they are doing :)
,superhelt22,2011-04-22T17:53Z,"Well, I probabably dont know what im doing.. I 

CANT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE FILE! :L

Thats my main problem so far :L"
,superhelt22,2011-04-22T18:10Z,"No, im sorry, I found it :P

Kinda new at this, as you may noticed :P

But this step slowed me down:

Step 7:
Find something that looks like this
CedegaGameName
C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims Medieval\Game\Bin\S3LAUNCHER.EXE

Rename S3LAUNCHER.EXE to either TSM.ex_ (as busoap said) or TSM.exe

I cant find S3LAUNCHER.EXE
The only one that looks a bit like the same is:
CedegaGameName
	C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims Medieval\Game\Bin\SMLauncher.exe

But it is not S3LAUNCHER.EXE instead it is SMLauncher.exe

Is it the same, and should I rename the SMLauncher.exe?? LAST STEP! HELP ME!
Thnx so far dude ;)"
,superhelt22,2011-04-22T18:16Z,"THANK YOU ALL, WHO HAVE HELPED ME!

I finaly made it, changing the last part made it ;)

Thanks alot, though Ive been a pain for you guys, it totaly works!"
,sarishaa,2011-04-22T22:20Z,"superhelt22 how do u change the name of the file?

,InfiniteSpoils,2011-04-27T03:05Z,"For people who cannot change the file name, the solution is actually very easy. Just right click on the file, and you should be able to see ""Get Info"". At the very bottom of the info screen, there is a box that says permissions or something along those lines. change the account you are using to ""Read & Write"". That should solve the problem. Hope it Helps!! By the way, thanks Poeticile, cuz this game worked like a charm for me. I use a not-so-good MacBook 2008 with 1 Gig of RAM and it still worked, without lag!!"
,Deb248,2011-04-28T02:31Z,"My apologies in advance, for I am VERY new to Mac (OS10.6)...  Before posting this, please keep in mind that I have tried all I could to get this working on my own with the instructions provided by all of you.  I feel like a complete idiot for not being able to figure this one out.  It has come to a time that I need to ask for help...  

I have downloaded & installed game.  Here comes the trouble.  I am unable to change the name of the TSM.ex_ file to anything else.  I have tried, believe me.  Second of all, I went snooping (out of curiosity) on to the next steps ""Content -> resources -> transgaming -> C-drive -> program files -> Electronic art -> The sims medieval -> Game -> Bin ->paste both cracks and replace"" BUT, I don't even have a folder   called ""transgaming"" folder.  

I would greatly appreciate any help.  Thank you again in advance.

,booy88,2011-04-28T02:52Z,Yeah im a bit like deb. I followed the instructions of everyone and infinite spoils. When trying to change TSM.ex_ to TSM.exe. But when i open up the get info window and go down to permission i have no other options than something along the lines as “read only”. Just wondering if there is anything i can do? 
,Poeticile,2011-04-28T07:59Z,"Wait, changing file name? Just click once, and then again after a second on the file name. Simply type in .exe and it should work...

And Deb, if you don't have a transgamimng folder, your torrent file is probably corrupt or something. Transgaming is basically the game folder, if it's not there, obviously something was wrong with the installation. "
,booy88,2011-04-28T11:36Z,Nup dosent work. It wont let me change it. 
,Deb248,2011-04-28T13:53Z,"Looks like booy and I are having the same issue...  We are not able to rename the file because it is ""read only"" and slowly double clicking doesn't work.  I am able to rename other files not related to this game if I want...  Also, I re-downloaded/installed the file and still don't see that folder, Poeticile (could it be that it's because the folder is locked as read only?)."

,Deb248,2011-04-30T15:17Z,"Ok... I was able to find a ""for dummies,"" step-by-step instructions on how to do this and it worked really well.  I used the RELOADED version mentioned in this thread.

,booy88,2011-05-01T07:32Z,Where do i find out if i have admin permission on or off? and deb would you be able to link the stuff you got? if not send it to my email booy_814@hotmail.com thanks

""For those with MACS

Here is the solutions!

when your done downloading this mount the disk in the The.Sims.Medieval-RELOADED folder 

You will need to install the game first. (You won't be able to open the keygen since it can't open in Mac, so you will need to find a serial. I found mine on tpb comment section.) try one of these 
YAF7-QJKH-MNEP-LMNY-SRLD
BP2S-NQSX-8DBW-48DG-ZRLD
JYDM-2WXX-V7E3-RV72-7RLD

Then update your game. You can do that by opening the Sims Medieval (the actual app its in a folder in your applications!) and let it auto update. when it asks would you like to update click ok. let it do its thing.

After that, download a 1.1 crack. this one (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6261577/The_Sims_Medieval-RELOADED_CRACK_ONLY_DiBYA)

open up the crack folder and open up the .rar file (I use UnRarX its free also) take all the files that were un .rar-ed (except the Readme@DiBYA.txt) and Replace the content here: The Sims Medieval -> Show Package Contents -> Contents -> Resources -> transgaming -> c_drive -> Program Files -> Electronic Arts -> The Sims Medieval -> Game -> bin

just drag those three files over and Finder will ask do you want to replace these files? and say ok.

close all unnecessary windows and

- Go to your sims medieval folder again (in your applications folder)
- Right click on the The SimsÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Medieval.app en select ""show package contents""
-open the contents folder
- Double-click on Info.plist and open with TextEditor
- Search for SMLauncher.exe and change it to TSM.ex_ (its in the middle of the length of text one of the longer sentences)
- Save it and close.
- now close everything that you have open and play the The SimsÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Medieval.app! 


its should work!"""
,dusislo9,2011-05-08T04:27Z,"Sorry, a correction in my last post: It did not work when I changed SMLauncher.exe to TSM.ex_, but changing it to TSM.exe instead worked. So try it out. Again, sorry for the correction post and sorry for the weird symbols that occur from TextEditor."
,Required,2011-05-08T04:43Z,"Was Just about to what dusislo9 said.

If you want to update to 1.1.13 just grab the PC cracked version of the patch, replace the TSM.EXE file and the TSLHost.dll file in the main APP. Don't forget to change the line in your ""info.plist"" file again to point it back to TSM.exe or it will say ""NO disc found"".

Cheers."
,NiobeHeidi,2011-05-09T12:32Z,"It worked fine but now...
Look,I decided to save the game.Then,the program wouldnt close.I had to use the task manager.Then it closed,but now there is no saved game.And the same thing has happened three times.Wtf is going on? :("
,naomi92,2011-05-09T16:01Z,"I'm having the same problem as NiobeHeidi. When I'm trying to save it gives the illusion that it does, then when I try to close the game it just won't close and when I try to open options in the game, it comes and goes very quick. When I close the game using the taskmanager ('cause other wise it just won't close), next time I want to play there's no saved game, I can just start over. And so will the problems start over too.

Does anyone has a solution?"
,katniss,2011-05-10T17:58Z,"I followed the crack instructions, and the game launches just fine, but when I get to the menu it tells me to insert the disk. >.< 

Help please. "
,naomi92,2011-05-11T19:30Z,"I had the same problem as you, but you just have to go to the Info.plist document in teksteditor and change SMLauncher.exe in to TSM.ex_ or TSM.exe (just try out which one works, for me TSM.ex_ did), just like dusislo9 said."
,beat22,2011-05-16T09:53Z,"To all follow this step by step and you will be fine,

I did not even download this torrent. I used:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6262574/The_Sims_Medieval-RELOADED

sorry Poeticile, thanks for the upload but take one took half the time if not less.

so if you use that torrent.

Step 1:

Step 6:
Go all the way back to Content and open Info.plist

Step 7:
Find something that looks like this

Rename S3LAUNCHER.EXE to either TSM.ex_ (as busoap said) or TSM.exe

Step 8:
