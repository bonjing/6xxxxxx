Beyonce's London fans go crazy when the Destiny's Child beauty, on her first solo international tour, descends to a massive stage while suspended, upside down, from a wire. 
After a delicate landing, the star embarks on a set of recent hits immersed in complicated arrangements, including the Arabic sound of "Baby Boy" and "Naughty Girl," the chunky, 
hypnotic funk of "Hip Hop Star," and Beyonce: Live at Wembley's best performance, the powerful "Work It Out," in which the diva is at her clearest, jazziest, and most soulful. 
Not everything works. The bottom falls out of "Gift from Virgo," "Be with You" is forgettable, and Beyonce's stage patter needs polish. 
But a Destiny's Child medley accompanied by only a DJ is innovative and fun, "Summertime" proves a breezy dance number, and "Crazy in Love" is bolstered by what sounds like the old Stax horns.
