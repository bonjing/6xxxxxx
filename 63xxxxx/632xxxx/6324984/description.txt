The Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom chanted in Greek in Byzantine Chant by Romeiko Ensemble.  This two CD set contains a complete service, complete with the priest's secret prayers, unabbrieviated prokeimenon, and an imperial cherubic hymn from the Byzantine Erra.  The language is middle Greek, and the chant arrangements are a mix of the Byzantine erra and the modern.  A must have for lovers of Byzantine Chant.   Enjoy!
