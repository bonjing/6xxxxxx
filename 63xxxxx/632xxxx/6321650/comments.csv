,cuntsauce,2011-04-16T16:05Z,"If you can't play mkv, it's YOUR problem! 

Search on internet for mkv add-ins like ""K-Lite Codec Pack"" for Windows mediaplayer."
,Andy_S,2011-04-16T19:47Z,"cuntsauce: You should watch your behaviour and mostly read what you are yelling about in the first place! He was talking about PS3 not PC. That console is NOT able to play .mkv files and your lack of knowledge demonstrates a lack of your ... well, fill the rest yourself.

NickChronic: .mkv is standard file format for high-def video streams used widely on the net. However, you can convert .mkv into .vob and this file is ps3 able to play - follow f.e. this guide: http://hubpages.com/hub/How-To-Play-MKV-Files-On-Playstation-3"
,castiboy,2011-04-16T19:49Z,"sheesh, it's the ps3 that can't play it, not the pc.

google ""mkv2vob""+""ps3"", it's a tool that will make ps3 compatible files from (any?) mkv.

remember, mkv is just a container, the video itself might be encoded in many different formats (like mp4)."

,alectinho,2011-04-16T23:29Z,Eztv thnx man i love u :)
[V],meech,2011-04-17T02:21Z,Or just download ps3mediaserver and stream the mkv's (or just about any other type of video file) to your t.v. through the ps3.  Just have to have a strong network and beefy enough p.c.
,jackcoxwell,2011-04-17T03:03Z,"I finally registered on Pirate Bay and I did so just so I can tell eztv that i've downloaded almost everything I have from you because I've come to find that you are one of, if not the best, rippers on the web!  Thanks again and in advance to all my future downloads from you."
,scothuman,2011-04-17T03:48Z,"My compliments to you as well, eztv!  Always good quality stuff when I see your handle."
,neethree,2011-04-17T12:01Z,There's always PS3 media server if you don't want to convert the file. 
,Muianescu,2011-05-05T08:00Z,"Thanks for the upload, very good quality."
