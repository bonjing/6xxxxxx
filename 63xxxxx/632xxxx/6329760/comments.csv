,lorewill,2011-06-12T18:10Z,I installed the suit with no problems but I was enable to get a correct a correct activation code from the keygen which came within it. There is always been e extra letter Z and the activation code don`t fill completely. Is there anything I could do or any other keygen available? 
,lizardqueen13,2011-07-12T05:08Z,"I'm having the same problem as everyone else. I'm unable to get an accurate activation code, not sure what I'm doing wrong. I'd really appreciate any help."

MBAM finds 3 RiskTools and 2 Trojans (I expect it is just used to hack the Autodesk software). Just remove the keygens and scan your system to remove all the instances of this RiskWare/Trojan and its all set! 

Thanks for sharing!"
