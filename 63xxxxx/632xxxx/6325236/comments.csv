""Film 2011 hosts Claudia Winkleman and Danny Leigh review all the latest movie releases."" ...  ???"
,LJE111,2011-04-18T04:43Z,"Here's the description I found online: For many, the new year means a new diet. But itâ€™s the supermarket rather than the health club that many are turning to, with the low fat food industry booming. But is a life on low fat foods any life at all? For four weeks, Zoe Salmon lives on nothing but pre-packaged, processed foods that are labelled either low or lower in fat. She finds out whatâ€™s in them and how they affect her moods, nutritional levels and her weight, and meets the low-calorie converts who say that eating this way isnâ€™t just a diet but a way of life.

Now the question is... which one is it: the up to match the description or the title?

I watched the first 15 seconds, it is definitely about Zoe Salmon and low fat foods.  Your description matches the title and the content of the avi."
