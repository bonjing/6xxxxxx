,booster616,2011-04-18T21:10Z,how's the movie?
,john depp,2011-04-19T02:07Z,It's fucking cave movie.  You really need a subtitle?
,ahalheru,2011-04-20T05:15Z,This really HD or just an upscale?
,john depp,2011-04-20T05:19Z,Sorry icystone - I didn't know you are a deaf.  Yeah I think rippers need to start considering people who need subtitles.  Didn't mean to be a jerk.  Sorry.
,bradass,2011-04-20T15:53Z,"i like to convert to blu-ray and burn to dvd, to watch on blu-ray player. that being said, i get an error loading the movie into the converter, and burnt as an .mkv onto dvd also does not play in blu-ray player. i can watch it on my computer, but HD on my computer screen? thanks for the up though, i'll play with it "
,john depp,2011-04-20T17:36Z,"bradass:  you stupid pigeon head.  you think this is blu-ray?  Why would you put this file into blu-ray player.  It's a blu-ray rip.

Get a HDMI cable and hook it up to your TV.  Watch it on your TV you stupid bird brain."

,shinobiXRT,2011-06-19T15:06Z,"theres a good reason you havent heard of this film before, its crap :P"
,Ragadast,2011-07-10T11:30Z,"Maybe it is just me, but I had problem with the video/audio synchro. After a couple of minutes of play, the video takes more and more advance over the audio. To the point that each 5 minutes or so, i have to shut the movie. Restart it, immediatly drag the slider with the mouse to where the movie was and then I can watch it for 2-3 minutes before the whole thing gets out of synch."
,t3hipo,2011-07-12T19:00Z,"It was a good rip.

Movie was better than Titanic! LOL.. just kidding. It was OK.

Don't COMMAND people to not download something because you don't know how to hide your download activity..."
,wolftone1916,2011-08-26T23:03Z,"@Ragadast

I know in VLC player, you can resync it up. I had this problem before, did the resync and then went under View/Advanced Controls. If you notice there it has the option to record. Of course this is a LONG method to fixing this and having an avi file that is synced but I guess it just comes down to whether or not you want to be able to burn it..."
,Agge666,2011-10-31T20:50Z,"Excellent quality, but the movie was below average 4.5/10"
