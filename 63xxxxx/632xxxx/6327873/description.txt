Update for Mac OS X Lion Developer Preview 2 - Build 11A430e
Only for systems that have developer preview 2 of Lion or Lion Server 2

I  found the Lion 2 Dev update was causing my finder to continually crash - hopefully in this update, they have fixed that - but tit hasn't yet (Well, I'm not exactly sure if they fixed the Finder crashing issue, but the system itself is VERY unstable)

Comment 1: use with caution : I had a hard time getting my Mac back to boot in OS X.6.7 after the install, there are several bugs in it.

Comment 2: Use a redundant drive to install this, because the darn thing kept crashing, making me HardBoot my machine. There is usually enough time to change the boot setting back to boot on the OS X.6.7 disk before it fails

Comment 3: Maybe it's necessary to install this update if another one comes around that says you must have this on installed first. So you may just want to download it and store it somewhere without actually installing it.

Just use common sense, don't let this ruin your MAC experience, at least people that are more familiar with I.T. than I am can see what they are trying to achieve here.
