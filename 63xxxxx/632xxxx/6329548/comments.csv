no doubt you've done a great job on the site but only two things u have to look into it carefully those things about (torrent's info & screens) there's a lack of info for the torrent which isn't give a clear idea about what you upload and the screens could make it easier for downloader to find out if it's valuable to watch or not, i hope you're not feel offended about what i mentioned in this comment, keep up the good work."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-04-20T01:20Z,Screenshots are not needed and will not be provided. bluray=bluray=better than anything else.
[V],GoodFilms,2011-04-20T01:22Z,"And sufficient info is given. audio and bitrates plus various links. if you want to know more about the film, VISIT IMDB."
[V],Zen_Bud,2011-04-20T13:20Z,"If you want god encoded films with Swedish_Sub go here instead:)

[V],GoodFilms,2011-04-20T17:01Z,"anoXmous's torrents are RE-ENCODES of mine and other people's torrents. Reencoding results in a loss of quality, and the quality of my torrents is far superior to anoXmous's, so fuck off you spamming little shit."

[V],GoodFilms,2011-04-21T13:03Z,Lol. I've reported you. Now fuck off and grow up :)
,naah,2011-04-21T21:52Z,lmao downloading the movie just because of the ridiculus fighting comments
[T],-Gabe-,2011-04-21T22:23Z,"There is an almost invisible difference between re-encoded films but it depindes on what settings we use.
Screenshots are generally helpful becouse there are some blu-rays that don't look so great and maybe are some people who would rather get an avi than waste time for a blu-ray release.

By the way, great upload. I'll help seeding it."
