Mark Leung: Revenge of the Bitch GRATiS


Description: Since the beginning of time, RPGs have taken themselves far too seriously. Theyâ€™re plagued by recycled stories, stock characters and a clichÃ©d pseudo-medieval fantasy setting. Itâ€™s time for someone to make fun of these games. BIG TIME. Thatâ€™s where â€œMark Leung: Revenge of the Bitchâ€ comes in: itâ€™s a fully playable parody RPG. Think of it as an RPG gone wrong. Inspired by Christianity, double rainbows, Kim Jong Il, flaming trolls and Final Fantasy, â€œRevenge of the Bitchâ€ features characters and monsters that are bizarre hybrids of public figures and well-known characters. Thereâ€™s Jhompson, a summonable character inspired by Jack Thompson and Illidan Stormrage, and McFunny, a boss character inspired by the Joker and Ronald McDonald. Recent events such as the subprime mortgage crisis also inspired a bank-themed dungeon and a cleric named Brother Lehman.
