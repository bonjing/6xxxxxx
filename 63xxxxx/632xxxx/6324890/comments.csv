,lostlegends,2011-04-19T03:27Z,"Won't load a save for me "" says its a pirated version"""
,PatRicK_BeNetaR,2011-04-21T07:13Z,"The problem was apparently with the gratis release & I hear there is a fix for the ""pirated version"" error which involves replacing certain files in:

game dir\scriptsAndAssets

I do not have a link to a dL for the fixed files, but perhaps googling it will provide one, or maybe someone will up it on here.

This is a fix for people with pixel shader issues:

Find prefs.cs -file from /scriptsAndAssets/client

From that file find line â€œ$pref::SilhouetteOn = 1;â€ 

& set it to â€œ$pref::SilhouetteOn = 0;â€

This should disable cartoonshader.

I have heard the game is pretty bad, but I can't confirm it as I haven't played it yet."
,lostlegends,2011-04-22T01:52Z,"Thanks Patrick, I shouldnt have been a lazy shit and looked it up myself. Anyway google 
""Mark Leung gratis rlslog""
and the link for the fix is in comment 28.
and yes the graphics are bad but the game, at least the bit i have played is funny as hell."

,Gnob77,2012-01-03T05:56Z,"Excellent, I really appreciate the upload. For anyone having the pirate issue, there's no need to go download or fix anything (trust me, I looked). Just start a new game, skip the movies, then load your previous save game from there, easy peasy. =)"
