,Eagle1492,2011-08-30T02:37Z,"Found out by alittle readinf and reading the info here, my mistake, that mkv is a better format and handles HD quality better, also plays on vlc player."
,jason_mendez,2011-09-17T23:15Z,at some places you can't hear what he says.... there is no subtitle in English for this movie anywhere...
,awem,2012-02-10T14:22Z,"The quality is noticeably worse than an average 700mb dvdrip, especially the lo-fi audio hurts my ears. If you can afford the megabytes, get another torrent."
