Storyline:
 The Welsh nutters, Dirty Sanchez are making a movie: The concept of the film
 is that the Devil has heard about the dare-devil nature of the Sanchez boys so
 he's set them the ultimate challenge, to complete stunts based on the 7 Deadly
 Sins or be damned to the gutter forever. In order to regain their status as
 hard-asses and crawl out of the gutter - the 7 deadly sins they must complete
 in seven exotic locations are: Sloth - UK >> Anger - Moscow Russia >> Lust -
 Bangkok Thailand >> Envy - Ko Phi Phi Thailand >> Pride - Tokyo Japan >>
 Gluttony - Mexico >> Greed - Dominican Republic And most interesting of all
 the film-makers have secured Lemmy to play the Devil and do the music.
 Lemmy: "If they (Dirty Sanchez boys) think they're tough... Wait till they
 meet me."
