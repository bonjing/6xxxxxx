,EdoSensei,2011-04-18T20:19Z,"What's with the weird aspect ratio of this? It says 16:9 but it's not even 4:3. Look at the resolutions you quoted.

Width                            : 542 pixels
Height                           : 576 pixels

The ratio is something like 9:10. Yes, it's taller than it is wide!?

Thanks for your effort to upload these videos but it seems like more effort to make the video format weird than it is to upload it as should be.

I've downloaded this and will watch it because no one else has uploaded the forum this week but it's kinda odd. jorrell0733, Do you know why it's gone this aspect ratio?"
,jorrell0733,2011-04-18T22:10Z,"RE:EdoSensei  I hadnt noticed the aspect ratio had changed mate, but it plays perfectly through VLC, DIVX & WMP in the correct aspect (16:9)"
,jorrell0733,2011-04-18T22:20Z,"***PLEASE NOTE FOR THOSE NEW TO THE BBC F1 FORUM, THIS IS NOT THE CHINESE GP RACE, IT IS THE POST RACE ANALYSIS AFTER THE RACE, SO WATCH THIS AFTER YOU KNOW THE RESULT!***"
,neo_downloader,2011-04-19T05:25Z,"Thanks but, has anyone uploaded the race on TPB???
I'm going nuts!!
Can find it anywhere on the web!!"
,EdoSensei,2011-04-19T05:44Z,"My PC was automatically playing it through another video player, and I guess it was playing it at the native resolution so it was tall and thin!? However, I selected the VLC player and yes, it played fine. Thanks, but it is a strange resolution don't you agree?"
,EdoSensei,2011-04-19T06:10Z,"neo_downloader, you're not searching very hard!!

This guy has uploaded the race in from BBC HD and SAFCuk009 has put up the BBC broadcast in SD which I think is fine! Then again, I'm not watching on a massive TV."
