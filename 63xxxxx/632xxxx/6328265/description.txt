The Soviet school of a cinema is unique. Without peripeties both an intricate plot, and any original form of a narration and abrupt special effects to shoot magnificent film. The strong hand of the talented director which could put this masterpiece for all times is felt. Andrey Myagkov's inexpressible game and Alisy Frendlih inhales especial charm in which the pure love, kindness, hope, belief, tears and pleasure is mixed in a film. Certainly, without other actors, it has not turned out so pathetic atmosphere. Especially, without Ahidzhakovoj 

This film is to be reconsidered on many times and each time again to endure about heroes, to rejoice together with them, to laugh at the phrases learn by heart. This film lives in a shower, it combines magnificent game of actors, amazing music, and certainly love!!!
