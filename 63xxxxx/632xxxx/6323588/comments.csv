,Xfader,2011-04-19T11:27Z,Can anyone tell me if this has the option to install Internet Information Services (IIS) component (Start -> Control Panel -> Add/Remove Programs -> Add Windows Components) I have installed other builds and this option has been taken out for some reason. I need this to run a program.
[T],liluser,2011-04-19T11:39Z,"@ mysticalgenius
this xp only has one driverpack added..
MassStorage 11.01 txt mode (sata + raid) 

you should have gone for the bigger dvd version with loads of driverpacks..  or backed up your drivers first with driver genius to use this cd version.."
[T],liluser,2011-04-19T11:40Z,"@ Xfader
i didnt remove Information Services (IIS) component it should still be there.."

@liluser

This is NOT multi-language.
Sure You can choose the input language, but the system itself is English only. You do NEED a language pack to make it dutch/deutch/czech/whatever :(("
