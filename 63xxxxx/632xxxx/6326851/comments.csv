Thankx for the ul Hero#1"
,BoonDockSaiNt30,2011-04-18T20:29Z,"Seeding now, and at this point it is seeders/leachers=423/3210"
,phattsao,2011-04-19T14:39Z,"Decent quality.  Main problem is the guy recording it left it on auto-focus, so every time the light level changes it goes out of focus for a while.  Annoying but you can live with it.  PROTIP GUYS:  Turn off auto-focus.  Once you set the focal distance to a static object, it doesn't change.  "
,aceman2010,2011-04-19T19:11Z,"i saw this is the theater the other day. pretty good movie.  i flipped thru this upload real quick

a/6 v/7"
,pinzmoo,2011-04-19T20:14Z,"thx for the up op,

v5 a7

auto focus out of control on this movie some parts are unwatchable but thanks for the up anyways."
,stynebro,2011-04-19T20:46Z,"why go through all the trouble to record this movie in the theatre if your going to be a complete amature about it and leave autofocus on? 
thanx for the effort anyway, and thanx to the uploader  "
,harley2007,2011-04-19T21:12Z,Thanks Hero_No_1 Good cam upload and sound. Keep up the good work!!!!
,33BayPirate33,2011-04-20T16:36Z,"I can appreciate the effort, but can't deal with the focus going in and out and it being filmed at an angle. Guess I shall have to wait to watch it."
,Tmac47,2011-04-21T15:20Z,"V - 3
A - 5

This is a bad cam.  Half the movie is blurry and nearly unwatchable.

I can't believe people gave this a 7 for video...wat?"
,alicedowntherabbithole,2011-04-22T03:09Z,Thank you very much
,zodii,2011-04-22T19:02Z,"A: 7

,fszabo17,2011-04-25T00:15Z,"I don't know why bother watching this unwatchable recorded with 20 USD camera movie, why not wait 2 weeks, when you get the DVDrip from Axxo, or FXG??? Be patients guys!!"
,djtazie1,2011-04-25T13:24Z,@fszabo17 .... AxxO hasnt released a movie in 2 years or more so you would be waiting for that as he has no more plans to release stuff.
,Icewolf007,2011-04-25T14:38Z,"V5

Good effort thanks"
,nyny12345,2011-04-25T19:13Z,"hero_no_1 can u get madeas big happy famliy plz. 

thanx"
,niteyez,2011-04-28T05:52Z,"This upload is utter CRAP, even for a cam. As stated in earlier comments, ever heard of turning off ""AUTO-FOCUS""... This is painful to watch... even the title ""FOCUS Entertainment"" is HORRIBLY OUT OF FOCUS. The audio sucks, even with EQ adjustment it echoes and the camera is tilted and pulled in throughout the movie. Not to mention the woman's head that appears at the bottom right of the screen intermittently throughout the entire movie. Couldn't you tell her you were trying to capture the film for some project and have her f'n MOVE! 
The movie sucks anyway and despite what critics say it's predictable and uninspiring to say the least. It looks like some wannabe director's first attempt at a feature film.

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS P.O.SHITE!!"
,mark1990,2011-04-29T21:08Z,thanks for ur effort..at least u tried..hoping for a dvdscreener soon.

,Xuhybrid,2011-05-01T22:15Z,"The moment someone says TRUST ME i tune out the crap, if the url spam and uppercase didnt turn me away first.

Why are scammers always stupid?"
,boromadnz,2011-05-04T07:08Z,"I thought the quality was ok, jst download the sample if your not sure.

,shiftedx9,2011-05-06T23:20Z,"wait for a dvdrip, quality is pretty bad. thanx for the upload but this isnt even watchable

,vteccer666,2011-05-08T19:54Z,why do some people keep bitching about getting a movie for free at least some are trying to give us movies just be grateful or sell your pc and stop being such ungrateful assholes the ones that complain why dont you try and upload a better quality copy if not shut the fuck up 
,woody_76,2011-05-13T16:54Z,"oh wow seriously this has to be 1 of worst quality vids ive ever seen, no disrespect tp upload though, at least they guy still made an effort to help everyone out, so all the neagtive remarks towards him aint realy fair in all honesty aye guys an gals ;-|"

,stfudab,2011-05-30T19:28Z,no one gives a shit what your rating of the movie is. just rate the a/v and get back to whacking off
,Aurasan,2011-06-03T02:15Z,"@djtazie1:
