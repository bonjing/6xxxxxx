ABDULLAH IBRAHIM [Dollar Brand]  VOICE OF AFRICA
Label Camden
Original Year 1989
Format:Mp3@320


Recorded in the company of some key South African contemporaries, with especially nice saxophone in the mix! Most of the tracks here are nicely long and stretched-out â€“ tunes that build nicely on Brand's love of lean, loping rhythms â€“ laid out nicely in his own piano lines, and topped with some tenor and flute from Basil Coetzee, tenor from Duku Makasi, alto from Kippie Moeketsi, and flute and alto from Robbie Jansen. The CD features material from 3 different groups â€“ all with some combination of the above players â€“ and unfortunately, there's no real dates listed for the sessions
