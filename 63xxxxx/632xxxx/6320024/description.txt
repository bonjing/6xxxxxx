Ch4 Vincent The Full Story 2of3 HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup 2004

Part 2.
The second programme covers the period in Van Gogh's life from when he lived for a year with a prostitute in The Hague to his most prolific period, in Arles in the south of France. It was a period during which his appalled father - a preacher - tried to have Vincent committed to a mental asylum; the artist became increasingly difficult and unpopular: eating too little, drinking and smoking too much, and catching gonorrhoea and syphilis; before being introduced to a heady cocktail of absinthe and Impressionism in Paris; and, during his alarmingly prolific period in Arles, he turned the endless fields of a cheap cash crop that surrounded him into the most famous - and expensive - flower ever painted: the sunflower.
