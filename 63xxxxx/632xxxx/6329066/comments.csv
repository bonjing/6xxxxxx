,crucius,2011-04-24T00:19Z,"to avoid ""unhandled page fault on read access to 0x000000000 at address 0x0106c3a8"" error you don't have to resize your screen resolution

go to the application folder, two finger click in ""Pro Evolution Soccer 2011"" and choose ""show package contents""

then just navigate to Contents -> Resources ->Transgaming -> c_drive -> PES2011 -> settings.exe

(to open ""settings.exe"" on Mac OS download and install CrossOver)

then just change the resolution of the program itself to match your screen resolution

let me know if that works on your systems"
,Piranter,2011-04-24T10:47Z,it's a bit laggy.
,Pyro7,2011-04-24T11:08Z,"So took me about a day to download.  I was having the 'Unhandled Process' problems as well but both instructions from Kalz15 and Crucius works great! If you don't feel like switching your screen res too much, I'd go with crucius' tip. Remember it's rossover and not Cross over GAMES.(that happened to me). 

S.N: Does anyone know how to get the patch?

Thanks for upload! Will be seeding come Monday."

,wolski888,2011-05-31T19:03Z,"@ Chapelier_Fou
Please read the comments. If you haven't already then here is what you do:

2 Options:
1. (Easy way but the game will not have the best resolution.) Go to your mac's System Prefs > Display. Change the resolution to 1024 x 768 (stretched or not). You will have to do this every time you play.

2. Download CrossOver, make a new bottle (there are many youtube videos that show you how to open exe files on a mac using crossover)

the what crucius said:
go to the application folder, two finger click in ""Pro Evolution Soccer 2011"" and choose ""show package contents""

then just navigate to Contents -> Resources ->Transgaming -> c_drive -> PES2011 -> settings.exe

then just change the resolution of the program itself to match your screen resolution.

Works great!"
,wolski888,2011-05-31T19:04Z,Forgot to say that the second option needs only to be done once.
,westy10,2011-06-01T00:07Z,"Wolski888  Do you use an xbox controller when playing this game and if so can you use all the buttons including RT-RB & LT-LB?

I used crossover but it still would not set the controls correctly,very annoying as you need all controls when playing this awesome game,well I do anyway!

Cheers!"
,wolski888,2011-06-01T14:44Z,"@westy10
I would have to disagree with you about need all controls to play this game. I can play fine with just A, X, B and Y. And no, I don't use an xbox controller. Aren't they wireless? My LB-RB on the keyboard is Q-E. My LT-RT is Z-C. I don't use them ingame but I do use them in Legend mode when I'm not playing or when editing a player.
Just in case you were wondering."
