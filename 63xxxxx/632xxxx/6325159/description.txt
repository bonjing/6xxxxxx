     John Goodman (Roseanne, Raising Arizona) had his first starring role in
     this warmhearted comedy from Oscar-winning writer and director David S Ward
     (The Sting, Major League, Sleepless in Seattle). When a freak accident
     wipes out the entire royal family, a surviving heir to the throne must be
     found, and turns up in the unlikely form of Ralph Jones (Goodman),
     a good-natured Las Vegas lounge singer. But even his private secretary
     (Peter O'Toole) can't prepare Ralph for the trouble he gets into when he
     runs afoul of the fiendish Lord Graves (John Hurt) and falls for a shy
     stripper (Camille Coduri). Based on the novel Headlong by Emlyn Williams
     (Night Must Fall, The Corn is Green), this tailor-made vehicle lets Goodman
     give his considerable comic talents free reign--quite literally--for
     the first time.
