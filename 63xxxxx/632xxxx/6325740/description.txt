La Renga are an indpendient hard rock and Heavy Metal band from Argentina, formed in 1988.

They have a moderate success with the albums "A Donde Me Lleva La Vida" and "Bailando en una pata", between 1993 and 1995, but it was the release of "Despedazado por Mil Partes", in 1996, that made them nationally famous.

With the releases of La Renga in 1998 and La Esquina del Infinito the following year, they gained some international fame, touring and doing concerts in Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay, Spain and other countries of Latin America.

This album was recorded completely in the rehearsal room, like "Documento Unico", which would mark a new methodology of the band in the production of their albums, obtaining a sound similar in power to that of their live concerts.
