,Frozeer,2011-04-24T02:00Z,"Thanks for downloading, also remember SEED!"
,yhyhman,2011-04-24T19:30Z,Hello this game works fine but when i play it i lag most of the time i live in the uk london any reason why it lags
,Frozeer,2011-04-25T04:20Z,"I do not believe it has anything to do with location.

==================================

The way this game is set up online try setting your graphics quality lower than you normally do, that fixed it for me."
,yodude226,2011-04-26T00:28Z,Seed please it's taking forever (
,yhyhman,2011-04-27T20:04Z,Frozeer yes i downloaded last time and it worked and it lagged you said to change graphic settings but im trying again it freezes on some percentages
,Frozeer,2011-05-01T04:24Z,"That is odd...

=================================

Make sure at the BARE minimum you have 3GB of RAM and a 1GB Graphics Card.

=================================

Otherwise it will lag when you try to play, the only other thing I could think of would to make sure you at least have Cable Internet or a LAN connection.

=================================

Sorry, it isn't that amazing it can be played on slow internet."
,COTTA,2011-05-17T21:27Z,"Alredy have a new version, in which they can change the name from menu of the game etc...
