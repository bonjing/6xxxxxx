,thevoid100,2011-04-17T12:47Z,Is this the v 106917 version ? 
,thevoid100,2011-04-17T21:35Z,"coop doesnt work when in lan , help any1?"
,Andvariedfire,2011-04-17T23:12Z,"Installed but get stream error. ""Application load error 5:0000065434""

I got the other torrent but multiplayer is disabled in it, I wonder if this one's is too."
,Krixus,2011-04-18T00:46Z,"Thank you for upload. Works perfectly on Win7 x64.
Game is version 1.0.6917.
Multiplayer is disabled via Steam ( for obvious reasons ) but it looks like TCP/IP multiplayer is functional although i haven't tested. Game uses unreal engine so many diffrent tweaks in the BaseEngine.ini inside the config folder. Very fun and challenging even on normal mode. Thanks again.
*Scanned with many virus scanners/Virustotal, all is clean.*"
,Andvariedfire,2011-04-18T03:48Z,Steam disabled yeah. Anyone have a positive answer on whether or not tcp/ip works or not?
,DaemonFang,2011-04-18T06:11Z,"When I try to launch the game an error pops up saying, ""This application has failed to start because D3DCOMPILER_43.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem."" I've re-installed and cracked it and that didnt help.. Please help"
,Robertman20,2011-04-18T06:48Z,"@ Daemonfang

Search for the DLL on internet an put it in the system 32 folder unless stated otherwise."
,MalFusiOn,2011-04-18T07:18Z,i dont think tcp/ip works because would need a host to join.. and game crashes when you try to host.... unless its just me???
,Rodrifg,2011-04-18T09:40Z,"How come my game seems to be stuck on goin right slightly diagonally...? and while in settings it sets everything to the right... and it's not a keyboard or mouse problem cuz they work fine on the rest of the computer and games.
any help appreciated thx"
,Krixus,2011-04-18T11:00Z,"@rodrifg
Have you tried unplugging any controllers that are plugged into your PC?"
,Rodrifg,2011-04-18T12:10Z,"wow thx a lot man! I've had this problem for quite some time now, and to think the solution was simply unplugging the gamepad. seriously thanks mate"
,RasmuSHoW,2011-04-18T17:29Z,"A lot of dlls were missing, so i downloaded them, (google) and then the game worked. 

I get no sound though. 
( one of the dlls were named something with sound, so that is probably why, even though i've downloaded it ) 

If anyone got a fic for the sound, i'd be grateful."
,RasmuSHoW,2011-04-18T18:02Z,"You with dll / sound problems. 

go update your direct X before downloading single dll's: 
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=2da43d38-db71-4c1b-bc6a-9b6652cd92a3 

My sound works now. "
,Andvariedfire,2011-04-18T19:27Z,"If you have problems with .DLL's missing, go to the sanctum folder, in the install folder, and run the DIRECTX setup file.

You may already have the updated version but this install fixes the missing ones for this game.

Worked on two different computers for me.


Any news on the tcp/ip yet? Anyone try it?"
,DaemonFang,2011-04-19T01:47Z,"@Andvariedfire I updated directx and I dont think anything is missing, but it just stops working when I try to launch it. Thanks for the help anyway."
,Krixus,2011-04-19T02:29Z,"@Daemonfang

Go to your Sanctum install folder. Go to Sanctum/Install/Direct X folder

Run the DirectX setup in there.

If that doesnt work, then go back to the DirectX folder. Open with winrar or winzip the Jun2010_D3DCompiler_43_x86.cab or if your 64bit then open Jun2010_D3DCompiler_43_x64.cab

Unzip the D3DCompiler_43.dll file to your C:windows/system32 folder and C:windows/sysWoW64 folder ( if you have one )

See if either of those work."
,Andvariedfire,2011-04-19T02:39Z,"@DaemonFang

Seemed to work for me when i had that issue, but i guess every computer seems to be different.

I've been playing this, its alot of fun, i hope you get it to work soon.
But yeah, as he said, if running the install/update doesnt fix it, use the zipped file maybe. Hopefully it'll fix it"
,wizard2121,2011-04-19T05:31Z,"so i copied crached content over into top directory,  not the one titled sanctum game. There were a few missing dlls that the directx update didnt grab so I got those, but after I added the last one I keep getting this error 

ShippingPC-SanctumGame.Exe Entry Point Not Found

The procedure entry point
?c_str (a bunch more gibberish like that) could not be located in the dynamic link library stlport.5.1.dll.

That dll file is the last one I downloaded and its in the game directory like all the others that were missing. Any idea wtf this means?"
,Andvariedfire,2011-04-19T06:09Z,"It's not the .dll made for that game in particular, so its missing code in it Sanctum needs to run.

Check the install directory and everything for some zip for that file in particular.

Maybe do a general directx update to the newest THEN run that one with sanctum afterward?"
,Krixus,2011-04-19T06:48Z,"These sound like problems not related to sanctum. These errors shouldn't occur if you have the latest direct x drivers, windows updates, and graphics drivers installed. If you want help your gonna need to post your system specs such as CPU / Video Card etc..."
,nighthawk21,2011-04-19T16:01Z,"If you copy ONLY the cracked .exe file, you will be able to play Multiplayer through TCP/IP across LAN. 

Your name will just be ""Player"" ."
,chaosomg,2011-04-20T00:27Z,"Multiplayer doesn't work, i have the same problem as MalFusiOn. the game just crashes when you go to Host. anyone got a fix?"
,chaosomg,2011-04-20T00:35Z,Okay i found a fix. If you just copy over the .exe from the crack folder you can host fine to play TCP/IP games.
,Programko,2011-04-20T08:05Z,"TCP/IP works over Internet, tested with my friend, just do like ""nighthawk21"" said."
,chaosomg,2011-04-20T09:53Z,wow thats awkward. didn't see nighthawk21's comment. sorry.
,Andvariedfire,2011-04-20T15:04Z,"So after installing, if you copy over the cracked .exe it should work fine?"
,Trunammer,2011-04-20T21:38Z,"HOST FIX

Here's what I did. In the cracked folder there should be two files. One is the cracked exe and the other is the steam dll. All I did was copy the cracked exe and NOT the steam dll. The game and hosting a game works and everything's perfect.
When I copied the steam dll over that's when hosting crashes. So just copy the exe and not the dll file from the crack folder and you should be good."
,bopoink,2011-04-22T02:32Z,"I am new to torrenting to excuse me if this is a stupid question, but i am confused by the fact that there are about 18 files that contain isos, and they wont mount properly. I am not sure what to do, altho this is probably a simple thing that i have misunderstood. "

Many anti-virus programm flag keygen/cracks as virus. Most of them notice it's a keygen/crack and  give a false positive on purpose."
