GAME INFOS

Sanctum is a First Person Shooter Tower Defense where you take the role as
Skye, an elite soldier sent out to protect her home town, Elysion One, from
hordes of mysterious alien creatures. 

To succeed you have to construct and upgrade defensive structures. What makes
Sanctum unique from other Tower Defense games is that when the havoc starts,
you jump right into the action with your own weapons and play a key role in
the defense. Sanctum has taken the best features from First Person Shooters
and Tower Defense games to create something totally unique.
