you can make your oun windows xp simply  use nLite
which can be found here
http://www.nliteos.com/
just download untouched and clean version of windows xp   and follow the instructions how to use nLite which there is plenty   just Google them 
make  sure you have all applications and drives  you want to have on Xp  that's basically the idea :) "

GOOD JOB do_not_delete_me_blindly !!!"
,zilla1126,2011-05-06T20:21Z,"Suggestion: When you are including different versions of ISO - please don't zip them up.  Bittorrent allows one to decide what files in a torrent they want to download - unless htey are zipped up into a single file.

Thanks for doing this though."

sorry, I do not know what kind of internet you have but nowadays the speed is high enough, if not for us then at some friend...so that not to matter at all the size of this torrent...more than this...here are more seeders than you see, some are hidden not being expressly mentioned into the tracker's list... but connected to it by interchanging peers...those IP's are all from broadband connection ;), so.. source is well seeded, you just need an internet connection to download this zipped to help all of those like you to download what they want. If I isolate them, then part of ...or the entire torrent dies...and cause you've mentioned, bittorrent survives through share...that is not always a tough point of our consciousness ;))"
,HPrestore,2011-06-20T00:56Z,"Hey thanks the torrent! this really helped me out with an older laptop, as it runs 2003 and 2007 kinda slow.

also I read both zilla1126's comment and your reply, and I still agree with him in a way. I don't need the 2003 or XP romanian versions, so I wish the files were separate. I only have a 40GB hard drive, so stuff fills up fast."
