Then I deleted it.

I need RARs and 3 READMEs like I need a hole in the head.

@sceneline:  You do realize that the fragmented nature of torrent file transfer coupled with the futility of RARing well-compressed video makes this completely inconvenient for no reason, right?

I mean, it's all free and illegal, so there should be no quality controls and we should all get viruses and hold hands.. etc.  I get that argument.  I just want to make sure you know this isn't a newsgroup for my own sanity."
