BookendsÂ Â version 11.0

The reference manager Mac users have been waiting for 


Thatâ€™s right, Bookends goes to 11! 

Reference management entails the collection, annotation, and citation of published information. Bookends greatly simplifies these tasks. 

Bookends can perform Internet searches to retrieve references and associated pdfs or web pages, or immediately find and import references for which you already have the pdf. 

Versatile groups (static, smart, and virtual), Term Lists (keywords, authors, etc.), reference cross-linking (links), multiple notecards per reference, tag clouds, and near-instantaneous live searches help organize and find information in your personal collection. 

Highly configurable displays let you view the reference information and attachments the way you want. Scan your word processor manuscripts to create publication-ready documents complete with bibliographies and footnotes.

Compatible with Word (2004, 2008, and 2011), Mellel*, Apple Pages '08 and â€˜09, Nisus Writer Pro, and OpenOffice 3.

System requirements:

OS X.4 and above
