For the english speaking people:

iso 1 en iso 2 DO have english subs (at least: in VLC i can choose them)

Iso 3 is portugese language and english language with only portugese subs

iso 4 is indeed (only) english language though listed as portugese, only portugese subs.

SO.... if you only understand english, skip dvd 3, for the rest, you're good."
