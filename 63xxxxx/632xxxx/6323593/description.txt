Final Fantasy IV Complete Collection

Language: English

Just so you guys know I am new at uploading torrents, I usually download, but I thought I would give it a try.  I patched this and tested it on my PSP 1001 5.00 M33-6 and it works.  When it starts just so you know after you click the OK to auto save, push the X button to go to the main menu, or the screen will stay black.  I thought it wasn't working, but it does start up.  

Please leave comments and let me know if it works for you guys and if it doesn't let me know so I can try to fix the problem, Thanks!
