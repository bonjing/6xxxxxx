,Trucifenix,2011-04-18T19:29Z,"THANK YOU!!! sofar working... intro movies anyways :D more than the unpatched did for me.

running 5.00 M33-6 with prometheus 4"
,Trucifenix,2011-04-18T19:30Z,perhaps i spoke too soon... into cutscene just froze :(
,Trucifenix,2011-04-18T19:33Z,"@CandyCane22: did you use the new Prometheus v0.6 BETA & ISO Tool v1.60 to patch this? I'm about to try that next, unless you already have in this version"
,Trucifenix,2011-04-18T19:35Z,"also, there's some interesting comments on the jap version of this.

http://www.ffinsider.net/psp-iso/final-fantasy-iv-complete-collection-jpn.html

they're saying to use iso tool 0.6 beta1, and also use iso tool 1970 and first patch with â€œME631â€³, after finish patching, patch again with â€œ05â€³.

maybe some of this is relevant to N/A version too?"
,Trucifenix,2011-04-18T20:15Z,"Ok I don't know how my previous comment got screwed up but anyhow... I got it working. here's what I did.

download/run ISO tool 1971. First, patch prometheus with ME63, after finish patching, patch again with 05. and it should be good (sofar good for me anyways)

got this off a jap torrent.

got this info off the jap torrent. (and I patched a clean iso, not your patched one. but you may want to try this and re-upload)"
,Trucifenix,2011-04-18T20:15Z,ME631 i meant to say above
,CandyCane22,2011-04-18T21:08Z,"@Trucifenix, thank you for letting me know.  What I did was go to the main menu and made sure the games started.  The first game (Final Fantasy IV original) I had no problems playing, no freezing or anything.  When did it freeze for you?"
,CandyCane22,2011-04-18T21:10Z,"@ Trucifenix, Sorry I forgot to put this in my other message, I used some other program I found about Patching PSP games.  Here is the link:  http://www.psperspective.net/index.php?app=tutorials&article=155"
,Trucifenix,2011-04-19T06:56Z,"@Candy

that link doesn't work for some reason?

anyhow, I played through the entire intro movies with no crashes and played through the beginning a little with the above methods.

I posted this on the other torrent too; http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6268368/[PSP]Final_Fantasy_IV_Complete_Collection[ENG][FULL]
and one person said it worked fine for him also.

if you look on FFinsider they have the jap one posted and a pretty lengthy discussion about patching."
,Trucifenix,2011-04-20T11:42Z,"btw I tested on 6.20 firmware and it works fine w/o patches. so, it seems only 5.xx firmwares require the two prometheus patches"
,wind_rune,2011-04-22T03:26Z,thanks for the upload. i have a few questions though. the movies they won't play for me and when i get the the part where they go to baron by ship the game just hangs. is anyone else getting that? i haven't touched this iso with anything else. thanks again for the upload
,wind_rune,2011-04-22T03:36Z,thanks for the upload. i have 2 question though. the movies do not play for me and when it gets to the point where they go to baron by ship and they see leviathan it hangs. i haven't touched the ISO with anything else. i'm running it on a PSP 1000 with 5.50 gen-d3. thanks again
,CandyCane22,2011-04-23T06:41Z,"@wind_rune, I have not played much through the game yet so I will have to see what you are having problems with and get back to you.  Also I tested this on my PSP 1001 5.00 M33-6, so if there is someone else who has tried it on the one you have maybe they will post on here.  Also look at the previous comments maybe that will help you too."
,wind_rune,2011-04-23T11:07Z,"@Candy

Thank you for the advice. I'm looking into the rest of the comments and links right now. If I see how to solve the problem I will get back to you. Thanks again"
,wind_rune,2011-04-23T11:35Z,wow the whole patching thing works. i've never done it before so i was worried of screwing it up. it works great now. ff iv is my favorite ff and that will likely never change. thanks so much
,gnetix,2011-04-23T22:54Z,"This works on my psp okay. It doesn't play any of the cut scenes though. Or the opening scene. That is where it stays black as you mentioned CandyCane.

Also, I can't install data. Does anyone know how I can get the cut scenes to play? Or maybe another version that will work on my psp?

I have 1000 model and 5.50 gen-d on it. I can't upgrade because my screen is broken, so I use remotejoylite to play on my pc :("
,gnetix,2011-04-23T22:55Z,"Oh, sorry but THANKS for sharing this CandyCane! I tried a few other uploads and the game wouldn't even start. This one at least works! "
,gnetix,2011-04-24T01:21Z,Game just crashed at Leviathan for me. Also no movies will play. I can't use the isotool because remotejoylite will crash on app like that. Can someone upload a patched version with Trucifenix's patch advice? People seem to say that it works.
,FastClau,2011-04-27T12:23Z,"working perfect on psp1000 5.5genD3! like candycane said, press button x in the beginning or u'll wait for ages on the black screen!!! cheers mate!!! waiting for long time for this!! Thanx again! u're the man!"
,d33pak001,2011-04-27T19:41Z,Game crashed at Leviathan for me as well . any one have a solution ??
,gnetix,2011-05-01T17:00Z,"@ d33pak001 & for anyone else that may want to know... I found a version that works perfectly on my 1001 5.50 gen-D! I got it from Reputation Resource. If you don't want to fill out the registration I could upload it here or on Demonoid. 

Note I'm not sure if this will work on any of the prom installments and the torrent says that it is for 5.50 gen-D3. 

Just wanted to let some people who may have this FW where to find a working version. Thanks again for the upload CandyCane!! Your upload was the only one that worked for me but the opening scene didn't play which means it crashed when an in-game movie played. "
,feitosathiago,2011-05-03T06:46Z,"damn , could you PLEAAAAAAASE people SEED this? Seeding torrents DOESN'T HURT!"
,crutingly,2011-06-19T23:12Z,"freezing at leviathan for me too.  tried using that patching tutorial, but after patching it freezes loading the title screen (however, that black screen now has a little crystal in the corner).  no fixes or new uploads yet?"
,CandyCane22,2011-06-20T13:56Z,"@crutingly.....I actually have fixed it, but have been real busy.  I will upload soon the new one and see if that works for you."
