plot

Allan Campbell (Cole Hauser), a man who has had a very bad day, goes to a bar to drown his sorrows. He drunkenly befriends a mysterious man who calls himself Jonas (Cuba Gooding Jr.), revealing to him a list of five people he wishes were dead.
But as the bodies start piling up, and with a detective (Jonathon LaPaglia) hot on his trail, Allan, no longer believing the events to be a practical joke, must set out to end the murders before its too late.
