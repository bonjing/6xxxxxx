,acenoise,2011-04-25T22:37Z,"I always seed for a bit but i am limited by the shitty download cap that most UK IPs put on users mine is 20gb a month but they advertise it as unlimited and put the stuff about the download cap in the small print and call it a fuckin fair usage policy :@ Lol, Basically if you breach said policy the will just send you a letter, then if you do it again theyl throttle your download speed keep doing it and they will cancell your account! so not alll these peeps are doing it on perpose its the crappy network providers and the high emporer of em all BT that imposes these policies ruining it 4 us all!"
