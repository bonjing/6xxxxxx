
Artist: Hemlock
Title: Hemlock
Genre: Blues,Folk Rock
Origin: UK

The band's best-known member was Miller Anderson who, apart from recording a solo album back in 1971, was also in The Voice, At Last The 1958 Rock'n'Roll Show, Keef Hartley Band (all pre-Hemlock) and Dog Soldier (1975). He now lives in Shoreham-By-Sea and has been performing regularly with Spencer Davis Group as well as recently guesting on a Jon Lord solo album, "Pictured Within".
More or less a vehicle for Anderson's songwriting output (he wrote all of the album's material), Hemlock sounds by no means artificial or put-together. Rather, they were a typical British blues act, without the requisite posing. Naturally, the atmosphere is very serious and dominated by Mick Weaver's passionate organ-playing.
