,RilezParamore,2011-04-17T20:20Z,Is there anyway you could give us a streaming link to this? Mine just seems to take forever.
,RilezParamore,2011-04-17T21:13Z,Whats a seeder & leecher?
,crossfire6,2011-04-17T22:01Z,"Just doesn't seem right for there to show 66 seeders in BT, but ""0"" actually seeding.  This is moving at a whopping 1.5 kb/s and projected to finish downloading around Spring of 2012."
,crossfire6,2011-04-17T22:23Z,"But, I DO appreciate all the effort from froggie and the rest of the skulls.  These guys make it possible for the rest of us to use some good programs.  Many thanks!"

,Yensen,2011-04-17T23:24Z,"Holy poo!

I downloaded this because I figured a scream movie didn't need great quality, but this takes the cake!

I can't believe I had forgotten how shitty cams and telesyncs are. Couldn't watch more than 10 minutes. Seems like a funny movie though.

The video is just awful. 2/10
Audio is pretty metallic but by no means horrible. 4.5/10"
,Yensen,2011-04-17T23:25Z,Still props to IMAGINE & uploaders though.
,spina27,2011-04-18T00:57Z,can u get soul surfer or diary of a wimpy kid 2?? Thanks for download.... always great copies
