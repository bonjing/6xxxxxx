NOTES:
IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Scream 4
Ok guys and gals.....we used the russian cam video,which was ok but nothing great.The colours were well 
whacked on it and soon as you got one part right,the rest looked off lol.Video seemed to be all there
which is nice.......like normal dark scenes are dark,but viewable.
Audio we just need to cut,filter,sync and then mux to our encode.....
In our opinion,this is not one for the big tvs out there....personal would watch on a 22" or below or
otherwise wait a tad longer.
Enjoy folks
