,12uel,2011-04-18T00:19Z,Definitely out of the ordinary. Now I can't watch movies on my PS3 because it's greater than 4 GB. And you are the first choice I go to for downloading movies because your audio out is AC3 5.1 while the majority only use AAC 5.1. So you can tell that I really miss your uploads....why the change if I may ask?
[V],HolyRoses,2011-04-18T00:43Z,"No change.  The other files will just come later.  These are source files.  Some people like them.  I think the PS3 can play them with streaming software like serviio, but I don't know for certain.  Don't fetch them if you don't like them.  This is just for sport :)"
,SNOWMONEY,2011-04-18T02:29Z,"why is there no english subs cant you join subs to your work, it will be a waste of time to download this movie with no subs. "
,kabubuki,2011-04-18T16:41Z,"Hi Snowmoney,

You can download the subs from Subscene or OpenSubtitles.  For this particular movie, you might have to wait for a few days.  I didn't find the BluRay version of the sub for this movie just now.

VLC Player will work with most sub formats as an external file, including .srt, .ass, etc.

If you need to mux the subtitles into the video file, you can use MKVtools for the .mkv video files and Subler for the .mp4 .m4v files."
