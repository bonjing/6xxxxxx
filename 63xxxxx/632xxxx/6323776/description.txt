    Gravitys Clowns is a haunting tale about a Japanese family where a      
    current series of graffiti events paves the way to unraveling an         
    unexpected family truth. This is one of the best mystery films I have    
    seen in recent years. In particular, the primary characters are the      
    familys two brothers, played by Kase and Masaki Okada. We learn         
    later in the film that in truth, one of the children, is illegitimate    
    by the result of the hands of a brutal rapist.
