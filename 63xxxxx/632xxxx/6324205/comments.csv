,Chiitah,2011-04-19T10:41Z,"livinblfqh - As long as Kaspersky has access to the internet / new updates - it WILL block the keys normally in under a week.  These keys usually are blocked in 3-4 days and then we have to come back to get more.  If you're not connected to the net, it will run for as long as the key is good for.  Otherwise Kaspersky blocks them within a few days (some of these are blocked already).  I wish we had our own generators so that we could make our own keys, rather than use the same ones as thousands of others are putting in.  Kaspersky I.S. is good enough that I deal with finding new keys twice a week tho :D"
