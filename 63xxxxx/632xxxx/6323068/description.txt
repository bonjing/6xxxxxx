Vanguard Princess v1.08 with LunaPort r49b. 

******************************************

How to run vanpri108: 
1. Make sure your computer is set to Japanese Locale (Control Panel > Regional > System Locale) before attempting to run VP. If not, AppLocale and NTLEA will both work, provided you rename the game folder. 
2. Follow instructions on the following page.

Netplay: 

LunaPort instructions are in the Readme.txt in the game folder. Its contents are included below: 




LunaPort r49 Readme


LunaPort is an original netplay application for the free game Vanguard Princess,
made by Suge9. The game can be downloaded via the author's blog at: 
http://suge9.blog58.fc2.com/
LunaPort might also work with other games, which use the same engine, as long as
the game exe is exactly identical to the one used by Vanguard Princess.

Please note that LunaPort is still in early developement, so some versions might
not work at all. Only testing can tell.

It is released under the GPLv3 or later. Feel free to tinker, improve, etc.
Magic in the header file is "explained" in src/gore.txt

The netcode seems to be reasonable these days.

If you want to get older versions of LunaPort, you might find them at:

IMPORTANT NOTES:
0) Do not touch the Game menu. If you already touched it, get a pristine copy
   of game.ini before even trying this. Set up your controls outside of
   LunaPort, i.e. run the game normally and use the keyboard/joystick config.
1) If you have customized P2 controls, make a backup of your game.ini, might
   get overwritten with P1 controls, although that shouldn't happen.
2) Also, don't try to change any controls in the menu while playing with
   LunaPort. Bad things will happen and the changes won't be saved anyway.

Less important notes:
3) I only have a single PC this game runs on, so I couldn't really test
   LunaPort. Please help me out here.
4) As long as the game exe is the same, other games might work too, but you have
   to adjust the Stages and Blacklist settings in lunaport.ini
5) Delay is counted in input requests, not frames. There are 100 input requests
   per sec, so 1 delay is 10ms.
6) If the standard filename for the game exe is not found, game.exe is tried.
   You can also specify the filename for the game exe in lunaport.ini

Usage:
Pretty much like caster, even though LunaPort is not based on it. By default,
it uses port 7500 UDP. Use option one to host a game, option two to join a
game, and option three to play a local VS games with random stage selection.
Don't forget to put LunaPort.exe into the game folder.
You can use the --local commandline switch to start local VS mode with random
stages directly. You can give a .rpy file as a commandline argument to watch it
directly.

Replay playback controls:
Q: Toggle pause
W: Reset game speed to normal, unpause
E: Slow down game speed
R: Speed up game speed

Known working: r11, r35-r36, r38-r43, r44-r48
(These versions have been used successfully to play Vanguard Princess.)

Please excuse the desync problems from before. Things should be better now.

Some notes about differences from r38 to r40-r49:
In r39 much of the netcode has been rewritten, to make transmission of data
between peers much easier. In r40, this has been used to add lots of checks
about game data to the handshake. These changes also made a protocol version
bump necessary, meaning that r38 and newer versions cannot interoperate. The
additional checks are for the main game KGT file and stage settings. These were
the main two reasons for desynchronized gameplay. Playing with different stage
settings (e.g. one player with Stages=5 vs another player with Stages=7) can
work synchronized for a couple of round, if you are lucky, but will eventually
desync the game. Using different versions of the game (e.g. v1.02 vs 1.03b) will
be even worse. Both conditions are not checked for in r38, which can make it
appear to work better (it connects), but will lead to eventual desync. Using the
most recent versions should be much safer. Games that would otherwise desync
will not be possible at all and result in an error message from the start.

Now, let's hope this works. Once it does, I might even get around to cleaning
up the code.
