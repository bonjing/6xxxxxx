Cheerz"

,tomattomattomat,2011-04-17T13:52Z,SEEEEEEEEED FFS I have seeded 15gb of total and still stucked on 99.9%. 
,tomattomattomat,2011-04-17T14:51Z,Ok i stopped downloaded it when i was stucked at 99.9% and then deleted it. After that I ran it through ABGX and burned it. So far it works to play but i dont know why it was stucked at 99.9% I hope there is not a file missing
,majarise,2011-04-18T11:31Z,This works fine. Just have to be patient. It will complete the download. Strange and Marvel is not working. Xray moves are awesome. Thanks for the upload.
