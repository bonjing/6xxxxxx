Years ago a dvd called -Ramones Raw- was released, among interviews and stuff came the TV broadcasting of a (partial) concert in Rome.

Sadly I only have that TV broadcasting and thats what Im uploading.


Standard def, 4:3.
Audio Soundboard.

the TV station made mistakes in the name of the songs, but doesnt really mind.
