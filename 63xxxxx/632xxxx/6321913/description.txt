             Patrician IV is the sequel to the historical trading         
             simulation and strategy series. You are a merchant in        
             northern Europe in the late Middle Ages when the             
             Hanseatic League was flourishing. Your goal is to rise       
             to the most successful and influential member of the         
             Hanse, ultimately being elected Elderman, leader of          
             the trading league. You start bargaining with common         
             goods, build up your own production and establish a          
             merchant fleet. Later on, you will gain more and more        
             political influence and even found new towns.                
                                                                          
             However, a Hanse merchant's life can also have its dark      
             sides. On your way to power you have to hold your ground     
             against fierce rivals, whom you have to fight with           
             economic competition, price wars or impure means such as     
             sabotage. Will you even engage in piracy?
