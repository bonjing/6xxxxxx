,spessu,2011-04-16T20:12Z,"Hey man, thanks for the upload!

I'm a huge B5 fan and it sucks for me that there really aren't any decent hi res (like 720p or 1080p) versions out. So thanks for this!

Another thing. Would it be possible for you to fix the first 2 seasons because the download link is broken. Or anyone who has download 'em could upload 'em again. These versions should be shared!"
,Norell_xD,2011-04-16T20:33Z,"ok, i will fix it anyway.. tomorrow, because now is night ."
,spessu,2011-04-17T11:06Z,"But I wonder why no one recorded Babylon 5 from a HD tv channel and made it into 720p. Maybe they didn't yet show B5 on a HD channel? May be...

Yeah, streching SD into HD is not the way to go. But I'll give it a try and see how the quality is anyway. But nice upload though, I bet these are still way better than the low resolution xvid ones."
,shallow_,2011-04-17T11:55Z,"Downloaded a few episodes to check, and its an ok 720p conversion. There has been added some post processing filters that makes it look abit cartoonish (A scanner darkly lite perhaps)
Will do a side by side on my 42"" plasma with my dvd's to see which I prefer.

Thanks for upload and work though."
,spessu,2011-04-19T12:35Z,"Ok, it indeed looks cartoonish and makes certain errors on the image, especially with the CGI, but then again might make the image seem artificially better. I really need to watch it more and see if it's good or bad. Otherwise than that the quality seems superior compared to the xvid ones, so thanks for these.

I still would like to download the previous 2 seasons. There really doesn't seem to be a chance to get them anywhere since the links are broken. Anyone wanna resend 'em, or directly send me? Or could Norell fix the links?

Anyway, this Season 3 seems to be with pretty nice quality, yet still need to confirm this by watching the eps yet once again :)"
,Norell_xD,2011-04-19T15:54Z,"shallow_ , gift to me your plasma :3 and next series will be better ;D
sorry, people, i know is not so good as i want it to see :(

,Agrippa,2011-04-20T18:48Z,Thanks a lot for these uploads!  Will you be uploading seasons 4 and 5 and the other stuff as well?
,Norell_xD,2011-04-30T18:04Z,i hope will be =)
,posith,2011-05-22T12:58Z,The previous downloads works if you use the magnet link (no problem with uTorrent)
,byone,2011-08-25T10:14Z,ну когда уже 4ый и 5ый сезон будут?))) ждем...
,Norell_xD,2012-03-30T22:41Z,"Извиняюсь, что выходит задержка. Могу порадовать - готовы 4 и 5 сезоны, осталось нарезать звук.

Решил дополнительно сделать 1080p... но они по 3 Gb на серию. За невозможностью раздать даже 720p нормально, буду выкладывать на ФО сайты. Ждите. Готовы все сезоны в 1080p и доп. фильмы. 720p раздам на TPB сколько смогу, ..

---
Im sorry, for a delay. The following seasons are complete in 720p/ few weeks
Also completed 1080p but 3 Gb per seria. U can load them from rapidshare and similar."
,Norell_xD,2012-03-30T22:44Z,720p seasons will be on TPB soon
