-A9V9
-Good speed, ranged about 440-520 kBytes/s
-d/l in just over 10 minutes
-Note: they are .rar files that decompress to an .avi file.

I know Torrentzone says ""No RARs"" but these are indeed RARs.  They decompress just fine, though; no problems.
The codecs are common ones; the avi file played fine on my Samsung DVD player that has a usb port."
