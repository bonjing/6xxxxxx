This visually stunning, all-new production of Nutcracker, choreographed by Helgi Tomasson 
(artistic director of the San Francisco Ballet) is a graceful and timeless adventure on a grand scale. 
The scenic design by Michael Yeargan, setting the tale at the time of the 1915 San Francisco World Fair, is sensational. 
From the lovely Waltz of the Flowers to the crystalline beauty of the stunning Snowflake Waltz, 
each scene is more breathtaking than the last, bringing to life all the well-known and beloved characters 
with fresh sparkle and compelling originality.
