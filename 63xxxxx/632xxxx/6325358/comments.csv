,Joker_Se,2011-04-18T22:30Z,MD87 Expansion Pack From CLS anny one have it ? 
,A380-800,2011-04-19T14:01Z,I don't have the expansion packs only base thats all.
,Grizraz,2011-04-20T21:22Z,"I have the MD-87 expansion pack, but it was purchased from JF as a companion to the DVD edition of the MD81/82. 

If I could figure out how to create a torrent, I'd be willing to share, but am admittedly clueless. "
,Grizraz,2011-04-20T21:23Z,I would share the MD87 pack if I knew how to make a torrent. 
,A380-800,2011-04-20T23:29Z,If you would like to share it thanks in advance..
,gamer2010,2011-05-01T11:00Z,can someone upload cls 767 sp4.please!!!
,Grizraz,2011-05-10T16:40Z,"What part of ""I don't know how to make a torrent"" did you not understand, A380?  It's not like I have been able to find a simple how-to, around here. Instead of whining and thanking in advance, vector me to a how-to, and I can share what is wanted. "
,Grizraz,2011-05-10T16:41Z,"What part of ""I don't know how to make a torrent"" wasn't clear for you, A380-800? Instead of blythely thanking me, how about steering me to a how-to? "
,Grizraz,2011-05-10T17:39Z,"Made the torrent; can't seem to get it to seed. It's not like there is a definitive, standard how-to out there. It seems like I am missing something. Shouldn't I be able to see some seeding progress within my torrent client?  

I have abandoned the effort, for now. "
,madmanquincy,2011-05-14T22:15Z,@Grizraz. Did u upload the torrent to Pirate bay. Hey it was hell of a ride my first time trying create a torrent for the MD-81 but its very simple. How can I help?
,bungunner,2011-05-16T03:12Z,"Hey thank you very much for this torrent, but  I can't seem to get the virtual cockpit in this.  There is nothing there but the scenery when I choose it.  Does anybody know of a fix for this?  I've tried both versions with and without SP2.  Thanks"
,madmanquincy,2011-05-16T14:37Z,@Bungunner while your in the cockpit there should be a drop down menu on the top left of the panel. In there you would be able to switch to the Virtual Cockpit.
,madmanquincy,2011-06-07T15:43Z,@ve2910 Cause yo ass can't follow instructions WTF!
,hini29,2011-06-27T21:34Z,Followed the steps 100% correctly but I didn't got the gauges to work :(
