,skillet92,2011-04-18T10:18Z,"I have made a season pack of the mildred pierce and uploaded it in 1337x!

the reason i uploaded it there was because i wasnt able to upload in TPB!

here is the link to the torrent!
Pls help me seed!

http://1337x.org/torrent/190753/0/"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-18T12:42Z,"Procedure for helping (for all who have my encodings of Mildred Pierce) is disturbingly simple:
1. Click on link
2. Download torrent
3. Start torrent for minute or two, just to get folder created
4. Open that folder
5. Hit Search. Search location should be folder or drive where you keep existing encodes, search for word ""mildred""
6. When files have been found, hold Ctrl and click on each - they all should be ""highlighted""
7. Right-click and choose Copy
8. Paste copies of all files you have into newly created folder named ""Mildred Pierce"" (by torrent, in step 3.), overwriting eventually existing (but ""empty"") file
9. When you have five files/episodes and folder - right-click on stopped torrent and choose ""Recheck""
10. When Recheck finishes - hit Start

Now you help to seed."
