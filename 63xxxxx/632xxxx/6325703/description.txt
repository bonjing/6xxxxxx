Genre: Docudrama

Description:
In early 1972, 30-year-old journalist and editor, Ita Buttrose and 35
-year old Kerry Packer, heir to what was then Australias most 
ruthlessly powerful and influential publishing family, got together to 
create a magazine that became one of the most dramatic sensations 
in Australian publishing history. CLEO went on to help define women, 
Australia and the relationship between the two. Research and 
marketing analysis showed the project would be a failure and the 
magazine was vehemently opposed by the powerful head of the 
Packer clan, the domineering Sir Frank Packer (known to his 
employees as God), yet Ita and Kerry, knowing the consequences 
of failure would be dire, decided to back their gut instincts anyway.

With courage and a stubborn belief in each other the odd couple 
went for it, and the result was a magazine that not only surfed the 
emerging 70s zeitgeist, but led the way in articulating for women a 
new way of thinking about themselves and their place in cultural 
Australia. Women readers found in CLEO a manifesto for a new 
confidence and an argument against the entrenched patriarchy that 
had for too long defined the relationship between the sexes. Filled 
with intelligence, wit, and a go for it attitude, the fledgling CLEO 
took off on its first issue, taking Kerry, Ita, and a hand-picked bunch 
of iconoclastic staffers along for the ride. CLEO was a womens 
magazine with a libido and a curiosity about almost everything...

Produced by John Edwards and Karen Radzyner, PAPER GIANTS: 
THE BIRTH OF CLEO is a Southern Star Entertainment production in 
association with Screen NSW, Screen Australia and ABC TV. 
Executive Producer - ABC TV Head of Fiction, Carole Sklan.
