,kian89,2011-04-19T18:12Z,"HolyRoses @ hey man , I have a Q , i was hoping u cud help me with that ,

So m Encoding that show for ipod.
It is available in Large files on TBP and i wanted to encode it in smaller files for storage,and for ppl like myself with slow connections

Here are the MPC properties :
---------------------------------------------------
Video: Xvid 624x352 23.98fps [Stream 00]
Audio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 125Kbps [Stream 01]
---------------------------------------------------

My Desired Output was:
---------------------------------------------------
Video:
Resolution: 480x272
Codec: x264
Bitrate: 300kbps
----------------------------------------------------


So when i encode it at 23.980fps m get a A'V , desync
When i encode it with 23.987fps still i get Desync
And same is with 25fps

and audio m doing 
112kbps,44.1KHz(i tried CBR,ABR)
