    An eagle-eyed forest ranger spotted bits of Roman          
    building poking out from the forest floor in              
    Cambridgeshire's Bedford Purlieus Wood.                  
                                                              
    And cutting-edge aerial visualisations reveal evidence     
    of a complex of building foundations hidden in the        
    woods. Tony and the Team investigate what these          
    buildings were and why they were here.                    
                                                               
    It's a straightforward question, but the dig is one of    
    the most challenging of the series: it's almost          
    impossible for geophysics to operate in the cramped       
    woodland environment; the diggers can't see each           
    other's trenches for the trees; and a thick layer of      
    autumn leaves add to the general disorientation.         
                                                              
    But the Team manage to uncover substantial buildings,      
    intricate finds and what looks suspiciously like a        
    statue. Over three days they piece together a tale of    
    Roman industry and trade, and what may be the key to      
    understanding the site: the presence of a fancy            
    bath-house.

    Well Channel 4 in their wisdom have labelled this          
    particular episode Series 17 Episode 13, so who are we    
    to argue, the usual episode guide sites may have this    
    numbered differently, but in most cases they are run by   
    are fans/volunteers so are not an official source.         
    On a few other topics, I guess we pissed on another       
    groups cornflakes in a past life as they have targeted   
    virtually every series we have done lately or in the      
    past, this ones for you guys,                              
    On another note we will no longer consider ourselves      
    bound by the recent uk.tv.xvid ruleset, not all groups   
    that signed are fully abiding by it, you know who you     
    are.                                                       
    Lastly the tv x264 ruleset is way out of date and         
    needs revising, things have moved on a lot since the     
    last official one. You'll notice we didnt sign that       
    either, we like to be consulted not told after the fact.
