,iscy,2011-04-21T18:45Z,"I should have this one in two hours. If it works, I'll seed and comment and post a patch for the original one that CHARGED (9.95gb) released. If it doesn't I'll just comment here.. :)"
,iscy,2011-04-21T23:31Z,This torrent works on 3.55 CFW *but* you have to modify PARAM.SFO to skip the firmware update.
,iscy,2011-04-22T00:04Z,"To play on 3.55 KMEAW, apply this patch:

,-spook-,2011-04-22T12:24Z,Downloading the torrent now. Will confirm if it does work. 
,EdisDee,2011-04-22T12:54Z,will this run on 3.41 JailBreak?
,uzairkhan,2011-04-22T14:59Z,tell me if it workx on 3.41.................???hv waxted alot on charged one:(((( :@
,iscy,2011-04-22T16:53Z,"I haven't checked 3.41, but the fixed PARAM.SFO is set to require 3.40+. It all depends on the actual EBOOT. I think you may be able to find an EBOOT online that was modified to run on 3.41."
,hairyshit,2011-04-23T20:19Z,"Ok I've tested this one on kmew3.55 with multiman from an EXT HD and it works fine, just remember to install the .pkg patch included in the torrent, I also let multiman auto patch the .sfo file (not sure if it is wise to do so but it works all the same)."
,bigbang212,2011-04-23T23:01Z,"Thanks for the upload. This game works perfectly, I patched the eboot and param file using ebootFix from multiman just in case and the game works perfectly. Just need to install included package to get fatalities/ special moves to work. 

Running on 3.55 cfw Kmeaw, multiman 1.17, dragonFTP"
,dante2011,2011-04-24T01:38Z,"thanks consolasatope!
works perfectly on 3.41 with open manager II
just don't install the patch (pkg) that comes with it,
look for the eboot fix 3.41 (eboot & sprx files) on the web and replace the old ones,
then on open manager: make sure you turn on the Blueray needed (click start), insert a BR original disc, and you're good to go! special moves and fatalities and all modes work!!"
,MetronHoi,2011-04-24T21:07Z,"Please seed more fellas, and remove your upload cap (atleast for this torrent)."

Thanks in advance"
,heads1897,2011-04-28T23:02Z,Hey Iscy i am not able to run it on my Ps3 it just shows a black screen please help
,iscy,2011-04-29T06:29Z,"@heads1897 Are you a bit used with those torrents?
1. Get this torrent as well as the FIX released
2. Copy the whole BLUS-.. directory into the usual place on your PS3 (dev_hdd0/GAMES ?)
3. Overwrite the PARAM.SFO file by the one included in the FIX torrent
4. Install the 1.01 game patch included in this torrent (UP108[...].pkg)
5. Within your backup manager, fix the permissions of the directory
6. Enjoy
I'm almost done with the story mode now.. I can confirm that it works very well.
It has been tested on 3.55 KMEAW with both Gaia and Multiman. Other people reported that it works with other loaders.
If you are still on 3.41 (or less than 3.55), update to the official 3.55 and install KMEAW CFW."
,heads1897,2011-04-29T08:54Z,Thank you i followed the steps and it works perfectly. Thanks again man.
,heads1897,2011-04-29T08:55Z,This torrent works the other torrent which is Mortal kombat PS3 charged does not work
,seeloa81,2011-04-29T15:14Z,k. im calling this one fake. if someone can prove me wrong...plz lol
,iscy,2011-04-29T18:12Z,"@seeloa81 I've been helping so many ppl to get this one working, call it whatever you want.. but it does indeed work. What you have to understand is this torrent is *exactly* a 1:1 copy of the retail game. In other words, you need to fix it a bit to make it working because this game requires 3.56 to run. So get it, get the fix, overwrite the file which the fix provides, and install the official 1.01 game patch and you'll have it working.

BTW, once you get half way through the story mode of this game, there is a trophy called ""50% Completed!"". And now, if you really don't believe me, then go get the friggin game at the story and update to 3.56... I really couldn't care less."
,heads1897,2011-05-01T18:21Z,Hey can we play online as PSN is back and Sony is giving PSN plus service free for 30 days it would be very good if we can play it online

,alefmts,2011-09-26T02:51Z,"This torrent is not fake, but the EBOOT.BIN and DFENGINE.SPRX didn't work for me, so pay attention if you are having the problem with black screen.
The patch that comes with this torrent, it's only to fix fatalities, x-rays, etcs... it doesn't have any relation with black screen, this problem can be solved getting this 2 files in this link and replace them in PS3_GAME\USRDIR
Any questions, just let me know!!!

Enjoy"

I would prefer direct dl to ps3, but since i already have it dl on my laptop, transfer instructions will also be helpful. thanks!"
,WinterGale,2012-05-29T13:35Z,"@SijoSilLum

1. Use an external hard drive or at least a 16gb flash drive.
2. Make sure your external hard drive or flash drive is FAT32 formatted.
3. In case there are files larger than 4gb in the game, use ps3 splitter.
4. Plug your flash drive or external HD into your ps3 and use a backup manager to copy the game into your ps3."
