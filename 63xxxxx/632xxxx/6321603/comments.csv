Because if you can you got my download"
,garthbartin,2011-04-28T04:08Z,"Great torrent, works wonderfully, all the mods are really good. Multiplayer doesn't work though. If you want multiplayer you should get a hold of an unmodified patched .exe and use a mini image."
,masterjedi170,2011-05-04T22:47Z,Use game ranger.  They just barely made it work for multiplayer and people are already hosting it.  Lets play :)
,masterjedi170,2011-05-06T19:16Z,"For some reason when we play single player everything is okay, but when we try multiplayer it crashes and goesback to the desktop.  I try the mic thing and mouting the image, same problem :("
,Shade217,2011-05-07T05:15Z,"you guys are morons...
come on, how will you play a pirated game online..you need a real working key. buy it if you wanna play online.
or just get on cracked servers, or use garena."
,masterjedi170,2011-05-07T08:20Z,"People told me to try this one but i wasn't sure.  You guys this torrent is AWSESOME!  Not only does it make it easy but we can play on game ranger without any hassle of updating

If you want to play online download this one!  No serial or anything and you get the extra mods.  You get a couple new maps and troops.  People are already hosting this game and its working!  

I been hosting already and everything seems good.  Doesnt seem to go to the desktop or anything.  Thank you for this awesome torrent!"
,masterjedi170,2011-05-07T08:39Z,This game really works on game ranger online.  For those ppl who install and game ranger cant find the game make sure you know which path is installed! 
,Alpha087,2011-05-11T17:51Z,"This one has the crash-to-desktop problem for Windows XP, just a heads up."
,masterjedi170,2011-05-13T23:35Z,"Other people have that problem about crashing and going to desktop.  Some people say its because of the sound and other say sound device.  Google it and i am sure you can find a solution.

The only bad thing about this are some mods may get glitchy.  And when you host in gameranger must have to the mods if you are hosting NONE official maps.  If you just host the regular maps you are fine, but you just have to distinguished which is the official maps and which aren't.  But the mods do work and are fun, so lets download and play :)"
,kostya-kaufman,2011-05-16T02:13Z,"Everything worked ,even multiplayer, but later I tried to play online again and it said wrong CD code for your game "
,kostya-kaufman,2011-05-16T02:16Z,"and I don't know how to install mods .Write the instructions please, and for multiplayer too"
,kostya-kaufman,2011-05-16T02:21Z,"and I didn't get how to install mods, make the instruction please"
,kostya-kaufman,2011-05-16T02:21Z,"and I didn't get how to install mods ,please explain"
,TE5LA,2011-05-17T04:35Z,I can run a dedicated server that anyone can join if enough people want.
,masterjedi170,2011-05-17T23:25Z,"You guys this is very easy to install.  All you have to do is download this and run the  exe.  Nothing else!  Of course u wont be able to play online since you wont have a real serial code so google gameranger and download that program.  With that program you can play online without a valid serial.

Once you  have everything fix and you are onn gameranger whne you host becareful on the maps you chooose.  If you host original maps then anybody can join but if you are hosting moded maps then only people with the mods can join, and not many have them yet.  Hence look at the version unofficial patch v1.3.   

Also i notice when you are trying to join games on game ranger you might have to try at least THREE times.  Sometimes it glitches and sends you back to main menu or game spy which we dont have.  So if that happens cancel and go back to the game ranger screen and click rejoin.  I have playing these game since game ranger has it and its been fun =]  Tell your friends!"

,noobie556,2011-07-16T12:43Z,"hello there, i accoualy have a problem.. or.. what do you do when you get message "" please insert disc 2 and click okey"" ???"
,masterjedi170,2011-07-20T08:32Z,"Yeah i dont understand why this game glitches.  The real serial version doesn't crash at all. So it looks like it can be the mods or gameranger that makes it crash.  

One game it took me 2 tries to get in.  Another game took me about 9 tries to get in.  I am not sure why.  Oh well"

,masterjedi170,2011-07-26T06:32Z,"@poepei if you want to play the mission or the real game download the crack.  But if you play game ranger with this game it should work with no CD.  Just host a game or join, then start it up and it should work.  If it doesn't then burn a cd using ISO.  

Keep on hosting guys :D"

,xap4oru,2011-09-16T16:28Z,"New updated version:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6680924"
,masterjedi170,2011-09-17T07:50Z,"For all those that have cd problems: This game is mainly to be use for multiplayer on game ranger.  if you are trying to start solo then you might have to download a crack or something else.

For those that host:  So for those who host i notice kashyyk, bespin platforms, and the naboo prototype map glitches.  What i mean by glitches is when we are playing it just kicks us out and usually few people stay on.  

For those who are first time playing on game ranger:  To those who just recently downloaded make sure your routers/firewall lets the game go through.  Once that is done and are trying to join a game make sure you see lan on the top left when you are trying to join.
If you do see LAN on top left then it should join automatically.  Sometimes it takes you to the main menu or game spy.  If that happens cancel go to multiplayer and click LAN.  You should be able to see it :)
Have fun!"

,Valu123,2012-02-01T10:03Z,"Dear uploader: I managed to download and run the game without a problem, and everything works fine except for the fact that I can't seem to get the mods working. When I activate the mods in the launcher, there is a pause, then command prompt flashes very quickly, I think signifying that the mod was successfully activated. However when I play the game, nothing seems to have changed at all, no new maps, campaigns or units. If you or any other person could please explain how to get this feature working, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance."
