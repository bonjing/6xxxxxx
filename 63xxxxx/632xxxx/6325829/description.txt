This highly rated production of Manon by The Australian Ballet was recorded live at the Adelaide Festival Centre. 
It features premier dancers Justine Summers, Steven Heathcote, Nigel Burley, Jonathan Kelly, Lynette Wills and Paul de Masson.

In 18th century Paris, Manon, a captivating young woman, falls passionately in love with a penniless student, des Grieux. Manipulated by her avaricious brother, she makes a fatal decision to shun her true love and exploit the pleasures of wealth. Des Grieux, a victim of Manon's desires and depravity, 
sacrifices everything to follow her to a tragic end.

"A spectacular drama of lust, greed and deathâ€¦ raunchy in subject matter and robust in interpretation. 
It is also graceful, beautiful and moving, action-packed and highly entertaining."
