When I just fill in the request code into the keygen and I use the code that it gives me Maya says there is something wrong with the code!:S"
,alshoura,2011-05-13T15:16Z,"I have the exact same problem as NelisW2 above. Also worth mentioning that the instructions file is one of the worst I've seen.
Thnx to Stun for the upload, but maybe you should tell us if there's a solution to this. I'm using Win 7 32 bit btw."
,alshoura,2011-05-13T15:35Z,"OK. To anyone who has this problem, one thing the instructions file misses is that you need to run the patch as administrator, not just double click it. This makes it work and all is good.

Thnx again Stun for the upload. works fine."

,mgboi,2012-01-04T01:59Z,"guys.... i have a different problem. i put in the serial # and product key and then it started installing, but later it said this:

error 1305. error reading from file C;/ program files (86)/Autodesk/Maya2012/brushImages/oakWhiteBark.tif. Verify that the file exsists and that you can access it. so i went in to that folder, found the file, tried to open it, it opened in photo viewer but said: Windows Photo Viewer cant open this picture  because the picture is being edited in another program. no other program was open except for the setup. wut do i do? :((((("
