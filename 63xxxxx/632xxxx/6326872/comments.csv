,who..,2011-04-21T08:49Z,"Thank you very much,will seed at least for a week! :)"
,fallout11,2011-05-07T14:38Z,"Fantastic series, award winning and well worth watching. "
,furiseto,2011-05-29T16:31Z,"For anyone who wants to see the films with subtitles downloading from the internet. Episode 1 & 2 don't have the TV fade-out and fade-in so the sub would be out of sync after some parts of the ep. But only the first 2 episode of the first season.

All the rest is fine. The best option is finding someone who know how to shift time of those two ep's subs for u (very quick if that person knows what he's doing)"
,JamIsTasty,2011-06-06T10:06Z,Please seed!  This is such an awesome show and I really want it in this higher quality!
,DamageIncM,2011-06-15T01:20Z,"I'd like better quality than this other download I have.
But why does the upscaled version look DIFFERENT?
I mean, as described, the lines and thinner and such, it seems like a whole different drawing-style all of a sudden.
I don't think it's the meaning of ""higher quality"", as it changes the artist's work.
I mean, even if it's in SD, it can still be of high quality, being DVD-quality then, which should also represent as it was made, even though not with as much detail.
Imagine it happening with a film, different lines and such... would be weird.

Anyway, I'll give it a try, I'm not a fan or anything yet.
Only watched about 3 episodes, but the quality was crap and made it less enjoyable.

How's the audio on this?
Cause it was too loud and messy on this other download I tried too.
I'll just try this anyway..."
,furiseto,2011-06-15T11:54Z,"@DamageIncM:
Yes, like u said, upscaling doesn't mean ""high quality"". Upscaling is a method that u must sacrifice some little details to trade for something sharper and cleaner. Because of that, it would be kind of bad if the film being upscaled is live-action or anime full of small details. But I guarantee u that no scenes in this upscaled release is out of place or weird.

And yes, give this one a try and compare which one is more beautiful on your monitor / worth saving to your disk space. U are free to decide, buddy."
,hosukka,2011-06-15T13:40Z,Whats the codec? i cannot open this whit vlc
,furiseto,2011-06-15T17:09Z,"@hosukka:
VLC is a shitty player and no encoder recommends to use it to play the video. 

http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net/"

,DamageIncM,2011-06-15T17:23Z,"Unfortunately, those Matrushka-files (or whatever) don't read on the PS3, so I personally can't use them on the big screen.

Can I convert them or something?...

I've had more problems with getting those files to work on media-players and such.
They do work on the PC here, just fine, but not on the PS3 and another media-player and on burned discs neither..."
,DamageIncM,2011-06-15T20:02Z,"@hosukka:

http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net/

Well, that's weird.
Cause the VLC-one is the only player of many I've tried that plays about anything I throw at it.

Also, I just gave the other one in the link a try.
And the first thing I tried to play it said ""Cannot render video."" .
How ironic is that. :P

Also, I can actually play the videos in this torrent with VLC Media Player.
No additional codecs used.
So something's up with hosukka's software I guess..."
,NG14916,2011-06-15T22:09Z,"@DamageIncM:

Install the combined community codec pack, found here:
http://www.cccp-project.net/

Then both media player classic and windows media player will be able to play .mkv files. You'll find, though, that media player classic is the best one to use."
,MadeInGreece,2011-07-07T22:44Z,There are some tracks missing...
,furiseto,2011-07-08T19:46Z,"@MadeInGreece: Yeah, the OST is unofficial so there has to have missing tracks. But I think the team responsible for releasing this unofficial OST has updated their work. Try to find their latest one by google."
,MadeInGreece,2011-07-08T22:37Z,@furiseto: You have a point.By the way I signed your petition and I will try to make more people sign it.According to IMDB (interner movie database) Avatar the last airbender series is the 25th best tv show of all time meaning that Nick should definetely invest more money in the Avatar franchise in a more wise way than they did last time by ruining a unique chance of making a commercially and successful trilogy.I think that Nickelodeon has understood its mistakes and so I hope that we will the Avatar official Ost as well as the Avatar BR quite soon.
,mrhellsfury,2011-07-20T21:53Z,"IF you fucktarts haven't learned this by now if you want a good player get jet audio, as a rule of thumb if jetaudio doesn't play it and neither does wmp then its a fucking virus"
,thatguyfosho,2011-07-23T13:28Z,"Thanks for the upload. First episode looks great, so far."
,infernopirate,2011-07-24T06:42Z,"do u mind uploading this without the upscaling? id rather have better quality then an upscale. 
P.S. great torrent and thanks its far superior to the other ones out there "
,mmmp9sjl,2011-07-31T02:50Z,"very good quality upscaling. contrasts and details preserved. watching this, i've started to see details of the series i've never noticed before, highly recommened. thanks for the efforts!"
