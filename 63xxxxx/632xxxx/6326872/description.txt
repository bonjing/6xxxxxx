First, yes, this is the upscale version of the DVD Avatar. However, I believe that this one has the best quality you could find on the internet with almost no ghosting in the first 4 episodes (It's still there but you wont even notice), thinner lines, sharper and cleaner images. The torrent contains:


. Full 3 seasons of the series (61 eps)
. 3 chibi shorts
. The animated graphic novel: Escape from the spirit world
. The un-aired pilot episode without commentary
. The unofficial OST

If you are an Avatar hard-core fan like me and you are hungry for more high quality, give this one a try. If you hate upscale, then don't even download it. But I guarantee that this is really worth your time (especially someone who has a HDTV 37inc or above)

Last, if you love Avatar, then buy the DVDs. Also please support these 2 petitions to make the official Avatar BD and Avatar OST become reality.
