was imprisoned for getting the hostages killed (even though they were beforehand). 
Meanwhile, the King is seen finishing building Octus. The invasion occurs and Hobbes is injured and returns Ilana 
to the palace with both of them alive, and Lance\'s commander is revealed to be a traitor for Modula.

and crush the Galalunian People\'s spirit. As our three heroes try to prepare for the dance,Lance and Kristin 
go a little further in their relationship with a karate bout, but she declines his request to join him at the dance. 
Issues arise when the creature arrives just as they are about to depart for the dance. 
Titan at first fails poorly, as Octus and Ilana are distracted by missing the dance and making Kimmy feeling guilty and upset. 
However, Lance\'s lack of concern for their feelings pushes Ilana and Octus over the top, 
and the creature is soundly defeated as a result of their frustration. 
Later, Kimmy, fed up with Octus\'s \"bathroom\" disappearances, breaks up with him, while Ilana and Lance share a dance 
under the spotlight, their dates having run off together. Modula, after destroying the alien, 
continues plotting a way to destroy Ilana once and for all.

Titan arrives at the space station and are able to survive one encounter with the creature thanks to Solomon. 
He explains it is a creature made of pure energy and when it drains the energy of something, it cannot be recharged. 
As they flee from the creature, Octus is hit by the creature in his leg, and cannot fix it. 
The gang then decide to contain the creature instead of destroying it.Lance and Solomon head towards the creature 
while Octus and Ilana hide. They manage to trap the creature temporarily, until Solomon\'s ship arrives. 
All of them escape, except for Lance due to the cable breaking. Octus saves him but is drained by the creature. 
When they try to recharge his mainframe it fails, and after an angry Lance uses Solomon\'s ship to destroy the station and 
the creature within, he and Ilana blames Octus death.

General Steel reveals a giant robot named The \"Homeland Mobile Emergency Robot\" HMER (nicknamed the Hammer); 
constructed from the metal scraps of the gigantic rocket that Tashy was sent to Earth in; 
which he uses to defeat the creature. Lance believes that if they can sneak into the army base 
with the recharge unit for The Hammer, they will have enough power to reboot Octus, 
but they are discovered and find themselves fighting the army & The Hammer. 
Without the power of Titan, they are both easily overwhelmed. G3 intervenes to rescue Lance and Ilana, 
and they join forces to prepare to battle against General Steel & The Hammer.
