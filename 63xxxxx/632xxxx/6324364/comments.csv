,.ANCIENT.,2011-05-18T17:56Z,Thank you so much for this upload! I've been hoping somebody would notice the quality of this series. Too bad was cancelled only after the first run of 20 episodes. Luckily you got the all here though! :)
,ze_bony,2011-09-20T19:34Z,Thank you very much for uploading this. The quality is very good and the show itself is an under appreciated gem.
,Sid_Slurms,2011-12-01T06:46Z,"Episodes 3, 5, and 11 are pretty shitty quality but still watchable, and you can get em separately easily enough. The rest are all HDTVrips, I believe. Pretty awesome show by the guy that made Samurai Jack and Dexter's Lab. And Brian Posehn is a robot, so that's pretty fucking cool."
