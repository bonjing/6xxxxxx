Founded by â€œprima ballerina assolutaâ€ Alicia Alonso over fifty years ago, 
the National Ballet of Cuba â€“ one of the worldâ€™s best dance companies â€“ 
gives an insight into its extraordinary talent with Don Quixote. 
This joyous, sparkling work is perfectly suited to the companyâ€™s mix of classicism and panache â€“ a style that combines Russian technique and American rapidity with a thoroughly Latin sensibility. 
Performed in the original Alicia Alonso version, Don Quixote devotes all of its two hours to authentic Spanish dance: sensational portÃ©s, vertiginous leaps, splendid pirouettes, sublime solos and stunning variations. Viengsay ValdÃ©s (Kitri) and Romel FrÃ³meta (Basilio) are an absolute delight: technical prowess, powerful stage presence and a flair that permeates every step, every movement.
