World-renouned choir Cappella Romana melds top-quality byzantine chant with thorough schollarship to bring this two disk, complete rendition of the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom.  It is chanted in English, and contains complete hymnody, and all the priest's prayers.  The melodies are from the 13th century.  The celebrants were Fr. Meletios Webber and Archdeacon John Xrishadis.  The conductor was Dr. Alexander Lingas, and it was recorded in St. Barbara  Greek Orthodox Church in Connecticut.  Enjoy!
