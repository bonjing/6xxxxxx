This video was hard to find. I gave up searching some time ago. Everywhere there were

plenty of downloads of The Mill on the Floss in book form but no 1978 movie version.

But through the good offices of Mr. Alex_Riabinin, I was steered to a distant copy.

After downloading it and sampling it I was undecided whether to send it out in an 

upload. The two problems were/are: 1) it is primarily in the Russian language and 2)

there are no subtitles. These disadvantages alone were enough to stop me short. My

wife and I are pretty dependent on subtitles unless the quality of the movie is high 

with clear, distinct speech. The presence of English as a second audio track is easy

enough to manage but is a disadvantage. I use VLC (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/)

as the player: right-click on the picture and follow AUDIO to select track 2. Since

I am not enthusiastic I'm not working at how to use other players and how to keep it

permanent
