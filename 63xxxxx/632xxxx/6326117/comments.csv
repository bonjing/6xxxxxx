,raterillo,2011-06-17T16:43Z,"2 cores is just fine to play it, I have intel E 7500 and nvidia gts 250 and plays fine (I play very good Crysis 2 too!), thanks for the upload"
,joeri86,2011-06-17T21:30Z,"Been kind of a trick to let this game run on a Core2Duo 2.0Ghz Processor with 2Gb of ram and a Geforce 8300GS 128mb videocard (ok, its overclocked.. maybe it is 256mb after all) And i have to say, if you are not that kind of a graphicswhore and turn your gamesettings to the lowest, the game is pretty playeble...

,appl3mania141,2011-07-15T05:06Z,"To the people saying they can connect to multiplayer, on the ps3 version you can click local instead of internet on the multiplayer menu and start a private match on ur own. then in the game settings u can add the number of enemies (bots). i havent tried it on the PC version but hopefully it is the same. 

btw, what do i do with all the zip files once downloaded?"
