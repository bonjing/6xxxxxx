69 Park Avenue [Classic 1985][DvdRip]

Tom Byron stars in this raucous romp from 1985, playing a cub reporter out to nab his first scoop. his assignment is to uncover the dirt on an old Victorian house that's been turned into the city's liveliest brothel. The madam of the house is Colleen Brennan, a buxom beauty who regales Tom with tantalizing tales of what's gone on within the house's walls. We watch her torrid tales come to life as one lascivious lust bunny after another gets down and dirty with her clients, each one more sexually explosive than the last. Filled with the top-heavy charms of naturally busty babes Little Oral Annie, Erica Boyer, and Patti Petite, 69 Park Avenue is one address that you'll find yourself visiting again and again.
