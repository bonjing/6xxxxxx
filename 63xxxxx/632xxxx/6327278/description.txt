Though there is no sure way of protecting your video's online you can make it harder for the "Average Joe" to get your video.

Vurl-e is a PHP script that helps protect your online video on your website by encoding the URL and not showing the true URL. The True URL is stored in a MySQL DB and translated by the script to display your video.

Requirements:

- PHP 5.x
- MySQL

The script is a rough copy and still needs work but works out of the box and be be added to any website with little effort..
