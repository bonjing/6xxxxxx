,cantech,2011-04-18T23:49Z,decent 6A and 6V with occasional out of focus issues you can hear clearly though. thanks to the uploader
,Gohei27,2011-04-19T20:24Z,"IMO, its un-watchable. constant noise in the background and the camera seems to lose focus during any quick movement. so for an action flick, a lot. i didn't finish watching it so i can't say the entire movie is like this. i appreciate the uploader upping this, sorry to dislike it. :("
