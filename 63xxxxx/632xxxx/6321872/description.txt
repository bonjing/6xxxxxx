Hi

This is the srt file for my upload of Flashpoint.Dou.Fo.Sin.2007.DVDRip.HC.Eng.Subs

Sorry for not including them in the original upload.

My prefered way of adding subs to a divx movie is :-

Download aviaddxsub

Place movie file and srt file in same folder and make sure they both have the same file name. (Not including the .avi, .divx, .srt, etc obviously).

Launch addxsub and drag the folder over. 

Click start.

And voila.

In approximately 5 mins you will have a subtitled movie ready to watch in the same folder containing the files.
