For the first time on British television, drug dealers describe in detail the tricks of their trade; their profits, the risks and the reasons why they deal.

The film unlocks the occult world of 'Dealers' and explodes the myths of drug taking in London. "It's just like Pizza Hut or Dominoes, 30 minutes guaranteed delivery", says a dealer known as the Ticketman.

This Documentary series follows the workings of the drugs trade in the Uk and in Spain.
