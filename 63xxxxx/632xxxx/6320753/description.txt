About The Singer
----------------
Kevin Chalfant is a singer-songwriter and a native of Streator, Illinois. He obtained a BMI award for co-writing and singing on one of the most frequently aired rock radio hits of 1992 and 1993, "Iâ€™ve Got A Lot To Learn About Love"', by The Storm. In 1994, he temporarily replaced Steve Perry in Journey, and in 2003, he toured as lead vocalist for the Alan Parsons Live Project

Chalfant's first national success came when he joined AOR group 707 in 1982. With Chalfant on lead vocals, the band enjoyed its biggest hit, "Mega Force", which peaked at #12 on Billboard 's Mainstream Rock chart. That success, however, was not enough to assuage internal conflicts and the group disbanded before a follow-up could be recorded.

In 1984, Chalfant joined the band Steel Breeze. He recorded one album with the band, Heart on the Line, before leaving in 1985. Around that time he sang "Hold On to the Vision", the theme to the film No Retreat, No Surrender, featuring Joe Satriani on guitar.

Chalfant later formed The Storm in 1990 with guitarist Josh Ramos and former Journey members Ross Valory (bass), Gregg Rolie (keys) and Steve Smith (drums).

Lyrics
------
Nobody told you, that you'd face the truth alone
But you got the power to begin
Let your self wonder, let your spirit find the way
and reach for the power from within

You got no reason to let people keep you down
Stand up and fight for what you are
And your biggest challenge
is the one that lies within yourself
know what you're fighting for


Hold on to the Vision in your eyes
Keep the Fire burning bright
got to make them realized
Only with this power can you rise
Hold on to that Vision in your eyes


Never surrender,to the clouds inside your mind
Never retreat from who you are
know - Love is a magic that you carry on in on, in on, in on
Know what you're fighting for


Hold on to the Vision in your eyes
Keep the Fire burning bright
got to make them realized
Only with this power can you rise
Hold on to that Vision in your eyes
