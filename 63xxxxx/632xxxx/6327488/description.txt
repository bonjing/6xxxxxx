
Minecraft Portable

Welcome to my Portable Release of Minecraft
I've tried to make it as simple as possible:

File List:
=======================================
minecraft.exe       ---  The Regular Minecraft executable. If you launch this,
                         It starts Minecraft in Local Version
mineCraftNOPAY.exe  ---  Same as above, but if you do not want to pay for the
                         Game. You can't join all Servers with this.
launcher.exe        ---  launches Minecraft in a portable Version
makePortable.exe    ---  Copies an existing Local Profile to the Portable Storage
ToLocal.exe         ---  Copies a Portable profile back to the Lacal Storage
CHOICE.COM          ---  Yes-no-Cancel Thing, DO NOT DELETE
Readme.txt          ---  problem?
.minecraft          ---  The Portable Storage
=======================================

launcher.exe asks you which minecraft Version you want to launch.

the "makePortable" is not required to launch Minecraft portable, it just allows
you to copy your local profile to the Portable one, allowing you to carry all
your already built Worlds with you.

the "ToLocal" it the opposite from the makePortable, it allows you to copy a
portable Profile back to the local Storage.

I've included a small world I have built, (and a Map)
it's a small Train level that you can use if you do not want to start from
scratch. There is also a "Nether Express" in the World with some awesome
Railway Tracks! The automated operated Railway Lines (those with two paralel
Tracks) sometimes can get stuck if you leave or enter the Nether Express at
the wrong time but this can be fixed by manually move the Trains to the
Stations.

I've also included The folowing Mods:
-> Single Player Command
-> Pistons (Block ID for /give Command: 100)
Please Note: The Mods are lost if an Update is automatically downloaded
and you need to reintegrate the Mods, just read in the Minecraft Forums
