,charlilolo,2011-06-15T09:03Z,"sorry everyone, i'm seeding as much as possible through a bad net connection! 
@Earia try removing the torrent but don't delete the files or the torrent. Then reload it into your program and make sure you select all the same files again then everything you've already downloaded should be fine and fix any problems?"
