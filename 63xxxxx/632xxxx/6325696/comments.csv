,deltaglider,2011-05-05T17:56Z,"I do not understand this:restart Autodesk Product.
I have successfully installed but now I have multiple folders in the start menu: Autodesk/Autodesk 3ds Max 2012 32-bit - English, Autodesk/Autodesk FBX Plug-ins, etc. Which program do I need to open?

,fs4me,2011-07-02T21:09Z,Thank You for this upload.  Can anyone tell me why the mem patch button tells me: You need to apply patch when licence screen appears?  I copied the request and I pressed the generate button but I can't finish the activation. I'm sure its something that I am missing.....can someone help? 
,zumolico16,2011-07-11T03:20Z,"i got the same problem, can someone help us?"
,70rr4nce,2011-09-21T20:44Z,"Thanx a lot! Thats what I had been looking for.

The Activation procedure as described in the CRACK-Folder in the iso had to be slightly modified: 

Do not disconnect internet. In order to come to the window where you can radio the ""I have got an activation code ..."" there has to be an active  internet connection. "
,lazer52,2011-11-29T13:57Z,"Thanx for the program. But exactly when shall I press the button ""Mempatch"" to avoid the message ""You need to apply patch when licence screen appears"" I have my internetconnection on and first push the button ""Activate..."" then ""close"" and then  activate and ""I have an activation...""
But still this message ""You need to apply.."" comes"
