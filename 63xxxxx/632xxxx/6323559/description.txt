I bought this on LP when it came out on import LP in 1979 and have waited for a CD reissue ever since - thanks KOCH for putting out a nice package, with personal, insightful liner notes and amazing bonus tracks, including the infamous reggae-dub cover of "I HEAR IT THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE" that Island chief Chris Blackwell allegedly tried to get the girls to release to radio in place of the far-more-hard-sell "TYPICAL GIRLS" -and maybe things would have been different for The Slits? No matter, CUT is one of the best post-punk/dub/reggae/no-wave/whatever you want to call it albums ever - criminally ignored, often overlooked, but still highly influencial - one listen and you'll know why - with their riddum-dub basslines and infectious chattering call-&-response vocals, The Slits (not trained musicians) managed to concoct a ground-breaking, if off-kilter krew. Pals of THE CLASH and DON LETTS, The Slits were at least two decades ahead of their time. Maybe that's why they weren't a big success the first time out? No one knew quite to make of 'em, much less girls. But along with other circa 1979 LPs like THE CLASH'S LONDON CALLING, PUBLIC IMAGE's PUBLIC IMAGE, BOOMTOWN RATS's THE FINE ART OF SURFACING, THE B-52S and PRETENDERS self-titled debuts and many others, you realize what an amazing year 1979 was for music, smashing rules and finding a bright new path ahead. That was then, this is now...
