A size of incremental backups of ESX VM with LVMs are almost equal to a size of a full backup.

A validation task for an online backup takes too long to complete. 
Updating Acronis Management Server from the previous build may fail, if a computer name contains more than 15 characters. As a workaround, make your computer name less than 15 characters.
