Part 3.
Waldemar Januszczak charts the last two - and most artistically prolific - years of Van Gogh's life. In 1888, the artist moved to Arles, where his alcohol-fuelled troublemaking behaviour continued unabated. Alone, he begged a reluctant Gauguin to come and stay with him, and completed numerous sunflower paintings to decorate Gauguin's room. The stay - just 63 days - was artistically important and productive for them both. But there was intolerable tension between the two and, following a confrontation, Van Gogh mutilated his ear and presented the severed flesh to his favourite prostitute. Unsurprisingly, the next year was spent in an asylum in Saint RÃ©my, where Van Gogh continued to produce seminal works including Starry Night. He later moved to a town near Paris where he spent 69 intensively creative days before shooting himself in the chest. Vincent Van Gogh was 37 when he died and had been an artist for just nine years.
