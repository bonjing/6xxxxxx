,xniggler,2011-04-17T01:19Z,downloading... if this is the real deal then thanks heeeeps! can't wait to check out the new viewport...
,xniggler,2011-04-17T22:39Z,"ok , works great! one thing though , press the mem patch after you've activated it, otherwise it will jump back to not beiing activated when u click finish...

thanks!"
,skomdra,2011-04-18T16:08Z,"This doesn't work. Keygen generates activation code which is 7 charachters too short, does anyone have the same issue? "
,skomdra,2011-04-18T16:17Z,"Ok, I found out the possible solution, it is probably the wrong keygen, on demonoid comments says that this is 2011 keygen, but it works with win64bit version, available here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6305179/AUTODESK_MAYA_V2012_WIN64-ISO so U can use windows to generate code and then back on mac, I hope it works, I'll let you know."
,mn1024,2011-04-20T06:39Z,Can't get it to work. The password generated only fills 14 of the 16 boxes (4 chars per box). Does anyone have a solution?
,simonmack,2011-04-21T08:39Z,"hi guys - im pretty new to this. can someone cool please help me out??

with regard to ***Unpack, burn or mount with D-Tools & install*** im lost. D-Tools looks like a pc app. but i have learned that Disk Utilities in Mac is the way to go. but im still lost because i downloaded everything and im not sure how to mount it. i tried to burn the files to a disk and make a .dmg but that did not work.

also where do i get Keygen from?? pirate bay??

sorry for sounding stupid - i have previously done fairly well here - but i am a little stressed out with several new things which i do not understand - and often get confused that i am using pc fixes for my mac.

step by step how do i get this file to open and app to work on my mac.

anything help - cheers, simo"
,mn1024,2011-04-22T00:29Z,"Hi Simon,
Pretty easy!!! 
1) Go to http://www.unrarx.com/ and download UnrarX
2) Install it 
3) Open finder and go to the directory that contains your downloaded maya.
4) Double click maya2012osx.rar. UnrarX will unpack all the files in sequence and you will get an iso file.
5) Double click the maya2012_osx.iso file and it will mount
6) In the mounted directory you will find the maya dmg file and a crack directory containing the crack dmg
7) Double click each dmg file to mount them.
8) Follow the directions in the install.txt file
9) Good Luck. Unfortunately I couldn't get the crack to work. Maybe you will have more luck :-)"
,simonmack,2011-04-22T08:17Z,"hay mn1024! thanks for the help! you rock... i sorted everything out and managed to get it up and running. but i am having the same issue with the keygen... 7 chrs short. so i can use it for 30 days to start with. i am using little snitch and have blocked the program so hopefully i can continue using this after 30 days - as i do with CS5 programs. if skomdra could post the win keygen separately from the main torrent that would rule - otherwise, thanks again for really helping me out! cheers.

,kriss13,2011-04-26T21:34Z,"The serial generated does not fill all the boxes, it's normal.
It worked perfect for me :)
thx"
,noctourne,2011-04-29T02:40Z,"ok i downloaded everything but
wtf is a keygen
olk can soemone help me because this is frustrating ok
WHAT THE HELL IS A KEYGEN
 I JUST WANT MY SERIAL CODE!:O("
,jajjakajja,2011-04-29T03:31Z,"Thank you for this torrent, Chris,!

To folks who can't get the activation code to work: If it's done exactly as it says in install.txt, it will work. Note section 7: Click on Mem Patch once the activation screen appears. If it is pushed before the activation screen, you will get a error-message saying that the activation code is wrong. Just click Back, click Mem patch and register again, and it should work just fine, even if the activation code don't fill all the boxes."
,jajjakajja,2011-04-29T03:35Z,"noctourne:

You will find the keygen (program which generates key for registering the program) in the folder Crack (mount xf-adesk2012.dmg). Read the install.txt (in the same folder) for info on how to install the program correctly."
,noctourne,2011-04-30T02:26Z,"thank you so much jajjakajja
but when it says: Copy the request code into the keygen and press generate
what is the request code?
im sorry im a total failure at this LOL im surprised i got this far"
,jajjakajja,2011-04-30T03:25Z,"noctourne:

The request code shows up in the autodesk activation window that pops up after you have selected that you want to have the activation code sent to you by e-mail or fax. Maybe you have to run Maya again to get to this window, I don't remember exactly. (The request code is unique and identifies your version of Maya with the details you have given in the registration prosess. It is used for generating an activation code)"
,noctourne,2011-04-30T04:55Z,"ok thank you so much i found it!!!!
and the activation worked! but every time i run maya it just keeps asking me to activate it again and again? does anyone know why this is happening?"
,viviane43,2011-05-13T09:29Z,"Is this currently working for anyone? I get so far as it saying that I've registered it, but an error message comes up when I try to launch it."
,viviane43,2011-05-13T09:38Z,"Nevermind, got it! Did what xniggler said even though it sounded superstitious, also had to force quit Maya because it was being open without looking like it."
,trahbit,2011-07-18T06:10Z,Ok for all those having troubles. If you follow the included instructions and you still have a problem with the request code being short ITS SUPPOSE TO BE!! also the first time I tried it didnt work so i clicked generate code several dozen times and bingo free maya
,Daves_Shed,2011-07-25T18:27Z,The Crack doesn't work in OSX Lion. Anybody found a new one or can fix it?
,xniggler,2011-08-02T01:21Z,need a crack for lion real bad...
,xniggler,2011-08-02T12:28Z,"hey maya &lion peops:
here the solution:
go to the autodesk website , sign up as a student,
download the 2012 software, receive a license code(3 year license) from autodesk, enjoy your fully featured learing edition!"
,danroberto,2011-08-23T13:53Z,"Does not work with Lion, as people already noticed... When I click ""Mem Patch"", I get ""Error! Not Admin, wrong version or custom error""... When I try to Generate w/o it, the code is too short... any news about it? Thanks!"
,danroberto,2011-08-23T13:58Z,"Also got a very strange message during the installation: ""Your system is too new, you need a Mac OS X 10.4.x or 10.5.x system to install. Installation failed on Exit""... However, the Maya folder with the app all the files are there...

Strange. "
,cdavietei,2011-08-24T16:22Z,can someone post the crack and the keygen cuz i downloaded the trial from the actual site but i have no crack or keygen
,rubengarciajr,2011-08-28T10:45Z,"After installing and activating AutoCAD 2012 successfully running Lion, I figured I should try to do the same for Maya, and guess what.. it works

1. You need to have Xcode installed from the Mac App Store, it is free.
2. Download this file and run the crack2012 script (it will walk u through the steps)

http://snipt.org/xmogo/plaintext
3. Use the keygen that is in the crack2012.dmg 
"
,Daves_Shed,2011-08-30T15:57Z,"@rubengarciajr that sounds great. I can't download that file though, it keeps saying there's an error and I have to sign up for a premium account to download more than one file. Confusing as it seems to be only one file - is there a different website you can put it on? Or just add it to your torrents?"
,danroberto,2011-08-31T17:45Z,"@rubengarciajr - Thanks, but the Crack2012.dmg.zip extracts to Crack2012.dmg.zip.cpgz... than back to Crack2012.dmg.zip etc. etc.

What gives?"
,danroberto,2011-08-31T18:06Z,"oops ignore the last comment... still, when i get to the ""Mem Patch"" part (via the script) I get ""Error! Not Admin, wrong version or custom error""..."
,danroberto,2011-08-31T18:34Z,"OK... Something is really wrong with the script... at some point it looks for /users/lol/...... is it a joke? Also, the Product Key is wrong, of course...

Again - with Lion:

1. At the end of the installation I get: ""Your system is too new, you need a Mac OS X 10.4.x or 10.5.x system to install. Installation failed on Exit""... and ""installation failed"".

However, the Autodesk and Maya folders with the app all the files are there...

2. When I get to ""I have an activation code from Autodesk"" and press ""Mem Patch"", I get ""Error! Not Admin, wrong version or custom error""... When I try to Generate w/o it, the code is too short...

The script did not help..."
,rubengarciajr,2011-09-01T07:59Z,"U need to follow the script steps very closely and of course make sure you have Xcode installed on your Mac or else it won't work.  
"
,byanbyan,2011-09-02T11:46Z,How can I get the full activation code? I followed instructions to the book. There are about 7 numbers short. I have Snow Leopard.
,danroberto,2011-09-02T13:02Z,"I followed the script very closely... and I have xcode.

Didn't work for me.

I still don't understand the search for /users/lol/ ..."
,rubengarciajr,2011-09-05T07:20Z,"I never had that problem with the automated script looking for /users/lol/ ...

,78uh,2011-09-20T06:02Z,Can someone upload the crack to a different download site? I'm having trouble with File share.
,jrkruse,2011-10-08T19:44Z,"I have followed the script for installing on Lion but after I find the hex number for __Text I get errors stating that my computer cannot find Users/lol/....
"
,jrkruse,2011-10-08T21:00Z,"I was getting the User/lol error but I found a work around... Go here {http://forum.cgpersia.com/f37/maya-2012-lion-fix-37130/}

Unpack the keygen and follow the steps I  have here. This is the same thing as the uploader posted but is manual and puts a break in the terminal to fix the problem with the mem patch with Lion... THis process can be used for any of the Autodesk product line"
,xniggler,2011-10-14T02:51Z,"are u guys all fucking retarded?

why don't u just do this?(as mentionend on page 1) 

go to the autodesk website , sign up as a student,
download the 2012 software, receive a license code(3 year license) from autodesk, enjoy your fully featured learing edition! takes like 1 minutes and the dowload is super fast..."
