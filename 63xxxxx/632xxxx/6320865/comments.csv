Bad grammar to boot.

Here's some excerpts to save you the trouble of downloading this waste of 300.1 kb.

""The  group  is lead  by jews  Cenk Ugyur and  Ben  Mankiewicz. Jew Cenk is the host  of the show,  and  is often  co-hosted by jewess Ana  Kasparian. Is it any wonder  that  Cenk lists  his  favorite author  on his  profile page  as Salman Rushdie and  his  favorite TV  host  as Ben  Mankiewicz?"" 

""Hook  nosed  Ana  Kasparian gives  more  insight  to the mindset  of these  jews  in her  profile page  where  she  lists  Russ Fiengold as one of her  favorite politicians, as does  Cenk; and  also  lists  Niccolo Machiavelli as her  favorite historical figure.""

""The  young  turds  also  have  a  Youtube account with  22,595 subscribers, 2,300 videos,  and  almost  1.25  MILLION channel views.  Do you think  they  get  this kind  of exposure because people  like  their  message, or  because jews  in high places want  their  message permeated everywhere? Common sense  will  tell  you itâ€™s  the latter.""

As a Catholic, I just got to say that the poster of this sad thing is just plain meshugenah.
