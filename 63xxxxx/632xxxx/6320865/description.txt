The Young Turks. (e-book) (who are they?) 



Ever heard of The Young Turks? When mentioning the young turds, the first
thing to bring up is the Armenian genocide where a group calling themselves
the young turks murdered close to 3.5 MILLION Armenian christians in the
Ottoman empire during and just after WWI. 

The Young Turds were a group of criminals like the Bolsheviks who perpetrated mass genocide against the Armenian christians and guess who they blamed it on? MUSLIMS! Sound familiar?



Look at this definition proudly displayed on their website: Young Turk (n), 1.
Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or
political party. 2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal
expectations. (American Heritage Dictionary)

Insurgent political group alright. They operate in America using their show to
attract, catalogue, and distract thousands of American patriots from the real
truth about who controls our country.
