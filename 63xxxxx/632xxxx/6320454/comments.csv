,Dura07,2011-04-22T07:59Z,Been looking for this for age's now. I promise i'll seed. Is this the full AU ? Is it easy to install in a mac ?
,tizzleh,2011-04-23T00:26Z,@Dura07... Works fine on XP sp3 and Win764 bit. Haven't attempted Mac install but should work.
,JonnyPaine7,2011-05-07T18:27Z,I WILL SEED! but does this work or not?

,tizzleh,2011-06-16T03:27Z,@JonnyPaine7... I have tried it on Win7 64 and 32 bit XP... It works fine on both. 
,tizzleh,2011-06-16T03:30Z,@notnuffsed  Key generators are often detected as viruses. I have not tried to disassemble it to see if there are any presents in the KG. If you are concerned then use Sandbox when using questionable software.
,barosman,2011-08-09T00:03Z,"hej can anyone tell me how this shit works?
i spended hours at this crap and everything i tried was useless.
i can open omnisphere but i can't hear any sound of it.
how do i fix that?"
,tizzleh,2011-08-24T13:33Z,@barosman If you have installed it then you should see an extensive library of sounds.. Make sure you have your routing is correctly set-up in you DAW.

,darrylportelli,2011-09-30T10:39Z,"I have downloaded this amazing software. Thanks for up loading works great. For those having problems, the solutions are:
1) install ALLLLLL 6 DVD'd (and I mean ALL)
2) then download the 1.0.3 update from pirate bay and install it. after you update it use the keygen. the keygen will NOT work on lower versions so please download the small update and then crack.

again thanks "
,CoBu1,2011-10-26T06:31Z,Can anyone tell me if this works on Lion?
,Stereo333,2011-10-27T21:13Z,"HI;

I`ve downloaded all six CD`s but I can`t install it. 
When I`m trying to install the second CD, it is always asking for the steam folder:

""This is not a STEAM folder. Perhaps you selected a shortcut? The STEAM folder must have an Omnisphere / Settings Library subfolder""


But there is no Steam folder! And that`s why I cannot install the further CD`s 2,3,4,5,6

Does anyone know how to handle this problem?

Greetings"
,tizzleh,2011-11-01T23:11Z,"@Stereo333 Did you install the STEAM folder to the default location? If you didn't, then select ""browse"" and select the location at which the STEAM folder is located."
,Sphinx][,2011-11-09T17:32Z,"Hi, Sorry! How do I use Omnisphere? I installed all six discs and now what? I cannot find any way to start this 50gb monster. And where do I use keygen?"
,vishnu219,2012-01-13T16:33Z,"My challenge code is too long for the keygen.   I've heard of this problem with others.  Any solution?

,DanielDeLion,2012-02-22T15:11Z,"Hi. Thanks for this, I can't wait to get it working. I usually never have problems with these torrents but I just can't get the keygen to work for me on this one. Is there any chance someone out there could send me a response code for this: Sp@5UuETw ?JKE=YQb5 PBUkmT4FA

If anyone could help me out that would be great. 

Thanks a lot!"

,DonkiesRunnin,2012-02-29T03:06Z,"I have successfully installed all discs and I believe all the updates.

I can get Omnisphere to open and run in ProTools 8 on XP as an instrument. However, it says the core library is missing the files for all the synths etc..

This doesnt make sense to me yet, because i installed all the discs with no problems... I do have the Instrument library on a seperate internal drive, which I connected to when first opening the synth.

Here is the error i get when choosing a soundsource:

'Cannot load soundsource ""Organics Rhodes Body Noisy"" from directory ""Core Library"" File Organics Rhodes Body Noisy.zmap may be missing or corrupted. Try refreshing the soundsource browser.'

Has anyone come across this error?


I do notice that in my STEAM folder there are two folders. One name 'OMNISPHE' which is 32.9G and the second named 'Omnisphere' which is 178MB.

Is it possible it is referencing the wrong folder? Im not sure is there is supposed to be two folders and why one is shortnamed..."
,DonkiesRunnin,2012-02-29T03:19Z,"Update:

I notice that on discs 2-6, in the STEAM folder, Every folder name and filename is cut short.

For Example: 

Folder name is 'SOUNDSOU' not soundsource.
File Name is ""PSYCHOAC' 
Core Library folder is 'CORELIBR'


this doesnt seem right... and i doubt just renaming all these directories and will help.  But, if i dont hear anything soon, I may just try that."
,DonkiesRunnin,2012-03-01T10:22Z,"update:

I think Ive found the issue, user error..

I extracted the wrong directory from the iso.  Just a heads up for others.  "
