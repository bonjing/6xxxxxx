Notes:

 - I cropped the letterboxing to preserve the original widescreen 2.20:1 aspect ratio while having the video fit the player window, but you'll get the letterboxing back on a 16:9 TV or monitor.
 
 - The audio was originally mono; stereo separation was simulated.
 
 - To use the subtitles, if necessary, simply extract the .SUB file from the .RAR archive into the same folder. A free app. that will extract .RAR archives is 7-Zip from http://www.7-zip.org/
 
 - I seed using "Initial Seeding" which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for up to several days until there are enough other seeds.
 
 - This is a long movie and I made it a higher-than-average quality to preserve the gorgeous cinematography; it will take nearly two days to complete the initial seeding so BE PATIENT. Another underrated gem; I'd give it at least an 8.0, so it's worth the wait.

 - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) At nearly 1.5GB if leechers let the torrent die I won't be able to fix it. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to at least 101%, no torrent would ever die.
