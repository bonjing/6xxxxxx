MKV is not a codec, it's a container. You're missing an audio codec somewhere or your player is using the wrong one. GraphStudio (free, open source) will debug codecs. Just drag and drop in the video file and it will show all the codecs and filters being used: http://blog.monogram.sk/janos/tools/monogram-graphstudio/"

Great Show cant wait for the next episode."
,skreemer,2011-05-01T01:28Z,"For people with problems with sound: try using another player. VLCPlayer, KMPlayer, etc. Sometimes your regular player can´t handle the encoding."

,Philonetic,2011-05-17T23:46Z,"@gopower27
been using platinum + peerblock + peerguardian for years, i'm also behind a VPN and I still got an infringement notice.  Use what you can, but no promises."
,ryanphatryan,2011-05-19T01:27Z,"the sound doesnt work for me with this vid and i can play all other mkvs idk whats wrong can anyone help?"""
,Liquefier,2011-05-22T15:18Z,"@spookmag, this works perfectly on VLC and KMP media players, move into the 21st Century and/or STFU. Worry not people, this is a quality rip, I love how n00bs assume that the torrent is bad because they can't get it to work."
,immugio,2011-06-18T07:16Z,"best bet is just use a computer. i got a cheap desktop and i can download this stuff fine. i use KMPlayer. cheers, thanks eztv"
,immugio,2011-06-18T07:18Z,"if ur getting infringement notices ur either doing something wrong or you have SPYWARE virus. i don't use any of that crap and i've never had a problem. try running malware bytes, free anti-malware shareware."
,Dfewer1,2011-06-29T20:02Z,"Dear Comcast High-Speed Internet Subscriber:

Comcast has received a notification by a copyright owner, or its authorized agent, reporting an alleged infringement of one or more copyrighted works made on or over Comcast's High-Speed Internet service (the 'Service').

I don't think they'll do anything about it, but if you're worried about getting a notice, use peerguardian or some such."
,anonim1979,2011-09-26T20:53Z,"Bad Sound? Episode 1 and 5 not playing?
That is because:
!!!
This FIRST and FIFTH episode from CTU have 
F@CKED SOUND.
!!!
They has stereo dolby digital with 5.1 dolby digital header. (check with MPC and media info and compare to other eps)
Many problems with decoders in TVs players software that presume that coders aren't idiots and/or n00bs.
Use ""Avidemux2"" and copy video, reencode audio to stereo 384kbit AC3(aften), and output set to MKV. Save as ""ep01firststep.mkv"". 3 minutes and done.
Unfortunately avidemux generates unseekable .mkv's
You need to demux it using ""MKVextractGUI-2""
and then mux 2 generated files back using ""MKV Merge"".
Have fun.

---
Someone do this and put FIXED/PROPER ep."
,anonim1979,2011-09-26T23:42Z,"Better and tested method, above can cut audio chanels:
1.
Demux using ""MKVextractGUI-2"".
You will get .h264 and .ac3 file
2.
Using ""MeGui"" open .ac3 file
Set AftenAC3 and click Config to set ""DirectShow"" as ""Preffered Decoder"".
OK,Queue, and in queue tab Start.
You will get  fixed ""...._new.ac3"" file
3.
Mux .h264 and new.ac3 using ""MKV Merge"".
Set fps to 2400/1001 for 23.976fps framerate.
Done."
,schnorrer0,2012-03-29T05:26Z,"for those who cant play this, you're all pirate noobs...always in need of spoon feeding...do some research"
,Maxaker,2012-04-01T05:28Z,"Thanks for episode EZTV.

Adressing the audio problems, what fixed it for me was downloading the AC3Filter and installing it. I use MPC-HC Player with CCCP Codec Pack."

I don't know nothing about them, but you get a better DL speed. Besides, ""i-stole"" sounds tricky."
