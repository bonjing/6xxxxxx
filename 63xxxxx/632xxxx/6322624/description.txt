\'The Ricky Gervais Show\' audiobooks have been developed into an animated TV series, which premiered on 19 February 2010, on the American channel HBO and on the British channel, Channel 4 on Friday 23 April 2010. In Australia, series one first aired in full on Pay Television through Showcase and later moved to Free-To-Air channel, SBS One on 6 November 2010 (but later dropped from the schedule after four episodes).
