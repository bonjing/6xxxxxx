,sadspam,2011-04-18T23:41Z,"It's the real deal. Working on my iXtreme 1.6. Ran it through ABGX and it's not textureload.exe. Whoever said that didn't download it. The Marvel and Strange releases said that when I ran it through ABGX. This is coming from somebody who downloaded all three releases.

Thanks to the uploader for sharing. Will seed."
