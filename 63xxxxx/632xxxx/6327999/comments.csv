,trudrecko,2011-04-19T16:43Z,"well i'm still working on it, and i finally am uploading, but... i can't seem to get it to upload over 100kbps, which is interesting because I am super seeding and I have pretty fast internet. like, i should be uploading like 1Mbps. I'll figure it out eventually guys, just keep patient."
,trudrecko,2011-04-19T17:16Z,"well I seem to be uploading decently, any feedback from the leechers would be nice as to your download speeds.... only thing is is that I have a NAT problem.... I'm trying to fix it,  but I'm kinda dumb."
