First of all, this is the first time I have created a torrent. If I messed something up, let me know, politely (preferably). So I spent some time on here, browsing The Mountain Goats, and I noticed some uploaders claiming to a discography per TMG. They were, in fact, not even close to being discographies, like, not in the least. So, I decided to spend some time and hunt down and organize everything they've released(and a little bit that wasn't), to the best of my knowledge. This is what I came up with. PLEASE let me know if I'm missing something. Oh, and also the sources were all different, and generally anonymous, so thank you to whomever provided me with said files. Being that they came from multiple sources, they are in some different file types, but they are all good quality.
