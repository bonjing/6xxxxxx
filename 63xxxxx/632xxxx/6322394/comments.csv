,sarafova,2011-04-17T11:27Z,next time add more trackers.. because thepiratebay and openbittorrent doesnt work for me.. :))
,StrideyB,2011-04-17T13:44Z,"sarafova - all the trackers I added, failed to work. used the use'll one's but they didn't work?"
,QborT,2011-04-17T16:58Z,"Lulz, you don't need trackers.  Get utorrent and it will connect with peer exchange, DHT, and local peer discovery.

Don't listen to any complaints StrideyB, you provided a solid upload."
