             Darkness Within is a series of adventure games inspired      
             by famous horror writer H.P. Lovecraft. In "The Dark         
             Lineage", the second installment of the Darkness Within      
             series, players again take the role of police detective      
             Howard Loreid, who suffered from the paranormal happenings   
             around him in the first volume "In Pursuit of Loath          
             Nolder". Now, Howard discovers that his own horrible past    
             is connected with the madness that is about to swallow him.  
             This second volume will see the Darkness Within saga come    
             to its unsettling conclusion.                                
                                                                          
             The Dark Lineage will take you to places where the "things"  
             of the past still live, and all the memories that should     
             be long forgotten are still remembered; including a drowsy,  
             depressing town called Arkhamend, a Victorian mansion that   
             conceals some horrible secrets, a dilapidated building       
             inside forbidding, snow-clad woods and dim underground       
             buildings and tunnels. The Dark Lineage is even more         
             frightening and stronger than the previous installment so    
             prepare yourself for the descending darkness, this time      
             will be your last..
