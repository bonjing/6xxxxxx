,daveviborg,2011-04-19T15:22Z,"Ive blocked all the .exe files using the Windows 7 guide below, do I need to block them on AVG as well. At the minute its scanning for deleted asset files? Ive tried the keys with no luck. Should I just uninstall and try again now that I've blocked everything? Need help please."
