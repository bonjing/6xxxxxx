,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-04-17T18:46Z,"What happened to Cuba Gooding Jr, from Jerry Macquire to just a run of stinking diarrhea? Each of his films get progressively worst, where the ratings for his film should be in the negatives. Hollywood must hate him."

AC3 always sucks on my computer, and as usual the part where people whisper or talk low requires max volume, then the gun fights require damn near minimal. The video quality is superb.

The movie itself doesn't suck, but isn't great, kind of meh.

*SPOILER ALERT* it is a slightly whacked out idea: how would a government assassin, terminally ill, choose to commit suicide?  I can think of easier ways. In the end this is a a version of depressed-redneck commits ""suicide by cop"": it's contract assassin commits suicide by good guy."

Now I don't own the sequel nor can i find it in the store . Every torrent that I have managed to find is copy's of the same 2 . one is in Italian and English playing at the same time , the other is missing the 1st 11 minutes. Could some1 find it in there heart to locate this fine sequel and upload it so that ever1 can see it ? and on another note if you haven't seen the lawnmower man, its a must see from 1992 ! plz some1 upload lawnmower man 2: Jobe's War or Lawnmower man 2 : Beyond Cyberspace .!"
