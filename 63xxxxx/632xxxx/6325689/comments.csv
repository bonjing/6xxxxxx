,swampmatt,2012-01-17T14:56Z,"@ Lestatvvvvvv - Go to GOOGLE, and search the phrase ""Undercover Boss episode list"" and you will find probably at least 2 lists - Wikipedia and IMDB where you can match the episode numbers up with show titles/descriptions. It's not rocket science.

Personally, I prefer the short titles with just the episode numbers. It makes it easier to follow and search. (visually)"
