ISLAM is an idea. And as ideas go, it is a very lousy one. 

How do I know this, you ask?
Good question. The answer is by simple logic. Look at the fruits. That's all you need to know. The fruits in this case are all dingleberries. 

To be fair, all religion is revealed to be long on producing dingleberries and short on producing full-fledged human beings. Some saints do succeed in achieving that full humanity status. I will not deny that, but here is the kicker, Islam is not alone in claiming saintly persons among their number. There are saintly Hindus, Christians, Moslems, Buddhist, and Taoist. These last two are non-theistic systems. So this means that all those who became true saintly characters did so in spite of their religion. You don't really need it at all. Savvy?

,jiveclive,2011-04-20T19:54Z,"FYI, zak, I'm neither filthy nor a jew. 

Philosophically, I got the same issues with Judaism as with Islam. Practically, just so you know, I side with the people oppressed by Israel. I believe both groups should have their own nation and try to be rational human beings. 

Unfortunately, the thing most likely to queer that deal is RELIGION. Both sides believe in a Magic-Helper, and both believe that their Magic-Helper is more magical than the other. And they shed each others blood on this basis. Now that is filthy. No doubt. But it cuts both ways. There lies the rub. "
