Review from 'All About Jazz':
New West Records proudly introduces Norah Jones: Live From Austin, TX, the latest DVD release from the acclaimed PBS Austin City Limits television series. Taken from the full ACL concert that was then edited into the half hour TV show, the DVD contains previously unreleased performances. The 18 song disc was filmed in Hi-Definition and has DTS 5.1 Surround Sound. 
Grammy Award winning artist Norah Jones recorded this stunning ACL performance on June 14, 2007, the second time the young artist has graced ACL's stage. Jones' music has touches of smoky jazz, country twang and Memphis soul that permeate her original songs. Her emotional, seductive performance is captured on the intimate DVD whether she is playing guitar on â€œCome Away With Me" or piano on â€œDon't Know Why." In addition to her own songs, Norah also plays a few covers including â€œHands On The Wheel, â€œ made famous by Willie Nelson and Roy Orbison's â€œBlue Bayou." Norah shares the stage with The Handsome Band as well as special guests J. Walter Hawkes and M. Ward.
