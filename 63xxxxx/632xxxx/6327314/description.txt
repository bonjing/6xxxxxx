2 collections of Beatles Revolver Stuff

I liked them, so I thought I would put them together and repost.

I have them both a on a single DVD and put my label in there as well as my Autorun with Icon also.

One item on the Deluxe shows Disc 1 track 14 as a bad file when decoding from flac, but it still plays.

These collections include Flac as well as MP3 with album art.

The Mp3 tracks have album art embedded.

Enjoy
