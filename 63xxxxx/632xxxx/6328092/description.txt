Scre4m (Scream 4) N2KMaster Reworkz V1 2011-

Before you start FREAKING, its a cam, not some dvd rip, bdrip, or even VHS rip. Its a cam rip cleaned up using filters and such.

Rebuilt from the TS Release. Going to do some more work on this tonight and 
hopefully have a V2 out soon as possible. This version was clean enough, im going to see what i can do with the resolution. Sorry i didnt include a sample, screenshots of before and after seen here:

These are before and after shots comparisons.(Before is on the left afters on the right) I used 3 separate filters in Vdub and going to do see if i can get a better looking framerate and see if i can clean it up even further. Hadn't done a reworkz in a while. Figured it was about time since the TS releasers are finally getting some decent rips up. I still wanna check out the sound on V2 as well see if i can't make that sound a little bit better. I say it took a cam rip A/8 V/6 Rating maybe pushed it to a A/8 V/8 Rating at best, its definately easier to see everything and the picture looks a lot cleaner, i hold high hopes for V2.
