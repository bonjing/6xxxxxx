,apbsommer,2011-04-19T09:57Z,"this show is outstanding. best scifi series since the x-files back in the 90's. it's frustrating that the syfy channel has sold out to preposterous reality shows like ""ghost hunters"" and ""wwe smackdown."" what is left for an intelligent viewer? more bbc ""planet earth"" reruns i guess.

@apbsommer
This show indeed is great! And yeah, syfy really needs to sort their stuff out. I don't get  that this show gets pirated more than their other series but because those lame Nielsen viewer ratings they still cancel it. I reckon it's therefore syfy's fault for not distributing the series effective enough, since the average sci-fi watcher has some know how of computers. I'd watch this show on tv if I wouldn't have to wait 2 years for new episodes to come and pay too much for a network which I wouldn't watch that much on a regular basis. World wide internet tv, where are you?!?

,euphoria4949,2011-04-19T13:17Z,"I can't believe its just 3 more episodes of SG-U then that's it....... forever gone :-( 
All of my favorite shows get cancelled in their 1st or 2nd season and replaced by more shitty off the conveyor belt bullcrap that we already have in bucket loads on every channel! (Wow another show about celebrities no one has ever heard of, desperately trying to jump start their long failed careers by doing stupid shit and trying to act!)

Makes me sad that the TV shows that get to air are dictated by how much money is thrown at the TV channel by the shows creator and sponsors, and not base on what we the viewer ACTUALLY WANT TO WATCH!!

Thanks eztv perfect as always :-)"

,drowlfs,2011-04-19T15:50Z,"I agree with euphoria49491! Most of the shows I enjoy most get quickly axed while others which are so-so or boring just seem to go on and on, and on ...

I'll be so sad to see the show go.

I also firmly believe the Neilsen ratings are completely rigged against the younger generation (e.g. people 30 and under, and those who don't own a home and multiple old fashioned TV sets).

,zz69,2011-04-21T11:52Z,"1st Caprica, now SGU. Why bother investing time/interest in a story that is never going to be allowed to be told?

Decent sci fi has always been thought provoking, just like the aforementioned shows, but it seems there is only room for 'pew pew' alien of the week sci fi.

Absolutely GUTTED that another great story bites the dust in favour of cash generating nonesense.

This is, as always, a 1st class upload from eztv. The best! Thanks mate!"
