,Generican,2011-05-06T22:54Z,Normally I don't buy anything that I've already downloaded but I'll gladly pay for this album when I get a chance.  Foo Fighters rule!
,Erich505,2011-05-11T04:38Z,Far and away best quality. Hottest Foo Fighters album to date.
,lestatvvvvvv,2011-05-11T16:23Z,"everyone makes a big stink about down loads saying we are stealing from the band . Did you know that the band gets maybe a dollar per cd sold , the label takes 99% of your 15 to 20 bucks. Also the artist don't see a penny until they pay back all advances and recording costs. "
,Erich505,2011-05-21T06:36Z,"Lestatvvvvv, Your right, newly signed bands usually do only make 1 point per unit sold, but an established band that's been around for a while like Foo Fighters can make up to 4-5 points per album or more. "
,erikjen1,2011-05-25T19:39Z,Thank You! Seeding.......
,elvispco,2011-06-01T17:28Z,"Best album of 2011, ""I'll gladly pay for this album when I get a chance."" +1"
,theAe3boomer,2011-06-10T03:43Z,the only reason this quality is good is because this is the unoriginal re release that was recorded after the original ingenious record to casstte (of wich had its ribbon cut into peices and put into the cd cases of some proud original album owners (and non-pirates))

That's completely true! 
The labels are stealing the artists!
It's not our fault."
