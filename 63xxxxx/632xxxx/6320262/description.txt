Duff McKagan is a founding member of both Guns `n' Roses and Velvet
Revolver. He has sold over 100 million albums in his career.The Taking
is the brand new studio album from Duff McKagan's Loaded. It is the
band's third studio album and the first to feature new drummer Isaac
Carpenter. The album features 11 new songs, which continue the band's
trademark blend of hard rock with a punk edginess that makes them
instantly identifiable. The songs were written over a period of time in
late 2009 / early 2010 and the band went into the studio in August 2010
with renowned rock producer Terry Date (Slipknot, Pantera etc). The
result is Loaded's most accomplished and most hard hitting album to
date.
