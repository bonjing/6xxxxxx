,Philonetic,2011-04-18T17:24Z,"Only took what, a week until after the release to get this out?
WTF is going on with the scene, I could have cammed and uploaded this myself 5 days ago in better quality."
,namorax2,2011-04-18T17:29Z,A/V?
,Krushvarrok,2011-04-18T17:50Z,@Philonetic: And other titles such as Your Highness still haven't been released.
,Chadly,2011-04-18T19:17Z,"They release all the crappy cartoons and horror movies before all the rest. Always been like this. If Rio and Scream 4 werent released yet we would have Arthur and your Highness out allready. Damn the cartoons and the horror movies. cant see anything in cam version of horror movies ever anyways, always too dark... Cartoons are alright I guess, sometimes. Seems to be easier for these guys to make it watchable. whihc is why I guess theyre out first, always...."
,fullthrottle1,2011-04-18T19:51Z,Strange The Lincoln Lawyer has been since 03/18 and have yet to see a legit DL of it ??
,mesays,2011-04-18T22:00Z,"@Philonetic...if you can do it better, than why don't you?"
