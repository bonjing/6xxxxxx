You are correct.  Whoever mixed the audio somehow managed to get the center and right channels (it's a 5.1 mix) swapped.

It's an easy fix though if you have MKVExtract, Audacity (with FFMpeg for Audacity) and MKVMerge.

Simply demux the video and audio tracks.

Open the audio track in Audacity, select all and export selection as an AC3 file (640kbps recommended in settings).  Then when FFMpeg pops up, simply swap track 2 and 3 (track 2 -> Channel 3 / track 3 -> Channel 2) and click OK to start encoding.

Once you've got your fixed AC3 file encoded, use MKVMerge to mux it with the video track you demuxed earlier and you're done."
