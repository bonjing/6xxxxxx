    Stefan finds that he can no longer tolerate the arrangement of his       
    cheating wife ... he, the husband, gets her during the week and her      
    lover gets her on the weekends. At the same time the wife finds          
    herself increasingly drawn to the violence of her lover versus the       
    adoration of her husband.
