There's never a dull moment in this lively drama following the lives of three men living it large in Manchester's gay village.

Stuart Jones (AIDAN GILLEN) has got it all.  He's rich, drop-dead gorgeous and always the centre of attention.  He can be forgiven the arrogance because he's pretty close to perfection.  His best mate Vince Tyler (CRAIG KELLY) is funny, adorable and definitely a babe but, unlike his feiend, has zero confidence in himself.  Since time began, Vince has carried a torch for Stuart but his love remains firmly unrequited.  They're both 29, hitting Canal Street every night, stalwarts of the scene but just starting to wonder where else their lives may be going.

Then along comes Nathan Maloney (CHARLIE HUNNAM).  Young, wild and coming out with a vengeance, he crowbars his way into their world and once he arrives, nothing is ever the same again.
