     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      Sketch show set in a fictional Scottish location that's
      strangely familiar. In this episode, entrepreneur Alex Ciderson
      demonstrates his new invention, squabbling siblings Paul and
      Walter celebrate their dead mother's birthday with their usual
      rivalry, and cheeky 12-year-old boys Marky and Rosso set out to
      embarrass a family friend. Plus, quality policemen McGregor and
      Toshan tackle the problem of teenage delinquency in their own
      inimitable way, the horrific consequences of consuming a ready
      meal 400 years past its use-by date, the home time travel kits
      that are a hit for fun-loving couples, and a young millionaire's
      encounter with his former teacher proves to be revelatory.
