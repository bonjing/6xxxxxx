,blazingotaku,2011-06-13T16:13Z,"if you haven't seen the anime,i really recommend it to you,if your above 17 that is :)
its just genius and incredibly stimulating"
,Teddikilla,2011-06-15T09:02Z,"@Blazingotaku: I only have it in English Dub bro :\
So I'll upload that now. Thanks for commenting :]"
,blazingotaku,2011-06-25T12:35Z,"hey teddikilla,can you please also upload the hunterxhunter ovas aswell,i know their not dubbed,if you have the subtitled one then please upload that,pleeeeease"
,Teddikilla,2011-06-26T18:31Z,"Hey man, there is already a torrent with the ova in it here :]
Just download it and then choose only to download the ova episodes (63 - 92) :] (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4618811/Hunter_x_Hunter_TV___all_OVAs) I'm sorry but it'll only take you 1 minute to choose to only download those, I just wasted bandwidth if I upload just the ova :\
Sorry, I shoulda put em together,. I really wish they did dub the ova though, loved this series. Thanks for downloading broseph"
,blazingotaku,2011-06-28T00:16Z,"thanks man,your right,i really wish they wouldv'e atleast dubbed the first ova....i wouldn't have minded if greed island didn't get the dubs because the animation they used in greed island arc is not that good....and its particularly the animation which makes the 1st season and the 1st ova that makes the anime more interesting and beautiful"
,blazingotaku,2011-06-28T00:26Z,"thank you again for the series,you are a great person,im gonna download the ovas  from the link you gave me :)"
,Teddikilla,2011-07-10T03:39Z,"I liked all of the ova's because they like, sealed the deal. Finished the story. The manga is still being written ._o
I think they should remake hunter x hunter with better animation and follow the manga better. With full English dub :]
Love the english dub for this anime "
,blazingotaku,2011-08-19T23:30Z,"dude new hunterxhunter anime series is being made and gonna start from oct 2,2011......and the manga is also back from hiatus :)"
,Teddikilla,2011-08-28T11:13Z,"Yeah, I recently heard. It's going to be fucking Amazing :]
I love this anime, in my top 5. So Good "
