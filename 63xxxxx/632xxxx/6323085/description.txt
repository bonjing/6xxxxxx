Along with uploading this, I am hoping that it will be possible to get at least a full second copy uploaded fairly quickly so that a newtorrent can be uploaded tomorrow.

Notes about the video -

This is a contrast version to the SD sourced DVB-S torrent on Dime.

Instead it is HD DVB-C sourced (ie with a higher original bitrate#) and also contains the two adverts which appeared in between the segments.

Chapter points are only at the ad-breaks since there was audio cross-fading between some interview segments and songs.


# Due to an issue during the final song (Rio), the audio on this song only has been replaced with a SD DVB-C source, though this should leave it as least as good as the SD DVB-S version.
