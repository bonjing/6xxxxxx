When David learns that Emily is being forced to move away, he agrees to help her hide out in a remote cave on the beach. But their innocent secret soon becomes complicated, as David watches the police close in on his missing friend. When the real reason Emily wants to escape comes to light, David's world is shattered. Swept up in a situation out of his control, and with his feelings for his best friend growing stranger by the day, David is forced to take action. (IMDB)
