Some cuts from E-State. Just a few quality tunes from E-States vinyl collection up untill 2004 ish. Featuring the usual Andy C, Roni Size, John B, Mampi Swift, Dom and Roland Etc. Lots of tunes never released on cd. Some proper drum and bass tunes that should of made the compilation cd's but didn't. I love this cd too. A great driving cd amoung other things.
