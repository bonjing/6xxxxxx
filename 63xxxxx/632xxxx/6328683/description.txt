The film was directed by Paul Greengrass, written by Tony Gilroy and Brian Helgeland, and produced by Frank Marshall and Pat Crowley. Universal Pictures released the film to theaters in the United States on 23 July 2004. It is the second in the Bourne film series.

The Bourne Supremacy continues the story of Jason Bourne, a former CIA assassin suffering from psychogenic amnesia.[2] Bourne is portrayed by Matt Damon. The film focuses on his attempt to learn more of his past as he is once more enveloped in a conspiracy surrounding the CIA and Operation Treadstone. The film also stars Franka Potente as Marie Kreutz, Brian Cox as Ward Abbott, Joan Allen as Pamela Landy and Julia Stiles as Nicky Parsons.


PLOT

Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and his girlfriend Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) have been living incognito in Goa, India for the past two years where Bourne struggles to recall the specifics of his first mission as a black ops agent. In Berlin, CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) runs a "buy operation", spending $3 million to purchase evidence exposing the mole within the agency that stole $20 million in allocation money seven years prior. Before Landy's operative can complete the transaction, Russian FSB agent, Kirill (Karl Urban), infiltrates the building, plants a fingerprint to frame Bourne, kills Landy's operative and the seller of the information and makes off with the evidence and the $3 million. Kirill then reports back to Russian oil magnate Yuri Gretkov (Karel Roden), who sends him to Goa to finish the frame-job by assassinating Bourne. Bourne spots Kirill coming and flees with Marie in a jeep. Kirill gives chase and shoots at the vehicle to kill Bourne but kills Marie instead, causing the jeep to run off a bridge and crash into the river below. Kirill leaves, believing Bourne to be dead, but Bourne survives the accident and departs for Naples, Italy to seek vengeance.

Landy follows the planted fingerprint lead and gains security clearance to sift through the CIA archives to investigate "Operation Treadstone," an elite squad of assassins into which Bourne was enlisted. She stumbles upon evidence implicating Alexander Conklin, the late former director of the operation, leading her to question Conklin's boss, Deputy Director Ward Abbott (Brian Cox), who admits only to vague details. Landy gives a report to her supervisor, Operations Director Martin Marshall (Tomas Arana), advising that some years back, Russian politician Vladimir Neski acquired proof of the identity of the thief who stole the $20 million. When Neski threatened to make the information public he was killed by his wife in an apparent murder-suicide in a Berlin hotel room. Landy suspects Bourne and Conklin were responsible and the meeting is interrupted when a report comes in advising that Bourne has just been detained in Naples. Marshall orders both Abbott and Landy to apprehend him.
