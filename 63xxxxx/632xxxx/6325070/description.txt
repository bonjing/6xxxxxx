 Documentary following life at the Damson Dene, a three-star hotel in the Lake District
 as staff try to keep holiday-makers happy during a busy summer season. A man from Essex
 nervously prepares to propose to his girlfriend, and a fellow guest awaits the results
 of a test for cancer. Meanwhile, manager Wayne Bartholomew is at a loss as he tries to
 deal with new assistant Amos, whose enthusiasm greatly outweighs his abilities.
