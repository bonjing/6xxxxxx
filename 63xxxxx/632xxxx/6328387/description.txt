Notes:

 - An early example of full Technicolor. This is also the Criterion restored 2002 reissue of the original non-linear release cut.
 
 - The protagonist is only referred to as "Colonel Blimp" in the title and not in the film itself (Colonel Blimp was a popular satirical cartoon at the time and the file was named after it; this isn't mentioned prominently in the IMDB record)
 
 - Already posted here ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3673600/Life_and_death_of_Colonel_Blimp_PAL_Eng-Spa_DVD9 ) and here ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3281485/%5BCiN%5DThe.Life.and.Death.of.Colonel.Blimp.1943 ) but both of these torrents have been dead for months if not years

 - To use the subtitles, if necessary, simply extract the .SUB file from the .RAR archive into the same folder. A free app. that will extract .RAR archives is 7-Zip from http://www.7-zip.org/
 
 - I seed using "Initial Seeding" which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for up to several days until there are enough other seeds.
 
 - This is a long movie and I made it a higher-than-average quality; it will take nearly two days to complete the initial seeding so please BE PATIENT.

 - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) At >1.1GB if leechers let the torrent die I won't be able to fix it. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to at least 101%, no torrent would ever die.
