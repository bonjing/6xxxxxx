,asc11,2011-05-06T13:58Z,"In the far future, man has destroyed the Earth in the ""Seven Days of Fire"". Now, there are small pockets of humanity that survive. One pocket is the Valley of Wind where a princess named NausicaÃ¤ tries to understand, rather than destroy the Toxic Jungle. Note that the old US release titled Warriors of the Wind is an entirely kiddiefied version which edits the original movie heavily, thus creating an entirely different story. -Andre Written by Alan Takahashi

===================
I en avlÃ¤gsen framtid har mÃ¤nniskan fÃ¶rstÃ¶rt jorden i ""Seven Days of Fire"". Nu finns det smÃ¥ fickor av mÃ¤nskligheten som Ã¶verlever. En ficka Ã¤r Valley of Wind dÃ¤r en prinsessa som heter Nausikaa fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker fÃ¶rstÃ¥, snarare Ã¤n fÃ¶rstÃ¶ra Toxic Jungle. Observera att de gamla amerikanska utgÃ¥van med titeln Warriors of the Wind Ã¤r en helt kiddiefied version som redigerar den ursprungliga filmen kraftigt, vilket skapar en helt annan historia. -Andre skriven av Alan Takahashi

I saw the dubbed version years ago and, even in that form, was taken by the imaginative visuals, interesting storyline, and worthwhile characters. I was also impressed by the fact the lead character was a strong young woman, who was a ""warrior"" yet whose greatest strength lay in her compassion (rather than striving to become a female Rambo.)

I tracked down a copy of the VHS and sent it to my young nieces, pleased with a ""kid's"" movie which provided a positive role model without being dumb. The movie captivated them as well -- they wore the tape out, and it started them on a lifelong interest in anime. It was they who sent me the uncut subtitled version years later, completing the circle.

Nausicaa is decent science fiction, often breath-taking animation, and unusually *human* characters, and every time I see it I am glad I returned. Everyone should give it a chance, especially those who have written off anime as ""round eyed kids and lots of explosions"".
