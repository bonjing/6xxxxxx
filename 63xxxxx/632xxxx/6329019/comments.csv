,zombear,2011-06-03T04:13Z,"Just to let everyone know, after listening to these songs (except all the tracks from Wasting Light, since I already have that album - all 11 tracks from Wasting Light are in this torrent lol), it sounds like the volume has been artificially boosted. It's not TOO bad but there's definitely noticeable distortion. 

I downloaded the proper Greatest Hits album and there's no distortion.

Thanks for the up anyway."
