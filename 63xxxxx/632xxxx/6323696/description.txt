NOTE: Although "Jericho" has been dropped from the title and filename, this is the same file that is in the TPB torrent that somehow got misnamed: "The Listener S02E0richo WS.XviD-err0001". While I know it is not ideal, I am creating this second torrent so that users can hopefully find S02E09 more easily.
