You Will:

    * Train by using the same scales, arpeggios, patterns, phrasing and guitar licks that made me become the well known artist I am now, all of them and more are included in this special course.
    * Enjoy my exclusive â€˜Etudesâ€™, guitar compositions I created especially for this course. These compositions are based on the solos and classical interludes of â€˜RHAPSODY OF FIREâ€™ and â€˜LUCA TURILLIâ€™ records which have sold more than one million copies around the world.
    * Communicate your progress with me. After each lesson you will have the opportunity to send me your feedback about your challenges and progress. To further improve your playing, I will send you unique exercises, created especially for your specific needs and ultimate artistic goals.
    * Customize the course according to your needs by choosing the frequency of your lessons.
    * Use the features included in â€˜GUITAR PROâ€™, the software needed to access my course. You will train in the fastest, best and easiest way. You will hear each exercise, etude, solo and classical composition played by electric guitar sounds at any speed you wish. There are many other very useful, cool and easy features included!
    * Learn to play the classical masterworks of immortal geniuses like Chopin, Paganini, Bach, Beethoven, Debussy, Liszt and many others. I transcribed, turned into tablature, fingered and adapted every single note of these exceptional pieces to electric guitar exclusively for you!
