In the far-distant future, a long and brutal war of independence between Ptolem and its colonial planet, Osiron, has ended. Their civilizations are building a new future and are a still-fragile alliance. Two former enemy warriors, the Ptolemii High Commander Pyke and the Osiron Prince Vin-Chay, whose unexpected passion and sacrifice were the cornerstones to the final peace, live in serenity with their families. Integral to both civilizations, the men have spent years helping to socially and politically redefine their worlds. They are unaware that hidden enemies-fueled by personal hatred and secret agendas with a longtime thirst for power and revenge-have targeted them for destruction. Their enemies conceived a devious, deadly plan that has both personal and societal ramifications that will destroy the fragile alliance and any hope for the future. The evil that stalks these men and their loved ones has no concept of the true strength and determination of these warriors who will let nothing stand in the way of reclaiming their families and ending the pernicious threat. The final showdown between good and evil explodes in a fiery confrontation that will seal their fates for millennia to come.
