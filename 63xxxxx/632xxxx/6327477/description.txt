In 2007 they released a three song self titled demo called â€œDemo 2007â€ which got many excellent reviews in magazines and webzines all around the world putting the bandâ€™s trademark in the underground metal community. They have played many shows along with well known bands of the international metal scene all over Greece which made their reputation grow even more.
In 2010 the band finished the recording of their first full length album called â€œRed Flowsâ€ that consists of 11 songs which combines the speed of thrash, the power of groove and the atmosphere of progressive metal.
Raw In Sect are aiming to deliver â€œRed Flowsâ€ to the metal masses so they can make a step furtherâ€¦
