,Miseria,2011-06-11T10:32Z,i've been holding at 1.3% left on this torrent for 2 weeks now. it would be nice to get a seeder on to finish this off for all who are waiting.
,LJUSALF,2011-10-05T18:56Z,"Still on 98,7%
Please seed for just a few minutes more.."
,smallfoot,2011-10-23T18:43Z,Still stuck at 98.7. The seeder has left the torrent even though he was trusted. I was waiting for the last one year. But some of the brushes may work even if 100% is yet to come.
