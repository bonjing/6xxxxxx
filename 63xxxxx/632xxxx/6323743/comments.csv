,cartman19987,2011-04-17T16:23Z,Fantastic torrent. I'll probably only download a few that I need. Thank you so much!
,cartman19987,2011-04-17T16:25Z,"Well this definitely isn't complete, as there are only about 20 issues out of 50 of Knights of the Old Republic. That's no problem though, since those can be downloaded elsewhere on The Pirate Bay."
,wezywezo,2011-04-18T04:51Z,cmon seed plz
,Astralia,2011-04-18T08:37Z,My collection is about 19Gb (incl most (if not all) the literature and RPG). So i dont see how this one could be complete.
,starwolf1001,2011-04-19T08:47Z,"great collection, but please seed :-)"
,Cpain,2011-08-09T18:42Z,"@ Astralia
It's titled complete comic collection, not complete star wars literature collection. It makes since it would only have the comics."
,uzerzero,2011-08-24T09:27Z,"Great collection if you're new to SW Comics or had your head buried in the novels. Unfortunately, it's missing issue 20 (part 4) of X-Wing Rogue Squadron: Requiem for a Rogue. "

,Trond007,2012-04-03T21:05Z,What's the difference between this complete collection and a bigger collection here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6278792/Star_Wars_Comics_ColleCTiON ?
,BeowulfHrothgar,2012-04-28T09:54Z,"What type of files are these? Are they CBRs or PDFs, or something else? Does anyone know?"
,BeowulfHrothgar,2012-04-28T09:57Z,"Nevermind. I figured it out, but does anyone know where I can find a  good CBR reader? "
