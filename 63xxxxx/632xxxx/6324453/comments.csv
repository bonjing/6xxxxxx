I do however, have a copy from an avi, all english no subs, I've converted this to dvd and will put it up for sharing in a couple of hours.  This version I guarantee will be 100% ok, but it won't have any menu.

Once again, my apologies for this poor version, please look for TORNADO TERROR.  This is the title I'll be calling it.

Thanks
Mike"
