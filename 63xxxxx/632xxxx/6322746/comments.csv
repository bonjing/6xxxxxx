Your previous upload of this has been deleted."
,awingnut444,2011-04-17T05:14Z,"I was not TRYING to upload it more than once. I was trying to get it to upload and be seeded AT ALL.  I thought the first time I did something wrong since despite my being online and seeding, TPB noted 'no seeders'.  Hence I redid it and tried changing the trackers.  Glad it worked.  Again to all, please someone keep this on their machine and seed this as long as possible.  These need to be on the web somewhere!!!"

I went and found the files via awingnut444's other torrent ""elsewhere"" and am now seeding them here to help my fellow TPBers.  This is useful stuff and I thank awingnut444 for making them available to the rest of us snorers."
,awingnut444,2011-04-17T15:39Z,"THANK you to all seeders keeping this up.  I DON'T CARE if you want to copy this torrent, slap your name on it, and post it on some Ukranian server . . . as long as it is kept alive somewhere on the 'net.  It is WRONG that the FDA and doctors and manufacturers keep this information from the people who buy their CPAP machines and OWN THEM. They should be able to adjust and look at the data in them.  THANK YOU to all seeding this, since I can't keep doing it."
