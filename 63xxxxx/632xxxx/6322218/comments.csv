,believenu,2011-04-16T18:47Z,"Ok I am going to repeat this comment for a while(If thats ok 20-40) as some peeples are stund and don't get how easy it is to do..
By the way leeches are blood sucking slimey creatures which you burn off you so BEWARE!

for most of people who are in my situ (I have a dsl line) or those on a regular cable which is open as long as computer is on even if I am not online I am seeding torrent I have d/l even I my sleep I am sharing with others . It realy is, for anyone who does not have a limited internet service(I would say a lot or most in The largest country in North America) easy to share .just leave utorrent running(or whatever one you use) .. check to see if it needs a forced start and go to bed. even if you have laptop.. just plug it in turn it on and go to bed it is simple and easy I leave it there until whenever and I only have a computer with 75Gb so if I can do it...If you have a limit do at least 1:1 .take 500mb give 500mb simple.
At the end of the week when this genus(20-40) does his weekly pack you can add it to his but d/l torrent select none or one you missed or would like to try and the rest would seed automatically..I know this has been explained too many times to mention but come on everyone give me a break .I am a true beginner at this but even I can do it.. 
remember SEEDING IS SHARING. 

kept wanting to see but never till now. thank you."

Glitches are at:

,pb67508,2011-08-15T14:42Z,"+1 Indeed !!

gr8 rip.. enjoyed the film... 

Mr. forgshare .. I tried with another srt file downloaded seperatly and it was fine for me ... i used VLC (latest version) but all in all this is a gr8 rip, wouldn't you agree ? :)

Download - Enjoy - Share !!!"
,zzw1983,2011-10-09T01:48Z,thanks but 480 is not HD.
,male007,2012-04-28T09:27Z,"plz seed!!!!!

the speed is not going beyond 20 kBps!! that's weird"
,Colossuz,2012-06-22T08:03Z,"Frogshare: you're damn right. Don't download this torrent if you plan to add subs. Otherwise, great quality in a small package."
