   Fyra Ã¥r till (2010)

  Political party leader David Holst, one of Sweden's most popular 
  politicians, is handsome, funny, popular and predicted as the 
  country's next prime minister. But what at first appears to be 
  an easy victory turns into a grueling defeat as another party 
  wins the elections and four years of leading the country. When 
  David suddenly falls in love, the problem is not that he's already 
  married or that he's fallen in love with another man. The problem 
  is that the man he's fallen head over heels in love with is the only 
  man on earth he can't love - the Secretary of State for the rivaling 
  party that won the elections! Mistakes and misunderstandings piles up.
