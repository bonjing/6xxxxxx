This is in no aspect the ultimate computer repair guide.

Not recommended."

,Krete478,2011-08-03T05:19Z,meh... only for the people that know nothing of computers
,new-K,2011-08-13T05:54Z,I dont think that something with weight of 5MB will be enough that you repair your computer no matter what happen to it :) I can believe if it is about how to open and close then meybe but i bypass this torrent :P
,jon108,2011-10-25T14:16Z,Almost 6 MB is plenty big enough for a decent size ebook.  It took exactly 26 seconds for me to download this.  It is perfect for me as I am nervous about opening up my computer and fixing even the most basic things.
