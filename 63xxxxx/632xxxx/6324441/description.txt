In the quiet, beautiful community of Saucier, Mississippi lives Mrs. Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall), an elderly, God-fearing widow who answers the door one sunny morning to find the charming Professor Goldthwaite Higginson Dorr (Tom Hanks), a pretentious Southern dandy, darkening her doorstep. He explains who he is and expresses his interest in the room to let, which is Mrs. Munson's spare bedroom. He also explains that he is a musician and asks if it would be all right for him to use her basement as a place for recitals with his fellow "musicians". She accepts the terms and agrees. Mr. Dorr's fellow "musicians" are actually a gang of criminals, named Lump (Ryan Hurst), The General (Tzi Ma), Garth Pancake (J. K. Simmons), and Gawain (Marlon Wayans).
With all of their talents combined, the group of criminals plan to dig through the crumbling, dried earth that has piled up to form a tunnel in Mrs. Munson's basement and conclude that they will emerge in the vault of the casino. To avoid Mrs. Munson's hearing the digging, they play orchestral CDs (most notably a CD of Boccherini's Minuet (3rd movement) from String Quintet in E, Op. 11 No. 5 as to seem that they are rehearsing, so she will not get suspicious. They dispose of all the unused dirt in Hefty trash bags...
After a series of comical mishaps that threaten to derail their plan...
