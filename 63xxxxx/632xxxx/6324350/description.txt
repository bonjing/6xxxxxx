:::-> About the Song <-:::

The song was written in 1987 by group member Rory Kehoe and arranged by John O'Connor and Graham Lister. O'Connor shopped it around to different labels, but none of them were interested. Frustrated, O'Connor pressed 500 copies of the single himself and released them to UK radio stations, with the studio's phone number on them, just in case major record labels contacted the stations for information about the song.

However one Liverpool station began giving the phone number out on air and O'Connor began to receive hundreds of phone calls from the area, asking for copies of the song. By this time interest was developing rapidly, and when a major label offered to take the single, O'Connor turned them down, having already secured pressing and distribution.

Simon Bates, then a BBC Radio 1 DJ, promoted the song, and it became an instant hit, spending two weeks at number one on the UK Singles Chart[2] and becoming the ninth best-selling single of 1987 in the UK.

The song became well known in the U.S. due to the frequency with which it has been played on the Dr. Demento Show radio program. It appears on the Rhino Records compilation album The Dr. Demento 20th Anniversary Collection.

Star Trekkin', across the universe
On the Starship Enterprise, under Captain Kirk
Star Trekkin', across the universe
Boldly going forward, 'cause we can't find reverse

Lt. Uhura, report

There's Klingons on the starboard bow
Starboard bow, starboard bow
There's Klingons on the starboard bow
Starboard bow, Jim

Analysis, Mr. Spock

It's life, Jim, but not as we know it
Not as we know it, not as we know it
It's life, Jim, but not as we know it
Not as we know it, Captain

There's Klingons on the starboard bow
Starboard bow, starboard bow
There's Klingons on the starboard bow
Starboard bow, Jim

Star Trekkin', across the universe
On the Starship Enterprise, under Captain Kirk
Star Trekkin', across the universe
Boldly going forward, still can't find reverse

Medical update, Doctor McCoy!

It's worse than that, he's dead, Jim
Dead, Jim. Dead, Jim
It's worse than that, he's dead, Jim
Dead, Jim, Dead

It's life, Jim, but not as we know it
Not as we know it, not as we know it
It's life, Jim, but not as we know it
Not as we know it, Captain

There's Klingons on the starboard bow
Starboard bow, starboard bow
There's Klingons on the starboard bow
Starboard bow, Jim

Starship Captain, James T. Kirk

Ha-ha! We come in peace, shoot to kill
Shoot to kill, shoot to kill
We come in peace, shoot to kill
shoot to kill, men

It's worse than that, he's dead, Jim
Dead, Jim. Dead, Jim
It's worse than that, he's dead, Jim
Dead, Jim, Dead

Well it's life, Jim, but not as we know it
Not as we know it, not as we know it
It's life, Jim, but not as we know it
Not as we know it, Captain

There's Klingons on the starboard bow
Starboard bow, starboard bow
There's Klingons on the starboard bow
Scrape 'em off Jim

Star Trekkin', across the universe
On the Starship Enterprise, under Captain Kirk
Star Trekkin', across the universe
Boldly going forward, and things are getting worse

Engine room, Mister Scott

Ye canna change the laws of physics
Laws of physics, laws of physics
Ye canna change the laws of physics
Laws of physics, Jim

We come in peace, shoot to kill
Shoot to kill, shoot to kill
We come in peace, shoot to kill
Scotty beam me up

It's worse than that, he's dead, Jim
Dead, Jim. Dead, Jim
It's worse than that, he's dead, Jim
Dead, Jim, Dead

Well it's life, Jim, but not as we know it
Not as we know it, not as we know it
It's life, Jim, but not as we know it
Not as we know it, Captain

There's Klingons on the starboard bow
Starboard bow, starboard bow
There's Klingons on the starboard bow
Starboard bow Jim

Ye canny change the scourge jim oh see you jimmy
Bridge to engine room, warp factor nine
If I give her anymore she'll blow

Star Trekkin', across the universe
On the Starship Enterprise, under Captain Kirk
Star Trekkin', across the universe
Boldly going forward, 'cause we can't find reverse
Star Trekkin', across the universe
