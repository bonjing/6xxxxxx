1PassWord V1.0.5.177 (For Windows)

1Password is a password manager that goes beyond simple password storage by integrating directly with your web browser to automatically log you into websites, enter credit card information, fill registration forms, and easily generate strong passwords.
All your confidential information, including passwords, identities, and credit cards, is kept in one secure place, protected by the only password you will need to remember.


Program is tested with WinXP SP3 on IE, Chrome and FireFox


Just have FUN.
