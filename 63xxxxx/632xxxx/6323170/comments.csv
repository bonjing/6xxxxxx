Lol, are you serious? Actors dont get there jobs for how they look. Look at Steve Buscemi, he is easily one of the ugliest men to walk this world and he is an magnificent actor. Yes, most actors/actresses are ""attractive"" but that's not why they got there jobs."

You know it is amazing when you think a person is ugly but when you meet them in person they turn out to be alright.. Ugly can be defined in so many ways. Some people think Angelina is ugly"
