I am positively sure that I followed all of the instructions perfectly, but Scrivener still told me that my name and serial number were invalid. Please help"
,LiaFlia,2011-04-16T07:06Z,never mind. I didn't follow those instructions as perfectly as I thought. It's working now though.  Thanks polisdavid.
[V],polisdavid,2011-04-16T07:18Z,"Thanks SteRipper,

I never thought I would be able to achieve this."
[V],mrspatula,2011-04-16T15:36Z,Congratulations man. You deserve it :)
,rjc1138,2011-04-18T01:20Z,I'm still using 10.4.11. I think the newest version of APE I can use is 2.5.2. The instructions call for 2.6.1. Am I out of luck? Thanks and congrats.
[V],polisdavid,2011-04-22T18:38Z,"rjc1138, 
Yeah unless you can get the latest esellerate it don't think you'll get an accurate key that will  work"
,rjc1138,2011-04-22T19:16Z,Thanks for responding. I had a feeling that was the case. 
,eberstein,2011-05-17T11:54Z,"followed the instructions, but still it says ""invalid serial number or name"". any ideas?"

Try getting latest version of KCNscrew pack and installing it that way.

polisdavid,
This is working for version 2.1 as well."
,sntach,2011-08-26T18:03Z,"eSell Hijack not working with Lion :/

""Application Enhancer has not been tested on Mac OS X 10.7 and therefore eSell Hijack will not be loaded.""

can anyone post a serial for 2.1?"
