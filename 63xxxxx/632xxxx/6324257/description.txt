Directed by Rod Lurie. 

Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Josh Hartnett, Kathryn Morris. 

Up-and-coming sports reporter rescues a homeless man ("Champ") only to discover that he is, in fact, a boxing legend believed to have passed away. What begins as an opportunity to resurrect Champ's story and escape the shadow of his father's success becomes a personal journey as the ambitious reporter reexamines his own life and his relationship with his family. 

NOTE: Great cast, actors have done everything to "resurrect" sloppy story, rubbish written as script and probably on some way, "impaired" Director. Sorry, but they failed, movie is bad even if story-line seemed as promising.

Last 30 days I have steady 99% of Hit&Runs.
I haven't asked for "great" sacrifice or martyrdom:
"Share with other people, best way you can. (notice BEST WAY... not NONE)
Give back - at least a little.
Exchange bytes DURING the download. Share. 
Do not Hit & Run."

Number of Hit&Runs - increased.

It cannot be forever.

ANTI HIT&&RUN MEASURES ARE ACTIVE NOW!!!

SORRY FOR "COLLATERAL" DAMAGE.

AND - NO REQUESTS WOULD BE TAKEN TILL FURTHER NOTICE.

Seed after your download is over, you'll seed only the files 
you choose to download. Please. 
Share with other people, best way you can.
But seed. Share. Do not Hit & Run.

Worth repeating:
"Exchange of recieved bytes during the download is important now - DO NOT set your download speed at max. and upload speed at minimum. If peers doesn't share bytes already in swarm - they would probably finish with download - never!

 Seeding afterward is of secondary importance - if people are good and want to share with other people pleasure and enthusiasm they feel about some show or movie - they would stay and give. Best way they can, right?"
