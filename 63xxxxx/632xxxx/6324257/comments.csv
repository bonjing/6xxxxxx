[V],twentyforty,2011-04-17T17:32Z,"@DownTYU : Loaded few minutes ago, but seeding would be slow, from home. Strange, because just yesterday I deleted Bigger than life from seeding server and left torrent active for two hours (it's standard procedure), but - no one was there."
,sharan007,2011-04-17T17:33Z,"i finished downloadin falling down at long last.
Thanks to twentyforty,down tyu,abj642 and other 3 seeders who i dont know.Really appreciate what you guys did"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-17T17:33Z,"@sharan007: You are right, but even if literary thousands do not - maybe two dozens do read, but cannot left comment because they are not members and few have handle here, but from various reasons (paranoia mostly) sneak peek behind free proxy servers and cannot left Comment. Strangely, they can Rate (vote) and that's standard MO of ""minus"" idiots."

we are just sharing what we have got freely from the great 20-40...
all credits to him...
my only wish is to keep 20-40 torrents alive as long as possible.. because they deserve more.."
,sharan007,2011-04-17T18:01Z,yea thats pretty bad..but looks like it has reduced over the past few days(the minus rating)
,sharan007,2011-04-17T18:01Z,totally agree with abj642..
[V],DownTYU,2011-04-17T18:17Z,"@abj642 Damn yeah they deserve more. Do you know how long it takes to encode a video with that much compression.

When I went to compress my 7 DVD Berlin Alexanderplatz in x264 it took two hours to compress a half an hour video.It took weeks."
,gopesk,2011-04-17T19:19Z,"if anybody want any particular movie of 20-40 for seeding...ask here in the comment section...i have almost 70%movies of 20-40 uploads i will seed it for you that particular movie for few days...
and my upload speed is around 40-50kbps so i cant upload all the movies so if anybodywant movies that have very few seeds i will upload that particular one.."
,micmac33,2011-04-18T09:16Z,"Thanks a lot, excellent quality 10/10."

,sallie6,2011-05-16T11:27Z,how long do you need to seed for with each download?  sorry to ask but I am very new at all of this & would dearly love to share back any way possible...
