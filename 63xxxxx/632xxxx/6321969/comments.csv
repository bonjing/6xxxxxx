Thanks very much to the uploader- was a pretty quick download for me, and I will seed it about a gig. Thanks again, and to all downloaders, please seed!"
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-04-16T19:27Z,"thx 979, Sanctum is a bluray rip :)
Then, . . Clerks,
I couldn't wake up early, I'm trying hard, setting alarm in phone & system, still couldn't, I think I should give my number to you to wake me up early, lol, 
this is the reason, else I would've done it ages b4, sorry for that, 
Now downloading Sanctum, will be doing it after The Seventh Seal, I dont have time to up two movies a day, u/l speed is low compared to d/l speed. what a pity, haah?
I'll be the only uploader posting long comments than the supporters, I'm always like this, time to shut my mouth, peace out :)"
