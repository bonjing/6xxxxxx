The 45-minute feature from Pennebaker looks at the impressions of Moscow and its citizens under the regime of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, centered around the opening of the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscowâ€™s Sokolniki Park. The exhibition, supported by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, was one of the first cultural exchanges between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. that served as a critical breakthrough to begin the thaw of the Cold War between the two super powers.

Opening in Moscow plays like a travelogue, providing a social document on the cultural divide between 1950s Soviet Union and America. The film is shot in colour â€” with a few black and white interludes â€” and focuses on the opening of the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow. I had expected there to be a little more focus on the logistics behind proposing such an event (I would imagine there wouldâ€™ve been some interesting roadblocks during the process) and the planning and construction of the facility. We do see a bit of this in the first part of the film, but the majority of time is spent watching the Russian citizens marvel at the wonders of American life â€” via staged demonstrations â€” and in turn, looking at typical life in Moscow.
