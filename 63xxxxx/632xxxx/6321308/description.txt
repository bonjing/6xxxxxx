J.B.LENOIR DOWN IN MISSISSIPPI
Label: L & R
Format: Mp3@320

Recorded in September 1966, shortly before his death the following spring, this session was Lenoir's most effective fusion of acoustic blues, African percussion, and contemporary, topical songwriting." "Voodoo Music," and "Feelin' Good" bring the African influence to the fore, while J.B. addresses tough issues like Vietnam and discrimination more directly than any other bluesman of the time on cuts like "Down In Mississippi," "Shot on Meredith," and "Vietnam Blues."
