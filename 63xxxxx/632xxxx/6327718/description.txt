                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Celebrated chef Raymond Blanc welcomes the cameras into his kitchen to share  
 his treasured cooking secrets. Filmed in the lively surroundings of his       
 working Oxfordshire kitchen, this programme features a range of inspirational 
 and achievable recipes for cooks of all abilities.                            
                                                                               
 In this episode, Raymond celebrates the freshest summer greens. Beginning with
 a simple yet vibrant pistou soup, laden with summer vegetables and bursting   
 with basil, topped with crispy croutons and meltingly rich parmesan.          
                                                                               
 Next a dish ideal for a warm summer's day - poached salmon resting on a bed of
 citrusy sorrel served with a zingy lemon sauce. The combination of crisp      
 chicory, ripe pears and walnuts creates a flavour-packed salad perfectly      
 paired with a rich, creamy Roquefort dressing.                                
                                                                               
 And to round off, an exquisite spinach ravioli encasing a perfectly poached   
 quail's egg, accompanied by a light beurre blanc, earthy wild mushrooms and   
 fragrant micro-herbs - delivered direct to Raymond's kitchen by specialist    
 grower Richard Vine.                                                          
                                                                               
 Raymond also visits the Cotswolds to discover a nutty alternative to olive oil
 - beautifully golden, cold-pressed rapeseed oil.  
                            
                                 Enjoy!
