WHY WHY WHY WHY???

I'd rather delete and redownload than unRAR every FUCKING episode. 

Yes, I should have looked at the file count and wondered why it was so high before I downloaded it. My mistake.

BitTorrent is designed to fix EVERYTHING you used to need RAR/ZIP/ARJ/whatever for. Need a piece resent? BT does it for you, and you'll probably never notice!

Skip this one, go for something that isn't RARed."

Torrents with massive amounts of RAR parts are terrible and unnecessary."
