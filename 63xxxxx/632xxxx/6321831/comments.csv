Unbearable, unfortunately."

,babybluetits24,2011-04-27T16:15Z,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_Nightmares its part 8 according to that
,Seth01,2011-04-30T10:59Z,"Agreed there were no audio sync issues whatsoever.  Use VLC and you'll be fine.  And the reason this is showing as ep10 here and ep08 in wiki is because the wiki doesn't count the 2 ""revisted"" episodes.  Thanks for this."
