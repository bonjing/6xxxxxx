[W4F PRESENTS]: Animal.Mega.Moves.S01E02.Elephant.Herd.HDTV.XviD-W4F

[AIR DATE] 2011/04/16  (AU)
[RELEASE DATE]: 2011/04/17

Genre: Reality/Documentary

Description:
How do you move monstrous mammals, enormous elephants, restless 
rhinos, hefty horses and speedy sharks?  You call in the services of 
the big movers.  These larger than life characters are working with 
the ultimate delivery deadline - their cargo must arrive on time, 
intact....and alive. Follow specialist teams of animal movers, vets and 
transport engineers as they attempt to relocate animals across the 
globe by air and road in new episodes of Animal Mega Moves.

Elephant Herd
In Malawi, drought has pushed elephants and villagers into a dangerous
conflict that has already caused injury and death on both sides. The
solution is to move an entire herd some 250 miles across the country
to the safety of the Majete Wildlife Reserve; but that's easier said
than done...
