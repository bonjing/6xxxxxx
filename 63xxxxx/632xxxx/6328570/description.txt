No Need To Argue, sophomore album by irish band The Cranberries, is a timeless work of art. The music, the powerful Dolores O'Riordan's voice and the lyrics all shape up together beautifully to form a masterpiece. Zombie is one of the best songs of the 90's; Ridiculous Thoughts is the most haunting track on the album; Dreaming My Dreams is a beautiful love ballad and so is I Can't Be With You. The included four tracks live cd contains two great songs from previous album: Dreams and Linger.
