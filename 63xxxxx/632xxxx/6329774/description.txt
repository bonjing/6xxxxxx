Jerry Springer: Bad Boys & Naughty Girls [VHS]
Jerry Springer says it best in his introduction to this video: \\\"We\\\'ve compiled some of the baddest, nastiest, goofiest, and wildest guests into one show.\\\" This 54-minute tape--highlights from Jerry Springer\\\'s ever-popular TV talk show--is for those who like their violence without nudity; it\\\'s a Too Hot for TV but without the breasts. Watch a pregnant woman whacking on her boyfriend\\\'s lover. See mothers whaling on their sons\\\' girlfriends. Couples going at each other. Viewers going after Klansmen (in the appropriately titled episode, \\\"Viewers Battle the Klan\\\"). Prostitutes pulling hair and clawing faces. It\\\'s all on this tape. Clips come from such evocatively titled shows such as \\\"Honey ... I\\\'m a Call Girl,\\\" \\\"I Have Too Many Lovers,\\\" \\\"You Dumped Me at the Altar,\\\" \\\"Guess What ... I\\\'m a Man!\\\" \\\"I\\\'m Pregnant ... Stop Cheating,\\\" \\\"Who\\\'s the Father of My Baby?\\\" and \\\"Paternity Test: I Slept with Two Brothers,\\\" just to name a few.
