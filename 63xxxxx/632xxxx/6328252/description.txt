Helen Reddy
The Best Of Helen Reddy (2005)


Helen Reddy began performing at the age of four in her native Australia; by the early 60s she had her own television series. Between 1971 and 1978, Reddy hit the Top 40 fourteen times with her smooth, airy light-pop singles, including the number ones "Delta Dawn," "Angie Baby," and "I Am Woman." As her hits petered out toward the end of the '70s, her acting work increased, including roles in Pete's Dragon, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and Airport 1975.
