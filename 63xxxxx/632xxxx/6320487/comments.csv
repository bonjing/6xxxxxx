,deejis,2011-04-16T06:20Z,And don't forget to buy this track on iTunes when you are able! Support Lady Gaga!

,zophras,2011-04-17T14:41Z,"This is NOT an official iTunes release. THe sound is distorted and it doesn't show up in iTunes as ""Purchased AAC"". The ACTUAL iTtunes release is here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6321776/Lady_Gaga_-_Judas_(iTunes_Plus_ACC)_(Leaked_By_RNBxBeatz)"

I don't know how this wouldn't be an official iTunes download when I downloaded it myself. I even just downloaded this torrent(which I uploaded myself) and the sound quality was perfect. So, zophras, stop trolling please. People will download this torrent if they want to."
,deejis,2011-04-29T00:50Z,"Also, if anyone wanted proof as to whether this is an actual/official iTunes purchase, I have downloaded my own torrent and opened it in iTunes, and have uploaded an image of the iTunes info here: http://img849.imageshack.us/img849/3687/proofr.jpg"
,deejis,2011-04-29T00:52Z,Ok so apparently TPB violates ImageShacks ToS. One moment while I find a new image host...
