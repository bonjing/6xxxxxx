Seed after your download is over, you'll seed only the files 
you choose to download. Please. 
Share with other people, best way you can.
But seed. Share. Do not Hit & Run.

This is NOT a download site,
this is FILE SHARING SITE.

IF PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO STAY AND SEED 
AFTER THEIR BELLY IS FULL
TORRENT DIES!!!

Last 30 days I have steady 99% of Hit&Runs.
I haven't asked for "great" sacrifice or martyrdom:
"Share with other people, best way you can. (notice BEST WAY... not NONE)
Give back - at least a little.
Exchange bytes DURING the download. Share. 
Do not Hit & Run."

Number of Hit&Runs - increased.

It cannot be forever.

ANTI HIT&&RUN MEASURES ARE ACTIVE NOW!!!

SORRY FOR "COLLATERAL" DAMAGE.

AND - NO REQUESTS WOULD BE TAKEN TILL FURTHER NOTICE.

Worth repeating:
"Exchange of received bytes during the download is important now - DO NOT set your download speed at max. and upload speed at minimum. If peers doesn't share bytes already in swarm - they would probably finish with download - never!

 Seeding afterward is of secondary importance - if people are good and want to share with other people pleasure and enthusiasm they feel about some show or movie - they would stay and give. Best way they can, right?"
