hey dear whats up, 
as I see hit&Runs increased. and you said ""ANTI HIT&&RUN MEASURES ARE ACTIVE NOW!!! .. SORRY FOR ""COLLATERAL"" DAMAGE."" What are those.  . Seeding for less time from your end. Why not try to upload like EZTV does, ..seperate file for each file. ??

,r-0987,2011-04-18T20:03Z,Thanks! for family guy...
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-18T20:39Z,"@hakuna_matata: I thought (wrongly) that you would understand. In short:

1st I am ""twentyforty"" not [eztv].

2nd I have 2 upload slots for no one of the people present pay nothing. You wont pay a dime, a nickle, nada, shit, zero, nothing - and old saying goes 'baggers cannot be choosers'. 
This TV pack has 8 files inside, four pairs. And do the math - first and last torrent would have 16 hours difference. What with Monday's shows? 12 shows? And when I STOP to seed one in order to start new one - who would seed?

I ""pour"" 90% of bytes - when I leave - torrent dies and upload is so slow that is unbearable for many who doesn't like watching shows from Monday at Thursday...

Besides, who doesn't like it - is one click away from fulfilling your dream - far far away.

3rd. Number of Hit&Runs is NOT connected with TV packs - MOVIES are single torrents, right?
Why then, for fuck's sake, MOVIES have 99.8% Hit&Runs? 

Because my encodes are bad?  No. My encodes for seven years are best in given category. Problem is in changed ""audience"", my little fellow, and I explained that in more thousands words and stupid (and illustrative) is how nobody listen things he personally do not consider important."

,believenu,2011-04-18T20:58Z,"I am sorry to hear about your router/modem . are they the same as here in Canada/North America. If someone somewhere had a extra one??? I think that even a older one here that works ? again I am not sure but  certain companies here use certain modems and as they charge for renting as well as buying,companies often offering a free modem and if you are like me a lot of people don't throw the old ones away, perhaps one might work. I know last year jon 4 fun and lilars(GRHS) tried to assist. but I know that there may be a load around here and even closer to home to you and the cost of postage..It might be better than purchasing  I know that funds are quite limited for you as well I know but if you could find a compatable one perhaps you can work it out between you. 
Thank you for all. seeding is sharing.
I have a question. If I am seeding a movie and/or tv pack and you tell us torrent is dead after certain time. I don't often load the whole pack. Am I wasting my bandwidth on these shows and/or movies?..Some appear active. I will still hang on to torrent until end of week pack to reseed the weekly torrent but can I delete some others? (I don't have much free space "

Sorry.

BTW, The Killing is very very good and Games of Thrones look as expected - promising."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-18T21:13Z,"@believenu: Thanks on your concern. My router (as common practice between European providers goes) is common made for my ISP, router is given by ISP, and only routers/modems provided by ISP are approved for use of their network. Therefore, I must apply (in written form for replacement /phisically impossible for me/ - and - have few hundreth Euros when replacement is approved - and - pick the new device in one of ISP sale-spots /impossible too/). I am unable to make any of these, so - that's why I am definitely in ""panic-mode"". I simply cannot find any solution, and my current condition doesn't allow me to repair busted electronic myself (I tried that yesterday).
Well..."

[V],twentyforty,2011-04-18T21:38Z,"@believenu: Weekly pack exists only for people who have one or two unfinished downloads from week before and for those who have been away from computer and need to catch up. People on slow connections never ever should try to download more their line allows in 48h. People with 10 kB/s DL download 30-35 MB in one hour. Everybody must do the math and should be reasonable.
Point being (that is why such Intro) - you can't help them all, and by loading weekly pack you do more harm then good. 
Regarding ""can I delete things I need to remove and continue to seed smaller amount"" - it's easy: press Stop, delete the files you want to delete, UNMARK (files in Files Tab would show ""Skipped"", as explained in long Headers) files you just deleted - and right-click on torrent choosing Recheck. When Recheck finishes, Start torrent. That's all.

And - do not overseed. Do not try to go beyond point of diminishing returns. You must find your own metrics and - a measure."

spiritualiste is a regular but he is referring to facebook page which a guy named abciscrazy used to post in 20-40 torrents is a FAKE.

[V],twentyforty,2011-04-26T13:15Z,"LOL Let pretend that I don't have FaceBook page at all, (even if I do have one from last year and I opened it to ease troubles in contacting me) because, as spiritiualiste rightly said, a fake FaceBook page was recently opened.

Therefore, my friend madtown and few others use my ""original"" page, which I never visited except to reply on messages from just one-two friends.

For security reasons (not to get people into troubles) - we must forget that FB page exists... and madtown knows which one you should use.

I have public gmail account long enough - but I got in past week e-mails from ten people - and judging from that - I'll be back - NEVER.

Stupid me, aside from expecting more (shit like ""many small helping hands would get together"") I actually planned to acquire new seeding account and make number of seeded torrents to five-six (instead of two right now) without troubles of switching one down to make bandwidth to different one - a rotation of a kind - and make SEEDING time LONGER - from current 48h to ""as much as needed"".

I can forget about that. I need few bucks for that, from stable steady donors, and for now, I would hardly keep two ones I have - jon and redriding. Thanks can go to these two and without their constant support you all be downloading from my home PC with 50 kB/s line... and movies?... probably none."
