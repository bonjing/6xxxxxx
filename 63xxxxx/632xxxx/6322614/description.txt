Filmmaker and composer Thierry De Mey shot the film Rosas danst Rosas in June 1996 at the RITO School in Leuven (Belgium), a building designed by the architect Henry van de Velde. Rosas danst Rosas, a choreography for four dancers, was created at the Brussels Kaaitheaster Festival in 1983.

Four dancers do battle; with each other, with the stage and with the public - a fight to the bitter end - set to the minimalistic music of Peter Vermeersch and Thierry De Mey. One camera records the dance itself and a second highlights specific details using close-ups and panning camera movements. The way in which the images are edited give the film an extra rhythmical layer.
