,Manadona,2011-04-19T13:50Z,"Those guys over at pesedit isn't very happy about this torrent, because they don't make any money if you don't use their stinking links to download the patch, but who gives a fuck... right?

Trying to make money off edited gamefiles is just pathetic anyway. I'll stop seeding once I hit 50gb or so uploaded, it's at roughly 25gb at the moment... so give or take 2-3 days then."
,MiZoSpaDe,2011-04-21T05:13Z,"who give a fuck , they using uploading it's the worst way to download , and just ignoring torrents "" the best way for share "" cause making some money from editing an original copyrighted files ?!!! so greedy , thx dude keep seeding as far as u can , i will too "
,Manadona,2011-04-21T20:08Z,"ok, I'm at 80gb uploaded now, and it seems like a healthy bunch of seeders (45 at the time of posting this) so I will cut off my seed. Enjoy the patch guys, and if you're in a good mood you could always press the links from pesedit just to give them those precious coins for the effort.

Have a good one guys!"
