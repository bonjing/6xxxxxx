Hey all, I have just started this new Music Blog at [url]Did.YouHearTheNew.com[/url]. I did not start this site for any other reason besides to put up new music for my friends to listen to, since I always keep going "Hey, did you hear the new blah blah..." So, this site and now this mix-tape is one other way I have to put some music out. Hopefully others can enjoy it as well. 

Enjoy!!
