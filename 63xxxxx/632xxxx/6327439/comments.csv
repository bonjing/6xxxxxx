,charlilolo,2011-04-30T16:15Z,"I'm seeding pretty much all day everyday, but because it's new there are barely any other seeds yet!"
,arthoheen,2011-05-03T17:23Z,You've advertised this torrent on: Skins - The Complete Season 5 [HDTV]-BiA. Does this attention seeking behavior give you the kicks?
,charlilolo,2011-05-06T19:44Z,"attention seeking? no. I literally just wanted to be able to delete the files from my computer, knowing that I would be able to redownload these reliable videos together without having to endlessly search, and what would be the point if no-one knew that the torrent existed?"
,afaska,2011-08-28T02:40Z,A/V anyone?
