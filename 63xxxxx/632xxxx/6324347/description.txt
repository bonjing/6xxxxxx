About This Audiobook
====================
This text-to-speech audiobook was created using the excellent new Neospeech voice Bridget. It is imho better than the lesser human narrators. I suggest sampling the first file before downloading the complete collection. There are some quirks, such as heteronyms using the same pronunciation, or the spelling out of sounds, but the correct interpretation will be obvious from the context. Personally, I have created and listened to several books with this voice and it has been a revelation (Yes, it's very good).

Book Description
================

In the third book in an astounding, genre-breaking run, China MiÃ©ville expands the horizon beyond the boundaries of New Crobuzon, setting sail on the high seas of his ever-growing world of Bas Lag.

The Scar begins with MiÃ©ville's frantic heroine, Bellis Coldwine, fleeing her beloved New Crobuzon in the peripheral wake of events relayed in Perdidio Street Station. But her voyage to the colony of Nova Esperium is cut short when she is shanghaied and stranded on Armada, a legendary floating pirate city. Bellis becomes the reader's unbelieving eyes as she reluctantly learns to live on the gargantuan flotilla of stolen ships populated by a rabble of pirates, mercenaries, and press-ganged refugees. Meanwhile, Armada and Bellis's future is skippered by the "Lovers," an enigmatic couple whose mirror-image scarring belies the twisted depth of their passion. To give up any more of MiÃ©villeâ€™s masterful plot here would only ruin the voyage through dangerous straits, political uprisings, watery nightmares, mutinous revenge, monstrous power plays, and grand aspirations.

MiÃ©ville's skill in articulating brilliantly macabre and involving descriptions is paralleled only by his ability to set up world-moving plot twists that continually blow away the reader's expectations. Man-made mutations, amphibious aliens, transdimensional beings, human mosquitoes, and even vampires are merely neighbors, coworkers, friends, and enemies coexisting in the dizzying tapestry of diversity that is Armada. The Scar proves MiÃ©ville has the muscle and talent to become a defining force as he effortlessly transcends the usual clichÃ©s of the genre.
