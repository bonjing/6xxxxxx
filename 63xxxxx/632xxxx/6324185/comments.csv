,Killjoy88,2011-04-17T15:24Z,"i was also wondering about the F1 . I remember the reasons for not encoding it, but fingers crossed. I know you wish to keep your quality standards high, but in my opinion it was watchable and i had no problems with it. ill just eagerly wait for an answer. 

Thank you +1"
,believenu,2011-04-17T16:53Z,"Ok I am going to repeat this comment for a while(If thats ok 20-40) as some peeples are stund and don't get how easy it is to do..
By the way leeches are blood sucking slimey creatures which you burn off you so BEWARE!

for most of people who are in my situ (I have a dsl line) or those on a regular cable which is open as long as computer is on even if I am not online I am seeding torrent I have d/l even I my sleep I am sharing with others . It realy is, for anyone who does not have a limited internet service(I would say a lot or most in The largest country in North America) easy to share .just leave utorrent running(or whatever one you use) .. check to see if it needs a forced start and go to bed. even if you have laptop.. just plug it in turn it on and go to bed it is simple and easy I leave it there until whenever and I only have a computer with 75Gb so if I can do it...If you have a limit do at least 1:1 .take 500mb give 500mb simple.
At the end of the week when this genus(20-40) does his weekly pack you can add it to his but d/l torrent select none or one you missed or would like to try and the rest would seed automatically..I know this has been explained too many times to mention but come on everyone give me a break .I am a true beginner at this but even I can do it.. 
remember SEEDING IS SHARING. 

thank you."

[V],twentyforty,2011-04-17T17:13Z,"@Killjoy88: OK then, give me few hours tough, it's for sure over 2h30 long, and I must find, download and encode.
Do NOT forget to defend me later, when some moron pops-out and say how crappy encode is."
,Killjoy88,2011-04-17T17:38Z,"@20-40: thank you - once again you are too kind. You deserve much better than you receive. Be rest assured, i have your back, as always. "

,the_shroud,2011-04-18T04:41Z,"Yes my friend, I made it. Its like a higher power roaming in ""the grid"". Everytime I come here pleading, someone (or a few peers) will connect with me and raise me from less than 3kbps to about 30."
,john.shephard26,2011-04-27T14:59Z," O my god, thats the same thing here, do you think we should do that as often as they stop seeding?increase our chances to actually download something with in a year?"
,john.shephard26,2011-04-28T15:33Z," Well, The_shroud ,you should feel lucky I cant download anything since it stopped three days ago.I mean there is only one seeding maybe it shouldn't be like that, its like hit and run."
