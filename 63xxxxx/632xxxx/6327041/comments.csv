+ Detailed model

+ Detailed and clear instruments

______________________________________

- Avmap gps lots of missing functions for example direct-to

- Stall characteristics are crap

- nose gear way too soft

- Cruise speed too low compared to real airplane

- Engine stalls instantly when you are switching tanks from left-off-right and vice versa. It takes atleast 10 seconds to burn the fuel in the Carburetor float bowl and fuel lines.

- Cyllinder temperature allways peaks

- fuel consumption way too low compared to real airplane (about 10l/h with full throttle in-game, about 27l/h in real airplane)

- Landing light doesnt illuminate

 in my opinion this aircraft is not finished, we need a patch!

,svedan832,2011-04-24T18:41Z,"in addition to what i have written above, 

- The oil cooler lever doesnt work 

- And also when you extend flaps the nose of the aircraft should drop and when you retract flaps the aircraft should pitch up. in this addon its the opposite"
,svedan832,2011-04-24T20:07Z,"- The fuel tank selector doesnt work, it doesnt matter if select left or right tank, it will allways use both tanks simultaneously"
,svedan832,2011-04-24T20:37Z,"- Aircraft weight is wrong, empty weight is not 566kg and max gross weight is not 997kg. I think that Lionheart team have mistaken pounds for kilograms

- The manual is wrong, this aircraft doesnt have a Rotax 112UL. It has Rotax 912S (ULS)"
