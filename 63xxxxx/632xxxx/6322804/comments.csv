Focus is the BBCs science and technology monthly magazine. Jargon-free and accessible, you dont need a PhD in particle physics to enjoy reading it. All you need is a quizzical mind that wants to understand the world around you, and gain a fact or two to keep up your sleeve in a pub quiz emergency."
