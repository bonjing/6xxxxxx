The music I play springs from the American oral tradition, from the largely unheralded but gifted poets and musicians who gave us a truly American music called the Blues. That music has grown in many directions â€¦ rock, Chicago electric blues, rap, soul, R&B. The music on this album is where all of that came from. It's blues from the Piedmont and from rural Mississippi. It's music from the hill country where white and black traditions mixed words and chords. It's rags and songs from New Orleans, where European traditions were infused with new vigor by native musical style. And there's some Tin Pan Alley, too, because the music's too good to leave out. It's all just Good Old Blues. It's the kind of music you play on your porch, the kind you have in your head all day.
