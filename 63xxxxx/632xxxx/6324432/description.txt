plot

Small town Sheriff Michael Spencer (Luke Goss) gets stone-walled by big city detectives when he asks them to investigate his younger brother's death. His brother David (Ryan Donowho), a gang member, was murdered by members of his own gang for having wanted to quit the gang lifestyle in order to marry Anya (AnnaLynne McCord). Spencer takes off his badge and goes undercover to seek justice for the death of his brother, and crosses paths with Arturo (Val Kilmer), the leader of an international ring involved in human trafficking.
