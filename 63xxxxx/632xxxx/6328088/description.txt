"Cut Off the Head"

Vice President Jarvis (Bill Smitrovich) 
vocalizes his lack of faith in President 
Martinez's (Blair Underwood) leadership 
and agrees to meet with an adversary. 
Senator Catherine Lewis (guest star 
Virginia Madsen, "Sideways") reports the 
findings of her surreptitious blood 
testing of the White House staff only to 
find one holdout, someone very close to 
the President. Sophia (Laura Innes) 
pushes forward in her search for a super 
weapon. And, after witnessing injustices 
within the Sleeper community, Leila 
(Sarah Roemer) begins to question where 
she belongs. Elsewhere, Sean (Jason 
Ritter) and Vicky (Taylor Cole) find 
whom they've been hunting for, but it 
may be too late.

Enjoy :)
