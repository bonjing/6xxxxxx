,Shauncold,2011-06-10T02:52Z,"I couldn't get the fix to work(from what I read, you have to have the original disc to make a copy of, not a download)this is just what I've read, not sure if true but I couldn't get fix to work with a download."
,Demonikred,2011-06-10T13:01Z,cool now that there is a fix http://psgroove.com/content.php?1110-Operation-Flashpoint-Red-River-v1.01-Patch-for-CFW-3.55 but extacting these RAR files is a bitch..took me 4 and a half hours. still thanks for the upload
,Shauncold,2011-06-10T22:02Z,I found out what the problem was for me. This game will not play off of external hdd(must be installed on internal hdd). Hope this helps because I had put this game on my gamefly Q list because I thought you had to make a copy off of original disc.
