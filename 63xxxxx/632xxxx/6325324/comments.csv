If you are on a mac, Fluke works great for getting flac files into iTunes, and once they are imported you can convert to aiff or apple lossless. I usually set the program to do its thing with no other programs running because its a taxing process, but I have a LOT of full CD quality in my iTunes now because if this great little app, Fluke. Im sure there is something for windows, I searched 'import flac to itunes'"
