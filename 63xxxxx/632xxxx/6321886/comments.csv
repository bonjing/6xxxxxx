,snair1591,2011-04-16T16:24Z,"thanx alot for your work.:)
people keep seeding,keep sharing."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-16T16:32Z,"@the_shroud: April 14 is seeded to April 16. After that one should keep eventual unfinished downloads by stopping daily.pack torrent and loading weekly.pack torrent, choosing just unfinished downloads. It's easy, and using four days out of seven should be enough for anyone, no matter how slow line one has, my friend."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-16T16:45Z,"@the_shroud:  ... sorry, forgotten: People on slow lines must avoid simultaneous downloads, their line is often ""overwhelmed"" and cannot cope with pure handshakes of other fellow peers (when their programs ask yours ""have you something I need"").
Therefore, much better is to finish one and start another (if line is below 30 kB/s DL/ 10 kB/s UL) but desperate times seek desperate measures. You should take from one torrent for 24h, take what you can, giving priority to shows you like more - then load next Daily - but finish unfinished later with Weekly."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-16T17:46Z,"ALWAYS set the priority to ""high"" or 15 for the shows you want to see most, and leave the rest as medium or 8, as they will be filled first instead of them all ending up incomplete."
,longdistance,2011-04-16T17:56Z,"Great smorgasbord this time! Thanks for Camelot, Fringe, Sanctuary and Smallville. Sorry for the idiots who take but don't seed. I try to do my best (usually I get up to 1.0) but at times cannot connect to others because I am behind three different servers."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-16T17:58Z,"e.g. In Bittorrent, left click on the download you want to prioritize, go down to the tabs in the middle of the page, left click on the ""files"" tab, right click on the show you are interested in, scroll down to ""Priority"", hold mouse cursor over it until the popup window shows, go over to the priority number or name, and left click it."
,the_shroud,2011-04-16T18:17Z,"Thanks for the tip my friend :)
""ask and you shall be given""....... should have asked sooner. There's more to your wisdom every time"
,cindal,2011-04-16T19:22Z,Thank you again and again and again!
,t.trikiti,2011-04-16T19:47Z,"thanks man! I've a slow connection, so your uploads are gold for me! thanks again! "

,skyline3d,2011-04-16T20:06Z,"Thanks , could you just add some other New popular comedy TV shows like Community? http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1439629/"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-16T20:32Z,"It is old show. Season two is near end.

""Do NOT request inclusion of TV shows in my schedule; that's my call. The removal of some show depends on many factors, however, be sure that shows would be dropped if I spot lack of interest, hungry hard-fisting crowd or too high a number of Hit and Runs. These decisions are my own.""

,hazel13,2011-04-17T04:25Z,Thank you for fringe =>
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-17T08:03Z,"Thanks.

Exchange bytes during the download is important now - DO NOT set your download speed at max. and upload speed at minimum. If peers doesn't share bytes already in swarm - they would probably finish with download - never!

Seeding afterward is of secondary importance - if people are good and want to share with other people pleasure and enthusiasm they  feel about some show or movie - they would stay and give. Best way they can, right?

@jon4fun: Welcome back, my friend."
,ladderman22,2011-04-17T20:49Z,Thanks a lot for Camelot and Chaos.
