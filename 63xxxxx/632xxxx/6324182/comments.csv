Как бы не бесили меня наши душные модеры - всё таки пересоздам на (с)рутрекере"
,goto80,2011-08-28T13:46Z,Nice one! Would be fantastic if someone would make a compilation with *everything* released. I challenge you :D
,Clockie,2012-03-15T19:11Z,"Challenge accepted! :)
And/but - if you want to, I'll remove the torrent (or the paid albums from it) but I think it's kinda honest to include the main parts and not to have the true fan/fun parts as for ""Made on Internet"", and I don't have it too :(

As for *everything released*.. I already have the Bushrunner EP! But for audiotape...  That would be nice if you re-release it digital, or send me for that torrent!:) or, I decided to just recompile it, since it was of old chiptune which I've got too.
Keep it up!,
BTW my favorite album is 'Contech', give us some more :"
