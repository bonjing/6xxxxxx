Description......: As Vesuvius rained destruction on the the Roman town of Pompeii, 74 men, women and children took refuge in a dark 
		   cellar. There, they waited, while their friends and neighbors fell victim to the heat and ash that swallowed the 
		   city. They thought they had survived the worst - instead, they became the last people to die in the disaster. The 
		   discovery of their bones - perfectly preserved - reveals much about the way the people of Pompeii lived - and 
		   died.
