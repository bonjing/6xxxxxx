Storyline:The film opens with young novelist Jennifer Hills (Sarah Butler) driving to a shop to pick up the keys to a cabin she has rented for a few months and to get directions. She is going to the cabin in the woods down south to write her second novel. On her way to the cabin, she gets lost and pulls into a gas station where she encounters a group of grease heads. She accidentally spills some fluid on the head of the group, Johnny (Jeff Branson), and hits the panic button on her car, scaring him and causing him to spill gasoline all over himself. The other guys make fun of him for getting scared. Jennifer drives off into the gravelly road to the cabin. A few days pass and something strange happens. One night, she begins to hear noises every so often that make her uneasy. Her first visitor is Matthew (Chad Lindberg), who is sent to the cabin to fix the broken toilet. His reward is a kiss from Jennifer, and the shy Matthew runs out of the cabin. He later meets up with the group and tells them "she likes me", and the guys begin to talk about Jennifer.
