- This torrent has 1 seeder and 0 lecheers, you know why? because your torrent is sucky, so to avoid this try to make them 2 sizes, high resolution 720p or better and lowe resolution 420p or 720x405 x264/H.264 with the highest quality.

- Audio if possible AAC HE v2 [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding#Standardization]The HE-AAC v2 Profile (AAC LC with SBR and Parametric Stereo)[/url]5.1 or 7.1.

- If you rip convert subtitles to .srt and include them in a mp4/mkv container (avi sucks)."
