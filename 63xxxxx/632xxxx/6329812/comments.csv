,rigmar_radio,2011-04-20T18:53Z,Hi I see you are seeding more than one torrent at the same time.  Never a good Idea.   I am trying to download Air Force but no one has stayed in the swarm after downloading 100%.   Sad to say this is the Pirate Bay mentality where we have no penelty for now giving back 100% of what you downloaded sigh.    You have 4 peers on this swarm non of whom have more than 7% of the whole.   Please seed for the next 48 hours so we can take over from you.   Thank you.
