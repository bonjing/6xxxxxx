Based on Leo Tolstoy's famous novel and choreographed by Maya Plisetskaya to music by Rodion Shchedrin, 
this film is a vehicle for the extraordinary talents of Mme. Plisetskaya. 
Co-starring the spectacular Alexander Godunov as Vronsky, 
Anna Karenina is a completely cinematic rendering of this acclaimed production.
Dealing primarily with the psychological elements of the character of Anna, 
the ballet is a genuinely remarkable work, beautiful and penetrating.
