,AD884,2011-04-17T23:31Z,Thanks A LOT!!
,criss_x,2011-04-17T23:46Z,could you also upload the post race forum please :)
,synchronicityii,2011-04-17T23:46Z,"Thank you so much, I wouldn't be able to see any F1 races without your uploads! Your work is truly appreciated!"
,shreddir,2011-04-18T00:00Z,"I just hope my PC circa 2003 using Northwoods Pentium 4 cpu, Media Player Home Cinema, and CoreAVC decoder software can play this video properly.  I have no problems with the 720p HD mkv file H.264 encodes for Australian and Malaysian races posted so far this season."
,GetTubed,2011-04-18T00:01Z,Grateful for your efforts
,mojazubarka,2011-04-18T00:13Z,jorrell0733 10Q so much. Really appreciate your effort.
,EdoSensei,2011-04-18T02:34Z,"Shreddir, if you're having problems playing  HD, why don't you download the SAFCuk009 file? It's half the size of this file coz in lower res, but still great to watch."
,shreddir,2011-04-18T06:21Z,"EdoSensei, Because he unlike the Australian and Malaysian GPs, he has not uploaded ANGELICS 720p encode yet.  I don't want to watch some crappy Standard Def version.  Once you've seen 720p it looks terrible to go back to SD.  If any of you know where the 720p version is please tell me?   One guy wrote that it's on ""The Box"" but that site is a pain in the ass to get registered on and keep a 1.0 upload ratio."

,il_grammo,2011-04-19T21:09Z,Thank you so very much Jorrell for the hard work you've put into giving us HD quality F1
,dlwebb123,2011-04-20T06:07Z,"i tried to run this through mkv2vob to play on on my ps3, but the video would cut out.  the audio was fine but the video was choppy.  Anybody else have this problem?"
,Niagra,2011-04-20T07:08Z,"So weird, this torrent doesnt show up in my search result! But thanks, jorrell0733, you're doing a great job!"
,Niagra,2011-04-20T07:10Z,"Just realized, everything else has been named F1, and this is Formula 1, so my search was F1 2011.. Stupid me!!"
