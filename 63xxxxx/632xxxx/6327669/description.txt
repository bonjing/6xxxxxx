Dave Stewart

Daryl Hall and Dave Stewart know a little something about being part of platinum-plus duos, and they take that experience both withâ€”and withoutâ€”their famous partners to explore some gems in the 41st and latest webisode of Live From Darylâ€™s House. The newest installment of the Webby award-winning Internet series, which recently made its broadcast debut on WGN America to impressive ratings, will debut at www.lfdh.com on April 15.

The show reunited the two veteran musicians, who worked together when Stewart co-produced Darylâ€™s 1986 solo album, Three Hearts in the Happy Ending Machine. A member of the Eurythmics with Annie Lenox and an award-winning producer, Stewart joined Daryl at his home for a set that featured the Top 40 single from that album in â€œDreamtime,â€ along with two classic Eurythmics hits, â€œMissionary Manâ€ and â€œHere Comes the Rain Again,â€ the latter featuring Daryl on piano and Dave on acoustic guitar. The pair also perform â€œThe Gypsy Girl and Me,â€ an autobiographical song from Stewartâ€™s upcoming album, The Blackbird Diaries, which he recorded at the famed Nashville studio and comes out June 28 on Weapons of Mass Entertainment/Surfdog Records through Razor & Tie Music.

Stewartâ€™s career spans more than 30 years and more than 100 million album sales, plus a Lifetime Achievement Award with Lenox. One of the most sought-after writers and music producers, Dave has crafted songs for and collaborated with the likes of Mick Jagger, Bono, Tom Petty, and Gwen Stefani, among many others, and has shared the stage with everybody from BB King, U2, Eric Clapton, Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan. His new album, The Blackbird Diaries, features a co-write with Bob Dylan and another with Stevie Nicks as well as duets with Nicks, Martina McBride, Colbie Caillat and a cameo by The Secret Sisters.
