,pzoned,2011-04-22T02:45Z,"Hmm... looks like I totally liked to everypony. Somehow I messed up and Episode 20 is actually a HDTV rip and not an iTunes rip. Don't worry, the quality is still totally awesome, but it contains those pesky hub watermarks (booo). I guess I'll include an actual itunes rip once the season is done in an updated complete torrent."
,Redcostar,2011-04-23T07:03Z,"How dare he say this is a kids show!?! Kids do not watch MLP! Thats like kids watching pr0n or driving cars! Absurd!
Awesome upload, btw

,a1s,2011-05-07T01:58Z,15 gigs?! that works out to about 30 megs per minute. Is this video made out of uncompressed bitmaps or something?!
,Phaux_The_Fox,2011-05-10T03:57Z,Hope you get the last few eps up soon! =D
