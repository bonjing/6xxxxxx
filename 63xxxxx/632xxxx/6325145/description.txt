      As the holiday season gets underway and the sun shines down
      on the southerly islands of the Outer Hebrides, new priest
      Father John Paul faces an uphill battle to keep his congregation
      coming to church. Meanwhile Donnie the dustman faces a typically
      'island' dilemma, and Father Roddy - a crofter as well as a
      parish priest - gets an important lesson in lambing.
