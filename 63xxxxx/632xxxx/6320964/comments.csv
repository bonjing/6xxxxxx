and what's the purpose of using spilt rar archives in a torrent anyways?"
,lontrus,2011-04-17T01:00Z,"goot to see someone notice it to .. i have whined about it everywhere .. but still dont see any progress ...
rar's are 70% of the times corrupted and as to be on torrent it is mentaly stuped"
,papitow,2011-04-17T02:40Z,"Yeah, fking rar files are for fking assholes."
,kukki2,2011-04-17T10:00Z,"You fucking whiners are assholes. I dont see why you keep whining. It takes 20 sec or less to extract it. Shouldnt kill anybody. Also scenesites accept this when it comes with rars.. oh.. i forgot, you're as cheap with your shitty computers as you are with your seeding .)"
,kukki2,2011-04-17T10:01Z,"And it doesnt give any crc error, lol. Please, go download somewhere else if you are that retarted. Nobody forces you to download this."
,escafu,2011-04-17T18:48Z,works fine - and things like this are in split rar archives because they originate from usenet
,lontrus,2011-04-17T19:15Z,"these rar's take pointless waist of space to seed this torrent ... thats why i dont download rar's ...
i want 1.09GB download and i dont want it to end 2GB on my hdd
and there have been times when i had no problem with extracting but since this is not 100% for me that it works then it's a waist of time downloading the corrupted files one by one as the winrar dont say more then one error ...
well maybe yes i am stuped but what is scenesites and how are they related with torrents ?
torrent works as downloading small size cut file from seeders and peers to compleate the file you are downloading ... why cant it be only 1 file what i can seed afterwards ... most people dont seed cause they dont want to hold waist of space on there hard drive what makes there computer slow"
,kaninelupus,2011-05-03T12:35Z,"Why do MORONS insist on uploading videos as split archive formats?? It often makes the resulting d/l BIGGER you F'WITS, or at the very least leaves it just as big... and created added problems! What on earth is the point??"
,kaninelupus,2011-05-03T12:36Z,"@kukki2

Oh, and what exactly have you uploaded... like EVER??"
