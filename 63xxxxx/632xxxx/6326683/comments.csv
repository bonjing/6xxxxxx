I played it with VLC Player, and I heard no sound at all, but from what I could see by their greeting, and mouth movements, the people seemed French, or German, so the sound isn't sorely missed by someone who doesn't speak either said language well. The video quality is good, and the content is good. 

Great upload. Thanks! :3"
