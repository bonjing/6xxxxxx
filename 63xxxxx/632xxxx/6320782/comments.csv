,MememeAye,2011-04-16T07:09Z,"Thanks a lot, appreciated : ).

I still think that ED is just trolling us, if they are then it will end up in lulz, on the other hand if they actually sold out, and went to making little girls cumm ..., it would be pretty sad as the OhInternet is exactly the opposite of what ed stood for ..."

,LOLerDude,2011-04-16T13:41Z,"Thank you, man. I was ready to throw my monitor at the wall. I was raging at that OhInternet crap.

I can't D/L it at the moment. I have to wait to next month (terrible wireless internet caps in Australia), so I hope that it still has seeds then.

Thanks again. :)"

,SuperInfinity,2011-04-19T03:50Z,"I wonder if censorship could be the root cause of this, or if some corperate entities or ""public interest"" quangos (state-funded quasi-government groups) took offence to some of the things on it or felt it was hurting their brand/company and decided to crush it. 

Why for example couldn't they put some ads along the side and say ""sorry guise""? This idea of ads all over the place and the whole thing censored is ridiculous.  "
,SuperInfinity,2011-04-19T03:54Z,"NOBODY is going to go to that site anymore. Their best chance was to keep the site the exact same way it was with the addition of so many ads and briefly mention it in their news and most people probably wouldn't even realize it. Maybe it's a small mercy that they were such idiots that they did this, good luck on your clone site. (they really are idiots, the reasons they gave for the site shutting down such as ""website that don't change their look become irrelevant"" are the stupidest things I've ever heard, they're really not very bright).
