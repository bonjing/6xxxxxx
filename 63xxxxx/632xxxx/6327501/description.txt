Shipwrecked on an uninhabited island, Robinson Crusoe fills his time in either building a shelter for himself, or by reminiscing about the years he spent at sea and the adventures that led him to where he is. The months roll by and the hardships become easier, especially with his herd of wild goats, the ship\\\'s dog and a friendly parrot to keep him company. But one day he comes across a strange footprint - friend or foe?, & Yes this is the one with that music!!!.
