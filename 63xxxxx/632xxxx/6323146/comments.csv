can you please edit or at least start adding rip info to your uploads? (languages, subtitles, etc esp for the kung fu). Your stuff looks great but nobody wants to dl a 4gb file only to see its not what they are looking for.

thanks"

Please e-mail me at DrWynnScott@gmail.com or leave comment on one of my torrents pages or on this page. Lotta Love, DrScott"
