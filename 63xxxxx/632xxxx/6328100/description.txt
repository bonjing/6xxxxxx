         The vicious kidney thieves gang of Rio de Janeiro. The        
         man from London who was run over by a steamroller and         
         lived. The bizarre case of a woman locked by mistake in       
         an asylum for five years. Three incredible stories, and       
          only one of them is actually true. Which is it? That

         We disagree with TVRage listing this as a new series. Syfy    
         is also airing the original episodes from the earlier         
         seasons that were shown on Biography channel, and so          
         this should be considered season 3 and not an entirely        
         separate series. Look at syfy's own listing and you           
         will clearly see they call it season 3. Here is the link
