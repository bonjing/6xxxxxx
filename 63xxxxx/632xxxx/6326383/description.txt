Dreamland v1 - Wendy99

Jimmy had disappeared two days ago and was very ill. When he returned home, the doctor could not identify his illness, and worst of all, how to cure her. You, as his older brother found the ticket to the amusement park had fallen from his pocket Jimmy. Waiting for you a long way in a creepy amusement park, to find his brother and save his life!
