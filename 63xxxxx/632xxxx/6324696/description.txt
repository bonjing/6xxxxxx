This album is mostly instrumental. Although Chris Leslie is best known for his fiddle playing in Fairport Convention, these cuts sound nothing like Fairport. Some of it sounds like music of Thailand or Tibet, and other parts sound jazzy or new age. Perhaps the Scottish band "Shooglenifty" are the nearest reference point. It has a shimmering, slightly hestitant quality to it.
