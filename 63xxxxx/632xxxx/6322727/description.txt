It is number 123 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, the second highest placement of the five Bob Marley albums on the list, after the posthumous compilation album "Legend". It is also regarded as one of the top reggae albums of all time."Concrete Jungle" is the opening track on their album and was one of the lead single from the album. 
  "One in Ten" is a single by UB40 released in 1981 on their second album "Present Arms". It reached No. 7 on the UK singles charts.
