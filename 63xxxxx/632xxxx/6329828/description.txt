Here is my private collection of rock ballads from the 70's to the 90's. 
I never found any good rock ballads CD's so I decided to make my own. 
I hope you enjoy it, there are many known artists in this collection but also a few unknown artist that you will never find on any commercial rock ballads CD. I think this is a rare collection.
