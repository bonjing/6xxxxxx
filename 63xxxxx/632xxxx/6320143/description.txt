Harold Lamb (Author), Charlton Griffin (Narrator)

"HANNIBAL: One Man Against Rome " is the breathtaking adventure of the great Carthaginian general who shook the foundations of Rome. Eluding several Roman legions sent out to intercept him in Spain and France, Hannibal astoundingly leads his small army of mercenaries over the Alps and thunders down into the Po Valley in 218 B.C. This violent and exciting narrative will thrill you with the accounts of heroism and brilliance displayed on both sides as the war rages mercilessly across the entire Western Mediterranean. Learn how the patience of Fabius Maximus and the genius of Lucius Cornelius Scipio finally turn the tide in this, the worldâ€™s first "global" conflict.

Hannibal Barca (ca. 248 B.C â€“ ca. 183 B.C.) is widely considered the greatest military commander of all time. He grew to manhood in Spain under the careful tutelage of his aristocrat father, the Carthaginian, Hamilcar. Upon the death of his brother-in-law, Hasdrubal, in 231, he became commander of the forces there and, backed by the Carthaginian government, subdued Spain south of the Ebro. At the end of the Second Punic War and his defeat at Zama, Hannibal settled down in Carthage to restore its broken fortunes. He succeeded so well that he raised the ire of the Romans and was pursued relentlessly to the East. Rather than fall into Roman hands, he committed suicide at Libyssa on the shore of the Sea of Marmora.
