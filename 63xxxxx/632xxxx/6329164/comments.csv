,greylion,2011-04-19T17:51Z,"Warning - spoilers:

I haven't seen it (yet), but sounds like a cross between The Mentalist, In Plain Sight, and The Unit, although not in a military setting.
I'm definitely going to check it out."
,greylion,2011-04-19T20:49Z,"Okay, forget about The Unit, no resemblance.
Forget about The Mentalist too, she's just a good detective, not a mentalist."
,greylion,2011-04-19T20:53Z,"Maybe it's just me, but this episode had a weird feeling to it. Maybe it's all the baby stuff, the kidnapping, sex offenders, and Lori's biological father, all of which took up most of the episode.
Not a good way to start a tv-series."
