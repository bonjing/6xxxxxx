A farmer unearths an old top hat on his property and with it an ancient Indian curse 
that lays waste to all the farmers crops. All of the adults of the farming community 
are afflicted by a strange sickness that slowly dries them up until they are dust. 
It is only when the farmer communes with the hat does he find what it is that will 
save them all.
