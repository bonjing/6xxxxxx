,TheSlamer,2011-04-16T12:59Z,"The problem still exists, I took the Iberia MD-82 and it still says the same thing. No gears, no vc, no cockpit. Only body and sound? Damnit......"

,madmanquincy,2011-04-17T18:24Z,@A380-800 you say you have the real one right uhm is it possible if you could unpack sp1 and share it?
,Scofit,2011-04-17T19:28Z,"What I don't like is the modeling over sites by the Devs. They couldn't even get the engines modeled correctly. The bullet exhaust bearing cones on the intakes have been placed at the rear of the engine as well, looks pretty stupid and you have to ask yourself, how that gets by the modelers. The forum asked for a fix back in Feb, and they still have done nothing.   "
,mickyfinny,2011-04-17T20:01Z,"Working fine here as well,many thanx for sharing."
,madmanquincy,2011-04-17T20:26Z,I dont get why your complaining don't use the aircraft. This is the best damn MD-80 since SGA's model (Something about flight1 md looks weird RETARDED and Leonard omg Dats a ugly F*CK*R. If you gonna complain about the engines comon. Flight 1 is for you.

Just simply go to your aircraft.cfg file, and  change the part of the aircraft of your choice and chane model=, to model=CT. Then you have Cone tail."
