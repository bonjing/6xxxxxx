Someone uploaded this file a few weeks back. Idk if anyone else had the same problems I had with the no gear no vc. But with a little searching over a CLS forums I was able to fix that prob. N must I add its a great model.

If only someone can do what this guy did and upload the rip version of SP1 with the cone model. 

Well enjoy the aircraft.

Tell me if it works.
