   Four Lions (2010)
  
  Four Lions tells the story of a group of British jihadists who 
  push their abstract dreams of glory to the breaking point. As 
  the wheels fly off, and their competing ideologies clash, what 
  emerges is an emotionally engaging (and entirely plausible) farce. 
  In a storm of razor-sharp verbal jousting and large-scale set pieces, 
  Four Lions is a comic tour de force; it shows that-while terrorism 
  is about ideology-it can also be about idiots.
