The files were collected from various sources over the years, so there is no constant audio quality. If you've found/uploaded a torrent with better audio quality for any of these albums, please add a link in the comments section.

Finally, I have to warn you that the filenames are in Greek, so there is always a chance that your OS or your torrent client cannot properly display them or even read them. OSes which support UTF8 and use unicode fonts should be ok.
