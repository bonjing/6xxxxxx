One of the most fascinating choreographies to have emerged from Russia during the last decades: 
Yuri Grigorovichâ€™s original ballet dramatizing Ivan the Terrible's reign as Czar of Russia. 
Choreographed to Sergei Prokofiev's score to Eisenstein's famous film on the same topic, this ballet in two acts, was premiered in Moscow in 1975 at the Bolshoi Theatre. Greeted with enthusiasm in the same year in New York, 
it continued its success with Western audiences, when Grigorovich was invited to stage Ivan the Terrible at the Paris OpÃ©ra in 1976, making it an essential part of the companyâ€™s repertoire. 

Recorded at the end of 2003, this production features in the title role the amazing star of the Paris Ballet, Nicolas Le Riche, one of the foremost dancers of today. Famous all over the world for his elegant strength, the beauty of his expression and the musicality of his movements, he has created leading roles for choreographers such as Rudolf Nureyev, Mats Ek and John Neumeier. 
As the the Czar Ivan he dances opposite Eleonora Abbagnato, his fellow dancer at the Paris Opera Ballet, whose highly refined dancing in the role of his wife Anastasia gives rise to great hopes for her future.
