Thanks for the awesomness that we may have otherwise missed out on.

,tkm0718,2011-04-19T04:55Z,"WOW!  Superb new collection!  I was starting to think 51 was the end of an era, but here's another superb collection...thank you!!

Stand out rarities (for me) include:  Velvascurge, Afterwords (would love to know more about them), Teepee (I can't find JACK about this release anywhere) and my FAV of them all is ""Across The Great Divide"" ... the vocals are great on that track and sound nothing like other Catch songs...cool stuff!!!

A HUGE thank you!!!"
,z-nith,2011-04-19T06:44Z,"For me, the toppers here are Standing In the Rain by the Cruize , Bangah-Every Wave, and Velvascurge-...In the Numbers"
,22ndWave,2011-04-20T05:29Z,"A stellar collection indeed. Can I put in a request for Burning Sun by East Of Java, Walkaway by Roaring Boys and Amazing Waves by Decode. 
Hope you can do it. NOBODY in the 80s blogging world seems to have these tracks. All the best and thank you for getting these hidden treasures out there, : D"

[V],80zforever,2011-04-22T18:15Z,"Welcome all. Hope you enjoy this.

22ndwave, I think I have Walkaway. If I am not wrong it was the b-side of House of Stones 7''. If I happen to locate it, I will rip it and will put it in the next vol. (of course if there would be one). I don't have that East of Java song. sorry dude."
,22ndWave,2011-04-23T08:32Z,"Thank you so much! I would be extremely grateful. It was the B-Side and nobody has it I swear. Shame about 'Burning Sun'. I'm at a loss as to who I can acquire it from as I have no technology to play or convert vinyls myself. Godspeed 80zforever and please, please, please make another volume!!! : D : D"
,fazenross,2011-04-25T07:21Z,"80z you are awesome. I am also a child of the 80s. I was wondering if you had anything by Darkroom, like ""Test of Time""?"
[V],80zforever,2011-04-25T07:30Z,"fazenross, see this link. i had posted it a while back. cheers

,Simon170468,2011-05-21T14:05Z,"Another awesome selection of quality forgotten 80s gems - you have put The Kingdoms - Heartland on - I recall the b'side - a track called stability was even better than this - any chance of posting it fella!!!! Also G.I Orange had an album, did well in Japan I think. Do you have it by any chance!!!! Keep up the great work you are a credit to the bay!!!!!"
,Simon170468,2011-05-21T14:09Z,"Great stuff fella - the b'side to Kingdoms track Heartland was called stability and was even better than this classic, can you please post. Also do you have G.I Orange album, did well in Japan. Keep up the fantastic work!!!!"
[V],80zforever,2011-05-27T09:33Z,"Hey Simon170468, I have posted GI Orange LP in one of the 4 rare 80s albums series but can't recall what vol. lol I think it's in the first 30 or so. I have got Kingdom's Stability. When I post vol 53, it would be there! cheers"
,Simon170468,2011-05-29T12:44Z,"Hi 80s me again, been through entire 80s albums posts n GI Orange not there.... Please help, oh.. and do you have the b'side of fight away the lover - GI Orange classic. Loved the b'side but cant remember its name - think it was every single day....Look forward to hearing stability - love that song!!! You are the best and I appreciate all you do...Many thanks."
,starrynight2011,2011-06-09T08:26Z,"Best ones I think are Story Structure - September Song, The Catch - Across The Great Divide, Shadow Show - Watch Me Dance Alone."
