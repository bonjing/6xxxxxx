,poffik,2011-04-16T08:31Z,i hope this is not corrupted like the one from megarelease...
,poffik,2011-04-16T09:49Z,"just finished downloading, and this one is corrupted too, audio is in slow motion, video freezes
no, this is not me, i tried it on my laptop too, same thing, bad release, wait for proper one, DO NOT DOWNLOAD - WASTE OF TIME"

poffik, learn about what you're downloading before making a COMPLETELY misleading comment on it. It doesn't play on either of your computers because they're not good enough to play HD video, and LOL so no wonder it plays bad for you. It plays -perfect- for me :].

It downloaded fine, and my review on it:

EXCELLENT QUALITY, better than most other torrents that claim to have HD video on it. The audio and video play right on time; awesome torrent ;]."
