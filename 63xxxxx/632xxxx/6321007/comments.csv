,Gustahelado,2011-04-16T10:17Z,Is this any good? how is the sound and Quality? 
,donate666,2011-04-16T10:46Z,Since it's released by eztv it's most likely perfect.
,maddy420,2011-04-16T16:26Z,why is this 1 over a gig when your asap 1 is less than 400 mb?
,agorwal,2011-04-16T18:56Z,I can't watch this on KM Player or windows media player classic and i got all codecs installed. I can watch any other 720p or 1080p mkv files including previous episodes of s06 but specifically not this one. Any ideas?
,ZaClR,2011-04-16T22:29Z,"Use VLC... It's free, it's easy to use and it plays almost any video file, if not all. I highly recommend sticking to it."
,fish121,2011-04-16T22:59Z,"Thanks!

A/V = 10

Plays in WMP, MPC and VLC perfectly."
,fish121,2011-04-16T23:04Z,"Try downloading CCCP (codec pack).

I can play almost any file in all 3 players I mentioned above. Otherwise just get VLC."
,Esthreel,2011-04-17T20:02Z,The sound is bad. it's like muffled. Video 10/10
,habsjuve,2011-04-18T00:41Z,"@agorwal Just convert to a MP4 by using by using a MKV to MP4 converter, then it will work."

,agorwal,2011-04-18T19:26Z,@habsjuve Thank you for your advice but ill watch this episode in 350mb format. I hate to look for converters that doesnt ask to register for full converting.
,xfreestylez3,2011-04-18T21:03Z,cnorkun its .mkv format so you would probably need a codec for it. If you want try VLC player its one of the best out there.
,agorwal,2011-04-20T14:42Z,"For those who cannot watch immerse version of this episode and still want to watch it in mkv ; type this into google and download it 

Supernatural.S06E17.My.Heart.Will.Go.On.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.AAC2.0.H264-SURFER"
,donate666,2011-04-21T21:03Z,"@Esthreel Supernatural has had really lousy sound all season. It's really weird that an othervice professional series suddenly can't get their sound right.
