"Total Madness is a 2009 compilation CD/DVD album by Madness. It is principally a singles collection, though it also includes two tracks from their debut LP, One Step Beyond.... On release in the UK it reached 11# in the Official Album Charts, making it Madness's 3rd hit album of 2009

Due to licensing problems, none of the four singles that Madness released on Zarjazz Records in 1985-6 are included.

The album effectively supersedes the now deleted Divine Madness collection. Total Madness should not be confused with the earlier US-only Total Madness - The Very Best of Madness."

The collection comprises a CD and DVD sold as a single package.
