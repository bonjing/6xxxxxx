,krozar,2011-04-18T17:05Z,pretty low resolutions since most people now have at least 1080. Can't really even seen what's going on it's so small and expanding just means artifact hell. Anyone know a watchable version?
[T],MelloYello,2011-04-18T20:14Z,This an mp4.  I watched it on my laptop and it looks fine. What size 1080p tv you trying to watch it on?  How does it look on your handheld? I put the source I got it from if you want to download a 550mb version go for it. I only upload small files.  If you don't like it don't download. I would love to see some of your encodings.  Where do you upload?
[T],MelloYello,2011-04-18T20:41Z,"@krozar  How did you search Game of Thrones and only come up with my torrent?  There are plenty of 550mb and 1.46gb torrents you didn't notice those? hmm  Kind of odd you didn't see them.  You said ""pretty low resolutions since most people now have at least 1080""   Most people aren't watching mp4's on a 50"" 1080p tv's and thinking they should have HD picture.  This is listed under HANDHELD in case you didn't notice.   Some people have slow internet connections and can't download huge files. Spag"
