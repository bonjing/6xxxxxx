Devlin Miski thought coming out on national TV would be the hardest part about being a gay football player. But it's when his press conference is over that the trouble really starts. The athletic tiger and his boyfriend Lee, a fox with a tongue as quick as his wit, still won't get many breaks in their fight for understanding. They'll need to deal with a stubborn reporter determined to get a story any way he can, furious parents, and hostile teammates--not to mention each other.

All's fair in love and war--and this is both.

Isolation Play is the eagerly awaited sequel to the best-selling novel Out of Position and picks up Dev and Lee's story about five minutes after the end of the first book. Well over a year and a half in the making, Isolation Play is the longest work Kyell Gold has released.

Warning: contains sexually explicit scenes. Not for underage readers.
