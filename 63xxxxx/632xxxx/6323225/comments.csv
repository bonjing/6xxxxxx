,BasilHoneycup,2011-04-26T09:21Z,@Matako46  Did you installed the Jeppview 0903 before updating the charts with these ? If not reinstall the whole lot and first install the 0903 cycle as published here on TPB

Follow the steps carefully my friend.
voilaaaaaaaaaaaa ;-)"
,glounk,2011-04-28T19:41Z,it is the cycle 901 not 903
,warloot24k,2011-04-29T03:06Z,"Yes, use cycle 09-01 instead of 09-03.  The license should work fine."
,matako46,2011-04-29T12:40Z,"Hi Guys, 
Yes I did install 0901 and changed the clock to Jan 10 2009  and installed the program and did the phone activation. Updated with the recent cycle 1108. worked fine for a few days and then have the message ""Jeppsen FliteDeck has stopped working. Windows will close the program."" Maybe something else I am not doing right. Thanks for the input Guys."
,raz0r2,2011-05-01T09:47Z,"Guys, there's a simple way to get flitestar navdata updates. It was mentioned long ago but not too many people saw it.

Basically, download MagicISO, load your navdata cycle ( labelled 1108JVGB_2.iso) and change the filename in MagicISO from 1108JVGB_2.iso to 1108FSFM_2.iso, save it, remount the new file, and VOILA, flitemap navdata updates.

:)"
