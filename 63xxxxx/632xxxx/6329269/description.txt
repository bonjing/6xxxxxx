Hello here are some splash screens i have made for my HTC HD2 ,
 if phone has been rooted and has hspl3 installed then all you need to do is power off phone unzip the splash screen you like
 and then power up phone while you hold down the volume down key this will take you to the rainbow boot loader
 ,then plug into pc and wait till phone says usb on screen and  then run the customRUU as ADMIN  in the splash screen folder
 follow allsteps or just check yes to all and let it install phone will reboot with new splash screen
,NOW if Phone is not unlocked / rooted then you will need to run thr HSPL3 to do this just put phone into the rainbow boot loader
 by powering off phone and then power up while holding down the volume down key  once in the rainbow boot loader
 plug into pc and wait till it says usb on phone then run the HSPL3 as ADMIN and pick the 2.08hspl option
 let it install the phone should say WE HACKED IT  on the screen if it doed you are good to go on installing a new splash screen .
