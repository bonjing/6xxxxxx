,hypn0t1c,2011-04-29T06:42Z,"ok where's ep. 5? IMDB says it aired on the 22nd, and it's completely absent from TPB?? What the hell is going on?"
,friendlyx3,2011-04-29T15:35Z,"I noticed the pixels sticking and then switching fast after, I'm not exactly sure what to call that in video terms. It happened in both KM & VLC. Going with Hornigold as his 1-3 were perfect.
Thanks anyway."
