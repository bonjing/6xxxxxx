This game is a lot of fun in a tactical sense, but couldn't they have hired one fucking Marine to give them the rundown on the service's particular linguistic habits? 

Buncha fuckstick POG's all up in there. "

,DragonXG,2011-06-15T00:30Z,"To capture the prototype (or retake a position) you must destroy all enemies in the immediate area.
Check buildings for troops and do a circular patrol for unseen enemies.

BTW, can anyone SAVE during a mission? The dialog keeps saying ""Wrong Name""."
