The Liturgy of The Pre-sanctified Gifts as practiced during lent in the Orthodox Church.  This is in English, and is done in the Russian plain chant style by the choir of St. Vladimir's Theological Seminery.  This is a cd rip, but the recording was badly mastered from a tape.  Hence the hiss and the low volume.  Even so it is a joy to listen to.
