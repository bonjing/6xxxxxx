,VoX1,2011-07-18T01:51Z,Stop with the Cinavia complaints. It's a bullshit Sony protection that fails as hard as their server security. Take the POS PS3 and throw it in the garbage. Comp games are superior anyway with real graphic cards. Buy a Boxee Box and stream cinavia all fucking day long. FUCK SONY. Burn in hell.
