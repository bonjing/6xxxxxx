,Wakojeko,2011-04-24T05:00Z,Is This Works On PSP 3000
,halvhjearne,2011-04-28T14:21Z,"this is NOT custom firmware ... a HEN for 6.38 has NOT been released yet ... this is proberbly just the official 6.38 firmware update, wich is free and safe to download from sonys own website or on the psp itself as well!"
,tikiko99,2011-04-29T22:18Z,"wow,why would you upload a torrent of an 6.38 official update,it doesn't make sense because we can download it from the PS website,there is a HEN for that version but Total_Noob won't release it

SO DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT,OR ELSE YOUR PSP WONT BE ABLE TO PLAY DOWNLOADED GAMES FROM TPB

IF YOU WANT CFW OR LCFW FOR 6.38 YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT SINCE 6.38-ME REV2 IS ONLY FOR 1000'S AND 2000'S HACKABLE MOTHERBOARDS"

I got a hold of another PSP and I have to update in stages.
And I need this one to get to 6.39 PRO."
