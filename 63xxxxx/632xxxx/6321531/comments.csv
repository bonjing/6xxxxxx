[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2011-04-17T04:11Z,"@shadman26
download power iso and burn the image to a DVD instead CD 
you will have no trouble with it then 
CDs are crap for burning operating systems on :)"

,iferhat,2011-04-19T07:50Z,"I HATE OS WITH TOO MUCH ADDED SHIT, IF U PPL R GONNA ADD SHIT ADD BASIC COMMONLY USED FOR OPTIMIZING OS UTILITIES LIKE; WINRAR 'COMPRESSING SHIT' 'UNLOCKER' 'ERASER'. THE REST WE CAN DOWNLOAD OURSELVES IF WE WANT.


"
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2011-04-19T12:38Z,"@iferhat, PLEASE DON'T BE ..., to logon here and see the content of this page, you needed flash player maybe java too, 
to play games downloaded from piratebay or run apps you need updated dx, vcredist, msxml, 

you've just mentioned the app added by me, that are NOT essential for windows to run, are third party app, such as: winrar and IDM... and omitted the one you really need either you like it or not.

They will ask you to be downloaded the first day of using this OS if I do not include them !
you are just the victim of the frustration of not giving you yourself the opportunity to install them, that's all. uninstall them and install them again ;)))))))))))))

but let me tell you what, you do not know what you need and how you need it, you and 2 thirds of those installing windows ;))) for example java it is installed but it is installed with automatic update disabled, and some other plugin disabled, not to consume your internet bandwith silently... this OS it is build with all you need but aiming both extreme stability and performance, touched all aspects that MS left as shit to alter your windows experience !  if do not like it, use your own. 
there is no thing in here added without a long analisys and experience, many of them are from MS itself: dx, net frame, ie, wmp, silverlight, capicom, msxml, all vcredist, old libraries,  the rest is very necessary and you cannot use any OS without them ! IDM and winrar add precious supoort right from the momment of your installation...you may need to open some archive... extract some shit, or download it from the net, a driver or so.. get that psychological frustration and complain elshwere I am not a shrink, I deal with computers only ;))) 
bye"
,Cokaric,2011-04-20T17:23Z,"Why is this one smaller than a previus version? Can you please add next time in description what have you removed and what have you added...

I managed to install this Win XP and all works great!!!

Im trying to take your win edit and make a version of my own - just taking out messenger, msn explorer, and keyboards/languages. But would also like to remove ""internet download manager"" only cause I plan to use windows for things other than browsing (its going on my macbook pro). 

after using NLite, i managed to remove everything but Internet Download Manager. Any ideas??
thanks for a great upload, the integration of silverlight, ie8, wmp11, flash, java is genius! and hope you reply"

,Garooza,2011-05-02T08:37Z,Do i need to format the hard drive this is going on?
,Garooza,2011-05-02T09:12Z,Noticed a few unanswered questions such as; DOES the hard Drive this is being put on need formatted or does it have repair utility.Also this seems like a stupid question(pointing out the only stupid question is an unasked one) but can you do auto updates if not can i do it through Microsoft update. i know normally you would absolutely NOT use auto update ...but I've seen some AMAZING things done here at TPB .  OH BTW MR CAPS LOCK. YOU could clearly see what programs were on this O.S. before you chose to download unless your and idiot just bashing on what you've read. either or if you so damn special why don't you come up with one better
,Garooza,2011-05-02T10:06Z,"In response to myself and others it states 
""Do not mount or start a fresh installation from any existing OS !"" 
Which leads me to believe NO to the repair possibility unless it does it's indescriptive you can go through the process and set your bios to read from cd drive if it doesn't then you'll know. I am doing this i will let you know the out come."

,thanna,2011-05-09T18:22Z,"i would just like to know,before i download this torrent...


what is the difference between this release (april 2011) from your previous release (mar 2011), aside from the dates?


what does this april version have that the march version doesn't have?

and personally,what do you think is better? because your march release doesn't have a single negative on it,while this one has 1 already."
,thebigmbg,2011-05-09T18:59Z,Help.. Will this be like the other torrent that maherz uploaded. no IE8 shortcut or this one is like default windows xp
,Dannieloco,2011-05-10T02:58Z,"this one has the IE icon on the desktop and it can be deleted. 

and some apps installed on this windows are slightly differerent than the March update. Aside from that, theyre pretty much the same thing, some ppl NEED to have the latest updated windows, so this would be it"
,thanna,2011-05-11T19:18Z,"so which one is more stable and safer to use?

the march version or the april version?"
,Dannieloco,2011-05-12T08:25Z,"Theyre both stable. Its just one is more current with updates. If you're anal about having the latest, get April or May's edit otherwise March's should be fine. For the most part, theyre pretty much all the same. and you can always use windows update to update your windows once installed"
