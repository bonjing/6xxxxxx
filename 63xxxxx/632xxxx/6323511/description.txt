All four volumes of Vassilis Hadjinicolaou's Vespers, chanted in English, and in Byzantine chant.  The first track on each cd, Psalm 103, is the same on all four cds.  Other tracks, like "Lord I have cried" are lyrically the same, but are sung in different modes.  Otherwise, the stychera, doxastica, appostycha, and appolitychia are different for each tone.  A must have for any lover of chant.  Enjoy!
