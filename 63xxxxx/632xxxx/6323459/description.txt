plot

Three boys, Jimmy Markum, Sean Devine, and Dave Boyle, play hockey in a Boston street in 1975. A car pulls up and a man pretending to be a police officer gets out, and tells Dave to get in the car. He is held in a basement and abused by two child molesters. Four days later, he escapes.
Twenty-five years later, the boys are now grown and still living in Boston. Jimmy is an ex-con running a neighborhood store, while Dave is a blue-collar worker, still haunted by his abduction. The two are still neighbors and related by marriage. Jimmy's 19 year old daughter Katie is secretly dating Brendan Harris, a boy Jimmy despises. She and Brendan are planning on eloping to marry in Las Vegas.
