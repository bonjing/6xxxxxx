And up for offer here is 5 years of Confurence Convention Hand Books, that were given out at these furry Conventions.  Inside is some "lost" furry art, some of it very old and most of it did not make it on to the internet.  So here it is, and finally on the internet for your enjoyment.

The books in this torrent:

Confurence  6 (1995)

Confurence  7 (1996)

Confurence  8 (1997)

Confurence  9 (1998)

Confurence 10 (1999)

Some of these have a bit of water damage, I'm sorry about that but they're very old and I guess i just didn't care for them properly at one point in the past.  But now they're converted to digital before they deteriorate completely.

The artwork inside is still visible, as well as the text on the pages, it's mostly just the covers that are damaged.

Also for those of you that might want to come in here and leave comments saying "OMG THIS TORRENT HAS A VIRUS!" I've included a *.PNG file with a date view where I scanned the entire contents with Avast! 5.xx Pro, at the time of submitting this, showing that it's 100% clean.

Also, all of these files are indiviual Jpegs, so if you wish to inspect the quality, or what this actually is, you can manually download individual files instead of the whole thing.
