Some help please .. Mahalo."
[T],EvolGamer,2011-04-18T18:06Z,No Sorry But To My Understanding Thats Not Possible. But I Think You Can Do That With DVDRs And Just Burn It To A DVD. But Other Than That I Cant Help You.
,whylert,2011-04-18T23:55Z,"Like Barack Obama says ""Yes We Can""

If you have a Mac it's so easy and  FREE

Download and install a program called BURN 
that will convert it into DVD format and burn it to a DVD-R.

A PC is a little more complicated download a program called CONVERTXTODVD.

CONVERTXTODVD is Not FREE though.

I hope this helps you."

This movie sounds interesting I'm gonna check it out. Thanks."
