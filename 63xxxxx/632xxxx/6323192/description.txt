Villagers are celebrating Record Store Day on April 16 with the limited-edition vinyl release through Domino of Live At The Workmanâ€™s Club.

Culled from the set they played in the D2 venue last September as part of a Today FM Paul McLoone Show outside broadcast, it features â€˜Ship Of Promisesâ€™, â€˜The Meaning Of The Ritualâ€™, â€˜Twenty-Seven Strangersâ€™, â€˜On A Sunlit Stageâ€™, â€˜Set The Tigers Freeâ€™, â€˜Becoming A Jackalâ€™, â€˜In A New Found Land You Are Freeâ€™, â€˜Piecesâ€™, â€˜To Be Counted Among Menâ€™, â€˜The Pact (Iâ€™ll Be Your Fever)â€™ and â€˜Homeâ€™.

Hands on sort of a guy that he is, Conor J. designed the rather fetching cover himself.
