In this clip, Dawkins patiently outlines the history of homeopathy and pours a lot of cold water over its efficacy. He sympathetically visits a modern British Health service facility and finds good medicine being practiced but cannot find any evidence that medicines being prescribed  have the slightest effect. But still homeopathy is supported by a large minority of the public and goes untested despite the danger of treating serious illnesses with it.

Erica Johnson investigates one of the country's fastest growing alternative health treatments: homeopathy. Ontario homeopaths are about to become the first province in Canada to regulate homeopathy â€” lending credibility to this unproven practice.

Canada's leading consumer ally takes a long hard look at the theories, and the remedies. For the first time in Canada, we conduct a test of homeopathic medicines, investigating the science behind these so-called medicines. 

In light of our results, we ask both the Ontario government and Health Canada why they are lending credibility to the homeopathic industry. Johnson also meets up with a rep from the world's leading manufacturer of homeopathic medicines, who admits that even the company says how homeopathy works is a mystery.

Perhaps most disturbing we learn that some homeopaths are treating cancer patients with homeopathic remedies. Check out the 1260 replies to this topic at http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/2011/cureorcon/
