This is a must have for die hard Nirvana and Kurt Cobain fans. This is a 1985 demo for Kurt Cobains early band called Fecal Matter. It is super rare and is an early look at songs like Spank Thru and Downer

Band: Fecal Matter (AKA Kurts first band)
Demo Name: Illiteracy Will Prevail
Format: MP3
Bitrate: 320kbps



This is a demo and was originally recorded on a cassette so excuse the quality. Some of the songs don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have names and are labeled Unknown but I have labeled what I know and have included the hand written cover

Enjoy, Comment and Seed!
