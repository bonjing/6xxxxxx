i'm not questioning your power i simply admire it 
keep doing what you do best...

Originally, the cover date was supposed to be the date that the magazine would be *removed* from sale, but publichers began dating their magazines further and further ahead, in an attempt to get longer on the stands.

At one time US comic were dated four months ahead..."
