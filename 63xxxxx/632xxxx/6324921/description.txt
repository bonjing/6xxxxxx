Stuart, Vince and Nathan are back for one last wild, outrageous adventure on Canal Street.  But amongst the fabulous nights out, the one night stands, the clubbing, all is not well.  Someone's trying to blackmail Stuart Jones (Aidan Gillen).  Stuart is no one's victim.  Now he's out for revenge.  Big time!

As Stuart fights back, Vince (Craig Kelly) is facing a dilemma.  Stuart's revenge is taking him on the wrong side of the law and could even get someone killed.  Just when it seems that they might finally get together, Vince thinks Stuart's gone too far.

Will Nathan (Charlie Hunnam) ever get over Stuart?  Will Vince ever get his man?  Can Stuart ever be stopped?  In this witty, exciting drama, only one thing is for sure: No straight person is ever going to call a gay boy 'queer' again...
