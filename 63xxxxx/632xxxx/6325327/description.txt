While working with the UN Forces in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, Marine Sgt. Brandon Beckett (Chad Michael
Collins), son of renowned sniper Thomas Beckett, receives
orders to rescue a European farmer trapped in the middle of
hostile rebel territory. When he and his men arrive at the
farm, a mysterious sniper ambushes them, wounding Beckett
and killing everyone else. With the help of his fathers former
protÃ©gÃ©, sniper instructor Richard Miller (Billy Zane), Beckett

before the sniper returns to finish the job. On top of this he
must also track down the one who is giving the orders and
