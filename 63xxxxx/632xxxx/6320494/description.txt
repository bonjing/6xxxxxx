Overview

Do you remember how trouble-free and fast your new PC was?
Regain some of that performance by updating the WindowsÂ® registry with the Ashampoo Registry Cleaner.

The WindowsÂ® registry is, in a way, the administrative center of your system. Different settings and configuration data for WindowsÂ® and most of your programâ€™s settings, like for example autostart settings, are saved there. Over time errors creep in the registry. One result is that your PC will become slower, e.g. when starting the system. Problems when uninstalling software and a large number of error messages could point to problems in the WindowsÂ® registry. 

With the Ashampoo Registry Cleaner you will easily and safely delete redundant or damaged registry entries. Faulty links in the registry are also repaired. The real-time backup in the Ashampoo Registry Cleaner offers a maximum of safety and enables the restoring of the windowsÂ® registry into its original status anytime. 

Youâ€™ll be amazed how the Ashampoo Registry Cleaner will quickly and easily improve the performance of your PC!
