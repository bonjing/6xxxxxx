Info About Moon Secure

Moon Secure AV is an opensource antivirus currently using the clamav engine due to 

fast response time and huge AV database, however we are implementing another 

engine that is heuristic and will allow users to customize the engine on the fly. 

Unlike clam it has an enterprise level real-time scanner. It is built for windows 

and will run on XP and vista. It can scan portable drives and fixed drives. It is 

able to detect viruses, Trojans and spyware.

Our vision is to release an enterprise level antivirus, which can be used in any 

windows environment.

The aim is to provide a superior antivirus capable with competing with the market 

leaders and still at the same price, free!


We aim to be part of an opensource â€œsuiteâ€ which will allow all users to still use 

the environment they are comfortable with but benefit from the terrific opensource 

community.

Don't Forget To Seed it!
