,LizAndShadow572257,2011-05-31T06:04Z,"I'm not sure how much help i'll be but at least ill be the first one to try- i just got mine to work. bad news first- the black screen. the game, dispite being new, wasnt made to work with windows seven. Spore was the same way. I had a legal copy(then trien less legal ones) and even going back to vista it only ever did the black screen on my old comp. As for the crack- after installing go into computer right click on game then hit explore. Its there ull find the folder. idk if thats the problem but that confuzed me a bit."

,LizAndShadow572257,2011-05-31T06:09Z,"opps commented twice. for those who get the game to work it has some errors. When it tells you to move the animal theres no ""ok"" click the hand thing- it was in the left hand corner for me- its not in the sqare with all the animals info. 2it takes it forever for it to decide uve done what the tutorial has asked... just explore for a bit and it will eventualy get back to you"
