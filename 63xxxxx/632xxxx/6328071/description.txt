Even for metal purists such as myself, CFTG's unique blend of multiple genres into a deathcore vibe just fucking WORKS. Seriously, CFTG is like NOTHING I have ever heard in my life. I created a profile on TBP just for the purpose of spreading the word that Satan has finally returned...in the form of CFTG. 

More pure metal torrents to come, seed motherfuckers!
