This is the complete kids in the hall ripped directly from the region 1 a&e "complete series megaset" and encoded in ipod video format.

these are at 320x240 in iPod format (playable on iPhone and iPad too) with chapter markers.  Encoded with HandBrakeCLI.

The pilot is missing because this is not included in the box set (false advertising by a&e?), but a lot of the pilot was used in season 1 episode 20

Seasons 4 and 5 have bleeps instead of naughty words.  Do uncensored versions of these seasons exist or did CBS keep everything clean when they took over?

Seasons 1 - 3 are the completely uncensored hbo version.

I haven't included all the dvd extras in this torrent because i haven't encoded it for my ipod yet.
