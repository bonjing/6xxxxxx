,rippervanwinkle,2011-07-03T12:36Z,"This is an excellent quality rip. I was surprised at the overly saturated colours as this is usually the result of way too much denoising and sharpening in small file size BDRips.  However in this case the Blu-Ray is actually like that, see this review at http://blubrew.com/2011/02/11/rain-man/ 

[quote]VIDEO QUALITY

Below average to plain bad. It is hard to find any distinctively positive aspects about Rain Manâ€™s debut on blu-ray. An outdated master has been used for this release, and it shows. The transfer sports an varying amount of sharpening, occasional video noise (not grain) and is overall lacking in definition. Colours often look unnaturally over-saturated, and contrast tends to run hot.

Not all is awful as the first half of the film looks somewhat acceptable with scenes looking decent and mildly natural (if you can look past the ringing), the second half of the film, however, inexplicably displays some truly intrusive digital tampering. Textures become profoundly waxy and smeary, and the picture becomes simply unpleasant to look at (here, here and here for example). Especially darker scenes seem to have been selectively degrained, most notably during the casino-interiors towards the end of the film.[/quote]

So this rip is indeed a faithful rendering, which is as much as one can ask.

Thanks to the releaser."
