,shasham,2011-04-23T12:16Z,Thank you so much. I'll seed at least 1/1. Cheers!
,laned130,2011-11-25T20:43Z,"@Shasham, thank you for your generosity! ;-)
IMHO you should be seeding everything you dl to at least 110%, just to cover your dl, and protocol overheads, etc. Personally, it's unusual for me to seed anything less than 250%.
If you're finding you dl too much and can't upload enough to cover it, then you could always rent a seedbox - they're really very cheap, and have all sorts of added benefits! My ISP used to give me 100kbps up, but now I don't get much over 50, and it's often down to 25. I can still up over 3GB/day, but I'm thinking of getting a seedbox anyway, and sharing it with my sis."

A/V/M: 9/9/8

Extremely informative film (movie), showing great insight, with lots of ideas. And it's always nice to know that our (UK) education system could be worse ;-)"
