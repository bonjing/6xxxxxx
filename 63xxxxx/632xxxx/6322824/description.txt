by bounty hunters calming the bounty on his head, Riddick arrives on the 
colonized planet New Mecca, he learns Imam placed the bounty on his head 
and Jack has been imprisoned on the prison planet "Crematoria" for murder. 
Riddick learns from Aereon, ambassador of the Elemental race is seeking 
out Furians, a race of warriors in a bid to balance the universe, as a 
warrior army known as The Necromongers led by the evil undead Lord Marshal

New Mecca, Riddick is captured by cocky bounty hunter Toombs and his 
crew and he is transported to Crematoria, where he reunites with Jack 
now named 'Kyra', where Riddick and Kyra escapes to the planet's sun 
ravaged surface, where Riddick helped by Necromonger warrior Vakko
