,mellowmaster,2011-04-26T17:57Z,This plain does not work for the latest version of R2. Sucks balls man big time. You cannot get the damn thing to move. 
,vipin91,2011-04-27T13:38Z,@mellowmaster: dude uncheck the simple control checkbox in settings of your railworks then it ll work ;)
,mellowmaster,2011-05-09T01:09Z,"@vipin91: Nope, everything works but accelerate. let me be specific, the acceleration lever moves but the train doesn't and no sound effect either. I have tried everything it does not work for me. "

Getting the 156 to move isn't exactly easy at first. There's a handful of things you need to do.  First off move the brake handle to off, click the switch to turn off tail lights, turn on marker lights. Next move the reverser to forward, and press the alerter to shut up the buzzer. Once that is done, press to forward again as sometimes it will reset. Check that your brakes are released, pull the control stick back to position five till you get moving, then seven to top speed.
