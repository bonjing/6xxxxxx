This torrent contains a complete Dream Theater studio discography, in FLAC quality + 3 official bootlegs and the 4 cover albums.

Sources: FLACs come from either variousor from my own rips (Black Clouds & Silver Linings, Train of Though, Made in Japan, Once in a Livetime). I have transcoded every lossless file with the highest FLAC quality, thus wasting more cpu cycles, for the sake of lower file sizes. I did not scan any artwork, it's merely collected.

File naming scheme: (year - album/track - date), suitable even for cheap music players. Every album contains artwork (cover.jpg at the very least). Artwork was also reduced to a decent file size. I have also removed all the useless extra crap (nfo, m3u, txt, log) and converted complete disc rips to one track per file storage scheme, thus removing the cue sheets too. I like my music folders clean and my stuff organized.

What's missing?
lives - live at the marquee, scroe, chaos in motion - couldn't find them
official bootlegs - pretty much everything except the 4 cover albums (metallica, maiden, purple, floyd)
