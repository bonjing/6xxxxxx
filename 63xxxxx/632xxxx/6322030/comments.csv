,Shoobox,2011-04-19T03:03Z,"great quality as always 3li,
but files are starting to get a little to big for me."
,banman,2011-04-20T01:23Z,"How the fuck can I enjoy it when this crap won`t even play!!? I have downloaded hundreds of movies and films and this is the first that won`t play on my Lg player. Can`t you just use the same apps to make your files as everybody else? What a waste of time and effort to download this piece of shit.
But thanks anyway"
,hauntnut,2011-04-20T09:06Z,"@ banman: Seriously, dude, get over yourself. Not every uploader is going to email you to ask what your player is to ensure playback, so grow the fuck up. It's The Pirate Bay; no guarantees on anything. 

@ the Uploader: Thanks for this file. This is the best HD version of this film available anywhere. Looks and sounds just great, and plays just fine on my computer!"
,Shoobox,2011-04-20T16:11Z,"@banman

,-Cortex-,2011-04-23T19:18Z,"""correction not bR rip but hq rip

What's an 'HQ rip'? You're correcting people when you've got no idea what you're on about.

This is an encode sourced from an encode of a DTheater."
,Shoobox,2011-04-24T05:05Z,"@-Cortex-
you took a stupid pill didn't you,
i was correcting myself.
and for your info retard 

Dtheater is: High Definition Pre-Recorded Videotape"

,Shoobox,2011-05-05T22:32Z,"definitely would like to get a copy of the 
LOTR extended version"
,HorrorFuckShitass,2011-05-07T16:56Z,Why is this movie 4.39 GiB? ill just download the other one that is half the size. 
,dwnldthis,2011-05-14T23:59Z,thank you
,-Cortex-,2011-05-19T18:56Z,"@Shoobox:

LOL. DTheater isn't even necessarily high definition, it can store 480p, 720p and 1080i.

You said this is an 'HQ rip', that doesn't mean anything. It's a re-encode of a file which was sourced from a D-Theater. As you said, it's not from BluRay, but ""HQ"" doesn't mean anything."
,Shoobox,2011-05-20T19:40Z,"@-Cortex-
moron
do more research idiot.
this D-Theater which i was referring too is hd d-theater at 1280x544.
next time before you start back peddling get your info straight.

simply an idiot you are.


The ""D"" in D-VHS originally stood for Data VHS, but with the expansion of the format from standard definition to high definition capability.

D-VHS had a maximum bandwidth of 28 Mbps, it was limited to 720p/1080i MPEG-2 video encodings,  and most titles had a 576 Kbps Dolby Digital audio track

once again @-Cortex-
simply moron!!"
,est1987,2011-05-23T20:46Z,"@banman: Appreciate the fact that it's even here for you to download. Do yourself a favor, stfu and upgrade your video players. VLC works fine. Google it."
,-Cortex-,2011-05-26T15:40Z,"Gotta love Shoobox! :D

""this D-Theater which i was referring too is hd d-theater at 1280x544.""
I never said True Lies wasn't a high definition transfer on D-Theater, just that D-Theatre isn't ""High Definition Pre-Recorded Videotape"".
True Lies was actually 1080i presentation on D-Theater, which is not 1280*544 as you state.

""next time before you start back peddling get your info straight.""
I didn't back pedal, I was correcting you over the definition of D-Theater (see above) but you've corrected yourself. Nothing I said was incorrect, if you believe it is, quote it, rather than rattling off meaningless statements.

Yes, I can read specs thank you.


You still never explained your made up ""HQ Rip"" standard. This all started because you said ""HQ rip"" which is not a thing, I just wanted to correct in order to avoid confusion for others. All you've done is twisted some very clear, explicit statements because you don't like being shown up."
,Shoobox,2011-05-27T16:30Z,"-Cortex-
you a complete moron
do you really need someone to explain HQ ?
""HIGH QUALITY""
Are you really that retarded?

HQ over normal DVD
HQ for video quality over DVD
HQ for the format of the video in which 3LI uploaded ""referencing his movies always HQ.
 any 6 year old on youtube videos could tell you that. 

Once again correcting you
      ""HQ rip"" is a thing.

As far as being shown up lmao
you tried to spamn my post first by thinking I was correcting someone else when i was correcting myself.
so next time read before trying to be as dumb as your post show,
now stop back peddling and leave the post comments to us big boys little girl."
,soldierofthelam,2011-05-27T17:53Z,"""HA HA Shoobox :)""

-Cortex- 
 What in the world makes you think there is no such thing as HQ?
you must be one of those guys who went to college and got a masters and 7 years later cleaning Don Johns. 
The shit your piling up in your mouth is getting full!  ;o
Everybody knows the meaning of the term HQ ""High Quality""

@3LI
thanks for all the HQ work and keep it up mate.
"
,soldierofthelam,2011-05-27T18:07Z,"@cortex
oh yea to correct you since you def do not read buddy 

its says right in the info file of the torrent
the source was 
*Source/File Size..........: DTheater 720p=8.12 GB

NOT
""True Lies was actually 1080i presentation on D-Theater, which is not 1280*544 as you state.""

So shoobox got the res mixed up with 1080i.

1080i is the shorthand name for a high-definition.
The i means interlaced; 1080i differs from 1080p, in which the p stands for progressive scan.


Hu that's funny,
  1080i is the shorthand name for a high-definition as posted in the torrent info!

so depending on what type of tv you have,
  would reflect hoe you can watch it from standard to HD.
 Which by all means 1080i is a Higher quality from normal quality viewing.


""format from standard definition to high definition capability.""
