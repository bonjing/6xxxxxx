Monty Python's The Meaning of Life: Special Edition

1983 R

The no-holds-barred Pythons explore the various facets of life -- from procreation to the clang of a death knell -- in their typical irreverent fashion, proclaiming "Every sperm is sacred." (Or didn't you know?) Darker and more disturbing than other Monty Python fare, the film follows a sketch comedy format and includes highlights such as the heave-inducing "world's biggest glutton" skit featuring John Cleese and Terry Jones.
