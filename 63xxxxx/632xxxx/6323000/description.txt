Episode 6

With the main suspect due to be released and an alarming number of procedural blunders stacking up on the record, Captain Berthaud's team is now on the back foot. When Judge Roban transfers the case to the Crime Squad, Laure's reaction is surprising, but she remains doggedly determined to catch her killer.

Meanwhile, Gilou is in trouble. A victorious Josephine Karlsson finds no time to gloat, as shady past connections return to haunt her. Judge Roban realises the extent of his brother's involvement in the Villdieu bribery case.
