,xXxFamouusxXx,2011-07-13T01:05Z,"for Felli_Fel ( sorry for my bad english ) 

1- You need a DL DVD ( DL for Double-Layer ) So a dvd with 8.5gb capacity 

2- you need ImgBurn ( free on internet ) Its a software for burn ISO ( iso is the format of the game ) 

3-You need Utorrent ( free ) ( to download the torrent ) 

4- Maybe you will need WinRar ( free to ) if the file is compress 

( after you got all the software ) 

1- download the Torrent ( file on this page ) 

2- Clic on the torrent ( where the torrent is save or in your list of download ) 

3- let the download go ( is can be long or not depend about your internet and how much person seed 

4-after the download is finish you need to decompress ( with WinRar ) 

5- after that you will have a Iso file and a dvdfile 

6 - iso will be 7.3gb and dvdfile 1ko 

7- Be sure that the dvdfile have the same name that iso file ! 

8-after open your ImgBurn and go to write image file to dosc 

9-go to tools ( in the top ) / setting / write / 

10- now you will see Layer break 

11- select user specified and write in the box 1913760

12-clic ok and select the DVDFILE NOT THE ISO 

13- put a 8.5gb dvd DL in your pc 

14-select 2.4x to burn 

I hope i help you 

Enjoy it ! "
