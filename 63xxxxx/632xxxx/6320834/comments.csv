you`ve uploaded harry potter 7 dvd9 as well as 720 brrip
If I want to watch it on my PC which is the best to watch great result
and what is the difference between the quality of an original dvd9 of size 7.5 gb and 720p brrip of size 7.5 gb if they both are released at the same time? (like LOTR dvd released in 2001 and br would release in 2011, there must be a difference)
would there be max difference or min?
thanks for your reply"
