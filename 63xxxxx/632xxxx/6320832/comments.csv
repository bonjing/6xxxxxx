,SLAiN121,2011-04-17T00:56Z,"poogle-moogle2 is hear for no other reason than to piss people off, most of the time he comments that the file is fake when it's not, this time he's trying to trick the uploader into thinking that we are all a bunch of ungratefull pricks.... axxo left the scene because of coments like this.... my guess is that he works for the riaa or the mpaa or whatever it's called...  eather that or he's an artist or a movie maker or some shit, that had his lifes work uploaded hear and everyone stole it.... if thats the case i hope it hurt. "
,Ricochet150,2011-04-17T15:51Z,"How about letting people know what the quality of the movie is like, maybe if we're lucky a quick sentence of what you thought of the movie?
It's obvious poogle-moogle2 is a dope, we don't need everyone to comment on that!! "
,blueblood95,2011-04-17T16:22Z,"@poogle-moogle2 your dad should've squirted the cum that produced you into the back seat of the car, and your mom should;ve then used a tissue to rub away any trace of you, you fuckhead cunt."
,Darkoil,2011-04-17T16:40Z,"@ poogle-moogle2 
You retarded disrespectful little cunt. "
,Neo_aeoN,2011-04-17T17:24Z,Obviously poogle-moogle2 wants this to go down. If he was a regular cock socket like the other ungrates he wouldn't have decent grammar skills. Anyone with half a brain wouldn't bother so he wins just like Bieber haters that go to his page to tell him.
,AloneInDaDark,2011-04-17T18:44Z,poogle-moogle2  اأنت فتااااااااااااااااال
,angles69,2011-04-17T18:59Z,"hahahahaha, poogle-moogle got raped xD "
,kaushalmania,2011-04-17T19:13Z,"Worst Movie I have Seen for a long time.
A:V = good
Dont waste your time downloading
M = 0 at best"
,criminal4hire,2011-04-17T22:38Z,"HA HA i gotta laugh when i read poogles comment i thought instantly of a being with extremely low intellect but after reading the responses i believe he got what he deserved you guys probably made him go get a different name after that ass reaming, better invest in some lube little buddy. But honestly assholes like that scare decent folk away from these movies so keep up the good work checking in the h8ters as for the movie i would definitely say B LIST QUALITY"
,DoABackflip,2011-04-18T04:17Z,the trailer for this made me want to scratch my eyes out with steel wool
,ayan_ali,2011-04-18T12:18Z,plz some body gives me a good horor movies link like wrong turn and hills have eyes like that
,mesays,2011-04-18T21:06Z,"the acting is not quite as good as what you might see in an elementary school play, but if you can get past the dreadful acting, the movie is even worse, this is quite easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen, I forced myself to sit through the entire thing, insisting to myself it has to get better...it didn't.  You know it's bad when you're in your own home and you still want to storm out.  The movie was free and I still feel like I got ripped off. "
,scottsasse,2011-04-19T02:08Z,"Reading all the comments from people trashin' on ""poogle-moogle2"" is almost as creative and entertaining as the movie itself!! THANKS Chris and all you seeders out there!! A/v=great. Love, DrScott"
,bryentheartist,2011-08-06T22:28Z,thanks baby
,LEERV,2011-08-25T01:27Z,So I finally sat and watched this movie (I use the term loosely). I've had it for ages. The rip was great so thanks for the upload. I just wish you hadn't bothered. That's 1 1/2 hrs I'm never getting back. What a piece of shit. I'm off to drink a bottle of bleach. Bye cruel world.....
