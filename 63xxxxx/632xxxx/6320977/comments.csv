I have tried to install, but I think that I did something wrong on some step. 

Is there any way to install Smoke removing everything, including its serial number?"

This has happened with both Smoke and Maya. I think it's telling that there needs to be an additional terminal command to activate into the patches."

It worked fine on my friend's mac pro but not for me we used the same method in the installation.

I have installed it in my mac pro and after successful installation Smoke wont lunch.  Any idea why is this happening?"
