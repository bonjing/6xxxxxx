@ Stun

could you help me out with how to unpack this, do we have to unpack every folder? TIA for any help"
,rocu2,2011-04-19T15:34Z,"The keygen seems to be producing wrong serials, it keeps giving me the red X of doom rather than the green tick of happiness...

If anyone has any success then please share your results, Thanks"
,mmorris71203,2011-04-29T06:32Z,"The serials worked for me first try.  You will need to unzip each zipped folder. Each unzip feeds off of another zipped file, so start with the first one, and when it asks for the next in the sequence, browse for that file, and so on and so forth until the extraction process is complete.  The notes should explain the rest.  Good Luck!"
,rocu2,2011-04-30T00:44Z,"Thanks for the feedback, at least we know it works now.......

I think my problem is i don't even get as far as the plugin starting up, i just get a box saying that my trial period is up, with a clickable link to purchase a license......there must be something left in my computer which isn't allowing the plugin to start...... so damn annoying...

i get the option to input a serial but they're all producing blanks"

,oscarx,2011-08-15T23:37Z,"All works fine. First unzipped all. Then unrared all. Then used keygen to generate key. Then patched the configuration.ini file... and then chose the ""other registration methods"" option and pasted in the authorisation code. All clearly explained in provided instruction file. "
,uvibajaj,2011-08-17T01:36Z,"Guys please Help: There is no option as ""other registration methods"" I just get ""Activate"" or ""Continue Trial"". It accepts the License Code from the keygen but the internet activation fails (error 102).

PS: I tried Registering without changing the confg.ini because I couldn't find the confg.ini file earlier...Is that the reasons I'm facing this?"
,usmc85,2011-10-30T21:50Z,"uvibajaj - Yes instructions say you have to edit the config file.

HOWEVER, I can't get this to work either. I get it to take the license code, but the serial it generates gets me to a RED X.  I cant get any further. Any suggestions??"
,usmc85,2011-10-30T22:24Z,"Ahhh Works great, operator error. Make sure you FTFM. Go to (C:\program files (x86)\adobe\photoshop cs5\plug-ins\alien skin\) to change config file.  There is a config file in (C:\program files (x86)\alien skin\) too and I was trying to change that. Nice upload guy."
,illest,2011-11-10T09:02Z,Anyone have a CORE keygen generator? Windows 7 refuses to allow me to open the keygen generator provided in this torrent.
,FCKU4Free,2012-02-14T22:32Z,Does not work on Windows 7 64-bit. Followed the instructions and still get the red X of death. This sucks! Any help??
