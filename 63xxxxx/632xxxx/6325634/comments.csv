,pariahdog,2011-04-18T12:22Z,I can't get any of these 720p the killing torrents to download the normal way. Neither Vuze nor utorrent can connect to any trackers.The only way I can get it to work is by using the magnet link and the download is painfully slow: less than 20 KB/sec. At this rate it will take nearly 24 hours to download a 1 gig file. 
,azureusism,2011-04-18T14:23Z,Using utorrent and everything okay.
,azureusism,2011-04-18T14:24Z,Oh yeah thanks to uploader
,Sheldon131,2011-04-18T20:45Z,I wish for some single links...
