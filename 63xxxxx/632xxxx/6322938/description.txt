Before downloading the whole you can only download the sample video of 2.30 minutes from torrent content;which is placed to check the nearby quality. The sample is encoded in Xvid but original file is much better as that\\\\\\\'ll be in MPEG2/VOB.

To get best viewing experience on PC:
1. Make sure you are using Power DVD 8 onwards version. As that will enhance Dolby Digital based sound. Otherwise low audio/sound output might happen.
2. While playback on WMP/Real make sure you\'ve all MPEG2 Codec/DVD video plug ins are installed correctly. Otherwise low sound & malfunctioning Menu can occurs due to mismatched codecs/software.

Regarding Download: I'll be available daily for a few hours. So high speed down-loaders are first welcome. Try to upload also to other peers. This huge file will complete download after a weeks or long. So be patient & continue uploading. If you are not capable to download for along period then don't start downloading until 2-3 seeders are available on this torrent. If others don't upload it then it'll be dead within a few months.I'm not gonna upload it for life-long. So if you like it,then seed it.

I'll appreciate any comments from you. Unless faster seeding request will be not possible so don\'t ask for that. You can upload from me at a fair good speed of 50 Kbps if your ISP & the swarm allows.
