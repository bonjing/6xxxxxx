Is there any chance you could upload disc 2 (with the last two episodes) ?"

Although if I found a good source ;I'll try.
Thanks for your appreciation.

If you like keep seeding, at least when you feel there is low number of seeders are present.
If you seed this then only I can concentrate on a new upload."

I was thinking, perhaps it's still possible to extract the episodes only (meaning, only the menus etc... might be corrupted so extracting the episodes only might work). If you'd like to give it another go, you could try DVDFab8 for example, it's free and seems to do the job pretty well..."
,Sonel,2011-05-18T23:11Z,I usually used that software & it's terminated with error. The menu portion is not corrupted essential .VOB corrupted.
