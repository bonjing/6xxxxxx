,FelchME,2011-04-16T14:24Z,Is this the sequel to Dawsons Creek?
,thunderx7,2011-04-16T17:23Z,"@FelchMe: That's why I've never watched it. When I saw Pacey is in it, I didn't bother. Can someone tell me what Fringe is all about???"
,Simnos,2011-04-16T18:00Z,"@ thunderx7 and FelchME:

This show like a funnier, quirkier version of the X-Files. They investigate crimes and strange occurrences every episode, but the show has a longer and more intense story arc that it follows. It's actually really entertaining and well acted (and not at all like Dawson's Creek if that's what you're worried about)."
,Eiriknorge54,2011-04-16T18:03Z,Heyyy
,DickDickstein,2011-04-16T18:26Z,"This might be the best episode in the series. LSD, zombies, cartoons. You name it. "
,bipolarx,2011-04-16T18:42Z,"Love you eztv. I always know when the ep is on in America- it will be on here by the following day. Who needs cable, when all you need is a laptop, wireless and eztv!"
,bipolarx,2011-04-16T18:43Z,"And I agree, this was the trippiest episode to date. Wasn't ironic they were all on LSD. Great stuff. Love this show!"
,Sanic7,2011-04-17T06:35Z,"***spoiler alert***

I didnt like the cartoons so much I think it took away from the episode or at least it would have been better Japanese anime version then cgi.

Love the show and series cant wait till next episode!"
