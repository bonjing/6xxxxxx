,parallelshift42,2011-05-12T21:25Z,"problem: activation page is blank

i've done this with each ADesk product for the last 4 years. Always the same, always easy, always works. Not this time. I follow all the steps to the letter. When the activation page pops up, all it shows are two selection circles, no text or even text boxes. I copied the file location, opened in browser. Still only shows the 2 selection circles, plus descriptions. No enter fields, no continue, nothin. I'm confident that there's just a step missing or something.

Help...?"
