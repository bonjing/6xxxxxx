,.SkullCroc.,2011-10-07T01:27Z,Why are there around TWENTY .iso files??? Do we have to burn each and every one of these?
,Persure1,2011-10-08T00:24Z,i installed this game then finally when it goes to the main menu of it it just closes and it goes back to my desktop any1 how to solve this problem is there like a patch or something i have to download?
,nob14,2011-10-20T18:12Z,you need to block all the .exes with the firewall in the bin folder and game folder before you launch the game.

How long does it take for all of you to finally realise that this is a Skidrow release and as such it will not work, so dont even bother to download. They are renowned for issuing hundreds of downloads , none of which work.
surprisingly when you ask for help such as , crashes, stalls , wrong serials etc etc, SKIDROW are noticeable by their lack of any responce whatsoever. Just a way of fouling everyones systems up and wasting everyones time.
IF you think i am wrong then look how many times Skidrow upload the same program with different variants but basically the same game, and ask yourself why reload another of the same game if the first one worked.
also take a look at the questions asked about the non working game and see how many replies Skidrow have sent, dont be surprised as to finding no replies, as they wont, 99.9% of Skidrow so called uploads are scams designed to have you running round in circles and begging for solutions, they know that and thats why its done.
again if i am wrong then this game simply downloads and works for everyone eh"
,ccrusher1,2012-03-25T19:44Z,"Very nice, MAFIAA. I'm downloading at 1.1 MB/s. Thanks for this amazing download :D. A game I started downloading yesterday, that was a 1 GB more than this, took 20 hours. for 6 GB, this download's expected to take 2 hours. I need to download from you more often :D."
