,tapper101,2011-04-19T01:32Z,"Buketsful you're talking about writing, yet you have the grammar of a 5 year old. Learn to write, then you may talk about writing... Can't believe you wrote all that without a single punctuation or comma, what a massive idiot. If you're British, it's a shame really as you're being schooled by a guy who's second language is English.

It doesn't matter what nationality the writer is, I mean the story is set in a fictional world and not in Britain. Sure there's a mix of American and British actors in the cast, but it doesn't really matter what accent they have - it's fiction. They could speak any language and it would work. The northern men are most likely Scandinavians if anything.. and you don't see them speaking any of the Norse languages. It's all to make it easier for the viewer.

Lord of the Rings is British, yet the film was made by people from New Zealand. Turned out pretty good don't you think?"
,Croix1979,2011-04-19T02:03Z,Nice show. But scary stuff. I would not recommend it for kids.
,sleepyj22,2011-04-19T02:05Z,"@ buketsful

For the record. This isn't history, it's fantasy. And historical films require great writers. Watch Michael Collins, probably my favorite historical.

Excellent series, hopefully Martin finishes soon. Im extremely excited for this to finish DL, thanks OP."
,Broteas,2011-04-19T02:32Z,"@buketsful

,Peanut990,2011-04-20T14:44Z,"@buketsful you do realize the book that this show is based on was written by an American right? Not an englishman. Also, the author worked with the show's producers closely and said that they show is very faithful to his work. This book has nothing to do with history so relax. Get your facts straight before you post bullshit online with shit grammar for other people to read, especially when they're such hateful comments. I'm not even American and I'm pissed.

Oh, and the spelling is ""Trace"" not ""trase""."
,DrKoNfLiCt,2011-04-20T15:40Z,So this is the pilot i guess ?
,MasterDuke,2011-04-20T18:53Z,"As of 19/April/2011 HBO is watching this torrent and others like it. I got an email from my ISP telling me to cease and desist from sharing this one. I use PeerBlock and it didn't have the IP in its DB.

,mohiergauth,2011-04-22T01:10Z,"@buketsful You are obviously a Troll. Unless there is a Winterfell, Kings Landing or Pentos anywhere in England, this particular mythos is just that MYTHOS, based on no sort of fact at all. It must be English, after all there are longswords, and Longbows, bascinets and chainmail, right? And these things must make it Historical then eh? As far as nothing good coming out of Hollywood lately, you couldn't be more wrong. Although largely I would agree most of it is complete tripe. Come to America, talk the same shit you did on here, and see how far you get before some soul~less ganger air~holes your ass."
,ashen77,2011-04-22T19:33Z,"Hey SSbay, fuck off and try and push your stock values up some where else arsewipe.

DL'ing this now, hearing good things.

Oh, and buketsful... kill your self before you breed others like you. Though, I have to say, I agree with you about Camelot. It started well and then... FAILED! Oh, and Arthur wasnt Welsh.. As it was called something else then. ""Powys"" I believe. Besides, folklore isnt exactly FACT.

Keep up the fine work EZ. Long live TPB!!"

buketsful it is people like you who make me ashamed to be English. Next time you get over excited about something may I suggest you leave it for a few hours before writing anything. Better yet get an adult to help you with the hard words and punctuation. If no one will help you (who could blame them?) most web browsers have a dictionary or spell-checker built in (if yours dose not they are easy to install) may I suggest you use it."

,darkscale,2012-01-15T11:39Z,"@manobassa: there's a bit of a loophole, especially concerning tv shows. People have been recording shows and sharing them since the ability to do so became available, most notably with the VCR. The only difference is that it is now easier and faster to do so. TV shows are already broadcast for free (except on cable) with no copyright notice. Always have been. The MPAA are just whining because they didn't think things through far enough. So long as you are not making money from copyrighted material, there really is no problem."

You should know that HBO is part of the Time Warner group wich is one of the biggest media empire in the world. 
From CNN to Warner Bros and New Line Cinema, it's all the same money pocket.
And trust them to know shure enough how to make a buck, adapting to the new way people consume medias.

They'll have to face the new reality that today's technology will always overcome some part of a copyrighted entertainment.

From a certain point of view, allowing a free pass for tv shows or movie rips on the internet is not a big deal at all, and stop believing those economic dramas.
Instead of several millions of money back on their producing, they'll have....less millions.
Fuck them, less thinking about money, and more creativity/culture circulating around."
