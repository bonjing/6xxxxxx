the keygen is only 1mb high! "
,ManoloSeven,2011-04-18T21:07Z,"@pompor
If you have got nothing useful to say, don't.
I chose .DMG because it is a very practical file type for mac users; just double-click it and it opens on your desktop, no difficulties. BTW, fairly most of the file is empty, so the download is pretty fast. I am monitoring some of the downloads I am currently seeding, and these are really fast, downloading it all in less than 10 minutes at a speed of, sometimes, less than 1KB/s."

,SimpleSim0n,2011-04-19T05:37Z,Get the real keygen on demonoid 
,Johanooo,2011-04-19T07:33Z,"Can't use this file, either me or the file that is failing. I need a Photoshop CS5 Key"
,ManoloSeven,2011-04-19T18:12Z,"@SimpleSim0n
If it was fake, I would not have used it myself; it is NOT fake, it is a mounted .dmg with the keygen and the readme, see it for yourself before you say any more crap.

@Johanooo
Try getting the file again, it might be corrupted. When you cannot mount an image, file corruption might be your problem. When that happens, try deleting the old one and getting a new copy of the file."
,Miiqu,2011-05-11T06:48Z,"Help! I downloaded this and the serial works alright but my Photoshop wants me to create adobeID account and that I can't bypass.

Wat do?"
,missmyler,2011-05-15T05:01Z,"Worked a treat thank you. Make sure to look at ""read me"" file first so Adobe does not keep asking for a new key"
,MacSaw,2011-05-19T00:44Z,Awesome upload.  You are a gentleman and a scholar.
,janneke435,2011-05-22T19:00Z,"NOTHING FAKE, works fine for me

,swyzewite,2011-06-02T17:17Z,worked great for indesign cs4. had a good laugh about looks and sounds of the app. thanks!
,marvo2200,2011-06-08T22:25Z,Does this work for Adobe CS5.5?
,ManoloSeven,2011-06-09T23:25Z,"I'm back =D

,BabelB,2011-06-12T01:44Z,"This doesn't work on cs5.1
The serial numbers all are fine, but it requires 'access to the internet' to check.
I hit 'patch' and it says that it patched it but it doesn't stop demanding internet access"
,superGM31,2011-06-15T20:25Z,99.8% please seedddddd
,Kimbasawrus,2011-06-16T09:26Z,Worked beautifully! Thank you :D
,dirk9999,2011-06-27T10:03Z,"Do anybody know anything about the risk of using Core keygen? It makes me a little nervous, that it has to rewrite files to make CS5 work... "
,ManoloSeven,2011-07-06T17:59Z,"@superGM31 
I always seed O_O

@Kimbasawrus
You're welcome =D

@BabelB
I know, only works for CS4-5.

@dirk9999
It doesn't rewrite, it just 'blocks' activate.adobe.com so the app does not keep asking you for a new key."
,Rocklord_1,2011-07-10T09:13Z,"Bravo ManoloSeven!
Works a treat :D"
,ManoloSeven,2011-07-12T05:17Z,"@Rocklord_1
Well, thank you for both the download and the comment; seed, please =D"
,kitsune777,2011-08-01T05:39Z,"You can make a DMG smaller by converting it to the ""Compressed"" image format."
,ManoloSeven,2011-08-03T22:12Z,"@kitsune777
The option wasn't available."
,fickyrisher,2011-08-21T16:08Z,"Awesome, fast safe works a charme...

Thanks ManoloSeven (: "
,DresdenTroll,2011-09-03T15:02Z,Awesome! Managed to install CS4 successfully. :) 
,Princess2806,2011-09-16T06:04Z,"I tried downloading this and it worked but when i open it in downloads, some gibberish appears. Please help.
I'm new to mac and this site."
,MacNaldo,2011-09-21T07:03Z,works! Hopefully it wont ask me for the key in the near future. So far so good!
,ManoloSeven,2011-09-23T23:56Z,"@Princess2806
Do you have a torrent client installed?

@MacNaldo
Happy you liked it =D"
,MacFan12,2011-10-13T06:42Z,It worked very well for Lightroom 3. However I'm having trouble getting photoshop CS5 to get past the adobe application manger authentication. The serial number worked great however the next page asks for adobe username and password. I assume it checks with the mothership to see if you paid or not. Any ideas to bypass this step? The patch didn't help with it.
,bpdingo,2011-10-21T20:50Z,bloody brilliant! way to go ManoloSeven!
,evilbobsta,2011-11-14T19:02Z,Having a bit of trouble. Downloaded great and am currently seeding. HOWEVER - It won't let me open the .dmg file :(  Just double click it and nothing happens. I am new to mac's. Do I have to 'open with' another program? please reply thnx
,leodang,2011-11-23T02:36Z," Install CS5 successfully. :) 
Thanks ManoloSeven (: "

,MacMan1605,2012-02-09T02:36Z,"I am having the same problem as @MacFan12, there is no ""later"" button to click on that you said in the previous comments. Please help! Btw, I dig the music."

,plasticvisions,2012-02-23T07:43Z,"im having trouble opening the keygen on my mac. when i open it, it is popping up in a terminal window and says ""cannot execute binary file"". what am i doing wrong?? i really need a serial for indesign cs4! please help!"
,wontonwonton,2012-04-06T15:19Z,Thank You!!!! Worked like a charm
,captainsmee,2012-04-19T20:33Z,"Thanks for sharing, your time and efforts are highly appreciated."
,medico_brazil,2012-05-15T03:43Z,Awesome!!! WORKS FINE!!! THANX!!
,Cyanpearl,2012-06-03T05:13Z,"Installed fine for me, patched it, it accepted the key - but as others have stated, there is no longer an option to ""skip"" the registration step. When I put in an Adobe ID it demands, it takes you to the next dialog box where it says ""We are unable to start your subscription for Adobe Photoshop CS5.1 Extended Subscription Edition."" It prompts you to close and reopen photoshop - at which point you have to reenter the key, etc. It's worthless if you can't get past this step now. "
,swtlady0903,2012-06-08T22:08Z,worked beee e A U tifullly.
,pigeonings,2012-06-17T23:51Z,"@marvo2200 and @ManoloSeven:

I know the question is kinda old, but I have an update re: this working w/ CS5.5. Apparently it does not. I downloaded it and it worked *beautifully* with my copy of Illustrator CS5.1, but when I tried to use it w/ Dreamweaver CS5.5, it said, ""This serial number is not valid for this product."" So, there ya go. =P "
