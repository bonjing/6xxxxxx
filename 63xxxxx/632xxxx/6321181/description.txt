This album is Mariah's bestseller, for good reason. It contains two of her biggest hits, the pop perfection of "Dreamlover" and the inspiring lyrics of "Hero". It also includes her beautiful remake of "Without You" as well as the inspiring "Anytime You Need A Friend". The album is listenable from beginning to end, with no slow spots. Without You is probably Mariah's biggest hit in Europe, landing Miss Carey her first UK no.1. It is a powerful ballad, which surely displays Mariah Carey's ability to take a cover version and make it her own.
