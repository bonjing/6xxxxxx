,bf2v15,2011-04-26T02:09Z,"Some people have been confused by the title.
To clarify ""Full Game"":
This torrent has all expansions
Special Forces, Armored Fury & Euro Force"
,Minecraft,2011-05-07T21:52Z,In case you are downloading this to play PR i've got some good news. WORKS FUCKING WELL !
,sky0dragon,2011-05-11T23:46Z,"1. Run this to install BF2 and your Serials

i run that... tried any C:\Games\BF2
even C: and nothing... press enter and just ask again... for it"
,bf2v15,2011-05-12T01:47Z,"Did you edit the installation file?
It shouldn't loop unless some lines were accidentally deleted by the downloader while viewing it in Notepad.

In your torrent download program:
Right-click this torrent & Left-click ""Force Re-Check""
Hopefully it will redownload the installation file.

Then try running the installation file again & press ""A"" instead of ""C""."
,sky0dragon,2011-05-12T15:55Z,"i downloaded (didnt touch anything) when it finished just opened (1. Run this to install BF2 and your Serials)
tried any install path... every time i press enter just stay there asking for a path

i have
1. Run this to install BF2 and your Serials
2. Readme
autorun
Files (Folder with 3 files inside)

the only thing i have touched is my PC... could it be that this need some windows app to run?
because i have alot of services off... "
,madbcows,2011-05-17T00:10Z,"I installed it, all went well, but i cant find an .exe to play the game.  What do I do to run it?  my cd keys are valid, i even inserted disc 1. "
,bf2v15,2011-05-17T05:34Z,"Hi Skydragon, the installer uses CMD (DOS), your disabled services won't affect it :)
1. Double-click ""1. Run this to install BF2 and your Serials""
2. Press ""A"" (NOT Enter)
It'll auto-install

The reason it keeps repeating itself is it is asking you to press ""A"" or ""C""... Enter does nothing in the first prompt.

Good luck!"
,bf2v15,2011-05-17T05:37Z,"Hi Madbcows,

You don't need to insert Disc 1 to play anymore; Patch v1.5 removed that requirement =)

The installer should have placed 2 Shortcuts on your desktop?

Otherwise, go to the directory where you installed BF2 (Default location is C:\Games\BF2)
& Run ""BF2.exe""

Cheers!"
,kattwuver202a,2011-05-19T12:50Z,"WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY PRESS A???? i push a and it types the letter a and does nothing, can i please have a more precise explanation than ""press A"""
,bf2v15,2011-05-20T11:00Z,"The CMD file explains perfectly...but here you go:
1. Start ""1.Run this to install BF2 and your serials.CMD""
2. The first prompt asks you:
    To press ""A"" to install to C:\Games\BF2
    or
    To press ""C"" which lets you customize the installation directory.
3. If you pressed A: it will instantly start installing BF2 to C:\Games\BF2
    If you pressed C: it will go to the next prompt, asking you to type in a Custom Directory & Press Enter
4. If you pressed A: You're done by now.
    If you pressed C: Confirm your Custom Directory does not have a ""\"" mark at the end & Press Y for Yes
    Press N if you included a ""\"" mark at the end
5. If you pressed Y: You're done by now.
    If you pressed N: Type in your custom directory without a ""\"" at the end & Press Enter & Press Y
Cheers =)"
,bf2v15,2011-05-20T11:06Z,"If your Windows Installation has some extreme security that it doesn't let you input options into a DOS window:
1. Right-click ""1. Run this to install BF2 and your Serials.CMD""
2. Left-click ""Edit""
3. In Notepad: Highlight everything ABOVE:
""::---------------------------------------Install BF2 To Default Location""
4. Delete the highlighted section.
5. File Menu -> Save
6. Start the CMD file...it will Install BF2 without prompts & ask you to insert your serials afterwards
Cheers =)"
,bf2v15,2011-05-20T11:20Z,"If you purchased BF2 more than two years ago:
You received 2 separate keys...1 for BF2, 1 for SF.

If you purchased BF2 less than last two years:
You may have received only 1 CD Key...use that key during installation for both key prompts.

,kattwuver202a,2011-05-20T15:55Z,THANKS SO MUCH MAN it just kept looping nomater what i did but now its installing as i type this :)

,Prvmuo,2011-06-09T21:45Z,"@bf2v15 
I get this error after i type my serial..
  Your current serials are:
ERROR: The system was unable to find the specified registry key or value.
i typed with and without ' - ' but it keeps giving this error. ( I also got serial like 
xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
   Battlefield 2
xxxxxxxxxxxx 
the second numbers are for SF?) "
,bf2v15,2011-06-15T10:28Z,"Sounds like your user account is slightly restricted or a non-microsoft realtime security program removed the entry.
Right-click ""BF2 Serial.cmd"" -> Click ""Run as administrator""
Make sure you're not on a Windows Limited Account.
And yep, the second serial prompt is for the SF serial.
(If you purchased BF2 before 2009 you received 2 keys; after 2009 1 key for both)
Cheers"
,Prvmuo,2011-06-16T15:45Z,Yeah it was about user account.. running as administrator solves the problem.thanks for your help 
,humjaba,2011-06-17T03:41Z,"So I've installed and it runs well, but when I attempt to join a server it says ""CD Key invalid!""

I punched in the CD keys I have for BF2 (I bought them forever ago, but my CD is lost). I seem to remember after v1.44 they started encrypting the CD keys in the registry. I see that your program doesnt do this. What do you suggest?"
,bf2v15,2011-07-02T10:29Z,"@humjaba
The encryption part of the key is 'x9392' and is entered automatically by the installation file.
Yes, the 1.4 patch installer introduced encryption, and usually screwed up when scrambling our keys.
It's the reason BF2 forums have Invalid Key threads; which EA quickly fixed by telling us to go into the Windows Registry and retype our keys with capslock on and start with 'x9392'.

Please do the following:
1. Go to BF2's installation directory and run 'BF2 Serial.cmd' - It will list what you entered into the Windows Registry during BF2's installation.
If you see any lowercase letters, Press 'Y'
If you typed in hyphen's, Press Y
2. Follow on-screen instructions to change the serials.
Don't type in x9392, the command file does it automatically.

Example of a correctly typed key:
23I4N2IU3B5I23IU4321
Example of an incorrectly typed key:
23i4-n2iu-3b5i-23iu-4321

Great to hear! Thanks!"

,Duhya2,2011-07-04T22:00Z,"i get a error, it says it couldnt find battlefield 2 version 1.5 full game installation. Can somebody with the whole file seed?"
,bf2v15,2011-07-05T01:08Z,"Sounds like the Registry entry for BF2's Location wasn't added during Installation.
Please do the following:
1. Go to BF2's Installation Directory
2. Right-click on ""BF2 Location.cmd""
3. Left-click on ""Run as administrator""
4. In the CMD Window, make sure the directory is shown
At the end of the entry, make sure there isn't a slash or double-slash '\' '\\'
5. Press Y
6. Retype the installation directory
Example: C:\Games\BF2
7. Press Enter
8. Press N
9. Try installing PR again"
,bf2v15,2011-07-05T01:21Z,"I just checked the PR installation, if offers the option to ""Browse"" for the installation directory.
Select the root installation directory (where BF2.EXE is) ""C:\Games\BF2""
Cheers"
,bf2v15,2011-07-09T17:16Z,"I just realized I skimmed earlier and the error you're encountering is the torrent's download location on your computer. There are many reasons why a location can't be found -- corrupt drive, invalid chosen location, etc.

There are a lot of seeders (thank you seeders!!)"
,coty615boyz,2011-07-30T21:18Z,"Hey, does this version work with AIX 2.0?
I see that it does with PR."

what to do now? :("
,bf2v15,2011-09-07T08:42Z,"Did you right-click the installation file & choose ""Run As Administrator""? That usually solves extreme security issues.

Since you have the files installed, go to BF2's installation directory and run PBSetup.exe
Then you can play BF2 without being kicked by Punkbuster being out of date
