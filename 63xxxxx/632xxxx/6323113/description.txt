Chinese Grand Prix Qualifying Live

As Many of you F1 followers on here have asked for High Definition Qualify, Ive decided to bite the bullet
and buy the 1st DVB-T2 Freeview HD Tuner card available here in the UK! Its taken some time to work out 
the bugs with the limited software supplied (as Im yet to find a suitable DVB-T2 supported 3rd party
software). Also finding a decent demuxer and encoder as in their wisdom, the HD on freeview is broadcast 
in AAC 5.1! not AC3 Dolby Digital, which posed no end of problems with encoding to mp4 etc
but I can now bring you The Formula 1 coverage in HD!

From now, both the Qualifying & the Race will be uploaded in High Definition..

At present there is no Red Button Service In HD so Im afraid the Practice sessions which are on the BBC 
Interative feed only are of SD quality. Hopefully the BBC will soon add support for this for those users
such as myself that are using a PC as their PVR!

In order to keep file sizes to a reasonable level for uploading/downloading purposes, I have had to limit
 the bitrate on the encoding to within an acceptable norm bearing in mind that most TV Broadcasts from 
the US for example, use around 1.2GB per 45min episodes of HD Ripped from a TV Source.
With that in mind, Ive kept the bitrate around the same which is under 4000kbps.

The original BBC HD broadcasts is 1440x1080 (1080i) which isnt really 1080p quality as its interlaced, its more in between 
1080p & 720p, but i decided to keep as high a resolution as possible, so my F1 uploads will remain 1440x1080. 

Again to keep the codec situation to a minimum, and to ensure playback on most machines, 
I have dropped the MP4 format in favour of the Matroska container format (mkv)

Video: The Video is encoded using AVC/H.264 into a mkv container
Audio: The audio is now Dolby Digital. Support for  AC3 codec (2 channels as Live broadcasts are not 5.1)

Ive tested these recoded files myself on a LCD 50\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Full HD LG TV, and the quality is excellent.

I hope you all enjoy the Formula 1 coverage in HD, and DONT complain about the increased file sizes! 
If you all seed for as long as you can, you will all get a fast download!

I hope you all enjoy the Formula 1 coverage in HD....

For anyone who need it, or those unfamiliar with playing HD quality on their PC, 
Ive included this first upload with an excellent player for MKV h.264 encoded media.
Included in the torrent is VLC Media Player v1.1.9, just install and play! You can additionally
install the AC3 filter for those using a home theatre system for digital passthrough AC3>SPDIF output

Anyway, enough waffling, here\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the details:
