,ecwds,2011-04-19T03:41Z,"What do you mean by 'Unpack'?

Sorry to sound stupid but i've burned various images, but this one's a little different.

I usually use WinRar to unzip the files, but this is only coming out at 4Gb rather than 7Gb.

What program do I need to be using to 'unpack'? Thank you :)"
,yakuzasi,2011-04-19T08:02Z,Try using 7zip...
