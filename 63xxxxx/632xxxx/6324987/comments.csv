Before half of the instalation process I get the message:

- ""Please insert the disk: AutoCAD Civil 3D 2012 64 bit""

What can it be?"

I copied the content of the image file to the hard drive, then the message didn't appear.

Thank you!"

2. If u've Winrar...right click on the first zip file & choose extract to folder c3dx64(or watever name it shows).
3. Install daemon tools & add a virtual drive.(it'd be easy if u've install the desktop gadget during installation).
4. Once the virtual drive is added, click on mount image. You'll 've to browse through the location & choose the extracted file(.iso file) in the folder listed above.
5. Now open my computer & double click the virtual drive.
6. You'll see an application to start the installation.
7. Follow the instructions in the text file given in the crack folder for complete installation & registration.  "
,uktop,2012-05-24T15:58Z,"Boas.

Já consegui instalar o programa, mas agora quando ia a inicializar o crack para win64 simplesmente nao funciona, dando a seguinte mensagem ""O Windows nao consegue aceder ao dispositivo, caminho ou ficheiro especificado. Poderá não ter permissões adequadas para aceder ao item.""

Já iniciei inclusive como administrador e mesmo assim não funciona, o de win32 abre perfeitamente mas não me serve de nada

Alguem me consegue ajudar?

Obrigado"

I´ve already instaled the program, but when i try to use the xforce 64 it doesn´t work.

Does anyone had the same problem? And if so, how did you solve it?

Thanks"
