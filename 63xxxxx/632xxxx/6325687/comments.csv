,Pothead808,2011-04-18T15:00Z,"^ Go suck cena's cock you dumb shit, I'll admit tna is cheesy and ridiculous but it beats the crap wwe has turned into, which is made for people under the age of 14.....so i guess its perfect for you right? Most WWE matches are over in under 5 mins, usually unfairly to progress a story...instead of....you know, actually having some decent wrestling matches? Atleast i get some of those from tna."
,DavidDeath,2011-04-18T18:21Z,"Pothead808 knows what he's talking about, that is exactly how I feel.

WWE is for retarded people and little kids with their dumbed down storylines and punch-kick 5 minute matches.

WWE really sucks monkey cock and so does everyone who think WWE is better than TNA"
