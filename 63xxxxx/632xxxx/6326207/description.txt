These are the originals recordings of music from 1990\'s post nuclear RPG games. These cues were taken from game files [excluding the songs because a true score is pure score and not an OST]. I wasn\'t able to extract the music which is played during the cinematics, because some dumb fuck from Interplay mixed it with sound [and there is no way of getting it out in a convinient way]. If somehow you do have these few additional short tracks- plese, post a link to them in comments

This is not the Vault Archives version from 2010 [remastered by a \"professional\", who in a mather of fact did a rather shitty job on most of the tracks]. All of the titles are taken from games

I\'ve semi-remastered all of the tracks by adjusting the volume or making them lauder where it needed to be done [fuck the dynamics!]. And that\'s without sound quality lost because I did not use some quick automatic normalization option but instead of that I used my senses and expierience. I have also cleaned the tracks from any clicks / pops / pitches / glitches that would have been otherwise hearable on moderate volume on speakers
