,royhere,2011-04-20T08:04Z,"On the weekend , Saturday and sunday.

you have to register on tptb site. wait 2 days
If the admin confirms than you have a account on tptb.

and dont try to make again and again try
.single try on every weekend if you account is not make.

Very simple .only weekends and only one try.
wait for process of confirmation .

And tptb make all these game rip on the site crysis 2,Acb and all the games which is comes."
