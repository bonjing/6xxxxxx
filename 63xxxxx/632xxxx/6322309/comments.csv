,Caleb37,2011-04-18T03:46Z,"Greetings and Thank you for this release.  I have a DVD set of episodes for a show that has been extinct for about 25 years and would like to convert them to MKV as you have.  Can you provide any pointers as to the encoder and guides you use?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I've been trying MeGUI but run into a couple of problems related to dumbness(on my part) and the guides available don't show a good point of reference from beginning to end, just a lot of word definitions and potential choices. My problem is creating the AVS and using the right de-interlacer though Yadif has been highly recommended.  I know my source but I'm trying to get the specs as close to yours as possible, if possible.  Any help would be considered grateful and greatness. Caleb37"
