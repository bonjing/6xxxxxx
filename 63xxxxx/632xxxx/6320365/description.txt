Double & Multiple Stars, and How to Observe Them is written specially for practical amateur astronomers who not only want to observe, but want to know and understand the details of exactly what they are looking at.  

Increasing light pollution throughout the world does not affect the viewing of double and multiple stars, unlike most classes of deep-sky objects. More and more amateur astronomers are turning to this interesting ? and scientifically useful ? area.

The concept of the book ? and of the series ? is to present an up-to-date detailed description of the objects, their physics and their evolution (part one); and then (part two) to consider how to observe and record them successfully.  

Double & Multiple Stars, and How to Observe Them is a mine of information for all levels of amateur observers, from the beginner to the experienced; it is equally fascinating for practical astronomers, and also for those who simply want to find out more about these unusual star systems.
