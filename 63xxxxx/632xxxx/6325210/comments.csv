Another great recording and quickly uploaded for us - brilliant.

Love the way the Bolton followers [you can't call 'em supporters] start to leave the ground half way through the second half. I recall the Stoke supporters doing the conga around the Emirates when 4-0 down a couple of seasons ago, just happy to be there and watching a good game.

So you disrespect the man by calling him that and then you post what's basically a spoiler about the game? What is wrong with people? It's like you want to make us lose one of - if not the - best sources of quality football we have. 

Thanks for this and all the other quality uploads Pooloop."
