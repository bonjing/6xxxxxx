,lol21,2011-04-17T11:30Z,Great Uploads as always would be nice if there were more recent once like Battle of Los Angeles. Way Better uploads then extremezone gets from other people maybe you can figure out something with him to get the community of mkv files bigger ; ). And that way maybe more people will follow ^^

Psych (2006) Seasons 1-5
Monk (2002) Seasons 1-8

Would extremely appreciate it! "

,OscarTheSlouch,2011-09-17T06:18Z,"DOWNLOADERS NOTE: This file (and several others by the same uploader) contain a video stream that some hardware players cannot play. (The audio stream works fine.) Software-based players (like VLC) seem unaffected by the problem and work fine. If you plan to use a hardware-based player, test it before you spend a lot of time downloading!"
