[T],ADHDerby,2011-04-18T09:33Z,You probably unlocked the Chevrolet Corvette Z06 with another BOOTPSA mod. Normally you can't buy it but you can win it in Career Mode.
[T],ADHDerby,2011-04-21T09:19Z,"???

Where are the rest of the comments??! :S"
[T],ADHDerby,2011-04-22T17:53Z,It unlocks the events and the cars (you can buy them in the Car Lot)
,melloyello33,2011-04-24T23:03Z,"Thanks mate!

Just one question. Where are the limited edition events? I can't find them!"
[T],ADHDerby,2011-04-25T00:04Z,"You can find them in Career: Manufacturer Showdown, Old vs New and Single-Type"
,melloyello33,2011-04-25T00:09Z,"Oh, ok mate, thanks! It's just that it doesn't works with Reloaded crack. Just works with VOVAN31337 crack.

Thanks again!"
[T],ADHDerby,2011-04-25T00:39Z,"It should also work with the crack from RELOADED, just make sure that you also copy the dll file."
,Blaze-Viper,2011-04-28T05:55Z,"I can confim this. Here's what events work with whose crack:

RELOADED: Dr.Pepper Events

VOVAN31337: Dr.Pepper Events, Manufacturer Showdown, Old VS New, Single Type

The cars work with either crack but Vovan's unlocks everything."
,syso01,2011-04-28T15:55Z,"And what about original game? I have legit copy, will this work for me?"
[T],ADHDerby,2011-04-29T12:27Z,"@ Blaze-Viper: It's weird, it should work for all executables because I've changed the same commands in all exe files. :S

@ syso01: Yes,.. you can use the executable from the ""Not_Cracked"" directory."
,CRANK901,2011-05-01T04:56Z,can someone plz tell me if this torrent actually works and the game works
,melloyello33,2011-05-10T17:04Z,"I can finally say that it works with both cracks. But not from the beginning. First it works as Blaze-Viper says. Just the VOVAN31337 crack unlocks everything. But it has some glitches and sometimes the game crash when it loads some of the special events. 

The strange thing is that, once you've played in all the special events with VOVAN31337's crack, if you put the RELOADED CRACK you'll have everything unlocked too and, the best of all, whitout crashes.

Thanks to ADHDerby for his help and this great unlocker."

The unlocker is not working after applying the 1.0.1 patch and crack.

Link to the new crack:

*ediafire.com/?hm97yk8zybh97el
*ultiupload.com/2KBLBJCMFM

replace * with a M

It shows as virus but it's a false positive.

Can you fix it ?
Even the save game is not working."
[T],ADHDerby,2011-05-13T09:42Z,"@ melloyello33: You're welcome :)
The RELOADED crack works here from the beginning, I guess it's depending on the language version of Windows.

@ stuck4ever: This crack is encrypted,.. which is unusual because the original updated executable is not encrypted."
,stuck4ever,2011-05-13T14:30Z,"@ADHDerby

Wow ! There is no way we can get the Limited Edition content then, I guess ?

The savegame in this torrent was awesome, it unlocked everything properly.
I completed few of the special events too when the patch came out and messed this up :(

Are you saying a fixed exe is required for the LE content ? Can't we do it any other way ?"
,Dhatz,2011-05-15T16:19Z,we need some way to make it work with the patch and/or future patches
[T],ADHDerby,2011-05-16T09:33Z,Just wait for a release by RELOADED or from another hacker group which don't encrypt their releases.
,DaFoka,2011-07-13T16:07Z,"Just Dr Pepper evets and cars. Couldn't find any Limited Edition event in career mode.

,local313talent,2011-07-14T13:58Z,any chance u can modify and post original (not cracked) 1.0.2.0 version exe?
[T],ADHDerby,2011-07-23T01:03Z,@ local313talent: http://www.xxxxspace.com/file/mi6dzz (replace xxxx with send)
[T],ADHDerby,2011-07-23T01:06Z,@ DaFoka: Did you use the modified BOOTPSA.bff or the savegame?
,DaFoka,2011-07-23T01:41Z,"Both files didn't work.)
Downloaded from other site, now got all LE cars and events."
