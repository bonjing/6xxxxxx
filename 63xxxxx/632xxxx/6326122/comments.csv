click/highlight the 30gb UFO torrent in the download box in your U-torrent/bit torrent. Then click the files tab on the bottom and check to see what files are 100% done. 

Also if you want a certain file to go/finish faster then others right click it and go to Priority & put it High. 

I have done this & I believe the current 14 seeders have done the same, because the best shit finished first for me. Ancient structures, Marcawasi/peru monolith stuff, Mars structures, 2012, anti darwin, etc... Lot on ancient mans incredible skills and inventions, like ancient aliens on History.

Anyway so dont be afraid to download no matter how long it says it takes.  Just do what i said & SEED U BASTARDS 

& Give your thanks to fymd cause he's that dude!"
