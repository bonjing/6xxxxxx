     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      Documentary following the epic battle of American
      billionaire Donald Trump to build 'the greatest golf course in
      the world' on a beautiful, protected stretch of coastline in the
      north-east of Scotland. When Trump announces bold plans for two
      golf courses, private houses and a five-star hotel, not everyone
      welcomes him with open arms. Protestors find an unlikely local
      hero in farmer Michael Forbes. His 22-acre property is
      surrounded on all sides by prime Trump real estate, yet the
      stubborn local farmer is not selling. Featuring five years of
      exclusive interviews with Trump and his family, the programme
      tells the story of this controversial billion-pound development
      from first announcement to the moment the diggers roll.
