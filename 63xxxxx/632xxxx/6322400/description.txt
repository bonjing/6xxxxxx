Natural Born Killers

(1994) NR
 
Director Oliver Stone's stark satire of media and murder still generates controversy. Mickey and Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis, respectively) hit the road on an interstate killing spree that triggers a manhunt and garners amazing ratings for a tabloid TV star (Robert Downey Jr.). Shocking, bloody and relentlessly violent, Stone's visually frenetic film makes a chilling statement about the American cultural landscape.
