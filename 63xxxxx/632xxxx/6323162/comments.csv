I cant get the hdd recovery to work on it and this really is my last option as i cant afford the $40 recovery disc from toshiba.

been downloading this all night and ive got to 2.5 % - more seeds would be very much appetited as im only getting between 4 - 5 kbs and have had that all night.

if anybody knows how i can get my satellite a300-1j1 back to factory settings without this software please let me know (will have to download for around 3 months at this speed) so would be much appretiated.

Thanks for the up, looked everywhere for this, now i just gotta wait and hope to god it works lol.

Thanks, D."
