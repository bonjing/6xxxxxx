That being said, it is only logical that since quran is a teacher to modern scentists that the most number of scientists would come from the muslim world. Their discoveries would be so profound that it will be well known and would change the world for the better. Clearly, as any objective person would know that is not the case. 

As it stands right now the muslim countries in this world are embroiled in all sorts of conflicts with each other. There is a paucity of scientists, artists and basically any kind of thinkers. If things dont change for Islam it will be the end of itself and it will take the world with it. "
,sarsapil,2011-04-19T06:56Z,"WOW, according to our stable muslim clown, the quran mentions the A and H bombs, space exploration, DNA research, microneurosurgery, radio, TV, laser beams, etc. LOL, what a fool, hard to believe some people can say such things and not die of embarrassment. But of course, if you are a goat-shagging peasant, you believe anything... "

Religion invents justifications for assumptions.
Truth-seeking starts with questions, not answers.
Religion is inherently intellectually dishonest.

Islamic states mostly produce oil, blood, & hate.
Xian states are slightly better, when secularized.
Reality is what remains when belief goes away."
