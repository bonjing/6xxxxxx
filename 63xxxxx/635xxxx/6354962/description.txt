It's really funny and weird together, how come some real masterpieces have been lost in the vortex of time. Perhaps poor planning? Wrong promotional choices ? Who knows. Perhaps -certain- in this case, the origin of the artist. Bruce Hamana, son of Original Hopi tribe living in Oraibi (area of Arizona state), grew up there, went to school at Phoenix Indian High School where he participated in various bands like "The Electric Indiansâ€, "Velvet Egg", "No N'd", and finally "The Mocassin Grapevine".
When he finished High School, went off to college in Ohio where he had a scholarship for pre-law, was one of only two Indian boys in the college. Although that he tried to stick it out, he failed, so after two years went back to Oraibi.
Later he went to California where he played drums in a band for a year, soon after came in urge to record an album, which released without commercial success, but as a bright, shinny, colorful work, with great voices and arrangements, Bruce played most of the instruments, wrote all the songs and produced the album. The value of the original album press is more than 700,00$US
