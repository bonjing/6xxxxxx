Plot summary
 
Dean Seagrave (David Sutcliffe) is a thirty-something graphic novelist living in L.A., and though he's found personal happiness with his hot, Argentinian boyfriend, Pablo (Antonio Sabato, Jr.), he can't surmount his writers' block slump following his successful debut graphic novel, Teenage Speed Freak. His life begins to unravel when his editor, Luise (Coolidge), gives him a final ultimatum, and Pablo, the sexy boyfriend, goes out for cigarettes one night and never comes back. Lonely, depressed, and at the end of his rope, he flies to Argentina in search of closure, but the characters he discovers there â€“ Pablo's secretive and controlling Mother, Pablo's ex-lover Marcos (Leonardo Brzezicki), and Marcos's enigmatic sister Sofia (Celina Font) â€“ conspire to prevent him from reaching Pablo.
