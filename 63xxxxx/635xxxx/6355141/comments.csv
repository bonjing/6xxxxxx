,NitrogenUA,2011-04-30T11:38Z,"savegame import from patapon 2 works, btw."
,zlatantz,2011-05-23T19:12Z,Thanks man a lot! I'll seed! :) :)
,zlatantz,2011-05-23T19:14Z,"Btw, it works on 6.35 pro."
,dlighted,2011-06-06T22:09Z,"phew just spent a couple of hours trying to get this to work. 

firstly, lots of thanks and kudos to NitrogenUA for uploading and assistance on his torrent threads. otherwise will probably be at it for days.

anyway, here's what i've done to get this to work

- started on 3.90 m33
- upgraded to 5.0 m33-6
- upgraded to 6.39 me-4
- changed ISO setting to NP9660

then played like a charm. not saying mine's the only way that works, could be other 'paths' that would work as well.

thanks again!
"

,NitrogenUA,2011-06-16T12:19Z,"dlighted, thanks for reporting back, mate.

dasco2xxx, i've downloaded and tested these two:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5758526/
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4927551/
both are the same, working fine. So i'm seeding 'em both atm, feel free to download any.
The game looks fun though, gotta check it out further."

,brucelipp,2011-07-17T05:57Z,"you should do the YS Seven games, I've been looking for them forever but can't find a decent copy."
,tapoq2,2011-07-26T23:22Z,whats the difference between the patched and non patched version?
,NitrogenUA,2011-08-23T20:08Z,"haider95, you tried both - patched and unpatched versions?
Try setting 'Sony NP9660' UMD mode via VSH menu and/or increase your CPU clock up to 333. Here is an example of VSH menu which you usually get upon pressing Select while in XMB.

brucelipp, there are couple versions uploaded here on TPB, none of them worked for you?
http://thepiratebay.org/search/PSP%20Ys%20Seven/0/99/0

tapoq2, basically, patched version is for older firmwares like 5.03 GEN + Prometheus or 5.50 GEN + Prometheus. Since newer firmwares can play latest games by default there is no point in patching them. So i'd personally recommend you to use not patched iso for maximum compatibility. Though, in most cases patched ISOs work fine on both old and new firmwares. In the end, it's up to you, which one to use."
,rinku84,2011-11-01T13:01Z,"Does this differ from the US one in any aspect other  than the language?
I mean like which one is newer version if both are not the same version?"
,fruitz221,2011-11-23T12:43Z,"thanks master NitrogenUA, works on 6.60 GodPRO-B9"
,yusuffarooque,2011-11-26T20:40Z,u have uploaded a patched and a non-patched(custom) torrent for this game......so does it mean that i've to  download only one of the 2 files???
,alec2dmax,2012-01-07T18:09Z,"Hmm. Okay. Thank you for the UL @NitrogenUA. The ""patched"" version works perfectly for my 5.50 gen prometheus. "
