Description:

This is a rip of the online version of the textbook. It has all text and images as well as the practice tests, etc. Use the Index file to navigate.

It's much easier to use this on a laptop (and cheaper, if you already have one) than to carry a massive textbook around that only serves one purpose. I haven't used my physical textbook for several months now, and I haven't regretted it once.

This torrent is almost dead, and it's extremely hard to find... I've been seeding for almost half a year (it took me about three months to download it). It's not a huge file, so please SEED as long as! 
Thanks in advance for helping me keep this alive, and enjoy!
