,drumrobot,2011-04-29T03:30Z,PLEASE post a comment if it's working. 
,drumrobot,2011-04-30T01:10Z,"I keep getting ""No input file specified"" when I try to download. If you get this, try http://www.filedude.com/download/8LS1Tw0cW878f3d65e0c to get the (torrent) file.
Again, PLEASE post a comment whether or not it's working. Otherwise, don't blame me if it's messed up."
,drumrobot,2011-04-30T01:11Z,My comments keep disappearing. Odd...
,drumrobot,2011-05-02T03:55Z,"I'm glad to see that the FileDude service is working... eight downloads so far.

Please remember to seed... as I said before, it's not a huge file, and it would be a shame to see this torrent die.

Lastly, please comment about any problems you had (or lack thereof)."
,drumrobot,2011-05-06T17:55Z,Just FYI... you can use this on an iOS device with FileApp (free). It works perfectly...
,drumrobot,2011-08-19T05:15Z,"Oh, and by the way... if you go to school in Forest Road (Maroon and Gray), this is your 8th grade book."
,drumrobot,2011-08-24T00:59Z,"Amazing... I've had at least 50 people download this.
I've been seeding this for months before all of them, and guess what? I'm the only seeder right now.

Way to be greedy, guys..."
