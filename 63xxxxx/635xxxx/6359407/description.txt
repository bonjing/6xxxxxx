     This film is about the experience of           
      dying. Five terminal patients in a              
      Palliative Care Unit share the last days        
      of their lives and deaths with a film           
      crew. They do so in the hope that their         
      experience will be useful to the audience       
      in managing its own fear of dying and           
      death. Their families, friends and staff        
      share in the task. Without narration or         
      interviews, the camera simply and               
      intimately observes the events that occur       
      over the course of fourteen weeks as five       
     people come face to face with the doorway       
    through which we all must pass.
