( Your Daughter's A Slut - Funny Song )

***Lyrics***
With her low-cut shirt and her mini skirt 
she walks to the pole as she gets ready for work
Shes your little sweetheart with her legs spread apart
Daddy's angel is now on top of the bar.
It breaks your heart when shes dancing nude,
And its hard to admit she makes more money than you

Listen closely your daughters a whore
Your little girl is not so little anymore.
You lose your patience as she loses her clothes
There's no saying just how far she will go.
You shake your head she shakes her butt your daughters a slut

A local girl at a near-by college
Is giving it up to anybody that wants it
Shes at all the parties and knows all the guys
But I guess she forgot how to close her thighs
It makes you frown when she takes off her thong
You're ashamed shes turned out just like her mom

Listen closely your daughters a whore
Your little girl is not so little anymore.
You lose your patience as she loses her clothes
There's no saying just how far she will go.
You shake your head she shakes her butt your daughters a slut
