Fantastic Stuff :)

I hope you read this, your uploads are very good, specially this one looks great on a Full HD TV, thank you so much.

May I please request you to upload some of the most iconic flicks of our time in Maximum HD Quality (8 GB or more), I know its painful to download however
once complete...its worth it....

Lord of the Rings Trilogy
Spider Man Trilogy
Bourne Trilogy
The Dark Knight

Best Regards & thank you for your time..."
