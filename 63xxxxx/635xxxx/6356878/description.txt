Edgelands

From BBC Radio 4. Written and Read by Michael Symmons Robert and Paul Farley. Abridged.

Poets Paul Farley and Michael Symmons Roberts explore a wilderness that is much closer than you think: those debatable zones that are neither town nor countryside. These two lyric poets celebrate the strange beauty of these places that we all journey through, but generally fail to acknowledge.

Recorded entirely on location in the English edgelands we journey through the post-industrial landscapes of ruined warehouses, landfill sites, sewage works and power stations.

Today, retail parks and edgeland hotels.
