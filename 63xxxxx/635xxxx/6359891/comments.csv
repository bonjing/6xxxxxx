Not chopped, full screen.

V - 7
A - 8"
,crazzywolfie,2011-05-03T07:00Z,the video quality is poor. the camera keeps moving every so often and you miss some of the video and it also zooms in at some points making it impossible to read all the subtitles.
[V],zaq2qaz,2011-05-03T20:38Z,"what subtitles. there are none on this film. i think you've commented on wrong download, pal"
,LordFerg,2011-05-04T09:07Z,"I've been looking and looking and looking all I could find was the same video over and over again, the chopped one I'm talking about. This one here is by far the best one yet I've found. Not chopped, can see it, can hear it, can understand it. Awesome copy, props to the loader"
,hasin_arshad,2011-05-04T14:42Z,"Just signed up to say what an amazing copy this is an thanks for uploading it.
I have watched it in cinema and wanted to watch it again and this was just perfect.

This is indeed the full screen unlike some of the other I have downloaded which showed 3/4 of the screen, At one point the camera does move about a bit but who cares, its only for a couple of seconds.

Been seeding it for the past 5 hours at 1mb/sec and will keep seeding!!!!

And thanks again pal!"
,hasin_arshad,2011-05-04T14:45Z,Just checked and have seeded nearly 3.5gb and will keep seeding!
,WICCA929,2011-05-05T05:37Z,Will comment when done downloading
,crazzywolfie,2011-05-09T04:28Z,@zaq2qaz i did not comment on the wrong video. there is sub titles when the people are not speaking English. the quality is not that great. you are better off to wait till it is on dvd. 
[V],zaq2qaz,2011-05-12T18:23Z,"then maybe you should have waited. then you could pay for your disappointment. 

it's free here.

but i suppose some people are never satisfied."
,EiNST3iN,2011-05-20T19:11Z,crazzywolfie You are a F-ing idiot. You commented on the wrong Torrent your moron!
