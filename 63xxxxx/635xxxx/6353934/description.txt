Songs:

1 	The wolves are silent
2 	The day the moon howls
3 	Vacant world
4 	Virus (the pride)
5 	Second coming
6 	Forsaken (the regret)
7 	Sun of mourning
8 	Bow to me
9 	Outcast
10 	Sweet enemy mine
11 	Scarred and undefeated
12 	To walk the night

This band, DIABLO BLVD, named after a Corrosion Of Conformity song, lead by notorious stand-up comedian and above all music devotee Alex Agnew, quickly started to turn heads. With current and ex-members of bands like A Brand, Born From Pain and Meuris, this eclectic five-piece started playing shows to appreciative crowds all over Belgium and the Netherlands.
