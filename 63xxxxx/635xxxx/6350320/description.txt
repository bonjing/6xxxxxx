The following is a copy of the long-lost, long-unreleased 1967 album Smile from the Beach Boys. The track listing for this album was compiled by myself using the release of Brian Wilson's final version in 2004 as a reference point. The versions of these songs were otherwise found from the following Beach Boys albums: Smiley Smile (1967), Good Vibrations: 30 Years of The Beach Boys (1995) and the bootleg copy of Smile. Enjoy and smile :)
