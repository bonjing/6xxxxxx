,setxwageslave,2011-05-06T07:08Z,so sick susquatch. and a month early. you rock
,rvnval,2011-05-24T10:05Z,"sorry to be annoying, but track 5 is also with some Skipping Errors, around 35 seconds I guess"
,Susquatch,2011-05-26T11:07Z,"Christ, I don't know how I'm missing this stuff, especially given how many times I've listened to this album! (To be fair, Wall Street isn't one of my favorite tracks on here.) Gloss Drop was extremely difficult to find, though -- especially so early in advance -- so I can't guarantee how quickly a better version of that song will pop up. Sorry, and thanks for pointing it out."
,rvnval,2011-05-26T23:55Z,"I'm sure at the time you found these files there were no better versions. Actually Im kinda crazy, thats why I notice these glitches haha a normal person wouldnt mind. But I wonder, do you know what causes those skipping errors? This week I've got five albums with that stuff (Drop Gloss, Feel It Break, Microcastle, The Flying Club Cup and Burst Apart)... Anyway I already found an impeccable version of this album too. Thanks for the early leaks anyways!"
,Susquatch,2011-05-27T23:23Z,I honestly have no idea why that happens from time to time. I guess it's the price we pay for getting the music early at no charge! (It goes without saying that I don't leak these albums myself; I just find them elsewhere and post them here.)
,Marcvijgen,2011-06-02T19:06Z,Great upload. Thanks a lot !
