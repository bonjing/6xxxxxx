dude, why complain.....you should be grateful you can download it.

A/V=10"
,ediblez,2011-04-29T09:29Z,"Also, we've been imploring him for months to stop using rar but he hasn't listened...so presumably it's wasted energy.

His uploads are consistently top-notch, however, so download worry-free!"
,phrend,2011-04-29T10:20Z,"It's probably in rars because the release is also sent out to news groups.  Of course I prefer mkv/avi files, but it's not that hard to unrar.

Thanks sceneline!"
,BadKarma85,2011-04-29T10:24Z,"Stop QQ about rars O.o

Quality 10/10. thx sceneline. :)"
,TerFar,2011-04-29T13:46Z,"Frankly my dear, who gives a damn?

At least it is top quality, genuine and free. So stop snivelling."

,lamerbr34,2011-04-29T15:16Z,"O cara vive na prĂŠ historia mesmo,,,,, |ainda mandando em rar !@! sucks! mvamo pessoal

,kuku09,2011-04-29T17:15Z,"thanks sceneline another great upload

and who cares if it's in .rar it's free and it's in good quality"
,brian02,2011-04-29T21:33Z,"The fucking planet gives a damn. A couple million people who unrar 500 Mb, it's a fucking handful of kWs wasted...

Thanks for the release anyway."
,Emperor_Sabranan,2011-05-01T14:34Z,"Besides which, someone always extracts it and reposts it as a different torrent, usually very quickly.  I ususally download the compressed version then extract it and seed to the uncompressed one."
,mothymandinga,2011-05-04T15:44Z,Thanks for the upload. Takes 2 seconds to unrar!
,masterac,2011-05-07T11:31Z,does this one have the chess scene probleme just like the other torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6369967/The.Big.Bang.Theory.S04E22.720p.HDTV.x264-CTU ?
