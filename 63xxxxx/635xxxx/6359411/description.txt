Lost Nomad is a new breed of alternative/indie rock combining elements of funk, jazz, metal, reggae and punk with sultry vocals, intense melodies and liberating lyrics. The uniqueness of Lost Nomad music lies in its versatility; no two songs sound similar style-wise yet manage to remain groovy and catchy without sounding overcomplicated or non commercial.

Lost Nomad consists currently of just Diego Guzman, Spanish songwriter musician based in Manchester, UK. Born to Spanish parents in small multicultural Luxembourg, speaking four languages on a daily basis, watching over thirty European TV channels and hanging out with friends most of whom were of Mediterranean origins.
