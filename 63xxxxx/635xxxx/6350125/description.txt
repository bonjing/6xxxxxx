[b]Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D


Sources
Video: Russian DVD-9
Audio: 2 Lines (imagines + conebones)
thx to both

Encode: well that was a hell of work, Video got very nice looks like a blurayrip. 
Added brightness,sharpness,rgb and denoise.
There was a 10sec black bar at the top right in the middle of the film like on mechanic which i fixed, its not noticable now.
For the Audio i can proudly say now its a full clear line mixed from two lines.
both cleaned from the problems they had.
There was also a lot of voice in the russian sourround channels which i cleaned out too.
I synced the full line back to the r5, and entered it back into the russian 5.1 track.
Finally a fully complete lipsync version, which looks like a retail version now.
As always my audio will be 100% sync to all direct encodes of the russian dvd-9.

greetz and thx to OneTwo and Conebone for making this version possible.
