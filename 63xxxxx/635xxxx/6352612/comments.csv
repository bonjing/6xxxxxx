That and the more particular sites such as TorrentDay insist on it. They certainly seem to know what they're doing otherwise. Can anyone explain?"
,johnniebrasco,2011-04-29T06:29Z,"in my opinion all they do is save you a couple of mb space. But when you download 5-10 shows, it's quite annoying to have to unrar them all, most people have big disks too, so i dont see the point in raring anymore."
,johnniebrasco,2011-04-29T06:30Z,"when i download in rars i also delete the rars after unpacking, so i wont be able to seed. No such problem with unrared files."
,LFC_Seeds,2011-04-30T07:42Z,"rar's are okay in my opinion for big files, like 4gb+ mkv's and the huge 1080p rips but for single episodes it seems overkill to me."

The reason is that those seeders do not make the files by themselves, they download it using USENET because almost everything is released on USENET firts. And USENET is an old ""share method"" since 1980 so there is a limit of size of the file, so they can't upload a huge file, so they split them on alot of tiny files.

And the reason for .rar files on TORRENTS is that those torrents uploader are too lazy to even unpack the files downloaded from usenet and upload them on trackers as one big file."

then quality torrent sites such as TorrentDay would have some unrared files mixed also, but they don't permit them at all! There is a reason! "
