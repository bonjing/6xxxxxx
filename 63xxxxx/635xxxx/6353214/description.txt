Frankie Goes To Hollywood was possibly the ultimate in created new wave bands. They made a huge controversial splash, charted one of the most successful singles in the history of the UK and flaunted their homosexuality so blatantly that the Village People would have been proud. Welcome to the Pleasuredome was one of the biggest selling double albums in Europe. Frankie Say... T-Shirts were everywhere. FGTH meteoric rise and just as rapid fall is marked by songs that still sound as anthemic and ridiculously over the top as they did in 1984-86. They even managed to capture a classic song, in the hedonist anthem Relax. That is what Bang! captures.
