,ut_bhai,2011-06-13T22:06Z,dum! why dont you convert the files in mp3 format. it would reduce size. i would rather search an other download
,VicVega,2011-06-17T16:30Z,"@ut_bhai Because some of us like lossless audio. Do your research before calling ppl ""dum"", and you  won't look so stupid next time."
,ScoreGods,2011-07-14T01:59Z,thx for the quality upload!!! 
,Freksy,2011-08-21T17:54Z,"So many itune-junkies keep dumping their ""high quality"" 320kbps CBR rips all over the internetz, and it's annoying for us audiophiles. I fell for that trick already with this same OST - Horrible deep bass, that just seems to wobble and gurgle out of my speakers. Loud thuds and clashes that just sound like someone hitting a glass bottle and a hollow tube - Disgusting.
Good to see a quality upload of lossless quality mate, Cheers.

Have a good one."

This bit rate is double the max of .mp3 so you hater's go lick it up and convert your own gold to s#*t."

,mittec,2011-12-29T12:13Z,"Perfect! All the good years are included : ) Thanks mate, saved me a lot of time, hunting everything down in CD quality."
,blob76,2012-06-07T03:34Z,thanks for this quality upload...it's a shame that the majority has chosen quantity over quality.  Nothing like the original cd soundtrack quality.  Cheers to all you faithful audiophile listeners.
