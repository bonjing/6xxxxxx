These cold wet nights must have been invented to get a wood fire going and sprawl out with the blues. Something smooth and deep. I have seen this John Lee Hooker show as having taken place in Salzburg--and that just ain't so. This gig actually hails from the Aula Der Universitat in Koln. But it don't really matter where this one took place; it's a spot-on dose of Hooker on anybody's road-map.

John Lee's out in front of the Coast To Coast Blues Band for this outing, a line-up that featured Jim Kahr on guitar, Roger Brouse on bass, and Ken Swank on the drums. Kahr also handles vocal duties on As the Years Go Passing By. Kahr's guitar work for this gig, and especially this song, is tight and tasty indeed. 

But John Lee Hooker's at centre stage and he delivers a roughly half-hour set mixing live Hooker staples such as Crawlin Kingsnake and Serves Me Right to Suffer with juicy little rarities like Charles Brown's Black Night.

Time to turn the lights low and get you & your lady into something more comfortable. It's plenty warm in here. John Lee Hooker's in the house.
