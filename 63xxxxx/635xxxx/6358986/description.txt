Made for TV movie about a young skater dealing with the lure of big money sponsorships or staying true to his friends. This is the â€˜Disneyâ€™ version of what Airborne was doing back in the 90â€™s. 
Brink! is a 1998 Disney Channel Original Movie set in the backdrop of casual inline skating. Scenes from the film were shot at Malibu High School and Zuma Beach in Malibu, California.

Plot

Andy "Brink" Brinker and his in-line skating friends, who call themselves "Soul-Skaters" (meaning they skate for the fun of it, and not the money), clash with a group of sponsored skaters - Team X-Bladz. When Brink discovers his family is in financial trouble, he decides to go over to the dark side of skating and joins Team X-Bladz for 200 dollars a week. His friends, who don't know about Brink's situation, begin thinking of him as a sell-out. For a short while they will not even talk to him.

But, after Brink begins a job at a dog grooming shop named "Pup 'N Suds" he gets an advance in his paycheck enough to sponsor himself and his friends in a local competition under the name "Team Pup 'N Suds". Up until the competition day, his fellow teammates know nothing of his plan. On the day of the competition Brink reveals that he wants to sponsor his friends. They overcome their differences and realize that the only way to skate is with the help of Brink.

So, as friends once-again, they compete in the competition. At the end of the competition, it comes down to Brink and his rival, and former captain of X-Bladz, Val. Although Brink tries to skate fair, Val uses all of his dirty tricks to secure the win. However, these tricks do not work and Brink wins the race, and the competition.

Immediately after the race, Val is fired from X-Bladz. The owner of the team offers Brink the captain position of the team. But, being the great friend and team player he is, he decides to stick with his friends and remain a Soul-Skater.
