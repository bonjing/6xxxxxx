,Schredas,2011-08-03T22:04Z,A great program! Thanks! SEEDING 12/7!
,enectrixx,2011-08-10T20:23Z,"I don't know if my problem is caused by this program (it's most likely not since no one else seems to have the problem and TSV is Trusted), but a couple of hours after installing this an Internet Explorer window opened by itself with a page in russian asking me to buy some PC scanning software. Most likely wasn't caused by this, but still, it started at the same time as I installed this."
,xSchwarze,2011-08-18T08:56Z,"Don't download this, a script called wmplog05.sqv runs and tries to contact a server in Russia and/or Germany using IE or Firefox."
,Dragonuv,2011-08-27T05:17Z,"Ok, so im assuming i shouldn't use the uploader that this comes with, right?"
,tbraybrook,2011-08-27T08:39Z,Pass. Glad that people let you know it is bad. Anyone seeding this shouldn't because of that.
,seabass77,2011-08-30T03:13Z,"Do not download this.
It is the free version, and is completely useless.  Might be infected."
,oifwolf,2011-09-05T07:40Z,"I changed some numbers around from the one in the text file. I did have to unplug from the internet.

,Kirk04,2011-09-06T22:30Z,"I installed but it has malware in it Offensive IP Database
IP Reputation CardIP number	91.203.146.142
so before you install make sure you have an antivirus and malwarebytes installed. and then shut down start up program 1 with cc cleaner.  works great and suggest not to get updates."
,carlmb89,2011-09-13T22:04Z,"@ oifwolf

Thanks a lot man this worked after I updated to the latest version. Just make sure your not connected to the internet when you enter the license."
,djzimm,2011-09-28T00:34Z,"confirmed: installer runs internet explorer to connect to something. you can check that with PC Tools Firewall Plus, it will notify that the installer is trying to start iexplorer.exe with some parameters and right after, it notifies that internet explorer is trying to connect."
,flirtingwithlies,2011-10-19T23:06Z,The key wouldn't work for me. =[
,stacksrocks,2011-11-08T04:44Z,thanks oifwolf that worked great so far!
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2012-05-29T21:18Z,"I've had this on my pc for months. It asks if you want to update, say no and it works forever."
