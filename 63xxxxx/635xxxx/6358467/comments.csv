,explorerfreak,2011-05-01T09:15Z,cant leave comments now?
,noturbuddyfriend,2011-05-01T09:22Z,"if you watch a typical ufc it takes over an hour to watch the whole thing if you skip the commentary to the fights. My question is, why cant people have the courteous to atleast leave the torrent uploading as they watch the episode and create a seeder base and keep the sharing going the current DL rate indicates only a few decent ppl are seeding. Shorter version : need more seeds :("
,noturbuddyfriend,2011-05-01T09:24Z,if you watch a typical ufc it takes over an hour to watch the whole thing if you skip the commentary to the fights. It confuses me why  people cant have the courteousy to atleast leave the torrent uploading as they watch the episode and create a seeder base and keep the sharing going the current DL rate indicates only a few decent ppl are seeding. Shorter version : need more seeds :(

,zarathustra2k1,2011-05-01T09:33Z,"Btw, there's currently 115 seeds. 

Quit whining..."
,sativa0001,2011-05-01T09:43Z,"There are 7 seeders online out of a bit over 100 and tons of people connecting as peers with sharing disabled. The seeders can only be connected to so many users at once so the fact that youre not seeing any doesnt mean they're out there, people just need to keep the torrent hot so more seeders are available which will also improve the peer connections."
,tony4finger,2011-05-01T09:49Z,"thx a lot , downloader be patient , when 10000 people try to get a torrent when is just upload you have to know it will take times, depend also when you have seed box or no , in fews hour it will be fast like hell , take it easy and thx the uploader"

,johnjakob,2011-05-01T10:23Z,"Really, graham05...are you a complete douche bag or what?! If you just gave away the outcome of the fight you have to be the biggest f**king assh*le I have ever seen on here. Do you know what a spoiler is...and why the hell would anyone want to know the outcome of one of the biggest fights of the year before they see it?! Are you an effing IDIOT?!

BY the way, the butler did it, Darth Vader is Luke's father, Rosebud is his sleigh, your dad like to suck 2 cocks at once, and your mother was really good last night...and, yes, I am your father. That guy who lived with you and fuck*d your mom during the course of your life was just around to pay the bills and mow the lawn. It was I who was pleasuring your mom every night with my 12"" black dick!!!

YOU FUCKING DILDO!!!"
,davethemack,2011-05-01T10:27Z,"graham5, thanks for ruining all of ufc 129.  What kind of dumb matha fcka posts who won all the fights.  It is a good thing that I cant track you down because it I could Id smack you for being so stupid, then id smack your mom for having you!!"

,ftfchris,2011-05-01T13:03Z,"I should've known. I was just so happy about this coming out that i didn't pay attention to the uploader. 

DibyaTPB is not reliable. He pulled this same shit before with UFC 128. He posted it and then disappeared without seeding. Came back later and actually seeded and said something about computer problems i think. After that there was no problems but it was still a headache.

Would think past experience would've prepared him this time around. 

Thanks for the attempted upload but wish i could actually finish one of your uploads without problems and on time. "
,anyaeden,2011-05-01T13:23Z,wish you prick bastards would fucking seed. nearly 20000 peers and not one seeder. stop being fucking greedy and share. is called file sharing for a reason. wankers

St Pierre is a great fighter but he got his ass kicked by this college student looking gay kid, although the jury did give the fight to St. Pierre, St Pierre was a mess after the fight. There was no ground game, just boxing. 

the best fight was  Aldo vs. that Canadian guy, the Canadian got a huge Hematoma on his forehead but kept on fighting."
,kingaggs,2011-05-04T09:02Z,"if you want to comment on the quality, go ahead, but how about not giving a running commentary on the fucking result for those of us that havnt seen it and are downloading it to enjoy it without knowing what has happend blow by fucking blow, you wanna talk about it with someone go search for a chat room for fucks sake"
