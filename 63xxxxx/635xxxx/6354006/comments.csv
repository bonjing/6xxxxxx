,jspyder24,2011-05-01T22:36Z,"America would go mad if the government ask us to pay for a family 2 ""represent"" the nation by living a luxurious life. Have multiple castle that they live in depending on the season and whenever bored they perform ""royal visits"". At least America's queen, Oprah Winfrey worked her arse off for every brick that build her castle in California. 
How is a family living a billionaires lifestyle for FREE good 4 the nation and its subjects? That have produced no art, made no contributions to science. They receive the BEST education, but do not pursue careers. What do they do on a daily basis? Im really curious. They are not even encouraged 2 get jobs. Princess Diana went to fucking Africa to help the children who lost limbs from land mines because she was bored to tears living in London. I think the Royals should get jobs and not think they ARE doing something because they have to entertain foreign dignitaries, or host dinners, or host charities. That is what the Prime Minister's wife is for!"
