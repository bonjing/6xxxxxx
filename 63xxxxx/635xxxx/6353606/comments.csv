,Judirek,2012-02-10T18:13Z,"@dada_sh I downloaded this torrent, downloaded the autorun remover from the official site after registering this to full version I plugged in the USB flashdrive to my port then It detected recycler, autorun.inf, etc. so I chose the the third options that ""cleans infected files and open USB flashdrive"" then when I safely remove the USB flashdrive and as of curiosity I tried plugging it again and it still detects a threat meaning it didn't remove the infections maybe it only opened it safely? or do I need to reboot my computer for it to completely work? I've updated it already btw thanks for this great torrent."
