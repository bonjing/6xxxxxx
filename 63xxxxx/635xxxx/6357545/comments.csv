[V],r3dcat,2011-05-07T15:07Z,"@ExtraTorrentRG Thank you for this post ... can I just suggest that adding ""3D HALF-SBS"" to the title would help with clarity and search indexing ;) ... much appreciated ... cheers"
,shammyshoo,2011-05-08T17:54Z,"Looks good, but I can't play it on my PS3. Is it due to it having 5.1 audio? Anyone had luck with this? On a Mac, so PMS won't transcode on the fly. Thanks."
,cheatsforme,2011-05-10T23:14Z,"A1 thanks for the up
Just a note to some, not one of my players would play this file (nvidiaplayer, stereoscopicplayer, powerdvd, totalmedia), until i converted it to mkv which only took a couple of minutes using mkv merge, then it played fine and great 3d."
,elvantin,2011-05-19T22:32Z,"Gents, would you please tell me how to watch this movie in 3D? i have ""Master Image"" eyeglasses and i don't know any codec or software to sync the two images and make it 3d movie (i'm using a PC, an LCD monitor and and LCD HD TV, but none of them with ""3d nativeness"")... i'm newbie in this 3d stuff... i got the eyeglasses from cinema...
Thanks in advance"
,zohaad,2011-08-05T18:45Z,"@ shammyshoo use mkv2vob v2.4.9 PS3 Video Converter by 3r1c , you can also edit the audio codec. works fine for me"
