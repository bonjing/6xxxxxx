,bevermahn,2011-05-17T17:27Z," First THANKS FOR THE UP!!!!!

 the package of data seems to be complete. the software is located on the disc ""STW2009B"" the program sucsesfully   installed: cat sis, elec.tech.,CBT Data Network,Cbt Web, and service report on my machine.
the keygen won't generate a license key=  "" error!- Bad Len ""

If somebody can translate the contents of the file ""ÑƒÑÑ‚Ð°Ð½Ð¾Ð²ÐºÐ°.txt "" maybe the key is in there.
Or if someone has a key or suggestions -post them here for all to see"

The Keygen works, but you have to insert the key without the ""SS"" (the first two letters)

enjoy it

,Parcero,2011-06-04T18:19Z,"Hola Bevermahn

one thing more...

this txt in russian language... i don't know...

but there is a keyuserfile in ""cat.user.rar"" called ""sisuser_General_R.xml"" and you have to import this file in SIS when you start it for the first time, do it with ""import users""

remember: after this, you have a new user in SIS, called ""sisuser"" and his password is ""master""

Friends of mine, working all day's with this Software and it works supeeer....

Enjoy it

,Chompiras,2011-06-16T23:11Z,"Hey I had problems with the ÑƒÑÑ‚Ð°Ð½Ð¾Ð²ÐºÐ° txt file so here is a direct translation from google
INSTALLER
01. Install the disc STW 2009B, select the language English.
02. Install the disc RERR0001, select the language English.
After the installation reboot.

03. Run the program with a shortcut SIS.
04. Once launched, a window to activate, copy License Code without the letters ""SS"".
05. a) Run the keygen. In the top line and insert the keygen-License Code, this SISom, I repeat, NOT the first letters ""SS""!
   b) The second line keygena choose JERD 2129 FULL Service Dealer ET.
   c) Click Generate, the generated code is inserted into the program.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Install and configure in Internet Explorer. Work in other browsers can not be guaranteed (for example, in the
 Opera ""no pictures"", because it does not automatically ustanovlivaetsya module view).

06. Next start SIS. If successful, the server starts in the lower right corner of the tray icon appears yellow. Perhaps, if 
already at the start of the program will be asked to import the users (I immediately curled up in the tray). Click on the 
yellow icon in the tray, right-click, choose ""Import Users"", in the dialog box specify the path to the file and click 
sisuser_General_R.xml Load. Wait until the boot ... In the next window, select the checkbox and click user ""Import"".
07. We go into the program with the data:

    Login ID: sisuser
    Password: master

08. Agree to ""View License Agreement"", select any value ""Use the System to conduct your business"" and click ""YES""
09. In the next window to the question ""Do you want to start the SIS integration functionality?"" answer ""No""


10. To permanently change is not DVD-drives, the required data can be copied to the HDD, each disk in a separate folder.
 After running the configurator and put the path (the button ADD) to each disk separately. Reload this SIS.

Note: If no pictures, so do not you started DjVu Control Module. Allow active content with the appearance of 
sootvetstvuyuschgo message."
,Chompiras,2011-06-20T05:25Z,"Just to let everyone know the program works great. The Keygeneratot has a virus so keep in mind what machine you install the program on or simply run the keygen on a different computer and copy paste the license.

There ist an Folder named ""CAT.USER"" and inside you have a XML files called ""sisuser_General_R.xml""

In the login page from SIS, you have to import that file, so you have access to SIS with:
USER: sisuser
PASSWORD: master

Sincerely
