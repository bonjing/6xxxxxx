The Chicago Underground Duo, with Rob Mazurek on cornet and Chad Taylor on
percussion, vibes and keyboards, is one of the many incarnations of the Chicago
Underground Collective, besides the Trio and Quartet. This is a duo album, but
because of the overdubs you sometimes have more than two instruments playing
together, sculpting sounds and themes that some would call "post jazz", because
it borrows from so many styles and techniques that the term jazz is no longer
descriptive. Hence the title "Boca Negra", which means â€œBlack Mouthâ€, a term
coined in the Tenerife Canary Islands evoking the idea of an endless intake of
information and also harks to the mouth of the volcano Tiede. In any case, it is
again a fantastic album. The two musicians do not shy away from complexity,
including shifting time signatures, odd rhythms, and sound explorations, with
clever use of electronics, although the entire albums is quite accessible and
very rhythmic.It all sounds simple, but it isn't. The greatest effect is created
on Ornette Coleman's "Broken Shadows", on which Taylor plays drums and vibes
simultaneously, the theme of which I did not immediately recognize when I first
listened to it, but then I came to realise that the men broke down the theme
into different parts, with one musician stopping, and the other one taking over,
creating the real effect of broken shadows. The compositions combine atmosphere
with drive, with playfulness, with repetitive minimalism, with meditative
moments, with avant-garde adventure, ... the whole thing full of creative
inventiveness, but above all, Mazurek's excellent playing of the cornet and Chad
Taylor's excellent drumming. And a great production by Matt Lux.
Highly recommended.
