,capturetwist,2011-05-17T17:45Z,"Thanks to the uploader.  It is the best cam, maybe it is a lot darker and some scenes are hardly watchable because it is too dark.
It has great audio for a cam, though. The resolution it is a little blurred to."
,maggyefs,2011-05-22T04:29Z,"it's ok, can be watched.
image is a bit dark and blurry, but i guess this is ordinary for cam.
 i'd say audio is about 7/10 and video 5/10.
but thanks anyway for the upload."
,Laddie418,2011-07-16T05:12Z,My fault for not knowing what CAM meant.  Was expecting a nice high quality burn.  This wasn't it.  Still appreciate you putting it out there.
