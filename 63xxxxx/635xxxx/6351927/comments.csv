,netfire_,2011-05-06T22:55Z,"Almost perfect. Only thing is episode 201 is a TV rip. I assume FaMoUz saw the dvd version was censored, and replaced it with a tv rip, problem is the tv rip is censored, actually slightly worse than the dvd version."
,netfire_,2011-05-06T23:40Z,"er... never mind, that was for the other south park season 14 high def torrent."

,ViolentC,2012-02-02T07:42Z,"Lame... Ep.6 ""201"" IS NOT UNCENSORED Like the Title says. I was hoping by the time they put this out on DVD they would have sorted out the censorship issue's so we could actually watch this episode. FCC Nerfbat bashed this one so much it's more bleeps than dialog. totally unwatchable Episode.
Not the fault of the uploader / Genuine, High Quality HD torrent. "
