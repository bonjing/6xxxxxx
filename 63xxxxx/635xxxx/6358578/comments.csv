,cfitz94,2011-05-03T20:51Z,"How do I get McAfee to stop auto deleting the RedRiverLauncherc.exe file when I try copying it over into the folder from the RAR?

With the crack from RELOADED,
I am able to temporarily play the game when I turn off Real Time Scanning, but I would rather have that on for safety purposes. I cannot find an option to ""ignore"" a file or ""trust"" a file from scans.
(I presume this is the same crack as RELOADED?)

Any help would be appreciated."
