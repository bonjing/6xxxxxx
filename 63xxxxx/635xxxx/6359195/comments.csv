,marshal_law,2011-05-01T16:57Z,you earned your patch so this must be real but the only question is : does this show half the screen or the hole screen?
[T],razvanripper,2011-05-01T16:59Z,Its better than others
,KoRnHoLiOx,2011-05-01T19:05Z,"in other words, this is the same copy as the rest but he wants you to download to find out, he already has another upload of the same crap, makes the sample look good but its not"
,sidsolid,2011-05-01T19:15Z,sample has full screen
,KoRnHoLiOx,2011-05-01T20:11Z,"I retract my previous statement, SAFCuk009 does have a good copy posted on TPB so if razvanripper ripped him off then this one is probably good."
,marshal_law,2011-05-02T02:42Z,"OK 

the good news is it is a full screen
the bad news is now the camera man cant keep still at the end and the start of the movie but that's not as bad as half a screen its way better thanks razvanripper or safcuko09 or who ever put this together much appreciated. 

well every body looking for a full screen here it is.

quality the same or a bit better then the half screen but this one is full screen.

worth the download.

well its the best so far so jump in.

During the daytime scenes and well lit scenes very good quality,  During night scenes pretty much Black and hard too see the action. Well done and thanks too razvanripper for a good quality cam.
Scored on cam basis not dvdrip
A: 7
V: 6

Worth watching if you really wanna see this film."

,steve9938,2011-05-14T23:40Z,"FANTASTIC COPY FOR CAM!!!                            very good quality in the daylight parts of the film, slightly hard to see detail in the darker parts... but overall very  watchable                     A-8 V-8  "
,csmuthu,2011-05-15T04:53Z,waiting for r5 or dvdrip
,lilkiss,2011-05-17T04:01Z,appreciate it
,Garooza,2011-05-24T06:53Z,good copy accept for the fact that it's low quality camera man must not have checked his angle. THX for wasting my time with this B.S. oh yeah and gj trying to re post this like were not gonna know the difference. What  did you do get your patch on a bunch of DVD rips and push this B.S. on your supporters i normally don't bash but seriously we all expected a little more from a VIP. 
,fast_five,2011-05-24T17:53Z,is this really a good copy? please tell me..i can't wait to watch it!
