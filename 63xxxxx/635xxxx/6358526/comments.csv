,paradox2011,2011-05-01T09:07Z,is this same as the rest ? half the picture missing ? cant check screen shots ether :( 
,ashrealms,2011-05-01T09:16Z,"This has been up for all of 30 minutes and the screenshots are already banned? I'm guessing this is another version of the crappy 2/3's screen release that everyone else is ""releasing"". Doesn't anyone get thier own source anymore or do all of you ""groups"" just gank the first copy that's released and claim it as your own? :P"
[V],SAFCukO09,2011-05-01T09:25Z,No not the same copy different source
,RGBeffect,2011-05-01T09:43Z,"Why does anyone put their time in to half a screen.  I produce video for my job, and I tell you this is a waste of your time!  People don't buy half a TV, hence why would they ever want to watch half a screen.  I agree with @ashrealms.  Quit copying people, do your own thing or you won't amount to anything!"
,d246115,2011-05-01T10:02Z,"Is this the full movie? I heard there was something extra after the credits. Run time on here says, an hour and 56 minutes but the official run time is supposed to be 2 hours 10 minutes. Also, thank you for taking the time to upload :)"
[V],SAFCukO09,2011-05-01T10:05Z,ffs its not half screen
,NinjaFurion,2011-05-01T10:23Z,"Sample looks good
@ashrealms and RGBeffect
take time to DL the sample b4 assuming a VIP member is just delivering the same stuff.  There is a reason SAFC took so long to get a copy of fast five up, cuz he don't put up BS.  

Sample looks bout same quality as the half screens, just looks like its got the full screen.
v8.5A9 on a cam scale (just from sample)
v4A6 on DVD scale   

DL the sample first and check it out for urself, but Im pleased
Thanks again SAFC"
,masterasm,2011-05-01T13:31Z,"thanks, compared this Sample to the one @ IMAGiNE's V2.. I think this one's better so i'll grab it, thanks :D"
,awesomedom,2011-05-01T15:04Z,"Thanx SAFCuk009 .

The original run time is 2.10 hours with some scenes after credits ."
,UrbanS0ldi3r,2011-05-01T15:10Z,its the same copy with 1/4 of screen missing 
,welhung,2011-05-01T16:54Z,"I just getting this started 

I have the first half screen release and put it on a disc looked ok watched it then threw it away! I'd say on that version V=6.5"
,marshal_law,2011-05-01T17:52Z,OK so far ninjafurion and safcuko09 say its full screen and urbansoldier says half screen ill wait for more voters 
,simaozinho26,2011-05-01T18:21Z,you copy this from globe
[V],SAFCukO09,2011-05-01T18:57Z,copy from globe dont make me laugh i got it direct from IMAGiNE .... way before all these v2s were ever released
,KoRnHoLiOx,2011-05-01T20:02Z,"I have downloaded and watched, this is a different copy from the others. YOU CAN SEE THE WHOLE SCREEN, ALL SUBTITLES, best copy so far! Thank you very much!!!!"
,dramallama813,2011-05-01T20:40Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD, SAME COPY AS OTHER SOURCES.

Half the fucking screen is cut off. Stupid faggot"
,ashrealms,2011-05-01T20:50Z,"I apologize, but the banned screenshots triggered my torrent-nerd-rage button after seeing 15 other samples that didn't show any half-screens but were that way when downloaded.

Thank you for uploading a good one and to hell with the other idiots who keep re-torrenting the same shit."
,dashingguyof2k,2011-05-01T21:17Z,"please upload THOR , with good print if possible or atleast a better cam print its a request peace**"
,KoRnHoLiOx,2011-05-01T22:38Z,"this one starts off like it is missing screen but is NOT, camera moves around a couple times and there is a splice of the bad copy in the middle for like 15 seconds for a camera switch or something, but very watchable"
,ixlr8nxs,2011-05-02T01:06Z,Imageshack blocks any links from TPB.  So just copy the link and paste it in a new window and you can see the screenshot just fine.
,Grand-Grimoire,2011-05-02T01:38Z,Love the shit you put out...never an issue at all every one is a kiler rip/cam/dvd /what-the-fuckever...Keep up the killer work
,micky63,2011-05-02T02:13Z,"saw this last night, and this is actually a great copy for 2nd DOR... I'll burn this for now and get a screener or BDRip later...don't forget to right click on the link for the screens people..
 Thanks for the quick, but good up SAFCuk009  :)"
,nzguy_1nz,2011-05-02T05:23Z,finely i can see the hole screen thank you good down load v5 a5
,cliff36033,2011-05-02T12:18Z,the same as all the rest right side missing
,wensis,2011-05-02T21:01Z,"@SAFCukO09

Does your mother know, you are a liar? I mean maybe mental health care is not such a bad idea?

Please stop telling b*llsh*t and post what you preach.. -_-,.."
,downloader979,2011-05-03T00:06Z,"Best one I've seen so far, though, in the interest of full disclosure, it is only the third I've looked at. 
This seems to be the entire screen, so I have no idea what you guys are wining about- it is a different source than the others.
Just a little grainy, but decent for pre-dvd.

A:6
V:5"
,downloader979,2011-05-03T00:28Z,"I was wrong- the sample was a bit misleading- yes, part of the screen is cut off, but still very watchable!"
,D_A7,2011-05-03T02:41Z,"Same shit as others .

Half a screen is missing ."
