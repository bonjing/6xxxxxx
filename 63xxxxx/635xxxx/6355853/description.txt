Ron Paul tried a run for President once already, and sparked a new wave of  awareness of libertarian ideas. Though ultimately unsuccessful in achieving the Republican nomination, many more have since heard his message. With a renewed swell of support possibly and hopefully more numerous than ever before, he has been pushed and convinced to try again in 2012.

What is his platform? John Stossel discusses Ron Paul's ideas, a progressive tries to convince him to run as an independent instead, and even 'The President' stops by to debate him.

I had never heard of Ron Paul then, but the groundswell generated in large measure by Paul's previous presidential run has since helped give rise to the so-called Tea Party movement. And also to the election of a growing core of new faces in Congress who are sympathetic to the libertarian model of governing.

Republican spoiler candidate Donald Trump doesn't think so, but clearly more are convinced now that the atmosphere better now to see a new sort of candidate elected President, offering a style of leadership in both foreign and domestic affairs that is something not seen in this nation since perhaps the time of Grover Cleveland.
