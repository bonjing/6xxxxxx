,Chadly,2011-04-30T23:05Z,Fiberoptica is just upset cause no one will download his virus's lol Poor Fiberoptica lol idiot/losser
,ghostridr,2011-04-30T23:16Z,fiberoptica = sub-contractor with no benefits hired by RIAA to submissively misdirect noob users from downloading good torrents from well known seeders such as .BONE.
,tiltswitch,2011-05-01T10:01Z,"wtf?...ur an idiot,thats wtf."
[V],.BONE.,2011-05-01T12:41Z,@pantagana if u never noticed fxg has nfo subs ect in his upload that makes up the .15
,JayDomSpacePirate,2011-05-01T13:08Z,"let's do some math. BONE 100 pages of uploads, FiberFagita 0."
,PNWpirate,2011-05-01T22:43Z,"Here is the real FXG torrent for this movie.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6348306/The_Sunset_Limited%5B2011%5DDvDrip%5BEng%5D-FXG
Make sure you are downloading from true FXG torrents for the best!"
,Yberman33,2011-05-01T22:46Z,Havent dowloaded this yet but aill always trust a bone upload. Because I have never been given a reason not to. Every upload i ever dowloaded frome Bone has been clean and good.
,AlexSupertrampOriginal,2011-05-02T12:08Z,"Yep, Bone is da Man! 
And who gives a flying f**k who uploads it? FXG also uploads quality movies. So what? If you want everything to be organized and neat, go to Blockbuster and rent the damn movie! Dumbass.

And yeah, fiberoptia is prob an MPAA lackey. Same as the idiots who have been trying to overwhelm TPB with tons of fake uploads. But they don't have the skulls! Losers...."
,AlexSupertrampOriginal,2011-05-02T12:15Z,"Oh, just realized this is that movie about two old geezers arguing about religion in a beat up old apartment. Pass this time, thanks anyway."
,johnvlaxos,2011-11-10T22:47Z,thank
