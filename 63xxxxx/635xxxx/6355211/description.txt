The Avant Garde Project is a series of 20th-century classical, experimental, and electroacoustic torrents digitized from LPs whose music has in most cases never been released on CD, and so is effectively inaccessible to the vast majority of music listeners today. This is wild stuff, so check it out if you've never heard this sort of music before. The analog rig used to extract the sound from the grooves is near state-of-the-art, producing almost none of the tracking distortion or surface noise normally associated with LPs.

AGP1-157 are available for direct download at

AGP148-175 are now available at http://ubu.com/sound/agp/index.html

AGP169-175 are also available at http://thepiratebay.org/user/human2011

NOTE: All of the AGP installments since 163 are 24-bit, 44.1 kHz FLAC files. The extra bits of quantization reveal more realistic detail using a 24-bit DAC and good audio equipment. To burn these tracks to CD, you will first have to convert them to 16-bit files. This is easily done using the converter tool in Foobar2000 or other software.

=======================================

AGP176 is the first of two featuring music played on the Ondes Martenot--one of the first electronic instruments, invented by Maurice Martenot in 1928. The Wikipedia article on the instrument has some nice information and pictures.

The LP transcribed for AGP176 was released in 1980 on disques Ades (14.036) and has not to my knowledge ever been re-issued on CD. The recordings are brilliant and detailed, and the pressing is clean, but the sounds are complex enough to pose a serious challenge to any phono cartridge. I would have included these recordings in the AGP earlier, but I could never get this LP to track without considerable distortion using my previous phono cartridge. Even with the impressively well-tracking Linn Akiva, I had to increase the force on the stylus from the usual 1.8g to 1.9g, and still there is a non-trivial amount of tracking distortion in the last track of side A (track 05 in this installment), and just a bit in tracks 06 and 07. Sorry about that, but otherwise the transcription is a joy to listen to. 

The installment includes a PDF file with scans of the notes on the cover of this LP and the LP transcribed for AGP177, including information on the composers, works, and performers.
