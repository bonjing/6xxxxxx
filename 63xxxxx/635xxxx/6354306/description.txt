Tab Benoit is a master of swampy, rootsy New Orleans music -- steeped in bayou blues and Louisiana rhythms. He's been playing the music for years, and just seems to keep getting better.
Benoit co-wrote seven of the 11 tracks here with his co-producer, Anders Osborne, who also share some guitar duties. But the result is all framed by Benoit's tough, gritty vocals and sharply focused guitar.
The title track, which actually leads off the album, is a deep and dark tribute to music as the medicine that heals the soul. Benoit's guitar crackles around the growling lyrics, and sets the tone for everything that follows. And what follows is an outstanding set of finely crafted songs sung with considerable passion, perfectly played by a tight band that powers the groove effortlessly beneath each song; always crisp, never interfering.
This is one of those albums without a false note or a throwaway track --  a musical gem from the roots of some of America's finest music. Enjoy it.[/color]
