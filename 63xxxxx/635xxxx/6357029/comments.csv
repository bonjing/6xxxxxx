try handbreak..
can convert to m4v mp4 & mkv.
it's good & easy

@holyroses..
what would you say... to give a try doing rips in 480p x264 - MP4 format... as i've heard, it also support in psp stuff (not 100% sure) 
but.. it makes the rips much more- clear...
and helpfull for guys lime me.. come here to use psp rips on PC as we got low downloading rats (50kbps here.. as in real)

so.. what's the reply...
i know you would say no...
but... just think about it.. okey?
tnx for the great work
have a good day

&... how about a facebook fanpage ?"
