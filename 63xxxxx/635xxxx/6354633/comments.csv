PS: you fucks in Romania and Germany are faggots for downloading 100% and then not seeding"
,robbo19,2011-04-29T22:51Z,Got this from somewhere else yesterday.Same old shit as before.Missing a load from the right hand side of the screen.

,soccerguy421,2011-04-30T20:14Z,"I'm sorta new to all this' but why do so many people load the same cam copy? I understand why these teams load different cams and different copys of a movie but with this movie theirs 17 pages worth of the same half the screen missing the ending movie' I'm not a cam snob don't mind to watch the cams at all but when you cant seen almost half the screen and the end of the movie is missing i don't care how good everything else is, the movie is going to be awful.
