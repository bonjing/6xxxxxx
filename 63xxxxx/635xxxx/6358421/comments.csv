The film is directed by Sean McNamara, who based the screenplay on Hamilton's biographical book of the same name and on filmmakers' interviews with the family. The title is a word play on the term soul surfer, coined in the 1960s to denote someone who surfs purely for pleasure. AnnaSophia Robb stars as Hamilton, and Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt star as Hamilton's parents."

Bethany Hamilton (AnnaSophia Robb) is a teenager who lives in Kauai, Hawaii with her parents Tom (Dennis Quaid) and Cheri (Helen Hunt), and two older brothers. All are surfers, but Bethany and her best friend Alana Blanchard have grown up with a passion for the sport and enter a competition. Bethany's church youth ministry leader, Sarah Hill (Carrie Underwood), is disappointed when Bethany has to withdraw from a planned missions trip because of the contest. Bethany and Alana place first and third, respectively, while the second place winner, Malina Birch (Sonya Balmores), proves a fierce rival to Bethany. Bethany invites both girls up on the winner's box with her, but Malina ungraciously refuses. The Rip Curl surfwear company offers to sponsor Bethany and Alana in competition, in return for an advertising contract."
