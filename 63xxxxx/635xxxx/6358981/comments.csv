,Comoc4t,2011-05-02T23:43Z,"Yep, its the same file as the other guy, which torrent got deleted. A moderator, please delete this one. Virusses and fake game included here."
,Comoc4t,2011-05-03T00:11Z,"Yep, fake."
,In_Da_Club,2011-05-03T15:59Z,"Ignore previous comments, this game works like a charm, here is a quick >how to< install guide for dummies (yes, lots of dumb kids who got no clue how to install game are browsing this site misleading others).
1. Unpack files with WinRAR or 7zip
2. Mount .iso file with daemon tools lite
3. Install optional software like directx and .net platform
4. Copy cracked content from .iso file located in  Tiny(something) folder into game directory
5. Play"
,waterbong,2011-05-04T08:28Z,I don't know if it's fake or not but I downloaded it twice and tried to install it twice and each time the same file says it's corrupted and won't install.
,devrindare,2011-05-04T16:24Z,what a shame no seeders for a skidrow release
,danii555,2011-05-04T16:41Z,Hmm... I'll try to download it and get it to work.
,Pokler,2011-05-04T20:20Z,"Obvious fake.

Don't listen to people calling it fake or not fake (yes, don't listen to me either).

Just think logically and do a bit of research.

You'll find there isn't even a Skidrow release of this game, because TinyISO released it in the scene and THETA on p2p.

By that alone this is a suspicious torrent not worth the risk downloading. If it contains a well hidden trojan your anti virus program can not find you are fucked."
,In_Da_Club,2011-05-05T11:56Z,"Lol at Pokler, who thinks he got it all figured it out. While it may be true that this isnt Skidrow release (it's tinyiso release), it's clean and legitimate game, i am playing it right now and laughing my ass off to all the conspiracy theories while this game is less then 1GB and takes less then 30 mins to download and see it your self, and no one is mentioning the fact why the torrent is still not removed from site(?), seriously, duh."
,metalmatt13,2011-05-06T01:23Z,"Well I'm gonna download this and scan it to make sure its clean. I don't trust ""In_Da_Club"" just because he is saying it's clean. He might as well be sneak_shot. "
,ikbenolaf2,2011-05-06T14:53Z,"indeed, fake as hell. downloaded, installed cracked and doesn't work (capsized encountered an error and needs to close) doesn't work without crack either, same error. scanned with avast, said it's clean. now scanning whole pc hoping theres no virus ;) if you don't want to, don't listen to me and install, just know it doesn't work."
,sneak_shot,2011-05-06T14:54Z,GUYS IVE PLAYED IT ITS WORKIN
,dcsn1p3rx,2011-05-07T03:13Z,idiots this is not a virus don't listen to them. Works perfect guys. This game kinda sucks though.
,telep_man,2011-05-08T16:37Z,Works perfectly fine. The installation is as simple as any other pirated game and avast didn't sound any alarm. I think that's all the info you need.
,dr904,2011-05-09T13:47Z,"Not fake! It works! But you need to install Microsoft XNA Framework.

Everyone that says this is fake, is a dumb ass!"
,ratcrib,2011-05-10T01:31Z,"works. follow instructions and don't freak out. every single antivirus will think cracks, keygens and custom installs are viruses; so just ignore.

awesome game. buy it from steam to support small developer."
,xambo,2011-05-10T17:58Z,"Works Great 100%

Install, then copy crack from TiNyiso and paste it into Alientrap Games...Capsized.
