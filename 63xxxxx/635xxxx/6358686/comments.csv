,mick661,2011-05-01T12:09Z,thankyou  you bastards
,anyaeden,2011-05-01T13:25Z,thankyou SAFCukO09 for the upload. really need people to seed though. stop grabbing and running guys and share. Once i have this downloaded I will seed until ufc 30.
,Buck.Nasty,2011-05-01T14:17Z,Most people are seeding I guess. Average d/l speed 1.4 MB/s and u/l 421 kB/s at 100% mark. Will continue to seed.
,Drake9669,2011-05-01T14:39Z,"D/L speed here is between 10 kb/s and 15 kb/s. Should have it all in about 12 WEEKS!!! Please seed, people! Don't cut and run, share and share alike!"
,aesophop,2011-05-01T16:34Z,"your mother sucks cocks in hell, fucking leechers, WASTE OF TIME SHIT GOES 2kb/s"
,Dj8218521,2011-05-01T18:47Z,I've been using bit torrent for awhile now but i never registered with any of the site's till now and i dont really understand why its so important to seed the file ? I normally just move files to my TB and delete . Should i not ?
,carlski76,2011-05-01T20:59Z,took me over 12 hours to dl this.it wont play through my xbox like usual and the sound is off.
,Drake9669,2011-05-01T21:44Z,"No, DJ, you certainly should not. That's called leeching. You take it, then delete the torrent once you have it. Meanwhile every other person out there that's still trying to d/l it (Peers) is stuck with one less person to seed to them the completed file. I've been seeding since I finished my download, and will continue to seed for at least a week."
,Drake9669,2011-05-01T21:51Z,"There is no sound.

V=10
A=0 (Cuz it doesn't f***ing work!!!)"
,c3bhm,2011-05-02T02:00Z,"WHAT'S UP WITH THIS FILE FORMAT?? ""X264"" BUT AN .AVI FILE? NEEDS TO BE A .MP4 FILE, OTHERWISE THIS IS A WASTE OF BANDWIDTH FOR LESSER QUALITY VIDEO. PLEASE CHANGE TO .MP4 IN THE FUTURE..."
,unknown_skyla,2011-05-02T10:37Z,Why is that part one plays perfectly for me...yet part two needs some sort of special codec? Can someone please help me with what codec is needed for part two?!
,RBShea,2011-05-02T14:22Z,"Works fine on KMPlayer.

V/9
A/9

Downloaded in a few hours, will seed for a day or two. Thanks for getting it uploaded so quick!"
,rocketman1970,2011-05-02T16:34Z,"Ok Gentleman, you need to dig around a little bit to get what you want. Yea it takes time and a little work. Just because a torrent has a shit load of hits doesn't mean it's the best one. Here's where I got my ufc 129. It's perfect in everyway. Has good download speed too. Go here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6358776/UFC_129 Download it and quit your bitchin."
,lobo345,2011-05-02T23:28Z,Had green flashing video in Media Player Classic. Windows 7 default Media Player work ok though.
,aguila9,2011-05-04T01:08Z,"Excellent. A/10...V8/10...
