If you want to update crysis 2 to v1.4 just replase the ""crysis 2.exe"" to the orginal and update automatic.
We need ""CRACK v.1.4""!!! "
[T],rlf-rls,2011-04-30T21:45Z,"Shut the fuck up take it or leave it. It is 1.4 version and its works for me, btw i don't care what you need."
,flamemc1,2011-04-30T21:50Z,"you dont need a crack with this, just install and play.  Ive tested it and it works fine."
,flamemc1,2011-04-30T21:51Z,"ps, thanks for the up."
,robalm,2011-04-30T22:00Z,"Dude im sorry, I didnt know it was ""precracked"""
,robalm,2011-04-30T22:04Z,"rlf-rls

So please do not tell me to shut up."

,knox666,2011-04-30T22:35Z,@ Robalm still no reason to be such a douche see the crossbones? He knows what he is doing and plus what about being a person with honour and self respect and do not resort to name calling to begin with especially something that is free and not a big deal anyway. Pick your battles wisely people do not even you deserve such treatment. Unless it is worthwhile to do so. Thanks for the up bro more great work yet again.

,walksonpoo,2011-05-01T00:39Z,"Installed and launches without issue, but still says any CDKEY i use is not valid."
,ChiliNoMoreX,2011-05-01T00:55Z,"MultiPlayer not working, so it's useless if want to play online."
,robalm,2011-05-01T01:42Z,"Multiplayer works from about 17:00 to 01:00.
Just type a key, like this-->
J7G5-0KJ7-JK4E-M8GF-F74D "
[T],rlf-rls,2011-05-01T02:03Z,Multiplayer works perfect for me. So it must be problem with your game 
,walksonpoo,2011-05-01T02:08Z,And which timezone are you referring to.....i seriously doubt this will work.
,Rando_q1,2011-05-01T11:21Z,rlf can u upload or make nfs shift 2 1.01 patch and crack? tnx for this crysis update...
,irishboyblue,2011-05-01T12:56Z,you the fooking man finaly got it working but i had to use the very 1st pw from the ist update orther pw dont work just the one u started wiv bk then !  rlf-rls dont know how u did but u did ty nuff love ! 
,s3nr1,2011-05-02T04:21Z,"rlf u dumbass tell people it's a limited time multiplayer, instead of ""working fine"". the cdkey checks stops from +-17h to +-23h Gmt/Utc+1 but can also starts earlier. 

This is probably because C2 MP is shit and they need all the players they can get for popularity sake, legal or illegal players."
,brianxxx,2011-05-02T12:03Z,"@s3nr1

1st - Shut the fuck up.
2nd - You know nothing.
3rd - most of these online MP cracks are limited like that and the times can change.
4th - Go buy the fucking game if you don't like it here.
5th - Crying bitches are not wanted here."
[T],rlf-rls,2011-05-02T13:10Z,brianxxx  THANKS  :) Cheers for all u guys :)

,PistonFistin,2011-05-07T14:26Z,"I'd appreciate some help, I keep getting what I presume is an error message when I click next on the screen in which you choose the file directory during installation. Any ideas?"
,cirios8300,2011-05-08T11:46Z,"PistonFistin

I think you have to put original ''Crysis2.exe'' file version 1.0 in game folder before try to install patch."
,ozzy_khan94,2011-05-12T23:27Z,Not working for me.
