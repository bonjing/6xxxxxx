,bharatrn,2011-04-29T20:17Z,Will you be doing Kes?
[V],aoloffline,2011-04-30T00:10Z,Yes i intend to..i hold up scene release(movee) cos i don't think has the right resolution
[V],GoodFilms,2011-04-30T01:38Z,1200x720 is the right resolution (for Kes)
[V],aoloffline,2011-04-30T16:04Z,chdbits has the criterion bluray for some time & the encodes..their 720p is 1280 x 768 ..i'm no expert..would rather trust them..than scene
,bharatrn,2011-04-30T17:18Z,Okay.Thanks :)
[V],GoodFilms,2011-05-03T13:37Z,"1280x768 is not technically 720p, but I'm gonna upload the CHD release anyway."
