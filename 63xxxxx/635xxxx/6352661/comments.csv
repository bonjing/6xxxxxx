,mrdoubleb,2011-04-30T16:35Z,"Again, one of those new mkv files where they've changed the encoding somehow. This has been going on for the past week or two...

I have no audio using my Samsung TV's mediaplayer, and even MKVmerge can't fix it. (Just gives choppy audio).
(Normally the TV plays DD 5.1 with every MKV i download)

Why are you guys changing the encoding?"
