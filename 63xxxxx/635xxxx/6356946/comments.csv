,redd79,2011-08-04T20:35Z,Download works great! But i need a password in order to view my files. Whats the password?
,tberk,2011-10-13T06:42Z,"I keep getting errors when I try to upload the file. Then, the program will finish installing and work great but if I close it, everything disappears as if I never installed it. So, for me to use this I have to reinstall every time. Any ideas?"

,gnewube,2012-01-17T10:05Z,"I'll take a stab at it... go to:

Portable FileMaker Pro 11 Adv\Portable FileMaker Pro 11 Adv\Portable FileMaker Pro 11 Adv\start hier\Portable FileMaker Pro 11 Adv\

and double-click the file: ""FileMaker Pro Advanced (1).exe""

There's another exe ""FileMaker Pro Advanced.exe"" in: ""Portable FileMaker Pro 11 Adv\%ProgramFilesDir%\FileMaker\FileMaker Pro 11 Advanced"" - but that one gave an error when I tried to run it.

I see the HKEY*.txt files - you might try adding them to your registry, but I didn't...

As for passwords, I did make a very trivial DB, quit, restarted FM, and opened the DB with no query for password... if you're trying to open an old DB that already had a password, then.. well.. y'know.. you need the password.  ;)  (from whoever made the DB if that's not already obvious)

Hope that helps. I didn't try anything but just running it and that simple test DB yet. YMMV. Cheers."
,cyber_wizjas,2012-04-06T08:34Z,"Hi 

Everything works fine but when i try to open a database that was created on filemaker 5.5 (no password) it converts it but when opening it prompts me for a user name (default user is syko_dutch) and password. 

Please help with this 

Thanks"

I need to create several instances of Portable Filemaker on one computer for every RDP user. I have several license keys. I'll make copies of Your great portable solution and substitute license information so it can run simultaneous."
