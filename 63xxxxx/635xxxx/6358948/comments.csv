And also is that shown on full screen or 16:9 on the 3dtv?"
,neomorphic805,2011-05-17T05:37Z,"dammit raster i got 2 huge 3d movies this one and dark country and i cant get either to play sound.  my other mkv files play fine and can stream to my ps 3 but this shit gives me unsupported data errors all over.  Wtf is different about the codec you are using.  I installed cccp pack, no good.  k lite, no good.  I even went to mastroska.org and got a diag tool to check your shit and the proper splitter for mkv is not detected.  how the fuck did you make this bogus shit?"
,raster,2011-05-17T17:41Z,"@ neomorphic805

I understand pall. I have had the same prob with other films. Its the sound channel of your codec/player

Power DVD is a good player you can use to watch from pc to TV. I tend to get the problem when thers more than one language in the film.

I dont have a ps3 now days so can not test on one for you pall. But thry changeing sound channel and you shuld be fine :D"

,kris812,2011-05-21T06:23Z,"Hands down, Power DVD 10 is the best video player to play with without any loss in quality. I have watched some DL 3D videos on the PS3 and was less then satified. Only 3D bluerays play well on it. 3D is best done on the PC. "
,danielhavok,2011-09-14T06:25Z,"It might be a protection thing... with the no sound. I downloaded this and after a few minutes I got an error saying it was going to mute the movie due to it being a copy. I was playing it on my PS3. Anyways, yeah it's called a Cinavia protection I think. "
