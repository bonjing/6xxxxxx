In 2010, it was announced that Eminem was in the process of signing Slaughterhouse, a rap group which Royce is a member. The group together with Royce later appeared on a bonus track for Eminem's Recovery album titled "Session One". The deal was finalised in 2011. The two rappers started rapping together and two of their songs, "Living Proof" and "Echo", were leaked. They later appeared on another song together, this time with the new Shady Records team, Slaughterhouse and Yelawolf on "2.0 Boys". Most recently a titled song "Fast Lane"[3] was leaked to the internet. This came with the announcement that the two are working on an EP which is set to be released on Interscope Records in June 2011[4]

Eminem:

    "Royce and I started hanging out again and inevitably that led us back into the studio. At first we were just seeing where it went without any real goal in mind, but the songs started to come together crazy, so here we are."[5]

Royce Da 5'9":

    "I'm excited to see this project come to fruition considering the long lapse in time between when we worked before and now. We had a blast doing it and we just hope everyone enjoys it while we're working on the 'Monster' that will be the Slaughterhouse album."[6]
