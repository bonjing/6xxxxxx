,Rando_q1,2011-05-01T12:47Z,FTL exe shows version 1.0.0.0 and what that little patch does?
,Rando_q1,2011-05-01T12:49Z,after patching the game with original shift2u.exe then exe is being modified and will show 1.0.1.0 version.... so with your crack even when game is patched to version 1.01 it still stay's v.1.00?
