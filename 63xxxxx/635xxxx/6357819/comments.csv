,MikeXRyan,2011-05-01T21:38Z,"Sorry guys, this will be my last upload until I can find a new broadband provider who does not monitor and throttle my up link.  My (now former) provider sold out to a company called TelePacific and they have turned out to be real assholes by monitoring, throttling and actually closing down my access for ""continuous use"".  They say they aren't looking at the files I up and download (ummmm I'm sure they are looking) but are 'concerned' that I max out my connection 24/7.

,MikeXRyan,2011-05-07T05:19Z,"True, Dustin Zito does appear in the clip ""Chase and Spencer"".  He went by the name of Spencer.  Dustin's claim (today) that he is straight is unbelievable once you see the clip.  

BTW, I'm still working on finding a new provider.  I've filed a complaint with the US FCC against Comcast and TelePacific (owners who bought out my former provider) and neither company is happy with me.  These companies, under US law, are required to provide access despite their personal views or policies.  It may take me a month or so before I can get an encrypted wireless broadband service up and running.  In the meantime, download those files you may have passed over and, if you can, upload your own offerings.  "
