,The_Reasoner,2011-04-29T02:40Z,"This is indeed a REAL copy. unfortunately it's in russian, but this means an english copy won't be far behind.

video: 4
(russian) audio: 5

not great quality, but still watchable. there's a flickering in bright scenes, and it's hard to see in dark scenes. but this video source could be cleaned up a little, to make it a 5 or 6 /10.

now we just need an english audio source!"
