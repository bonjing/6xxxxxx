Intro:
======
I figured I'd make a quality version of the infamous 10,000 Days "easter egg" sync
for everyone because I've heard too many poor quality versions out there; YouTube!
So, here's my best effort for you.  I've added two other must-have Tool track mods
as well...



Tool tracks mods:
=================
Tool - 10,000 Days--Viginti Tres--Wings for Marie (sync).mp3
Tool - 10,000 Days--Viginti Tres--Wings for Marie (sync, outro pan).mp3 *

	With the below noted cues points, the "guitar climax" at 9:14 sync 
	perfectly. There is unavoidable drift though, evident in the drums 
	on the tail end of this guitar riff. 

		Cues: 	
		-----
		10,000 Days (wings part 2) 	0:00
		Viginti Tres			0:00
		Wings for Marie (part 1)	5:01.350 **


		"Guitar climax" start sync points: 
		----------------------------------		
		10,000 Days:			9:14.168
		Wings for Marie:		4:12.818


	* I supplied a slightly panned version for the masses as well.  
	In this version, once the heavy guitar climax ends at 9:30, 
	I gradually (over 2s) panned them to 20% left and 20% right for 
	10,000 Days and Wings, respectively. They retain most of their original
	stereo, but you get a slighty better stereo effect to the sync at the end.

	** Start Wings at 0:00.974 before Viginti Tres ends. Though start 
	cues are more accurate. This value merely indicates that you 
	cannot simply start Wings once Viginti ends. 



Tool - Faaip de Oiad--Lost Keys (overlay).mp3

	Faaip de Oiad 	(Lateralus 2001)
	Lost Keys 	(10,000 Days 2006)

	These tracks, oddly enough, work perfectly together.  
	Perhaps it's no coincidence at all, given the previous example.



Tool - Parabol--Parabola.mp3

	I put these two together just because they belong that way!  
	Damned random/shuffle kills these two tracks.
