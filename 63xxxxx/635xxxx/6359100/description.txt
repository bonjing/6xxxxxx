Plot:
Taew, Cartoon, Mot-dum and Songkram are four aging-yet-still-outrageous katoey (drag queens) who run a boarding house for boys in provincial Thailand. After helping to cover up the mysterious deaths of two local teens (obese ladyboy "Pancake" and a beautiful local girl named Num-Ning), the two spirits begin haunting the dormitory, forcing the "girls" to try all sorts of crazy schemes to get rid of the ghosts. Eventually, they realize that the only way to do this is to help one the ghosts to avenge their deaths.
