What is the bitrate please? Is it around 2000kbps?

I'm asking coz the size is very small, i hope the quality isn't too bad... It's sad to see x264 rip with xvid quality ;)"
,TDTtorrents,2011-05-02T00:34Z,"v3rv3 the bitrate is over 1000kb/s on all episodes^^ and its good quality:) 
there is a sample to download mate and check^^

cheers"

Thanks for your quick answer. BTW I've asked because this is a new torrent and there was no seeder at that time so I was not able to download the sample ;-)

The quality is average/low (kinda blurry & heavily compressed) but still ok... 

For HQ release you should use a bitrate around 1850/2000kbps for 720 & 2850/3250kbps for 1280x720. (if darker scenes or fast actions movies) ^^ 

Could you please consider raising the bitrate for forthcoming release? TY

Kind regards.

Thanks for listening but something else... This is not a proper release, it's a hd-tv rip, not a BRRip... Why do you add bad tag in the name? :-/

I'll stop seeding because I've deleted it for that reason. "
