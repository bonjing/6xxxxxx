,tpirates,2012-02-12T05:39Z,"it works perfectly. What you should do before installation is have your internet off. Thank you so much thethingy, as you can see the TPB changed its domain in order to avoid being shut down, so its a matter of time to get all that we can before this happens (PS: it may shut down even BEFORE SOPA gets forced in)"
,so__fiane,2012-02-12T14:41Z,Merci beaucoup pour ce torrent ! :D Je vais m'amuser comme un petit fou ! Dites non à SOPA ACTA PIPA !!!

I have never downloaded a file like this before and any help would be appreciated. It keeps asking me to open it with another program and Power iso does not work and it does not want to extract itself. Whar can I do
,Naifman,2012-02-27T02:40Z,"Hey ! Thanks for this great torrent !

,w.32.da.bagle,2012-03-22T06:29Z,"i ran into a problem. after i renamed the host file and saved the new file from the folder into the etc folder. it does not let me copy extra links i had under the orignal host files. i mean once i copy and paste below the line where it says no # or space and then tried saving it. it shows wrong path and takes me back to the system 32 folder and ask me to save under etc file but nothing happens. are those links really important to resave or can i just let it go. i opened an account under superbay as well but i have no idea how to create a tread. the whole database and its queries are confusing lol

thanx.
p.s. AF works and activated with the first serial. also i downloaded all the extra such as trapcode form, supershine and stuff. how do i get them to work with AE, doesnt seems like i can access them. "
,sergio97,2012-03-25T15:20Z,"does this torrent includes the ""cycore fx"" effects? "
,1995-wox,2012-03-27T19:32Z,"Hii. 

I wanted to know how do I run this on 32 bit as the supporting version link is dead ?"
,hazachoom,2012-04-02T09:32Z,Yea same! the 32bit link is broken
,senrai180,2012-04-03T04:31Z,"dont trust Inmn101 for those who are new, too obvious"
,dalebboi,2012-04-04T00:57Z,its sayd it wont run 64 bit while in itsalling it?? helpp?
,maxxdl,2012-04-04T18:35Z,"Why oh why does NO ONE actually say HOW to install this in 7 pages!!??

The question has come up over and over, still no answer. 
There is only 1 exe file. No readme file or nothing.
I guess you just click the exe file and extract the files. If so, why not just say so in torrent info...."
,FireStricker,2012-04-06T16:50Z,"Downloading now, hope it will work nice."
,epicblaze2,2012-04-09T02:43Z,"as usual, installed like a breeze, thanks for the uploads, you never disappoint "
,tac0b3ll,2012-04-12T19:44Z,Perfect installed THE BEST ADOBE RELEASE I've seen so far. Nice touch adding the original amtlib on dll folder.
,Stock3rz,2012-04-15T07:10Z,I should be able to figure out how to install this torrent so when I finish downloading it I will post comment how to install.
,lillypad01,2012-04-15T15:49Z,"Great up! 
Could anyone please post the serials for this and/or CS5, or message me or something? Thanks so much!"
,zomgitskevin,2012-04-18T03:09Z,"Very very easy torrent once you get the hang of it.... For me (Win7 64bit) all you need to do is just replace the host file with the one provided from the folder you extracted 

Then well at least from a video I watch you go into cmd and put in ipconfig/flushdns and then just disconnect from the internet, and run the setup and put a key in and it should be done! 

I even downloaded photoshop from thethingy and all I needed to do was just run the setup because I didn't need to replace the host file again... Thanks thethingy me love you long time :D"
,GoblynQueen,2012-04-20T05:52Z,the second method is a lot easier... saved me a lot of time.
,Sn0wLeopard,2012-04-24T23:30Z,Awesome! Thanks so much! Your the best!!
,monohalcyon,2012-04-27T10:01Z,Thank you good sir! You're generosity is appreciated =) 
,FunkyP1dgeon,2012-04-28T10:49Z,"my laptop has the intel centrino processor, 32 bit windows 7 and 3gb of ram. do you think it would work? because  i really want after effects. thanks! :) "
,FunkyP1dgeon,2012-04-28T17:00Z,i have already changed/backed up the host file for your adobe audition torrent and that works fine. will i have to change this host file because it isnt listed..
,rhanchild13,2012-05-01T11:56Z,"@thethingy

sir no 32 bit for cs5 after effects? hope u can help me T_T "
,phoenix84,2012-05-01T20:09Z,Do you have this for a 32 bit system?
,uheardmebitch,2012-05-06T07:33Z,"maxxdl, you need to double click on that one and it will uncompress to a set of yellow folders. this has the instructions. they're all the same for adobe stuff. block hosts, swap dl [before first start] this shit can be a headache at first but it's always the same and it's NECESSARY. your product will be cracked forever. thethingys' stuff always works. usually he puts a little video in the file about how to stop the hosts calling home. it's easy. 
"
,uheardmebitch,2012-05-06T07:36Z,"ranchild13, i don't think AA5 came out in 32 bit. the new mercury engine is only 64 bit from memory. they will stop using 32 bit soon. not enough adress space. go to 64 bit ASAP"
,Infenix13,2012-05-08T00:26Z,"I am downloading now, will put my feedback after. "
,Pr0L1F3,2012-05-12T13:25Z,"Hey thingy you are so good at these torrents, but got to ask, is your keygen safe, cause I don't want a virus on my laptop, please comment back."

,Ienjoiskate,2012-05-29T21:42Z,"Its forcing me to register and sign in , and everytime i do so, it says that i cant register/log in at the moment. and im forced to close it again. (Im having the same problem with the adobe illustrator aswell)
Ive used both in the past before. Any ideas why its doing this?"
,pers0n,2012-06-10T08:03Z,"I supose its good, but the instructions are so vague in the host part that i cant even get past that. It would also be nice if the video was in a good enough qualty to read what is on your screen."
,Lollymaniacs,2012-06-10T21:59Z,Stuck at 99.9% what a joke.
,pers0n,2012-06-11T00:48Z,"Oh, i didnt realize that the pdf was a better tutorial, works great man!"
