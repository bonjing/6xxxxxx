
Artist: Charlies
Title: Musiikkia Elokuvasta Julisteiden Liimaajat
Genre: Hard Blues,Acid Psych Rock
Origin: Finland

Influenced by Cream, Led Zeppelin, Jethro Tull and Jimi Hendrix, this heavy blues outfit recorded two LP\'s in 1970, \"Buttocks\" and the soundtrack for the experimental movie \"Julisteiden liimaajat\" (Poster Pasters), known as the Finnish movie with the all-time worst box-office success. Charlies began suffering from internal difficulties in 1971, the band split, reformed with a different lineup, and started playing very varying styles of material. Three tracks for a proposed single were recorded in 1973, but two of them were released on a compilation only, and the third one was dug up from the vaults and released on a compilation CD in 1998. After more lineup changes Charlies split in 1975.
