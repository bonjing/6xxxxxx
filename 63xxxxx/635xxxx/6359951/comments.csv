A - 8/10
V - 7/10
But I've just started grading and decide to grade for what it is vs. DVD quality, so 7's and 8's are PRETTY DANG GOOD!
Thanks SO MUCH for posting this one!
I will seed for a week, which - hopefully - will help keep this one alive.
Good show, old bean... good show!"

A - 10/10
V - 9.5/10"

I see from your list that you don't mess around! (how's the quad?)
Thanks a bunch, and keep up the good work! 
On a side note, 480p is the minimum nowadays. 
Peace, ;)"
