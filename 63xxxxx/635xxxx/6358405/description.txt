Strange Famous consigliare B. Dolan returns with his sophomore lp, "Fallen House, Sunken City" produced entirely by ALIAS. Having already established himself as a master storyteller, this time Dolan presents us with a full-throttle, unabashed, boombap hiphop record. Joined by legendary beatsmith Alias behind the production board, B. Dolan's aggressive delivery is accentuated by a special brand of bass-heavy breakbeats, while the tailor made musical backdrops assist in the mood of impending doom. Guest appearances by P.O.S., Cadence Weapon, Providence's "What Cheer?" Brigade, and Buddy Peace round out the tracklist, as SFR and B. Dolan set the decade off with a demolition charge.

Reviews for Fallen House, Sunken City:

"This duo is set to knock the dust off your boombox and slap you right out of your little sisterâ€™s pants. Iâ€™m going to go ahead and dub this the first great hop hop album of Twentyten." - LoyaltyBeyondReason.com

"B. Dolan and Alias set out to create a bass-heavy boom bap breaks record with politically charged spit fire, flipping Milk D and EPMD colloquialisms towards an activist slant." - Impose Magazine

"Backed by the appropriately maniacal, percussion-driven boardwork of Alias, the emcee delivers fragmented shotgun blasts of aggressively satirical lyrical ammunition" - DJ Booth (djbooth.net)

"B. Dolan has cursed me with repeating the same lines over and over again in my head since I met him. Come to Jamaica, come to Dubai. Damn you, B. Dolan. Shit knocks." El-P
