,DaWrath,2011-06-07T20:39Z,"For everyone asking about if the perks work, yes they work ONLY IF YOU'RE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET. I don't remember about adoc networks without internet but try for yourself."
,jvezirian,2011-06-08T09:23Z,"Just out of curiosity before I install this... Just what is the ""run me first.exe"" file? "
,hisslewi,2011-06-12T21:06Z,@DaWrath It can also mean they have a mutator on. All the mods in the game seem to suffer from this with no obvious way around it. It's why this problem isn't present in the comments section of earlier versions because they could have mods on and still be dandy however with 1017+ this isn't going to happen unless the uploaders realize that the that is an issue and not just that our internet connection is down when for the majority of us it isn't.

,ben2000677,2011-08-10T13:23Z,"hi all,
after some work I've got this working online with Tunngle & Garena.
If you got the solo play working fine, you need to update to version 1025 with non retail patches (found in links on youtube videos) there are also a load of tutorials on how to setup tunngle and garena for KF too. 
hope this helps :)"

If you ever come back, can you tell me how to play online? Green0Link@Gmail.com"
