There are several reasons the MathsWatch CD-ROM works as
the best Maths revision aid on the market today:

>>It revises every single A* to G topic (183 of them) just like a teacher would, at the board

>>The three producers of the CD-ROM are all highly experienced practising teachers

>>Grade D and C topics are taught so that borderline students really can understand them
Â   
>>Some topics have two separate clips because they can be taught in two different ways

>>Almost every clip has real exam questions for students to do - because we all know that to be good at  Maths, a student has to do it, not just watch it
