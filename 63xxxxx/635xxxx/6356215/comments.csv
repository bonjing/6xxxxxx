more than 10,000 people are using this shit since long.!

,Ithalimoon,2011-05-12T16:22Z,"Same problem as with nearly all other dreamweaver torrents, after entering serial it asks for adobe ID, and you cannot continue without one."
,W4rr10r,2011-05-26T09:24Z,"well, don't know what the hell is wrong with QUIETSIDE, but thanks for the upload, I scanned it, and their was no malware found, ran it, and nothing went wrong, so errors, no sudden increase in resource consumption, nothing.   thanks.   :]"
,longcat_cl,2011-05-27T14:24Z,Worked Flawlessly. Thanks!
,Malarin,2011-05-30T00:00Z,"isn't working at all for me...
I didn't install it under C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 and i installed in german... is that maybe the problem?"
,Malarin,2011-05-30T12:15Z,"Edit: I meant I didn't install Dreamweaver CS5 under C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Dreamweaver CS5, but I placed the Keygen where the Dreamweaver.exe is... was that wrong? Or is it because it's the german Version? "
,Mathijs13,2011-06-06T19:26Z,"@QUIETSIDE
Fuck Yourself.
Don't download it then...
@sam
Great Job!"
,mother21,2011-06-11T15:48Z,"fyi - tried it with CS5.5 design premium v11.5 build 5313, tried to apply patch, it returned ""Dreamweaver CS5 cannot be found""  Tried to rename dir, and no luck.  I didn't continue as I assume that may not be wise.  (Can you tell I'm a noob?)

Curious - i added â127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.comâ to host for this 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5570840/Adobe_Photoshop_CS5_Extended_%28Crack___Instructions%29

Is that the same patch, and would it do what this patch does?"
,long4U92592,2011-06-11T19:50Z,"In order to make Dreamweaver activate, besides blocking Adobe in the Hosts file, I had to do this;

1) Copy the amtlib.dll file from my Photoshop install.
2) Edit the application.xml file to include the generated S/N under the paragraph, (use a generated S/N)

No more pop-ups or messages about not being registered."
,mother21,2011-06-11T21:35Z,"thanks long4u - moble, will try later"
,mother21,2011-06-11T22:23Z,"Changed my mind and came back-waited until last day of trial thinking this would go easier

Worked like a charm . . . thanks long4u

I'm a noob, and have no experience in xml, hence DW.

one more question if i may

Opened  photoshop application.xml to guide me through and came across this key in same place you suggested for dreamwweaver

. . . key=""NTL_WO_SN"">

Should i be concerned?

Being a noob, let me know if I'm crossing etiquette lines

Thanks again"
,phoenix101703,2011-06-25T01:44Z,"My anti-virus software (TrendMicro Titanium) deleted this automatically due to ""malicious content""

Hmmmm???"
,Poephila,2011-06-25T19:35Z,"Hey there. 
The download went fine and there was no malicious content. Thanks!  

Problem is, when I click the ""patch"" button, it says: ""Dreamweaver was not found"". I did install and run it as trial and copied the .exe in the right folder... please help!  In the meantime I'll just use the trial. 

Cheers! "
,snafubar75,2011-06-26T02:12Z,"Did as instructed.  Ran patch and says Adobe Dreamweaver file not found.  

Any help?"
,4LoKo,2011-07-28T22:58Z,Does not work....
,CandyLips,2011-09-02T23:09Z,"Hey, does anyone know if this works with Dreamweaver version CS5.5? Or does it only work with CS5? Please answer! :)"

Why don't you and others who say that there is no virus just put a comment with those generated keys, so we can try them?"

,bhatti555,2011-09-17T01:49Z,"It works perfectly. Just that when you run the keygen as administrator, there is a checkbox below it saying 'Protect my computer and data from unauthorized program activity and so on. It is checked.

UNCHECK IT and click OK. It will patch successfully. Then Generate serial and out it in. It will work perfectly."
,Gruv3r14,2012-01-26T23:08Z,If only it worked for cs5.5 :/ can't find patch/keygen for it anywhere.
