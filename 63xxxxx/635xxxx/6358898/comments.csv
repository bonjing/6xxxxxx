,egr403,2012-01-09T13:06Z,"Hi
Just wanted to let you all know that this file caused repeated crashes of Windows Eplorer in my PC. 
I could not delete it or anything. 
Just a fair warning. 
I eventually solved this crashes by installing Universal Explorer, which enabled me to bypass Win Exp and delete this file."
