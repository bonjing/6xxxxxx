,Psythik,2011-05-01T23:42Z,"Whoever mastered this album should be shot.  The audio is very distorted and clips like crazy.  Just look at the waveform for Too Many Rappers:

[Can't post the stupid link for whatever reason.  Just open one of the songs in Audacity and see for yourself]

The sound is literally being CUT OFF.  The dynamics of the audio are non-existent. Just LOUD LOUD LOUD LOUD LOUD, and more LOUD.  The beats are sick, but what the FUCK were they on when they mastered this album?"
,balou2,2011-05-03T06:57Z,"I don't know if it's the rip, or the files, but the mix is DEFINITELY bad on this.  Fluttering in and out the entire time.  Deleting (bummed).  Thanks though."
[V],jainmehul,2011-05-03T14:42Z,The quality is as the CD provides.you can check with any software its real 320Kbps.

,Tlizard,2011-05-04T05:58Z,What is the final verdict? Are the files in this torrent correct or is the mix wonky as some have said?

Enough Of Questioning The Quality.I Have Got Some Proof

these are the spectral images of 3 songs of this torrent.you can see the cutoff for the song is 20.3,which is exactly what is should be for 320kbps.so enough of all the bullshit!!!!"

First of all, thanks for this.
Secondly I just wanted to point out that the comments the people were making on the quality of the sound don't necessarily have anything to do with the rip of the cd to mp3. They were saying that the sound clipped which basically means that during the recording the soundlevel exceeded the allowed volume for the recording equipment leading to the loudest parts simply being cut off. (assuming digital recording equipment was used) It could also be faulty mastering which is the last stage in the recording process but this is less likely. Then there's the possibility that the mp3 encoding software fucked up by raising the volume levels up too high leading to digital distortion.
I'm listening to some songs now and I can hear distortion but I'm using crappy laptop speakers and it's late. I'll have to wait till I get a chance to listen to it in my car to make a proper judgement. Also I should check out a different rip of the cd to see if there are any differences in the sound.
But ofcourse Beastie Boys do have a certain sound and perhaps they used distortion on purpose to make their tracks sound less tight."
,stonelesscutter,2011-05-05T02:00Z,I've sampled another rip of this and it also has the distortion which means it was already there on the cd. My guess is they distorted it on purpose during recording to make it sound cool. So there's absolutely nothing wrong with this torrent peeps.

Thanks For clearing that..... :):)"
,chanciusmaximus,2011-05-05T18:54Z,"The album is really good... but it clips like a mo' fo'! When I listen to it on my heavy duty computer speakers it sounds fine, but when I listen to it on headphones it sounds pretty bad! Way too much distortion to the point where it just sounds like I'm listen to a cassette tape that's been garbled up 2-3 times! :(

,Psythik,2011-05-05T22:05Z,"chanciusmaximus is absolutely right.  Like I said earlier, it's simply a matter of horrible mastering in the studio.  The Beastie Boys' producer is to blame, not the uploader."
,pbr420,2011-05-08T05:19Z,"we are a bunch of picky bastards. I dont give a shit about all yall tech talk, all i know is what i hear... Complainers are full of shit! I listened to the entire cd through my 360 through my stereo. sounded great! Yall can't even tell the difference between mastered distortion and rip errors!!!! Don't lisen to those fools
thank you jainmehul!"

,AWu-TangLife,2011-05-12T20:03Z,"ya I highly doubt that 5% of the sound issue comments have any audio engineering background.

Torrent is 100% perfect. 

Distortion is on purpose, on record (B-Boys u noobs). Especially on too many rappers (worst song).

Over all, BEST B-BOYS album in a LONG time! Verp happy with, and will be purchasing it!

THANKS ALOT UPLOADER! FUCK YOU NON INFORMED COMPLAINING BITCHES!"
,H1BRID,2011-05-21T09:38Z,"The distortion that everyone talks about its perfectly normal, they did on purpose to sound like the old school days.. but..if you want to change that a little, I've tried change the 41000 Hz up to 48000Hz made a difference but after all you can't remove something that is supposed to be there..Even at the studio with all the tools its impossible to remove it. Beastie Boys the ""new"" old school, love it or hate it..there's nothing you can do about it..

By the way the track used for test was ""too many rappers"" since is the one with more (original) significant distortion added due the use of bass's, kicks, claps..

This a 100% secure rip! Enjoy it!"

,Shazam_777,2011-06-12T06:31Z,"Kinda reminds me of one Alecia Keyes album a few years ago where there was static incorporated on purpose. In the digital world, we cant help wonder if the problem is with the source or not.  In the years of vinyl, we knew easily now...not so much.  THe BB must be using the same shithead to master their CD, in the end that will likely be their undoing."

BTW, I deleted most of the songs but a few. Really shitty album."
