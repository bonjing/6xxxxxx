this is not fake its windows 8 they just use windows 7 installer untill the retail version comes out
until the retail version it will be virtually the same as windows 7 just the logon screen has changed so far but in the retail version it will have a new super bar wallpapers and god knows what else

,TheAeroHacker,2011-05-20T23:02Z,"THIS IS WINDOWS 8!!! People that say ""This Is Windows 7"" are dumb, because in case you didn't know: EVERY WINDOWS RELEASE IS BASED ON THE PREVIOUS VERSION. Remember how Win 95, 98, 98 SE, ME, and 2000 looked alike? But they had different features. Remember how people said Windows Vista was the unfinished Windows 7? Well this is almost the same, Windows 8 will just enhance the look and add new features to Windows 7!
