Sleepers BBC mini-series from 1991.

Starring Warren Clarke and Nigel Havers as the two KGB agents who have 'gone native,' Sleepers was first broadcast on BBC2 in the spring of 1991 and was, without a doubt, one of the funniest comedy-dramas to have been produced in the UK during the 1990s.

Plot

Amidst the thaw of glasnost, the Kremlin discovers that two Soviet agents, sent to England under deep cover in 1965, have been "lost." A beautiful and ambitious Russian agent, sent to London to track them down, becomes embroiled in a tangle of CIA, KGB and MI-5 plots and counter-plots as the two lost agents, now utterly assimilated, try to avoid detection.
