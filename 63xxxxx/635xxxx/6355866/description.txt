|Plot/Storyline|
+--------------+

In the far future, mankind has destroyed the Earth in the "Seven Days of Fire". Now, there are small pockets of humanity left that have survived. One pocket is the Valley of the Wind where a princess named NausicaÃ¤ tries to understand, rather than destroy the Toxic Jungle. She desperately struggles to prevent two warring nations from destroying themselves in this epic masterpiece from the legendary Hayao Miyazaki. Originally titled Kaze no tani no Naushika, this film was created before Studio Ghibli was actually founded in 1985.
