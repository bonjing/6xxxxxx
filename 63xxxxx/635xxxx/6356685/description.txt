NEW CONTENT

Liberation of Caen is a new map for BF1942 owners. It includes a whole new
army, the Canadians. The army includes the Sexton SPA and the Lynx scout car,
as well as new skins, flags, voice overs, and a new Assault rifle, the Johnson
M1941 LMG. The Germans in this map are also equipped with a new scout vehicle,
the Kettenkrad.

Raid on Agheila is a new map playable only by owners of the Secret Weapons of
WWII expansion pack. This exciting map adds a bevy of new vehicles, including
mobile spawn points, stationary rocket launchers, a new tank, new
self-propelled artillery, and the Flettner, an experimental helicopter.

Battle of Britain can now be played using Objective Mode. Secret Weapons of
WWII expansion pack is NOT required to play Battle of Britain in this mode.

Invasion of the Philippines has been slightly revised. The Japanese Destroyer
has been rotated to face North, giving the Japanese a better chance at the
start. The out of bounds area has been pushed back, and ticket bleeds have been
slightly reduced.

The famous Russian dive bomber Ilyushin IL-2 has replaced one of the Yak 9
fighters in Kursk and Kharkov.

    profile you will need to assign these functions to other keys or use for
    them to work.

Improved server browser:

  - Support for favorite servers as a separate list accessible from the
    filters pane.
    NOTE: The favorite servers list must be refreshed manually to reflect the

DEDICATED SERVER SPECIFIC CHANGES / BUG FIXES

Added support for Punkbuster anti-cheat software.
  - Visit http://www.evenbalance.com for more information

Win32 dedicated server implemented through back-port of the Linux dedicated
server.

  - Runs in console mode displaying a status monitor with an
    interactive console.
  - The server uses a different binary than the game (bf1942_w32ded.exe).
  - Status monitor changes (compared to Linux server 1.5):
    - Added chat feedback.
    - Added number of tickets and current round number.
    - Added game state (playing, paused, etc.).

Added support for mixing mods, maps and game modes in the maplist.

  - As a result of this the game.serverGamePlayMode command in the
    ServerSettings.con file and the +game command line argument are now
    obsolete for dedicated servers and should not be used.

  - The Maplist.con was changed to allow three arguments:
    game.addLevel <mapname> <game mode> <mod>, i.e.:
    game.addLevel Gazala GPM_CQ bf1942
    ** NOTE : the following commands now also use this functionality:
            - admin.changeMap
            - admin.setNextLevel

  - Updated the DedicatedServer.exe launcher program to allow for
    creation of maplists with the new functionality.

  - Please note that all old maplists are incompatible with this new
    feature and will have to be created again. Running the server with
    an old map list will not work.

Added installation sanity checking that will tell you about common installation
errors such as missing files. The sanity checking is done automatically at
startup.

Added more readable error messages for common errors such as misspelled level
names.

Updated chat system:

  - Fixed "chat lag" by streaming messages over a high-priority channel.
  - Added basic flood protection which prevents players from taking to much
    chat bandwidth by "spamming".
  - Added chat text as messages to the status monitor console.

GameSpy/ASE host reporting changes:

  - Added (kills/deaths) to ASE score format.
  - Added roundTimeLeft to GameSpy keys.
  - Added reporting of cd key hashes to GameSpy keys.
  - Added active_mods key showing all mods in map cycle.
  - Added content_check key showing content checking mode.
  - Converted GameSpy reporting keys to lowercase and replaced spaces with
    underscores to facilitate filtering in external browsers.

Upgraded XML logging format to 1.1:

  - Added support for CD key hashes for players.
  - Fixed a few spelling errors for keys.
  - Fixed a bug where compressed XML logs where sometimes being corrupted.
  - Escapes non-printable characters as bf:nonprint tags.
  - Added chat text messages to the XML stream.

Updated banning system:

  - Bans can be set on CD key hashes as well as IP addresses.

  - Timeouts can be specified in these ways:
    admin.banPlayerKey <player_id> [timeout]

    Where timeout can take one of these formats:
        - Omitted or 'perm' meaning that the ban is permanent
        - An integral number meaning the number of seconds the ban will be active
          (i.e. 3600 means one hour)
        - 'round', meaning the ban is active until the next map
        - An integral number prepended by a colon (i.e. :1234567), meaning the
          epoch exporation time of the ban (number of seconds since 1 Jan 1970).
      This option is most usable by external tools.

  - IP address bans continue to work as earlier but include
    the new timeout options as well.

  - Bans are stored as absolute times in banlist.con. Existing bans in
    banlist.con will be interpreted as permanent bans.

The game.listPlayers command lists cd key hashes of connected players when
running in internet mode.

The game.showPorts console command can be invoked to display the ports
currently used by the server.

Updated content crc generation:

  - Generation bat files are now created only for the mods you select. The new
    bat files are named getcrc-<modname>.bat.
 
Updated remote console output:

  - The remote console now mirrors text written to the main console by prepending
    each mirrored line by a hash character (#). This is useful to capture chat
    text from external tools that periodically send commands to the remote
    console.
  - Please note that if several remote connections are made, the state of the
    mirroring is cleared so that mirrored console lines can easily be lost.
    Thus if you plan to use this feature in a tool, please only connect with one
    remote console connection at a time to ensure that you will get the correct
    results.

Added overlayPath feature to support running multiple server instances from the
same installation directory. To set up an instance, please follow these steps:
  - Create a new, empty directory to hold the instance, for instance C:\Server1
  - Copy the mods\bf1942\Settings directory from the main installation to the
    new directory
  - Create a new, empty Logs directory in the instance directory
  - Start the server with the overlayPath argument in a shortcut:
    bf1942_w32ded.exe +overlayPath C:\Server1
  - Please note that the working directory for the server must still be set to
    the main installation directory.
  - Also please note that if your overlayPath contains spaces you will need to
    quote the path in the arguments in one of these ways:
    - bf1942_w32ded.exe +overlayPath 'c:\path with spaces\server1'
      (single quotes)
    - bf1942_w32ded.exe +overlayPath """c:\path with spaces\server1"""
      (note that these are three double quotes)

** IMPORTANT INFO INVOLVING AIR CONTROLS IN PATCH 1.45 **

Patch 1.45 has introduced 3 new AIR controls, located under CONTROLS in 
the OPTIONS menu, on the 2nd page of the AIR tab.  If you have applied
the 1.45 patch to an existing, previously played install of

Patch 1.1
==================================================================
SERVER FIXES
-Improved server stability.
-Fixed bug that caused server to say it was full when it wasn't.
-Servers started from in-game now use settings from dedicated 
 server tool if those settings are not in the in-game Create Game 
 front-end.
-LAN servers no longer report to Gamespy master server.
-Limiting the bandwidth now works from the dedicated server

CLIENT FIXES
-All Seeing Eye server browser support added.
-Fixed refresh rate locked to 60 hz in Win2k and XP machines.  
 We're working on getting this fix for Win98 and ME machines. 
 To enable this on Win2k and XP machines do the following:
        -Open the videodefault.con file found in 
         Settings\VideoDefault.con
        -Edit the line: renderer.allowAllRefreshRates # 
         (where # can be replaced by 0 or 1)
        -Changing this value to one will allow you to select the 
         refresh rates from the Options>Video section of the
         in-game frontend. 
         NOTE: the game will default to 640x480.
-Fixed bug that caused ammo-boxes and health-cabinets to not work 
 occasionally.
-Considerably faster internet in-game browser.
-Added icon in the in-game browser for dedicated servers.
-Added icon in the in-game browser for password protected servers.
-Added icon in the in-game browser showing server CPU status, if 
 it's doing well or if it's bogged down by too many players for 
 it's capacity (this is dependant upon the CPU not the bandwidth).
-Added server CPU info in the in-game browser under the server 
 info>rules tab.
-Chat text in-game has it's own color so it's easier to see.
-Server version number will show correctly in server info> rules 
 tab
-Fixed some instances of the internet browser crashing when 
 pressing yes to update to newer version on a 98 machine.
-Fixed player ability to sink Kubelwagens into the ground.
-Fixed free spectator camera does not turn off, even when 
 unchecked in the server.
