Description

The tank simulation Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â•¦Â£WWII Battle Tanks: T-34 vs. TigerÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³ takes place in Belarus during the summer of 1944, in which the Soviet Union launched Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¼Ã´Operation BagrationÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¬Â¥, the Belarusian offensive, against the retreating German Wehrmacht. After Kursk, this was the most significant struggle of the two tank armies and resulted in the complete destruction of the German Army Group Center and the Soviet recapture of all territories within their 1941 borders.

The player can experience the battlefield from within the Russian T-34 and the German Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¼Ã´TigerÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¬Â¥, with fully animated 3D interiors and playable Driver, Gunner and Commander positions. The tanksÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³ dynamics include realistic physics, accurate ballistics and elaborate damage models. Interior models feature historically accurate gun-sight optics.

The vast Belarusian landscape of the early 20th century, with its rolling hills, villages and large forests was carefully recreated from historical reference photos and maps. The rich battlefield environment includes AI controlled Russian and German tanks, infantry, armored-personnel-carriers, anti-tank-guns and airplanes.

Stunning special effects, such as explosions, fires and smoke, the ability to completely destroy vehicles and buildings, all combine to create a lifelike combat environment. The action can be viewed from various camera angles in first or third person view.

Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â•¦Â£WWII Battle Tanks: T-34 vs. TigerÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³ includes two single-player campaigns and two multiplayer modes (skirmish and team-play) for LAN and Internet play for up to 16 players.
