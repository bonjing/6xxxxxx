Instructor's Solution Manual for "Mechanics of Materials, 7th SI Edition" by R. C. Hibbeler (c2008). All 14 chapters combined in a single largish bookmarked PDF file (~40 MB). Problem statements & solutions included. Units: SI. 7-Zip archive (~30 MB).

Comment: The regular US&SI edition explains little but provides calculations (though cryptically). OTOH the present SI edition is more detailed and written in a parametric format related to the figure and underlying FBDs but calculations are left to the user (final answers provided and some intermediate results as well). You can apply/review the concepts in their "literal equation" format first and write down the numbers and punch them on the pocket calculator yourself next, making all sorts of mistakes (and learning from them) _before_ the exam.  
Quality: Not a native PDF but readability is OK throughout (zoom-in viewing needed at times)

Once your download has finished, _please_ seed this torrent as often and for as long as you possibly can.
