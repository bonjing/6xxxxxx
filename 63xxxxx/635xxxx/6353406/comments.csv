,Rando_q1,2011-04-29T17:54Z,can some1 confirm those changes or performance boost? was the info no crack needed right?????
,Rando_q1,2011-04-29T17:56Z,shift2u.exe is still showing 1.0.0.0 badbad.... so some1 will make crack for us?
,Raiyus13,2011-04-29T20:31Z,yup this patch actually modifies the sihft2u exe. so if you don't have the original exe installed it will not modify it.
,Rando_q1,2011-04-29T22:37Z,yep i try'd that original exe patching and now im waiting for crack... hope it will be up soon... so ppl.. u need original shift2u.exe before patching the game... and if u patch it then u cant play before new crack installing....
,Rando_q1,2011-04-30T12:42Z,"still no crack:S:S if i remodified 1.0.0.0 exe to 1.0.1.0 will it work? but no boost on my system... where are u guy's reloaded, skidrow, flt and other crackers? help us out
"
,Raiyus13,2011-04-30T13:37Z,"This game has a solidshield 2.4 protection and hence it is very hard to crack, i tried it myself but was out of luck :P ...... codies c'mon"
,sapsafe,2011-05-01T20:13Z,"oh cmon, we need a crack"
,sapsafe,2011-05-02T00:56Z,its out for few days now and still no crack? wow.
,Rando_q1,2011-05-02T17:10Z,"it's so fuck'd.... i have read in forums that this patch make's shift 2 like new game(better handling, no input lag, and crossfire/sli works perfect that's what i need with my 4870x2).... we need this crack :("
,sapsafe,2011-05-03T17:31Z,"any news on the crack? We really need this crack, patch changes alot of things in the game. We cant use it properly witohut cracked 1.01 exe"
,Rando_q1,2011-05-03T19:57Z,no new's i have done some research vovan31337 and RELOADED made crack for shift 2. we can contact with vovan site like noDVD.net but its russian site and i cant handle it(im fool estonian=)... any1 knows how to connect with reloaded. maybe those guy's dont know that the patch is out....
,4seed2u,2011-05-04T02:30Z,Do not download the above link.This is a fake and trojan.Confirmed. 
,Rando_q1,2011-05-04T16:42Z,wtf 4seed2u???? i think u comment some wrong torrent moron!
,randall_ranks,2011-05-04T16:47Z,the reason there is no crack out yet is because u don't need one this patch is just a setting adjustment for better gameplay (and belive me they've done a bang up job) it does not touch the exe file the game works perfectly fine. 
,sapsafe,2011-05-04T18:02Z,"the reason why the patch didnt upgrade the exe for u is coz u didnt have ORIGINAL exe. Patch does update the exe, but only if u have the original one. So if u start the patched game with old exe u dont get all features of the patch, u still get some of them but not all. Also with old exe ppl get some wierd graphical bugs like black grass etc."
,Rando_q1,2011-05-04T18:43Z,randall_ranks you are missing something... patch repleaces only original exe and upgrades it 1.0.1.0. atleast sapsafe got this fight:)
,Rando_q1,2011-05-04T18:43Z,right* :D:D:D
,randall_ranks,2011-05-04T19:59Z,"I haven't come across any bugs at the moment but ill keep an eye out for the crack, i really don't mind the wait now cause the patch has fixed a major  part of the game (physics & Handling) and that's more than enough form me. "
,therapho,2011-05-05T04:58Z,"It will be great if vovan31337 or Reloaded, can do a new file for the updates 1.0.1.0 and the next just to come out, this next patch will add DLC support for PC version and another bunch of improvements."
,warehouse_man,2011-05-05T21:31Z,"My game somethimes crash, and i cannot do anything only restart the computer, there any fix for this?"
,Raiyus13,2011-05-07T10:24Z,No cracks yet??? What the heck is going on??? Somebody do something!
,Rando_q1,2011-05-07T13:03Z,yes still no crack.... maybe its too hard for crackers.... its hopeless... and that's the only game im going to buy if no crack will release.... i love racing game and nfs series and for me its best game on market...
,Raiyus13,2011-05-07T14:14Z,Guess I need to scarifies the movie tickets and go buy a retail disc then....Shit what a mess....but ye I can play online then :P

This patch dont need a crack since , it dont mess with the exe. file, this is only for better handling. and this dont fixed the game crash. my game still crash after some races :("
,Rando_q1,2011-05-07T20:52Z,@ warehouse_man this patch need's crack!!!! before patching the game u need to repaste your orginginal game exe with cracked exe 1.0.0.0 then if u patch the game u got version 1.0.1.0 exe and u cant run the game... some patch extras works with 1.0.0.0 exe too such as pakfiles(steering and psyhics). but no change crossfire/sli systems.... if we finaly got crack then i can enjoy my 4870x2.... so if u patch cracked game NO EXE UPGRADE WONT BE!!!! 
,kajosin,2011-05-08T10:50Z,"""some patch extras works with 1.0.0.0 exe too such as pakfiles(steering and psyhics)""

hmm input lag not fixed for me , with patch + 1.0 exe"

,stuck4ever,2011-05-10T17:00Z,"@Rando_q1
Did you try to extract the bin files using FreeArc and 7zip, because sometimes they are just renamed to a different extension ?"
,stuck4ever,2011-05-10T17:13Z,"@Rango_q1
So sad it's not working. Try this:
- Rename .bin to .iso and see if you can open those.
- Use MagicISO to open the bin files
- Also IZArc and ExtractNow claim to support .bin archives. Try them if none works.

Hope that solves :)

We are so in need of this Crack !"
,Rando_q1,2011-05-10T17:47Z,"yep i opened those files and there is no 1.0.1.0 .exe only original 1.0.1.0 but no cracked one:S:S and patch is included with ""1.01 repack...."" fuck this shitpack!!! "

,sapsafe,2011-05-10T22:41Z,i wonder why RELOADED or others didnt make the crack yet.
,stuck4ever,2011-05-11T02:40Z,"@Rando_q1
How disappointing !
@sapsafe
I think we can now say that it's done, it's uncrackable (if that's a word)...if it could've been cracked, it would have been till now

Why oh Why, out of all the f*cking games, this one had to be it !!"
,Rando_q1,2011-05-11T09:10Z,thats the first game what im going to buy.
,OKFMDOA,2011-05-11T09:23Z,If it's that important to you why not just buy it?  It was going for $18 at one point.  There will be more sales.

Thanks for the link dude, awesome find !

I can confirm that this works.
I can't comment on the input lag cuz I don't own a wheel.
But for me, I got a 20 fps boost with same settings with this new crack !!!
Graphical quality seems to be improved too.
No crashes or infinite loading.

BUT, if you have used any unlockers to unlock the limited edition events/cars, they won't work :(
Hope someone changes that too."

the patch overwrites many files and it probably overwriting the modified files, So you need to install the mods over again, The HP & LE car unlockers work for me quite well. "

details on how to unlock bonus stuff properly

if you don't mod the exe the porsche autobild wont stay in the game and the limited edition events wont unlock with out modding the exe.

Sad some of those events were great.
