Angel a band out of New York City discovered by Gene Simmons(Kiss)Soon became Label Mates as long as they did not open for KISS(Gene Simmons orders)Because He knew that they had KISS beat Musically all the way!!! It is to bad that there sucess would only spawn 5 Albums before fading away.I will have more ANGEL Torrents soon. Abe
