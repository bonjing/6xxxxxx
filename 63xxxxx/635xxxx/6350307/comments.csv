,richardpa,2011-04-28T17:08Z,"@Mulreay...  I used the VLC audio track synchronization at +0.600's and it brought it back into sync, but if your burning this to disc your still going to be shafted..."

,Dalareaux,2011-04-29T08:10Z,"yeah, audio is not bad, just WAY out of sync, beyond being fixable with j&k in vlc...I went all the way to -400ms and the sound was still happening way before the action...not bad quality though, wish I knew how to fix it myself. doesn't happen the whole movie either, the beginning was perfect."
,aradiel,2011-04-29T10:56Z,"The screen caps aren't dead links, it's just TPB is blocked as a referrer. You can use addons to hide your referrer and then the links work fine in Firefox. I use RefControl."

,dulhanr,2011-04-29T15:56Z,"RefControl gets the job done

@aradiel is correct the add-on can be used to hide or forge the referrer as TPB and then it works fine

Install the add-on
Add a new site from RefControl options 
Copy and Paste the link as ""imageshack.us""
and then select Forge
then ur done! Links work fine then!"

The audio in this file is comparable to the ""The Stone"" early dvdrip release: horrible; ruins the movie. "
,s3xt0y,2011-05-01T17:52Z,"0.8 is vlc does not work, its just out of sync and cannot be fixed with slowing it down or speeding it up via vlc, sitting here watching it at hour 1, minute 6 pretty good movie so far, lawyer going through an intense battle with his client. 

V9A6(out of sync at roughly 45-50 minutes in and the audio goes lower at that time like its two different movie tracks put into one.)"
,RedBusterd,2011-05-01T20:24Z,good cam nice upload good movie too. Audio over video @ 33 min mark or so but easy to fix +0.700 worked for me (see above comments).
,paris84,2011-05-02T22:55Z,"Audio is terrible. Background noise makes it hard to hear what is being said. 2nd half is totally out of sync. Wait for better people.

Will never again download a R5. Will wait for good quality."
,romany1203,2011-05-04T12:02Z,Not impressed with copy or the audio.

The Audio sync was not so great.
No thanks to the comments about messing with my VLC Audio sync settings, screwed up the next show.
Good news, VLC has a RESET ALL button. Then restart at least VLC to get back on track!"

Use convertXtodvd, load file in convertXtodvd, look for source file in the window where the movie is loaded. There you can offset the the video to match the audio. 

I am unsure how many milliseconds is needed to burn this vid as I have yet to download this video.

I think convertXtodvd says 10 is 30 seconds or something, look on there site to see what their offset ratio is to get a idea of how many ms's is needed."
