Rain is back on the mat after a brief hiatus. This tall, thin, tan, big titted blond is one of the most competitive girls we have on the roster. Simply put, she hates to lose. She is wiry and when she wraps those long legs around your body you are going to get crushed into submission.

Aiden Ashley won her debut match against an experienced rookie and won hard. This Featherweight is strong, fast and tenacious. With the absence of Tia Ling, Aiden might grab the featherweight title if she keeps up this level of intensity and effort on the mat.

This was a great back and forth match up. Rain looked a little rusty and got handled by the smaller girl until Rain's determination and competitiveness took over and Aiden soon found herself on the receiving end of some brutal body scissors. Both girls felt the power of the other, but in the end one girl remains undefeated this season and one girl is humiliated and fucked like a loser hard on the mat.
