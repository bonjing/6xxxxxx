Two brothers lose their mother to an incurable disease. With the power
of "alchemy", they use taboo knowledge to resurrect her. The process fails,
and as a toll for using this type of alchemy, the older brother, Edward Elric
loses his left leg while the younger brother, Alphonse Elric loses his entire
body. To save his brother, Edward sacrifices his right arm and is able to
affix his brother's soul to a suit of armor. With the help of a family friend,
Edward receives metal limbs - "automail" - to replace his lost ones.
With that, Edward vows to search for the Philosopher's Stone to
return the brothers to their original bodies, even if it means
becoming a "State Alchemist", one who uses his/her
alchemy for the military.

Most of my uploads are encoded / compressed to their smallest possible file size for the intended use of users
with minimal hard-drive space and a basic monitor. The quality IMO is still pretty decent though for the filesizes.
But, those of you who have a higher res monitor, may notice a drop in quality, if this bothers you, look elsewhere.
That simple, I will not bend on my methods.Thank you to those that enjoy my torrents, I enjoy sharing them with you.
