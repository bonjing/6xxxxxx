BBC Versailles The Dream of a King HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup 2009

Drama-documentary recreating the life and loves of France's most famous king, Louis XIV. Dubbed the Sun King by his admiring court, Louis conquered half of Europe, conducted dozens of love affairs and dazzled his contemporaries with his lavish entertainments. But perhaps his greatest achievement - and certainly his longest lasting love - was the incredible palace he built at Versailles, one of the wonders of the world. Filmed in the spectacular rooms and gardens of Versailles itself.
