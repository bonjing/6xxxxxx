[T],Shepard76,2011-05-01T12:31Z,"Thanks. When I click on Patch.exe nothing happens. Is that normal? 
Also, when I use HAMACHI I don't if I should enter 127.0.0.1 as host ip or the IP created randomly by HAMACHI. Thanks. "
,ItsDrastik,2011-05-01T13:29Z,"Thanks for the upload, works 100%.
Great work FTL3, you have helped Portal 2 fans everywhere.

@Shepard76 - The Patch edits things in the background without notification, so when you double click it, its actually doing its job, but you just cant see it. As for your Hamachi situation, enter the Hamachi IP address as the host. 127.0.0.1 is your local machine, which means you and only you would be able to connect."
,FTL3,2011-05-01T14:35Z,credit goes to some random warez forum guy. his name is on the program =D

To play coop over lan or Hamachi:

1) Enter the game one both computers and Enable Developer Console in the options.

2) Hit "" ` "" to open the console. Then type in... sv_lan 1.

3) The client should connect first as it disconnects if the host is in the empty game for a few seconds, but the client can wait forever.
Client: Type into the console... connect replacing the with an ip.
For example... connect 192.168.1.3

4) Host then selects the map by entering into their own console... map mp_coop_ replacing the with the name of the map of choice listed below.
For example... map mp_coop_start

5) The host will connect and the client will see the blue bar fill, finally entering the game.

,tbs2008wme,2011-05-04T02:14Z,"the file patch.exe contain virus 
dont download this shit"
,art00rz,2011-05-05T02:33Z,"fr334a11 I don't understand your instructions at all... there is no ""developer console"" in my options. 

it works perfectly though, it took a while to figure out. If anyone as computer stupid as me is having trouble, just put your Hamachi IP address (the one that starts with 5) as the host IP, have the client click ""connect"". When the client is at the logo page, right before the loading, click ""start hosting"" and it should work :)

needs to have .net framework 2.0 or above installed and also portal 2 update 3."
,art00rz,2011-05-05T02:34Z,oh and thanks for this upload! :D

,GizmoTheGreen,2011-05-11T21:46Z,"Don't click patch.exe, all it does from what I can tell is put some folding at home clients in your appdata folder and executing them.

slows both your cpu and gpu down alot."
