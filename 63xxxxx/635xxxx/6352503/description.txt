"The Pinocchio in the Planter"

The team identifies the remains of a 
successful ad man found in the 
grounds of a newly built community 
center playground. Upon inspecting 
the victim's home and interrogating 
his former partner and employer, 
Booth and Brennan discover that the 
victim burned bridges by adopting an 
aggressive attitude toward honesty 
and was a member of a radical 
honesty support group. Meanwhile, 
each of the team members attempts to 
adopt a more honest way of 
communicating that doesn't always 
lend itself to good relationships, 
and Angela urges Hodgins to confront 
the realities of their pregnancy.

Enjoy :)
