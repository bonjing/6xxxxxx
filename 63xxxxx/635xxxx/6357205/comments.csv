There was a torrent on called Nuns with guns or something like that and a user had a link saying that there is a crowd out uploading these low budget films and then suing the people that download them.

It mainly happens in the USA but im staying away from them.""

Be sure to use a VPN *AND* an anti-shyster-lawyer device such as PeerBlock to be sure no one is making a living by offering something to you with no other commercial viability to it.

Hmm..hard to find AND lawsuitlandmine ridden when you do...what is the internet turning into???  Thanks, uploader."
