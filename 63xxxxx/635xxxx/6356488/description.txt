This is a simple puzzle game where you match 3 GHOSTS of the same color.

Moving PAC-MAN is the key to getting a high score. Make use of the ROTATE button to get PAC-MAN to gobble up a range of items. When he chomps on an item lots of GHOSTS disappear at once! Gobbling a POWER PELLET causes all the GHOSTS to TURN-TO-BLUE!
Eat as much as possible to get rid of those pesky GHOSTS.

In later levels you'll run into even more types of GHOST.


[Game modes]

*In NORMAL mode eliminate pesky GHOSTS to fill up the time gauge and clear each level.

-HARD CORE
*In HARD CORE mode the gauge empties faster than NORMAL mode, resulting in an action-packed race against time.

-SCRAMBLE
*In SCRAMBLE mode rush frantically to build up your score as high as possible within the time limit!
