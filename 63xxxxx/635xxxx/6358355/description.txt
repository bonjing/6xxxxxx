MoveCopyJpg V2.1
Date: Maj 1, 2011
Short Description: Copy/Move JPG/GIF/PNG images recursively within subfolders.


Developers note:

A small but very useful tool, especially after ripping/copying entire websites and you need to find the images inside all the chaos.

Works with .JPG, .GIF and .PNG files.

I desided to make this small application after using the HTTrack Website Copier that copied images in their respective folders. Which meant that I had to go through alot of folders and copy each one .... one folder at a time.

Requirements: .NET 3.5 and additional V2.0 .NET framework



Here\'s how to use the application:


Run the application (dobbeltclick the MoveCopyJpg.exe icon :-)

Choose what kind of images you want to copy/move using the radiobuttons - Jpg, Gif or Png

Choose wether to move or copy files - leaving the checkbox unchecked will just copy the files.

Input minimum width and minimum height of the images that you want to copy/move - Entering anything larger than 0 in either boxes will make the application check each image which of course will use a considerable amount of extra time.
Leaving the boxes empty or entering 0 will jump across the imagesize checking and move/copy very fast.


Click \"Go!\" and a folder dialog will open where you first choose the source folder.

After clicking \"Ok\" in the first folder dialog, another folder dialog opens where you choose the destination folder (where you want to copy/move the files to\"

Click \"Ok\" and everything is cool. After it finish a messagebox with some info appears.
