Before a torrent appears on a website like TPB, the original file is shared on FTP Topsites and Usenet by the scene groups.
Splitting the the file in to archives this way is to save bandwidth (If part of the download is corrupted, its easier to re-download a small part than download the whole thing again. File corruption is fairly common on newsgroups)
Many newsgroup servers (usenet) also have a maximum allowed attachment size.

Although splitting like this is unnecessary on torrents, it's just a relic from the original source."

Clearly the operative word here is relic. Although what you said is some sort of explanation of the origins of this bad habit it hardly makes it necessary for uploaders to do this. After all I assume that they have at least unrared the contents once to make sure that it really is what it claims before uploading it to the pirate bay so there is no reason to upload the rar-files.

Also being concerned about being able to download only a little part should make them extra sensitive to other people to do the same (for example only download the sample, if one is included). This is of course impossible when you rar the content.

I think the real explanation often is that the uploaders don't understand what they are doing. A lot of people really think that packing files make them smaller regardless of content."

These are probably uploaded automatically, so there's no one unpacking or checking them. No need to really check either, since they're scene releases.

It also isn't about size, since scene rules prohibit compression. Have a closer look at the archives next time. The files are exactly the same size when you unpack them. No compression allowed.

This has the added benefit that you don't *need* to unpack them. Just use a video player that allows you to play the RAR files directly (such as VLC or MPlayer).

And no issue with downloading only parts either, since scene TV release archives contain only that single video file. Sample files are in a separate subdirectory and un-packed.

So I really don't see what the big deal is. Some people prefer just the unpacked video file, others prefer the original scene archives, with the decisive difference being that you can go from packed to unpacked, but not from unpacked back to original scene archives. "
