    Tony Robinson and geophys boffin John Gater look back      
    over 200 digs at the extraordinary achievements of        
    cutting-edge geophysics technology, which has uncovered  
    lost Roman villas, tombs, temples and ancient monuments   
    as well as a host of old broken tractor bits and           
    enigmatic ditches.                                        
                                                             
    The science of geophys has changed out of all             
    recognition: 20 years ago the team huddled around a        
    dotmatrix printer as it slowly produced a geophysical     
    picture of an abbey hidden underground; now they can     
    produce complex three-dimensional images of whole         
    buildings within minutes.                                  
                                                              
    In an effort to finally understand what geophys          
    actually means, Tony buries 10 objects in a field and     
    challenges John to use his technological arsenal to        
    identify them all, without digging. Can geophys now       
    tell the difference between a bicycle and a toilet?

     This episode was NOT broadcast in High Definition         
     should be pretty obvious from the quality, our source    
     as usual was Channel 4 HD.                              
     Channel 4's ep listing is a real pain in the ass, they   
     have this listed as series 19 episode 2 and also as a     
     special.
