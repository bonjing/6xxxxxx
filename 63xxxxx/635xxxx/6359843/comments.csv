,AKat7,2011-08-30T03:21Z,"This torrent is mislabeled.  It is presented as Time Team S18E12, a Time Team program called Castle of the Saxon Kings.  But if you download it, you find the torrent you get is labeled Time Team S19E02 -- a program that doesn't exist.  If you use it to get the program, you end up with TT  S18E13 ""Looking Underground"", a retrospective TT program on geophysics.  This needs to be fixed."
