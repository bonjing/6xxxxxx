Battle Slots is a roleplaying game (RPG) with a twist.
Embark on a journey of exploration into the foreign
world of Tellus. Formerly a peaceful world, Tellus has
been wrought by an evil plaguing the land. Every land
needs a hero, and thats where you come in. A map-driven
adventure, you will travel across over 100 unique
locations, battling monsters and completing nearly 200
daring quests. Taking the place of traditional RPG dice
or number generators is a customizable, magical slot
machine - however there is no gambling. Battle Slots
harnesses the excitement of popular Slot Machine
mechanics, progressing your adventure through fantastic
gameplay. Spinning the slot machine yields Magic Points,
Attack Points, Experience Points, Gold, and Summons.
Magic Points and Attack Points are used to cast
techniques that yield devastation upon monsters
throughout the world of Tellus. Experience Points allow
you to gain levels and boast higher Health, Attack, and
Magic Point totals. The Gold earned can be used in the
world to upgrade the Academy and the Zoo or purchase
Runes, Techniques, or Slot Symbols. When the slot
machine pays out a summons, the creature called for will
appear and cast its effect. These summons may stun
opponents, deliver gold, or place Wilds throughout the
reels of your slot machine.
