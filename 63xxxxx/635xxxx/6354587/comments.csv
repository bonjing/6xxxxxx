,aeristilheartly,2011-06-02T08:08Z,"I've done everything I can think of, I set up the hosts but it's either I leave it on now or risk losing the program, all the serial numbers, after its shut down, it requires me to enter in a new one, and of coarse I don't do it at random, I've got the last one in now and I'm afraid to shut it down because I'll lose my last chance at the system, what can I do?"

,midweekdolphin,2011-07-20T23:47Z,"It's important to re-boot after updating the hosts file and ALSO to check to see if the changes are still there after the reboot. just trying to help. additionally, some of these adobe products check slightly different servers, so instead of replacing the hosts file info from each torrent, add the new info to your current file. hope that helps!"
,lordamit,2011-08-10T17:03Z,Thank you!
,thunderstuck,2011-08-19T00:30Z,I m downloading right now... I only wonder if it will work... Do I need a Keygen or a Crack or anything?
,rockdolfolk,2011-09-05T01:06Z,i have the same problem of the serials. Is there a keygen or a loader to avoid the check?
,molotovkoktail,2011-09-23T13:06Z,"- To disable Adobe calling home, use Little Snitch (mac) or smth like Comodo (windows) to block outgoing calls from Adobe. This should solve deactivation.
- For mac users wishing to use Flash Builder: download the master collection from adobe and use latest Core keygen. "
