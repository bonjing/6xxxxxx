,Navyrules,2011-05-03T20:59Z,"@wizkid24, the episode that you have d/l'd is not the genuine eztv u/l. ""fm Navyrules previously,Hi, well I registered on eztv and discovered that you never password your d/l's, so this is an apology and admit that I was duped. Please continue with the awesome work, you guys ROCK"" seems you will have to download again. check the skull next to eztv to see if it is Original. Sorry kid, seems you were duped as well. "
,Navyrules,2011-05-03T21:03Z,"@sandracibaite, seems you were duped, eztv does not password their uploads. Check for green skull, indicates original. Sorry me thinks you will have to d/l again"
