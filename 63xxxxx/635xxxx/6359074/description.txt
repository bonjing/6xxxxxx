Notes:

 - This is a reseed/mirror; not my encode. I couldn't find this movie here, and when I did find it elsewhere, the documentation showed it was originally from here. So, now it's back, and thank you to SamuelBeckett22 for originally providing it.
 
 - Although I'm easily impressed, I do think 5.2 is an underrating for this movie. 6 at least would suffice, although I think Anthony Perkins unfortunately acted (literally) as a justification for the low rating. The film is also rather dated, but I like dated. :^) The movie's real claim to fame is its theme song, which anyone who lived through the 1970's would instantly recognize. It's also a visually beautiful movie and well encoded, so very watchable.

 - Please make sure to seed as much as you download and do your part so that free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to at least 101%, no torrent would ever die.
