,Explodee,2011-04-30T04:40Z,WinAVI has never worked right for me. Even this one. No offense to you uploader. In this case it will only convert like 1/3rd of the video. A 25 min show was converted to 11 mins. A 11min show to 1 min and a movie to about 20 mins. What's the deal? Anyone else experiencing this?
