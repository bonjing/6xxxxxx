With similar sounds to The Kooks (you might remember them), The Coral and The Dandy Warhols (sort of) and given 5/5 by "Bingham" (whoever the hell that is), The Brightsparks are a four-piece indie band from Rochdale in Greater Manchester, Uk.

These four friendly characters love what they do and are incredibly talented; handing out their E.P. for free at gigs, they've decided to take things to another level to help improve their following by releasing over the Mininova network. Released under Creative Commons (Non-Commercial-Share Alike), they want you to download and to take a listen. You're not going to regret it.
