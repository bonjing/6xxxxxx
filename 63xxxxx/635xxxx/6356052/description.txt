When one looks back at the alternative rock scene that dominated the first half of the 90s, Garbage's self-titled debut album immediately comes to mind as a defining album from that movement. It has stood the test of time and not only contains some of the best singles from the 90s, but is a modern-day classic. The songs are incredibly infectious and danceable, but it's undeniably a rock album, with crunching guitars, intense drumming and a charismatic frontwoman. In an era of post-grunge Garbage's brand of rock/pop/retro offered a refreshing change of pace, and cynical lyrics for cynical times.
