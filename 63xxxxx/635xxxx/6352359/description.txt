"Applied Anthropology and Culinary Arts"

When the Anthropology class assembles for 
their final exam, Shirley (Yvette Nicole 
Brown) notices a twinge, which quickly 
escalates into full-blown labor. As Jeff 
(Joel Mchale) and Britta (Gillian Jacobs) 
argue about how best to help, Chang (Ken 
Jeong) is anxious to claim this "early" 
labor as clear evidence that it's a 
"Chang Baby!" Meanwhile, Greendale is 
hosting a World Food Festival in the 
parking lot and a riot ensues - Dean 
Pelton (Jim Rash) is caught in the 
crossfire.

Enjoy :)
