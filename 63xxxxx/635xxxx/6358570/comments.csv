,FTL3,2011-05-01T09:31Z,Credits to some random warez forum guy. It's an installer and pre-cracked so just unpack everything to the Crysis 2 folder even if you can't read the Russian words =X
,FTL3,2011-05-01T09:59Z,"if the web seed doesn't work please add ""http://"" in front of the web seed address (in utorrent, that's under torrent properties). Thanks."

,EndFED,2011-05-03T01:08Z,there is a patch update file about 128k. Didnt want to work and the official patch 1.4 is 58MB. so the total size should be  little bit more than 100MB. I dont like the other 128k file.
,Reddoguk,2011-05-03T01:14Z,"It worked online (1.4) for a few days but now they have closed the hole and server side key check is back in place.

So no online for now. A real keygen might not work either since keys are tired to user accounts."
