I do always include running time it is listed under: 

Duration: 02:17:11"

,kludge420,2011-06-12T00:32Z,"So to answer the quesiton:

137 min = director's cut/collector's edition

This is the 1998 version without the space ship interior shots but is what Spielberg considers the best version. He regretted putting the space ship scenes in the special edition so left them out of this one. "
