[V],twentyforty,2011-05-01T18:47Z,"@abciscrazy: Well, as I explained before, in cases as this one (when I have BluRay in my hands for very limited time only) I must make valid decision - one time only. 4WAF is two hours long and what is more important - it is 16/9 not 2.35/1 theatrical aspect ratio and gains in making the encode smaller by choosing 480p instead of 720p get smaller.

[V],twentyforty,2011-05-01T18:48Z,"...
4WAF as 480p probably would be 700 MB, and I cannot make it smaller, without seriously compromising the quality. Combination of these two factors derives the format we have.

Regardless - Four weddings and a funeral was REQUESTED here, some two weeks ago as - 720p. Delivered.

And it's gone (BR disk). In future, as always, I will do everything I can, but following my own ""metrics"", strange to many.

And you were one of those who haven't behaved too nice. Anyhow, your current ""mode"" is more likable. Please, keep it that way."

The quality of 4WAF is awesome.

I ripped Malcolm X yesterday...Took 15 hrs and 30 mins at 721 MB...The movie is 3 hrs 21 mins long.

If you knew how hazardous ripping process is.You wouldn't have said this."
