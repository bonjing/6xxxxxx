           A gang of crooks robbing cash collectors, run into a           
           police surveillance team and the inadequate police             
           response results in a gunfight. A TV crew on assignment        
           in the area happens to capture this humiliation on             
           camera, and this example of police incompetence is soon        
           the lead story in every news bulletin. Public confidence       
           in law and order now suffers irreparable harm. The head        
           of the Moscow force welcomes a public search-and-destroy       
           operation against these thugs, the brainchild of Katya,        
           his PR director. She proposes that the capture of this         
           dangerous gang be transformed into a live TV show of a         
           kind never seen before. At this point she cannot know          
           that the gang leader's life-and-death struggle with the        
           police is destined to lead to a media duel. Besieged in a      
           huge apartment block, the crooks hold hostage a father         
           and his son and daughter. A massive special forces rescue      
           operation is mounted but fails miserably. Undaunted by         
           this setback, Katya and her team of specialists                
           manipulate the footage to create the illusion of victory.      
           Incensed by this version of events broadcast on TV, gang       
           leader Herman strikes back. Using the boy's computer he        
           uploads to the Internet his own footage of this debacle        
           and starts broadcasting from the apartment via a web           
           camera. The first shots have now been fired in an              
           information war, whose survivors and victors have yet to       
           emerge.
