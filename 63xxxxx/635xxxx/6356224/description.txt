The "James Bond Theme" is the main signature theme of the James Bond films and is featured in every "official" (EON Productions) 007 film since Dr. No in different versions. The piece has been used as an accompanying fanfare to the gun barrel sequence in almost every James Bond film.
The "James Bond Theme" has accompanied the opening titles twice, as part of the medley that opens Dr. No and then again in the opening credits of From Russia with Love. It has been used as music over the end credits for Dr. No, Thunderball, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, The World Is Not Enough, Casino Royale, and Quantum of Solace.
