O'Conner and Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) arrive in Rio de Janeiro expecting to find Dominic, but their friend Vince (Matt Schulze) has not heard from him for weeks. Vince needs O'Conner and Mia to help on a job he had lined up for Toretto: stealing 3 cars from a train (a DeTomaso Pantera GTS, a Ford GT40, and a Chevrolet Corvette Grand Sport Roadster). The job goes awry when O'Conner notices that there are DEA agents on-board the train, and the cars had been seized in a raid. Toretto arrives late, and realises that the crew is only interested in one of the three cars. With Mia's help, they are able to steal the Ford GT40 the crew is after and escape, but a shoot-out ensues and the three DEA agents are killed in the cross-fire. O'Conner and Toretto escape, only to be apprehended by Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), a corrupt Brazilian businessman and the owner of the cars. After killing Reyes' men, O'Conner and Toretto meet Mia at their safehouse in Favela and begin taking the car apart to find out what Reyes was after. Vince returns to the safehouse hours later, claiming he was being followed, but gives himself away when he tries to take a computer chip out the custom-built DVD player in the car. Toretto accesses the files on the chip to discover it is a shipping manifest of all Reyes' business activities, and evidence of how he is laundering over one hundred million dollars."
