,juggazappadad,2011-05-02T01:25Z,"hey torrentzone, thanks for the up most aprecated for sure. However after seeding all day long today and now trying to download for myself I would like to say that we need a better system for downloaders who seed. We shouldn't get the bone for doing things the right way. Im sure there will always be leechers who never seed so Im thinking a verifyible(?never a great speller)guest list. IDK just an idea to help speed things up. Thanks again torrentzone im sure your quality is great as always."
