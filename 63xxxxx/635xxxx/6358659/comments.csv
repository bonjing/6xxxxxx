,d15a5t3r,2011-05-16T05:23Z,"Excuse me but all your ini files are corrupt in this download, please take it down and re-upload if you have a genuine copy. Unfortunately I cannot allow myself to get banned because the ISO was not properly extracted from the disk. My friend downloaded this game a couple days ago right here, and after thirty minutes or so his box froze up on him and was banned when rebooted. If you are going to release an ISO verify it first please."
