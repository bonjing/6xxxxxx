This is another excellent product from DK Publishing of New York, a company known for spectacular presentations in its quality books (great graphics and how-to color illustrations), and for the qualifications of its authors. --Sacramento Bee
Product Description
As we come to rely on technology in almost every aspect of our everyday lives, there is a large and ever-growing interest in how we would survive without the conveniences of the modern age. The Survival Book shows you not only how to adapt in such circumstances, but also how to thrive in the wilderness environment.

Packed with specially commissioned, crystal-clear, step-by-step illustrations for every survival technique, from what to do if you meet a bear in the woods to how to navigate by the stars, this book also includes exciting stories of real-life survival-what happened, who survived, and how they did it.
