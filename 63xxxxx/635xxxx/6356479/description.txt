Shot on location in New York and Los Angelesâ€”Mean Streets comes vividly to life. The film centers on the struggles of four residents of Little Italy, all men in their mid-20s who aspire to be gangsters, loan sharks or just plain hoods. There is Tony (David Proval), the big friendly one who runs the neighborhood bar; Michael (Richard Romanus), a small-time loan shark who likes to rip off naive teenagers from Brooklyn; Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro), a crazy, irresponsible hood, who has a penchant for blowing up mail boxes and borrowing money from loan sharks he never intends to pay back; and Charlie (Harvey Keitel), the well-dressed nephew of the local mafia boss Giovanni (Cesare Danova), who wants nothing more than to run his own restaurant.
Charlie is torn between the life of the streets (and trying to keep Johnny Boy out of trouble) and the life his uncle can give him. He is also deeply religious, patterning himself after St. Francis of Assisiâ€”testing his faith and seeking penitence for his sins on the streets. The testing of this faith takes the form of Johnny Boy and his sister Teresa (Amy Robinson). Charlie's uncle doesn't want Charlie to keep company with either of these peopleâ€”Johnny Boy because he seems to be so unstable, and Teresa because she is an epileptic.
