How do you move monstrous mammals, enormous elephants, restless 
rhinos, hefty horses and speedy sharks?  You call in the services of 
the big movers.  These larger than life characters are working with 
the ultimate delivery deadline - their cargo must arrive on time, 
intact....and alive. Follow specialist teams of animal movers, vets and 
transport engineers as they attempt to relocate animals across the 
globe by air and road in new episodes of Animal Mega Moves.

Horses
When 15 of the world's top racehorses are due to be taken from London
to Hong Kong, the operation that ensues is a massive one. In a journey
that includes a 12-hour flight aboard a Boeing 747, there's lots of
potential for things to go wrong. Follow the team responsible for making
sure it all runs smoothly.
