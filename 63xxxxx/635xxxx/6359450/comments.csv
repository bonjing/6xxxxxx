Thanks."
,RoscoPicotron,2011-05-08T21:25Z,"@thethingy.. please man if your gunna upload a torrent with one file, please explain the contents.
(the easiest way to fuck with adobe is to download their trials and then crack them) but i dont know if you've got a trial, fixed install or what. Also it would be awesome if you could have some instructions somewhere else then the torrent. Again so i can see what the fuck im doing with this torrent before i download it.

Afterwards you can continue using it, but your Sequence Presets will be *severely limited* to a few things like DVCAM and HDDVCAM. No more options for normal formats like DSLR 1080p or 720p. Apparently this is a bug with the actual version, with the program reverting to Demo functionality.

You can easily create a new timeline based on a the video file's settings with the create new icon at the base of the import window, just drag the video onto the icon. close the preset window if it doesn't have presets, now make a timeline based on your file EASY , accomplishes the SAME THING. Learn how to use this program before you call the torrent useless. its not his fault your are ignorant, torrent is good.

,altrego99,2012-04-18T21:02Z,"shamazam exactly why I am hesitating to install this. Look at the size - 1.46GB! Wtf did they put in 1.46GB? I am all ears for any good alternatives that you may know about. I tried some free ones, and Wax seems to be atleast able to import the video file where Lightworks couldn't import any damn thing short of individual jpegs, but Wax doesn't play sound in preview mode.
Excellent torrent though."
