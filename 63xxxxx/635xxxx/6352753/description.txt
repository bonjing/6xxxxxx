"Everything Sunny All the Time Always"

Liz (Fey) realizes that she needs to

encounters an obstacle along the way. 
Meanwhile, Jack (Alec Baldwin) has his 
own problems to deal with when Avery 
(guest star Banks) is held hostage. 
Elsewhere, Tracy (Tracy Morgan) finds 
out that Kenneth (Jack McBrayer), 
Dotcom (Kevin Brown) and Grizz (Grizz 
Chapman) have bonded in his absence.
