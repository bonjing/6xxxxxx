More than 22 million of the almost 173 million working age individuals in the United States have one or more disabilities. "Perfectly Able" offers practical guidance for companies large and small on how to hire and retain talented and motivated people from within this largely untapped pool of potential employees. Illustrated with enlightening personal stories, this one-of-a-kind book provides insight into what it's like to seek employment as an individual with a disability. 

Readers will discover how to: evaluate how suited their workplace environment is for disabled or different employees and what needs to be changed; improve and sustain their workforce by hiring the best people, regardless of any disability or diversity issue; effectively recruit, place, and develop individuals with disabilities who can contribute to their company's success; and embrace the differences among their workforce to add value to the organization.
