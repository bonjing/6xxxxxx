,SiN-R,2011-08-20T04:33Z,CTRL+Z which is saving my life DOES NOT WORK >:(
,SiN-R,2011-08-20T04:44Z,"and now type tool does not work :\
and HOW to fix this? just open another window and get back to illustrator"
,mark17022,2011-08-22T03:50Z,"Both Ctrl-Z and Type tool work fine for me in Win 7 x64. Only weird thing that I see is that you have to click twice on the menus to make them drop down and sometimes a menu name stays highlighted so the shortcut keys don't work. You just have to hit escape twice or the Alt key till the menu is not highlighted

I had this problem with a portable version of Photoshop too."
