The Weight of Chains is a Canadian documentary film that takes a critical look at the role that the US, NATO and the EU played in the tragic breakup of a once peaceful and prosperous European state - Yugoslavia. The film, bursting with rare stock footage never before seen by Western audiences, is a creative first-hand look at why the West intervened in the Yugoslav conflict, with an impressive roster of interviews with academics, diplomats, media personalities and ordinary citizens of the former Yugoslav republics. This film also presents positive stories from the Yugoslav wars - people helping each other regardless of their ethnic background, stories of bravery and self-sacrifice.

It is a work of art cutting through multiple layers of propanganda that envelopes Yugoslav conflict and is the first documentary showing the conflict as it really was: the chain of events incited by global political elite in order to subjugate Yugoslav economy, colonize the newly created states and impose the puppet politial elites in them.

The sufferring people are grateful for all contributions to dissemination of truth regarding the colonization of Yugoslavia and everything they have been through due to that.
