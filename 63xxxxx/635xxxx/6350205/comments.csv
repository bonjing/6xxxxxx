Personal Notes
-----------------
While 3rd party plugins may seem ""sexy"" to download and add to photoshop; keep this in mind:

1. The BEST plugin is KNOWLEDGE.
2. Using plugins; you never learn how to do it correctly.
3. You don't have full control of the plugin.

The best advice i can give to anyone who use Photoshop is pick up a tutorial or try to do things on your own. This way, you learn new things during the process. Photoshop can do everything needed when it comes to graphics design. 

Why bog down Photoshop wtih unnecessary plugins? "

Great uploads so far. Do you have a Photoshop CS5 64 bit in the works? Some of us have more than 3GB of ram and would like to make use."
,hamdi,2011-05-12T21:12Z,thank you for this. if i may: how come i cannot open DNG files with it? what do I have to install in addition? thank you
,hamdi,2011-05-13T13:02Z,anyone???
,hamdi,2011-05-13T14:05Z,here is a workaround: in case someone is interested. i installed a trial copy and copied updated files from trial version to portable's app/photoshopcs5 directory. i have no idea if i screwed up anything else while doing it but it seems to work fine now...without the DNG support it is useless anyway
,hamdi,2011-05-13T14:53Z,"too bad one cannot delete comments. the workaround is no good...once you remove the trial version, it is the same problem: CANNOT READ DNGs with this version. "
,hamdi,2011-05-13T14:55Z,too bad one cannot delete comments. the workaround is no good. once the trail version is uninstalled  the portable failed to open DNG files.
,anish114,2011-05-16T13:41Z,what is the diffrnce between this release and the previous release of yours ?
,anish114,2011-05-16T13:42Z,no seeds:(
,ElRafaEl,2011-05-16T20:18Z,There's 82 seeds and I'm one of them right now. Something is wrong on your end.
,Paperweight67,2011-05-19T10:06Z,"Thanks! Awesome, man. The regular Photoshop install is horrendous! I had to reformat my computer. Keep up the good work!"
,EnkiTheCreator,2011-06-03T23:16Z,Any chance you can make a portable that contains all the apps from CS 5.5 Collection.
,Lythimus,2011-06-07T07:40Z,This torrent is not downloading or magneting for me (I tried the previous version and it works fine so it's not TPB). Could someone report a link or repost the same torrent on TPB? I'd appreciate it as I can't find this seeded or large file uploaded anywhere else. Thanks.
,ReeceM,2011-06-30T01:58Z,"Working flawlessly so far, currently seeding."
,Amy McGregor,2011-07-21T06:14Z,Oh man oh man! Thank you for this :3 It works like a clockwork. I have missed the lite/portable verson so much.
,SiN-R,2011-07-21T11:25Z,"No input file specified.
