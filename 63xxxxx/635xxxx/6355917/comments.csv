,aaronator,2011-05-08T00:17Z,I'm not sure how to work the crack... Could someone explain please?
,Elveerdig,2011-05-10T14:49Z,More seeders pls :) Don't hit and run!
,Renich,2011-05-13T09:57Z,"Two things for the crack:

1. Put and overwrite the Live 8.2.2.exe with the one provided by the crack. The location, on my system, is at: c:/Program Files (x86)/Ableton/Live 8.2.2/Program

2. After doiing this, just run live, and drag the Authorize822.auz file into live. You may need to say ""yeah, whatever"" to some screens

p.s. don't update it, ok?!"
,Elveerdig,2011-05-13T18:59Z,"Hi Renich,

Can you elaborate on step 2? Do we need to run ableton live and then put .auz file in somewhere?"
,Elveerdig,2011-05-13T19:05Z,"Nvm, got it working i guess !! Thank you"
,majikmann,2011-05-16T23:31Z,"I keep getting ""the authorization file is invalid on this computer"" message.. any suggestions? "

,TKRandall,2011-06-15T18:15Z,"steps for the crack:
1) download the file
2) after download is complete go to the location of the downloaded ableton file. Click on the file then click the Ableton Live Suite 8.2.2 file and run 'setup'.
3) once it has installed replace the live 8.2.2 programe in your programe files (mine was located at 'c:/Program Files (x86)/Ableton/Live 8.2.2/Program') with the  live 8.2.2 from the crack folder in the original downloaded ableton folder 
4) once it has been replaced run live 8.2.2 from your programe files
5) when the box comes up saying this is unauthorized leave it up and drag the 'Authorize822.auz' from the ableton crack file onto the message box stating it is not registered
6) it then should say it has registered successfully
7) it will then say you are registered for MAX but don't have it. If you want it click the link it gives you, if not... enjoy ableton! "
