,screamobaby,2011-05-02T18:46Z,thanks!
,allswelles,2011-05-03T11:26Z,Wow! Thanks! Being a latecomer myself I tried to buy these on DVD but they don't bother to officially release all of them!
,zupergirl,2011-05-03T22:37Z,"WOW!
Thanks!
I`m missing a few of these seasons....but NOW I will get them, hooray!"
,allswelles,2011-05-06T04:22Z,Be warned I downloaded season 2 and none of my DVD players (which are all less than a year old) will recognise the .avi files and play them.
,awshsea,2011-05-06T06:07Z,"All seasons are playable. However, I don't guarantee any DVD player compatibility, as I have been watching them on my PC and never on my DVD player.

I can tell for sure, that all these files are good and they can be played back on PC. All of them are xvid or divx files.

I'd say that a good DivX player should be able to play them back all."
,scotch_the_pirate,2011-05-08T15:18Z,"Thanks... a great upload :)

But it's really slow. I have tried downloaded it for a week now and I'm at 75% :(

Please seed."
,scotch_the_pirate,2011-05-13T14:30Z,"I have downloaded the whole package now. The quality on some seasons is terrible. 

Season 01 is ok.
Season 02-06 is terrible - I could'nt watch it.
Season 07 is OK.

I have'nt seen more at the time. I'll be back with more info."
,awshsea,2011-05-13T18:41Z,"I agree that some seasons' quality is worse than the others. Nevertheless I'd say it's not terrible, however perception may depend on your tolerance level :)"
,KaptainKill,2011-05-14T16:25Z,"Not working, the online thing i get is: Damaged Torrent or something. Why? This is the only one i ever got this with."
,Pulverpojken,2011-07-13T21:57Z,"FUCK YOU CUNT! You're retarded.

Season 14 Fiji ISN'T COMPLETE. 

The LAST vote for the winner IS NOT included. "
,crystal_fan_01,2011-09-09T08:47Z,"(a) many, many thanks to Awshsea

(b) hey, Pulv... if you don't like the torrent, why don't you go out, find the final episode of S14, and upload it yourself? Oh, wait, you've never uploaded anything. (Ok, nor have I, but I do seed, and I *am* grateful to the initial uploaders)."
,maria_ozawa,2012-03-05T08:34Z,"Thanx for the amazing upload. This is the only torrent out there (afaik) that seems to have a decent quality for season 9, at least that`s what the filesize suggests. All the other torrents have those 200-250MB files for half of season 9 and there the quality is much worse than the rest. 
Can anyone who d/l this (and has seen the smaller files of the other torrents to compare) confirm?"
,maria_ozawa,2012-03-12T11:31Z,"Quick update: Season 9 quality not much different from the sucky quality of the other torrents, too bad. I hope someone who has got the dvd can do a real rip sometime, def. looking forward to it..."
