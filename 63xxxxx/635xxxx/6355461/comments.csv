,trick420,2011-05-02T04:26Z,Anyone have any clue when Superman (Clark Kent) Learns to actually fly
,CandySlush,2011-05-04T11:52Z,trick420; we will probably see it like the last episode. So very soon! I mean he will learn to fly and then be Superman and Smallville will be finished. Because it's called Smallville not Superman. It is going to be a sad day indeed when it is all over :(
