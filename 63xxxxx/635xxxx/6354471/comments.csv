,some-young-guy,2011-04-29T21:50Z,"Whitey, if I send you the $8, will you grow a pair and go to the theater with the Cam and get something ""useful""?

If not, shut the fuck up and stop bitching about free shit."
,zvengar,2011-04-29T22:46Z,"does not come out for another month,,,WFT?


time traveled?"
,Stargazing,2011-04-30T01:00Z,"Some young guy. Read again and use your brain. People are spreading the same damn copy, quite retarded to download and reupload something is it not?

Zvengar> If this is recorded from a cinema, and cinemas are showing the movie as we speak. Then thereÂ´s no need for time travel. But IÂ´m guessing since piratebay is not known for high standars, that we would need a time traveler guy to get us a nice copy. "

,Vamsay,2011-05-02T12:18Z,"Not that a great quality. Blurry at times, Blinking sometimes and Russian language but then anyways it's a cam and the first of all. Audio quality is good enough and understandable. Over all a great movie to watch in 3D in cinema theatres. Coming to quality A/V : 5/7 and for the people who are whinging about the movie being fake or in Russian or the Quality.. Don't be miser, spend some money and go to a theatre if you can't wait or else shut what's opening and enjoy free stuff and try respecting the uploader."
,some-young-guy,2011-05-04T03:12Z,"@Marshall Law.  Please be mindful that this is the""PIRATE""bay.  i agree with your position that if I dont like it, dont download it.  I disagree with your disdain for language as pirated materials is quite essentially the black market minus the exchange of a unit of currency.  If politeness and etiquette is a high priority of yours, maybe yar needs tah walk the plank.

@Stargazing (pee pee watching) if chumps sit here bitching about the less than reputable quality, or the fact that someone is sharing something that did not originate with them (like 100% of the torrent sharing global population), I recognize them as being part of the problem and not the solution.  So, my question to you is this.  Did I exercise enough brain power  according to your standard of measuring such?"
