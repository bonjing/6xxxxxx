Installing the Bluetooth Driver.......................

Bluesoleil was quiet better."
,lcfmk,2012-02-12T10:28Z,"Tnx man!
Much better then bluesoleil and win7 built in crap!"
,skulldragon,2012-03-28T10:25Z,"Crack works, even on v8.00.12!

It's a bit more complicated to use than BS.
So, if your BS ain't working, then you can try using this instead, but this is not that user friendly.

But then again, if this ain't working neither, then try updating your BS."
,KoryLifyddhb,2012-05-07T09:32Z,"Really cool torrent. No viruses (at least according to Microsoft Security Essentials), activates normally, easy to use. Recommend to anyone. I connected Bluetooth mouse and 2 Nokia mobile phones to my Windows 7 x64 computer with it."
