+1:)"
,Twizted1,2011-05-02T11:11Z,"Little dark in some spots. Watchable though.
First few seconds of ""intro screen"" is cut.
Movie is ""not chopped off"".
Even the ""past credits"" scene is present.

A = 7
V = 8
M = 10
Very End Of Movie = Can't wait for what's next."

,shikibane,2011-05-03T08:57Z,"Like Twizted1 said its a little dark on some parts of the movie and also it zooms in sometimes so you cant read all the subtitles but besides that this is one of the best copies ive seen of this movie so far.

A=7.3
V= about a 6.7 i guess the camera tilts up and down at certain parts of the movie and it zooms in to where the subs are  not fully visible and its a little dark on certain scenes

M=10 It's a very good movie if your a fast a furious fan."
