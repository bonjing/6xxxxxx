,cakes0227,2011-05-05T18:16Z,if we are connecting over lan do we just use hosts regular ip address instead of hamachi?
,T-Rex101,2011-05-06T10:42Z,I have some questions. Can some1 translate it for me. The uploader has bad english so can anyone write it in good english becasue im new to hamachi. pls help :(
,fr334a11,2011-05-09T02:40Z,"To play coop over lan or Hamachi:

1) Enter the game one both computers and Enable Developer Console in the options.

2) Hit "" ` "" to open the console. Then type in... sv_lan 1.

3) The client should connect first as it disconnects if the host is in the empty game for a few seconds, but the client can wait forever.
Client: Type into the console... connect replacing the with an ip.
For example... connect 192.168.1.3

4) Host then selects the map by entering into their own console... map mp_coop_ replacing the with the name of the map of choice listed below.
For example... map mp_coop_start

5) The host will connect and the client will see the blue bar fill, finally entering the game."
,Captain47,2011-05-09T04:49Z,Does anyone know if this works with playing with people online? Or with anyone on a PS3? Or can you only do that with Steam?

When i do it its says steam validation rejected.
Any help?
Thanks"

Works flawless"
,EndFED,2011-05-22T02:57Z,"Litle correction, tunngle is better when you are looking to play with strangers online. Hamachi is better when you play with people in your home."
