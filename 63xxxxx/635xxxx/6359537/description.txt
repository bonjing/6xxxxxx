StarCraft: Brood War is the expansion pack for the award winning military science fiction, real-time strategy video game StarCraft. Released in 1998 for Windows and Mac OS, it was co-developed by Saffire and Blizzard Entertainment. The expansion pack introduced new campaigns, map tilesets, music, extra units for each race, and upgrade advancements. The campaigns continue the story from where the original StarCraft ended,[1] with the sequel StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty continuing from the conclusion of Brood War. The expansion was released in the United States on 30 November 1998.[2]

Brood War was critically well-received, with reviewers praising it for being developed with the care of a full game rather than as an uninspired extra.[3][4][5] As of 31 May 2007, StarCraft and Brood War have sold almost ten million copies combined.[6] The game is especially popular in South Korea, where professional players and teams participate in matches, earn sponsorships, and compete in televised matches.
