Forged: Writing in the Name of God--Why the Bible's Authors Are Not Who We Think They Are 

It is often said, even by critical scholars who should know better, that â€œwriting in the name of anotherâ€ was widely accepted in antiquity. But New York Times bestselling author Bart D. Ehrman dares to call it what it was: literary forgery, a practice that was as scandalous then as it is today. In Forged, Ehrmanâ€™s fresh and original research takes readers back to the ancient world, where forgeries were used as weapons by unknown authors to fend off attacks to their faith and establish their church. So, if many of the books in the Bible were not in fact written by Jesusâ€™s inner circleâ€”but by writers living decades later, with differing agendas in rival communitiesâ€”what does that do to the authority of Scripture?

Ehrman investigates ancient sources to:


Reveal which New Testament books were outright forgeries.


Explain how widely forgery was practiced by early Christian writersâ€”and how strongly it was condemned in the ancient world as fraudulent and illicit. 


Expose the deception in the history of the Christian religion.

Ehrmanâ€™s fascinating story of fraud and deceit is essential reading for anyone interested in the truth about the Bible and the dubious origins of Christianityâ€™s sacred texts.
