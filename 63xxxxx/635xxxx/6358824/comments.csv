Inconscientes / Unconscious (2004)

DVDRip | Lang: Spanish | Subs (srt): English, Portuguese | AVI | 512 x 280 | XviD @ 798 Kbps | mp3 @ 129 Kbps | 01:44:11 | ~700 Mb
Genre: Comedy, Mystery, Romance | 4 wins & 14 nominations | Spain, Germany, Italy, Portugal


alive and available. 2CD rip also, but dubbed on Hungarian. One Russian rip. All on page 1 of Google search results.

If you find impossible to get one, I can put it as Plus in one of the future TV packs, but I don't know exactly when and is that rip ugly or bad or not."
