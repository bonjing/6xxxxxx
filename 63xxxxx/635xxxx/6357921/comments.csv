The idea that fear is some thing or demon inside us is so preposterous that kills my suspension of belief, which is a must in these movies, when it's carried too far... Over the years I've found that I still remember with a warm feeling those classics with obsolete special effects like the 50s The Thing, War of the worlds,  The Blob, etc. but sometimes they went too far, those I don't watch anymore. It's like those chicks you dated then, out of sheer necessity you dated some ugly ones, but today we remember and cherish the memory of only the pretty ones, don't we?"
,brytewhite,2011-05-01T01:23Z,"@sarsapil - Draw a line... Who holds the pencil? Don't you have a demon inside you? I know I have. And there are no ""ugly chicks"", only short-sighted men. One million thanks,bitstreeem, for your continued hard work. It is much appreciated.  "
,dgjr1959,2011-05-01T01:44Z,Thank you for the classics.
[T],bitstreeem,2011-05-01T01:51Z,"Well, we get what we get from the past.  There is no re-writing of these movies from back then.  Some were better than others, but I have to cherish them all as they were such an affect on my upbringing.

When growing up I had many many 'demons'.  Some I have excised, some I have not, but the battle continues.  

I think it's important to remember every girl we dated whether they were 'pretty' or not.  Like brytewhite said, there really aren't any ugly women except perhaps the augmented ones we see today in films and TV.  Some of those truly are scary...=)  

As always, thank you for your frank and refreshing comments.

Enjoy!"
,sarsapil,2011-05-01T02:47Z,"Sorry fellas, I don't be a spoilsport... No, I don't have any demons, it's just I've always been mad about science and reason and when some of those movies take too great liberties (like those atomic brains that at the end try unsuccessfully TO BLOW OUT the stick of dynamite that's going to destroy them, blow, OK, but with what?), well, the scientist in me protests very loud. And it's good to be polite to the gargoyles we dated out of despair, but if I remember I'd puke, sorry again. One of them I remember we only went out AT NIGHT, that's how embarrassed I was... 
But they provided much needed relief, that's why out of gratitude I walked them back home, I didn't leave them perched on the nearest tree. 
:-)"
[T],bitstreeem,2011-05-01T05:53Z,"No worries sarsapil, you are certainly NOT a spoilsport.  I welcome your comments just like any others. I agree with some and others I don't.
      It's one of the many things I enjoy I about freedom.
Take care and enjoy!!"
