A small but very useful tool, especially after ripping/copying entire websites and you need to find the 

images inside all the chaos.

Works only with .JPG files.

I desided to make this small application after using the HTTrack Website Copier that copied images in 

their respective folders. Which meant that I had to go through alot of folders and copy each one .... one 

folder at a time.


Requirements: .NET 3.5
