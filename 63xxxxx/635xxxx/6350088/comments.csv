,xBSAACHRIS434x,2011-04-28T17:34Z,"@drcat123 The show is supposed to have a shock factor or be ""bizarre"" as you say. It is for adults and rated M for a reason. Go watch some My Little Pony if you cant stomach South Park hahaha!

Thanks for the up EZTV you guys always got top notch shit!!"
,bugijs,2011-04-28T17:45Z,You know you can watch this without downloading on the southpark website http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s15e01-humancentipad
,tyronick,2011-04-28T19:10Z,Sometimes its not if you have the stomach for it...rather how amusing it relly is. As someone already mentioned a bizzare episode and in my opinion hardly funny...
