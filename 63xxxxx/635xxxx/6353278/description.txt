some sites don't post the link so i separated each letter by a space just type it in too your location bar and hit enter
I saved the guide on a free web site and so you know i don't make a cent off it or anything it was just handy at the time. just scroll each picture from top to bottom for how i setup but feel free to test what works for you...
4)if you have had previous versions installed usually when installing a new version you should use CleanVso first and remove older versions completely as some noticed problems after upgrades.
