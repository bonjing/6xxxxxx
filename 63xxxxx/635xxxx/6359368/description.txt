Welcome to a world where military geeks, mechanics, and eccentric millionaires are living a dream with blowtorches, industrial lathes and hi-tech electronics, restoring four notable battle tanks from wars past. Each episode follows one tank's story: the rebuild; the innovations that made each machine great, and the engineering flaws that proved fatal. Unique serial numbers lead us to re-trace each tank's forged-in-war history: discovering where it was made, the battles it fought and the often tragic end of its fighting career. Once the hard work is over, we see the machines sputter and roar to life.
