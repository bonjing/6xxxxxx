Hello there internet, my name is Sherrod DeGrippo. I like to cause grief
for people online if they should cross me. But between you and me, I'm
really bad at receiving harassment myself. SSSHH!!

I used to run a site called Encyclopedia Dramatica. Maybe you heard of it?
It was a place where nightmares of the innocent came true, and societal
failures gathered together to die like that faggot Sean Carasov. (Hopefully
Weev will follow suit). Hmm.. I wonder how the other inmates are liking his
jokes about niggers and rape. Lulz.

When I'm not studying to re-attempt my CISSP exams I am running ./nessus
against the clueless dolts that employ me. How they came to the conclusion
that I was the person for the job is beyond me.. and much like my vagina
the logic behind it is out of my reach. Oh, sorry didn't I mention I gave
meaning to the term "lulz cow"?

Nonetheless, I am an expert in the field of information security and should
not be taken lightly. No one can hack me because I don't use the default 
port for SSH. Unfortunately I like to re-use passwords, so I guess that's
something I should make into a new years resolution, or something. Here
are some of my favourites:

24366DeG, blur6666, niggers, omgwtf, hammeratv, kthanks, salla, moo1234
a138c5, 8087fb, omgwtf, atlgoth23, unfunf, d7bd7b, *TbgvsWz, p-p-pokerface


.. Among others.


I'm kind of a big deal around here. With an inflated ego and a body to match,
the only person who could ever love me thinks his sole purpose in life is to
protect Sarah ConnorBut Linda Hamilton
is much prettier than me, so I guess I'll just settle for sweet talking weev
into making other people's lives miserable to help raise my self esteem. No one
gets the better of Girlvinyl!


As my many resumes state, I am highly skilled in the area of intrusion detection.
Although there was this one time (more like months) where people were accessing
my computer without my knowledge and laughing at me fumbling about with bash.


Despite what the people I've tormented will tell you I'm actually quite the sweetie.
I'm loving, caring, and a friend to all. I'm also painfully naive and unfamiliar with
the phrase "what goes around comes around". I don't believe in dropping "docs" on anyone
so to prove it here is my SSN as collateral: 257-59-3529. If I should go against my word
then you are free to do as you wish.

But forget all that drama. ED is a thing of the past. So without further adieu, I welcome you to
my new site ohinternet.com! This time I'll do it right - promise. 

With love,

Sherrod E. DeGrippo
