Jeremy Irons stars in this gripping tale about four foreign workers who escape to London for work, only to find that they may never return home. Lured by the notion of earning a month\'s wages in only a week, Kudaj, Wolski, Nowak and Banaszak arrive in London, hoping to bring the wealth back to their Polish homeland. But in their absence, Poland is swept by political turmoil - the military have imposed martial law, outlawed the unions and put the free world on alert. Stranded in a land they do not belong to, the men struggle to return to the people they love, before it\'s too late.

Jerzy Skolimowski\'s \"Moonlighting\" is an outstanding achievement in many respects. Not only does it contain one of the most fulfilling performances that has ever been put to the screen, but it also serves as a political allegory, a smartly-told drama, and a unique exercise in creating suspense.
