Guitarist and vocalist Big Jack Johnson was born in Lambert, Mississippi, in 1940. He was inspired to play music by his father, Ellis Johnson, a fiddler, banjoist and guitarist who played blues, breakdowns, and country music. Johnson, a lifelong fan of country music, began playing guitar with his father at age thirteen, and later mastered the fiddle and mandolin. By the time he was eighteen, Johnson was playing electric guitar and soon learned to play with a slide from local guitarist Ernest Roy, Sr. The barrel-chested guitarist initially received his nickname "Big Jack" from a relative who wanted to distinguish him from a cousin named "Little Jack."
Johnson has received multiple Handy Award nominations for his guitar-playing and songwriting and in 2003 won the Handy for best acoustic album for his The Barbecue Sessions CD. In the mid-2000s Johnson began cutting back considerably on his touring schedule, which had extended to over 300 dates annually, and spending more time at his home in Clarksdale.
