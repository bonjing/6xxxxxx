The most disturbed horror series of all time returns with an all-new six-issue series written by David (Crossed: Family Values) Lapham! Meet Mr. Lorre â€“a single, horribly selfish, man trying to survive on his own. A man who will leave behind every shred of his humanity to survive the Crossed. Now join us as Lapham and artist Raulo (Capt Swing) Caceres descend into a story about the worst aspects of human behavior, a tale of unspeakable evils, violent assaults on both mind and body, and of longing for death and the sweet release it will bring. Imagine, for a moment, the worst crimes against humanity. Picture the cruelest affronts to decency. Conjure your darkest nightmaresâ€¦ and then realize it could all be so much worse. When civilization crumbles in one terrifying moment; when people are gleefully breaking into unthinkable acts of violence all around you; when everyone you love has died screaming in agony: What do you do? There is no help. There is no hope. There is no escape. There are only the Crossed.
