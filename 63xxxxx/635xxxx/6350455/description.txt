The Nightfly is one of the greatest albums of all time. It brings the jazz/blues sound to the forefront, and takes it a step further. It also is a concept album: the songs represent certain fantasies that might of been entertained by a young man growing up in the remote suburbs of a northeastern city during the late fifties and early sixties. And the sound is an homage to those years. The great musicians and Fagen's unique vocals and crooning style create a timeless work that is as fresh today as it was the day it was recorded.
