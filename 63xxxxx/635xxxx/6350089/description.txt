Louis C.K.: Shameless

2007 TV-MA

In this HBO special, Emmy-winning comedian and writer Louis C.K. performs his controversial brand of no-holds-barred stand-up comedy in front of an exuberant audience at the Henry Fonda Theater in Los Angeles. Touching on everything from the pros and cons of weight gain and taking bumper stickers personally to deceiving your spouse and losing your privacy, the caustic comedian provides tons of sidesplitting -- and often X-rated -- moments.
