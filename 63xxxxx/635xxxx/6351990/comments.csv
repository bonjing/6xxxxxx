People like me and the cuemakers on Cuenation (Which i was a part of before breaking out and making torrents instead) put down alot of effort in this and i just can't see why you steal other peoples work if you dont even write the source of your files at all .. 

And yes we're all pirates in this business but some code of honor would i like to think it could be .. 

Just write source!"
,Burgz123,2011-04-28T23:33Z,"Just wondering, is there anywhere to download the original tracks to ASOT..like, better quality without the commentating etc over it? :/ I'm a bit picky, would be amazing thooo "
[T],-inspiron-,2011-04-28T23:58Z,"@Indextrance: for god's sake, mind your own business, i don't even have to explain to you, everyone does what he wants, sometimes i split them and sometimes i get the cues from cuenation, already told everyone where and how i get the cues, plus anyone can get the timing and just put it in a txt file to have the cue ready, what stealing are you talking about !! isn't uploading albums considered as stealing !! so we all do the same, so please mate save the "" people like me"" i don't have anything to hide and already told everyone how i split them, and i think the honor is serving the trance nation in every way, and as we are a community we all together and don't have the right to talk like that
cheers mate
