                The Frog and the Pussycat.
                Period comedy drama and prequel to Only Fools and
                Horses, following the exploits of the Trotter family
                in sixties Peckham. Joan and Fred plan to sail away
                to a wonderful new life together, but Fred's arrest
                for murder casts something of a cloud over their
                dreams. Meanwhile, Del has fallen in lust again, and
                the lucky girl's parents throw an engagement party
                they will never forget.
