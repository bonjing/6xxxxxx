Okay, I'll throw some details on this one. We have a collection here of Yu-Gi-Oh! starting with the first series anime, subbed by TV Nihon and including the first series movie, continuing through the American-released anime series (an English dub DVD rip until season 3, after which they are modified TV rips to maintain a consistent aspect ratio) and including the 3 special uncut release DVD rips (in Dual Audio with DVD subs). This DOES NOT include the movie "Pyramid of Light", but if there is really that much demand for it, I will acquire a copy and v2 this release.

To clarify fully, these are the best possible quality you can find. Unlike other torrents on this site, every one of the 224 series 2 episodes is English dubbed. Season 0 is Japanese with hardsubs. All 9 uncut episodes are here in dual audio with all subtitle tracks intact.

If you don't know Yu-Gi-Oh! by now, I really don't feel like explaining it.
