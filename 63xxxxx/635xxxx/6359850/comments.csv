,kreem,2011-05-05T22:41Z,Well when you consider the real kernel from www.r4i-sdhc.com is around 20mb - how is your upload 310mb?

,kreem,2011-05-12T20:43Z,@lass_90 - At a glance it appears to be just the system files - it's clearly mislabelled and he should have mentioned the inclusion of the saves and roms. And my knowledge reaches infinitely further than yours...
