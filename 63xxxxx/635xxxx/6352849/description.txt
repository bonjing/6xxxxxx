Young Widows - In And Out Of Youth And Lightness (2011)



Though singer Steve Sindoni amicably parted ways with Louisville, KY's Breather Resist in December 2005, the remaining members -- guitarist Evan Patterson (formerly of Black Cross, the National Acrobat, and various other Louisville bands), bassist Nick Thieneman, and drummer Geoff Paton -- weren't ready yet to throw in the towel. They pressed on and chose not to replace Sindoni, with Patterson picking up the main vocal duties. The trio entered the studio the following April with intentions to record Breather Resist's second album. But when the resulting music was not quite the metallic hardcore aggression of their past, the guys consequently decided to retire Breather Resist and its accompanying discography altogether, forging ahead instead with a new identity, sound, and name: Young Widows.
