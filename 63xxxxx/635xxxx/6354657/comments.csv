,Animeman1000,2011-06-19T07:39Z,Hey you're missing the rest of Series 5. There are 8 episodes. You only have 5
,ravager123,2011-06-20T21:07Z,Get them from somewhere else i aint got the time to add them in unfortunately. 
,tylerdean1379,2011-07-20T21:15Z,"What of the quality? This is only 14.51 GBs? Whats the video size/bitrate and audio bitrate? Thats something you should tell us in the info above. Its probably like bad quality if its such a small torrent for 5 seasons, couldnt be anything close to 480p. I use a 32"" 1080p flatscreen so anything less than 480p would look like shit. Im one of those annoying lossless people. Fuck bad quality! (I'm certainly not bashing anyone here I am just curious of the quality of each video and so forth.) Thanks,

,bdawg603,2011-07-21T11:31Z,"mate, if you weren't retarded and just opened the torrent file you would see that each episode is around 350mb, the usual size of a 45min tv show."
,ravager123,2011-07-25T02:14Z,"exactly bdawg, if he wasnt a complete retard he would know this."
,j3rom3,2011-07-26T14:13Z,Nice downloading 5.8mt/s thanks all
,littlegunboy42,2011-09-12T04:36Z,ok im not that retard but did you say 350p? sry im not the best with techno talk.
,ravager123,2011-09-12T21:26Z,"Its very watchable on a 32 inch screen, thats all i will say."
,GIlover,2012-01-01T15:28Z,ew 20kb per seconds so bad
