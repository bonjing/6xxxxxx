[720p][DoctorAdventures.com / BraZZers.com] Roberta Gemma (Midnight Fuxpress )



On October 6, 1969, Don Perrier is caught attempting to fornicate with one of the Prime Minister of Zurkistan`s many wives. He is told he will be released if he co-operates with the authorities, yet Don decides to run for it. After a lengthy chase, Don is caught, beat senseless and thrown into prison for life. The prison environment is inhospitable in every sense, with a sadistic prison guard Sarkazu, who relishes the mental and physical torture he inflicts on the prisoners. Told to trust no one, Don does befriend the local nurse, Roberta. Don`s only way out of prison now is through the `Midnight Fuxpress`.
