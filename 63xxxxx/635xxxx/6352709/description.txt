"Jerry's Painting"

Jerry's (Jim O'Heir) contribution to Leslie's 
community art show causes a stir. Ben (Adam Scott) 
moves in with April (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy (Chris 
Pratt) and attempts to teach them how to be adults. 
Meanwhile, Leslie (Amy Poehler) is frustrated by 
Chris (Rob Lowe) and his interoffice dating rules.

Enjoy :)
