,SomeScottishGuy,2011-04-30T21:06Z,I watched it on BBC 1 when it was being broadcast. Best episode of Doctor Who I've ever seen. I'm downloading it now because I much prefer it in HD and if this is anything like your upload last week of the first episode in the series then the audio and video qaulity will be amazing.
