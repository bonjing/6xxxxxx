Bardot was an Australian female pop group which formed in 1999 on the Australian reality television series of Popstars. Aired in early 2000, the program was a fresh concept to audiences, attracting high ratings and much attention in the media.

This exposure resulted in the instant success of their debut single "Poison" and debut album Bardot, both entering the Australian and New Zealand charts at number 1 and highly in parts of Asia.

In 2001, Bardot released their second album Play it Like That, featuring the Top 5 ARIA singles "ASAP" and "I Need Somebody", with greater creative control and this resulted in many strong reviews.

Despite making the decision to part ways in 2002, Bardot remains the most successful act of all four Australian Popstars seasons.
