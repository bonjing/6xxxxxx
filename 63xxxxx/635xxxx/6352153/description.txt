These four albums were from DJ Tinman & HhH one of the most stellar combos I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve heard in the 90\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s breakbeat scence. HhH (Hien Huu Huynh) died on the way to a show April 19th 2003, not from an OD or plane crash, but from an asthma attack of all things. Life is too short.

All songs were ripped at 192k I did my best title the tracks, and even created album artwork to go with it. Hope you enjoy, please share.
