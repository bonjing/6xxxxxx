,MrUberMex,2011-05-02T06:42Z,"Dude you can't use x264 in an .avi container which means it has to be mp4 or mkv. x264 is superior to xvid , google it. it's 2011 not 1999 too in case you forgot ;-) . thanks heaps scene4all and rudos much appreciated.

Remember TNA fans try and do what you can to support TNA financially , if you can't bring yourself to pay for a PPV go to shoptna.com and get a t-shirt or hat or something. Support TNA!!"
