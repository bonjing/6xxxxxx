This is a fairly comprehensive collection of Anti-Aliasing comparison screenshots.

This covers these games and hardware forced AA on an ATI HD 5470:


Fallout: New Vegas
Half-Life 2 (this one was the hardest, read the .txt file for the why)
Half-Life 2 w/ Cinematic Mod
Half-Life: Episode 2 w/ Cinematic Mod
Half-Life: Source w/ HD pack
Rainbow Six: Vegas 2
Star Wars: Empire At War

I hope this is informative to somebody...

*** 4x MSAA, 4x SSAA, and all AA filter modes (box, narrow-tent, wide-tent, edge-detect) were used on all games except Fallout: New Vegas, Half-Life 2, & Rainbow Six: Vegas 2. ***



If you'd like to have a specific game compared in this way, feel free to post a comment requesting it, and I'll see what I can do.
