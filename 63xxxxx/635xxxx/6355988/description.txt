Maze Runner

When Thomas wakes up in the lift, the only thing he can remember is his first name. His memory is blank. But heâ€™s not alone. When the liftâ€™s doors open, Thomas finds himself surrounded by kids who welcome him to the Gladeâ€”a large, open expanse surrounded by stone walls.

Just like Thomas, the Gladers donâ€™t know why or how they got to the Glade. All they know is that every morning the stone doors to the maze that surrounds them have opened. Every night theyâ€™ve closed tight. And every 30 days a new boy has been delivered in the lift.

Thomas was expected. But the next day, a girl is sent upâ€”the first girl to ever arrive in the Glade. And more surprising yet is the message she delivers.

Thomas might be more important than he could ever guess. If only he could unlock the dark secrets buried within his mind.


Scorch Trials

This dystopian novel begins where The Maze Runner (Delacorte, 2009) ends. Thomas and the rest of the group\'s escape from the Maze and the horrifying creatures called Grievers has proven to be short-lived because WICKED, the group behind it all, has another trial in store for them. Sun flares have destroyed most of the Earth, and a virus called the Flare has ravaged its population. Infected people turn into zombies called Cranks that attack and eat one other. The kids are told that they have the Flare but if they succeed in surviving the second trial, they will be cured. With few supplies, they must travel across 100 miles of hot and scorched land within two weeks to reach a safe house to receive the cure. When Teresa, Thomas\'s best friend and the only girl in the group, disappears, and he loses the ability to communicate telepathically with her, he and the other guys determine to find her. As they trek across the barren desert encountering crazed Cranks, the teens\' loyalty to one another and the group is tested. The fast-paced narrative and survival-of-the-fittest scenario is reminiscent of Suzanne Collins\'s The Hunger Games (Scholastic, 2008). Although these characters aren\'t quite as compelling and their made-up slang takes a little getting used to, each character\'s personality is distinct. The unresolved ending will leave readers impatiently waiting for the conclusion to the trilogy.
