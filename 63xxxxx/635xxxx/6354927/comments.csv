Commented from the rlslog.net:

17. Can someone post the link to the exe file only? This isnât working. It is missing one file and is not able to complete extraction.

20. Why is that half of every release TE puts out is always missing one of the rar files? Amateurs.

22. LOL bad release lost r38 LOL why you zipit anyway Change rules

,mp_morgan82,2011-05-03T01:21Z,"I couldn't get it to work. Shouldn't there be a "".rar"" file? All i got was .r01 thru .r09"
,valerz,2011-05-26T22:06Z,"A Trojan came within the setup. Didn't happen with the other episodes. Removed it. Still, as far as I can confirm, the game runs xD"
,snipey101,2011-06-28T02:34Z,"@rlf-rls

,cartman19987,2011-07-26T00:34Z,I stopped playing midway through episode 3. Got too boring. I think I'll give it another go.
,turq_hex,2012-04-22T18:35Z,Can anybody confirm what valerz said?
,turq_hex,2012-04-22T19:42Z,I'm with morgan... I don't know what to unrar? I've just got .r01-.r09 and SFV file?
