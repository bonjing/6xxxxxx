This is an updated version of "Ronnies Soul - Collection" uploads from away back as there were a lot of problems with them at the time.

I've cleaned them up a bit, added some extra tracks and got rid of a load of duplicates (not all though).

The files are slightly smaller than the originals, so the Download times should be quicker, this is all I can do to speed up the process as I've a really slow connection due to location and equipment etc.

My personal collection of Soul tracks that I have accumulated over the years. 

Mainly from the sixties and seventies.

Some, I've owned, some I've borrowed but most of them I've stolen .

There are thousands more out there to collect so this Data Base will be updated from time to time.

I love the music, and it doesn't matter to me if it's on Vinyl, Tape, MP3, CD, or DVD,  so long as it's Good Old Soul .

The only category in this Collection, apart from the alphabetical sequence, is that of "Soul".

I don't distinguish between Northern, Motown, Latin, R&B etc., that's up to you.

If I like it it goes in, if I don't like it, it still goes in, but I don't play it ! 

Enjoy.
