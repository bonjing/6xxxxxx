,chasalin,2011-06-01T10:05Z,"Having some trouble with the activation.

Somehow it gets deactivated after some time.

Had to 'reactivate' it twice in about 20 days

Easy, but a bit anoying. Copied the activenexus to my harddrive now, so I hope it will stay active now.

And yes, I did leave the disc in for even more than the suggested 2 minutes.

Other than that, still a great torrent!"
