This song is a charity work being distributed for only $0.99 USD to support the overturning of wrongful convictions of three teenage boys (the ""West Memphis Three"") who were convicted of murder based on their black clothing, dyed hair (only one kid) and the fact that they wore heavy metal t-shirts and read Stephen King novels. The only confession was coerced and recanted immediately, and the supposed motive was for ""Satanic ritual"". New evidence has come to light and these guys have been in prison for 18 years, one of them sentenced to -DEATH-. It's only $0.99, people, and it's not even going to Disturbed. More info is available on the site at http://www.disturbed1.com/splash/"
,Zarachael,2011-05-06T02:15Z,"Think about it. This could have been ANY of you who listen to Disturbed. Even me. Don't pirate this, please, if you have any moral fiber at all, it's just wrong."
,sanitysnoop,2011-05-06T10:24Z,"I completely agree, this download should be removed from TPB, or at least only downloaded by those who have contributed to the charity fund."
,Zarachael,2011-05-09T01:55Z,"Or, at the very least... If you aren't willing to contribute even that little to saving those few innocent lives of kindred souls.. :\

Wait until they're done collecting? -.- Is that too much to ask? Then you have a perfectly valid excuse to freely distribute."
[V],zaq2qaz,2011-05-12T18:30Z,"if the new evidence was clear enough, people wouldn't have to raise money to fight this case. let's not forget the 3 have been tried and convicted of the brutal killing of Stevie, Christopher, Michael

let's not forget the dead memphis 3"
,Vil3shad0w,2011-05-15T12:22Z,"This money goes to the DNA testing and other legal costs.... comon this is a charity, your pretty much giving $0.99 USD for charity and because of that good deed you get the song ;) Think about it!
DONT PIRATE THIS SONG! If you want to hear it go to YouTube or something, then buy it!"
,Zarachael,2011-05-17T04:52Z,"Defending your torrent with a fail argument is.. Well, fail. They were CONVICTED WITHOUT EVIDENCE. Are you -DAFT-? There was no material evidence, no motive, NOTHING. Please don't respond to intelligence with stupidity. :\

By the way: One of the kids' stepfathers IS suspected to have killed them, and there's been DNA evidence supporting the suspicion. Read first, then talk man. Please."
,DownAddict,2011-05-18T15:42Z,"yeah yeah,, just let us download in peace "
,ATF_Killa,2011-05-21T14:20Z,bought it 1st off the website.... only bcoz it is Disturbed tho =D
,Zarachael,2011-05-24T03:55Z,"All of you who download this..... -.- You're pathetic. Almost as pathetic as the people who convicted them in the first place, people who argue like the creator of this torrent. ""Might I remind you they were convicted""... Sounds like the thinking of the jurors at the trial: ""Well, the police said they did it, so it MUST have been them."" Think for yourselves. Think about how you feel when you're done an injustice. Now think about that injustice costing you half your goddamn life. Try putting yourself in their shoes."
,Zarachael,2011-05-24T03:57Z,"And for the record: This had 54 seeders when I found it, and dropped to 18 at one point, is only at 36 now. So... Seems like what I wanted to do worked, on one level or another. Leaves me almost satisfied. (The other torrent I did this to died entirely.)"
,ZDSKRF,2011-07-04T13:38Z,This song is fucking terrible anyway. Disturbed sucked since Believe... This is no different.
,Zarachael,2011-10-23T22:42Z,"Never said it was good. XD At any rate, they've been released now, so download away."
