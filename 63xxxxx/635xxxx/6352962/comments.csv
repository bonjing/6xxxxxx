Do you have any other Catalan files that you will add in the future? I'm desperate for resources but they're difficult to come by. "

Request for 2 more French books.

1) ""Alter ego"" from Hachette publications. I've only completed A1. Text + Audio + supplementaries (ecoute) would be welcome with both hands.

2) 501 French Verbs from Barrons, by Christopher Kendris."
,GalitShpichter,2011-10-05T20:35Z,"Well, I've just updated the French learning pack, it does have the alter ago series (volumes 1-4) and much more (14.26 GB VS the 2.1 GB pack here), including several books on French verbs (not the Barron's one, though) and now it's the best time to download it, there are plenty of seeders, it's only 3 days old after all.
Ignore the Polish description, it's a private joke, and download folder 00.book list first.
