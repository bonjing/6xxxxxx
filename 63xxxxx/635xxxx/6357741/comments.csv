,damage78,2011-05-02T03:29Z,drlouies-What do you think RF means?
,drlouies,2011-05-02T10:05Z,"@damage78 

i know what it mean 


but some ppl think if the game working on pal & ntsc/u  it will be free region

and they forget the NTSC/J region ,many game on the web like that espicaly the games on demand (GOD ) ,and they r wrong

cause there is no need to write pal + FR ,if its a free region indeed

do u got me now ??

thats why i need anyone to confirm the result from abgx360 thats it Free region ,not pal and ntsc.

,rrstyxx,2011-05-02T12:29Z,can anyone comment on how good the game is dont want to waste a disk and download time for a crap game
,bushek,2011-05-02T15:27Z,"this game is a crap, horrible gameplay and graphic, don't waste your disc, or waste on your own responsibility "
,aomorphed,2011-05-02T22:47Z,i agree with some of bushek comments the game is a assassins creed wannabe but thankyou to chris-askel who gave us the oppertunity to play the game big up to you
,john4551,2011-05-03T21:44Z,can anybody get l.a noire or lego pirates of the carribean yet or the new resident evil for xbox yet plz
,littledoo,2011-05-05T22:02Z,honestly people this game is terrible!!! dont bother downloading. its so shit you will turn it off before the end of the first level. assasins creed wannabe bullshit. basic graphics! basic button bash gameplay. non-fluid jerky glitchy movement of character. overall very poor. thanks for the upload tho unfortunately its just one epic FAIL!!!
,TheHFH,2011-05-25T23:28Z,"Guys before u update ur xbox 360 dash check http://www.ixtreme.net/ to see if it's safe or not, well bad luck for every one who did update u guys need to reflash ur 360s..."
,miro011,2011-06-13T03:02Z,"RF means Region Free , but I have another question : Is there any dofference between the SSes of games if they are all SSv2 , just different fiels with different numbers and everything green when i scan with abgx"
