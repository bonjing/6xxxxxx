Dialtone [2009][DVDRip]

A mysterious phone. A missing lawyer. An abandoned warehouse.

They all help tell a story about Greg Pleasant, a Seattle lawyer whoâ€™s held back from leading the dynamic life Christ wants him to live because he fears manâ€™s opinion of him more than Godâ€™s.

After Greg loses the control he believes he has over his life, an odd client tells him about an old phone that calls back into the past. When faced with the ultimate wake up call, how will he answer? How will you?

"A powerful modern parable with a sci-fi twist that will make you rethink your entire concept of evangelism." Tim Way, Family Christian Stores
