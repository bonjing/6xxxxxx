[V],BLACKTROY,2011-05-02T04:03Z,JOHNEFP - VIRUS??? WHERE? DON'T BE AN ALARMIST. YOU MUST BE OUT OF YOUR MIND
,nothappyjan,2011-05-10T23:57Z,"@BLACKTROY - No JOHNEFP is not out of his mind. I get the same issue. Crack dll contains VirTool:Win32/Obfuscator.XZ. This is used to create viruses, worms or other malware."
[T],EuroGroover,2011-05-13T12:29Z,Thank you! Works perfect.
,registered1,2011-05-18T00:41Z,"False positives are often given on cracked dll files.  The Release is fine, nothing to worry about.  However, the program itself still has some issues with respect to wtv files but nonetheless this is the most usable beta thus far. So well done to BLACKTROY."
