    Two lovable West Virginian hillbillies, are headed to their              
    "fixer-upper" vacation cabin to drink some beer, do some fishin',        
    and have a good time. But when they run into a group of preppy           
    college kids who assume from their looks that they must be in-bred,      
    chainsaw wielding killers, Tucker & Dale's vacation takes                
    a bloody & hilarious turn for the worse.
