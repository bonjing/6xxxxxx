[V],thethingy,2011-04-30T16:02Z,"Global777, it's on initial seeding due to limited bandwidth, you'll have it in a few hours so dont panic. "
,zaiko2000,2011-04-30T18:22Z,"thnx a lot !
but I wonder if this version is so much different from the one before."
[V],thethingy,2011-04-30T18:32Z,"zaiko2000, as far as I can tell it's just has the updates integrated but I might be wrong. "
,Global777,2011-04-30T18:47Z,"thingy...  I'm not sure where the ""don't panic"" came from.  I was just asking a question.  

Thank you for all of your efforts..."
[V],thethingy,2011-04-30T19:15Z,"Global777, I plagiarized it from someone :) "
,Beepbox,2011-05-01T10:30Z,"""Don't panic!"" came from me, I use to work in this studio where my client would always say to ""panic first and try to figure it out later""
Just installed CS5.0, came back to say thanks and CS5.5 is here.
Thanks again"

,glocask,2012-03-20T09:05Z,"The installer keeps prompting for cd before initializing the installation process. Have tried both normal and trial install and with/without admin rights.
Any suggestions?"
,cactjunk,2012-04-08T20:26Z,"Here's what I did if anyone's still struggling:

1a Disconnect your internet connection.
1b. Check that hidden files are shown in windows explorer - (google how to do this), otherwise you will get stuck.
2. Navigate to C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/
3. Copy and paste the ""hosts"" file to your desktop and rename it ""hostsbackup"" (Just in case you fuck anything up, so you can restore your last working configuration)
4. Right click the original ""hosts"" file in the ""etc"" folder - click ""edit with notepad""
5. Copy and paste all the 127.0.0.1 lines into the original ""hosts"" file you just opened below ""#	::1             localhost"" like so: 

Before

#	::1             localhost

After

#	::1             localhost
127.0.0.1 3dns.adobe.com 3dns-1.adobe.com 3dns-2.adobe.com 3dns-3.adobe.com 3dns-4.adobe.com activate.adobe.com activate-sea.adobe.com activate-sjc0.adobe.com activate.wip.adobe.com 
127.0.0.1 activate.wip1.adobe.com activate.wip2.adobe.com activate.wip3.adobe.com activate.wip4.adobe.com adobe-dns.adobe.com adobe-dns-1.adobe.com adobe-dns-2.adobe.com adobe-dns-3.adobe.com adobe-dns-4.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 adobeereg.com practivate.adobe practivate.adobe.com practivate.adobe.newoa practivate.adobe.ntp practivate.adobe.ipp ereg.adobe.com ereg.wip.adobe.com ereg.wip1.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 ereg.wip2.adobe.com ereg.wip3.adobe.com ereg.wip4.adobe.com hl2rcv.adobe.com wip.adobe.com wip1.adobe.com wip2.adobe.com wip3.adobe.com wip4.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 www.adobeereg.com wwis-dubc1-vip60.adobe.com www.wip.adobe.com www.wip1.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 www.wip2.adobe.com www.wip3.adobe.com www.wip4.adobe.com wwis-dubc1-vip60.adobe.com crl.verisign.net CRL.VERISIGN.NET ood.opsource.net

IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU GET THIS RIGHT - EACH 127.0.0.1 SHOULD GO ON ITS OWN FULL LINE. IF YOU ARE UNSURE LOCATE THE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS LOCATED IN THE DOWNLOAD TO ENSURE THAT YOUR SYNTAX IS CORRECT. 
NB you may have another non-adobe 127.0.0.1 line, either from using another crk or somethign else below ""#	::1             localhost"". If this is the case just paste the adobe 127's below the existing non-adobes

6. Save and close the ""hosts"" file.
7. Type ""cmd"" without the parentheses in run (press ""Win+r"" to get to run) and type ipconfig /flushdns
8. Re-open the original ""hosts"" file again to ensure that the changes still remain.
9. Restart your computer, disconnect internet, check original ""hosts"" file again.
10. Navigate to the crk folder, ADOBE INDESIGN cs5.5/SOFTWARE and open ""Set-up.exe""
11. Next through it until you come across the serial screen - now open ""INSTALLING INSTRUCTIONS.txt"" in the crk folder and copy and paste in any of the serials - first one worked great. 
12. Next etc until its completely installed, open the app to make sure you can use it, then you can reconnect your IC, enjoy.

Thanks thethingy for a great UL

,Ainsy777,2012-04-18T20:35Z,"Hi can someone please help me! I followed all the instructions on how to set this up, and it seems I have done everything correctly (the hosts file is fine etc). But it won't let me open the software anymore, as everytime I opened it, it asked for a new serial code. Now I have used all the serial codes and it won't open!! Have tried deleting everything and then tried the whole process again but it still says your trial has expired!! Please help!"
,cactjunk,2012-04-19T00:39Z,"@Ainsy Check and double-check your hosts, each 127.0. line must go on its own full, single line (each line must not overlap onto two lines or it will be invalid). You can also try the following:

If you are using Windows 7, go to control panel, windows firewall, advanced settings, outbound rules  , new rule...

Create a 'program' rule, next, browse ""this program path"" to C:/Program Files/Adobe/Adobe Indesign CS5.5/InDesign.exe and rename it something. 

If none of the above approaches work make sure you do a completely clean scrub using this http://thepiratebay.org/search/Adobe%20clean%20install%20%5Bthethingy%5D/0/99/300 and start again from scratch. Good luck"

,siank,2012-05-28T10:02Z,"Hi, first like to say thanks for this!

Though having a tiny problem! Ran through your instructions with VPN etc (I don't have one) and the Firefox is as you said - so NOTHING has changed with regards to the host file.  I did however go into the connections and typed in the 127 etc - still nothing changed on the host file.

I've followed every single step and typed in the 127etc on a separate line copied everything back that was underneath the hash - I haven't ran the software yet as apart from adding the line above NOTHING has changed...will it work - tried sending you a private message when I look in sent box it says N/A not sent - don't understand that!

Please can someone just tell me if there is anything else I need to type/delete to the host before I launch?

Thanks...a novice!"
