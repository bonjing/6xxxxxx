[W4F PRESENTS]: 
Q.and.A.AU.2011.04.28.Is.The.Royal.Romance.Over.WS.PDTV.XviD-W4F

[AIR DATE] 2011/04/28
[RELEASE DATE]: 2011/04/29

Genre: Documentary and talk show/Reality


Description:
"Q&A puts punters, pollies and pundits together in the studio to 
thrash out the hot issues of the week. It's about democracy in action
- on Q&A the audience gets to ask the questions."

In this special royal wedding edition of Q&A Tony Jones first 
introduces a documentary that explores Australian's unique 
relationship to Queen Elizabeth, this is then followed by a special 
edition of Q&A live to discuss the relevancy of Australia's role in the 
Commonwealth in the 21st century.

The Q&A studio audience for this episode:
MONARCHIST  25%
REPUBLICAN  27%
UNDECIDED  23%
UNKNOWN  25% 

We considered releasing the 1 hour documentary seperately, but the 
two hours do meld together, so here is the full 2 hour broadcast in high
bitrate. The documentary does not appear to be available on the abc website
or iview.
