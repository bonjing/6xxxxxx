,Bunnnny,2011-04-30T06:09Z,Every week /cry 
[T],hipolipolopigus,2011-04-30T11:16Z,"My thoughts exactly! But it is better than FMAB, nothing there until JULY D:

When this runs out, I'll find something else that I like. Or you guys can make requests! "
,Bunnnny,2011-04-30T13:45Z,Ugh The Voice overs are not as good as i thought they would be i think they subbed versions give more life to the characters
