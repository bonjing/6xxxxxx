Homicide: Life on the Street is an American police procedural series chronicling the work of a fictional version of the Baltimore Homicide Unit. It ran for seven seasons (122 episodes) on NBC from 1993 to 1999, and was succeeded by a TV movie, which also acted as the de-facto series finale. The series was originally based on David Simon\'s book Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets. Many of the characters and stories used throughout the show were based on events depicted in the book, which was also used for Simon\'s own series, The Wire on HBO.

Homicide featured an ensemble cast, with starring roles given to Richard Belzer, Daniel Baldwin and Ned Beatty. However, Andre Braugher (as Frank Pembleton) emerged as the series\' breakout star. The show won Television Critic\'s Awards for outstanding drama in 1996, 1997, and 1998. It also became the first drama ever to win three Peabody Awards for best drama in 1993, 1995, and 1997.

Chris Tergesen became music coordinator during the second season, and more music is featured than in the previous episodes as a result.

A commercial soundtrack CD was never release, but this torrent has surfaced, and I share it with you. In contains several tracks from the soundtrack of the show and some audio clips from episodes.  Homicide Life on the Streets was ground breaking in many areas, story acting and editing.  The inclusion of popular rock music as part of its episodes was another area where the show broke new ground.
