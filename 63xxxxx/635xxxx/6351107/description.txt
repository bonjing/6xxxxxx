When Walt Disney created Mickey Mouse for 1928's revolutionary cartoon "Steamboat Willie," the little guy was an anarchic delight. Audiences embraced the mouse like no cartoon character before him. Overnight Mickey Mouse Clubs sprung up all over the world. But the success of Mickey came at a price. Because audiences cherished Mickey so much, the Disney animators were forced to tone down his wild behavior. Mickey became less "funny" and needed a band of crazy brothers to pick up the slack. One such sidekick was Goofy, perhaps the wildest and wackiest character in the entire Disney pantheon. Walt Disney Treasures: The Complete Goofy a limited edition DVD set hosted by film historian Leonard Maltin, turns the spotlight on Mickey's favorite chum, thanks to Disney Home Entertainment.
