Everybody seems to be jumping with no hesitation on new movies while ignoring so many fantastic older movies.
Well, to be honest I'm fed up with new movies, especially those filled with explosions and shootings & non-sense- boring - -Hollywood-humor--dozens of cliches etc.
I wish more people would apreciate more the oldies. 
....and I keep saying that at least Nordic subs should be added by more uploaders (if available).
Most HD-rips have only English subs. Cheers"

,babis200sx,2011-07-20T15:00Z,"Thank you for sharing this great movie!
I have only question: I can't seem to fins the proper encoding of the subs, so to view them properly with VLC.
I am talking about Greek subs, and I've tried UTF-8, Greek (ISO-8859-7), Greek (Windows-1253). Each time I get characters that don't make sense.
English subs work great though.
Any ideas?
Thanks again for sharing this. "

Demux the sub, open it and save as ansi then close it. 
Open it again with notepad++ (right click on the sub)

chose the greek windows, encode to utf then save.
You're done."
