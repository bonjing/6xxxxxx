I remember for the longest time there was only 1 torrent out there with a collection of only 20-30 episodes of CCP.  This is fucking incredible man.......

1 problem: Not many peeps are gonna be able to seed 76gb for very long periods of time... ISP bandwidth limits cost ppl big bucks and stretched assholes in many places today. I myself only have 120gb with my cable package. If I d/l and seed a 1:1 ratio, I'm already busting my limit for the month by 33gb with this single torrent. =\  Not fucking cool.

Uploading in smaller portions might be a better idea to help keep all of this great stuff alive...
Major thanks for this either way!"
