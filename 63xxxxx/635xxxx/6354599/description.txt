This is a new re-issue of the older Comedy Central Presents Stand-Up Pack.
Contains the entire 15 seasons aired until now, specials and roasts.
The only two videos missing are:

311-  Victoria Jackson  
The N.Y. Friars Club Roast Of Rob Reiner

If anyone has these please let me know.
Also the Hugh Hefner Roast it's poor quality, so if anyone has it better, please upload it.
Some of the episodes were replaced with higher quality ones, compared to the first 2 packs.

This will be seeded every day from 6PM to 1 AM(+2 GMT) untill at least 5 users get it full.
Even if sometimes you won't see a seed, don't worry, I will complete it!
