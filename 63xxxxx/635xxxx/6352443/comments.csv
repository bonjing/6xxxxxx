I downloaded the majority off there, this was just to not have to download them all together.
This is for the .00002 versions which is worldwide.

Your game likely has a slightly different version, check the very end, where 1 is english, 2 is wordwide, 3 is asia, 4 is japan, and 17 is digital copy. (well they roughly follow those numbers)
Check which version you have and then look for the correct ones in there, it's pretty complete."
