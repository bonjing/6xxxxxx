,irvine_k,2011-05-02T11:54Z,"FTL3, can you comment on this:
http://i20.fastpic.ru/big/2011/0502/90/a1078dbb4df1e9f9a592e9fc0cd13490.png ?
that update 3 .exe was inside the seeded archive. KAV, DrWeb and Avira think the same way."
,FTL3,2011-05-02T17:55Z,"go do a scan at virustotal.com if you think its crapware. KAV, DRweb and Avira are like the shittiest antivirus ever. "
,BrahxOTB,2011-05-02T19:55Z,This is absolutely fake. SKIDROW hasn't even uploaded Update 2. This uploader is a well known impostor. Enough said.
,FTL3,2011-05-03T02:07Z,"MY GOD YOU ARE SUCH AN IDIOT. UPDATE 3 HAS BEEN OUT FOR ALMOST A WEEK:

http://www.rlslog.net/portal-2-update-3-skidrow/
NFO:
http://nfo.rlslog.net/view/20421
I just wish you monitor this torrent so you can come and see my comment and realize how STUPID you are."
,FTL3,2011-05-03T14:18Z,"OMG there IS no main website for release groups, retard. You think there is reloaded or skidrow or razor main website? you think they're stupid? THEY'RE CALLED SCENE GROUPS BECAUSE THEY RELEASE IT TO THE SCENE, NOT TO THEIR OWN FUCKING WEBSITE.

NICE ON BRAHXOTB CREATING ANOTHER ACCOUNT TO FLAME ME? HAVE U EVEN TRIED DOWNLOADING IT AND RUNNING IT? HAVE U GOOGLED PORTAL 2 SKIDROW UPDATE 3? 

AND YOU DON'T BELIEVE RLSLOG.NET AND THE 73 COMMENTS SAYING ITS REAL? 

Get a life, loser."
,blouponie,2011-05-03T21:52Z,Game ran perfectly after the update. Fixed the random crashes that i've been having. completed the game without any more problems/crashes.
,tbs2008wme,2011-05-04T02:16Z,"the file patch.exe contain virus 
don't download this shit"
,d0XX0b,2011-05-04T09:13Z,"I don't know about this torrent, but this: http://www.rlslog.net/portal-2-update-3-skidrow/ is legit and does work."
,d0XX0b,2011-05-04T09:21Z,"I have to say, the original file (available from the link FTL3 and I provided) is 46.1 MB, while this is 50.22 MB. That is suspicious. I will download this torrent and see if it is legit."
,d0XX0b,2011-05-04T09:26Z,"This torrent contains a certain file called PATCH.exe and the instructions to run it. No such file is included in the original SKIDROW rar. Also, the size of the file Portal.2.Update.3.exe (included both here and in the original) is different in this and the original (42.0 MB in original, 42.3 MB in this). That is too suspicious for me, so I will upload a clean version."
,Furious1964,2011-05-04T19:30Z,Game crashes at title screen. How can this be fixed? I updated it with the previous updates to and they worked. Somethings borked.
,BrahxOTB,2011-05-06T23:54Z,"Wut? Me? Another account? Sorry, didn't about that. I haven't been acessing Pirate Bay for a couple of days. I mean...

Well, I see a lot of complaints... That's bad for a legit torrent.

,nark0z,2011-05-07T00:31Z,"Works fine for me, but that 'PATCH.EXE' didn't do anything?"

To play coop over lan or Hamachi:

1) Enter the game one both computers and Enable Developer Console in the options.

2) Hit "" ` "" to open the console. Then type in... sv_lan 1.

3) The client should connect first as it disconnects if the host is in the empty game for a few seconds, but the client can wait forever.
Client: Type into the console... connect replacing the with an ip.
For example... connect 192.168.1.3

4) Host then selects the map by entering into their own console... map mp_coop_ replacing the with the name of the map of choice listed below.
For example... map mp_coop_start

5) The host will connect and the client will see the blue bar fill, finally entering the game.

,bravo2011,2011-06-21T14:16Z,"This looks like it's the official VALVE release retail patch ,plus SKIDROW crack update. This  Fixed crashing problems on chapter 9 (game crashed near the start of chapter 9 and WOULD NOT RUN past that) , also there were no crashes at the end of the game, game played final credits then back to main menu. This update does erase all your saves but you are able to start a new game on any chapter so you dont really lose anything. "
