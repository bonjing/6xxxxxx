,victor.brazil.qwerty,2011-05-04T23:06Z,@LigGeoge Many thanks for you uploads man! I have all it all. Seems to me that you are the only guy out there uploading quality 3d content on a regular basis. Thanks again and congrats!!!
[V],r3dcat,2011-05-07T14:36Z,"@LigGeorge Fantastic work at getting 3D titles uploaded ... very much appreciated ... they are not easy to find online ... a suggestion I would make is that it would make sense for you to add ""Half-SBS"" to your titles for clarity and also for better indexing in searches ;)"
[V],r3dcat,2011-05-07T14:41Z,"""3D Half-SBS"" is a more standard tag than ""Bluray 3D rip"" :)"
,shelbylab,2011-05-11T03:22Z,Thank you so much for all the 3D quality movies. You are the best. 
,LigGeorge,2011-05-22T13:53Z,r3dcat: Thanks for the suggestion.
,Netties,2011-05-27T18:05Z,You're the only one that have this sort of 3D Thank You!
,Titapia,2011-06-20T01:56Z,"Hey! I have a question, wich program do you recommend to watch this 3D movies?

PD. Thanks for the upload."
,Sagiy20,2011-06-30T16:27Z,Does this work with nVidia's stereo vision and their player?
,snoopy9,2011-07-09T04:41Z,"Movie works on my PC with nvidia 3dvision, using freeware sView (which has several better features than the nvidia video viewer). The nvidia viewer currently won't play .mkv files.

Issues:

1. At first I thought the video had be squashed horizontally, making it taller than wide; then I noticed that the aspect ratio is adjustable in sView.

2. This file plays back at an inconsitant rate. Every few seconds it appears to go at a faster speed for a quarter second. Especially noticeable in faster movement scenes. It is clearly noticeable and takes some getting used to. I opened the file in VLC player, where it plays as two images side-by-side, and the same speed effect was clearly there as well, so I believe it is this file that's the issue, assuming the glitch was not present in the original bluray. The film is still very enjoyable, and visually beautiful, but certainly not perfect."
,DoseOfEpic,2011-07-10T01:15Z,"For the 3D movies on here, do you need the new 3D TV's, or just glasses. I have an HD 1080 P TV. Can someone please answer? I made an account just for this question, thanks."
,LigGeorge,2011-07-11T00:26Z,You need a 3D tv and 3d glasses or a 3d monitor for a pc and nvidia's 3d kit.
,xdanovx,2011-08-27T01:48Z,"@LigGeorge, I'm having trouble playing your 3D movies. I have a 2011 panasonic p50st30. I've downloaded your films but they keep stuttering badly and have no sound on some. I have an seagate external hdd connected to my computer via USB. Once the download finishes I simply disconnect the hdd and connect to my tv via USB and it pops up, but like I said it stutters badly for me. The 3D portion shows very well but since the movies stutters it's just not viewable. Know what I mean? Although the IMAX 3D movies r3dcat has uploaded all work great for me. Why is this?? Help please. Thank you for you time. -Danny "
,kev4321,2011-11-28T00:52Z,same problem! wont play on my samsung blu ray player and 3d tv. sound stutters but video seems perfect?! it more like glitches. If you try and fast forward it kicks the movie out. how do we fix this?!
,kev4321,2011-11-28T00:55Z,plays perfect on the computer. This isnt the first SBS ive tried thats done this! Hubble 3D shows up as invalid format. the last airbender glitches the sound exactly the same way as alice in wonderland did.
