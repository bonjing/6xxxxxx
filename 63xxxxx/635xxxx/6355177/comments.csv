,Silvak,2011-04-30T10:22Z,Green Arrow 1-11 could fit in there somewhere.
,green_lanter,2011-04-30T12:06Z,"There is no reading order as many tie ins were not so much about flowing into BD as much as spotlighting one of the key resurrected character. Quite a few regulars like Titans, Flash and JLA books had running storylines with half marked as BD tie ins without that arc completing. I have compiled a list of all that WAS marked and also NOT marked but would still make it a complete list. The Green lantern books don't evend eal with anything from BD except taking off to a new tangent after ending Blackest Night. Here's a 'take' in terms of books released so far:

Brightest day 00 - 24
Birds of Prey v2 01 - 06
Green Arrow v5 01 - 10
Green Lantern - Emerald Warriors 01 - 06
Green Lantern Corps v2 47 - 55
Green Lantern v4 53 - 62
Justice Society of America 40 - 42
Justice League of America 44 - 48
Justice League Generation Lost 01 - 22
Flash v5 01 - 07
Titans - Villains for Hire Special 01
Titans 24 - 34"
,green_lanter,2011-04-30T12:17Z,"TBH, the green Lantern series does nothing to take ahead the actual BD story [which was all that trouble just to bring Swamp Thing back] in one of the lamest story endings ever. The Birds of Prey and Titans books don't fit in either. In fact only the Gree Arrow series had any relationship in any way with the damn book."
,green_lanter,2011-04-30T12:36Z,"Also add to the list:
Brightest Day - The Atom 01.

I missed it earlier."
,cartman19987,2011-04-30T18:42Z,Thanks for this! I'll seed indefinitely.
,ridge87701,2011-04-30T18:45Z,"Thanks for the details guys.

@Green_Lanter: Ya mate, I know, it's a major pain in the butt to get the reading order right.
I was thinking of making a giga torrent with everything even remotely related to BD in it.

I didn't even like it that much, it's just for archival purposes to be honest..."
,ridge87701,2011-04-30T20:24Z,"Sorry guys, didn't notice it earlier but Brightest Day Tie-In - 05 - Justice League - Generation Lost 01.cbz might give an error: Invalid Archive.

Once it's downloaded, change the extension to cbr and then it'll open."
,bhadrra,2011-05-01T23:23Z,hey! i'm new to piratebay but not sure how to download lol!any cute guys willing to add me on yahoo messenger my screename is HyacinthRettig976 
,j_corvin,2011-05-02T19:18Z,what are u using to view at theres cuz nothings working for me
,cartman19987,2011-05-02T23:49Z,"@j_corvin, download a .cbr reader like ComicRack. I use it and it works great."
,kbowk2,2011-05-19T04:38Z,Swamp thing is back?  Fuck yeah I love swamp thing.  Him Deadman and Constantine used to rock on in the 80s and usually hung around together.  Swamp thing has had 2 movies to his name.  Not many DC Heroes have that. Although they are really bad.  
,kbowk2,2011-05-24T06:07Z,"Torrent only has Flash issues 1 & 2.  Storyline of Brightest Day is From 1 - 7 plus ""The Flash Secret Files & Origins"" 2010.  

The Flash Brightest Day (with all the issues just mentioned) is now out as a Graphic Novel called ""Brightest Day: The Flash - The Dastardly Death of the Rogues.""  I found all the issues on PB via mirrormaster accept issues 4 & 5.  4 I couldn't find anywhere and have asked mirrormaster about it.  #5 is within this torrent (twice actually) http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5858510/DCP.and.Minutemen.Week.of.22-09-10 

I just bought the book anywaz because I'm getting keen on the flash after reading final crisis and blackest night I have started becoming interested in him. Also, the road to flashpoint begins in issues 9-12.  (8 is all about the reverse flash.)

By the way, if ur keen on flashpoint then read Time Masters - Vanishing Point which corresponds with The Return of Bruce Wayne.  It seems to be all connected, but don't quote me on that."
,perks2010,2011-06-15T20:34Z,"@bhadrra , you do realise this is comic book torrent? and you're really hoping to find a cute guy here? i assume your american, cos the irony is totally lost on you:)"
