This is Mike Oldfield's Moonlight Shadow, a great old classic that some one has added scenes from Doctor who (Mainly from series 1 with rose) which really tend to match up with what the song is singing about at that time.

This is a brilliant bit of splicing that I cannot imagine any Doctor Who fan not appreciating it.


I DID NOT PUT IT TOGETHER:-  All credit goes to who ever did.  I got it off UTUBE and took out the audio as it was a little crappy and put a 24bit cd rip of the song in their and made the video wide screen 720 x 480 and ran a couple of filters to improve it a bit.

I suspect b4 it was uploaded it was probably better quality video and sound.

Now the sound is cd quality and the video quite good considering I got it off UTUBE a year ago.

If anyone knows where I can get the original,  LEAVE ME A MESSAGE PLEASE.

Anyway enjoy even even if you are not a Dr Who fan
