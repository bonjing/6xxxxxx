This CD includes some of the music that guitarist Fred Frith composed for various films after he relocated to Germany in the early '90s. Since Eye to Ear is essentially a compilation, there's not necessarily any relationship between adjoining tracks. As good film music should, the tracks flow while nothing particularly sticks with you. To enjoy Eye to Ear, familiarity with Fred Frith is not as relevant as is an affinity for film music.
