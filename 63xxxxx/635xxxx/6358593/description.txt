
While touring through '71, Fred would be diagnosed with the cancer that would ultimately claim him in July of the following year. Finding renown at the tail end of his life, Fred became one of the blues' few success stories, leaving us some of the finest blues ever recorded. 

This April, 1971 bootleg finds Fred at the Court Coffee House, doing what he did best: entrancing a crowd with a guitar on his knee, coming on with blues so deep BP couldn't dig a well that far down.
