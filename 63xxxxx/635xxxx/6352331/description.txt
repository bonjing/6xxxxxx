WASSSSUP PB?!?!?!?!

This torrent serves 3 purposes:

1. I've been torrenting for a long time now and usually don't seed and have not uploaded anything.  This torrent is a thank you to everyone in the torrent community, so THANK YOU!

2.  I love a lot of music that came out of the 90's!  So here is my 90's playlist from me to you!  Also if you think I'm missing anything based on artists I like, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!!

3.  I wanted to make the most badass and organized 90's playlist on the net...pretty sure I did.  Please dl and seed guys!!! I put some serious time into this!
The folders are organized as follows: GENRES>ARTISTS>SONGS, so you can quickly go through and view exactly what you're about to download.

I encourage everyone to download the whole torrent though!!!

I also have every band listed in the tag, so if you found this playlist from searching one artist you can easily just dl the one artist you searched for because each artist has its own file. 

There will be more music torrents uploaded by "THE HAND THAT FEEDS" in the future, just have to come up w/ another playlist theme, so stay tuned ;)  




Seed on brothas,
