after download, i needed to repair with divfix for a bad frame but it might have been my download.

Processing file : Mindhunters.2004.XviD.AC3-WAF.avi
Four CC is : XVID
Error detected at byte: 540016856

if the movie doesn't fast-forward or reverse properly - you'll need to repair with divfix."

in other words the index is fucked and it wont play correctly."
