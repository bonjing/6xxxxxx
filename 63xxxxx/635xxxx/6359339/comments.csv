,scrotty,2011-05-12T01:29Z,"Problem, I got this after I installed it. I had downloaded your Photoshop torrent only recently so I the instructions were already done, I did however get this error after the installation finished.

""Installation Status

*Error Sign* There were problems with your installation

Installed:

some required components may have failed to install. This could impact functionality of installed applications.""

What should I do? I have some common sense but I don't want to do anything before unless I know it's correct."

,JennyCyp,2011-05-12T16:17Z,"I have also had the same error message on installing, but am going to give it a go anyway.  I just want to say a huge thank you to thethingy for all the Adobe dls, I would not be able to keep busy without you. THANK YOU."
,MadTogger,2011-05-12T18:53Z,"Hi,

the install went fine right until the end where it told me that Flash was not installed due to Adobe Core Family on a number of files.

It said the payload was x64 and as my machine is 32bit, they would not install.

I have not had any form of Flash on this hard drive before as I am using a new fresh install of XP.

Any ideas about this.

,zeveljones,2011-05-13T22:22Z,"Hi thethingy... thanks for the torrent!
I see its only an exe file. Do I need any sort of keygen, serial, or activation app? Or do I just run the exe file and that's it?"
,macune88,2011-05-14T13:48Z,ummm... i have a qeustion. whenever i start adobe professional it asks me for a serial and if i dont use a new one it wont work. so eventually i run out of serials. is thier anything i can do to make it stop asking for serials
,jjp671,2011-05-28T21:53Z,"For those that were receiving an error saying there were problems with the installation which said: ""some required components may have failed to install. This could impact functionality of installed applications.""

It's not a problem with thethingy's torrent it's a glitch with flash itself, adobe published a quick article here about it: http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/902/cpsid_90243.html

And thnx to thethingy for uploading this sweet release =)"

,rverne10,2011-07-21T01:34Z,"I am trying to get the download  and install to move beyond an install for the demo version. 
I was ok on following the instructions in the Hosts Setup until I arrived at this point
7. So now your hosts should be renamed to hostsbackup and now you need to simply copy the hosts from this folder and paste it to the ETC folder. 
  I only had

127.0.0.1       localhost
::1             localhost
at the end of the host folder. 

 The ETC folder is not a receptacle for anything. So are the instructions stating to save a new host  folder with just those two lines? If the instructions are followed literally there is nothing I can do because again, the etc folder is a receptacle for only other files and nothing in the way of text can be pasted into it. 
Can the instructions please be made clear as to exactly what should be done? "
,geomorphosis,2011-08-17T17:53Z,"WTF would people up the whole installer file that they downloaded from adobe.com? Anyone can go to adobe, dl the prog, change host file then put in a good serial. "

BTW i didnt had to change host files. JUST install while disconnected to internet.  aster which replace dll file...read the NOTEs by the uploader.  "
,Helixdisc,2011-08-23T07:57Z,If you change the DL file meaning replace it it works for awhile but once you fgo to adobe site then it will ask for serial. Just change the host file and then you never have to hassle with it..:)

,siod09,2011-12-17T15:33Z,"@ candy474 - this is probably because you're trying to install it with a DVD (I had this issue with another Adobe software). If this is the case, copy all the files/folders (which are on your DVD) somewhere on your hard disc, and run the setup.exe (in Adobe Flash Professional CS5.5\SOFTWARE - folder), good luck! BTW, thank you mr. Thingy, all went well, Ive even manged to download/install the updates :)"
