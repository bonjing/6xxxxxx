The exciting version is the shorter 104 minute version that doesn't include the boring interviews. Can someone please upload a 1080p of the exciting version instead of this boring one?"
,bighimey,2011-05-24T05:55Z,"Agreed, can someone PLEASE upload a 720P/1080P BluRay rip of the 104min theatrical release.  It's a far superior piece of film.  I saw it at the cinemas twice and would like to show a friend before I give him the longer one."
,andrehudds,2011-06-03T04:50Z,"As a brazilian and fan of Ayrton Senna I like this one...I confess there is too much interviews but in the end it is quite good! I still watch formule 1 but it has not been the same since ages, too much tecnology spoiled the competition between drivers. "
,babybluetits24,2011-06-23T04:45Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1424432/ is 106mins why are some saying this is a longer version with more talking...ive not heard of any other version, please explain"
