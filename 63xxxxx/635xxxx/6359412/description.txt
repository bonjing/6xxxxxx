promo video:

Dutch group George Baker Selection was a bit of a one-hit wonder (in the US anyway), the title track of this album reaching number 21 on the US Billboard charts in 1970. It received new attention in 1992 when Quentin Tarantino used it in the opening of his movie "Reservoir Dogs". The album has a very Euro-pop feel, some of it sounding a little Beatles-esque. Hard to find record, and nice sonics too.
