Why do you think its Fake.He have upload several torrents if i see.All most seeded.I don't think he risk his trusted profile and upload a Fake movie."
,namorax2,2011-04-30T17:05Z,"not saying this one is fake, but when you see trusted accts with questionable torrents, and check their history and see all games, or software, theres a very high possibility of it being a hacked account. Software people get trojan'd more often than anyone."
,reygeko,2011-04-30T23:23Z,"Please, don't write fake if you're not pretty sure.

You have a web address on the title. If you go to the address you see that the movie is not fake.

Thanks."
,jawsmtv,2011-05-01T05:03Z,it is important to specify whether audio in Latin or Castilian Spanish... por favor especificar si es audio latino o en castellano please :)
,shingabo,2011-05-01T05:48Z,Latin or Castilian Spanish????????
,welhung,2011-05-01T10:49Z,"First of all....spanish is spanish doesnt matter if your from Puerto Rico or Honuduras its the SAME language...period!
Latin is a totally different language altogether and has ZERO spanish content. Italian is closer to spanish than Latin...so for those of you who want to sound intelligent end up sound pretty foolish when you lack the education to know the difference!"
,dashingguyof2k,2011-05-01T13:41Z,"somebody upload a good print even if its a cam but good and in english please, its an awesome movie"

No one is confusing Latin with Spanish. Latin Spanish and Castilian Spanish are different dialects. If you speak one, you can understand the other fairly well. However, they do not share complete vocabularies and some words in one exist as different words in another, creating some difficulties in cross-dialect communication.

Latin Spanish is spoken mostly in Latin America (notice the word Latin used in both) and Castilian Spanish is spoken largely in Northern and Central Spain."
,reygeko,2011-05-01T23:03Z,"Spoken language in the movie is spanish as known in Spain.

Spanish is spoken in the whole country of Spain."
,charlik,2011-05-01T23:31Z,"despite the fact that seeder counts mean nothing in regards to fakes, that trusted accounts can be hacked etc, this is actually real. 

Unfortunately it is also less than quality. And it is NOT A SCREENER. It is a cam straight up. "
,welhung,2011-05-02T00:22Z,sure it is
,fredonski,2011-05-24T14:43Z,"So I guess the one who tried to sound smart and ended up as a fool was @welhung, urashimakt is completely correct. Latin spanish or Latino Spanish for people like welhung is to castilian Spanish, what American English is to British English, Would you download a movie dubbed in British English if there was American English Dubbing available? I think not."
