,wigsoutwar,2011-05-09T23:54Z,"Awesome. Got a letter sent to me from my ISP today, stating that I was sharing this file -_-
This is the first time it has ever happened to me. Gave all the details about this torrent lol."
,Erich505,2011-05-15T07:00Z,"OK, here's the deal: First off, I'm lucky to get this movie for free, and I enjoyed the hell out of it. There are some audio problems. It's not movie quality, it's more like watching the movie on your television set as far as audio. Your going to love the video quality. Again, I didn't pay a dime for this which is why I donate to pirate Bay as often as I can, but if your looking for movie quality audio? Keep looking."
