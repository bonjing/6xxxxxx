Award-winning singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Laurie Berkner's Best of the Laurie Berkner Band collection features 20 tracks culled from her first five albums, including "Fast and Slow (The Rabbit and the Turtle)," "We Are the Dinosaurs," "Moon Moon Moon," and "Bumblebee (Buzz Buzz)." Bouncy, fun, and infectious, her signature brand of jovial children's folk-pop is well represented here, making it the perfect compilation for snow days, birthday parties, and long car trips.
