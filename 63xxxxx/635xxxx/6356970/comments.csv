,TyMod,2011-04-30T16:04Z,"Forget to mention the instructions:

1. Goto C:\Windows\System 32

2. Hopefully you took control of the folder and MF.dll because I didn't upload the registry file to do it.

3. Delete the cracked MF.dll (If you opened Windows Media Player or Internet Explorer you might have to restart your computer because it will tell you MF.dll is being used.)

4. Copy and Paste the MF.dll from the torrent into the System 32 folder.

5. Open Windows Media Player and see if everything works.  (Don't get mad at me if you are missing codecs and nothing will play though.)

Sorry for all the trouble.  Should had done more test!

,TyMod,2011-05-01T04:51Z,"This will not activate it if the games not cracked.  Search on here for a halo 2 crack, download it, and place it in the Halo 2 folder and try that."
,readytorok,2012-01-10T13:04Z,"Bro, I only get 5Gb/mo. THAT'S IT! And I'm grateful. I DL your HALO 2 Direct Play for Vista/Win 7. That more than half my allotment.  It ain't working for me.  It won't even start. I have Win 7 32-bit.  I followed the instructions to ""T"" ( although, I did it in Sandboxie  -  the Reg thing had me a little shook). It keeps crashing. Will this new Crack help?
I don't want to Delete it and I ain't DLing another one. I won't give up, but I need some assistance, bro.  After I do everything and I hit the HALO 2, I get the ""... has stopped working ... CLOSE THE PROGRAM ..."" window. Should I DL the latest GFWL app? Along with this new torrent?  Your help is appreciated. Wish I could play the game!"
,TyMod,2012-01-13T03:03Z,"You can try this.  Worked for others and fixed the issues on my old 32 bit computer.  I hope when you downloaded the original Halo 2 torrent you read the comments (I posted that Razors crack wouldn't work on 32 bit computers because the source for the MF.dll was from a Vista 64 bit computer.)

So yes, this should work just find.  And the reg file works fine.  If you don't trust it just open it in notepad and look at what it does. That simple.  I made the reg file so I know its clean."
,apuurboo,2012-06-08T21:29Z,"for this link http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6187403

dear tymod, thanks for that torrent. but I can't run it. I desperately need your cordial help.

1. when I tried to copy and replace MF.dll it is shown to me that ""you need permission to perform this action"". I pressed the option try again but it keeps showing me."
,apuurboo,2012-06-08T21:31Z,"2. you said, ""If it tells you the file is open somewhere you will need to rename
the ORIGINAL MF.dll to something random and move it to your
desktop. After doing so paste the crack!""

my question is paste the crack where? desktop? only the entire crack folder?

As I haven't been able to copy and replace the MF.dll file to system32 so will this instruction be applicable to me?"
,apuurboo,2012-06-08T21:33Z,"3. ""Install Game for Windows Live"" does it mean to install the XLiveRedist1.0.6027? I already installed it along with vcredit which are available in the OPEN THIS FIRST! folder. But now what? nothing happens. Where is the game? What I need to do next? What is it that I don't understand? How and from where I can start the game?

Waiting anxiously for your reply. Your help will be highly appreciated. I'm dying to play the game. btw I'm using win7."
