Try out the GOM player. It's compact, plays all sorts of things and you don't have to worry about wmv files asking about a codec if they happen to be infected.

VLC Media player is my recommendation for all file formats I use...on a side note all wmv files checked for infections/spyware =)

,godlullaby,2011-05-02T17:36Z,And I do have sound when I use quicktime... Ok.
,sildel,2011-05-03T18:01Z,no sound
,chizelout,2011-05-10T04:55Z,No sound. Sound is very low and noisy with QuickTime and MPC.
,Frufitteguri,2011-06-05T03:30Z,BAD SOUND and sometimes NO SOUND AT ALL!! AVOID THIS. A WASTE OF TIME TO DOWNLOAD!
,godlullaby,2011-06-12T19:56Z,I wouldn't say a waste of download. No. Just use quicktime instead of vlc to get sound (lesser quality).
