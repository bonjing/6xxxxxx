By the way what sound has this file? DTS or MP4 ? Because The green hornet english track has Cinavia protection and it may cause trouble on some devices .I believe dts core keeps the protection.Anyway every Sony bluray has Cinavia from now on and it's the only protection that hasn't broken.

What's next?"
,JOEY3D,2011-05-05T18:08Z,"LigGeorge the sound is dts there is no probs with this movie as i watch them first to make sure then i upload i convert iso to mkv so i can stream them to my 50"" samsung 3dtv i cant do with disks and this works for me. dont no what devices will have trouble with this as i dont have a bluray player just my tv hope this helps you and saw 3d should be next it should have been before this one but had issues with it but i will never be beaten only delayed"

,JOEY3D,2011-05-06T23:49Z,Jthug what you say works with samsung tvs as i have done this with mine so i dont see why it should not as long as the tv reads the mkv format and the only language in this movie is english hope this helps
[V],r3dcat,2011-05-07T14:54Z,"@JOEY3D Great work on uploading 3D content ... much appreciated ... a suggestion I would make is adding the ""3D HALF-SBS"" tag to your titles for clarity and to help in search indexing ;) cheers"
,PhantomWhoWalks,2011-05-16T23:07Z,"Which languages ââare spoken and what are the subtitles?

Tks"
,PhantomWhoWalks,2011-05-17T20:06Z,Why not up BD Full format?
,gibbscarl,2011-07-18T12:32Z,"Hi Lig, can you please tell me why some mkv files you have uploaded cannot be changed to mp4 playable by playstation. i.e How to train your dragon 3d large file 15 gb, small file converts though.
Many thanks for your uploads though.
Its not just your files, problems with other mkv files.
Great if you can help.

Carl"
,gibbscarl,2011-07-18T12:34Z,"Tron converted fine, but only if i dont merge mp4 audio file. will this film be watchable."
