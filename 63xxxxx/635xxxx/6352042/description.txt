Love? is the upcoming seventh studio album by American recording artist and actress Jennifer Lopez. Conceived during the pregnancy of her twins Emme and Max, Love? is Lopez's most personal album to date, taking inspiration from the birth of her twins and her own experiences with love. Recording for the album began in 2009, with an original release date for the project set for January 2010 to coincide with Lopez's latest film The Back-up Plan. However following the lack of success with lead single "Louboutins", Lopez and Sony Music Entertainment decided to end their ten year partnership leaving the fate of Love? in uncertainty. In 2010, Lopez signed a new record deal with Island Def Jam, which will see the release of Love? on April 29, 2011.
