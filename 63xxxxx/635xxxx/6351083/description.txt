The Outsiders were the band from Amsterdam, from 1965 till 1968
They had a rolling stones status not in the least because of their leadsinger Wally Tax, drums:Leendert Busch, lead guitar Ronnie Splinter, rhythm guitat Tom Krabbendam, and Bass Appie Rammers.
Hope you still can hear the exitment their performances back in the sixties aroused.
