,carnaval93,2011-06-11T14:19Z,"Nr.1 is Mrs not Mr...second...I knew what I was talking about at the time,because I went directly to his website to find other uploads from him directly and not just ben 10,and at that time it was showing on his website that he was having some computer issues.I you don't believe me go on the website yourself!Don't assume I don't know what I'm talking about until you get all the facts!!"
