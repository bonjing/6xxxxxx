,skateboarder2898,2011-05-01T03:32Z,"Stupid quistion, how to install this, i have tried all the railworks directery's, bu after clicking import addon it says no addon found? help ? i really like this route and would appreciate some help..."
,vipin91,2011-05-01T06:46Z,hey olivergeorget the route is not working wheneva i load the scenario its shows some error saying the route is blocked......plzz help
,d0dg3,2011-05-01T07:59Z,"@skateboarder2898 when you unzip the exe file and start the install make sure you install it into you railworks folder c program files steam steamapps common railworks and it will show in the menu when you load the game

@vipin91 after you install it be best to do a verify check . close the program and open main steam window, click library, right click railworks select properties,local files then verify integrity of game cache , should sort out your problem"
,tima9x,2011-05-01T11:09Z,"Thanks for the upload, this is the best sim and a great ad on, runs rings around the Tranz debacle.. Thanks to d0dg3 with the good advice, works great. Will seed for as long as I can. "
,kab80,2011-05-01T11:38Z,"Nice upload! It installed with no problems. However, the scenarios won't work due to missing vehicle consists?"
,DC8910,2011-05-01T11:46Z,"This has the class 450? In the game says ""not found"". :S"
,furrets,2011-05-01T13:54Z,expansion and update seem to be working just fine. thanks so much.! =D
,d0dg3,2011-05-01T18:45Z,"downloaded and installed, but there is no class 450 so it cant be used, now I have a 46 mile stretch of track that is no use . Where is the Class 450 that is supposed to be with it ?"
,olivergeorget,2011-05-01T21:55Z,@d0dg3 Try clearing your blueprints cache and/or reinstalling. It all works fine for me though so I don't really know how to help.
,d0dg3,2011-05-02T03:32Z,"done all that already, I do that everytime I add somethign new even if it is only a scenario , I think the problem is because its an exe file , unless everything is included in it ( I doubt the trains are with that one for some reason ) then it won't work , could you possibbly try and load the folders that include the trainset in a different torrent and see if that works? "
,mrwardy,2011-05-02T11:50Z,@d0dg3 yeah I've got the same problem. Haven't found a solution yet.
,duncan9860,2011-05-02T13:17Z,there is no signals on the route.
,Joker100,2011-05-02T23:58Z,"For those who can't get the class 450, I had the same problem, I think it's because you need to patch the game before installing this, this is what I did and the route works perfectly.

I don't think this torrent has the patch it's just the route."
,chalkie1991,2011-05-03T12:51Z,"Patch to what? every time i've tried to install an upgrade it's corrupted the process exe, meaning a complete uninstall/reinstall is necessary. i've followed the instruction but had no luck."
,mellowmaster,2011-05-03T23:28Z,This patch Fucked up my game Asshole 
,mellowmaster,2011-05-04T17:28Z,"Sorry that was disrespectful, was drunk and angry last night . Apologies "
,olivergeorget,2011-05-04T19:51Z,this patch could screw up your game if you do not have the previous version. sorry i didnt make that clear
,mellowmaster,2011-05-04T21:32Z,"Ok I tried the patch on version 114.0 and that made it crash also.

Which version were you referring to?"
,olivergeorget,2011-05-05T19:24Z,the last version i believe was 114.1b which i updated from fine
,bawbag881,2011-05-06T23:51Z,I have the original non-pirated version of Railworks through steam so it updates itself. I installed this pack and it seems that the class 450 is not included ? Everytime I start a scenario it says cannot load rail vehicle meaning the class 450. It also seems that there is no track in game. Am I doing somthing wrong ? Whats the crack ? 
,monsmeg,2011-05-07T12:54Z,Thanks for the download - I installed the patch first (from 116.5 which seemed to work OK) then the add-on.  Both worked perfectly thanks.
,mellowmaster,2011-05-09T16:16Z,@bawbag881 Im in exactly the same boat and I have no idea how to fix it. 
,chalkie1991,2011-05-14T13:11Z,"finally got this to work, you need to install the patch, then edit the properties of the railworks and railworksproc.exe to compatibility with xp2 and run as administrator, then you need to run the portsmouth direct line install as administrator. hopefully it should work for you."
,mellowmaster,2011-05-14T16:56Z,"No, my settings were like that anyway. I have the no pirated version. We have a different issue. Mine being none of the class 450 will load when starting a scenario"
,mellowmaster,2011-06-23T01:07Z,Yep! This update totally FUCKS UP both my licenced and pirated version of this game. What cocksucker put this fuckin thing together...
,mellowmaster,2011-06-23T01:16Z,"""RailWorksProc2.exe has stopped working""

This update has fucked up the original game. I now have to uninstall/reinstall"
,Mr_Oiler,2011-07-02T17:56Z,"The update worked great for me, but some of the scenario's don't work and the ones that work haven't got any signals. Any idea what i can do about this?"
,airband1,2011-07-07T14:24Z,"@ Mellowmaster, I had the same error message but I right clicked on my mouse went into properties and then compatibility then ran in Windows XP service pack 2 mode and it works fine now."
,Thootjeajax,2011-07-26T13:27Z,"@Mr. Oiler download the UK Led Signals 01 by RSC for the signals. If scenarios don't work try restarting.

@airband1 thanks very much, works fine for me now :)"
,Ant29,2011-08-07T18:13Z,"It works!
Go to your railworks folder, right click on the railworksproc2.exe
click properties.
click on compatibility.
tick the box ""run the program in compatibility mode for""
then click the drop down box and choose 
""WindowsXP (Service Pack 2)""
then go to the folder where you have downloaded this torrent.
Open the .RAR file and theres a installer in there.
Install the route.
Once its done, install the update.
This should work! Its everything I did!"
,dukeyluker,2011-08-08T19:00Z,Does not let me install the update... 'Access is denied'. Why dont you upload the class 450 add on so it would save everybody all this grief?
,Thootjeajax,2011-08-08T20:00Z,@dukeyluker there is no class 450 add-on. It is only included in the Portsmouth Direct Line
,airband1,2011-09-22T21:46Z,"Nice download mate as i've got it on my unofficial download but I was wondering how would I get it to download to my official steam version?

Thanks"
,szczepan997,2012-03-12T23:34Z,Why i don't have signals?
