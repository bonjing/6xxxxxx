Eye to Ear, Vol. 2 is another compilation of pieces composed (and sometimes not used) for various short films. For most of the program, it's just Frith overdubbing himself, a talent he's used for decades now. Since these pieces were conceived to augment and accompany images, they tend to evoke mood and feeling rather than being true compositions unto themselves. They run the gamut from dark soundscapes to pretty Asian-sounding themes, and can switch gears dramatically within the course of a single piece.
