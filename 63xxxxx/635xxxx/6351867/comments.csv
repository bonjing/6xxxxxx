,hansolo77,2011-05-11T21:16Z,"I _DID_ download it, and ran it through ABGX, thats why I wrote the comment.  I'm not ""full of it"".  It failed while checking the CRC's, stating it was incorrectly ripped/extracted, content on the disk was manually edited, or archival de-compression failed.  It's probably the .7z archival compression that caused the failure.  Your reply with the cut/paste of ABGX's results is good, but did you try this on your own image file AFTER decompressing the file in your .7z arcive?  If not, you should try that and see if it still comes out clean.  I'll try and redownload it again though, just cause I really want to play this game.  I only offered a comment because you state in your own release details: 

""Any Problems or questions please post a comment.


If this is working fine for you let us know write a comment."""
,hansolo77,2011-05-14T01:35Z,"My sincerest apologies.  I've just finished re-downloading and re-processing though ABGX360, and this new download came out fine.  It must have been something on my end.  If there was any way to remove my warning post that started the argument, I would.  This game is perfectly fine.  Thanks again for posting it."
