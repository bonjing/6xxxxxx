Low amount of seeders though."
,AdrianShephard,2011-05-08T15:32Z,"speed is acceptable.., for now"
,ATP-Studios,2011-05-11T08:14Z,"Great quality, but it glitches and lags like crazy when the episode name title comes up:S is this happening to anyone else or is it just me?"
,ATP-Studios,2011-05-12T04:25Z,"Hey been having some problems with these files, I have downloaded your Seasons 1, 2 and 3 and I noticed when I put in any ep from season 1 and 2 in the Xvid Nics 4 CC Changer it gives u the codec the file was made with and Season 1 And 2 comes up as blank, but your Season 3 and up I am assuming when I put it in comes up as a codec CPcS. Did you encode seasons 1 and 2 differently than 3? Thanks"
,cordazar,2011-05-26T23:21Z,"Too bad the audio quality is so bad. Would've been better to leave out the english audio and made sure that the japanese audio were of tolerable quality.
Otherwise good enough video quality."
,Talismn,2011-06-14T06:48Z,"I suggest you download this: http://www.cccp-project.net/

This is a Codec Pack of the latest packs and includes Windows Media Classic and it plays mkv files perfectly. No problems with the audio or video once you play these files within Media Player Classic."
,ATP-Studios,2011-06-19T18:32Z,"what are you talking about the audio quality is dvd quality, it sounds just as crystal clear as it is on the normal dvds"
,HellRider215,2011-07-15T17:25Z,"I tried to test this torrent by playing the first episode. It plays fine, perfect sound and amazing video quality, untill 1:01 and it stops. I am using VLC and when I reach 1:01 VLC acts as if the video has finished. On episode 2 I get 30 seconds into it fine then VLC comes up with an error message. Once of those ""would you like to send a report"" things. Episode 3 does the same as ep.1 but at 20 seconds. Help please???"
,HellRider215,2011-07-15T19:31Z,I realised how this works now - this is my first time using torrents. Forgive my ignorance. But I am still having a problem with series 1 ep. 2. Any ideas?
,Liet727,2011-08-05T04:07Z,"@HellRider215
I've experienced a similar issue with torrents played in VLC that are in MKV format and use Chapters.  I don't know if these are MKVs (haven't started DLing yet) but if they are, follow this link and scroll to the bottom post for an easy fix.

,satopunch89,2012-02-12T12:34Z,"This is a great torrent. There is the occasional glitch in the title screen or sometimes the video will stop for a moment but other than that, excellent.

I've seeded 1.1GB now and I plan to continue for a while longer."
,satopunch89,2012-02-12T12:36Z,@tracedotz I looked online and I believe there is only 5 seasons and then it carries on into dragonball Z.
