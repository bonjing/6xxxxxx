,joshshire,2011-05-04T01:30Z,tip: if your uploading dubstep/dnb upload in 320kbps if you can. more people will download! I myself would download this but i need 320kbps. good torrent though!
,TheDropNW,2011-05-04T01:50Z,"josh, when I bought this album, it was in 256 kbps. I'm not going to run it through a converter and have it display as 320 kbps when it is actually 256 kbps. If you want ""better"" quality, go download the 320 kbps out now. And thanks for listening :)"
