I thought the results shows were always around 350MB (40mins).
This file is 700MB."
,redactedwv,2011-04-30T05:40Z,"@ chriswhv6 - the only legit copies i've seen [12/12] are all 7+. 

Regardless, TvTeam can always be trusted."
,chriswhv6,2011-04-30T20:22Z,"Thanks for confirming it's good. 
Yeh I've been using TvTeam for a while now and can't say I have ever had any problems with any files. 
I just wanted to double check since this time it was 700mb instead of 350mb as usual.
Thanks TvTeam for posting ep 12 :)"
