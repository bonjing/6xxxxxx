,fgservo,2011-05-01T21:58Z,Thanks for the BBC coverage :D
,ff12,2011-05-02T00:05Z,"is anyone able to connect to the seeders, cause i cant.  says the download should take 10 h"
,ff12,2011-05-02T00:06Z,"i cant connect to any of the seeders, anyone else with this prob? cause at this rate its gonna take 10 hrs to download this."
,ryu360,2011-05-02T01:04Z,THANKS! for the torrent. MotoGP is quality.
,slax2011,2011-05-02T01:39Z,Thanks for posting. Would be nice if people would seed after they download instead of closing their clients because this shit is slow and no seeds
,pxpierre,2011-05-02T02:01Z,"Same as ff12 : can't connect to seeders, only 39.5% done after a couple of hours, same as every other Peers I can see in uTorrent. :("
,Bigyoman,2011-05-02T02:51Z,"I can't connect to the Seeders either.

But I am getting feedback from other Leechers. Please keep seeding/uploading. Thats how i'm getting the file. Im downloading at a steady 1.0-1.1 mb/s  

I'll seed as long as a I can."
,600RR,2011-05-02T07:09Z,"I'm in 85% done.
When i get finished i will leave seeding too.

now I'm downloading at 0.3kbps"
,ff12,2011-05-02T08:54Z,"I think its very strange that it says that there are right now 11 seeders, but no way of connecting with them. Im at 99% now, and not once have i gone over 100kb/s. And im on a 100Mbit line. Its taken 12 hours to download this file. The next race is around the corner..."
,klaaz,2011-05-02T11:51Z,"597 seeders and downloading at 4.8mb/sec. Maybe you all have trouble with your own ISP filtering torrent content?

Great download, thanks!"
,Dark2211,2011-05-02T17:32Z,Downloading...I'll seed 24 hrs all the week ;)
