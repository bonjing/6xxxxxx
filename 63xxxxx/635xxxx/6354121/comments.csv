Why is there no sound in the game?
rather, only certain parts can not, for example, dialogue with Tommy when he went to office, etc., when you listen to the radio in the car, then no voice. but the passers-car voice, etc., the is good."
,RecycleBin32,2012-05-07T19:20Z,It has all the sounds. I don't know whats up with your computers. :|
