Essential Delta Blues is a Compilation Featuring  Muddy Waters, Elmore James, Robert Johnson, John Lee Hooker, Son House, Mississippi John Hurt, Blind Willie Johnson, Big Bill Broonzy, and Many More ...50 Tracks, over 2 hours of music, all in FLAC, ripped with eac, I checked the files that were less than 100% but no less than 98 with pro audio software, as i am a sound engineer, and I can guarantee that there are no glitches audible by the human ears, the spectrum and phase analyzers check out, but I included the log files.. if you want completely uncompressed and lossless tracks, I can do that as well.
