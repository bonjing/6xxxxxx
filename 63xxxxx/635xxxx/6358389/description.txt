Release Notes....: This was a rough release to decide which frame rate to go with.  It seemed to be a pretty close race between 25 and 60
		   fps footage.  I found that more of the high-motion scenes seemed to be 25fps so I decided that would be the best
		   choice to minimize blends or jerkiness.
