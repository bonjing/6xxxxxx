,767392,2011-04-28T12:15Z,can someone please keep the connections solid and not bouncing from 1kb to 100kb. i dont know what the problem is but most of these mp4 have taken almost 2 days to finish. I know I have a speedy connection and my client is set up properly. Its aggravating to watch this loose connection and then gain speed again ever 2 seconds. Please check your connections or reset your modem/router..

[T],trialNerror,2011-04-30T06:01Z,I tried the new uTorrent 3 Beta release and it gave me extremely slow speeds.  Reverted back to the 2.2.1 and uploading instantly went back up to 200 kB/s.
