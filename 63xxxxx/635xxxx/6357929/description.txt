JESUS: THE LOST 40 DAYS fills in the gaps in the historical record. According
to the Bible, Jesus came back from the dead and walked the earth for 40 days
before ascending to heaven. But the New Testament reveals little about this
defining miracle of the Christian faith. Using tools of history, technology,
science and faith, HISTORY tells the little-known story. Long-buried
non-Biblical sources, such as the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary
Magdalene, the Secret Revelation of John and the writings of the Jewish
historian Josephus yield astonishing information and detail about these
seemingly lost 40 days.

Could Jesusâ€™ words in these ancient manuscripts contain some of his most
important teachings, even though they were not included in the New Testament?
The producers also build upon the CGI image of the crucified Christ created
from the Shroud of Turin in The Real Face of Jesus to visually depict the
moments when Jesus appears to his followers in resurrected form.
