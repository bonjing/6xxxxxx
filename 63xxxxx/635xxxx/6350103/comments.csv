Thanks TVTEAM"

Video ok though.

Gave up after 5 mins. Will wait for better."
,iray8t,2011-05-02T13:57Z,"Do not agree with mcr_iron. Sound is just fine! Dont know if it is true 5.1 but it sounds quite good. This is by far the best copy out there, an excellent R5"
,paumon,2011-10-02T18:38Z,"BIG zero on the sound.
Mcr_iron is quite right. It's Ac3 but the front channels are all mixed up and no sound from the rear channels."
