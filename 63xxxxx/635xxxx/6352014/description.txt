Alright here we go with the first cam of soul surfer... wouldn't normally do this but had lots of bitching and was bored so why not.



video we had was pretty solid, just did a bit of cleanup on the colors slight denoiser usual video filters didn't need much . minus one of the fattest fucks heads poppin up from time to time. he starts off in the begninning then goes away for most of the movie but comes back for about the last 20 minutes near the end...



still perfectly watchable imo but your call, if you don't like it reccomend contacting the authorities tellin em that our cam wasn't as good as you paid for (:



onto audio, real solid cam audio . bit of audience reaction and chatter maybe 3 times throughout movie. cleaned up some extra noise and bit of audience shit but other than that was practically line.



Also our cam starts from the opening sequence and goes all the way to the last ending credit since the movie had some extras after it ends overall another very watchable cam,



As always 2 samples are included check em out before you d/l
