these are some of the tools used to flash motorola phones.  

files included are;

rsdlite 2.8 with drivers 
and
MPT 5.7

I will answer questions as I can but if you brick your phone, I cannot be responsible.  In other words sorry no new phone.

Just remember:
Fully charge the phone first
Read read read and then read some more


It's not brain surgery it's just another "CAAACH of the day"

ENJOY!! and please seed I have a slow connection.
