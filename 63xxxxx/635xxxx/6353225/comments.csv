Please take the time to seed once you've downloaded this for Ronnie's sake."
,Exoaria,2011-04-29T14:50Z,"Please don't forget to seed, it's really important that this happens. They might not be overly popular right this moment but if there's one thing we can do to help Ronnie, it's getting this torrent alive!"
,CowBandit,2011-06-07T07:38Z,"Worse quality ever. But I guess its a sneak peak to what this band is going to come out with. I'm looking forward to their first album, They sound heaps good, Maybe even better than Ronnie's previous band ""Escape the fate"".  +1 from me :) and will seed."

,Powellxxx,2011-06-26T15:44Z,I think people should stop bad mouthing Craig and Ronnie you should all grow up and realize that Escape the fate are still a great band and Falling in reverse is a great band two they are both very talented so just grow up and leave them both alone and stop arguing about whose better like little kids PS. ETF AND FIR ARE BOTH EPIC
