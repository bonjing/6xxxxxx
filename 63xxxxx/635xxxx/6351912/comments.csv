,Chocolatate,2011-06-06T18:25Z,"Thanks for the up wrongfun

Are there any more seeders out there? I am averaging about 60kB/s. This is the best looking copy of the entire first Naruto series that I have seen on any torrent site. Not to mention its the original uncut Japanese video with English dub.

This is a very awesome torrent and once again thanks wrongfun! The video and audio quality are top notch. 10/10 in my book."
,Chocolatate,2011-06-07T16:54Z,"27 leechers and only 5 seeds? Please more seeds. I am pulling a very random variety of download speeds. It will stay in the 60-80 kB/s range then jump to 100-300 kB/s range then drop again. I am between 1 and 6 days on download completion.

Please seed more, Thanks!"

,ReapTermin,2012-02-24T03:02Z,"Best Naruto torrent in terms of quality, but it lacks seeders. And seeders and leechers, please cap your upload/download to about 65% of your bandwidth--much more reliable."
,Criminet2,2012-04-03T18:13Z,"silliest things i've heard ... 
asking the initial uploader to Get more seeders
asking downloaders to limit their upload 
IDIOTS"
