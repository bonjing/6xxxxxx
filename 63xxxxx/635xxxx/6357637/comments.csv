,ta_clark,2011-05-01T00:40Z,"fake fake fake.  I have peer blocker running, when I opened this torrent NO seeds or leechers connect to me.  I tried multiple times with the same results each time.  With over 2000 alleged seeders and over 5000 alleged leechers this should not be possible if it was legit.  Another torrent with a similiar name but underscores instead of periods I am downloading now without an issue."

,Byakuya88,2011-05-01T19:09Z,"Never gotten anything bad from eztv. Don't expect this is, either. Some folks just need to learn these really neat things called torrents and how they work. Anyway, why is 2005 in the file name? That's the only thing that bothers me."
,gmooney,2011-05-01T19:47Z,"2005 is the year the series started again after previously ending in the 80's, 2005 is commonly used to distinguish the 'new' version of the series"
,sien25575,2011-05-03T14:29Z,"@ta_clark and anyone else who says it's fake or a .rar file, you are obviously on crack.
Thanks for the upload ez, top upload as always."
,Sontaran,2011-05-04T05:49Z,"Thanks, EZTV!
