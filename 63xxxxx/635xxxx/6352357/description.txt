Mid seventies Hard Rock band from Columbus Ohio,Was on Millineum Records an offshoot of Casablanca Records,Their First Album Produced by Don Brewer(Grandfunk Railroad)Songs about Leather,Women and Booze A Bikers Dream! Their second Album Nothings Sacred did not Fair so well as Don Brewer walked out of the studio to play with the Bob Seger Band and left the band to finish on there own,another album proceeded "Mongolians" Rare and hard to find,I hope you enjoy this album as much as I did when it first came out and still is one of my favorites to this day!
