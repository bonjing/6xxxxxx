Hide Your Heart (AKA Notes From America), is the seventh album by Bonnie Tyler released in 1988. It was produced by Desmond Child.

It features the song "Hide Your Heart" written by Paul Stanley, Desmond Child and Holly Knight. This song was later covered four times in 1989 on Kiss' Hot in the Shade, Ace Frehley's Trouble Walkin', Robin Beck's Trouble Or Nothin', and Molly Hatchet's Lightning Strikes Twice. It also features the original version of the track "Save Up All Your Tears", which would be covered, with a faster arrangement, by Cher on her 1991 album Love Hurts.

Another album track is "The Best", later covered by Tina Turner. Also included is Bonnie Tyler's remake of Turner's 1986 "Don't Turn Around" (which was also a #1 UK hit for Aswad in 1988 and an international hit by Ace of Base in 1994).
