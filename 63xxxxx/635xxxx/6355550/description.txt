A small but very useful tool, especially after ripping/copying entire websites and you need to find the images inside all the chaos.

Works only with .JPG files.

I desided to make this small application after using the HTTrack Website Copier that copied images in their respective folders. Which meant that I had to go through alot of folders and copy each one .... one folder at a time.


Version 2 now includes option for determine the image sizes. This way we don't copy/move all the crappy banners or thumbnails and such.


Requirements: .NET 3.5 + some additional V2.0 Frameworks but I figure that most people have updated their windows within the last couple of years. Otherwise, if you get an error then just update your windows.

If you meet the above requirements then No Install Needed.
