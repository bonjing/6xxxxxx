1. Install the G DATA (Trial or Full version) and restart your computer. 
   (If already installed, then skip to Step 2.) 

2. Before using the Trial Reset make sure that you are connected to internet,
   and close other running applications. (In case of problems, try temporary 
   disabling the HIPS and firewall.)	

3. To extend the trial period, just run the Trial Reset and select [RESET]. 
   * Sometimes logging on to the servers fails cause they're overloaded. 
     In that case please try again.
