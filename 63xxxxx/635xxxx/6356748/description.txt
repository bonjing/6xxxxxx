This is a very rare show to find. Meat Loaf live in St. Petersburg, Florida was recorded from the audience on August 23rd, 1989. The picture and audio quality aren't great. In fact we get to see a whole lot of black screens during the concert as the taper was in the middle of the crowd trying to fil over and past the other fans. The sound is low and has a hiss. The show itself however is very entertaining.
