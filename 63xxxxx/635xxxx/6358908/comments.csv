,Henjin,2011-05-05T18:23Z,"As soon as i try to host, it says ""Portal.exe has stopped working... Why is this ? :/"
,ItsDrastik,2011-05-07T02:46Z,"@Henjin - Did you try update? look at the first comment for link. If your portal still crashes after you update, I'm not sure whats wrong."

To play coop over lan or Hamachi:

1) Enter the game one both computers and Enable Developer Console in the options.

2) Hit "" ` "" to open the console. Then type in... sv_lan 1.

3) The client should connect first as it disconnects if the host is in the empty game for a few seconds, but the client can wait forever.
Client: Type into the console... connect replacing the with an ip.
For example... connect 192.168.1.3

4) Host then selects the map by entering into their own console... map mp_coop_ replacing the with the name of the map of choice listed below.
For example... map mp_coop_start

5) The host will connect and the client will see the blue bar fill, finally entering the game.

slows your pc down alot, don't run!"
,ItsDrastik,2011-05-13T05:14Z,"seiphirot12002 - When you open Hamachi, it will display your Hamachi IP address. Create a new network or join the one that fr334a11 has been kind enough to make for us. Open the Hamachi Co-op file that you downloaded from this torrent and click on 'Start Hosting', at the very same time on another computer enter the Hamachi IP address of the hosting computer and click 'Connect'.

P.S: You and the person you are planning to play with must be connected to the same Hamachi network."

The instructions say 'Copy the ""Patch.exe"" into your Portal 2 directory and run it.' Where exactly is the directory, though?  I copied it into the folder where Portal 2 is and ran it, but all it did was slow down my computer. "
