,TheBlakDog,2011-07-21T17:44Z,"Gentlemen, I am not here to complain, but I would like some detailed instructions if I may. I am a Noob and I'm not a dummy, but the readme file did not explain how to work the patch very clearly. Could you please find some time out of your day to give an explicit and detailed, step by step guide in the proper installation of the patch please? I have downloaded the game, burned the dvd, and installed the game. I have also downloaded the patch, I followed the directions to the best of my ability with no positive results, again without trying to be critical, the readme file is not very detailed. I have all the components but not enough directions, could you please help a Noob out? I do understand this is Single Player only. Thanks again.  Best regards,
                                           B."
