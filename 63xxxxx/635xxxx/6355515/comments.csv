,darshjr2,2011-05-01T02:53Z,The speed is meh... 300 kb/s but small file size 
,darshjr2,2011-05-01T03:01Z,ITS WORKING PERFECTLY!!!!!!! just run the exe then go to the software folder and click the set-up file!!!! youve done it again thethingy!
,theonewithboringusername,2011-05-01T13:36Z,"I think the DL speed is fine, considering I'm downloading two other things. How come it only says ""Preorder"" on the Adobe website? I assumed none of these were out yet."
[V],thethingy,2011-05-01T14:26Z,^^they will be released next week
,theonewithboringusername,2011-05-01T15:39Z,"Oh, okay, thanks for the download!"

,GENO71,2011-06-15T22:54Z,"whats up thethingy,

I've torrented AI and PS from you (both work great, thanks), and I already have the HOSTS file edited. For AI I skipped the HOSTS file editing part, and went straight to install, and it worked great. Can I do this for any Adobe software? Thanks again for the great torrents"

,DameGiggsy,2011-06-25T05:18Z,You're awesome. Your uploads have never failed me. Cheers. xx
,prs_fan,2011-06-25T18:12Z,"Torrent downloads and installs very easy! Thank you, thethingy!

Doesn't seem to be a metronome with this program though, big let down for me, and it's retarded because Audition 3.0 even had a metronome function. What use is bars and beats time display or a tempo if you can't play along with the beats? Am I supposed to just look on as the beats go by in silence and try to match it? Doesn't make any sense to me.

Also, what is updating the apps? I don't know what the apps are or where to find them, Adobe's website had no updates for Audition CS5.5."
,sk8terman,2011-07-21T02:18Z,"Im having a little trouble, it worked fine but every time i close the program and go to re-enter it invalidates the product key. Im running the current mozilla firefox. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but One product key worked but it then went invalid with the rest, any suggestions?"

,dubbrah,2011-11-02T09:23Z,"this is prob a real dumb question, but, is it OK to change the hosts file back to the original one after the program is successfully downloaded? I'm so clueless, sorry. 
Thanks for the torrent thethingy! I appreciate it much!"
,luvtpb123,2011-11-18T20:15Z,"so afer runnin .exe it unextracts im guessing with a setup.exe and a /serials folder?

,yippyjp,2011-12-18T01:48Z,"My torrent went fine (thanks thethingy) and I replaced host file etc, however I'm not getting a license error once I've opened the program for the first time, (or even the tenth). 
Should I replace the dll file/s anyway or just do nothing?

Also I have other adobe products from thethingy installed so that could be one reason why.
Cheers"
,torbot1,2011-12-29T04:53Z,thanks to all !
,noplan,2012-01-17T12:58Z,"I don't know whats up. I tried it a lot of times. The Problems:

My host file look like my lmhost.sam file in your video tutorial without any stuff beneath the text, all that is in the hosts file. What's up with that? I tried different constellations, make the steps with the lmhostsfile and the hostsfile ect. nothing works

Another thing: Before starting the Installation the hosts file look like it should before installation, and immediately after starting the installation the copy and paste hosts stuff is deleted.

When my hosts file is automatically reset at this point is this normal or have I chance anything?

One more: In the trial version with method 2 with changing the dlls this also doesnt works.

This is in both constellations the failure notice:

couldn't be initialized the right way... (0xc000001d)

Whats up with that? I got a sempron and during the installation there is a message that my system specification doesnt fit but it has to run also, or what???
"
,noplan,2012-01-17T13:58Z,"Always after installation the hosts file is put in the original configuration. Maybe its the system, i dont know, normally everythings works fine"
