You can tell which is which whether or not the beginning is Black & White, or is correctly Sepia Toned (as well as some of the later zombie scenes being darker in color timing and lighting).

Here is an example:

,FulciLives,2012-05-06T13:41Z,"Unfortunately this is the original pressing which has the start in b/w along with other negative aspects to the image. According to one review (and I quote):

""When the very first advanced reviews came out, the news that the film's prologue was in black & white was only part of the problem.  In addition, there were issues with the brightness level, and apparent issues with a low bit-rate.  I'm not one for measuring bit-rates, but I guess it was a visible issue.  The good news is that with this new pressing, the film looks outstanding.  The prologue is properly tinted, black levels are back where they should be, and the amount of detail is really outstanding.  The Beyond has never looked even remotely this good, not even theatrically, and the DVDs are way behind Arrow's new HD presentation."""
