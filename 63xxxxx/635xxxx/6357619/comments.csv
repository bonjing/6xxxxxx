This is NOT workprint, this is dvdrip. Quality is great! 10/10 It`s even better than Hive-CM8 release, cause CM8 release is 720x304, and this is 720x400."

,Jackass Jimm,2011-05-04T05:38Z,"hate that I watched the workprint.  Even though I got the gist of the movie, seeing the movie with the effects during the funny parts, I'm sure, make them more funny. There were times (when the two are running, the bees, etc) in which the joke felt empty or I just didn't realize it until way into the joke becase there wasn't a visual.

I might download it, but man, I loathe watching movies over again (no matter how good).  "
,IcenDark,2011-05-04T10:52Z,Is there any subtitle?
,ofogoding,2011-05-04T13:35Z,"Good lord, this was awesome. One of the funniest movies I've watched the last decade. The way they pull this off is just incredible.
