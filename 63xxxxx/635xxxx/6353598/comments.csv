[V],scene4all,2011-05-03T19:18Z,"LOL avg, dude u need to stop using that antivirus and get a real one like Kaspersky. As stated in the description i scanned it with Kaspersky Internet Security and its all clean, as at virus total Kaspersky doesn't say its got any kind of Trojan. If u don't believe me then don't download."

,bishalgtm,2011-05-06T09:47Z,Usually KeyGens and Patches are detected as viruses !! Our antivirus says those softwares as Viruruses if they bring change in registry. As patches bring change in registry and make Particular software as REGISTERED version..so Antiviruses tell them as Virus. NO NEED TO AFRAID THEM AS VIRUSES coz you are doing illegeal work yourself. So be thankful to the Uploader and Enjoy.
