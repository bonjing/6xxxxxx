Source LKRG and mustangman ...............Thanks 

+Quote from LKRG nfo  +

Okay reason for READ NFO the russian cam is missing about 3 minutes odd spots for about 2 seconds here and there so occasionally for about 10 15 seconds audio might be oos
because its catching up,and the russian cam is missing a minute and a half from the ending but our audio had it so i left the audio intact and just had a scene repeat it's self
because listening to the audio you will very well understand how the movie ends i really doubt that 1 last minute had any crucial image that would ruin the movie for you.





What ive done is change the rgb colours again colours still dont seem right to me but better imo slightest smoother and slight denoise ..Check out the sample 1st as imo its not greatest cam but did what i could with it and kept the file size down to a minimum
