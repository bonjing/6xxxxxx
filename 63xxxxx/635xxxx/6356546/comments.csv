,seedmonst,2011-04-30T12:25Z,"Also I probably should have asked, but what do you use to host the Battle.net server? I've got a spare server sitting in my office and 30mbit of bandwidth to kill, might as well put it to more use."
,Frezzno,2011-04-30T12:38Z,It's an old RPG game from the early 2000. You can play single player too or what ever.
,Frezzno,2011-04-30T12:41Z,"I use PVPGN. Apparently ilegal, specially in US. But You can join servers in other countries, Sweden in this case."
,Frezzno,2011-04-30T12:49Z,"WTF, can't see the comments."
,Frezzno,2011-04-30T16:20Z,Update: Seems like there are some D2 players out there already. If you have a favourite single player character I can import it to my server. But it won't be a ladder game.
,JLoy32,2011-05-01T02:58Z,I keep getting an error saying it's unable to confirm my application version any suggestions frezzno?
,Frezzno,2011-05-01T04:22Z,Win vista and 7 may have to run updates and reg files in admin mode.
,seedmonst,2011-05-01T04:51Z,"Still more peers than seeds at 50 ratio, I'll put the ratio cap to 100. Uploaded around 100GB so far, I like :)"
,Frezzno,2011-05-01T17:37Z,"Just wanna add why you wanna play on a server instead of single player.

,Frezzno,2011-05-03T23:29Z,Right-click and select run as admin.
,8i11y,2011-05-18T00:48Z,downloaded works great ...... but i cant connect to ur server......wat am i doing wrong 
,lamer8238,2011-05-19T04:02Z,"after i have unpacked d2me-11x.rar, D2LOD-1.12A-enGB.rar and D2-1.12A-enGB.rar i ran the D2LODPatch_113c and an error came out. it says ""an error occured preparing the patch. This problem can commonly  be corrected by reinstalling the game  and trying  the update again. If this error repeats  then contact Blizzard Technical Support"". plz help.. i did try intalling the d2 but it needs 26 character cd-key.. plz do help"
,bananatrapp,2011-05-19T14:33Z,"When I try to connect, the game says something like ""can't determine what version of the game you have"" and I can't connect because of that. Do you know what's wrong? The patch seemed to install fine ..."
,Frezzno,2011-05-24T17:03Z,The pass is in the rar. It's the weird looking file name. That's the pass. Also as I commented earlier. Win vista and 7 needs to run updates and reg files in admin mode. Right click the file and choose run as admin.
,raphael.almeida,2011-05-25T19:14Z,"I'm gettint the same problem as JLoy32. Says that battle.net is unable do identify my application version. I use win. 7. 
I tryed to run the reg. file as admin but if I right click D2LoD_Frez_server.reg it doesn't have the option to run as admin.
What do I do?
ps.: I'm from Brazil, there's no problem with conection because of that right?"
,Frezzno,2011-05-26T05:36Z,Then you go to control panel account settings and create an admin account. Log in with it and you should have better options.
,g2c337,2011-05-26T12:00Z,hey. just finished download but i cant seem to find the cd-key. can tell me which polder is it in??? thanks

,goingbaldy,2011-06-23T03:35Z,"dont waste time, not precracked and no cd key"
,deadsumoner,2011-06-23T22:24Z,aa dude it was working just fine for me the single and the multiplayer but like few days ago it started saing for the multiplayer that blizzard has diactivated the cd key so yeah...i can still play single player though
,darkhawk64,2011-07-06T06:32Z,"There is a cd-key people, granted he did put it in there a little weird, however it really wasn't that hard to spot. In the folder it's a file called D2code-blahblahblahcode just right-click and properties and copy and paste everything after the - and there you go people ^_^ thanks frezzno!"
,Draveil,2011-07-07T02:29Z,"Can anyone else seed please? love this game, and i cant wait to play on your server"
