Recruitment, selection and assessment procedures sometimes make use of aptitude tests, which are designed to measure oneâ€™s potential for achievement.
The Ultimate Aptitude Book includes verbal, numerical, perceptual and practical tests as well as exercises testing specific aptitudes such as memory and dexterity. It also covers personality and motivational tests, which assess leadership, management and social awareness aptitudes.
This book is valuable for anyone who wants to see how their own unique aptitudes might best be used in a wide range of careers. For those people already in a career, it can show them how to develop their existing role as well as guide them toward a possible change of direction.
