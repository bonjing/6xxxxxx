====::::----Additional notes----::::==== 



Critically acclaimed as a "superstar line-up" death metal outfit, the band is the brainchild of Mikael Ã…kerfeldt, along with the rest of the original members of Bloodbath, to bring back old school death metal.



Mikael Ã…kerfeldt left Bloodbath about a year after the release of "Resurrection Through Carnage" because he wanted to focus on his more serious group Opeth, but he still performed with the band at Wacken 2005. He then returned to the band in 2008.



Peter Tagtgren replaced Mikael for the "Nightmares Made Flesh" release.
