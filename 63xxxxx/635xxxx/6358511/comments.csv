,209zG8stevr,2011-05-01T17:27Z,uploading more than dlling but thats freaking fine becuz i gotta upload anyways and it aint like im paying for dis shyt so my few words to those who whine bout a lack of seeding: if you didnt go thru the work (blood sweat and tears not to mention tha illegal stuf) than STFU and SEED urself B4 you get it than we can know your down for the scene

,lwalch1,2011-05-01T19:19Z,come on seed this shizz
,clyde4210,2011-05-01T22:17Z,"It's that so many are downloading you are getting so little seeders, as the tracker my be off."
,rand70,2011-05-01T22:30Z,Limiting you fucking tard!
,c3bhm,2011-05-02T00:16Z,THE QUALITY COULD BE SOOO MUCH BETTER IF THIS WERE ENCODED W/ H.264 IN A .MP4 VIDEO FORMAT.  (OR THE FILE SIZE COULD BE MUCH MUCH SMALLER AT THIS QUALITY.)  WE NEED TO GET RID OF .AVI VIDEOS FROM NOW ON!!!
,scoopnohlee,2011-05-02T00:16Z,wow five thousand seeders and yet only 30 are seeding.  Unreal
,xCorePurple,2011-05-02T01:24Z,"I appreciate this torrent being uploaded but seriously on BitTorrent its showing that there are 5070 Seeders and only 53 are Seeding! At this time of night I normally get 500kB/s. However with this torrent im only getting 35-70kB/s, its a fucking joke. I'm seeding at 40kB/s and thats the best i can do, you would think if someone was going to upload a torrent they would have a beast of a connection but by the looks of things this is not the case. People seed for god sakes!"
,xCorePurple,2011-05-02T04:00Z,Just another comment about the video this time... The video quality is really good got no complaints with it the audio is clear and in sync. My download speed did speed up in the end to around 400kB/s it took its time but it got there in the end. Thanks for the upload ill continue to seed.
,tprice78,2011-05-02T07:21Z,Seeding
,rocketman1970,2011-05-02T16:34Z,"Ok Gentleman, you need to dig around a little bit to get what you want. Yea it takes time and a little work. Just because a torrent has a shit load of hits doesn't mean it's the best one. Here's where I got my ufc 129. It's perfect in everyway. Has good download speed too. Go here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6358776/UFC_129 Download it and quit your bitchin."
