,funfunfunfun,2011-09-17T21:21Z,"Can't get this to work for some reason. Downloaded twice. Run the installer, see it in process list and memory usage just keeps rising (up to 600,000k at one point) but nothing happens."
,Crudey,2011-09-18T20:46Z,It works perfect for me on my PC thats running on windows 7 but its a hassle on my laptop that runs on windows XP.
,rajoshu,2011-09-25T22:21Z,"To get this to work rightclick the installer:
Go to compatibility.
Check the: Run this program in compatibility mode for: Windows 2000
and all the day down.
Check the: Run this program as an administrator.

Problem solved (for the most)

If it doesn't work, try any other windows compatibility (windows XP etc)"
