is there a rule in your policies that allow haters to write the kind of things killeurkilleur is writing about twentyforty. If you voted 20-40 to become a VIP, i suppose his work and posts are VIP too so why do you tolerate such haters? I think killeurkilleur is attacking the whole integrity of TPB while your permitting such acts. Please, do something about it...thanks..."
