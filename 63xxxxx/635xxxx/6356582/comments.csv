,sk8foreva,2012-01-25T18:24Z,any idea why the context menu isnt working?
,CK4LxALPHAx,2012-02-20T09:09Z,"To all that are having problems with the shortcut, do not fret - there is an easy solution.

Step one: Open WTM (Windows Task Manager - Ctrl + Alt + Del or right click on your icon bar at the bottom of your screen and go to Windows Task Manager)

Step two: Go to Processes

Step Three: Scroll down to Steam, and end the process. 

After all that, the shortcut works. I made an account just to post this, just because of how successful the torrent is. Thank ya uploader."
