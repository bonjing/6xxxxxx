Huw Edwards, Sophie Raworth and Fiona Bruce present full, uninterrupted coverage of the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. As the prince and princess-in-waiting make their final preparations, Sophie Raworth invites some of the 1,900 guests at the ceremony to share their thoughts and feelings about the royal couple ahead of the service, while Alex Jones reports from Kate's home village, Bucklebury, where the locals will be out in force to cheer on their most-celebrated resident. Huw Edwards provides the commentary as the Archbishop of Canterbury presides over the marriage ceremony, before the newlyweds step out onto the balcony at Buckingham Palace in one of the most historic moments of our time.
