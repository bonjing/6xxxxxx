back in 1965 they were already legends, the first drugs songs were written by lead singer Warner Landkroon.
On their debut single the B Side was Tanger, and that was were they sold wietjes.
Their second single: smoke a pipe and you like it, speaks for itself.
Further you find 2 never released recordings, and two demo versions of  already familiar songs
