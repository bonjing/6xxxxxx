Witness the thrilling conclusion to the adventure of a lifetime!

In the aftermath of his epic battle with Piccolo, Goku embarks on an electrifying quest to rescue his fallen friends from the realm of the dead. His perilous journey will take him to the heights of Korin Tower â€“ and beyond â€“ as he searches for Kami, a mystical being with the power to resurrect Shenron and restore the magic of the seven Dragon Balls!

But even if Goku succeeds in raising the dead, thereâ€™s no guarantee heâ€™ll live long enough to enjoy a reunion with his slain comrades. The World Martial Arts tournament is just around the corner, and an eerily-familiar foe known only as Junior wants to teach Goku the true meaning of pain! To survive the tournament and finally earn the title of Worldâ€™s Greatest Martial Artist, Goku must train his mind as well as his body in order to complete his amazing transformation from a bushy-tailed boy into a man to be reckoned with!
