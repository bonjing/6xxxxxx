Is there any pther media server which installs directly on PS3, and you can use PS3 as media player without PC?"
,Devcomm,2011-05-16T07:55Z,"I don't know of anything that does what you're asking. You can't install apps on your PS3 unless you do some hacking, or Sony allows them, such as Netflix.

This was the simplest and quickest way that I found to get the media server to work properly on my Win7 machine. The built in streaming would not work for me."
