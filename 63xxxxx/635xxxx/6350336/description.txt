This program is open source and free for all. I use this on my windows 7 PC to stream media to my PS3. It will play any file on your PS3 because it transcodes on the fly. Play all your HD shows and movies that are in .mkv (and just about any other format) without having to wait hours for them to transcode in to a playable format again!

I am not the creator, just sharing the current version with everyone.
