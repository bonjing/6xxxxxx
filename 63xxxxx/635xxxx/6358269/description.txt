    Unix for Mac OS X Users

    Author: Kevin Skoglund



    Unix for Mac OS X Users unlocks the powerful capabilities of

    Unix that underlie Mac OS X, teaching how to use command-line

    syntax to perform common tasks such as file management, data

    entry, and text manipulation. The course teaches Unix from the

    ground up, starting with the basics of the command line and

    graduating to powerful, advanced tools like grep, sed, and

    xargs. The course shows how to enter commands in Terminal to

    create, move, copy, and delete files and folders; change file

    ownership and permissions; view and stop command and application

    processes; find and edit data within files; and use command-line

    shortcuts to speed up workflow. Exercise files accompany the

    course.



    Topics include:



    * Moving around the file system

    * Creating and reading files

    * Copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files and directories

    * Creating hard links and symbolic links

    * Understanding user identity, file ownership, and sudo

    * Setting file permissions with alpha and octal notation

    * Changing the PATH variable

    * Configuring the Unix working environment
