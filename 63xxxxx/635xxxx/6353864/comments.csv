The audio plays through as it should, but the video from the beginning half of CD 1 is the beginning of both CDs and the ending half of CD2 is at the ending half of both CDs. The beginning half and the ending half are fine, but the middle half is wrong. Would have been perfect if the picture and audio matched throughout."
