,dougcjohn,2011-05-27T15:16Z,"Download was clean & successful, but running DMG file Opens an Install File and Prompts to Burn & Create a DVD. I've attempted 2 different ways to burn a DMG to DVD. Running from DVD, the DMG continues to prompt the same thing... Before Install, must create a DVD Install Disc. If try to create in BURN, it won't work since it's not an ISO file. I'm not strong in Mac OS, but I don't see a path to get this DMG file to work & install."
