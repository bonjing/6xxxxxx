This is my first upload, I sure hope it works!

This is the Troma film, 'Blondes Have More Guns'. I bought the DVD several months ago because I couldn't find a torrent, so I'm filling that gap.

The film is useful for Lost Odyssey fans, or more specifically Jansen Friedh fans. The star is Michael McGaham, the voice of Jansen, in one his few roles. Such a shame...

Anyway, it's a pretty hiliarious flick, and has that low budget Troma charm we've come to love and expect.


Please seed when done! Spread the love!
