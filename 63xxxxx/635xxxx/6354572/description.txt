When the Anthropology class assembles for their final exam, Shirley notices a twinge, which quickly escalates into full-blown labor. As Jeff and Britta argue about how best to help, Chang is anxious to claim this "early" labor as clear evidence that it's a "Chang Baby!" Meanwhile, Greendale is hosting a World Food Festival in the parking lot and a riot ensues - Dean Pelton is caught in the crossfire.


P.S. It's the 21-st century, so no damn RARs, enjoy!
