,emirturco,2011-05-13T04:51Z,"1) download the program utorrent looking at google (it's free and easy to use)
2) After you installed tha program, download the torrent (open, yes)
3) Utorrent will start downloading.When you have 100% completed, click on the torrent (right), open the container folder, right click on the movie torrent (mkv), and play.
4)If you don't have MKV (Matroska) look at google and download what your reproducer needs (It's free).
5)More, ask uncle google, it's wasn't easy for anybody the first time. "
