,falvebarm,2011-04-29T07:56Z,"I have not yet downloaded this, so I have the following questions:

(1)  If this really IS ""Avatar"", why is the file named, ""RED BIRD""?  
(2)  If this is actually 3D, how does one view it in 3D -- with special glasses?"
,mjnhbg3,2011-04-30T00:43Z,The movie is named Red Bird because that is the name of the original rip file (i don't know why) and you will need 3d glasses for your computer (check out the nvidia 3d vision kit) or you can burn the iso file to a blu-ray and play it on a 3d tv. By the way seeding will speed up as of today.
,falvebarm,2011-04-30T23:40Z,I'm hoping that the 3-D glasses I got when I saw Avatar at the theater will work.  But I have doubts.
,mjnhbg3,2011-05-01T02:02Z,Don't count on it.
,AkimboMayhem,2011-05-03T01:52Z,Only ONE seeder ? Seems very strange... And that seeder doesn't seem to be transmitting any packets to me. D/L stuck on 40%
,falvebarm,2011-05-03T09:10Z,"Suspicions confirmed:  The ""Real 3D"" glasses obtained at the theater do NOT work with this torrent's video.  Lousy old fasioned red/blue glassed are required.  Too bad since the new polarized Real 3D system is MUCH better than the crappy red/blue system.  Tsk."
,mjnhbg3,2011-05-03T22:59Z,There is a way to convert (in real time) side by side 3d to the red and blue glasses format.
,mjnhbg3,2011-05-03T23:12Z,"Oh and you can't watch this by crossing your eyes because it's all backwards. The only way to watch this is to 
A. Convert it to Red/Blue

B. Use the nvidia 3d vision kit for your computer (nvidia graphics card and 120hz screen required.
or
C. Get a 3d tv (if you don't have one) and burn the iso to a Blu-ray disc (or compress it if you don't have a Blu-ray burner and put it on a dvd) and watch it 3d.

You can use AVCHD Coder for compression or if your Blu-ray player won't play the disc.

And yes I like parentheses."

,verbatim31,2011-05-07T23:13Z,"Unfortunately i've had some issues.
I'm still waiting on the MKV to finish downloading so it's only the ISO part i'm referring to here.
I transferred the ISO over to a Popcorn A200 and while the film does play it suffers from audio sync problems and stuttering.
This perhaps is a Popcorn issue ?
I then attempted to convert the ISO to a MKV using MakeMKV first and Pavetube Bytecopy secondly.
MakeMKV displayed errors and froze while Pavetube refused to recognise the ISO.
Lastly i burned the ISO onto a BD-R using DVDfab 8 and tried to play the disc on a Panasonic BDT-310 and a PS3.
Sadly the stuttering and audio sync problems remain.
In no way am i suggesting this torrent is a dud this is just my own personal experience to date.
Hopefully i will have more success with the MKV.
If any one could help me out with any of the above i would be very grateful."
,AkimboMayhem,2011-05-10T13:09Z,"What a HUGE waste of time (8 days) & effort this download was. The ISO version is stuttery, and has no audio coming thru on my Sony 3D TV. The 3D itself drops in & out, which is a bit weird. It should have been created as 2 separate downloads which would have made the disappointment a whole lot quicker - and would not have used up half of my monthly 50GB limit :-(  GIVE THIS A MISS !!!"
,mjnhbg3,2011-05-10T13:26Z,Sorry about this i promise that in a couple of days i will have a fully working iso that doesn't stutter. It will take a while due to extra encoding but i will post the link here soon

Here is the new working iso."
,boytoy2009,2011-08-12T21:42Z,"I downloaded the files fine. The original ISO was way out of sync (about 5 second delay between pic and audio), but converting the mkv using tsmuxer and buring to blu ray worked a treat (just remember to remove the HD audio). Plays absoutely great on my 3d TV. Thanks!"
,dandeedan,2011-10-10T08:12Z,just bye it u fuking cheapskates! Surely a movie like avatar in 3D u will need PROPER HDMI cable and PROPER BLURAY PLAYER like a ps3 to enjoy the benifits PROPERLY!
,cris11,2012-05-04T12:30Z,"will i get good results if i download and convert it to Anaglyph red-cyan glasses version with Xilisoft 3D Video Converter ? Did someone tried this before ?
Ty in advance . There is 2 video files but idk if one already in red-cyan for glasses ?"
