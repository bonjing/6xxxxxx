Plot:

The film starts with a footballer, named Lorry (Prateik Babbar), who along with his girlfriend gets admission into some college in USA. But due to insufficient funds, he is unable to fulfil his dream. He is sad as his girlfriend is leaving so his friend, Ricky cheers him up by taking him to a party. He then tells him that he can get him into the US college where his girlfriend is going to be, but there only one condition. To do that he will have to smuggle a few packets of cocaine along with him. At first he disagrees but then he finally agrees and gets cocaine sealed in his bags. At the airport he successfully passes the X-ray machine and is all set to leave.

The story then revolves back a few years and introduces us to ACP Vishnu Kamath (Abhishek Bachchan). Kamath is a corrupt cop who accepts a lot of bribes in order to satisfy his family. But one day it turns out that life takes revenge from him and his family dies in a car accident. Then back to the present year, he is offered a job by the Chief Minister of Goa. The job is to flush out all the drug gangsters in Goa. He accepts the job and forms a team who helps him with the case. According to Goa Police Department, the drug supply in Goa is distributed in four parts. One is the Russian Drug Mafia, the other is Nigerian, then English and the final one is the local people of Goa. First they attack the Russian Region, then carry on with Nigeria and England and the local. This leads to a panic among the drug suppliers and as a result Rave Parties are cancelled and the drug supply comes to a halt. The drug dealers gather for a meeting lead by Zoey (Bipasha Basu). Zoey guarantees them that their drugs will be in safe hands, if they give them away to a person named Michael Barbosa, a person who has no identity and moves like a shadow and has helped them out for ages. All of the Drug dealers agree with Zoey. This frustrates Kamath as he is unable to get to the drugs. So he decides to chase Michael Barbosa in order to get the drugs. He finds out Via his sources about of the drug 
dealer named Ricky. Ricky is all set with Lorry to smuggle drugs to USA, but when Kamath reaches out for Ricky, he is already dead. Kamath and his cops check out Ricky's apartment where they find out about him smuggling cocaine to USA, they also find out about his Live-in girlfriend named Rozanna who is from Brazil and once used to see Lorry. So with all this information they reach the Goa International Airport on the same day when Lorry is about to leave. At the airport Kamath encounters Rozanna, Ricky's girlfriend and identifies her as she had been wearing the same kind of a bra that they previously found in Ricky's apartment. The Cops detain Rozanna and check her mobile phone. Kamath finds out a photo of Lorry in Rozanna. 

She is allowed to go after she is found innocent. Later, when Kamath and his cops are searching the airport for the drug dealer, Kamath identifies Lorry as the person he had seen in Rozanna's phone. They then detain him and on searching his luggage they find out 2kg out cocaine stuffed in his bag.Later, Lorry is sent to Juvenile House where he becomes shy and looses faith in himself. Meanwhile Lorry's friend, DJ Joki (Rana Daggubati) tries to get him out. It is then revealed that Zoey and Joki used to date each other long time. Zoey was interested in being an air hostess but fails. So Joki introduces her to his boss Lorsa Biscuta a.k.a. the Biscuit (Aditya Pancholi), who the is the boss of Drug dealing in Goa and has worldwide contacts. With the help of his contacts Biscuit gets her an international job in airlines. But she has to pay a price for this. Zoey will have to smuggle Cocaine to international regions five times. Unfortunately Zoey ends up being caught with 80 Lakhs of cocaine in her luggage and get punished for 14 years 
in jail. But Biscuit's contact gets her free in 14 days and for that she has to sleep with 

Biscuit. She then moves on breaking up with Joki and leads her life into drug dealing along with Biscuit. Meanwhile, Kamath carries on with the investigation on who is Michael Barbosa. It takes him to ship where he fights all the gangsters but misses out on Barbosa. This leads him no where.Sometime later Joki unexpectedly meets Zoey. He asks Zoey to help him out with Lorry. He tries his best to get Barbosa but fails. Zoey at first denies him and asks him to leave but finally Joki convinces her and they both end up sleeping together. Zoey helps him out by giving him a video recording of Biscuit announcing that he is going to throw a huge party in some jungle of Karnataka and at that party Michael Barbosa will be bringing all the drugs which he had with him and will be exchanged at the party. Joki gives this tape to ACP Kamath. Meanwhile, when Biscuit comes to know about the on going relationship between Zoey and Joki, he gets so furious that he kills her. Kamath gets his troops ready but in order to identify Barbosa he needs somebody's help and that somebody will be Lorry. He goes to Juvenile House and asks Lorry about Barbosa. Lorry is scared to answer and this fear makes matters much worse. So Kamath asks him to write down everything even the smallest of the small details about how he was trapped by Ricky into Drug smuggling, and with the help of that he will figure out who Michael Barbosa is. Kamath gets Lorry's Letter and then he attacks Biscuits party in Karnataka. He quickly reads out Lorry's letter and comes to the final conclusion of the entire Drug Racket. After arresting the Drug dealers and the gangsters. While returning back, Kamath's team mate asks him about Barbosa, he gives him lorry's letter and tells him Barbosa exists in that very letter. Kamath's team mate after reading the letter understands and asks for forgiveness. He then fires his gun 
and kills Kamath. It is then revealed that his teammate was always involved with Biscuit and the whole story fits in place. But still Michael Barbosa is the missing link. Later Joki finds out about Kamath's death and arrives at the crime scene. He finds a postcard next to Kamath's body. Joki then goes to the graveyard where Zoey was cremated and all of a sudden it clicks and he solves the entire mystery. He notices a grave named 'Micheal Barbosa'. Then he remembers Kamath telling him about Barbosa already being dead. He realizes that Barbosa is just a dead name used for channelising the supply of drugs and misleading the cops. He goes there and opens the grave and finds packets of cocaine, heroine and other drugs. he then calls up Biscuit and says that if he wants his drugs back then he will have to clear all the records of his and Lorry's. Later he calls up Kamath's killer and team mate and asks him to come with him to a spot where he has hid all the packets of drugs. Joki takes him to the same place where Kamath was murdered and kills him there too. He says that he came to know about him because of Kamath's postcard where Kamath had written his name in order for Joki to complete his mission. 

Joki burns the drugs along with Kamath's body in Biscuit's crematorium. And, in the end Biscuit is killed by a girl who he is sleeping with.
