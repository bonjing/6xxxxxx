SUMMARY:
A retired special agent named John Matrix led an elite unit and has left 
the armed forces to live in a secluded mountain home with his daughter Jenny. 
But now he is forced out of retirement when his daughter is kidnapped by a 
band of thugs intent on revenge! Unbeknownst to Matrix, the members of his 
former unit are being killed one by one. Even though Matrix' friend 
General Franklin Kirby gives Matrix armed guards, attackers manage to 
kidnap Matrix and Jenny. Matrix learns that Bennett, a former member 
of his Matrix' unit who was presumed dead has kidnapped him to try to 
force Matrix to do a political assassination for a man called Arius 
(who calls himself El Presidente), a warlord formerly bested by Matrix 
who wishes to lead a military coup in his home country. 
Since Arius will have Jenny killed if Matrix refuses, 
Matrix reluctantly accepts the demand.
