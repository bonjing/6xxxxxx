Steve Forbert: Guitar & Vocals
Agnes ""Sis"" Cunningham: Guitar & Vocals
Gordon Friesen: Guitar & Vocals

Here is an interesting snapshot of an up and coming artist, recorded for the New York Folk magazine ""Broadside"" before the release of Steve Forbert's first LP ""Alive On Arrival"". The magazine was devoted to publishing the leading folksingers of the folk revival as well as up and coming folk artists new to ths scene.
This tape was recorded live in the studio using what sounds like a single mic positioned near the preformers. The recording itself features Steve and
""Broadside"" publisher Sis Cunningham and her husband Gordon Friesen. The first 4 songs are Steve doing 3 originals and 1 cover tune, the balance feature Sis Cunningham on vocals with Steve on guitar and duets with Sis and Steve.
There is one very telling discussion showing Steve was just a small town Mississippi boy in the big city about Wavy Gravy and his Merry Pranksters and the fact that Steve doesn't know who he is and had never heard of him.

A great snaphot of a moment in time indeed... "
