,Grimm6Jack,2011-07-16T12:11Z,"Guy's please seed, this is the best torrent available here in One Piece, almost 500 episodes in just less than 30 Gb.

PLEASE SEED. I want this by tomorrow or the day after.

(started downloading yesterday)"
,hehehehehehe,2011-07-21T09:15Z,Personally it took 5-6 days until i got it.And I will seed.:)
,xhizors,2011-08-10T09:49Z,"overall it's very watchable, BUT the subtitles are all mixed up (different groups) Which sucks, because well, a) ADC-HEAVEN and ODEUS are AWFUL and completely RUIN the mood with their HORRIBLE translations, the kaizoku subs are awesome... shame they're not all kaizoku..."
,xhizors,2011-08-10T11:58Z,"and no i'm not a fanboy. ive never heard of any of these fansubs until i started watching this torrent, so rest assured me stating how awful some of them are, is the honest truth, the translation and grammar is atrocious! ADC-HEAVEN/ANIME-ELITES (LOL) leaves out words and names in translation, they write ""Galley"" as ""Gallery"" and ""Car"" as ""Cart"", Enies as Enes, and overall ruin the mood that the original japanese writers are trying so hard to set...  and sure, you can ""get"" what they're saying, but there was one part where a Robin said *MINOR SPOILER* something like ""my only motive is to get the strawhats off the island, minus me."" but they wrote it as ""my only request is to get all 6 of the strawhats off the island, including luffy"" what the fuck is that? anyway, the whole point to this is because i can't find a way to contact them, so ANIME-ELITES (LOL!!!!!!!!!) and ADC-HEAVEN, and DEOUS, SHOWTIME, TAKA-SAN, LaZiE JeNnY and any other moron that i missed that had anything to do with the writing, you're a bunch of idiots and a six year old deaf, dumb, and blind kid could do a better job than you. it's garbage. don't ever, ever, EVER subtitle another anime, ever."
,hehehehehehe,2011-08-12T17:16Z,"@xhizors

,TheRealSneakers,2011-08-31T22:11Z,"So far so good...am up to 340, and just dl 10 at a time, paced out, due to being on a fixed bandwidth, which cause me to go over (Among watching online videos which were HD). Thankfully...I only started at 206, the next episode where funimation's DVDs left off. I hope to see episodes 496 and up posted by themanual08, but whenever they can. 

I do try to keep my program on as long as I can to help seed them out. Thanks to themanual08 for posting the episodes."
