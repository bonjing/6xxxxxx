Release date Fraps v3.4.0.13130: 29th Mar 2011


Fraps (from "Frames per second") is a universal benchmarking, screen capture, 
and real-time video capture Windows application that can be used with games 
using DirectX or OpenGL graphic technology. It is commonly used to determine 
a computer's performance with a game, as well as record gaming footage. 

The program is very popular in the making of amateur machinima films.
Fraps can take screenshots in various formats: BMP, TGA, JPEG, and PNG. 
(However, only the BMP format is available in the freeware version.) 

In its current form Fraps performs many tasks and can best be described as:
- Realtime Video Capture Software - Have you ever wanted to record video while 
  playing your favourite game? Come join the Machinima revolution! Throw away 
  the VCR, forget about using a DV cam, game recording has never been this easy! 
  Fraps can capture audio and video up to 2560x1600 with custom frame rates from 
  10 to 100 frames per second! 
- Benchmarking Software - Show how many Frames Per Second (FPS) you are getting 
  in a corner of your screen. Perform custom benchmarks and measure the frame 
  rate between any two points. Save the statistics out to disk and use them for 
  your own reviews and applications.
- Screen Capture Software - Take a screenshot with the press of a key! 
  There's no need to paste into a paint program every time you want a new shot. 
  Your screen captures are automatically named and timestamped.

The lossless Fraps codec allows decoding of Fraps-encoded videos (using a media 
player capable of decoding the AVI container format) or transcoding to other 
video formats (with the use of the right software). The Fraps video codec manages 
to capture videos with minimal impact on game performance, as it has been 
optimized to achieve compression higher than uncompressed RGB, resulting in 
smaller filesizes, though the lossless format is considerably less space-efficient 
than more heavily compressed lossy video formats such as DivX. This is because 
encoding on-the-fly to a high-compression format such as DivX would have a large 
negative impact on game performance (as of 2007) and only a very fast hard drive 
could record the immense amount of data produced in using uncompressed video. 
The Fraps format is a compromise of the two.

Fraps 3 - New features and a new look!  
- Fraps is now compatible with Windows 7 and the latest DirectX 11 games.
- Ventrilo & TeamSpeak users have long wanted a way to record their microphone 
  and speakers at the same time.  
- For Windows 7 and Vista we've added realtime sound mixing to our video recording 
  so you can now capture both sides of the conversation!

NVIDIA have recently included stereoscopic 3D support directly into their drivers. 
If you play your DirectX9 (D3D9) game with 3D Vision enabled you can use Fraps to
record the game in full 3D too!  You'll get a side-by-side stereo AVI recording 
that you can drop straight in to a stereoscopic 3D player!

Finally, we are aware that more and more people are putting Fraps to professional 
use. We've added a new option to force lossless RGB compression to ensure that you 
always have the highest quality video output to work with.
