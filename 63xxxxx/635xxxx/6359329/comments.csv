,arhistonion,2012-01-26T21:19Z,Does anybody know if there was a DVD release of the 125-minute theatrical version?
,erroneus,2012-03-20T02:18Z,This is nice but the speed of the video and audio are too fast.  How can I adjust them down to normal?
,xjd77,2012-04-30T01:51Z,"Absolutely fine. Played with VLC - the best player for mkv files. Picture had no pixel squaring and the audio was spot on. I didn't download the AC3 files for other languages so can't say anything about those. This is a good rip - thanks to the uploader.

If you've never seen this but like The Last Samurai (Tom Cruise) then try this. Filmed entirely in Japan. "
