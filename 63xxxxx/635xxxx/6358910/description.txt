Release Notes

Is the altitude correct? Which plane can stay in the air longer? What
direction are other planes coming from and is a collision likely? You
are in control. Land all types of airplane on your airport, until
there are no more incoming flights.

As Air Traffic Controller you will experience the stress, the hectic
pace and the satisfaction of landing all of your planes as safely and
as quickly as possible. Avoiding collisions at all times, direct
planes to their correct landing path and runway, while monitoring
their fuel load closely. Your results will be strictly monitored, a
score attributed and new airports unlocked  but any accident will
result in your immediate firing.
