Directed by Barbet Schroeder. Starring Mickey Rourke, Faye Dunaway, Alice Krige.

NOTE: One of best movies I have ever seen. Watched in cinema some twenty years ago, but it is one "etched" in my mind. Barfly is the delightfully gritty tale of a warrior poet (Rourke) disguised as a drunken idiot who lives in a roach motel and, a drunk who can never pay his bar tab. Mickey Rourke shines in the lead role and in my opinion deserved an Oscar for his brilliant performance. Faye Dunaway also gives a great performance as Mick's love interest. Rourke creates a cult icon that will keep you in stitches and riveted for the duration of the film. You'll talk about this movie long after viewing it.
