Neighbours from Hell 2 on Vacation

The neighbor from hell wants to enjoy an undeserved holiday â€“ reason enough for Woody and the camera team to sneak along onto the cruise liner to make the nasty neighbour's holiday a living hell. This time, the neighbor's mum has joined him, and she is taking good care of her baby. Get the neighbor from hell into his mum's and fellow travelers' bad books, play tricks on him and give free reign to your vengeance.
