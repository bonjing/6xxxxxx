Thank you kindly for downloading. Obviously, something went wrong on your computer, or with your connection. We always strive to give the best possible quality, whether it comes to the video/audio quality, the download speeds, or whatever.

Did you download the torrent completely? As in 100%? If so, you'll need a player capable of handling Matroshka files, VLC par example.

If you still encounter errors, please let us know, we'll work something out!"
