The KLF, which stands for Kallisti Liberation Front (also known as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, The Timelords and other names) were one of the seminal bands of the British acid house movement during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Beginning in 1987, Bill Drummond (alias King Boy D) and Jimmy Cauty (alias Rockman Rock) released hip hop-inspired and sample-heavy records as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, and on one occasion (the British number one hit single "Doctorin' the Tardis") as The Timelords. As The KLF, Drummond and Cauty pioneered the genres "stadium house" (rave music with a pop-rock production and sampled crowd noise) and "ambient house[citation needed]. The KLF released a series of international top-ten hits[citation needed] on their own KLF Communications record label, and became the biggest-selling singles act in the world for 1991[citation needed] The duo also published a book, The Manual, and worked on a road movie called The White Room.

While Drummond and Cauty as the KLF "had been around for many years with only moderate underground success, however, their fortunes turned upward when they decided to collaborate with several vocalists (P.P. Arnold, Maxine Harvey, Samantha Brown, etc.), rappers & Wanda as a lead singer, lyricist & sensuous centrepiece of their acclaimed songs & video presentations, throughout the 90's. The result was a multimillion selling album."[5] Wanda Dee as lead vocalist on most of their top ten hits and videos was of key importance to this.
