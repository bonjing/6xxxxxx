I created a account just now to vent because I seed the hell out of the things that I download on here and am sick and tired of being one of the few who actually seeds anymore!!

I pray TPB institutes some policy ridding this site of those who don't seed. 4 FUCKING SEEDED!!!! WTF....greedy pricks!"

YAY.....This shit makes me not even want to seed myself, nobody else does, why should I....but noooooooo, I'll seed per the usual, but wish I could pick who I seed it to, so you fucking leeches wouldn't get shit from me"
,the-dude1982,2011-05-02T22:43Z,"Dude WTF is wrong with the file itself?

,adamt1975,2011-05-03T01:13Z,"OK, what gives. The last 3 AVI files I've downloaded...UFC 129 and WWE Extreme Rules...All AVI, will NOT play on my Xbox 360 like they have for years. 

On Top of that....when I view this and the other 2 recent downloads on my cpu Divx Player, the video is flawless, perfect clear...but sound isn't worth 2 cents...It sounds like I'm receiving some Alien Radio Broadcast to Earth...WTF?"

This is not worth a download.  At first glance I thought the file extension was incorrectly named .avi, that it was actually a flash file ripped off of Youtube.  It's not.  The video may be 624x352, but it looks as if the video source was originally 150x100 and just stretched to that size.

The audio is BEYOND HORRIBLE.  This is easily the worst audio I have ever heard on a torrent.  It's so bad that the audio detracts from the experience; it is actually more watchable if you mute the sound.  Otherwise, the audio stutters every 1.1 seconds, clicks and pops constantly, and is of such low quality that you can't make out what is being said much of the time when it's not being all fucked up.

This file was tested on a laptop and desktop running Windows 7 with the proper codecs, a desktop running Ubuntu Linux 10.04 with the proper codecs, streamed over the network to my internet enabled HDTV, and played from a USB drive on the TV (no network used).  The only answer is that this file is absolutely not worth downloading.

Go elsewhere, this is so bad it should be tossed off Pirate Bay."
