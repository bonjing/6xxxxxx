Release Info:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SBK 2011 will feature a brand new artistic direction, an up-to-date driving
model to meet the gamers expectations following the most accurate feedback
collected so far on the web, as well as a more appealing presentation and
side effects, due to an overall enhancement of the whole visual impact
(menus, environments, 3D objects, lighting effects and much, much more).
A simple side-by-side comparison with SBK X will allow the major
improvements to stand out. As regards to the official content available
on launch day, SBK 2011 will deliver the entire official package of the
next Championship Season: all classes, featuring 9 bike manufacturers,
70 riders and 16 tracks from the 2011 season.
