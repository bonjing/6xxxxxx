                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Presented by Dr Christian Jessen and Anna Richardson (journalist), this brand 
 new series of "Supersize vs Superskinny" looks at what happens when people    
 with contrasting diet habits swap their diet and lifestyle for a week. From a 
 superskinny, under-eater to an overweight, over-eater, their lives will be    
 turned upside down during the swap, being forced to live the way the other    
 person does in an attempt to prove to them that they both have a dysfunctional
 relationship with food  that eating too much is just as bad as under-eating. 
                                                                               
 Will "Supersize vs Superskinny" kick start a whole new regime of balanced and 
 healthy eating, transforming their relationship with food and weight or will  
 it just encourage them to revert back to their old eating habits              
                                 Enjoy!
