"Mother's Day"

Claire and Gloria want to spend a nice 
Mother's Day outdoors hiking with the kids, 
but their nonstop bickering and complaining 
drives Claire to the edge, and she brings 
Gloria down with her. Meanwhile, Phil and 
Jay stay home to cook everyone a nice dinner, 
but things get really awkward when Phil 
witnesses an unexpected moment of weakness 
from Jay, and Cameron gets very self-
conscious about being seen as the "mother" 
in the relationship.

Enjoy :)
