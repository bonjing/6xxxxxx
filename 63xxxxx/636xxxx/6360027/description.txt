A brutal, violent, and uncompromising look at the American old west:

Cast: Gary Cooper  -  Link Jones
        Julie London -  Billie Ellis
        Lee J. Cobb -  Dock Tobin

PLOT: Anthony Mann\'s final foray into the western genre is a disturbing examination of man\'s baser instincts, rising in intensity to the level of Shakespearean tragedy. The film begins as seemingly naive Link (Gary Cooper) leaves his family to take a train to Fort Worth. Also on the train is saloon singer Billie Ellis (Julie London), who is compelled by con man Sam Beasley (Arthur O\'Connell) to cheat Link out of his money. But the con comes to naught when the nefarious Dock Tobin (Lee J. Cobb) and his gang rob the train....

Jean-Luc Godard wrote a review of Man of the West when it came out, describing \"the delightful farm nestling amid the greenery which George Eliot would have loved.\" If he\'d written his review two years later he might have no less aptly connected the ghost town to the modernism of Michelangelo Antonioni\'s L\'avventura. His view of Mann merged image and idea, classical and modern: \"Just as the director of The Birth of a Nation gave one the impression that he was inventing the cinema with every shot, each shot of Man of the West gives one the impression that Anthony Mann is reinventing the western, exactly as Matisse\'s portraits reinvent the features of Piero della Francesca. . . . In other words, he both shows and demonstrates, innovates and copies, criticizes and creates.\"
