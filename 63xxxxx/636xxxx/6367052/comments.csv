before seeing this i was not aware of that kind of so called social creatures exist in our country,specially in northern India.At the end of d movie,there was a special twist,i love to see it,the baby was born not a masculine child,she was a feminine.and it created d beginning of another circle.a must watch for every one,many thanks SIRJI once again."
