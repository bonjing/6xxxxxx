Ratchet reports that his scans have located the Decepticon warship while experimenting with different frequencies. 
Arcee thinks they should strike now, but Ratchet says he's also detected an Autobot emergency beacon, 
and Optimus Prime decides they should check that out first. He and Ratchet arrive at a centuries-old crashed Autobot ship 
and venture inside. Though they expect there may be survivors, they find the crew has succumbed to Cybonic Plague. 
As the ship shifts, a deceased Autobot hanging from the ceiling drips plague-imbued Energon onto Optimus. 
Later at base, Optimus lays stricken while the others discuss the situation. The Cybonic Plague was developed by 
Megatron and Ratchet thinks they might be able to find information in the Decepticon databases. 
Arcee and Bumblebee Groundbridge onto the Nemesis and, narrowly hiding from Knock Out, enter the ship's lab. 
Inside, Arcee scours the database, but fails to find a cure for the Cybonic Plague. 
While she's doing so, Bumblebee stumbles on Megatron's comatose form. Arcee is ready to finish Megatron off then and there, 
but Ratchet has a better idea â€” enter Megatron's mind and retrieve the plague cure. 
Ratchet knows of a procedure to create a cortical psychic patch. Though such procedures have been banned by the Autobots for years, 
it will get them into Megatron's mind, and Bumblebee is willing to try it. On the ship's bridge, 
Starscream complains that the ship's electromagnetic shielding has not been fixed, and directs the Vehicons to hurry up 
and do so before the Autobots detect them. Afterwards Starscream has a private word with Knock Out, 
suggesting that the Decepticons deserve a leader who is conscious, and the pair come to an understanding whereby Knock Out 
will be Starscream's new second-in-command. Meanwhile, Arcee plugs Bumblebee into Megatron, and Bumblebee finds himself in a simulation of Kaon. 
Ratchet creates a communications downlink, so they can monitor what Bumblebee is doing. Bumblebee wanders though Kaon until 
he finds what appears to be Optimus, but is just a figment of Megaton's imagination. Megatron appears and slays the false Optimus, 
who dissolves into smoke. Another Optimus appears, and as Megatron fires his fusion cannon, Bumblebee jumps in the path of the blast, 
only to find it passes right through him to slay the imaginary Optimus. Megatron, however, has seen Bumblebee and attempts to strike him, 
but his blows pass clean through Bumblebee. While Megatron is trying to work out what's going on, Optimus, Bulkhead and another Bumblebee appear, 
all figments of his imagination. Megatron destroys them, but begins to realize that he's in his own subconscious. 
Arcee becomes anxious when Starscream, Knock Out and Soundwave enter the lab, though the 2 Autobots are hidden well enough that 
the Decepticons don't see them. Starscream is determined to put on a show for Soundwave, to convince his fellow Decepticon that 
Megatron is beyond saving. He and Knock Out attempt to persuade Soundwave that putting Megatron out of his misery is the best thing. 
Arcee and Ratchet overhear their conversation, and Ratchet says terminating Megatron will permanently separate Bumblebee's mind and body. 
In the dream world, Megatron ponders what has happened to him, and finds out from Bumblebee about the space bridge explosion. Short on time, 
Bumblebee relays the news about Optimus's Cybonic Plague infection. Megatron is amused that after all this time Optimus will be felled by a virus, 
but Bumblebee plays on his desire to finish Optimus himself. Starscream is about to pull the plug on Megatron when Soundwave points out 
the psychic patch cable. Starscream begins following it, as Arcee observes from her hiding place. Megatron briefly shows Bumblebee the formula 
for the virus cure, but will only share it if Bumblebee can release him from his mental prison. Unknown to Megatron, 
Ratchet can still see everything Bumblebee sees. Having ganked the formula, Ratchet tells Arcee to cut the link. 
Megatron's dream world begins to disintegrate and the Decepticon leader launches himself at the disappearing Bumblebee. 
Bumblebee then comes around as Starscream finds the 2 hidden Autobots, and, as they escape through the Groundbridge, 
Arcee blasts one of the cables attached to Megatron. Starscream is actually pleased that Megatron has flatlined as a result, 
but at Soundwave's insistence has Knock Out reconnect the cable. As Optimus is cured, the Autobots celebrate, 
but Optimus insists the celebration should be for Ratchet and Bumblebee. On the Nemesis, Knock Out observes that Megatron is no longer 
exhibiting any brainwave activity â€” there's no one home. Unknown to anyone, Megatron resides in Bumblebee's head.
