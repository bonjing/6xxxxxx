[V],GoodFilms,2011-05-06T14:34Z,"it's not about the size, it's the bitrate. 4000kbps video - which is enough even for live action films - is plenty for animated films.

@yidaki. You are a dick, and you are wrong."

,Martinsolberg1,2011-06-05T15:33Z,"It seems that this one, and the ''I Am Number Four''-Movie can't be played on my Samsung TV, I'm using a Harddrive and the MediaPlay-function on the TV. The only difference i've found is that Tag, ''BLOW''. Is BLOW an uploader within Extremezone, or r extremezone one guy? 
The other MKV files i have plays just great :S 
Help... Anyone?"
,Martinsolberg1,2011-06-05T15:35Z,"Well... BLOW shouldn't be an uploader... I admit that sounds kinda stupid after having had some thinking. Could anyone explain to me what BLOW is?
Thanks :)"
