A must-see for anyone intrigued by the sport of breath-hold freediving. In this independent film, Freediver Max Avery (Justin Flint Williford) journeys to his inner-most depths as he pursues competitive freediving as a relief from a chronic lung disease. Yet his passion for the extreme sport is widening a rift between him and his father (Mark Brunetti), a physician, who fears his son's risky descents will cost him his life. As Max trains for a world record attempt, he must convince his father that freediving is the key to finding freedom from his disease.
