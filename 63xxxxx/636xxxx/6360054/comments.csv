,apljax3,2011-05-02T15:17Z,"It starts off 3/4 screen but seems to correct itself. Also in the very beginning the bottom cuts off but that corrects itself also. There's subtitles as well, and I can't seem to get them to go away."

The picture and sound are great though, especially considering this is a new torrent and the movie was just released Friday."

,Doliko,2011-05-04T17:36Z,ok i know it might be difficult to find a DVDSCR but will someone find one? PLEASE!!!!! i hate camrips...the quality is just too crappy!
,kaduzy,2011-05-05T02:31Z,"This is a horrible copy!  The camera is out of focus in many places and jerks around, making only portions of the screen visible during key scenes, or cutting people's heads off.  Every time the screen goes black the picture gets grainy.  And worst of all, I only downloaded this because I saw the movie in a country where the subtitles weren't available in English, and I wanted to know what the Brazilian characters were saying.  You can't even read many of the subtitles because of camera problems!  Also, the color is terrible.  So forget about this shitty copy and wait for a DVD rip."
,TWebb05,2011-05-05T04:32Z,This is the best upload so far. A6 V5. Thanks greatmagician

,Riftweaver81,2011-06-23T04:36Z,Grand-Grimoire you are full of it... a 10/10 would be perfectly clear audio and visuals. those are impossible to do from any cam version.  10/10's would be dvd quality
