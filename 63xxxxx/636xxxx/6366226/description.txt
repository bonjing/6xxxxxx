Full-power task management doesnâ€™t mean hard-to-use

TaskSurfer gives you all of the tools you need to manage things the way you want. Stick things in folders, use contexts to decide where and when to work on stuff, or tag it with a location and let your Mac sort it out for you. Go crazy with tags and use the Tag Browser to keep it sane. Because TaskSurfer is written on top of core Mac OS X technologies, youâ€™ll be up and running right out of the box.


Cloud Syncing

If weâ€™re going to spend time in front of a computer, weâ€™d rather spend it in front of our Macs. But thatâ€™s not always possible, and thatâ€™s why TaskSurfer synchronizes your tasks to Toodledo, the web-based task management service. If you donâ€™t get to use a Mac at work or on the road, you can access your tasks from any web browser.


No lock-in

Many popular iPhone and iPad task management applications sync with Toodledo (including Two Dogsâ€™ own forthcoming iPhone/iPad apps), so youâ€™re not locked into someone elseâ€™s idea of what mobile task management should be.


Full of Snow Leopard goodness

TaskSurfer takes advantage of the good things in Mac OS X Snow Leopard, like 64-bit processing to use all the power of your Mac, and Core Location so that your Mac knows where you are.

Feature Overview

Synchronize your tasks with Toodledo to keep Macs synchronized at home and office, and access to your tasks even when youâ€™re not in front of your Mac.

Tags - 

keep your tasks organized the way that works for you.

With the Tag Browser, itâ€™s easy to view your tagged tasks any way you want.

Location-based Contexts - using Snow Leopardâ€™s Core Location services, your Mac knows where youâ€™re what and what tasks you should be working on.

Pasted Graphic Accessible - written and tested to support VoiceOver.

Smart Folders let you bucket your tasks by common attributes. 

All of your high priority tasks for that big project that are due next week but donâ€™t start until Tuesday? Smart folders have you covered. 
Tell TaskSurfer what to collect, and the smart folders do the rest automatically and behind the scenes.

Folders can contain tasks for projects, people, or what ever you want.

Contexts show what you should work on where ever you might be, whether near a computer, on the bus, or by the phone.
