"History accounts and travels of many kinds: travels in time, places and, most of all, within our soul.

This film is a beautifully scorching experience. It hurts to be human.

One key word comes to mind : Love: the catalyst of Life. Love of every form and degree.

The full array of human emotions are always present in Monsieur Lelouche's films. The seemingly "evil" in us, the "worst" in humanity can be transformed.

Often unnoticed details, short moments, may very well have a powerful impact on a person's destiny.

Life in cycles, the great story that never ends.

We come to this world and...

...we love, we hate, we suffer, we doubt, we hope, we despair, we sin, we forgive, we win, we lose, we learn, we love again...

as the great Tennyson wrote : " 'tis better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all"
