The MisterMusic Show episode  148    (2 hours 1 min)

The MisterMusic Show is broadcast globally every Sunday on radiogetswildDOTcom 

The first quarter of the year has passed. Man, time flies!!! 
I break from the usual format on this week's show- and feature only songs released in the past 4 months. It is a great opportunity to pause now, and reflect on some of the recent stuff that has come out in 2011.

Indie, Alternative & Rock that includes songs by: Gorillaz, Cut Copy, Cake, Lykke Li, High Highs, The Antlers, Foo Fighters, Metronomy, The National, Elbow, Beady Eye, Arctic Monkeys, The Kills, The Raveonettes, Peter, Bjorn & John, The One AM Radio, Oregon Bike Trails, The Cars, The Strokes...and more!
