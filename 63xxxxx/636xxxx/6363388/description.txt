When night falls, the streets belong to the bad guys. They are looking for a lone passerby to mug, and perhaps knock out a couple teeth for good measure. The townspeople live in fear of the dark streets. Well, not everyone. Meet Severe Jack - big tough guy who is not afraid to kick some bad guy ass. Today he came out of the sports arena and discovered that someone had stolen his car. That was the last straw. Severe Jack is going hunting.
Here is a nice example of a very rare game genre on the PC â€“ beat 'em up. The game was made in the best traditions of street fight platformers. Clear the levels, retaking the street from the bad guys, using only your fists. Lots of fighting moves - combos, airstrikes, and throws. Lively music and dynamic gameplay!
