Meat Loaf played in Flushing Meadows on June 26th, 1988 at the Queens Day Festival. In a relative short concert Meat Loaf and the Neverland Express performed 7 great songs. The video isn't the greatest quality and at parts it's a bit dark. The sound is almost decent. There is a constant hiss in the audio but it's very listenable. The audio is Mono and the video has a few small cuts in between songs. The show is entertaining enough and Meat Loaf's voice sounds terrific. All in all this is a DVD to enjoy.
