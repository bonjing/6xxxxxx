Storyline:Celebrating his impending marriage to Tracy (Sasha Barrese), Doug (Justin Bartha) and his friends Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Tracy's brother Alan (Zach Galifianakis) travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party, staying at Caesars Palace. As night falls, the four friends share drinks and toast to a night they will never forget.
The following morning, Phil, Stu and Alan awaken to find they have no memory of the previous night and Doug is nowhere to be found. They discover that Stu is missing a tooth, their villa is a shambles, a tiger is in their bathroom and a baby is in the closet. Searching for Doug they find his mattress impaled on a statue outside of their hotel and the valet brings them a police cruiser instead of their Mercedes. Using clues to retrace their steps, the trio travel to a hospital where they discover they were roofied, causing their memory loss and that they came to the hospital from a Chapel. At the chapel they learn that Stu married a stripper named Jade (Heather Graham) despite having a long-term but mean-spirited girlfriend, Melissa (Rachael Harris). Outside the chapel, the trio are attacked by gangsters but escape, visiting Jade who they discover to be the mother of the baby. While in Jade's apartment, the trio are arrested by two police officers for stealing the police car. The police explain that they found the Mercedes and release the trio in exchange for them volunteering to be targets for a taser demonstration. While driving the Mercedes, they discover a naked man (Ken Jeong) in the trunk who proceeds to attack them with a crowbar before running away. Alan admits to being the person who put roofies in their drinks to ensure they had a good night, believing them to be Ecstacy.
