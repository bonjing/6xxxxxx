If ever a group's name were wrapped in florid irony, it's surely that of the Thorns. The Thorns is a bright, buoyant summit meeting of contemporary popmeisters Matthew Sweet, Shawn Mullins and Pete Droge. Backed by an all-star studio ensemble that includes Jim Keltner, Greg Leisz, Brendan O'Brien and Roy Bittan, the three nominally insulated musicians do more than claim the legacy of Crosby, Stills & Nash on the harmonic riches of "Think It Over" and the glorious "Now I Know". (It's equally hard to imagine the baby-boom icons wrapping themselves around the chunky funk of the title track here or the pointed impressionistic allegory of "Dragonfly".) They also find a musical common ground that can't help but echo history in its folk-rooted vocal glories yet forges an ego-sublimating higher ground that's anything but nostalgic. Fans of the three musicians may recognise their various sensibilities at work throughout, but this is a rewarding collaboration that virtually defies deconstruction. Don't be misled by the name--this is a beautiful, accessible, musically fragrant bouquet.
