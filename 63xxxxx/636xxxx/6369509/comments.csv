,EastLink,2011-06-04T01:47Z,"The RIAA jacked up this torrent too it seems. The calls are either 5 seconds long or something completely different. If anyone can get this thing sorted out so we all can get an honest version, that would be appreciated.
The RIAA is a big bunch of greedy commies who love to ruin every piece of technology we enjoy. Ill bet whoever works fro the RIAA and is seeding these BS versions of this torrent is some gay guy with aids who love to sit on the top of his giant pile of money and jack off all day long. And of course he has no problem with hijacking torrents and ruining them to make that pile just an inch higher."

Upgrade to the newest version of uTurrent and it sets this by default otherwise simply uninstall uTorrent then reinstall the latest version. That will block the RIAA or who ever it is that may be seeding blank files. Thanks for sharing this torrent ArkansasDJ and keep seeding your good packets. ; )"
,EastLink,2011-06-27T08:17Z,I am using ÂľTorrent 3.0 (which should have the hash check) and I use the force re check but it still downloads bad files.
