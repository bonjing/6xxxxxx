The RIAA posted some fucking blank files so I got tired of wasting my time and bandwidth. My hard drive crashed and I lost all my MP3s so I just went ahead and re-encoded MP3s from my CDs.  And Im even adding the 5th album, which was off of Amazon (because they dont even sell the CD).  Since I got these from the MP3 download, they are the only files that have title, bit rate and other property details. It took me like 3 days and I labled the tracks so its all easy to know when its all organized right. Donâ€™t bother wasting your time with the others (seeded from 2009). Download from me for the REAL DEAL!!!!!!!!   

PS: And if anybody has Willie P Richardson please post a torrent as I would sure like to hear those calls.
