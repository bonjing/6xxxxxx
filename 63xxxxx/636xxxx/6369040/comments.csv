,Daniel963,2011-05-06T23:55Z,OK after bout 20 minutes downloaded vlc playa got it  working whys everyone gotta make things difficult not like I'm not thankful or anything just could have been easier I'll seed this for a while ;D    
,BubiMandril,2011-05-08T16:34Z,"Good upload. The movie works good except the thumbnail takes 2-3 minutes to load and then when the loading bar is full nothing happens, it never loads the thumbnail. All the other mkv's i have load fine. Only this one is giving my trouble, and it makes my computer go all retarded, it slows down like the CPU is at 100% all the time until i restart then it goes back to normal. But every time i go into the folder where the file is my computer goes stupid. Anyone have a solution. If not I'll just delete it after i watch it because it is really annoying."
,R3veNG,2011-05-10T23:33Z,"Great quality upload, thx! VLC played it nicely, as expected :-).

Also, not that bad of a movie either: sci-fi feat. nice ladies ;-)."

,sqlife,2011-05-29T20:34Z,"Rule of thumb before you post problem comments:

- Won't play! > Use VLC player

I'm thinking Piratebay should have that as a sticky on all video torrents because I swear that problem is repetitively an issue. "
,brum4884,2011-06-04T13:48Z,"@BubiMandril
