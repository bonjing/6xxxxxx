Notes:

 - I did find this movie torrented elsewhere and would have mirrored it, but I wasn't happy with the quality, so this is a new encoding of it

 - To use the subtitles, if necessary, simply extract the .SUB file from the .RAR archive into the same folder. A free app. that will extract .RAR archives is 7-Zip from http://www.7-zip.org/

 - I seed using "Initial Seeding" which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for up to several days until there are enough other seeds.
 
 - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to at least 101%, no torrent would ever die.
