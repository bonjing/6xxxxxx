Unlike previous Jean Michel Jarre compilation albums, this one isn't just a collection of separate tracks. Instead, Jarre blended all tracks together into a single mix and thus creating an audio adventure through his work to date. Apart from Jarre's best known tracks the album also contains two previously unreleased tracks composed for the canceled Teotihuacan solar eclipse concert scheduled for July 11, 1991, one rare track as well as three new versions of older work. A must-have.
