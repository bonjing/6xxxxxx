This version is a Blue Ray Rip - 1280 x 528 resolution.

The original had DTS audio and hard-coded English subtitles, which seemed stupid since the audio is in English. DTS audio will typically NOT play on TVs that allow movies to be played directly from a flash drive or hard drive.

So I ripped out the subtitles and converted the sound so it will now play on a USB-compatible TV

File size is only 1.35GB. Great quality, or I would not be seeding...

One last thought - please help seed when you can - this is a very nice hi-def quality yet small file-size version...

BUT, I only have an internet connection which is leeched from a neighbor (wi-fi) so connection sometimes drops. I will seed as best I can until some of you guys with permanent connections can also seed. Thanks...
