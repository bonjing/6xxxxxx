This is the missed track from the Lee Perry Dub syndicate torrent.
 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6366371/Lee_Scratch_Perry__amp__Dub_Syndicate_Time_Boom_X_De_Devil_Dead

Labelled wrongly track 9 on that torrent was in fact Introducing Myself from the album Battle Of Armagideon (Millionaire Liquidator), 1986 album on the Trojen label TRLS 227.

Apologies for any confusion.
