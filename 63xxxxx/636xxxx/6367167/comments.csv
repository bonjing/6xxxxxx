A/8
V/8
The picture slightly grainy and the audio is a bit on the low side, but apart from that this copy is Great.
It's in the usual 4:3 format, but the picture does seem to play a bit more like a 16:9...
Many Thanx to IwannaFan2 and IFLIX for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"

The video kept lagging and skipping for me, and the audio would fall out of sync now and then. But it eventually fix'd itself. It is still enjoyable. Thanks for the upload."
,Rosechu,2011-05-09T00:19Z,"Decent video quality, very watchable.  It's a little quiet but if you don't want to pay to see it and can't wait for the dvd it's a good copy.
