We have monstrously rare sitar-funk on Anandar Shankar, the obscure Tina Britt's take of Don Covoy's "Sookie, Sookie" and the latin jazz extravaganza of Norman Connor's "Samba For Maria" featuring Blue Note mainstay Freddie Hubbard on trumpet. 
For those amused by the quirky, the presence of Cliff Richard is around with Shadow's drummer Brian Bennett, whose "Soul Mission" is lifted from his incredibly rare "Greater London Noise" LP. At the other end of the scale we have a million seller albeit as a Î’ side - in Bobby Gentry's Memphis soaked "Mississippi Delta"
