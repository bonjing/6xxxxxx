BONUS-KISS 70's doll commercial

This is a collection of flash videos I gathered from YouTube.
The original VHS copy was broken into 17 parts (1 for each song).
I joined them all together into one file.
I recommend Real Player or Adobe Flash player...VLC media player doesn't work for some reason.
The video plays fine if you watch it from start to finish, but if you skip around,
it may act as if corrupted- IT IS NOT- just go back to the previous song's end and play through
to the start of the song you are skipping to.

The quality is decent, considering it comes from a tape copy of a 1977 professionally recorded concert.
I believe KISS intended on releasing this at the time but never did.
This tour is the one KISS released live as KISS ALIVE II.

This is KISS at their highpoint back in the day. 
It remains to be one of their best stage sets that they base their modern stages off of today.

Please seed this for the hardcore KISS fans!

Enjoy~ Bakura2
