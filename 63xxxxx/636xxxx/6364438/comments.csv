It sounds like you were using VLC media player, that is exactly what happened to me when I used it to play this video, that is why I stated in the description above ""I recommend Real Player or Adobe Flash player...VLC media player doesn't work for some reason.""

Just use another media player....and read the descriptions before you complain next time.

To everyone else, the video is good, it plays fine if you use one of the free media players suggested above.
Please seed. 
If you still have problems.... as I said, these were collected from youtube and I pieced them together to form the entire show...just go there and watch them individually."
,beest666,2011-06-30T15:20Z,yoyoyo bakura2 sorry for my late response but i didnt use the vlc player i used the gom player and my normal windows media player and both gave me the same problem but i will download your file again (i'm to laisy to go to you-tube) and i will use your reccomandation i will use the real player this time and if it works or not i let you know ok
