More than 3 eye catching new and best themes added.

Note these themes are glass coded themes. I have added PSglass and also aeroglass.

Donot close the glass stuffs unless u ain't need them



This OS installs just under 10 mins with pre - installed applications. No need to install applications,

after the installation of OS. And also registry tweaks are added and are optimised.



Donot tamper the OS; u ll invite unwelcome problem by doing it so.

I use special script to optimise WIMs. So its inappropriate to tamper the OS.



There are more than 15 gadgets in the library/documents. U can avail it at any time u need.

And also 2 scripted programs are added for extra aid! However u ll not be needing that.
