Paragon Virtualization Add-on is an optional extra-paid package for Hard Disk Manager 11 Server that extends functionality of the product by providing the option for seamless migration and data management between physical and virtual Windows servers and workstations. The package adds the following new functions to the product:


- P2V Copy to migrate a Windows physical system to a virtual environment by converting all installed software and data into a ready-to-go virtual machine. By providing support for synchronous migration from several hard disks, we ensure data consistency during online migration of a system, which seats on several partitions or hard disks.
- P2V Restore to restore a Windows physical system from a backup directly to a ready-to-go virtual machine of one of the supported virtualization software vendors.
- P2V Adjust OS to restore functionality of a virtual environment after unsuccessful virtualization with 3-rd party tools; to prepare virtual machines out of supported virtual disks or Windows .vhd backup images.
- Connect VD to connect a virtual disk as if itâ€™s an ordinary physical disk, thus opening up all functionality available for physical disks to virtual.
- Create VD to create an empty virtual disk or with specific data of one of the supported virtualization software vendors.
- VD in Volume Explorer to browse contents or retrieve data from connected virtual disks.
- WinPE 3.0 image that includes all functions of HDM 11 Server + Virtualization Add-on to perform migration or data management operations without the software installation.

Why Hard Disk Manager Server?

We offer effective data and storage management

- Automatic partition alignment allows to get the most of physical storages (not all operations are supported*)
- Any backup destination, including local mounted/un-mounted partitions, external storages, CD/DVD/Blu-ray discs, network shares, SFTP/FTP servers as well as the secured hidden partition (Backup Capsule)
- Differential and incremental backups, and exclusive file complements allows different data time-stamps with no duplication, and minimizes backup storage requirements
- Task scheduling and scripting to chain multiple operations into one job and automate execution
- Exclusive defragmentation for NTFS and FAT (27 strategies, MFT defragmentation and shrinking, etc.)
- An advanced system of filters automates the process of building up backup contents by excluding irrelevant data
- Easy management of several operating systems on one computer

We contribute to business continuity
- Live imaging and migration for Windows systems with two snapshot technologies; Microsoft VSS and Paragon Hot Backupâ„¢ to guarantee fast and reliable live protection
- Complete infrastructure for establishing a self-acting data protection system that is fully compliant with the set-and-forget backup policy
- No hardware dependency with the next generation of Paragon Adaptive Restore; our technology guarantees any Windows since XP will boot on different computer hardware (P2P) by automatically injecting the required drivers and other actions crucial for this type of migration
- Restore at a granular level minimizes downtime if there's no need to restore an entire image; you choose only the files you want
- Comprehensive recovery environments based on DOS, Linux, and WinPE 3.0 are available on CD/DVD/Blu-ray, thumb drives, or Backup Capsules to quickly get systems back on track when they fail to boot. They also retrieve valuable information from damaged hard disks and accomplish bare-metal system deployment
- Boot problems correction without restore (Windows system registry modification in the off-line mode, MBR, BCD, and the Boot.ini file correction, etc.)

- Encryption and password protection for backups guarantees security for confidential data
- Four wipe algorithms (custom, US DoD 5220.22-M, Russian GOST R 50739-95, Paragonâ€™s algorithm) to destroy all on-disk information or only remnants of deleted files / directories without affecting the used data

- Support for any Windows since XP (including Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2)
- Support for all latest hardware, including all SCSI, IDE and SATA RAID controllers, SSD, AFD, 2TB+ and non-512B sector size disks, Blu-ray drives, USB 1.x/2.0/3.0 and IEEE 1394 (FireWire) devices, PC card storages, and many more...
- Support for GPT (GUID Partition Table) disks
- Support for Microsoft dynamic disks (simple, spanned, striped, mirrored, RAID-5)
- Support for Apple Boot Camp configurations

- Virtualization Add-on for seamless migration and effective management of virtual Windows environments (optional) 
- Technician License for cost-effective maintenance of small, mid-sized or large corporate environments (optional) 
- Get free updates with no limitations
- Get free upgrades within 60 days after purchasing and a good discount later
