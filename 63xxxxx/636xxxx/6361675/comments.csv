All works fine.
Heads up for those unsure of installation. There are two installers, one for HDM11 Server and one for the virtualization add-on.There are two WinPE based Recovery disks which unpack and burn to disk automatically from the downloaded execute files, one includes virtualization addon functionality in the recovery disk and one without (in case you didnt install the add-on). Product keys and Serials contained in text files in download. "

Great Uploader.
Very fast download (it was about 650 kB/s in Vietnam)

Thank you very much.

This is the best hard disk tool I ever have."
,pirbay1958,2011-10-15T03:16Z,"Update Comment:
After using this version for a while it is quite buggy (software issue not the uploader) and there are known limitations as identified within program help files such as Merging a full partition backup with one of its differentialsâ€¦..""This function is currently unavailable for modification of entire hard disk backups."" Mounting archivesâ€¦..""The current version of the program allows the user to mount archives of separate partitions only.""
Volume Explorer not workingâ€¦..""The current version of the program does not enable to access file archives with Volume Explorer.""

You can not upgrade it without supplying an email address AND serial online.You shouldnt supply serial as it may already be registered to another user.

So wondering if there is a torrent available for a more recent version ??

cheers,thanks to uploader"
,Daniel_01,2012-06-20T08:25Z,Thanks for the upload. Sad to read it doesn't support volume explorer anymore. A key feature IMHO.
