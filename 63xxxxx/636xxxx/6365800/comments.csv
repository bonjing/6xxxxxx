,Rapier_Wit,2011-05-04T11:04Z,A9/V9. Thanks to you and the seeds for this and for the 100% in 6 minutes download speed.
[V],extremezone,2011-05-04T11:23Z,"just checked the file - video quality is pretty good but audio it's in little oos , your call if to download or wait for better quality , i know i will"
,ultimagic,2011-05-04T11:40Z,it's VIP. 100% sure. but i'll wait for the blu ray. :)
,Rapier_Wit,2011-05-04T13:22Z,My bad. Shoulda checked the sync before getting exited. This Defaced fella seems to have a problem with getting audio to match as with his Gnomeo & Juliet release.
,TechnoMax,2011-05-04T13:53Z,"hey i didn't dl this yet but try fixing sync like this:

1.get Virtualdub 1.9.11 

2.open avi file

3. Use VirtualDub as follows:

From under the ""Video"" dropdown menu, select ""Framerate"" - and select ""Change so video and audio durations match""
Save with a new filename (F7)

(make sure ""Video"" and ""Audio"" are set to ""Direct Stream Copy"") 

worked for JBNSN :)"

A/9
V/9
The Audio was slightly out of sync but was easily adjusted with the VLC Plater (+0.300's) and the audio was back in sync...
Many Thanx to extremezone and DEFACED for a Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)

If youâ€™re a noob or youâ€™re just not sure how to use the VLC Audio Synchronization here's a quick run through... Start the movie and then go to the tool bar and left click on ""tools"", go down to ""Track Synchronizationâ€ and left click on that, the file page should show up as ""synchronization"", just go down to the ""Audio/Video"" section and adjust the ""Advance of audio over video"" by either clicking the arrow up (+0.100's) or down (-0.100's) until you have in-lined the audio with the video... Hope this helps..."

this is barely better than the pvrip due to a bad encoding .
video 6 
audio 9
this is not a 9 video or more . this is a n average dvd rip and thanks to the uploader anyway.
but everybody needs to know . you guys here are too wquick to give this a 10 or you did not watch it "
