
Inlaid Rust's a Black Metal studio project scheming since 2006.
Emanating from Salinas, CA, USA.

EP 'To A Grinding Halt' drags 2007 demo's "Machine-War" concept to new 

lows.
Amid irregular Black Metal behavior and scooping Doom drones,
listener can find Industrial-Noise scarring an Odd-Ambient framework.

'TaGH' ends as an unorthodox look at The End through electronic eyes.
Where digitally-biased machines carry teeth as trinkets.
