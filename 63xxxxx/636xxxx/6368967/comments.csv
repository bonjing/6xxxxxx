,grodudu271,2011-05-05T16:43Z,Thank you man. The first thing i do when i open my browser is to open http://thepiratebay.org/user/twentyforty/(which is bookmarked btw). Maybe you are one of the few uploaders who understand the importance of small size plus good quality.

,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-06T14:41Z,"RE: Case Sensitive parts 1 & 2, and the differences between British and American crime drama;

Its interesting the lack of fear female police officers have walking into potential criminals' houses--in a disarmed society where the only thing they think they have to fear is bad intentions, it seems--and how the criminals willingly surrender to said unarmed female police officers when they realize the jig is up.  It would be laughable here in the USA.  Which may explain why British crime drama has never really taken off here."
