 Compiled by an intelligence-testing specialist and bestselling author, this book has three main aims: career guidance, preparation and personal performance improvement. Its wide range of IQ tests and questionnaires helps job-seekers identify their strengths and scientifically interpret which jobs they are best suited for. In addition, it provides an opportunity to prepare for the types of psychometric, or aptitude, tests likely to be encountered during the job search. Finally, it helps readers improve their work performance by demonstrating how to apply their natural talents and personal qualities in the workplace. A profile-matching section allows readers to check their IQ test results against their suitability for a range of jobs, from accountant to zoologist.
