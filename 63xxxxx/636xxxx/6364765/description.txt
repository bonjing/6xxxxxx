Picture yourself sitting peacefully in the comfort of your living room watching your favorite television program, when suddenly a newscast flashes on the screen declaring that invading Soviet armed forces have destroyed the Statue of Liberty and their next target is Washington, D.C. and the Pentagon. Such a dreaded scenario plays out in Command & Conquer Red Alert 2, the long overdue sequel to the RTS game that helped put real-time strategy on the map. If benchmarks are any indication, the original C&C Red Alert is still very much the standard against which many RTS games are measured. More often than not, recent RTS games have largely failed in their attempts at trying to improve upon that benchmark by introducing 3D accelerated graphics, eliminating all forms of base construction, or blending the RTS format with other types of games. In consideration of those failures, Westwood Studios was faced with the dilemma of either taking an innovative or conservative approach with Red Alert 2. In this case, they chose to take the conservative approach by creating a sequel that doesn?t push the genre forward by any means, but nevertheless offers loads of fun in the classical RTS formula. 

The story in Yuri's Revenge logically continues the events we witnessed in Red Alert 2. After the allies overpowered the Soviets and conquered Moscow, Yuri retreats underground to develop his plan on how to wreak his revenge on both sides. He starts building a network of psychic dominators, which can control the minds of people all over the planet. The allies manage to hold Yuri in San Francisco long enough for Mr. Albert Einstein to send you back through time. If you play the Soviet campaign, your mission will not only be to stop Yuri, but also to change the course of history and help Russia return to its old glory.
