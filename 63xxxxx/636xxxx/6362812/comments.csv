If you can't grow up and cut the crap with this split-RAR nonsense (CTU and like upload it in quality WHOLE for a reason!!), then kindly BUGGER OFF

The guys who actually know what they are doing up the legit content to reputable site like EZTV in one piece for a reason. You guys then up'ing split files afterwards actually does hard to THEIR work by spiking torrent harvesters like torrentz... up-rating ur cr@p at the expence of the ones who recorded and sliced out the ad's.

Get a life an leave this to the experts!"

crawl back into your hole."
