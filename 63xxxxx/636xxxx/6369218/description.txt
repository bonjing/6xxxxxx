This World War II documentary reflects on the Winston Churchill-led Allied air strikes against Nazi Germany, which have come under new scrutiny by historians as they question the motivation behind these vicious attacks. Rarely seen footage of the campaign itself, along with interviews with former soldiers, survivors and scholars, allow an unflinching look at this tumultuous -- and highly controversial -- piece of history.
