,ShockerStalin,2011-05-23T09:03Z,"Works great, thank you!

Any chance someone with access to the Exchange can host Vancouver, BC?

I obviously cannot register on the site with my copy and would love to have this city (my RL hometown).

,olite,2011-06-01T16:20Z,"So how well does this work with EA's latest Update Patch?

The EA Download Manager now installs a patch that over-rides all ""old"" cracks, so does this torrent still require the use of the EA Downloader... I hope not... lol"
,olite,2011-06-02T10:15Z,"Ahh, it doesn't the EA Downloader  still installs the new update which breaks the modern crack method... so I've written a script to auto-download and install the needed updates to get it all to work, skipping the last one. And then it downloads the needed cracks and apply them across. (And optional Super Nude patch for Sims 3 all Expansions)...

I'll torrent it as soon as I've ""perfected"" the menu section."
