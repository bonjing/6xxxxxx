Plot Outline (IMDB): When the war began, she was only a little girl. When it ended, she was the voice of a generation... A compassionate and sensitive televisual portrait of the Holocaust's greatest diarist.

Quality: I wasn't happy with the quality of the available rips so I created this by combining video from an italian rip at eMule with English sound from some low quality rip. Most of the time this is like a DVDrip in quality. See preview.
