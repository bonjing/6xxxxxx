,Jack_Raiden,2011-05-06T06:27Z,"Thanks. Unfortunately, I don't think the keygen works with this version of AIDA64. (Neither do your provided keys.)

If your key was blacklisted (e.g. generated with keygen), installation of latest AIDA64 will corrupt your registration and lock you out.

Program (AIDA64, ""setup.exe"") matches hash of official executable file. Safe. Keygen (""keygen.exe"") scans can be found here: http://is[.]gd/bhAmpf and http://is[.]gd/XppXln (remove [] ). Likely safe."
[T],adnan1102,2011-05-06T08:11Z,"keygen worked for me like a charm.
i think u r using the keygen wrongly.
Follow these instructions:
1) Open Keygen
2) In the Products box choose ""AIDA64 Extreme Edition""(by default it is AIDA64 Business Edition,so change it)
3) click on generate button.
4) give the key when asked by the program.
5)enjoy full version.

,Jack_Raiden,2011-05-07T02:01Z,"Thanks adnan1102. Long story short, I assumed, failed, and now stand corrected. (Previous set of posted keys, and mine, did not work.) A++ Would download/trust again."
,mizantrop,2011-05-08T00:10Z,"Tutorial - How works the new AIDA64 Blacklist

Download AIDA64

Download upx (if you not have on pc): upx.sourceforge.net
extract upx.exe from zip to win/system32 or aida64 Folderâ€¦

Open a command prompt (as admin) go to aida64 Folder and:

upx -d aida64.exe

then open aida64.exe with Hex-Editor
- seek this blacklist string: 1W4T47YLD6NV9XI1D5EYZWB9X

you see this:


1W4T47YLD6NV9XI1D5EYZWB9X

FTGDY8UDD6XSDSLLDVYY5WRJL

then change with HexEditor: 1W to W1 / FT to TF
1W4T47YLD6NV9XI1D5EYZWB9X to W14T47YLD6NV9XI1D5EYZWB9X
FTGDY8UDD6XSDSLLDVYY5WRJL to TFGDY8UDD6XSDSLLDVYY5WRJL


save aida64.exe
(you can can also do upx -9 aida64.exe to compress)
start aida64.exe and register with this number from the aida blacklist: 1W4T47YLD6NV9XI1D5EYZWB9X


have fun!"
