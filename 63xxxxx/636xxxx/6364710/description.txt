On April 26, 1986 the fourth reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power station exploded setting off a chain reaction that threatened to trigger a second explosion even more powerful. 
For 8 months, 800 000 soldiers, miners and civilians worked around the clock to "liquidate"Â the radioactivity, building a "sarcophagus"Â around the ruined reactor. Eight months in hell that its survivors aren't likely to forget. Covering a 20 year period, using 3D images and archival footage, the film is the re-enactment of a relentless battle against an invisible and deadly enemy.
