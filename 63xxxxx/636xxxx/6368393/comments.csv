Do you also have the new aivlasoft installer?
There was a known problem with first version because it doesn't update to cycle 1105.
Navigraph released a new setup.exe for aivlasoft it's not a new revision."

Sorry to be a noob, but could you please tell me where to unzip, I usualy don't have any probs figuring out how to install stuff and if I don't get something to work I understand thats it's me not a crap upload. I hate it when people bitch on here. P.s I have never had a go with a flight sim, I'm excited to get into this flight sim world. Hope this works for my first flight sim. Could you recomend any more sims?"
