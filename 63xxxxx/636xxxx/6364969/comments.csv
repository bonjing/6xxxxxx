""Audio Tracks ( all demuxed, skip from download the ones you don't want )
Use MPC   http://cccp-project.net/ to be able to automatically recognize & play the external Audio tracks or mux the Audio in MKV with mkvmerge      http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKVtoolnix if you wish to use other player.""

If you still want to use vlc with it's weird work around then:
""Media -> Advanced Open File... and select the video file and after that tick Show more options and then Play another media synchronously... and select the audio file you want to use.""
I suppose you downloaded the separate Audio tracks (Film Title.English ) you want.

It's never too late to chose (with right click) which file to download or skip ). With utorrent click on the torrent (so it should be blue) then click on Files then right click on file and select Don't Download or priority (High for the AUdio tracks). See the image:

When you start a torrent it's good to Uncheck the ""Start the torrent"" and click ""Select None"" then chose your files one by one...
