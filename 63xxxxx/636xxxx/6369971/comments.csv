,britt4x4,2011-05-12T19:28Z,"Hmm, I dont get how to aply the Patch.. It tells me to select a file to patch, but I cant find a file in the download map. Any help here?"
,britt4x4,2011-05-12T19:35Z,"Ah, nevermind. I found it :)

For the ones that want to know how, instal the program, close it (shut it down) open key something, go patch, search for your program files, open Superantispyware there, you should see it. then select the file. Run patch. Done :D

You can open the program again."
