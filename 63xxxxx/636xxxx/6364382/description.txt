Hi! This is 'DJ Karliboy' hitting you with my first (and fairly good) trance mix (and torrent), primarly dedicated to my girlfriend and I's two-month anniversary. 

Though this may not sound very professional (I just did basic mixing), it is a beginner's step for me, as I just started mixing music 4 days ago.

You may find the voice-overs at the beginning of the mix a bit "gay", but I thought it would add a nice touch to the mix. After all, you gotta be unique :P By the way, this was after all a present :)

So without further ado, let me detail my mix with this very tracklist:


1. Armin van Buuren feat. Ana Criado - Down To Love
2. Max Graham Feat. Ana Criado - Nothing Else Matters (Original Mix) 
3. Yuri Kane - Right Back
4. Orjan Nilsen - Lovers Lane (Original Mix)
5. Armin van Buuren vs Sophie Ellis-Bextor - Not Giving Up On Love
6. Filo & Peri Feat Audrey Gallagher - This Night (Max Graham Remix)
7. Arnej - The Strings That Bind Us (Original Mix)
8. Giuseppe Ottaviani Feat Faith - Angel (Club Mix)

So, there you go! The mix clocks in at around 52 minutes. That would be the longest mix I've done so far. Should be enough trance goodness in one file. 

I might as well introduce myself since this is my first upload here and all; I am an 18 year old boy from Norway whose interests are mainly biking, computing, and most recently - music mixing. My name is Karl Baath (just my shortened name, my full name is considerably longer). 

And I guess that is about all you need.

Thank you!

PS: Oh, and please provide me with constructive criticism if you can. I would love 
to hear how I can do better, or what you liked or didn't like. 

Also, I've seen folks making .cue files for easy switching between songs in mixes. Unfortunately, I don't know how to do that, so any help with it would be appreciated.
