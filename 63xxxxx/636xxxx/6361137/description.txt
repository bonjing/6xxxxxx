Comprised of a previously released EP and 4 new acoustic tracks, Lies succeeded in recasting GN'R into a band with more depth than any other L.A. group. The first half, the live tracks (actually studio with overdubbed crowd noises) is a nice snapshot of the band's embryonic period. The 4 acoustic songs are the heart of the record; the lovely, generous Patience sets a gentle mood, but the rest is unremittingly dark. An exorcism of raw emotion.
