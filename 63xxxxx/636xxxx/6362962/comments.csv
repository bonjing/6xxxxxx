go....go....go.................

gracias!!!!"
,ta141,2011-05-03T18:33Z,"@ JamesPY .....buddy..you don't need a different burner at all..you could burn dual layer dvds (DVD9) using NERO...it's possible indeed...SEEDKEY ALWAYS UPLOADS THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ISOS.....SO..It'S VERY EASY..IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO PERFORM IT USING NERO...GO TO THEIR OFFICIAL SITE AND TAKE A LOOK AT VIDEO TUTORIALS..OBVIOUSLY,IT'S NOT AS DIFFICULT AS YOU THINK BRO...:)"
,ta141,2011-05-03T18:50Z," @ JamesPY....BRO...LET ME TELL YOU THE EASIEST WAY....I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TO USE NERO 7/8/9/10....AFTER YOU DOWNLOAD THE MOVIE...JUST ""DOUBLE CLICK"" THE UNSTOPPABLE ISO FILE..IT WILL BRING YOU DIRECTLY TO THE NERO DVD9 BURNER...THAT'S IT..JUST CLICK ""BURN""..YOU KNOW THAT ANYWAY...AT THE MEAN TIME DON'T FORGET TO INSERT AN EMPTY DVD9(DUAL LAYER DVD) INTO YOUR TRY..IF YOU PUT A 4.7GB SINGLE LAYER DVD INTO YOUR TRY..YOUR BURNING PROCESS WILL BE ABORTED...THAT'S IT..HAVE FUN...AND I'M THINKING OF UPLOADING MOVIES AS WELL..I'M WORKING ON IT...:)"
,JamesPY,2011-05-03T19:48Z,"your second comment was easier to understand!
