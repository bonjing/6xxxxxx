1.	Navigate to the folder specified in section 2.2

  2.	Create a file named ""UserEngine.ini"" in a text editor

  3.	Paste the following into UserEngine.ini

[Configuration]
BasedOn=..\S9Game\Config\DefaultEngine.ini

[Engine.Engine]
Language=XXX"

,chrismichaeld1,2011-05-06T01:23Z,Game works perfectly. The game is not crap by the way. There are many games coming out this month and this worthy title can easily hold one over until then. Graphics on Max are not that bad. Would really like to play this MUltiplayer so if anyone gets that working please post.
,CADETbrazil,2011-05-06T01:24Z,The game works well to me but it is in italian... Didnt appear any language option when install and at start menu... How do I switch to english ?

,dothackjhe,2011-08-29T02:36Z,"@filip080009

You'd have to make an offline account through Windows Live in-game to be able to save. If you haven't tried installing Resident Evil 5 on PC, then you'd encounter a similar problem. "
,dothackjhe,2011-08-29T02:37Z,"@PonyJL

Yes they do, but that would require a better crack, if not more files added with the crack. "
,dothackjhe,2011-08-29T03:06Z,The game works just fine on Windows 7 x64. The game gives off only 21 fps upon benchmark testing though on this laptop I'm using. The game looks beautiful nonetheless.
,PonyJL,2011-08-31T20:46Z,"@dothackjhe 
Any game with any proper multiplayer security (keys/logins) cannot be cracked, unless you use an external program to do multi player matches which means you cant play with people who actually own the game."
