,daba_1,2011-05-03T08:05Z,"For the 1963 album Goin' Away, Lightnin' Hopkins was backed by a spare rhythm section -- bassist Leonard Gaskin and drummer Herb Lovelle -- who managed to follow his ramshackle, instinctual sense of rhythm quite dexterously, giving Hopkins' skeletal guitar playing some muscle. Still, the spotlight remains Hopkins, who is in fine form here. There are no real classics here, but everything is solid, particularly ""Stranger Here"" and ""You Better Stop Her,"" making it worth investigation by serious fans of Hopkins' classic material."
