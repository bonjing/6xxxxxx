Brief description of the game rules:

Each level is represented by a particular country on the game map. After successfully passing a level, one or more new levels become available to solve. The game has 2 modes - Puzzle and Slide. The player can switch between them at any moment. There is a help prompt (a clock in the left bottom corner of the game window) which allows the player to see the whole picture for a short period of time. The turn counter and the timer do not limit gameplay and serve just to determine the player rating position within the others.
