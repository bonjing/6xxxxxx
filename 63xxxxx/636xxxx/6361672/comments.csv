Audio :6\10 
Video :6\10

Movie Rating : 8\10...
REally a GOod MOvie...It is slick, has a lot of nervous energy and also has its share of fun moments. This one actually stands out in the crowd due to its unconventional plotline as well as execution. .."

,Sabretou,2011-05-19T11:14Z,"Wow are you guys serious? This is obviously not a DVD Screener. Why are the colours faded? What's with the ambient theater sound? You can hear people laughing in the theater. I don't mind CAMRips, but the least you could do is uphold warez honour and not dupe your downloaders."
