From the Infowars web site ::

Following the reported assassination of Osama bin Laden by the United States military inside Pakistan, Alex breaks down what the event means and what it portends in the days ahead as widespread war threatens to expand in the Middle East and the U.S. dollar heads for the exists. This will be one of the most important broadcasts of the Alex Jones Show. Alex talks with retired Pakistani Army three star general, Hamid Gul, investigative journalist Wayne Madsen, and Prison Planet editor and journalist Paul Joseph Watson about the Osama spectacle.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
