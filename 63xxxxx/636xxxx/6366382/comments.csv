,outbreakofevil,2011-06-18T23:10Z,It always asks me for a drive when i try to open any one of the games. what do i do? it gives me a e and f drive. 
,trippay,2011-10-22T10:45Z,"there is no MMX1+2 included, MMX4 won't even get to the install menu,  and games aren't patched for no-cd... seeing as this is a user made compilation and not an actual single disk image, the games keep asking for the disk even when the image is mounted correctly.

useless torrent."
,trippay,2011-10-22T10:56Z,"strike my previous comment.  the instructions are useless (yes, even if you speak italian).  had to dig around on the disk image and the games (and correct setup programs) are stored in the \autorun\docs folder (""docs""? really?) , which is also where you'll find the No-CD patches, MMX1+2, MMX8 keygen, and the other stuff mentioned."

I downloaded, and got ready to install, and towards the end Avira Popped up saying there was malware in the package that was being installed.
