The Priest


This very touching movie is based on a real story. It is a story of a priest who served in the Orthodox church both under German and Soviet totalitarian regimes. Against all odds and despite sufferings, he keeps God's gift of love. The movie shows how serving God and loving and caring for people are inseparable parts of Christian faith. Makovetsky, who plays the main character, father Alexander, has managed to portray his hero as an ordinary modest person. There is nothing lofty about him. At the same time, the heroism of love makes him a true hero. The inhumanity of Christianity hating Communist authorities shown in the end of the movie is not just an ideological barb agianst an atheist regime. Churchmen were one of the primary targets of the communist terror. Such people as father Alexander and the message they spread were a threat to the very essense of "scientifically based" plans to build a great and happy society requiring human sacrifices and ditching absolut moral truths.
