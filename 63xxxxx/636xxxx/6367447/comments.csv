,bloodyfool0,2011-05-06T02:33Z,Does anyone know if the audio is disabled by Cinavia for PS3?
,_frosty,2011-05-06T13:19Z,"Not for nothing but everyone freaking out about seeding should understand this.  I always seed 1/4 of what i download. This is beacause in canada most ISP's are limited and very low at that.  the best deal you can get from rogers is 120gb/mnth.  anything over that is $2.00/gb.  So as much as i like to give back unfortunately  theres is a limit to what i and most of my fellow canadians can contribute.  Infact the CRTC just passed a new law circumventing any CND ISP from offering unlimited bandwidth by allowing pay per use legislature basically allowing ISP's to charge per page.  Goodbye Internet as we know it.  Just like radio and TV.  Radio was too hard too charge because of the basic tech.  but with tv it was free when it first came out as long as you owned a tv set.  looks like the wwweb is headed in the same direction.,  So to make it short please consider that some of us have our hands or Bands (depends how you look at it.lol) tied. pirate on! to infinite and beyond!"
,crawlified,2011-05-06T13:45Z,seed plz...thanks for the upload cheers :)
,gijface,2011-05-06T21:05Z,"@ _frosty

In my part of Canada the network traffic limit is 15GB per month and $10 extra per GB after that!!!"
,DiscGolfNutt,2011-05-06T21:23Z,Can I watch this on the PS3 or am I going to get the Cinavia warning? I'm getting a lot of those errors lately. Thanks for the Upload.

,dont_wobble,2011-05-08T06:37Z,"My connection gets slowed to dial up speed after i reach 50gb. I forgot that i was seeding and went over my limit, i had seeded 48gb in a day....."

[V],extremezone,2011-05-09T01:07Z,install some codecs to support ac3 or the simple way use vlc player

,basilgirl,2011-05-09T06:30Z,"Many Internet Providers have limits, nowadays, even in the USA etc.. You should always seed equal to the amount you leech, regardless. Makes no difference on your isp limit. Just means you have to leech less or be a little more selective of what you decide to leech. You can't count on everyone else to hold up the pirate world because you don't want to ""use"" your bandwidth to participate in your part in sharing. Period!"
,limegreenclown,2011-05-09T07:40Z,"@_frosty

Try some satellite providers in the rural areas of the US, 200mb/day! Thats combined up/down

,Exodus666,2011-05-11T17:46Z,"wow what a crappy movie.

Pixar this is not, thats for sure.

Not only is it a moronic bastardization of whats supposed to be a tragedy, its not even remotely funny, there is nothing u dont see coming a mile away and all the voice actors seem to be too busy thinking about the coke they are going to spend their money on then any serious acting!

Good quality though, great work uploader."

You can watch it on vlc player - and it has audio. However, since most people need to get this onto DVD for their kids, I suggest you download avi2dvd - this will convert it to mpg - which you can watch on the other players, or burn to DVD using windows DVD maker...
