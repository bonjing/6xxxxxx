,TorVariad,2011-05-04T17:49Z,Any downloaders can verify this update?
,thornzeyy,2011-05-04T18:16Z,@TorVariad worked fine for me
,Furious1964,2011-05-04T19:35Z,Can you check the torrent please. I tried to open it with WinRAR and I get 11 errors and can't even extract the files.
,milfawy,2011-05-04T23:47Z,This update also crashes in the begining (also does the previous updates) help!!!!!  Anyone
,PoshRocks,2011-05-05T00:03Z,yes this works.. its just now my mouse cursor wont look left or right only up and down :(
,d0XX0b,2011-05-05T03:04Z,"Well I installed this update and applied this crack and it works perfectly fine for me, no crashes, no problems with my mouse either.

@ Furious1964:
Use 7-Zip to extract the downloaded file:
http://www.7-zip.org/

If you prefer not to install 7-Zip, just download the original SKIDROW release file, it's a .rar file:

,Zev747,2011-05-05T05:48Z,"Hi I am having a problem.  These are the steps I took beforehand:

1: Unpacked
2: Ran Portal.2.Update.3.exe to install game
3: Copied content from SKIDROW folder to Portal 2 folder (it overwrote a few things)

Then it told me ""steam_api.dll"" was missing so I downloaded that

Ran the game again but now it says:
""The procedure entry point SteamAPI_GetSteamInstallPath could not be located in the dynamic link library steam_api.dll""

How can I fix this?  Do I need to get a better dll or something?  I tried reinstalling but got the same error.

Help would be much appreciated; this is the only legit-seeming download of the full game I've found."
,Furious1964,2011-05-05T07:15Z,Got this to work when I put what's in the portal 2/Bin folder into BOTH Bin folders of the game installation.
,SDD6,2011-05-05T08:57Z,"Yea same , no problem installing and game runs fine but still co-op doesn't work ."
,d0XX0b,2011-05-05T10:38Z,"@ Zev747:
steam_api.dll should be inside Portal 2\bin directory. It was there for me since I initially installed the game, even without any updates."
,milfawy,2011-05-05T13:04Z," @ Furious1964 
HEy thanks man that was the problem with crashes at the begining"
,americanboyg,2011-05-05T22:29Z,"I'm having the exact same issue as Zev747 if anyone could shed some light.

I added the steam_api.dll (after getting it online) to both bin folders, only to get the error Zev spoke of. any ideas?"
,Zev747,2011-05-06T02:33Z,"I'm curious if I actually have all the game files I need... is everything necessary to play Portal 2 included in this download?

Just for clarification, my Portal 2 folder has the following items in it:

bin (folder)
portal2 (folder)
COOP
Launcher
Portal2
SKIDROW
steam_appid
Steamclient.dll"
,looloo1,2011-05-07T07:07Z,"If you didnt know, you need the origional crack from SKIDROW for this to run... Its available at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6330132/Portal_2-SKIDROW"
,fv538,2011-05-07T13:26Z,does this also fix the problem with the crashing at the end of the game>?
,Toxinus,2011-05-07T19:16Z,when i load a level it just crashes while loading. Be it a saved game or even a new game. does this patch fix that bug??? also worried about the rumor that u loose ur saved games!!!

,Dutch_Pirate,2011-05-08T13:38Z,"Hello guys, I have a problem here, 'cause when I try to unpack the release, I get a message which is saying that the compression method is not supported, and when I try to run it in a folder, it says that it doesn't work for Win32. What am I doing wrong? I have Win 7, and I downloaded this because I already finished the story, but I wanna play co-op "
,cshep99,2011-05-11T01:52Z,uh yeah i did what the file asked me to do and now it works better than it used to before it would crash just as level 1 loaded now it starts but there is no picture just sound please help i have downloaded all the updates as they came out and this is the closest i have come to playing it

,BrahxOTB,2011-05-12T02:00Z,"Is this is real?

I mean, I haven't seen Update 2, and there's already an Update 3?

Why isn't it uploaded by extremezone too?

,S1LENTK1LLA,2011-05-15T20:55Z,"SOMEONE HELP ME OUT .... DOWNLOADED GOOD TORRENT< INSTALLED FINE< LOADS FIRST ""VALVE"" SCENE ... ON FIRST LOADING SCENE FREEZES THEN WINDOWS GIVES ME AN ERROR?!?!?!? please help a fellow pirater XD"
,EndFED,2011-05-17T13:35Z,"Hi, I suggest to not use anything other than extremzone for portal 2 cracks. Update 1 is the most stable crack out there. I got random crashes with other updates and sometime you can find a patch.exe file ( about 128k) never touch that file. extremezone doesnt have it because you dont need it. YOu can still play coop with update 1 with tunngle just make sure your partner doesnt use the other deceptive updates."
,den7,2011-05-18T10:47Z,"Hi all, was getting CTDs prior to installing this but after everything went smoothly. Saved games will be erased after applying though. But you can start a new game starting from any chapter"
,zathador,2011-05-30T03:47Z,"i am very disapointed because for 1. i spent so much time downloading this, (hint hint SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDD) 2. i have done every update there is and still nothing so please help me. i get past the the valve adds and stuff and the it stops responding...so PLEASE HELP MEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,rohver,2011-05-30T19:23Z,"@ Raffico : I'm getting the same problem. No crashes in the game but at the very end, after the cut scene my game crashes. 

Anyone help?"
,rulerdude,2011-05-31T21:49Z,"is this just an update, or full game?"
,d0XX0b,2011-06-05T04:34Z,How could 45 MB be full game?
,mazdarati,2011-06-08T19:42Z,i have tried all download from skidrow but no one works :( 
,koenie--123,2011-06-29T18:51Z,"do i need to download the game first, cuz it says update, so i'm confused :S"
,aaab4257,2011-06-30T16:59Z,"@koenie--123

Yes, you need to download the full game.
It's only an update to SKIDROW's release of the game.
