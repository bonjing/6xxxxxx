A friend of mine asked me to put all Bruckner's nine symphonies on one DVD. So i created some menus for navigation and several visual additions to the audio content. As i'm no authoring professional, the spent hours for making this DVD very likely do not justify the result, not to mention any public appreciation. Never mind, my old schoolmate's reaction had been quite positive.

Torrents for the music itself are already available, even lossless. At the risk of being left alone with my upload, you get the chance for ten hours of Bruckner in decent quality on a single disc, ready for Home DVD."
