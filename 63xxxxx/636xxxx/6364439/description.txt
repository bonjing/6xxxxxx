        Go get some rosemary

        After months  of being  alone, sad,  busy, sidetracked,  free,
        lofty, late and away from his kids, Lenny (Ronald  Bronstein),
        34 with geying frizzled hair,  picks his kids up from  school.
        Every year  he spends  a couple  of weeks  with his  sons Sage
        (Sage Ranaloo), 9, and  Frey (Frey Ranaloo), 7.  Lenny juggles
        his kids  and everything  else all  within a  mid town  studio
        apartment in New York City. he ultimately faces the choice  of
        being their father  or their friend  with the idea  that these
        two  weeks must  last 6  months. In  these two  weeks, a  trip
        upstate, visitors from strange lands, a mother, a  girlfriend,
        'magic' blankets, and complete  lawlessness seem to take  over
        their lives.

        The film is a swan song to no excuses, irresponsibilities,  to
        fatherhood and self created experiences. And to what its  like
        to be truely torn between being a child and being an adult.
