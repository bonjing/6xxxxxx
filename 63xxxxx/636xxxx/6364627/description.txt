Psychology for the Classroom: Behaviourism describes and reflects upon the foundations of behaviourism and the proliferation of behaviourist techniques in common practice today. Through examples drawn from research, presentation of theory, description of pedagogy and illustration by vignette, the book informs teachers and allows them to modify their teaching in order to take account of what is now known about the way that carefully planned curriculum and appropriately reinforced behaviours lead to learning. There is a particular emphasis upon the role of the traditional principles of behaviourist learning theory and practice to contemporary issues and strategies in e-learning.
