,Wolfzz213,2011-06-13T18:27Z,"Good show, Most Episodes were recorded on ABC Family, some from disney, and the rest were the actual DVD rip. One episode in season 4 has now sound, and 6 or 7 episodes had audio 1 second too fast, overall

A:8/10
V:9/10

Great show, I used to love watching this every Friday night on ABC.

When the image came on it kind of looked like when a TV messes up during a storm. The audio was fine though it was just the video. Has anyone else had this problem?"
,SkyMason,2011-10-06T23:19Z,I looked around and found DivX Plus and it has fixed the problem. I was using VLC player before. Very good quality for the size.
