Lamb is an electronic music duo from Manchester, England, whose music is influenced by trip hop and drum and bass. The duo consists of producer Andy Barlow, who also produces under the pseudonym Hipoptimist, and singer-songwriter Lou Rhodes. They achieved commercial success with two hit singles "GÃ³recki" and "Gabriel".

Andy Barlow stated during their 3 January 2010 show at The Tivoli in Brisbane Australia, their 32nd gig of what was supposed to be only 7, that it would be their "last gig ever, but who knows". Barlow later followed up on Lambs Facebook fan page on 7 January, "I have a strong feeling that there will be more Lamb shows, It doesn't seem like it has reached its finale just yet".[5]

In December 2010, another e-mail was sent out, announcing the recording of their fifth album, to be titled "5", and a selection of songs from the album were previewed at Playground Weekender music festival near Sydney, Australia on 20 February.

**Limited edition "pre-order" version of the album - available to fans who paid in advance as a method of crowd-sourcing the finance to produce the album.**

I take absolutely no credit for the ripping, encoding and uploading of this track onto the internet. I did the relatively easy task of sharing it on torrent.
