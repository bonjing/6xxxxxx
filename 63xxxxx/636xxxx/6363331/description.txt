They finally did it! Wolfgang vaults, who owns all the rights to the audio and video from the famous Bill Graham venues including all of the early shows from the Winterland has just released the entire Trower show that had been heavily bootlegged for years.

The exception with this version is there's no timecode display and the the video and audio are far superior. This is an A+ release. I just captured the videos and assembled together for an entire concert and all fits seemless. This is now one of the best ever Trower videos available!

I did this in mkv format for the best posible lossless output. You can display in Windows 7 Media Player with this add-in: http://www.divx.com/downloads/divx/1. Or use your prefered converter. Enjoy!

This is the entire concert and IS NOT AVAILABLE ANYWHERE ELSE!
