Artist: Luv Machine
Title: Luv Machine
Genre: Hard Rock Prog
Origin: New Zealand


Band from NEW ZEALAND was released in 1971 and is so far one of the most expensive records on the collectors market. Most of the real collectors have never seen an original copy! By the way the band was banned from radio stations in Australia an New Zealand because the albums front cover was judged pornographic. Their music are really great-compact rock songs and if you need a band to compare with take KILLING FLOOR. Musically it\'s driving heavy progressive rock typical of New Zealand and Australia (like Human Instinct but a bit harder) In places the band have a Hendrix vibe whilst at other times UK early \'70\'s bands such as Human Beast come to mind.
