Very good quality for TS. Its watchable for ppl that are hasty and don't want to go to the cinema.(I am one of them) "
,BadboyJay55,2011-05-05T08:38Z,"Extremely watchable. Some parts are even borderline VHS quality. For a TS I say A:8 V:9.

I was very picky when it came to choosing a Thor torrent because my connection is slow and I didn't want to waste hours downloading garbage. If you're anything like me, go with this one, it won't disappoint."
