
This interview was filmed in San Diego, California (1994) on the very day when Ernst Zundel.., for the 1st time.., met with the ethnic novelist.., Ingrid Rimland !!

In the interview, Ingrid discusses her Mennonite background as reflected in her first two books ("The Wanderers" and "Furies").

The video is about 53 minutes long and has a more-than-watchable quality of  A9 / V7

As always.., after watching.., do your best to "pass it on".....


!!! Truth Does Not Fear Investigation !!!

Also something to remember is..,  "He who Wins the War.., also Writes the History"
