I saw there were no torrents that englobed all the albums of Stars so I gathered it up and here it is:


    A Lot of Little Lies for the Sake of One Big Truth (EP) (2001)
    Nightsongs (2001)
    The Comeback (EP) (2001)
    Dead Child Stars (EP) (2003)
    Heart (2003)
    Set Yourself on Fire (2004)
    In Our Bedroom after the War (2007)
    Sad Robots (EP) (2008)
    Fairytale of New York (Cover) (2009)
    The Five Ghosts (2010)
    Tour EP (2004)

I didn't include the cover album since it's not really of the band so I guess it's ok. and I have found this Tour EP though I don't know where it comes from!
Tell me if you want more etc...
