[V],wushdishmeen,2011-05-06T04:18Z,"Hopefully you guys listened to this weeks shows.   THURSDAY IS NO LONGER A LIVE SHOW.   Stern dropped thursday.

Instead it was some old crap ""This date in howard history"""
,edmoreland,2011-05-06T04:30Z,"Oops I actually meant to say the "" history"" shows.
Sucks about the Thursday shows.  Still, much love for the ups.  Thanks a ton."
