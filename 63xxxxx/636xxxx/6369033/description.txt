This release defaults to a fully customised icewm-Rox desktop (fluxbox, wmii and dwm are also installed) using a SimplyMEPIS 2.6.36-4 kernel, our own assistants to help configuration, and the usual range of applications for desktop use. Latest Iceape (2.0.13-1) for internet needs, Abiword (2.8.6) and gnumeric (1.10.14) for office use, qmmp and goggles music manager (0.12.1) for audio, gxine, mplayer and gnome-mplayer for video, gppp (dial-up), wicd (1.7), umt-panel2 (from aptosid) for GPRS/UMTS/3G and ceni (2.21) for network connection, pidgin (2.7.11) for chat.

Many languages are fully supported out of the box with the language chosen at live CD boot carrying over to install. Chinese, Japanese and Korean fonts are included as well as ibus in the full version.

antiX works on computers with as little as 64 MB RAM, though 128MB RAM is the recommended minimum and the 486 kernel version should work on AMD K5/k6.
antiX is fast and has low RAM usage running live or installed.
