AS ALWAYS... for a list of files, see above, click the number next to "files:"

What a CRAZY-ass month. I was swamped with submissions this time and there were some GREAT finds in my inbox and dropbox. Even more than one Creative Commons licensed track, which was nice for a change. I was getting the feeling that people were forgetting CC for a while there. Please excuse any dupes, as I was running out of time and the playlist was already a couple of days late. So I did kind of just "wing it" when it came to dupe-checking. As I often do when it's down to the wire.

Had to resort to using commercial software a little again this month, but my ultimate goal of using all open source, free-libre software to construct the playlist is still VERY important to me, even on the operating system level. So wish me luck for next month as I take a much bigger leap than ever before.

Huge thanks go out to all who sent me encouraging words this month. It really helped.

Remember, you can get a hold of me on twitter @indie69

I really tried my best to narrow it down again to 69 tracks, but once again I'm afraid I'll have to break the rules a little. There was just SO much this time, again.. this time. Maybe for good now. Even though I like the relatively compact size of the 69-file playlist.

And if you blog, tweet or otherwise (facebook?) post to the interwebs, LINK to me. It helps, a LOT. (URL removed, but it's a pretty obvious url)

But MOST of all, above all else.....

SEED as long as possible. And if you wish to narrow the playlist down by deleting tracks you don't like, you can still seed the entire playlist by first copying the folder into another folder and deleting files from within THAT folder rather than the original one you downloaded. Yes, it takes up more space, but you get to help seed. And seeding is VERY important. No-one likes slow, badly seeded files. And after you've decided you need the disk space, you can always go back and delete
the original folder to just keep the ones you liked in he copied folder.

Seed, share, spread. But also BUY... support the artists you like. Save music.

And if you want a CD, try your best to buy direct from the artists. 

See you all in June! Summer is here!!!
