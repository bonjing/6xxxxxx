any ideas?

[V],ChattChitto,2011-05-06T01:46Z,You have asked your question on my website and I have replied to you there. :)
,jersson,2011-05-06T02:13Z,Thank's Chatt. Works like a charm
,lordnaul,2011-05-06T03:14Z,"i have the same prob as TehDoktor. always trial ended, no key chk file to find as it does not install any such folder. what am i doing wrong? "
[V],ChattChitto,2011-05-06T10:57Z,"@lordnaul
As I told him it has been tested on both Windows XP and Windows 7 and it works flawlessly :)
How did you apply the crack? as you might have done it wrong."
,hardkh,2011-05-06T13:31Z,"cant seem to get this to work also
have tried many ways and followed instructions to the T
running win7 64bit"
,BigJ352,2011-05-06T15:19Z,I am having the same problem as TehDoktor. There are no other folders in C:/programdata/slysoft. Therefore I can't find anydvd.chk or anydvd.key
[V],ChattChitto,2011-05-06T15:23Z,"If you can't find it its ok then, Just replace the original file with the cracked one."
,paul666lucas,2011-05-06T21:50Z,"Hi, I have used your previous versions of Anydvd without issue.

But I am having the same problem as Tehdocktor. Please could you post your reply here, as I do not have access to your website.

Thanx"
,hardkh,2011-05-06T22:04Z,"That still does not work
Still get trial expired eror"
,flashgordon69,2011-05-06T23:58Z,vista 32 here. It already says anydvd.bat but still won't work. Could this have to do with the date? As I have my system post dated so Total Media Theater doesn't request a internet connection before automatically starting a movie. 
,mapperboy,2011-05-07T00:21Z,"Ahsum as usual ChattChitto!!
Moon Rock level stars for your continuing efforts.
Just one thing I haven't been able to ever completely cure; the rebuild of the license file under Win7 as located in Programs Data\Slysoft\AnyDVD\.  In some of your releases it never got rebuilt/restored by the system in others including the last few, it gets rebuild about every three or four runs.  Any ideas?"
,gio.gemelo,2011-05-07T05:57Z,Searching in the internet I found a key that works but it is not HD Key.
,Evilness74,2011-05-07T10:59Z,Thx A Lot....   :)
[V],ChattChitto,2011-05-07T13:18Z,"For everyone who are still facing the trial expired problem:
Uninstall using Your Uninstaller PRO in Super Mode.
it will search for any registry and file associated with it.
only using that method you are able to completely clean your system and make the crack work :)"

yes I did disconnect from internet
Never had any problems with other releases by you only this one"
,Tatletz,2011-05-08T03:28Z,"Thanks for the upload ChattChitto but it didn't work for me too. Did everything as per instructions and tried both automated 1 and 2, as well as manual, but still no luck. Just reinstalled  the previous version 6.7.9.0 and all is good. If not mistaken there was a similar issue in the past with one of the releases. "
,hardkh,2011-05-08T04:17Z,"Thanks anyway ChattChitto
I also went back to former version and all works a treat"
,PDiTomaso,2011-05-08T12:15Z,"I've had the same problem. I'm running Windows Vista 32. Found no traces of Anydvd.chk or .key.
Followed instructions as always and still does not work. Had to revert back to 6.7.9.0. That works Great except on Green Hornet."
[V],ChattChitto,2011-05-08T14:10Z,"Ok thank you very much for the feedback guys! I really appreciate it :)
It has worked for me on two different OS (Windows XP & 7).
Clearly some of you are facing problems with it, I shall track and troubleshoot the problem and let you know!
As always: thank you for your trust!"

,Dooly00000,2011-05-10T03:24Z,"I can install fine. Instruction works and everything.

Now problem I have with my Win x64 is fact that my AnyDVD does not seem to remove any of the protection when ripping ISO... Any suggestion?

For now, I'll try going back to 6790"
,rlboxer,2011-05-11T03:59Z,"Hey ChattChitto, you are one baaad mother f'er Every single time I see your name, I know everything will work perfectly! As far as AnyDVD goes, it copied Green Hornet easily! For the record, I purchased the movie, and my cat sometimes breaks DVDs, so I copied the original and use the copy and put the original in a safe place. Everyone should thank ChattChitto properly. On Friday when I get paid, I am going to contribute to your hard work."
,Int_Auto,2011-05-11T07:11Z,"There's something definitely wrong that SlySoft changed with this version. I absolutely needed this version for The Green Hornet, and the only way I ended up getting it to work was to make a Virtual Machine with VirtualBox (as in fresh, brand-new install; never had a previous version of AnyDVD) and enable dvd-drive pass-through. At least that way I was able to rip it to the host machine's shared folder. 

It's very strange; the crack worked fine in the VM, it created the registration file just fine. However, no registration file was created on any computer I attempted to install this on that had a previous version. Yes I tried the Your Unin-staller in super-mode or whatever the all-inclusive mode is called, but that didn't work either. Three different versions of the new 6.8 I tried along with three different cracks; even the beta 6.8.0.2, and they all did the same thing, ""Trial has expired."" 

I don't know if there is anything you can do ChattChitto, but this version seems to not work at all if the computer has even looked at a previous version of AnyDVD."
,PH3N0M3N,2011-05-11T14:47Z,"Just installed it and it works. I can make .nrg images, using Nero 10, after protected DVDs. I hope they'll burn just as easy and withtout problems..
Thx C.C."
,Cash745,2011-05-11T18:14Z,Windows 7 - 64bit not taking.. I followed instructions 100%.. Ive used your great stuff before (BIG FAN).  I noticed that when I uninstalled the old anydvd and reinstalled your new 6.8.0.0 it didn't ask me to restart.... then it proceeds to trial has ended which I cannot seem to break.. No .chk or any file .key I can find anywhere on my system search. Something indeed must be different! Love to have a resolution soon thanks Chattchitto you pimp!
,iluvhomebiz,2011-05-12T13:40Z,"What I don't get is this:

1)Uninstalled the old version of anydvd.
                    2)Make sure your disconnected from the internet.
                    3)Install the AnyDVD & AnyDVD HD.
                    4)If it asks to reboot, do it.
                    5)if your computer restarts anydvd will load (you will get trial version) now close anydvd.
                    6)click on ""AnyDVD & AnyDVD HD Crack"".
                    7)Drag the cracked file and paste it into AnyDVD Installation folder.


There is only one file in the folder, and that is the installation file - the only other files are the NFO, and an internet shortcut to your forum site. Where is the 'crack'?

And lastly, is all this install/crack BS really worth it to you guys? I checked out the price of this app (without the other bundled stuff), and it is only a hair over 50 bucks USD - I would think that's a small price to pay in order to avoid all the complications of installing/cracking. 

I will say one thing, though: I think it's some real crap that you only get a year of updates for that 50 bucks :( I guess that's why some would rather try to get a PB download of it.

But I digress :) Thanks for the download, ChattChitto"
,jessup,2011-05-12T20:56Z,"Installed this on a fresh cleaned computer with xpsp3 (x32bit) after install I let it restart my pc net was offline and Anydvd tray shut down, used auto cracking didnt work then used auto cracking 2 and voila all perfect, Thanks."
,silverbullet763,2011-05-15T02:58Z,"Not sure if this is the cause of the others issue, but I noticed that after the reboot I had trouble with the registration as well. I had the trial version installed prior, so I used AnyDVD Leftover Killer to remove any registry entries, etc. and reinstalled using your program. I attempted to do the automated crack and it claimed to have completed. The software still claimed to be a trial, so I went in manually. I forgot that the program was open upon reboot and when I attempted to copy the file it wouldn't allow it until AnyDVD was closed. Once I closed it and copied the file everything worked as intended. Just something for everyone having difficulty to try. Anyway, excellent upload! Thanks!"
,JRdvd101,2011-05-15T17:14Z,"It does not work again! 
please test it some more another time! I keep getting the trial expire popup box. I have been download your stuff the last couple of years, but your last 2 anydvd cracks have not been working on a 64 bit system."
,xunderworldx,2011-05-16T06:33Z,"For everyone who is getting the trial expired, the solution is pretty simple if you can remember the date you installed anydvd for the very first time. So here are the steps:

1. Change the time on your computer to sometime during the first 20 days of anydvd's installation. If you don't remember keep trying to guess if you have time.... Also make sure you are offline just in case
2. AnyDVD will now be on trial again, exit out completely simply overwrite AnyDVDtray using the crack provided.
3. Open up AnyDVD & you will have the fully lincenced version.

You can now change the date back."

thanks in advanced :)"
,atm743,2011-05-20T01:38Z,"nooby284- song is raise your weapon by deadmau5



as for the torrent. i cant seem to get it working. last copy i had running was a beta version (which is probably why its not working. 

i uninstalled. ran ccleaner to remove reg files. reboot. ran ccleaner again for reg files. installed file reboot, did the manual crack and nothing.  tried it with the automated method and nothing. 

running windows 7 64bit. i have a feeling the crack is causing it cause everything in program data for slysoft is gone. after doing this the listed methods of installing i still dont have a reg file in there. so apparently its not working cause there is no reg file being sent to the program data directory. thats just my guess. 

Chatt is the man. every single one of his releases work for me but this one :(, i trust him to figure something out maybe :)  "
,LSL76,2011-05-20T07:49Z,"For those having the Trial Expired error, use Fox Killer to reset your trial.  After that, when you run ChattChitto's crack (copying over the AnyDVDtray.exe in your installation folder), it will work without issues.  Always remember... Google is your friend."

,Cdr04,2011-05-22T16:45Z,"ok heres the problem as per the releaser's directions i.....
1)Uninstalled the old version of anydvd.
2)Make sure your disconnected from the internet.
3)Install the AnyDVD & AnyDVD HD.
4)If it asks to reboot, do it.
5)if your computer restarts anydvd will load (you will get trial version) now close anydvd.
6)click on ""AnyDVD & AnyDVD HD Crack"".
7)Drag the cracked file and paste it into AnyDVD Installation folder.

i did get the ""trial expired"" so as the instructions go on i did this

8)If you get ""trial expired"" don't worry move on.
9)Do a search for anydvd.chk and delete it or rename it to anydvd.bak,  the locations are as follows: For XP
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\SlySoft\AnyDVD\AnyDVD.chk

at first it was there so i did that but it still said ""trial expired"" so i uninstalled it and reinstalled it the same exact way again, rebooted but the AnyDVD.chk was NOT in the folder this time
unless im doing something wrong here i think the patch isnt working
any ideas?"

,flourgrader,2011-06-02T10:32Z,Hi ChattChitto. I like your stuff. BUT this has problems. It does not work on some versions of windows7. I think coz it does not write a licence key into the C:\ProgramData\SlySoft\AnyDVD AnyDVD.lic.

Just do a Google search for it, it's not hard to find.

Let me just say, that I rarely write comments for torrents, but felt compelled to due the level of quality in your work and the level of trust I have learned to place in your uploads.

It dawned on me that for years, when searching for a torrent, I have sought the ChattChitto version FIRST.

Why? For one, your shit ALWAYS WORKS. Period. 

Beyond that, your custom interface and aesthetic is beyond compare...

Finally, I usually HATE keygen audio, but with yours, I have found myself leaving your keygen open, JUST FOR THE MUSIC!!!

Excellent Work.

For some reason Avast had decided to run AnyDVD in sandbox mode and for that reason it would always reset the default settings. It could have been me been absent minded and just checking yes to run it in sandbox mode but I can't recall ever doing that, lol. I realized today when I tried to run a later build, I noticed it had a red box around the window, which means it's running in sandbox mode, as soon as I turned it off, it worked fine, after a few hours of un/re installing it, lol. Every now and again your inner noob will come out.
