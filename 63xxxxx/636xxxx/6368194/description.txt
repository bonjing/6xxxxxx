Arctic with Bruce Parry

Amazon presenter Bruce Parry turns his attention to the Arctic Circle. Indigenous ways of life that have remained virtually unchanged for millennia will cease within our lifetimes. Marine mammal hunters, like the Inuit of Northern Greenland, will have to find new ways to live in this harsh place. They are the last of their kind. But for others, this rapidly changing world promises great opportunity. The Arctic is rich in oil, gas and minerals. The US geological survey estimates that 25% of the world's undiscovered oil and gas could be located under the polar ice cap. 

However this series will not be a series about the politics or science of global warming. The focus will be human. Bruce, and his BAFTA winning production team, have found a method of telling important global stories with humour and warmth, drawing a large, young audience to often difficult issues. Same immersive format as Amazon, with Parry embedding himself in a series of indigenous tribes plus camps of Westerners who make their living out of the regionâ€™s natural resources.

Part 4: Canada

Bruce travels to the far north of Canada to live with the Caribou people and witness their annual spring hunt. The Gwitchin tribe has hunted migrating caribou in the Arctic wilderness for thousands of years, but this tradition is now under threat from oil exploration. Bruce then heads south to the tar sands of Alberta, home to the second largest oil reserves in the world, to discover how native people cope when the oil industry moves into their territory.
