,The_BLaCK_ReDNeCK,2011-07-26T04:53Z,Quick download. Thanks svdcekm. I'll get back later to give my little mini-review of the rip/movie. Have fun.
,The_BLaCK_ReDNeCK,2011-07-27T00:12Z,"I'm back. Here you go:

Audio: 9
Video: 7.5 (decent fer its size, anyway. Fullscreen on VLC).

Audio/video perfectly synced. Using VLC.

Movie: I dunno. Kinda weird. It's not the best movie in the world, or in anything... I don't believe it's the price of a one-time movie ticket, that's fer sure. lmao. It's lacking.. kind of empty... I never liked ballet anyway. Well, yall pretty much have to see it to get yer own thoughts (duh).

The only real highlights of the movie are when Natalie Portman gets ""familiar"" with herself and when she gets it on with Mila Kunis. Hahahahaha!!! SWEET.

Again, thanks fer the upload!"
,gramranger,2011-09-21T18:38Z,"Video and audio was good quality. Good rip.

Toss the subtitles file. It was so poorly written I think a korean learning english must have made it. Seriously, it was so poor I couldn't stop laughing.

Luckily this movie doesn't need them as its all spoken in english."
