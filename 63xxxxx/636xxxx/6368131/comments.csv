Thanks, it works fine, read the readme file.
And a real pirate know that key-gens can give a trojan alert.
False positive!!"

This is great software and a great torrent.   The only thing wrong with this torrent is the idiots who have downloaded it, do not know what they are doing with it, and then come straight in and complain that the uploader has uploaded a torrent that is in some way inadequate.
   The only inadequacies here are the moronic bastards that failed to read the install instructions.
   Pay attention!!!   Before you run the keygen you must ensure that the application is shut down entirely.   The keygen will not generate any serials otherwise.
   Generate a serial and copy and paste it into a text document.   And don't forget to save the document.
   Run the software and copy and paste the serial from the text document into the register/activate box.   Then enjoy this real sweet piece of software.


Thanks again, bro, for a great up:)

Read the antepenultimate comment thus far.

I am not going to be dumb enough as to post serials here!!!


My instructions are perfectly clear...follow them"
[T],djjlicious,2011-05-23T00:09Z,"Serial number won""t work!!
Dissable your av and run the keygen!"
,tre.fire,2011-07-15T02:23Z,"I'm not a noob, followed the instructs completely, did NOT start the program after install, but the key gen says * Close Antilogger *. It's not opened, never was. I uninstalled, restarted, same result. I restarted several times fucking around with various possibilities, after one uninstall I started the keygen before the software was even on the computer. Same thing.

Irritation at the dudes who warn about virus without knowing anything is a given, but really the biggest fucking losers on this site are douche-essences like nightissuchproximity who get angrily upset and whiney about these un-knowing people because it makes him feel better about himself to cut people down anonymously. Dumb fuckwad."

So, I'm a ""fuckwad"".


Well I for one am prepared to upload and am willing to allow those uploads to be placed on the marble slab of the autopsy yard for inspection...(unlike yourself -- 'cause you have never uploaded anything).

I think that does not really put you in a position to criticise.

To put things into perspective (subjectivally): you are a prick and I am not.

Never ceases to amaze me how most critiques come from those whom have never uploaded -- probably because they don't know how.

I'll be gentle with you for now...but only once...

...further episodes will be available when and as required..."
,roystone,2011-12-14T20:31Z,thanks works like a charm.
