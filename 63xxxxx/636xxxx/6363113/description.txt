It seemed that Live Through This was written specifically to address the tragedy of Kurt Cobain's suicide. Released only about a week after Cobain's death in April of 1994, such a perception was inevitable. Of course, the truth is far more complicated. Live Through This was completed a few months before Kurt Cobain's suicide. Last minute adjustments had to be made to Live Through This so as to not seem disrespectful to Kurt's memory. For example, the last song on the album is identified as Rock Star, when its true title is Olympia. So if Live Through This is not primarily about Kurt, what is it about? Well, it is primarily about good music. Live Through This was voted best CD of the year by many industry magazines and the success of the album propelled Courtney Love to star status.
