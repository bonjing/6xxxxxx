,mantikor777,2011-05-05T00:53Z,Can't seem to get this to play after downloading.  Won't play on VLC or DivX Player.  Disappointing.    
,Delron41,2011-05-18T00:46Z,"AAAAwwwweeeessssommmmeeee movie. Though getting it to play nice with my PS3 was a little tricky (mkv2vob won't work), it was well worth it. Great quality as always from the BOZ man."
,manl300000,2011-06-25T02:06Z,Dont work with WDMedia Player.
,insoc_cr,2011-07-11T21:44Z,Thanks. Perfect BD transfer. The image is crystal clear and sound is perfect too. Best transfer ever!
,morbus74,2011-07-21T14:50Z,"Delron41: Run it through MkvMerge GUI once, with settings ""no compression"" and mkv2vob will work..at least it helped on my case.."
