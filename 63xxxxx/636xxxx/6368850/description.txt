On the war-torn planets of tomorrow, mankindâ€™s greatest battle is aboutto begin.
 
With its frontier colonies devastated by a growing insurrection,Earth dispatches the elite 8th Armored Infantry (nicknamed Section 8) to repel the coming onslaught.

The nickname refers to an old United States military regulation where a 
soldier would be dismissed from service through being mentally unfit for duty.

The near-suicidal missions that this division volunteers for brands them 
as insane by other military units.
 
Section 8 deploys by â€˜burning inâ€™ from their orbital drop ships tens of 
thousands of feet above the battlefield, utilizing the most advanced
arsenal of military hardware known to man.

Their mission: to scout and secure difficult objectives and smash enemy
defenses in lightning-quick assaults.

An intense first-person shooter, Section 8 allows players to dynamically 
alter the flow of combat as they see fit.

Employing tactical assets and on-demand vehicle deliveries, players are given unprecedented strategic control over epic sci-fi battlefields. 

Get ready to burn-in trooper the war begins in 2009.
