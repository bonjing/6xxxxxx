C. Schumacher's Dressage System Vol. 1 video.

Thank you for taking the time to educate yourself; I've been around a lot of horse people who think they know it all because they've been working with horses for years and years but don't even have a single book or video; the result- horses that could have had an easier life but are never given the chance because of someone who thinks they know it all formed them.

Info.
This first volume in the Conrad Schumacher Dressage Training system focuses on the importance of good foundations in the rider's training regime at the Basic/Novice level:
Prerequisites: which form the cornerstones to Conrad's philosophy
Working Patterns: which help horse and rider compete at their optimum level
Quality Preparation: which helps the rider become mentally fit.
Sections are introduced by Conrad, then narrated in concise and clear terms by Rhegan White with bullet points at the end of section to help clarify the key points and graphic diagrams to help demonstrate Working Patterns.
â€œHave you experienced the situation where you and your horse cannot achieve your goals in the show ring? How can things that work well at home go so wrong during a competition? As riders, we blame the horses, the footing, the weather, the judges but in reality, it is lack of quality preparation and mental fitness.â€ notes Conrad Schumacher.
"In this DVD I will discuss the correct way to approach your preparation so that your training at home will optimize your performance on the show ground!â€
