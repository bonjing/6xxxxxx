                Brand new two-part detective drama based on the novel
                Point of Rescue by Sophie Hannah. When the bodies of
                a mother and her young daughter are found in the
                bathroom of their luxury home, new DS Charlie Zailer
                and her junior colleague DC Simon Waterhouse
                investigate. The pair immediately clash, disagreeing
                over whether the case is a murder-suicide or
                something even more sinister. Elsewhere, young mother
                Sally Thorne tells her best friend that she had an
                affair with the husband of the dead woman, and her
                friend warns her to stay away.
