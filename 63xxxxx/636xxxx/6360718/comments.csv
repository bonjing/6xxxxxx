,FyiMfer,2011-05-24T19:50Z,"in1Ose, and everyone else wondering... this is is the whole PPV broadcast start to finish, no cuts, I think it was 3hrs 48min.  I think the PPV broadcast was able to fit in two prelims - Jobouin vs Garza (the very first bout of the evening) and Menjivar vs Valencia.

NO spoilers (even tho it's almost a month later lol) but this is one of the best overall events maybe in all of UFC history.  Download the prelims, too.  Nothing to miss, every fight has something unique. "
,DJWannabeNL,2011-05-28T12:12Z,"Hey Sceneline,

Thank you very much for this episode, I download the UFC episodes for a friend and I was wondering if you could upload the UFC 130 as soon as possible.

Thank you,
DJ Wannabe "
