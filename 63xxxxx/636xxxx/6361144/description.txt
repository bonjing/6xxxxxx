Exquisite, lively platform game with excellent graphics, a variety of special effects and realistic animation. The brave hero must defend his castle from the onslaught of ugly demons, and descend into hell itself to stop them.
Demons. What do we know about them? Often they appear suddenly. They are hairy, with hooves and horns. Usually, they live in hell, but sometimes ... Sometimes you're sitting in your castle, admiring the sunset and expecting no company. And do not expect that your furniture will suddenly levitate, or that someone with hooves will raise holy hell on your marble floor. But if this does happen, what will you do? You will not stand for this, you will fight back violently! Youâ€™ll chase the demons all the way back to hell if necessary. Play "Demon Slasherâ€ and fight out what itâ€™s like to fight demons, that just wonâ€™t stop coming. Unless you stop them that isâ€¦
