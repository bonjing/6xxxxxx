and it is good rip and size is nice. You have over 100 seeders there."
,rajmxxx,2011-05-05T18:03Z,Thanks 20-40. But there is no sample or screen shots of those movies. Are those HD???
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-05T21:01Z,"Read the torrent name: DVDrip - DVD by nature cannot be HighDef, only rips and encodes of HDTV and BluRay disks can.
If you by HD have meant 720p - there is plenty of torrents for that too.
Use Search. Do not make me to search for you.
Please."
