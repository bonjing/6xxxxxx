This is a continuation from my original Mortal Kombat HD torrent, and this was the best way I could go about doing this, I'll update a new torrent every time a new episode comes out, so you can continue seeding the original, or you can move on the the new one.

If you only need the new episode, just deselect all but that one, simple enough, eventually I'll have the whole series uploaded, but this seems like the best way.

If you think I should do this differently, please tell me how.
