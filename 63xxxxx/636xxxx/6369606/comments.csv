Besides it, the HD is probably just 720p or inferior seeing the size of the files.

All 04 eps 1080p HD = 838MB"

Or just wait until the series is done?"
,phillyblunt23,2011-05-06T22:29Z,i would wait til the series is out then upload as one package and make sure they're 1080p.
,namajnin,2011-05-07T07:42Z,"Alright, I'll just wait for the season to end then, as far as I know, 720 is as good as it comes here."
