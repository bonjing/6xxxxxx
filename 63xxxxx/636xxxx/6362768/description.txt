A description of the mixtape's theme in her own words:

"In my mind, this mixtape is about identity, the ways in which I've grappled with who I am and what matters to me. For the past year I've been in this space of hyperawareness, constantly attempting to reconcile the disparate - and often contentious - aspects of my life.  The more that I think about it, the more I see myself as an outsider. There's something strangely comforting about feeling set apart, about understanding that everyone experiences alienation in one form or another.  Sometimes we're alienated from ourselves, sometimes from those we love, and sometimes just from the dude in front of us on the subway.

I made this mixtape by myself, alone in a basement. This served as the perfect setting, because when you're working on a project about your own head, it's nice to be lost in it all day."
