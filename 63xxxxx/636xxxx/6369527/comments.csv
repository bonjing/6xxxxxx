,PageEsquire,2011-05-22T22:19Z,"Can someone make a better source copy please? This one is great for when it was made, which had to be a midnight screening. Being than it was online 5/5(?) and the movie came out 5/6. And opening day crowds are crazy. But the point is, the original source did have a few issues, the auto-focus for one thing should always be off(it is on for this copy)causing the cam to try to compensate for high speed movement by refocusing, this makes some scenes impossible to retouch. The best way is to, if you can, open the projector replacement bulb hatch and place your cam right over the bulb.Then just crop to the playback, and if you use a hi-def cam then you'll get a dam good, if not perfect copy. I've been caught doing this, so I stopped before it was more than a theater manager scolding me. But it works like a charm. also if you do this it is also easier you get a line audio copy. All it takes is a cam, and friend that works in a movie theater."

,HKt0p5,2011-07-11T02:30Z,"Whow.. this is TS!? Apart from slight camera shaking, I couldn't really tell!

I really don't get it, people making such fuss nowadays about quality, etc. I agree maybe I'm not the person to judge since I'm only watching Thor because of Asano Tadanobu (the actor playing Hogun) but really, what I see is more appreciation to comments -harassment- than what this is actually all about -- torrents - and most importantly- what's IN THEM.

Thanks a million for the upload! Ignore the damn spoiled kids. "
