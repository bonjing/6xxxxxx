[CENTER][QUOTE][SIZE="4"]Marvel Studios expands its film universe with a new type of superhero: THOR. This epic adventure spans the Marvel Universe; from present day Earth to the realm of Asgard. At the center of the story is The Mighty Thor, a powerful but arrogant warrior whose reckless actions reignite an ancient war. Thor is cast down to Earth and forced to live among humans as punishment. Once here, Thor learns what it takes to be a true hero when the most dangerous villain of his world sends the darkest forces of Asgard to invade Earth. Kenneth Branagh directs this fantasy epic which stars Australian actor Chris Hemsworth as the ancient Norse god, Tom Hiddleston as his evil brother Loki, Natalie Portman as Jane Foster, a young woman who befriends Thor on Earth, and Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Thor's father and king of Asgard. Expect to see agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., previously seen in ''Iron Man,'' to make an appearance, further forshadowing the coming of The Avengers![/SIZE][/QUOTE][/CENTER]

Must say, most awaited movie. Well well well!! This comes straight from IMAGiNE's Release so don't expect much as it's gonna be the same but guys the best part is that the quality is intact, Sound is perfect for a TS, video may not be but well won't be a real CAM sound. Wait for the biggies to come out with a better version of it soon. ORIGINAL NFO INCLUDED and sample too. Check it out before commenting and watching. 
Small size are always preferred. 

FAKU!!
