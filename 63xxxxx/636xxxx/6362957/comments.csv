Funny thing is, as soon as it was listed, it had 84 seeders already, so it's the same file as everyone else but got listed on this site late in the game.

Download it here, download it on the Lubuntu website, either works and gets the same result."

,g00ber510,2011-05-07T21:40Z,How about you tell me what the heck an md5checksum is.
,Harlekin33,2011-05-07T21:41Z,"Yes, the md5 checksum match!

THIS IS GENUINE!"
,g00ber510,2011-05-19T20:23Z,"Thanks for the validation.  You'd think with 107 people seeding at least one would have said ""Hey, this is bullshit.""  But they don't, because it's real.  Fuck's sake."
