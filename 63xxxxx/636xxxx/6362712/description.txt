       A woman tries to get an extension on her laptop pawn, but         
        mistakenly got one for her TV instead. A man buys the 1989
        Neoplan 38 party bus that Les bought the previous season (in
        "Crazy Cash") -- but never returned with the money, forcing Les
        to find someone else to buy it. Another man offered an old
        patent medicine device that "cures" syphilis. A man complains
        that he got too little money for his DVD pawn, but accuses
        security of manhandling him. A woman tries to sell Courvoisier
        bottles designed by Ert, but their boxes were damaged in a
        flood. A couple try to exchange the woman's earrings for a
        promise ring, except that the earrings, which her boyfriend said
        he spent $1000 on, was fake. A man, facing eviction, pawns his
        Christopher Radko Christmas ornaments, even though Les usually
        doesn't buy ornaments.
                            
                                 
                                                  
      
            
                                                     
                                                 
                                                                      

      We know who we are, where we came from, and why we're here.
