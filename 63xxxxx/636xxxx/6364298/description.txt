This is the main fight only and short interview immediately thereafter.  That's it.  No other fights, no entrance by St. Pierre or Shields, the video opens just as the two combatants begin the fight.  Figured this might be helpful for people who don't want to download roughly an 8gb file just to watch the feature match.

Don't bitch.  If you don't like it, don't download it, and take your shit talk elsewhere.

Please seed!!  Don't download and then not share.  I'm on crappy DSL, and will dedicate my full upload to this file, however I need help from seeders.  Do your part and MINIMALLY seed to 1:1 ratio.
