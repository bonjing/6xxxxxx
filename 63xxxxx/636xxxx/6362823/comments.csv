""If you are one of the many people who cannot see the screens from imageshack...I am extremely sorry abt that..the only way is to download the screens folder which is included in the torrent..Sorry for the trouble.
Hope you Understand""

If you like the download/encode/upload and my work please click on the ""+1"" next to quality and do comment on it ..

Please seed atleast 1:1 so other people could download as well..

Thank you"
,Poglodyte,2011-05-03T15:19Z,Thanks man. Btw you just have to copy and paste the url for imageshack rather than clicking the hyperlink
,Poglodyte,2011-05-03T15:21Z,I think it can see that you're coming from thepiratebay when you click the links there

Thank you.  I'm extremely excited to meet the dumbest person on earth, unless your only a 5 year old or something.

""wahhh, I can't watch something because I'm too stupid to read what format it's in.  No wait, I'm even dumber than that because I spent a day downloading the file that I couldn't spend 5 minutes downloading VLC player; which plays literally EVERYTHING."""
