Downloaded it because of this comment. I do not agree. Can't watch this. It's not even close to a screener. Very grainy video. The audio sounds okay though."
,f.kruger,2011-05-04T16:42Z,Yensen must be frikkin colourblind. A7 V5-6 little/poor colour/def. ok-ish for screener & plays ok. Will wait for a better file. Thanks for up tho froggie.
,mp_morgan82,2011-05-04T17:15Z,"@Yensen
Why give the video an 8 and then complain that it's unwatchable?"
,KPP1999,2011-05-04T17:37Z,"If you have crappy gear,the download will be too,good gear+good pic...KPP1999"

He was quoting ""oithatguyoi"". Been plenty of downloads, so I'll wait for some more A/V comments. Dying to see this movie, so I want a pretty good copy. Going to see it in the cinema at some point regardless."

Worth the download."
,denedude,2011-05-07T19:20Z,"Well I DL'ed it, and used convertxtodvd to burn it to dvd, so I can watch it on the TV. But maybe 2-3 minutes into it, the sound cuts out.
Anyone else have this problem?
What can I do to fix it, if anything?
p.s. after adjusting brightness etc I'd rate it 
a-7
v-7."
,denedude,2011-05-07T20:27Z,"In all my wisdom I somehow converted before torrent was even done downloading...

converted fine...after tweaking a-7, v-7"
,nevermask7,2011-05-09T07:18Z,Excellent quality.  Definitley agree with oithatguyoi.  Just watch the sample; it looks like a damn dvdrip.  Thank you for this.
,Everdark,2011-05-16T12:20Z,Thanks froggie. your a gun ;) 
,Toedion,2011-05-19T04:56Z,"Love when dumb asses complain about a movies quality when it is just released. This is amazing quality and perfectly watchable, if you don't like it go fucking buy a ticket and watch it in the theater."
,Torrential.Reign,2011-05-30T13:55Z,"for sure it's watchable, A=7 / V=6; but b'cos there R quite a few darkish scenes in this film, quality suffers most in these parts & it's a little difficult 2 see what's happening; turning up brightness / contrast doesn't help much either.... look, overall it's pretty good for TS ver if u just can't wait 2 watch."
