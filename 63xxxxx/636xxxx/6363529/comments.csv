,Saki33,2011-05-09T23:16Z,"I already downloaded the sceneline torrent so don't need it. Lots of people would rather have a no rar torrent (doesn't make much difference to me as long as there is a torrent). I checked out your other torrents, so even though you don't have a skull will recognize yours as trusted. 

Good luck with the skull"
