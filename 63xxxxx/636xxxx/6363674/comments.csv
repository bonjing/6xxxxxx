,ClassicsOnly,2011-09-18T17:01Z,"Twentyforty, I'm a big fan. I was wondering if it's possible to reseed this Last Picture Show torrent for a few days and I will seed it for at least 3 months. It was added May 3, I started downloading it June 29, and here it is 3 months later and I can't get past 80%.  Your help is much appreciated. Thanks much!"
