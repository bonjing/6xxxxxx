I'm curious as to what is missing from the European (UK) remastered version (this version) that is included in the American release of this movie. The American release is 194 mins. but this release is only 186 mins.

,Riddhiman,2011-07-29T16:11Z,"55trucker, This is an up-scaled version, for no official bluray exists. James Cameron is currently working with a 4K master print of Titanic for the 3D re-release in 2012, which will likely be the source for the upcoming Blu-Ray. 

As for the run time, this up-scaled version(probably HDTV) is from a PAL source(UK,India,etc). Now PAL videos are notorious for a 4% speedup, making the film run faster than intended(though with a higher resolution). This is why difference occurs between the NTSC and PAL ver. of the same movie. Nothing is cut or missing , there will be , also , a shift in audio pitch btw the two ver. Original blu-rays run at a frame rate of 24fps, which is also the rate at which a film runs in the theater. "
