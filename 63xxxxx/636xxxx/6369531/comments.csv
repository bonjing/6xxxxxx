,pennknig,2012-01-31T08:55Z,"@twixtmynethers
I have the same problem, actually all 3 that are posted.

1) PLAY_PoRTaL.bat and MyPC_SuKS_PoRTaL.bat both fail to load, command prompt window only, Taskmanager reports that they are not responding. I have waited 5 mins for them to respond
2) hl2 app loads but only up to ""START NEW GAME"" gui, then nothing, the button doesn't even make a noise when pressed.

I did copy/paste the gameinfo.txt from the Portal file to the hl2 file.
This was the only way to get the the game to start (see #2)

Any help here???"

,Gatux,2012-04-12T16:53Z,"I had 2 problems :
- gameinfo.txt missing in /hl2
- then : unable to play a new game

Solutions :

- First, copy ""gameinfo.txt"" from ""/PoRtAl/portal"" to ""/PorTal/hl2""

If you can launch the game, but you cant play a new game, here's what I did :
- Download from the internet a savegame
(for exemple http://www.nicouzouf.com/en/?id=portal), get the ""Start"" one.
- Create a folder named ""SAVE"" in ""PoRTaLhl2"" and copy the savegame

Finaly load the savegame and ... it works ! (for me at least xD)"
