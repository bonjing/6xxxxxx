Marian, the candidate policemen, who avoided being flunked from the academy only through connections, is sent off to a small town where he can do no harm. The police chief there has a daughter (Luska) he needs to marry off, and any likely candidate driving through town is arrested for speeding and thrown in jail where she brings him home cooked meals in hopes that he will fall in love. A mob informant is relocated to the town through the witness protection program. Predictably, Marion becomes the hero when hit men show up to kill the informant, and he gets the girl.

Nothing terribly original, but I thought it was pretty funny...

------not my rip-------

I used SubResync to make the srt file, then cleaned it up a bit, spelling and grammar a little, and where the wrong word had obviously been used, but left the translated figures of speech as is..
