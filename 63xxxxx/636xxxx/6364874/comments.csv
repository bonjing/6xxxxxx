@pooloop and ajaxen94

both of you are superb uploaders. i think ajaxen94 is not using pooloop's rips and posting as his rips. if he was doing that he deserved to be condemned but since these are his own rips he deserves appreciation. hope you two understand this and be friends"
[T],ajaxen94,2011-05-05T18:22Z,thank you abj642 your probably the only one who has noticed the comments and i am a she by the way i dont want to argue with pooloop but he keeps getting my goat and he knows that my torrents are not his as he uploaded after me on one occasion probably to find out for sure its agood job i am not a he the language would probably be blue
,htmurgatroyd,2011-10-22T05:21Z,"Hi ajaxen94. I appreciate your efforts. I appreciate and respect you as a lady also. You hold yourself with grace and dignity when someone wants to be childish with ""My torrents better than your torrent, nyah nyah"". Let him post and ignore him. It just shows everyone else his immaturity. Thank you"
[T],ajaxen94,2011-11-02T10:24Z,@htmurgatroyd Thank You
