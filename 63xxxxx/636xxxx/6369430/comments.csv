,muLineZu,2011-05-05T20:32Z,"Thanks 4 the upload.
@ the guys that have already downloaded this version and the other one from TiMPE, question: which one is the best? Encoding parameters seam very close (bitrate a little higher for TiMPE) and the size is very  close (2.83 GB for TiMPE). Thanks!"
,QborT,2011-05-05T21:19Z,"muLineZu   -  ViSiON will always be better than TiMPE.  TiMPE has a tendency to do shoddy rips, often lots of pixelation, they are getting better but still..."
,Quiker,2011-05-05T22:01Z,"@QborT

You are so wrong lol Vision uses inferior and faster settings than TiMPE, which uses advanced techniques of encoding. Vision rips are the ones which have more pixelization and noise. Get your facts straight. Vision encoders don't know much about encoding...they do pretty much the same thing in every encode."
,QborT,2011-05-06T02:40Z,"LuLz, Quicker.  As in the TiMPE encoder?  No big surprise, you think TiMPE (your) rips are better.  Cheers."

,Malasky,2011-05-10T20:25Z,"Thanks for this. Both audio and video quality are excellent for a 2.6Gb file.
Looks good on 32"" full hd TV. "
,HellFrog,2011-05-20T04:54Z,xVid is still widely needed by the public at large as mkv is not supported by many older DLNA appliances.  Now I would ask why anyone would bother with divX but I'm not expert either.  I appreciate it when Xvid and .264 are available!
