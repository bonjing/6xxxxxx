A: 6-7 (7 is also generous)

Also if you like missing snippets of the movie that may or may not include essential dialogue and plot then you'll love this torrent. 
I'm assuming they are just snippets, because really I don't know how far it skips ahead cuz it goes to a completely different scene at times."

I don't get why all the low ratings.

I gave slightly even rating due to the fact that the movie is partially cut. 

This is listed as 1:44 min. The actual movie is 2:03 min. So we're almost missing like almost 20 minutes worth of footage."

Not a very good copy. Watched about 5 minutes then skipped through the movie to see if the rest was as bad as the beginning. It was. Flicker was all over the place. Color was pretty far off too. Audio was, comparatively, decent. Then again, it was being compared to pretty bad visual. Go to the theater or wait for a better copy. 

Thanks to the up-loader anyways. You tried. "

The audio is pretty good, though. It doesn't have the harsh echoing that some of them can have. 

My biggest gripe would be some missing scenes. They were obvious breaks in the film. 

For a free copy, however, this is pretty darn good.

You're a moron.

How do you know there were no black gods?
Also, heathen merely means ""not christian or jewish"", I fail to see what that has anything to do with denying black gods.

,hydro5135,2011-07-04T05:27Z,@Colphin there are no nigger gods in European culture. And jews made this movie. They put a nigger in becuse they hate white people and want nothing else but to destroy all white cultures. Look up how Zionists divide and conquer on you tube.  
,cb1001,2011-07-04T22:26Z,"@hydro5135 You're a dumb ass. The reason there are no ""nigger"" gods is because they didn't even know there were different skin colors. These Norse legends are from the Scandinavian peninsular. They probably thought everyone was 6'6"" and drank beer like water and found war fun. And what is white culture? White people were still living in caves and drawing on walls when Africans where building empires. White people were carving canoes out of logs when people from the Middle East were trading with China. You're just another white redneck piece of shit with your head still up your ass.
