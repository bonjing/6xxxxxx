[V],twentyforty,2011-05-02T21:47Z,"Some problems, froglog. Server related, should be resolved. Just start the torrent and left them active. Sorry. If you run Peerblock, double-click on Systray orange icon, find my host OVH in list of active connections, right-click on it and choose Allow permanently 91.121.222.59 - that's me. "

thanks for coming back with a bang with loads of upload +1 as usual.
If its not personal, is it advisable (wise) to post your IP address. btw i thought your are from USA, but the IP points to France to Netherlands?!!! probably its fitting that you posted your IP for this movie UNTRACEABLE !!!!
LOL"

Thanks for the detective work.But its not 20-40's home IP.Its his host OVH.And if you're talking about anti-p2p measures.They have their own policy and most certainly they will not pursue a 20-40 people swarm where they will find 5 USA,2 UK, 1 Belgian ,2 Greece and rest of 'em indians (ball park).That would be a world tour for them.
All they want is a local tour through CA mostly.So they will target swarms with 10,000 peers.But then the more you think the more you fear."
