"A Fistful of Paintballs"

As the Greendale student body enjoys 
their year-end picnic, Dean Pelton (Jim 
Rash) announces plans for a small, quick, 
safe game of paintball. As the game heats 
up, alliances are formed and broken and 
friendships are put to the test. When a 
mysterious and threatening figure emerges 
on the Greendale campus (Josh Holloway, 
"Lost"), it becomes apparent that this is 
no ordinary game of paintball.

Enjoy :)
