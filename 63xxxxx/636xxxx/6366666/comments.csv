(even a lot of info about it from his closest family, and his 3 nephews from Tito, who he spent a lot of time with before he died, take their word for some of the info, and with the rest I am sure you will be convinced just as all the rest of us who are and more and more starting to be! And sorry for the beginning, just got a bit mad because as you can read, lost ALL I wrote..) 

FUCK!! I wrote a LONG post that disappeared, giving you some examples of the proof and the real FACTS that really are there, but was too much, lost, and I don't have time to write it again, so give u here short one of the best and also, go to Michael Jacksons nephews twitter accounts, and go back to the time around the release and the months before, and read for your self, what they say, so don't believe me, or the up loader, or the one who created the videos, believe and trust the closest family to Michael and take their words for that there are a few fakes on this Michael CD! The nephew who MJ played the ""Hold My hand"" song to before he died and asked for comments I believe is the one who wrote most about it, and Taryll, who talked to Cascio Teddy now and then, but look at all these first and foremost:

Toriano Adaryll Jackson Jr (Taj), Taryll Adren and Tito Joe (TJ) (Tito's kids).

The 2 nephews who have said a lot about the mater (the last one of the tree, or other family members just google and you will easily find them. But these two had good ""intell info"" to share with you, read all they had to say about it!):"
