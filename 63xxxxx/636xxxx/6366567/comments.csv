I truely hope that somewhere out there you are getting all the credit and appreciation that you deserve, extremezone, for all work you do that has brought smiles and good times into so many households. thanx!  "

,RedJelloHead,2011-05-05T05:13Z,"Do not download.
V: 7 maybe 8.
A: 3

Is not synced up, still.
Noticed it most at about 51 minutes where voice and lips are moving seconds apart.
Wait for a proper download."
,HiMyNameIsPHAM,2011-05-05T06:19Z,"V: 9.5
A: 9

The video quality was really impressive, but there were some lags. And the audio was clear, but you can see at some parts it fall out of sync. Overall AMAZING! Thanks for the upload."
,scfc4eva,2011-05-05T15:43Z,"reserve_1 and anyone with no audio on ps3 convert to ps3 in winavi,perfect."
,Kikee_31,2011-05-05T21:19Z,finished watching. yeah there are definitley sync issues BUT i stand by my earlier comment. Its NOT often you see anything less than great from extremezone and if anyone happened to notice ezone has fixed the sync issue and posted a link to his revised copy. I guess he wasnt happy leaving us with anything less than perfect. Thanx extemezone. We appreciate your dedication to perfection.
,ninagagi,2011-06-28T16:23Z,Thanks much.
