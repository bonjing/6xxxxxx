Infos : when installed, the game will be in italian. Just go to the options after choosing your nickname and change the langage to english. Get the last patch at vertex4.com/sunage/patch/setup_sunage_v1100.exe

After that, the game will always auto-update. Enjoy !"
,thePyro_13,2011-08-03T08:56Z,"Regarding the language.

If you open the ""v4pinst.cfg"" file before burning to a cd(of if you're just going to install from a folder) and replace line 2:
""iniset sunage.ini general language    it""
With
""iniset sunage.ini general language    en""

Then when you install, it will use English from the get go."
