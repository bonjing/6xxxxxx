"Changes"

After suffering partial paralysis 
while searching for a long-lost love, 
lottery winner Cyrus Harry (guest 
star Logue) is brought to Princeton 
Plainsboro for treatment by House and 
the team. Cuddy's mother (guest star 
Bergen) threatens to sue the hospital 
for malpractice, jeopardizing both 
Cuddy and House's medical licenses. 
Chase and Foreman make a bet that 
tests each one in different ways.

Enjoy :)
