FAQS

Q. My game held when I click on New Game or Options in game menu.
A. Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages and then try video fix "Counter-Strike\video fix\video fix.reg". If it don't fix the problem then go to "Counter-Strike" folder find "hw.dll" delete this file and rename "hw - orig.dll" to "hw.dll" this will definitely solve the problem.

Q. When I create a listen server my game freezes during map change.
A. Solution#1 Use changelevel command to change the map e.g changelevel de_inferno Or quit the game and create New Game again.
Solution#2 go to "Counter-Strike" folder and open "rev.ini" file in notepad, comment ClientDLL=steam\steamclient.dll to #ClientDLL=steam\steamclient.dll
This is permanent solution but now no server will show in internet tab. This is a revEmu bug.
