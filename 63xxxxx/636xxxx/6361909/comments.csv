Even if you have seen the films a thousand times, this is still suspends and very great entertainment .
Also due to the narration of Erik Steele ,I like also how he does the voices off the individuals .
Anecdote: Peter Benchley plays a little part in Jaws (film)as a TV reporter . 

Are there more audio books of Peter Benchley?

Thank you for this great upload rosie 1966
Regards Kenneth John (1967 )LOL"
