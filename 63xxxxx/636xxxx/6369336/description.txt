This was a benefit album for Moncton Headstart, a children's charity. It was recorded live at the Capitol Theatre in Moncton on May 9th and 10th, 1996, and released on Staccato Records. There is no copyright date, but I assume it was released the same year.


There are a number of styles represented, including blues, jazz, and traditional East Coast music. Songs are in either English or French, sometimes both. 


I doubt it's still available; I bought my copy at a library book sale for the princely sum of $1, thinking it was purely East Coast. While it wasn't what I expected, it turned out to be one of those found treasures.
