"Us or Them"

The White House grapples with the 
unfolding tragedy as Sterling (Zeljko 
Ivanek) continues the investigation into 
his primary suspect. Sophia (Laura Innes) 
manipulates the traitor inside the White 
House, confirming the suspicions of Chief 
of Staff Peel (guest star Roger Bart, 
"Desperate Housewives"). Leila (Sarah 
Roemer) and Michael (Scott Patterson) 
attempt to rescue Simon (Ian Anthony 
Dale), but at tremendous personal risk. 
Elsewhere, Sean (Jason Ritter) and Vicky 
(Taylor Cole) try to identify Sophia's 
secret courier before it's too late.

Enjoy :)
