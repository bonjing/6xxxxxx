,mds_labz,2011-06-01T13:44Z,"read the readme file you have instructions with pictures there, and the game is working perfectly on windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit no serial or infected crack or patch needed. You have to be stupid if you couldnt run the game.

I dont know if I have mention that you MUST HAVE internet connection and to be conected to internet in order to play the game"
,1234yeah,2011-06-04T06:15Z,"FAKE , the game try to connect even on mission and single player.

,British89,2011-08-16T12:42Z,"The game works fine....

Here is what i did...

1) Download the torrent ""durr""
2) Unpack the zip file!
3) RUN Setup.exe
4) Install the game.
5) Open Crack Folder
6) Install Steam using SteamInstall.exe
7) Run steam but do not log in!!!!! Just leave it on the screen shown in the readme.
8) But the language folder in the games installation directory for example C:/Program Files / APOX / run /
9) Run the game using desktop shortcut.
10) If asked to install updates, make sure you do so...

Now i have played the game just fine but i did so by guessing what the Russian words mean to navigate the menu's..

So my problem is.. How do i get the bloody thing in English? lol"
,British89,2011-08-16T12:54Z,"Ah nvm i put it in the wrong folder pfft.

Dont put the language.txt file in C:/Program Files / Apox / Run
Put it in C:/Program Files / Apox / Gameclient / Run"
,British89,2011-08-16T15:12Z,"Download the game patch from here

http://www.apoxgame.com/patch?myversion=11May12A&aff=german

Install the patch and start the game

When you see the game logo press the return key ""ENTER"" once, now you can play ;)"
,kelvin234,2012-03-04T11:13Z,"it works.. thank you so much mds_labz.
follow this.
1. download this torrent
2. after downloaded seed
3. download apox patch that british89 explain size about 400 mb.
4. install apox
5. install steam
6. backup steamapi.dll at c/programfiles/apox/gameclient
7. download undead steam crack (google it)
this crack not allowing you play online, so if you wanna play online replace with your steamapi.dll backup
8. place the languange in the apox/gameclient/run
9. place the undead steam crack in the apox/gameclient.

there you can play it fully offline.
