by other uploaders.Keep the good work."

FlĂÂťte! Zut et merde...!
Please, would it be possible to not hardcode subtitles?
Why make an upload exsusif to people speaking English fluently?
I mean if wanted, you can just add an srt.-file to your upload in any language you wish.
I hope all this doesn't sound too harsh, it's just that after reading the critics at IMDb, I wanted to see this movie very much, and now it's all wasted."
