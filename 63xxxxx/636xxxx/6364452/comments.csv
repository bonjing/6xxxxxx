When that didn't work, I trigger an update, which inevitably broke the crack, but the program no longer crashed. Seems like maybe your DLL needs some more work.

That's because you've updated it therefore crack no longer works thus defeating the purpose. Crack only works with this edition - v3.3.0 


theLEAK never experience this problem, probably your system may have problems or your internet security has detected something. Thereâ€™s no problem for Windows 7 because theLEAK has tried and tested on all edition of Windows 7.

Another suggestion is that you should block ""Xilisoft iPod Rip 3.3.0"" application from accessing the internet because like Adobe System, Xilisoft checks for unregistered softwares."
,gentlyusednew4u,2011-05-16T01:55Z,where is the crack folder and how do i copy and overwrite and where is the one provided
,Saredog,2011-05-17T03:36Z,Thanks soooooo much. ive been looking for a freeware but then my dumbass remember the wonderful TPB. I'm seeding (like it needs it)
[T],theLEAK,2011-05-17T19:09Z,"@gentlyusednew4u 

It's in the folder already. If you can't find it, try re-downloading it again."

HELP!!!"
[T],theLEAK,2011-05-23T19:30Z,"@tj908400

theLEAK's suggestion would be, download this software and install it in Mac. Copy the song onto your usb or a portable harddrive and upload it to iTunes.


Hope that works"

,PIRATE-555,2011-05-30T15:57Z,"Windows 7, 64Bit system.  2GB ram.

This program works well, but this program is not only a memory hog, it's a memory vacuum!  

My iPod has 160GB with a LOT of data to archive and transfer to iTunes.  My memory usage it begins at 20% active before any transfers.  But with transfers and time (about 5 min.) I see the memory usage ramp up and up to 95%, then the program locks-up my system!  And even sooner if I have other programs working.

I tried the program in the 'Safe Mode' and that seemed to help and extend the crash time to about 10 min... long enough to get all of my files transfered to my iTunes.

I tried to install in other 'compatibility modes', but that didn't help.

Hope this help you.

I can see where step 2 in the instructions is confusing because there is no ""crack folder"".

INSTALL with the file called:  
x-ipod-rip--000000000816.exe

Now simply COPY the file called:  imfc0.dll (provided with the install file) to your NEW folder and overwrite the file with the same name there.

My folder is located at:
""C:\Program Files (x86)\Xilisoft\iPod Manager\ipodmanager-loader.exe""

Hope this helps!
