why do you have to upload a video in 12 pieces? I'd be amazed if you could just unrar it before uploading. I would even seed it then."

Anyways, thanks! Will seed."
,softdev,2011-05-06T15:01Z,"Great rip, thx!

Btw, its weird to see people nowadays that find it so difficult to unrar... who then upload the very same file as a new torrent without even saying a thank you..."

Why are people so angry when it's RARed?


RARs were used in the late 80s to mid 90s when Internet connections were slow, costly, and download clients didn't resume from where the download left off.

RARs were used to break a larger file down into smaller bits so they could be downloaded overnight on a dialup/leased line connection.

this is 2011. bittorrent protocol/clients resume file downloads w/o issue and dialup/leased line connections are few and far between. 

the biggest issue w/ RARs today are:
-you have people who DO have no idea what a RAR file is(hence the FAKEs comments on your other uploads) and think the file they've downloaded is defective in some manner

-cases such as myself: yes i have over 2TBs of storage available for storing movies. this does NOT mean i want extraneous files taking up space. if i have to unRar a file, you can be assured i, and many others, won't be seeding it back because i'm/we're not having some bullshit files taking up space that doesn't need to be taken up.

Honestly, RAR is a technology from the past. it needs to be left there."
