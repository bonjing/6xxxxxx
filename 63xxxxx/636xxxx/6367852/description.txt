"Dave of the Dead"

A horror movie gets the gang to thinking 
about the coming "zombie apocalypse." Dave 
fears he's a little zombie-like in his 
complacency at his boring job, and shocks 
everyone when he announces he's quitting to 
follow his dream and open a restaurant. Max 
and super-competitive Jane square off on 
some silly challenges to see who could 
survive if the zombies took over. Meanwhile, 
Penny dates a hipster named Toby (guest star 
John Bobek) and finds it exhausting to keep 
up with his too cool friends.

Enjoy :)
