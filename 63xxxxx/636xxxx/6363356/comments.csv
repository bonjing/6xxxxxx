There is quite a bit of flicker throughout, not all the time, but still alot. Other than that, pretty good video. No people walking thru, no laughter. Watched it on a 32"" screen and was a little blurry around some of the edges.
Audio is very understandable, towards the end I think it may have gotten better.
