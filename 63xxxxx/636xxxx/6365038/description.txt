           OF THE WORLD'S GREAT THINKERS--A MARVELOUSLY CONCISE 
           BOOK WITH NEW ANSWERS TO THE ULTIMATE QUESTIONS OF LIFE
           When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? 
           Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the
           nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely
           tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like 
           ourselves? And, finally, is the apparent "grand design"
           of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who 
           set things in motion--or does science offer another 
           explanation? The most fundamental questions about the
           origins of the universe and of life itself, once the 
           province of philosophy, now occupy the territory where
           scientists, philosophers, and theologians meet--if 
           only to disagree. In their new book, Stephen Hawking
           and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific
           thinking about the mysteries of the universe, in 
           nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and 
           simplicity....
