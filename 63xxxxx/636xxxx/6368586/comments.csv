,starance,2011-05-09T08:29Z,"I'll give this a 8, overall.  Good quality and sound.  If you're expecting something that is pitch sharp and perfect, then go to the cinema."
,danmelrz,2011-05-09T18:46Z,"ill try this one if its really GOOD than the first one...

,neo85x,2011-05-10T02:30Z,watchable
,jazzmattg,2011-05-10T09:45Z,Thanks...I'm looking forward to this one!!!
,bosefus,2011-05-10T11:54Z,"Looks pretty good, no flickering, very watchable for the most part.  I just wish people would turn off the damn auto-focus on their cameras, as there's several scenes that go in and out of focus right in the middle of the action.  The in-focus scenes look great.  The scenes that are dark are just okay."
,Anon6666666,2011-05-10T17:16Z,"Does anyone else have trouble burning this with nero 7 ?

If anyone can help this noob burn thor onto a dvd that would be awesome"
,mp4hvn,2011-05-11T02:33Z,"hi Anon6666, u can can use any converter (e.g. formatfactory) and make an mpg or avi, that would solve your problem writing in Nero.."
,Anon6666666,2011-05-11T05:14Z,"Thanks a lot man, Also this is the best cam I've seen (including imagine's)"
,racktor,2011-05-11T18:38Z,1mb/sec download the whole time.  very watchable.  i give it an 8 as far as cams go all around.  mainly blame the autofocus.  thanks for the upload and the effort to fix it up.
,S1L3NT7,2011-05-11T19:20Z,"Why Can't I burn it to dvd?
Any one? PLZ!"
,rando606,2011-05-11T22:34Z,i cant burn it to dvd either. this is the best quality thor i have found i downloaded 2 and this one is the best but it wont burn to a dvd the other on will though.
,rando606,2011-05-11T23:30Z,i found out why it wont burn. it wont burn because it is a mp4 file and normally movies off here are avi files. in order to burn it you need to convert it from a mp4 file to a avi file.
,mordiP,2011-05-12T10:06Z,"Get Aimersoft Video Converter Ultimate it will covert anything, & it's available @ TPB with crack "
,condeoparra,2011-05-13T00:41Z,Turn off the fucking auto focus when you cam goddamn...
,ust2,2011-05-14T06:03Z," NOT Cinivia protected :D (which surprized me)

 V:8 
 A:9

 Watched it on a 42'', the video is a little dull and focus issues at times, nothing serious though, and audio was fine.

 No reason to wait for a better one, the movie itself really won't benifit or make it any better with higher quality.

 What I mean is, it was a pretty lame movie overall."
,spectralx,2011-05-14T12:52Z,"This torrent is 100% OK and is including a Romanian .srt subtitle.  
(avoid download the ""Thor 2011 DVD-SCR XViD-2fkYkg"" that is also here on TPB, because it won't work. )"

,ulkar314x,2011-06-06T20:37Z,@ust2 i rarely comment anything but hey dude.. u cant tell that movie it self was lame cuz every person likes some movies more than others. what i MEAN is that on almost every tpb torrent containing thor movie in comments every one says that movie it self is 10+ so drop dead noob. dont be a prick and give some respect
