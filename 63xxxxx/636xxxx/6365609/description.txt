Release Title: Robert Plant - Band Of Joy 2011 - [MP4-AAC](oan)
Encode date: UTC 2011-05-02


Storyline:
Broadcast April 22, 2011 on PBS TV's Live From The Artists Den

Band of Joy | War Memorial Auditorium | Nashville, TN | Feb 8, 2011


Before rock was about rage, it was about slow, deep, complete soul-grinding coitus â€“ the kind
of flesh on flesh revelation that shifts realities and levitates bodies through the sheer force of
attraction and friction that releases built up tension. If Band of Joy demonstrated one thing at
Nashvilleâ€™s War Memorial, it was the potency of carnal thrust as trance-inducer and
firestarter.

And if one would argue that Robert Plantâ€™s latest musical incarnation lacks the seismic sonic
force of the band that gave him fame, it could also be argued that Led Zeppelin was a hamfisted
pummel to the stone solid, utterly mersmerizing grooves now conjured by Plant,
songwriter/artists/multi-instrumentalists Buddy Miller, Darrell Scott, Patty Griffin, bassist Byron
House and drummer Marco Giovino.

Walking out with no fan fair in a black shirt and pointy boots, the dirty blond icon reached for
his mic stand, wailed â€œLet me take you to the movies, let me take you to the showâ€¦,â€
unleashing an almost knee-bending frisson in Zeppelinâ€™s sigmature â€œHouses of the Holyâ€ that
was as innocent as it was unholy â€“ and it was obvious everything the audience knew was
about to go so much deeper. Deeper, indeed. â€œTangerineâ€ became a meditation that
transfixed and transformed, while the BoJâ€™s â€œMonkey,â€ which Plant tagged as â€œLo-Fiâ€ in his
introduction, was equal parts sonic topography surf and an exploration of something just
beyond the realm of white noise.

Indeed, â€œMonkeyâ€ could be the â€œSweet Janeâ€ of skin. Trance meets rural musical sensibiities,
yearning and deliverance stretched across Giovinoâ€™s pulsing beats and Millerâ€™s squaloring
guitar tones, a bit neon underwater, a skosh futurist high beam. But it is in getting lost in the
emotional forcefield, the tug of those rhythms that one arrives at a higher plane.


Higher planes â€“ sexual and salvational â€“ have much to do with Band of Joyâ€™s narcotic effect.
A steady vein of religion runs through â€“ be it the gripping â€œSatan Your Kingdom Must Come
Down,â€ delivered with a ferocity worthy of Pentecostals and intertwined with Griffinâ€™s own fullthrottle
â€œWade In The Waterâ€ interjection, Griffinâ€™s break-out â€œMove Upâ€ and Millerâ€™s
â€œSomewhere Trouble Donâ€™t Go,â€ equal bits frenzy, nerves and breakthrough resolution.

Plant is a generous icon. Prowling the stage in full lion capacity, he sees no need to flex or
hog to declare dominance â€“ yet, nowhere is he more impacting than standing in the back
blowing an intense blues harmonica to reinforce Darrell Scottâ€™s wide-open, hard Appalachian
yet almost elegiac turn on Porter Wagonerâ€™s â€œSatsfied Mind.â€ Scott â€“ the nightâ€™s
banjo/mando/steel guitar/bouzouki utility player, has a craggy mountain voice that fills a room
and can match Plant for power and for pathos.

Still, this show was not a tumble of harder, deeper, louder. No, Band of Joyâ€™s strength â€“
beyond the depths they seek in terms of rhythms, harmonies and emotional nuance â€“ is the
way slow feels intense and quick is euphoric. Like the yoga notion of tantra, which applies to
more than sex in spite of what Sting might suggest, BoJ seeks to immerse the fan in a
complete song experience: feelings, beats, cultures, moments. To be pulled from the shore,
perhaps drowned, certainly delivered is only the beginning.

And exuberance is a big part of the deal. A romp through Los Lobosâ€™ â€œAngel Bandâ€ was as
sparkling and euphoric as anything a handful of amyl nitrate and Goldfrapp might elicit, while
the redux of the utterly frugalicious â€œYou Canâ€™t Buy My Loveâ€ is pluck and effervescence, sass
and vinegar on the half-shell. The latter also featured the Tinkerbelle-sized Griffin â€“ in her
knee high, skyscraping stileto boots and beaded tribal print mini dress â€“ as a honey-soaked
Aretha Frankin, throwing it out hard and letting it land where it will.

It is that sort of jubiliance that marks the thrill of musical consort. To come together, to writhe
in the realm of melody and rock with abandonâ€¦ For Plant, legs crossed like a mandrake root,
body at times bent in half, there was the full tumble to the song, yet an elegance that added
an erotic charge that belied anything more than total want. To surrender, to shake, to be fully
present in the wash of notes is a strength only for those who can be unadorned â€“ and it
defined the man who welcomed the audience to â€œan evening of strings, voices and skin.â€

Harkening back to his original Band of Joyâ€™s run in Englandâ€™s â€œUnderground Clubs,â€ where
stages were shared with unknowns like Pink Floyd and Richard Thompson, the ardor of the
past culled a passionate presence as the Miller-driven dervish-feeling excavation of
Thompsonâ€™s â€œHouse of Cardsâ€ was a howl of Zeppelin-esque proportion â€“ shudder-inducing
and hypnotic with its tremolo quiver and call and response almost Druidic vocals.

Those vocals â€“ at times 5 voices raised in a wall of parts and truths â€“ have a blunt force
trauma impact, but always to a muscular celestiality. Even the darkness of â€œGallows Pole,â€ a
ransom for a man slated to die and running out of options, had a frenzy to the parts that
suggested urgency, yes, but also a desperation that worked from a cellular level. It was nowor-
never forevermore and thenâ€¦ and in that swirling, whirling charge, pulses ratchet up and
the exquisite tension is compressed again and again until those voices burst into one final
last moment of deliverance.

It is an urgency that canâ€™t be faked, canâ€™t be looped, canâ€™t be sequenced. It is what real
musicians, men and women who undrstand songs from the inside out, can coax and tease
from what lesser mortals reduce to progressions of notes and chord changes. Even
something as lilting as â€œCindy, Iâ€™ll Marry You Somedayâ€ is given a richer template of desire
and need from the seamless execution and respect for the roots.

But itâ€™s not just the ability of the players. It is more the essence of who these people are and
the way they come together in the name of something sacred. â€œRamble Onâ€ is equal parts
mystic meander and cathartic arrival; as much freedom and exploration of self as rogueâ€™s
explanation. Yet there was a point of jaw-dropping combustion â€“ buoyed by exemplary
players who not only ignited, but pushed the storied rocker to a place where his voice shook
with the full potential of the lyric.

Still in fine voice, Plantâ€™s performance filled the room with an urgency of arrival, a need to be
free, a will to be gone and the relentlessness of one who is possessed by drives and calmed
only by the motion. It is not a choice that â€œRamble Onâ€ demonstrates, but more an urgency to
breathe and a recognition of what kind of fire creates this truth in motion. It is not tortured, it is
consumed â€“ and never has Plant sounded so compelling.

In the organic reality being created with the not-folk-based, but highly old school Band of Joy,
the jagged places are part of it. To be able to hang onto a guitarline, a beat so deep you can
fall into it, a voice that quivers with sentiment and power, those are the things that make
music at its most unprocessed and raw so compellingâ€¦ and when players this good come
together, it is sparks and fireworks from the sheer chemistry and joy in the playing.

That raw essebtialism is absolutely the defining modality for â€œsurpriseâ€ opening act the North
Mississippi All-Stars as well. Playing as a duo Cody and Luther Dickinson â€“ son of legendary
Memphis producer/music man Jim Dickinson â€“ put the guitar/drum wall of sound to full
expression. Mining blues, rural song structures and gospel, the pair offered full-immersion to
a coterie of unadorned songs that were all thrust, no waiting. It is red dirt, swamp, clay and
dust that swirls across their spare reality â€“ and yet the sounds they generated, truths they
broiled and presence they offered was every bit as big as Band of Joy.

More moonshine than brandy, but every bit as polished, NMAS offered a glimpse into the
haunted places that gave birth to much of what fuels Band of Joy. Soul-scraping musicianship
and singing creates that turpentined truth that shakes you, but leaves you lighter for the
experience. A purgative of utterly enjoyable effect.
