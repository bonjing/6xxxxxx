The story begins with Carter describing him and Sadie's attempt to steal a statue of Khnum, the sunset aspect of Ra from The Brooklyn Museum so they can learn the secrets of the Book of Ra and save the sun from being swallowed by Apophis in five days. Accompanying Sadie and Carter is Khufu, their baboon friend, and Jaz and Walt, two 'trainees' of Carter and Sadie's. However, as they attempt to steal the artifact, Sadie triggers a booby trap and something surprising occurs.
