           Desc: Starred Review Crichton, who died in 2008, was
           known primarily for such high-tech thrillers as
           Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain. This new
           novel, found in manuscript form among his papers,
           will come as a bit of a surprise to many of his fans.
           It is, of all things, a pirate novel. Set in 1665, it
           tells the story of Captain Charles Hunter, a
           privateer who's hired by the governor of Jamaica's
           Port Royal to steal a Spanish galleon and its cargo
           of gold treasure. Don't expect to see Jack Sparrow in
           this story of pirates of the Caribbean, though:
           Crichton doesn't play his pirates for laughs. And
           this is no typical pirate adventure, either: it's
           actually a caper novel posing as a high-seas
           adventure. All the key caper-novel elements are here:
           the target, the mastermind, the plan, the motley
           crew, the ruthless villain, the gadgets, the twist,
           and the turncoat. Crichton keeps us in a constant
           state of suspense, never revealing quite what his
           hero, Captain Hunter, has up his sleeve, and the
           novel ends most unexpectedly. Pirate fans will love
           the book for its flashy characters and historical
           authenticity. Crime fans will enjoy the caper-novel
           structure and the way the author keeps them on their
           toes. If this really is Crichton's final book, it's a
           splendid send-off: something new, different, and
           daring. --David Pitt
