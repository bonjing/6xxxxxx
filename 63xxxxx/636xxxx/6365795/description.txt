BeatportItalian trio Answer42 always bring an air of class to Anjunadeep and 'Dew Point' is no different. Already well loved from its appearance on 'Anjunadeep:03', 'Dew Point' treads a smart balance between finely tweaked funk and melodic bliss - coming alive in an arm-raising breakdown moment. 

German technician Martin Roth then offers two contrasting remixes. The chugging, rippling funk of his 'Morning Dew' remix takes things down an intensely hypnotic electro-tech path, while his more uptempo 'Evening Dew' remix raises the energy levels, beefs up the bassline and adds a beautiful release of post-breakdown melody rush. 

Closing the package, Answer42's 'Clorofilla' is another busy groover that acts as a perfect companion to 'Dew Point' - with some crazy cosmic melody freak-outs as the track evolves.
