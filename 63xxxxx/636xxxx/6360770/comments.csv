Plot

In 970 A.D., Odin (Anthony Hopkins), king of Asgard, wages war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim and their leader Laufey (Colm Feore), to prevent them conquering the Nine Realms, starting with Earth. The Asgardian warriors defeat the Frost Giants and seize the source of their power, the Casket of Ancient Winters. In the present, Odin's son Thor (Chris Hemsworth) prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard as King but is interrupted when the Frost Giants attempt to retrieve the Casket. Against Odin's order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, accompanied by his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), childhood friend Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and the Warriors Three: Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Fandral (Joshua Dallas) and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano). A battle ensues which forces Odin to intervene and save their lives, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. For his arrogance, Odin strips Thor of his godly power and exiles him to Earth, accompanied by his hammer - and source of his power - Mjolnir, now protected by a spell to allow only the worthy to wield it."

 Original cam colours getted life with the dub plugins , particles on the background on the picture disappeared and the picture got clean and a kind of unbright luminosity got substituted for colours with life , a little flashing on the background almost imperceptible happen but not borring the viewer .
Russian audio still for the moment the audio possible , subtitles in any language can be used with a subtitles program making a correct synchronisation when they comes out available .

The work was the best possible under the circunstances and this movie is another Marvel hit on the big screen that will be on the theatres on the us at may,6 .

happy movie ..."
