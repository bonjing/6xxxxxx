Andy Samberg: Oh, dang
Justin Timberlake: What is it, dawg?
AS: I forgot it's Mother's Day
JT: Didn't get a gift for her
AS: Other plans got in the way
She'll be so disappointed
JT: Damn, I forgot it too
AS: This could have been avoided
Both: What the hell are we gonna do?
JT: My mom's been so forlorn
Ever since my daddy left
AS: Cold
JT: No one to hold her tight
Life has put her to the test
AS: I know just what you mean
My mom's been so sad and gray
JT: Word
AS: My dad can't satisfy her in the bedroom ever since he passed away
Both: Hold up
AS: You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
JT: I'm thinkin' I'm thinkin' too
Both: Slow up
AS: What time is it, dawg?
JT: It's time for a switcheroo
Both: We both love our moms, women with grown-women needs
I say we break 'em off
Show 'em how much they really mean
'Cause I'm a motherlover
You're a motherlover
We should f--- each other's mothers
JT: F--- each other's moms
I'm pushin' that lady where you came out as a baby
Ain't no doubt this sh-- is crazy
F---in' each other's moms
Both: 'Cause every Mother's Day needs a mother's night
If doin' it is wrong, I don't wanna be right
I'm callin' on you, 'cause I can't do it myself
To me you're like a brother, so be my motherlover
AS: I'm layin' in the cut, waitin' for your mom
Clutchin' on this lube and roses
JT: I got my digital camera
I'm gonna make your mama do a million poses
AS: They will be so surprised
JT: We are so cool and thoughtful
AS: Can't wait to pork your mom
JT: I'm gonna be the syrup, she can be my waffle
Both: Sho 'nuff
JT: My mother loves bubble bath with chamomile
Both: Straight up
AS: Give it to my mom d-d-d-d-d-d-doggy-style
Both: This the perfect plan
For a perfect Mother's Day
They'll have to rename this one
All Up Under the Covers Day
'Cause I'm a motherlover
You're a motherlover
We should f--- each other's mothers
JT: F--- each other's moms
I'm pushin' that lady where you came out as a baby
Ain't no doubt this sh-- is crazy
F---in' each other's moms
AS: Break it down
It would be my honor to be your new stepfather
JT: It would be my honor to be your new stepfather
AS: I'll let you do my mother
Make me another brother
And I'm gonna do your mother
I'll never use a rubber
JT: Oh!
'Cause every Mother's Day needs a mother's night
If doin' it is wrong, I don't wanna be right
I'm callin' on you, 'cause I can't do it myself
To me you're like a brother, so be my motherlover
They blessed us both with the gift of life
She brought you in this world, so I'mma sex her right
This is the second-best idea that we've ever had
The choice can be no other
Be my motherlover


HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY.
