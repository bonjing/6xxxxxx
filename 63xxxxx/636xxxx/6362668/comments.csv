,kolejorg,2011-05-03T08:18Z,"I downloaded this, opened it and it asked me to download a new codec to view it.  Ive never had an issue with any torrents from this person before.  I hit ok, and after a few minutes my screen went black and windows 7 no longer boots.  System restore wont work, startup repair wont work.  I'm looking at complete reinstallation.  Any ideas?"
