           JIMMY NAIL  - Ain't no doubt  (1992)


      Jimmy Nail (1954) is an English singer-songwriter, actor and musician.He is most famous for his role as Leonard "Oz" Osbourne in the hit television show Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, his title role in Spender, and his 1992 number one single "Ain't No Doubt". Composed by Nail with Guy Pratt, Danny Schogger and Charlie Dore, the song features additional vocals by Sylvia Mason-James. Sylvia is a British singer who has worked extensively as a backing vocalist and solo artist. She started her career with the disco band Voyage in 1977.
     The lyrics discuss a failing relationship, and the difference between her words and what he believes she means. In the first verse, like in the second, Jimmy Nail provides the females line, by saying; "She says 'it's not you, it's me'", a statement which is cliched in break-ups and is usually considered to be a white lie. During the lyrics sung by Sylvia Mason-James in the first part of the chorus, phrases such as "I don't want nobody else, I love you", and "there won't be somebody else, and that's true", Jimmy Nail interjects with "she's lying". This line, like many others is simply spoken, not sung.
