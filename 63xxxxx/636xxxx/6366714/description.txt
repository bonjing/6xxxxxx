UK2000 VFR Airfields Volume3 includes 73 airfields in northern England and Wales. This geographical area is the same as
the 'Gen-X' VFR photographic ground scenery released by Horizon simulation software. Although designed to fit in to
'Gen-X', users do NOT need this to use this product, how ever I would recommend it for the ultimate visual experience.

Each airfields is made to a high standard with photo real textures in many places. A lot of the airfields are totally new,
but some parts are imported from previous work but updated in many ways. Designed specially for FSX, the scenery uses
a lot of the FSX objects and effects, like moving road traffic, flying birds and conventional 'AFD' taxiways and runways.
The scenery is compatible with FSX SP1, Acceleration and SP2 variants.
