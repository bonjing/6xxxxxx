DJ mix for April 2011.

Had a little bit of fun with this Mix. It's got quite a few remixes of some popular songs in there. This starts with a cool breaks track, tends progressive house /trance with some selected mixes you won't generally hear anywhere else. More trance than my other mixes, and a few electro beats in there for good measure. Goes through your standard medium pace epic buildup, smashes some pop bombs and a few other tracks that are driven. Its cheesey as all hell but i know thats what we love!
