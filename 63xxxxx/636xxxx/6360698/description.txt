Storyline:


Ben Archer is not happy. His mother, Sandy, has just met a man, and it looks like things are pretty serious. Driven by a fear of abandonment, Ben tries anything and everything to ruin the "love bubble" which surrounds his mom. However, after Ben and Jack's experiences in the Indian Guides, the two become much closer.  

Funnyman Chevy Chase (National Lampoon's Vacation series, Caddyshack) is Jack, a guy who's found the woman of his dreams (glamorous Farrah Fawcett). Too bad her stubborn 11-year-old son Ben (Jonathan Taylor Thomas from TV's Home Improvement) thinks Jack is a geek! As a test, Ben coaxes Jack into joining the YMCA Indian Guides, led by a wacky suburban dad (George Wendt, Norm from TV's Cheers). Chaos ensues as Jack struggles to prove to Ben that he's not totally uncool! From rain dancing to building a teepee, Jack will do anything to win Ben's approval-and his mom's affection!
