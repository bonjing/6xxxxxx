This song is a charity work being distributed for only $0.99 USD to support the overturning of wrongful convictions of three teenage boys (the ""West Memphis Three"") who were convicted of murder based on their black clothing, dyed hair (only one kid) and the fact that they wore heavy metal t-shirts and read Stephen King novels. The only confession was coerced and recanted immediately, and the supposed motive was for ""Satanic ritual"". New evidence has come to light and these guys have been in prison for 18 years, one of them sentenced to -DEATH-. It's only $0.99, people, and it's not even going to Disturbed. More info is available on the site at http://www.disturbed1.com/splash/

Think about it. This could have been ANY of you who listen to Disturbed. Even me. Don't pirate this, please, if you have any moral fiber at all, it's just wrong."

,imafrigginninja,2011-06-24T19:01Z,"The money is to pay for the forensic tests to prove their innocence. i have to agree with zarachael about downloading this song. it is wrong. just pay the $0.99 for the song. its one thing t steal money from a band but when all the money s going to some people who's only hope of getting out of prison is us disturbed fans paying for the song, then why the hell not pay for it?"
