Review

James have released 10 studio albums, sold more than 12 million albums worldwide, and have had twenty U.K. Top 40 singles. Now, James are set to release a two-CD set, The Morning After The Night Before.
The two-disc set started as separate mini albums: The Night Before was released in the U.K. in April and The Morning After is set for release there this September. The Night Before takes James' knack for uplifting songs about insecurity, disaffection and mental illness to a new level, and The Morning After has an intuitive, low-key 'campfire' feel featuring some of the saddest, darkest lyrics Tim Booth has ever come up with.
