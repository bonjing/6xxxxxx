,JarateLover,2011-05-03T09:39Z,"@lontrus

   The only retarded faggot here is you.(well not the only, this place is full of winners like you) I made an account just to reply to you after reading what a fucking moron you are. Btw, if you're going to call someone retarded at least try to be able to write a sentence that didn't look like it came from  3YR OLD!!

    Are you too stupid to know how to use winrar, or what? Why bash someone who uploads tons of shit for everyone to get everyday?  I can see you contribute greatly.  Not saying I do, but I appreciate what people put here for us, unlike fuckwits like yourself.

    Its people like you who say fake!!, because they are too stupid to copy a crack file over the regular exe in a game. The same stupid people who don't know how to read a .nfo file that tells them what to do. The same morons who don't know how to un-rar a file.

   Thanks for the torrent. In fact thanks for all the torrents you provide. I don't care if you pack them in shit, cause if they make a program to extract them from the shit, I don't mind spending the 10 seconds it takes to do it since you're spending your time to upload them.

   And lontrus, do everyone a favor please and kill yourself. Thanks.

american chopper uplaod!!
PLZ Seed!!"
,auntystatic,2011-05-04T06:40Z,"The problem with rars for me is limited disc space, once I have extracted I now have 700MB instead of just the original 350 download.

Just delete the rar I hear you say, but doing that means I can no longer seed the torrent, see where I'm coming from.

Anyway thanks for the upload

@lontrus
no need for the attitude"
,S1xty,2011-06-19T16:31Z,"@auntystatic

I don´t really see where you´re coming from, no. There's no need to unpack the archive. Just doubleclick the .avi, in winrar, and your prefered player will open it. That way you´ll be able to watch the movie/episode and still seed the downloaded material. Win-win.

Thank you torrentzone, for another quality rar-upload! Cheers."
