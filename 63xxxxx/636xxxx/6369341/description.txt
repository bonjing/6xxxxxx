May 2005 Magma took over Paris venue â€˜The Triton' for 4 weeks with an ambitious, over the top project â€“ a retrospective of 35 years of Magma music showcasing some of the best known pieces from the years 1970 to the present.

Celebrity guests such as Klaus Blasquiz, Jannick Top or Benoit Widemann, not to mention many young talented musicians, gave their all to play this unique music with the passion and fervour that it demands.

These 4 sell out weeks were, without any shadow of doubt, a major success which more than paid back the enormous amount of effort needed to get these 8 hours of music into full focus.

This is the first of a series of 4 DVDs which capture these unforgettable moments for posterity, where the joy of playing this outstanding music is only equalled by the rapturous response of the audience.
