'Can not access the file. Maybe it's in use... Please close the file before patching! Try to access the file again now?'

I'd really like to try this product out before buying, it's the only one so far that has found some files on my dead usb key but all my files were bigger than what the demo version allows to recover. Thanks for the help."
