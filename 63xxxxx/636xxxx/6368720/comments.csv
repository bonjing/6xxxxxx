First of all, the program worked fine in my computer, I have Windows XP.  It does what's specified in the description; no more, and no less.  The key's worked so far, thankfully.

You can choose between Blue, Love, Pink, Silver, Springtime, Summertime, and Wintertime presentations of interface.  The program's calendar is based on the computer's calendar, so it's already set.  The contact manager allows you to import and group your contacts, add pictures, add more than one home and business numbers, websites and email addresses for each contact.  Actually, you can add groups for everything, from contacts to notes or diary entries.

You can switch between daily, weekly, monthly, and annual view for the planner.  You can add tasks, notes (memos), diary entries for both days and contacts, and comments for everything, and recognize the entries by color.  It manages your passwords effectively, and the program can be locked with a password of its own.  The diary, notes, password manager, and file in which the information is saved can have passwords of their own.

It recognizes links to files and accepts file attachments just the same.  The document editor is not very much like MS-Word; actually, it's more like the HTML editor used for writing an e-mail: it even has emoticons.  However, there's no big difference.  The diary entries allow specifications of the weather of the day, or the mood of the writer.  It recognizes your system fonts, so if you have other fonts than the default ones installed in your computer, you can use them here too, in anything you write.

The program contains a password creator, which mixes lowercase and uppercase letters with numbers, in order to create high-security passwords that you won't need to remember later, since you can store them right there.  You can enable AND disable the passwords for the program, but of course, you have to remember the first password you chose.  The design for the desktop notes isn't as pretty as the interface designs, since they depend only on predeterminate colors, but they're useful, and you can choose the percentage of transparency.  You can also set the music you want to hear with each reminder.  It accepts .wav files (you can convert from mp3 with vlc media player).

I won't be able to test the portable version.

Anacondaz, thank you very much!"
