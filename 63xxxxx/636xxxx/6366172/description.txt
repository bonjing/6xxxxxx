INFO:

Time to listen some electronic soundtracks! IMHO there are too many basic 
orchestral soundtrack nowdays. Honestly how many memorable themes you
can remember in last ten years? Of course even good soundtrack doesn't always work
apart from the movie. Don't get me wrong there is a place for orchestral music
but I respect artist who can be creative. And when I say creative I of course
mean Ennio Morricone - THE maestro. 

I tried to focus on orginal SCORES but there are couple of "various artists" 
picks. All the tracks should be ORGINAL and not the cheap synth
covers that you often stumble. A few crossover orchestral arrangements 
with techy sounds also included. I just can't bypass Zimmer! Oh yes and there
are tracks from the selected series also. 

Some classic themes are already included my previous compilations.
