[T],MelloYello,2011-05-02T18:47Z,Your welcome vicerock..  Sorry everyone I have been having problems with my internet.  Bad weather has been screwing up my connection. 
,SdwysWzrd,2011-05-03T04:54Z,any reason itunes won't sync this to my ipod 2nd gen running 4.1.x?
[T],MelloYello,2011-05-03T07:20Z,I had my AVC profile on auto which might be a problem for some ipods. So the AVC profile was High@L2.1  So next week when I encode the next Game of Thrones episode the AVC profile will be Baseline@L2.1  Let me know next week if this works for you or get my next upload which will have this profile.  That's all I can think of on my end.
[T],MelloYello,2011-05-03T07:22Z,I'll be uploading the new Fantasy Factory episode next so give it a try.
