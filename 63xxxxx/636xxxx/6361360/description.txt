After combing the internet for this, I finally found it and decided to make this into a torrent so anyone else can appreciate this amazing book.

Don't remember now where I found it, and I obviously didn't make the scans.

This is the full 'The Art of Mass Effect' artbook that came with the Mass Effect 1 prima strategy guide, it is extremely hard to find and expensive if you do find it on ebay.

Any mass effect fan can apreciate this amazing artbook. about 175 pages.

It has 2 parts that are compressed in .rar and are separate images, but they are all numbered accordingly so you can read them perfectly in full size and pass the pages with picture viewer.


this is my first torrent, hope you enjoy!!! (I will seed as long as possible, and please seed as well if you download :) )
