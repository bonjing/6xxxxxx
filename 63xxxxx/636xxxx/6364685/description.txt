                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Each week a different millionaire undertakes a different challenge. These     
 challenges involve changing the lives of normal of everyday people.           
                                                                               
 Pregnant heiress Simrin Choudhrie, one of Britain's wealthiest women, 
 puts aside her lavish lifestyle and heads for Burngreave in Sheffield, 
 which was once at the heart of the city's steel industry. She is 
 accompanied by a highly trained security team, whose job it is to maintain 
 not only Simrin's safety, but also that of her unborn child. Disguised as 
 a first-time mother-to-be taking part in a reality TV show, she explores
 enterprises hoping to improve conditions for the city's refugees, 
 asylum-seekers and homeless people, as well as those suffering from dementia
         
                                 Enjoy!
