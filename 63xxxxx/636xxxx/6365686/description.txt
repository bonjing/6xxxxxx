In this 1977 disc, Keith Jarrett plays (piano and soprano sax) with Charlie Haden (a terrific bassist who has worked with, among others, Ornette Coleman and Pat Metheny) at bass, Paul Motian (an incredible drummer notable for his work with the Bill Evans Trio) at drums and Dewey Redman at tenor sax. The music is a wonderful, original blend of bop, free jazz, and a little bit of hard bop. Lots of interesting melodies, great musicianship by a top notch band, and some great jams and solos.
