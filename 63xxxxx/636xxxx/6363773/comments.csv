""http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6361670/TV.Shows.Pack.May.01.H264""

for example. I do not repeat my address on every torrent, because it is magnet for spam mail (never make your primary e-mail address public, open gmail or yahoo one)."

[V],twentyforty,2011-05-03T20:04Z,"@htctouch: It is 2h06 long movie. You must look for 2CD versions. I can get BluRay, and rip it, and do encode - but even as 352-480p it cannot be smaller than 700 MB. You can wait, or I could e-mail you links for 2CD mkv version on fileserve."
