Should you decide, The best course would probably be to use Replay A/V. I chose to use MP3DirectCut instead because I'm so used to it. And personally I think it just sounds better without the higher bitrate. The only downside is it doesn't have scheduled recording like Replay A/V. If you do try MP3directCut, all you need is unzip Lame encoder to Mp3directcut program directory if you don't already have it, then select 'voice quality' for Lame encoder setting from within Mp3directcut program settings. Don't worry about the other settings for LAME, eg, it doesn't matter if it's set to VBR 320 Kbps. ""voice quality"" auto sets to best possible settings.

I have them in Pacific Time so adjust accordingly. btw, KTLK L.A. station sounds the worst. Just awful. Colorado's station sucks as well. It has too much compression or something. Sound is muffled & too low. Madison, WI station has stream gaps (pauses) which is annoying. San Francisco is loud but tends to fluctuate a lot & also has pauses in stream. The Portland Station is the BEST sound. "
