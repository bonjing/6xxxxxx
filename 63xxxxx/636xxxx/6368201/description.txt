OK.... I got tired of downloading blank TTT audio files or bullshit files, and username of the RIAA people who posted (usually with a common sounding personâ€™s name as their screen name). They can fuck themselves!  But on to my torrrent... I re-digitized all of my collections.  These are organized by album, track number and title correctly because I ripped the CD. They are all in correct order and the movie file is self explanatory.  All tracks are included. 

Touchtone Terrorists - Appetite for Disruption
Touchtone Terrorists - A Permanent Lapse of Reason 
Touchtone Terrorists - Customer Service Disasters 
Touchtone Terrorists - Customer Service Crackpots 
the Junkyard Willie movie Lost in Transit


The DVD movie is called the Junkyard Willie movie Lost in Transit.  I watched it once and itâ€™s good for a view or two.  I encoded it for quality but at a reasonable file size that wonâ€™tt take forever! If you donâ€™t like my torrents that you can fuck off...it took me a month to digitize all of these. Just remember youâ€™re better off downloading from me than the other blank RIAA bullshit TTT audio clips. Of course you could always pay for it. LOL.
