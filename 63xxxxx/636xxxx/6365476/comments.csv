For example Grey Daze is early Chester Bennington, J-CAT is Aaron Lewis circa 1997 or 96 or something it's not really known exactly when, but it's early I wrote 95 but it could be anytime before when Staind's first album was released as it was hit first band"
,sh0tgunfacelift,2011-05-04T20:33Z,Why aren't you seeding this??
,sh0tgunfacelift,2011-05-04T21:48Z,I'm at 87% just seed so I can finish and seed for the other 54 people trying to download this.
,Criptor,2011-05-04T22:23Z,"i am seeding it, been seeding since 2am haven't stopped once.  you'll get it I promise, I just don't have a high upload rate.  It'll be faster for 2 hours tomorrow for a few hours, then it'll go back to it's current speed, I have to go somewhere and they have a faster internet connection if that helps a little, but i will continue to seed until there's sufficient seeders "
,sh0tgunfacelift,2011-05-04T23:26Z,I was watching you dropped repeatly drop to 0 seeds from one so I thought you were a kid messing around sorry about that man and thanks for uploading this. 
,Criptor,2011-05-05T01:14Z,"oh yeah I did because I found a few more acoustics I had gotten recently and I wanted to get all of them inside this torrent, that's why I dropped a few of the torrents I made earlier, which were 2 total, sorry bout that.  you're welcome for this though.  This is not all of the ones I have as I have probably about 1000 or so more, and get more all the time, but it was a good selection I thought I hope you like them, most of these are 128 KBPS, however some are 160, and I think 256 on a few, all are 44.1 stereo MP3.
