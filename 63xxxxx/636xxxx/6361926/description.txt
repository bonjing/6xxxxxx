Beethoven - The 5 Piano Concertos - Alfred Brendel Simon Rattle Wiener Philharmoniker (Philips 462 781-2)

Though some musicians re-record the same repertoire, refining the same concept over time, Alfred Brendel's Beethoven concertos change significantly with every go-around. One of the defining influences in this latest go-around is conductor Simon Rattle. He's one of the stronger minded and truly collaborative conductors that Brendel has ever had, and his bent toward historically informed performance inspires the pianist to a radical re-evaluation, resulting in interpretations that achieve a new level of cogency over his previous take. Phrases have an even greater sense of purpose and direction than ever before, forming tiny, mosaic-like entities within the music, often accompanied by something rarely heard from Brendel: rubato. At his considerable best, Brendel's playing has a great sense of inevitability amid the surprises that always come with a great musical mind approaching the music afresh. The only let-down here is the "Emperor" concerto. Although excellent, the reading is just a tad conventional. --David Patrick Stearns
