My ports are blocked but shit i seed all my other downloads (Cuz im not a dirty leecher) and it seeds just fine but i cant get a tick or first seed off this torrent. Please if your leeching this tell me if it has started to download. and if it has for the love of god keep seeding. If you seed my torrent i will seed yours. Just hit me up @ tehmadrabbit@gmail.com Thank you guys so much. this is a really fun game low req. and easy to install, full multiplayer enabled etc etc "
