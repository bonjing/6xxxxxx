The AdobeÂ® AIRÂ® Extension for DreamweaverÂ® lets you transform a web-based application into a desktop application. Users can then run the application on their desktops and, in some cases, without an Internet connection.

You can use the extension with Dreamweaver CS3 and later. It is not compatible with Dreamweaver 8. 
Note:  Adobe AIR does not support Adobe InContext Editing. If you use the AIR Extension for Dreamweaver to export an application that contains InContext Editing regions, the InContext Editing functionality will not work.
Installing the AIR Extension for Dreamweaver

The AIR Extension for Dreamweaver helps you to create rich Internet applications for the desktop. For example, you might have a set of web pages that interact with each other to display XML data. You can use the Adobe AIR Extension for Dreamweaver to package this set of pages into a small application that can be installed on a userâ€™s computer. When the user runs the application from their desktop, the application loads and displays the website in its own application window, independent of a browser. The user can then browse the website locally on their computer without an Internet connection.

Dynamic pages such as AdobeÂ® ColdFusionÂ® and PHP pages wonâ€™t run in Adobe AIR. The runtime only works with HTML and JavaScript. However, you can use JavaScript in your pages to call any web service exposed on the Internetâ€”including ColdFusion- or PHP-generated servicesâ€”with Ajax methods such as XMLHTTPRequest or Adobe AIR-specific APIs.
