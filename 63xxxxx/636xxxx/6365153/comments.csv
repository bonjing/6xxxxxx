Try using the magnet link.  That opened the torrent for me."

,frenchmichaels,2011-05-04T09:59Z,always a problem with you man so unreliable
[T],trialNerror,2011-05-04T12:14Z,"french, you're an absolute idiot.  I as well as another user explained the magnet link works fine.  I wish I could block you from ever commenting or downloading from me again."
[T],trialNerror,2011-05-04T12:16Z,Plus I upload to a few other torrent sites.  You're a closed minded idiot thinking TPB is the only place to get torrents.  You're only making yourself look like a jackass loser with your comments.

Ignore him tNe, he just wants attention. Everyone else has a lot of appreciation for the uploads you put up on Pirate Bay."
