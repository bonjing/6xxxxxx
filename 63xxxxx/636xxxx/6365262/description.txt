Avenged Sevenfold, in collaboration with Treyarch, has created an original music track titled â€œNot Ready to Dieâ€ for Call of the Dead - Escalation's Zombie experience that assembles a zombie-carnage dream team to fight against a new and undefeatable zombie horde menace.

â€œNot Ready to Die,â€ the new single by Avenged Sevenfold, is now available for download on the iTunes store.

"Being able to collaborate with such talented artists and musicians was an absolute honor and thrill for everyone involved," said Treyarch Studio Head, Mark Lamia. "We think the fans are going to go crazy over it!â€

â€œWe're all huge fans of each other's work and have been talking with Mark and his team at Treyarch about creating something special,â€ said Avenged Sevenfoldâ€™s M. Shadows.  â€œSo when the opportunity came together to do â€˜Not Ready to Die,' it was a natural fit.  We're stoked to be part of â€˜Call of the Dead'.â€
