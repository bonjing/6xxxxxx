Reduce IT Support
Costs & Requests

Faronics Deep Freeze makes computer configurations indestructible and prevents 
against unwanted workstation changesÃ¹regardless of whether they are accidental 
or malicious. Deep Freeze is proven to reduce helpdesk support incidents and 
allows IT personnel to focus on more strategic IT needs.
Reduce Support Costs

With its reboot to restore technology, Faronics Deep Freeze offers the strongest 
protection available and eliminates the need for IT professionals to 
reconfigure, re-image, or troubleshoot computers, reducing support incidents by 
up to 63%.

Ã´Trinity Valley Community College has four campuses with nearly 550 lab 
computers, and every campus runs Faronics Deep Freeze on their lab computers. In 
fact, any of the computer labs that fall under our care must have Faronics Deep 
Freeze installed. Our computer technicians love it; it's the only way they can 
manage the labs in addition to the user computers. Deep Freeze seriously reduces 
the number of support calls we receive. The lab monitors have learned they can 
reboot and fix 99% of the issues. We absolutely love Deep Freeze and cannot 
imagine running our labs without it.Ã¶

- Alicia McLain, Sr. Systems Administrator, Trinity Valley Community
Bulletproof PCs

Faronics Deep Freeze makes computers indestructible and prevents against 
workstation damage. It does this by ensuring each and every desktop, laptop, and 
server always remain in the same perfect original operating state. Deep Freeze 
ensures 100% workstation recovery on every restart and is the only solution that 
effectively balances workstation security with user productivity. A bulletproof 
computer is your best defense against unwanted or unwelcome changes.

Ã´We have been using Deep Freeze on our student computers in our various labs for 
3-4 years or so and it is bulletproof!! No cards to add to the system, no 
special hoops to jump through - just setup the machines the way you want them 
and then freeze them - thatÃ¦s it period. Every restart is a clean, fresh machine 
and it is impossible to mess them upÃ Ã¶

- Tim Barnett, University of South Florida, School of Architecture
Free up IT Resources

IT personnel donÃ†t need to worry about file congestion, system configuration 
changes, undesired applications/software, or hard drive degradation because Deep 
Freeze ensures unwanted personal information is never retained by the computer. 
Deep Freeze allows IT personnel to focus and work on more strategic IT needs for 
the organization rather than respond to avoidable help-desk requests. Deep 
Freeze users manage up to 12% more desktops per employee.

Ã´Ã since we began using Faronics Deep Freeze 4 years ago we have not had to call 
anyone. Deep Freeze has saved us from many hours of lost sleep and stress, and 
allowed us to make the most of the technology and staff we have.Ã¶
