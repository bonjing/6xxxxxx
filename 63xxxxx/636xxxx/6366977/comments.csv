I am using Core Keygen and it's giving me valid serials so I'm able to go to the next screen, but this where I am stuck.  Is this possibly a new issue with Photoshop CS 5.1?"

I posted a comment for you on my Masters Collection Serials and Activation Blocker torrent."
,hezatuz,2011-05-09T09:43Z,"Thanks for this, worked perfectly until I brought my mac to a place where there are proxy needed.

Basically what happened was that my I changed the settings in the network panel to automatic search for proxy. Then when I opened Photoshop it went asking for another serial, saying the one there was invalid. 

If anyone knows a solution to this problem it would be great.

It appears that other people in my class which has photoshop just downloaded the software and installed as a trial, then patched the hosts file and copied a serial. Maybe that's the solution?"
,hugoseppl,2011-05-31T21:45Z,"Hello RitchieRich,

please, please help me. I did use your skript, the downloaded CS5 master coll., installed as a trial, tried to use the serials of your previous torrent. nothing happend. It says all serials are invalid!
I have to confess before hat I tried to change the host file myself and entered a serial before installing as a trial. But I tried to get rid of all the Adobe stuff on my mac BEFORE trying out your thing. Is it possible that Adobe left something on my Computer that tell Adobe, its just a trial version? Could you please help me to fix that?
I would really appreciate"
,sim1457,2011-06-06T15:49Z,"Hi RtchieRich I have used this activation script with success so far on the CS5,5 Master Suite. However I was running Little Snitch in the background when I opened the various software programs and noticed it wanted to keep connecting to Adobe, various areas including Bridge. I presume this so you can take advantage of auto updates. Being a little suspect I blocked these attempts forever. Did I do the right thing here? Presume I can manually update the programs if and when necessary. Many Thanks for your work, any feedback on this would be welcome."
,knA7ySz,2011-07-11T02:06Z,I patched the hosts file with this but the serial number activation doesn't work.  How do I use this? More clarification would be most welcome.  I followed the instructions in the description and that's all I knew what to do
,sim1457,2011-07-20T16:35Z,I have been using this blocker without any problems but would like to install Lion OSX. Do I have to de-install my CS5.5 Master Suite first? or can I install Lion without it affecting the activation blocker?
