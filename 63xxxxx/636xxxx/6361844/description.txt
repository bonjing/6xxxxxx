An experienced rescue team composed by Dan, Greg and Cath is trying to locate the six women in the
caves of the Appalachian Mountains. Meanwhile Sarah is found wounded, covered with blood, in shock
and amnesic by a truck driver and brought to the Hyett County Hospital. Sheriff Vaines suspects that
Sarah has killed her friends and forces her to return to the caves together with his Deputy Rios and
the rescue team. They search deeper and deeper in the caves but when Sarah recovers her memory, she
panics and Sheriff Vaines shoots, provoking a cave-in. The trapped group sooner faces the hunger and
savage breed of predators while trying to find a way out. Written by Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
