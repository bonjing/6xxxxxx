[edit] 2009â€“present: No More Idols and Commercial Breakthough
 
Following the success of their last album the band wanted to gain a more global success. After meeting with a long time favourite of theirs, Cloud9, they decided to move in a different direction. Together they agreed that the band should do more pop collaborations in order to achieve a more mainstream fanbase. Soon afterwards they quickly began working on the album. On 8 November 2009, the duo entered the UK Top 40 for the first time with the track "End Credits". The track was released on 2 November 2009 and featuring British musician Plan B managed to reach a peak of number 9 on the UK Singles Chart. The single was written for the movie Harry Brown,[2] which also starred Ben Drew, aka. Plan B.
 
The duo then released "Let You Go" on 15 August 2010, revealing it to be the second official single to be released from their second studio album, named No More Idols according to posters outside their album launch show at the HMV Forum in Kentish Town on October 21. The single featured vocals from Mali and debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 11; marking the duo's second consecutive Top 40 hit. "Hypest Hype" featuring Tempa T was confirmed in October 2010 to be the third single from the album and was released as a free download from their website on 8 November 2010; meaning it did not qualify to chart. The fourth single from the album is the dubstep-flavoured Blind Faith, which features Nottingham-born soul singer/songwriter Liam Bailey was released on January 24, 2011. The album also contains a new single 'Heavy' with Dizzee Rascal.[3] The album debuted at number 2 in the UK and was certified Gold in the first week of sales by the BPI.
