But I have a doubt, Is your upload the same as this? - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5582023/WWII.WW2.World.War.II.in.HD.2009.720p.BluRay.x264-aAF At the outset they look different but I just wanted to clarify. And more over what's your source??? DVD/BR/TVRip. I'm told the BR release is on the anvil http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/World-War-II-in-Colour-and-HD-Blu-ray/14400/ Please reply."
,DocFreak08,2011-05-17T22:32Z,"Hi harish, this isn't ""WWII In HD (2009)"" which you linked first, that series was History Channel- production. Your second link to Blu-ray.com is correct to this series, although I ripped this from standard DVD- edition which is more than adequate to this kind of old grainy WW2 - period footage.. ;-)"
,harish7u,2011-05-18T17:33Z,Thanks...My confusion is solved.

,inunotaisho,2011-08-29T01:44Z,"Thanks for putting these up =)

Some details about it, its very much just about the generally known stuff that happened during the war and too bad didnt give much depth into details.
Too bad, since the footage is very good and much you probably have not seen from earlier documentaries."
,_Kheille_,2011-09-13T15:36Z,"Thanks, awesome series, one of the most comprehensive ones you can find !"
,depakdash,2011-09-16T14:46Z,"OMG !!!

Audio=10

+1 for your efforts.
Everyone who are born after world war 2 must see this series. The only way to stop WW-3 is by knowing what happened in WW-2.
Tnkx again for the upload.
1 request - can anybody provide English subtitle for this series (my brother is deaf) ? It will be like cherries on cake."
