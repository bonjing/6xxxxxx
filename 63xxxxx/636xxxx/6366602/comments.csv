Run time is approximately 94 minutes and 11 seconds. It is in 16:9 aspect ratio.

A lot of the music was changed to refresh the game and to emphasize certain key moments, like that of a film. 

---Credits---

 All the credit goes to Team Silent and Konami for publishing this game. I would also like to thank specifically Hiroyuki Owaku for the incredible storyline, Masahiro Ito  for the disturbing creatures and design, Takayoshi Sato for the lifelike characters, Akira Yamaoka for bringing the games to life with his memorable music, and the rest of the staff for making it all happen.

,miketheratguy,2011-08-10T16:14Z,"Essentially, this is video game footage of Silent Hill 2 edited in such a way that it resembles a movie.

It's not just someone screwing around playing the game- most of the video consists of cutscenes telling the story with some narrative-based gameplay showing the main character, James, getting from place to place. It's not just a straight recording of someone doing a speedrun through the game and there aren't icons on the screen or going through the menu or loading or anything like that.

Basically, it's game footage, cutscenes, and music edited to tell the Silent Hill 2 story. Just a neat curiosity for those of us who loved the game and would like to re-experience it without sitting down to play it for a few days."
