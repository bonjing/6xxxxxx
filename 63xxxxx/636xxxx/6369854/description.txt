                      Antares Autotune v7.08 - Mac OS X   


If you need Auto-Tune's world standard pitch correction, but not Auto-Tune 7's time manipulation or other new features , then Auto-Tune Evo is the plug-in for you. 

It gives you all the power and sonic goodness of Auto-Tune's full-featured Automatic and Graphical pitch correction, pitch shifting and throat modeling, at an attractively affordable price.

Buy It Hailed at its introduction as a "holy grail of recording," by Recording magazine (and adopted worldwide as the largest-selling audio plug-in of all time), Auto-Tune corrects intonation and timing problems in vocals or solo instruments, without distortion or artifacts, while preserving all of the expressive nuance of the original performance - with audio quality so pristine that the only difference between what goes in and what comes out is the intonation and timing. 

All with a user-interface that is a model of clarity, speed and ease-of-use.

And now, with its new-from-the-ground-up time manipulation capabilities, Auto-Tune 7 represents the most substantial advancement in functionality since Auto-Tune's original introduction in 1997.

For most common pitch problems, Auto-Tune 7's Automatic Mode instantaneously detects the pitch of the input, identifies the closest pitch in a user-specified scale (including minor, major, chromatic and 26 historical and microtonal scales), and corrects the input pitch to match the scale pitch. 
A Retune Speed control lets you match the retune rate to virtually any performance style as well as create the iconic Auto-Tune Vocal Effect (the Cher/T-Pain effect).

For meticulous pitch and time editing, Auto-Tune 7's Graphical Mode displays the performance's detected pitch envelope and allows you to modify pitch and timing with a variety of easy-to-use graphics tools. 
This mode gives complete control over the correction or modification of the most elaborate pitch and rhythmic gestures.

Auto-Tune is used daily by thousands of audio professionals around the world. Whether to save studio and editing time, ease the frustration of endless retakes, save that otherwise once-in-a-lifetime performance, or create the Auto-Tune Vocal Effect (the Cher/T-Pain effect), Auto-Tune is the overwhelming tool of choice.

What's New in Auto-Tune 7

By far the most dramatic addition to Auto-Tune 7 is its entirely new time correction and manipulation system. Seamlessly integrated into the Graphical Mode interface, Auto-Tune 7's time control capabilities allow you to quickly and easily edit the timing of your vocals right along with their pitch.

Auto-Tune 7 also features the second generation of Antares' Evoâ„¢ Voice Processing Technology, offering even more natural pitch shifting and throat modeling, along with a host of time-saving workflow enhancements.
