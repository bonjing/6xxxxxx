it still works tho. Thanks!"
[V],DeGun,2011-05-19T15:31Z,thx for comments
,drumboy21,2011-05-28T19:12Z,I followed all the instructions but the plugins aren't showing up. Do you still need an iLok even though they're cracked?
,Sabian44,2011-05-30T19:46Z,"Everything installed fine, followed instructions but when starting cubase antares asks for authorization via iLok.... VST-version. Any way around this?? help appreciated!"
,kordtone,2011-06-05T18:16Z,everything seemed seamless until I deleted com.paceap.eden.licensed.plist. The my protools 9 wouldn't open up. had to reinstall protools and then autotune asked for ilok vertification. my guess it's because protools 9 requires an ilok. anybody have any incite?
,sheronperera,2011-07-09T19:21Z,thanks bro.....! :)
,LVYNK,2011-07-10T21:52Z,Hey people Im new to all of this. I downloaded it but can't really figure out what the hell im supposed to do. Also what program do I need for this to work and where can I find that? Thank You. 
,tyguyisfly,2011-07-14T20:21Z,"Yeah DeGun, it works for awhile- then it says something about ilok and disables the plugin options. RTAS. It works every time you reopen a session for about 15 minutes before doing the same thing. This is both with and without com.paceap.eden.licensed.plist 
Is there a fix?"
,calsal,2011-09-07T16:48Z,"Same problems as a few others, I've installed it (RTAS) right and cracked it after the instructions, also rebooted my mac. But I still can't find the Antares in Logic pro. Also the cracked file can't be opened, it's says it don't know which program to open it with. Someone have a solution?"
,calsal,2011-09-07T22:33Z,Oh now I made it. I guess I just couln't use the RTAS version. I tried the VST version instead and it worked perfect. Thanks for upload!!
,Niche5385,2011-09-15T05:15Z,"So im running osx 10.6

In my library there was no folder called ""LaunchDaemons"" instead it was called ""LaunchAgents' but the ""com.plist"" file specified to delete was NOT inside or anywhere on my hard disk as i searched.  
when I opened ableton it aknowledged and began scanning autotune. but autotune screen popped up saying a ilock would be needed to use the program at all. and prevented ablton from starting without me clicking autotunes ""quit""       any ideas?

  maybe i made a mistake. Do i replace the  whole folder inside ""antares audio technologies""  or do i just replace the file .VST file thats inside ""autotune+time VST"" ??    i replaced only the .VST file not the folder it was in. ??
I assume VST is the best to use with ableton. any help would be much appreciated i really want to get this working

If I replaced the correct file. then any ideas on what might have went wrong? or why the file specified to delete was not installed and locatable?   
or maybe its better to use AU? or RTAS? im not familiar with them.  PLease help anyone thanks"
,neothaon3,2011-10-31T21:21Z,"this doesn't work as an RTAS plug, which is the only way i'd use it. so, in effect, useless for all protools users. wait until someone cracks it properly "
,foryouwillneverknow,2011-11-04T13:03Z,"thanks! what i did to use it in protools was follow all the instruction over write them. but sadly rtas doesnt work so what i did was download fxpasion
and wrap the vst version and open it with protools! and it WORKED!!! http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4520646/FXPansion.VST.to.RTAS.Adapter.v2.1.1.WIN.MAC.OSX.UB.PPC-AMPLiFY."
,xniggler,2011-11-08T13:41Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6803084

,PDBaby0,2011-12-02T04:34Z,"Can someone give a more detail instruction on how to get this working on Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2 with Pro Tools 10.

Thanks!"
