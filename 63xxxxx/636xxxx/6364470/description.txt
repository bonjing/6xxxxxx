Dreamweaver CS5.5 New Features with James Williamson covers
enhancements to the latest release of Adobe's web design and
development software. This course examines Dreamweaver's
updated support for current Web standards, such as code
hinting for HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery, and new W3C-compliant
code validation. James also demonstrates the new features
introduced specifically for mobile development that allow
developers to download, install, and configure native
applications for Android and Apple iOS. These features
include support for PhoneGap integration, jQuery mobile
framework, native binaries, and platform emulators launched
directly in Dreamweaver. Exercise files are included with
the course
