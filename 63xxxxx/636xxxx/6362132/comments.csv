,del13r,2011-05-21T07:00Z,How is this 657 MB rebuild different from the 400 MB original located at http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/  ?
[T],Maherz,2011-05-21T13:41Z,"@del13r
This is not the original version which is 400MB.
This is a rebuild, which contains pirated programs that are not included in the original version."
