,longsheep,2011-05-12T10:49Z,"Finally NOT fake... You the best, adnan1102!"
,profyler,2011-05-17T21:58Z,"After all instructions of the readme files, IF a windows pos up asking for registration , just click on register..."
,ssateneth,2011-05-28T04:44Z,"The other torrent with +5 / -18 uses the exact same setup and keymaker as this. This one thoug hhas a more precise readme, and I was finally able to figure out why my alcohol register would never hold.

I have a webserver on my PC that interferes with the alcohol ""phone home"" attempts. In order for the register to actually take and not be nulled out, phone home attempts have to be 100% ignored. If gets -any- data that isn't consistent with what it expects for phoning home, it'll throw out the data you used to register Alcohol with. Solution? Make absolutely sure the IP you put in to your hosts file is completely -nonexistant-. I tried 127.0.0.2 and I had gotten some other respond, probably being thrown from my computer, so I put in an IP that is on the local block (192.168.xxx.xxx) and I know has no computers at the end of it (I used 192.168.22.22) and voila, alcohol no longer is able to phone home.

I have no clue how to configure the windows firewall right so I never bothered with the firewall nonsense."

,LFXTrader,2011-07-19T03:35Z,"For some odd reason this won't install. It says Internal error contact support. I followed instructions to block host, disconnect net con and block the software using firewall. Anyone else with the same error? Seems like a corrupted file but I don't see how that can be."
,pbzone,2011-08-04T08:07Z,"Follow the instruction completely and you'll be able to load the program.
