,whitefang_razorblade,2011-05-09T09:18Z,"@KickassWashingMachine - chill out man, BLOW was mentioned as the source, and sure there was a thanks after it. And 5 gig is a bit much for some that have limitted bandwith compared to 2 gig with almost same quality just a bit qulaity loss.

Most people downloading HDScene torrent knows the fact that this guy can be trusted quality wise.

Thanks HDScene guys for the up."

,H4LFB4CKS,2011-05-10T23:45Z,"This looks like a guy/group commenting his own material. I have never before seen so much ""great"" and ""you are fantastic"".
This repeats it self on all of RajMahals material.
Most of the time there is a lot of complaining no matter what the quality is and ""fuck you in the ass""

FBI spreading material for prosecuting?"

worth downloading if u have bandwidth limitations... "
