,Mrgeophil,2011-05-09T21:23Z,I cen only see the standard scenery
,RJ97,2011-05-09T22:59Z,Yh Scenery is great no problems with seaplane base but at first the other 2 airfields had black squares around grass i have solved that solution at one airport by deactivating the grass at that airport as well as the smaller of the 2 which still has the problem
