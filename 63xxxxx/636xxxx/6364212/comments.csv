,odyssey09,2011-05-04T00:44Z,Thanks for Gossip Girl and HIMYM!
,believenu,2011-05-04T00:51Z,"I said this on ""the man who knows too much but it bears repeating.

 I want to thank you for this and all the things you upload for others. If it wasn't for you many many people all over the world would not get an opportunity to view or see many movies or tv shows. 
Contrary to popular opinion not everyone has access to cable, satellite or american network television.You open a window to us that we would not otherwise be able to see through. Many of us do not say so but you help us see the world.
You also show us that not everyone are selfish self-centered egotistical brats who only take and not give. 
For all of us with and without voices 
Thank you. 
Seeding is sharing. "
,DMVIN,2011-05-04T02:10Z,Understandable. Thanks for yr response
,the_shroud,2011-05-04T04:09Z,"Thank you for GG and Event.
p.s. bottom of your note. u shouldn't have to say sorry"
,jmac85,2011-05-04T05:50Z,I started this download 10 hours ago and I'm only at 30% with 0/50+ seeders connected. What gives?
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-04T07:09Z,"@jmac85: If you run Peerblock and Win, double-click on Systray orange icon, find my host OVH in list of active connections, right-click on it and choose Allow permanently 91.121.1.144 - that's me. Allow me only for security reasons (some people disable PeerBlock but that is worst mistake one could possibly make). If you run other OS, be sure that my server is not in your splist or blacklisted for firewall. Press Stop - Start minute apart till you see my BitTornado (Niagara like seeding).
If your ISP blocks my server, you are screwed."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-04T07:49Z,"@peeyoosh: 55 black&white movies was digitally remastered. Charlie Chaplin collection made 87 movies. So, size of collection seems as reasonable (XviD assumed). However, I am not big fan of genius CC and I will not make suicidal move and change my screen-name from ""twentyforty"" to ""charlie_chaplin_exclusively"". Sorry."
,jamydoug,2011-05-04T09:51Z,"@twentyforty : thanks for accepting bro!!

[V],twentyforty,2011-05-04T10:41Z,"@htctouch: OK, I'll encode one 500 MB 480p. In next three-four days pick up the goods."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-04T13:17Z,@doyll: Thanks. Endgame would be aired tonight (USA). Canadian airings are day before and are always in my TV pack on Wednesday. So it would be today. Sanctuary: read last lines in torrent description (note:)

,jmac85,2011-05-04T19:05Z,Now I'm at 58%... 0/95 seeders. I don't run PeerBlock or any other blocking/firewall software. I've seen your host before and have downloaded from you in the past. Only blocking I do is in Firefox with AdBlock. Frustrating indeed. I'll tinker with it.
,redriding,2011-05-04T19:24Z,Thanks!!! :) especially for Transformers.
