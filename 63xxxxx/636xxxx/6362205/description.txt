The Bundys are a stereotypical "white trash" American family.
Al is a shoe salesman who is fond of frequently reliving his
doubtful 15 seconds of fame on the football field.
Al is terrified of the all-to-frequent amorous advances his
ditsy wife Peggy, a woman who must spend most of Al's wages
at the salon and the mall. They have two children: Kelly,
the stunning but superficial party animal, and Bud, who is
too wrapped up in himself to realize his goal of "scoring"
with a girl.
