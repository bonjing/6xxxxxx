                Series about a murder investigated by both sides of
                the line, cops and criminals, and the opposing
                methods they use to solve it. But the real line is
                the morality within each character and how far they
                will go before they cross it. In the first episode,
                DI Gabriel has just returned to work after being shot
                on an undercover job; his partner was killed and
                Gabriel suffers amnesia with a bullet lodged in his
                head. He leads the police investigation of the
                murdered drug baron Harvey Wratten and finds himself
                in a race with the other side of the line, the drug
                dealers who want to know who killed their boss.
