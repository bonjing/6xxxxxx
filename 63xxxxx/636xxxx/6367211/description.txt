TV Tagger v3


Tv Tagger is a video ID3 tag editor that can be use to edit videdos (mp4, m4v) in iTunes. It is the best video tagging program I've found to date and it works well as it allows a lot of options e.g. Adding a "Release Date" and "Purchase Date" on your videos. However, there are some serious downsides to the program. For instance, it's no longer being worked on, updated or supported. Second, it uses Java 6 to run, which makes it a huge drain on resources.

With TV Tagger u can add comments, artwork, copyright and more to the videos you load onto ur iPod so when you view it on your iPod it has the right information
