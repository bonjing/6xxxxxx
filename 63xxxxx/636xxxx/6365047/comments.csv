,AJNorth,2011-12-08T22:07Z,"Some historical inaccuracies aside, this is an excellent WW II film, with trademark direction by Howard Hawks, a fine cast and very high production value, not least of which is the cinematography by the legendary James Wong Howe; the film's budget was $3,000,000 (1942). The transfer rates V: 8/10, A: 9/10. Recommended."
