What happen is every time I open Color FX to install, It tells me that the app will be installed on Aperture or Lightroom but it doesn't show me Capture NX2 at all. I use Capture to prcces my RAW files and not Aperture nor Lightroom....
Thanks!"
,49538678,2011-05-06T12:37Z,"DeGun.... Thank you for the upload and your quick reply....
The only problem I have is that when I try to install Color Efex it tells me it will be installed on Lightroom and Aperture BUT I don't find the way to install it on NikonCapture NX2. I only use capture to work on my RAW files....
Anyway, I hope you can help me and thanks again! Cheers!"

... run NX2 , open an image that you want to edit , roll your mouse over the ""Filters"" menu in NX2 to display the Color Efex Pro 3.0 Traditional or Color Efex Pro 3.0 Stylizing sub-menus ... ain't there ? let us know . 
good luck"

The only one that is tricky is the keygen for Silver Efex. I wish they had a mac compatible keygen. :/"

So far out of all the endless torrents, the official trial is the only thing that has worked."
,vero33,2012-01-01T05:50Z,"Hi DeGun, 

First thanks for sharing!... Perhaps this post is too old for you to get this message and I am probably really stupid for not getting it... But I am really new on this site and cannot figure out how to download the complete file... All I get when I click on the link is a small 16 KB file (below) and can't figure out what to do with it!... I can't find an explanation for those little icons either... :(
NIK_SOFTWARE_PACK__Mac_Osx__Medicine_-_A.D_Cool_-_DeGun.6368725.TPB.torrent

So can you please forgive my ignorance and tell me how to do it?
Thank you so much... And Happy new Year!...

,vero33,2012-01-01T05:54Z,"PS: I guess there is really a trickI'm not getting as I  got the same thing trying to get your HDR file too!... So what is that trick?... :-)
Thanks
Happy 2012!..."

,Romain60,2012-04-16T09:33Z,"Hello there and thanks so much for the link.

The SN for Viveza is no longer working via the phone registration etc.

Would you have another idea of how I can access this?

I really appreciate your time!"
