Plot
Britt Reid (Seth Rogen) is the son of LA's most prominent and respected media magnate 
and perfectly happy to maintain a directionless existence on the party scene -- until 
his father (Tom Wilkinson) mysteriously dies, leaving Britt his vast media empire. 
Striking an unlikely friendship with one of his father's more industrious and inventive
 employees, Kato (Jay Chou), they see their chance to do something meaningful for the 
first time in their lives: fight crime. But in order to do this, they decide to become 
criminals themselves -- protecting the law by breaking it, Britt becomes the vigilante 
The Green Hornet as he and Kato hit the streets.Using all his ingenuity and skill, Kato 
builds the ultimate in advanced retro weaponry, The Black Beauty, an indestructible car 
equal parts firepower and horsepower. Rolling in a mobile fortress on wheels and striking 
the bad guys with Kato's clever gadgets, The Green Hornet and Kato quickly start making 
a name for themselves, and with the help of Britt's new secretary, Lenore Case (Cameron Diaz),
they begin hunting down the man who controls LA's gritty underworld: Benjamin Chudnofsky 
(Christoph Waltz). But Chudnofsky has plans of his own: to swat down The Green Hornet 
once and for all.

This is my first DVDRip...I hope you all like it.
I usually like a movie to be around a gig in download size (give or take), yet have great DVD quality.
I feel this one turned out great, all for $1.
Download the 60 second sample and see for yourself.
