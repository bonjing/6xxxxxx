,elessarGObonzo,2011-05-04T22:48Z,"getting terrible lighting and shadows while playing. just lines running over the surfaces when near candles and in shadows. anyone having problems or found solution.  have tried settings all the way up and all the way down from game settings and CCC, tried uninstalling reinstalling. No, it isnt my system. every other game runs perfect on highest settings @ 1080p."
,urdethismylife,2011-05-04T22:52Z,"@DarkPreacher

Why did you post that same comment in this torrent and the other one uploaded by a different person. Please just ask in the one your actually having problems with."
,zukke,2011-05-04T23:18Z,"aaaahhhh! Finally, read about this game some time ago and it seemed to be a nice add to the RPG genre! Been playing it some and itÂ´s really nice, maybe not for the hc RPG gamer but still good for adventuregamers like myself ;)

Darkpreacher: Maybe it has to do with yer monitor/graphicscard the game startsup with the highest setting 2048x1536 I think..."
,DarkPreacher,2011-05-05T00:12Z,"@urdethismylife
Cause i downloaded both and got the same problem :D

@zukke
thx will try changing the settings"
,morgoth_69,2011-05-05T00:16Z,COM on guys seeeeed!!!!!!
,xs3ro,2011-05-05T00:54Z,i am getting the same crash as darkpreacher (crash) but i dont know how to fix it :(
,diogosousa,2011-05-05T01:30Z,only 4gb?game is small
,Cogollito,2011-05-05T01:34Z,"Menn, this game looks AWFUL, cmon, we're in 2011."
,BozzCOllin,2011-05-05T03:00Z,same problem here. CTD every time
,elessarGObonzo,2011-05-05T04:31Z,lighting and shadow problem was just AMD_ATI's latest display driver that had come with CCC 11.4 i guess. reverted back to previous driver and when jus loaded the game it all looks good. damn sure looks way better now...
,JuYeon,2011-05-05T04:39Z,wow this gonna be nice! downloading.. 
,majuaraan,2011-05-05T06:23Z,hopefully it has that cool opening thing with the 8-bit sound
,anjumrajkhan,2011-05-05T06:50Z,"after so long time
u r Fanaly backkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

thanx 4 d upload ...."
,DarkPreacher,2011-05-05T08:19Z,"@xs3ro 
i right clicked the TFT.exe then compatibility and forced it too start in 640x480"
,JackiiBE,2011-05-05T13:20Z,"Same problem as Darkpreacher, starting it up in 640x480 also doesnt work.
Tried as admin, added exception with AVG.
Still crashes on startup: ""TFT.exe has stopped working"""
,ptmax13,2011-05-05T16:09Z,"I'm having the same problem with the guys above. Game is starting up fine, shows a screen with mountains and the cursor, then after one or two seconds it crashes.
Every time the same. I changed the compatibility settings, nothing.
There is a slight chance that the problem is with our systems, but we are many facing this, so I'll go with a crack failure. Hope to see a crackfix soon if that's the case..."
,abanaisme,2011-05-05T16:14Z,"For the ones with crash problem, try to start the game in window mode. I know you can do that by editing the shortcut of the exe, but i dont know what to write there. Maibe some other person can help you with that."
,Dimmis80,2011-05-05T16:30Z,RAZOR-RAZOR-RAZOR....God bless Razor 1911.Welcome back Dudes.:)
,JackiiBE,2011-05-05T17:42Z,"@ abanaisme
Doesn't help."
,majuaraan,2011-05-05T19:22Z,"I'll seed when im don....oh wait I've already Uloaded 16 GB and Im @ 80%...well i gues tis better to give then recieve...cause I wouldn't call 25kb/s recieving, more like barley surviving...anyway thanx for the upload RZR1911/Xtrmzone"
,Rohan151,2011-05-05T19:43Z,"Not a bad little game... it certainly has it's issues though. The graphics have textures and seeming polygonal counts that wouldn't have looked out of place back in 2004, they have inverted the up/down movement of the mouse and you cannot change it back - in fact, you can't assign any command to the mouse at all. 

It plays solidly, but the inverted mouse issue is enough to stop me from playing until it's resolved."
,Insomneac,2011-05-06T08:26Z,"I believe this game hasn't been cracked properly.

One of the bosse's health keeps replenshing, and it looks like a SecuROM trigger."
,JackiiBE,2011-05-06T12:31Z,For some reason the game works when my USB headset is not plugged in (G35).
,Slayer61,2011-05-06T16:13Z,Am I the only one getting the 'Product key' problem? Even though I replaced the .exe's?
,Slayer61,2011-05-06T16:26Z,The game works absolutely perfect. No problems whatsoever! Thanks Razor1911!
,lozzer22,2011-05-06T18:50Z,"This game works perfectly, if you're having problems you're doing it wrong!"
,lozzer22,2011-05-06T18:52Z,"@Rohan151

Check the box called 'invert mouse look' or something like that in the options menu."
,Kimberjingle,2011-05-06T19:42Z,"Am I the only one who gets a green ""box"" of sorts? Any one have a solution for this? I've done all I can with the in-game video settings but no result... "
,omfgrealaxx,2011-05-06T20:36Z,"game works great,thanks extremezone"
,smohyee,2011-05-07T05:30Z,"Thanks for the upload Razor.

The game itself was an immediate disappointment. Outdated graphics and blurry cutscenes even with the graphics on high. Audio (particularly speech) was unbalanced and the voice acting sounds like it was done by the game designers themselves to save money. Didn't even wait to see the combat system in its full effect. I quit after 5 minutes out of sheer boredom."
,Sl4y3r69,2011-05-07T12:54Z,Works great. Is it Lan capable?
,SamAres,2011-05-07T18:35Z,"For those who are having trouble with the G35 headset and this game, listen up!

Logitech G35 is a good headset, but it will not let most games start (operation flashpoint red river, crysis2, call of juarez) and many others. I returned mine to the site i bought them together with a long ass letter of rage telling them to stop selling Logitechs peice of shit hardware. 

The problem is in the drivers that comes with the headset. If you uninstall them, the games mentioned above will start normally. But not being able to have the 7.1 sound when you payed for it is like fucking with a condom. 

The Logitech g35 is the worst peice of shit headset i have ever bought, and i'm not talking about the quality, but the functionality. "
,nymac11,2011-05-07T18:59Z,"someone needs to upload Star Wars The old Republic
been looking for it a while now."
,arunder1,2011-05-07T19:50Z,crashes on startup
,gibbsen,2011-05-07T22:07Z,What is the product key???
,dunderpuffran,2011-05-07T22:38Z,does the co-op on LAN work?
,Fat_whale,2011-05-07T22:53Z,can any1 just give me the product key or tell me how to find the crack folder.
,Valmont1982,2011-05-07T23:05Z,"Reached the 4th level, Acre, without any issues. No invincible bosses for me. Cool RPG, IMO, if a bit railroaded. Love the era its set in and the story. Graphics are a bit dated, but it feels alright nonetheless. Will probably buy."
,Black_Guy,2011-05-08T10:43Z,Game Crashes at city of acre
,headZ,2011-05-08T11:08Z,Gaming has gone a downward grade today.
,Fat_whale,2011-05-08T11:16Z,"h0ow can I find the CRACK FOLDER?!""!!!!!"
,TheBoyka,2011-05-08T12:38Z,works perfectly
,reyasl,2011-05-08T17:10Z,"i try to answer at some problems 
look how i fix some of them
first the crack is there in razor folder...
2. Go to setup folder and install/update the directX there vcredist_x86.exe and dotnetfx3.exe if you don`t have them
3, If game crash alt f4 or kill it from ctrl+alt+del then when you start again Enable Subtitles from general after start the game by Chapter Select
when the man finish the talk should appear Exit-Skip do that and the game should start 
3. I think the game have some bug with ati video cards mine is x1800 game little laggy but works 
sometime i have that
http://postmyimage.com/img1/465_TT1.JPG
i fix it by going to Catalyst Control Center and mark Disable Catalyst A.I is at 3D section
by moving the mouse and leave the church the bug should go 
4. If the mouse camera is on invert in game go at generals and at Invert Look make Yes 
Hope this helps gl hf 
any another idea how to fix geometric thing share it plz :) and the last thing be sure you have PhysX_9.10.0513 or similar at some games need that even if you don`t have a Nvidia video card"
,face_book,2011-05-08T21:37Z,"THE GAME IS AWESOME!! WORKS 100% IF YOU CANT GET IT TO WORK FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

1. at first, you dont need to patch this game ..

2. after you have 100% completed download use software named ""poweriso"" to mount the downloaded .iso image, poweriso can be downloaded from http://www.poweriso.com

3. mount the image and run setup, if the setup thing doesn't appear then go to my computer and open the mounted thing right click on the the first templar and left click open ... then find the setup and start install .. after the install is done go to the same place where you runned setup there you will find folder named razor1911

4. copy the tft file and paste it into the folder where you installed the game and overwrite with the original when asked so.. very simply!!

5. THNX FUCKING MUCH EXTREMEZONE, VERY LONG TIME SINCE I HAVE PLAYED AS GOOD GAME AS THIS .. FINALLY !!!"
,Arzanite,2011-05-09T12:30Z,"Holy shit! This is one BAD game.
How could they fuck up so bad?"
,majuaraan,2011-05-09T19:46Z,I can;t stand how you can only walk in 8 directions what is that they need to have controller support
,Bartul_9,2011-05-10T12:18Z,"i have a crash problem at start of a game, what should i do, i tryed everything ?"
,Nephilim83,2011-05-13T12:07Z,Only a fucking retard with a butter knife up their ass would think this crippled pile of horse shit is worth playing.  Game developers have their cocks so far down our throats now that they don't even try anymore.  They don't even bother wiping their butts anymore because they know we will still lick their asses and eat that shit up.  You guys keep pirating the fuck out of this one.  These guys deserve your money about as much as you deserve a nice tall glass of frothy santorum to wash this bullshit down with. 
,Nephilim83,2011-05-13T12:08Z,Great torrent btw. ;)
,Nephilim83,2011-05-13T12:10Z,gubble gub

,TyMod,2011-05-15T05:41Z,"It's nice to see Razor back on the scene.  They have been gone for awhile.  Wonder why they chose to do this shit game though.  Start putting out some real games Razor!!!
