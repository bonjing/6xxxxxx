Of all the acts called indie-folk, Timber Timbre has some of the darkest and strangest musical roots. Creep On Creepin Ons title is no mistake: Taylor Kirk and company take inspiration for the follow-up to their Polaris Prize long-listed self-titled album from seances, witchcraft, murder ballads, swampy rockabilly slow dances, and horror movies. Yet within this black-on-black palette, Kirk finds fine shadings of meaning and mood that keep these songs from being too monotonous, self-serious or campy. Bad Ritual opens the album with Kirk remembering a departed lover, though lyrics like â€œthere is proof in boxesâ€ and â€œI felt your poltergeist presentâ€ suggest she may not have left of her own accord; Black Water swirls imagery of Viking funerals and polluted lakes into murk that belies ages upon ages of weirdness. What makes Creep On Creepin On really work, however, is Timber Timbres commitment to its distinctive sound
