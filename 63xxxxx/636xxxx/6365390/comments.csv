,X_captain_squirrel_X,2011-07-01T23:10Z,I'm getting the same problem as KernowBandit. It says it's missing but its in the folder. Do I have to move it for it to work?
,X_captain_squirrel_X,2011-07-01T23:21Z,I figured it out. You have to extract it (i used 7zip) and the copy all of the files and folders onto your computer. Try launching it the same way (mb_wfas.exe) and it should work.
