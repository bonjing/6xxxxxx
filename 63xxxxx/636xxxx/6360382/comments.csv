,vashsf,2011-05-02T07:59Z,"Suspicious looking he has multiple up loads mere secs apart like he flooding fake torrents  speed.cd links...everything  I have read about speed.cd is that they are an anti P2P site . To top it all off the file is split into a bunch of .rar files 
If anyone has downloaded and checked it pls post. I have gotton e-mails from DLing HBO stuff in the past so  I would be wary. BTW there is no reason for .rar split files the ole ips can't check your DL is BS because u named the file game of thrones, so why?"
,rafael1234,2011-05-02T08:36Z,@vashsf check the green skull next to the uploader the click his name to see his other 1000+ uploads and then click your name to see the 0 uploads by you... Its most likely you working for the man and trying desperately to scare ppl moron

,rafael1234,2011-05-02T10:08Z,just dlded and watched very good quality
,dazmoz66,2011-05-02T10:13Z,i have downloaded the 1st two episodes from the same uploader and have had no problems great quality 
,vashsf,2011-05-02T15:44Z,"@ rafael The green skull does not mean shit.I am being cautious. Especially when the uploads are less then 30 secs apart with mass files. I seed and leech like most ppl and   Ido not bother making torrents. That does not make me ""the man"".You have zero as well should we assume you are ""the man""...moron.
 I actually DLed this and was hit with trident media guard about 300 times over the night...so if  you do DL this torrent you need an IP blocker or your getting a letter from your ISP."
,vashsf,2011-05-02T15:49Z,@ rafael ...your an idiot
