Fix it in 2 minutes with delaycut
http://www.videohelp.com/tools/delaycut
Remelem tudtam segiteni, nagyon szivesen.

Sometimes AC3-s have unsinched frames, you fix it then the fixed file you can mux in mkvmerge."
,dbard,2011-06-07T13:29Z,"Thanks for the sound tip.... I get that error a lot
And OMG you got an absolute brillianty collection.
The Dark Cristal.... !!!!!
Any Chance Legend the 19080's movie is in that pile as well?"
,MargauxC,2011-06-11T06:44Z,"None of these have any sound for me  - I look at the audio options in VLC and they're all greyed out. This has never happened to me before. Any ideas? 

Beautiful video quality though."
,MargauxC,2011-06-11T06:50Z,Nvm - I didn't realise the audio was a separate file.  How bizzare! Thanks though
,jabrown2020,2011-06-12T08:25Z,"awesome DL, but im not sure how to play the file and audio at same time? can someone help me out here, thanks! :)"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-06-12T13:05Z,"@jabrown
The answer is in description.
 Why do I bother putting it in description if you don't bother reading it.
""Use MPC (  http://cccp-project.net/  ) to automatically recognize & play
the external Audio tracks or mux the Audio in MKV with  mkvmerge 
(  http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKVtoolnix  ) if you wish to use other player.""
with vlc is possible too in a few steps. Not as easy though as with MPC. MPC rocks.
You're welcome.

,Kalkkaros,2011-06-26T08:31Z,"First I get video and subtitles without sound (or sound without video and subtitles), then I download piece of communist shit and I get video and sound, but no subtitles. What the fuck is wrong with this piece of shit?? Why can't it be normal and automatic??"
,turgo25,2011-06-30T12:57Z,Bad torrent. Audio and video is corrupt. Seriously I spent hours....tired mkvmerge just kept coming up with error when trying to merge the audio with the video. tried delaycut to fix the audio.... but that just cut out the bad parts.. why wants to watch a movie with missing bits of audio. Also gave meteorite mkv repair tool a try... also just cuts out the bad parts making the movie file 500mb ish. DO NOT WAST YOUR TIME. Do your self a favor and download each movies separately from other torrents.

I must admit, it's easyer to blame others instead of googling for answers to your issues.

One tip; use mkvmerge version 4.0.0 instead of newer versions.  http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKVtoolnix/old-versions#download

For those who may want to remux the files on server before downloading home use portable version 4.9.1.7:  http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKVtoolnix

If you use MPC you switch subtitles in haali, a white with blue icon bottom right on task-bar.

Nobody thought me me when I was a newbie, just Google...

With your lazy attitudes you'll never reach anything in life, bitching others instead of fixing the problem by yourselves. 

It's not this torrent's fault that you can't use delaycut and other programs.
Here you got the oportunity to download only the audio you want. Not the case with a full Blu-ray or dvd.
fix it.


A cool torrent with interesting reading for you guys

,lajos12345,2012-01-22T08:34Z,"A magyar hangokkal baj van - legalÃ¡bbis az elsÅ‘ kÃ©t rÃ©sznÃ©l mindenkÃ©pp, ezeket nÃ©ztem meg eddig. HiÃ¡ba prÃ³bÃ¡lom a delaycut-tal kijavÃ­tani Ã©s utÃ¡na Ã¶sszefÅ±zni a filmmel, sajnos a mozi vÃ©ge felÃ© egyre jobban, egyre zavarÃ³bban el fog csÃºszni a kÃ©ptÅ‘l. Aki audio programokkal varÃ¡zsol, vagy napi szinten dolgozik ilyesmivel, az biztosan ki tudnÃ¡ javÃ­tani, de aki nem, annak nem Ã©ri meg letÃ¶lteni ezt a torrentet, ha magyarul szeretnÃ© megnÃ©zni az epizÃ³dokat.

,lajos12345,2012-01-22T08:37Z,"Hungarian sound can't be fixed with delaycut, at least not for humans. Maybe audio wizards can make it, but not normal users. It will be out of syncron at the end of the movie."
,pmanstuff,2012-03-01T20:52Z,Uploading baby 1mb/s that should help. Kids will love this.
