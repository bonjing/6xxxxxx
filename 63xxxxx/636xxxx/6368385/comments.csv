,Xaw,2011-05-05T13:03Z,"Anyone else having a problem with the keygen? I think it's broken or something. It just has 2 fields: 1 for name, 1 for email...

No other buttons or UI elements. Nothing to click except for a ""credits"" button in the lower-right corner, not even an exit button. And according to Rainlendar's registration procedure, it doesn't look like it accepts a text key anyway; it opens up a file browser dialog, asking you to point it to a ""*.r2lic"" file..."

,Xaw,2011-05-05T13:10Z,"Sorry for double post... finally, I've already download several copies from different sites and the keygen runs the same for me, even when I mess with it in compatibility mode. If it's working for anyone else, can you post a link to a random-generated reg file for me? Thanks..."
,ryder1954,2011-05-05T14:00Z,"Thanks for this working good.
Copy the keygen.exe to the install folder hit generate a wee box will pop up to say it has copied license and then exit key gen"
,Xaw,2011-05-05T14:58Z,"That's the thing; this keygen and all the others I've downloaded from the same release don't have a Generate button... Just 2 fields for name and email. Tried to post a screenshot but TPB won't let me put a link in here... Lemme try this:

,PatrickIV,2011-07-11T21:13Z,Did anyone come up with a solution on how to insert the key?
,BlackAL66,2011-12-29T03:46Z,"I have the same Problem as Xaw. The keygen looks exactly as his on the screenshot. No ""Generate"" Button. Please help..."
,pcosteira,2012-03-13T23:48Z,"Not working!
I can generate a license but the program still says  ""You Have to buy the full version"""
