performances at The Fringe and the Glasgow International Comedy
Festival based on his successful 2006 podcast Limmy's World of Glasgow.
Several of the characters seen in Limmy's Show were originally
created through this podcast, including Jacqueline McCafferty, Wee
Gary and Dee Dee. The first series, which was approved following a
successful pilot in February 2009, first aired on 11 January 2010
and ran weekly for six episodes.
