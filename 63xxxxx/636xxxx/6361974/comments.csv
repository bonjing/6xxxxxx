,nexvotum,2011-05-30T00:43Z,What the hell do some people expect from a movie that hasn't been out for more than a month?! It's a good quality vid for the date it s been released! If it s too hard to comprehend then just wait another 3 months noobs! :/
,frm42,2011-05-30T21:47Z,"Let's remember folks, that someone is sneaking a camera into a theater to film movies for us. What we are doing is highly ""frowned upon"" (to be poliet). If you want perfect quality, spend the $10 to see it in theaters or wait for DVD. Yes, rate uploads, but don't slam them. It could not be available at all."
,frm42,2011-05-30T22:17Z,Looks fabulous to me. Thanks for the upload!
