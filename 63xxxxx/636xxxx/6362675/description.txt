"To Love and Die in L.A."

While investigating the shooting death of 
her ex-partner in New York, Beckett comes 
to believe the suspect has fled to Los 
Angeles. Against orders, she travels to 
L.A., going renegade to track down the 
killer, with Castle unexpectedly along for 
the ride. As they dig deeper into the 
motives, they uncover a trail that leads 
from a rooftop pool in Hollywood to the 
sandy beach of Santa Monica. Along the way, 
they visit the set of the "Heat Wave" movie 
(based on Castle's book) and enlist the 
cast to help break the case. But as they 
get closer to apprehending the killer, 
Castle begins to wonder whether Beckett is 
out for justice -- or revenge.

Enjoy :)
