The combination of music, visuals, and the artist's commentary makes for compelling entertainment in Tori Amos - Video Collection: Fade to Red. Spanning Amos' entire career (from 1992's Little Earthquakes through 2005's The Beekeeper) and compiled on a two-disc set, these 19 videos feature some very striking images: the decidedly weird special effects in "A Sorta Fairytale," making Amos and actor Adrien Brody's heads appear where knees and hands ought to be; the bound and blindfolded Amos in the dark and disturbing "Spark"; Spanish women lying in the street as a handsome priest passes among them in "Past the Mission"; the slow-motion riot scenes in "1000 Oceans," Amos' response to the 1992 Los Angeles riots. But the singer-songwriter-pianist's breathy commentary track is as the dramatic as the videos themselves. Usually referring to herself in the third person, Amos admits to "a fascination with the beheading of Anne Boleynâ€¦ the illicit mistress of the Protestant reformation," identifies with "the Black Madonna, the independent womanâ€¦ who is being shamed for her sensuality," describes the "Cornflake Girl" video as "evil on a playgroundâ€¦ sort of Mean Girls before there was Mean Girls," and regularly references mythology. What she doesn't explain is why the same bonus features (two extra tracks and a making-of featurette) appear on both discs, or why a couple of fan favorites (like "Strange Little Girl") aren't included at all.
