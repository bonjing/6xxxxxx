Win 7 Professional brings you right to your desktop! It is the most realistic Windows 7 theme out there. It all starts with the start bar of course! The start menu has a total of 14 icons, 6 of them are user defined. Also the start bar contains the text of icon 1 perfect for weather apps or Meterberry. Then there is a pop up window. By clicking/tapping the explorer icon in the start bar it brings up that window with 8 user defined icons. This also has icon 1 text for easy viewing of weather or battery percentage from Meterberry. Final the widgets on the right side of the screen are clock, media, my notes, and icon 1 on app screen. You can hide these icon my tapping the notification area on storm. Trackpad devices (X) hides the widgets and (Z) shows them.
