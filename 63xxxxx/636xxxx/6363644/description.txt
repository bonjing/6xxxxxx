[color=yellow]NOTES:[/color]

IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Thor 2011 

Here we go with our V1 of Thor....for this we used cinedubs video,which was half decent but had faults
like normaly with theirs :( ....yes the dreaded flicker 
Now the flicker isn't has bad as some of theirs and only happens now and again and now from start to end...
Also because they've used an auto white filter ....on some scenes you get a blue hue over the screen.
Right fixed video by resizing,fixing colours best we could ...and also lowered the chroma,also messed with the 
brightness and contrast levels and also made it duller to tone down the glares it had.
Audio we synced but never had full credits so we had to cut them...hence the runtime being shorter....but we did leave
the after credit scene ;-)

For now this will do most ....specially those that moan it doesn't work on their ps3's as this one works in the toastie or
microwave and most users have one of them ;-)
Oh also convert the line audio to DTS 69.1 for those that get the 69.1 surround sound in the future ....so this is future proof
aswell ....so ladies and gentleman,boys and girls ....enjoy this fecking shite film 

:)
