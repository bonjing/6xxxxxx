Contrary to popular opinion not everyone has access to cable, satellite or american network television.You open a window to us that we would not otherwise be able to see through. Many of us do not say so but you help us see the world.
You also show us that not everyone are selfish self-centered egotistical brats who only take and not give. 
For all of us with and without voices 
Thank you. 
Seeding is sharing. "
