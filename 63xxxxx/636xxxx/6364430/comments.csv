,TempDude29,2011-05-03T22:00Z,I'll be seeding with a speed of around 1 mb per second for most of the day. (not during night though)
,TempDude29,2011-05-03T22:32Z,"If you want a complete filelist before downloading, go to ""torrentz dot eu"", do a search for this torrent and you should see a complete filellist."
,TempDude29,2011-05-04T10:47Z,"For the odd chance you are NOT trolling or trying to start a useless political debate: The Osprey series features books on historical eras/topics. 
The average Osprey book is not the most detailed on any featured subject, but its not meant to be."

,honggg,2011-07-25T06:43Z,Hi there! I have downloaded some books but I am unable to open it using adobe reader although they are of pdf format :( Does anyone knows the problem? thanks!
,Jlee90,2011-08-09T09:18Z,"Thanks man :), really nice collection though I'm personally only interested in the modern warfare ones. "
,abstractthreat,2011-08-28T17:46Z,Stuck at just under 34%. Please seed! There's a lot of good stuff on here!
,TempDude29,2011-09-05T13:16Z,"If I could seed more I would, but as it is my harddrive crashed some time ago and a huge portion of my books were lost. Ive only just now begun to rebuild my library.
If I do another share it wont be this particular torrent but rather individual ""eras"" such as World war 2 book torrent, Roman Empire torrents etc etc."
,shimmerknight,2011-09-18T14:57Z,"Thnx 4 the excellent torrent - been downloading for a while now ;-)

Unfortunately ""Osprey Series - World History\Japanese Topics - 710-1877 AD\Osprey - Warrior 064 - Ninja AD1460-1650.pdf"" has a few missing pages 10-11, 24-25. 
Any chance of anyone being able to fix that?
(if yes: tnx in advance :)"
