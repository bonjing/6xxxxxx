This is my entire Osprey book collection. 

It is NOT rared or zipped. You can download whichever file you want from this large torrent.

I\\\'ve tried to sort it as logically as I can in specific era folders. This sorting might not be to everyones liking but I couldn\\\'t give a rats ass of your opinion.

Anyways, my collection is by far the most complete collection of Osprey books that I\\\'ve personally come across on the internet as of 2011-05-03 when I\\\'m writing this description. I do not claim this collection to be complete, only very extensive as compared to whats out there as of this date.

The contents of the torrent is sorted by specific areas of interest rather than filenames. (the Campaign files arent in the same folder for instance but in World War 1 and 2, American Civil War, Japan/Samurai, 18th century wars,  etc etc).

Apologies for any duplicate files that might have slipped through.

Also note Osprey released several books on how to paint era-specific plastic models, several of which is included.
