Justified is an American television drama series created by Graham Yost based on the fictional character Raylan Givens, a U.S. Marshal, from Elmore Leonard's novels Pronto and Riding the Rap and his short story "Fire in the Hole". The series is set in the city of Lexington, Kentucky and the hill country of Eastern Kentucky, specifically in and around Harlan. Timothy Olyphant portrays Givens, a tough, southern-bred federal lawman, enforcing his own brand of - at times - extralegal justice.

Justified premiered on March 16, 2010, on the FX network. In Canada, Justified airs on Super Channel. Having, according to Metacritic, garnered "universal acclaim", the show was renewed for a second season, which premiered on February 9, 2011. A third season of 13 episodes was announced on March 29, 2011.
