,groundbreaker59,2011-05-08T21:15Z,Thx mate;) excellent done 
,mattysin,2011-05-09T09:50Z,program works good but the problem is it is only in demo mode. the reg file has been blacklisted so it wont allow full version
[V],DeGun,2011-05-19T15:28Z,Mattysin :  why do you allow the app to call home ?
,Bl4zed420,2011-07-21T22:57Z,"DeGun: License Key is Black-Listed and App was blocked from TCP/UDP Connections so therefore app did not call home, and key is blacklisted at Application level."
,DragonFCP,2011-11-09T22:43Z,thanks
,ImpU,2011-11-26T22:05Z,"For the record, this does work just fine. You obviously didn't block it from calling home as well as you think you did mattysin and Bl4zed420."
,Karolus-I,2012-01-17T01:51Z,"If you use the license file with a version of this software newer than the one that comes with this torrent, it's blacklisted at app level."
,Karolus-I,2012-01-17T01:55Z,"Sorry, I was mistaken. 

I will see if the application needs to not have internet access to accept the license file."
,meerc1,2012-01-25T07:00Z,"Great Job Bro.
FlashBoot is really useful software if you wanna boot from flashdrive."
,pirata_ako_tae,2012-01-31T07:40Z,"Dude FlashBoot 2.1n is out, can you make this torrent please"
,nomad169,2012-02-24T10:43Z,Thank you uploader..
,wthrman,2012-04-29T02:36Z,"I'm having the same issue--my computer was physically disconnected from internet access when I installed it, I did not run it until I copied the keyfile into the program's directory, and it's giving me the keyfile blacklisted message and will only run in demo mode. Has anyone had any success with this? The most plausible reason I can think of as to why the keyfile isn't working is that the program in the torrent is not the original program that the keyfile is for. Has anyone been able to crack this program or create a keygen for it? I looked at the code in OllyDbg and it is insanely complex...whoever programmed this thing was damn good."
