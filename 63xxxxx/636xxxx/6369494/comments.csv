,hejwazzup,2011-05-08T00:06Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD! 
The beginning of the film is missing. About 5 min is missing. The 720p version is ok though"
,Darthdrinker,2011-05-08T23:24Z,"Hmm did not notice the beginning was missing. The video and audio quality is TOP notch, both 9/10. Again, after reading the comment about the first part missing I watched that part again. There may be 1 or two minutes missing but you don't miss out on any important info and the rest of the movie is great. Thanks!"

Bullshit, how can you write that you don't miss out on anything??????? You miss a whole scene by downloading this shit! Yes the quality is good, but I prefer a full movie isntead of some cut shit.
If u don't believe it, just download the 720 version in the Top 100 and you'll see"
,Kronos666,2011-05-14T14:32Z,this is not 1080p.....1920x1040 
,johne86,2011-05-21T09:54Z,"Overlooked the comments and I realized my mistake by doing so, thank god that i have a really fast connection which didn't waste much of my time or else i would have gone batshit insane."
,below90hz,2011-05-25T04:57Z,"beginning IS missing, and I would not wanna watch this movie not knowing what happened in the first few minutes. find another torrent."
