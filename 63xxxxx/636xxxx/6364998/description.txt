From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with Council on Foreign Relations member Steve R. Pieczenik, who served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under Henry Kissinger, Cyrus Vance, and James Baker. In April 2002, Pieczenik told the Alex Jones Show that Bin Laden had already been "dead for months". 


Alex also talks with former Pakistani ISI chief Hamid Gul for a second time following the alleged assassination of Osama bin Laden. 


Alex talks with Owen J.J. Stone of OhDoctah.com and independent journalist James Corbett of the Corbett Report. 


Alex covers the latest on the Osama bin Laden assassination spectacle.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
