[V],extremezone,2011-05-04T12:59Z,"yeah...out of sync , wait for proper/1gb file/hd , DEFACED maybe if you read this please learn to sync a file"
,memito3,2011-05-04T13:06Z,wow thanks
,memito3,2011-05-04T13:08Z,Defaced is usually a very good source. shame on the sync issues.
,Rapier_Wit,2011-05-04T13:17Z,Decent copy if you're not fussed about it being a bit oos.
,DJ__LG,2011-05-04T15:11Z,cant VLC just adjust it?
,richardpa,2011-05-04T15:58Z,"Proper DVDRip and a fast download...
A/8
V/9
The audio is slightly out of sync but was easily adjusted with the VLC Player (+0.300's) brought it back into sync...
Many Thanx to extremezone and DEFACED for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)

If youâ€™re a noob or youâ€™re just not sure how to use the VLC Audio Synchronization here's a quick run through... Start the movie and then go to the tool bar and left click on ""tools"", go down to ""Track Synchronizationâ€ and left click on that, the file page should show up as ""synchronization"", just go down to the ""Audio/Video"" section and adjust the ""Advance of audio over video"" by either clicking the arrow up (+0.100's) or down (-0.100's) until you have in-lined the audio with the video... Hope this helps..."

Thanks for the up, but it's ridiculous how much shitty shit hollywood makes these days. one piece after another. just never stops. are movies like these even profitable?"
