The neighboring gardens of Montague and Capulet are at war, but the gnomes,
Gnomeo and Juliet, are in love. 

Uploader Note: I don't know if it's oos as the "i am number four" encode because 
i don't have the file on my pc-it's on seedbox but DEFACED have
a low trusted level for a scene group so if you don't like the quality wait for hd/1 gb version
Original release name:Gnomeo.Juliet.DVDRip.XviD-DEFACED-nuked for 
mistagged_should.be.Gnomeo.and.Juliet-this say's all about this group-but hey it's free...
