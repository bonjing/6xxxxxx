I'm the only seeder right now, so please help me when you have the entire file and seed. I go to school and have limited Internet access at home.
Thanks!"
,bidawi,2011-05-03T07:20Z,Less than half a MB and no seeders. So sad. (;-{
,drumrobot,2011-05-03T18:21Z,Damn it... comments aren't working.
,drumrobot,2011-05-03T18:22Z,"
Sorry about the lack of seeders... I'm at school, and I seem to be unable to upload. In my defense, I've already seeded at a 2.477 ratio (upload:download), so it's not like I haven't been trying.
I'll (probably) be able to continue uploading in ~5 hours."

They might pull it down, but I doubt that they will.

Please reply to tell me if it works or not."
