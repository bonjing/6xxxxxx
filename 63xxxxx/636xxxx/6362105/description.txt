Arcee and Jack go on a routine recon mission, in the woods. But, they find a Cybertronian spaceship, 
and Arcee goes investigating the it. Afterwards Arcee tells Jack she knows who the ship belongs to. 
A flashback reveals a mysterious female Cybertronian stabbing another Cybertronian. 
She attempts in vain to contact base to request a Groundbridge. Leaving Jack by the ship, 
Arcee walks out into the trees to find a trail left by her mystery assailant, 
and again flashes back when she had been captured. Jack interrupts her, 
and she transforms before driving them both at high speed through the trees for a distance. 
When she still can't contact base, she drops Jack off on the other side of a deep crevasse and heads back. 
Jack starts climbing down the side of the crevasse. Arcee, scouting among the trees, 
finds a tree stump covered in an acidic compound, and has another flashback. Arcee radios Tailgate, 
a member of the Delta Team and her partner, for help. Until, she is globbed with webbing 
and then held capture by the female Cybertronian. Elsewhere, the exact same Cybertronian moves 
in on an unsuspecting camper in a tent. As she jumps to strike, she is tackled by Arcee, 
and the pair roll downhill to a clearing. Amused to be reunited with the Autobot after all this time, 
she is identified to be Airachnid, a spider-like Decepticon. Then she later reveals her new hobby: 
collecting the heads of endangered species, though most of them weren't endangered until she got to them. 
Now she has her sights set on a human for her next trophy. Arcee begins fighting her, but Jack arrives, 
distracting Arcee long enough for Airachnid to web her to a nearby rock. Arcee cuts her arm free and 
zaps Airachnid before informing Jack that he's more a liability than a partner, however Jack doesn't believe her. 
But, Arcee has another flashback. Finding Arcee a tough nut to crack, Airachnid has a couple of Vehicons drag in Tailgate. 
Arcee, however much she wants to save her partner, doesn't know the attack coordinates, and Airachnid kills Tailgate. 
Airachnid recovers from being shot and says she's heard about Cliffjumper's death. As Jack flees, 
Airachnid promises to finish Arcee later, then she begins pursuing the boy. Arcee flashes back once more. 
As Airachnid moves in on her prisoner once again, Bumblebee and Cliffjumper burst in to make a rescue. 
Though Airachnid escapes, they cut down Arcee and carry her out as she tells them she couldn't save Tailgate. 
Arcee begins trying to escape from the webbing she's been trapped in. Meanwhile, Jack continues running, 
scaling the sides of the crevasse again. He pauses behind a tree to look at his pocket knife before realizing 
it won't be much use against a Airachnid. He reaches Airachnid's spaceship and hides against it as she searches around. 
While clambering around it, he finds a Energon leaking from a port on the underside of the spaceship. 
Grabbing a nearby stick, he uses his pocket knife and flint to set fire to it, then throws it into the leaking port. 
Airachnid, now standing on top of the ship, yells his name as the ship explodes. Jack runs away, thinking that Airachnid has died, 
although he is wrong, and Airachnid slings a web on his foot, and Jack can no longer move. 
Airachnid climbs down a tree and attempts to kill Jack. Until, Arcee attacks Airachnid and defeats her. 
But, Airachnid is still alive and escapes underground. Communications at Autobot HQ are working again, 
so Arcee calls for a Groundbridge, and finally calls Jack "partner."
 
[B]First Appearances:[B/] Airachnid, Tailgate
 
[B]Reference:[/B] This episode contains 4 or 5 possible references to the Predator franchise: 
Airachnid's ship entering Earth's atmosphere resembles the movie's opening scene, 
Airachnid coming to Earth with the sole purpose of hunting humans echoes the Predator's motive, 
Airachnid's trophy case of heads is similar to one seen in Predator 2, 
and the scene in which Jack uses a personally made flaming "arrow" to ignite energon resembles a 
tactic used by Arnold Schwarzenegger's character in the first film. 
The title "Predatory" may also be just as much a reference to Predator as it is to Predacons.
 
[B]Fact #1:[/B] The sound effects used for when Airachnid spews her webbing are the same used for 
Spider-Man in the 2008 The Spectacular Spider-Man, in which Josh Keaton (Jack) voiced the title character.
 
[B]Fact #2:[/B] Optimus, Ratchet, Bulkhead, Miko, and Raf don't appear in this episode. Also, the other Decepticons, 
beside Airachnid don't appear in this episode, ether.

[B] Note:[/B] Susan Blu does not do any voice directing in this episode. Instead, Jamie Simone does the voice directing here. 

[B]Spoken language:[/B] English
