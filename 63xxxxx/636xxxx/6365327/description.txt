"Where the Heart Is"

Lisa tries to keep track of Mike's 
whereabouts by using the GPS trackers on 
their cell phones, and Mike uses reverse 
psychology to keep tabs on her as well. 
Meanwhile, Adam's boss (guest star Huebel) at 
Bloke Magazine assigns him to write an 
article on intimacy, but when Callie stumbles 
upon his research material, she misconstrues 
it as a hint to spice up their relationship. 
Also, Ethan gets into trouble when his organ 
delivery ends up in the wrong hands.

Enjoy :)
