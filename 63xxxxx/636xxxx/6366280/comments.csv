,xSumonax,2011-05-04T18:14Z,"What's this 61? Is this 61 individual ISO's of heaps of different models?

Or updates of the same package getting bigger as you find more models?"
,NanoMan_777,2011-05-05T00:38Z,"My best guess:
There are two types of DVD's needed 1. Is the Model List Data and 2. The Model Folder data.
So This DVD 61 is needed and also any of the model DVD's. But to make a full and complete set you will need all the Model DVD's and ONLY this one to make the Data listing.
It is a bit confusing however even in the notes of this 61 DVD it refers to the LIST of DVD by name! Then gives a link to completelty differnet list of DVD's that are easy to find.
So I am getting all the DVD's on that list and only the 61 Update to use for the Information and program. I do believe I am missing something along the way! The RUN program! Because of this I just continue to get what I know I will need until I completely understand it. I know this will work eventually because of my research and the fatc that I do have a partial portion running floorlessly BUT the one I have running is not this group of material. I am a believer! AND it's clear to me other have got it running, just not me!
I hope this helps and doesn't add to the confusion."
,NanoMan_777,2011-05-06T03:31Z,"Why are there no seeds?
I'm at 98.8% and crawling at 900 - 1,500 bits
Says there are 41 peers, whats up? 
I'm uploading at 1.68 mg.. as a peer!
Might be a general network outage."
,xSumonax,2011-05-06T09:24Z,"Getting it too, I thought the Availability would update, but I too stopped at 98.8%.. "
,xSumonax,2011-05-06T09:57Z,Is this VGHD? Or DeskBabes?
,NanoMan_777,2011-05-06T21:17Z,"To those of us who want to get this right and are banging our heads against the WALL.
This is how far my understanding of things are and they will be helpful to some folks, and maybe someone can help me fill in MY gaps.

Everything starts with the VGHD.RAR that runs 29 models, this can be found in several differnet places.
It is my understanding right or wrong that after you have this running, you need to collect the files that are found in Captain's VGHD DVD's 1 ALSO you will need the DATA files which are found in the UPGRADE file, this gets a little more then confusing here because you also need the CRAKED = Crack file which I Beileve is updated along with DATA Files and sometimes found with MODEL files in Tings called UPDATES.
ALSO in these files there are little changes made along the way so you will need to match the proper UPDATES ( or at leats the latest one ) with the set of DATA and MODEL files you find.
If you gather all the above, you will be where I am.
I can run the 29 model VGDH like I could 2 months ago and I have been collecting Model and DATA files ever since in the hope that soon I will figure out from the mix of VERY HELPFUL tibits that are spread thoughout. I am clearly not the sharpest knife in the draw BUT if and when I get this running I will be able to write step by step instructions for those of us who are having issues.
I think it's a matter of not being able to see the forest because all the tree's are in the way.
It appears that once someone does get it going they enjoy watching the rest of us run into walls.
I do appreciate all the work done by the team.
Thank you"
,NanoMan_777,2011-05-07T15:45Z,"Great! Stuff...
A round of drinks, handshakes and yahooo's are very much in order.
I feel rather dumb as a drum..
The installation went as smooth as can be ONCE I got out of the way.. 
People don't think too much it will screw up your installation. Do read and follow the directions.
Mine is wokring floorlessly
Things I did wrong.
I read too many installation help guides when at the end it was always in front of me.

In the latest upgrade you will find instructions.
I printed mine out and slowly did each item as instructed it worked the first time I finally stopped thinking..

All you need is in the files provided by Captain_Cook you don't need anything else.

1. For the duration of your installation TURN OFF YOUR SECURITY programs. I had to tuen off Microsoft essentials and vuze virus checker.

2. I also turned off all the programs that I had running in the background.

decompress all files directly to the end location you are going to want them.

BUT VERY seriously it installed flawlessly.

Captain _ Cook and others , Thank you so very much for your hard work.
My efforts and trust were greatly rewarded."
,xSumonax,2011-05-07T20:00Z,Lol you're welcome.

,haytam89,2011-05-11T00:59Z,"easy guys, first of all, I cant thank you enough captain cook and i so greatfull for your free effort. 
look captain cook Im new here and I don't know how this uploading thing done. 
so I dont get it, why you make us download 9 or 10 GB if i want just one or two models. so all what Im asking here is to upload this huge amount of data in more than one torrent. if it difficult or taking to much time, you can make everyone happy if you upload the torrent in files so we can download the part we want. 
second, guys if you wanna sea a series you cant jump to the last episode. befor you start asking these stupid question go to the begining download the first program its all here: http://thepiratebay.org/user/Captain_Cook/0/2 download the first one and start downloading the upgrades, but captain cook made a shortcut for the new guys so now after few upgrades he put the program upgraded so fo now you need to download the upgraded program and another upgrade that isnt included here the torrents:
upgarded programe: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6362918/Captain_s_VgHD_Full_Ftsm_s_craked_Program_1.0.4.756__Update_(
the last upgrade: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6378783/Captain__s_VgHD_Update_(1168)_a831-b093-c160-d084_2011-05-06.
after that all what you have to do is downloading the model (ther is no need for data file). put the model in in the models folder (its where you open the first torrent - program). and the last step is to run the ""DelModelsList&StartAgain"" (its on the same place the program - vghd.exe is). you may need to restart the program to see the models and that's it.
thnx again captain cook for your effort."
