Diana happily married to Paul, but is always looking for pleasure at the "feast of the flesh ', no feelings of guilt towards her husband. It is not going to keep their amorous escapades secret from him, claiming to be her stories about the sexual adventures of a figment of the imagination. These "fantasies" Paul excite and stimulate conjugal love games. And only when Diane returns from a short trip to Venice with marks of teeth on the body in the field is beginning to awaken jealousy ... he leaves the house, paying no attention to the numerous attempts to reconcile Diana. But then Paul comes to the conclusion that the constancy in the sexual life - a thing unnatural, and strict moral principles are not worth spoiling of life for them and deprive themselves of the joys of love ...
