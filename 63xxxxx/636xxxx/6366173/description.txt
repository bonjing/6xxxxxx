Storyline: Two hillbillies are suspected of being killers by a group of college kids camping near the duo's West Virginian cabin. As the body count accidentally climbs so does the fear and confusion as the college kids try to seek revenge against the pair, who believe that the kids are on some sort of suicide pact. Preconceptions and misunderstandings abound as horror and hilarity occupy the screen side by side.
