After all theses years we at Chess are proud to present the never released 
album that the Rolling Stones recorded for us in 1964 taken from the original 
master tapes.

When the five aspiring musicians from England fell out with their manager 
Andrew Oldham who wanted to turn them into a pop band in 1964 they appeared at 
our Chicago studio in 2120 South Michigan Avenue during their first US tour 
determined to leave the pop world behind in order to pay their dues by playing 
the blues.

We reluctantly agreed to let them tape a few blues and rock n roll numbers on 
the next 2 days (June 10 & 11 to be exact) wondering if these five inexperienced 
but enthusiastic English boys really had anything to offer!

Luckily we were in for a pleasant surprise. These youngsters could really play 
with the best of em! (yes Muddy Waters jumped up and down with delight while 
cleaning the studio lavatory (Until these British Beat boys arrived these were 
hard times for American Blues artists you know) We immediately offered them an 
album deal as the first white blues band on our label that Mick,Keith,Brian,
Charlie & Bill were keen to signâ€¦but alas it was not to be.

In the end legal hassles prevented the Rolling Stones from signing up to Chess 
Records. They had to fulfil their contract with their then manager Andrew Oldham 
and their label Decca,who wereâ€™nt prepared to let them go and then had to return 
totheir native England.As we all know they made the best of the situation,penned 
their own songs and became one if not the best Rock bands in the world.

The band came back to our studios on two more occasions (8 November 1964 and 10 May 1965) to cut more material including an early version of â€œSatisfactionâ€

We kindly gave permission for some of these songs to appear on a few of their Decca /London albums and singles but in were in turn never allowed to issue the complete Chess studio sessions ourselves. What a shame!
