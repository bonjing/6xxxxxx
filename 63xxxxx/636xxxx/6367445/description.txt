                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle sees Stewart Lee perform stand up comedy. Every  
 now and again after he has performed a gag the show cuts away into a short    
 sketch based on the gag. Each episode follows a different theme.              
                                                                               
 Stewart takes a look at the subject of charity this week. He ends up though   
 becoming sidetracked into talking about crisps, his grandfather and whether   
 this new series is going to have any proper jokes as part of it.              
 
                                 Enjoy!
