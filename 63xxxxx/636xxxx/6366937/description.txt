Enterprise Monitor download page.

MySQL Query Analyzer is designed to gather query performance
information from a variety of sources.  In this release you can use
Plugins for Connectors to gather data for the Query Analyzer, or you
can use the MySQL Proxy (plugs into the Agent) as in the previous 2.x
releases.

If you use the MySQL Proxy instead of the Plugins for Connectors to
collect data for the Query Analyzer, be aware that the proxy is
sitting between your application and the MySQL server and please note
the following:

  Depending upon your system load, it is possible to overload the
  proxy or have the proxy/agent consume system resources needed by
  mysqld itself.  In particular, the memory needed by the MySQL Agent
  for basic monitoring is fairly small and consistent and depends on
  the number of rules you have enabled.  However, when the Query
  Analyzer is enabled, the Agent can use significantly more memory to
  monitor and analyze whatever queries you direct through it.  In this
  case, the amount of memory used depends on the number of unique
  normalized queries, example queries and example EXPLAINs being
  processed, plus the network bandwidth required to send this query
  performance data to the Service Manager.  In general, the amount of
  memory used for the Query Analyzer is well-bounded, but under heavy
  load or, in some cases under older versions of Linux, RAM usage by
  Query Analyzer may be too high for your environment and load.

  Therefore we advise you to use the MySQL Proxy agent plugin
  extensively in development, test and stage environments under load
  for an extended period of time before considering usage in a
  production environment.  For all deployments:

  1) We recommend carefully monitoring the Agent\\\'s resource
     consumption using the \\\"Memory Usage - Agent\\\" graph available on
     the Graph tab. You can also add an SMTP or SNMP notification to
     the new Heat Chart rule \\\"MySQL Agent Memory Usage Excessive\\\".

  2) If the amount of memory consumed is too high, consider sampling
     queries during non-peak hours or monitoring only a subset of
     queries on this system.

If you experience any problems with Query Analyzer, please open a
Support issue right away.

For more information about the MySQL Enterprise Monitor and the
Agent, refer to http://www.mysql.com/products/enterprise/monitor.html.

We really want to hear your feedback!  Please see the section at the
end on how to report bugs and other feedback.

Note that the source code for the LGPL components used in the Agent
can be found in the licenses/lpgl directory.

GETTING STARTED

For more information on installation and setup, see the \\\"Getting
Started\\\" guide and the Installation chapter in the  online help, both
of which are linked in the Documentation section of the download page.

Please take special note of the following:

1) The account the agent uses to login and collect information about
   the server being monitored needs certain privileges to do its job
   (e.g. SUPER), along with INSERT and SELECT privileges on the
   mysql.inventory table (as well as CREATE, unless you choose to
   create it yourself).  See the \\\"Installation\\\" chapter in the online
   help for more information.

2) Consult the Troubleshooting sections of the online documentation if
   any of these occur:
   
   a) you have trouble starting your agent;
   b) the agent starts but doesn\\\'t show up in the MySQL Enterprise
      Dashboard;
   c) you\\\'re using the Query Analyzer but no results are shown on the
      Query Analyzer tab and you\\\'ve already waited 5 minutes or more
      for the query data to populate.

Contact Support at https://support.oracle.com/ if you continue to have
problems.

If you are upgrading from a previous version, see the UPGRADE NOTES
below.

CHANGES SINCE LAST RELEASE

New features in this release include:

  o Oracle branding:
    - Removed \\\"time bomb\\\" (no more license keys or subscription
      expiration)
    - Query Analyzer, Replication monitoring and all rules and graphs
      now available to all users
    - Integration with My Oracle Support (see your open Oracle Service
      Requests for MySQL issues)
  o New Advisors and Graphs:
    - MySQL Cluster
    - InnoDB Plugin
    - Network and Disk IO, disk space
  o New Aggregator accepts Query Analyzer data from any source

We hope you\\\'ll try it out and give us your feedback!  However, in
order to take advantage of some of these features you must route your
queries through the Agent\\\'s proxy port (6446 by default) instead of
directly to your MySQL server, or use one of the new Connector
Plugins.  See the \\\"Query Analyzer\\\" chapter in the documentation for
more information.

Please see \\\"MySQL Enterprise Monitor Change History\\\" appendix
in the documentation or online help for a complete list of changes,
including functionality added or changed as well as bugs fixed.

UPGRADE NOTES

If you have previously installed the MySQL Enterprise Monitor on your
system, you may use one of our upgrade installers. Please note:

o The MySQL Proxy now has an officially registered port number: 6446
  (see http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers for details).
  The Agent installers now default to port 6446 instead of 4040.

  If you are installing the Query Analyzer for the first time, this
  port change is completely transparent and will have no impact on
  you.

  However, if you have previously deployed the Query Analyzer and use
  our upgrade installer to upgrade your Agents, they will preserve the
  old value (i.e. either the old default of 4040 or whatever you
  specified during the original installation).  If you subsequently
  install new agents, in addition to upgrading existing ones, you may
  get in a situation where some agents use port 4040 for the Query
  Analyzer (the upgraded ones) and some use port 6446 (the newly
  installed ones, unless you change the default recommended during
  installation).  You can easily correct the situation by editing the
  proxy-address parameter in the agent configuration file:  /etc/mysql-monitor-agent.ini.  In this case, you must restart
  the agent for the change to take effect.

o If you are upgrading from our previous 1.3 release, the new 2.2
  Service Manager requires the new Agent; make sure to upgrade all
  your Agents as well (upgrade installers are provided).

o If you are upgrading from our previous 1.3.x release, note that the
  Agent upgrade installer will delete the old items-mysql-network.xml
  file.  If you have manually edited this file to customize any of its
  data collection definitions, you should backup the file before
  running the Agent upgrade installer so you can restore those
  customizations after the upgrade installation is done.

o If you are upgrading from a previous 2.x release, the new 2.2
  Service Manager does not require the new Agent.  However, we
  strongly recommend that you upgrade all your Agents to the latest
  version in order to get the most recent features, bug, and
  performance fixes (e.g. to get error and warning counts in SQL
  queries in the Query Analyzer).

o WARNING: Only use the 2.2.x upgrade installers to upgrade from 1.3.x
  or later. To upgrade from a release earlier than 1.3.x, you must
  first upgrade to release 1.3.

o Note that the format and location of the file used to define custom
  data collection definitions has changed.  As of our 2.0 release, see
  the new version in /share/mysql-proxy/items/items-
  mysql-monitor.xml for the new location and format.  As of our 2.1
  release we have added an extra file, /share/mysql-
  proxy/items/custom.xml, where you can put any custom definitions you
  create in addition to the ones we deliver with the Agent.  This file
  will be preserved as-is on upgrade, whereas items-mysql-monitor.xml
  will be overwritten.  If you have any questions about how to
  recreate your customized data collection definitions, contact MySQL
  Support.

KNOWN ISSUES

In order for replication topologies to be properly discovered, each
agent must be running on the same machine as the MySQL server it is
monitoring (i.e. it cannot be monitoring the server remotely).

Several replication *groups* installed on the same physical machine
that use \\\"localhost\\\" to identify the master host will confuse
replication topology discovery and result in incorrect groupings.
Question: Is this a common or uncommon setup?

REPORTING ISSUES & FEEDBACK

To report a problem or get help with an issue, please login to 
https://support.oracle.com/ and create an issue with the \\\"Main problem
area\\\" set to \\\"MySQL Enterprise Tools\\\".  Generally, it\\\'s better to
create a separate issue for each problem you\\\'re reporting.

We are very interested in any comments or suggestions you can provide.
We are especially interested in any suggestions for new Advisor Rules
or Graphs (or proposed modifications for fine-tuning the ones we
provide).  Feel free to combine a bulleted list or summary of your
evaluation experience into a single issue (see above). We suggest 
you make the Summary field \\\"Feedback.\\\"
