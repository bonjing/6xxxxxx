I like the idea of the movie, but its nothing new, very smallville-ish. And this trend of movie makers to end almost all tween movies with sequels in mind is rather irritating.  You only get to see one pretty good action sequence in the movie, and then you're left high and dry for the next movie (Probably I AM FOUR POINT ONE)...its pathetic...get it over and done with in one movie.

As far as the movie goes, I liked it a lot. Of course, this says a lot about what has happened to the human race: whiners, complainers, jaded and desensitized, callous and devoid of empathy...all blood and guts hanging from their teeth, crying kill, kill (borrowed from Alice's Restaurant).

,Wake42,2011-07-04T20:06Z,"hey can someone help me.

i first noticed it with this movie, but since quite a few of my movies that i have watched with no problems in the past this has started to happen to also.

i have sound, i can hear music, cars, even the echos of the people talking but cannot actually hear the dialog.

i tried googling it but its hard to filter everything and decide if its relevant or not. i usually watch all my movies in windows media player but VLC same thing happens.

Thanks!"

,ToastH2O,2011-07-26T12:10Z,"At first i thought oh god ... aother shitty film... but then wow i actually really enjoyed the hell outta this movie haha , awesome rip v9/a9/m9"
,BrianBrew,2011-08-02T00:44Z,Awful movie. I honestly couldn't even sit through the whole thing. I can't say for certain but I'm fairly sure that this is the worst acting I have ever seen in a movie. The characters are wooden & the dialogue is unbelievably bad. A candidate for the worst movie I have ever seen.
,SquisheeLOTUW,2011-08-04T10:29Z,"I love all the comments stating people's opinions on the movie. If people want to know whether or not the movie is good, they'll read a review. People read comments here to see if the quality is good or to see if it's fake. I don't care what your opinion of the movie itself is. Anyways, thanks for uploading, great quality. You're the best extremezone."

,relpze,2011-08-29T21:16Z,"i thought this movie was great. people who always write negative comments about the movie need to give reasons. DOWNLOAD THIS MOVIE. ITS GOOD. there, use that review."
,magikp,2011-09-12T10:01Z,great copy thanks
,69dometo,2011-09-14T03:21Z,"@SquisheeLOTUW ... 

Actually, I read the comments both for reviews and quality. If it is a DVD rip, the quality is generally there...

I guess I COULD open up a whole new tab and do a manual search for every single frickin movie I wish to pirate, but it is a lot easier to see 6-10 negative comments based on story/acting, and know it is prolly not worth my time.

Stop being a jackass. People can say what they want in the comments."
,ryaneli,2011-09-16T23:08Z,"i actually like seeing what people think of movies on here. I see many movies I never heard of on here and only download them because of the reviews I see on here that I otherwise wouldn't have wasted my time to look for. The post about people bitching about what they don't want to see seem to be more pointless though. and if the quality is + then its probably good quality and if you have common sense then you should be able to figure out that its not a fake. Thank you to Extremezone and everybody that puts up AVM and your reviews are appreciated. even your crying, bitching rants are fun to read so just keep it up everybody!
Thanks TPB!!!"
,purpILLhOaze,2011-09-17T20:24Z,"Acting wise and maybe even ""artistic wise"" this movie might not be the best, but in my opinion it's a good entertainment/adventure movie, maybe the best for teens and down, but not bad at all IMO. If you like movies with a bit of adventure/fantasy feeling to it, there's a good chance you will enjoy this one. 

M: 7/10 overall for the *intended target audience.*"

,insanityensue,2011-10-06T08:01Z,"@69dometo

really no one cares how good the movie is. we all want to know 1 thing, HOWS THE DAMN QUALITY! so if you want to say ""shitty movie"" tell it to your imaginary friends and cry a river, build a bridge and get over it. SHIT. it takes a lot to get me to post, but damn dude."
