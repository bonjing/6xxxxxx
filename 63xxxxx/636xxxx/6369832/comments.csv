,Xirifus,2011-07-16T01:16Z,Omega Boost is a PS1 game made in 1999. So looks shady. I'd avoid this.
,Navaroas,2011-07-16T05:18Z,"Not sure why I decided to download this, but it actually works. Avast called it a virus like three times and then my computer installed it and it creates a sort of PSX emulator box to play the game with the ability to quick save and load."
,cutctrl,2011-07-27T12:51Z,"Ever heard of false-positives?  
Torrent is perfectly fine and works for me.
And this IS a PSX game. It's listed in PC cause you play it on your PC via emu. At least I think that was the logic.

Going to be seeding this if it works!

Thanks."
,Ghostmorph4,2012-03-21T09:39Z,"Ok, I downloaded it and as soon as I opened it, it said it was a virus. A trogan to be precise. 

My Microsoft Security Essentials then deleted the file.

I am not sure if this is correct or not but the file is a trogan and I am not reccomending it."
