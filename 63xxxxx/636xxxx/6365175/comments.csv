Please consider not dividing the file into a number of RARs. After downloading, you will have to assemble the file, and the file will use double the disk space, which often will make the downloader erase the RARs, which he is no longer using.

And therefore he will nok be seeding, because seeding costs the double amount of disk space.

Even eztv knows this! Single file so we can verify the contents and more easily let others know the A/V quality!"
