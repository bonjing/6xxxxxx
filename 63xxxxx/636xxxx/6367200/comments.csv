And the 6GB 1080p just closes when you click on it.  So fuck this movie.  I'm done.  Christopher Walken, you're not worth it my friend.  I wouldn't watch this movie now if somebody paid me.  Un...be...liev...able..."

P.S: DO NOT DOWNLOAD, FIND A DIFFERENT VERSION !!"
,postbuske,2011-08-20T12:04Z,"All the way at the back of the movie somewhere (DTS-MA track) there is also a massive PLOP! that probably could kill/damage your speakers for god sakes!

This should not happen!
It scared the hell out of me but after checking my gear it seemed ok.
