The publication of confidential cables by Wikileaks has proved deeply embarrassing for the US and other countries. But Julian Assange, Wikileaks founder, sees limitations.

â€œIf we look at our work over the last 12 months, think about that. All these stories that have come out actually happened in the world, before 2010, but people didnâ€™t know about it. So what is it that we donâ€™t know about now? Thereâ€™s an enormous hidden world out there that we donâ€™t know about. It exists there right now.â€

Assange claims the data released by WikiLeaks is not even the most important and calls on people not to believe that the information they receive from the media is all that is happening. â€œWe only released secret, classified, confidential material. We didnâ€™t have any top secret cables. The really embarrassing stuff, the really serious stuff wasnâ€™t in our collection to release. But it is still out there.â€

He calls Facebook and other social networks at the greatest danger for intelligence agency manipulation. Assange suggests that the networks are automatically connected to CIA computers so every time you add a 'friend' you add them to the CIA's files.
