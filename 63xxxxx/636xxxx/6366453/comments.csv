,gavin12,2011-05-04T22:14Z,"Thanks so much for : Glee + Exile!
Is there any chance you could do the Glee series for iPod, or is there an easy way of changing a setting so they play?"
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-04T22:15Z,"Exile is too glacial for my taste.  Thanks for the other stuff, though.  Peter Pan...I would practically KILL for this version starring Mary Martin as Peter:
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054176/
The other versions can gather dust for all I care."
,tylr,2011-05-04T22:23Z,"can u plZ. seed this torrent ""http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6137940/The.Avengers.Earths.Mightiest.Heroes.S01.480p.H264"" for some more time??"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-04T22:40Z,"@gavin12: Sorry, 480p right now is absolutely incompatible with iPod and similar devices.

@tylr: I seeded that Avengers for two weeks and in total 500 GIGA! When I have gone mad about hundredths who have took and run - I deleted it (folder, not the torrent) - forever and ever."
,tbodin,2011-05-05T01:48Z,"hey 20/40 i have been downloading from you for quite some time but never created an account.  great work with everything you have done. never been a problem.  is there anyway you can do the movie ""win win""??? Greatly appreciated"
,cindal,2011-05-05T02:35Z,thank you!
,funpigj,2011-05-05T04:28Z,"Thanks 20, as always.

Gavin, you can use handbrake to convert 20s .mp4s to an .m4v that will play on an apple device (I use iPhone).  It may be blaspheme to 20, but the native settings in handbrake for iPhone work."
,htctouch,2011-05-05T05:06Z,thanx allot sir for looneytunes
,tylr,2011-05-05T05:58Z,"2040:
thanKs for the reply..  if its gone, i guess the only thing for me to do is to reLy on the 13 odd seeders, but the dl. speed comes around 8~10Kbps, also jus 370mb(15.4%) done as of now.. 
..the only request to the 'possible seeders' pl. seed
uLtimately.. tHanks for the share 20-40

..although id wish u hadn't deleted those files from ur system.."
,Mckayver,2011-05-05T07:03Z,You rock 20-40. survivor and mythbusters would be cool. thanks from australia. 
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-05T08:38Z,"@funpigj: Any re-encoding using strict target profile would do. Only my 272p is iPod compatible (not iPhone).

@formerly_azrielle: PP 1960. was released in eighties on VHS only. Drum-roll: I have VHSrip, but it is ugly one. If you want that - mail me."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-05T10:11Z,"@tbodin: When Win-Win gets released, of course. By the way, welcome and thanks.

@tylr: I just peeked in the swarm and seven peers have more than one and a half data volume  - what means IF all wants to finish - all must put DL and UL speeds at 1:1 ratio (eg. 20kB/s DL - 20 kB/s UL) and EXCHANGE the bytes already present. ALL must do this, if one wants to suck from others and give shit to fellow peers - ALL peers would never finish. 

Unfortunately, people do know how to ""leech"" but have no clue what ""sharing"" means."
,abj642,2011-05-05T11:53Z,thanks 20-40 for all your efforts
,tylr,2011-05-05T22:26Z,"still.. i do hav 1 advantage, 
consider this idea, divide the people who download ur torrents into two types.. Pre-face/Post-face in preface u obviously seed, so the dl. speed is pretty High, but so does the Leechers ratio..
in Postface u may/mayNot seed, but thr will be a creed among the downloaders, who really do believe in seeding the torrent for a Long time, that comes with its own problems.. even though reliable - they share in a low speed, but i trust in those people tat tHey wud be seeding the torrent for some more days.. if not weeks, pl. seed fellows`"
