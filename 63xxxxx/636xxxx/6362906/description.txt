    the first setting of kosmoplovci's 'kosmos museum' made
    it's  premiere  on  o6-sep-5oo2,  in  serbian  national
    library in belgrade.

    the  multisensual opening event featured exclusive kdes
    performance  in  open space in front of the library, as
    well  as  kosmoplovci's  video  projection setup behind
    kdes  crew.   2kw  soundsystem transmited 45 minutes of
    specially  designed live elektronik kdes performance in
    front   of   what   probably  is  the  most  innovative
    exhibition that happened in belgrade for ages.

    the  'side  effect'  of  this  exhibition is the 'put u
    kosmosu'  [voyage  in  kosmos]  catalogue  featuring 60
    pages  of exclusive graphic novels and experiments in a
    very bad - almost fanzine-like print.

    put  u  kosmosu  exhibition  presented the selection of
    work  by  complete kosmoplovci group, and the catalogue
    feature  additional guest apperarances.

    ***

    there are very  few copies of catalogue in circulation,
    print release was elusive, rare and hard to find from
    very beginning, so we hope that releasing this free pdf
    version will bring more justice to the quality material
    that contains, especially since the print version was
    poorly printed. this version is recreated from the
    original digital source files for the best intended
    presentation.
