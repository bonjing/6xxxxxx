This DVD is from the new Justin Bieber â€œLive Video Bootleg Projectâ€
It is a fan to fans project.

The creator of this DVD is a huge Justin Bieberâ€ fanâ€ a.k.a Belieber(in my case boylieber)
Until Justin Bieber makes this footage commercially available, this DVD is all we, Beliebers, have to commemorate from the My World Tour 2010 in Vancouver.

This concert was recorded October 19th, 2010, this concert was one of the first shows of the first live performance of â€œSpeaking Tonguesâ€, the concert on this DVD is a bootleg. If not for all the fans courage and creative techniques filming this concert, this footage would not exist.
