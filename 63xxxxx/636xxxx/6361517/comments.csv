,Med1aN1ck,2011-05-18T22:12Z,"The quality of this video is crap beyond excuse. Why couldn't you give yourself/or spare/ effort to preserve the original aspect ratio? The video is thus of a truly disappointing quality..

DigieraMandela, thanks for the words of hope and your personal view of the prospects for peace - it's quite rare nowadays and yet so valuable.

Don't even bother to download this video."
[T],FrodooBagginz,2011-06-17T08:27Z,"The aspect ratio for this is correct. Amazon.com lists the DVD as 1:33:1 which is full screen.

And it makes no sense for them to make this documentary widescreen considering most, if not all, of the collected footage from news cameras and citizens cameras were full screen cameras. 

So, yes, the Aspect Ratio on this video is correct."
