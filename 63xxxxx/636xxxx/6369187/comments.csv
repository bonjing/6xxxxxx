Stop posting this crap in the description because you screw people's bandwidth with your non-sense advice;

""How To Get Your Maxspeed (uTorrent)

Torrent Client - Preferences - Bandwidth - Number of connections - Set aprox. 500 for each"" 
LOL

""Don't trust IMDb robot or bad ratings,always watch some trailers first.""
LOL. Bullshit! 
How often we see a super cool trailer then get so disappointed after watching the movie.
Best is to read both ""Love"" & ""Hate"" comments at imdb."
