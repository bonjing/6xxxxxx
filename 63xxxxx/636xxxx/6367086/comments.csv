,Milhouse1980,2011-05-06T04:08Z,"Not close to a DVD copy. Not even the greatest R5 Quality. It is in english the whole way through but looks like a good Cam Copy and Audio also in cam. It is PS3 compatible and watchable. I mean it is free. But all in all not the greatest R5 copy. 
Audio - 6
Video - 6"
