Why not make it with subtitles in separate file, so people are able to watch Atlantis without swedish subs?"
,la_cross37,2011-07-17T22:58Z,"Well, if they don't want Swedish subs they should download a torrent which isn't named ""SWESUB"". The uploader of this torrent have made it pretty clear that this torrent have Swedish subtitles, so stop complaining.

For a DVDRip:

A:5

V:6

Thank you for the UL!"
