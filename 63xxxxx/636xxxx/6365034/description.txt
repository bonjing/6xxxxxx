OSDial (OpenSource Dialer) is a full featured dialer which does Manual, Power and Predictive dialing out of the box. It is easily installed through one of our .iso images which will make a complete install. All that is needed to start dialing is:

1) download an InstallCD image (32 or 64 bit)
2) burn a bootable CD from above image
3) boot from the CD, type in 'osdial' to start and answer a couple of questions
3a) optionally configure IP address of server

Once installed, check for updates
1) login as root on server (information on start up screen)
2) run 'yum clear all;yum update'

Configure OSDial,
1) add a carrier for traditional, and/or voice over internet "lines" to dial out/receive calls on.
2) use either one of the preconfigured phones, or configure your own
3) configure softphones for agents (Xlite is a popular and free softphone)
4) use either one of the preconfigured agent logins, or configure your own
5) use either the included test campaign, or create you own.
6) add leads.
and you are ready to start!
