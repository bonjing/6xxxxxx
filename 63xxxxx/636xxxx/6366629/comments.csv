,DarkPreacher,2011-05-04T21:15Z,"The Game crashes for me on startup, anyone else have the same problem ?"
,DarkPreacher,2011-05-05T08:19Z,"@xs3ro 
i right clicked the TFT.exe then compatibility and forced it too start in 640x480"
,FAKMAN,2011-05-05T10:45Z,thanks!!!!
,zeddy911,2011-05-05T12:22Z,Crashes right after start for me as well.. Just shows a mountain picture then back to windows with a message that TFT.exe have stopped working... Pitty.... I'm running Win7 with ATI HD 5800 serie gfx card.
,zeddy911,2011-05-05T22:53Z,I think the Bink might be the reason to the crash.. Can anyone plz confirm if there is a Bing video/intro being played after the mountain image?
,Insomneac,2011-05-06T08:28Z,"This game doesn't use Bink video.

It works fine, I'm about halfoway through, but I believe it hasn't been cracked properly.

One of the bosses has replenishing health, possibly a SecuROM trigger."
,zeddy911,2011-05-06T22:46Z,It sure has binkw32.dll in the root and the movie folder contains .bik video files witch is a Bink video file extension... However... Can somebody tell me what comes after the first mountain picture????
