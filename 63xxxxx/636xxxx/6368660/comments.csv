I extracted the files and installed the program.  Then I copied all the files from the patch folder into C:/Program Files x86/GetFLV.  Then I ran the keygen and clicked ""P"".  It says ""PATCH FAILED""

Thanks for your hard work, this is very much appreciated"

Unfortunately, the patch does not work for me either. Following instructions, I put the crack in program directory and hit [P].

I get the following message:
""PATCH FAILED! Make sure app isn't running. Copy in App's dir or Run as Admin...""

I also tried to run crack as Admin with the same result. (I run Win7 64 bit)

Size and date of GetFLV.exe remains the same and trial restrictions are not removed."
