I am running: Macbook Pro3.1, 2.2Ghz, 4GB MEM, 10.6.7 OSX.
The app does not lunch itself. You click it an it does nothing."

Just download the trial from www.rogueamoeba.com and use the information given to us by DeGun on this torrent.
Everything worked out wonderful.  Thanks a lot DeGun, this is a great program."
