                           DESCRiPTiON 

 People whose lives have been transformed for better or worse by scooping a fortune
 on the National Lottery, which has created more than 2,500 millionaires since it
 began 16 years ago. Mark Gardiner, one of the first winners, offers advice to
 someone struggling with sudden wealth, while Ray and Barbara Wragg discuss how
 their windfall has brought them nothing but happiness. The documentary also goes
 behind the scenes at Camelot to explore the inner workings of the lottery
 organisation. Part of the Cutting Edge strand.
                                 
                                 Enjoy!
