Marriages with blended families have a higher rate of divorce than the first trip down the aisle, and todayâ€™s guests say they know exactly why. When Kip married Vicky, he says he knew that her daughter, Tory, was part of the package. Now, he struggles to get along with the 17-year-old, and they often engage in jaw-dropping screaming matches followed by a month without speaking. Hear the scathing remarks that Dr. Phil describes as the most inappropriate comments that heâ€™s ever heard a parent say about a child. What led someone to fear for Toryâ€™s safety and make a worried call to authorities? And, what, if any, ownership do this teen and her mother have in this family dynamic?
