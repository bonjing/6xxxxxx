Multi Core Embedded Systems-viny


Details a real-world product that applies a cutting-edge multi-core architecture
Increasingly demanding modern applicationsâ€”such as those used in telecommunications networking and real-time processing of audio, video, and multimedia streamsâ€”require multiple processors to achieve computational performance at the rate of a few giga-operations per second. This necessity for speed and manageable power consumption makes it likely that the next generation of embedded processing systems will include hundreds of cores, while being increasingly programmable, blending processors and configurable hardware in a power-efficient manner.
