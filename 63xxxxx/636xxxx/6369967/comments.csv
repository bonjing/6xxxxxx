,dacarlo,2011-05-06T19:19Z,Sorry to say but this seems knackered right after the bit where he's talking about chess pieces.

,masterac,2011-05-07T11:30Z,"i agree, bad torrent because of the part with the chess...too bad you didnt check it before you up this...bad thing is, because you are a green skull people will magnet click this directly without checking com.

they will only check com after getting to the scene, to see if its a computer probleme or file problem...like me lol"
,eXodes,2011-10-07T06:07Z,"Mehs. MKV file broken. Tried on all my player. Till chess part, it's out of sync. I must agree with 'masterac' that you as a green skull user should double check first. Plus, this is HD file so it takes some times for those have poor internet connectivity. Better not to let down you support 'sceneline'. Just my two cent. : )"
