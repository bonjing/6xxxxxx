A selection of dolby digital and DTS idents that were shown in the cinema just before the main feature to show off the cinema\'s surround sound system. E.G. City, Train, Egypt...oh and the DTS one that has the CD that shatters into a million pieces with \"the digital experience\"

Use VLC Media Player to play them and for BEST result, output the digital audio to S/PDIF on your computer\'s sound (optical or coax) straight into a full blown cinema amplifier and 5.1 speaker system and crank up the volume!

Enjoy!
