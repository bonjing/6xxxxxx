I finally got a hold of the recordings for this wonderful language course and decided to upload it here too, as I believe I'm not the only one who've been searching for it!

I have ripped the audio directly from the vinyl records and I hope you're going to be pleased by the results.

If you liked this torrent please be sure that you support Assimil by buying their newer courses so that we can see more of them in the future! Especially the courses on rarer languages like Ancient Greek and Egyptian Hieroglyphics (I for one have already bought both!). Thanks for reading, and enjoy this release.
