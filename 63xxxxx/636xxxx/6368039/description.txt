In the intimate historical epic Mysteries of Lisbon, director RaÃºl Ruiz again takes on the challenge of adapting 19th century literature, here the novel by Camilo Castelo Branco, a popular 1854 classic of Portuguese literature that has never been translated into English. Written serially for publication, like Charles Dickensâ€™ novels, the originalâ€™s format of amazingly interconnected characters is marvelously suited to a structure of flashbacks within flashbacks sparked by Proustian memories, just as in Ruizâ€™s 1999 cinematic take of Time Regained.

The story opens with an orphan boy, 14-year-old JoÃ£o, whoâ€™s ashamed of having no last name, and chronicles the continuing revelations about his family, birth, enemies, rescuers, and then his own infatuations and losses as he grows up. The loves and jealousies are like Balzac, and the historical sweep is of Victor Hugo, crossing continents during the time when the European aristocracy was shaken by Napoleon. (A Brazilian pirate-turned-ubiquitous war profiteer is particularly memorable.) Fortunes are protected and rejected, beautiful young lovers are discovered by furious fathers, illegitimate children abound, jealous husbands are brutal, spurned women are vengeful, and priests and nuns retreat to the church in penance and grief. Servants, ever watchful, listen in on these aristocratic families as the audienceâ€™s entrÃ©e into the stunning period settings.
