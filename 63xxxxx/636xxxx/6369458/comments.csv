,qwertyDave,2011-06-05T21:50Z,"Nice app, works well. Thanks for the great upload.

Whoever packaged this thing went to great lengths to make it a pain. Is it really necessary to rar a 71MB file in 13 parts?  It's called highspeed internet for a reason. 71MB is a quick DL and this packaging harkens back to times when everyone had dialup."

,heeeeha,2011-12-23T07:07Z,"i'm not able to extract it what am i suppose to do for the extraction of this soft, please assist me "
,muvazzafsergerde,2012-01-22T21:37Z,Well this package is almost impossible to extract... It is either stupid me who s unable to do that or - considering that I m not alone - the one who had seen it necessary to divide the file into 14 pieces! Good work!!!!!!
,pontoon,2012-01-26T08:32Z,Εύχαριστώ.
,hulme226,2012-02-18T15:01Z,"@muvazzafsergerde and others with issues regarding extraction issues!
Once downloaded, select ALL the rar files and extract HERE (same folder that contains the downloaded torrent) NOT to another folder voila you will see SETUP."
,MJimM,2012-03-16T11:50Z,I also cannot get this to extract? I have selected all files and Setup.exe shows briefly but then I get a CRC check fail and a warning the file is corrupt. May have to download again and retry
