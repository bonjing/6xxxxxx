,Thoms,2011-05-05T22:37Z,"Hello Glenn1979.

It's a complete Mapsouce version, and you need Jetmouse or some thing like that to unlock the map.

Best regards 
Thom"

It does not work on my Z660 ver.4.20 with JM 1.5. Only the old software ver.. 3.50 and JM 1.5"
,MoralesCrk,2011-05-09T14:01Z,The MapID for JetMouse is 2419
,Svenne8,2011-05-11T07:24Z,"Hi.
Can't get it to work with Jetmouse 1.5 and FID:2419.
Have opened a lot of maps before with it but this wont work.
Any other settings in Jetmouse, or anything other to do?"
,av_andrei,2011-05-11T15:33Z,"This mapsource version it`s unlocked ??
It works on cracked Mapsource ???"
,tolerence,2011-05-11T21:26Z,"After install replace the original mapsource exe with this one
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5924772/Garmin_Mapsource_v6.16.3_patched_exe.

 Now you can unlock map with jetmouse keygen

,luka78,2011-05-14T08:37Z,I have problems with extraction. It said that couple GMP file is corrupted. Did someone else have similar problems? It said CRC failed in some of them. I can wrote which one (GMP) is problem (about 10 of them).
,luka78,2011-05-15T19:07Z,"Ok, here is list of GMP file that failed during extraction:

G:\Garmin\Mape\CNEUNT2012_10.rar: CRC failed in City Navigator Europe NT 2012.10.gmap\Product1\00378421\I07F3ADD.GMP. The file is corrupt

,tolerence,2011-05-16T09:43Z,"Sometimes data can be corrupted while downloading,maybe you should give it another try.

I had no problems with it"
,grakgrak,2011-05-16T10:50Z,"@luka78

The RAR is fine. You need to ""Force-ReCheck"" this file (if using uTorrent) or similar."
,luka78,2011-05-17T15:29Z,"Thank you all...

I download it again and now i extract it without problem. Probably there was some problem during download.

Now i have to try this...

Thank's again"
,antoanoo,2011-05-17T16:42Z,"This map update is not compatible to Nuvi 350 ?
Am I right ?"

Same question here. Please answer."
,grmaj,2011-06-06T18:50Z,To bosnianomb: Maybe you should check if your SD card is formated in FAT32 system?
,apmahardy,2011-06-07T07:47Z,"OK, guys after reading many different pieces of instruction I have a working procedure.

PLUG GARMIN IN AND UPDATE TO NEWEST VERSION FROM WEBSITE
1) Get a patched Mapsource.exe (you'll need the patched version) http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5924772/Garmin_Mapsource_v6.16.3_patched_exe.
1a) Replace the original Mapsource application file with the one downloaded above.
2) Download and install map
3) Open Mapsource - Utilities - Get Unit ID (you should see it there if your garmin device conected)
4) download garmin unlocker. I used this one: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4421093/Garmin_unlock_v1.5
5) open unlocker and first enter Unit ID then ""select map product"" go to ""custom mapset"" and enter Map ID 2419, press generate (this is your 25 digit map unlock code - copy it)
6) open mapsorce again. If it says that there are maps to be unlocked go there ( go to utilities - manage map products - unlock regions - ADD (here you paste your map unlock code) IF DONE RIGHT UNDER - map product information - STATUS SHOULD BE ""Unlocked""
6a) In mapsource select the ""map tool"" (yellow lined polygonal tool) and start selecting the areas of Europe you want to incorporate. They should start appearing in the ""maps"" window to the left. 
7)Make sure to format your SD card with FAT32 and Name it ""GARMIN""
7a)Creat a folder on your SD card called ""garmin"".
8) Your maps are ready to transfer - in Mapsource select maps you wish to transfer - go to ""transfer"" ""send to device"" and put it on your Garmin SD card.
8b)This can take a Veeeeeery long time so be patient. If it fails then remove some of the areas you selected earlier that you don't need and try again. 
9) last thing: open Notepad - paste your map unlock code (25 digit) - go to file - save as - name it gmapsupp.unl (but not as .txt file - save as ""all files"") and save where your gmapsupp image file is stored on your Garmin SD card.

IN THE NUVI GPS:
1)Start the GPS with SD card inserted. 
2)go to ""tools"" ""settings"" ""map"" ""map info"" and your new map should be there!"
,apmahardy,2011-06-07T07:56Z,"Thanks to andrejsan for most of that ^ 
I just filled in the blanks."
,apmahardy,2011-06-07T07:59Z,DISREGARD STEP (9) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
,apmahardy,2011-06-07T08:00Z,If you attempt step 9 PLEASE do not overwrite the Disk Image File containing your Newly created maps. it MUST be a UNL file.
,orandaberg,2011-06-23T12:39Z,"Hi

,deguima,2011-07-03T00:47Z,"Great Post. What about JCV and 3D files?

Kind Regards"
,merjasec666,2011-10-08T14:43Z,"I'm not able to unlock the maps... cracked Mapsource is not working for me.

After I insert the 25 digit code, under ""map product information"" status is ""locked""...

anyone?"
,riksilvers,2011-10-19T14:45Z,look for and use 'Fast IMG Unlocker 2.1.exe' 
,compasser,2011-10-28T04:46Z,"a question please:
are these maps general for most of Garmin portable navigators? ex: garmin nuvi 1440 5"" will this maps work on it? I am a new-by  and want to buy a navigator but worried about the updates issue! and is garmin nuvi 1440 good anyway?"
