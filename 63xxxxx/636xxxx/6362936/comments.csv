,supcena,2011-05-05T16:42Z,even i wanna watch I am number four ...maybe StyLishSaLH is waiting for it to be out on Blu ray  ....if thats the case we will have to wait until may 24th 
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-05-05T18:14Z,"I'm Number Four is out on Bluray :)
What about a 720p, or my usual 480p ?
@mkv-cv
Cape Verde: beautiful Island bro :)
I've seen ur comment to keep my encodes in 480p. Some movies may need some xtra bitrate, may exceed my normal encode size, so I do them in 720p.
But I'm trying my best to keep them under 500MB, hope you can adjust, 720p is far better than 480p, with just an increase of 100-150 MB :)"
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-05-05T18:15Z,"@Knight
Gnomeo and Juliet is better to watch in BR :)
Hope you agree."
,dexter-22,2011-05-05T18:47Z,do it in ur 480p dude 
,kuttootta,2011-05-05T19:23Z,Please do in 480p
,Jabdy69,2011-05-05T22:34Z,"Do ""I Am Number Four"" in 720p, But also in 500MB... Thank you!"
,banukaknight,2011-05-06T03:05Z,"prefer to see the rips in old way. under 450mb in size :\ 
just my idea.
it's your call."
,supcena,2011-05-06T10:03Z,720p under 500 mb would be great !!!
,suneelsahu,2011-05-06T11:10Z,"i am number 4 is a fast action movie n will b gr8 in 720p,but with below 600-650 mb it'll b pixelated i think rest is up to stylish :)"
,banukaknight,2011-05-07T02:49Z,busy days?
,abciscrazy,2011-05-07T02:57Z,"twentyforty just did a 500mb encode of I am Number Four.
would like to see a smaller rip from you.
:)"
,kittymudface,2011-05-15T08:01Z,"Thanks! I have no idea how you're able to get a 720p this small, but it's absolutely great!!!

Btw, would you be able to get ""The Big Bus"" (1976, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074205/ ) in 720p? That would be amazing! :)"
