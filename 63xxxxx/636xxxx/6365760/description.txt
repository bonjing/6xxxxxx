Blues Master Jimmy Witherspoon was born August 8, 1923, Gurdon, Ark. and past on September 13, 1997, Los Angeles, Ca.  His father, a railroad man, sang in local choirs, while his mother played piano. Spoon didn't pursue music professionally until after his WWII stint in the Merchant Marines. On his return to the states in 1944, he replaced the great Walter Brown in The Jay McShann Band and performed with Big Joe Turner and T-Bone Walker. Spoon's first hit record was Ain't Nobody's Business which he followed in 1949 with a reworking of the Leroy Carr song In The Evening When The Sun Goes Down. His hit Ain't Nobody's Business was one of the biggest records of the era, and stayed on the Billboard for 34 weeks that year. Spoon made 200 recordings since and was a true giant of the post-war Blues boom. 
Spoon managed to span the worlds of Blues, R&B and Jazz with his deep baritone and unique style anchored in the big band Blues traditions
