La Fille Mal GardÃ©e ("The Unguarded Maiden"), perhaps the best-known work of composer Ferdinand HÃ©rold, is here presented in a Royal Ballet production freely adapted, arranged and conducted by John Lanchbery. 
The unquestioned centre of attention is Royal Ballet superstar Lesley Collier who plays Lise, the beautiful farm girl whom her widowed mother (Brian Shaw) plans to marry to the eligible Alain (Garry Grant) 
despite Lise's love for young farmer Colas (Michael Coleman). 
This is a colourful pastoral romp with pause for tender and lyrical moments and plentiful opportunities for Collier to enchant her many admirers. Royal Ballet principal conductor Lanchbery--himself composer of the well-loved Tales of Beatrix Potter (1971)--brings all his flair for this sort of carefree entertainment to play and the result is delightful. Filmed for BBC television at Covent Garden in January 1981, the witty, energetic and romantic horeography is by Frederick Ashton (his dancing chickens are hilarious, as is Shaw's "clog dance" in Act Two) and the stage design by Osbert Lancaster, whose legacy adds charm to a much more recent BBC Royal Ballet film of CoppÃ©lia (2000). 
HÃ©rold's score is filled with playfulness, melody and laughter, making this a very superior pantomime.
