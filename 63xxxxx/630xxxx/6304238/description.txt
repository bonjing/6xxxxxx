2010 sophomore release from this Swedish outfit. Fredrik started out in late 2006 as the songwriter/sound artist duo of F. Hultin and O. Lindefelt. The idea was to attempt narrative structures in music through the combination of electro-acoustic composition and folk-infused musical form. This second outing is more consistently inward-looking, the melodies more serpentine and the textures decidedly darker. However, Fredrik's warm lead voice and volatile choir sketches still lends the material the same comforting elegance as on the debut.
