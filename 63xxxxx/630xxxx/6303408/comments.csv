,aphexes,2011-04-10T12:52Z,"people talking very loudly through it, louder than the film itself...

Camera is zoomes into the screen, for example, all you see on the title screen is ""idio"".

Sounds is truly aweful, video is slightly better than others but still terrible.

Overall, a very good cam, thanks."

not that good but cant expect much from a movie that isnt even on dvd yet. having troubles findin this movie anywhere right now."
,oxmox12,2011-04-12T01:09Z,its the same unwatchable cam that is floating around everywhere and i cant see a difference in color. not to be a dick bro. just sharing my opinion. the guy who filmed this should be shot and his tounge cut out lol
,CamBam,2011-04-12T09:31Z,I downloaded this and when I put the USB in my TV I was actually happy to see that it is NOT a fake movie and that it works. So you do have a movie to watch but it does have it's problems 
,CamBam,2011-04-12T09:34Z,"I downloaded this and when I put the USB in my TV I was actually happy to see that it is NOT a fake movie and that it works. So you do have a movie to watch but it does have it's problems because, the movie has many dark scenes so don't expect the movie to be like when you buy it on DVD because it's not. There are also some audio issues but it's fine.. But the thing that made me sad was that it didn't finish properly so that was my biggest dissappointment. But hey, guys, I recomend you download it, it's worth downloading and the best one you can find out for now."
,martincorleone66,2011-04-12T19:52Z,"now before everyone screams "" your getting it for free, stop complaining"" the video is decent, however i saw this in theatres and the end is the best part, its missing from here. this is the same copy as all the rest, why uploaders take the same movie from someone else and re upload it is beyound me. yeah its free, but if your going to do it, make sure you know what your uploading. your missing the best part the ending, and you wont get the full feeling of the movie, wait for a better copy. at the end, the father comes back from the spirit world and something crazy happens with the pychic, thats all i will say, dont want to ruin it"
,geoffp,2011-05-11T07:55Z,The ends missing. LOL 
,mininova_org,2011-05-14T02:13Z,thanks for the upload mate
