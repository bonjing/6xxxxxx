For both FSX and FS9

The aesthetically-stunning Supermarine Scimitar was the last fighter produced by Supermarine.  At the time of its inception in 1957 it was a major leap forward for the British Fleet Air Arm in terms of power, sophistication, and above-all size compared to its predecessors.  However, the Scimitar was tricky to fly and was plagued with operational accidents.  More than half of the 76 produced were lost in accidents.  The aircraft faded into history with the advent of the Blackburn Buccaneer.
