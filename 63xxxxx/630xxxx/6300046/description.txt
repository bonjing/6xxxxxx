More than a decade has passed since IBMâ€™s Deep Blue computer stunned the world by defeating Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion at that time. Following Deep Blueâ€™s retirement, there has been a succession of better and better chess playing computers, or chess engines, and today there is little question that the worldâ€™s best engines are stronger at the game than the worldâ€™s best human players.

The book provides analysis of the games alongside a detailed examination of the remarkable technological progress made by the engines â€“ asking the questions which one is best, how good is it, and how much better can it get.
