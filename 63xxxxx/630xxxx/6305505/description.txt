FastTracker 2 was one of the most widely used trackers, created by Fredrik "Mr. H" Huss and Magnus "Vogue" HÃ¶gdahl, two members of the demogroup Triton (who later founded Starbreeze Studios) which set about releasing their own tracker after breaking into the scene in 1992 and winning several demo competitions. 


-Short History About Triton - The original creators of Fasttracker:
Triton was a demo group active in the PC demo scene from '92 to about '96. The first demo, Crystal Dreams, was released in the summer of '92 and won the demo competition at Hackerence V. The second and last demo was released june '93 and won the demo competition and The Computer Crossroads (TCC-'93) party in Gothenburg. Triton's greatest pride, however, is the music-program Fasttracker2, which was released in '95.


Compatibility:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
FT2 runs with a custom made DOS 32bit-extender and it supports Gravis Ultrasound as well as Sound Blaster, Covox and the simple PC speaker.  Due to this, hardcore musicians who still want to use FT2 often build "oldskool" PCs with the optimal (and nowadays rather cheap) hardware for the tracker, just to be able to track with it.

An alternative way of getting FT2 to run is by using DOSBox[6] â€” this, however, as accurate as is, has speed and latency problems, and one needs quite a muscular PC to be able to use it as comfortably as on a native environment. The release of DOSBox 0.7 in March 2007 substantially improved speed/performance problems. Other methods of usage include GUSEMU or VDMSound.
