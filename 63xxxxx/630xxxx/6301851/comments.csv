,catamaranman,2011-04-08T18:54Z,"Be warned, entities using the name AXXO in their web address and screenname here on TPB are trying to get people to go to websites that claim to host ""direct download"" movies, movie posters, subtitles, IMDB links, etc.  Going to these sites at the very least will attempt to install malware and at the worst will add your ip address to a scary database....HA! he actually beat me here!  Go away ""Axxodude"" you fool almost no one!"
