,99johnny99,2011-04-12T21:47Z,I don't know how to use Jeppview with Jeppesen Mobile TC but I make Pdf's from all the Jeppview plates with eDocPrinter Pdf Pro. This program is able to recognise the italic identifier of each airport and full automatic produces Pdf plates with bookmarks of each airport. To make a Pdf of the Netherlands for instance takes only 2 minutes. Germany 10 minutes. With the bookmark feature in Goodreader for the Ipad you can find each airport in a split second and have all the plates of that airport available. Before transfer the Jeppview plates to Pdf's it is important to correctly define the identifier. This is Arial 20pt italic. I use my Ipad as a backup with my flighttraining and it works smoothly. Have fun.

,acroduster,2011-04-16T02:40Z,"@99johnny99
Please give more details about eDocPrinter Pdf Pro usage with JV.
I get identical bookmarks for each page in the form ""FliteMap 9.5.4.0"", which are quite useless.
Bookmark definition I use is Arial, 20pt+/-10pt, Bold Italic, Black.
Your supplied definition doesn't work with me...
Thanks for your help!"
,99johnny99,2011-04-16T10:41Z,The way you do it it identiefies all characters Arial black italic 10 to 30 pt. (20 +/- 10) Use +/- 1 and it will work. Have fun.

,99johnny99,2011-04-17T10:41Z,As far as I can see these files contain full world but no VFR Europe plates. I didn't dl these files and wait for MySony or Anonymous.
,69Gazza69,2011-04-20T22:34Z,Does anyone have the codes for the European Military and US Military Plates?
