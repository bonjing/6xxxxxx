BBC Fanny Hill 1of2 HDTV XViD Pr0teu5

Brilliant BBC Adaptation of one of one the most famous pieces of erotic literature ever, Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure Â­by John Cleland. Although written in the 18th Century this reasonably faithful representation, is still racy enough in todays's jaded society.

The Story Follows the experiences of Fanny Hill, an innocent country girl, who orphaned, finds a new life in a house in London where (without realisong it) ia being groomed for a life of prostitution.

Warning contains scenes of a sexual nature.
