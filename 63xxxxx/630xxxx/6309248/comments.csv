,daveywave,2011-04-11T16:52Z,"You are the man! Seeing as though lack of BBC iPlayer HD streaming...

I and I believe a LOT of other people would love if you were able to upload the true 720p HD stream!

Even if it were just the highlight show due to size/seed constraints. Please consider!

Thanks!"
