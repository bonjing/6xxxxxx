On their third album, Blur takes 30 years of cool English rock, throws it into an art-punk Cuisinart, and end up with a masterpiece of timeless hooks and Cockney attitude. Like the Kinks at their satirical best, Blur paints warm and funny portraits of quintessentially English characters (Tracy Jacks, Parklife, The Debt Collector), delivering them with early Small Faces swagger, wiggy Syd Barrett-via-Julian Cope production, XTC circa Respectable Street vocal hooks (ooh-we-ooh), and a cynical Buzzcocks detachment.
