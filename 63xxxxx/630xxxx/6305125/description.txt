Lansine Kouyate & David Neerman - Kangaba
2008

David Neerman plays electric and acoustic vibes alongside Lansine Kouyate, a master of the Malian balafon who has played with Salif Keita, Baaba Maal, Mory Kante, Omar Sosa, Dee Dee Bridgewater and many more. Their instruments ring together collectively, so close and yet so far apart in tessitura, sound, matter, playing technique, history and imagination. Over long hours of improvisation the two musicians would exchange their wisdom, progressively laying down the bases for a mutant universe of sound whose process was totally organic and laid on the foundations of Mandinka music, yet which made a radical break with all the clichÎ˜s of the music called fusion or world . Accompanying them on this recording are bassist Ira Coleman and drummer Laurent Robin, and Malian singer Mamani Keita on the magnificent title Touma . With this album, their first, Kouyate & Neerman unveil new territory that is both authentic and innovative, a work of poetic power that is absolutely stunning.
