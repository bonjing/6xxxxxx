Many thanks for your diligence - I'm most grateful!

Have a safe weekend, JW :)

I echo what TBum posted.
An interesting effect is that I sometimes read comments about what Limbaugh has said before I can listen to his show. It helps to provide a bit of insight into his comments.
Thanks for your work."
