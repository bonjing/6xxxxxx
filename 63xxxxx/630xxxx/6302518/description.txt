 DRUM is a group  that releases all kind  of electronic  stuff but  mainstream.
 We dont  care for any  releaseyear or source...its still all about  the music.
 In the  beginning of 2002 we began to support the scene with the best of the
 best ... our  goal was not  to become  group #1 in scene ... we rather
 wanted  to create a strong  community out of music lovers and give our
        musictaste to the ppl who still understand the music and its spirit...
        and after 2 years we're stronger than ever before. The friendship
          that we earn keeps us continuing every single day of the year ...
          and it will go on like this. So we wanna say thank you to all the
        ppl that helped us over the last 2 years ... siteops, groups and
     any kind of sceners. In the  times of  flaming and  arrogance its a
    luck to find ppl with the same attitude like we have. We  appreciate
    your help and your support in any way. So if  you wanna  join our
         small  and welfare community, dont hesitate
             to contact us.
             
                We dont care for a monthly amount of rips
                its still all about the music and friendship.
