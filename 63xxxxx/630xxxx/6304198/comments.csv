,blankor,2011-04-09T13:25Z,"Thanks again for uploading your shitty torrents in a .mp4 format that my PS3 can't play and apparently I can't convert it into AVI since it's not ""true mp4"".
You suck Rudos."
[V],scene4all,2011-04-09T16:32Z,"@blankor LOL are you sure u got a PS3? its probably an xbox 360 u got there because mp4 always plays on PS3, not only any mp4 file even this one. I just finished watching it on the PS3 and the video and sound is great. Just because it doesn't show the mp4 file doesn't mean it wont work. ;)"
