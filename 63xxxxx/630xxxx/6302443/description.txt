ECUsafe offers software for DPF & FAP (diesel particulate filter) removal from many EDC16, EDC17, Marelli MJD, Siemens PPD and Siemens SID cars - and the list is growing. This software can remove DPF or FAP automatically from program of car. Filter can be removed without causing any errors or abnormal car behavior. Speed limiter removal in many cars and trucks is possible. Special AD1 module helps to correct and reduce AdBlue consumption in trucks.

Removing of FAP / DPF is easy ! All you need is to read original file from car and process it with proper ECUsafe module, designed to find and remove all important DPF structures automatically, without your attendance. 

File can be then directly written in ECU, or it can be tuned by you and then - written into car. DPF can be removed from car, sensors left unplugged (no sensors at all) or left in the exhaust. It does not matter.

No more regeneration, no more black smoke behind. No more DPF check light or lamps on the dashboard. Add DPF removal offer to your workshop capabilities !

Software includes FAP/DPF level EEPROM editor. You can open EEPROM file. This is useful in case, when too high level of fill of FAP is stored in EEPROM of ECU. In that case even removing FAP from main memory of ECU may omit dashboard blinking error. You can edit EEPROM memory and set level of FAP to any level (or reset it). EEPROM checksum is calculated automatically.

AdBlue can be also corrected directly from ECUsafe.
