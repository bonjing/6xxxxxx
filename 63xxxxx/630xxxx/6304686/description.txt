                Last Call for Love.
                Drama series about a newly-opened public justice
                centre. Rebuffed by both Darren and Kaz, Jake bares
                his teeth by torching a car in the community centre
                car park as a warning. When Jake Little is charged
                with arson, the staff at the Public Justice Centre
                finally have the chance to take him off the streets
                for good. Instead of passing the case on to the City
                Crown Court, Coburn decides to try the case at the
                Dovefield Public Justice Centre, and this time they
                have an unimpeachable witness - Father Jim Kelly.

                The rules for naming releases don't state what to do
                when there are two series that are from the same
                country and also the same year. We decided to include
                the broadcast channel in the release name to make it
                clear that this is the new BBC1 daytime drama and not
                the series of lectures that aired under the same
                title on BBC4 earlier this year.
