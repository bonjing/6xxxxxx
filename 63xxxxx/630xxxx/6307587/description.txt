                           DESCRiPTiON 

 In an interview at his villa in Majorca, the award-winning composer discusses a range
 of topics, including his career, his private life and coming to terms with cancer.
 Piers Morgan also talks to the peer's family, including his wife Madeleine, as well as
 friends Graham Norton, Arlene Phillips and Michael Ball, and gains a deeper
 understanding of what makes Lloyd Webber tick when he follows him at work in
 London's West End.

                                 
                                 Enjoy!
