,tech_n9ne,2011-04-10T21:52Z,Thanx !! you are the best !!
,tech_n9ne,2011-04-11T04:59Z,pls guys need more seed!!!
,jmac85,2011-04-11T05:42Z,"Appreciate these uploads, James. Have you given any thought to 720p > 480p? I know the file size will go up by about 60%, however. Also, to help with this, you could bump the audio down to 96 kbit or 80 kbit. I know 720p is more difficult to manage, so if you can't it's not a big deal at all. Things are just more pretty in 720p is all. :)"
,jmac85,2011-04-11T05:46Z,"Also, how are you getting 29.97 FPS on all your encodes? Shouldn't most of them be 23.976 FPS (unless they're PAL sources)?"
,jameshotwire,2011-04-11T07:40Z," at tech9 sorry my internet is so slow will be finished seeding in a few more hours.

at jmac 29.97 is basically half rate of what the broadcast is 59.97 FPS.   And seeing as the cars are going 200 mph if I do 23.97 or 24 it doesn't look as good."
,tech_n9ne,2011-04-11T13:03Z,it not the full race you start uploading after 70 laps of the race nooooooooo!!!!!!!! 
,jmac85,2011-04-11T20:00Z,"@James: I see. I was just curious is all, as I see -every- other American show at 23.976, so it seemed odd. I also asked about 720p...but you did say your internet was slow, so that wouldn't help on the seeding front."
,salbrecht,2011-04-17T05:56Z,"Thanks again!  I am one of your biggest fans.  Since I can't get these races here in Thailand, I am very grateful you are supplying them."
,salbrecht,2011-04-17T05:58Z,"One more thing, I vote for high def as opposed to smaller file size.  I can live with longer download times just fine."
