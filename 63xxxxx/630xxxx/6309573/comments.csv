There's an option to choose subs, but they don't appear at all.
Not seeding this stuff.
Will wait for ""iqeiqe"" to release his 720p."
,fishboy21,2011-04-12T19:12Z,"I agree, im not going to watch this episode in that shitty quality.. just have to wait til' saturdaynight for iqeiqe to release CP version"
,crex2102,2011-04-13T19:20Z,"Not sure what the other commenters are on about...  the quality's just great.  And hey, it's the only version up so far.  Thanks!"
,dogmit,2011-04-14T18:07Z,"Yes, it's the only version so far, and thanks to the releaser fro this.
But look at the size doesn't correspond to the quality. If you want to know what we are about, just try any iqeiqe 720 release.
For instance this
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6290662/Adventure_Time_-_210b_-_Go_With_Me__C_P__%28720p%29"
,guayec,2011-04-17T17:34Z,"great job, thx!"
,dogmit,2011-04-17T18:17Z,"Sorry to comment in this release.
Everyone who's looking for iqeiqe HD uploads don't worry. A little patience and we'll get our 720p AT fix :)"
,shimigami777,2011-04-20T22:31Z,Honestly I wouldn't ever up a crap version like this if something better was available. That should just be common sense. But 720p isn't really necessary for me to enjoy a damn cartoon lol.
