,FlashyVox,2011-08-13T16:20Z,Stop uploading Flac! No one likes to download music that isn't that much different from mp3 320kbp/s. If you have it that upload mp3 discogs please!
,Merk21582,2011-09-09T03:30Z,zibbik. In reply to FlashyVox. Which you already know but I want to say. Please continue to upload FLAC. The undeniable difference in quality is absolutely astounding and worth it. Thank you for all your great work.

To all those people who say prefer lossy codecs stop it, if you don't like FLAC download somewhere else and when your codec is technologically insuperior and you can't transcode without losing more quality in your music don't complain. I don't know who promoted this idea that MP3 at 320kb is the jesus codec, in reality it sucks, in comparison it sucks, all tests say it's not transparent and all you are doing is taking up a bunch of space with a codec that doesn't do what you want. FLAC on the other hand is just compressed version of an original CD, all the quality every single Byte is there and that's what people download FLAC want, for my computer for my MP3 player I personally use Ogg vorbis or AAC, but FLAC is a safe version from which you can transcode to everything without losing quality and in the future if a better codecs comes my way I have a lossless version of my music which I can transcode without losing any sound in my music and being able to enjoy it in high fidelity. Mp3 is about 20 years old, it stopped being the best codec a long time ago, and aac is a good codec but not better than ogg vorbis. And in 5 years there's going to be a better codec which takes less space and has better fidelity and we will all move over to that one, but without a lossless version of your music your just losing quality transcoding. If you don't want to download FLAC, go to Ares or download another torrent, but FLAC or any other lossless codec is the only real quality music that you can download which is future proof."
