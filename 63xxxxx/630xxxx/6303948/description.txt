    You can find 10.O.Clock.Live.S01E12.720p.HDTV.x264-SATV    
    in P2P where it originated and it belongs. We choose to   
     ignore it instead of giving it credence with a proper   
     tag. To begin with their nfo isnt correct, since their  
     file is only 558 megs, not 1,09 as the nfo states. And  
    for a 47 minutes show that's a little small isn't it?..  
       P2P, wrong nfo, wrong size... where are we going?
