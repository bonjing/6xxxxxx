,kreem,2012-04-09T16:29Z,This absolutely sucks - the quality of the movie may be good but it's hard to tell because the animation is so poor. I really liked the idea of it but why they couldn't get artists who actually knew how to draw rather than the talentless schmucks who did this is a mystery to me - it's also damn boring.
