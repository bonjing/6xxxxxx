=========================================

â€œWasting Lightâ€ is the seventh studio album by American alternative rock band Foo Fighters. The title is taken from the lyrics of the song â€œMiss the Miseryâ€. Guest musicians include Bob Mould and Krist Novoselic. Compared with the 11-track regular version, the iTunes Deluxe Version includes 2 more audio tracks, 1 live performance video and the music video for the song â€œWhite Limoâ€. I also added the music video for the lead single â€œRopeâ€ as well. Enjoy!

Produced by Butch Vig and mixed by Alan Moulder, Wasting Light was recorded entirely on analog tape in the garage of Grohl s home in California s San Fernando Valley. The no computers/no software back to basics approach has resulted in arguably the strongest and most cohesive effort of the band s 15-year-plus career: From first single Rope to the frenetic opener Bridge Burning to the beautifully bipolar These Days to stunning guest spots from Bob Mould ( Dear Rosemaryâ€) and Krist Novoselic (â€I Should Have Knownâ€), Wasting Light is a singular triumph: a band that s headlined arenas, stadiums and festivals the world over stripping itself down to the bare essentials and coming up with a world class band s finest hour.
