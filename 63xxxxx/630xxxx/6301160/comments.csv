,CosmicKobal,2011-04-10T07:03Z,This is the only pokemon black file that I have found so far that doesn't keep you from gaining exp. It works for me on 'desmume' but I'm not sure about any other emulators yet. I haven't had and glitches or freezes yet but I will comment again once I've played for a while
,CosmicKobal,2011-04-10T07:07Z,"one more thing. I wasn't able to use my save state from another pokemon black file with this rom. even though i was using this rom, it acted like i was using the other. Long story short, you'll likely need to start a new game for it to work properly."
,Lange199,2011-04-11T12:56Z,I have a dstt so if you are using it search for wood4tt

,Potatismos123,2011-04-11T19:29Z,I have a problem in game when the professor asks for my name and no letters is shown old a blue background with lightblue square patterns. Please help me!
,Potatismos123,2011-04-11T20:01Z,I think the problem is with desmume because I tried 6diffrent sorts of pokemon black and white but I cant get the text when she asks for my name. Also I cant see the 4 alternatives when batteling. Is this something I have to fix somewhere in desmume or do I need to fix codes or something?
,Potatismos123,2011-04-12T16:34Z,Sry about comments I had full screen and saw only upper screen and not the touch screen :P
,Lange199,2011-04-20T18:43Z,Potatismos Wich card do you use??
,brittnerd,2012-04-16T21:59Z,"I searched all over for a torrent that fixes the exp glitch and this is the only one I found that works. If you need a Pokemon Black in English with working exp, get this one. Thanks Lange199!"
