,leaknoil,2011-04-18T21:17Z,Torrent is bad. Could you redo this ? I'm trying to collect all the Sun OS versions and don't have this.

,ciscobox,2011-08-31T10:17Z,"hello,
i know its irrelevant question, but i just wanna ask if its possible to ""emulate"" or run a sparc OS on intel or linux platform? i have a sparc executable image, that i really need to run and test under intel/linux. google says it might possible under qemu, but i want to know your opinion about this, with all your torrent, it seems like you're knowledgable on solaris plaform. thanks in advanced mate!"
