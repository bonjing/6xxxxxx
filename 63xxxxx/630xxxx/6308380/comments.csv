,puunjab,2011-04-13T02:29Z,"Q: Why isn't the imdb link included with all your other nonsense?

A: Cause dickheads like you don't want us to know when movies suck.

A: Cause your too fucking stupid?

A: Cause your too fucking lazy?"
,dhorvath,2011-04-14T01:59Z,"ok, enough with whatever your people have to say in your comments. can we please get someone that just gives rating on the A/V quality? please? i dunno about most other people, but thats all i read the comments for in the first place..."
,mtrspctr,2011-04-14T08:30Z,"@puunjab
Q: Why are you such a troll?
A: 'Cause you're an idiot.
Seriously, dude, think before you open your stupid ass-face. There's no room here for morons like you.
Maybe there's no IMDB link because extremezone figured that if someone didn't know about movie (unlikely), they could find it on IMDB themselves. You spent more time typing your idiotic and contradictory comment about laziness than it would've taken to google ""mechanic imdb"", dickmilk.
Also, some might find the ""nonsense"" in the description quite helpful.
Also, if you plan on trying to insult someone's intelligence by calling them stupid, make sure you know how to write English correctly, you illiterate fuck. Save yourself some future embarrassment: http://www.wikihow.com/Use-You%27re-and-Your
I'm so sick of idiots like you trolling. The only mild complaint I would have is that the screencaps aren't 1:1.
I will absolutely download this based on the trailer, the IMDB info posted by extremezone, and other people's comments.
Sorry to others for the rant, but PUUNJAB, go fuck yourself."

,pnewseqqq,2011-04-21T22:02Z,"Puunjab got owned. 
Mstrspctr, do you honestly expect anything but selfish arrogance from an alias named Puunjab, representing a race breeding the most self-absorbed, self-serving immigrant plague, spreading poverty and inanity in wherever is unfortunate enough to allow them to congregate    "

,mtrspctr,2011-04-22T15:26Z,"hey hey now, just because his alias is ""puunjab"" doesn't mean he's an arrogant, ignorant, degenerate cow-fucker. I myself know at least a few intelligent, polite, and interesting Indians and Pakistanis.
so I'm not going to say that puunjab's behaviour is a result of his being an inbred dune-coon....it's probably a result of his parents being inbred dune-coons."

To find out what codecs is needed to play the video file u can check it with gspot, it tells u what is needed and what u have and/or lacking to play the file.
