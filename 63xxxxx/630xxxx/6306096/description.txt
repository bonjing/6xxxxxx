Release Notes:

He may be best-known as the guitarist with that bravely experimental trio Lau
(who won best group for the third year running at last month's Folk awards), but
Kris Drever has all the makings of a solo celebrity. Born in Orkney, he moved
south to join the freewheeling Edinburgh folk scene, in which musicians are
constantly swapping styles and playing in different bands so it's no surprise
that this latest solo album should feature an impressive and varied cast. The
Scottish contingent includes that exquisite fiddle player and producer John
McCusker, along with members of Capercaille. They are joined by the Irish singer
Heidi Talbot, and the celebrated American bluegrass multi-instrumentalist Tim
O'Brien, playing bozouki, mandolin, ukele, fiddle and banjo. This is very
different from a Lau set, for Drever concentrates not on instrumentals
improvisation and virtuoso guitar playing, but on his sturdy vocal work. The
songs range from the self-composed title track to a slinky piece from Boo
Hewerdine and a couple of ballads from that fine veteran Edinburgh songwriter
Sandy Wright, which are as unashamedly emotional as great country songs. A
classy set.
