                School-based drama. The day of the Waterloo Road
                pantomime has finally arrived, but when Finn gets
                Kyle purposefully kicked off the cast, Sam begins to
                doubt their relationship - he is not the boy she
                thought he was. Meanwhile, Denzil learns his lesson
                when his latest stunt ends in tragedy. Elsewhere,
                Jonah sneaks out of school to meet Cesca and they
                rush to Gretna Green, but will the police catch the
                couple before they reach the church?
