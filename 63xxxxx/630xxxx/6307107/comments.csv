The film opens with Fred narrating the story of how he and E.B. met and became co-Easter Bunnies. On Easter Island, E.B. (Russell Brand), a rabbit, is intended to succeed his father (Hugh Laurie) as the Easter Bunny. However, E.B., intimidated by the calling's demands, runs away to Hollywood to pursue his dream of becoming a drummer. While the young rabbit struggles to find a home, unsuccessfully asking Hugh Hefner to take him in at his Playboy mansion, his father sends his royal guard, The Pink Berets, to find his son. Meanwhile baby-chicken Carlos and his music-obsessed assistant Phil plot to take over the Easter organization.

Wandering through Los Angeles, E.B. is hit by Fred O'Hare (James Marsden), an out of work slacker who was driving to the house he is then the caretaker of. Feigning injury, E.B. persuades Fred to take him in as he recovers. Unfortunately, E.B. causes trouble in the home and Fred attempts to abandon him in the wilderness. However, E.B. persuades the human to help him by claiming to be the Easter Bunny, whom Fred saw in operation in his youth. When the rabbit sees the Berets closing in on him while waiting in the parking lot while Fred is having his interview, he is forced to flee into the business. Although he enjoys a successful recording session with the Blind Boys of Alabama as their substitute drummer, he ruins Fred's job interview in the process while getting a tip about an audition opportunity with David Hasselhoff."

,SouthPaw_Chi,2011-04-10T20:48Z,"There's a pretty strong flicker throughout the film, but it's a cam. For me personally, I couldn't watch it.  I see so many people on PirateBay trashing cam uploads. I know some cams are better than others, depending on what the user does to the video prior to uploading, but still,  it's a CAM, you're not going to get DVD-Rip quality from a cam. 

I'd rate it A-5/V-3"
