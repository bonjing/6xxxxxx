DESCRIPTION:


With $8000 and a dream to create a men's lifestyle magazine that he would like to read, Hugh Hefner put together the first issue of Playboy magazine on his kitchen table. Over half a century later, Playboy has grown to become one of most well known brands in the world, and Hefner remains the face of the brand and the ultimate brand champion.

Susan Gunelius uncovers how a brand associated with sex survived and thrived despite attacks from every direction, in an increasingly competitive market and jaded consumers. For over 50 years, Hugh Hefner has lived the Playboy brand promise, and Playboy has become one of the most recognized brands in the world. It's a fascinating story of determination, dedication and belief in a product. It's the story of brand building, brand value, brand longevity and the ultimate brand champion.
