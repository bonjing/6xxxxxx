NOTES:
IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........
This time we have our second run at Sucker Punch......

So we cropped, rotated and resized also adjusted the brightness,rgb,and all of that 
English subs hardcoded in yellow when needed.....
The audio is same LiNE from V1 filtered synced and muxed to our encode......
Enjoy folks!
