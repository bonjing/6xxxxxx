,un1golan,2011-04-08T11:38Z,"My rating:
based on TS:
V 7.5/10 many dark scenes of the movie are not eligible
A 6.5/10 it is supposed to be form some source but has noise and barrel effect. But you will understand all of the message.

Conclusion: Movie is well watchable, but if you can wait, wait. I can't :) "
,cooljoey1356,2011-04-13T03:15Z,I loved the movie bcause i went to the movies to see it. xD it was epic. My rents hated it. 
,Jacxx,2011-04-14T18:14Z,Very good quality for a cam. The only downside is that you can hear the film running in the background xD lite a faint clicking sound.
