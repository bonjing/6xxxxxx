,dantheeducator,2011-04-08T07:22Z,"Great of you as always Pooloop, don't worry too much about people downloading and not commenting, they are probably too lazy to register with Piratebay. I know they appreciate your efforts. Thanks again."

,aesophop,2011-04-13T12:41Z,"thanks so much, you're the man.  i don't mean to sound ungrateful but i watched this game before the barca game and they ruined it by updating every goal, any way to mayb mention in the description which one to watch first for the 2nd legs? again not complaining, just wondering, thanks."
,aesophop,2011-04-13T12:43Z,or i suppose the barca game might have updates on this game in that case there wouldn't really be any avoiding it?
