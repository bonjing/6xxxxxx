CHUCK BERRY HAVE MERCY 
HIS COMPLETE CHESS RECORDINGS (1969-1974)
Label:Chess/Geffen
Released: 26 January 2010
Format; Flac

Fulfilling Phil Chessâ€™s prophecy, Chuck Berry returned to Chess Records in 1969 after a three year stay with Mercury Records.   And it was like he never left, as his very first session produced a great two-sided single, â€œTulaneâ€ b/w â€œHave Mercy Judge.â€ The record didnâ€™t chart, but it was obvious that Chuck was truly â€œback homeâ€ (as his first album back on Chess was called) and already producing high quality â€œChessâ€ recordings once again. 
The 71 tracks here include his only #1 (â€œMy Ding-A-Ling (live)â€), plus 22 previously unreleased recordings, ranging from cool in-studio jams/instrumentals (â€œTurn On The House Lights,â€ â€œRockinâ€™â€) to 4 additional live recordings from the smoking concert that produced the live side of The London Chuck Berry Sessions; from an intimate, small group session in October of 1972 which produced two throwback â€œChuck bluesâ€ tracks, â€œBlues #1â€ and â€œAnnie Lou,â€ to Chuckâ€™s renditions of â€œJambalayaâ€ and â€œDust My Broom.â€   Thereâ€™s also a live version of â€œSouth Of The Borderâ€ only previously released as a â€œBâ€ side in the U.K. and the hot concert London Sessions  performance of â€œRoll â€˜Em Pete,â€ also originally only released in edited form as a â€œBâ€ side with a different rhythm section dubbed in - this set has both the complete original and single versions
