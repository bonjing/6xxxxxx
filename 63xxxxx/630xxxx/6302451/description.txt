[color=darkred][b]Registry Cleaner[/b][/color]

With PC Tools Performance Toolkit, you can safely clean, repair and optimize the Windows Registry with a few simple mouse clicks. Problems with the Windows Registry are a common cause of Windows crashes, slow performance and error messages. PC Tools Performance Toolkit uses a high-performance detection algorithm to quickly identify missing and invalid references in your Windows Registry. These problems can occur for many reasons including incorrect or incomplete removal of software, missing or corrupt hardware drivers or orphaned startup programs. With a few easy steps, PC Tools Performance Toolkit will scan your entire registry for any invalid entries and list the registry errors found so you can choose to selectively clean each item or automatically repair all errors. PC Tools Performance Toolkit will also make a backup of any repairs made to your registry so that you can easily recover any changes if needed.

Privacy Protection

The Privacy Guardian feature of PC Tools Performance Toolkit guarantees your privacy by ensuring that all traces of your online and computer activities are permanently erased and unrecoverable on your PC. Information from every website you visit is stored on your computer and recorded in hidden Windows locations including temporary files, cookies, system registry and the index.dat file. Web browsers only provide partial privacy protection by allowing some temporary internet files and cookies to be deleted. Privacy Guardian cleans data from all the hidden files and deletes the data securely. It also frees valuable hard drive space and speeds up system performance by cleaning old and unused temporary records. PC Tools Performance Toolkit allows you to simply and securely erase sensitive files from Windows, Microsoft Office, Netscape, Windows Media Player and Internet Explorer.
File Recovery

PC Tools Performance Toolkit's File Recover allows you to recover critically important documents and other files that have been lost by accidental deletion. These files may be lost by emptying the Recycle Bin or using other deletion actions that bypass the Recycle Bin altogether. When a file is deleted in either manner, the file can no longer be recovered by the Windows Operating System. However, the content of the file still remains on the drive, relatively intact, until the section of the drive it occupies is overwritten by another file. File Recover identifies the contents of these lost files on the hard drive and allows you to recover them. If a file has been partially overwritten, File Recover attempts to reconstruct as much of the file as possible with the remaining contents. This allows you to salvage at least part, if not all, of that recovered file to continue using it as required.
System Optimization

PC Tools Performance Toolkit provides optimization and performance features that allow you to actively monitor system usage, processes, CPU, memory and disk space. The Startup Manager disables unnecessary programs during Windows start up to speed up boot times. The registry compacting feature analyzes, rebuilds and compacts the Windows Registry by removing registry gaps and corrupt keys to free space, thereby making your PC startup quicker and with more available memory. The system optimization function applies a set of tweaks and patches directly onto your PC that are designed to improve system performance and usability.
Hard Disk Tools

PC Tools Performance Toolkit includes a disk checker and optimizer that keep your hard drives fast and your data safe. Hard drive defragmenting tools optimize the files on your hard disk for faster access, while the repair tools ensure that your drives are healthy, error-free, and not prone to failure.
