I think everyone would love this idea!

Thanks!"

u can easily sort ur prob with itunes by after adding all songs to ur library change to a list vew & highlight all the top 40 singles then right click & goto get info & change the Album Artist to VA & click ok. Change back to album cover view or what ever u use n they will all be in one folder."
