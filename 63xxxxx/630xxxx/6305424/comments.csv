,TripSol,2011-05-21T05:45Z,"followed the instructions to the letter and it installed well enough, a little long but what'dya expect. Ran the wow.exe file and an error message popped up saying ""Failed to find suitble disply. Exiting Program."" i'm on an inspirion 9300 laptop, am i missing a video driver for this game? Can a laptop run it, im assuming it can?"
,swaba,2011-06-26T15:58Z,"Well. Laptops can use wow too but u need to have installed an video card program software to play it.
And at least wow consumes from 512-XXXX MB of RAM but 512 is at least that u can use the wow with minimum graphic problems and cuts but no wow errors."
,swaba,2011-06-26T16:01Z,I hope so i helped u!?
[T],FatFreddy39,2011-07-14T03:28Z,"Game runs perfectly. Thanks,

Seed people to get the server pop up, I wanna do raids!"
,corpse4523,2011-08-04T19:48Z,WoW patches keep saying i have older version why are they in the package if they wont work??
,Atharol,2011-08-22T01:42Z,"NOTE* This server swaped from a 255 level cap server into just an 70 with really highrate xp cap one. So dont bother to read the info.

This is Lowlvl Saying Goodbye to Many sweet years of Merciless."
