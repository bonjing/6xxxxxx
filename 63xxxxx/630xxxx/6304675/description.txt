Advanced File Recovery Algorithms

 The file recovery software incorporates a variety of advanced algorithms allowing Magic Uneraser to recover deleted files and folders that other file recovery products canâ€™t even see. The tool carefully scans the entire hard disk or reads the whole memory card block after block. Comparing information it reads from the disk with a database of recognized file formats, the file recovery algorithm is able to locate deleted files such as documents, pictures, archives, movies and music even if no record of them is left in the file system.
By using advanced file recovery algorithms, Magic Uneraser can successfully recover files and folders from deleted partitions, repartitioned and formatted disks. Even if the disk is completely inaccessible and suffered a crash, file recovery software can still access the disk, locate and recover files from its surface.
