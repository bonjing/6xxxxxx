Amazing sitar psychedelia from the early 70's!!! Dutch hippie Okko combined his instrument, sitar, with rock and electronic elements. The result was a tremendous album with some cool original tracks like '' Ganges delta'' , '' Himalaya highway'' or '' East Indian Traffic'' , together with a couple of brilliant Beatles' covers, all of it with great sitar of course, but also moog, tablas, flute, guitars, bass and drums. The album should please anyone into psychedelia, rock, sitar sounds and funky sitaresque stuff ala Ananda Shankar in its most rocking version.
