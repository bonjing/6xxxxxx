,Psychic Vampire,2011-04-07T01:12Z,I know but episode 13 is not DIMENSION
[V],GoodFilms,2011-04-07T11:47Z,That's because DIMENSION's episode 13 was nuked for being out of synch. There is nothing special about DIMENSION...
,Psychic Vampire,2011-04-07T22:40Z,"I didn't know it was nuked or that episode 20 was released the same day I uploaded my 1-19 torrent.

I never paid any attention to the distributors name before. You and Konashine are awesome. I feel so small and insignificant. There is no way I can keep up with you guys.

I uploaded this torrent most for fun, but it really is unnecessary.

This one however is not:
