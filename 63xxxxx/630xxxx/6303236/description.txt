This is a fine documentary that covers the difficult and erratic life of Billie Holiday. There are interviews with such associates as Carmen McRae, Annie Ross, Buck Clayton, and Harry "Sweets" Edison, among others. Although Ruby Dee's readings from Lady Day's largely fictional memoirs are a bit frivolous, the clips (particularly the rare ones taken from 1958 and 1959 television shows) are quite fascinating. Overall, this interesting tribute is quite even-handed and worth acquiring by Billie Holiday collectors and admirers.
