,uthacalthing,2011-04-17T16:26Z,"To the idiots complaining about their antivirus scanners finding a trojan:

Q: What do a lot of the viruses out there do? 
A: Modify system files, such as executables, DLLs and drivers.

So, your antivirus software is designed to look for code that does this sort of thing, and if it gets a match, will alert for a possible trojan.

Think about what you're downloading - a piece of software that's designed to install and/or update drivers.  Version 11 now also (as per the description):

- Detects installed anti-virus software
- Creates System Restore points.

Ovbiously, software that does all of this is going to be flagged by antivirus scanners - I'd be worried if my scanner DIDN'T say something - means it's a crap antivirus product!

In other words, you need to read descriptions, stop being so paranoid, get a clue and start using your brains people!"

No, if you're not installing windows on 5-15 different machines every day this is not useful. If you are, it saves you ridiculous amounts of time. Just uncheck install of the yandex bar, is that so hard? 

By the way, for those who don't know, It is based on the work of driverpacks.net, which you can use to integrate all those drivers into a multi-boot DVD or windows install, making almost universal windows installation media. Combine with a multiboot such as isolinux on a dual layer DVD and you can squeeze windows XP and 7 x86/x64 on + HBCD with just enough room. Instant magic-dvd."

,LIONofHUME,2012-03-15T19:09Z,"Hey newbs, driver pack solution has been around a while. Its open source and can be a life saver to many. Itâs this large because it can be used offline; the only drawback is you have to download the whole thing in order to get the latest drivers, as is the case here as version 12.3 is out now. As with all open source content you need to use your brain a little. Here are a few tips to remember when using this software.


1. I do not recommend you use this software just to update your drivers âfor the hell of itâ. If you want to update drivers, make sure you have a reason to do so, and go to your PC makerâs site to look for these.
2. Make sure to uncheck all items in the âProgramsâ tab. Only install the drivers; do not install the programs, especially anything mail.ru related.
3. If you are going to use it, backup your drivers first (use DriverBackup).
4. If the software recommends going online for driver update, and pages open that are in Russian or in a language you do not understand, do not proceed. Only proceed if you understand what it going on.
5. Bear in mind that this software might not install all drivers that your PC needs.
6. There is also a chance that some devices might be accidentally disabled. This can happen.

,nwabunnia,2012-05-15T19:17Z,"I know this is a little off the point but I need an assistance.

Sometime ago, I installed a program with a 30-day trial period - at least the manufacturer said it's for 30 days trial. I discovered that whenever I start the program, the number of trial days will reduce (that is, instead of counting the trial per day, it is per usage.

After 30 usages, I was told my trial period was over. I uninstalled it with Revo Uninstaller and used CCleaner and TuneUp Utilities to clean the registry. I then restarted my system and installed the program again but still got the trial expired error.

My question is: is there a way to completely remove traces of any installed program and stop it from giving the issues highlighted above? That is, to keep reinstalling and using it as trial indefinitely? Please any useful info will be appreciate greatly."

1) the number of seeders is at 55 because it is what your client is set at.

2) if there was spyware atleast someone else would have found it, the torrent would be gone by now and the uploader would not have a trusted skull.
