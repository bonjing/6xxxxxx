Breaking In is an offbeat half-hour workplace comedy about a high-tech security firm that takes extreme - and often questionable - measures to sell their protection services. Created by Adam F. Goldberg and Seth Gordon, the series centers on a team of uniquely skilled oddball geniuses hand-picked to work for a manipulative mastermind. Contra Security, corporate America's answer to "The A-Team," gives clients a sense of security by first ripping it away. The firm is led by Oz (Christian Slater), a larger-than-life head honcho who is a man of mystery and master of manipulation. The members of the odd squad include alluring bad girl Melanie (Odette Yustman), who is in charge of lock-picking, safe-cracking and heart-breaking; and CASH (Alphonso McAuley), a fan boy who specializes in strategy, logistics and office pranks only a mad genius could think up.
