It took some time and effort to collect every single episode, a total of 40 episodes.

This series goes under different names, Locked Up Abroad in the US and Banged Up Abroad in the UK.

Locked Up Abroad with 39 episodes over 4 seasons whilst
Banged Up Abroad is 40 episodes over 7 seasons + Kidnapped Abroad


It's essentially the same with the exception of Locked Up Abroad which is missing 1 episode.

Every 40 episode is included in this release.

Source is HDTV and most episodes are in the 350 mb range, some few are 450-500 mb and one episode is only 230ish mb, and is of worse quality. However, I could not find a replacement and had to settle with it.



I urge to help keep seeding this as it has been difficult to find every single episode. Mostly there are one episode here, and one there, and so on.



I hope you enjoy.
