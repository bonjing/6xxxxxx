,lockedup1,2011-06-02T09:56Z,"Hmm. If anyone have trouble downloading this with failed trackers please report it.

I could upload it again with more trackers included in the torrent.

,rendezvous,2011-07-01T14:29Z,The new season started last month but I haven't seen any episodes online anywhere. Anyone have them?
,lockedup1,2011-08-27T21:36Z,They are nowhere to be found on the internet as of yet. :( 
,lockedup1,2011-09-01T21:48Z,"Locked.Up.Abroad.S02E01.Korea and Locked.Up.Abroad.S02E03.Phillippines are duplicates. The real episode 3 Philippines can be found at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6644998/Locked.Up.Abroad.S02E03.Philippines__missing_in_the_complete_40_

Sorry for this mixup guys, it happened when I took season 2 from another tracker. Not sure how I could mix it up, but it happened."
