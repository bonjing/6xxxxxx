Your an ignoramus.  Aspect ratio was always a matter of controversy with Kubrick. Speaking somewhat cynically here, widescreen is a ""concept"" that the movie studios came up with to distinguish itself from the threat of television, and there's really no study to show that it's ""better"" or that ""more people prefer it"". As a director, Kubrick clearly was not a fan of letterboxing. 
So, despite being older, it is truer to the way Kubrick intended it to be seen."
