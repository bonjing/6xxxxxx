"Charlie Curries a Favor from Todd"

When Charlie (Diedrich Bader) loses his 
call center job, Todd (Ben Rappaport) 
hesitantly hires him until he finds a new 
one. However, Charlie has a hard time not 
being the manager, which causes friction 
with Todd. To make matters worse, Todd 
also learns Charlie is going through a 
mid-life crisis. Meanwhile, Rajiv (Rizwan 
Manji) concocts an unusual plan to raise 
money for his honeymoon and manages to 
enlist Gupta's (Parvesh Cheena) help in 
his scheme.

Enjoy :)
