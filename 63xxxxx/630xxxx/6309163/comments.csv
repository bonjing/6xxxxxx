,zogulusnig,2011-04-12T02:01Z,"Anyone have a good link to where I can read up on how to play a Wiiware game on a hacked Wii?

Is it as easy as putting onto a WBFS formatted USB drive and playing with a USB loader?

Thanks, either way!"
,Neovenator1,2011-04-12T14:34Z,How can you convert this wad into a iso?
,jjeshop32,2011-04-12T18:38Z,"didn't know you could convert to iso, i just install with wad manager"
,Neovenator1,2011-04-12T20:41Z,Never used wad manager. Using wbfs manager . . .
,zogulusnig,2011-04-12T23:41Z,"Amongst the scene, there is an application called ""WAD2ISO"" that I suspect strongly will turn a WAD into an ISO.

So, if I convert this WAD to am ISO, can I then either burn it and play using DarkCorp, or do I need to install the resulting ISO on a WBFS formatted USB drive?

Otherwise, do I just drop the game in a folder on the USB drive and load with a USB loader?

Anyone?"
,jjeshop32,2011-04-13T00:47Z,What is the benefit of converting wads to iso? I haven't heard of anyone doing that.
,zogulusnig,2011-04-13T08:22Z,"I believe the wisdom lies in that the ISO can then be burned to DVD and played like a ""normal"" game?"
