This torrent contains an app. That will download the following files:

370 MMF Extensions, HWA Build 249, MMF Developer, Build251 and extras. Just extract the app. and run. Wait until download finishes (you should hit the button that checks for errors after the download completes)

1)Run "Multimedia Fusion Developer Setup".Install build251 (cracked by RED21a, suprbay forum member) and remember to go to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Clickteam\Multimedia Fusion Developer 2 (with regedit, Start > Run > Type: regedit), and change the ufo key's last two digts to 99, if not already done.

2) After installed, please note that, Build251 has no Splash screen, so wait until it loads completely, even if it seems like it froze. 

3) Build250 is not necessary to install, just included it here in case something went wrong. 

4) In case you need to install build250, last two digits of ufo registry key, need to be 95 first. After install, change to 99.

5) Run 370 Extensions + HWA 249+Extra Graphics and finish Setup.

  Note: on some very old versions of Windows 95, the program may get stuck at startup.

 the program, and then restart it while pressing 
  the CTRL key and select "Never" in the Check For Update options in the Preferences.
