,Banzay27,2012-01-08T17:04Z,"Worked flawlessly. If you're perplexed why the game won't run Direct3D: it can't. The plugin for the rain makes it incompatible.
If you wonder why the option is there, it's because it's a third party launcher, used in multiple such games.

I'm not sure whether to call it short or only the most intuitive adventure game I've played (because that it is, short or not). I played through it in a breeze, all that you must do to progress is logical and doesn't require the dread old adventure game method of using everything on everything, everywhere. No, you should have a good idea of what needs using when and where. I recall there being only a single part, about halfway through, when what you had to do was so out of the way that it'll be difficult not to resort to a guide.
Here's a hint: kill the lights on that floor."
,Banzay27,2012-01-09T20:39Z,"Forgot to remove this page from my bookmarks. But it served to remind me one thing I forgot to mention in my previous comment: I lament that I can't pay for this game; indies are always a different level and this is one I would support in paying it's small price.

I would've if I could - I obviously can afford to, but online purchasing without a credit card (rather than a debit card) is rather tricky... in that it takes some running around and, more importantly, it feeds the fat cats
Once, the bank charged me 3â‚¬ to transfer 17â‚¬ (to pay a friend back for buying Left4Dead). Never again."
