Ummm.... Are the notes of this rip supposed to be sarcastic?

""....remove 99% of the noise....we changed all the rgb colours to make them natural...""

This movie is supposed to be a grindhouse movie and look pretty raw and rough around the edges with grain or noise. Reading those notes makes me feel like you've stripped it from it's intentional look."
