On summer solstice day (June 21st) 1984, rock legends Hawkwind played a milestone show on the historic site of Stonehenge. To celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the historic show, we present a full-length version of the event for the first time on DVD. Along with the stunning visual and audio performance from the band there is also footage of the festival site and some amazing material of the world's most famous stones at dawn. Amongst the tracks featured are "Stonehenge Decoded" and "Dawn" written especially for the performance.
