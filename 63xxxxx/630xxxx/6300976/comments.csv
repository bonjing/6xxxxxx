,torz02,2011-04-07T15:43Z,how to make a key file for KIS?
,Jenenji,2011-04-08T08:32Z,"I must be Tard'd today. I tried just about all of the KIS key and get this message:

""Wrong activation code. Activation error. Activation code is incorrect""

I never have issues with KIS keys and have activated them many times before. Anyone have a suggestion on to activate it with these keys?"
