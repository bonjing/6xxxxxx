,Weedalot,2011-04-20T03:17Z,"after doing as explained in the provided ""read me"" in the link above it still tries to download 400+ MB after finished installing.. even though the files are there... and it fails to download them anyways, any ideas?"
,lambo_sv,2011-04-20T12:33Z,"i got some problems aswel..
First of all i tried to cache data provided in you'r other torrent and copied it to mine phone installing it with the samsung apk ( i got a SGS).

When i start the game, i get the same problem as weedalot, it still needs to download the data, which i copied to the right place... and which fails to download.

In mine second try i deleted evrything and preformed a clean install with the apk only, and downloaded the cache files from the gameloft servers directly on mine mobile.
It had to restart the download alot because it failed some times but afterall, i got the full files. Then i start the game (with wifi on) and i experience the same error as vscott453, the game just quits after showing the intro. Switching off/on wifi doesn't change it..

Even tried another apk found somewhere on a chinese site, the new error i got when trying to download the files was that it din't detected a active internet conection (but mine wifi is working).

So plz, can some1 provide me a apk witch is cracked corectly and works?

thx"
