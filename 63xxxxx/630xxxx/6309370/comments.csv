,hack-E-sack,2011-04-11T09:12Z,"And just one more request. And I'll stay out your hair for a while.

If you have any more sets of (Ebony) Diamond as well. I would love those.

You placed her in the torrent below:

Once again, major thanks.

I'll look for some more of Diamond 039 later this evening."
[V],bestec1234,2011-04-11T13:48Z,"In fact, if you do IRC, join #thepiratebay.org on irc.efnet.net and PM me or ask in the channel.  Love to hear from you."

,hack-E-sack,2011-04-12T02:19Z,I've never tried IRC. I'll look into.
