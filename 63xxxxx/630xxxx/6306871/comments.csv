,ClammieR,2011-04-10T01:11Z,"This was a test torrent, was never supposed to have 40+ leechers, lol.

As for the torrent itself, tomorrow after race you can expect an upload within 60minutes max, without any commercials, different encoding and much smaller size (should be possible to make it max 1,4GB).

P.S. RAR files are there because I've split it in 10MB parts for faster/easier seeding, so only first leecher should have very slow download, others should be getting higher speeds. And english description is there because this is english public torrent, not croatian. Many people are more interested in video itself, not audio, so those who aren't speaking croatian can still download it :)"
