I've always believed that gore is the sad excuse for lack of talent and Argento is an example. The really brilliant ones can frighten you out of your wits without even showing any mangled and bloody body part, for example the best haunted house film I ever watched was British and really frightening and you never saw any monster, just bending thick doors hinting there was something horrible on the other side, it was The Haunting. 
Forbidden Planet was such a masterpiece, when I was 14 in spite of the silly parts of Robbie the robot and the romantic ones, the sight of the laboratory of the Krel held me spellbound... I must have watched it 12 times at least."

My mission though is to get all of these out no matter which ones I enjoy more than the others.  Forbidden Planet is my second favorite sci-fi movie of all time, The Day the Earth Stood Still being the best sci-fi movie ever made IMO.  I don't upload those though and many of the blockbusters of the day as they are already on The Bay and well seeded.

Thanks and Enjoy!"
