Alicia and Michelle are sisters who grew up as inseparable friends until one night and one bad decision tore them apart. Alicia says her sister, Michelle, destroyed her family when she slept with Aliciaâ€™s fiancÃ©, while she was with their baby in the next room. Michelle says it was the biggest mistake of her life and is desperate to prove to Alicia that sheâ€™s changed. The siblings face each other for the first time in more than a year. Then, Nicole says her relationship with her sister, Amanda, is strained because she doesnâ€™t approve of Amandaâ€™s fiancÃ© or the choices that sheâ€™s making. Amanda says Nicole is the queen of manipulation and is jealous of her life. Can Dr. Phil broker a peace between these siblings and help them repair their broken relationships?
