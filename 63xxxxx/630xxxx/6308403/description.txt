Cookie

From BBC Radio 7. Written by Jacqueline Wilson; Read by Alice Connor. Abridged.

Beauty Cookson is no beauty. Sheâ€™s a plain, timid girl surrounded by super-confident, snooty girls at school. Worse than the teasing in the playground, though, is the unpredictable criticism from her father. Frequently berated for breaking any of Dadâ€™s hyper-fussy house rules, as well as for her lack of looks, confidence and friends, Beauty lives in uneasy fear whenever Dadâ€™s at home. Her pretty, sweet mum is equally subject to Dadâ€™s tirades. Eventually, after an unbearable birthday party and a very real fear that Dadâ€™s temper is out of control, Mum and Beauty run away.
