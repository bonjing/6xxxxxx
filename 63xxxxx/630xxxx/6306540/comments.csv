Thank you !"

,ClearAzi,2011-10-10T19:37Z,"It's downloaded ! Thank you!

Audio Problem: I have tried two different machines, two different media players, but no sound. Fiddled with the buttons but nothing. In Media Player Classic, there small button bottom right hand corner comes with with an audio speaker symbol with a small cross next to it. On other vids (with sound) the normal symbol is there. Windows Media Player gives not sound either. Any ideas ? Subtitles are working fine. TIA"

Don't know your problem, it works fine here.
And I don't know much about Windows Media Player either... The sound codec is ac3 nothing stange. However, try this media player instead:

http://kmplayer.en.softonic.com

It's free and should solve your problem, I think. "
,ClearAzi,2011-10-14T22:26Z,"Thank you so much for this suggestion: The sound plays. I considered myself a big expert on getting video and audio to run but not anymore. And now I have yet another video player and a good one. 

I will make tomorrow night the big night for the viewing.

Thanks again buddy."
,ClearAzi,2011-10-20T19:31Z,Downloaded a newer version of Mplayer Classic and it also works. Looks like I had let my versions get behind.
