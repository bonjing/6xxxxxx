so please just a couple of people at least please seed"

,microchip2,2011-05-01T11:29Z,"You guys owe me, bigtime. There we no seeds at all, I've tracked down the files in question from other torrents, and re-seeded the whole thing. It'll take another 24-36 hours or so to get seeded back up, but I couldn't sit and watch 554 of you at the last count suffer...

Why they stuck a 1.3GB version of one of the files in there was beyond me though.

I can't believe this went seedless though with so many people around..."
