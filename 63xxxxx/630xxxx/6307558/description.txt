Plot:
A body-swapping lakorn starring Bee Namthip and Pang Ornjira. Bee is Wikanda, a rich woman with a cheating husband named Apiwat played by James Ruengsak. Pang is Kaewta, she is married to Wanchai (Guy Ratchanon), they have a wonderful marriage, loving and sweet. Kaewta works for Wikanda at her spa. After a car accident where Wikanda is chasing down her husbandâ€™s mistress and Kaewta is in the car with her, they lose consciousness and wake up to discover they have swap bodies. How? They donâ€™t know.

Seeing that Wikanda is not of her right mind, Apiwat takes her home and drugs her with various psychotic pills. He wants her inheritance and this is his best chance to steal it.

One night, Wikanda in Kaewta's body sneaks into her home to find Apiwat snuggling it up with Saisawat (Pei Parnward), her personal secretary of all people. Because she is in Kaewta's body, she can't do anything about it. Before leaving, she steals all of her financial papers and devises a plan to make Kaewta (in her body) hire her as a servant, so that she can protect her assets and get back at her snake of a husband Apiwat.

Kaewta's wishes are more basic. She just wants to get back with her loving husband Wanchai. Though in Wikanda's body, she tries to contact her husband and calls for him but he keeps rejecting her because physically what he sees is not his wife.
