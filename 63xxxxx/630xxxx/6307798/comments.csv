some of the worst acting iv'e ever seen,good story line though.no offence to the uploader,thanks for sharing but yeah,i hated it."
,kaya.md,2011-04-12T10:25Z,"the first part of the movie is about some homoerotic guys trying to look like gangsters, which fails totally.
In the beginning a woman sings in a r&B style music which is totally out of context regarding the period:WW 2
This movie was made by Pentagon in order for young men to romanticize about war. 
If you liked saving private ryan, that ignore this one. They just keep Yapping"
,kaya.md,2011-04-12T10:29Z,THC thanx for the upload
