well i'd agree with everyone on ""rubber"" ripmate.
it was a waste doing Rubber (2010) encode..
[and downlaoding that was kinda waste too]
probably the worst horror movie ever.

have to be more carefull when ""accepting the requests right away""
lot more careful (cos imdb rating doesn't seem to be speaking the very truth)

about 'send requests to facebook wall'
not everybody likes using facebook bhai
so pls be kind enough to check upto 3 or 4 torrents down here in comments for any requests or stuff.... 

we all appreciate your good work.
just making sure that nothing goes in waste.
be more careful when doing rips.. as we dont want the number of seeders go down in 24 hours or so/
think it's a good thing to mention like 2-3 names of movies that's ""coming up"" on small rip...
so we can say if it's worth the effort.
once again.... thx for everything.
keep the good work up.
jai ho."

but... no time for you to give a high five for the uploader ?
say if you are glad for the quality-size of the encode....
anything???
or just click on the plus (+) sign in order to help the encoder to reach a green scull...
well thats the least you could do guys...
so why holding back?"
