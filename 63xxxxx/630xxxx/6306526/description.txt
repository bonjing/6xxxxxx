The A.B.C. Murders is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie and first

 published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on January 6, 1936[1] and in the US by

 Dodd, Mead and Company on February 14 of the same year[2]. The UK edition retailed 

 at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6)[3] and the US edition at $2.00[2].

 The book features the characters of Hercule Poirot, Arthur Hastings and Chief 

 Inspector Japp. The form of the novel is unusual, combining first and third-person 

 narrative. Christie had previously experimented with this approach (famously

 pioneered by Charles Dickens in Bleak House), in her novel The Man in the Brown 

 Suit. What is unusual in The A.B.C. Murders is that the third-person narrative is 

 supposedly reconstructed by the first-person narrator, Hastings. This approach

 shows 

 Christie's commitment to experimenting with point of view, famously exemplified by 

 The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.

A serial killer is murdering apparently random people in order of their names: 

first Alice Ascher of Andover, second Betty Barnard of Bexhill-on-Sea, third Sir 

Carmichael Clarke of Churston. The killer sends a letter to Hercule Poirot before 

each murder, telling him where and when each murder will take place, but Poirot and 

the police always arrive too late. The killer signs himself 'ABC' and at the place 

of each murder, leaves an ABC Railway Guide next to the body.
