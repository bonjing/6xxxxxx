How are you ?...I hope you're well !

Thanks for the last fifteen of  ""one of the greatest tv shows of all time!"" , as you said. And it's true !
May be too late to ask you about the subtitles for these episodes !?
                                             Regards
"

Sorry, no subs this time - these are not my rips, and it's the way I found them.

Best regards,
Soundtrekker


P.S. I need help for seeding eps. 16-30 for the next weeks or so - there are still fans not aware of my uploads right now, but are gonna come aboard soon. I can't possible seed 24/7 on this, so any help would be much appreciated! Just keep the torrent in your client and look if any help is needed for a while!"
