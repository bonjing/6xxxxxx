,anon197,2011-04-14T14:34Z,"So if I have got a TPB *cough* version of logic, can I update it with this or is this 100% legitimate? "
,roddyf52,2011-04-26T06:24Z,Yes . Will Update PB *cough* version of logic
,chriskeyz1,2011-04-28T18:35Z,"Wow, worked for me!  SOoooo happy.  Its really easy to do. I was overthinking it too much at first but its simple. Unzip all files to desktop, the second file didnt seem to unzip anything??...  But then I ran the update, then stuck the three files in Library>Application Support>ProApps folder and voila!  No more Serial!!!!!  Yesssss! Mainstage back on just before rehearsal tonight!  Saweet!  xD"
,pro-jekt,2011-05-21T03:33Z,"call me a noob, but i cant work out how to use this, .rar files i have never opened before? what do i do with these? please explain :)"
,maxje.b,2011-06-03T17:35Z,"@ pro-jekt, just download unrarx @ unrarx.com and click the logo to download. Then just open the .rar files and it will automaticly extract. It's just a .zip file but now it is an .rar compression."
,wmzaphod,2011-06-05T15:22Z,"This worked fine on my 9.1.4, no more serial ...."
