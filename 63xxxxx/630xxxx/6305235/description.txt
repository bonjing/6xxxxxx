Artist: Blackburn & Snow
Title: Something Good for Your Head
Genre: Psychedelic Folk Rock
Origin: US

The music of Jeff Blackburn and Sherry Snow is an aural representation of what it was like to be young, turned-on, and in love during the early days of Haight-Ashbury circa 1965-1966. Yet another forgotten countercultural Bay Area act from one of America's most creative decades of the 20th century, this duo straddled the divisions between folk, folk rock, and psychedelia and helped define the first-wave San Francisco Sound. Despite recording an album's worth of material and having two singles released during their existence, Blackburn & Snow never realized their vast potential and were ultimately relegated to the periphery of a scene that they helped establish.
