,waxlrose,2012-01-28T14:15Z,"As soon as I saw this, I thought of this British show called Snuff Box. It's about two guys who are professional hangmen... but they only work about once or twice per month. Sometimes things go wrong when they DO hang someone... like one guy's head pops off and lands in the preacher's hands. It takes him a second to realize what it is, and when he does, he gets grossed out and throws it to the nearest guy. Then it becomes like a macabre game of hot potato. LMAO! Look for the clip on Youtube :-)"
