,mirceadobre78,2011-05-11T15:37Z,"guys, stop trying to make this version work. The red mark it will appear every few seconds.

You can go to the official website and download the old version of Twixtor 4.5.11 for FCP. Then open KCNScrew and look for username and pass, or see bellow:
Name = The Blade
Serial = b2c6TQYpt5nAKXxH
License = Pro

But you need the older version of Twixtor, for the 5.1.2 there is now patch or username on KCNScrew.
For me it worked like a charm. "
