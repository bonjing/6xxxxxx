,sseanbroken,2011-04-10T04:39Z,"great work guys!! been waiting too long for this.  just looks like youre watching it on comcast on demand. i suggest using vlc to play it so you can tweak the brightness..contrast..etc.. not many people realize if you use vlc and if a movies too dark.. or the audios not what youd like.. you can fix it.. again.. many many thanks guys.

,vernernet,2011-04-10T05:39Z,"Is this also some G rated version like 'the eagle'?
Does PPV do their own editing?"
,richardpa,2011-04-10T05:40Z,"Decent PPVRip and a fast download... 
A/7 
V/7 (Shot in 4:3 format)...
There's a couple of focus problems here and there and the audio is a bit low and tinny in places, but still a very watchable copy... 
Many Thanx to IwannaFan2 and IFLIX for the Decent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"
,dukara,2011-04-10T11:47Z,"People, plis tell my, can I find polish subtitles for this version ?  "

,LLeny,2011-04-10T12:26Z,Sampel is good. The film is detected as a virus
,vergil80,2011-04-10T19:04Z,"for those who want's to know,PPVRIP it's less than DVDSCR ,and a little more than a CAM or TS,and much much less than a R5."
,vergil80,2011-04-10T19:14Z,I'LL WAIT FOR R5 
,madmustang,2011-04-10T21:45Z,"all real

,majuaraan,2011-04-11T00:06Z,"wait one comment sayd a/v 5 and another says a/v 8, man this rating system is all discombobulated "
,ProudFather,2011-04-11T01:57Z,"Some people are just to picky,If you are a real picky pearson then wait for a Dvdrip,Or go buy it,Or see it in the theater.
It is not a Dvdrip,But a PPV rip is the next best thing,I am happy with the quality,And so is the rest of my family,Thanks for the hard work IwannaFan26.
Iwill seed for as long as i can."

,fobskuks,2011-04-11T14:27Z,any screen shots??
,CatsInSilkPants,2011-04-11T23:15Z,Beware: Pan and scan - and not great quality.
,Zoolandr,2011-04-12T00:27Z,"I just got a $829.99 iPad2 for 117.37 and if you think thats awesome - my neighbour snagged a $999 Sony Vaio for only $92.73, its being delivered to his home tomorrow. I would be a fool to ever pay high retail prices at places like Walmart or Bestbuy again. I even sold a 37""  HDTV to my boss for $600 that I only paid $78.24 for. I use  SnagBids.com"
,deusbraga,2011-04-12T00:30Z,is there no english subtitle for this version anywhere?
,SecretAgentMan23,2011-04-12T03:11Z,do PPV edit there own videos??? i think its all there but some parts are all short.
,TheTruthShallHateYouMe,2011-04-12T03:32Z,"I just snagged a Bugatti Veyron for $1.97 and my neighbor got a 1,000 inch Samsung Led TV for .88 cents. We use Scambids.com"
,Criminalzq,2011-04-12T17:01Z,some parts are censored. but overall v-8 a-9

excellent movie, few sappy moments but it's saved by Anthony Hopkins(who is imo one of the best actors of all time)

thx IWannaFan2"
,shiftedx9,2011-04-13T06:36Z,"@majuaraan, there is no rating system. everyone has their own. the best you can do is sort thru all the comments and come up with an average, this process i find works pretty well in giving me an indication of how i will view the overall quality"
,aroyals,2011-04-13T10:39Z,"@hannibal4king some of us have lives beyond the computer screen so ppv doesn't mean a thing to us.

go out and get some sunshine/get laid then maybe you won't be an asshole all of your life"
,outpatient730,2011-04-13T10:43Z,"IwannaFan2 can eat a dick, none of these work for NERO conversion. PAN AND SCAN! Be warned, PPVRIP does not convert on NERO and from what I hear the IP's are sending out emails stating not to illegally download movies FUCK PPVRIP and fuck all anyone affiliated with him/her/group/whatthefuckevercocksucke"
,Minist3r,2011-04-13T13:13Z,Thanks for this download IwannaFan2.

Movie - 4

Most self-proclaimed movie buffs will enjoy this, and the only reason I gave this movie a 4 instead of a 1 is because of Sir Anthony Hopkins. So much potential for a showcase of amazing Italian ass and titties in this movie, yet none to speak of...{sigh}"
,DrMD,2011-04-14T08:47Z,"Decent A/V(7both) for a ppv but he movie leaves something to be desired, it's a 6.To be really scary along the lines of what the film was trying to convey, the devil should have had a much more damning insight in the exorcists.Pretty blah."
,stevkat,2011-04-14T09:04Z,"DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT, WE RECEIVED A THREATENING EMAIL FROM ISP/WARNER BROS OF AN INFRINGEMENT NOTICE."
,Tsarli,2011-04-17T01:52Z,"Is PPVRIP a not-so-clever disguise for what is just really a Cam copy? Some folks will go to great lengths to disguise their pathetic Cam copies, calling them R5s, etc. What's the verdict on this one? Cam copy in disguise?"
,lambofgodman,2011-04-17T16:11Z,Thanks for the up.Excellent quality.Keep up the great work.
