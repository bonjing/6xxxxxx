Everytime i download something here its always subbed. or in a format that doesnt work with windows media or xbox. Hopefully you'll upload more. Excel Saga has no english dub on here.

,Exaskryz,2011-05-06T03:58Z,"My method for extracting streams is saving the stream file itself, often a .flv file. But this was years ago. I used FireFox with the addon Tamper Data, which lacks an intuitive GUI, but it can be figured out pretty easily. If you follow the http address where the streamed media is located, FireFox should ask if you want to open or save the file. Save it, and you're set."
