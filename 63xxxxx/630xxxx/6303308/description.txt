Melodic, experimental folk three-piece consisting of one songsmith (F), one sound-painter (O) and one conceptual artist (A). All three of them live and work in MalmÃ¶, Sweden and create music in a secluded 19th-century garden shack. Some people call their music surreal. A lot of people call the music soothing. Almost everyone says it makes them think of trees.
The band returns April 12th with their third full length album, Flora. Recorded in their ramshackle garden studio, Flora marks a departure from the wintry moods of the bandâ€™s first two outings as according to Fredrik, flower season is anything but limonades and hammocks. The music paints a vision of summer as the darkness beneath, a busy, feverish, sprawling organic chaos. The three members build songs from dense, wavering textures of voice, strings, brass and twinkly home-made folk instruments, all couched on top of a smattering of haywire orchestral drums and swirly electronics. In keeping with all their previous work, thereâ€™s the attention to detail, the unfailing knack for melody-making and the misadventures in hyper-soprano singing, not to mention Fredrik Hultinâ€™s restful, abstract storytelling.
