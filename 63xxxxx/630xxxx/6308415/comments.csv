However, you NEED to examine the True Origins of the Abrahamic Religions.

Judaism/Christianity/Islam, are referred as such, by so-called, Theologian Scholars of these Mythologies.

THERE WAS NO INVISIBLE JEW GOD !
NO ADAM & EVE !
NO NOAH""S FLOOD !
NO TOWER OF BABEL !
NO EXODUS !
NO ISRAEL !
NO JEEBUS !
NO MOHAMMED !

Who says so? SCIENCE, THAT""S WHO !!!

Date of Creation, According to Hebrew Calendar, 5772 years ago.

Date of the Universe, According to Science, 13.75 Billion years.

The SOURCE for ALL of the Abrahamic Religions is wrong on the Date of Creation and EVERYTHING ELSE, cause it's just MYTHOLOGY !

The Abrahamic Religions are entirely, solely responsible for more Human Suffering than ALL of the world's religions combined.

No other group has been responsible for as much Bloodshed by the usage of Mythology purported to be Absolute Truth, than the Backward, Desert, Goat Fuckers that came up with the LIE, in order to Steal, Rape and Pillage, from others.

The Arab, Sand Nigger, Jews, behind the LIE that has been used to INFECT THE PSYCHE OF ALL HUMANITY, are the World's Most Prodigious Desert, Cut-Throats.

It has always been, ""WORSHIP OR DIE"", with these Scumbags.

Knowledge awaits you in a short few keystrokes entered into your favorite Search Engine.

for example try this:
""No geological evidence Noah's Flood ever happened""

and you will find something like this, WHICH I CHALLENGE YOU TO ANSWER, ALL THE LOGICAL, RATIONAL QUESTIONS, POSED THEREIN
--------------------------------------------------------
Logistical Problems
Fitting the Animals Aboard. An ark of the size specified in the Bible would not be large enough to carry a cargo of animals and food sufficient to repopulate the earth, especially if animals that are now extinct were required to be aboard.

Special diets. How did Noah determine and provide for all those special diets?

Fresh foods. Many animals require their food to be fresh. How did Noah keep all these food supplies fresh?

Sanitation. How did such a small crew dispose of so much waste?

Exercise/Animal handling. How were several thousand diverse kinds of animals exercised regularly?

The Water Problem
Where did that much water come from? Where did it go? Whilst one could appeal to miracles (God can do anything, after all) the Genesis story itself presents the flood as the result of God acting through natural processes â€“ the bursting of the fountains of the deep and the opening of the floodgates of the sky.

Lack of Evidence for a Global Flood Where we Would Expect it.
A global flood would have produce evidence contrary to the evidence we see.

Why is there no evidence of a flood in ice core series? Ice cores from Greenland have been dated back more than 40,000 years by counting annual layers. Why doesn't evidence for the flood show up?

Why did the Flood not leave traces on the sea floors? A year long flood should be recognizable in sea bottom cores. Why do none of these show up?

Why is there no evidence of a flood in tree ring dating? Tree ring records go back more than 10,000 years, with no evidence of a catastrophe during that time.

How are the polar ice caps even possible? Such a mass of water as the Flood would have provided sufficient buoyancy to float the polar caps off their beds and break them up. They wouldn't regrow quickly.

Evidence supports the uninterrupted human occupation of the Americas (over 12,000 years) and Australasia (about 30,000-40,000 years) from long before the time that the flood could have happened.

Survival Problems
How did all the modern plant species survive?
- Many plants (seeds and all) would be killed by being submerged for a few months. This is especially true if they were soaked in salt water.
- Most seeds would have been buried under many feet (even miles) of sediment. This is deep enough to prevent spouting.

How did all the fish survive? Some require cool clear water, some need brackish water, some need ocean water, some need water even saltier. A flood would have destroyed at least some of the"
,666Gott,2012-01-17T16:07Z,"...some of these habitats.

How did short-lived species survive? Adult mayflies on the ark would have died in a few days, and the larvae of many mayflies require shallow fresh running water. Many other insects would face similar problems.

How could more than a handful of species survive in a devastated habitat? The Flood would have destroyed the food and shelter which most species need to survive. (As an aside it is interesting that after the flood we see that the topsoil has not been washed away and that vegetations still grows. This would suggest that the flood was not as severe as the story depicts it).

How did predators survive? How could more than a handful of the predator species on the ark have survived, with only two individuals of their prey to eat? 

How did animals get to their present ranges? How did koalas get from Ararat to Australia, polar bears to the Arctic, etc., when the kinds of environment they require to live does not exist between the two points. How did so many unique species get to remote islands?

Why are so many animals found only in limited ranges? Why are so many marsupials limited to Australia; why are there no wallabies in western Indonesia? Why are lemurs limited to Madagascar?

Evidence that Fossil-Bearing Rock Strata Were Not Laid Down in a Single Event
Most people who believe in a global flood also believe that the flood was responsible for creating all fossil-bearing strata. However, there is a great deal of contrary evidence.

How was the fossil record sorted in an order convenient for evolution if they were laid down in the turmoil of a single flood?

How do surface features appear far from the surface? Deep in the geologic column there are formations which could have originated only on the surface, such as: Rain drops, river channels, wind-blown dunes, beaches, in-place trees, soil and footprints.

How could a flood deposit layered fossil forests? Stratigraphic sections showing a dozen or more mature forests layered atop each other (all with upright trunks, in-place roots, and well-developed soil) appear in many locations. How could these have appeared in the midst of a catastrophic flood? They are evidence of a slow deposition in environmentally sensitive conditions incompatible with a catastrophic deluge.

How were mountains and valleys formed? Many very tall mountains are composed of sedimentary rocks. If these were formed during the Flood, how did they reach their present height, and when were the valleys between them eroded away? Keep in mind that many valleys were clearly carved by glacial erosion, which is a slow process.

Historical Problems
How did the human population rebound so fast? Genealogies in Genesis put the Tower of Babel about 110 to 150 years after the Flood (Gen 10:25; 11:10-19). How did the world population regrow so fast to make its construction (and the city around it) possible? Similarly, there would have been very few people around to build Stonehenge and the Pyramids, rebuild the Sumerian and Indus Valley civilizations, populate the Americas, etc.

You won't because a LIE CAN NEVER BE PROVEN !

All I have to say, is it is way easier to believe in God, than to believe that some sort of big bang occurred and it just so happened that we wound up the perfect distance from the Sun that we didn't burn up or freeze to death and somehow which you can't explain, that life just suddenly occurred.  hahahhaahhahaha now that is a laugh and a quite depressing way to believe.  You are thinking about things way too deep...which is why you don't understand the miracles of the Lord.  You do not have the brains to understand and neither do I which is why it is called a miracle. You can't explain it. That is what a miracle is.  And they happen daily so explain that?  lol May God Bless You."

,Eliaza,2012-02-16T05:04Z,"@666got

The Ark measured 300x50x30 cubits (Genesis 6:15), which is about 140x23x13.5 metres or 459x75x44 feet, so its volume was 43,500 m3 (cubic metres) or 1.54 million cubic feet. To put this in perspective, this is the equivalent volume of 522 standard American railroad stock cars, each of which can hold 240 sheep.

If the animals were kept in cages with an average size of 50x50x30 centimetres (20x20x12 inches), that is 75,000 cm3 (cubic centimetres) or 4800 cubic inches, the 16,000 animals would only occupy 1200 m3 (42,000 cubic feet) or 14.4 stock cars. Even if a million insect species had to be on board, it would not be a problem, because they require little space. If each pair was kept in cages of 10 cm (four inches) per side, or 1000 cm3, all the insect species would occupy a total volume of only 1000 m3, or another 12 cars. This would leave room for five trains of 99 cars each for food, Noahâ€™s family and â€˜rangeâ€™ for the animals. However, insects are not included in the meaning of behemah or remes in Genesis 6:19-20, so Noah probably would not have taken them on board as passengers anyway.

Tabulating the total volume is fair enough, since this shows that there would be plenty of room on the Ark for the animals with plenty left over for food, range etc. It would be possible to stack cages, with food on top or nearby (to minimize the amount of food carrying the humans had to do), to fill up more of the Ark space, while still allowing plenty of room for gaps for air circulation. We are discussing an emergency situation, not necessarily luxury accommodation. Although there is plenty of room for exercise, skeptics have overstated animalsâ€™ needs for exercise anyway.

Even if we donâ€™t allow stacking one cage on top of another to save floor space, there would be no problem. Woodmorappe shows from standard recommended floor space requirements for animals that all of them together would have needed less than half the available floor space of the Arkâ€™s three decks. This arrangement allows for the maximum amount of food and water storage on top of the cages close to the animals.

Food requirements
The Ark would probably have carried compressed and dried foodstuffs, and probably a lot of concentrated food. Perhaps Noah fed the cattle mainly on grain, plus some hay for fibre. Woodmorappe calculated that the volume of foodstuffs would have been only about 15 % of the Arkâ€™s total volume. Drinking water would only have taken up 9.4% of the volume. This volume would be reduced further if rainwater was collected and piped into troughs.

Excretory requirements
It is doubtful whether the humans had to clean the cages every morning. Possibly they had sloped floors or slatted cages, where the manure could fall away from the animals and be flushed away (plenty of water around!) or destroyed by vermicomposting (composting by worms) which would also provide earthworms as a food source. Very deep bedding can sometimes last for a year without needing a change. Absorbent material (e.g. sawdust, softwood wood shavings and especially peat moss) would reduce the moisture content and hence the odour.

Hibernation
The space, feeding and excretory requirements were adequate even if the animals had normal day/night sleeping cycles. But hibernation is a possibility which would reduce these requirements even more. It is true that the Bible does not mention it, but it does not rule it out either. Some creationists suggest that God created the hibernation instinct for the animals on the Ark, but we should not be dogmatic either way.

Some skeptics argue that food taken on board rules out hibernation, but this is not so. Hibernating animals do not sleep all winter, despite popular portrayals, so they would still need food occasionally.
