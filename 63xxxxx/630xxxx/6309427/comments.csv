,JoranKetelaars,2011-04-12T00:54Z,"it's real, but it leaked!"
,anigetthatgun,2011-04-12T05:26Z,"if you pre-ordered, the album came today, I just got mine  and was gunna upload if it wasn't here!"
,bizzle420,2011-04-12T21:43Z,its real for sure!!!
,bizzle420,2011-04-12T21:50Z,the only thing bad bout this is that the track info is a lil messed up in itunes ... so it doesnt play the tracks in order but they are numbered right ... 
,coltron0,2011-04-14T02:14Z,"I upped it myself the day after it shipped, I preordered. And if there's a problem in itunes, either you're crazy or it's itunes' fault. Wait, why are you listening to music in itunes? What are you, software-impaired?"
,bizzle420,2011-04-16T17:19Z,"I GOT it strightened out...... software impared i dunno maybe .... what would u suggest i use? and i use i tunes cuz i keep my library up to date  on my i pod, but i am open to suggestion to a new media player."
,bizzle420,2011-04-16T17:20Z,damm typos hahahaha
,pvtpain,2011-04-19T10:38Z,"I believe WinAmp now tracks & updates your music library. I use iTunes too, and would also like suggestions on another player..."
,coltron0,2011-04-24T20:59Z,I love winamp. A perfect player would be a winamp that automatically updates its library. Best I've found though. 
,Wetbeard,2011-05-12T22:48Z,"Another great tool when using an ipod is Sharepod. It does everything and It lets you copy music from your ipod to your computer just like most non-Mac mp3 players. the people who run Mac are jerks, you are just money to them.

Thanks for this though"
,coltron0,2011-07-13T21:47Z,"Oh I'm sorry poppy20, if I'd remembered that %5 of people wanted four times the file size for the same quality as detected by human ears, I would have given it to them."
