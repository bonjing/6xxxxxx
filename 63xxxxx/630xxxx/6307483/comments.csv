,princezita,2011-06-12T11:08Z,"Works great, thanks a lot! I'm just wondering though why it doesn't use up the whole screen even when I play it in full screen mode; there are still black spaces on both sides. Hmm, oh well, it still works. Thanks again!"
[V],HobbitTunez,2011-06-16T06:35Z,"@Jobin2all

Yes, this is the GOTY edition, if that's what you meant.

@princezita

I don't think this popcap game was designed for any widescreen resolutions (i.e. 1366x768), but depending on your graphics card drivers you may be able to warp the scaling."
