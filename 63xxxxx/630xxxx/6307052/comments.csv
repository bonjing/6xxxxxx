,Krisiun,2011-04-16T08:55Z,"awesome, works fine, ty!"
,shadowfoxx,2011-04-17T19:20Z,Are there separate torrents available for both the 32 bit and 64 bit? I only need the 32 =P
,shadowfoxx,2011-04-19T22:20Z,I'm having trouble with the keygen on both this and Maya. When I'm on the licensing page and attempt to use the keygen patch it tells me I must be on the licensing page... But as I said I'm already there. Did I miss a step?
,shadowfoxx,2011-04-21T02:32Z,I did indeed miss a step. I forgot to turn off UAC! Successfully installed now. Thanks a lot! 
,sbiscuit,2011-05-10T00:28Z,"Thanks so much! 

Installs and loads up fine for me but I'm getting this PHYSX>CPU logo in every viewport and in the welcome screen and all over the place...I have a supported nvidia card. Anyone else have this issue?"

,DarkAng3L,2011-05-17T11:49Z,"I am having the same problem shadowfoxx did, but i think I turned User Account Control way down and it should be off, what else can be the problem ?!"
,DarkAng3L,2011-05-21T01:56Z,"Can anybody help me with the crack ??

I followed all the steps in install.txt and I am stuck at 8..

UAC is off and I have DX 11 and ,net framework 4 up to date

I use xf-adesk2012x64 and click Mem Patch at the activation screen after I select ""I have an activation code from Autodesk"" and it says ""You can only apply patch when licensing screen appears"" and i've tryed everything..."
,TheGranger,2011-05-28T02:17Z,"It works, ty."
,Tram8yn,2011-06-09T06:00Z,"Hey chris. I'm getting the a registration-activation error (0015.111). ""there is a problem with the activation code you entered. Click one of the following links.""  Do you think the lethal is ^no longer working. I have dl the other torrents you posted and they worked fine. I did exactly what you said but this one is the latest one I downloaded and I ran into this problem. Any help would be appreciated. "
,Tram8yn,2011-06-09T06:01Z,^keygen I meant. 
,Tram8yn,2011-06-09T06:08Z,Used a ^keygen from your other torrents and it works flawlessly. Thanks man. 
,lukaslw,2011-06-14T01:00Z,"If you have already failed in first attempt and u get error 20, even after reinstall:
1. Run services.msc
2. Turn on the FLEXnet licensing service if disabled and set it as auto.
3. Delete the C:\ProgramData\FLEXnet folder.
4. Disable UAC before next installation: http://www.mydigitallife.info/how-to-disable-and-turn-off-uac-in-windows-7
5. Reinstall.
6. Acitvate, but remember to run XFORCE Keygen in good version as an administrator."
,wastedblud,2011-06-23T00:20Z,"hi everyone, can you guys help seed please, really need this program!"
,yesterdays_pirate,2011-06-26T06:18Z,"Works like a charm. I had a bit of a confusion at first with the keygen but that was my fault. The confusion seems that the code produce by the keygen doesn't fill up all the required boxes in the activation screen. I was getting the error (0015.111) In reality, I was getting the error not because the code was insufficient but because I actually typed some wrong entry in the code. So, again, don't worry if the code produce by the keygen doesn't fill up the code entries in the activation screen. It works. Thanks uploader."
,NotGiven691,2011-07-03T06:15Z,"For those having issues with the activation screen being blank and/or getting script errors, this is the fix from AutoDesk:
----------
The directory for the white box (the activation screen) is
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Autodesk Shared\AdLM\R1\en-US\Webdepot
...where the registry HTMLs are stored. These are the pages that the blank screen shows on.
Open the RTBeginReg.html in a text editor like notepad. Add the following line of code below the  line.

This marks the page as SAFE. Save and you should be able to enter your code and stuff.
-----------
Note, you must do that to *all* of the .html files marked ""RT"". That's the only way I got it to work."
,NotGiven691,2011-07-03T06:17Z,"Err, the code is:
*!-- saved from url=(0016)http://localhost --^

Replace the * with < and ^ with >.
