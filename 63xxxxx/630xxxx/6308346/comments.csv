Windows Users: Extract with 7-Zip, convert resulting .hfs file to ISO with MagicISO. Real good quality."
,bamahut79,2011-04-26T01:58Z,"Thanks for the upload billoncho! I am getting an error when converting the .hsf file to ISO with MagicISO. What I get is: DVD Video error: ""Either VIDEO_TS.IFO or VTS_xx0.IFO is an invalid IFO!"" I DL another of your Insanity vids and had no issue converting. Any ideas? THANKS AGAIN billoncho!"
,ScubaGolfJim,2011-04-27T03:51Z,"bamahut79... I'm getting the same error. Posted the ""instructions"" after solving the access before attempting this one. After trying multiple ways, it appears the VIDEO_TS.IFO is the corrupted one. Now downloading the 1-RAR File version. Maybe after a week I'll have it all.

billancho... Many Thanks for seeding the sessions individually!!!"
,jasetheface100,2011-06-11T14:39Z,@ billoncho how do you follow any of this workout  when the sections are all over the place...? 
,Cav3223,2011-06-14T19:04Z,"hey, so i tried to convert to iso with magiciso. but i get a msg saying that the file is too big and that i have to buy magiciso how do i resolve this?"
,Cav3223,2011-06-14T19:08Z,oohh nvm i just extracted with 7-zip and used vlc to watch the videos
,kriegerd,2011-06-22T20:33Z,"Is this the same file as the one that appears as a big 33Gb rar file?? 

I downloaded the big one and this disc is all out of wack, the sections jump from one place to another.

Can anyone tell me if this file is correct??

@jasetheface100 I noticed you complain about this, were you able to find this disc somewhere else? 

Thanx for the help!"
