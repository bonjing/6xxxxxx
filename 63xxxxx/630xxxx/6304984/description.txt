C4E iXtreme Slim LT+ Firmware for LiteOn DG-16D4S 9504

>> C4Eva (in association with Team Jungle & Team Xecuter) released the iXtreme LT+ for LiteOn DG-16D4S 9504 drives:

World first backups for XBOX 360 Slim
- For Liteon Drive 9504

New protection measures for slim:
* Realtime checks of drive firmware and ram by dashboard - Rootkit technology used to pass several realtime check types. These checks on the drive are open ended so as to make replay of the answers impossible. Will pass any check on any part of the drive
* Hardware flash modification check - The 1335 chip performs a hardware check on powerup for modified firmware. Chip fooled into thinking firmware is stock
* Slim drive locked to read pressed game discs only - Enabled reading of DVD+R DL media for game discs

All features of current LT+ also included
- Optimised PFI code to accomodate AP25 SS data
- Defeats current AP25 protection
- Protects console from logging AP25 violation 
- Full disc stealth used by default
- Waveless booting , disc images are assumed to be correct!
- Split-Vid used as default

If booting an AP25 title without AP25 SS game will not boot but will still be protected from logging AP25 violation on current dash 12625
If LT+ encounters an unknown AP25 challenge, game will not boot but console will still be protected from logging AP25 violation on current dash 12625

AP25 SS are region specific for region locked games
