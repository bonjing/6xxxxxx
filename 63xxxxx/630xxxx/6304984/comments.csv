,dancapitan77,2011-04-08T21:29Z,useless!! dashboard update 2.0.13141.0  will bring support only with 3 layer dvds so no more backups!
[T],Sunblock.,2011-04-08T22:06Z,Same was sade about ap25.
,daperdon,2011-04-08T22:27Z,@Sunblock so whats the deal no more backups with the new dash update when dose it come out or will we have to play backups from an external hd or what
,Strikefear13,2011-04-08T23:09Z,"I was wondering something.  I know it's a bitch to initially flash Lite-On firmware (last gen arcade units, non-slim) but I had mine done with all the right equipment and I have a backup of all the necessary information he pulled from it when he updated it.  Newest it supports though is wave 4.  I'd rather not have to hunt this kid down to update it, so I was wondering if updating was easier if I've already got the information he backed up.  Is there a tutorial somewhere for just UPDATING a previously flashed lite-on?"

Thats not true at all. Microsoft cant just stop supporting all the Dual layer games people have already purchased."

,SpitvenoM,2011-04-09T17:14Z,there not making 3 layer dvds they are changing a partition on the disc to give it around 1gb more room for games.
,daperdon,2011-04-09T19:14Z,its all cool but once that new dash update comes out backups are coming to a end i have over 300 gms and they will be worth nothing DAMM
,Strikefear13,2011-04-10T19:07Z,"Not true daperdon. They JUST said the new update will have no affect on the old discs.  And you can always wait to update until a firmware is released for it so the old AND new discs work.  Anybody who knows anything about modding knows to wait to update until it's safe to (a new firmware is released).  Shouldn't be taking a modded 360 online anyway, so updates should never be a concern."
