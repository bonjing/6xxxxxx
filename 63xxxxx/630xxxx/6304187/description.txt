* Fixed Guide Losing Transparency Setting After Combat
* Fixed Freeze Arrow Option (and renamed to "Non-interactive" in Waypoints options for clarity)

* Added New Player Position Arrow to Minimap - A cosmetic difference from the default one, just a tiny tweak so that the arrow rotates on its gem pivot, not on its own center and swiveling the pivot around. Will option this later, just in case you prefer the default player arrow functionality.
