They firmly believe what they say and it is clear that the bible says that homosexuality is a damnation, so they follow that, although many might disagree. I'd like to suggest to them in order to convey their message more effectively to make a short film showing god (jesus) coming down to earth in the midst of great destruction and fire of the unbelievers and them and their families being slowly raised to an eternity of bliss for being true believers, but at the same time while being so elevated, looking down with some degree of pity and concern for all those suffering souls below, showing thus that they are not indifferent to human feelings. If they showed that video in their demonstrations on a big screen, then people would at least understand why they do what they do. Finally, having seen what pretty young girls they have as members without marriageable young male prospects around, I hope some young guys join their group so they can have husbands they can marry."
