,anahka23,2011-04-10T10:51Z,"Useless like this. Need description, previews and no rar-bullshit. "
,darknessv,2011-04-10T11:56Z,"its easier for the computer to handle one big file,then thousands of smaller files. just saysing.

but yeah,its a very very very big file,too big for me unfortunately"
,bart001fr,2011-04-12T19:15Z,"This big a collection should have been posted in several parts of about 1GB apiece.

Each part should have been individual sets, each within its own folder.

As for either zipping or raring pictures, there is absolutely NO saving on space. So the guys above me who say it makes no sense are totally right. Read smallfoot's post to better understand why rar's are an abomination on a big post. The only place they make sense is in newsgroups where they force you to use 'par' to prevent useless downloads.

Please redo this, in smaller bites we can swallow. NO raring this time. And DO NOT forget the previews!
