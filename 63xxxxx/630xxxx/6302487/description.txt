Video and Audio    LKRG .............. Thanks 

This is LKRGs NFO mines same deal so heres what you need know 

On to audio what a nightmare it's safe to say this is real old school cam audio with your own personal douche as a commentator it was so annoying that i had to take

90% of all non vocal parts from russian audio and mux to our video way to much work done on it so in the beginning during credits i used russian audio and then on occasion through out for a

second or 2 you will hear russian vocals but is only peoples names so you are not missing out on anything all in all audio turned out watchable.

Basically all ive done is added a few filters and not alot more .A samples included so check it out first ..Definetly a crop issue with this one,i might not have done this normally but man ive been bored .......ENJOY
