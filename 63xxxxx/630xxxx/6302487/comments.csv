,Feetback,2011-04-08T07:52Z,"A 5/V 7 - Happy. Thank you! ""SAFCukO09"" keep eem coming! more please:)"
,Twizted1,2011-04-09T05:41Z,"Yeah.. where is the ending at ?

A = 8
V = 5 (too dark in, well most of the movie since it 
takes place in a house and at night)

M = If I could have ""seen"" most of it, I would rate
this horror as a 8.5"

Video: 4
Movie: 7?

As others have commented already, there are many dark parts where you cannot really see anything which kind of ruined the movie.  
The audio is pretty bad as well, but you can hear what they are talking about if you pay attention.  Does sound drowned out plus you can hear the audience laugh/talk/comment from time to time.
THE ENDING IS MISSING!!!  I won't say what is supposed to happen, just that this one cuts of the last 5 or so minutes.  If you are in a hurry to watch it, go ahead and download - if not, wait for a better quality one which has the whole movie.  Thanks SAFCukO09 though for the upload."
,martincorleone66,2011-04-11T19:26Z,"same copy as all the rest, i saw this in movie theatre, its missing the very end which is the best part, dont waste your time, yeah the movies decent, but its missing the end, so its worthless. its like getting all excited to meet that super model online and when she shows up, shes really 5""2 and 180 lbs... theyll say.. ""your getting it for free dont complain"" this is the excuse by all the uploaders putting garbage, same video uploaded by 10 different  people, makes sense to me?????"
