Plot -
Roll out the red carpet for Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private as they waddle to the world premiere of their first, feature-length DVD â€“ with never before seen missions! You may think theyâ€™re just a cute pack of penguins, but these flightless birds are actually an elite strike force with unmatched commando skills. And, if they want to maintain order in the zoo, theyâ€™ll have to outwit resident party animal King Julien! Roger that, Boys!
