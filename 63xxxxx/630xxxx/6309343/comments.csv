,gouldie78,2011-04-13T21:48Z,"c'mon people. 
I've seeded to a good few of you now, still no comments. 
Whats going on? 
I want to know if I did it right.
Whats the outcome? "
,Actromophile,2011-04-14T21:24Z,"Well all is good except the subs. It says ""eng subs"" but there are none..
I have not found any that fits and i'm not sure about how you change a sub for another release to fit it. So it would be cool if you could upload subtitles for this. Otherwise I'll have to read up on how to make another sub fit.
Thanks anyway!"
,gouldie78,2011-04-16T14:22Z,"Hi actromophile

I have now uploaded the srt file and explained the easiest way to insert the subs. 

Alternatively if you don't have a divx player you can convert with convertxtodvd

Regards"
,MacTee,2011-04-29T20:33Z,Good upload gouldie thanks.  Also i uploaded the sub file to an online server: http://subscene.com/english/FlashpointDouFoSin2007DVDRipHCEngSubssrt/subtitle-433173.aspx  should be more reliable and dont have to seed the sub torrent anymore
