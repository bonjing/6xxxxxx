Vintage Guitar Magazine's Eric Shoaf writes about the Stevie Ray Vaughan Tribute "Lenny":
 
This collection of aural soundscapes, titled simply Lenny, is a tribute to the memory of Stevie Ray Vaughan and a celebration of his accomplishments and influence on a generation of guitar players. 

Within these musical portraits, talented guitar players interpret Stevie's music and capture in instrumental form the caliber of his brilliance as well as the fundamental essence of his music. 

Think of these sound paintings as individual tributes, each as unique as Stevie, each a true original while praising his influence, each a memorial to a musician who died too young. 

As I listen, I am transported back to that day in 1983 when I stood in awe of that man's talent, moved by his deep feeling for the music he played.
