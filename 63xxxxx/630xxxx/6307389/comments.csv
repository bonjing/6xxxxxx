,Malum95,2012-02-24T10:43Z,"warning! Not sure if it's just me, but there is some kind of corruption, causing windows explorer to crash any time you open a folder with this file in it.(torrents download directory)
simple fix: delete download directory.
if you want to salvage anything in your folder: go in safemode, and delete all the movies seperatly, go back to normal, delete torrents directory(with this file in it) and drag and drop other movies from bin to your desired location.
Trying to delete godzilla in safemode for some reason would not work, but it does in regular mode."
