Summary:
A montage of French nuclear tests in the Pacific Ocean, observed by many 
marine iguanas. Then, in present days, a Japanese fishing ship is being 
attacked by an unseen monster; only one survived. Traumatized, he is later 
questioned in a hospital by a mysterious Frenchman and repeatedly says 
only one word --"Gojira". NRC scientist Niko "Nick" Tatopolous is called 
in to investigate the matter, and he quickly arrives at the conclusion 
that a giant, irradiated lizard known as Godzilla has been created by 
the explosions. Then Godzilla makes its way north, landing at Manhattan 
to begin wreaking havoc in the big city! Even with the combined forces 
of the U.S. military are going to destroy Godzilla at all costs, but 
will it ever be enough to save the people of New York?
