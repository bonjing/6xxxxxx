modded 1960\'s GP cars

Included are both version exe files

rd31.0.exe---- which is the NODVD crack and known as version 1.0

rd31.1.exe----which has bugs fixed, BUT you will need a genuine copy of disk for it to work, known as version 1.1


Summary

extract and replace file racedriver3, in your game dir
make short cuts to dsk top of both rd31.0.exe and rd31.1.exe files

You will now be able to join both versions, you will notice that there will be compltlely different sessions available/host


PS version 1.0 is usually full of rammers/hacks 
   version 1.1 , seems to have a majority of fair and therefore the drivers are a lot quicker ie: almost no one rams


cheers
