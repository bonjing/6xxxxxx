Cumberland Gap Connection
A Whole Lotta Lonesome (2011)


Cumberland Gap Connection is a highly energetic bluegrass band with a sound all their own. This 4-piece group is comprised of musicians from Kentucky and Tennessee. Cumberland Gap Connection strives to take their driving style of bluegrass to the next level with aggressive instrumentation mixed with a distinctive vocal harmony style. CGC has just completed their fourth project A Whole Lotta Lonesome which is scheduled for release in early 2011, and has been dubbed already, by those who have had a sneak peek, as the best music from the band to date.
