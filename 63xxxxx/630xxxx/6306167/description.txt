The past seventeen years have seen revolutionary changes in how we communicate information.
Virtuallyall journals are available electronically. Preprints xvi Preface:  What This Book 
Is About can be published on the Internet before or without ever being refereed.  Overhead 
projectors have disappeared from scientific meetings in favor of LCD projectors and laptop 
computers. RÃ©sumÃ©s are often distributed electronically. This update of A PhD Is Not Enough!
comes abreast of these changes, though the basic content of the  original remains timely.
The communications revolution cannot be ignored but has not made it less important to be 
thoughtful about choosing your career path or to respect audiences and readers.   I still 
attend talks that make me squirm and struggle to read sleep-inducing scientific articles.
 I hope attentive readers of this book will reap the rewards of doing better.
