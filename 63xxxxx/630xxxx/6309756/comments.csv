,rigmar_radio,2011-04-11T16:31Z,Why RAR these files.  What video format are they in...  If they are MP4 then forget it.
,Bloody-Money,2011-04-11T16:56Z,"Video format is MP4,but I do not see why this is a problem. Please tell me,this is my first upload, Im new to this."
,cbird911,2011-04-30T01:40Z,"Blooody-Money, The challenge with posting in an mp4 format is sometimes iTunes will play the viode but then not allow it to be uploaded to external devices like the iPad or iPod. It will often say that either it 'cannot be played' on the device or that one is 'not authorized.' I have found that it is better to upload in avi, mpg or just about any other format and let the individual convert to the format of their preference. "
