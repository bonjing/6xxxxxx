,ViccyQ,2011-04-11T23:28Z,Hell Yes. I will seed this bad boy. Lets hope it turns out good.
,ktberr,2011-04-12T03:53Z,Please Please Please seed! Stuck on 29% it's killing meeeeeeeeeeee.
,ViccyQ,2011-04-13T01:06Z,Aww Come one guys. I'm at  60%. Think about it. If I finish before you then I can seed at 1.5 mbs for you all.
,ViccyQ,2011-04-14T03:07Z,Download done in 20 mins. Will be uploading at FULL upload capabilities.
,ViccyQ,2011-04-14T03:55Z,"2 Seeder (including me) and 136 LEACHERS....

Come one guys stop being greedy and seed higher. Stop restricting your upload. The more output the fast we can all get it."
,Tarson,2011-04-14T04:55Z,"I reached 100% about 30 minutes ago...  since then, I have not been able to watch more than 3 minutes of the movie before the video begins to randomly freeze/stall.

Now, this problem may simply be on my end and not the fault of the video...  What I was able to watch was in full, crisp, and clear 1080 with superb audio and a slew of working subtitles.

If anyone has a recommendation to fix what might be an error on my part, it would be greatly appreciated.  I already have VLC Player and the K-lite codec pack."
,ViccyQ,2011-04-14T06:07Z,"@Tarson Hey im gonna start the film and see if I run into the same prob. Ill get back to you. In the mean time just see if your computer is under load in any way. I know on my system at least when multiple things are running, VLC gets very edgy and has to buffer at points which pauses then resumes the video."

,Marco1975,2011-05-18T12:14Z,"If  I try to switch to different audio or different subtitle the movie freezes, I tried playing it on a pch. 

Anybody suggestions how to solve?"
,joshua1964,2011-06-05T11:40Z,"This is 1080p,that to big for your pc ,sorry."
