
Tiny Toons - Spring Break Special

100% Full copy, better version than what is currently available online (The one that features a prominent static meltdown and a tornado warning)

Only aired once in 1994, then thrown away into the deep, dark, bottomless vaults of WB's Archives. A rare find, a clear version of this.
