         A sea monster cemetery lies at the top of the world. It's     
         an incredible grave site that contains countless,             
         fossilized remains of huge marine predators from the          
         Jurassic Era. Join an expedition to this remote burial        
         ground via helicopter and boat. Paleontologists will          
         contend with powerful polar bears and erratic Arctic          
         weather to uncover an incredible treasure trove that          
         contains all new species of predatory sea monsters. This      
         time, one is a complete ichthyosaur skeleton -- the first     
          of its kind to be discovered.
