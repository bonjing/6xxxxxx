,Daize,2011-04-10T02:55Z,"@cichu, I had the same black screen problem. Got it working by going into Xenus 2\INI\VideoOptions.ini and changing the game to windowed mode by changing the Windowed mode setting into Windowed mode=1. I could the change the fullscreen resolution in the ingame options. Worked fine after that, hope it works for you too."
