S04E22 or S04E24 or heck why not S05E01...?
Some could even call this S04E21 because of the 3 specials within the season.
This season has been hellacious to keep accurate record of where it's at.
Travel Channel says it's still season 3.
Wikipedia once claimed it was already mid-season 5.
Last week Wiki changed their listing to this being the start of season 5.
Wiki changed their mind again and tossed it back into the season 4 line-up.
Confusing.
Some people were whining about me posting this episode as S05E01.
Happy now? Jeez.
How about this... just enjoy the show, okay?
Okay.

Best viewed in MPC or VLC.

Even better with PS3 or X360.
