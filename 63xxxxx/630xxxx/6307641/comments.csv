And it is hard to know what number or season we are on. As you said, there was episodes like Scariest moments that are probably not counted as ""normal"" episodes. I would just keep it as season 4 for now to stop the little kids crying. When there is another break in new episodes I am guessing they will officially shut the door on season 4

Don't let these small insignificant details put you off , you are doing a fantastic job, better than anyone else is doing."
,Nickyboy7,2011-04-10T13:16Z,"looking at wiki it says there is one more episode to come for season 4

23 Sacramento Tunnels

so hopefully after that we will not have this confusion. It should be season 5 after the summer break."

I get griped at for posting it as S05E01 and then when I re-post it as S04E22 another bunch of nimrods on other sites gripe again saying it should be S05.  By rule of majority, it's apparently still season 4.  I think.

Grrrr!  Amen to the next episode being the final final final episode of the season.

Heck, if you go by the trend of number of episodes in the first 3 seasons, this upcoming episode would be the end of season 5.

Frankly, I don't think Zak, Nick, or Aaron themselves know the official number of which season/episode is being aired of their own show."

Second of all, i'm pretty sure that this is the first episode of Season 5, i'm a member of their fansite on Facebook, and they wrote on the day for this episode ""Are you all ready for the season premiere tonight"" therefore i'm pretty sure that this is indeed season 5, but thanks for the upload, it was a really nice episode, and everyone should see it, no matter if it is or isn't  season 5"
