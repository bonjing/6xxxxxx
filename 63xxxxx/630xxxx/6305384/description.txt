                The Date.
                A new six-part comedy written and produced by Robert
                Popper, starring Tamsin Greig, Paul Ritter, Simon
                Bird and comedy newcomer Tom Rosenthal, plus special
                guest star Mark Heap. Friday Night Dinner is a truly
                original series about the Goodmans, a family who have
                made an art form of their eccentricities. In this
                final episode, Adam comes home to find the house
                looking immaculate, with classical music playing in
                the living room, Mum's posh bowls on the dinner
                table, Dad in a smart suit, and most mysteriously -
                the table is set for five. The doorbell rings and in
                comes Tanya Green, a girl Mum has been trying to fix
                up with Adam for months. What follows is possibly the
                most excruciating family dinner scene of all time.
                Meanwhile, Jim has been locked out as his dog, Wilson
                has swallowed his keys. And so the blind date
                continues, but will Mum's dream of an Adam and Tanya
                wedding come true?
