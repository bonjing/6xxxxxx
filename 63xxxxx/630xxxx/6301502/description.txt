This is the ultimate audio collection that every Nirvana fan should own! Itâ€™s a tribute to my hero: Kurt Cobain and the amazing band Nirvana. This is the most complete collection out there and its a huge file so please seed for other fans. 

This is a collection of music that I have either downloaded from many sources around the internet or have ripped myself. I would like to give credit to the original posters of the content I downloaded but I donâ€™t have their names so Iâ€™m just gonna say thanks to all you Nirvana music uploaders out there for providing us entertainment. I have tried to assemble the highest quality audio for your listening pleasure.

 I wanted to release this on 4/5 to coincide with the anniversary Kurts death but the tagging, organizing and finding cover art took longer than expected. Almost all albums, bootlegs, EP\\\\\\\'s ect... have cover art. I put it into a neat package for all you Nirvana fans out there. Enjoy!
