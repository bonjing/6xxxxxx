,CBuck72391,2011-04-17T00:56Z,"Hey, thanks a ton man! I've been looking for the Entire Nirvana Collection, but all of the ones I've found were missing things like Outcesticide, With the Lights Out, etc. This is the first actual complete set I've come across. Thanks for providing a link to the Fecal Matter demo you forgot as well. My only complaint is that it's taking forever to download, anyway we can get some more seeders on this? Either way, awesome work man and thanks a ton!"
,Back2Ruin,2011-04-17T07:48Z,@CBuck72391 Sorry bout the slow download. I seed 24/7 on this torrent so please be patient. Its definitely worth the wait. Glad you like it :)
,CBuck72391,2011-04-17T09:09Z,"Yeah, it's no problem man, it's finished downloading and was definitely worth it. Thanks again."

,Back2Ruin,2011-06-07T00:18Z,I'm working on another massive Nirvana Torrent with even more Nirvana stuff including the rest of their singles. I'll post again here when it is up since the edit torrent button still isn't working
