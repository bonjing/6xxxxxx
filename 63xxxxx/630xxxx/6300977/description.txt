This is the RA2 soundtrack bundled into a .zip archive. 

Unlike the only other torrent on this site (which is in .RAR format), this will be seeded to completion. Also, the archive is complete. I have fixed all of the audio information, filled in all the appropriate audio info and fixed the disorganized naming.

Also, the final track, #16: C&C In The House, is working and is included in the archive. It is not a lame 18kb blank file like any other archive on the internet.

I know there are only about 9 ppl out there (including myself) who will download this, but for those of you who do, ENJOY!
