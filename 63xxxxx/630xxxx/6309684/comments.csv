I highly recommend not getting any version 4, at least until they change it back to where you can manually change how many MB you want the disc to be.  Version 4 compresses TOO MUCH and does it without user permission, and there is no way to change it unless you have version 3.  New versions are supposed to ADD features, not take them away."
[T],carter67,2011-04-11T05:50Z,"@user897 more importantly the new encoding Filters offer MUCH better quality and there are many other improvements over v3.x. 

This has to take president over the size of file as more people use this software to burn their files to DVD.
This is far superior to Version 3. These guys do not improve their software for nothing."
[T],carter67,2011-04-11T05:53Z,@user897 I see you don't upload anything.  upload your version and let folks chose for themselves
,User897,2011-04-11T07:04Z,"Sure they update it for a reason.  TO MAKE MONEY and keep users dependent on it!

I don't have to upload mine because I got it from this site.

I would rather more space be taken on the disc and have CONTROL over the size of the burn result, which version 4 DOES NOT allow."
[T],carter67,2011-04-11T18:13Z,"ha ha. excuses.

You say end off, I say FUCK OFF.

I'll give this a try, but I know it is going to be more of the same.  I'll see just to be sure."
