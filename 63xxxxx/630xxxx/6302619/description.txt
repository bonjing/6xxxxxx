All Or Nothing At All (1993)
â€œThey donâ€™t come much darker than you, do they?â€

All Or Nothing At All is a British made-for-television three-part miniseries starring the talented Hugh Laurie as con man and gambler Leo Hopkins. The film opens at a party at the gorgeous multi-million pound country home of Leo, his wife, Jane (Jessica Turner) and their three children. To Leoâ€™s acquaintances, he appears to have the perfect life: Leoâ€™s a happily married, successful financial analyst. Envied by his society friends, everyone wonders just how Leo â€œdoes it.â€ He seems to have the Midas touch.

The story gradually strips away the layers of lies surrounding Leoâ€™s life. A practiced con man, Leo cashes in on the greed of his friends and relatives, but since Leo is also addicted to gambling, itâ€™s just a matter of time before his life crumbles into ruin.

The film is rather well executed. Hugh Laurie is perfectly cast as Leo, and heâ€™s surrounded here by an equally excellent castâ€“including Bob Monkhouse as his boss, Giles. Leo is funny, unassuming and seems to be non-threatening (in contrast to some of his sleazier friends, Duncan, for example). Leo appears to be just eccentric enough to be a financial wizard, so when he promises his friends impossibly high returns on investments, theyâ€™re all too happy to believe it. Leo is particularly good at deceiving women, and we see the three main women he manipulatesâ€“his wife Jane, his long-suffering and far-too-devoted secretary Marion (Pippa Guard) and Diane (Sioban McCarthy)â€“a woman who places Leoâ€™s insane bets.

Itâ€™s the characters here that make the film so rich. Leo moves in a society thatâ€™s largely superficialâ€“a society in which markers of affluence are more important than how that affluence was achieved. And since a frank discussion of money making is considered bad form, Leo can acquire his friendsâ€™ money with few questions asked.

On the surface, Leo is a very likeable fellow, and heâ€™s so likeable that itâ€™s easy to see how he gets away with so much. On the other hand, some of his greed-bag friends are pushy and unpleasant. We tend to think of con men as greedy, mean spirited people, but Leo is portrayed as someone whoâ€™s largely oblivious to the damage he causes, and if he does stop to think about what he does, he marks his actions up to â€˜wanting people to like him.â€™ The acting is excellent, and the conclusion isnâ€™t easy to predictâ€“in spite of all the very obvious paths this story takes. At one point, the film hints that Leo has fabricated other parts of his life; in an early scene, he slips when recalling his university days, but the film, rather frustratingly, just hints at this and doesnâ€™t explore this aspect of Leoâ€™s life any further. If you like British television drama, then thereâ€™s an excellent chance that youâ€™ll enjoy this entertaining drama. Directed by Andrew Grieve.
