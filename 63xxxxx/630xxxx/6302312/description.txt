Welcome folks,

you might have noticed the ACE Client 3.0 launched today and we made some changes, fixes, updates and more.

The list of updates includes:

Content Manager 1.5a
ACE Diagnostics 3.0
More tweaks for the overall game
Keepalive Guard was removed
Includes latest patch from Riot
As this is a major version update of our client we're not able to provide a small or big update for existing versions. However, following patches and updates will be based on the ACE Client Version 3.0.

You can now download the ACE Client 3.0 from our blazingly awesome new download portal where we're going to add more and more stuff as new things, versions and patches are coming.

Keep it up guys and have fun playing.
