Windows Users: Extract with 7-Zip, convert resulting .hfs file to ISO with MagicISO. Real good quality."
,luism23,2011-04-30T03:51Z,Hey I did all that u mentioned but when i turned the .hfs to ISO and burned it onto a CD it didn't show the video. It just has it on there as a file. I don't understand how do I make it play the video?? Step by step lol Thanks
,Jayman193,2011-07-14T10:11Z,Hey Luism what you have to do is that after you get the ISO Image then you have to dowload a program called Img Burn and then you have to choose write image to disc and then you should be good!
