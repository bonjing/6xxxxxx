CLASSIC BRITISH HORROR (RESTORED - EXTENDED VERSION) 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050766/

Rightly regarded as a genuine high point in both British 
horror and British cinema, Night (or Curse) Of The Demon 
is that rarest of rare things - an actually scary horror 
film.

Forget the monster (it's as crap as everyone says it is). 
It doesn't matter. From the opening scenes - where a man 
is chased by something through a spooky dark wood - to the 
shock ending on the railway station, this film is a classic 
in every sense of the word.

The makers of tripe like The Sixth Sense could do worse 
than looking at this for chills - there's not a drop of 
blood to be seen, there's few shock-horror sudden leapings 
at the camera, just a sense of unease that permeates through 
everything - and all caused by a little slip of paper. 
Brilliant.

Watch in terror as our hero is pursued through a house by 
an unseen person, then attacked by a ghostly cat. Cower in 
fear as Foggie from Last Of The Summer Wine jumps to his 
death through a window. Cheer in bewilderment as our hero 
refuses to believe that the baddy has any special powers - 
despite being treated to his own personal hurricane on an 
otherwise balmy summer's day.

Then go and make a cup of tea or something in a bid to miss 
the vaguely comical monster. Shooting was too good for the 
bloke who decided that was what this otherwise brillo film 
needed.

You have been warned - watched in the right mood, Night Of 
The Demon could be the scariest film you've ever seen. But 
whatever way you look at it, it's a fantastic vindication of 
your love of old Brit horror.

And remember, once you've seen it, you can regail bored 
friends with tales of exactly where Kate "Mad As A Box Of 
Frogs" Bush sampled "It's in the trees... it's coming!" 
from.
