'What Now My Love'?

Again my thanks to the original seeder for the Beat Club series of DVD's which are on the net right now.   This track has been carefully lifted and the DJ intro edited out so you just get the video.   This is the original Single sound track and this TeleCine is showing a Film of Sony and Cher so you have here a film of a film of a live TV show eeek.  I hope you are taking notes of all this ;)

Not to worry there is still enough quality to see how Beautiful and stunning Cher was back then, though few knew she would go on to be the star she is now.
