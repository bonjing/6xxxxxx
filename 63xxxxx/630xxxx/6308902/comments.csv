I colleted the episodes from different sources on the internet and put them into one folder :)"
,williamballs,2011-09-04T08:03Z,"yeah i figured youd found them, and thanks for the share. i just hoped someone out there with a BD drive and a copy of the season 2 set would undertake the project. im building a chronological set of the series which i am transcoding to ps3 to one day seed.

cant wait for the awesome mkv's of the movies we're sure to see in a few weeks"
