Americans spend more than $11 billion a year on self-help productsâ€”everything from books to diet pills to career coaches to seminars. So whyâ€”with all this time, money, and energy being spentâ€”are so few people living the life they really want? Why are millions of smart, talented, motivated people still going through life with one foot on the brake?Here's the real Secret: You don't need any more how-to-succeed information to reach your full potential.The problem isn't lack of motivation or lack of information. The real problem is that most people focus on the "how-to" aspects of success taught by traditional self-help programs, without coming to terms with what productivity expert Noah St. John calls your "head trash"â€”the subconscious, emotional roadblocks that prevent people from acting on their real hopes, dreams, and ambitions
