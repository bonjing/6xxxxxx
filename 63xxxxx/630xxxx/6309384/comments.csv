,Shpoxenn,2011-04-22T05:52Z,"No luck with this one sorry. After mounting the .iso with Poweriso, install goes to a little bit past halfway and then asks to 'insert disc'.

Win 7 - 64 Bit."
,P0pe0nD0pe,2011-04-22T10:52Z,Con someone PLEASE walk me through the steps needed to download this????????
,crimson_king,2011-04-23T02:16Z,"@Shpoxenn:
Just extract the contents of the ISO-file to a folder and run setup from there."
,crimson_king,2011-04-23T02:24Z,"@P0pe0nD0pe:
You need a program like WinRAR to extract the ISO-file from all the RAR-files. Then mount the ISO in Daemon Tools."
,P0pe0nD0pe,2011-04-23T05:07Z,"@crimson king, just archive the folder or what? I didn't know that you could extract anything from a normal file. Is it supposed to be a normal file by default? Or did I screw something up while downloading? My biggest problem is trying to convert the folder into an iso. I suppose that I can try to archive it, snce that seems what I'm supposed to do. Am I right on this?"
,crimson_king,2011-04-23T21:13Z,"@P0pe0nD0pe:
Sorry dude, but what you write doesn't make much sense. :-)
First of all, what program did you use to download this? Downloading the .torrent file isn't enough. You need a program like Vuze (www.vuze.com) or some other BitTorrent client to download all the files from this torrent. Have you done that?
If you have, then you should have a folder containing a total of 62 files somewhere on your computer (somewhere in My Documents maybe?). The files in that folder are called 'nfo.nfo', 'rac2012.r00', 'rac2012.r01', 'rac2012.r02' etc, etc."
,P0pe0nD0pe,2011-04-25T02:46Z,"Sorry Crimson_King. It took me a while to figure out. What I did: Downloaded the Torrent, downloaded the files, went inside of that, and extracted the iso from ""rac2012.rar."" I think that's what I wasn't supposed to do, since I think that there's a key-gen that was supposed to come with it... But, I don't have it. Could one of you show or tell me how to patch, crack, or get  key-gen for this? The program is installed, Windows-Gamer Edition, 64-bit."
,crimson_king,2011-04-25T11:31Z,Do you still have the iso? The keygen is in a folder called 'Crack' inside the iso.
,P0pe0nD0pe,2011-04-25T12:20Z,"Yeah, I have the entire downloaded file, but I have to go into the folder ""AUTODESK.REVIT.ARCHITECTURE.V2012-ISO,"" select and open ""rac2012.rar,"" and then open and mount the ""rac2012_x64.iso"" iso image. Just by looking at that, and comparing it to how you did it, did I do something wrong? It feels like it."
,crimson_king,2011-04-25T15:32Z,"If you installed it and you have Revit running, then you must have done it right. :-)
Just mount the iso again, open Windows Explorer, and locate the Crack folder. Follow the instructions in 'install.txt' to activate."
,P0pe0nD0pe,2011-04-26T02:03Z,"Okay, I have everything figured out. Thanks a lot man. Is anyone else having trouble? I'm much more.. Bright than I once was."

,strider888,2011-04-27T02:01Z,"sir I'm installing this yesterday and then it stopped while installing. it's still running but there's no progress so what i did is open the task manager then end the process. after that I tried to reinstall it by deleting the files that's already been created but after i start the setup again it say's the design review 2012 is already installed which in fact I already deleted then i run the installer just to try it out then same thing happens.

u can also install this by just extracting the iso file into your hard drive using winrar and double click setup to start installation..no need to burn or mount..

you must make it sure that you uninstall it properly and that the files and keys are completely deleted before installing it again..try this link for uninstalling/installing again process for revit architecture 2012.. http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/ps/dl/item?siteID=123112&id=16828836&linkID=9243099 "

This file mount I to 'computer' and there I open it.
Then the installation starts: Then I have to choose 2 options of license tpe: stand alone and network, what's the right??
Then I fill in the serial and product key, no problem. Then I select the three auto desk files. The installation continues, but then the problem comes: by overall progress: 6 of 8 remaining it stops and I get the next report:

,baymagic1,2012-01-08T11:57Z,"Hello,

If you need help please follow these steps, you will be success 100%. First of all I thank you to Chris, you are awesome bro. Some of you who has problem actually doesn't read and follow the steps, in fact everything is on install.txt. I am going to tell you what I have done. Let's start it!

1. I use MagicISO software (i downloaded here) to open my ISO folder then I just open my  AUTODESK.REVIT... folder then extract ""rac2010.ISO"" into new folder that I created for it. I also extract the keygen in same folder.
2. After extract your ""rac2010.iso"" and keygen run your setup... open your instal.txt folder, because there are you will see serial numbers and a product key you will need those numbers.
3. Copy one of the serial key then paste on activation of Revit window (not keygen) and  copy product key as well then hit the next. 
4. when you done with this you will have a request code (this needs for keygen request selection). I disable my network connection and then I selected ""I have an activation code from Autodesk"" option. 
5. I open my keygen as a run as administrator (if u don't know how to open right click on keygen you will see a window there is a option for run as administrator select that).
6. Do not make any silly things just hit Mem patch (if you do, this why you see ""you need to apply...."" or other problems you open with 64bit instead 32bit if you are using) I could not copy and paste my request code from my Revit so I use keyboard in order to get activation code. 
7. After copy and paste your request code from Revit window in request box (in keygen) then hit generate. Copy your activation code from keygen paste in Revit empty boxes. 
8. You will have some missing numbers but it's fine just click next it will be activated. 

This info for who has newer, noob, but also could not understand to other's help, so I fell I have to help those people sorry for long comment. I come often but not as sign on, I may not reply your other question just follow the basic steps. Good luck,"
,Mxyplyzk,2012-01-09T08:32Z,"Update for Mac users: 
If you plan to use this on a virtual machine like Parallels or Fusion, get boot camp set up and install Revit from within the virtual environment. Do not install it from the boot camp partition unless you plan to consistently use Revit from that environment. Autodesk licensing is very fickle with virtual machines, and is not reliable when you try switching back and forth between OSX and Windows partitions. Pick one path to use, and stick with it! This is a great torrent - thanks Chris-Aksel."
