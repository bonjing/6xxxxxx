,msovic,2012-02-06T16:07Z,"When I start Revit writes to me: "" The default tamplate file you have specified does not exist: C:/ProgramData/Autodesk/RST2012/Templates/USMetric/StructuralAnalasys-DefaultMetric.rte "".
Then I press CLOSE.
In fact, the folder C :/ ProgramData/Autodesk/RST2012/Templates does not exist ???...
Then, when open new project it says: ""An error has occurred while drawing the contents of this window. The Window shall be closed"".
And thats it... I cant even try this ???
ANY HAVE SAME PROBLEM ??? OR ITS JUST ME :("
