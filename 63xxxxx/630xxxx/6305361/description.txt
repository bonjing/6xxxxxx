                Les/Lesley discovers some of Donald's clothes on the
                nudist beach - and it seems that Donald has left
                Jacqueline a note. The Garveys are gearing up for the
                opening of Madge's new bar, but when Lucky Kev
                arrives with some free tickets for a theme park, Mick
                packs the women and children off for the day. Pauline
                turns to the bottle as she awaits news on her
                divorce. Jacqueline, Kenneth and Gavin head off to
                pay their respects to Donald - but nothing goes to
                plan and Jacqueline is involved in a rather unusual
                water-skiing accident. As Gavin's patience with
                Kenneth reaches its limit, Troy appears - and brings
                some life-changing news.
