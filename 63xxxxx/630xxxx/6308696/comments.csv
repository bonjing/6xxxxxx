I know you have uploaded the JP trilogy in FS but the quality of those are bad,the picture is pixelated and blurry. Please can u upload them as  DVD5s( movie only) like you did for Anger Management. Please I have been looking for good quality versions of these for long but never found any active torrents. Please help. Thanks a lot in advance. Please reply."
