Episode 4

Police struggle to hold on to their suspect after he is hospitalised. Meanwhile, believing that the killer may still be at large, prostitutes exploited by an organised ring are terrified to work the Paris streets. Judge Roban's judgement risks falling prey to the tyranny of emotion as friction between his professional and personal life starts to make itself felt. And former public prosecutor Pierre Clement joins the bar to partner up with talented but unscrupulous solicitor Josephine Karlsson.
