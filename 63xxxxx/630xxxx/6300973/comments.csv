,nilb0g,2011-06-04T17:23Z,"thanks a lot, dude! I was losing my hope. It's going pretty slow, though, I hope more seeders will come."
,Teddikilla,2011-06-05T02:12Z,"@nilbog: dw, I downloaded it and it went slow at first but picked up to 800kb's a sec >."
,Teddikilla,2011-06-08T12:43Z,"Ahh, I just tested the connection speed again and it's pretty inconsistent, like 50kb's for a minute then shoots to 1100 kb's then 5 mins later it's back to 400 :\
I'm seeding all torrents I have at the fullest I can, sorry if you end up with a somewhat lousy speed :\"

,skollatus2,2012-04-01T13:14Z,"This was a bitch to look up!

the tpb and torrentz search engines both disregarded the '7' in the search term 'samurai 7'
Wading through pages and pages of everything tagged with samurai for about ten minutes...

Worth it though! Thanks dude"
