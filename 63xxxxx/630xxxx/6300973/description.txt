I could not find a torrent on piratebay for Samurai 7, so I uploaded it. 
Here it is. It is in dual audio MKV format. So if you use Media Player Classic (K-Lite Codec Pack).. When you are watching, Just press the 'a' key on your keyboard. That is how you switch the audio on dual audio files. Say thanks, took a bit to dig this up :]
