,tourpiack,2011-04-18T10:54Z,mr extremezone how to the download movies with subtitle..thnkz
,ghost0308,2011-05-15T04:22Z,sorry extremezone but it is nothing personal against you... it is just that this movie skips a lot of frames throughout...it is a shame compared to all your other good work. You have over 200 seeders and only 5 comments and only one has commented on this...if only people would comment more regularly it would prevent others from downloading not so good work. Peace.
