,leontee81,2011-04-13T00:31Z,"this is not ps3 compatible, after about 20 minutes into the film audio gets cut off and a message pops up saying its protected by cinavia, the movie still plays tho just with no sound not normally what happens if it cinavia protected it normally just stops the whole film after 5 mins, this has really pissed me off all the blu ray rips of this film are the same why play the film for 20 minutes before stopping it, if its not allowed to  be played on  ps3 then don't fuckin let it play from the start!?!? cheers anyway!"
,SNOWMONEY,2011-04-13T18:39Z,@leontee81  you looney head be greatful that stun is giving us bluray at an affordable size if it does not work on ps3 just fucking watch it on the laptop you used to download it and stop complaining this is the best rip i ve seen in 720p and i m downloading 1080p thx stun you are the best here.
[T],fachman,2011-04-14T00:59Z,"well, it is clear that cinavia is the pain in the ass. In modified PS3 firmware there is possible to install another player which will not have CINAVIA protection.. 
iF you ARE AFRIAD YOU can also try this TRICK WHICH WORKS ON ALL FIRMWARES

Play until the cinavia banner kicks in (after about 20mins).
Quit the movie, and go to date/time settings.
Set the time one hour back.
Resume playback and the cinavia banner will kick in again.
Quit movie again and go back to date/time.
Correct the time by moving the hour forward.
Resume playback and you`Â€Â™ll get another 20 mins."
