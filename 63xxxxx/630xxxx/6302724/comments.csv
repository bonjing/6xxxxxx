,Voiceman1,2011-04-07T22:46Z,"@ hootieman: It does say that this is a Pre-Release. 

I've never updated my version 4.0 and it still works beautifully.  

Nice Upload, Slick!"
[V],Slickinator,2011-04-08T00:54Z,"yep your welcome and personally i never use the update feature as sometimes new does not always mean better ,i test stuff out as sometimes they block the serials so an update may cause problems plus they say its good too use CleanVSO to remove older versions and do clean installs at times"
,KomKungWan,2011-04-08T07:50Z,Thanks. It is very easy and useful program.
