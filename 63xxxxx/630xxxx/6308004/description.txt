Included in the torrent are the m3u playlist file, and an output log of the cd rip.

If you are having trouble playing the files on your computer, with your media player of choice I suggest downloading and installing VLC Media Player
  http://www.videolan.org/vlc/
By default it can play just about any kind of media file you can throw at it!

If you are going to add this album to your iPod or other mp3 player, you will need to convert these files to...guess? Mp3! 

I have included a few links to freeware programs that can be used with ease to convert the music to the mp3 file extension.

If you use this first one - "Foobar2000" - you will need to have the LAME mp3 encoder, (the second link provided), if you don't already have it installed.

This one makes the process extremely simple by doing it all online for you, but takes a bit longer and is a bit more tedious having to do them all one at a time and re-download them.

To be honest, I am not too familiar with this program. It is free and said to be simple to use for converting flac to mp3.
