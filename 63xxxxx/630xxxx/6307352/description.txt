Review:

The lush-period potboiler Eternity (Chua Fah Din Salai will become even more epic in a director's cut that's been prepared by ML Bhandevenob Devakula.

The director who's also known as Mom Noi has added one hour to the theatrical version that was released in Thai cinemas back in September.

The director's cut, which will screen for two weeks at Bangkok's House cinema, is said to be a more accurate presentation of Mom Noi's screenplay and will explain more about the motivation of the three characters.

Adapted from a 1943 novella by Malai Choopinit, Chua Fah Din Salai is about a love triangle that develops between a Burmese timber baron, his attractive younger wife and the man's handsome young nephew. Among the iconic images from the story is that of the cheating lovers chained together for eternity.
