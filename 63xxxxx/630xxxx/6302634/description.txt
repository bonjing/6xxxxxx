Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE) is a rolling distribution based on Debian Testing.

The purpose of LMDE is to look identical to the main edition and to provide the same functionality while using Debian as a base.

Linux Mint Xfce is rolling on top of a Debian Testing package base and uses the same repositories as LMDE.

This offers the following advantages to Linux Mint Xfce:

1) A huge performance boost

2) A continuous flow of updates which allows users to keep their system up to date

   without waiting for new releases

3) A more mainstream desktop and software selection

4) An easier maintenance for the team which makes it easier to release in both

   32-bit and 64-bit with every LMDE release
