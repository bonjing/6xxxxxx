do you have any idea?"
,Moose875,2011-04-21T14:19Z,Works. I will seed.
,modman29063,2011-06-27T19:21Z,"Yes coolrelease is a great website, you can upload anything."
,efstratios,2011-08-29T08:23Z,"Torrent doesn't work (Win7 64bit), I've tried twice, done the patching and licensing correctly and gone through all the steps properly, but I'm getting Windows NT licensing errors."
,Willium_Bob_Cole,2011-12-01T23:52Z,"only 11 seeders and got well over 1.0 MB/s, downloaded in just a couple minutes. The patcher didn't work right off for me, it tried to patch in the directory's /bin folder, instead, change the patch location to the root installation folder, for example C:\Program Files (x86)\Toon Boom Animation\Toon Boom Animate Pro 2
The license patch can install as default.

So good to have a fast torrent, cannot recommend this enough, fed up with modern game torrents with over a thousand seeders, and barely getting a few Kb/s... also this is great software, with some great tutorials and more online, if I was rich I'd totally pay for this!"
,Porksauce,2012-02-17T12:30Z,"Licence doesn't seem to work for me.

Also the torrent doesn't seem to exist on this server any more."
,Porksauce,2012-02-18T14:30Z,"Nevermind, it has to install specifically to C:\flexlm"
,share_em_all,2012-03-01T02:44Z,"It works. Thanks!
Guys, when you run the program for the first time, you should be OFFline. That's important. And to make it work when you are online you should create a blocking rule for it in Firewall."
,exifyde,2012-03-20T22:48Z,worked for me use c:/flexlm for the licence crack even if toon booms not in that drive
,zfusk,2012-03-31T04:10Z,awesome works great. you do have to install to c:/flexlm like theyre saying (w7-64bt) thanks alot for the upload
,outseeker1,2012-04-08T20:38Z,Thanks in advance! 
,tobi72,2012-04-10T19:38Z,"its not working for me, followed instructions...installed program made sure it wasnt running, ran the patch then the license..program gives me an error mssg when i try to open..set the easy patch installer both to its default /bin and to the root folder as suggested in a comment here, and allowed the license to install to the /flexml...even tried it all on and offline...not sure whats happening..it doesnt exactly look like the installation for easy patch or license gets to actually finish b4 the installr closes itself..thinking this could be the problem no idea how to fix, a little help would be much appreciated thank you"
,tobi72,2012-04-10T19:58Z,nevermind my earlier comment..after repeating the installations for the 40th sum time it seems to work...weird...
,Gomen,2012-06-15T21:40Z,"Worked fine in Win7 64bt. Though whenever I run the program there are always two error popups at the start, they don't seem to affect anything but do get a little annoying. Is this normal?"
