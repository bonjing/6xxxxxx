      Following up on his 2007 documentary, The Most Hated Family
      in America, Louis Theroux returns to Topeka, Kansas, for a
      week-long visit with the Westboro Baptist Church. He again joins
      the Phelps family on their controversial pickets where they try
      to antagonise communities with offensive slogans and anti-gay
      placards. But four years on from Louis's last visit, there are
      signs of disarray in the Phelps clan. A series of defections of
      family members has shaken up the church.
