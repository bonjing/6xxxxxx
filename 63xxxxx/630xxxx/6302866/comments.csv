SUMMARY
A dry action-comedy about two teams of government
assassins working out of a top-secret underground
facility using code names from the Tarot deck. When our
hero--The Fool--arrives for his first day at work to
find that the boss has been killed under mysterious
circumstances, he must find the killer before the whole
place blows up."
