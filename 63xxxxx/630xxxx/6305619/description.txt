                        http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083000/




A Truckie driving a Semi across Eastern Australia suspects he indirectly witnesses
the murder of a young woman when he hears disturbing noises in a motel room next to his and then sees a man dump a large body sized object in to a dumpster during the early morning hours before suddenly driving off in a green panel van.

He continues seeing the green panel van and the man in it acting suspiciously, such
as digging a hole on the side of the road and burying something (possibly evidence)
in the hole. 

Still the Truckie (or Trucker for Americans) continues driving along the highway while picking up various hitchhikers who he ends up discussing his suspicions with (including a young *Jamie Lee Curtis* named Hitch).

He also tries to phone and warn the Police of his suspicions about the man in the
green van only to ultimately become a Police suspect himself with regard to the
dissapearance and presumed murder of the, by now reported missing girl as a result
of the remains of the bodies of other missing girls having been found!

Is he justified and correct in suspecting this other guy of murdering young women or is it all nothing more than just pure co-incidence and him just being paranoid
about this guy and his mysterious actions?

Much appreciation to anyone who downloads my movie torrents!

And a special appreciation to anyone who can, or is willing to seed some or any of my torrents for as long as possible as my upload bandwidth is only around 70kb/s and even though I seed the lowest seeded torrents 24/7 as often as possible so that at least all my content remains constantly available... my upload bandwidth will only stretch so far obviously... and I have a lot of other content that I
would like to make available that currently is not available on this site!

So leechers... try to always be seeding SOMETHING when using your P2P software if
at all possible!

Otherwise at least upload and seed some sort of content of your own.

In anycase... enjoy people!
