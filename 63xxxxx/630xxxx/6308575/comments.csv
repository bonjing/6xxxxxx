Conjecture, scaremongering and concensus does not make science."

Sea levels are rising 2mm/year as they have always done (since the last ice age anyway) - well before man started chucking sh1t out of chimneys.  Do you expect the world to remain static?  No changes at all?

ANY book on global warming that uses the 'bear on an ice-flo' for promotion is pandering entirely to emotions as they know that their science won't hold up to scrutiny.
The fact that nearly ALL the images in this diatribe of a book are 'emotive' - says a lot.

A 0.7 degree rise in global temperatures over the last 100 years is NOT cause for concern (and strictly within expected values) and there is NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER that emissions from mankind are affecting the temperature - even the IPCC say so.

Meanwhile, millions will die because they can't afford to heat their homes because of Global Warming Taxation madness that is afflicting us all FOR NO GOOD REASON."

PS: Why are you fools here voting the book down on the quality meter because they disagree with global warmign policies? Grow the fuck up."
