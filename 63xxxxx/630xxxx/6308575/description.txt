These 540 signed entries explore the science, debates, and controversies surrounding climate change. They range in length from 400 to 2000 words and are labeled according to 26 broad categories that include animals, astronomy, chemistry, conferences, environmentalism, ethics, organizations, and popular culture. Shorter entries include a definition of a term and an explanation of its significance with regard to climate change; longer essays offer overviews, biographies, and explanations of laws and treaties. Of singular interest are pieces providing information on each of the 20 nations with the highest annual emissions of greenhouse gases. 


Special features include a table of contents organized by category; cross-referencing at the end of each essay; lists of tables, maps, and sidebars, and of common units of measure; and several appendixes and indexes providing information about key people involved in the field's science and debate. The objective presentations look at both sides of the issues. The variety and scope of the topics examined in this set make it an important addition for science collections.
