,yashzn,2011-04-10T18:16Z,"Not recommended. Very choppy audio, recorded with bad signal strength. Plus somewhere during Arty's set, we hear a random Fallout Boy track! However, the rest of Inspirons uploads including the previous ASOT500 sets are flawless."
,feitosathiago,2011-04-10T20:25Z,"cant wait for the rest of the day *-*

thank you inspiron"
