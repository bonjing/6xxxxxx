In the late 1980s or early 1990s there was a Pakistani movie â€œShaniâ€ which features an alien being who lands in a Pakistani village. His planet is naturally being destroyed and his people are looking for a refuge. In the end of the movie the alien reveals that he and other members of his species also profess Islam.
