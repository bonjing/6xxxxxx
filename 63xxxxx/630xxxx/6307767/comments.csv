,ganjaripz,2011-04-11T11:51Z,"@sley16, your pc was infected before download this torrent.

All my torrents are clean,
Even AVG AntiVirus 2011 (updated 05/11)
Says its 100% clean....

Dont blame somebody else, if you cant keep your pc clean."
,ganjaripz,2011-04-11T11:52Z,You can always look @ the inside of the .bat files with notepad btw
,Hunterm6,2011-04-11T16:40Z,trojans? its joke
,ganjaripz,2011-04-11T19:54Z,"ha ha what a joke..

The fuckin lil kid scared away 90% of possible new vietcong players... "
,cigskillu,2011-04-12T01:12Z,"The audio is not working for me, i have an E-MU404 sound card that is functioning with music files and also fruity loops. Any suggestions or similar problems? The unzipped files also totaled 2.10GB. "
,cigskillu,2011-04-12T01:28Z,In the Vietcong multi-player demo the audio works fine.
,cigskillu,2011-04-12T01:32Z,Disabled the  log files and got the audio working!!!
,ganjaripz,2011-04-12T14:48Z,"On some PC's, vietcong requires that a microphone is connected to the pc. Even a speaker in the microphone connection will make the  game work.

Its an issue with the realtrek soundcard drivers.
Even Call of Duty games on pc suffer from this  problem."
,iam73,2011-05-12T05:01Z,"It's infected all right... Exactly why did you pack this with UPX? Do you have anything to hide?
You created shit by the way, give credit to the real cracker dumbass!"
,ganjaripz,2011-06-15T17:24Z,"What is with people these days.

- This is 100% virus free, your virus scanner might see the windows 7 launcher as a virus but is not.

- I play this game everyday online and its working good.

- I Posted this torrent because the online community is shrinking.

- People who never posted torrents / PROBABLY NEVER SEED SHOULD NOT COMPLAIN!!

- Credit to the cracker? Lol this crack whas on my PC for 10 years.. I dont remember who made it..."

Is this a european version or an american one?
Because, an american one sucks due to have been censored."
,ganjaripz,2011-06-18T19:38Z,"@K8_Rcher

,lbgdude,2011-07-17T21:15Z,"Sorry, but I seem to have a problem. It doesn't start. I dont know what I may have done wrong, but well... it doesnt start. Can someone help? :)"
,ganjaripz,2011-07-17T22:47Z,"@howryou,
I've found out on the internet, some people need to plugin a microphone/mp3 headset into the microphone input connection on your pc. So that the sound in vietcong works.

@lbgdude,
Do you get some error message? If so, plz tell us what.
Did you try to start the game with the .BAT shortcut? You need to launch it twice the first time. Becuase first time it updates the launcher tool.

If if not work, plz report back here, ill try to help you out."
,lbgdude,2011-07-17T23:19Z,"well... no I dont get an error message, that little timeglass pops up next to the mouse-icon, and nothing more. should I try to unzip it again? And in that little launcher tool-box, what should i type in? I'm not really good at this, and a .bat I guess, is the ""windows command"" type of file? (sorry if my english is bad, im from sweden!"" Thx 4 your help!"
,ganjaripz,2011-07-20T21:24Z,"@lbgdude

1. Extract files

2. Launch: ""Start Vietcong Fist Alpha.bat"" (The windows command file)

It will ask you to browse to the ""Vietcong.exe"" file

In the VCStarter Configurator check the following options:
- Windows Vista / Windows 7 compatibility with Hradba
- Improve texture filtering

Then press on OK

-->
3. Now every time you start the ""Start Vietcong Fist Alpha.bat"" (The windows command file)
It will start up the Vietcong game automaticly with the Expansion pack loaded."
,ganjaripz,2011-07-20T21:28Z,"@lbgdude

if you have a realtek soundcard, you need to connect a microphone / or audio plug, that you cut of a audiocable.

dont know why..."
,ganjaripz,2011-07-20T21:33Z,"@lbgdude

And if you dont have UAC disabled in W7, check the ""VCStarterGuide.jpg"" in the game folder

Probably need to make a better readme for a torrent next time. But because im stoned 24/7 i forget some stuff now and then"
,ziri88,2011-09-18T12:55Z,"hey dude, I've downloaded this and everythings fine till I'm starting extraction, it comes to 16% and then appears error - ""archive data corrupted decompression failed"". what now?"
