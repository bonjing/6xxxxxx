About :
DAVID MURRAY REVISITS THE SPANISH REPERTORY OF NAT KING COLE
This is a heartfelt love letter to one of the great figures in popular music who was nonetheless a phenomenally gifted jazz musician. Nat â€˜Kingâ€™ Cole had a piano technique that belied the gilt edged romanticism of his voice, yet it was as a singer that he achieved worldwide fame.
One of Coleâ€™s most charming recordings were the 1958 and 1962 albums, Cole EspaÃ±ol and More Cole en EspaÃ±ol, recorded in Havana and featuring Spanish lyrics. Now, more than 50 years after its release, saxophonist David Murray, a contemporary jazz great, reprises Cole EspaÃ±ol as Cole â€˜En EspaÃ±olâ€™, in the company of a Cuban string band, giving the original repertoire a lush sonic canvas full of shimmering, sensual hue
