The battle of the sexes? The forces of despair and seduction? On S. Miguel in the Azores, RogÃ©rio, a young man with old money, and his enigmatic wife Leonor host a garden party at their villa. The intriguing guests are an older unmarried couple, the philosophical and observant Irene, and Michel, a rouÃ©;. While RogÃ©rio and Irene talk, Michel and Leonor go down to the sea. The conversations upset RogÃ©rio and capture Leonor's imagination. Five years later, the four dine at the villa. Michel and Leonor again leave the other two. Intentions and undercurrents are subtle. One of the four proves strong, one weak, and two must choose. Wind and rain bring down the curtain on both acts.
