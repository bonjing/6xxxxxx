,lacopa,2011-04-29T14:13Z,"Once i played this movie on a VLC or some commercial movie software and i think the quality are good. But, when i played this movie with an HDTV; wow! great quality!  

A: 8
V: 8.5

,behindyou,2011-09-21T19:19Z,"WTF? This isn't HD! I played it on VLC, it looks like shit! I used Vegas pro 10 to check the resolution, it showed it was 720x400, not 1280x720.

Oh, and the watermark isn't nice.

Overall, I say it's not worth it."
