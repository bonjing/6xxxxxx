Only Yesterday by Studio Ghibli and Grave Of The Fireflies Director Isao Takahata

Japanese language with English Subtitles High Quality Divx

Realizing that she is at a crossroads in her life, bored twenty-something office worker Taeko heads for the countryside. The trip dredges up forgotten memories, the first stirrings of childish romance, puberty and growing up, the frustration of math and boys. In lyrical switches between the present and the past, Taeko wonders if she has been true to the dreams of her childhood self.

Beautifully evoking both the 1960's and 1980's. Only Yesterday is a double period piece, and the quintessential drama of Japanese school day nostalgia. Directed by Isao Takahata and produced by Hayao Miyazaki, it is a classic of the anime medium and the last movie from the world-beating Studio Ghibli catalog previously unreleased in the United Kingdom... until now.
