,irich,2011-04-10T00:21Z,if i were you i would remove this torrent as soon as possible as i can personally tell you from working with the band that they will take legal action against any individual uploading the album as many other people will soon be going to court

They need some exposure somewhere, they are great, had i never downloaded any of their stuff, they never would have sold the albums I now own."
