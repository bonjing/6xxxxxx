Gaza in Crisis - Noam Chomsky & Ilan Pappe (2010) - PDF - GCJM

=========


In Gaza in Crisis, Noam Chomsky and Ilan Pappe, two of the conflictâ€™s most insightful critical commentators, survey the fallout from Israelâ€™s conduct in Gaza and place it into the context of Israelâ€™s longstanding occupation of Palestine.

Israelâ€™s Operation Cast Lead was described by a UN fact finding mission as 'a deliberately disproportionate attack designed to punish, humiliate and terrorize a civilian population.' The winter 2008-09 assault claimed the lives of 1,400 Palestinians and thrust the crisis in Gaza into the center of the debate about the Israel Palestine conflict.

With the constant humiliation of living a life punctuated by regular military incursions and ubiquitous checkpoints, Gaza has come to be known as the worldâ€™s largest open-air prison.
