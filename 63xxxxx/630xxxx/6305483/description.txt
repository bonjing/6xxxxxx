Let It Bleed Mono Edition (Mecca LX 5025)

The mono edition of Let It Bleed was released when the stereo format had become standard in the industry.  It had such a limited release that the LP is one of the rarest Rolling Stones albums on the market.  The rarity of the album is out of all proportion to any merit it may have since there are no differences between the stereo and mono mixes of the individual tracks and Decca simply combined the stereo signal to make it mono.  In 2003 a faux Decca label in Germany released Let It Bleed (LK-5025) in a digipack in two editions.  The first was a straight needle drop of the LP with the songs only, and the second added additional outtakes and alternative versions from the sessions that produced the album.  

Let It Bleed Mono Edition on the Mecca label is a duplication of the second Germany release.  This has the LP in mono with bonus tracks added.  The outtakes include the ubiquitous â€œGimme Shelterâ€ take with Keith on vocals (in stereo), the early version of â€œLoving Cup,â€ and â€œYou Got The Silverâ€ with Mick on vocals.  Also included is the alternate â€œMemo From Turnerâ€ which wasnâ€™t included on Metamorphosis or the film Performance.  The final track is the mono single mix of â€œHonky Tonk Womenâ€ which is also quiet rare.  This is packaged in a digipack with a duplication of the artwork on the outside and inside track information.  Since there isnâ€™t any difference between the mono and stereo mixes this doesnâ€™t add much to the collection.  But for the obsessive this is a very clean transfer of the LP.
