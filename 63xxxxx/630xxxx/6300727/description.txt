           After a long and unsuccessful period trying to have a          
           family, Claire and Adrian finally adopt a girl. The            
           coming of Isabel is desired by almost the whole family         
           but making a six-year-old girl with a past of her own fit      
           into her new life might be something more complicated          
           than they expected. Strange things start to happen from        
           the moment Isabel "and her imaginary friend, Stevie",          
           come to live with them. The situation becomes more             
           complicated when Stevie's behavior becomes aggressive.         
           Only Claire and Isabel know that Stevie is more than just      
           a figment of Isabel's imagination. Claire, with the no         
           one's support, will do everything to find out who Stevie       
           is and what he wants. Perhaps if she succeeds, she will        
           be able to recoup their lives and have the family she had      
           desired for so long.
