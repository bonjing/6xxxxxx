SmartCEO is a regional â€œgrowing companyâ€ publication. We are not news; we are a resource full of Smart ideas to help educate and inspire decision-makers. SmartCEO is read by more than 50,000 business owners in Baltimore, Philadelphia and Washington DC metro markets. Each issue includes features, interviews, case studies, columns and other departments designed to help this regionâ€™s CEOs face the daily challenge of running a business. SmartCEO believes that a â€œgrowing companyâ€ is determined by the spirit, drive and dynamics of a companyâ€™s owners and managers, rather than by the size of the building, the number of its employees, or its sales volume. Thatâ€™s why our focus is on decision makers from many different-sized businesses.
