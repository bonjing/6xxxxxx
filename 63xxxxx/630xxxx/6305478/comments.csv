,po-po,2011-04-09T20:49Z,"The keygen gives 4 blocks of numbers like v17. v18 needs 5 blocks of numbers 

GR12-1436-7103-7542 needs one more set of 4"
,toppvos,2011-04-09T21:17Z,In the keygen you will find different versions of Turbocad. V 17 has 4 blocks and V 18 has 5 blocks. Scroll down in the core keygen and you will find Turbocad 18. Good luck

,gord320,2011-04-16T04:57Z,says there should be 4 files.  I only got three.  No keygen.  That is a slight problem?  Any ideas? Help?
,gord320,2011-04-19T03:18Z,"Got it to work.  Turned off anti-virus to download the keygen.  Seems to be OK!!  Many thanks to ""toppvos"""
,Cerebral222,2011-04-20T11:00Z,"Worked well, very nice software. Keygen will come up as a bug as alot of keygens do, I turned off the AV and compressed the keygen with winrar so that the AV won't pick it up as a bug later on. My thanks to the uploader and the seeders."
,gord320,2011-04-21T01:50Z,"Yes, thanks to all.  Good idea about the winrar compress."
