Metaform, the LA-raised hip hop music producer made famous for his acclaimed debut album release, â€œStanding on the Shoulders of Giants,â€ has taken the fruits of his labors and given them a neon-electro supplement. The end-result is a new album, â€œThe Electric Mist,â€ a broad collection of electro pop that stands apart from the sound he was famous for. Metaform has changed ways with this album. There was no explosion at curtainâ€™s open this time, no overabundance of soul and funk samples, but rather a winding up of progressive music interlaced with synthetic urban culture. The opening track, â€œElectric Eyes,â€ started me down a path of club-set electro and down tempo r&b. I caught onto the auto-tune, and immediately began to worry. I was worried that Metaform had lost his roots with the west coast music scene in which he so successfully found himself.
