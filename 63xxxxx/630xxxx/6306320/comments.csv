,JebusKryst,2011-04-09T17:46Z,Seriously people you NEED to check this out. Its one of the best comic series of the last 20 years. Shame it never sold well - the critics and fans loved it.

,garouterry,2012-04-20T19:01Z,Have to agree. GC is one of THE most underappreciated series of the modern era. Storytelling by Brubaker is superb. Thank you very much for this Internet_Ninjacy!
