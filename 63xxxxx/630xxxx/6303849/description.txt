Streets Of Rage Remake v5 final 2011 created by Bombergames.
None of SEGA original files were used and this game was created from scratch. 8 YEARS of hardwork.

Recently SEGA toke down SORR downloads from the official Bombergames site and prohibited them from hosting it.

Yes SEGA publisher may have copyrights to Streets Of Rage, however a fan of their games and his team spent half of their life (8 years) to recreate the game up to today\'s standard. And you are telling me some corporation told you not to host the download, whereas you spent 8 years of your life making this.

DOWNLOAD!
