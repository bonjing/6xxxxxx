torrent link is not working"
,SlipShifter,2011-04-09T05:11Z,"For anyone weary of this yes it does actually work through the magnet link, no it's not a virus but MAN!!! IT TOOK EIGHT YEARS TO DEVELOP???!! WTF??
The creators are seriously attempting to break into the wrong industry!! It's a SLIGHTLY better version to the original, hardly warranting the need for a remake.."
