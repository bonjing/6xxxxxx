   The Robinson Crusoe TV series by Franco-London Films,starring Robert Hoffman, was a delight for school children in the UK during the 1960's. Shown during the Summer holidays it was notable for its theme tune by Robert Mellin and Gian-Pero Reverberi. 
  A firm favourite still for many 40+'s. Rescued from a French film archive in 1982, it is still a pleasure to watch.
Includes an Interview with Robert Hoffman and a collection of images.
  Nostalgia at its best.
         
       Enjoy.
