,Steerage,2011-04-08T09:38Z,My first upload. Do please let me know if it is faulty. I will seed until it has enough support.

About the main question, which edition is this since this seems to have 14 episodes in total? Is this the complete series, comprising of 14 episodes then?"

Just to clarify, we have all 14 episodes, 2 slide shows, a chat show interview with the (original) Hoff and, which might have confused, episode 1 again but in French."
