,wizzkid1970,2011-04-09T21:04Z,you extratorrent dudes suck how many times you put imageshack image links in your torrents that have link to your site in them so imageshack bans them so we cant see the image of the movie you guys are pathetic and more than useless get a brain and use it stop using imageshack and use something else to link images elsewhere !!!
[V],SaM,2011-04-09T21:29Z,"dump ass..there is a sample u can download and check,imageshack links wont work from tpb,u can view the screens in any other site if u want..just google the hash,and no one forcing u to download out work,so get a life "
,mcgrathswrath94,2011-04-09T21:30Z,"@wizzkid1970 The imageshack links work fine you idiot. If you knew how to use things properly,You'd know to right click them and open in new tab. Quit bitching false statements based upon your idiocy!

Great upload as always SaM"

,andre1264,2011-04-10T13:51Z,not fucking working for me either...
,xBSAACHRIS434x,2011-04-10T15:22Z,"RIGHT CLICK THE IMAGESHACK LINK AND CLICK OPEN LINK IN NEW WINDOW!!! 
IT ALWAYS WORKS!!! 
Thanks for the up SaM!!"
,ahlc,2011-04-10T20:35Z,"Folks, register on Imageshack and login to the site. Then click on any imageshack link. It'll show the image for sure! No point in abusing someone when they've taken efforts to rip the movie and put it up for us to get here!"
,KAKARAT,2011-04-11T03:22Z,ALL U NEED TO DO IS RIGHT CLICK ON LINK THEN COPY SHORTCUT THEN PASTE THEM YOUR BROWSER
,KAKARAT,2011-04-11T03:26Z,ALL U NEED TO DO IS RIGHT CLICK LINK COPY SHORTCUT THEN PASTE TO YOUR BROWSER AND BAM ITS DONE!!!!
,kaya.md,2011-04-11T23:02Z,usually movies that have more than 3 words in the title suck major
,daddyjerz,2011-04-12T20:59Z,I can't stop laughing at the irony behind this wizkid's and the fact he can't do something as simple as right click the damn link... hil-ar-ious!!  Anyways what's the a/v guys? I'm sure it's good because extratorret rocks though
,jadawgkss,2011-04-13T00:27Z,How bad is this movie?
,shellmanbkk,2011-04-14T01:33Z,"Actually you are all a Joke as the Images where INDEED removed by Imageshack, so all of you who are talking about stupidity, you are the ones who are actually stupid for not even trying :)"
,demonicperdition,2011-04-17T01:40Z," There were 2 pixelating parts but other than that it was a great film. the images load fine for me, I don't see what everyone is crying about. Be glad you are getting a film thats not even officially released yet, lol."
,noel_lee,2011-04-19T02:54Z,whats wrong after 21:58?looks like it just jumped over to some other scenes.
,noel_lee,2011-04-19T02:57Z,it should be 1 h 32 mins.but here its 1 h 25 mins
,2manydoobies,2011-04-24T08:44Z,"A: 8-9
V:8 
fell asleep to street kings 1 a few times havent seen the ending, i like ray better than keanu"
,Notor1ous,2011-06-27T11:52Z,"I also noticed that the movie seems to be missing something at around 21:58. Im gona download another copy.. dont want to be potentially missing out scene, come on what is this? ... ""Pirate bay and the pirates who had holes in their ships?"""
,Notor1ous,2011-06-28T05:46Z,"The 1.6gb copy by ""tvteam"" is better than this, especially seeing as it doesn't have about 5 minutes missing from the video starting at: 21:58"
,scottsasse,2011-09-13T07:57Z,"@Notor1ous, Ha ha your comment had me laughing and Imageshack IS a BIG F'N WASTE of time and no one should use it. There are plenty of other image hosting sites that noobs can figure out how to work thus avoiding 20 stupid comments on a torrent. However these are SaM's torrents so if you want them then play by his rules!! And I'm here to testify that 96% of SaM's torrents are FLAWLESS. When you upload as much as he does a few mistakes will mathematically happen. Besides it's FREE so stop moaning like a woman giving childbirth!! "
