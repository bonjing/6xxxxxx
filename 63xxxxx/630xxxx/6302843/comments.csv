,meegs*23,2011-04-09T11:15Z,"looks like apk depends of the processor in the device. This one only works for snapdragons.
Use this one:

,vbabiciu,2011-04-10T22:47Z,Hi meegs*23. The application does not work on HTC Desire. Could you do something? Thank you.
,meegs*23,2011-04-10T23:44Z,"Hey everyone, sorry to hear you having problems to run it. The only thing I found online and comes to my mind can be (accidently) an issue with running it is this: 
""When you run the game for the first time make sure internet is on!, or else this crack won't work, after the first run you can play as many times as you wan't in offline mode"" 
I just read it myself sorry i didnt post ir straight away I had no idea ;)
Try installing it again and make sure internet is on when running first time. Let me know if it works. Cheers."
,tejbir,2011-04-11T04:38Z,"i got desire hd and meegs*33 ur formula which u  mentioned above ""the game will work first time only if internet is on"" is not working....do something else mate......we are waiting.....hands crossed........:( "
,patomo09,2011-04-11T18:48Z,"i downloaded this ( http://bitsnoop.com/asphalt-6-adrenaline-hd-2010-androi-q23700548.html ) i put the files in the folder you have downloaded from here and used the apk i found here (not the russian)... it will verify your files and then say that connection failed try again ? press no and in 10 seconds should start playing fine. 
(have in mind that the volume of the game is related to the ringer volume) i hope i helped ........!"
,patomo09,2011-04-11T18:55Z,i forgot to mention that i am using desire hd and crono sense hd rom...
,D0N007,2011-04-11T23:42Z,will it work on xperia arc
,hunter689,2011-04-30T17:13Z,"Hey meegs. I too have a Desire HD, i have followed all instructions! Only... the intro video of the game plays, after its done it returns to my main screen of the phone ""as if thats that"". Is there not perhaps a more detailed method of installation as the one you provided is minimal. Currently in a third world country so as you can imagine... i have to pay my arse off for internet usage!!!

Please help with this problem, im getting really tired of playing ""angry birds"". Need something a bit more age restricted with hot graphics, from the size of the extracted files (nearly a gigabyte) i was hoping for just that. I was mistaken. So ye... Please help with this issue.

Thank you kindly :-)"
,patomo09,2011-05-06T15:36Z,hunter689.. try to follow my instructions... !!
,bluema9ic,2011-06-06T13:11Z,this doesn't seem to work for HTC EVO.  thanks for trying though.
,jakelong,2011-06-22T20:47Z,"it didn't work on my samsung galaxy sl.
when i tried apk in d torrent it crashed after the intro. this means that the apk is recognizing the game data in the memory....other apks r askin for download.
so i'm guessing this wont work on other models.
correct me if i am wrong"
,kubisara,2011-06-27T13:07Z,"Your app for motorola works, the game strats and you can even actually play the game. Unfortunately not for long, the game crashes all the time in the career mode, and sometimes in quick race. I found somewhere in the internet some informations, that gameloft produced this game unplayable, don't know how much truth there is in it."
,D4rk-C0d3,2011-07-21T15:51Z,"Doesn't Works for SAMSUNG GALAXY S , Searching for some .apk's now , Will report if it works. Bye guyz! and Do share if you guyz have a solution. "
,kuttikabacha13,2011-10-24T17:12Z,"i have htc desire hd,,its running android 2.3 official,,and is not rooted..will it possible for me to play this game without rooting my phone"
