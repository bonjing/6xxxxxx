The debut feature of master animator Isao Takahata (Grave Of The Fireflies, Pom Poko), The Little Norse Prince tells the tale of Hols, a brave young boy who pulls a blade out from a centuries-old Rock Giant only to discover that it is the Sword Of The Sun. If re-forged, the sword's destiny will transform the boy into the Prince Of The Sun.

Urged by his father, Hols and his pet bear Coro travel to his ancestral village, a place destroyed by the Frost King Grunwald. Along the way, he helps a village whose residents are besieged by Grunwald's magic, but the villagers feel threatened when he befriends Hilda, a beautiful girl whose haunting songs conceal a dark secret.

Fusing Japanese folklore with a Scandinavian setting, Takahata"s epic adventure shows the hallmarks of later Studio Ghibli productions: well-rounded characters, dazzling animation and incredible imagination.
