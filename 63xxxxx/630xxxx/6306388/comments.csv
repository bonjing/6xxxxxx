[T],trialNerror,2011-04-10T01:10Z,"If you don't like my f***ing torrents don't f***ing download from me, you annoying motherf***er.

I don't give a wild goddamn what your site ep guide says.  Each site has a different f***ing listing.  Travel Channel says it's season 3.  TVrage says season 4.  Wikipedia says this is middle of season 5.

STFU and enjoy the damn show."

,Nickyboy7,2011-04-10T16:36Z,If you have a smaller file in the 350mb range could you upload it please. Thanks. I don't have the space for HD episodes.
[T],trialNerror,2011-04-11T01:22Z,"One of my favorite of all time uploaders CRiMSON released the XviD version of this episode if you want the 350MB copy.

,frenchmichaels,2011-04-11T03:37Z,"i like your torrents just saying release them right no need for all that foul language and insults.
but ill give you a take it back but only once so take it back"
[T],trialNerror,2011-04-11T05:40Z,"Your comments have been nothing but complaints.
You say there is no season 5, so I change it to season 4, then other people say it's season 5.
WTF?!
I guess there's always going to be at least a couple sour apples in every basket.

I am not taking anything back, ""assh*le""."
,UberGeek,2011-04-12T07:40Z,"I think it just be done and call this episode the first of season 5 as no one is agreeing on the episode numbering (IMBD, TV.com, Travel, Wikipedia, etc.)

But since there was only 8, 16, and 9 episodes in the previous seasons 21+ is enough for the season."
,DanishCake,2011-05-09T22:12Z,It's not from Season 5.. it's Season 4 episode 22
