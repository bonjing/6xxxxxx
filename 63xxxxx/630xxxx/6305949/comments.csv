,xgamer24,2011-04-17T04:32Z,"@ShiftNoob this is not a fucking virus, its probably the crack and your shit anti virus clashing everyone else said it is great.
@Pietray6 Dude your not supposed to install it thats the whole idea you just run the age.exe and play, mabe on first run on your system you will need the serial key which is 
DXR32-X44M7-CYTCX-P6H6P-97CPG
thankyou have a nice day :) and have fun"
,xgamer24,2011-04-17T04:36Z,"@windows 7 users
if you are having compatibility problems i have a few things that might work
a) right click on age.exe and go into properties and then in the compatibility tab tick run this program in compatibility mode for... 
then in the drop down box click on windows xp service pack 3
b) install fucking windows xp because it can run almost every game out there except for shitty old windows 98 games npt including ( donkey kong and madd stuff like that)
thanks :) lol"

,austinrock1,2011-05-07T06:59Z,"good stuff man NO VIRUS GUYS you antivirus, whether its's mcaffee or AVG pretty much anything will sometimes register a crack in a game as a virus, this is one of the false positive moments. 
THERE ARE NO VIRUSES!!"

Is there any solution to this problem?? "
,crazyawesomeyeah96,2011-05-08T06:39Z,On the skirmish mode of the game it shows an error message on the loading screen refering to something with the AI file not being found but it lets me play but the AI does not build or fight back unless i destroy there only building but its all civilians.Ive even tried on the hardest difficulty and with the weakest soilders and its still the same. what do I do?  
,EmperorNapoleon,2011-05-09T06:39Z,"Ill start off by saying that it works great. 

Now for those of you that are having Windows 7 problems, here is how to resolve the issue. 

1. Right click on Age3 and set Compatibility to Windows XP SP3, apply. 

2. Search for ""d3dx9_25.dll aoe3"" in google and download the respected file from dll-files.com or any other source that you think is trusted. Once file is complete move this downloaded file into ur AOE3 folder. 

3. Once i clicked to run the game it gave me a MSXML 4.0 file problem. I searched google for this file and came across microsofts site and downloaded the file msxml.msi(http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=7f6c0cb4-7a5e-4790-a7cf-9e139e6819c0&displaylang=en) installed the file and the game ran perfectly fine. 

Enjoy guys. "
,2SR5er,2011-05-15T20:37Z,works perfectly thank you :)

,Budiulik58,2011-05-22T20:05Z,"I have a problem,when saving a game it automatically saves it in pause mode.When i try to load the saved game i cannot unpaused it.I made a little search and the solution would be to update the game to the last patch but when i try to do the update i get a error message""there is a problem with bla bla you should unistall the game"".Now how can i uninstall the game if is not installed on my PC? Any help would be very much appreciated.Thanks"
,Lermantov,2011-06-02T23:39Z,does multiplayer work?
,masterninjachop,2011-06-15T14:24Z,"Works great if you follow directions. As a precaution, I would go ahead and download the ""d3dx9_25.dll"" file from a trusted site. DO NOT USE MICROSOFT'S SITE TO OBTAIN THE .DLL FILE. After obtaining the .dll file, place it in the ""Age of Empires III"" folder. And then enjoy, and ty to XGamer for the torrent. By the way, the tips above are for Vista users but might work for Windows 7 as well."

If there isn't a way, how could you fix it?"

First download the file: http://www.dll-files.com/pop.php?dll=d3dx9_25

Copy it in the age of empires directory.
Then rightmouse on age3.exe  and create a short cut. Right mouse on the shortcut go to compability and set to windows 2000.

After download is done. All you gotta do is make a folder on your desktop, name it AOE3. Put the Rar in there, extract it in the folder using winrar or 7zip. google and down load msxml 4. Click the AOE3 icon after its extracted, and enter the key DXR32-X44M7-CYTCX-P6H6P-97CPG"
