Welcome to the New World of Strategy 

---------------------------------- Information ----------------------------------


It's the dawn of a new age in real-time strategy (RTS) games. A brave New World is rising â€“ a hostile yet beautiful world, filled with innovative gameplay, new strategic scenarios, eye-searing graphics and much more. 

Welcome to a world called Age of Empires III. 

New Feature â€“ Home Cities 

Players have access to their own European Home City for economic, technological and military support. Your Home City's success depends on you, with your city's improvements retained between games. Learn more. 
  
 Full 3-D Graphics, Destructible Environments and More 

The goal of our Age of Empires III team here at Ensemble Studios wasn't just to build the best-looking graphics ever in an RTS game. It was to build the best-looking graphics in any game. Period. Did our team succeed? Find out. 
 

---------------------------------- Civilizations ----------------------------------


The Spanish have a strong military, with both hand infantry and cavalry. Flexibility in early shipments from the Home City give the Spanish the option to attack early or set up for a strong, late economy. Spanish Home City improvements benefit soldiers, buildings and naval units.    
Quick access to Settlers gives the British one of the strongest economies in the game. The ability to upgrade two key units â€“ the Musketeer and Hussar â€“ make the British military formidable in the late game. The British Home City emphasizes improvements to technology and naval warfare.  

Although the French economy starts slowly, the Coureur unit, a Villager with strong fighting skills, makes the French difficult to attack early. The French also have the strongest cavalry unit in the game â€“ the Cuirassier. Plus, the French are experts at allying with the Native Americans.    
Starting the game with two Town Centers, the Portuguese can quickly produce Settlers, control territory or support their allies. The Spyglass ability allows the Portuguese to easily spy on the enemy. The Portuguese also have a strong navy, strong light infantry and the best Dragoons in the game.  

Although Dutch Settlers are limited and costly, their civilization makes up for this economic disadvantage by building Banks and generating coin automatically. The Dutch Home City emphasizes upgrades to defense and economy.    
The Germans have fewer Settlers and therefore a slower economy. Fortunately, both the Settler Wagon and Uhlan cavalry spawn for free from the German Town Center. Plus, the Germans start with the ability to send Mercenaries from their Home City (long before other civilizations can).  

Starting the game with extra resources but fewer Settlers gives the Russians the flexibility of focusing on economy or an early raid. Russian infantry, individually weak, are trained in blocks at a faster rate, providing the Russians with the opportunity to overwhelm their enemy with greater numbers.    
For the Ottomans, Settlers spawn automatically from the Town Center. Building a Mosque and conducting research help keep that Settler production steady. Befitting their position straddling Europe and Asia, the Ottomans have more unique units than any other civilization.  
 
European civilizations can learn new technologies and gain troops by forging alliances with the Native Americans. A British player who allies with the Iroquois is essentially playing as two civilizations: the British and the Iroquois.
