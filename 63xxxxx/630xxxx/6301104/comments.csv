,iSeshan,2011-04-09T15:34Z,anyone know when season 9 airs in canada?
,luxdsg,2011-04-11T21:40Z,"Oh my gawd. Don't take legal advice from people on the internet that you don't know.

Except for the advice I'm going to give you now:
DO NOT TELL YOUR ISP YOU HAVE AN ""OPEN WIRELESS"" CONNECTION.

Don't admit to ANYTHING. Don't ignore the infringement notice either. Respond that you don't know what the hell they are talking about. And respond only once.

Make ZERO admissions. Anything you send them that's an admission to anything can be used to bite you in the ass in court in the future.

And yes -- get PEERBLOCK. "
