From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with the former Alaskan pipeline pastor and author Lindsey Williams about rising oil prices and the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East. In December, Williams told Alex that heâ€™d learned from two retired top executives of major oil producers that the price of crude oil would rise to $150-200 per barrel. Williams warns that the global elite plan to kill the dollar and bring the once great United States to its knees and reduce it to third world status. 


Film-maker, broadcaster and former broker and options trader Max Keiser makes an appearance.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
