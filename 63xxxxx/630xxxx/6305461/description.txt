
THE ROLLING STONES: METAMORPHOSIS.

This is the original U.K. edition of the 1975 rarities compilation METAMORPHOSIS.

If there is such a thing as a "legal bootleg", this might be it!
The Stones 60's U.S. manager Allen Klein put it together without the gropu's approval and they hated it!
And they are right, but nevertheless this ill-conceived LP is now part of the Rolling Stones floklore.
And so, for the die-hard fans and collector's, here it is: Metamorphosis

Take it... Or leave it!

The majority of these tracks (2-9 and all of the bonus tracks) were recorded in summer 1964, under the supervision of the Stones' manager Andrew Loog Oldham, who wanted to be an english Phil Spector, gbut failed!
The recorded songs were given to other artisits (e. g. Cliff Richard had a go at BLUE TURNS TO GREY and most of them are truly awful!
Tracks 1 and 11 are from 1966. tracks 9, 10 , 12 - 16 are Beggar's Banquet / Let is Bleed outtakes 1968/69.
