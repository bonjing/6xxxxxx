Product Description: Annals of Traditional Chinese Medicine is a new book series dedicated to the promotion of evidence-based TCM research. It features quality reports focusing on curriculum design, research methodology, original investigations of the quality, efficacy and safety of TCM, and evidence-based trials for the management of various clinical conditions. The inaugural volume of this series, Chinese Medicine -- Modern Practice, contains chapters on Chinese Herbal Medicine (for AIDS, cancer, cardiovascular disease, cerebral haemorrhage and Alzheimer disease), Acupuncture (for drug withdrawal, anaesthesia and analgesia), Research Methodology and Chinese Medicine Education. The book will be of interest to clinicians in western medicine, mainstream medical researchers, other healthcare professionals, Chinese medicine educators, clinical and basic Chinese medicine researchers, and health science students, particularly Chinese medicine students. It will also be an important resource for TCM regulators to obtain reliable and critical information concerning the evaluation of quality, efficacy and safety of clinical modalities of Chinese medicine.
