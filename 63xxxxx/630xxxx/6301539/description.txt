    As school term draws to a close the pressure is on to      
    get the teenagers back into education and attention       
    turns to the hardest-to-reach kids.                      
                                                              
    In a last-ditch effort, Jamie tries three very             
    different approaches. First, formidable dinner lady       
    Nora Sands, of School Dinners fame, is appalled by       
    their lack of punctuality and messiness, and tells        
    Jamie she thinks some are spoilt.                          
                                                              
    Next, explorer David Hempleman-Adams leads an            
    expedition up Snowdon in Wales. The experience is a       
    revelation to a bunch of mostly urban youngsters who       
    often find climbing out of bed in the morning a           
    challenge.                                               
                                                              
    And Human Rights lawyer Cherie Blair brings a reformed     
    killer into class, giving Angelique a chance to take      
    charge. She brings order to a lively debate on the       
    rights of prisoners, but can she keep her own moods       
    under control?                                             
                                                              
    Meanwhile Jamie and headmaster John challenge the        
    students to put together portfolios as evidence of        
    everything they've achieved at Dream School and some of    
    the kids really get the bit between their teeth.          
                                                             
    Jamie also calls the parents into school to encourage     
    them to make the most of their kids' potential once        
    Dream School finishes. But one of the girls immediately   
    demonstrates the scale of the challenge by bunking off   
    early.                                                    
                                                               
    Finally, Alastair Campbell reveals that he has an         
    invitation for the students to meet the Prime Minister,  
    David Cameron. But, unless some of their behaviour        
    improves, they won't all be making the trip to Number      
    Ten.
