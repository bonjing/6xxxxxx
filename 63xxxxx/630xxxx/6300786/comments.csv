genio total"
,keleieke,2011-04-12T23:23Z,"I hate when private tracker members try to recruit.  Private trackers are fine for those who can afford a seebox and/or have a fast upload rate.  For those without, private trackers are miserable especially those with relatively few members.  More often than not, once you get the file there are no leechers left.  Of course if you have a seedbox, you can steel everyone else's ratio and leave the slower connections seeding to know one.

Here at TPB, a personal ratio is easy to achieve with the high number of leechers.  Try to survive a private tracker where there are only one to two dozen leechers total... on a popular torrent.  Fast connection leechers can get the entire file in 1-2 hours and then they seed.  Everyone is done and you have a 1:0.005 ratio while they have 1:5+; what you gonna do?  Here at least the sheer numbers help to always have leechers, especially torrents from well known uploaders like Seedkey.  So I hope you don't leave TPB, Seedkey as there are few reliable DVD5 NTSC uploaders remaining.  This is where members of private trackers come when they realize they can't compete with the fast connections.  So please stay in the big pond.  Thank you!"
,keleieke,2011-04-13T19:45Z,"Even if you follow your favorite uploader to a private tracker, your ratio can't afford them.  See what I said above... the fast connections will nearly always hamper making ratio.  Therefore, it's an almost certainty that slower connection members will loose ratio.  How many downloads are possible when each one reduces ratio.  You'll have to pass-up your favorite uploader's torrents because you can't afford to loose anymore ratio.  Seedbox/fast connections gravitate to private trackers so you won't avoid this if your connection can't keep up.

On a private tracker, uploading torrents is the only way to survive without a fast connection.  Even then, you hope there is interest in what you've uploaded because with relatively few members, you may not get leechers if your stuff isn't desirable enough.  If you do manage to upload something with interest before anyone else, the fast connection members can take ratio away from even the original uploader.  How is it that an original uploader completes with a torrent ratio of 1:1 when the leechers can have 1:2+ on the same torrent?  It happens often when a fast connection member(s) gets your stuff; they'll scoop you if your connection isn't fast enough!  So even the seedbox owners are looking for more speed and paying to stay on top.  

It's a concern what is happening with torrents.  Torrents are becoming no longer free?  Will we have to purchase a seedbox to participate?  Here at TPB, seedbox owners don't frequent because there is little benefit in a non-ratio driven tracker.  They go to where their purchase makes a difference - private ratio driven trackers.  As we loose respectable uploaders to private trackers, the slower connections will only be able to keep in contact if they pay seedbox sellers.  Someone figured a way to make money off torrents.

Become a member and post to show your support for SeedKey and ask that Seedkey consider staying on TPB; do it now before we loose another of our favorite uploaders!"
[T],FatFreddy007,2011-04-13T21:35Z,"Chicos no se preocupen yo no me pienso ir de TPB, me siento muy cÃ³modo en TPB y todo lo que necesito siempre lo encuentro acÃ¡. Ahora no estoy compartiendo porque lo poco que tengo solo tiene audio inglÃ©s y se puede encontrar en otros usuarios, pero cuando tenga algo con audio inglÃ©s y espaÃ±olâ€¦lo voy a compartir."
[T],FatFreddy007,2011-04-13T22:04Z,"@keleieke: Tienes razÃ³n, es muy difÃ­cil mantener el ratio en un tracker privado, rÃ¡pidamente se agotan las sanguijuelas. 
pero mas alla del problema del ratio, quiero aclarar, en los trackers privados son comunidades muy respetuosas donde todos conparten, y no ofenden o agreden gratuitamente cuando algo no les gusta."
,keleieke,2011-04-13T23:32Z,"I agree, there are truly nice people in private tracker communities and generally everyone is on their best behavior (to stay).  On average, members of private trackers have a high level of knowledge pertaining to torrents, IMO, and they're willing to help.  I don't believe the people with fast connections ""try"" to hurt the people without, that's just the way it is.  I only wanted to share my experience with the bad part of ratio driven trackers applicable to people with slower connections (including cable service compared to even faster seedboxes).  Thank you, Seedkey, for the space to vent.  I'm glad you have no plans on leaving TPB; your uploads here are appreciated more than ever."
,hyster13,2011-04-14T13:17Z,"@keleieke

First, I wasn't recruiting SK to the private tracker; let's get that out of the way. SK was very interested in getting into BitHQ and I informed him that he can use his talents over there as well as here (If that what he choose to do).

Second, I really don't think that you had to inform SK about private trackers. However, if you have a concern about them, then feel free to drop some knowledge about them. But to me, as soon as I informed him that it BitHQ had openings, you feel like that I'm taking SK away from TPB. If SK wants to stay here strictly, that's cool. If he want to venture to BitHQ, that's cool. And if he wants to do both and / or do none, guess what; that's cool too. I didn't realize that there was TPB tampering.

Lastly, the torrent community is for sharing, whether it be movies, music, software or information. Since SK has been doing incredible work for a while here. I wanted to return the favor not with movies, but with information that he wanted. 

I did my part. SK, you are great at what you do, I'll still keep coming to you for great movies. Keep doing what you do, my man :)"
