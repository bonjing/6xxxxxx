Updating the program:
============================

- If you work in shell mode of Talisman - switch your shell in standard Windows shell Explorer.exe.
- If you need to save your previously installed default Talisman themes ("Default", "Alpine" and etc) - copy these themes in other folders.
- Install the newest version of Talisman over your previously installed version. 


Installing as default shell
===========================

At first please read the" What to do if the system will not startup with Talisman as the shell?" before installing Talisman as your default shell!

To start Talisman as default shell:
---------------------------------------------
Select "Shell Switcher" in MainMenu>Settings  to switch between shells (Talisman and Explorer). Press "Switch shell..." button and press Ok. Computer will be restarted with selected shell.

Notes for multiuser configuration of Windows2000/XP/Vista/7:  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To have possibility to use different shells for different users you have to login as Administrator (or user with Administrator rights) and switch shells with Shell Switcher  at least once. Talisman will make all necessary changes in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE key of your register. These initial changes are available only from Administrator (or user with Administrator rights) account. 
After that you can use Shell Switcher to switch shells from any user account.




Uninstalling the program:
============================

If you want to uninstall Talisman, use the Control Panel's "Add/Remove Programs." 

Exit from Talisman before uninstall!

Please do not uninstall Talisman in the shell mode of Talisman. Switch your shell to explorer.exe (useTalisman Shell Switcher ) and only then uninstall Talisman from the standard Windows shell.




Starting:
============================

Start Talisman.exe from Windows environment (by double click in Explorer for example).

Note for Windows Vista/7 users: 
If you have an error message "Exception EOIeError in module talisman.exe at 000512DC. Error creating system registry entry" at start:
It means that Talisman can not write its settings in registry and initialize Microsoft HTML plugin because you use the "User Account Control" (UAC) function on your computer. To solve this problem:

You can start Talisman as an Administrator: right click on shortcut (or shift+right click) and press "Start a Program as an Administrator".

More easy way: just uncheck the "User Account Control" in your user account settings.
