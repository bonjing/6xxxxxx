,jeffhudson,2011-09-08T20:11Z,"@Scottazord and @hele606  That is a FALSE POSITIVE.  This torrent IS CLEAN.  @ScottaZord Only 1 out of 42 picked up the virus, there are trusted torrents out that the files inside turn up five or ten FALSE POSITIVES.  Also if both of you claim there is a torrent, please include the link to the results page, so that those of us who care can compare md5 checksums."
