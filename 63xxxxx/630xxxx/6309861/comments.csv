,Cbeatse,2011-04-25T01:43Z,"Jassi you're retarded. OVA means it's an extra movie, and does not relate to the audio format of the series in any way."
,Cbeatse,2011-04-25T01:55Z,"In other news, it's english dubs with no option for japanese with subs -.-"
,1jassi,2011-04-27T11:06Z,Yo Cbeatse retard search google for what OVA means.........

,Hakito,2011-05-04T18:16Z,"Oh yea btw 1jassi, Cbeatse was actually right."
,Mynt,2011-05-24T10:18Z,"Thanks for the UL 1jassi.

And piss off Cbeatse, go upload your own torrents if you can't appreciate other uploads retard.

I'd still prefer Japanese audio with English sub, the Eng dub always sound retarded."
,Osthrys,2011-06-14T21:22Z,"Thanks for the upload, but I would like to say that OVA means Original Video Animation. 
This OVA (as many are) was released seperately from the anime, by different people with different artists and actors. It is NOT a part of the anime.
Another Air Gear OVA was recently released, and yet another is due to come out on the 17th of June. It is likely to become an OVA series."

""Original Animation Video (OAV/OVA)
Original Animation Video & Original Video Animation (OAV / OVA) are interchangeable terms used in Japan to refer to animation that is released directly to the video market without first going through a theatrical release or television broadcast. In the beginning OAV was used in Japan. However, due to confusion with Adult Video and Audio/Video electronics this acronym was gradually abandoned in favor of OVA.

Furthermore, OAVs are supposed to have original scripts, although there are exceptions. They can be based on a Manga or TV series, but the particular episode should be original. For example the Ranma Â½ TV series follows Rumiko Takahashi's Manga fairly closely, however the Ranma Â½ OAV series contains stories that were not in the original Manga series.

OAVs are generally higher quality than TV series because a larger budget is allocated to the production and more time is allowed for the work.

With very few exceptions, the vast majority of all pornographic Anime is released as OAVs since the material is not suitable for theatrical or television presentations.

Original Anime DVD

An Original Anime DVD (original animation DVD or OAD), is an OAV released on DVD as an extra with a volume of manga. This term entered popular usage in the summer of 2008 with the Goku Sayonara ZetsubÅ Sensei, xxxHOLiC: Shunmuki, and Tsubasa: Shunraiki projects. However ANN cannot confirm an earlier use before these projects.
