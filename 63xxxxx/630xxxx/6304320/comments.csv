For some reason the film didnt work with VLC so I am using Windows MP (after having downloaded a codec for MKV)."
,vanros,2011-04-11T21:48Z,Damn it !!! I hate it....You wait soooo long for this movie to be released with nice quality. And then when it finally comes its in russian. There are no bloody eng subtitles either for this movie anywhere !!
