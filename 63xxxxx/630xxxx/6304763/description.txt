Storyline:The film opens at a party in Los Angeles in March 1997. Christopher Wallace (Jamal Woolard) is seen sitting at his chair smoking. People, including Faith Evans (Antonique Smith) and Sean "Puffy" Combs (Derek Luke), move to the music on the dance floor. Moments later, Biggie, Combs, and friends are driving away from the party. They stop at a red light, while Lil' Cease (Marc John Jefferies) is flirting with women outside. A black Chevrolet Impala pulls up and someone inside fires a single shot at Biggie. The film then flashes back to Biggie's childhood in the early 1980s, recounting his tough upbringing in Brooklyn. Biggie (Christopher "CJ" Wallace, Jr.) writes several rap songs, enduring the ridicule of some classmates. Biggie then starts selling drugs at the height of the crack epidemic. In 1990, after winning an important rap battle, he meets Kimberly Jones (Naturi Naughton) for the first time. Kim is attracted to Biggie instantly and they later have sex in her apartment. However, Kim is afraid to start a new relationship because of a past relationship when she was abused. Biggie assures her that he won't break her heart and they begin dating (even though he is dating Jan also). Prior to this, Biggie's mother, Voletta (Angela Bassett), throws him out of the house after discovering his involvement with drugs and his getting-ready to be a father.
