,niknik1971,2011-04-07T02:34Z,Installed it. Rebooted my Mac. Mac ran like it was being dragged through treacle. Removed it. Rebooted. Mac back up to speed. Thanks for taking the time to seed though.

[V],polisdavid,2011-04-09T22:13Z,"Sorry niknik1971,

I actually had to look up the word treacle to figure out what you were talking about.

My GeekBench Score running it was
14692
Without it it was
14678

But I have a MacPro Dual Quad - so maybe it's only intended for computers with multiple processors.

Thanks for the info though..."
