WSE came up with Trojan:Win32/Meredrop after running, but doesn't seem to be a big deal or affect the activation."

Thank you so very much..

PLEASE Help..

I clicked ez-activator  button, it wizzed and popped then so very sadly it informed me of the following within the Information Console.

""Caould not access KMSEmulator path set in settings, using default installation path.
Failed to start c:\Windows\KMSEmulator.exe""

Should I have unpack your rar file to the c drive and windows directory?

I have also searched my HDD and can only find the KMSEmulator.exe file ref within settings.ini which is in the location where I extracted to.

I have found a new autoKMS folder and file with todays date, guess thats related to your tool kit.

The rearm option worked so has given me another 30days.

YOUR HELP and ADVISE would be GREATLY APPRECIATED.
