,Vvornth,2011-04-08T10:05Z,Thank you very much sceneline! :)
,kukki2,2011-04-08T23:48Z,"Scene comes as rars. Guy probably just mirrors releases. Advantage is only that you know ure getting the release intact and 100% working.

Good example is; there's movie named ""easy a"" floating in p2p network atm that's 1080p version is semibroken with a glitch at start. That might happen when someone has faulty HD. If it were in rars that wouldnt happen."
