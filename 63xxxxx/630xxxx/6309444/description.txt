Here is my copy of Phoenix BIOS Editor v2.2.1.3. I am a professional self employed PC technician, and one of my duties is BIOS bad flash recovery and editing, which includes modification, feature unlocks, and splash screen/boot up sound customizations. Many vendors like Dell and HP lock out many features and menus in their BIOS'es, but some are for good reason, and some are not, like Dell only allowing certain wireless cards, or Mitac blocking all but Panasonic DVD drives from their laptops, like the 8640 laptop I do a lot.

You should ONLY download this if you KNOW what you are DOING and are EXPERIENCED and CONFIDENT with BIOS coding and environments. Getting this wrong can ultimately leave you with a bricked laptop or desktop computer, because that is the worst that can happen, your computer will not even POST anymore. At he least you could muck up hardware detection and IRQ addressing, stuff like that.

If you brick your laptop or desktop, you'll have to remove or desolder your BIOS chip, and have it erased and reprogrammed in a Willem chip programmer by an engineer like me. It is also something I do a lot, putting right bad BIOS flashes, and it isn't cheap!

So, I'm not providing any instructions with this, just how to install it. Using it past that is up to the experts like me, you'll know what you're doing ;)

I DO NOT ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR MISUSE OF THIS PROGRAM, NOR AM I MAKING YOU USE IT, IT IS AT YOUR OWN RISK, I KNOW HOW TO USE IT TO IT'S FULL POTENTIAL!

And don't be asking me how to use it, because I won't tell ;) I have a conscience, and I won't sleep if someone bricks their PC because I told them how and they misunderstood :( 

Experts only!

INSTALLATION:

1. Install using Setup.exe

2. Overwrite the installed BCPDEFS.dat in the program folder with the one included. NOTE: Rename the old BCPDEFS.dat to BCPDEFS.dat.old so you have a backup for safety.

3. DONE! Enjoy! As always, like the rest of my torrents here at The Bay, no viruses, and 100% original!

4. Remember my advice above, and heed it well!
