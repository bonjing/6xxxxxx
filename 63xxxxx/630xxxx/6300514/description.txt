After spending six years with the genre-defying roots rock ensemble Drive-By Truckers, singer/guitarist Jason Isbell amicably left the group in 2007 to pursue a solo career. Isbell had already displayed his songwriting prowess during his tenure with the Truckers, and he funneled those talents into Sirens of the Ditch, a bluesy, punk-infused lesson in guitar tones and Southern swagger that marked his solo debut in summer 2007. Backed by a band dubbed the 400 Unit, Isbell took his songs on the road and soon began penning another album, which he recorded with the 400 Unit in 2008. Released the following year, Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit found the songwriter ruminating on issues of love, youth, and war.
