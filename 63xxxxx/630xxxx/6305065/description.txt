CLASSIC CORMAN 50'S SCIFI/HORROR 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049128/

â€œWhat you are about to see may never happenâ€¦ but in this anxious age in which 
we live it presents a fearsome warningâ€¦ Our story begins with The Endâ€¦â€

Originally released in the fifties during the atomic decade, Day The World Ended 
tells the story of what happened when man finally destroys himself in a nuclear 
holocaust. Only 7 people survive the blast including a rancher and his beautiful 
daughter, an arrogant thug and his striptease dancer girlfriend, a gold hunter and 
his donkey and a handsome geologist carrying a contaminated man. The fate of the 
human race lies in the hands of this unique crowd as they battle against the new 
mutated world.

This classic b-movie follows the survivors as tensions flare over the meagre rations and rancherâ€™s daughter, as the geologist and thug fight it out to carry on the human race with the stunning girl much to the disgust of her atomically altered fiancÃ© - the mutant monster. Who is watching the girls bathe? Will the rancher get his wish to shoot the thug? Will they all survive? Will the contaminated man get the meat, the red, raw, meat he desires? Find out in Day The World Ended!

Day The World Ended is directed by Roger Corman the â€˜King of the drive-in movieâ€™ who had a firm belief that â€œthe monster should always be bigger than the leading lady.â€
