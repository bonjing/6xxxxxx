,terrentius1,2011-05-12T18:04Z,"No video for me, either on my PC or on my media box player.  Strange.  I got sound, but no video."
,terrentius1,2011-05-12T18:59Z,I also tired with Philadelphia.  I have no idea what codex you are using because I have no video with that file either.  Too bad cause you got some sweet uploads.
,ddbn,2011-05-16T07:49Z,"Hey YIFY . . . Seriously man, your uploads are absolutely the very best out there.  Period.  The quality is amazing and the small sizes are almost unbelievable.

But . . . I think that there is something seriously flawed with this particular upload of Red October.

I have downloaded it three different times, on three different 'puters, and have attempted to play it on six different machines all running different OS's.  

It plays fine in the VLC player and in the FinalMediaPlayer but will not play at all in the DIVX player or in Windows Media Player.  On one of my machines, it totally locks up Windows 7 if I just single click on the name of the file in Windows Explorer.

All of your other MKV files play without fail on all of my machines except this one particular file.

What am I missing?"
,kolokythis,2011-07-25T13:11Z,Amazing quality for such a small size. Thank you for this.
,OscarTheSlouch,2011-09-17T06:38Z,"DOWNLOADERS NOTE: This file (and several others by the same uploader) contain a video stream that some hardware players cannot play. (The audio stream works fine.) Software-based players (like VLC) seem unaffected by the problem and work fine. If you plan to use a hardware-based player, test it before you spend a lot of time downloading!"
,khoekerd,2011-10-05T17:04Z,"Hey YIFY,

can you tell me what the first 30 seconds say? After the paramount titles the words are unclear. Until :it then sank in deep water at 00:32"
,Wave_rider,2011-11-23T21:42Z,"decent quality for the size. 

This sub works perfect for russian speaking parts. This Sub is ONLY for non-english speaking parts.

Enjoy. A/V: 10/8"
,coholica,2012-02-23T02:41Z,Try GOM player www.gomlab.com and also install the k-lite mega codec pack. GOM will play virtually any type of video as long as you have the codec and K-Lite installs quite a few.
,michaelrwatson,2012-04-14T11:28Z,"@YIFY, you fuckwad: 1280 is too high a resolution.

Better to shoot for 720x304, and MKV sucks too. Try MP4... you'll live longer. Thanx."
