,ak47killa14,2011-04-08T10:55Z,"I will comment when I finish downloading the movie as well, but yes, the screens do look good so I am sure it will be fine. Most cams are really good this year, they all look really good and are full screen on my 20 inch monitor, it's awesome. "
,iTzOwnerV2,2011-04-08T11:02Z,"V: 7 Watchable Cant see some of the words, too close to the big screen.
A: 7 People like to move around.

M will come when i finish watching it."
,iTzOwnerV2,2011-04-08T11:03Z,Also has a flicker in the light sometimes.
,iTzOwnerV2,2011-04-08T11:06Z,Voices are also about 5-7 seconds late.
,ust2,2011-04-08T11:19Z," Do yourself a favour and wait, because this is supposedly the first movie that is actually scary in years.

  Only dled the samples, quality is expected but there seems to be a lot of people talking, laughing, making smart ass remarks, more than what is acceptable and that will just completely ruin a potientally really scary movie.."
,iTzOwnerV2,2011-04-08T12:59Z,"M:8 

The acting was kind of poor, and its too dark to get scared, I heard eveybody in this cam scream but I just couldnt see anything. I would wait until a better copy comes out.

And the Lipsync was only bad when I was playing this on my xbox, I played it on WMP when I was fed up and Lipsync was perfect."
,ak47killa14,2011-04-08T13:20Z,"Not bad quality I guess, it's watchable. "
,ak47killa14,2011-04-08T13:22Z,Not bad quality but would wait until a better copy comes out or watch it in theaters. 
,ImHereButMyMindsGone,2011-04-09T03:37Z,"Couldn't sit through this one myself the quality was really bad. I've seen worse, but not much worse. I've actually heard good things about the movie, so im waiting for a better copy to come out to watch it fully. Cam is too close, cuts out half the screen, picture quality is pretty bad. It's pretty dark. This is in no way bitching, i'm not going to bitch about anything I don't got to pay for, I'm just giving a heads up.

,martincorleone66,2011-04-11T19:25Z,"same copy as all the rest, i saw this in movie theatre, its missing the very end which is the best part, dont waste your time, yeah the movies decent, but its missing the end, so its worthless. its like getting all excited to meet that super model online and when she shows up, shes really 5""2 and 180 lbs... theyll say.. ""your getting it for free dont complain"" this is the excuse by all the uploaders putting garbage, same video uploaded by 10 different  people, makes sense to me?????"

,billyboy999,2011-04-13T01:24Z,"Man just switched off 1/2 way through...If I was in that cinema I woulda shouted STFU then went to the usher to get my money back..Ive never heard people be that loud in a theatre before.Talking screaming ,whistling.It was bad..Is thats what its like in American or Canadian movie theatres cause the accents were N.American?????"
,shanoova,2011-04-20T08:03Z,"A/V  Maybe 4?   For the most part you can hear some dumb ass next to the camera who cant shut up,  Its extremely dark and for probably 3/4 of the movie you cant make things out. All in all even that being said the movies worth a one time watch, but that about it."
,gracyjoy143,2011-04-21T08:33Z,i will see first if this one is good :)
,Arachne,2011-04-22T01:56Z,"Although the movie sucked, thanks for putting it out here and doing the best you could with what you had.  Peace out."

,Erhlatino,2011-04-23T02:08Z,Why hasn't the DVDRip been uploaded yet it's been on epidemz for 2 days. But it is the russian copy. Can someone replace the audio with the cam audio?
,Erhlatino,2011-04-23T16:35Z,"Nevermind my last comment, I see that it has been uploaded today."
