,BvvM,2011-04-11T14:08Z,"That BvvM Review: Hobo with a Shotgun [2011] by Jason Eisener
-------------------------------------------------------------

Having mellowed somewhat from his Halcyon Days molesting hitchers, Rudi Hobo [for it is He!] now seeks nothing more in life than a tranquil retirement and the dream of blowing some venture capital, as he ambles into a typical township in the heart of decaying imperialist 'Murika. But that was before a series of graphic interludes conspired to entwine his destiny with that of Abbey [anagram of Buffy], a barely legal pre-school teacher recently fired in the government cuts. Their joint struggle becomes more than the sum of its parts as a rough-and-ready reckoning begins.

TL;DR Executive Summary

plot ........ - 10/10 - powerful, highly original
writing ..... - 10/10 - brilliant, cult material every second line
acting ...... -  9/10 - consistent quality, extras need an energy snack before shoots 
sound ....... -  6/10 - better in this rip but begs to be remastered, pls hire a boom-pole next time
lighting .... -  8/10 - great, fake colour so heavy it suspends disbelief solo
effects ..... - 10/10 - top-notch and CGI-free
score ....... -  9/10 - fine-tuned and on-the-money
--------------------------------------------------------------------
overall ..... -  88%
recommend ... A movie with 'Instant Classic' stamped on each frame; 
............. so snag it, kick back and inhale one hell of a ride; 
............. then, if you can, shuffle some equitable JewGold to 
............. the Director for a future fix.

There's truly something for everyone in this delicious romping flick - film buffs will thrill to finally learn what 'The Abbyss' director James Cameron *wanted* Bud to say to that drowned actress who represents his frigid wife - there's lashings of retro style and gameshows to placate the Pig Brother generation - abundant imagery to clast the iconos of Christianic upnailment fetishists [Jesus wept at one juncture] - with many's a bone tossed to S+M aficionados, who will scream along an hormonal roller-coaster as they cream their jocks over and again - for techno-nerds, heart-stomping confrontations with the coolest Cyborgs since Vader died - one-liners Clint could kill for - for malcontents, the raw zeal of Revolution - even PaedoBear and Vegans get their kicks - only hypocrites will hate it, as they take a remorseless pan in the face - toto summarium, it's a welcome blast of searing fresh air which blows the stench of Hollywood's propaganda-padded 'BlockBustards' to sub-atomic particles.

On a personal note, I congratulate and thank you, Mr Eisener (+ cast and crew), for this fine work and pledge to swift 20 Shekels to keep the ungodly inspiration lubed up ~ here's wishing every success in your future career "";0))

NB: My use of the word JewGold above is entirely ironic and does not indicate the religion of anyone, merely the prejudice of some; nor do I care about or check on such affiliation, unless it is the subject of the film under review.


PS: Big props to Heist for posting this perfect encode of top-quality material.
A - 10/10
V - 10/10"

Anyhow, to overtone his poor taste, here's an interesting interview with the director and protagonist, at Sundance in Jan 2011:

,The77s,2011-04-17T23:15Z,"This movie doesn't suck, but it also doesn't deserve the scores it has been getting.

It really isn't as good as everyone is saying, but, if you come into it not expecting much, you should be pleased."
,wishUluck,2011-04-20T00:14Z,"Heh, I'd trade it any time with something like:
""Mofo with a shotgun"", lol!"
,phrozenstare,2011-06-29T18:46Z,thanks
,joaoandrew,2011-07-09T16:31Z,Watched it with MKPlayer and it didn't play fluidly ... it kept on stopping and the image isn't really that satisfying for a 1080p.
