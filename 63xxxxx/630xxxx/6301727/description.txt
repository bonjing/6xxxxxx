The soundtrack album to the 1980 movie "The Blues Brothers" is one of the greatest soundtrack albums ever made. Like the original musical comedy film that inspired it, the music from beginning to end is a whole ton of fun. The Blues Brothers themselves - Dan Aykroyd & John Belushi as Jake & Elwood Blues - and their ace, eight-man backup band sound positively smokin' on such numbers as the cruisin' She Caught The Katy, the rockin' version of Gimme Some Lovin', the infectious Everybody Needs Somebody To Love, the jammin' Sweet Home Chicago, and the old Elvis Presley classic Jailhouse Rock. They also do a hilarious take on The Theme From Rawhide, and the band serve up a terrific version of the Peter Gunn Theme. And who can say no to the album's all-star guest list: Ray Charles' soulful rave-up Shake A Tail Feather, James Brown masterfully leading the congregation through the gospel classic The Old Landmark, Aretha Franklin's excellent re-recording of her old hit Think, and Cab Calloway leading the live audience with his signature big band song, Minnie The Moocher. The Blues Brothers movie soundtrack is a classic.
