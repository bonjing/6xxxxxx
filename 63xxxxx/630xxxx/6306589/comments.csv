,Sofware(3),2011-04-17T23:36Z,will i have to get trial version to use
,AndyRixon,2011-04-22T19:44Z,"No, as I have included a Keygen and Activate to unlock of versions :D"
,jacsonss,2011-04-23T18:58Z,"The keygen says this is not a valid Win32 program. Is there a valid keygen for 32bit!
Thanks..."
,biggyPirate,2011-04-24T01:56Z,"Can I use this software while connected to internet?

Thanx"
,ramrod28677,2011-04-28T18:52Z,Keygen won't run. Explorer shows it's 0Kb
,AndyRixon,2011-05-03T23:51Z,"@jacsonss: Yes it is a valid 32 bit application as I used it to install on my computer (Wins XP MCE 05 32bit).

@biggyPirate: Yes you can.

@ramrod28677: Hmm, works fine for me, try downloading again, if you still find issues with the keygen, search around here."
,AndyRixon,2011-05-05T11:39Z,"Please seed this torrent, its gone down from 170 seeders to under 130, come on people, be greatful."
,zHasTEz,2011-05-10T16:37Z,"Hey thanks 4 uploading
Btw, I have some questions.
When using the activator, must I edit some host files or something (like GR420's)????"
,AndyRixon,2011-05-12T13:37Z,"@TreskTheKing Odd, works fine for me :s

@zHasTEz No, the activator does it all for you."
,hendrix_ghost,2011-05-13T16:24Z,"Already had a working keygen, but the activator that comes with this torrent worked great."
,liberationofsharing,2011-05-15T12:03Z,"Dont worry Ill seed the fuck out of this, if it works. Im also planning to put up several torrents concerning how to for the various products. Its a little thank you for all the great seeders out there. Thanks andy"
,AndyRixon,2011-05-15T16:22Z,@liberationofsharing Thank you and your welcome :D
,liberationofsharing,2011-05-15T23:08Z,"Andy I had the same issue with the key gen. I ran it on my desktop and it failed. I then ran it on my older dell laptop running windows xp and it said the same thing. Other than downloading the torrent again, what other solution is there. I am in the process of doing that now. "
,liberationofsharing,2011-05-16T01:10Z,"Downloaded the file again and it has same issue. Thanks for the attempt but it doesn't seem to work, at least for me. "

,di573,2011-05-30T12:47Z,when I try to use de universal keygen it says that it isn't a valid win32 application
,brickedmeat123,2011-06-12T09:30Z,"Hmm... seems to be a very nice collection, not complete, but this thing MUST be working. I have a (very) slow internet and there's a bandwidth meter in my hands, so DON'T DISAPPOINT ME!

BTW, does this works in x86 (32bit) ?"
,AndyRixon,2011-06-16T14:18Z,"If you are having trouble with the keygen I have provided, try this one.
