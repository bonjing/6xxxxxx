,erroneus,2011-04-10T22:28Z,Awesome torrent.  Any chance of doing the same for Season 1 and Season 2?
,Predator-X,2011-04-11T01:03Z,"If you're speaking about Web-DL versions, no, just Season 3.
If you're speaking about HD 720p, Season 1 and 2 are already uploaded, just not by Me."
,CakeMonster,2011-04-18T10:22Z,"Season 1 and 2 in hd have been uploaded by me :)

And season 1 is in 1080p

Season 2 has a few 1080p episodes but most are 720


Season 1

Season 2

And it was nice of Predator-X to upload Season 3, it saves me the trouble :)"
,dsorc,2011-04-20T21:01Z,"Lame.
All these episodes are cropped to 16:9 (original aspect ratio - OAR - of the show is 2.35:1)

Fail Cartoon Network.

Maybe someone will make an OAR 720p torrent, the files are out there (bia)."
