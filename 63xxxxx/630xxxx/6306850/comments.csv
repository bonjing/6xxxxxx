,aldbmw,2012-03-23T05:47Z,"Okay so I fallowed the Instructions: Extract with 7-Zip, convert resulting .hfs file to ISO with MagicISO, then burned to dvd with magicburn. So heres my questions I only see one file thats hfs. should i be also converting the other 3 files to that are not hfs? If thats my problem then i now know that i should burn all the files to the dvd. Or after i convert the single hfs file to Iso should i burn all the files including the new iso file to dvd? Sorry just a little confused as to why its not working!"
