Tomboy is the upcoming fourth solo album by Animal Collective member Noah Lennox (stage name Panda Bear). According to his website, Tomboy was slated for release "near the end of 2010"[5] but the album release was delayed until 2011. Lennox has mentioned Tomboy will be a departure from his signature sound on Person Pitch and Animal Collective's Merriweather Post Pavilion. About the new direction, Lennox said: "I got tired of the severe parameters of using samplers. Thinking about Nirvana and The White Stripes got me into the idea of doing something with a heavy focus on guitar and rhythm."[5] The album was released in full on April 4th, streaming online,[6] and leaked online on April 5th.
