           'Stubborn As A Mule!' is an eye opening depiction of           
           lesser known historical facts and contemporary commentary      
           regarding the call for reparations for African-Americans.

           Sherman's March to the Sea, President Lincoln's                
           assassination, the end of the Civil War, and the               
           unraveling of the promises of Reconstruction, 'Stubborn        
           As A Mule!' sorts fact from fiction and cast the

           debate in a new light! Dr. Cornel West leads this
