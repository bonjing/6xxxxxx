This game looks awesome and I just got a killer graphics machine, so I'd love to test it out on this game. "
,karapiratu,2011-04-10T01:18Z,"Amazing, thank you so much, works perfectly. And I do mean perfectly! I have an old quad core (Q6600 @ 2.4 GHZ) with 4GB Ram and a GTX275. Not a bad setup but I expected the game to run much worse. Maybe because of the Il-2 Flaming Ciffs fiasco. With all details maxed at 1920x1200 (no AA) it runs smooth only dropping below 20 fps (but still above 15) near the ground at high speeds. So it's still perfectly playable. 

As for the game itself, most realistic sim I've flown yet. Even with a Saitek CyborgX (very cheap stick) the plane is a joy to fly. This has to be the first ever sim I've managed to refuel in flight without soiling my pants. It's hard of course but the movement feedback you get with camera shake and HUD response is simply amazing. There might be imperfections down the road (cannot collide with trees...) but this is a 100% score sim. 

The devs shouldn't even have bothered with copy protection, although it's quite harmless. Simmers will buy this just because ED, although alone on the PC hardcore sim market never rests on its laurels. And they deserve praise for that. This is a sim that will take months to learn, years to perfect, and the cost of the game is about 10% of the cost of a rudder+stick setup. I can't wait to find the box version (I never buy digital). The only problem is that now I have to spend 500+ euros on pedals and the Thrustmaster Warthog monster Hotas (not required but... wtf...)

Oh, in case you were wondering, 5 years from now, when we'll all have virtual helmets, this sim will probably the first title I'll try. "

turn off your internet, run keygen, paste serial, register other, HWid will show in the box under your serial in the register field, copy your HWID from under your serial and put it into your keygen box ""HWID"" then press gen key and paste your key into the last field of the register box, you should now have all 3 box's filled, press register and bingo :0)

The keygen and the game is work fine! Everything is OK! But! I have a problem with this game. I have a random crashes, when i select any menu in the game, like: Training, Mission Editor etc. An example, for understanding: When i select any training mission, the game is loading it, but the progressbar is freeze at 90%, and nothing happens. I press CTRL+ALT+DEL, sometimes give an error message, sometimes not, but the app is crashed, or freezed. 

The crashes like (messages): ""Can't create effect error"", and any idiot runtime errors.

The VGA driver is up to date, directx is installed, the latest c++ runtime library is installed. The patches are installed: (1.1.0.6 and the 1.1.0.7)

On 1.1.0.7, if A-10C hangs when starting a mission, go to the Options Menu, to the ""System"" Tab, disable ""HDR"" and set ""MSAA"" to ""4x"" max (or even ""0"").
If stuttering occurs ingame, set ""Visib Range"" to ""Medium"". Additionally you can set ""Shadows"" to ""Medium"" or even ""Low"" (who needs ""High"" shadows up in the air anyways ;) ), and on the ""Gameplay"" Tab disable ""Mirrors"".

So if you have your antivirus warning you about keygen finish the full downL then install setup.exe and then turn off you antivirus do the keygen once done turn it back on. 100% OK
Now also my system aint great and i have all the settings on high and its smooth as fuk.
