   Idiocracy (2006)
  
  Private Joe Bauers, the definition of "average American", is 
  selected by the Pentagon to be the guinea pig for a top-secret 
  hibernation program. Forgotten, he awakes 500 years in the future. 
  He discovers a society so incredibly dumbed-down that he's easily 
  the most intelligent person alive.
