I had struggled to get this movie from the pirate bay and when I did I went through hell trying to get subs hardcoded into the file since the only copy I found was a MKV format. I personally use nero for burning and nero doesn't play nice with subtitles so now that I spent the better part of two days getting everything burnable I figured I should share it.

I take no credit for the original film, subtitle files, or for the original torrent. I do however take credit for hard coding the subs into a single downloadable/burnable file for easy use.

I am a long time member first time uploader to the pirate bay since I have never had anything worth sharing before. I hope everyone is pleased with this torrent and that I will build trust in the p2p community.

This file is large and has been converted several times but still held great visual quality, You will not be disappointed! Plus it fits on one DVD when burned with nero!


I do not condone copyright infringement without just cause so if you like it BUY IT!

Happy Seeding!
