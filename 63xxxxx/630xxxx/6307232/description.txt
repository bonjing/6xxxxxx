Bill Maher: I'm Swiss

(2005) NR
 
Controversial comic Bill Maher -- former firebrand host of the popular panel show "Politically Incorrect" -- pushes buttons once again in this 2005 stand-up performance, taking swings at George W. Bush, Arnold Schwarzenegger, rap lyrics and more. Embarrassed by the state of American politics (and harboring a secret desire to be Swiss), the outspoken comedian skewers the system -- including marijuana laws and gay marriage -- with acerbic zeal.
