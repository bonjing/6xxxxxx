,adam0142,2011-08-30T02:35Z,"Yeah, it is a grainy show intentionally. Compare MAFIAA's screenshots with this image taken directly from the Bly-ray Source:

,kornchild2002,2011-10-01T15:52Z,"Why do people complain about grain?  Do they want characters to look like plastic dolls?  Almost every live action movie out there has some level of grain which only adds to the realism.  Even titles such as Thor, which looked awesome, had a small level of grain.  People need to pull their heads out of their asses and realize that grain isn't always the enemy.  Just be thankful you have an HDTV/monitor that can properly show the grain off."
,DarthPS3,2011-10-19T03:13Z,Pixels the size of my fist in these files.
,DarthPS3,2011-10-19T03:14Z,"As in, yes the show is supposed to be filmed grainy, but there is something wrong with this upload, giant pixels is not graininess. "

,fillinthisspace,2012-06-03T16:35Z,"I'll be looking for a 720p version which hasn't been encoded using ""FASM"". Based on the screenshots it seems to make things look worse, like the grain has been sharpened rather than removed and the picture no longer looks natural.
There's nothing wrong with a bit of grain anyway."
