              Marina, 23, is growing up with her architect    
              father in a prototype factory town by the sea.  
              Finding the human species strange and repellent,
              she keeps her distance. Instead she stubbornly  
              observes it through the songs of Suicide, the   
              mammal documentaries of Sir David Attenborough, 
              and the sex-ed lessons she receives from her    
              only friend, Bella. A stranger comes to town    
              and challenges her to a foosball duel, on her   
              own table.Her father meanwhile ritualistically  
              prepares for his exit from the 20th century,    
              which he considers to be "overrated." Caught    
              between the two men and her collaborator Bella, 
              Marina investigates the wondrous mystery of the 
              human fauna.

              The film was nominated for the Golden Lion at   
              the 67th Venice International Film Festival and 
              Ariane Labed won the Coppa Volpi for the Best   
              actress. Director of the film, Athina Rachel    
              was behind the production of "Dogtooth" (the    
              greek film which was nomimated for the Best     
              Foreign Film" this year in Oscars) along with   
              Yorgos Lanthimos, who is also producing and     
              playing the engineer in Attenberg.              
              In speaking with the best actress winner Ariane 
              Labed in Attenberg, Tarantino said the film by  
              Athina Rachel Tsangari grew on us the most,     
              and showed another Greece.

              Real Proper Notes:Our first release was slightly
              overcropped and GRXViD propered us. Although no.
              real grp propers for 1-2 pixels, that happens   
              when you are a scene newbie. Oh well, its fine. 
              Unfortunately for them, their release has Bad AR
              Calculating AR % error: (Original AR - Release  
              AR)/Original AR x 100 , and in this case the    
              original movie AR is 1,85 while their rip is    
              1,773 which leads to a 4,16% AR error, and acco-
              rding to tdx rules "Video encodes must be withi 
              4% of the original aspect ratio.". So next time 
              you want to proper someone,  make it right or   
              dont even try it. Enjoy the real proper release 
              PS. Same thing applies to Show.Bitch.2010.PROPER
              .DVDrip.XviD-GRXViD which has also the same     
              issues with the Aspect Ratio, but we won't bo-  
              ther to REAL PROPER GRXviD's idiotic propers    
              again.
