Notes:

 - Already here ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4335055/Gentleman__s_Agreement.mp4 ) but this torrent has been dead for months if not years
 
 - Another one for the "I can't believe it isn't already here" file; won Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actress for 1947 (also had five more nominations)

 - To use the subtitles, if necessary, simply extract the .SUB file from the .RAR archive into the same folder. A free app. that will extract .RAR archives is 7-Zip from http://www.7-zip.org/
 
 - I seed using "Initial Seeding" which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for up to several days until there are enough other seeds.

 - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) Small-scale torrents of hard-to-find large files such as rare movies are more vulnerable to dying if everyone doesn't seed to 100% or higher. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.
