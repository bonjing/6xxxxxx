How to Download, Install and Activate Kaspersky Internet Security 2012 beta-version?

To start testing KIS 2012 beta, download the beta-build from  
http://devbuilds.kaspersky-labs.com/devbuilds/KIS2012/
The folder with beta-version looks like 12.0.0.
You should download distributive of the kis12.0.0.*en.exe kind 
(usually the one with the highest number at the end).
During installation you will have to activate the product with 
the trial option and you will get 90 days trial version.
Once a new beta-version is released you will have to update your installation.
To do that download the last built distributive, exit the antivirus and uninstall 
previous build with the standard way (via Add/Remove programs). 
Then you may start installing the new build repeating the steps above.
