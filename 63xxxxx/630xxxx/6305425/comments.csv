,wayneking,2011-04-10T02:20Z,"Who are these foolish trolls that assume RAR files are fake?  Learn to use Google (or the support forum on this very site) and then after you've actually found out how to extract the .rar files and watch the movie (using winrar, which is available for free from rarlab dot com/download.htm), apologise to this uploader for accusing him of being what you are!  Assholes!

Thanks for the UL, as always .BONE.  Top fucking man!!!"
