         In spring 2010, the nearly unpronounceable volcano            
         Eyjafjallajkull spewed ash clouds across Europe, bringing     
         international air traffic to a standstill. Now, for the       
         first time ever, a team of explorers descend into the         
         nearby Thrinukagigur volcano crater - the only place          
         on earth where it is possible to enter an old magma           
         chamber. Inside the crater, the team finds crucial evidence   
          revealing the inner workings of Icelandic volcanoes.
