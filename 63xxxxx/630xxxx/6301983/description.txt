God, Iâ€™ve been waiting FOUR YEARS for that scene. The light smile, the tug on the T-Shirtâ€¦ Hauuu~

If youâ€™re asking about why thereâ€™s a picture of Nagato up and not Kyonko, please answer a logical question. Kyonko disappeared, so why would you expect her to be in a blog pic?

Anyways, we took most lines straight from the novel and edited some of the less sensible ones. Oh, and the movie is 2 hours 40 minutes long, not the usual 1 hour 20 â€“ 1 hour 40.

Kuzu edit: Let me clarify this a little. The lines that are taken from the novel are from the English adaptation of the novel, not the original. The script of the movie (included in the limited edition release) is referenced for the parts that are not in the novel.
