,jj423,2011-04-08T18:16Z,can this be played from an external hdd??
,Xedecimal,2011-04-10T21:01Z,The whole point of ripping the movies is so you can fit it on a smaller drive
,jj423,2011-04-13T06:28Z,"i dont give a shit what the point is....bitch. i asked a relivent question, if you dont have the answer, the SHUT THE FUCK UP!"
,Xedecimal,2011-04-16T01:54Z,"Wow, you are not the brightest being are you? The point is the answer, that it was to be fit on a ""smaller drive"" thus it would work on a ""drive"" of any type... Your friends probably get embarrassed bringing you to parties huh ?"
,jj423,2011-04-17T17:26Z,"that doesnt even make sense dumbass...i asked a question, all i expect 'yes or no' so shut your fuckin mouth bitch...and i dont go to parties, i throw them..."
,Xedecimal,2011-04-18T05:37Z,"I'm sure it doesn't make sense, to you. I'm sure this doesn't either. I never opened my mouth and if you're throwing a party, you're at one right? Riiiight? So you must be the last stop possible when everything else is closed down."
,david070682,2011-04-18T11:45Z,wiso kann ich die datei nicht auf FAT32 kopieren
,jj423,2011-04-19T16:17Z,"you'll never know bitch, cuz i donty invite fags...so sux to be you, either way why are you even on here? obviously you have nothing to contribute, and are just trolling peoples shit talkin trash, why dont you do everyone here a favor and get off mommies computer.... its pieces of shit like you that give our community a bad name.."
,david070682,2011-04-20T09:06Z,I can not copy the iso file on FAT32
,Xedecimal,2011-04-24T20:08Z,"@jj423
You don't invite them, they just always seem to show up huh? I've really got no reason to be on here but to make you look like an idiot over and over again. And I believe you contributed a question and I contributed an answer, that makes me +1 and you -1. What are you contributing? I'll just ignore your other weak insults, maybe you'll have something more entertaining next time.

@david070682
This isn't an ISO. These files look like the contents of what you would ftp over to your console in some kind of multiman loader games directory or the such.

@jj423
Now I'm +2 and you're still -1 haha."
,jj423,2011-04-24T21:29Z,"everytime you say something, it doesnt make sense, your +2? is that your fuckin IQ? you cant be up any when you dont answer anyones question right!! fuckin homo, like i said before, its people like that give our community a bad name.. talk all the shit you want, your fuckin stupid and you know it.."
,Xedecimal,2011-04-26T04:51Z,"It's that time again! Checking the torrent to find that I've got another message! By +2 I mean I've helped two people, you've not only not helped anyone but you've asked for help, thus making you -1. I believe I'm improving the community by offering assistance, while you're just asking for help and debating my sexuality. So who's the one with the lower intelligence ?"
,dayv25,2011-04-27T21:28Z,"Hey jj423, you do throw good parties. I came in your mouth remember?"
,AAndiba,2011-04-29T14:20Z,"Xedecimal:

Some games are known to not work well off an external drive, so using an internal is preferred. Killzone 3 is one of them, so in this sense, your answer isn't actually relevant, though it's understandable. That said, I think people have found a way to get it working on an external drive now. "
,ps3mosh,2011-05-29T14:55Z,"gent's I'm new to this so please be gentle.

I'm on 3.55 running off regaro manager 7.9a. Using a external HDD too.
As the HDD is FAT formatted I think I need to split the 9.1gb file to multi files ("
,maxdesolate,2011-06-26T19:59Z,@PS3MOSH. downlaod open spillter. google it. run it. then it wil split the files automatically. just choose the folder in which the big file is. and it will do it for you. then copy it to an external drive( must be formatted to fat32). then run lv patcher or whatever yo uhave. then open regaro and copy it to internal.
,maxdesolate,2011-06-26T20:00Z,"@ps3mosh.ah, its already formatted huh. im not seeing so well these days.lol. msg me at maxdesolate ( yahoo messenger) , if you need any help."
,ps3mosh,2011-08-20T16:59Z,"got Multiman, installed Lv Patch v9, it can see the game on ext drive but when loading it shows 1st couple of screens about PS3Move then I just get black screen. Please help"
