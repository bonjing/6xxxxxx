My Original Driver CD that came with my ASUS v7700 GeForce 2 deluxe. This is the one with 3d Glasses (VR-100) and a capture port (s-video in). There's of course also a s-video out. I upload this because the latest driver on asus website doesn't work with the glasses. I know the capture port could work but that's less than easy with the driver they give. I prefer this one a lot and many of you are probably looking for it if you lose your CD so here it is.
