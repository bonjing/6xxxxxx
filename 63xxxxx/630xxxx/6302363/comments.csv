[V],Horrorspoke,2011-04-07T21:14Z,I'd guess the CD but whatever it's from will no doubt be in the .nfo. I didn't take note...
,fryman180,2011-04-08T22:49Z,this cd got to my work yesterday so I'd hope this download is CD quality. I would upload it myself but I need to keep my job lol
,Mattress117,2011-04-09T01:58Z,"Epic quality, the real deal, the album itself is immense as well.  Major props to the uploader. 320kbps"
[V],Horrorspoke,2011-04-12T08:07Z,No probs guys - Its because i was late uploading it. But i felt i should as the others were rather low quality :)
,MODERNdayHIPPIE,2011-04-12T12:38Z,"Your The Man Horrorspoke, I've Been Using This Site For Over A Year And a Half Now And I've Only Just Signed Up To The Bay. Could You Please Upload A CD Called.... 'Financial Times' By Blade Brown? I've Been Looking Everywhere For It, It's On Itunes. If You Upload This....... I Will Pledge My Alligence To The Man Upstairs For Life!!! Jokes Aside..... You Would Make A Guy From London A Very Happy Bunny, Peace!"
