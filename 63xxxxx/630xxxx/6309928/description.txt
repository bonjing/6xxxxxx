Although Played Out offers indeed an almost complete repetition of the songs from his former albums Normal For Bridgwater (without e!) and Ends Of The Earth, with the exception of the lovely new and poignant I Want You, the songs are all acoustic, with Peter himself playing guitar, and James Walbourne playing guitar, piano, mandolin, and adding vocals. These arrangements highlight Peter's nice husky voice, and these songs being presented in this way certainly adds an extra to his work so far. I am an admirer of Peter Bruntnell, and I also very much like his more 'rocky' songs which are beautiful noise to my ears, but for a quiet evening I definitely prefer this wonderful album.
