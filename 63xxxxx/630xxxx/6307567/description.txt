Description:
How do you move monstrous mammals, enormous elephants, restless 
rhinos, hefty horses and speedy sharks?  You call in the services of 
the big movers.  These larger than life characters are working with 
the ultimate delivery deadline - their cargo must arrive on time, 
intact....and alive. Follow specialist teams of animal movers, vets and 
transport engineers as they attempt to relocate animals across the 
globe by air and road in new episodes of Animal Mega Moves.

Sharks
The Dubai Aquarium has offered to take two silvertip sharks from 
Cairns Marine in Queensland, Australia, but there's just one catch: 
somehow, they need to be moved. What follows is an epic 6,000 mile 
journey by air and road - something never before attempted for 
silvertips. Follow experts in their efforts to establish the world's first 
captive breeding population of these striking sharks.
