thanks dude

@StyLishSaLH
all izz well :)"
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-04-10T10:29Z,"Yeah, I've suggested many of our friends pluto's encodes of The Godfather. they are just brilliant like the movie, in fact the third part is underrated, it's nice one too.

@knight 
I've earlier encoded 'Patiala House', 'Dhobi Ghat' etc, all of them are not good. So I skipped them. This is a nice movie, sorry for not listening to you friends :(
Also
I've encoded this movie in my friends lappy, So time is not wasted :). I've completed 'No Country For Old Man'(330MB) and Martyrs (hoosh)...

@ apocalyto
thx man, it's nice that you people are working along with me, else I would've encoded similar movies, thx everyone. "

I've a very limited internet usage. I'm downloading a 4GB+ source & starts encoding, then came to know that someone has done it already :(
pls make sure, it's ur time is getting wasted, I dont see many of the requested movies. pls dont take me wrong. 
No offence to deff or gunnersrock. It's not good to upload the torrents already in small size. I dont want their effort get wasted. They are also spending much time to get the movies in this size. pls make sure, for all of you. Sorry if hurt anyone. have a nice day friends :)"

of all of them.."
,banukaknight,2011-04-11T17:29Z,"@StyLishSaLH 
well we do understand....
talking of gunnersrock.. looking at his page.. what we see is that he has faced too many hit & runners...
almost every torrent are on low number of seeders.
(so for the downloaders...> ""care enough to think about others guys?"")

request from you.. is try to upload the movies that are in ""NEXT list"" of yours....  so we'd know what's coming.. (except it's an urgent NEW release 
one thing about deffjam.. is that he accepts everyone's requests right away...
so we'll never know what's coming..
but i'm quite sure this ""Yeh Saali Zindigi"" case... won't bother him much..
as you both are having same amount of seeders at the moment for this movie...

well let's just make sure that won't happen again..

and for those who make requests....
try to use the facebook page - request poll
and search it here for other torrents.. before making the request....
and help each other.. finding what they seek...

we will rock you :)"
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-04-11T18:41Z,"That's good Knight. I'll try to do them soon. No country... is uploading....not completed yet, fallen asleep, lol"

Keep upload Hindi movies also."
,kulkakari,2011-04-16T07:09Z,Thank you for this upload. Good quality in such a small size is wonderful.
