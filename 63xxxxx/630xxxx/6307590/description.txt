OK Gang, sadly there is no way to export Video from OtsAV DJ software, though now Karaoke and Audio files can be exported in there original formats I guess exporting professional promo only videos in MPEG or VOB was a step to far for the recording industry hi...

Not to worry as you can download the free OtsAV DJ 30 day trial to view the enclosed KAOMA original hit video, Lo Lo and Pitbull are standard MPEG2 and the best quality you can get here.  OtsAV DJ is a very small and compact bit of software and once you done you can delete it, or better still find a way to export all my ots video's to MPEG and then you will have some great torrents from me tee hee..
 
http://www.otslabs.com is the web site if you would like to view the original Kaoma video.  It is worth it trust me as it caused quite a stink back in 1989 when it was first issued.   The Jennifer Lopez & Pitbull - On The Floor track leans heavy on the original hit so here you have all 3.  Enjoy and keep on rockin' and seed till it hurts.  Thank YOU!

Jennifer Lopez & Pitbull - On The Floor [Video] (UK Promo Only release)  MPEG2 format

Kaoma - Lambada MP3 Audio 320kbps Stereo Audio track

Kaoma - Lambada [Video] Ots format HQ Video 4:3 colour (requires the free OtsAV DJ 30 day trial software to play it back on your PC but that is where 'On the Floor' was born... way back in 1989

Note the Torrent downloaded from Demonoid is not correct but I have to include that text file to upload the torrent on there tracker as well as the Pirate Bay.  It is a semi private torrent site.  So now you know.
