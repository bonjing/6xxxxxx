Awake & Aware - Volume 2E
=========================

A conglomeration of several political activist documentaries together on one "movie" DVD. This is an attempt at packing the biggest "punch" in one DVD title. I call the DVD's, "Awake & Aware" after a similarly titled conference in LA September 2009. Enjoy and please spread around :)

P.S. a few mentionables in the DVD:

Back to Chernobyl (documentary)
Inside Chernobyl's Sarcophagus (documentary)
The Battle of Chernobyl (documentary)
Surviving Disaster - Chernobyl (movie/dramatization)
