You know how those Dutch uploads don't bother to tell you whether it's PAL or NTSC, how they strip out anything they don't want as if the downloader wasn't capable of doing it herself, and how they assume you know so much about the little thing they uploaded that you don't need to look up anything?

Well, don't do that."
