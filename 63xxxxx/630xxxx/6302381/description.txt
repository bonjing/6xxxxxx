MindOS 2nd Edition

Why is it called â€œMindOS?â€

Because it is the only complete system of psychology that lays out the inner workings of both womenâ€™s minds (and your own) in an entirely VISUAL, DIAGRAM-based format.

Just like your computer needs an â€œoperating systemâ€ to work, MindOS has the same â€œpoint and clickâ€ appearance, use, and practicality for solving problems that your computer screen does. Only this time, the computer is your mind, and the problems are the stresses and challenges of a manâ€™s life.

The Equation is That SELF-ESTEEM = WELL-BEING + CONFIDENCE

In the MindOS material you are about to encounter, you are going to learn just how to use that equation to literally create the kind of energy your mind (and life) runs on: self-esteem. It is that simple phrase we all use every day but never had a system for understanding.

Self-esteem.

And the Anger and Anxiety Maps inside the MindOS DVDs show you precisely how to build it any time you want. It is the same as having a detailed blueprint for building your own inner psychology with â€œnuclear â€œ- level power.
