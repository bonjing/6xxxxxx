steps i did
1) download torrent
2) open the main folder ""AUTODESK.SKETCHBOOK.DESIGNER.V2012
.MULTI-ISO""
3) right click to open ""asbd2012.r00""
4) select ""asbd2012.iso"" and extract to a location
5) right click ""asbd2012.iso"" to open with ""WinRAR archiver"" 
6) double click the ""setup.exe"" (instalation starts automatically after completion of process)
7) finish the installation
8) Disable Your network , pull the network cable out or block with firewall (this is just to disable online serial check)
9) restart Autodesk and click ""register button""
10) Use as Serial 666-69696969, 667-98989898, 400-45454545 .. or anything matching those templates
11) Use as Product Key  741D1, click next.
     Now you are at ""activation screen""
12) check the ""I have an activation code from Autodesk"" radio button (hold here)
13) now right click the ""asbd2012.iso"" to open with ""WinRAR"" again for XFORCE keygen.  Select ""Crack"" folder, extract to a location. 
14) in that crack folder right click ""xf-a2012-64bits.rar"" or ""xf-a2012-32bits.rar"" (according to ur os) right click to extract to a location.
15) right click the ""xf-adesk2012x64.exe"" or ""xf-adesk2012x32.exe"" to run as administrator
16) note tat ur AUTODESK application must be at activation screen(where I paused). Click on ""Mem Patch"" (you should see successfully patched) press ""ok""
17) now copy ""request code"" from the activation screen and paste it in ""request"" field (in keygen) 
and press ""activate"" you will get activation code in the ""activation"" textbox copy tat code and paste it in the activation page and click next and your product is activated"
