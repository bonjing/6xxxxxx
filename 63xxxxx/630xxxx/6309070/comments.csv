,bwanasize10,2011-05-18T15:31Z,"I'm a bit slow as a newby, took me 9 and a half hours to download on my poor connection, but I have totally failed to extract and write to a workable DVD after completion.   I could see 61 folders (r00 to r61) and a rar folder.  Each folder showed a 3.1GB iso file and a crack folder, but I tried to extract the iso to dvd and it seemed to write, but nothing on the completed dvd's

What am I missing ?  apart from slowly tearing out what is left of my hair :("

,Karlston,2011-06-03T09:55Z,"@bwanasize10 -  install winRAR, open the .rar file with winRAR, extract the contents, open the extracted .iso file with your DVD burning program and burn the DVD. Don't just burn the iso file to DVD, that just creates a DVD with a single .iso file on it, the .iso file must be burnt as an image, and opening the .iso file with a burning program works best."
,kpelton,2011-06-10T04:03Z,"If someone could email me with directions on how to burn this to a disc and what i do with the crack files that would be very helpful. im not really sure on what to burn to the the disc. krispelton@gmail.com

,Waste_Land_Savage,2012-05-05T09:38Z,"I hope that this torrent will be the one that works for me.
I have a legal version of Home Premium but got fed up with it when I had to redo my computer and it would no longer upgrade to sp1, I am no stranger to TPB I've gotten plenty of programs from this torrent community and am most grateful to all.
But after my copy wouldn't upgrade to sp1 I started on my quest to find a good dwnld of Win 7, all that I've dwnld have worked but one wouldn't allow me to read an article on some websites the script was all scrambled.
The latest copy works Great but it installs with the Win Classic Theme with ""NO WAY"" of switching to any other themes and let's face it Classic ""SUCKS""
So I'mk hoping that Aero will be activated in this copy and actually work.
I'll be sure to let you know.
One question though.
Instead of using the trial extender all the time.
Why not just use an Activator Instead?"
