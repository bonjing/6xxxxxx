IMF agent Ethan Hunt has been sent on a mission to retrieve and destroy the 
supply of a genetically created disease called 'Chimera'. His mission is 
made impossible due to the fact that he is not the only person after samples 
of the disease. He must also contest with a gang of international terrorists 
headed by a turned bad former IMF agent who has already managed to steal the 
cure called 'Bellerophon' and now need 'Chimera' to complete their grand plan 
of infecting the whole world. In order to infiltrate and locate the terrorist 
group he relies on the help of an international thief Nyah of whom he quickly 
develops a love interest. Time is not only running out for Agent Hunt to find 
and destroy 'Chimera' before the terrorists get their hands on it, but he must 
also find 'Bellerophon' so as to save his love interest who has already become 
infected by the disease from a terrible and rapid death.
