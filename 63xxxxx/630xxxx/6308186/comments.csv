,Nico7as,2011-09-02T20:28Z,"Hi Chris,

Is there the French version included?
Can I get a ""french language pack"" somewhere?

or...Could you post the International version? :-)
that'd be really great. I can only find Revit Architecture in french on the interweb.

,jardila15,2012-02-27T17:35Z,"Hi, It failed at the installation.
It accepted the serial and product key.
\When I clicked ""install"" it pops a window of Windows Installer and when you OK it, the installation fails. 
What should I do?

Thanks"

Thanks"

What I did to make it work: (Im not sure which factors were crucial for not crashing)

1. Deselect installation of revit design review
2. Under the revit main installation you have an expanding arrow, click it and deselect the service pack.
3. I also installed the Uk content"
