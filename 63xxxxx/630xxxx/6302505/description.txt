Reservoir engineers benefit from a good understanding of reservoir simulation. While most engineers rely on commercial software packages for the calculations, it can be impossible to evaluate the validity of results without a solid foundation in the underlying principles. This textbook provides comprehensive coverage of simulation. It begins with the fundamentals of numerical simulation, moving to field applications and more complex topics. Each chapter includes a project section that relates to the implementation of the topics discussed in that chapter. Includes 157 solved examples and 178 exercises.
