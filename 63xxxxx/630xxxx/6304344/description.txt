In his quest for distinctive American folk music, Alan Lomax brought the songs of Burl Ives, Woody Guthrie, Muddy Waters and Leadbelly to a larger audience, and itâ€™s no exaggeration to suggest that without Lomaxâ€™ contribution there wouldâ€™ve been no 1960â€™s folk music revival, no Bob Dylan and a radically different pop music landscape in the world today. With Alan Lomax: The Man Who Recorded the World, author John Szwed illuminates the life and work of the titular folklorist, musicologist, author, archivist and promoter.
Szwed fully immerses readers in Lomaxâ€™ world as he travels from his Texas birthplace, through the rural South during The Great Depression and up to New Yorkâ€™s bohemian scene in the 1960â€™s. Along the way, Szwed maps out Lomaxâ€™s inspired, unusual career, composing the definitive volume on the man and his work.
