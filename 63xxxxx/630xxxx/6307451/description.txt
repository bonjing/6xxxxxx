Written for the new campaigner and the experienced communicator alike, this is a comprehensive and systematic exploration of what works in campaigning, and a practical how-to guide for using principles and strategy in campaigning as a new form of public politics.

Applicable to any issue, the book's 100 key steps and tools provide models of motivation, analysis, and communication structure.

Content includes: how to begin a campaign; motivating people; research and development, including issue mapping; planning using the campaign planning star; organizing communications including visual language; constructing campaign propositions; insight into news media; how to keep a campaign going; how to use old and new media and what to do and what not to do.

The final chapter reviews the bigger picture, including why campaigns need brands, and examines how campaigns became a form of politics and provides new research material on how issues mature and become 'norms', and the consequent problems for campaigning.
