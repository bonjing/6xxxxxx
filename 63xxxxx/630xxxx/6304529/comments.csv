im really picky when it comes to both video and audio. this release is WATCHABLE.

this is not wide format, but more like 4:3.
having that said, the quality of the video is
pretty good.

as for the audio, i dont really thing its that bad
at all. actually its pretty good. not like an R5 or something.. the audio seems to be like a DVD quality. a decent release. i havent watched the entire movie yet, but i just had to make an input, as i see certain people claim that the audio is somewhat weak. its not.. video is good, audio is good.. go ahead, download it peeps, good movie.. and a decent realease, all in all. :)"
,arctangent,2011-04-09T17:06Z,Video stops at about 8 minute mark for me. Anyone else has issues?

,randyluck,2011-04-10T01:46Z,Pretty darn slow DL. I'm topping out around 170 kb/s - normally do about 1.5 MB/s.
,randyluck,2011-04-10T01:48Z,Correction: Got up to 373 - holding steady around 320 kb/s. Still not fast for 8000 seeds.

,longbeachdivers,2011-04-10T05:21Z,Would really appreciate some info with regard to the story line. Nice to have the comments on quality instead of all the hundreds of Thankyou's ( Thankyou again uploader) would just like to know if any film would be my sort of movie before i download.
,mooe1965,2011-04-10T09:02Z,"Video quality isn't very good for a 1.2GB download.

Picture is a bit grainy, with some blocky distortion, and it's formatted for old fashioned TV. Not widescreen. Audio isn't good, but it's listenable and watchable. 

A5 V6 out of 10"

I would be a fool to ever pay high retail prices at places like Walmart or Bestbuy again. I even sold a 37""  HDTV to my boss for $600 that I only paid $78.24 for. I use  SnagBids.com"

,-Cortex-,2011-04-23T15:29Z,"I genuinely feel sorry for uploaders like IwannaFan...

1) This encode was not created by IWF2, it was encoded by IFLIX, as you can *clearly* see from the title.
2) If you actually researched what a PPVRiP was, you'd find that the source is normal VHS. Pure and simple, that's the reason the resolution is low. Because VHS is low-res, the image is cropped to retain as much detail as possible, hence why it's 4:3. I'll repeat for those of you suffering with mental retardation, it was *not* cropped by the encoder, the source was already 4:3.

Retarded people just shouldn't be allowed to comment."
,-Cortex-,2011-04-23T15:32Z,"""Video quality isn't very good for a 1.2GB download.""

Size != quality. The source and bitrate denotes it. 1550kbps is more than enough for 480p, the issue is the source being VHS. Never assume that large size = good quality."
