I think those sites could be associated with the MPAA. I would advise no one visit those sites. Just my feeling."

,catamaranman,2011-04-08T18:32Z,"I agree with ""asaiza2000"".  MPAA no doubt trying to captialize on the ""Axxo"" name.  Axxodude, please pass on to your superiors that they are definitely a dollar short but way more than a day late."

I wouldn't even waste the time to download this... The camera cuts off most of the screen, and it is incredibly dark. Don't bother to download this copy... Find a different one."

,LEERV,2011-04-12T15:21Z,It wouldn't be so bad but for the COCK with the camera talking all the way through the movie. WHAT A TWAT.
