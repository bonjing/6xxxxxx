         The black mamba is Africa's deadliest snake. Untreated,       
         its bite has a fatality rate of 100 percent, making it a      
         killer among killers on a continent where it is thought       
         that nearly 20,000 people die of snake bites each year,       
         and the residents of Swaziland in southern Africa have        
         suffered losses for generations. With essentially no          
         access to anti-venom, many people turn to traditional         
         healers for help, but their herbal remedies always fail,      
         leaving Swazis feeling fearful and defenseless against        
          one of their nation's most infamous killers.
