Happiness Is a Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown is a Peanuts television movie that was released in 2011. The special is the 45th in the series and the first without the late Bill Melendez on the production team. It is also the first special without the involvement of Lee Mendelson Productions nor Bill Melendez Productions (it is unknown though if Lee Mendelson will also be working on this special).[1] The DVD was released on March 29, 2011.[2]

It was announced by one of the hosts at the 2010, 84th annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade when a Snoopy balloon (in his flying ace outfit) passed by. As quoted: "Snoopy fans will be happy to know that next year, a new Peanuts animation will be flying your way."[3]

The teleplay for the new Peanuts special was written by Pearls Before Swine creator Stephan Pastis, though it is unknown if he based it on previous strips, as all the Peanuts specials after Schulz's death are. After the death of Bill Melendez, the voices of Snoopy and Woodstock were provided by director Andy Beall.
