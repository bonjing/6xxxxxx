Storyline:Two Turkish anti-terrorist agents are sent to New York City on a mission to find and bring back 
                          the dangerous Islamic leader codenamed "Dajjal", believed to be hiding in there. Working with the FBI and NYPD, the
                          agents orchestrate the arrest of Hadji Gumus, a well-respected Muslim scholar and family man who years before fled 
                          to the United States after being released from a Turkish prison, where he served time for murder. This tale love, 
                          friendship, peace and prejudices, takes us on a journey seeking to answer the question of whether innocence or guilt
                           even matters to one who lusts for vengeance.
