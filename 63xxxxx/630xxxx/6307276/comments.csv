,Teakuno,2011-04-10T00:37Z,Is this not free from the Apple dev site?
,btckfc,2011-04-10T03:12Z,"No it is not free.
v3.x is free, but v4.x is not.

Even if it was, is it wrong to share free stuff?

Thank you uploader for this, been waiting for a torrent. I hate those RS, MU, FS links on other sites."
,SimpleSim0n,2011-04-10T04:29Z,btckfc Why do you hate download links that come faster than this torrent. Are you too stupid to use  jdownloader?
,btckfc,2011-04-10T20:24Z,"@SimpleSim0n
torrent has always been faster.
most of those upload links don have resume support, even some with jdownloader.
and with torrent i can peer sync, i can have multiple computers with multiple lines downloading different parts, sync and share the parts they have, i can copy to another computer and resume there. basically with torrent i can just leave it there, upload links are so troublesome."
