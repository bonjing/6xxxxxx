I just renamed the file by ajouting hotfix 11.4a at the end to avoid too much confusion

these drivers support XP both version only !
Since I don't have tested them yet,in this way i cannot tell you if they are fully whql certified from MS Lab so.
Untouched version and beware,absolutely not modded.just a bit renamed ,nothing's more...
This is an updated version of previous drivers i have already posted here few times ago if i'm not wrong so.
This new version is dated from April 5.
Called as catalyst 11.4a hotfix for several HD 6000 products only.
See up more for more details.

Enjoy and have fun
