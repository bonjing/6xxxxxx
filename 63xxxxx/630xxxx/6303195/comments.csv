,Kamianbu,2011-04-09T17:00Z,why upload these on a torrent? simply go to newvegasnexus for any mods.
,thegodoflions,2011-08-26T18:56Z,"because as far as i know this is the only way to get the banned Halo Armor MOD in the net.
all other ways to DL it are either fake or has been removed by assholes."
,Orlastheace,2011-09-03T17:04Z,how do I install?
,linkinpark187,2011-09-10T21:00Z,Any way that I might able to get someone to seed this a bit faster?
,alewis21,2011-09-20T16:58Z,Great work on this torrent. @kamianbu - I really prefer to download this bundle and have hundreds of mods downloading in the background than spend several hours getting them from NV nexus where downloading one file is lots of hassle.
