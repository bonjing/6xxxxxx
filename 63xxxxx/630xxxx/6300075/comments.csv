,lvansen,2011-04-17T09:41Z,"I get Segmentation Fault, regardless if I run the patching program ""modifica.pl"" or not.

I have put the .mlm file and one Navteq map ""country/country.pak"" in /home/user/MyDocs/Maps.

I also put the Drive and Res directories there too.  Also tried with them in /opt/sygic.

No change whatsoever, still getting SegFault.

Obviously there is something that's not right and I suspect this program does not properly catch errors."
