The Twilight Singers
Dynamite Steps (2011)



Although launched as a side project during Greg Dulli's time with the Afghan Whigs, the Twilight Singers became Dulli's main band after the Whigs broke up in 2001. Dulli formed the group in 1997, while the Afghan Whigs were busy extracting themselves from a contract with their third label, Elektra. Enlisting a group of musicians -- including Harold Chichester of Howlin' Maggie, Shawn Smith of Brad, the Screaming Trees' Barrett Martin, and a group of New Orleans session players -- Dulli recorded a concept album entitled Twilight as Played by the Twilight Singers. By the time the album was finished, though, the Whigs had signed to Columbia Records, whose executives thought it best to issue a new Whigs album before any solo effort.
