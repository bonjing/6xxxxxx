         On the grassy Kenya savannah beneath the snowy peak of        
         Mount Kilimanjaro, filmmaker Martyn Colbeck has filmed        
         and photographed elephants for nearly 20 years. He            
         patiently earned the trust of a matriarch named Echo and      
         her offspring and, with that trust, privileged glimpses       
         into the most intimate moments of their lives. Colbeck        
         has captured nothing less than a stirring family saga         
         spanning generations, including poignant births and deaths,   
         carefree play and ferocious fights, reluctant partings        
         and joyous reunions - even every mother's worst nightmare,    
          the kidnapping of her baby.
