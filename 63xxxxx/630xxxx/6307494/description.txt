"The melding of the Abercrombie trio with John Surman is amzing.
The music has the dark feeling of the coming winter, the aura of
the north wind outside the door. It is smooth and warm, though,
like the warmth indoors in November, with the bass clarinet and
tenor sax of Surman playing off the guitar of Abercrombie and the
bass of Johnson. It is a recording that takes some getting used
to, then it becomes one to go back to again and again".
