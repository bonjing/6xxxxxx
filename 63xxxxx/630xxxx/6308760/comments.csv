I am really new to making torrents, and I stuffed up the first one. If you want to do a virus scan or whatever, go ahead and do so. If you don't want to download it, then don't, I am not forcing you to. It is a program that I thought was good and was not on this site, so I uploaded it. "
,evilcracker,2011-04-10T16:54Z,"I uploaded a second version because the first didn't work. I already said that. If you try download the first, it doesn't work because there is no file and I made a mistake with it. If it was a virus, it would have infected my computer considering the fact that that is where I am uploading it from."
,evilcracker,2011-04-10T17:25Z,"If any of you have trouble, just let me know."
,evilcracker,2011-04-10T17:27Z,"@steevo-be-thy-name
The reason they were different file size is because one was compressed and this one isn't. If I had compressed this version, then the website would have given me an error saying the torrent already exists, and I wouldn't have been able to upload the torrent. Like I said, if you don't want to download it, then don't."

Are you seeding???"
[V],bigbluesea,2011-04-10T18:23Z,"Downloaded and installed.

App is clean,virus free and working.

@steevo-be-thy-name

Your ''Quick Guide to Spotting Fakes''has been appearing on new torrents.WHY???DO YOU WORK FOR SOME ANTI-PIRACY GROUP

The majority of TPB users know how to go about preventing an infection on their computers when downloading files.

It seems to me you are trying to scare people off.evilcracker went out of his way to explain himself,yet you still keep trying to discredit him.

Give new uploaders the benifit of doubt until proven otherwise.

FYI i've downloaded infected files from ''Skull'' uploaders.So ''your guide'' is,just that ''your guide''

Go get a girlfriend,job,new porn mag or something to occupy your time.

@evilcracker 
Thanks for the upload."
[V],bigbluesea,2011-04-10T23:41Z,"@steevo-be-thy-name

Ok,fine

I just though it was kind of unfair of you to try and discredit a new uploader without first checking the  app to confirm if it is in fact a bad torrent,which by the way it wasn't."
[V],bigbluesea,2011-04-10T23:43Z,"@steevo-be thy-name

Ok

take care"
[V],bigbluesea,2011-04-11T02:17Z,"@steevo-be-thy-name

sorry for the smart ass remarks

Take care

,ragman420,2011-04-18T05:50Z,"Some jackasses just like to run their mouths when they don't know what they're talking about.  This doesn't look suspicious at all, but if you don't trust a file just run it sandboxed first and until you know first hand a file is infected keep your dumb ass comments to yourself."
,ragman420,2011-04-18T05:52Z,Will this work with Skype?
,ragman420,2011-04-18T06:08Z,"Great upload evilcracker.  Works perfect, no bugs, and it does work with Skype and many other programs besides online gaming.  Thanks!"
