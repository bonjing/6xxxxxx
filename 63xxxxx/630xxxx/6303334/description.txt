Training Day
(2001) R
 
Staying on the right side of the law will be more challenging than anything rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) has ever faced -- especially since Hoyt's partner (Denzel Washington) for the next 24 hours is meaner than L.A.'s meanest streets. In a powerful departure from his previous roles, Washington won an Academy Award for his performance as a charismatic detective who becomes the kind of thug he's supposed to collar.
