,soundtrekker,2011-04-14T13:48Z,"all 15 episodes have been uploaded one week ago and have been seeded by me for 7 days now for several hours each days. I can't possibly seed them all the time, so you may be dependent on other people to seed for you.

Feel free to ask me for seeding specific episodes, I will regularly check here for any requests."
