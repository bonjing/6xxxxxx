Say what you want about him, love or hate, I'm (nor any of you, are to judge..) but this guy and ALL he has don last year.isch.. have made me laugh out loud, its so darn fucking funny in so many different ways, like plain stupid, weird, out of context, strange behavior, etc, but the thing that is the bomb is all the quotes, or yeah afterward quotes, these ways he assembles his words to such strange things, and I stop here, cus you cant really describe it, eider you know or not, but still, over payed (compared to the situations in the world today , absolutely), but still this after 2 & 1/2 men stuff is totally WINNING!"
