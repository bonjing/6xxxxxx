,geenotreally,2011-04-10T12:49Z,"Thank you for uploading Formula1.2011.03.26.Australia.Qualifying.720p.HDTV.x264-hannibal http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6272699/ I am not very keen on the Speed coverage though. I really REALLY hope you can get BBC HD for future rounds of this wonderful championship. And yes, Star Sports sucks a**."
