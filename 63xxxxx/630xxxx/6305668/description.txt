Reason 1.0.1 is the first update to Reason, the virtual studio package from  Propellerhead Software.  This release is focused on perfecting the application before adding new features.

The  biggest  change in Reason 1.0.1 is the completely rewritten ASIO implementation  that will sort the large number of problems with ASIO drivers  in  Reason 1.0. The new ASIO implementation also features support for external WordClock and S/PDIF sync that wasn't available in Reason 1.0.

With the release of Reason 1.0.1 we will also release the ReFill Packer - a tool to create your own ReFill files with your own samples, loops patches etc.
