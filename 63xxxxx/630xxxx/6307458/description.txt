INTRODUCTION

Just what is amazing sex? There are hundreds, or maybe even thousands, of
different positions, settings, and stimuli that can all be amazing. But amazing sex
is more than just feeling good. Amazing sex is ultimately about what makes you
feel connected, sensual, and human. The most amazing sex is also sex that is done
responsibly, and often, lovingly.

Some people might think that they don't need a book to teach them how to have
sex. Although it's true that some aspects of sex acts are innate, when it comes to
having amazing sex, most people could use some fine-tuning. There is always
more to learn about sex. You learn about sex from having sex, but you also learn
about sex from sex education. This book is great sex education. There's a lot in
here, 416 pages worth of sexy info. You're sure to learn a thing or twoâ€¦or three
or four or more.

Besides just teaching you how to spice up your sex life, this book will also
explain the basics about sexuality. Many people never learned essential sex
information because they were too embarrassed to ask questions about sex. Some
people even think that talking about sex is a big no-no. They may prefer to keep
quiet about sex, unless they are telling a dirty joke, or talking about someone
else's sexual exploits (maybe their favorite politician's?). But the more you talk
about sex, and the more you read about sex, the better your sex life can become.
I have written this book so it will be fun and easy to learn from. It will help you
understand the basics, as well as grasp the more complex concepts about
sexuality.

This book is a refresher for old pros, a primer for beginners, a peep into
new worlds for the timid, and a jumping off spot for the adventurous. It delivers
many tantalizing bites for all of you who are hungry for even more in your sex
lifeâ€”all in a ready-to-roll, easy-to-use, hot-tip-filled format. Enjoy it and may it
make you a more amazing lover!
