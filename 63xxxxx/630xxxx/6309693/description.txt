Warcraft II: Battle.net Edition

In 1999, Blizzard published the Warcraft II: Battle.net Edition for Windows and Mac, which combined the original game (Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness) and the expansion pack (Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal).  It retained the Macintosh facilities and replaced the DOS version with a Windows version that included play by TCP/IP and provided Blizzard's online service, Battle.net, for multiplayer games.

Warcraft II Battle.net Edition is the continuation of the ruthless clash between the armies of the noble Humans and the brutish Orcs.  From the initial, unexpected invasion of the Orcish Horde to the quest of the Great Alliance to forever seal the Dark Portal that links their two worlds, you will experience the epic saga of the mighty battle to gain dominance over the kingdom of Azeroth.  Along the way you'll need to carefully manage your limited resources to successfully construct and rule your medieval empire while engaging in real-time tactical warfare over land, sea and air.

The Warcraft Series has sold over four million copies worldwide and has won numerous awards including multiple Game of the Year and Best Multiplayer Game honors.
