You did something wrong, maybe change something, game works just fine...  You can play offline and dedicated servers only..."
,tbest95,2011-04-10T23:04Z,yo can someone please post the process for FULL installation please and thx
,mare89pzs,2011-04-10T23:30Z,"@tbest95

put "".minecraft"" folder into Your ""Roaming"" folder. To access Roaming folder: Start-->run--> (type) %appdata% 

This is for Windows Users ..."
,matthew011029,2011-04-12T12:38Z,"@mare89pzs
is anything gonna happen if I don't? since i didn't but the game still runs fine, sp is fine at the least"
,mare89pzs,2011-04-12T15:35Z,"@matthew011029

its recomended to put .minecraft folder in Roaming, if You somehow started game outside that folder and click  ""force update"", I think that game will be instaled in Roaming, but You will have deafult skin pack ... "

,F1nz0r,2011-04-14T20:01Z,Noob question again but how could i add another mod to this? i tired but minecraft just crashes after. Or is there some issue with the HD texture pack or somehting?
,mare89pzs,2011-04-16T00:54Z,"@F1nz0r

If You are using this version of minecraft You also need mods compatible to this version... 
Because of this HD texture pack ""minecraft.jar"" is now folder, so You just put mod files in that folder...
BTW, what mod You are traying to add?"

,F1nz0r,2011-04-16T11:09Z,"@mare89pzs
I checked and mineclony is infact not compartible with minecraft 1.4_01
only 1.3.
I guess ill wait for a version that is compatible or just get an older version of minecraft
But thanks for a great torrent!"
