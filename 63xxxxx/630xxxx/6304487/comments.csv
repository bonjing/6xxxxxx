If you like the way Alexander Sokurov experimented with film techniques and acting traditions then go for that! This is his brilliant surrealistic interpretation of Gustave FlaubertĂ˘âŹâ˘s famous novel  Madame Bovary.  The simple meaning of the power of human nature, the way you born and desire to fit social environment turning into fantastic and drama filmed by Russian genius in very fresh and eccentric manner."
