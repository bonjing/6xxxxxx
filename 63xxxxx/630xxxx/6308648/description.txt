   Till det som Ã¤r vackert (2010)
  
  Twenty-year-old Katharina doesn't have much of a life.  Her mother is an 
  alcoholic. Quite often she doesn't have enough money in the supermarket. 
  Her life would have no perspective whatsoever, if it wasn't for music. 
  Katharina heard Mozart for the first time on Youtube - and was immediately 
  fascinated by the emotional power of his music. One day she slips into the 
  Gothenburg concert hall during a rehearsal. As if in a long passage from dark 
  to light, she becomes immersed optically and acoustically in a totally 
  different and fascinating world. Are you here for the interview as a 
  receptionist, a woman asks her.
