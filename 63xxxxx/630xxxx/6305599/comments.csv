,Akki-88,2011-04-09T04:15Z,"Hey!
Can i play online !!!
Regards"
,NobleHackology,2011-04-09T04:46Z,"look you can go on the debug server for psn but it is risky but other than that no custom firmware lets you  go on psn but you can use your browser of coarse   but since this is privacy patched sony will not get all the info of any thing you do on your ps3 like  what tv you own  ,whats on your usb what you play and when ect..... "
,NobleHackology,2011-04-09T04:47Z,Of Course(error)
,NobleHackology,2011-04-09T06:26Z,actually dont go on the dev server thats where they test sht plus sony has a list of debug consoles you would be flagged 
,Pulse555,2011-04-09T14:10Z,"1st of all ive been playing all week online.
2nd'ly ive spoken to a few players and they ARE NOT DEVS.
for the last 5 nights online psn with rebug there has been over 500,000 players online.
now u say im on dev servers.
The reason devs dont want us on this exploit is cos they like to use a debug console to test homebrew or whatever an if sony patch things devs would be pissed, thats all."
,NobleHackology,2011-04-09T15:30Z,what ever man 
,NobleHackology,2011-04-09T15:34Z,no thank you just a nerd bitching about debug servers for debug consoles which sony knows  you have been on good luck hope they dont ban your console over the few games on there this is my last fcking upload i see its full of shit in here

:( So F''K'it man

But thnx 4 ur help man I appreciate'it .

,NobleHackology,2011-04-10T16:11Z,I knoww for a fact you can play on dev servers you have to change the envirement on the debug setting but its a nono you cant sign into reg psn but a dev. Version of psn which like i said before is a nono since theres only a fraction of users on those servers (easy to spot ) compared to reg psn This wont brick any thing only if you unplug while installing 
,Akki-88,2011-04-10T17:04Z,"U r a king nobleHackology ,
yes i can go online but the fact is ,
NOT really PSN Online , is like folks whos on a Rebug CFW to , but unfortunately sony can still bust me .
