Stunt GP for the PC is racing a game with a bit of a difference. It is the ultimate form of radio-controlled racing and you will be able to perform amazing stunts and high-speed racing all rolled into one. There are a host of wonderfully graphical and lifelike environments to race your cars in that bring the game to life and there are loads of ramps, loop the loops, fly-overs and other obstacles. The constant speed and great visuals make this game fun for all and immerse you into it. 

You can choose from sixteen vehicles all of which have different attributes so you can try them all as you play this game over a period of time. There are also 24 crazy and challenging tracks to race across all of which are great fun. In the game you will find varied modes that you can select from. There is an arcade, exhibition, championship and time trial mode and this keeps you interested to play the game for a while. Championship is the best mode if you want to compete against others over a championship season and pit your car against the best. 

Another great feature of this game is that you can customise your vehicles with a huge number of different combinations to push your car to the limits of its speed or perform more amazing stunts. 

You can challenge your friends to head to head action on vertical or horizontal split-screen racing. 

All in all this is a great racing game that will keep you interested and replaying it as you can perform more and better stunts and improve.

Mount, install and enjoy :D
