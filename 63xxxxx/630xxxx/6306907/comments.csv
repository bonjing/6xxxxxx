Currently the only way to recieve Digital Terestrial transmissions in the UK through a PC is with a DVB-T1 tuner card which have been available for some years now for recieving freeview broadcasts. Unfortunately in their infinate wisdom, The powers that be have decided that to broadcast HD transmissions of BBC One, ITV etc will be on the new format of DVB-T2!, we currently have digital recievers which use this method including Freesat HD Boxes, or Built in Freesat HD into HD TV's. The other way is to use a Sky HD+ digibox or Virginmedia's HD box to watch HD channels. This means that at the momnet there is NO WAY to recieve the HD channels through freesat on a PC as there are not any readily available DVB-T2 tuner cards on the market without outlaying a seriously overpriced Blackgold PCI Tuner DVB-T2 card (which is currently the only one there is!). The main manufacturer's make USB & PCI cards easily available to recieve HD content through DVB-T1 which is apparent for the rest of the world EXCEPT the UK. As we have adopted this new DVB-T2 format, they are obviously reluctant to start making and masss producing these cards until there is a sufficient market. So basically I have no way of uploading any HD formats for F1 coverage as at the moment, it just isnt possible.

Hooking up a Sky HD Digibox can still only really be done through S-Video,Component or Composite connections which is still less than SD quality. Removing the HDD drive from the Sky box only results in being able to transfer recordings ONLY as the raw uncompressed format of HD is stored in a way that cant be read by a PC without a DVB-S cards and a Conditional Access CAM, which this can run into over ĂÂŁ1000!. Not an option.

Be assured when DVB-T2 cards are more available, I will be pruchasing one and I will start uploading the F1 coverage in Beautiful HD quality, but until then im afriad were stuck the SD. Your probably looking at 2012 as a minimum before we see these DVB-T2 cards at an acceptable price."
