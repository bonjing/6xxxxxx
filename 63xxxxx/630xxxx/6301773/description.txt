Meddle is the sixth studio album by English progressive rock group Pink Floyd. It was released in October 1971.

The album was recorded at a series of locations around London, including Abbey Road Studios. 
With no material to work with and no clear idea of the album's direction, the band devised 
a series of novel experiments which eventually inspired the album's signature track, "Echoes". 
Although many of the group's later albums would be unified by a central theme with lyrics 
written mainly by Roger Waters, Meddle was a group effort with lyrical contributions from each member..

The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by English progressive rock group 
Pink Floyd, and was released in March 1973. The concept album  built on ideas explored 
by the band in their live shows and earlier recordings, but it lacks the extended instrumental 
excursions that characterised their work following the departure in 1968 of founding member, 
principal composer, and lyricist Syd Barrett. The Dark Side of the Moon's themes include 
conflict, greed, the passage of time and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by 
Barrett's deteriorating mental state.

Wish You Were Here is the ninth studio album by English progressive rock group Pink Floyd, 
released in September 1975. Inspired by material they composed while performing across 
Europe, it was recorded over numerous sessions at London's Abbey Road Studios. 
The album explores themes of absence, the music business, and former band-mate Syd Barrett's 
mental decline. Early sessions were a difficult and arduous process but it was Roger Waters' 
idea to split the centrepiece track "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" in two, and join each half 
with three new compositions. "Shine On" was a tribute to Barrett, who, coincidentally, 
made an impromptu visit to the studio while it was being recorded. The band failed 
initially to recognise Barrett, who had gained weight and changed in appearance.

Animals is the tenth studio album by English progressive rock group Pink Floyd, and was 
released in January 1977. A concept album, it provides a scathing critique of the social~political 
conditions of 1970s Britain, and presents a marked change in musical style from their earlier work. 
Animals was recorded at the band's studio, Britannia Row, in London, but its production 
was punctuated by the early signs of discord that several years later would culminate in 
keyboardist Richard Wright leaving the band. The album's cover image, a pig floating between 
two chimneys on Battersea Power Station, was designed by bassist and writer Roger Waters, 
and produced by long-time collaborator Hipgnosis.

A Momentary Lapse of Reason is the thirteenth studio album by English progressive rock 
group Pink Floyd. It was released in the UK and US in September 1987. In 1985 guitarist 
David Gilmour  began to assemble a group of musicians to work on his third solo album. 
At the end of 1986 he changed his mind, and decided that the new material would instead 
be included in a new Pink Floyd album. Subsequently Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason and 
keyboardist Richard Wright  (who had left the group in 1979) were brought on board for 
the project. Although for legal reasons Wright could not be re-admitted to the band, 
he and Mason helped Gilmour craft what would become the first Pink Floyd album since the 
departure of lyricist and bass guitarist Roger Waters in December 1985.

Fortieth anniversary edition

A two-disc fortieth anniversary edition was released on 4 September 2007, and a three-disc set 
was released on 11 September 2007. The packaging, designed by Storm Thorgerson, resembles a 
cloth-covered book, along with a twelve page reproduction of a Syd Barrett notebook. 
Discs one and two contain the full 'Piper' album in the original mono mix (disc one), 
as well as the alternate stereo version (disc two). Both have been newly 
remastered by James Guthrie.

The third disc includes several Piper-era outtakes from the Abbey Road vaults, 
along with the band's first three mono singles. Unreleased material includes a 
shorter take of "Interstellar Overdrive" that was previously thought lost, the 
pre-overdubbed abridged mix of "Interstellar Overdrive" previously only available 
on an EP in France, an alternative mix of "Matilda Mother" as it appeared early in 
the sessions, and also the 1967 stereo mix of "Apples and Oranges," which features 
extra untrimmed material at the beginning and end

It was originally released in January 1970 and is composed of songs from various artists. 
A 1997 re-release includes four bonus tracks each from Jerry Garcia and Pink Floyd that 
were used in the film, but not the original soundtrack. Jim Morrison of the Doors wrote 
the track "L'America" for the film, but was rejected by Antonioni ("L'America" was later 
released on the Doors album L.A. Woman). A Rolling Stones track, "You Got the Silver", 
is featured in the film but not present on this album.

Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980â€“81 is an album released by Pink Floyd in 2000. 
It is a live rendition of The Wall, produced and engineered by James Guthrie, with tracks 
selected from the August 1980 and June 1981 performances at Earls Court in London. The album 
was first released in The Netherlands by EMI Records  on 23 March 2000, who released a 
limited edition in the United Kingdom on 27 March. The general release followed on 18 April 2000, 
with US and Canadian distribution by Columbia Records.

The shows actually involved the construction of a wall on stage, throughout the first half 
of the show. Once it was finished, members of the band performed in small openings in the wall, 
atop the wall, in front of the wall, or even behind the wall.

The album artwork featured the life-masks of the four members of Pink Floyd at the time in 
front of a black Wall, which were worn by the "surrogate band" during the song "In the Flesh?".

Pulse (stylized as pÂ·uÂ·lÂ·sÂ·e) is a live double album by Pink Floyd, released through EMI Records 
on 29 May 1995 in the United Kingdom and by Columbia Records on 6 June 1995 in the United States, 
containing songs from their albums.

The album was recorded during the band's Division Bell tour in 1994, specifically the UK and 
European leg, which ran from July to October 1994 (See Pink Floyd live performances). 
The tour was sponsored in Europe by Volkswagen, which also issued a commemorative version of 
its top-selling car, the Golf Pink Floyd, one of which was given as a prize at each concert. 
It was a standard Golf with Pink Floyd decals and a premium stereo, although it had Volkswagen's 
most environmentally friendly engine, at Gilmour's insistence.[2] The special version, 
that could have been released in 1996, on June 2, was cancelled....
