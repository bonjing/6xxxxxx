There is nothing wrong with the video use a good player
Everybody say's VLC player
But everybody use sphlash lite player just google it it's free.

@ILPruny
Thanxs great quality."

You can get a free version of it, and you never have to worry about updates in order to play certain file types. It also takes next to no ram to run, so you can play a game that is very demanding of your computer, and listen to music without your game glitching or lagging."
