The Black Cat was Universal Filmâ€™s second excursion of the 1930s into the works of Edgar 
Allan Poe. Like Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932) and the later The Raven (1935), the link 
between Poeâ€™s work and the end film is minimal â€“ indeed here only Werdegast's irrational 
fear of cats links the film with the story of its title. Originally to have been much stronger 
in its violent themes, test-audience outrage meant reshoots were in order and a number of 
changes were made to the final picture.

The story boasts a solid opening 45 minutes of intrigue and character build-up - from the 
moment we meet Lugosi's Werdegast it is as though the characters have entered a nightmare 
(a theme that was sadly not exploited in this film), the introduction of Poelzig only further 
compounds the mystery as both men act courteously yet threateningly to each other. The two 
play a game of chess over Joan, with Poelzig determined to keep her in his house if he should 
win - sadly though this game is never really shown in any detail and could have provided a lot 
of tension. The film really starts to take a downturn when the local police arrive to investigate 
the bus crash, their comedy relief destroying the eerie, isolated atmosphere that the film had 
boasted up to the point. In the last twenty minutes the pace picks up rapidly, much to the 
detriment of the film - suddenly there is a Satanic ritual and just as quickly it ends for 
no reason; Joan bumps into Werdegast's daughter and suddenly she is dead, for no obvious reason. 
The ending comes as a real cop-out considering the tension built up and the comic-relief epilogue 
just breaks the camel's back.

On the plus side, direction is decent and the set designs are outstanding. Although the build-up 
suggests that Poelzig will be living in a gothic castle, he in fact inhabits an ultra-modern (1930s) 
house with sliding metal doors and large windows. This helps to keep the film away from the normal 
horror clichÃ©s and gives it an interesing new edge. Although the camerawork is quite standard for 
the most part, there are a few standout scenes. In one, the camera moves along a corridor around 
the house as Karloff continues to talk in the background - while Poelzig's introductions, first in 
silhouette and then coming through a door that he does not seem to open (see: The Mummy (1932)), 
look very impressive. The music is a standard Universal affair, with the usual hints of Bach's 
Toccata and Fugue in D Minor on the organ.

Karloff and Lugosi are together on screen for the first time and they don't disappoint. Both actors 
seem to be trying to outdo each other with creepy voices and look very impressive when switching from 
threatening each other to being hospitable to Peter when he bumbles into scene. David Manners, as 
Peter, gives a typically meek performance although one well suited to the role.

The Black Cat is the start of a very good film but sadly suffers from a rushed and confused finalÃ©. 
For fans of Karloff and Lugosi who enjoy their distinctive style, this film is a dream come true and 
finds them both at the peak of their acting prowess. Recommended to fans of the duo, or of Universal 
Horror pictures - this one of their best entries outside of the well-known monster pictures.
