,morlhack,2011-04-30T02:38Z,"The ""The Alternative Edition"" means the 189 min version, aka special edition, on wikipedia you can find it the followings: The 189-minute ""Alan Smithee"" version was released in 1989.
so it's the  disowned version, there is a cover, and a txt file thet explains the details."
,Idakus74,2011-05-12T00:23Z,Is this the 189min. version? Is this in 5.1 that would awsome. I've been looking for the extended edition in Highres 5.1 for awhile now. Anyway I'll let you guys know how this is after I finish it.
,Ajube0476,2012-03-26T20:14Z,This is NOT the 190 min. Special Edition.  It is a 183 min. horrible fan edit. And is total garbage. Don't waste your time with this.
