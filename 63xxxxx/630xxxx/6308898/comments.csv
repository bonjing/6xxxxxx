,RMJ13,2011-04-10T19:54Z,Method 3 BUY A BETTER VIDEO CARD that can handle the game!
,xidio,2011-04-10T22:20Z,This isnt a 'tweak' RMJ.
,petr0vi4,2011-04-11T00:02Z,RMJ13 you don't know shit about the game. In Crysis 2 textures are 256x256 and in Crysis 1 they were 512x512 because fucking consoles can't handle hi res textures. So just stfu.
,Dallebulle,2011-04-11T02:39Z,"RMJ, HI res, not LOW res :)
It gets much nicer, right guys?"
,kimjongwil,2011-04-11T02:59Z,"RMJ13 = dumbass 

High Res Textures means that you need a BETTER card to run this than the normal Low Res Textures.

It looks better (much sharper) and takes more power to run. 

Most people who are downloading this already have a video card that is more powerful than the average gamer's.

average like you RMJ13.

learn about graphics cards and PC terms before you start talking shit."

,CRimsonEagleX,2011-04-11T04:02Z,"how will this affect performance on a gtx 470, i7 @ 2.8 /w 4 gb of ram?"
,elessarGObonzo,2011-04-11T04:51Z,"  i didnt notice any difference in textures when i just tried this but it has been a week or so since my last play before installing this Texture Pack.
  the Advanced Graphics Options download seemed to make a slight improvement in edge filtering and shading with everything on Extreme setting HDR and Bloom.
  no reduction in gameplay or FPS from either one of em. using  phenom 955, radeon 4890, 4GB 1600 ram. "

- Madness? This is Crysis!"
,Dhatz,2011-04-11T12:35Z,"then check the metal plates that are on ground when you exit the decontamination chamber in tutorial level, they look pirmitive on max textures in original release(most materials look old), I wont DL untill its confirmed it has impact."
,Dallebulle,2011-04-11T15:49Z,"The uninstall option seems flawed, cant take before and after photos, but is DOES make an impact, the ground is much sharper, and a lot of other textures too, not all of em ofc but the one that's been changed is much better!"
,Dallebulle,2011-04-11T16:04Z,"Tooks some screens... i dont run on all Extreme, but at least the textures are ""extreme"" and everything else v-high, Fps > Eyecandy ;)

If you dont like, dont download, do NOT come here and whine cuz this pack doesnt make this gama like a copy of Crysis 1, it doesnt, but it makes it hellofalot better than stock :)"

Extreme on textures, very high on the rest, not much bloom..."

,Dallebulle,2011-04-11T16:13Z,"Also, DO NOT upgrade to 1.2.0.0....

,xiIix,2011-04-12T00:48Z,"I'm personally going to wait for someone to release an entire overhaul of textures much like the high res texture pack for Oblivion. This just doesn't cover enough textures. We need a texture pack that's like 3-4GB in size. In a few months the mod community is going to release some AWESOME shit for this game, and it'll be what it was meant to be. We have the editor with the beta that was released so we can do anything we want."
,elessarGObonzo,2011-04-12T18:33Z,what exactly is the reason it can't be updated to v1.2 and still use this? does crytek block using the other files instead of it's prepackaged low res?
