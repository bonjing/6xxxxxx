[V],Ariclenes,2011-04-07T23:53Z,This is a CD rip Theo :)
[H],Eppo,2011-04-12T17:07Z,@PeteSapai Don't say this is not 'the real deal'. It's what the title says it is. Its as real as it can get.
[T],PeteSapai,2011-04-13T18:30Z,"@3pp0: you are somewhat correct, this is indeed the new FF album and it sounds like the new FF album. The problem is, that it is a re-encode, the sound quality is way too low to be an actual proper 320k CDrip. And in that way, it is not the real deal. If you can't hear it and (therefore) don't believe me: open any of these files with Adobe Audition and click on 'Spectral Frequency Display'."
