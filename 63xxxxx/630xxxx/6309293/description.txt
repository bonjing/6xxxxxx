This release has been modded by keeping in mind a \\\"standard default configuration\\\". The goal was to obtain a fresh installed OS with all the settings in the right place by default, rather than going manually through all the adjustments one by one. When you format and install a new OS you waste a lot of time, (setting up windows, registry setting, icons etc...)


I used Windows 7 Professional as a base version for this release, simply because 7 Professional comes without backup and bit locker features. Dism has been used to integrate updates and removing useless packages like \\\"The upgrading version option\\\" (the annoying entry in the control panel that bothers you to update to the ultimate version), Country packages and others...
