,simonmack,2011-04-21T02:51Z,"hi guys - im pretty new to this. can someone cool please help me out??

with regard to ***Unpack, burn or mount with D-Tools & install*** im lost. D-Tools looks like a pc app. but i have learned that Disk Utilities in Mac is the way to go. but im still lost because i downloaded everything and im not sure how to mount it. i tried to burn the files to a disk and make a .dmg but that did not work. 

also where do i get Keygen from?? pirate bay??

sorry for sounding stupid - i have previously done fairly well here - but i am a little stressed out with several new things which i do not understand - and often get confused that i am using pc fixes for my mac.

anything help - cheers, simo

,CanAPanda,2012-04-11T04:01Z,"I made an account just to clear up all this confusion and help people figure this out because clearly many of you have never installed pirated software.

FIRST keygens will 99.99% of the time show up as viruses to your antivirus so for all of you who freak out because AVG rules your life calm down this is safe.

SECOND TURN YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION OFF NOW (just so you don't forget half way through)

Third You will need - uTorrent (search google), winRar or any rar unzipping application (also search google winRar is free), DAEMON tools lite (also free seach google), a brain and at least 1 hand.

1. download torrent then go to the folder that it was downloaded to, select all of the zipped files (there should be 31 rar archive files) 

2. once they are selected right click and click ""extract here"" from the winRAR option at the top, this will combine them all into an ISO file (DAEMON tools is needed to read the .iso).

3. double click the .iso to enter into its containing folders at the bottom click the ""setup"" application (not the configuration settings), proceed to setup maya using this serial 667-98989898 and this product key 657D1 finish the setup then close the program.

4. Restart Maya (with your internet still off!!!!) click activate then choose ""i have an activation code""

5. go back into the .iso folder and find the folder that is called ""Crack"" inside it choose either the xf 32 or 64 bit keygen (most likely the 64 bit).  double click to open the archive then double click the keygen application.  

6. go back to your maya program that is still open and find the authentication key provided, copy it and past it into the ""Request:"" bar on the keygen then click generate BUT also click ""mem patch"".

7. copy the activation code and paste it into the Maya, finally click activate then click finish.

8. enjoy maya!

If you are still having issues make sure you clicked mem patch before pasting the activation code into maya this is most likely the source of your issue."
,karansaini,2012-04-26T10:26Z,work perfect!!! great job...thankz
,silveryne,2012-05-07T14:20Z,"Here's some extra help (and some more specific help).

- Make sure you're using the right keygen. If you have any other autodesk programs that also used an x-force keygen, make sure that you're not accidentally or intentionally using that other keygen for THIS program. Even though the keygen says ""Autodesk Products"", it might not work for this one. So use the keygen provided in THIS .iso.

- Disconnect from the internet or block this program with a firewall. Don't let it connect to the internet.

Here's when to click the 'Mem Patch' button: 
----
- Once you've installed the program (using the instructions found in install.txt - also located in this ISO), run the program.
- You'll get two windows - one looks like a white dos prompt window, the other has two buttons called ""Try"" and ""Activate"". Ignore the dos-looking window. 
- Are you disconnected from the internet? Then click 'Activate'. Get a request code (I had to do the 'activate by e-mail' option, fill out a form with fake info, and when I hit submit, a local webpage was generated. The very next screen had a link to this webpage. Clicking that link launched a browser that contained the request code. 
- If you use my method, the request code will be split on two different lines. Copying the code and then pasting it will only paste the first half, so make sure to paste the ENTIRE request code into the keygen, first one half, then the other (or combine both lines in notepad, then copy and paste that... or just type it in by hand)
- You may need to hit the 'back' button until you're all the way back to the very first screen with the ""Try"" and ""Activate"" buttons. Now hit 'Activate'. You should now have two options - the second option says something about inputting your activation code. 
- Once you click that option, a grid of empty text boxes will appear.
- NOW IS WHEN YOU CLICK 'MEM PATCH'. (Maybe there are other points in the process where you can click Mem Patch, I don't know, but this is definitely one point where clicking mem patch does work.)


- In the keygen window, Select and delete the words 'Paste Authentification Here', BEFORE you paste the authentication code into that field. A common mistake is to paste your request code and hit 'generate', unaware that your request code looks like 'Paste AuthentifiTKRQ K1D2 JKN4 LMNOcation Here' "

Then, i have read almost comments of everybody, so i share some experience for everybody in my installing maya 2012 because i also had some problems when installed follow the way above.

CanAPanda ->  Instruction  is very clear but not enough, i will add extra note to help everybody successful.

Below, uppercase text is my extra note. Please note.

FIRST keygens will 99.99% of the time show up as viruses to your antivirus so for all of you who freak out because AVG rules your life calm down this is safe.

SECOND TURN YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION OFF NOW (just so you don't forget half way through)

Third You will need - uTorrent (search google), winRar or any rar unzipping application (also search google winRar is free), DAEMON tools lite (also free seach google), a brain and at least 1 hand.

1. download torrent then go to the folder that it was downloaded to, select all of the zipped files (there should be 31 rar archive files) 

2. once they are selected right click and click ""extract here"" from the winRAR option at the top, this will combine them all into an ISO file (DAEMON tools is needed to read the .iso).

3. double click the .iso to enter into its containing folders at the bottom click the ""setup"" application (not the configuration settings), proceed to setup maya using this serial 667-98989898 and this product key 657D1 finish the setup then close the program.

4. RESTART COMPUTER.

5.AFTER RESTART CLICK TO RUN MAYA FROM DESKTOP  (with your internet still off!!!!) click activate then choose ""i have an activation code"".

6. go back into the .iso folder and find the folder that is called ""Crack"" inside it choose either the xf 32 or 64 bit keygen (most likely the 64 bit). COPY xf 32 or 64 bit keygen TO C:Program FilesAutodeskMaya2012 IF YOUR OS IS 64BIT OR C:Program Files (X86)AutodeskMaya2012 IF YOUR OS IS 32BIT. EXTRACT HERE THEN RIGHT CLICK AND CHOOSE RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR the keygen application.
IF YOU DONT RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR, ON STEP 7 WILL NOT SUCCESS (IT MEANS WHEN YOU CLICK ON MEM PATCH, COMPUTER WILL APPEAR A POPUP WITH INFORM ""make sure you can write to current directory"")

7. go back to your maya program that is still open and find the authentication key provided, copy it and past it into the ""Request:"" bar on the keygen then click generate BUT also click ""mem patch"". IF MEM PATCH POPUP REPORTED SUCCESS IS SUCCESSED.

8. copy the activation code and paste it into the Maya, finally click activate then click finish.

9. Restart Computer

10. Turn on Computer and enjoy!

11. Wish everyone success. hehe."

,DACreech,2012-05-26T06:26Z,Strange. I properly mounted this with Power ISO and attempted to install and it is saying I need to insert the disc.  Not sure where to go from here. 
,NoobyMe,2012-06-16T00:59Z,"Ok, I encountered a problem when using the Mem patch. Here is what the computer says
License was not obtained

As my name indicates, I am a noob, all I know how to work with are graphic design... this is a stretch. Could help to figure out what on earth I should do? Thank you"
