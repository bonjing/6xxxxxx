,Sattori,2011-04-21T19:40Z,"Currently I am in equilibrium, why?"
,bedrog,2011-05-07T20:05Z,Thought you might need something to complete your collection.
,Sattori,2011-05-08T19:33Z,Thanks for the offer! But I am not quite the collector. It doesn't bother me if I don't have everything from her.

,FastTaco,2011-06-01T07:38Z,Awesome thanks!  I would also love Kasha's recording called virtual goddess if you happen to have it.
