[V],joshua13,2011-04-07T21:00Z,"actually, zappaz123  they both speak of events that did or did not happen historically and should be evaluated on the evidence the same as other events or writings. No objective investigator has concluded abductions are real, but many specific facts (I don't say events) in the bible have been verified by archaeology, others are disputed. The texts themselves, especially the New testament have just about the same evidence as is accepted w/o questions for things like Caesar's Gallic wars and other documents of similar date. Really its just closed minds that accept one and reject the other at least as to basic integrity of story, leaving aside the miracles at the moment. Calling it ALL fantasy or trying to pretend Jesus never existed for example, is unjustified by the evidence"
