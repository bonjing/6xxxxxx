What the Bible, Alien Abductions and Near-Death Experiences All Have in Common?

This article is not about God, aliens or life after death. It is about a phenomenon that left huge traces to be seen in all these topics, as well as in many others, but usually people cannot see this fact.

I think that sometimes when people claim to see God, aliens or have near death experiences, they made incorrect interpretations of our hidden ability. We should know the truth and think about explanations of the phenomenon. It seems that we are really very close to the next step of our conscious evolution.
