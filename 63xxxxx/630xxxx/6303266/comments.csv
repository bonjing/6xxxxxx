The keygen music reminds me of The Young Ones :D"

,SkeeLo65,2011-10-05T04:45Z,avast add-watch identified keymaker.exe as Trojan.Win32.Generic.pak!cobra
,sun83kim,2012-01-08T21:51Z,"Zonealarm with paid and updated definition did not pick up any malware or trojans on keygen,

However..

I am still wary of using any keygen

Use this one below:

Name: www.serials.ws

Serial: 642B-9AF1-1A4B-1DA1-1DAF-39EC-6BBE-2E6A-DADB-921C

The above keygen works for AoA version 2.30 as well. My friend says the above key infact works for all versions which I havent personally tested.

Enjoy"
