Series investigating the geological forces which shaped East Africa's Great Rift Valley and which make it one of the world\'s most wildlife-rich landscapes.

Part 1. Fire.
The valley, a vast crack spanning the length of East Africa, is the product of deep-seated geological forces which have spewed out a line of cloud-wreathed volcanoes stretching from Ethiopia to Tanzania. Their peaks provide a refuge for East Africa's most extraordinary wildlife, including newly discovered and previously unfilmed species which have evolved surprising survival strategies.
