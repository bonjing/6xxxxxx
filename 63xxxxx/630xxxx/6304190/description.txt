                            By The Name Of Allah

All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that
there is none worthy of worship except Allaah, and that Muhammad is His
slave and Messenger, may Allaah exalt his mention as well as that of his
family and all his companions.
