A/10
V/10
Excellent Brit Indie comedy movie and Funny as f**k, but if your homophobic then stay away...
If your not sure whether you'll like the movie just check out the avi sample because the rest of the movie is just as camp...
Many Thanx to TvTeam and UNVEiL for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:) "

Go away ""Axxodude"" you fool almost no one!"
