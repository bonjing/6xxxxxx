Not everybody can comprehend the complexity of Photoshop, but there is an answer in Pixelmator. Easier to use fewer tools, twists, and bits of info you need memorize to get the job done than Photoshop.  Try it out for yourself and see...

I don't by any means infer that this is a better tool than Photoshop; if you can get Photoshop and learn it then forget about this program. But the learning curve is very steep for Photoshop - not as steep in Pixelmator.

Full assortment of painting tools

Another bunch of tools in Pixelmator are painting tools. The real greatness of these tools is the ability to use different brush sizes, shapes, hardness, even blending modes when painting.

Yes, Pixelmator can add a layer to your composition directly from your Mac's little camera.
