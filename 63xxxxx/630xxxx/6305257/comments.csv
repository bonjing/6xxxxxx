,lodger111,2011-04-10T12:44Z,Thanks for this.  Any chance of seeding it for a while?
,darknessv,2011-04-10T21:45Z,"zero seeding,absolutely zero seeding"
,Tidosho,2011-04-12T17:43Z,"@darknessv: I only uploaded it a few days ago, give it time. As I state in most of my torrents, I cannot leave my laptop running during the night, but do try to leave it running during as much of the day as I can, but hey, I need to use the internet too as well as uTorrent!

@lodger111: I will seed for 6 months, or as soon as there's 10 - 20 copies out there seeding, whichever is greater. I never delete the torrents or files, so if the seeding diminishes, I seed again in the future."
