Windows Users: Extract with 7-Zip, convert resulting .hfs file to ISO with MagicISO. Real good quality."
,dothackjhe,2011-05-31T10:55Z,The file is in .dmg format. Converted it to ISO using PowerISO but seems to be corrupted after mounting to a virtual drive. 
,dothackjhe,2011-05-31T11:49Z,"On the second thought, the file could just be unreadable by Windows 7 even after converting the file to ISO format. Anyone managed to run this on Windows 7?"
,DaveFace,2011-08-16T10:30Z,"Nice effort, next time try uploading in a standard format though. Mac, Windows and Linux users can all use ISO."
,Ariask,2011-10-13T01:08Z,Why do you post .dmg files? Fail.
