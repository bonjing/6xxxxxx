StoryLine: 
**********

Return to rockin' Rydell High for a whole new term! It's 1961, two years 
after the original Grease gang graduated, and there's a new crop of seniors - 
and new members of the coolest cliques on campus, the Pink Ladies and T-Birds. 
Michael Carrington is the new kid in school - but he's been branded a brainiac. 
Can he fix up an old motorcycle, don a leather jacket, avoid a rumble with the l
eader of the T-Birds, and win the heart of Pink Lady Stephanie Zinone? He's 
surely going to try!
