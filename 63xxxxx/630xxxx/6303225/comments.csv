,kabubuki,2011-04-08T06:32Z,"this is probably a stupid question...  how can i download using Magnet Link?  when i clicked on the Magnet Link, it said ""Firefox does not know how to open this address, because the protocol isn't associated with any program.""

is there something i need to install first?  i'm using uTorrent on Mac running Firefox."
,nitai4andra,2011-04-08T07:41Z,"kabubuki,

In your Firefox:

Tools - Options - Applications - in Content Type column search for ""magnet"" and in Action change for ""use uTorrent""."
,nitai4andra,2011-04-08T07:43Z,"kabubuki,

or just right click at the ""magnet link"" - copy link location, then in your uTorrent Ctrl + U or ""File - Add torrent from url"" and paste link."
