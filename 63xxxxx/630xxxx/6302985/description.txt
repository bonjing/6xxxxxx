travel documentary (2005)
 "from a childhood dream till New Zealand"

Ludo Linden went trekking round with his bike for 3 months,
surrounded by breathtaking views on spectacular winding tracks,
experiencing unimaginable sensation.
Strong character, lust for life and positive energy was stronger than a physical handicap.
