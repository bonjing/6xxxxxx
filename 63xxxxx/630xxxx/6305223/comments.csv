,drpittbull,2011-04-09T03:38Z,"Hi mate, thanks for the patch...
But i have really no idea how to unzip it! 
i can't extract it as it is not rar, daemon tools doesn't see it. how do I do this? 
and where is the text document with the patch description?

regards"
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2011-04-09T05:26Z,"@drpittbull
open winrar click on options 
then click on settings
when u get setting window click the ""integration"" tab
you should see user defined archive extensions at bottom of the settings window
type in ""001"" then click ok 
now winrar should be able to extract this torrent 
:)"

thanks a lot man! i got it to work no probs...

Everyone, this patch is really fixing a huge protion of IL2 ! the game is now playable!

But i wonder if anyone else has the same issue as me? 
I seem to get absolutely no AA ingame! It doesn't matter if I put 4 or 8.. it just don't show up in game!
anyone can tell me how to fix it?"
,grider,2011-04-12T05:32Z,TY for the game and this patch.  This patch didn't fix any of my performance problems.  Was it suppose to?  Or is that some other patch yet to be released?
,Hrorlf,2011-04-12T20:15Z,"Not fixing anything :S
Let's wait another patch"

,theropod,2011-04-20T19:29Z,"hi!  can you upload the 1.00.14101 version update? released on steam at 18 april. 
thank you"
,Griften,2011-07-30T12:08Z,"this patch is heavily outdated, the latest one pretty much fixes the game.

Where is it?"
,1sh1g4mi,2011-08-03T18:56Z,Launcher crashes without error.
,_Necross_,2011-08-19T00:31Z,Works but I haven't noticed any difference fps-wise.
