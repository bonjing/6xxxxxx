Windows Users: Extract with 7-Zip, convert resulting .hfs file to ISO with MagicISO. Real good quality."
,McNuttig,2011-04-26T18:37Z,"Seems like you just downloaded that big .rar then reuploaded all of em for credit? I could just be crazy, but the same two videos don't work properly, this being one of them. Why .dmg? Doesn't bother me in the slightest, just why?"
,kriegerd,2011-06-22T20:38Z,"@McNuttig: where you able to find this file elsewhere?? I was supposed to do this workout today and I just realized it's messed up.

Thanx! "
