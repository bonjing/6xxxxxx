Thanks for the race, no matter what format."
,killem2,2011-04-10T15:17Z,"You have a point, but the thing does say BBC one.   if it turned out to be speed tv instead that's a HUGE difference and a HUGE turn off. However, this dude has always been great so I doubt this is speed tv :P"
,raymond_u,2011-04-10T16:10Z,@killem2 correct. This is BBC. BUT. The qualifying 720p was Speed. So that's why I'm asking if the 720p torrent can be from BBC
,skjeggbulbul,2011-04-10T20:17Z,"If this is HDTV, why does it say 624x352?"
