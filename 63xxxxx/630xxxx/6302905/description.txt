THE COMPLETE IMPULSE RECORDINGS

Format: Flac

This set documents some of the most robust and influential fermentation that was taking place in '60s jazz around the Village in New York City. Recorded live in 1966 and 1967, Live is transcendental church music, grounded in conventional African-American spirituality as it reaches exultantly for the sky. Traditional melody-then-solos structure splits at the seams as tunes spill into collective improvisation. The band often suggests a gaggle of patriots crying out in personal jubilation but rallying together, again and again, to sing a cherished anthem anew.

Ayler and Don Cherry maintain a constant tension between simple melodicism and rapturous free blowing in their soloing. "Truth Is Marching In" makes a triumphant New Orleans-style crash, while "Divine Peacemaker" has the regal quality of the music that announces a monarch's arrival. "Angels" is a lovely, if slightly tongue-in-cheek, duet between Ayler and pianist Call Cobbs Jr. The latter's changes are fashioned after the manner of an early-20th-century fantasia, his piano sounding as though it had spent its youth in a dingy Western saloon. Ayler blows a sweet lament over Cobbs' rolling arpeggios, conjuring images of divine winged messengers stumbling tipsily onto a street corner after a hard day at the ol' salvation grind.
