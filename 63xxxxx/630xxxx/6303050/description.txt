Good Vibrations: One of the biggest hits of the 1960's and 1966's biggest selling single in the UK.

Thanks to the original Seeder of the Beat Club series of DVD's from which this was lifted.   Edited to remove the DJ intro this is a film clip shown on Beat Club.

Up until now all my units have been playing a colour video of this song in which the Beach Boys proved to the World that they could NOT play this song live and get away with it sigh...

The great news here is they use the studio soundtrack and do not attempt to do a live performance.  The video quality is a lot better too so enjoy a song that shaped the 60's.
