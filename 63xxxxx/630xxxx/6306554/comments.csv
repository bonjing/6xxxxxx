I am downloading at the moment but speed is very slow. :("
,azer000,2011-04-10T11:56Z,"What do you mean by legit? Quality is good, it's a DVDRip."
,mighty_frog,2011-04-11T07:37Z,"Is this really a DVDRip? I ask because according to Wiki the DVD doesnt come out until today, the 11th but this was uploaded on the 9th"
,azer000,2011-04-11T10:22Z,"Belgium received the DVd on the 8th of April, so yes, this is a dvdrip!"
,Tramp374,2011-04-11T20:12Z,Downloading now will let you all know the how long it takes and about the quality.
,Tramp374,2011-04-12T14:51Z,good quality fast download speed 
,drokkit,2011-04-12T15:35Z,Yep. Looks good. 
,kkiddu,2011-04-12T23:47Z,"Now downloading. Decent speeds. If this is really DVDRip quality, bless you ! If not, bless you nevertheless. Seed away. I'll write on the quality if I remember to."
,kkiddu,2011-04-13T04:59Z,"Howdy ! Finished downloading. A very very decent rip. It does seem like a DVDRip. Sad I don't have others' versions to compare it with.

Audio and video are flawless (flawless as in a DVDRip). Yes, the video is dark, but I think it's just as dark as the director or the dementors intended it to be. In short, a completely watchable rip.

Live long and prosper."
,azer000,2011-04-13T09:56Z,"Thanks for all your comments! If anyone wants me to upload 2CD DVD rips of the other HP movies, just let me know and I'll do it, or if you want any other movies, just ask and I'll see what I can do."
,zebedy212,2011-04-13T20:51Z,Are some of these ppl 4 real 'legitt' wtf??? lmfao
,ballzopie,2011-04-21T01:27Z,"My humble attempt to find the best deathly hallows rip 

Opening thoughts...
First off the movie is long enough to justify a 2 cdrip 1.39GB+, therefore i did not even consider 700meg releases
Second.. stop saying the movie is dark.  Have you never seen a harry potter movie? they're all dark, wake up!
I evaluated the following rips

Taken into consideration....
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6107024/Harry_Potter_And_The_Deathly_Hallows_Part_1.2010.PPVRIP.XviD-WBZ
Grainy, pixelated, colors seemed off
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6279002/Harry.Potter.and.the.Deathly.Hallows.Part.1.DVDRip.XviD-DEFACED
poor video most obvious in forest scene 1:03:55 CD1 (too bad too, usually scene rips never let you down)
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6319993/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows__pt_1_Divx_DVDRip_(eng)
very solid rip, excellent quality [1 avi file 720x404 1.6GB] unfortunatly aspect ratio is off, should be 2.35/1 aka 720x304
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6281928/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_Part_1_HDRip_XviD-MAX
at first glance looks good, however it looks like ripper played with coloring in an attempt to brighten the picture
clearly the brightest rip but not authentic,


And the winner is...
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6306554/Harry.Potter.and.the.Deathly.Hallows.Part.1.DvDRip.XviD-AZER000
excellent quality, proper 2 cd rip [2 avi files 720x304 1.39GB]
obviously you may see a bit more crispness in the video from a 2+gb release but this one is best bang for your buck,
good addition to any collection.

Thanks for the upload azer000"
,Cennation,2011-04-21T02:51Z,awesomely fast speed
,azer000,2011-04-22T10:59Z,"@ ballzopie

,heyo111,2011-05-16T19:09Z,"be careful, there are warner bros (or some company) seeders on this torrent. i got an email for copyright shit."
,El-Faggio,2011-05-28T09:28Z,"Thank you very much for the u/l, I've been searching for weeks for a good copy, find this one and bam! Great video, great audio, both sync'd. Will seed :D"
,oglecowboy,2011-05-30T15:53Z,July 2011 Part 2 I don't know if i can wait that long.  IMDB source
,azer000,2011-06-03T16:01Z,I can't wait either but I suppose we have to! :D
,luckywebb,2011-06-17T22:49Z,"I am pumped this, definitely looks to be the best or one of the best options up, thanks and I will seed for you for sure."
,oglecowboy,2011-06-20T18:04Z,"@heyo111 
You must be a heavy hitter, because I don't know about the others but I never got an email."
,1deelo2,2011-07-20T17:39Z,awesome download speed for my crappy wireless connection! thanks guys! 100 seeders!
,KKKSan,2011-07-25T18:48Z,"Who the Fuck make a sub as sub/idx ?

Why the fuck not keep it simple and make a .srt file ?"
,azer000,2011-07-30T13:31Z,"Because I'm blind and my braille programme can't convert SubRip to make SRT files, because I have to type characters which I can't read, that's why I use sub and idx."
,wilkin96,2011-08-02T14:16Z,"Amazing quality, fast download, audio and video synced, you cant ask for anything more! Well done @azer000"
,norez,2011-08-16T14:01Z,"THIS IS AWESOME! The video is split into two parts, both contained within the torrent. 

No issues about copyright or anything like that. 

Great video, audio- especially for the relatively small file size. Highly worth the download :)"
,TrueTroop,2011-11-04T22:40Z,"Thanks man, good work."
