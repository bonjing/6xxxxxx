Blue Note Records Discography - Manhattan New 85100 Series MP3

This is a near-complete discography of the Blue Note Records series "Manhattan New 85100" which was active during the 1980s and 1990s.  Some real first-rate material from legendary figures.   All encoded Mp3 at the highest possible quality and encoded for itunes.  

One missing entry is the Film and soundtrack "One Night with Blue Note", which is available elsewhere in DVD form.
