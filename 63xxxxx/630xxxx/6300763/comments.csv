,irod1408,2011-09-10T02:04Z,Any chance on any of the other seasons? Same quality would be awesome too!
,Weylen,2011-10-13T10:48Z,Do not waste your time trying to download Anime from here. Get it from http://bakabt.me/ . All seasons of Pokemon are available there. Seasons 1-11 is available as english dubbed and seasons 12-13 are available as english hardsubbed. And they are all freeleech at the moment so there is no worrying about ratios or whatever.
,j.dodge,2011-10-27T08:34Z,is this one in english?
,EpicEntity,2012-04-21T02:35Z,"This is amazing! Thanks very much. Also, do you have the rest of the seasons?"
