One of the biggest hits of 1966 this is quite a rare video captured on TeleCine film.

My Thanks to the original Seeder for the series of Beat Club DVD's from which this was lifted and edited in TMPGEnc 4.0 Xpress to cut out the DJ at the start and stitch together the last 45 seconds of the song which was split between VOB's and tracks on the original DVD.   I think the picture quality makes it worth a look.

Black and White
4:3 Screen Ratio
Audio 320kbps 

Credits roll over the last 30 seconds of this video but the sound is not affected.

Enjoy, Rigmar Radio Rockin' the World since 1967
