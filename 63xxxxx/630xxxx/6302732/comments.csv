,Coltbear50,2011-05-26T19:09Z,"piratetorrent1989 - you ROCK!!!  This is a superb release - it's sort of like ""Shadowlands"" meets ""Ingenue"" - as you know, it's THAT good.  Maybe it has to do with her new producer and co-writer, Joe Pisapia, but k.d. has always written excellent songs and is one of few who can ""sing no wrong"" in my book.  I did not have the four bonus tracks (and in FLAC, to boot!) Will seed and THANK YOU very much!  "
