,MStryderNorth,2011-04-11T15:15Z,This has got to be a cam or the worst rip I have seen.  Quality is bad.  Even the screen is offset.

,Opiumthoughts,2011-04-23T09:53Z,You know what I find funny is you morons coming in here acting all high and mighty treating piratebay like a fucking video store looking for your Blu ray quality movies when you know damn well the movie is still in theaters. Not even bothering reading the title nor the info. Do yourself a and everyone else in this community and just leave and never come back your not welcome you ungrateful fuck. 
,djmopa,2011-04-24T08:04Z,"@ Opiumthoughts

Exactly, I feel the same way. People complain even more when something is free. No one is forcing anyone to download anything."
,zenufa,2011-04-30T01:55Z,"All shit comes from NL, ffs admins cant you ban the  lame upploaders from NL"
,racktor,2011-05-02T03:19Z,"holy merciful crap.  first off, if you download a 4gb movie that came out mere fucking days ago, then shame on you.  This would be a version of a movie that you DID NOT PAY FOR.  i dont give a damn if its 97 gigs and looks like my ass.  its free.  if you dont want it, dont download it.  its simple.  especially if you havent uploaded a damn thing in your life.  you make yourselves look like ungrateful brat bastards time and time again.  grow the fuck up or go spend 12 bucks.  jesus."
,SoLoS124,2011-05-23T22:55Z,v= ?  a = ?
,thanxna,2011-06-14T07:23Z,Right on Racktor
,marthafar,2011-06-14T13:49Z,"@djmopa: Nobody is forced to upload either, you muppet. There's no quota to fill by upping any old shit, so just cool your jets, space cadets, and take the time to do the job properly. If it ain't going to be worth the effort, just don't bother: save us all the grief."
,kwissie,2011-06-19T20:27Z,"Sorry hoor. Dank voor de upload maar is het niet waard te downloaden. Beeld lijkt wel een cam en audio door een sok opgenomen. Download dan liever de 8Gig versie http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6463854 Die zal ik wel blijven seeden maar deze ... HUP en weg istie...

================

Sorry. Thanks for the upload but it's not worth downloading. Sound like a cam and audio recorded through a sock. You can better download the 8Gig version http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6463854 That one I'll keep seeding but this one ... NOT!!!"
,Ricknederland,2011-06-23T17:48Z,"@zenufa You can't blame an entire country for uploading bad quality movies, calm down.
Btw, how did you escape from the mental hospital?"
