,User897,2011-04-11T07:00Z,Doesn't work in Win7 64 bit.
,brianxxx,2011-04-11T15:55Z,"Yes, it does work in Windows 7 64bit. I have it running inside my VMWARE test machine."
,1TWISTED,2011-04-14T14:07Z,"thanks,.. nice upload,... well done,.. ; )"
,IDE286,2011-05-01T16:15Z,"Works in Win 7 X64 live environment. Don't understand the purpose of raring the file in 50 individual rar files and having those files rar'd as well. Once a file is compressed, it can not be compressed anymore. To crack, You must put the exe in the same folder as the crack to crack and put back into program files folder."
,TeamDCPX,2011-07-06T04:06Z,"Great Upload. Worked Flawlessly on Win7 x64. 

@IDE286 - You almost had it, Why not save some time and copy the crack to the programs directory and run it from there. Then you can keep the crack application in that folder without cluttering any other folders..."

,dash456,2011-11-13T09:37Z,"OK realised you have to unzip all those zip files. But what's the proper sequence for the patch ? Keep getting the message ""Can not access the file. Maybe it's in use ... Please close the file before patching!"""
