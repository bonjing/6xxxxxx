BBC The Great Rift Africas Wild Heart 2of3 HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup 2010

Series investigating the geological forces which shaped East Africa's Great Rift Valley and which make it one of the world's most wildlife-rich landscapes.

Part 2. Water.
The valley channels a huge diversity of waterways - rivers, lakes, waterfalls, caustic springs and coral seas - spanning from Egypt to Mozambique. Some lake and ocean deeps harbour previously unseen life-forms, while caustic waters challenge life to the extreme. But where volcanic minerals enrich the Great Rift's waterways, they provide the most spectacular concentrations of birds, mammals and fish.
