""those of us who give up our free time and put effort in to give you these things for free!
So thank you!"" 

Oh pls. When you have actually done that and not just upped two random movies from your drawer you can talk."
,Esmad3,2011-04-20T13:09Z,"Tsk tsk, and you don't have tags of someone who deserves respect. You are trying capitalize on the good name of other uploaders before you have done anything yourself. "
,Dragonite_9,2011-04-22T13:30Z,"Oh please..

As a good friend of mine said, do not talk to those who do not deserve your time, and that I will follow, If you can't appreciate what people do for you, then just be quiet. And no, have not uploaded just some random, absolutely not, and nor have done super much for the torrent community, however much more then you have, especially on the comment section!"
,abbaa,2011-05-01T23:14Z,"@Esmad3

You havnt uploaded anything so why are you bitching... you don't see me flapping my mouth off to people to actually upload stuff."

,Hexeneon,2011-05-09T14:05Z,Thanks Man!!!
,Dragonite_9,2011-05-15T21:44Z,"@XLight05 - Not any super great at ~2 GB almost only bigger sized Blue Ray ones, I took down a ~12 GB Blue Ray version, will create a h.264 720p at ~ 2GB for you and everyone else soon, just got too much to do right now, but I will try to make it within a month, hopefully before, but cant promise anything, except it will be done at some point, so hang on!

@abbaa - Thank you! :)

@Hexeneon - You're very welcome!
(First ""Thank You"" ever posted on our torrents here on TPB hehe, doing this to give back to the biTTorrent community which have given us so much, so we started to give back what we could, nice that 2 persons appreciated it at least ;)  Just a funny thing to think about how this world works, and how people work, that I found interesting to point out. No worries, just a thought m8s. :)

,Dragonite_9,2011-05-26T07:20Z,"Thank you very much shawnmd!
Appreciate it!
And yeah, they are not worth spending any time on so will not do that any more!"
,Esmad3,2011-06-06T15:14Z,"Aww, now I got you feeling bad for him :P I can see why, if you haven't read the annoyingly long posts he does on actual contributors torrents. I totally get why he doesn't put them on his own. They suck, plus here no-one will see them, but here it is (what he considers a great contribution to the community xD):

Can I have your attention for just a minute please! Please read this for all ours sake!

SO WE WILL NOT LOSE ANY MORE OF OUR GREAT TORRENT UP LOADERS!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION!

Bara fÃƒÂ¶r att det ÃƒÂ¤r ""gratis"" sÃƒÂ¥ behÃƒÂ¶ver man inte vara ofÃƒÂ¶rskÃƒÂ¤md, speciellt mot de som

anstrÃƒÂ¤nger sig och ger er dessa saker gratis!
SÃƒÂ¥ tack!

Wanted to say thanks, especially when I know how it feels when no one appreciates our

uploads, as my torrent, has uploaded over 100GB, and no seeders left anyway, everyone left

immediately after they finished, and no one even bothered to say Thank you .. (thinking of

stop seeding it soon, if it will not change..)

Just because it is ""free"" you do not need to be rude and such a douches, especially to

those of us who give up our free time and put effort in to give you these things for free!
So thank you!

Hope this can get more people to understand that just a little THANK YOU! can make a big

difference ..

Best regards!

,Esmad3,2011-06-06T15:47Z,"What a pussy... The above was taken from comments on The Green Hornet by Extremezone (Do you think he would ever write something like that? ""10 million ppl are leeching on my torrents, and only 879.768 says thanks, waawaa"" xD) Personally I think you should be happy about 38 seeders for MiB2 in 2011 :P"
,Dragonite_9,2011-06-07T20:59Z,"No I have never said ""10 million ppl are leeching on my torrents, and only 879.768 says thanks"", nor have at this point only 3 said thanx, and 6 times as many fucking idiots cant be polite and just say thank you for putting up torrents for me for free instead of personal attacks..

If you would have read all about that post you talk about in another torrent, which you obviously have not.. you would know my explanations, it was not the best formulated, used me AND 3Li as an example of why people would stop uploading shit for you, which people are too ignorant too see. Simply people here on tpb are fucking morons (no, not includig me and a lot other persons, since you prolly would comment on that, your that type of person I assume, but many are idiots here anyways..).

And if all you idiots would have some thing inside your heads instead of just a hauntingly strange and weird (WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TODAY??) urge to attack people personal and be rude,

you would see the fact that I AM JUST TRYING TO FUCKING HELP YOU!!!

If this continues, all you idiots write these comments, all big shots (no not me, but not the point, cus I love to be able to get HDLiTE, 3Li etc's torrents, which I would not be able too, as would u not when they stop doing their torrents Now HDLiTE was the next in line to leave at least TPB...) 

SO REALIZE PEOPLE, I ONLY TIED TO HELP YOU, WHAT THE FUCK IS SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THAT, AND WHY THE FUCK DO YOU GIVE ME SHIT FOR TRYING TO HELP YOU, ARE YOU JUST IDIOTS DOING IT FOR FUN OR WHAT THE FUCKING HELL IS YOUR FUCKING PROBLEM WITH ME TRYING VERY HARD TO HELP YOU AS WELL AND SAVE THE TORRENT COMMUNITIES BEST TORRENT CREATORS FROM QUITING, WHICH THEY WILL SOON, SINCE YOU PEOPLE REALLY CANT EVEN BE NICE TO SOMEONE WHO TRY TO HELP YOU STOP THEM FROM LEAVING; NEVER THE LESS CAN YOU NOT AT ALL BE NICE TO THESE AWESOME GUYS THAT GIVE YOU ALL These TORRenTs, WHAT THE FUCK IS UP WITH THAT, WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM!!"
,Dragonite_9,2011-06-07T21:19Z,"It is I who waste my time reply to such a fucking idiot as you.

What the fuck do you have to do with if I upload torrents or not, neither what the fuck do you know about me not uploading any toorents?
TPB I would hardly upload to any more because its full of idiots like you, spending your time being rude and personally attack kind nice people who try to help other people, sham on you, if there is a life after this, you as all the rest would not be welcome to the nice part of it, since all you do is spending time being rude and attack people, specially thos who help you, what the fuck is wrong with you! WHo the fuck do something like that? Only a really mentally disturbed fucked up person would do that, or wait.. prolly not, since so many do it, it's just the human race who are filled with these scumbags who do not deserve to live, your life is not worthy you to have, if you soend it harrassing kind people. It's people like you who should have been consumed by their twin in your mothers stomach or been aborted, you fucing do not deserve this, when you are such a douche! Dut its not too late to change that dear person who harrass people for no reason (or probably cus its fun for you and you others who do it..).
Also what the fuck do you have to do with what my tags are (non of your business, but I know some of these guys, a few from each of the big release groups, and they said it was OK to use them as taggs, to help spread the knowing of the existence of this wounder full but unknown movie, [my other uploaded torrent here, called Pyaar Impossible!  Check it out BTW people, great movie!).

ALSO, complaining about me trying to help every one? First of, why the fuck would someone do that. Second:
WHAT THE FUCK HAVE YOU DONE TO HELP THE P2P COMMNITY, AND TO TRY STOP THESE AWESOME UPLOADERS FROM STOP CREATING NEW TORRENTS?!
I tell ye, NOT A GOD DAMN THING, AS A MATHER OF FACT YOU AND ALL OTHER WHO WRITE COMENTS LIKE THAT FRANKLY ARE INSTEAD WORKING AGAINST IT, YOU ARE SLOWING DOWN AND MAKING US NOT WANT TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE TO TRY SAVE THE BEST UP LOADERS FROM QUITING!!!
Thats blood on your hands! But not that you care..    "
,Dragonite_9,2011-06-07T21:50Z,"AND NO I have never claimed that!

It was not at all a great contributions, I was way too drunk when I wrote that, the issue I tried to explain to people was hardly at all explained in those posts. And Mailee, drunk too went on and posted it to all torrents she could bare to before passing out I saw the day after. Nor is there any delete.

""They suck, plus here no-one will see them, but here it is (what he considers a great contribution to the community""

NEITHER THE LESS, AT LEAST IT WAS A KIND HEARTED WELL MEANT ATTEMPT TO HELP RAISE THE KNOWING ABOUT THAT IF YOU PEOPLE DO NOT CHANGE AND STOP WRITE THESE HARASSING COMMENTS ON ALL THESE GREAT BIG UP LOADERS TORRENTS; THEY SURELY WILL STOP CREATING NEW TORRENTS!
THAT, DO I CONSIDER (even tho that message was a failure) IS A VERY GENEROUS THING TO PUT TIME ON TO DO TO HELP OTHERS AS WELL. What have you or you other who write these fucked up comments done to try to do the same? NOTHING, you are the ones making it worse, you do not help, you are the ones that are making these awesome release groups want to quit!

3Li saw what you people are writing on my comments, just cus I was trying to help, and asked me to not up load the requests that I was going to up load, of for example, 3Li's BRRIP's of THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY, that I and he have, but hardly anyone else.. but as he said, I will not do that now, since you, in his words, do not deserve to be able to get them for free, cus of the way you are acting. So you who requested that, sorry  but cus of people like these ones, you will not get the 3Li BRRIP of the lord of the rings trilogy from us or 3Li. Perhaps in the future if these people change or at least stop, but for now I'm sorry to say, non will get those BRRips....

PS: WOW you are really smart, did you figure out by your self why that message was not posted here?! Good job! haha xD idiot.

And yes, that would be the reason if it was not for the fact that in this case is not, since the day after when we wrote it, we hardly would be posting it on any more places since it was not saying what we wanted it to tell people, nearly as clear as we wanted! (And also yes these torrents are of course not a priority to post them on anyways, since to spread a message out, a lot people must be able to read it, which they are at the top 100 torrents comment section, not on these torrents, older and unknown ones, which do not generate nearly as much seed/lechers. There you go, I thought you something, what to do to spread a message on a torrent site, I'll give you that for free, your welcome! So now you would not have to make a stupid comment about that, cus now you now how things work, and do not have to use rude and fucking harassing comments to hide the fact that you are not smart enough to figure out that what I just explained to you, be your self, so now you know! Nut surely you will find something else to write rude idiotic comments about.. since that is probably the most self satisfaction and accomplishment you will ever feel in your life.. 

DS. Before you comment about this thing I will tell you now, let me say that YES, I understand by posting and saying these comments (stooping to your pathetic level) I contradict what I said in the first place about you should not write those kinds of rude harassing fucking comments, BUT these circumstances do so that unfortunately I must break that and be just a such big fucking douche-bag as you alll who write these comments. Hardly proud of it, but since it is only written because of what your are writing, I really do not care about that at all in this mater... SO now you know that, and if you point that out (please do) you will just prove to be an even more of an idiot, a not so smart one, aka dumb, low IQ, one, that do not even read what I write before you write rude personally disgustingly comments of really bad taste to be written by a normal decent human being. (But oh yeah you already proven that you do not read all that I write, so it will just confirm that even more! haha xD)"
,Unicum2010,2011-06-13T20:44Z,"Downloading now!
