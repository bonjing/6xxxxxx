DOWNLOADERS ONLY. MAKE YOURSELF PRESENT.
PLAIN, COMMON, SHORT ""Thanks"" is better
accepted than ambiguous or stupid comments.

I can see your words only - not picture of yours (figure of speech, meaning - I don't know who you are, never met any of you and heard no ""character"" witnesses of yours).

Upfront, to tell you the truth: defending me when insults or stupidities are left as Comments - would give you dozen plus points automatically, and contrary to that - ignoring those and letting them on my concern, to waste my time and energy - deducts equal amount... "

,mdiggity,2011-04-10T23:12Z,20-40 are you the one that is posting your uploads on facebook? Or is someone else doing it for you? Just curious...
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-10T23:28Z,"@mdiggity: Look... it has nothing to do with me. abciscrazy and other guys do not listen and every time exchange of opinions ended pretty heavy. He keeps mouth shut, post a link and go away - and my opinion about is well known to regular visitors."
,believenu,2011-04-11T01:25Z,thank you seeding is sharing.
,verazationable,2011-04-11T01:34Z,Thanks for The Killing.
,believenu,2011-04-11T02:23Z,"Hello 20-40 and all. 
Regarding us reseeding those we already have. I set up a folder just for your weekly torrents (shows I d/l) and after a week and you put it all in one file to do again a task that appears daunting to most, you reseed and repackage for us again. If there is anything I missed, I d/l and just put it in that folder. If there is any torrents on that list as you have below it will automatically seed those as well. I do delete the other ones though as it seems that except for a small amount, a dead torrent. Comments anyone ? See if this works.
 I also placed all of the lost girl season one in one file and set up my First u/l thanks to expertise of  twentyforty. I will seed that as long as someone wants it. thank you all.
And seeing as you are doing 50""s movies I believe a good one from that time frame only have been able to get in large file +3/4 gb is South Pacific some pretty good themes for a musical and the quality of the film is good too. If you are able that is. thanks "
,believenu,2011-04-11T02:31Z,"whoops.. not clear. The movie title is 
""South Pacific""
 I am sure with your eclectic tastes you have seen this film . a classic in all ways. Just ""Bloody Mary"" makes the movie let alone the scenery."
,believenu,2011-04-11T02:43Z,"well 20-40 it looks like you are geting a fan base on facebook LOL (this could be laugh out load or lots of luck, depending ) I vote the former . just say shucks look down and blush....haha..I am chatty tonight. "
,Ataractic,2011-04-11T05:50Z,Thanks a lot for the pack! I was out of town for a week- but this weekly pack ensures I missed nothing (:
,Ataractic,2011-04-11T06:23Z,"Everyone/anyone with March 30 pack: My downloads have been stuck at 49% (even after leaving the pc on for a week non- stop). Anybody who downloaded Harry potter/Due date and all of marchlands- if it isn't too much to ask- seed for a day, please!"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-11T08:12Z,"@Ataractic: You should said earlier. I would seed it from home (just loaded, but no one is connected). Btw, that torrent was deleted due to Attack of the Morons, but I have it and left active for now, slow as hell, as my home-line permits. Please, take only as much you can download in first 48h (when I'm seeding for sure) AND another 48h during seeding of Weekly pack.

People on slow connections must learn how to use all opportunities given."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-11T09:40Z,"@believenu: I have BluRay South Pacific and would encode it this week for sure, my friend."
,mdiggity,2011-04-11T10:46Z,20-40 thank you for all that you do...   I am here everyday... rain or shine.  I have been following you for over a year now.  Your talent is amazing...
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-11T10:52Z,"@Ataractic
As long as you're not looking for The Office, Justified, InSecurity, or Due Date (which I ""chose"" not to download) my March 30 Pack is still on-line most of the time, and I just marked it as a Force Start, which should insure that if there is an interest it will be an active seed (as has been my seed of believenu's Lost Girl torrent).  My provider apparently has an upper limit of somewhere around 60 kBps total upload, but quite often a single seed will grab ~80% of that."
,Ataractic,2011-04-11T11:45Z,"twentyforty and formerly_azrielle: thanks a ton, both of you!

twentyforty: sorry for the trouble caused, Sir. I honestly thought the download would finish within 10 hours or so, but- I don't know what went wrong. Thanks again for seeding it."
,bigbadmama,2011-04-11T12:56Z,"Dear twentyforty, this is a HUGE blanket thank you for all your great work getting our favorite shows to us in a easily managable & timely manner. Keep up the good work."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-11T12:57Z,"@Ataractic: Well - there is the problem... namely, that torrent was deleted then re-upped because of the insults. At the end of day two I deleted that torrent hoping that downloaders have accustomed to opportunity to finish downloads by using Weekly.Pack. Since you have been away, it was  missed opportunity.

Point being, torrent I have, for some reason, obviously do not work - I have no one in queue.
I do not know which torrent you have loaded, nor which azrielle has...
Safest would be for you to mail me as attachment EXACT torrent you have and I pass it to azrielle.
My e-mail address is in every long torrent header."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-11T13:32Z,Thank you mdiggity and bigbadmama.
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-11T13:48Z,"he's, apparently, downloading it--or someone is, at any rate, *-*-*-*.*.*.sg to be less ambiguous, albeit not able to do it any faster than about 7 kBps."
,Ataractic,2011-04-12T08:25Z,"twentyforty and formerly_azrielle: 83% now- will be finished in an hour or two. Thanks a lot, guys!"
,linkass,2011-04-13T11:32Z,"@twentyforty, I did as you suggested. I cannot get downloading speed of more than 12kbps. At this rate, it'll take me 6days just to download The Kennedys. Can you please reseed for atleast some time?"
,Ataractic,2011-04-13T13:17Z,"formerly_azrielle and twentyforty: The download finished a while ago; without your help, I would still be looking at 40% downloaded torrent with no seeds :)

And yes, that 7 KB guy was me (: "
