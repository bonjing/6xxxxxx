,mrzip744,2011-04-10T18:13Z,"If this will continue to reset for the trial 30 days, it will do away with the blacklist file problem.  Have to wonder though, how long before this great idea gets messed up?
If you follow the very simple instructions....
 IT WORKS!"
,mohitsingh,2011-04-10T19:38Z,"thanks for the comment mrzip744, will take care of that...

,vivekrko,2011-04-17T15:02Z,"@mohitsingh: Will you please create a trial reset app for 'Kaspersky PURE R2 9.1.0.124' too? A guy (@matchico) has created an app here on ThePirateBay.org but it contains a trojan - ""Trojan.Win32.Scar.dvly"". Please!  "
,mohitsingh,2011-04-17T18:40Z,"vivekrko, for that please contact at the email provided with the program..."
,swexpert,2011-04-18T11:58Z,"Just one word: WOW!
Its amazing to see how a tit-for-tat approach is used in the UI. Needless to mention the programming skills involved.

Perhaps next thing would be to try reduce its size? (include the image resource as grayscale image, and the green one as 2 color... etc etc...)

Thanks!
SG"
,Amazing_A,2011-04-18T12:58Z,"someone plz tell me that for how many days it will 
activate kaspersky"
,vivekrko,2011-04-19T09:39Z,"@mohitsingh, I've sent you an email. Please create a PURE trial reset app for us!"
,mohitsingh,2011-04-19T20:21Z,"@Rupert77, will definitely come out with it, you will come to know about it when i release it..."
,mohitsingh,2011-04-19T20:22Z,"@swexpert, thanks for the comment mate!
i'll definitely decrease the size next time!
you are welcome!
;-)"
,mohitsingh,2011-04-19T20:24Z,"@Amazing_A, its written in the description, by the way - it resets for 30 days, you can do this unlimited times!
;-)
@vivekrko, replying, check the inbox!
;-)"
,Spooky137,2011-04-23T06:25Z,@mohitsingh - do let us know when the pure trial reset is out =)

,eugene88,2011-04-30T05:57Z,So we have to update the definitions file every time we reset the trial?
,mohitsingh,2011-04-30T17:52Z,did not get you...
,eugene88,2011-05-01T07:48Z,"Because this software revert the updates back to the updates contained from the setup...
Is there any way to reset trial without losing the defintions?"
,mohitsingh,2011-05-01T09:07Z,"sorry eugene88, but you are absolutely wrong
""this software DOES NOT revert the updates back to the updates contained from the setup""
and you DON'T loose ANY updates and if you can easily notice this by seeing the ""database release date"" and yes, if you remember, you DON'T get ""database are obsolete"" yellow pop up once you reset KIS using Trial reset by UA v2..."
,eugene88,2011-05-01T12:20Z,"Weird....
But never mind,thanks for making such a simple yet great software! xD"

,amosibs,2011-05-09T19:16Z,Many thanks Mohitsingh. Works fine. A much better option than using those keys that get blocked after a day or two.

[T],youssef0eddoumali,2011-09-13T19:44Z,does it work for windows 7 64bit
,mohitsingh,2011-10-01T16:53Z,"@youssef0eddoumali - yep it works on all windows (xp, vista and 7) on 32 as well as 64 bit ;-)"
,swexpert,2011-10-04T16:31Z,"No, Not on x64. I can confirm. Perhaps someting to do with Java, since Java is not officially supported on x64 windows. The error concerns something to do with JIT debugger.

Cannot delete a subkey tree because the subkey tree does not exist.

Just FYI ...:-)

Thanks
SG
