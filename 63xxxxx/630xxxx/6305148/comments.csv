,ZtorkX86,2011-04-11T09:16Z,How do I disable the other voice languages in MPC HC? Apparently when I use MPC HC I can hear 4-5 different languages. In VLC I could just pick one audio track but VLC doesn't has the same video quality as MPC HC. :(
,ZtorkX86,2011-04-11T09:30Z,"What's up with the language track? How do I disable them when I use MPC? I only want English voice, not five of random languages."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-04-11T10:48Z,"Right click on the Haali Media Splitter tray icon and select English, or permantly remove the Russian tracks."
,ZtorkX86,2011-04-11T12:32Z,How do I force Haali Media Splitter? I think I use Matroska as default.
[V],GoodFilms,2011-04-11T14:08Z,Google

[V],GoodFilms,2011-04-11T17:02Z,"you don't need screenshots! if you want HD, get it; if you don't, don't!"
,ZtorkX86,2011-04-11T18:04Z,"I've been trying to post a screenshot via a DropBox link but TPB page is screwing with me.

Anyway, the quality is top notch. The question is: If you like Prison Break and have enough size; download it!!!!"

All English subtitles for this torrent. If you watch this on the computer, you have the subtitles, but my smart TV couldn't read them, so I had to add others. Download them if you find yourself in the same situation."
