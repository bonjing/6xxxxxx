,cybervalo6,2011-04-10T03:02Z,"i really don't know... could be a good quality cam ( saw a REAL good quality cam a few weeks ago, cant remember the film... but ill DL this, and let everyone know in about 8-10 hours from now on (watch the comment time ;)"
,danibo77,2011-04-10T08:49Z,"Quality: It's a TS. Don't expect anything. Camera out of focus several times, weak colours, blurry even at times.

Deleted it after watching 10 minutes and scanning through the film to see if it was really that bad..

Wait for something better if you are not desperate!!!"
