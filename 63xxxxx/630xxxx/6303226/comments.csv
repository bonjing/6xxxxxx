You do realize that scene releases are always packaged like this, right? Most of the trusted uploaders are probably using seedboxes after getting their material from a private site. Do you expect them to download the file from their seedboxes via ftp and then upload a solid file back to the seedbox via ftp just so that you don't have to spend thirty seconds using an extractor?"
