Now for the fine print...

This torrent was created by me (Baron Von Watermelon) using the 1998 soundtrack release as well as MP3s collected from various internet sources.

*  The IMDB website lists "The Goofball Brothers Show" by Sourcerer as a song (or piece of music) used in the film. This track was either specifically written for the film or is ridiculously obscure because I could find no trace of it, or the artist, anywhere.

** Not every song appears in the film in it's original form. "Don't Stop Believin" by Journey is found as an instrumental piece played by the string quartet at the wedding of the main character, Robbie. Also, "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go" by Wham isn't played at all. 2 lines of the song are sung by Robbie's girlfriend, Linda.
