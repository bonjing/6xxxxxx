ADOBE FLASH CS5 REVEALED provides a comprehensive yet concise introduction to Adobe Flash CS5 Professional and the art of creating exceptional interactive experiences, animations and applications that run on the Web, on the desktop and on mobile devices. The book begins with a discussion of fundamental concepts, which sets the stage for specific Flash skill development. A series of step-by-step tutorials follows that fully explains how to create animations, use special effects, draw objects, incorporate sound and video, develop for mobile devices and program in ActionScript 3.0. ADOBE FLASH CS5 REVEALED examines the new and enhanced features of CS5 including Code Snippets - blocks of code that save the effort of typing ActionsScript; Text Layout Framework - provides text flowing, character coloring and column creation; improved video capabilities; and inverse kinematics, a feature that allows you to manipulate Flash objects using the Bone tool in order to create sophisticated animations.
