Vince Hawkins & Company Slave
Vince Hawkins & Company Slave (2010)


Awesome debut studio disc by this bad-ass, killer, blues-based heavy guitar power trio axeripper from Canada. VINCE HAWKINS & COMPANY SLAVE dig deep & rip it hard @ this solid set of brain-damaging, get-down, retro-70s, six string mojo/riffage that will rock your good jam:house into the ground. Highly recommended to fans of Hendrix, Trower & Frank Marino. 

This new release by Vince Hawkins showcases his guitar talents. He obviously favors Hendrix and has a great tone/sound. He may sound like the great master, but is not a copy cat. His originals on this CD bring his own sound and songwriting to the forefront. If you are a fan of Jimi or heavy blues rock then this is for you.
