The Tales of Beedle the Bard is a book of children's stories by British author J. K. 

Rowling. It purports to be the storybook of the same name mentioned in Harry Potter 

and the Deathly Hallows, the last book of the Harry Potter series.[2]

The book was originally produced in a limited edition of only seven copies, each 

handwritten and illustrated by J. K. Rowling.[3] One of them was offered for auction 

in late 2007 and was expected to sell for Â£50,000 ($103,000, â‚¬80,000); ultimately it 

was bought for Â£1.95 million ($3.98 million, â‚¬2.28 million) by Amazon.com, making the 

selling price the highest achieved at auction for a modern literary manuscript.[4][5] 

The money earned at the auction of the book was donated to The Children's Voice 

charity campaign.[6]

The book was published for the general public on 4 December 2008, with the proceeds 

going to the Children's High Level Group.[7][8][9]
