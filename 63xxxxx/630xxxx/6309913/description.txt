Changes:
DVDFab 8.0.8.6 Beta (April 1, 2011)

New: Rewritten user interface with Qt.
New: Changed language files to Qt format.
New: Some minor changes and improvements.

Blu-ray Copy:
New: Added support for ATI Stream acceleration technology.
Note: Please update AMD Radeon video card drivers first.
1. Visit http://sites.amd.com/US/GAME/DOWNLOA...downloads.aspx
2. Download both \"Catalyst Software Suite\" and \"AMD Media Codec Package\" (Optional Downloads).
Currently the ATI Stream support is limited to H.264 and VC1 video decoding. It\'s the problem of AMD driver, and we need to wait for driver updates to support more features like MPEG2 video decoding and H.264 encoding. Also the decoding speed of ATI Stream is not very faster than DXVA, but it should be more stable than DXVA.
Fix: A problem that output size is too small when compressing certain discs like \"The Social Network\" to BD25.
Fix: A problem that 2D copy of Blu-ray 3D disc cannot be played on certain players like PS3.

Blu-ray Ripper:
New: Added support for ATI Stream acceleration technology.
Fix: A crash problem when converting certain discs like \"Robin Hood\".

Blu-ray to DVD Converter:
New: Added support for multiple audio stream selection.
Fix: A video quality problem caused by the new VBR encoding.

Video Converter:
Fix: Several problems when rendering external subtitle.
