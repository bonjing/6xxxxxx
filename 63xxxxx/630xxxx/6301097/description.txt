Released in the fall of 2003, On the Other Hand is a departure in both style and substance from James' first album, Playing it like it isn't.... This bold recording showcases James' stunning command of the uke and his highly imaginative approach to solo acoustic playing. 

Nine of the thirteen tracks are composed by James and range in style from the jazzy Eucalipstick to the serene Lullaby on a G String to the virtuosic tour de force Flight of the Flea. The album also includes James' signature version of Misirlou, a beautiful arrangement of Ol' Man River, and a hot interpretation of the theme from Inspector Gadget. James is skillfully accompanied on nine of the thirteen tracks by longtime friend Mark Luongo on bass.
