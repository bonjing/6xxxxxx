This torrent contains a self-extracting 7-zip files that contains two files: 

1. PC Inspector File Recovery 
My number one choice for recovering files - especially off of a FAT 32 - or any USB Flash Drive for that matter. But it'll also work on your Hard-Drive. An absolute recommend.

2. Data Shredder

I use this software whenever I need to permanently get rid of files. It's simple, easy to use GUI makes this program very flexible in its usage. You don't even have to install it, as it's a portable application. It's only around 300K, and it includes a 1 pass fast method, a DDoD Army 3 pass, a DdoD Airforce 7 pass method, and the 35 pass Gutmann method. Which is, well, a little overkill to me.
