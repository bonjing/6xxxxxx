Orion is a heavy metal studio album by singer-songwriter Ryan Adams, released on May 18, 2010, on Adams' own record label PAX AM. Described as Adams' first "fully-realized sci-fi metal concept album," Orion was released on a limited vinyl run, and could only be purchased from the PAX AM online store. There are no plans for a wide release, but as of November 4th, 2010, Adams' new site paxamrecords.com is offering a standard edition vinyl that will also include the download card of the entire album. Those who purchased the album in its limited run also received a bonus 7" single.

The album was recorded in 2006, while working on Easy Tiger with producer Jamie Candiloro, and is Adams' first full-length album release since splitting from The Cardinals in March 2009.

Orion's artwork was designed by Michel Langevin of Voivod.
