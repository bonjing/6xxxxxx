Today wborland0 has updated his PS3 Game List homebrew application to version 1.4 with a
guide, and as always the changes are detailed below.

To quote: Another release adding more features to the base app; I tried to squeeze in as many
suggestions as possible, feel free to ask for new ones. If you happen to find any bugs, please report
them as well.

PS3 Game List v1.4 change-log and features:

Context menu support (right click on list items to activate);
Initial FTP support (download/upload via context menu);
Proxy support;
Allows mass renaming of game folders (to match game id or game title);
Choosing not to overwrite an existing update no longer aborts the download process (the
next update in line gets selected);
Fixed creation date sorting issue.
