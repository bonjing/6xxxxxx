,mwhitnell,2011-05-11T18:49Z,"Hi, I have downloaded this and am trying to convert it to mpeg4 avi so I can play on my philips dvd player which only plays std avi/divx files.  I have several converter programs: avs6, free video converter, prism video converter, avi.net, divxplus, myvideo, free divx, etc...none which will open this avi.  I searched for a torrent that had a xvid/mpeg4 format but couldn't find one...any solution?  This wont play on cyberlink powerDVD 10 on my PC either"
