Life experiences and her characteristic scripture base accentuate Bethany Dillon's confessional album Stop & Listen, another noteworthy effort by the acoustic pop artist. Since 2008's In Christ Alone, Dillon wed Shane Barnard of worship duo Shane & Shane, and found herself illuminating a new chapter as an artist. More than ever before, her lyrics speak of taking in the moments of life and acknowledging her faults in that effort. This album sees the songstress planting herself firmly within her musical comfort zone, penning track after track of introspection that continues to impress in its wisdom. And while she still commands that space, her conscious decision to remain on the lighter side of things yet again may satisfy some, while leaving other fans slightly deterred at the lack of more risk-taking or alteration in her sound. That said, Dillon is a master of her folk-pop sound and utilizes it well to convey powerful faith-based messages on this record.
