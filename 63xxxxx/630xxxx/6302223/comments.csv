,jawick,2011-04-07T17:49Z,Thanks a lot for Camelot ep.1 and the rest. 
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-07T18:01Z,"@ammotusker: OK, but never ever do it again. If you are unable, for whatever  reason, to finish a download within 24h - you probably would be stuck forever.

Weekly packs are not seeded after 48h at all, and files are deleted from server.

""NOTE: TimeToLive 24h (torrent's TTL) - because it's reupload


ONLY IF YOU'VE MISSED SOMETHING
!!! Do NOT take too much, seeding time is limited !!!""

is written in every header of weekly packs, not to be overlooked."
