,newme2011,2011-04-11T03:31Z,i downloaded a copy of this ep with the same name off here tonight can you please confirm this video plays and is not a fake thanks
,Fantasm,2011-04-11T03:44Z,eztv is a reliable source...
,midnightculture,2011-04-11T03:46Z,"newme 2011 you probably downloaded something that was labeled as uploaded by 'anonymous' . those are usually fakes. check the information about fake detection above, and also make sure that an episode of a show has been aired allready in its country of origin, usually the usa or uk. you can use tv.com or wikipedia for that. 
eztv monitors its own section on TPB so most of the time fakes are removed quite fast. this is probably the real thing as you may allready have noticed !"
,altaiir,2011-04-11T04:29Z,"For the record, this is the episode ""Tiegs for Two"" - which is the 14th episode of the 9th season."
,newme2011,2011-04-11T05:09Z,no offense meant but even sceneline who is a Vip member has uploaded 1 bad torrent after another 
,aParadox,2011-04-11T05:28Z,"I can confirm altaiir's statement to be true. epguides.com, tv.com, all sources state this production code as being episode 14 from season 9. Just look it up. :)"
,candycanegl,2011-04-11T08:39Z,"enough with the bitching every time about the episode number. this is the NEW episode from april 10. the xmas episode was released as 2 in the UK i think, so the numbers have been one off since december. lets all move on now."
,Alicegloom,2011-04-11T14:19Z,"Family Guy S09 hasn't been played in the UK, the number has nothing to do with the UK "
,Alicegloom,2011-04-11T14:26Z,"S09 hasn't been shown in the uk, the messed up episode number has nothink to do with the UK"
,HeyYou88,2011-04-11T15:23Z,"This is episode 14. ""Tiegs for Two"". "
,AlmightyDread,2011-04-11T15:26Z,"EZTV, well done . . . again."
,shop1,2011-04-11T18:26Z,blame the UK!
,7b,2011-04-12T01:01Z,Definitely the correct episode.
,jesse.wiseman95,2011-04-12T07:48Z,why do they always get the episodes wrong
,ohey,2011-04-12T09:57Z,Cause they (torrent ppl) count the Star Wars episode as an episode 
,godswallops,2011-04-12T15:36Z,Great copy as usual... thank you!
,SpitvenoM,2011-04-12T16:55Z,"Who the fuck cares what episode number it is if your not happy about it just lable the avi yourself, its family guy just watch it and stop moaning."
,palecc22,2011-04-12T19:58Z,oh my god. today for the first time in my life I finally saw Back to the Future and the very first joke in this FG is about M. Fox....
