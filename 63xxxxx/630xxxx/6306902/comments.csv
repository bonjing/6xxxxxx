,mmedic,2011-04-13T05:19Z,"Try restarting your i-device.  too many people are leaving them on for ages and often the os get screwy.  or, make sure you hav'nt filled it.  Otherwise you prob need to get a new one.  Me and 6 guys from my platoon use these files on a total of 3 psp's (1x1000, 2 psGO) 5 ipods, 2 iphones, 1 droid, and 2 zunes = 0 issues so far with countless movies/episodes."
