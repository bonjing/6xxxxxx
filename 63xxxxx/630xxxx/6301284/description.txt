Diplo Selects 
Greensleeves Riddimentary (2011)


Riddimentary: Diplo Selects Greensleeves, his DJ mix of music from the labelâ€™s past, turns out to be a love letter to a very specific period in the genreâ€™s evolution: The early-80s moment when deep one-drop roots reggae was just starting to transform into dancehall. It was a time when all these older stars started to integrate digital drum-triggers and echoey synthesizer lines into their tracks, and when the Barrington Levy/Yellowman style of nonsensical stutter-scatting was blowing up. Riddimentary isnâ€™t a wide-ranging dance party; itâ€™s a mix that maintains a single mood and a single tempo throughout. You could dance to it, if you wanted, but you could also wash dishes or read a book or drive down a highway in the middle of the night.
