,magdog28,2011-04-07T00:28Z,Ok 1 seeder! as long as he stays with it I report back to see it it works!
,suitretas,2011-04-07T00:44Z,"probably just me... and sorry, my internet is not that fast"
,mckayi,2011-04-07T23:42Z,weather radar does not work....
,suitretas,2011-04-08T00:22Z,"as i said, i haven't tested it, since i don't have fs9
but, make sure you select a thunderstorm or something to see if it works or not... on fsx, it's dificult to see it work, sometimes....

let's just say it's a rather too simple wxradar"
,suitretas,2011-04-08T00:29Z,not too much feedback.... i'm tempted to delete it...
,heavy1216,2011-04-08T00:32Z,The Radar does work you just have to be at a certain range. If you read the manual it tells you this. I think its 10 to 80 miles thats it. Play around and see. Thanks for this. Everything works perfectly

,mo.yasir,2011-04-11T12:49Z,"Thank you , I will :D
BTW guyz , also here the Weather Radar is not working (Windows 7)"
,rollkilla,2011-04-11T16:17Z,for me the weather radar is working. its only in a 20-80 nm radius. what isn't working for me is that nice curved route. its all zigzag/connect the dots route for me and yes i have the 1104 AIRAC and was like this on the 1103 one as well. any suggestions?
,suitretas,2011-04-11T18:18Z,"yeah... the weather thingy is very much simple, and useless, unless flying with the most horrible weather simulated. 
rollkilla is right, read te manual guys, it can't be that hard, only 10 minutes to get the basic how to...

as for the airac, well, i keep flying with the 1010 version, cause the new ones have new frequencies for some ils approaches, but fsx just keep the old ones.

on fsx there is still zig-zag routing, only SID's and STAR's has some improvements"
,rollkilla,2011-04-12T11:47Z,well even in fs9(which I'm using now) the zigzags are there with star and sid's. I don't see any change what so ever from the original panel besides a hud which I don't use nor many airlines use and the WX on the ecam.
,suitretas,2011-04-12T17:09Z,"yep, and there's another thing i just noticed, i always fly on vc, and with this upgrade, i had a significant frame rate drop, like 5 to 10.

maybe it's just me and my machine...
anyone noticed something similar?"
,NSRacer,2011-04-17T16:53Z,"hey man, how can i contact you? can you leave me an email or something?"
,suitretas,2011-04-19T00:28Z,"yeah... you know what, why don't i give you my real name, and age, where i live and that stuff.... you need anything else?? some coffeee and cookies???"

Just copy the contents from aircraft to the main aircraft folder, the gauges to your fs9 gauges folder, modules to main fs9 modules folder, etc.

the feelthere folder and uninstaller goes in the main fs9 folder"
