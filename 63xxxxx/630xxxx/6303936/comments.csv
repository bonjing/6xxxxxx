,bkarlsen89,2011-04-10T12:28Z,Can we please keep this section for real High Res? you can put all the makeup in the world on a pig... doesent change the fact that it is a pig... -1
,MrAlice,2011-04-10T23:04Z,"miss piggy is a good looking pig, pigs can be gorgeous, so whats the A V here?"
,san_ko,2011-04-11T15:28Z,very bad quality...
,MntDew,2011-04-14T05:27Z,"Colors look a washed-out. Movie is easily watchable if you're interested in saving yourself some money.

A: 8
V: 8
M: 7

I don't know why people hate on this movie. It is original in today's spew of remakes/good series being driven into the ground for profit of having a name attached. 

The movie is a little screwed in the head, but worth a watch. It is a rather dark story, but this by no means makes it a horrible movie. If you want a happy ending movie, or happy movie in general, take a pass."
,powerchord,2011-04-17T05:18Z,"This is not HI RES

TvTeam, you're an asshole. 

Seriously, go fuck yourself"
,M5kungen,2011-04-17T19:58Z,"how can a fucking TS be 720p????
start a own section for TS and the rest of the bullshit low res uploads!"
,studentagain,2011-04-19T05:52Z,"LOL, what's next? 
a 1080p TS? or how about TS in 3D?"
,WunderSpazz,2011-04-19T08:41Z,is it seriously that bad?  
,1curasGray,2011-04-20T02:58Z,@MntDew well original in some sense  was a graphic  novel  way before  it was a movie :L
,spr1nkl3s,2011-04-21T06:08Z,I went to the movie theater to watch this movie. I personally would not recommend this to anybody to watch. It was an absolute disappointment.
,spr1nkl3s,2011-04-21T06:13Z,"I went to the movie theater to watch. It was not worth it and will absolutely not recommend. Watching the first three minutes of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street was easier than this movie. Oh, this was boring and pointless also. P.S. TS movies are not worth it....Chill out for three months and watch the BluRay."
,ronibob,2011-04-21T07:07Z, most beutiful  pig i ever saw was on a bacon sandwich where they belong.
,bewareoblivionisathand,2011-04-22T00:44Z,"A=6, V=4.

,guccicar,2011-04-24T20:48Z,A 3D TS will so dumb. This is dumb 720p TS. Don't beat the fact that it is a TS.
,PandaBearUK,2011-04-25T12:47Z,"Hey TY for the upload!

A:7

,GANJAking223,2011-05-02T10:05Z,Bullshit not 720 DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!! terrible quality
,FrUsTrIc,2011-05-03T17:25Z,"Just becasue your camera might say that it films 720p it doesnt mean that the movie will be 720p.

This is probably the shittiest quality for such a resolution
anyhow, thanks for the effort and upload, although it was below standard."
,jus01,2011-05-03T22:21Z,"TvTeam your letting yourself down with torrents like this.

,ArKL1Te,2011-05-08T05:14Z,"I saw the comments, based on them I say the following: you suck tvteam"
,Timrulez,2011-05-08T12:16Z,"Look at the Seeders..:X Sick for a fake 720p :S
