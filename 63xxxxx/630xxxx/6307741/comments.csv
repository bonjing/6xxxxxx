If you have Mac OS X, you can use an emulator called SheepShaver.
You can download the precompiled version from here: http://www.xs4all.nl/~ronaldpr/sheepshaverforum/SheepShaver_UB_20101106.zip 

Apparently, you'll need a boot image for Mac between System 7.5.3 through Mac OS 9.0.4.
You can get a copy of OS 9 here:

Here's a more detailed instruction to set up ShhepShaver:

I'll try it too. I'll look forward for further updates from you!"
