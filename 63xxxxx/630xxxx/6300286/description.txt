With Music Creatorâ€™s easy-to-use interface, handy assistant tools, and track templates, youâ€™ll be on your way to recording your songs in no time. Learn more from informative videos and great tutorials that are available online. 


Create backing tracks using loops

Music Creator 5 includes a new and improved loop explorer which allows you preview and add audio loops and MIDI patterns to your songs by simple drag-n-drop. These loops are very easy to use and are tempo-synched so they are always in-time and in key, every time. Music Creator includes new loops and MIDI patterns from leading content providers.


Connect Your Instruments Easily

No matter what you want to recordâ€”guitars, keyboards, vocals, CD samples, or any other sound sourceâ€”Music Creator makes it easy to install and start recording.

Just plug your guitar, keyboard, microphone or any other instrument to your computerâ€™s sound card and start recording up to 24-bit audio quality. You can even record MIDI performances in perfect time.

Additionally, you can enhance your Music Creator experience with higher quality USB audio or MIDI interfaces including the Cakewalk UA-1G and UM-1G (sold separately). 


Play & Record with Virtual Instruments

Even if you don't have a band, you can realize your musical vision using virtual instruments. Music Creator includes the new Cakewalk Sound Center, which gives you access to 150 different instrument sounds. It includes acoustic & electric guitars, basses, drums, pianos, synths, strings, ethnic sounds, and more. 

Don't have a drummer? No problem. Just use Studio Instruments Drums to create realistic drum parts for your songs. You can choose from the included drum patterns that come with Studio Instrument Drums or create your own unique drum parts using a MIDI controller or even a mouse. And you get amazing visual feedback as the drums pulse and cymbals crash in time with the music

You also get the Roland TTS-1 synth which is like having a genuine Roland sound module built right into your PC.  The TTS-1 includes everything from synthesizers to orchestral instruments and just about everything in between. To further enhance your productions, you get the Triangle II synthesizer, capable of a broad range of raw, analog-style sounds, from warm to aggressiveâ€”perfect for leads and bass.

Add more sounds

Take the next step and expand your sounds with the entire collection of Cakewalk Studio Instruments (Drums are included in Music Creator 5, other instruments sold separately). When paired with Music Creator, the sky is the limit with authentic bass guitar, piano and string sounds. Additionally, you can expand to your heartâ€™s content with any VST, DirectX or ReWire plug-in.


Edit and Mix Like a Pro

Music Creator also includes numerous views including Arrange, Piano Roll, Drum Editor, traditional Staff Notation, Synth Rack, and Loop Construction. Make pinpoint edits to your project with a click of your mouse. Cut out mistakes or assemble a perfect track from multiple recordings. Make new arrangements or remixes by dragging and dropping.

Mix with a simple, yet powerful onscreen mixer. Move faders up and down to adjust volume, pan tracks left and right, and add studio-quality effects like Reverb, Delay, and EQ to achieve the perfect mix. Connect a MIDI keyboard to your computer to control your mix with real knobs and sliders through Active Controller Technology. 


Studio-quality Effects

New to Music Creator 5 is IK Multimediaâ„¢ AmplitubeÂ® X-GEAR. Just plug in your guitar or bass and get instant access to superbly modeled amps, effects, mic models, cabinets, and even a tuner. Create and save your own custom tones as presets. Add even more sounds through downloadable expansion packs. 

Music Creator includes 10 studio-quality effects that can be used on any track or bus (group of tracks) simultaneously. Add up to 24 effects per project and easily turn on/off the effects for quick A/B comparisons.

The suite of effects that ships with Music Creator includes EQ, Chorus, Delay, Flanger, Phaser, Compressor, Gate, Reverb, and more. Music Creator's effects include useful pre-configured presets for commonly used sounds. Use these effects on input to hear them as you record or add them later on in the mixing process.
