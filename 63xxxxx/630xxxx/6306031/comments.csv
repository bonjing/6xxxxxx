And half of the time it's not even ""Bush Alaska"" like Gold RUsh Alaska for example, those idiots were barely 30 miles from Haines, Alaska which I live 250 KMs away from and it's just ridiculous! Haines is a beautiful, tourist driven town. Stop watching all these STUPID shows and go out and visit the beauty of Alaska.  Flying Wild Alaska is the only exception to this."
