Battle of The Supercars S01E10 Proper as the E10 webrip by WPi is actually ep 5 being mislabeled as ep 10.  They also mislabeled ep 5 as ep 6 and duplicate ep 5 and 6.

My rip really sucks for an amateur but i am hoping that someone can do a much better job and repost ep 10.  I tried using replay media catcher but it complained about some copyright bs flash video so in the end i have to use replay video capture.  If someone can successfully rip the original flash video, please repost thanks

Otherwise ep11-13 are as rel by scene by Reb, which i found on the web.  Don\'t know why no one bother to post these...


This is a great series.  Hope they will keep it up...
