,dlarrym1111,2011-04-11T05:03Z,"I wonder if this is based off a book that was written in the early 1980's called ARIEL. ARIEL is about, not a parallel world, but the world we are in now. In the story (NOT THIS MOVIE) The superbowl is on TV, Pepople are having cook outs and the such, then a crazy storm comes in very quickly. It's learned that every where on the planet experienced this same storm. Back to America (California to be exact) the Superbowl fans are all pissed off because this storm (they think) caused a power outage. What actually happened is that ALL of mans technology, EVERYTHING, even toasters and lawn mowers, EVERYTHING that is based of technology is replaced with Magic. No one understands what has happened and the world goes into chaos, where only the strong will survive. One day a teenager is camping and wakes to find a UNICORN eating some grass outside his camp area. It is at this point that the full understanding of this massive change finally sinks in. This UNICORN (NAMED ARIEL) can speak telepathically to this boy, and explains what has happened. The teenager, immediately goes to the nearest sporting good store and loads up on crossbows, coupound bows and hundreds of hunting arrows, razor tipped, 3 bladed and 5 bladed tips, survival knives, a new tent, etc, etc. . .  This is when his adventure to discover the cause and not get killed along the way begins. HBO made a movie several years ago that also has a similar plot called: ""Cast a Deadly Spell"" The reviews at IMDB scare me as to weather downloading this is just a waste of time. I'll give it a try."
