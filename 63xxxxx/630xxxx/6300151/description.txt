Plot Outline:

Ami (Minase Yashiro, in her film debut) is a tough but 
otherwise average high school girl, trying to lead a normal life. 
Her world comes crashing down when her brother and his friend 
are killed by ruthless bullies. 
As Ami tracks down the ringleader, she is surprised to discover 
the bullies' association with a sinister ninja yakuza family. 
When she goes after her revenge, she soon finds herself in 
over her head and minus her left arm. Barely surviving, 
Ami escapes and seeks out shelter from two kindly garage mechanics. 
They take pity on her, fitting her with a high-powered machine gun 
where her arm used to be. She then teams up with the 
chainsaw-wielding mother (Asami) of her brother's slain friend 
and together they unleash an unholy, non-stop, over-the-top 
kill fest against the equally creative machinery 
(drill bra, flying guillotine) of their relentless ninja enemies.
