,BenSano,2011-04-09T17:55Z,"Dude thanks to this torrent my windows explorer Cash when i enter the Folder i have Windows 7. Any solution? i think this torrent has inserted a sort of virus to the PC. 

Please help."
,P.brata,2011-04-09T19:10Z,"@BenSano

No virus dude,it's a video file and

Above all YIFY never does that and Never will

If you have any video files like from DVD video_ts_1 or  2 delete that Or open Vlc and click Ctrl + O  and  browse movie and play

I don't know your problem details So It might help"

,invpzg2,2011-09-16T12:48Z,"It's good quality for its size, better than a 750GB avi not quite as good as a 1.3GB avi. So whilst it might be high resolution, it's not high definition and would be disappointing on a big screen."
,borrovnica,2011-10-15T21:24Z,It was a virus for me..Couldn't access it after downloading and it kept crashing my windows explorer..
,BinkyDeath,2012-01-13T22:51Z,"borrovnica THERE IS NO VIRUS. Are you a Troll?
There are 2 .txt files and 1 .mkv file - that's IT.
YIFY never uploads viruses but you can always scan all of the files before you open them - which you should do with everything you download anyway. No - definitely no virus.
The quality is, as always for YIFY's torrents, fantastic for the lovely low file size! :)
The audio is not perfect for musical numbers but you can't get much better, if any, for the file size and there's no problem at all for spoken audio or sound effects. The only way to get better quality is with a higher file size - and I can't be bothered with larger files unless it's a musical film or a low file size isn't available.
Awesome job by YIFY as usual. :)"
,bb63cmv,2012-01-23T10:15Z,tnx YIFY for another great upload..... im one of ur fans!!! :)
