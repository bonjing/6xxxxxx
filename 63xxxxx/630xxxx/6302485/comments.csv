,MrBean99999,2011-04-07T21:34Z,"Ok guys, it seems to work now, finally:-)
As I told you, I canÂ´t seed 24/7 but I will seed as soon as I donÂ´t use my computer for other tasks. BTW, donÂ´t install all of them. I installed 6000 fonts one time and will affect your computer in a negative way (slow it down).
Enjoy!"
,SnowManUK99,2011-04-08T09:52Z,Thanks bro - I will keep seeding on my seedbox for a while.
,MrBean99999,2011-04-08T10:19Z,"@steevo-be-thy-name

Yo...maybe its worth go out and buy a 2  TB external USB drive for 110-120 dollar or so. This torrent is once in a lifetime...lol:-) The big harddrives have never been so cheap."
,MrBean99999,2011-04-09T17:55Z,Ok goy...I have to stop seed for the next twelwe hours but then start to seed again. Need my computer for some ther tasks...see you soon:-)
,dcsscd,2011-04-12T19:29Z,"any idea on how to install a big number of fonts at once, instead of one by one ?


Thanks for upload"
,MrBean99999,2011-04-12T21:43Z,"@dcsscd
I think you can do it from Typograf or maybe Bitstream Font Navigator (Corel Draw), not sure."
,MrBean99999,2011-04-19T14:23Z,"So far my seed ratio is 4,513 and I will stop seeding at 5,0 or just above. So it is up to you guys to keep this torrent alive now."
,slavinavas,2011-04-19T15:22Z,"Hi,

I haven't got many fast Internet-so I have one question to you,guys:
Can somebody tell me if the font ""Compacta"" is in that torrent,before I download it?Sure'I'll download it!It's cool,but it'll take me about 1 week-so I'm asking you.Many thanks in advance!

Kind Regards,
slavinavas"
,MrBean99999,2011-04-19T21:44Z,"@slavinavas
There are at least 73 hits on Compacta fonts when I scan the torrent. I will not continue search since 73 should be enough for you:-)"
,slavinavas,2011-04-20T11:32Z,"@MrBean99999,Yeah,that's enough! ;-)"
,Zarkow,2011-04-24T06:16Z,Is Drawzing part of this pack?
,MrBean99999,2011-04-24T12:11Z,"@ Zarkow

Thank you!"
,kellogs99,2011-05-08T14:57Z,anyone know if tf burko is in this?
,MrBean99999,2011-05-08T23:30Z,"@ kellogs99

,ArseRash,2011-05-13T10:33Z,"Great collection, many thanks for uploading.

Downloaders looking to save space should run it through a duplicate file finder as more than 50% of the files are duplicates."
,ratty2,2011-05-16T08:50Z,"Thanks for the tip about deduping, it came out to about 231k fonts. Still a fuckload!"
,_simis_,2011-05-22T09:10Z,"Hi! Thanks for the upload!

I was wondering, is Didoni or Eloquent in this pack? I have been looking for one of these fonts for hours!"
,MrBean99999,2011-05-23T15:57Z,"2 hits on Didoni in folder ""Lith´s Font Pack for Design"". No hits on Eloquent."
,threewestwinds,2011-05-25T23:21Z,"How about Iridium? And specifically, which file is it in? I'll download and seed that file for a good while, but the torrent as a whole is too big for me.

Thanks MrBean99999 for answering everyone's questions about the content."
,threewestwinds,2011-05-25T23:25Z,"Oh, I see now that it's all in one giant .rar file. Please don't do that - it makes things really hard for those of us with slow connections.

Nevermind my above question."
,shiskebob,2011-05-26T19:40Z,looking for FF Signa...could someone please take a look in this monster of a torrent and tell if it's there (and maybe even a hint as to where if you're extra nice)
,slavinavas,2011-05-26T20:31Z,"Hi,

I have one more question-you say that there is ""Compacta"".But is there ""Compacta"" for Cyrillic?

Regards"

Well DUDE, there will be no next time just bc of ungrateful guys like you. If you don´t like the torrent , go somewhere else. And serious, do you think I have time to test all fonts?
