,keffreg,2011-04-18T18:43Z,AVG freaks out says file is a virus!!
,indyguy84,2011-05-03T01:43Z,yeah im a noob at torrenting and etc... how do i unrar and do i need a disc to play?
,ArcZz,2011-05-06T14:15Z,"Great uploader just no maps,uploader you from which country?"
,Marquan117,2011-05-13T06:24Z,"@indyguy84 - to unrar a file, download winrar. You can get a 30 day trial (free), just google winrar download. Once you install winrar, then you can unzip a .rar file by opening it with winrar. You'll see an ""extract"" button on the toolbar (or something like that), so extract it to whatever target folder you want. 
      As for CDs, I don't know if the format is designed for a cd, but if it is, then I think it will be an ISO file (I'm pretty new at this myself).
To use an ISO file, you need to have some kind of CD burning or writing software. Burn the file to a disc (needs to have enough space for the file!), and then run the disc like you would a normal game disc. 
Sorry for the long comment."
,JodieMcRice,2011-05-16T22:43Z,do you have to install warcraft III before these to. or can  you play the game when I install just these 2? :)
,mide5402,2011-05-17T04:12Z,"why can i not use battlenet?

it says something about a validate gamer version??"
,totorox,2011-05-24T13:11Z,"If you honestly think you could use battle.net with this, then you're an idiot.

There's no virus, this works fine. Just the cinematics don't work for me.
If you don't know how to mount an iso without putting it on a CD then you shouldn't even be on a torrent site trying to download a game. "
,taz242003,2011-06-04T16:23Z,jus came up and said tht i needed to insert the disc has been working great til now
,taco972,2011-06-12T01:36Z,beautiful 
,puuba,2011-06-13T08:13Z,@keffreg that is why you shouldn't use antivirus programs they confuse (or lie about) cracking/Keygen programs being Virii
,halfchalupa,2011-06-21T17:01Z,"Warcraft III failed to run.
Please make sure your warcraft III is in your CD-ROM drive, then click on 'Retry'.


So much for being cracked."
,Sardonia,2011-07-06T10:04Z,"It worked fine the first time but cinematics didn't.  After going to properties of the ""WarcraftIII.exe"" file, go into compatibility and check Run as Administrator.  Then the cinematics worked fine.  I played several times, but now the thing won't start up and is saying that ""make sure the cd is in..."" business.  

Bizarre.  Any ideas, anyone?"
,Sardonia,2011-07-07T03:03Z,"Okay.  Now I have the game, along with the cinematic scenes, working again.  For me, clicking properties, going to compatibility, and checking ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:"" and then select XP (Service Pack 3) and make sure ""Run this program as an administrator"" is checked as well.  I don't know why it worked at one point and stopped, but after 10 failed attempts at starting the game, the second I did this, it worked.  "
,terrorElite,2011-08-04T13:23Z,hi all i have game all workin but need help patching it :s
,JarateLover06,2011-08-25T10:23Z,"@terrorElite

 Um.... LOL,   you prob want to download the patch. Then you want to click it twice(do this step pretty fast). Then follow the onscreen instructions. I could make a video of this whole tutorial for you if you want?     :D"
,Abuf88,2011-09-07T23:42Z,"I went to Properties and tried to change it to Windows 7, but it still isn't working. Does it not work in Win 7? Or could someone please walk me through the burning iso business? New to that. Thanks"
,kronpas,2011-09-09T17:38Z,"Got to register just to comment on this: NEVER EVER BOTHER TO DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT. Blizz has long removed protection on latest patches of War3 so you dont have to crack it anymore. Plus this pathetically cracked so-called 'portable' download doesnt allow you to update the game at all. Better off with a clean ISO, patch if from there and enjoy the game. Even if my memory serves me wrongly, its still better to acquire yourself a clean game for future use. Patched exe is way easier to find and is less likely to give you headaches later. "
,ovini,2011-10-12T05:55Z,"tpb shouldn't allow anonymous torrents. that's how you spread virus. it doesn't matter if the files work or not, it's not from a trustful source. don't download it."
,Ludde98,2011-10-17T20:18Z,"Hey, I really appreciate the torrent a stuff. But I have a problem. Everything is working and all is fine exept, I have 2 black boxes on the sides of my gameplay. My screen resulotion is on max. (in game settings) Is there anything I can do to maximise these? "
,[f41l]ACE,2011-11-13T19:02Z,can we play dota on this version?
,gamaoua,2011-11-14T11:18Z,"VIRUS! DO NOT DOWNLOAD! When executing the file for the game I ignored my firewall alerts and played the game normaly. Next day my pc lagged as hell, took 2 minutes to open a folder or to show a pop up menu. I scanned my downloaded files and found a virus in the warcraft folder. I deleted the warcraft file and my pc works fine. Unless sth else happened (beyond my informatics knowledge) this download contains a virus. If you do download it, please scan the folder for viruses before playing!"
,redstorm99,2011-12-07T07:47Z,"can't work!!

,utery11,2012-01-28T23:08Z,"What do you mean by ""Portable""?
Yes this is a nooby question, but i understand ""portable"" as this game can be played on my phone."
