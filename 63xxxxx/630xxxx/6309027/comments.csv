will the F1 become a regular upload?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-10T20:37Z,"I hope not... [quark] ""hate"" live, crowded events. It's one-time-only."
,Killjoy88,2011-04-10T21:45Z,"ok, i understand.. thanks once again, not just for this but for everything you do! "
,jjacobs,2011-04-10T23:47Z,thanks for all the great ups.
,googaloop,2011-04-11T05:02Z,"It looks great!  Hard to believe it is 462 MB. So if you don't plan on doing this regularly, then why are you? To teach someone how to encode better?  Or are you becoming an F1 fan and just too embarassed to say it?"
,jmac85,2011-04-11T05:35Z,"I think x264 hates live events, period. I expect to get heckled, but even 480p Nascar rips look pretty bad with similar encode settings. With newest CoreAVC 2.5.1 is ATI card support, which makes everything play much smoother, even 1080p. Puts 99% of the load on your GPU. But yet, Nascar races in x264 are still not great. I will be passing this up...but thank you for the upload (for those who don't comment)."

thx for info sir
Ref:(tv shows 7 april)"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-11T07:39Z,"@googaloop: Thanks. I stopped to be Formula1 fan in times of Mansell. Piquet and Prost. 1986. precisely. F1 was made boring step by step, especially by tiny German robots which make shoes otherwise."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-11T07:52Z,"@apple016: Nice of you. See you on April 23rd, when SN resumes..."
,t.trikiti,2011-04-11T09:32Z,"I'm a huge F1 fan! THANK YOU! yes it is a live event...but crowded? yeah there are lots of people but you hardly see anybody during the event, all the cams are pointing at the cars and helmet of the drivers! :) please please keep this ones! you got more seeders then most of the movies! :) Thanks for your work! I don't mean to offend you in any way! "
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-11T11:00Z,"(slightly tongue-in-cheek) I guess the 1966 movie Grand Prix, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060472/, is out of the question for a quark upload. ;)"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-11T11:14Z,"@t.trikiti: I do agree, and I would help whenever is possible. I know that 2.22 GB in XviD is too much for many, but all things I've said (regarding [quark]) stands firmly.  There were plenty small-sized encodes of sport and live events before, but they ""suffered"" from things that go against. Keep in mind that I spoke about extra small-sized (as my ridiculously small [quark]) encodes.

@jmac: DXVA do not work properly on my newest encodes, in CoreAVC 2.5.1 it must be ""unticked"" under XP. How it works under Vista or Seven (both make DXVA2 available), I cannot tell."
,hakuna_matata,2011-04-11T16:32Z,Nice to see an F1 torrent but i already got mine from thebox. and LOL .. on german comment.. Good To know Though .. haha.
