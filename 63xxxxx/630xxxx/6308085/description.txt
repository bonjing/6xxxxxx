Jodorowsky & Pinchbeck - 2012 Time for Change (2009)

Meet two masters of magick and mushrooms in dialogue at the intersection of two generations on a quest for spiritual perfection. They talk about relationships, true love, family life, crop circles, the tarot, 2012, the arts, gods and the serpent and whatever. I've included a torrent file leading you to The Holy Mountain - Jodorowsky's hallucinating film.
