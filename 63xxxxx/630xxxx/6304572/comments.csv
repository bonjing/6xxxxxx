,bjr2000,2011-04-08T23:28Z,sorry for slow bandwidth
,bjr2000,2011-04-16T00:34Z,4 seeds and counting!!!
,awl19,2011-04-17T03:58Z,"Thanks so much for the upload. Also, everyone needs to increase their upload speeds because I'm one of the ""4"" he mentioned as seeders as of earlier this morning and have uploaded 75+ gigs so far but at the time I was downloading I was getting 2-10kbs, that's shameful.

Anyways, really appreciate it bjr2000 and you did a great job. Thanks again."
,eddyscape,2011-04-18T12:08Z,"I'm downloading now, I'm having really slow speeds, if I finish downloading this, I will seed to a ratio of 1.00."
,Spooje,2011-04-25T00:35Z,"Simply a mishmash of other torrents already appearing on TPB.  You should credit the work of the original people you downloaded from, bjr2000.  In some ways it's cleaner but that season 6 in .mp4 form sticks out like a sore thumb."
,bjr2000,2011-06-02T00:06Z,"yes Spooje it is a mismatch of torrents but this is way more convienient,

Now There are 17 Seeders (im really sorry but my utorrent crashed on me so im not seeding anymore"
,nickisme123,2011-06-05T07:16Z,"who cares if it is a mash up of other torrents, it is alot easier this way having them all in the one torrent. if this finishes for me will seed for a few months after"
