One, Two, Buckle My Shoe is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie and first

 published in the United Kingdom by the Collins Crime Club in November 1940[1] and in

 US by Dodd, Mead and Company in February 1941 under the title of The Patriotic 

Murders[2]. A paperback edition in the US by Dell books in 1953 changed the title 

again to An Overdose of Death. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and 

sixpence (7/6)[1] while the United States edition retailed at $2.00[2].

It is one of several of Christie's crime fiction novels to feature both the Belgian 

detective Hercule Poirot, and Chief Inspector Japp. This is Japp's final novel 

appearance.

When Hercule Poirotâ€™s own dentist, Henry Morley, is found dead from a gun shot wound, 

the official verdict is that he has killed himself; a verdict apparently supported 

when it appears that he has given one of his patients a fatal overdose of 

anaesthetic. Poirot suspects, however, that there is more to the case than at first 

appears, and soon events confirm his worst suspicions.
