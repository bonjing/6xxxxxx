,pbure,2011-04-08T03:23Z,"Confirmed torrent, this is not a fake!"
,gourang,2011-04-08T12:05Z,"nope, not a fake."
,lievenazerty,2011-04-08T12:22Z,"sceneline, why do you always archive your videos, it's not that much of an issue, but I just want to watch it right away after I downloaded it. So if you could unrar it before uploading it that would be swell thnx and keep up the good work"
,cuntmug,2011-04-10T00:39Z,"I'd like to know what is your intention you are pursuing by using RAR archives.
Merely out of interest.

Thanks for making the nice HD rips, of course."
,gregersamsa,2011-04-12T19:44Z,"Thanks a bunch for sharing, but WHY do you persist on this archaic RAR-archive?! It's a 20 something year old system that is completely redundant!"
