Lâ€™Oeil du malin is one of the earliest and best examples of the ironic suspense thriller for which Claude Chabrol is best known. It contains all the ingredients of a Chabrolesque thriller, including a relentless, lurking sense of menace, a fragile bourgeois setting, a mounting drama which builds to an inescapable tragic resolution and, naturally, a creepy musical score. Although the film is definitively Chabrol from start to finish, it pays more than a passing homage to the work of that other master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.


What marks this film out as a particularly noteworthy entry in the enormous Chabrol canon are the quality of the acting performances, particularly the three lead actors. Excellently supported by StÃ©phane Audran and Walter Reyer, Jacques Charrier is perfect as the malicious young journalist Mercier. (James Travers, Films de France)
