Installing and uninstalling programs are very common in this broadband world. People download programs every day and install them, lucky ones get the chance to serve you, but the others, they have to go.

OK, problems here: some programs are lazy and they won't take everything they brought here. They may leave files under Windows, unused Dll libraries, junk files and tons of registry keys. It's not the worst, some of them even prevent to be uninstalled, it always pops up a square dialog and tells you: "xxx is damaged, I could not be uninstalled."
