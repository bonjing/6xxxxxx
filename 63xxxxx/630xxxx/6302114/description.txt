Here is almost complete musical production my brother and I did
at mid 90s. The most tracks on this torrent are unpublished ones,
provided in MP3 VBR V0 quality. Published tracks are downgraded
to MP3 VBR V9 quality. Tracks cover ACID, HARD and EXPERIMENTAL
techno subgenres, and you can expect to hear some strange (bad)
productions, really weird noises and distortions and unusual drum
sets. The most tracks are somewhat monotonous, but understand that
they were not made for home listening. If you go mad by listening
them in complete - do not send complaints, you have been warned :o)

What is missing are tracks still on Philips DCC tape and some other
quite experimental tracks on ordinary tapes, for which we found no
time (+ no equipment in DCC case) to migrate on CDs.
