Think vocal harmonies. Think Elizabethan pop. Think fretboard wizardry. Think the Melodeon. If you can think all of that, then you have just conjured the dark and peculiar Modeival world that is Faustus. Comprised of three of the most pivotal players in the English roots revival of the past decade, Faustus boast a trio of travelling minstrels whose musical Curriculum Vitae is frankly intimidating...
Faustus are: Paul Sartin (Bellowhead), Benji Kirkpatrick (Seth Lakeman/Bellowhead) and Saul Rose (Waterson:Carthy) 
Having achieved so many successes singularly, it was only a matter of time before these three friends came together to create the musical behemoth that is Faustus. Always striving to make something interesting with the tunes; the band are constantly trying to find something that is slightly different; the melodic pitch in the song, harmonics that can be played with - that different chord or that different section, just something else. The different musical backgrounds conjure a special sound, generated by a pure passion to just play - Paul's harmonies and chord shapes are amazing and he brings a pure musicality to the trio. Benji operates more in rock music terms; finding the groove, always looking for riffs if they can be found. Saul is a very rhythmic player, and plays hugely imaginative chordal ideas at the left hand of the melodeon. Duties are shared instrumentally, the focus always on making an arrangement that works, that fits, that has a flow - that is a thing in its own right and isn't a vehicle for anybody's virtuosity, making something as a whole and utterly cohesive. This calibre of craftsmanship results in a record that could burst at the seams with guest appearances, but instead stands alone as a serious contender for being one of the finest traditional recordings of our times. 

The band doesn't give much thought to their position in the new young contemporary folk scene. They have no agenda except for simply trying to make good music, music that is accessible, and music that's not too esoteric or egocentric. 

Drawing inspiration from everything that they hear, the ethereal and eclectic Faustus have recently toured the UK with LAU and are garnering similar applause and attention from their dynamic live shows; a burning alchemy of staggering musical sorcery, humour and excitable energy - don't expect to simply be politely tapping your foot, instead prepare to be ravaged by the music of Faustus.
