,eyupduck,2011-04-11T17:50Z,Thanks for another great upload. I know that this is not the right upload for comments about Kelbytraining: Fixing Photographic Problems with Adobe Photoshopt but I have posted on there and had no reply. The problem is that the first 3 videoes are correct but the rest are from some other dvd's. Could you please check this.

What player will this thing open in?"
