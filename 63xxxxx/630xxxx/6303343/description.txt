"Unleashed"

A woman is mauled to death by a mountain 
lion, but the investigation reveals the 
victim was injured before the attack. 
Ray and Sara turn to Lady Heather 
(Melinda Clarke), now a doctor, for help 
in tracking down the culprit. Meanwhile, 
Nick and Dr. Robbins rescue the unborn 
baby of a teen girl who appears to have 
committed suicide.

Enjoy :)
