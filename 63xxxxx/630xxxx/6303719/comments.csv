,User897,2011-04-13T06:38Z,"Is this TRULY the 2.0 track and not a remux? I am so tired of trying to find one that has been done correctly. The 7.1 and 5.1 is DISTORTED during loud parts when using only TV or small externals. Case in point, when CLU is first introduced with his helmet on during the Disc Wars. LOUD AS FUCK on a simple setup. "

The black bar at the top is huge and there is barely one at the bottom!  Why isn't the image centered?

TERRIBLE!"

That's probably because the person who encoded this video Didn't crop it right. Or encoded it right for that matter. Also Uploader if you're going to upload a H264, or a X264 for that matter, Try making it a MP4 so that it's more accessible for others to use on other devices. No one should have to RE-Encode the video so they can watch it on a Xbox 360 for example or an Ipad."
