,mecolvin,2011-04-18T17:59Z,works wel :)
,sadvel,2011-04-19T08:02Z,"I was searching for this Version last January but can't find it. Thanks a lot, Chris.

I will seed after downloading or perhaps when my net is idle."
,shadowfoxx,2011-04-19T21:28Z,I'm having trouble with the keygen on both this and 3Ds MAX. When I'm on the licensing page and attempt to use the keygen patch it tells me I must be on the licensing page... But as I said I'm already there. Did I miss a step?
,shadowfoxx,2011-04-21T02:30Z,I did indeed miss a step. I forgot to turn off UAC! Successfully installed now. Thanks a lot! 
,aqueousflame,2011-04-22T05:59Z,"I'm having the same problem with the error to do the mempatch when the licensing window is open. It says it isn't open. I disabled UAC, have latest versions of everything. The install is completely legit otherwise. Anyone have ideas as to why the crack is not recognizing the license window?"
,mkunal19,2011-04-30T07:01Z,Licensing screen is not appearing! I have Windows 7 Ultimate x86! Please help me out
,sexy_manu,2011-05-03T10:27Z,i did nt miss any step while installing but its stuck in loading... everytime i start this it stuck on loading... im using windows 7 what to do??????????
,DragonRider65,2011-05-06T22:40Z,"Dude, your upload rocks! (Any idea why the video tutorials when you first open the program are in Chinese? That was wierd!) I will seed this for a long time, you did a great job putting all of this together. Hope sexy_manu has figured out what happened to their installation? If I were you, I would just delete what I have and re-download the whole thing and unzip it and try again? This works, I just installed it in an old Toshiba Qosmio 32 bit running Windows XP Pro. Tanks again for the up..."
,n0trust,2011-06-20T08:22Z,"Please explain more for the installation. I don't know how to ""mount"" or burn with ""D-Tools"". And I can't find the Crack/Install.txt or the KEYGEN."
,n0trust,2011-06-20T09:30Z,"Never mind, I figured out what it meant. I can't find the .iso file to mount though."
,elite-sky,2011-06-20T23:30Z,"******KEYGEN*******

people are having trouble finding the keygen on this so this is where it is located, the keygen is AcDelTree.exe in the zip file.

but wtf is it called AcDelTree for..?????? ""keygen"" would have been much easier."
,saami_dude,2011-06-22T08:18Z,it asks me to insert another cd while installing why would that be any idea guys?
,ThePirateRules,2011-06-27T19:03Z,Could u give step by step instructions... please?
,expertbill,2011-07-15T21:44Z,"i followed the instructions step by step, i did everything that it said. i tried this over and over and all i get is this message: 

Registration-Activation Error (0015.111)
There is a problem with the activation code that you entered.

this does not work! if it did, it doesnt anymore."
,myared,2011-08-18T19:58Z,"Works great,

,prov1ball,2011-08-26T17:05Z,"thx alot chris!


@expertbill

that's a D in the product code not a 0.  Hope it helps."
,Wolfisk,2011-08-29T18:12Z,"::::Registering Maya Successfully::::

1. When you start Maya, you should be presented with a screen for registration options. The options should be ""Try"" and ""Activate"". Don't click on anything yet.

2. Go to your ISO file and open it with your ISO program. Inside, you'll find a ""Crack"" folder. Open this, and then double click on the 32 or 64 bit ZIP file.

3. Run the keygen inside the ZIP file, then click ""Mem Patch"".

4. Return to your Maya Activation screen, and click ""Activate"". You should now be able to tell Maya that you have an activation code from them. Go ahead and select those options.

5. When you reach the screen that asks for your confirmation code, stop. Look for the longest number on the page and copy it. This is your request code, and should be below all other numbers.

6. Paste the request code into the ""Request"" box of your keygen, then click ""Generate"".

7. You HAVE to do this step. Click on ""Mem Patch"" again.

8. Finally, copy and paste the activation code in your keygen into the set of boxes provided in the Maya Activation window. Enjoy!"

,Ki-aka-Kyle,2011-10-26T12:21Z,"Ok first of all Chris-Aksel you are a f*cking genius, Thanks for this great upload. Second, for all these people moaning that they can't get this installed or are having trouble patching it. Here's some quick instructions for you.

1) Goto Control Panel/ Users / Disable UAC (Computer may need a restart, do it)

2) After this you need to take out your ethernet cable or just turn off your Modem/Router. (Easier for newbies)

3) Install MAYA.

4) After you've finished Installation you may get a pop-up from your Firewall saying allow, Click Block and save rule as always.

5) After Maya has installed and closed open up the Patcher (xf-adesk2012x32.exe) but don't click anything on it.

6) Open up Maya, and click Activate on the right. Now tick the Box and agree.

7) Select the 2nd option down ""I've recieved a Activation from Autodesk"".

8) On the Patch Click ""Mem Patch"" on the left. Message saying ""Patch Successful!"".

9) On Maya Copy the ""Request Code"" into the Patcher, BUT MAKE SURE YOU DELETE THE TEXT ""Paste Authentification here"" or it will mess with your code.

10) Click Generate and copy and paste your new code into the 1st box and Click activate. 

Congratulations you have AutoDesk Maya 2012 installed. You may now reconnect your computer/laptop to the i-net. I hope this helped a few people.

Ki"
,su_ka,2011-11-13T10:56Z,"I followed the instructions step by step. UAC is off, internet cable disconnected, used serial/product key as provided, clicked Mem patch and succefully patched appeared.

I copy my request code to the keygen, but the activation code that is generated is 7 digits short. Any ideas?

(And yes, I've erased ""Paste Authentication here"". I'm using 32bit Vista, and yes, I've opened the 32 bit keygen)"
,SynJu,2011-11-21T13:49Z,"7zip users: If you're having trouble extracting the rar files, use winrar.. it works."
,MapaDeano,2011-11-22T00:33Z,"HEY EVERYONE, AMAZING DISCOVERY! IF YOU'RE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE KEYGEN, LIKE THE MEM PATCH NOT WORKING OR THE ACTIVATION CODE BEING 7 DIGITS SHORT ETC., TRY THIS! I JUST FIGURED THAT YOU CAN COPY THE FIRST 32 DIGITS OF THE ACTIVATION CODE TO PASTE ON THE LICENSE PAGE AND ACTIVATE YOUR PRODUCT! ENJOY!"
,bumpmatt,2011-11-24T13:36Z,Can anybody tell me why when someone wants you to use Daemon tools there is always loads of rar folders with .rXX after them? What are they for?
,MeBeAPirate,2011-11-25T03:16Z,"Working, thanks!"
,username12345678910,2012-01-27T08:11Z,Am I the only one that received a trojan warning when opening xf-a2012?
,neromax,2012-02-10T03:16Z,"Works great wouldnt accept the serial first time closed it restarted and it took it! Then just follow instructions. 

 This may help some newbies to torrents: 

@Bimpmatt and for anyone else use winrar to unzip to exract the first rar file, you dont need them all and it shows and it brings up an  .iso icon, if you have power iso just double click the iso icon you unzipped and when it opens the files in poweriso select all files and extract to the desktop from poweriso.

Once on the desktop you begin the installation read the instructions in the crack file. Install maya then put in the serial number and ID.  

When activation screen comes up, go to the crack folder unzip 32 bit or 64 bit and start up xforce (Run as administrator!!!). 

Click mempatch, should say sucessful,  then copy and paste the request code into xforce and click generate and then copy and paste the generated code into the boxes (I paste into the first box) on the activation screen dont worry it has lots of boxes it pastes it in correctly then voila.  

All if not most keygens show up as viruses for the usual reasons. Its fine."
,neromax,2012-02-10T03:18Z,One last thing it happened to me if it says you maybe dont have permissions to run the xforce exe file then disable your antivirus software and start it up once its installed:)
,SteveKuma,2012-02-14T23:03Z,"Hi guys.
I've downloaded, installed and started up Maya.
All UAC bits etc are as per instruction!
I click on activate > I click continue on the privacy page... then the next window that pops up. I'm assuming this is the page the 'request code' should be, but I'm getting absolutely nothing on it except for two 'check boxes' in the top left hand corner! No text, nothing!
So, I cant go any further with the activation...
Any ideas? Cheers"
,SteveKuma,2012-02-23T21:17Z,"Reference the previous post (above) have solved the blank screen issue, but now the Activation code is 7 digits short when using the KeyGen.
Anyone got an answer for that one please?! :o)"
,skulldragon,2012-03-14T00:45Z,"Okay. this seems to install and start up, but I haven't used it thoroughly.

Don't mind the KG producing a few letters short SN, it's OK, the program will accept it!
It's just a new strategy by devs. to confuse crackers.
Even if you get a notice, that the SN is incorrect, then try again, remove all spaces from Request code, do mem patch before inputting the SN etc."
,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-05-09T22:20Z,"damn downloaDED 64 BIT WHEN I HAVE 32 BIT, o well, it only took 15 minutes download nad another 5 extracting. let's see how good this one does. and i hope the installation is as easy"
,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-05-10T02:05Z,"i am sure everything i did was right but when i search maya in the start menu box and then it says license component has stop working, so what am i soppose to do? am i soppose to download something up to date like dx and netframe work like it said in the instructions, i am not sure what that is so if someone gave me a link to the latest version it probably would help me"
,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-05-10T03:45Z,really is any one having this problem? where you restart or open up Maya to go where you need to click activate and all you get is an error saying unidentified licenses with a plain screen where the choices are suppose to be at
,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-05-20T20:26Z,where is maya so i can open it up? in the autodesk folder there are only 2 more folders called matchmovie and composite 2012 what do i do to open up maya?
