Notes: Dave Peabody is a British folk-blues musician, producer, photographer, and journalist. Some of his greatest performances in the U.S. have been at folk festivals with accompaniment from his longtime collaborator, blues and boogie-woogie pianist Bob Hall. 
Peabody specializes in bringing together songs and musicians to record a broad spectrum of blues styles. In 1993, he collaborated with Big Boy Henry, Robert Lucas, Chicago Bob Nelson, and Big Joe Louis & His Blues Kings to create 'Hands Across The Sea'. In 1996, 'Down In Carolina' included Cora May Bryant (Curley Weaver's daughter), Steve James, and harmonica player Neal Pattman, who was in his 70s at the time.
Peabody was named Acoustic Blues Artist of the Year in 1995, 2001, and 2002 by the British Blues Connection.
