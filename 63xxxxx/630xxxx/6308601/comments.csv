,richardpa,2011-04-10T18:47Z,"OK TVRip and a fast download...
A/8
V/7
Picture is pretty pixelated, and has been cropped. There's the usual SyFy Channel watermark in the right hand corner and the odd SyFy Channel advert that pops up across the bottom now and again. The audio has a slight distortion (hiss) if played loud through WMP but was less noticeable through my VLC Player...
Many Thanx to extemezone for the decent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"

,Ruffage,2011-04-14T12:39Z,You can get rid of the hiss by changing the audio channel to left. (In VLC player click - Audio - Audio Channels - Left)
