,chamuallen,2011-04-08T18:04Z,This torrent has a virus called Trojan horse injector-ciw. Is that normal.

It may very well be a placebo as I haven't any solid proof of it improving download speed. My downloads are flutuating so much I can't tell when I start and stop the Turbo.

I scanned with Kaspersky 2011 Internet Security and found nothing threatening.

Already have uTorrent Turbo Accelerator v2.0.0 and used the serial from v1.9.0.0 which worked well. Nice to stop that nagging pop-up screen."
