Scandinavian Airlines Flight 751 was a regularly scheduled Scandinavian Airlines flight from Stockholm, Sweden to Copenhagen, Denmark and Warsaw, Poland that crashed on 27 December 1991. The McDonnell Douglas MD-81 was piloted by Danish captain Stefan G. Rasmussen and Swedish first officer Ulf Cedermark. Ice had collected on the wings prior to take off, which broke off and was sucked into the engines when the aircraft became airborne. After losing both engines, the pilots were forced to make an emergency landing in a field near GottrÃ¶ra, Sweden
