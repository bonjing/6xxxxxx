,myryad,2011-04-28T14:02Z,Can you re-submit the first one?  It's getting that 'no input file specified' error that happens on TPB from time to time.
,DocFreak08,2011-04-28T19:08Z,"I didn't see other similar comments left from part #1, so I assume it isn't serious problem. If I see several more, I will delete it and do re-upload/crosspost again."
,Billythebat,2011-05-24T14:31Z,the first one is faulty as myrad stated. 
,DocFreak08,2011-05-31T01:15Z,"I deleted the part #1 because it didn't make any sense to keep it wastin' space here. But when you do deletion the site won't allow re-upload, so it's gone for good.. However, I have mirrored it to many sites so just use google to find it ! ;-)"
