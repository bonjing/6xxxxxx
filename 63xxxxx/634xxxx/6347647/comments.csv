Old lady orders a turkey sandwich. The chef is in the kitchen banging the cooked Turkey. Then makes the sandwich and adds a little Extra Mayo  before he serves it up. Next scene is watching the old lady eat the sanwich and making funny faces as she tastes the Extra mayo.

Any Idea what film that was? Might have been peter north but I'm not sure.

Thanks for all your torrents by the way."

Im downloading it now, but from the description I'm not sure that it is the correct movie.

Will report back once I have had a look."

you are right, it is not the same movie. It has a sallad dressing scene with Annette Haven. A real classic."
