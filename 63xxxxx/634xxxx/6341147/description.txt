Electromagnetic Field Simulation for High-Performance Electromechanical Design
MaxwellÂ® is the premier electromagnetic field simulation software for engineers tasked with designing and analyzing 3-D and 2-D electromagnetic and electromechanical devices such as motors, actuators, transformers, sensors and coils. Maxwell uses the accurate finite element method to solve static, frequency-domain and time-varying electromagnetic and electric fields. A key benefit of Maxwell is its automated solution process where users are only required to specify geometry, material properties and the desired output. From this point, Maxwell will automatically generate an appropriate, efficient and accurate mesh for solving the problem. This proven automatic adaptive meshing process removes complexity from the analysis process and allows engineers to benefit from a highly-efficient, easy-to-use design flow.

A key feature in Maxwell is the ability to generate high-fidelity, reduced order models from the finite-element solution for use in SimplorerÂ®, ANSYS' multi-domain system simulation software. This capability creates a powerful electromagnetic-based design flow that enables users to combine complex circuits with accurate component models from Maxwell to design complete high-performance electromechanical, mechatronic and power electronic systems.
