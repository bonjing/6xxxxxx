[b]Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D

Sources:
Video: Russian DVD-5
Astral.2010.D.DVD.ELEKTRI4KA
Audio: Imagines "line" thx

Encode: well took me around 20h to make something half decent. The Russian DVD has very low quality. It doesnt want to get sharpened or brightened up without getting bad or worse. so i made around 20 different encodes to finally get one rather harmless,that looks like the dvd in fullscreen without getting contour errors or visible stripes in movement.
looks better this way
Now to the Audio.
There are only 2 audios available, the older cam audio which is not nice and the new "line" from imagine.
But i am thankful at least its a complete audiotrack to begin with.
I made a lot of improvements besides cleaning and running it trough a speechfilter and a phonopreamp
i played with mids, treble and bass along with noise and some loudness adjustment.
you can hear now better what they are saying.
its a bit of an improvment but dont await too much i am not a magician.
if you rated imagines audio a 3 before its now a 4.5 maybe, but decent to watch and hear.
i didnt do 5.1, that would kill the audio.
with the sources available atm, this maybe the best solution till something better comes up.
well its your decision, watch the sample and decide if you want it or not before you download it.
at least i dont say in the nfo sweet line, which it isnt.

btw. imagines video is 7 secondes shorter, thats why imagines audio is not sync to the r5 video, which results in not sync like in rx video.
this 7 seconds missing are at point 17m25s and 58m35s.
since there is no audio for that spots you can either cut them out or make a audio looping, but thats just for the ones who wants to know.
My audio like always will fit to any r5 direct video encode.
