,ximikecix,2011-04-25T03:27Z,Is it good quality and it has good audio now plz respond ASAP 
,hfmxj,2011-04-25T06:19Z,"I don't see why people complain, the sound is a little bit funny but it doesn't bother the enjoyment of the film at all. This copy has awesome video, and the audio is in sync and you can hear everything they say. The only thing I noticed was it seemed to cut in and out a few times in the movie, but not in action parts only during parts where nobody was even talking. It also seemed like there was some kind of noise in the background in the beginning, like someone was walking around the house, but it didn't seem to fit in. Like I said though, those things are pretty trivial so if you want to watch the movie this is probably your better option. & for those of you saying thanks but no thanks, I'll wait for a better copy... what is the point? It is not only a waste of your time to make a stupid comment like that but it is a waste of others time as well if people want to know ratings of the film. Nobody cares if you want to wait for a better copy, if you do go to er, but don't whine about a copy you haven't seen just based on the info or if you prefer watching high quality blueray films or something.. try waiting until they come out in stores and watch it then instead of whining and making the decent copies look bad to others who are simply appreciative of a copy like this. 

over all,
movie 8
video 9
audio 7

Movie was great, pretty scary, and I look forward to the second one. It did seem a bit low budget though but it was still really good. "
,iamhelix,2011-04-25T10:25Z,""" Is it good quality and it has good audio now plz respond ASAP ""

,Erich505,2011-04-27T05:34Z,"Froggie, you and I both know you can do better than this. I can almost hear people eating popcorn in the background."

,Archonin,2011-06-11T08:01Z,"Stop asking stupid questions that's clearly stated in the info.
Stop asking stupid questions about why your audio doesn't work, it's because you're stupid.
Stop asking stupid questions about how to fix your missing audio that's not there because you're stupid.
That's what google is for, not so your stupid head can type with your stupid finger what has been answered 1000000 times before.

Thanks for the release, though, I'll wait until we get a better audio-track."
,Kunty,2011-06-13T01:05Z,"ok Archonin we may be stupid and not know how to sort the audio out on this download, you patronising prick, but i bet you a fucking billion dollars you don't know how to remove your own eye ball without shedding a single tear!!! no? neither can eye!! you fucking nerdy, pencil dick twat!!!
