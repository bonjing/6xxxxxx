,adam1516,2011-06-05T21:09Z,where are eps 8 & 9??
,Rodrifg,2011-07-14T03:04Z,actually if you check with this(http://science.discovery.com/tv/sci-fi-science/episodes.html) there is only 1 episode missing cuz they're actually only 11
,Rodrifg,2011-07-14T03:07Z,"the episode missing, according to the list, is ""Black Hole Odyssey"", it should be after the episode"" destroy the deathstar"" and also on thr website there is no ""first contact"" episode."
