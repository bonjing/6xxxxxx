          Mimosa is back! This single is a MUST HAVE if you are a collector, hopefully this dude (Tigran, yeah thats his name) comes out with a full album soon, I'll definitely get that out there right when it comes out. So yeah, this definitely gives the Mimosa vibe, hope you all like it :) Please seed and smoke weed, peace
