Golden Earring - Long Blond Animal [promo].VOB


Very HQ very rare uncensored promo music video shot at a Musikladen stage. "Long Blond Animal" is a song from Prisoner of the Night, an album by Dutch hard rock band Golden Earring, released in 1980

Founded in 1961, Golden Earring has been active for nearly 50 years non-stop. The current line-up has been together since 1970, which makes Golden Earring the world's longest surviving rock band, having been formed a year before The Rolling Stones. 

Founded in 1961 in their home town of The Hague by 13-year-old George Kooymans and his 15-year-old neighbour, Rinus Gerritsen, they were originally called The Tornados. The band's first line-up mainly played The Shadows covers. The name was changed to Golden Earrings (the 's' was dropped in 1969) when they discovered that The Tornados was already in use by another group.

Golden Earring's upcoming studio album will be recorded live at the famous Abbey Road Studios in London during spring 2011.
