IÂ´m uploading this by CiceroÂ´s request !
He is the producer of this High Definition  DVD
hereÂ´s CiceroÂ´s original txt:

Cicero HD  Series Volume 2 !!!!

The dvd has a  nice menu (CiceroÂ´s Style) and every chapter is a song
In my humble opinion, it was a very nice show, but the band is the weakest one the madman has had. The drummer acts like an octopus, but he does not play like Aldridge or R. Castillo, or even the FNM guy... He is more image than sound ! The bass player is so ... normal. The Guitar player is OK !
A great number of  songs was shot by clawbrz and mgfri(thanks a lot for the great work, the credits are included at the dvd menu this time).
 For a sample, check their videos at youtube and watch it at a resolution of 720 or 1080) and give them a very nice rating !!
