,pars18,2011-04-28T11:20Z,"I can't install ""Update Pro Tools.mpkg"" and ""Install Complete Production Toolkit 2"". At the end of the installation, I had an error message"
,roddyf52,2011-04-28T13:29Z,"you can download the update directly from the Avid website, it works fine with that. Also install the other stuff from the additional installs of the protools 9 install package"
,roddyf52,2011-04-28T13:31Z,I do not believe this is the final XVX release but it seems to be quite stable once you get it installed. Also HEAT will not work unless you have HD hardware
,roddyf52,2011-04-28T13:34Z,"9.0.2 update

Check whith SL 10.6.5 & 10.6.7"
,roddyf52,2011-05-02T13:55Z,You need to completely remove any other versions and remove Xcom if you have it installed from the last crack. other than that I dont know. it works fine on my hackintosh
,gogostephen,2012-01-22T01:35Z,It works great with osx lion Thanks!!!
,Xipe88,2012-01-23T18:11Z,"lion 10.7.2, doesn't work... all the installations have reached a successful conclusion.
what if I install the pro tools 9.0.6 update? "
,pookerella,2012-01-24T03:17Z,"Im on 10.7.2 and everything installs except for the 9.0.2 update included in the package.   I couldn't find a 9.0.2 update anywhere online (its now 9.0.5 on avid's site), and I tried to install the 9.0.5 update  DLed from avid's site, which successfully installed. I successfully installed the crack after that, but then the pt9 loader didnt work, which I assumed would happen, considering its a PT 9.0.2 loader.  I started looking at the installation process for the older crack http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6085886/AVID.Protools.9.0.Full.Install.incl.Loader.crack.1.1 and am wondering if installing xcode, gdb (if possible on lion 7.0.2), etc. etc. would help? in the process of downloading xcode. any help will be much appreciated. Thanks and good luck!"
,pookerella,2012-01-24T18:33Z,any ideas guys? I still cant get it to work on 10.7.2

,pookerella,2012-01-25T18:02Z,"The 9.0.2 update on avid's site says its for osx 10.6, but Ill give it a shot."

,pookerella,2012-01-25T20:22Z,"No dice for 7.0.2 for me as well. The Updater from avids site wont install. Hm... Running out of ideas, but Ill toy with it later. "
,marvinzon,2012-01-26T02:40Z,"'gogostephen', do you happen to have Lion on 10.7.2 because I'm in the same boat as the others where it's not booting up on my Mac. Everything downloads fine, but when I try to open up Pro Tools, it says ""you can't use this version of the application Pro Tools with this version of Mac OS X. You have Pro Tools 9.0.2"". If you somehow got it to work, are you please willing to share the order in which you downloaded everything? Thanks!"
,pookerella,2012-01-27T19:06Z,"I got the same message as marvinzon, and would also appreciate and help!"

However when i try to run pro tools i get the message ""You cant use pro tools with this version of mac osx"" (Pro tools 9.0.2) How have the other people managed to get it to work on lion?"
