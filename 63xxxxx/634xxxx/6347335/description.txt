This is the same bulky pdf file that's in other torrents here and all over the web. The problem is the scanned file has double pages which makes it hard to read the book. 
I cut down the pdf into single pages. It still doesn't look like a professional pdf file but at least you don't have to move the slider left and right all the time to browse pages.
Thanks for the original scanner and uploader.
