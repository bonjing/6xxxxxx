,schmoogly,2011-07-18T05:16Z,"@GalitShpichter, thank you so much for your amazing torrents. Just wondering, do you have any books on Mandarin and Hokkien? If you don't have any to upload, could you give some recommendations?

Anyway, I hope people comment on the quality of the books in their native language so it would be easier for everyone to pick out which ones to study.

As a native Tagalog speaker, I wouldn't recommend Teach Yourself Tagalog. The speakers in the recordings sound like they're talking to a 5 year-old, and the grammatical examples are too formal and outdated.

For beginners who just want a crash course in conversational Tagalog, Living Language is simple enough but not very comprehensive.

Basic Tagalog for Foreigners and Non-Tagalogs is probably the best one in the collection. Comprehensive, well-structured but easy enough to understand (with a little bit of effort)."
,GalitShpichter,2011-07-19T08:32Z,"@schmoogly, Mandarin Chinese resources can be found here
