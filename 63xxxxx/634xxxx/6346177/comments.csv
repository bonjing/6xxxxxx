,herbsmokinfreak,2011-04-26T22:18Z,They aired Ep7 at 2am one time. I found Ep8 on vimeo. Thank you for uploading though my man never got to see the end. What is up with Discovery? This is a great show idea they just pick the wrong peeps to do this stuff...it's always the bitchy cubicle think they know everything type and that's what makes peeps stop watching!
,k3nd00d,2011-04-26T23:29Z,"I think the 1st 2 seasons, in Alaska, were better. I want to see more rustic/pioneering shows like Frontier House. How about a real reality show where 20 to 50 people have to homestead, farm and engineer a village starting in a prairie near a small river/stream and trees they can log? Let them bring a few clothes and hand tools, covered wagons, horses and chickens, seeds for what they want to plant the 1st year and 5 years to enjoy the wide open space. ""The Real Little Houses of the West"""
,k3nd00d,2011-04-26T23:37Z,"Or, how about a 5 year recreation of settlers landing on the east coast of the US, where they only had natives to trade with (which in real life too often resulted in suspicion, misunderstanding, starvation, desperation and fighting -- like Roanoke Colony)."

,k3nd00d,2011-08-20T11:20Z,"Yeah, I dl Frontier House a while back. It is pretty good."
,babybluetits24,2011-09-28T15:19Z,i wish discovery had done a follow up episode to talk to the people who took part in it like they did at the end of one of the alaska seasons..we want to hear from them months after the experiment..if such a show becomes available let us know here thanks ps hope theres a season4
