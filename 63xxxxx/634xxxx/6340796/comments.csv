,yklusia,2011-04-24T15:14Z,You will have to wait forever for a crack since the game is online ONLY using EA's servers. Will be quite some time before anyone makes private servers. So don't bother downloading this.
[T],Knaster,2011-04-24T15:52Z,shitgame anyway
,steve30x,2011-04-24T17:59Z,The uploader also soent at least twenty minutes writing a proper description. 
,ZShock,2011-04-25T13:30Z,You're welcome.
,Izkuzz,2011-04-26T08:43Z,"How good could this game possibly be without online play, though?"
,hahalolfailmupp,2011-04-26T11:25Z,"Well if its a clonedvd its awesome, people don't always have a dvdrom installed, and this is quite perfect for some. "
,kainrain,2011-04-26T15:09Z,"thnx for the upload mate! :D 

is there a crack or offline game play or anyway to play the game? (not the beta) 

thank you helpers! :D"
,grant747,2011-04-27T07:22Z,SO FAR THIS IS WORKING!!! :D THX MAN
,effepirat,2011-04-27T19:58Z,"played beta.  game is total crap.  few nice gimmicks, and actually a few good ideas, but implementation failed hardcore, and theres hardly any content to call it a complete game.

at most it should have released as a $20 game, similar to a typical indie title.  thats all it is.

if you want the king of ARPG's, titan quest is still the ruler.  will have to wait til grim dawn, path of exile, war of the north, etc to see if there is a successor, but so far, titan quest (especially with underlord mod) is the best ARPG you can play right now."
,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-04-27T20:05Z,"I played the beta  of this, it was terrible, like spore becomes a dungeon crawler, just awful, worst game that I've played in ages."

Have you had the misfortune to try Dragon Age 2?  It's actually worse than this...

EA.  Experts at fucking up good developers' works."
,DecadentDandycake,2011-04-28T08:36Z,"Oh my god, all you people do is bitch about ""this game sucks"" ""it's so terrible"" You know what lets see you make a game as extensive as this or any other modern PC game and see how it is. If you don't like the game don't fuckin play it and stop bitching for fucks sake."
,kainrain,2011-04-28T16:02Z,"anyone knows how to run the game? if so plz help one comment can do it, ty... (and a comment like ""you noob"" will not help!)"
,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-04-28T19:16Z,"@krastavitsata, yes I couldn't even finish that one either, I used to think EA were o.k, now I think they are a bunch of money grubbing sellouts. "
,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-04-28T19:18Z,"@ DecadentDandycake, go piss on an electric fence, it would be more fun than this game. "
,Omocho,2011-04-29T18:37Z,"@DecadentDandycake   Don't bother reading comments on here for if a game is good or not, lol. It's like gamespot...full of retards with terrible opinions.
I haven't played Darkspore yet, but I can pretty much guarantee it doesn't deserve all the pointless hate."
,El__Jefe,2011-04-29T18:46Z,"@DecadentDandycake It's not an issue of whether we can create a game like it ourselves (although we could, if we had a team of developers). That's a logical fallacy--you can still criticize a ballet dancer for falling even though you can't dance ballet."
,chip211,2011-04-29T18:48Z,"wait how the fuck did you manage to play this

at least i wanna try it before i make an opinion"
,Osiris69,2011-04-30T16:52Z,"Dayum!  What a shame.  The preview I just saw of Dark Spore made the game look incredible.  But alas, from what a lot of you are saying, it's total crap and the only good stuff you see is in the previews.  Figures.  Just like movie trailers.  Thanks for the advanced warning, fellas!!

BTW, on-line games can be great if done right.  World of Warcraft sucked me into the MMORPG playing field for 5 straight years until Blizzard butchered/scrambled up the player rules in Cataclysm.  (Sigh)

Osi"
,Osiris69,2011-04-30T16:57Z,"@El_Jefe - LoL.  Well said.

Dark Spore on-line only?  Ah crap.  The trailer I just saw watched made the game look awesome!  It had me fooled for a single player game with killer graphics.  5 years of World of Warcraft was enough for me and MMORPGs!

Come on, programmers!  Let's get back to single-player games, man!  Enough already with the MMORPGs!"
,Grimmstone,2011-05-01T21:37Z,"Knaster is a crybaby bitch because he can't play for free.

It's a good game for its genre, though it doesn't break new ground.  It's basically a loot game with Spore characters...and that's not bad."
,dzebna,2011-05-02T19:03Z,"@El__Jefe i can make 3D games even without team of programmers or 3D artists, but still...i like this game and even its not the best game i have ever seen...its ok :D"
,ztoundas,2011-05-03T17:15Z,"For those who expect a crack:
Don't. This game has absolutely no value without online play. 

And for those who are noobs, you need a crack to play this, and so far there isnt one. Nor do I expect there will be. 
It would be like cracking WOW. 

Other than that, this is a pretty fun game. Kind of simple and addicting, but don't expect to be blown away. 
It's definitely better than spore though.
Worth maybe $20"
,Khane,2011-05-07T17:26Z,"@ztoundas 
you do realise WOW was cracked and has had private servers running since the first week of release right ?"
,kukijoe,2011-05-12T23:57Z,"@Khane
WOW was never cracked and never will be. If it was cracked you wouldn't have to go to shit private servers. Private servers are using emulators to make the game something similar to an official server but failed really hard because it is unplayable."
,elturbo9077,2011-05-14T06:20Z,"@kukijoe

do u know that wow was cracked without online servers there are offline emulators like the assassins creed 2 server that work better then the online private servers the best offline server emulator is called acweb ultimate repack 9 which is only to patch 3.2 but eeverything works 100 percent not like the online server works only like 70 percent of the game but there are other that are up to 4.0.6 patch

also final fantasy xi has or had a offline server that only worked 60 percent with is called projectxi which in 2009 square enix took down but people like me managed to get some copies people said it was impossible to crack but took 5 years and 4 people to crack it 

and this is a shitty game from the screenshots it looks cool but this is a complete shit for me  i don;t think is gonna get cracked becuase its boring not like ac2 or pofp which are cooler 

if u want the wow servers here is the link for atleast 1000

,enddodays,2011-05-23T22:30Z,"I've played Wow single player (Hosted my own private server with only access to myself). So it isn't impossible to do so. Skidrow says wait for crack. So no point beating around the bush, just wait for them to get the crack out. You could always go out and buy the game if you're in that big of a rush."
,elturbo9077,2011-05-24T21:27Z,"@enddodays

yeah i totally agree with u  i play wow with a server emulator or online with molten but i think wow sucks thought sorry to say  i wonder why the hell people are in a rush to download the game and want mulitplayer also if people want that just go buy the game and multiplayer is imposible to hack"
,nofear916,2011-06-02T15:42Z,im stuck i have downloaded it but i cant get past the retail key. does anyone know how or what i put in?? 
,Ithalimoon,2011-06-15T14:19Z,"@Khane and kukijoe
Not since 1 week of release. You've got to understand how the private servers work, and that has nothing to do with cracking. Anyone can set up a sandbox with only WoW files on their computer and without cracking the game. Indeed, there is actually no need to crack the game, and therefore I doubt anyone has done it. Private servers work, as someone here said, with emulators, and it took approximately 2 months for first private server since the release. After that it has been the same after all expansions, taking a month or so for working private servers to appear.
Another note, private servers these days on WoW are very much playable if handled by professional coders  and developers."
,Naimin,2011-06-15T16:16Z,"Uploaded the crack...
Haven't used it yet, so you can try it out

,MitchJJ_NL,2011-06-15T22:55Z,"About the crack, anyone used it yet??
I scanned it with VirusTotal and came out 0/42.

But I dont trust it.. The file I downloaded is 115kb while the original darkspore.exe 17mb is.
Also the icons doesnt match.. and the description is ''PC'' ?? wth. xD

If anyone tested it yet.. please say so ;)"
,S.Rose,2011-06-22T10:04Z,Scaned crack with nod32 and malewarebytes came up clean. the size is fine. you dont replace the exe you use the crack to fix the exe
,S.Rose,2011-06-23T04:45Z,While the crack is virus free it does not work.
,dragonflyy,2011-06-26T02:18Z,@Ithalimoon: The private servers for WoW were not 2 month after release. GotWoW was a fully working emulator that was produced while WoW was still in Beta. They also got the crap sued out of them for release the code for it.
,crimdrim,2011-07-07T15:33Z,still no crack?
,WV25705,2011-07-08T05:22Z,Comcast users beware.  I got a copyright infringement email.  1st one in 8 years of pirate bay use.

,pclove,2011-08-19T20:55Z,can anyone validate lockon's crack? or lockon himself?
,dud12343,2011-08-28T23:23Z,"WHAT THE FUCK? i tryed the crack of lockon and doesnt work. i did the steps. i put the program in the folder without replace it . then i instaled the shit, restart the windows and NOTHINg, still asking me the key. its bullshit. if for some one else wotks, well send me and mess. on this email : duduasdf@yahoo.com"
