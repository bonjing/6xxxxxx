DJ Jurgen - Live at Dance Valley.


Original was full CD on one MP3 - cut it down into 10 minute segments.  This is a rip of a CD that I burned many years ago (original media is long gone).  Quality is still pretty good, though - sounds like MP3 quality with the occasional pop or click, but IMO barely noticable.
