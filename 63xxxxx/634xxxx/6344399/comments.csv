The file is corrupt and unreadable."
,ResistNWO,2012-01-26T05:36Z,"I almmost never comment on torrents but i just had to chime in. 

The file is NOT currupt and perfectly readable. 

The reason that pinkSkull said what he said is probably becasue when i first tried to download the torrent program opened but the torrent failed to start up. 

I tried downloading again again possibly by clicking  in GET TORRENT FILE all the way to the right of the magnet. "
