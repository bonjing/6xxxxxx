Wimme Saari - Mun (2009) - FLAC



Shamanistic chant meets modern soundscapes. Wimme Saari is a SÃ¡mi joik singer; a traditional chant style that has certain elements in common with Native American music, most importantly a reverence for the earth and the elements.
Wimme combines colorful grittiness of traditional joiking elements with original improvisations. In his joik, Wimme constructs intense, clear melodic arches and stretches his voice from a sweet falsetto to a grave baritone. But the old joik is still there: Wimme has recaptured the essence of the ancient joik, and even the clever voice technique of the animal joiks.
