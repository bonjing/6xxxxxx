When Madelyn hits a rough patch with her boyfriend, she decides to move into a women's shelter. Something seems weird though. Everybody living there seems to be a little bit too comfortable around Madelyn. When the head of the house, Capri, finds out that her newest tenant is talking to her ex, she's not too happy. She'll teach her a lesson she won't soon forget.
