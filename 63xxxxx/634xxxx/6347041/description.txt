Sweet - Love is Like Oxygen [promo].VOB


Very HQ very rare promo music video. "Love is Like Oxygen" is a song from Level Headed, a 1978 album by British rock band Sweet. The album features "Love is Like Oxygen", the band's last original single to hit the top 40 on both sides of the Atlantic, peaking at #8 in the United States and #9 in the UK Singles Chart. The single version of "Love is Like Oxygen" is substantially shorter than the full album version, and the US version having only the first verse, shorter intermezzo and the funky outro. A second single, "California Nights", was released from the album but only reached #78 in the UK and #76 in the US.

This was the last album to feature the "classic" Sweet line-up of Brian Connolly, Andy Scott, Mick Tucker and Steve Priest. About a year after its release, while working on the next album, Connolly left the band to embark on a solo career. The remaining trio continued as Sweet and delivered three more albums before breaking up in 1982.
