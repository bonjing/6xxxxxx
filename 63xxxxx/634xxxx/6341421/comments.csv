,camgaertner226,2011-07-08T17:51Z,"Received a DMCA notice from my ISP for downloading this specific torrent. I suggest you do not download it, seems it's monitored by Paramount."
,BarbitaN,2011-09-13T02:34Z,Be aware it is a tracker on this thing. I got a complaint from my ISP. Do not download.
,lattari,2012-04-02T16:00Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD??? This is not an american site, please stop acting like it. You almost got me going for my favorite rant :) Just a side note - I think you guys are fucking crazy downloading in the first place without vpn or similar - given the possible consequences in your country. Just stop asking people to delete their torrents  because of your comcast-letters. It's fucking stupid to give money to an ISP that spies you in the first place but hey, whatever gets your juices going. This summer they are going to add some punishment in the mix - who's your daddy!"
