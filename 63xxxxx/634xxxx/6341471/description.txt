Elvis may have been the "King of Rock 'N' Roll," but his roots were in country music, and Elvis himself never forgot that. From his rockabilly beginnings to his final days, Elvis was never far from country music, and country was never far from Elvis. Many of his later singles, such as "My Way" and "Hurt" appeared on the country charts; "Suspicious Minds" crossed over both ways, country to pop and back again. And throughout Elvis' career, he recorded the country music he loved. 
This collection brings together songs spanning Elvis' career, from his smokin' cover of Bill Monroe's "Blue Moon of Kentucky" to his beautiful rendition of the classic "Always On My Mind," which was a big hit for Willie Nelson. Here on this disc you'll find Elvis singing Hank Williams' "Your Cheatin' Heart" and Eddie Rabbit's "Kentucky Rain." Elvis puts his distinctive stamp on standards like "Green Green Grass of Home" and Hank Cochran's "Make the World Go Away." He takes on almost all of the Highwaymen, as he shines on Waylon Jennings' "You Asked Me To," Willie Nelson's "Funny How Time Slips Away" and the Kris Kristofferson classic, "Help Me Make It Through The Night." He even takes on the Statler Brothers' "Susan When She Tried."
