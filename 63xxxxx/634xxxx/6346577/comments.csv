,SecretAgentMan23,2011-04-28T08:24Z,why does the dvd pic say True Justice and the torrent says Street Wars? which trailer do i look up?!?!?!
,2manydoobies,2011-04-29T23:47Z,"Seagal and Silva have trained on alot of occasions plus seagal has been present at many camp meets with Machida, Anderson, and many other Brazilian shit kicking crew members.
silva doesn't deny obtaining seagal's knowledge regarding the front kick that toppled Belfort.

that being sad, buddy that commented about seagal being whack is just an effin' idiot.
and with that being said, this movie is shit.
thanks for uploading extreme zone your one of the best"

,lovecat66,2012-05-16T21:09Z,"I don't wanna break any Big Steven Seagal fan's heart, ( I am also one ) but this movie is really sucks...Bad story, boring scenes, not even the nice pussies can provide this film a Big Time...This is nothing else like deep disappointment, cannot measure on the same page to his late movies Pistol Whipped,Kill Switch,The Keeper or classies like On Deadly Ground, Fire Down Below..."
