,kujirasan,2011-05-19T04:09Z,"The archive apparently is mix of rar and ISO, it is impossible to extract, if some one knows how to extract it, post a message. 
Stun; do you have to complicate things to a preposterous level?"
,kujirasan,2011-05-19T05:55Z,"Managed to extract the files, this genius has first rared up then done an ISO. 
In reference to the 64 bit:
This MAGNiTUDE supplied crack, in the  MAGNiTUDE folder, there are 5 files;
1.Install.text
2.kegen.bat
3.ptc.dat
4.ptc.exe
5.PTC_Creo5_X64_Corrector.exe

This is the content of the install.text file:


PTC Creo Elements/Pro 5.0 M080 

1. In the crack directory open the file called ptc.dat and 00-00-00-00-00-00 replace with your
   PTC host ID value (showed in left bottom corner of setup screen or use ""Program Files\PTC\Creo Elements\Pro5.0\bin\ptchostid.bat"" to get it).
   Run keygen.bat which will create a license.dat.

2. Run setup and install your selection of Creo products.
   Select Locked licensing and point to license.dat created at step #1.

3. Copy the ""PTC_Creo5_Corrector.exe"" to ""Program Files\PTC\""and run it. Patching may need some minutes!

4. Before running Creo Elements it is strongly recommended to block it from internet access.

PS: You may run ""Program Files\PTC\Creo Elements\Pro5.0\bin\ptcsetup.bat"" to set/change your WF5 setup.
It does not explain what to do PTC.exe,  my friedn tried installing on 64 , no luck. 
If you guys have installed post an instruction, as what to do with ptc.exe, thanking all "
,kujirasan,2011-05-26T01:46Z,"Hi guys, I managed to install it , on Wondows7X64, and it works like a charm.
1.I disable the firewall and virus scanner etc. 
2.Copied everything to the Desktop.
3.Created the license.dat , as per instruction.
4.Proceeded with installation.
5.Loaded the license.dat , then clicked on the ptc.bat, and closed it.
6. Used patch, it does around 60 patch, and takes long time so let it do the work.
One more thing, I extracted the files, in LINUX, Fedora14, as could not do it in Windows. If you need any help, and if I can be of service, post a reply, best of luck, and thanks to the up loader. "

,clementine2090,2011-06-04T03:04Z,Can some one help me out? I am trying to install the x32 version on disk 1. I cannot seem to generate the license.dat file after following all the instructions in step 1. I found the hostid and replaced it in the ptc.dat file. but when I run the keygen it does not generate license.dat file.Please can someone help me out? thanks
,Ocean_F,2011-06-05T17:51Z,"Thanks! Great job!
I install it on Windows XP SP2 32bit. Before running Creo Elements it is strongly recommended to block it from internet access:
 - Control Panel, Firewall, Exceptions, Creo...., Edit, Change scope, My network.
Again thanks a lot!"
,Ocean_F,2011-06-05T18:02Z,"clementine2090, copy the directory MAGNiTUDE on the hard disk, inside change the ptc.dat with your hostid. Use ""Replace"" command of Notepad, because you must make it many times and can make mistake. Save it like ptc.txt and after this from windows explorer rename it to ptc.dat.
The modifyed ptc.dat and keygen.bat must be in the same folder before to run keygen.bat."
,clementine2090,2011-06-06T03:19Z,"Hi Ocean_F, i tried what you suggested. I copy-pasted the MAGNiTUDE folder under C:\Program files\PTC folder with all files inside it as it is. Also, identified the hostid of my pc. Still no change-- the keygen.bat does not generate a license file. The error it shows is "" 'ptc' is not recognised as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file"". ...any help?"
,Ocean_F,2011-06-06T15:11Z,"clementine2090 - Did you change ptc.txt to ptc.dat, after changing hostID?
What is your OS and text editor?"
,Ocean_F,2011-06-06T15:25Z,"Sometime windows explorer hide the extansions of the files. Maybe your file name after chainging hostID is file.dat.txt and not file.dat. 
In the windows explorer go to Tools/Folder Options/View and in the menu unmark 
Hide extensions for known file types"
,biertjesfredprost3000,2011-06-19T13:01Z,"Help please.
Everything went well till I wanted to use the Corrector. The command screen opened but then it started beeping and told me he can't open all the files.
Tried it severeal times now.

When you run PTC_Creo5_Corrector in Win7, you need to click right mouse button to select run it with administractor. Otherwise Win7 will not let you run any program.
you need to use 7-zip to extract each of the downloaded disk1 and disk2 to become ISO file, then run 7-zip to extract these two ISO files.
disk1 is for 32 bit system while disk2 is for 64 bit system.

When I try to launch the Cre/ProE, it just pops up and vanishes. When I click on the Thermal, it says ""Invalid (Inconsistent) License"".

Thanks."
,ctboyer1,2011-12-27T17:35Z,"This is all quite confusing.  I have not been able to generate a license.dat file either, even though I have copied the Magnitude folder onto my hard drive locally, then I have modified the ptc.dat file to include my correct Host ID information, then saved it over the original ptc.dat file.  When I run the keygen.exe file, it opens a dos prompt style window for a second, then closes.  No license.dat file is created.  When I install the software I point to the ptc.dat file.  Then when I run it, it opens for a split second then closes.  Nothing else.  Can anyone really help?"
,rd0769,2012-02-12T19:22Z,"Guys i got the solution..!
