Creo Parametric is the app for parametric modeling (as you might
guess). All the capabilities of Creo Elements/Pro aka Pro/ENGINEER
Creo Direct is your direct modeling app when you want to interact
directly with the 3D geometry
Creo Simulate is the analyst app. Use it for structural and
thermal simulation
Creo Layout is the app for anybody who wants to flesh out early
concept layout work in 2D, with the intention of ultimately evolving
the design to 3D
Creo Schematics is the app for creating 2D routed systems
diagrams, like cabling and piping
Creo Illustrate is an app full of tools for those who need to
communicate complex service information concepts graphically in 3D
Creo View MCAD is a lighter weight app for those who want to view
interrogate, and mark up MCAD geometry
Creo View ECAD is another light weight app. But for ECAD geometry

Magnitude, a measure of the brightness of a star - the Ancient Greek
astronomers divided the stars into six magnitudes. First-magnitude
stars were the brightest, and sixth-magnitude stars were the
faintest. This system has been kept in modern times, when the new era
of MAGNiTUDE has started

If you feel like you have the power to face first-magnitude stars
