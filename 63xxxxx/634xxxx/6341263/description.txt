              A martial artist hunts a killer in a            
               plague-infested urban dump of the future.       
               He is the escort for a half-cyborg woman        
               whose programming contains a possible cure     
                 for a plague. But the woman is kidnapped        
                 by the martial artist's evil nemesis while      
                they are en route to her Atlanta                
                headquarters. That leads him right into a        
               lion's den of sadomasochistic torture and        
               torment.
