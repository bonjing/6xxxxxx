                Brand new drama based on Kate Summerscale's
                bestselling novel, itself based on real events. One
                morning in 1860, the inhabitants of a sleepy
                Wiltshire village wake up to a shocking discovery.
                Behind the shuttered windows of the Kent family's
                elegant country house, a horrific murder has taken
                place. As the local police struggle to find the
                culprit, the case becomes a national scandal, and
                Inspector Jack Whicher of the newly formed Scotland
                Yard detective department is sent to the countryside
                to solve the crime. When he arrives, Whicher soon
                realises that the Kent investigation will be the most
                challenging of his career. As he tries to crack the
                case, he must deal with the prejudice of the press
                and the public, as well as an inept local police
                force.
