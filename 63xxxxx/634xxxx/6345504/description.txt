plot

Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) are two friends who keep bumping into each other after years apart from each other. Emma and Adam meet again through their mutual friend Patrice, when Emma is a resident in a local hospital and Adam is the assistant on a High School Musical-like TV-show, with aspirations of becoming a script writer. Adam takes down Emmaâ€™s phone number, but forgets to call her.
Six months later, Adam becomes distraught, when his eccentric father (Kevin Kline), who used to be the star of a TV show called â€œGreat Scottâ€ is having a relationship with his ex-girlfriend Vanessa. Determined to â€˜get back on the wagonâ€™, Adam starts calling every woman in his cell phone. The next day, he wakes up after a drunken night to find out that he text-messaged Emma and came to the home she shares with some other residents, including Patrice. Emma leads Adam to her bedroom to retrieve his pants, when the two of them wind up having sex.
