,sapo_joe,2011-06-21T01:02Z,"Hey HMVinyl, I'm so happy with your initiative, listening to these excelent-quality vinyl rips is awesome!

BTW, could you rip the latest Mark Knopfler album (Get Lucky) that had a special version on vinyl?

There's no way to find it here in my country, it sells only in Europe and US!

THX man!"
