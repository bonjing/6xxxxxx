The Crossing

(2000) NR
 
Jeff Daniels stars in this stirring dramatization of George Washington's surprise attack on the British Army's German mercenaries at Trenton during the American Revolution, based on the book by Howard Fast. The film brings to life the Continental Army's historic passage across the Delaware on Christmas night, 1776, and the lopsided battle that followed as Washington risked everything in one last desperately daring attack.
