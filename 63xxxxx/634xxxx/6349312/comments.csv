,randorigan,2011-04-28T19:19Z,im am downloading at 3 mb/s woot
,Portallis,2011-04-28T20:10Z,"This really works, eh? The other torrents are all glitchy and the game crashes after I enter the first Portal. Maybe it's my computer. Thanks."
,firetammer6,2011-04-28T20:21Z,lucky lol i got it with 1 seed and 26 peers so i only had from 100-400kb/s
,firetammer6,2011-04-28T20:25Z,"so wait it says portal but is it portal 2 
lol bc if it is i dont think my pc could handle it"
,BlackEcho,2011-04-28T20:38Z,No crashes or glitches for me.I tested everything.
,imagarrysmodmaster,2011-04-29T00:30Z,@blackecho i wonder if it works wit ma computer cuz i have a bad vid card and 1 processor with game booster vid card : rage 128 pro ultra gl agp does that video card work?
,BlackEcho,2011-04-29T05:58Z,It should work if hl2 works fine portal will work too.But on low settings im sure you will run it.
,Blitzmidfielder,2011-04-29T10:43Z,"It only loads by using hl2.exe, but if I do that i can't start a new game or anything."
,BlackEcho,2011-04-29T12:27Z,"Strange..here everything works just fine 
try to make new shortcut of hl2.exe and in target area write -game ""portal"" or -game ""portal prelude """
,Aloska-01,2011-04-29T22:24Z,I don't really get it. You say that a new shortcut is needed. I did that but it says the file should be in D:/... . 
,BlackEcho,2011-04-29T22:46Z,Then change the letter in shortcut from the release to letter of the drive where you will keep the game.

,Cman1468,2011-05-03T03:55Z,"The hl2 doesnt work, it gives me some error that I dont have gameinfo.txt
and the shortcuts dont work ether
it just plays the startup video and closes"
,Sakura_J,2011-05-03T05:53Z,Thanks so much for this! :D
,BlackEcho,2011-05-03T06:29Z,"@Cman1468 
Don't press any buttons to skip the intro just the first time and i think it will not crash."
,Cman1468,2011-05-04T01:18Z,Tried that. I asked a friend and he said that Windows Vista Basic 32bit can't run Portal.
,Cman1468,2011-05-04T01:19Z,Witch is the OS I have.
,BlackEcho,2011-05-04T06:13Z,Ah too bad...sorry m8
,BlackEcho,2011-05-04T06:17Z,"I tested the game on Windows 7 Ultimate SP1,Windows XP SP3, And Windows Vista Enterprice SP2
No probs with them"
,MONSIEURVOYEUR,2011-05-05T08:20Z,"isn't the more obvious solution to not tamper with targets and such but to simply extract to the D: drive?
I did that and it worked like a charm-
One problem however is that in Portal Prelude, the NPCs are floating red errors-
any clue how to fix this?
I don't even know where to begin-
Thanks aheep though Black Echo"
,BlackEcho,2011-05-05T11:43Z,"@MONSIEURVOYEUR 
Yeah i know that problem and im sorry.Its missing textures cuz some modes use models and materials from hl2 hl2 ep1 and you just have to add them.
If you dont want to bother ill upload fixed version with even more mods and bonus maps."
