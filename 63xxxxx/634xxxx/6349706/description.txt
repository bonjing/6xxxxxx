Hereâ€™s a peek inside The John Lennon Singles Bag thatâ€™s out this Saturday on Record Store Day, April 17. Weâ€™ve seen costs advertised on the internet for this ranging from $17 to $23. (You can see pictures of the sleeves, postcards, the poster and the 45 hub in the slideshow at the bottom of the page.) :
A 45 RPM vinyl copy of John Lennon and the Plastic Ono Band â€œMotherâ€/Yoko Ono and the Plastic Ono Band â€œWhy.â€ Apple single 1827, printed on the green Apple label. The picture sleeve, as shown in the slideshow below, is heavier than the original.
A 45 RPM vinyl copy of John Lennon â€œWatching the Wheelsâ€/Yoko Ono â€œYes, Iâ€™m Your Angel.â€ The record contains the original picture sleeve with the picture of John and Yoko walking out of the Dakota taken by Paul Goresh. As with the â€œMotherâ€ single, itâ€™s printed on a heavier stock paper than the original. The record has a purple Capitol label that says â€œFor Jukeboxes Onlyâ€ on it.
A 45 RPM copy of John Lennon Plastic Ono Band â€œImagineâ€/â€Itâ€™s So Hard.â€ The record, Apple single 1940, is pressed on a gold/green Apple label with both apple pictures showing the outside of the apple, not outside and inside as the â€œMotherâ€ single does.
Three 3Ã—5 postcards of the pictures from the â€œWatching the Wheelsâ€ and â€œItâ€™s So Hardâ€ singles, plus the cover of the â€œImagineâ€ album.
A 24â€³ x 36â€³ poster of the Ivor Sharp picture of John and Yoko taken during the bed-in.
A yellow 45 RPM single adaptor hub with the words â€œApril 17, 2010,â€ â€œJohn Lennonâ€ and â€œRecord Store Dayâ€ on each spoke. Whatâ€™s a single adaptor hub? Anyone who collected 45s will know.
