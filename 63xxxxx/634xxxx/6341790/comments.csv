I'm not really into these types of movies, but I'd still like to thank you for your great effort here."
,mjs1974,2011-04-25T09:28Z,Thanks duvawind.  Im new to uploading stuff and I love the old horror films as well as the newer ones.  It took me a while to convert my dvd boxset so I hope people enjoy it!
,thepartycrasher,2011-10-30T18:32Z,"Wow! Fantastic torrent! I've never found half of these classics available anywhere! Please seed and help me share these cinematic treasures with people who think ""Twighlight"" is the peak of cinema..."
