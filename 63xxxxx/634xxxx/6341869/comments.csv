,vector1818,2011-04-25T04:12Z,"How can this be even near 480P with the size of 276.66 MIB? And is it real line audio or is it 
the same old fixed cam audio?"
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-04-25T09:09Z,"@vector
LiNE audio :)"
,banukaknight,2011-04-25T10:14Z,"tnx for this. 
1+ for the awsome size"
,frogshare,2011-04-25T12:31Z,"With all due respect, this sounds like cam audio. Anyway, it's still better than some of the 'cleaned' audios which have gulps and gaps. Adjust the equalizer a bit and it's watchable. Thanks!

A/V: 3.5/8"
,Moon.Lord,2011-04-25T14:02Z,thanks ......

,frogshare,2011-04-26T02:51Z,"Dear StyLishSaLH,

It didn't ruin the viewing pleasure. As I said, it's still better than all the other torrents I tried. They were all unwatchable, because their audio had gaps. Your release is the only one so far that is watchable. The reason why I thought it sounds like cam is due to a high level of mid-frequencies which causes the impression of a background noise. And I guess it's already in the source and not because of the bitrate. Because all your other encodings are always top-notch. By the way, I appreaciate your work very much. You do a great job and your encodings are very good at such file size. Thanks a lot! Keep it coming."
