Beware: This book does not have to do with business management (unless your business is grazing animals!) Still, it's very important stuff.

Review
"The new Holistic Management Handbook shows how healthy land leads to healthy profits.  It has in-depth how-to figures, complete with charts, graphs and pictures.  I found the chapter on creating your financial plan especially informative...You will profit, your land will profit, and the world in general will profit."

Product Description
Holistic management, as described by Allan Savory in the books "Holistic Resource Management" (Island Press, 1988) and the revised edition, "Holistic Management" (Island Press, 2001), has been practiced by thousands of people around the world to profitably restore and promote the health of their land through practices that mimic nature, and by many others who have sought a more rewarding personal or family life. "Holistic Management Handbook" offers a detailed explanation of the planning procedures presented in those books and gives step-by-step guidance for implementing holistic management on a ranch or farm. "Holistic Management" and "Holistic Management Handbook" are essential reading for anyone involved with land management and stewardship, and together represent an indispensable guide for individuals interested in making better decisions within their organizations or in any aspect of their personal or professional lives.
