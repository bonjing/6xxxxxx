,Rod321,2011-04-30T01:31Z,"I downloaded 'Battle.Los.Angeles[2011]DvDRip[Eng]-PiRaTeS'
from this guy and it was good so I am assuming this one will be.
I will advise later."
,Rod321,2011-04-30T04:43Z,"Thank you PiR3T3S,

Sync 10/10"
,logone69,2011-05-01T17:00Z,Great quality. I just wish it had the original aspect ratio 720x*** with Dolby Digital 5.1 instead of instead of 640x256 and mp3 2 channel. Not complaining as this is great quality for a torrent. Thanks again.
,skyhigh420,2011-05-02T09:00Z,"Hi I was wondering if anyone could help me I dont know much about this stuff yet. I've downloaded it through u torrent but im not sure what to do know could someone please help me

Thanks"
,alekdrake,2011-05-03T03:36Z,"Ive also downloaded some stuff from him and Ive had no problems. As for the newbie having issues Ill be nice though its pretty much common sense. Anyways bro all you have to do is go to the folder that your downloads go to and double click the movie. Mine is in c:/users/drake/downloads. This of course will be different depending on where the person preferrs there downloads to go. Ok so alot of the time Windows Media Player will play your movies as long as it has the right codecs. I use this, Windows Media Player Classic, and Nero 9. The Later one being my fav I cant stand Nero 10. I thinks its shit. My oppinion of course. Ok so lets say you use Windows Media Player to play this movie (by double clicking the movie file in your downloads location) and you get video but no sound. You need to right click the movie file and then click on properties and see what format your movie is. Once you know google (for example AVI Codec) and download the codec and after that you should be good. I hope Im explaining this right if there is anything wrong please correct me so people arent misled. What I did actually was downloaded the ""Combined Community Codec Pack"" you can google it and it also came with Windows Media Player Classic which once again my oppinion is actually better then the standard Windows media Player. Ok so I hope this help any newbs out there that have trouble getting video to work. Peace"
