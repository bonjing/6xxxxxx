BUD POWELL JAZZ GIANT
Label: Verve
Original Released: 1957
Format: Flac 

Easily one of Bud Powell's finest albums, Jazz Giant presents sessions from 1949 and '50 that find the revered bop pianist in a spare trio setting. With drummer extraordinaire Max Roach and either Ray Brown or Curly Russell on bass, Powell clearly revels in the spotlight, with his astoundingly deft and emotive playing showcased on both thrilling upbeat numbers ("Tempus Fugue-It") and wistful downbeat tunes ("I'll Keep Loving You"). For Powell aficionados, this disc is truly essential.
