Eve is a progressive rock album by The Alan Parsons Project. It was released in 1979 (see 1979 in music). Eve's focus is on women and men's attitudes towards them, and was notable as the only time a Project related recording featured lead female voices (Clare Torry and Lesley Duncan). Originally released in audio cassette and vinyl format; the two sides of the respective formats opposed each other thematically, castigating women on one side and praising them on the other. On later Alan Parsons releases, "Mr Time" (from Try Anything Once - Jacqui Copland) & " Call Of The Wild" (from The Time Machine - MÃ¡ire Brennan) featured lead female voices. The album Freudiana (intended to be the Project's eleventh album but released as a solo Eric Woolfson album) also featured lead female vocals. On this recording, the opening instrumental "Lucifer" was a major hit in Europe and the poppy "Damned If I Do" reached the US Top 30.
