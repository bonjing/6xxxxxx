Out of the pile of Easter Video's this was a breath of fresh air and some much needed fun from the usual pro VJ video suppliers.   I have made it May 2011's Power Play on all units of the International Music Services group which I run as a hobby and they will be playing it on the half hour every hour in an attempt to get this into the Charts around the world.

I have included the original Coasters Hit single as an mp3 audio file for a bit of extra fun and I hope you like the updated version too!
