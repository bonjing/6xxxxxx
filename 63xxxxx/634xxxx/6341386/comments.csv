,DECEiFER,2011-08-26T16:41Z,"Hi folks,

There's a typo in the list of hosts files needed.

""127.0.0.1 adobe.activate.com""

This will not work, and as this is a typo of what's supposed to be Adobe's primary activation URL, it will result in your key being discovered no later than the next launch of your Adobe program as being invalid. It should be:

""127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com""

------------------------------------

Here's the list with the correction:

127.0.0.1 adobe.activate.com
127.0.0.1 practivate.adobe.com 
127.0.0.1 ereg.adobe.com 
127.0.0.1 activate.wip3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 wip3.adobe.com 
127.0.0.1 3dns-3.adobe.com 
127.0.0.1 3dns-2.adobe.com 
127.0.0.1 adobe-dns.adobe.com 
127.0.0.1 adobe-dns-2.adobe.com 
127.0.0.1 adobe-dns-3.adobe.com 
127.0.0.1 ereg.wip3.adobe.com 
127.0.0.1 activate-sea.adobe.com 
127.0.0.1 wwis-dubc1-vip60.adobe.com
