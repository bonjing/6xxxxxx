Indie album by Christian \\\"Pop\\\" band Asher, released in 2006 and re-released in 2009. Their Myspace says pop, but it\\\'s more like 
rock or metal.
The band broke up after the re-release.


I noticed nobody uploaded it to TPB, and I am listening to it for probably the second time since receiving it a year or so ago. 
It\\\'s actually a pretty good album, so, enjoy!

Tracks:

1. Exhortation
2. Love\\\'s So Wrong
3. Enslaved
4. Fallen
5. The Shadow Hour
6. This Burden
7. Counterfeit
8. Paradox
9. Unavoidable
10. Omega

Oddly enough, I saw no copyright information on the disc or the insert...
good way to start off my first torrent... ;P
