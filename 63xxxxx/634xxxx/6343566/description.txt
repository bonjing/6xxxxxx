 Game notes
 ~~~~~~~~~~
 The highly anticipated sequel to 2007s Game of the Year, Portal 2 is a
 hilariously mind-bending adventure that challenges you to use wits over
 weaponry in a funhouse of diabolical science.
 Using a highly experimental portal device, you?ll once again face off
 against a lethally inventive, power-mad A.I. named GLaDOS.
 And this time you will not be alone. Meet an expanded cast of characters
 as you think your way through dangerous, never-before-seen areas of
 Aperture Laboratories.
 Break the laws of spatial physics in ways you never thought possible,
 with a wider variety of portal puzzles and an expansive story that spans
 a single player and co-operative game mode.
