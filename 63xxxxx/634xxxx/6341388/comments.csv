,FucHollywood,2011-04-28T05:09Z,Notice how he is the only one who tells me how legit this is where some ppl I know who can confirm dl at your own risk
,maddan10,2011-04-28T15:16Z,maybe people are still downloading this is a big file why don't you download it and confirm it ??  instead of saying that its not legit if you dont want it then don't wine about it its free ffs  
,FucHollywood,2011-04-29T16:08Z,Still not one VIP confirming this notice how this guy always answers back quickly to defend himself I smell a troganî
,lokolokomo,2011-04-30T10:05Z,"it's legit and RF,thanks maddan10,but having problem with virtual tennis 4 RF.disc unreadable,maybe AP25?,maybe maddan10 you have advise re. VT4?.it's by other uploader."
,maddan10,2011-04-30T13:27Z,have you run it by abgx360 ?
,maddan10,2011-04-30T14:53Z,@lokolokomo may i have the link to the game vt4

,FucHollywood,2011-05-01T04:55Z,Ill be the first 2 say I was wrong it's legit but u can never be 2 careful so 2 madden10 thx I was wrong
,samljer,2011-05-02T09:21Z,"@FucHollywood 
shut the fuk up you whining bitch.
Use ABGX like you should anyway and you
wouldnt be taking any risks anyway.

It will either be clean, Get fixed, or be unfixable.
ABGX will tell you what to do knob.

PS: The game checked out ok."
,atozlun,2011-05-10T22:05Z,The game works fine and its region free. Thanks maddan10
,atozlun,2011-05-10T22:07Z,The game works fine. Thanks maddan10
,Kristina1982,2012-02-16T04:06Z,"THIS IS NOT LEGIT..I downloaded this file and it screwed up my entire computer I had to reboot and lost all of my pictures and everything personal I had, that includes my kids bdays and everything.
If this person did this diliberately thats just disgusting, clearly have too much time on your hands. I have downloaded stuff before and no problems. Wasnt until I download from this piece of SH*T that I had a problem so I would NOT DOWNLOAD FROM HIM EVER!!!!!"
,manbearpigXCAGE,2012-02-20T00:19Z,"Kristina1982, you are a liar. This cannot harm your computer BECAUSE IT DOES NOT RUN ON YOUR COMPUTER. The only executable file in a 360 rip can only be executed by an XBOX 360. Unless someone embedded a .jar in it, and you were dumb enough to try to run it in a java enviroment for some unfeasable reason, or they made it a .exe and for some fucking reason you thought running it on your computer would make it suddenly appear on your XBOX, there is no possible way this could be anything more than just not working."

,Manson1973,2012-03-28T05:25Z,"Nooob question..  I'd buy you all a beer if I could.   But, it's my frist time burning a 360 game.   

I downloaded, and then burned at 8x, on a +r drive, Using Power ISO.  My xbox is NOT modded.  I thought this game didn't need that.
   I've read up on it a bit.  but, still confused.

Do I need to Mod it to get this game to work?

Do I need to burn at a lower rate?

Will Power ISO do it?  or do I need IMG-BURN?

Do I need to get involved with ""stealthing""???

Do I need to pay for the ABGX program on extabit?

Sorry for dumb questions."
,maddan10,2012-04-19T02:47Z,"@Manson1973
you would need your Xbox flashing before you put this game in you xbox360 if you didn't flash it it couldn't work hope thiss helps "
