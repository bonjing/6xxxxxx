Have you ever hidden cash or a bill from your spouse? Do you think your partner is telling you the truth about his or her debt? A recent study found that one in three people admit that they lie to their spouse about money. Dr. Philâ€™s guest, Crystine, says sheâ€™s told her husband, Tom, so many lies, she canâ€™t keep track of them, and sheâ€™s scared Tom will divorce her when he finds out the truth. Is Crystine ready to spill the beans about her money secrets and will she change her deceitful ways? And, Debbie admits she shopped herself into debt and out of her past three marriages. She says she could open a store with the amount of clothing and accessories she has in her house -- many with the tags still attached -- and canâ€™t go two days without buying something new. Her boyfriend, Ron, says their relationship canâ€™t move forward until she gets her shopping under control. Are you guilty of financial infidelity? Find out how you compare to Dr. Philâ€™s studio audience when it comes to spending habits!
