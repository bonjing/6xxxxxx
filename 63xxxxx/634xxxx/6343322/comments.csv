Anyway thanks for the repack."
,256melrod,2011-04-26T18:21Z,how in the hell do you unpack every time i try it tells me it needs some other rar part
,imranjavaid,2011-04-26T20:00Z,keygen shows virus on my computer
,jatin_7G,2011-04-26T23:05Z,No place to input the key. Only Buy Now button.
,Corwii,2011-05-08T19:11Z,"How can a virus be accidentally released? You did it on purpose. Plus I cant seem to even activate it, says it cant connect to server. "
,Corwii,2011-05-08T19:15Z,"Really, How does a virus get released without the consent of the creator? Don't lie about it."
,ckersnikkers,2011-05-13T14:11Z,"Dudes, it even says so in the readme/nfo: 
""Note: Accidently, we included a virus infected keygen. Let's hope this will not happen again! ;) Sorry, folks...""

Now if I'm good at reading sarcasm, this is soaked with it. If you don't dare to use the keygen anyway, just use the key in the comment somewhere above me."
,horvardson,2011-05-20T00:36Z,"This keygen use characteristic code which is identified as virus. In fact it is not a virus. 

Execute keygen as administrator, so it can register additional stuff for completing register process."
,zoranmit2003,2011-05-21T14:32Z,"I can not activate program, write  it can not connect to server.!!!
Keygen do nor work"
[V],scene4all,2011-06-15T12:47Z,"@ckersnikkers, The info about the infected keygen is about CORE's last release.

@zoranmit2003, If you get the error ""couldnt not connect to server"" that's coz you need to run the keygen as admin.
"
,slouwrou,2011-06-16T15:47Z,"1. extract
2. run the keygen as administrator
3. there, click on ""generate""  -leave that window open
4. run setup.exe, install the shit
5. enter the serial number (copy and paste works)
6. click on activate - success
7. close the keygen

And, PowerDVD wil lrefuse to work if it finds Daemon Tools installed."
