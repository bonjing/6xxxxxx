    No longer crashes after 11000 submitted shares.
    No longer crashes if server goes down for a short time (i.e. the endless string of long polls).
    Invalid/Stale is now a counter, and not a percentage.
    Reduced the rate at which invalid shares occur from overlapped work.
    Windows binaries are packed to cut number of required files down to 4.
    Fixed some long polling issues regarding Invalid/Stale submissions.
    Other minor changes and code updates.
    Miner maintained an average of 94% EFF, 3 I/S and 30 EMP after 100 submitted shares in 5/5 tests on both HD 6970 and HD 5770.
    Revision 1: High CPU usage issue resolved.
    Revision 2: Resolved issue with traceback error from float division after long disconnect.
    Revision 3: Fixed issue with 'hardware verification failed!' causing miner to close when hash == target.


As always, our development and testing environment is hardly a perfect reflection of what will occur in widespread use, so please report any and all bugs to us as soon as possible so we can get them resolved.
