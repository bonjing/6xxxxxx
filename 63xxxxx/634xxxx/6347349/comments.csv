As a young man, Jacob Jankowski (Pattinson) was tossed by fate onto a rickety train that was home to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. It was the early part of the Great Depression, and for Jacob (Holbrook), now ninety, the circus world he remembers was both his salvation and a living hell. A veterinary student just shy of a degree, he was put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie.
It was there he met Marlena, (Witherspoon) the beautiful equestrian star married to August (Waltz), the charismatic but twisted animal trainer. Here he also met Rosie, an untrainable elephant and the only hope for this third-rate traveling show."

,charlik,2011-04-28T05:49Z,Quality on this is very very low. It is choppy and the color is horrible. It looks like it was filmed at about 10fps and then massively over compressed.
