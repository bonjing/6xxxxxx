*Note1: Singles have the exclusive content only, the rest is somewhere else in the discog, in others words its all here, with very few duplicated files.

**Note2: They didn't want to do a greatest hits, but the record company made them, also includes 2 new tracks.

***Note3: This isn't a Foo Fighters release, but rather really only Dave appears on the album as a guest vocalist and drummer for this 1 song.

So there ya have it, 42 releases of Foo Fighters goodness, all neatly tagged and bagged.

Enjoy HMD3
