                           DESCRiPTiON 

 New series. Jeremy Kyle spends 12 weeks at the Defence School of Transport in Leconfield
 East Yorkshire, following new drivers assigned to 110 Squadron, part of the Royal Logistic
 Corps, which trains soldiers for the front line. He begins by meeting young servicemen and
 women at the centre and gets on board flagship vehicle the Mastiff to learn first-hand how
 it helps save lives in Afghanistan.

                                 
                                 Enjoy!
