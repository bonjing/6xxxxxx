Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory  S04E04

â€˜Dodging Devil Donkeysâ€™ 

After a pickup game of dodge ball in the Fantasy Factory, Rob wants to put together a team to enter an extremely competitive dodge ball tournament in Los Angeles. Chanel's toughness is called into question after an incident on the court, and Rob challenges her to prove herself. He offers her the chance to be the voice of a character in his animated cartoon, the "Wild Grinders," but only if she toughens up and skateboards down a treacherous hill.
