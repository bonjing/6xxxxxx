,donx009,2011-04-26T03:19Z,"Do we have to always reinstall the program or can we just paste the new ""Crack"" to the avast file???"
[T],locobot12,2011-04-26T06:06Z,"@donx009

If u paste the crack without reinstalling the proper program version avast wont open at all!!
even if u could manage to open avast.. it will fuck up ur pc!

so do a clean install first before crack!!"
,skycool,2011-04-26T08:06Z,"Here is what i did and it works for me only so far:

I am using avast! internet security v6.0.1000 uploaded by locobot12 previously. installed in windows 7 32bit/x86.

1. Manual update through avast itself to v6.0.1091

2. Restart after update

3. Boot into safe mode

4. Paste crack file into avast installation folder

5. Restart again

6. Boot normally this time

7. Check subscription status: ""active""

8. Valid until 14-March-2050

9. Done.

Thanks locobot12 for this great antivirus!! :)"

,skycool,2011-04-26T23:29Z,"@donx009

you didn't follow exactly the instructions?

as if you followed, avast should work perfectly like normal. read all instructions provided first before you start doing any installation!"
,wullie7362,2011-04-27T03:23Z,"To everyone who has problems with this, please follow instructions to the letter and you will not have any problems, it worked for me first time!
A big thank you to Locobot12."
,sadfate2wander,2011-04-27T03:41Z,"Thanks locobot12...

Tips:

If you cannot disable the self defense module and can not find AvastSvc at the Windosws task manager restart your pc after intallation 

Note: that there should be a confirmation when disabling the self defense module.

If you cannot apply the crack ashbase.dll rename the orginal ashbase.dll


"
,julz0428,2011-04-27T09:09Z,to replace the asshbase.dll with the crack use the safemode its easy and 100 percent you will replace it............

Avast won't start up when i start my pc, any idea how i can fix that??? ty




the reason itsnot running in start up because you cancel it.  just go to msconfig 'startup"" and find "" avast' check the box click apply and ok then reboot your pc ...."
,julz0428,2011-04-27T09:21Z,"@ donx009

,seebee0509,2011-05-03T03:23Z,"@skykool from page 1

I followed your instructions. It Works! Thanks!
I never thought it would work like that. the ashbase.dll is the most important part. The avast! IS or Pro can be downloaded at thier sites. 

(to Others) If you want to update program directly through avast!, follow his (skycool) steps on page1"
,samgold6,2011-05-03T07:35Z,"Nice thks. Have successfully installed APro.
Just to clarify, the instructions say.. ""Install avast.IS.6.0.1091 or avast.AV.Pro.6.0.1000 (not both!) in trial mode.""
This might seem like a silly question but does this mean I must choose one or the other?, I cant install both?, whats the difference?.. Which one is best? Thks in advance!"

Guys try to stick with the instructions ... Sometimes if u deviate ,it might crash ur OS. dont come back here complaining.
The crack works for only one particular version."
,hazy_l24,2011-05-04T10:55Z,why it didn't work in Vista.... I've done all the Instructions but any of that won't work... everytime I run the Setup.exe it's stops... what should I do??

,inzideout,2011-05-07T14:48Z,"At last! After many installs, uninstalls and on the point of giving up, this is what did it for me... With great respect and many thanks to locobot, I offer this slight adaptation which does NOT use copy and paste.
Exactly as the man says, clear all traces of Avast or any other av prog then clean registry. I did this in safe mode which allows you to really get rid. In normal mode, download trial Avast IS or Pro and remember to disconnect the internet when the Installation wizard comes up. Once installed, restart in safe mode then do the task manager and self defence bit as per locobot. Next navigate to your newly downloaded Avast ashbase.dll and delete it, but don't close the folder. Now with the magic Crack folder opened alongside it, drag and drop the Crack ashbase.dll file across into the now vacant spot in the Avast folder. Close folder(s) then re-enable Avast self defence and check Task Manager processes are OK. Done! Now restart normally. Remember to follow exactly the activate trial version and update instructions.
Once again locobot, Thanks, you really are the Top Man!"

pro or is??"
,GigaBoii,2011-07-05T18:56Z,"Not sure which one is better. But personally I am using a different free firewall from a trusted source. That way I can have multiple layers of real time and unattended protection. Because anti-virus alone is not enough. You need to have boot time scanning, and also a strong firewall, and system defense mechanism in place. In this case I use a pirated AV (Avast) and a Free firewall (Comodo Firewall + Defense+ ONLY) Their AV isnt that great anyways. So its up to you. But be sure to do plenty of research. All of this software is going into a install disc so that when you install windows 7 its automatically got all paid software, and protection. Multiple Layers, is just always better. For example Google Chrome! Try to hack this web browser! Muthafucka! Good luck out there!"
