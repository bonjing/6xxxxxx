Award winning journalist Gary Bellamy is waiting for your calls, as Down The Line invites listeners to call Radio 4's groundbreaking phone-in programme.

This comedy, created by the team behind The Fast Show, parodies radio phone-in shows.

The show's host, the keen but dim Gary Bellamy, fields calls from experts, idiots, bigots and nutters about a different topic each week.



www.comedy.co.uk Review: 

When it was launched in May 2006, Down The Line caused a massive media stir. The first episode was such an accurate parody of a bad phone-in show that many listeners were fooled into believing it was genuine, and thus complained to the BBC (see the press clippings section of this guide for more on this).

The BBC helped create this subterfuge by publishing a fake profile for Gary Bellamy on the Radio 4 website; setting up a phone number for the show (with a message saying that the line was busy); and dropping the credits to hide the fact the callers were actually actors.

It wasn't until almost a week later that the people behind the show were un-veiled as well known comedy actors
Since then, the buzz around the show has died down, but the programme continues on with a loyal fan base.
