,avatar_24,2011-04-27T07:32Z,Try to save his head...lol
,avatar_24,2011-04-27T07:33Z,upss..i mean skull
,SeamusDempsey,2011-04-27T23:57Z,"This is NOT passworded.
set up & serial work fine

Thanks "
,wullie7362,2011-04-28T02:31Z,"I never said it was passworded can't you read?
I said when i SCANNED it with my security system it won't let me because the file is password protected."
,wullie7362,2011-04-28T02:33Z,I also noticed ChattChitto has not replied!
,wullie7362,2011-04-28T02:44Z,The reason why i want to scan the files is because i had a program of yours a while back that had a trojan in it.
,SeamusDempsey,2011-04-28T08:14Z,"Came up clean with Eset but to be honest I didnt read the log file. heres just one entry to the log,

D:\Software\Others\WinArchiver.exe Âť ZIP Âť autorun.exe - error - password-protected file"
[V],ChattChitto,2011-05-04T22:29Z,"@wullie7362
Users know me and trust me.
If you don't then you can choose another release... there are plenty out there :)"
,wullie7362,2011-05-05T03:05Z,"I've been downloading your software torrent for quite a while and i always thought you packaged them brilliantly but as i said i had one that fucked up my computer a while back.
It wasn't protected by a password then but i failed to scan before installing because it was ChattChitto and i trusted your torrents.
Obviously someone had placed a trojan in your software, i don't know if you were aware of this, it was tune up utilities 2009 or 2010 and ever since I've been cautious.
Is that the reason why you have protected your files with a password?
If it is then please accept my apologies as i know you put a lot of work in to your torrents."
[V],ChattChitto,2011-05-12T23:24Z,"No one can access or add files to my torrents.
You might have downloaded a fake release named as ""ChattChittoRG"". but definitely not from ChattChittoRG.
Only download from Official ChattChittoRG accounts such as this one."
,wullie7362,2011-05-13T02:33Z,"I will be able to distinguish your torrents from fake in future by scanning with antivirus and if your files are protected then i know its genuine.

Sorry for accusing you of having something to hide it's just that your the only uploader to protect their files with a password.

Great idea!"
,edscape,2011-05-30T22:16Z,Works great. Thanks a mil.
,bbzlov,2011-06-04T14:06Z,Another trusted torrent by ChattChitto. Easy install and works flawlessly.
,long4U92592,2011-06-17T18:43Z,"If you have any doubts of the install, just get the install version of WinArchiver at http://www.winarchiver.com/download.htm and then use the serials provided.

Thanks CC!"
