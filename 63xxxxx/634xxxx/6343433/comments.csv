,Cattiv0,2011-04-27T09:45Z,"""The program can't start because wxmsw28u_core_vc_custom.dll is missing from your computer.""

Anyone know what to do?"

It might be because you replace the dll's too. I am playing with my friends since monday with no problem at all. The trick is to replace only the .exe with the cracked one. replacing the dll's cause all sorts of problem for the multi."

You need to download the initial game, these are just updates.
