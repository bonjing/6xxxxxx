"
,chukked,2011-04-25T20:24Z,"Thanks ADHDerby, you are kind of a brand ambessador to powerdvd.

one request is it possible to tweak play speed setting to .90 and .80 as many time the dialogue are so fast that we need to slow down play speed to .90 or .80 as of now most of the time i have to use videolan which supports this feature.

Thanks once again for being a trust and reliable to depend upon :)"
[T],ADHDerby,2011-04-25T21:26Z,"@ everyone who said thanks: You're welcome. :) 

@ everyone who get the grey box: Which Windows version do you use?

@ chukked: Right click on the playing movie,.. in the Fast Forward menu you can select 0.5x and 0.75x"
,Qbaz,2011-04-25T23:01Z,"@ADHDerby - I use Win7 Ultimate x86 with admin rights.

[T],ADHDerby,2011-04-26T14:31Z,"@ Codcat: MSClientPasswdGenerator.exe is a standard part of the installation process. Install the trial version if you want to check it,.. you'll see that it uses the same file."
,chukked,2011-04-27T10:08Z,"Thank you ADHDerby for reply.
yes! play speed can be adjusted to .75 but that is too slow and dialogues sound like zambie talk :(

play speed of .90 is very crucial to me as most of the time i play with .90 only so videolan is only option even if powerdvd is so good but of no use if i can not adjust the play speed to suit my listening pace.

kindly provide/ point to, a tweak which enables powerdvd to play at .90 speed.

P.S. working for me ferfectly on win 7 sp1 32bit"
,myomyo,2011-04-27T11:18Z,hello anyone could tell me this version can be used with iphone remote or not...all the installation goes well with me...other features are perfect as well but i cant use it with ipone remote
,MistryWho,2011-04-28T04:06Z,"Works fine for me, Win 7 SP1 64bit.

And does anyone know how to select a whole group of music to play, like sort the music by artisit and play the whole album. right know im just draging a square around the whole group i want. thought there'd be a simpler way "
,Ganddi,2011-04-28T16:25Z,"ADHDerby: Thank you very much.

I downloaded from other but they didn't work for me, and for a moment thought you were not uploading any more since I was looking for PDVD 10.

Works flawless for me.
Windows 7 64bit"
[T],ADHDerby,2011-04-29T13:09Z,"@ chukked: I'll look into it, but I can't promise anything, it's probably hard-coded in an executable or dll file.

@ leech69: If you're paranoid, you can extract the executable with WinRar or 7Zip. I never add or change an executable or dll file. The only things that I change are configuration files and the pre-activated license file."
,chukked,2011-04-29T14:00Z,"Thank ADHDerby, kindly look into it, I will keep checking here :)"

,undermaker,2011-05-01T07:29Z,"install ""tip"" :) you can activate powerdvd in offline...put these to registry and you can use serials to activation...

 x64 OS:

after that, you can put serial in offline mode...

,Qbaz,2011-05-01T20:04Z,"@ADHDerby or anyone: Do You have any ideas on how to eliminate the gray box?
@undermaker: Please... ;) I will not install Windows for one program."
,dickpeters,2011-05-03T18:45Z,"I installed this on Win 7 Ultimate x64 and didn't have the gray box but I didn't have any control over the controls like play, stop, ff, and rewind.  Comparing this to 10, when playing Video TS file, on 10 you could just click Video TS without opening the folder and hit play and it would play the movie.  With 11 when trying it and just clicking Video TS, it wouldn't let me hit play and I had to open the directory and then I could only select one file and hit play if I remember correctly which then I realized that I had no control with the functions.

I did not uninstall 10 because I thought that this would overwrite it so maybe that caused a problem and maybe it didn't so after having the issues, just deleted 11 and still had 10.  Never did try inserting a DVD though and seeing what would happen with it?"
,dickpeters,2011-05-03T18:45Z,Forgot to mention thanks though for your work!  Hopefully a fix will be out in the coming release.

@ Exodus1992: It plays MKVs without much pixellation here, but it depends on the quality of the MKV. You can try updating your video card drivers or wait for an updated version of PowerDVD."
