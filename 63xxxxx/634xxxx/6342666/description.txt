Dark Side of the Moon, originally released in 1973,
is one of those albums that is discovered anew by each generation of rock listeners.
This complex, often psychedelic music works very well because 
Pink Floyd doesn't rush anything; the songs are mainly slow to mid-tempo, 
with attention paid throughout to musical texture and mood. 
The sound effects on songs like "On the Run," 
"Time" and especially "Money" 
(with sampled sounds of clinking coins and cash registers turned into rhythmic accompaniment) 
are impressive, especially when we remember that 1973 was before the advent of digital recording techniques. 
This is probably Pink Floyd's best-known work, and it's an excellent place to start if you're new to the band.
