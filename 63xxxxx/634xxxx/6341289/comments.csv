,amisnaru,2011-04-26T14:11Z,"Would be better to fully seed this before moving onto the 2002 torrent, now both will be slow I'm afraid.

Great upload though, this is my favorite year of WWF/WWE by far.

Looking forward to the SmackDown 2001 pack, hope that's next in line?"
,Dan16ist,2011-04-26T17:32Z,"im still searching the Smackdown pack,but i only find some episodes"
,wazz000,2011-04-29T04:53Z,"Hello it me wazz. who uploaded wwf 1996-1999 on piratebay and demon noid.

Dan16ist let me giv u a few tips

1: Register on demon noid and make a fresh new torrent. upload the same torrent to piratebay and demon noid

2: Seed 1 torrent at a time

3: U will seed 24/7 and u will seed at least 100gb

ALSO DELETE THESE 2001 AND 2002 TORRENTS OFF PIRATEBAY

^^TRUST ME^^"
,amisnaru,2011-04-29T18:00Z,"No, don't listen to that guy.

This torrent is working fine even if slow.
I'm helping with 24/7 upload at 450 kB/s.

Although I still wish you seeded this before the 2002 torrent."
,wazz000,2011-04-29T18:22Z,"@ amisnaru buddy. i was givin Dan16ist som tips and advice. since i bin uploadin wwf torrents for the past year. And i reccomend Dan16ist to upload to demonoid and piratebay. Ull get loads leachers jus like that. 

Demonoid is a public tracker jus like piratebay

Dan16ist if u need a demonoid invite. Ill try giv u one. Do u hav msn or aim ?"
,Dan16ist,2011-04-29T18:45Z,i have msn its ultimatedaredevil_15@hotmail.com
,anirbogo,2011-04-30T03:55Z,"@wazz after u uploaded on demonoid, the speed of download of ur torrentz has reduced drastically.... i guess ur old way was better...."
,wazz000,2011-04-30T12:40Z,"@ anirbogo buddy wat u expect. The only ppl who seeds is the uploader ( I seeded 100gb) and the kind ppl :D

and wat do u mean by ĂÂ ""i guess ur old way was better"""
,anirbogo,2011-04-30T18:36Z,@wazz.... i dunno man... i downloaded ur raw 1998 n 1999 packs n they had awesum speed....but unable to download ur raw 1997 as speed is very low...jus cant figure out why?
,wazz000,2011-04-30T20:56Z,@ anirbogo LoL man. Theres tons of ppl downloadin my wwf torrents. y dont u jus download raw 1997. The speed will eventually pick up. Torrents r like that buddy.
,gauravmeeena,2011-05-03T09:55Z,Hey Dan16ist Is it me or this torrent has no sound?? 
,Dan16ist,2011-05-03T16:30Z,"It has sound,you have to wait until the download is completed to get the full file"
,anirbogo,2011-05-04T11:51Z,@wazz....man plz make a new torrent for ur raw 1997...unable to download it...
,amisnaru,2011-05-09T08:59Z,"Come back, seeders!

I could seed if you only let me finish first."
,amisnaru,2011-05-13T18:05Z,"Come on, man.

I've uploaded 440 GB of this torrent, I think I deserve to get something in return :d"
,Dan16ist,2011-05-14T12:34Z,"i have more torrents to seed not only here but on private trackers aswell,i seeded 100gb there were 5 seeders when i left,i warned everyone that if you let my torrents die i wouldnt re-upload them"
,amisnaru,2011-05-15T19:17Z,"Well that's just stupid.

You could put this on a speed limit and upload slowly to those of us who are willing to wait for weeks.

And you didn't warn us in this torrent's comments.

Oh, and you only seeded this to under 3 people if you had seeded 100gb.
That's just not enough by any good uploader's standards."
,dwmer,2011-05-21T01:18Z,"What a dirtbag, Im at 63% an Ive uploaded 3x what Ive downloaded.  Fuckin lame, dont post anymore of your garbage torrents here.  "
,amisnaru,2011-05-21T14:13Z,"Well, there seems to be 2 seeders in the swarm now, just not connected to them for some reason."
,grizzmahr,2011-06-17T21:32Z,does any1 have this torrent dlded if theres any1 that is willing to upload this torrent email me at grizzmahr72@aim.com
,rmz3625,2011-08-09T21:41Z,wazz!!! can yu upload raw is war 2000??????????????????????????
,bennbones,2011-08-12T11:24Z,please seed :( please please please this is the first time i have had to beg people are usually so considerate but this time i have no help. my DL has been dead for 2 days now and i was 65% please help a damsel in distress 
,bennbones,2011-08-23T02:05Z,I dont know if my file is actually downloading or not. It gives me an eta or 2 or 3 years but my DL is still at 57.6% It would be really awesome if someone would seed this file for all of us. Everytime I look at the DL it says that there are more and more people trying to get it but there is no one to seed.. The last time I commented my file began to actually download so i guess that it was because you  saw people that were still wanting it you decided to help :D? Im hoping you will see this and feel bad and want to help lol When my file is done i will seed! i promise! for atleast a week. Please help Dan16ist!! I will be forever in your debt haha 
,bigste88,2011-09-14T23:18Z,this has totally stopped at 63% has anybody finished downloading this to send over to me on msn?
