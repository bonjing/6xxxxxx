Comedian Jim Norton pushes every envelope and crosses every line with his trademark brand of over-the-top humor. In this HBO special from Washington, D.C.'s Lincoln Theatre, the "Opie and Anthony" co-host tackles celebrities, dating and prostitutes. Norton artfully infuses his hilarious material with just enough edgy truth to make audiences squirm even as they laugh.
