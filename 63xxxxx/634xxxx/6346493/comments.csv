,crashteam,2011-04-28T01:01Z,"Not fake. I haven't downloaded it all but was able to play front in vlc. V=9-10 A=9-10. Could be a DVD rip as title says. Almost DVD quality anyway for a 700mb avi. Considering a lot of others reporting bad audios, this is good. thanx PiR4T3S"
,Rod321,2011-04-28T06:35Z,"Thank you PiR4T3S

A 9/10
V 9/10
Sync 10/10"
,virul6345,2011-04-28T09:57Z,"Very watchable 
V:8 (near dvdrip)
A:7 (sometimes a little out of sync and volume drops from time to time but not a big deal)
M:7 (nowhere near as bad as some reviews lead me to believe ""black hawk down with aliens"" is a pretty good description)"
,blusniffer,2011-05-06T09:30Z,Same R5 as all the rest i've downloaded with crackly audio sporadically!
,Ikouze,2011-05-07T22:51Z,"The torrent is not fake. The video quality is actually pretty good though. The audio is out of sync at times also.
