,tyront,2011-05-08T12:35Z,"Thanks for uploading

Just downloaded it, works well on my samsung by producing half a screen images on the left hand and right hand of the screen. The 3d on this movie is quite impressive and the film itself is not that bad either

also worth noting as I have been downloading a lot of 3d films lately and appently this is a confusing subject.

Will only work on special 3dtv and will not work with glasses used in cinemas or with the coloured glasses supplied with some films (think it's red and green) "
,JOEY3D,2011-05-08T13:24Z,Tyront yes it can be confusing at first there are 3 types of 3d. active 3d is your samsung tv which need active shutter glasses to work they are battery powered. next is polerized 3d which is the 3d at the cinema the glasses are not battery powered as each side of the glasses is polerized to block out the image its not suppose to see. and last is the old red and blue glasses 3d cant remember it proper name thats the 3d bit done. next i do not think you can take a camcorder in to the cinema and record a 3d movie to rip. you have to wait till it comes out on bluray remove the copywrite protection then convert it to half sbs its a long process but it can be done hope this helps you and others like you
