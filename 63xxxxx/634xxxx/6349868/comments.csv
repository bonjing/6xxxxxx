,ElusianGhost,2011-05-04T22:26Z,does this version work any better than the others? Can you actually play it or do you become a pro at building a character to then watch it blow up in your face?
,omardlt1,2011-05-06T07:29Z,"This should work fine. It took me forever to find a working Vista-Fix and other components that would ensure proper operation. The only slight bug I find with it is that after loading a game or watching a cut-scene it may go to a black screen but you'll still get audio. I haven't yet figured out a fix for this but it goes away by simply pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL and then just hitting ""cancel"" or going back into the game."
