Product Description

"If you are an unschooler, this book will be a joyful affirmation ... if you are still a little unclear about the history and philosophy of deschooling, here is a perfect introduction."--Kerlin Richter, Hip Mama

Debates about education often revolve around standardized testing, taxes and funding, teacher certificationâ€”everything except how to best help kids develop learning skills. Everywhere All the Time presents an array of historical and contemporary alternatives to traditional schooling, demonstrating that childrenâ€™s capacity to learn decreases as soon as they enter bureaucratic, institutional facilities.

Census data in the United States alone places the number of home-schooled children at five hundred thousand. Trends point toward an increasing skepticism of the ability of public schoolsâ€”and private ones, based on similar pedagogyâ€”to give kids what they need to be healthy, self-directed life learners. Major themes in this book include: childrenâ€™s self-directed learning, encouraging community-building and participation from parents in the learning process, critical thinking for active engagement and democratic self-governance, and alleviating the negative psychological effects of traditional schooling methods. It also includes the voices and artwork of alternatively schooled children themselves.

From Leo Tolstoy, Ivan Illich, and Emma Goldman to John Taylor Gatto, John Holt, and Grace Llewellyn, Matt Hern has compiled an impressive cast of educational pioneers to aid parents, kids, and teachers in the quest for effective learning strategies.

Matt Hern lives in Vancouver with his partner and daughters. He directs the Purple Thistle Centre (an alternative-to-school community center), is a founder of Vancouver Car-Free Day, is the author of Deschooling Our Lives and Field Day, and lectures widely. His writings have been published on six continents and in many languages.
