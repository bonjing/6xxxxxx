I have a max up speed of 80kb/s and I will seed this forever (like all my uploads), but it will take ages for others to enjoy it if I'm the only one seeding it! Again, I have found these episodes from different sites and they are the real deal, I just want to make it easier for everyone to get :-) Thanks, Gaz"
,missfj20,2011-04-28T03:38Z,Excellent! Thank-you!!!!!!

,GaryBradbury,2011-04-30T01:13Z,No worries! It drives you crazy looking for stuff that you would think would be posted straight away! I have uploaded episodes 11 & 12 and will post the last 2 when they are out and I happen to find them :-)

Thanks a million from Australia.
Keep em coming :).

My Uncle in Margate is exactly like Mark. I think they actually rip my Uncle off, even the they say its real, he is too much like him.
They call my uncle the Wild Stallion."
