           Paula, (Renee O'Connor) an inspector for the Historic          
           Trust, wraps up a successful and important project in the      
           upper Midwest. On her way home to Chicago, she gets a          
           call from her office and is asked to check out a new           
           applicant. It's on her way anyway, and even though it's        
           late on Friday, she takes a quick detour and heads to the      
           site of once proud steamship along an industrial               
           waterfront. The ships 400 foot black form looms against        
           the sky, and collects dead fish in stagnant water near         
           the pier. Moments after her arrival, her car is seriously      
           disabled and her life is about to change forever. In the       
           chaos that follows, she meets up with the self appointed       
           caretaker, Vigs (Larry Joe Campbell) who is the odd            
           caretaker on the ship. Making the best of a bad                
           situation, she takes him up on his offer to spend the          
           night in one of the cramped but historic staterooms. He        
           invites her to dinner and bad beer. She gets sick from         
           the food and retires to her room to sleep, but is              
           awakened constantly by startling and compelling commotion      
           that leads her to all points on this dark and frightening      
           ship. In the end, she discovers the truth about herself,       
           and her life will never be the same.
