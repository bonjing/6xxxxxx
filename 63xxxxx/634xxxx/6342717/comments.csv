,Goldernie,2011-07-17T13:05Z,"Hi, Is this ""Revival of Evangelion""?

Does it include ""death"" and/or ""rebirth""?

Does it include a recap of the whole series?

Sorry, the whole episode thing is kinda confusing :/"

This is ""End of Evangelion"", a movie detailing the events at the end of the main series. It effectively replaces episodes 25 and 26.

""Rebuild of Evangelion"" is a reboot of the series in the form of 4 movies, 2 of which have been released."
,airbuilder7,2011-10-02T23:05Z,"Awesome quality. I originally saw it through a Blockbuster rental, but their pressing was crap. Watching the 2.667 Gig version is like seeing the movie again for the first time. 

One problem: I'm using VLC, and the subtitles files to translate the Kanji don't seem to work. The VLC Video menu shows Track 1 and Track 2 of English subtitles, but (for example at 21:25 in the film) selecting either one seems to have no effect. Is there something I'm missing / need to manually select?  "
