,Ataractic,2011-04-25T18:19Z,90 seeders- but utorrent doesn't pick even one. still at 0.0 after 12 hours of adding the torrent.. what might be the problem?
[T],MelloYello,2011-04-25T22:19Z,"@Everyone - your welcome.
@Ataractic- I just checked and I'm not having any problems seeding. Just try maybe restart your computer and reload the torrent.  That's what I would do first."
