,thelung,2011-04-29T05:32Z,hey you fucking asshole!!!  why do you post this shit????  YOUR SOFTWARE SAID IT WAS REPORTING MY IP ADDRESS FOR PIRACY AND THEN TRASHED MY OS!!!  YOU FUCKING DICK!!!  IF I CAN FIND OUT WHO YOU ARE I'M GOING TO DESTROY YOUR FUCKING FACE YOU GODDAM WORTHLESS PIECE OF SHIT!!!!!!  
,Dark_knight11502,2011-05-14T10:18Z,it doesn't take a PI to figure out that the guy that uploaded this crap is the same guy that left the first comment=== EpicPirate55... good luck finding him and destroying his face. 
,Dark_knight11502,2011-05-16T19:33Z,I went ahead and installed the software and sure enough it started a million pop up and went ahead and did a force shut down on my computer. I think the software is supposed to be some kind of prank from the moron that uploaded it. I did a full anti virus scan prior to running the program and it turned up clean. I also did a restore point as well too just to be safe. I would like to mention that the moron that uploaded the program instructs you to unzip the file to a folder that you would have to create on your desktop and then he instructs you to run the program. it doesnt install anything on your computer. after I went ahead and started my computer on safe mode and deleted the folder from my desktop and restored my computer to the restore point I created. after the computer started I went ahead and did a full virus scan and it came up clean. my computer is running perfect without a problem. REMEMBER TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!
,Dark_knight11502,2011-05-16T19:36Z,you may want to ask why I downloaded this software in the first place? curiosity got the best of me and had to know. if you unzip the file everything looks legit. BUT BEWARE!!! :0) 
,EpicPirate55,2011-09-14T00:56Z,Comments fake probably to stop people from downloading. Notice that the users that made those comments have not even uploaded anything themselves.
,gsmartinez2,2011-09-29T18:09Z,"Sorry EpicPirate55. The other comments are true. Your upload has been compromised. That is if you uploaded a clean file with out malicious intent. All .dx file in your upload have been populated with the words ""Fuck You"". The exe file does give the information related in the other comments and tries to connect to some web site. When in can't do that it loops trying to do so. By the way I am a PI. I could find you if needed."
