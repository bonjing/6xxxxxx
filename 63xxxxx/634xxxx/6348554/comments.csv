,sedeinco,2011-05-20T06:02Z,"clunk11.  Please stop spreading misinformation.

1. This will NOT brick anything. It runs on PC. It edits Mii binary files which can then be uploaded to your Wii. I have not included the tools to do that in this torrent. You will have to find those yourself.

2. Source code is included. It is trivial to read if you have any coding experience, and if you don't trust the binaries you can recompile yourself. MingW or Cygwin gcc  is all you will need.
