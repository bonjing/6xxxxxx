Fuck Nintendo for making it so hard to share Miis outside of the console, and for their assault on Mii editors. Fuck them for their idiotic edit restrictions. Fuck the for setting an idiotic limit of 100 Miis in the Plaza. Fuck them for erasing data when sending Miis to the lame Mii parade. You had a good idea guys. Yes the Miis are limited, but the variety and what you can do isn't bad for 74 bytes of data. Like all controling DRM crazy rabbid gaming companies you lost site of the fact that you are in the entertainment business. It is not fucking entertaining to transfer 10 Mii at a time via a fucking remote. It is not entertaining to sit at a PC or Wii console for 5 minutes per goddamn character to type it in manually. Get a fucking clue you twits.
