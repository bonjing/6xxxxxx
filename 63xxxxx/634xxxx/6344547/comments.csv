,hewne,2011-04-28T02:38Z,"@eztv: Thank you very kindly eztv for sharing your uploads, i appreciate it very much! Not everyone has high or mid income job to afford buying shows like this when they come out, this makes it easier to see if a show is worth buying/watching! 

I really wish the networks would let you pay a monthly fee to download and watch movies as opposed to buying the dvd/blue discs every time a season comes out.

@Ultramega9: Please don't feed the trolls

also @capnjazz: if you aren't a troll and just have a lot of time on your hands, perhaps you should utilize your critique skills @ http://www.rottentomatoes.com/ as most of the people who come here WANT to download the episode... just a thought... "
