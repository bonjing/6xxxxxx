,_Ghost_,2011-04-26T05:55Z,"No, it's not cracked. 
Dude it's 7 bucks, don't be a bum and just buy it."

Please explain - and yes, I am a bum otherwise why would I be here?

Accepted, I don't have access to anything or could contribute anything other than what the fine bod's take and make their time and effort to provide us mortals with. "
,senseinai,2011-04-27T05:04Z,"I didn't know it cost so little ... but if you expect people to buy it instead of pirating it, why would you put it on the pirate bay?
Ghost, your brain may be an illusion ;-)"
,_Ghost_,2011-04-27T17:44Z,"@senseinai : 

Hehe :-D 
There is no illusion there! I just don't think TPB is all about cracking and ruining a developer's business. After all, why not share apps that you think are nice to try without a crack? "

,_Ghost_,2011-04-29T16:25Z,espirates: you're the rat's ass here. that's the dumbest comment i've seen in a long long time.

Fair enough. Thanks for posting it ... I bought it."
