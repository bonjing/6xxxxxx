,roccis,2011-05-08T07:33Z,freeworkman3: where can i find a torrent of that 11gb Tron 3d that you talk about?
,Ballwinkle,2011-05-10T18:23Z,"This is 44gb because it is a straight rip from a bluray. Dual Layer blu rays can hold 50gb of data, which 3d films take up. Most other 3d films you download will be smaller. Why? becuase they are compressed, and often SBS rips are 1920*1080 instead of 3840*1080 which 3d films are (because they have one image for each eye)"
,Todde@Swe,2011-05-10T20:03Z,I can't see the 3D effect in this one. How come? And YES i do own a 3D TV :)
,roccis,2011-05-13T19:23Z,Anybody who can give me a link to the 11Gb Tron 3d torrent?
,Buster_NL,2011-05-21T12:10Z,"I've been downloading for 12 days now (65%), I give up! Not even sure it works in 3D!"
,ilang16,2011-05-24T01:08Z,"Can someone please tell me what im doing wrong, i mounted the iso and PowerDVD is telling me there is an unsupported format in my drive.  What is everyone else doing to view the file?"
,ilang16,2011-05-24T03:09Z,"nevermind, reinstalled Daemon..."
,ilang16,2011-05-24T03:50Z,this is not SBS :-(
,rom86,2011-05-30T01:13Z,"Works great.
Stupids like freeworkman3 should be put in prison"
,rinildoq,2011-06-12T07:35Z,"Size is big cos its in DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1! Lossless format. Anyway, tks for the upload :)"
,nishanta_07,2011-06-14T09:13Z,"how come this movie is too big, the tron 3d i saw was only 11.27gb!!!"
,HJ-Gamer,2011-07-08T18:15Z,OMFG is this the iso?!
,GearCloud,2011-09-24T08:54Z,you rock man thx for it
,viper42953,2011-10-25T13:25Z,"If your blurray player has an USB input you need to plug it in and play thru the player, not computer..."
,wildrohan,2011-12-23T07:11Z,fuck u r own asshole and download this is a fucking no quality u fucker ass hole on a dumb bitch
,marquo,2012-01-29T16:51Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6846384/TRON_LEGACY_3D.mkv i believe that is what he was talking about. 13 GB, 3D SBS version."
,MajiNPic1,2012-03-17T04:24Z,Thank you. It's working great. The quality is far superior than those 13GB 3D Half-SBS rips.
