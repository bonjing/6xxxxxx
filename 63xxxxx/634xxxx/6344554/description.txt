"Strain"

The White House is rocked by the sudden 
illness of one of their own, leaving 
Chief of Staff Peel (guest star Roger 
Bart, "Desperate Housewives") and 
Sterling (Zeljko Ivanek) to investigate 
possible conspirators. Michael Buchanan 
(Scott Patterson) comes to the aid of 
Leila (Sarah Roemer), but it leaves them 
both at risk of Sophia's wrath. Across 
the globe in Russia, Sean (Jason Ritter) 
and Vicky (Taylor Cole) race to stop 
Sophia's weapon from being loaded onto a 
plane heading to the United States.

Enjoy :)
