,2362,2011-04-27T22:18Z,"100% Real  

A6.5 and V 8 other then the fact part of the right screen has been cut off not bad though, to not even be in theaters in USA yet.

I gave the video an 8 because of the quality it is fairly goor quality, Would have probably gave it a 9.5 if it was missing a couple inches of screen.

WATCHABLE

I AM SEEDING AS WELL"
,streeter93,2011-04-27T22:52Z,cmon bro ill seed for a week 2mbs wen i get it ...the sooner sum1 seeds it the sooner every1 gets a good dwnload speed
,iceman19781978,2011-04-28T01:56Z,"ok i had to create an account just to make this post, i can't believe some idiot would give this crap an 8 for video. This is not even an R5 that would get an 8 but a crappy TS that anyone who is not blind can see is very blury and dark.

It doesnt make any difference when it is being released in the Us or Canada, the fact is that it is crappy quality and better to see it in the cinema or wait for a real R5 that merits an 8 for video quality.

Stop posting shitty reviews on quality and making people use up their bandwight for shit like this.

Have you seen an R5 before it looks a whole lot better than this and R5's are only 8 for quality and Dvdrips get a 10.

This should really be 4v and 4a

,btd246279,2011-04-28T13:57Z,"audio is decent.  Video quality is decent, but the right third of the screen is missing for the entire movie, and halfway through, the camera zooms in making the movie unwatchable.  while this upload was at least a decent attempt, it is a better idea to wait for either a better one or see it in theatre.

If you see only 2/3 of the movie, use VLC player, and turn ON ROTATION. You will see FULL image, as the movie is actually NORMAL width."
,iceman19781978,2011-04-28T15:49Z,"dayglo666 you obviously no shit about movies, i am the movie guy, read what the other real users are saying, this copy sucks like shit, TS are always crap and never merit the rating of an 8 for video in any case what so ever, how can this even be considered watchable when the right side is screwed up and not viewable properly.

To anyone who is a movie lover like i am here is the real facts.... don't waste your time downlaoding this is if you really wanna see it. your gona ruin it for yourself. I use direct downlaod sites and these torrent sites always get the movie a few days later from those main sites. A screener copy or and R5 copy is soon coming which will be close to a dvdrip.

this crappy copy gets 4V 4A

,Frostybro,2011-04-30T17:00Z,"Shit quality. 100% Unwatchable. Just so you get an idea of how much of the screen you're actually watching:

And halfways in the movie, the camera-retard zooms in, making it even more unwatchable.

And no, he didn't film after the credits."
,syrus1987,2011-04-30T20:48Z,omg i want to slap the guy that is telling everyone what happened in the movie.

,AlvinT,2011-05-01T23:30Z,"Right side is missing 1/3 of the screen (and other people who have said that playing it in VLC with rotation will fix it are wrong, it doesn't help)."
,jrosales559,2011-05-02T05:06Z,"When using VLC player and clicking Rotation, I was unable to see the full screen of the movie"
,zechariah666,2011-05-02T06:54Z,"Even though you only get to see two thirds of the screen you can still see most of what is going on. The audio was good and most of the movie was good until someone happend to hit the zoom in after already not being able to see the entire film as I did in the theater. Also, I was very disappointed that they did not get the surprise ending that was totally unexpected and a very important piece of the movie. 
Come on, anyone who has seen any of these movies knows not to leave until the credits have completely stopped at least one or two of the characters from one of the past films shows up with something out of the ordinary. I give an A9 and V3."
