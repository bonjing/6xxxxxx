When her five grown-up children fail to answer her call for a family 
gathering, exacerbated mother Shirley calls on outspoken force of 
nature Madea to see that everyone comes together to discuss some 
rather important issues in this filmed stage play written and directed 
by Tyler Perry. With everyone finally assembled thanks to Madea\'s tenacity, 
Shirley addresses some important family secrets, reveals that she\'s in the

importance of faith in helping her family weather the rough waters ahead, 
and stay true to their values.
