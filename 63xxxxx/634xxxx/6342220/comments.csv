,fayimora,2011-05-02T06:57Z,PLease can i use them on a mac???? also how do i install them?
,caaachme,2011-05-03T10:39Z,"i am not sure if they are interchacgeable.  The exchange does not seperate the two so i would think they would, but i don't know. Guess it depends on if the Adobe suites are interchangeable between mac and windows,because they sure dont care what version windows is running.

you install them with the extension manager. should be able to just double click and it will open the extension manager and install itself.  In win 7 open the manager as administrator first then install from it, will save you a bunch of aggravation."

But I would have atleast sorted the extensions a bit :-) - now I just need to install them and see for whch app it is - shame - but still good upload"
