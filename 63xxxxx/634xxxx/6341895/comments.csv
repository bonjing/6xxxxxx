,jhagg,2011-04-25T07:55Z,Does your previous CS5 upload update to his version or should we be using this one instead?  What is the difference?
,rupankur,2011-04-25T08:32Z,"CS5.1 EXTENDED 1,19Gb for x86 other 1.48 Gb for x64 version isnt it ?"
,TonyParsons,2011-04-25T09:19Z,Read the descriptions you two - it's apparent to a blindman
,rupankur,2011-04-25T10:15Z,"mine is wrong to x86 or x64 version
1.19 Gb is english version
1.48 Gb is other language "
,rcnsit,2011-04-25T15:30Z,"Hey,isin't there a CS5.5 version released yet ?I read that it had been leaked ...."
[V],thethingy,2011-04-25T15:43Z,"jhagg, It doesn't yet but it might, haven't noticed anything different in this build yet.

chess000master, you need to stop spamming on others torrents, it's rude & you have been reported several times now.

rupankur, both are 32/64 it's just the languages that are different. "

,jhagg,2011-04-25T19:40Z,"Hi thethingy, thanks as always for a great release.  Just to update your old version does not update to this, so I went ahead and downloaded this torrent and installed.  This update works perfectly as always, everyone remember to uninstall prior version first as per his instructions.  

Looks like any difference is related to mobile products as far as I can tell, much more robust interface for device central, etc."
[V],thethingy,2011-04-25T20:51Z,"chess000master, listen kid, grow up, dont post on my torrents anymore and stop acting like a child who thinks his toy is the best one. People know my stuff is legit so I dont need some crazed obsessed fool helping. "

First of all, thanks a lot for all these uploads! You've really done us a solid and we appreciate all your efforts!

I hope you can help me with an issue that I have been having. I am writing to you about a problem that I am having with the serial numbers.

I first installed Adobe Illustrator and it was working perfectly fine on the first initial. I then installed Adobe Phtoshop and it worked perfectly fine on the first initial uses. Then, both applications said that the serial code (which it had formerly accepted) was invalid. So I input the codes again... It worked for some instances, and then it asked for a valid serial code.

Im not sure what is wrong. I did the HOST blocking as outlined.... My question is
1. Should I delete and reiinstall the software?
2. Is anyone else having this problem?
3. How can I successfully tackle this?"
,Saurov,2011-05-09T22:15Z,"Works great if the instructions are followed.I installed it on my laptop and it was activated normally.Then  installed updates as well and there was no trouble with that either.

Steps I followed:

1. Checked my default hosts file.There was no extra information so figured it can be directly replaced with the hosts file in the torrent.

2.Took ownership of the default hosts file (just in case it doesn't  let me rename it) and then changed the name to 'hostsbackup' (without quotations of course)

3.Pasted the hosts file from the torrent in its place.Then followed the instructions about the cmd input.

4.Restarted the system and opened the hosts file (where I  had pasted it) using NotePad.It was unaltered so guess my AntiVirus didn't interfere with it.

5.Installed Photoshop CS5 using the setup and used the third serial provided in the instructions.Don't select the ""Install as a trial"" (One would need to be a major retard to go through the trouble of downloading 1.2 GB of files and then selecting trial)

6.Started the software and it appeared fully activated.Checked for updates and they installed fine.

So basically it's easy-as-hell.

I installed photoshop cs5.1 extended edition with your instructions. Now I can't acces the pirate bay at home anymore.

,Rush1,2011-06-04T20:22Z,"Hi to all,
I dled CS5 from ""thingy"" and followed the instructions accurately during installation........
it installed perfectly but as soon as i'd open a file the prog would crash.....i tried 
copying the dll files to the prog folder and even uninstalled and re-installed CS5.....still the same
problem......fed up, i uninstalld it, then dled another torrent from ""AngRdz"" and tried it......still the
same f***ng issue of crashing........i was going nuts trying to figure out a solution......then i remembered 
that a few months ago i had the same problem with another software, and a friend had asked me to try
running the app in ""compatibility mode""........so i tried that with CS5 and  BINGO !!!.....no more crashes....
works just perfect........(i've got Windows7 and now running CS5 in Windows XP-SP2)

if you have Win7 and facing similar problems dont curse the uploader.......these guys are doing a fantastic 
job getting these softwares for you practically free!!!......what you should do is>>
>> right-click on the program launch exe 
>>from the options select ""Run in Compatibility Mode""  or ""Troubleshoot Compatibility"" 
>> in the window that pops up click ""Try Recommended Settings"" 
>> in the next window click ""Start the Program""
>> program will start 
>>go back to the Program Compatibility window and click ""Next""
>> in the next window click ""Yes, save these settings for this program""
>> you're done........hereafter you just have to click on the program icon and it will run with the saved settings.

THANXX    TO  'the thingy""   and   ""AngRdz""  for  GREAT UPLOADS !!!! ........Keep up the Good Work !!"

,KLVTZ,2011-06-16T22:20Z,"@thethingy and @Everyone I wanted to inform you, for your future benefit, and for everyone else to know, that when you copy over the new .dll files onto Photoshop CS5.1 extended edition, it reverts the program back to a Standard edition. In other words, what i mean is, it seems the original .dll files keep the program extended. However, upon copying over the .dll file onto the 64 bit directory it changes Photoshop back to its standard version. Therefore, i am posting this just to give everyone a heads-up. I understand copying over the .dll files is optional and for me it was not needed (i never had to enter another code.) Thus, to everyone who may have had the problem of installing Photoshop Extended CS5.1 from either this source or any suite,  and it reverts back to a standard version, it may be because you copied over .dll file that reverts the software back to its standard version -instead of extended. In order to fix this problem, thethingy was kind enough to provide the original .dll files -just in case anything may happen. Just copy over the original and be sure to block adobe in the hosts files and it should work fine. Moreover, i understand there are other master collection suits out there that ask to replace the majority of the softwareâ€™s .dll files. It was Photoshop that i encountered this problem (not the others). Lastly, be sure to run the installer as Admin. It seems if you don't, for some reason it doesn't recognize your graphics card (well at least this was my case). Hope this helps everyone and please keep in mind this worked for me and may or may not work for you. Cheers to everyone! And happy Photo shopping! "

,lilcumarsupiu,2011-07-03T16:52Z,"Hello thething and thank you for this torrent. I read almost all comments and it seems that in general people don't have problems in using it. It means it is me that don't understand the easy things. Sorry, but I need some help.

on my PC i have Windows 7. I first changed the host file, by replacing mine with this:

Is the correct one? Because afterwards I followed all the steps, the apps was installed with no problem, but when I want to use it the following error appears:

Replacing the dll files didn't help :("

thanks for your safe and good stuff.
I'm installing it and have little questions.
You say that we must restart the PC after the hosts file replacement, do we have to cut again the internet connexion after that like we did before replacing the hosts file ?

I'm in step 2, entered the serial and have the green ""ok"" check next to the number, I have clicked ""next"" 10 mn ago and I'm stuck at this step...
How long did you wait to go to next step ? 

Hope you understand me, I'm french..."

,mags-O,2011-08-01T01:12Z,"[quote]Works great if the instructions are followed.I installed it on my laptop and it was activated normally.Then installed updates as well and there was no trouble with that either.

Steps I followed:

1. Checked my default hosts file.There was no extra information so figured it can be directly replaced with the hosts file in the torrent.

2.Took ownership of the default hosts file (just in case it doesn't let me rename it) and then changed the name to 'hostsbackup' (without quotations of course)

3.Pasted the hosts file from the torrent in its place.Then followed the instructions about the cmd input.

4.Restarted the system and opened the hosts file (where I had pasted it) using NotePad.It was unaltered so guess my AntiVirus didn't interfere with it.

5.Installed Photoshop CS5 using the setup and used the third serial provided in the instructions.Don't select the ""Install as a trial"" (One would need to be a major retard to go through the trouble of downloading 1.2 GB of files and then selecting trial)

6.Started the software and it appeared fully activated.Checked for updates and they installed fine.

So basically it's easy-as-hell.[/quote]"

To those having problems, perform a clean uninstall by using the torrent link provided somewhere here or use a software like Revounistaller.

I'm definitely excited to try out CS5.1 Extended, but having a little problem with the hosts setup. My original hosts file in the ETC folder looks a bit different from the example you provided:

## Copyright (c) 1993-2001 Microsoft Corp.
#
# This file has been automatically generated for use by Microsoft Internet
# Connection Sharing. It contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names
# for the home network. Please do not make changes to the HOSTS.ICS file.

# local network.

[and right here is the only IP-to-hostname mapping listed]

How exactly should I proceed?
A little help from anyone would be really appreciated. Thanks :]"

Followed all instructions, and Photoshop seems to be working fine. But Illustrator and InDesign aren't working, and they are what I really need.

InDesign will load and open, and then an error message comes up that says ""Adobe InDesign is not properly licenced and will now quit"". I've also tried ""run as administrator"" and ""troubleshoot compatibility"".

Exit Code 6 and Exit Code 7 are installation errors. Read the error details, I had a Code 7 which said missing files, I extracted the *part 2* rar and it worked for me. 

Yours looks like you need to run the setup as Administrator since it looks like you do not have the sufficient rights. Try that method and see if that works."

OK, so I downloaded Photoshop CS5 Extended and had a wonderful time with it, but over the course of the semester I sometimes forgot to turn off my wifi adapter so Adobe would then quietly in the background update whichever registries it mysteriously does to deactivate my particular version. This was just fine until I ran out of keys, then after an exhaustive search through the mighty google I came upon a constant request for an internet connection and an adobe id. Now first I updated the dll, did a power cycle and the application stopped working altogether. Then I restored the original dll files and double checked the host files, now photoshop works but currently it says im in trial mode. I thought I had not only sorted out the host file, key, and additionally had my anti-virus block all traffic that I could find that would connect to photoshop, but still it is still communicating with adobe... so please help. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, and power cycled until I'm blue in the face. I really need this software for school and I cant even afford to pay for the student edition of $499 so please help, please...."

,peach12,2011-10-24T11:49Z,"hey, can someone please help me?

I've downloaded this and everything works fine but only recently realised that it doesn't save my work.
This is a massive problem for my college work and have tried everything to change it.

Basically, when i go to file and click save or save as, the file menu goes as if it has registered it and yet nothing comes up. It doesn't show the save options box or even try to load.

I have been able to save some work when i click close and it asks 'do you want to save your work before exiting' but it seems to depend on how much work i have done whether it even comes up (too much of a risk doing this all the time) or it depends on the resolution/size whether there is an option to save it as JPEG or not.

Just started my first assignment at college and would really appreciate any help, thanks xx"

But why no .dll for extended? They say .dll only for normal photoshop.

Oh well wiggers, just make msure your host files are properly  set and your fake cereal should be ok."
,unovas,2011-10-29T15:51Z,I have downloaded this and have it working but... I must be doing something wrong as it just standard CS5.1 and not extended as there is no 3D or (one to one) can some link me to the version that has 3D plz.

,KnuxTheFox,2011-11-01T18:40Z,"Thank you, thethingy.  This is one situation where I'd say the company is alienating their userbase.  $700 for this program and $200 just to upgrade from CS4, it seems like they only people they want to buy their software are businesses and professionals who can spare the money.  I'm just a person working for minimum wage.  A full 2-week paycheck could not buy their product.  This isn't an operating system (which I could build an awesome computer from scratch with what they want, but it's still just $100 less than Windows 7 Ultimate), it's a photo editor!"
,KnuxTheFox,2011-11-01T18:46Z,"I'm sorry...  I guess the price of Windows 7 Ultimate has dropped drastically since launch, it's now $219.99, nearly $400 less than Adobe wants for this program."

I had to reinstall my OS so i lost that installation and the serial in the instruction doesn't work. I remember the serials in the comments of that torrent worked though.
But now the torrent is gone.
I don't wna download this. With my connection, it'd take too long, so...

ANYONE HAS THOSE SERIALS THAT WAS POSTED ON THE COMMENTS FOR THE NOW DELETED PHOTOSHOP CS5 THE THINGY TORRENT?

No.  The altered host file prevents photoshop from updating, and prevents adobe from pushing an updated serial blacklist to your machine.  

The altered host file only affects incoming and outgoing connections to adobe servers.  There's no reason to worry about it.  It simply takes adobe IP addresses and domain names, and points them back to your computer, there by making adobe software assume it can't connect. "

I downloaded it a few months ago, and actually followed the instructions very carefully.  If you do this, it should not be a problem.

It works perfectly on Win 7 Pro 32 bit, but I never updated the software.  

Please support the software.  I finally was able to buy a legal copy yesterday and got all the updates.  Adobe products are kick ass and should be supported if you can afford it.

@thethingy- Thank You so much for this torrent, but I have a few questions that I hope someone could answer for me.

I am downloading this torrent for the second time because I wanted to retry doing this. I watched your video to change the hosts file, but when I am unsure of how to save it once i have changed/added the new stuff to be able to run this properly. For every time I saved the hosts file copy using either notepad or wordpad it would save as a txt file and not the file that is needed.

If someone could please tell me how to save the hosts file properly I would greatly appreciate any and all help that could be given.

Thank you all,

Finally i flushed the dns and installed photoshop CS5 extended (this torrent) and entered the serial key and it was green so i went ahead and installed. Then when I try to start the program up it prompts me to stay in trial or go buy it because my serial was wrong. What have I been doing wrong? Was I supposed to add that host file to something rather than flat out replace? I installed Light room and elements and both work fine. If you can give me any help i would appreciate it, i m sure the torrent is great I can see from the other ones, I just think I'm a bit lost on beating Adobe's protection. Cheers!"

First off big thanks TheThingy it seems to be running smootly again after some repairs with the toolkit. However I've stumbled upon a ''minor'' thing with using kuler in both apps. When I'm using the given .dll files I can't access kuler it gives me ''no connection to the internet''-errors. When replacing it with the original .dll it does work within both apps but giving me the SN error in return. Is there a way to fix it or anyone experienced this as well?

Instructions:
â€¢ Go to ""C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc""
---- In this folder you will find your hosts file. That's the file that you need to replace.
â€¢ Now go back to the torrent folder: ""Adobe Photoshop CS5.1 Extended Edition\HOSTS SET-UP""
â€¢ Copy the hosts file from the torrent folder.

Basically installed with errors due to me having uninstalled an earlier version.  used the Clean Install tools from the other torrent, still came up with errors.  That being said, it is functioning 100% on Win 7 x64.  The error had to do with some PDF setting garbage.  nothing important.  Thanx for the torrent.

must be an adobe script thing, for example if installing from media (any type of media), then name of media must be.... otherwise error, if installing from local directory, then just find installer files.... this is an issue with Adobe scripting, and has nothing todo with TheThingy, but still be nice if in the future TheThingy could find a way around this issue, as i usually mount the ISO (ISZ actually) as i don't like having installer files loose (if in a Image file, then all files are protected from threats)

that's my guess, but quite annoying though....

I found out its because I have a netbook and some features are not compatible with netbooks, such as saving.

To get around it I have to change my screen orientaion from landscape to portrait. Its under Start-> control panel->Appearance and Personalization->Display->Adjust screen resolution->Select Orientation Portrait

Now its a little difficult to manuver the mouse cause the screen is sideways but I had it down after a little while. Now with the screen in portrait mode save your file and then you can change your screen back.
