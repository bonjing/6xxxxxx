Release Title: The Insider 1999 720p HDTVRip H264 AAC-GreatMagician (Kingdom-Release)
Directed By: Michael Mann
Tagline: Balls-out "60 Minutes" producer Lowell Bergman sniffs a story when a former
research biologist for Brown & Williamson, Jeff Wigand, won't talk to him.
When the company leans hard on Wigand to honor a confidentiality agreement,
he gets his back up. Trusting Bergman and despite a crumbling marriage, he
goes on camera for a Mike Wallace interview and risks arrest for contempt of
court. Westinghouse is negotiating to buy CBS, so CBS attorneys advise CBS
News to shelve the interview and avoid a lawsuit. "60 Minutes" and CBS News
bosses cave, Wigand's hung out to dry, Bergman is compromised, and the CEOs
of Big Tobacco may get away with perjury. Can the truth will out?
