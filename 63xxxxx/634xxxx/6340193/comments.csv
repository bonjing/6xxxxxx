,IA310,2011-11-21T02:27Z,"FIX FOR SN ISSUE...
    Once you initially put in the SN and you have closed out PS once. When you attempt to open Portraiture for the second time, you will see the menu prompt for license etc. Click on preferences, then close that menu by hitting the red x. Done."
,IA310,2011-12-03T01:02Z,"Alright the above is retarded. Follow these instructions and it will work like a charm.
