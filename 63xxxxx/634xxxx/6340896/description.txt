We are all faced with decisions that we never anticipated having to make. And, we usually have to make them quickly. In this four session video group study, author and pastor Andy Stanley discusses four questions that will help participants make sound decisions with God's help.

Really? - Why do I REALLY want to choose this option?

The Story of your life - What would you like your story about this decision to be?

Pay Attention to the Tension - Which option has a moral / legal tension to it?

Passin' it on - Which option would be in line with God's wishes?

Has Group Curriculums you can work through in a cell group.
