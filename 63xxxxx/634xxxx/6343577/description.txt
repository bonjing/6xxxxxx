Release Title Rabbit Hole 2010 720p BRRip H264 AAC-GreatMagician (Kingdom-Release)
Directed By: John Cameron Mitchell
Tagline Becca and Howie Corbett are a happily married couple whose perfect world is forever
changed when their young son, Danny, is killed by a car. Becca, an executive-turned-
stay-at-home mother, tries to redefine her existence in a surreal landscape of well-meaning
family and friends. Painful, poignant, and often funny, Becca's experiences lead her to find
solace in a mysterious relationship with a troubled young comic-book artist, Jason - the
teenage driver of the car that killed Danny. Becca's fixation with Jason pulls her away from
memories of Danny, while Howie immerses himself in the past, seeking refuge in outsiders
who offer him something Becca is unable to give. The Corbetts, both adrift, make surprising
and dangerous choices as they choose a path that will determine their fate.
