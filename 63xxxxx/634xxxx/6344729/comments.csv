and ask yourself why are they here if I upload viruses. "

,yehky,2011-05-08T08:07Z,"The loading screen and the ""About Illustrator"" in the program states that the program's still a tryout version. Is this normal, if I used the second way to install?"
,disc0nnect3d,2011-05-10T18:29Z,"THANKS THETHINGY!!WORKS FINE!!!!. my only suggestion is when you startUp the .exe and creator the external folder whit the container. some error its show. something like ( some files can be extracted ) but you put ""skip"" or ignore. but WORKING FINE ..

,mkaaaay,2011-05-18T12:21Z,"I followed your instructions step by step, just as you said to, and when it came time to put the serial in, it told me both didn't work. It says in your instructions that there's a bug that makes it not accept the serial the first time, to start it up and enter the serial on the first run. I tried that and neither serial worked. Any help? Are there other serials that work? "
,mkaaaay,2011-05-18T12:55Z,Sorry to bother again. I am thinking I must have done something wrong because I just tried doing the same thing with your torrent of Photoshop CS5 and that serial didn't work either. I seriously thought I did everything right! I apologise if I seem annoying. Any advice? I seriously thought I did your instructions to the letter! None of the serials for this or photoshop are working. Any help?
,mkaaaay,2011-05-19T09:14Z,Yes...it's me again. I figured out my issue. Also your version of Photoshop CS5.1 Extended worked with this serial 1330-1034-6108-6307-6472-1237. The first serial listed in the instructions for this worked!

,MohToast,2011-09-04T08:00Z,"@roseglass


Illustrator wont do anything outside of a built object. So if you just want a gradient you have to build a box first. i am pretty sure at least its been a couple months since i have used it. But just go to

,KM49,2012-03-17T02:16Z,"INSTALLING INSTRUCTIONS & SERIALS:
1) Open the program file (What you downloaded)
2) Open ""Adobe Illustrator CS5.1"" Folder (The folder that you extracted in step 1)
3) Go to ""SOFTWARE""
4) Click ""Set-up""
5) Follow instructions to install
6) During Step 5 you will come across a screen that asks for the serials. Keep this window open. Go to the ""INSTALLING INSTRUCTIONS.txt"" file. There you will find the Serials for step 5.
That's it! Your done. Now open and enjoy.

Thanks a lot 'thethingy'"
