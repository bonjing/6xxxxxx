,master_b415,2012-03-16T07:17Z,"just saying...4 me the viewing was a colored or colorized version of events was needed to draw in viewers in the original production of this documentary set. The quality is poor because the black & white film was crudely coloured. So the film is viewed with shadings of red, green and greys. Not to mention poor B/W archived footage. 

No ones fault I dare say, albeit I've not bought or viewed the Retail (untouched) version. And given the 70 years that has transgressed in time of any vaulted or archived original footages. But defo very viewable."
