Well, itâ€™s been a while coming, but Iâ€™m pleased to let yâ€™all know that the third and final episode of \"Bad Universe\" will air on The Discovery Channel tomorrow, April 19, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern (US) time â€” but of course, check your local listings.
The episode is entitled \"Death Stars\", and is about the effects of solar flares and nearby supernovae. Like the other two, this was a lot of fun to put together, though the trip to Sandia Lab still haunts me a bitâ€¦ but I wonâ€™t give that away. Youâ€™ll just have to see. I actually havenâ€™t seen the final cut since we put it together late last year, so to be honest when I watch it tomorrow itâ€™ll be a bit like seeing it again for the first time.
Speaking of which, my daughter will be in school when it airs, so I wonâ€™t watch it until we can see it as a family. That means I wonâ€™t be live-tweeting or anything like that.
And to answer the inevitable question: I donâ€™t know if the network is picking it up as a series or not. I expect the ratings of the airing tomorrow may play into that, so tell a friend! Or tell a few dozen.
I hope you like it, and have at least as much fun watching it as I did making it.
