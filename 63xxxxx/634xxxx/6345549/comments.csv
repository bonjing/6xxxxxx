,xdivedownx,2011-06-12T07:36Z,"Is the game in English? It taking a long time due to lack of seeders, so want to make sure first. 

Also, there is another torrent floating around that includes an update. Does this one have an update as well? If so, which one. Here's the list - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_system_software 

Just don't want to update past the ability to play certain games due to anti-piracy updates. "
