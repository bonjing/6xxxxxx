Release Description
---------------------

Blood Brothers Pt.4

Part four introduces us to Loki's biological mother, which felt a bit unexplored but the interest of the episode is whether or not Thor will meet his end by way of 
execution. Once again Hela makes an appearance; and the scene is amazing in both animation and dialogue. The episode overall is, once again, a fantastic piece of
storytelling with amazing artwork, but the ending was weak. Mostly it's because I felt for Loki as a character and he seemed cheated in the end, but it also could 
have been due to the whole anticlimactic way it was approached; they built up the episode only to have it just end so suddenly.
The series is phenomenal, period. From start to finish the series delivers beautiful artwork -- that blends elements of a motion comic with CG animation, great 
character development of Loki, and an awesome voice cast. This has become a definite new favorite of mine, and not only has this series brought me tremendous 
anticipation for future projects by Marvel Knights but also has given me a new love for the Thor villain and piqued enough fascination for me to begin indulging in 
the Thor comic series.
