    have been writing music and lyrics (feebly) for over 25 years. Flothology has tracks spanning from my teenage years (\\\"I 

live in Hell\\\" - 1986) until today.

    Many of these recordings are live from my analog Sony TCM-359V cassette recorder which is unbelievably still in use 

today. Others are from multi-tracking the vocals and instruments off of my old Fostec 4-track cassette recorder (R.I.P.). 

Still others are from the inspiring change over to digital recordings (Audacity) in the mid 90s as well as with with several 

professional and D.I.Y. studios throughout the years.

    I have had the pleasure of working with some incredibly talented musicians, producers and engineers over the years with 

these songs and I will duly note their contributions.

    NOTE: I am very new to this web site (BandCamp.com) and am not sure how many tracks that they will allow per record. 

Believe me, I will try to get as many as I can on this one and not charge you a thing for them because music, to me, isn\\\'t 

about revenue/sales, its about having a good time.

    I hope that you enjoy.

    If you do...please let me know, OK?

    Respectfully to all,

    Thomas William
