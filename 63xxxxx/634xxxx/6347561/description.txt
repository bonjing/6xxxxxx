SUMMARY:
From a world called â€œLife Coreâ€, which exists parallel to the normal human world, females known as â€œJuuden-chanâ€ are patrolling the human world in search for individuals who feel depressed and unlucky. Their job is to charge these people up with the help of electricity in order to improve their mental states. Whilst normally unseen by human eyes, one of these Juuden-chan, Plug Cryostat, accidentally meets a young man who is able to see her, because she was targeting his sister. This series revolves around the various antics between the main characters and the quest for this Juuden-chan to improve herself.
