Dude do you have skype?

It's your old SWAT4 MGeneral from KoG clan.

Add me on skype, muris.jusic.

And I have pes11 and need urgent help. It's playing it own games, I'm pissed :)"
,Trollaaja,2011-04-29T12:09Z,"yoo this works great, rly big thanks!

Only two questions: Do i have to do something about the other rar files wich includes setup.D01 files?

Other thing, after installing the patch i can barely hear othen sounds at all (ball kick, player calls etc.)

Team chants works great though.

Afterall im very pleased for the patch and makes the game even better!"
,Trollaaja,2011-04-29T12:33Z,"I`ll be more specific, is it possible to turn the chants sounds quiter and the original sounds louder?"
,Dido_SMoKE,2011-04-29T19:56Z,"hey M :)
