     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      Sketch show set in a fictional Scottish location that's
      strangely familiar. In this episode, Burnistoun's crimefighting
      caped crusader Doberman Man attempts to track down his nemesis -
      the boy who teased him at school. Plus, the secret appeal of a
      visit to the boxing gym, paranoia reigns at both the pub and
      local pole dancing club, two friends who bump into each other
      after 15 years struggle to converse, an overpriced takeaway
      pizza leads to a breakdown, and martial arts superhero
      Bunnetcatcher steps in to save a group of schoolchildren being
      held hostage.
