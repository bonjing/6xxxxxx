,XoomFiles,2011-04-28T16:06Z,"First the DVDs were ripped to my hard drive using DVD Shrink.  Then they were converted to 720p mp4 files using Handbrake.

The point is the files were sourced from the DVD.  The files are 720p MP4 files."
,XoomFiles,2011-04-28T19:25Z,I should add that no compression was used when doing the original rip.  Hence no upscaling was necessary.
,kurik,2011-04-28T21:03Z,"If the source is dvd and the end result is 720p, then they have been upscaled."
,XoomFiles,2011-04-28T22:10Z,"I'm sure that you would know better than I.  I made these files for my own use and figured some other people might be interested in having them as well, so I uploaded this torrent.  I'm representing them as best as I understand.  

These have the largest file size of any of the Cowboy Bebop MP4s on here.  Make of that what you will."
,jessez,2011-07-24T23:32Z,i'm gona moke a release with english and just 480P upscale screws it up 
,SalivaArt,2011-11-17T08:09Z,this is no where close to 720p (i can see pixels and blurs from yr reincoding it from a 480i source( dvd)). fuck you for misleading people. this is ALSO stuck in crappy 4:3. so leaves big black bars on the sides of my tv.
,darxide23,2012-04-20T17:19Z,"The series hasn't been released on BluRay so a true 720p version does NOT exist yet. Upscaled 480p is still 480p.

These files are just unnecessarily large. Any of the other torrents will work just fine and they're smaller files."
