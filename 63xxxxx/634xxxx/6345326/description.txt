This is a Refill created using Propellerhead Reason 4.

The primary function intended was to have a copy of the Rhythm/Super Accompaniment tracks. And the Demo song.

The patch contains 100 Sound Banks; 19 Rhythm tracks; 13 Super Accompaniment tracks; and the Demo song.

Patch 66 could do with tweaking. Not sure how to use Reason to trigger 'off' notes.
