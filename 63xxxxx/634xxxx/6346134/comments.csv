,tim_dawg,2011-04-26T21:07Z,"Guys - a quick question - who is narrating this download? It's either David Attenborough (for the UK release) or Sigourney Weaver (for the US release). If anyone's downloaded this already, I'd appreciate it you could mention who the narrator is. Or YIFY - could you add it in?  By the way, your torrents are always spot on!  Cheers!"

,Tony-Pepperoni,2011-07-27T11:27Z,"Video 9, Sound 8.

What pissed me off was the fact episodes 2-7 have subs. For a start, why do 80% of the eps have subs?
I also don't understand why people who speak English as a first language would want to watch subs. This program is SPOKEN IS ENGLISH FFS.
It ruined my visual experience.
I'm downloading another torrent in hope of getting those 6 episodes without subs."

,Peperepepere,2011-08-23T02:54Z,Now this is truly nice to see. we have over 180 seeders but none are seeding. really nice of you. if you are not going to seed then at least remove the movie from your list..... it has been over 17 days now and still cannot get the movie....really nice of all of you.... sad state when this happens

,klearlycanadian,2011-11-18T11:07Z,"To alleviate all doubts out there.  I dont make a habit of commenting but I loved this download.  If you wanna watch this documentary there is no better version.  For 3.9 GB you can't beat the quality.  Five Star download!

,Cannon_Drive-by,2012-03-18T19:09Z,"Tony-Pepperoni mentioned English subs in episodes 2-7, and seemed to imply that they are hard-subbed. Can anyone confirm or refute this?"
,deman1084,2012-03-26T18:03Z,"Thanks a lot for this.
Pleasantly surprised by the quality considering its only 3.9GB & shows like this arent worth watching unless its good quality"
,PrideAndNoPrejudice,2012-04-29T23:57Z,"A response to those asking about subtitles.  Of the later episodes I've checked so far, yes, they have subtitles, but they are soft-coded, not hard-coded.  In other words, you can switch them off in your media player, or you can resave the file with MKVMerge if you want to remove them completely.

Either way, don't be put off - these are typically good rips from YIFY.  If you know his stuff, you'll know the score.  Good quality as always."

,shadowkillaa,2012-05-14T12:54Z,"I specifically downloaded a larger torrent so I could get great quality footage. I am disappointed.

V = 6.5
A = 9

If you guys want something which will look beautiful on a larger display, I suggest downloaded another torrent.

Thanks anyway uploader "
,rafiki_101,2012-05-30T22:51Z,"shadowkillaa, you specially DL a larger torrent? These is one of the smallest for the whole season. Why don't you try the 24gb or more if you're not happy? "
