NOTES:
IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Hop 2011

IMAGiNE doing it right first time with all the special filters that no one else uses or knows about,except 007....

No need for the rest ,when we're the best.....we turn line audio into cam with 12.1 surround sound.
Oh also tested and it works on my Dreamcast,amstrad 64 and my old record player....never worked in the tape deck though.

Ok guys this was given to us in 3 parts...part 1 and 3 were good...not much cropping,decent colours and brightness levels were good.

Now part 2...this is were the camera was knock and only got half the screen,this part lasted for 12mins.

What we done was filter all the videos the same ,changing the colour,brightness,contrast,sharpness etc....also had to rotate and use a perspective filter on all the parts.

Now for part two we had to make the res the same as part 1 and 3 so we could append all the files into one...so the AR is whacked on them 12mins.

Oh also missing 3mins 42 secs off the begining.....still starts whilst the credits are rolling but there's a little intro part thats not on it....could have took it off the other release,but man that flicker.

Once the video was all encode the audio we have needed to be resynced to this new video source......

AND YES IT IS FECKING LINE AUDIO!!!

But now doubt some dumbass will say its cam and wait for the a brrip ( well fuck right off ) On that note Enjot Folks
