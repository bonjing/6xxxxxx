Knocked Up (2007) 720p BrRip mkv - 600mb - YIFY 
[it's more than 2 hours.. so have to parden the size.. ]

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5959256/A_Walk_to_Remember_[2002]_720p_x264_[TYNYFYD]_
[hope that will work]

The Aviator (2004) 720p BrRip mkv - 650mb - YIFY 
[it's 3 hours long... got to be happy with 650mb @ 720p mate]

as far as i know... StyLishSaLH is more in to doing rips which are rare to be found in x264 or so -small sized rips...
and seems that list of waiting.. is quite long...

by the way... think you'll have a better chance of getting the rips done...
if u try the poll on facebook.


thnkz for the support.

@StyLishSaLH
thanks for showing us the devil :)"
,supcena,2011-04-24T15:55Z,"@banukaknight- yeah i do know how to use the search box :D.....i did find gunnersrocks and yifys torrents ........but the sizes of the torrents were over 600 mb....thats what prompted me to request the movies here,knowing the fact that StyLishSaLH is the only ripper on TPB who can rip movies to a size ranging from 300-400 mb with the best possible quality and thereby hoping to save some download time and memory on my hard disk .."
,supcena,2011-04-24T16:06Z,i'm not quite sure as to how the poll would work.....there are about 100 movies on the list ....i don't think anyone would go through the entire list of 100 and vote  .....people will only post their requests on most of the occasions and chuck out without bothering to look at other requests  ...lets be honest ..no one will have the patience to read the entire list ....unless and until it's a newly released flick (like say Sucker Punch) it wont be voted that often 
,banukaknight,2011-04-24T20:59Z,"have to admit that this poll thing isnt working very well at the moment.
everyones voting for sucker punch & im number 4 which havnt even been out on dvd yet.

idk.....
hard to think that even StyLishSaLH would be ""able"" to limit a 3hour long movie into.. 300mb mp4 file... (as you expect...)
i used the aviator torrent above myself.. with a 40kbps speed.
so think u should give it a try.
its u'r call."
,tropeus,2011-04-25T02:41Z,m8...No Strings Attached (2011) is available in blue ray version ..if u wish u can do it.......
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-04-25T03:03Z,I can reduce it 
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-04-25T04:36Z,"it's in the list bro tropeus :)
@knight
there is a rise in uploaders who do only small sized ones, it'll be good for people like Knight, who's having poor bandwidth. 
@supcena
thx for the suggestions bro, and for the movies. you came with the best always, like the clerks :)"
,irishboyblue,2011-04-25T10:25Z,just finished watching it bravo bravo 1

,Erich505,2011-05-10T23:30Z,"How do you get a BRrip squeezed into 416.79 Mib? I'm going to go ahead and DL this, everyone seems to like this dude's work, but I'm skeptical. "
,Erich505,2011-05-10T23:48Z,"StyLishSaLH, are you a bad ass? No really are you a bad ass? Don't even pull that modesty trip on me jewels, you're a bad ass. 416.79 Mib? i'm your biggest fan."
