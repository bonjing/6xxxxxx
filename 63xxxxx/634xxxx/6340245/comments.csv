,Cerebral222,2011-07-13T14:57Z,"Worked well, clean too."
,ememdroid,2011-07-18T17:45Z,"thanks :)
it worked for me.
I'm using Windows 7 Home Premium, 4GB RAM, DirectX 11, 2.8Ghz Processor, ......

Problem is, @ the second mission Sam Fisher can no longer runs. He just walks. I press shift and he'd still be walking after he jumps. Don't know what to do. 
Someone help. Thanks."
,ememdroid,2011-07-22T20:59Z,"Don't worry I figured it out. I'm using my mouse and I scrolled the middle mouse button down, that's the reason for the slow movement. Scrolling it up makes him run faster, while scrolling down makes him sneak up on people.

Great torrent man. You rock! 
Thanks. 
:XD"
