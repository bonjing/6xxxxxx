,skoms,2011-04-28T01:09Z,"So, what is this? You call the torrent ""street wars"", but your imdb link  says ""true justice"" and its a 13 episode tv-series.

This torrent is not a 13 episode tv-series.

So what the hell is street wars? I cant find any info on imdb that fit to this torrent..

Please explain yourself RajMahal..."
[V],RajMahal,2011-04-28T01:35Z,This is a 13 eposide series which couldn't make it to the tv so instead they released the first two episodes as a dvd and blu-ray in UK.And the series is called true justice and you are right but the dvd version of the first two episodes is called street wars :)
