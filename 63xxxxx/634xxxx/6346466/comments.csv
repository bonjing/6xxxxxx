Thanks by the way for the up ;-)"
,nox150690,2011-04-27T05:34Z,"Hey, glad your enjoying it :D It's just that I wiped my pc, and reinstalled XP, and found that the screens were reading the wrong information after about a minute. This should fix that plus any other issues. I will continue to look for any other bugs.

If anyone else if experiencing problems, please let me know and i will fix them. "
,martronn,2011-04-27T14:17Z,"Win7 64bit Fix:GO to the startmenu end seach for ""regedit"" change the value to new serial from readme file same serail you use in aircraft.cfg. In regedit.exe you go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\ copy and paste the serial then save it. that did the trick for me."

How exactly did you get it to work? I've tried everything how nox and you suggested. On nox install I would get the red lines and wrong altitude. I then installed this fix and now the screens go black again. I also tried pasting the auth code into the reg... any ideas?"
,arthomas,2011-06-03T21:01Z,I'm running windows7 64 bit
,nox150690,2011-06-25T12:08Z,"I can only suggest a complete reinstall of the PMDG planes, and removal of the REGEDIT keys. "
,BJ-Hawk,2011-06-28T15:01Z,"Thank you man, it works just perfect. But, looks like door animation dont work and wheels doesn turn. But still it's perfect :)"

,nox150690,2011-07-29T21:02Z,"Just install the http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6344991/PMDG_MD11_747-400_Combo_with_crack. first, ( following the provided instructions) and then copy the folder from this torrent into your fsx folder, and use the reg file to activate the crack. There is no module crack with this crack, only a reg crack."
,mdemons12,2011-08-05T15:36Z,Time to get the 737ngx.
,nox150690,2011-08-08T14:21Z,":d I am also trying my best to crack the 737ngx, but it will probably be a long time until we see a working, reliable crack. "
,av8er1555,2011-08-09T04:14Z,Dude I know what you mean... Ive been watching that torrent for 2 days hoping someone would have a breakthrough on cracking it. PMDG just cant make anything easy. Ive heard even people that buy it are having problems.
,aimad,2011-09-29T08:18Z,"hi there nox, i wanted to ask you how to install this crack. because im running your pmdg 744x since more than 2 months. the problem is only the knob of MCD, in which we select approach or flightplan screen. so i just want to know whether it will finish the problem or make more problems. like black screens. thankyou"
,trollhd,2012-05-01T11:38Z,"I've downloaded this crack fix, but now all screens are broken"
