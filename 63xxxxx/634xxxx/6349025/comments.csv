,N7_Steph,2011-05-18T00:24Z,The sound quality is shockingly bad. I am surprised no one has commented on this. I had my TV on maximum as well as laptop but it is very poor standard. Video quality is excellent though.

 The audio is a lot worse than I expected.. 

 Video looks near dvdrip but the audio sounds like it was recorded and played through a mobile phone, and not a very good one lol.

 Probably better off waiting for the DVD release, should be coming out this summer."
