What Are You Talking About? These Are Simple License Files That Can Be Used By Just Double-Clicking Them. 

Oh, And Whats The Guarantee That You Are Not A Spammer Who Wants To Scam people By Giving Fake Emails?"
[V],AmSterDoom,2011-04-25T11:52Z,"If you use license file, you dont require any sorts of activation code. Just double click license file and insert it.

,nilctg,2011-05-10T16:12Z,"Works fine with downloaded avast!(6.0.1091) from avast website. Thanks to AmSterDoom. 

There is one limitation though. Avast shows the subscription is valid till 16/2/2012!

Thanks anyway. Hope AmSterDoom will shade some light on subscription validity issue.    "

,orlankari19,2011-06-29T22:50Z,why does it keep telling me my subscription has expired?
,GigaBoii,2011-07-05T19:53Z,Working until year 2012. 8/13/2012 expiration. But still working! So its still legit. Like they said just download and install by double clicking!
,GigaBoii,2011-07-05T19:59Z,"This is getting activated under someone else's business account. So, this means that its above just ""pirating"" its now theft, and that can lead to a felony arrest for whom ever uses the file. 

Good thing Im on someone elses internet with a proxy IP, and a Spoofed mac address...
