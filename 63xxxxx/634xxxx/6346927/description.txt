On April 16, 2009 Dan Persons of mightymoviepodcast.com recalls that upon its release Liquid Sky "provoked heated arguments and, love it or hate, was required viewing for anyone who really cared about film.". Persons considers the film "one of the formative forces of indie film."

Carlos James Chamberlin wrote in March, 2004 at senseofcinema.com: "Itâ€™s about time people started rendering unto Liquid Sky. Its long lipstick trace is smudged through much of indie cinema."

Liquid Sky was produced and directed by Slava Tsukerman who, prior to making Liquid Sky, had a successful career as a documentary and TV film maker in the USSR and Israel. The screenplay was written by Tsukerman, his wife and ubiquitous co-producer Nina V. Kerova, and Anne Carlisle, who also enacted the film's two leading roles. The director of photography, Yuri Neyman, a Russian Ã©migrÃ©, was the DP and special effects expert. Anne Carlisle also wrote a novel based on the movie (same title, ISBN 0-385-23930-0) in 1987.

The music for the film was composed by Slava Tsukerman, Clive Smith and Brenda Hutchinson using the Fairlight CMI, the first digital sampler/synthesizer. Most of it was original, while some songs were interpretations of music by Carl Orff, Baroque composer Marin Marais, and others.
