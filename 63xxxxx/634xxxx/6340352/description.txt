This delightful ballet tells the story of Dr Coppelius, an eccentric toymaker, 
who attempts to bring life to his beautiful doll CoppÃ©lia. He is foiled by the mischievous Swanilda, who masquerades as CoppÃ©lia and saves her love, Franz, from the Doctorâ€™s magic. Recorded live at Sydney Opera House, this acclaimed production by Dame Peggy van Praagh, the founding Artistic Director of The Australian Ballet, is a triumph. 
Brilliantly directed by George Ogilvie, CoppÃ©lia captures the imagination with its dramatic edge and visual charm.
