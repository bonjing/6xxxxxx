          Heyoka's earlier works were identifiable by their crushing basslines and "spacey" blips and glitches, Whomp Gland extends Heyoka's range from mellow dubs and glitchy bass tracks to a newer dubbed out version of instrumental Hip Hop. He is fast becoming one of San Francisco''s hottest new producer / performers on the scene.
His early influences in Downtempo, Dub and IDM combined with more recent midtempo dancefloor genres from the likes of Bassnectar, Glitch Mob, ill.gates and An-ten-nae have helped create a very unique sound that combines relentless basslines, hip hop and dub rhythms with a lot of musicality and melody.

          Also people, this is one of my first torrents. I noticed that there were only two albums up on TPB so I decided to put these up for the people :) Help me seed and keep these FUCKING AWESOME pieces of music going! And if you're wondering how "Heyoka" is pronounced, it's "Hi-Yoka", not "Hey-Yoka". Peace, smoke weed.. and have a good time
