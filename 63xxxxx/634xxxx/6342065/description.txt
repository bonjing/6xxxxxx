In the premier episode of Tokyo Bliss, Shingo Nakamura laid upon us a beautifully chilled out mix featuring great new music from many Otographic Music artists as well as tunes from elsewhere in the scene. This week Kyohei Akagawa takes the reins and presents to us another reason why we should pay special attention to the progressive house scene coming out of Japan. As if we didn't have enough reasons to already!

There are a few really unique gems here, including a bootleg of Oceanlab's Satellite by Akagawa himself that will definitely melt many hearts out there. We're also anxious to find out what the name of track #2 on the mix is--definitely one of those distinctly Japanese prog house tunes following perfectly after Airo, which Eco included in the most recent episode of his podcast, The Sound of You(th). Each track has been carefully selected, spanning a nice variety of top-notch music, including some darker tunes in the middle of the mix such as my personal favorite, Weekend Heroes' Fear Factor.

So with that we hope you'll subscribe on iTunes, and download a HQ version of the mix here (right click and "save as").
