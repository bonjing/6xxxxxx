Shamanism & Spiritual Growth

Date: 04-26-11 
Host: George Noory 
Guests: Hank Wesselman, Lauren Weinstein 
Anthropologist and author Hank Wesselman discussed his eight years of visitations, begun in 1996, with the late Hawaiian shaman and kahuna Hale Makua, who was like the Dalai Lama to the Polynesian world. As he chanted the names of his ancestors, "I could see him very subtly transforming...as ancestor after ancestor used the bridge that he was creating to come through his body, and through his mind, into our world," he said of Makua. 

Makua gave Wesselman a gift-- a wooden bowl he called the "bowl of light," which represented the Aumakua (our higher self). Every time we step into the negative polarity some of this light gets diminished, Makua said, adding that the problem with the world today is that it's run primarily by "men whose bowls of light are filled by stones." According to Makua, people play out a primary role or archetype in each lifetime: server, artist, warrior, scholar, explorer/sage, priest/healer, or chief. 

Makua told Wesselman of an Ancestral Grand Plan, which stressed connection rather separation and included a political foundation based on compassion, and the removal of national and religious barriers, as well as the idea that humans are in the process of becoming gods. Wesselman also reviewed his visions of experiencing life as one of his descendant selves in a tropical forest near the flooded valley of central California. He believes this possibly represents our future after global warming and the rise of sea level have taken hold. 

Sony Security Breach
First hour guest, Internet privacy advocate Lauren Weinstein reported on a security breach into Sony's PlayStation Network, in which members' private information was compromised. "How Sony managed this big of a fail is beyond the ken of most people looking at this right now," he commented. He also talked about how technology has advanced in the area of cell phone tracking and bugging, though most people probably aren't going to be targets of this type of intrusion.
