Press For Truth Presents Into The Fire
World leaders and activists from around the world gathered for the G20 Summit. With over 19,000 police officers and security personnel on hand, the results lead to over 1100 arrests, martial law in downtown Toronto, and the most massive violation of civil liberties in Canadian history.

Press For Truth is a team of videographers, investigative journalists and political activists. We do our best to expose the global elite and their plans for a new world order. My name is Dan Dicks and in 2006 I got the idea to start an alternative media group based in Toronto known as Press For Truth. Since then I've made a lot of contacts and great friends nationwide who are now part of the PFT team. Together we comprise an organization of dedicated patriots who are committed to covering issues which the mainstream media is not willing to touch. We write and distribute articles, we make documentary films and also videos for youtube in an effort to educate the public about a variety of issues.
