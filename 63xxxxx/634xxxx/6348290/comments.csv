,XxXCohenXxX,2011-05-09T17:21Z,"i did everything how it says in the instructions but when i try to start the game it says ""Failed to load client Dll:"" what can i do?"
,1robinjazz,2011-05-11T14:52Z,this download is bullshit
,DannOrly,2011-05-13T07:51Z,"If you get the missing DLL error, you're missing files. Force a re-check in utorrent, and unzip again. If you're still having issues, I'm sorry, but there's nothing much I can do for you past that. For every 1 person who's told me they're having issues with this game there's 15 that haven't. 
Also, go away, troll. (1robinjazz)"
