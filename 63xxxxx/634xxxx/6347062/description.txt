Game History
In 1996 an arcade legend was born with the release of Metal Slug: Super Vehicle 001. The military-style themes, and a side-scrolling platform mixed with a wacky sense of humor and hilarious cartoon style, proved extremely popular to a decidedly wide audience. Based on this success, seven more Metal Slug sequels would be developed and released.

Ten years later, The Metal Slug game play and popularity are still going strong. To celebrate, the creators of the Metal Slug Anthology stopped at nothing to provide a 2-D, side-scrolling compilation for the Wii that is perfectly compatible with all the great game play possibilities that the Wii has to offer.

Storyline and Gameplay
Each included game in the Metal Slug Anthology offers game play and game objectives centered around a futuristic battle between two military groups known as the Regular army, and the Rebellion. In 2026, the Rebellion army launches an assault that pushes the Regular army forces to the brink of destruction. With superior numbers of troops and weapons, the Rebels overwhelmed the Regular army in all aspects.

Seeing their disadvantage to carry out direct attacks against the Rebellion, the Regular army then decided to carry out numerous special operations and create certain vehicles to accompany their commandos. As a direct result of this new plan, a newly designed tank code named "Metal Slug" was put into production.

Unfortunately, the Rebellion captured many of the newly produced Metal Slug tanks, and starting using them against the Regular army. With their government and military in shambles, the Regular army gathered its scattered troops and launched a desperate counter attack; recapture the stolen vehicles and use them to destroy the opposition. If the vehicles can't be captured, destroy them.

Your job is to help the Regular army defeat the Rebellion by using a myriad of different male and female characters, vehicles (including various animals and tanks), and weapons.

The Subsequent releases of Metal Slug titles (all included in the Anthology), continued to incorporate different antagonists, with more high-tech means and methods employed to attack the Regular army. Experience all the action and storylines with Metal Slug Anthology.
