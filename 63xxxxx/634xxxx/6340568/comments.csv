,madlax10,2011-05-25T21:57Z,"Game works fine offline but doesn't work online.  I followed all of the steps provided but whenever I join a server, the screen goes to the loading screen for 1 second and then backs out to the main menu with no explanation as to why.  Anyone know how to fix this?  Any help would be appreciated!"
,aghababak,2011-05-26T07:10Z,"I downloaded this and I noticed its the installed version of the game. where can I find the dvd installation rip version so that I could actually install it myself properly?

also when I ran the game and tried to play offline campaigne mode it came up with ""Searching for games"" and it stuck there and nothing happened.

next time you people put a game online for download make sure you put the dvd version which requires installation not a pre-installed version of it. why?

because it wont always work on everyones system and causes issues then you get lots of replies from others in here that it does not work. common sense?!

what a headache it caused me! 

any proper cracks that would make the game work just like any other games?"

,C0rinth,2011-05-31T01:45Z,"I downloaded and extracted it, and the loading screen that takes you to the main menu takes like 25 seconds to load, is that normal?

But the main question I have - the reason i created an account on here - is when i try to play an offline game it just says ""Searching for games"" just like the user ""aghababak"" said. Did I do something wrong? PLEASE help."
,C0rinth,2011-05-31T10:56Z,"Nevermind, I'm a idiot. I assumed the first mode would be offline, but you have to go left once. ;s

after doing the -steam thing it works great offline, but i can't seem to create a Garena account. Their website doesn't show up too well and it wouldn't acknowledge i had entered an email for the registration (it said email is invalid/empty), after creating a fake facebook and synching it up with the registration I still got every username I could concieve of show up ""this username is taken"". Even a bunch of random letters & numbers says this. I've tried this with IE 9 and Firefox.

Did I do something wrong? Is the website hacked/glitching? A way around it? A patch to play cracked servers that'd work with this torrent?

Also some modded addon levels have red ""Error""s floating around and purple checkered textures. Any ideas? Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you, uploader!"
,criscore98,2011-06-08T10:20Z,is the online is working because i wanna play online
,billis89,2011-06-09T14:14Z,"to remove that fuckin prob you must go to a garena room of l4d2 and go to settings down right and put at game bootstrap parameters this -steam

Ooh, it's so thrilling! The zombies are out there. We have some kind of mission. Now the zombies are attacking! Kill them!

,bravo2011,2011-08-16T20:43Z,"**POSSIBLE VIRUS ALERT**
 I'm in no way a noob and know all about false positives on cracks and keygens, they happen alot I know , but my antivius AND PC acted much differently with this torrent. My AVG paid version went just apeshit over this one then my malwarebytes almost crashed after blocking multiple attempts of a suspicious ip address trying to log onto my computer and then after the game menu was launched the program was requesting permission AGAIN to change settings on my PC.  This torrent could have been modified by an unknown source or it was cracked differently and is acting like this and is COMPLETELY SAFE But its not worth the risk to me when there are better versions of this game on the net. I ended up using the left 4 dead 2 SFK found on this site. It works perfect after the standalone patch is installed."
