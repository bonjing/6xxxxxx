We don't mind, and we have no interest (or resources) to hunt you down.

CatPig Team, makers of Radium."
,D0ct0rFun,2011-04-27T06:17Z,"How COOL that pirates get a discount! Went there and saw it's less than 7$.
Killer deal!"
,zogulusnig,2011-05-08T23:50Z,"CatPig Studios wins the prize.  I very regularly DL torrents of cracked software to try the full package before buying.

I have bought a great many apps this way (Playback was my most recent), and I will follow through with this for Radium, as well.

Thanks for not freaking out on us, CatPig."

I'd like to point out I'm only pirating this app because you've increased the price from $10 ($7) to $24.99 ($17.49). Your greed disgusts me considering this app would be useless without the FREE radio station streams it requires.

I will encourage others on Mac OS X to pirate this app as a result."

We understand how you feel. In reality the $10 price tag was just a Mac App Store promo for about a month or so. Radium cost $24.99 since last November, starting with version 2.7.

Shoot us an email if you have any questions about Radium! =)"

Dont be such a tool to a team who have kept this version up to date with hard work and you decry paying them a discounted price for a rather good bit of software.

You can use itunes for free you know instead of ripping on them.  Can you name me another application that will play BBC radio stations or a plethora of others (Planet rock, radio caroloine) for free.  Itunes btw doesn't have the BBC stations on there ;-)  I do agree that $24.99 is a touch steep on that side of things


Yes I DID download this BUT i purchased it when the price came down after the Yarrr offer.

Btw. 2.7.9 don;t update it to the latest version else it wont work."
,oceanspeed,2011-07-21T15:58Z,"@CatPig

Its a shame the 30% off is then negated by having to pay 20% vat here in the uk giving us almost 10% off but not quite.."
,CatPig,2011-08-10T01:32Z,"@oceanspeed Yes, unfortunately local taxes are imposed by our payment processor, which has to play by the (upcoming) laws regarding ""digital purchase taxation"", etc. It's a mess, but it's going to be the reality for the majority of online purchases soon."
,rerikm,2011-11-26T07:13Z,"I do believe 'catpigstudios' could make even more money if they lower prices. Many more would pay 2 or 3 bucks to have this app. $25 its obscene!!
come on, Lion OS X cost $30. How your little app could be compared with such a huge OS??
Do you have 500 employees or something??  I love this app but I'm so not paying that much.
Please, go figure a better business plan!!!!!!!
Good luck!
