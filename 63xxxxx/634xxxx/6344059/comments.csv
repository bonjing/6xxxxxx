[V],globeplus,2011-04-25T23:30Z,"CURIOSITY ABOUT THIS FILE :

,expert01,2011-04-26T00:44Z,Does this have update 2 integrated?
[V],globeplus,2011-04-26T00:46Z,"NOTE : PORTAL 2 DON´T HAVE ANYMORE THE VPK ARCHIVE JUST IN A VERY COMMON PC GAME PRESENTATION AND ALL THE GAME IS FINE AND COMPLETE IN THIS VERSION INCLUDED ON THIS SPECIAL PORTAL GAMES FILE .
WHEN I STARTED PLAYING A WHILE I GET THE FEELING THAT MANY USERS OUT THERE ALREADY PLAYED THE 1ST GAME AND HIS SUCESS WAS THE VALID MOTIVE FOR THE INTEREST GENERATED FOR PLAYING THE 2ND GAME , SO SIMPLY STARTED MAKING SENSE A FILE WITH BOTH PORTAL GAMES WITH AN EASY INTERFACE ACESS BECAUSE THE STYLE AND ADDICTION TO THE PLAYER OF THE GAME IT IS A POINT , SO HAVING BOTH PORTAL GAMES COMPLETE AND FREE TO USE WITH A NICE INTERFACE IT IS REALLY A DREAM FOR ANY PLAYER THAT ALREADY PLAYED ANY OF THIS GAMES ...

CHEERS AND GOD LOVES ALL OF YOU ..."
,expert01,2011-04-26T01:11Z,I'm not sure if that comment was addressed at mine or not :\ Does this torrent have Portal 2 Update 2 (or at least Update 1) included?
[V],globeplus,2011-04-26T01:43Z,"To exper01 : no updates but backup the game if you try them , sometimes the worked executables can cause problems or anomalies on the games after applied .

Cheers and thank you for your comments ."
[V],globeplus,2011-04-26T03:09Z,"Instructions Update .

It takes close 8 minutesto the audio of both games be ok and ready to go what i forget to say on the instructions , just a little clue to help about the moment when the games are ready is that the games are ready when the oggdec.exe disappear on the front of the game file , that is the sign that thework finished , i am sorry for this little lapse but this file is a consequence of reasearch for days and this particular PORTAL DREAM was all day since morning yesterday beeing worked carefully step by step until be finished , ok now this small lapse it is said it .

Cheers and it is TOUCHÃ‰ this file about PORTAL games . See all of you ."
[V],globeplus,2011-04-26T03:23Z,"INSTRUCTIONS UPDATE


1  unzip the PORTAL DREAM.7zip then run the AudioDecoder.exe on the extracted folder ,
    it takes close 8 minutes to the audio be decoded and both games ready to go
    (the indicator that the audio is decoded is when the small oggedec.exe disappear on the front of file folder)

2  run the PortalDream.exe then run the Portals 1 or 2 and for 2 use if you want the multi-21
    or use the QuickVideoConfiguration 

NOTE : on the audio symbol one click the sound restart , with a double click he turns off





* PORTAL DREAM * GLOBE GAME FILES 2011 *"

[V],globeplus,2011-04-27T00:40Z,"To DangerDan43257 : you have to tell me what i did to you for you beeing implicating with anything i do ? WhatÂ´s your point really ? Are you connected with the concorrence or you are just having fun trying to borring me ? I respect my work and all the possible users and many of the files are lot of work ! Please respect uploaders that respect the users trying to make the best work possible to them and i can recognise positive critics in order to improve the files but implications constantly for no special reason is a little bit too much , it is like i must need that someone find a reason to implicate with me ! Give me a break , do your own valid work then say whatever you want or support possible critics or implications from the users then you probably understand , my work is correct and you know it no matter what you say !!

Cheers and god be with all of you ."
,djME2k,2011-04-27T08:25Z,"@globeplus:

Thanks for your work here, good job.  It is nice having a decent bundle package for the Portal series that actually works and is convenient.  Well done!

(p.s... I don't think you know what ""implicate"" means.  ;)  Not a big deal, but just figured since it seems you like to use the word pretty often when dealing with @$$holes online, ya might check it out in a dictionary.  Don't worry, I'm not trying to ""implicate"" you.)  ;)"
[V],globeplus,2011-04-27T13:18Z,"To djME2k : i tried to men with the word ""implicate"" someone that no matter what always try to contesting what i do , this is the mean of the word .

Thank you for your comment and enjoy your game file , i confess that iÂ´d like to see more users , not only because was lot of work but i really think and believe that it is the best file for this games without any doubt farway from any other file , solid work , great small size that turns in a more than 9.1 gb file folder after extraction and audio decoding and very pratical to use with both games accessable from a menu click and new portal games can easily be addicionated with a little work ... simply superb !!!"

,Game_tester_for_everyone,2011-04-28T18:59Z,"THIS TORRENT IS FAKE
I am a computer technician, a gamer and I know how torrents work and this one is fake.
After extracting and allowing the audio to unpack I tried the game, the first little bit looks normal but several items are missing.
When you try some of the other levels they look incomplete and many background items are missing like walls and characters."
[V],globeplus,2011-04-29T10:13Z,"To Game_Tester_For_Everyone : WHO IS THE FAKE HERE IS YOU !!! GET A LIFE MORRON ... BOTH GAMES ARE OK AND NICE WORKED , CHECK AGAIN IF YOU DID EVRYTHING CORRECT AND WAIT TO THE OGGDEC.EXE DISAPPEAR TO HAVE THE SIGN THAT THE AUDIO IS CODIFIED ... THIS IS EXCELENT WORK ... GO TESTING KIDS GAMES ... JESUS CHRIST , I REALLY DON´T GET LUCK WITH SOME USERS ... Sorry for my behaviour somehow but some comments takes me a little bit out of the serious ... thank you for understand ."

pls help with this one problem about textures.and Thanks for the rip"

,DangerDan43257,2011-04-29T19:35Z,"@globe no m8 iv got nothing personal against you, its just the way u do things, im a tptb and recently a kaos fan, i just dont like the fact that tptb rip a game, get it out before you and you release exacally the same with almost unwatchable movies just to get it smaller, and kaos are normally late with there releases but u can see why when u try one, and all you done so far is steal and copy there there methods like you cant think of a way to do it yourself. n yes this release contains batch commands used by kaos and the same audio compression.

,vk89,2011-05-03T13:32Z,well i have downloaded many torrents by globe ... never find problem in any of them ..... but this one has some problems .... like frequent crashses and texture missing so.......  globe update the missing texture for this game .... not working untill .... thanks 
,pandit734,2011-05-03T14:31Z,globe is uploading other files but not replying here i think he also know this rip is not good.

,djnv2010,2011-05-05T16:02Z,"it's a shame, Globe used to release quality rips way before TPTB, now videos & sounds are missing, this one seems like an incomplete beta of the game!! oh, and his blog is now gone!! hmmmm, interesting...oh well there's still TPTB (even though they haven't released anything in a while) & there's Kaos...anyone know of other GOOD direct play game rippers?"

,SilenceWillFall,2011-05-09T22:02Z,"@globeplus:

This is really silly, there is one problem with your first release and a different problem with this release* - if you combined the two it would be perfect, no flaws, take the working gameplay from one and mix it with the working audio from the other. Is there any way you can do that so it's perfectly perfect? Or is it just me that has this problem?

* the problem with the light version is that it's not got any sound, and the problem with the Dream version is that it crashes during gameplay and has elements from the scene missing (eg walking in air rather than on a gangway).  "

,soldierofthelam,2011-06-10T17:58Z,"In globes defense,
 he had moved and changed service providers which is a lower speed then what he had, so uploaded games will take a long time. that is why he hasn't released any games."
