this is i think the most complete collection of the first doctor who series,it includes reconstructed episodes using available materials such as sound tracks and stills plus every episode that survives in its original form.
there are 16 discs files are avi divx.
i am sorry for the lack of technical info i am a fan rather than an expert uploader but i hope you will enjoy my contribution.
