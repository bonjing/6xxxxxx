This torrent contains a complete Blind Guardian studio discography, in FLAC quality. The older albums aren't really included, only the 2007 remasters. The original older albums will be included later

FLAC quality: everything is transcoded with level 8 compression, assuring the smallest file size.

File naming scheme: (year - album/track - date), suitable even for cheap music players. Every album contains artwork (cover.jpg at the very least). 

Artwork: I tried to keep a sane file size, without compromising quality a lot. JPG @ 80% quality or so. 

I have also removed all the useless extra crap (nfo, m3u, txt, log) and converted complete disc rips to one track per file storage scheme, thus removing the cue sheets too.
