Simon Mayo hosts a new comedy show that pits the comic generations against each other to find out which is the funniest. 

Act Your Age was a radio panel show which 'tried to determine which age of comedy was the greatest'.

Each edition featured Simon Mayo giving out a series of different comedy games and challenges to the three teams. There was the 'Up-And-Comers', lead by Jon Richardson, the 'Current Crop' captained by Lucy Porter, and the 'Old Guard' who had Roy Walker at the helm.
