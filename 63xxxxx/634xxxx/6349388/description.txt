The film depicts a married couple, Dean Pereira (Gosling) and Cindy Heller (Williams), shifting back and forth in time between their courtship and the dissolution of their marriage several years later.
Dean is a young high school dropout, working for a New York City moving company. Cindy is a pre-med student living with her unhappy parents and caring for her grandmother in Pennsylvania. They meet by chance and fall deeply in love in a matter of weeks. They rush into marriage after discovering Cindy is pregnant from a previous boyfriend, Bobby (Mike Vogel). Dean agrees to raise Cindy's daughter, Frankie, as his own. Before the wedding Bobby, unaware of Cindy's pregnancy, finds and assaults Dean at his job.
