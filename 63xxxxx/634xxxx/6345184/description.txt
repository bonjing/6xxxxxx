Review on Amazon:

"There are approximately 8 or 9 fights on here. They're real fights, including boxing matches, bare knuckle matches, and some allow the competitors to continue pummeling the opponent when they're down. I think there were one or two girls in here that were actually attractive. Well, one at least. About three of the fights are fairly descent, three full rounds with a good amount of action. A couple of the fights end after one girl gets punched a few times and decides to quit. A few others are totally inexperienced girls flailing away at each other, completely unable to hurt each other, so they eventually become exhausted. One fight has a fat girl vs. two normal sized girls, and it's like a fight from the Jerry Springer show. There are at least 5,000 punches thrown but they're wearing padded headgear and nobody can hurt anybody. In one of the good fights, one of the girls gets her sports bra bulled up and you get to see, well, you know.

Overall, it wasn't bad. A few good fights, some silly ones, and some amateurs swinging away. I bought mine from an Amazon vendor and got a really good price, so I'm not disappointed. I give it an average 3 out of 5. "
