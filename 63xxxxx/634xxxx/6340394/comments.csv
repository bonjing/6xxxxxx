,RedApathy,2011-04-24T19:40Z,Note: It's actually about 11 hours of audio. The description says 5 because it was broken into parts.
,h2opololea,2011-06-18T17:34Z,"How do you add this to iTunes (or get it on an MP3 player) so that it will play in order?  None of the playlists seem to add for me.  If I open the Windows Media Player or .xpsf file it will play, but I'd like to make it more portable :)

Otherwise, I can verify that this upload works and the quality is good!"
,h2opololea,2011-06-18T17:58Z,"I'm an idiot, but in case anyone else is having trouble - you canNOT drag and drop playlists into iTunes.  You have to go to File>Library>Import Playlist.  Once you do that iTunes recognizes them (I tested with the M3u file) and the play order is fine.

Thanks!"

,killyourself,2011-08-14T03:09Z,Does anyone else know of a torrent for the 2nd and 3rd books??
,cashleydubs,2011-10-10T21:16Z,This copy ends halfway through the book! It only contains 5/11 hours. DO NOT DOWNLOAD if you want the FULL book! Ugh!
,RedApathy,2011-11-04T10:31Z,cashleydubs > only a half download for you maybe. No problems for anybody else.!

,jfw98,2012-03-20T03:28Z,Fantastic torrent. Easy to use and all there
,7b,2012-03-20T08:16Z,ID3 tags are all super fucked up. Had to spend 20 minutes renaming them all in iTunes to get them right. Why couldn't uploader have done that to begin with?
