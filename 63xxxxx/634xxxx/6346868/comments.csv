,DickDickstein,2011-04-27T09:33Z,OK...there is literally no way I can see a movie that appears to be this bad and not watch it. 
,DickDickstein,2011-04-28T04:37Z,"This is a really shitty and poorly made movie. Quality is relative to that. You really can'trip it better so quality is fine, but you aren't gonna give a fuck either way once you start this.

A: 10
V: 10
M: 2/10 as a movie taken seriously. 7/10 for comedic purposes. 10/10 for nudity.

This movie is damn near a porn. Nudity constantly . They even show close ups of pussy lips quite often. 

This is one you show people to see if they can believe how horrible it is. 

Don't forget to watch all the weird shit after the credits either. There are like 30 minutes of odd previews and trailers for other shit movies. "
