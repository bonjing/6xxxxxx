For reference, this is S08E01"
,TiNiK,2011-04-26T14:38Z,Thank you!
,blackdragon13,2011-04-26T14:49Z,@the_gray_mac  No this is S02E01.  That's what tvrage.com says. They separate American Chopper and American Chopper: Senior vs. Junior as two different series. 
,StrideyB,2011-04-26T20:07Z,"pupupeepee appreciate your uploads of Senior vs. Junior.
blackdragon13 is correct. Senior vs. Junior is classed as a different TV Program so to speak than American Chopper & this is S02E01"
,vteccer666,2011-04-26T20:37Z,thanks for the up much appreciated
,the_gray_mac,2011-04-27T13:29Z,"@blackdragonfly agreed this is S02 of Snr vs Jnr, but S01 was listed as S07 through TPB. "

Thanks man, I'll take it. Seems like you're the only one so far. I have cable but I can never get the timing for the showtime and my ass on the couch to coincide."
