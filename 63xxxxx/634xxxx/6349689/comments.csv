A/9 
V/9 
Has Russian audio dubbed over the movie after 1:46:16 Itâ€˜s only the last two minutes but this doesnâ€˜t spoil the ending... (itâ€˜s just a biker asking him to do a job for his brother, whoâ€˜s been caught with 50kg of coke in his girlfriends mini van and he says that heâ€˜ll do the job for free,well thatâ€˜s roughly what happens!!) 
Many Thanx to DUBLiN5 and FiRMA for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"
,funkAdub3,2011-04-28T22:20Z,Good except for the missing parts of audio...kinda killed it.
,aobserver,2011-05-09T13:52Z,"WOW WTF IS THE UPLOADERS PROBLEM?
GREAT QUALITY FILM, AUDIO WAS PRETTY MUCH SOLID UNTIL THE FUCKING RUSSIAN. GOD DAMMIT SO ANNOYING, AND AT THE EXACT END OF THE MOVIE. FUCKING RETARDED IDIOT PIECE OF SHIT.

LUCKILY I HAVE BSPLAYER AND I WAS PREPARED WITH SUBTITLES.

FUCK YOU DUBLINS. GREAT UPLOAD QUALITY
V10
A -1 FOR BEING RETARDED.
SILENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER INSTEAD OF RUSSIAN."
