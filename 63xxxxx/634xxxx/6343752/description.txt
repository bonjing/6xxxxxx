This torrent is a collection of two books (The Market and Markets, Deliberation and Environment) and one article (Socialist Calculation and Environmental Valuation) by professor John O'Neill, currently professor of Political Economy at the University of Manchester.

These books are excellent for anyone interested in non-market alternatives, whether for ethical, environmental, or any other reasons.

And to professor O'Neill: sorry for uploading your work illegally. But it's really expensive, and I think people would benefit from exposure to it. And consider also that you yourself make an excellent case against intellectual property in The Market :)
