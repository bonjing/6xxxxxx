Duane C. Hanselman, "Brushless Permanent Magnet Motor Design,2 Ed"
Magna Physics Pub | 2006 | ISBN: 1881855155 | 392 pages | PDF 

Written for electrical, electronics, and mechanical engineers responsible for designing and specifying motors, the book provides details of brushless DC and synchronous motors, as well as both radial and axial motor topologies. Beginning with a discussion of the fundamentals of generic motor design, it logically progresses to a set of more advanced, yet easily understandable, concepts for designing brushless permanent-magnet motors. In addition, the author fully explains techniques for magnetic modeling and circuit analysis, shows how magnetic circuit analysis applies to motor design, describes all major aspects of motor operation and design in simple mathematical terms, develops rigourous design equations for radial flux and axial flux motors, and illustrates basic motor drive schemes. All common motor design terms are clearly defined and a wealth of charts, tables and equations are included.
