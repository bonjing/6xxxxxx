 Dr. Vasi invents a super-powered robot, Chitti,
 in his own image. The scientific body, AIRD    
 , that must approve the robot, declines it     
 based on its not having emotions and the abilit
 to make rational judgment. A sudden flash of   
 lightning evokes emotions in the robot, and    
 Chitti is seemingly ready for integration into 
 the human world. Then, Chitti falls in love    
 with Dr. Vasi's fiancÃ©e Sana and turns on his  
 creator.
