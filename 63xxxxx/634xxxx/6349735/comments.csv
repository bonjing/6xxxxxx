,themorningstar69,2011-04-30T18:22Z,"Thank You so much for this one HR, I finally got around to applying it, worked soooo quick and was very easy and I have tested it does in fact work, Thanks again (-:"
,themorningstar69,2011-05-08T09:17Z,"OK.... When applying this on my Mac, it worked immediately.  However, I can not get this to work on my PC with Windows.  I'm sure I am just doing something wrong or missing something, but any help would be great."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-05-08T16:05Z,re-read the instructions.  attempt to follow them word for word.  works fine on my end.
,themorningstar69,2011-05-08T21:12Z,"Does it matter if it is Windows XP?  I open iTunes, go to TV, hit edit and select all.  I then right click on winupdatedesc.js and click open with command prompt.  A command line like screen pops up for about a second and disappears.  This is similar to the method and result I used on the Mac, but without the intended affect.  I was hoping you may know what part I am doing wrong?  Thanks HR for the DL and to anyone who can help."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-05-13T22:38Z,"Maybe it only works on vista and windows 7.  I no longer have windows xp machines.  You would have to run the command from the actually command prompt to see what error it is throwing.  Could be you are missing some package that is default in windows 7.
