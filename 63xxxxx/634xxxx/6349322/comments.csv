so we can share our thoughts...

I didnt see any other ups, but I just did a quick search. But anyway, I guarantee these are the best quality out there, so the smart people will know to get this one ;) haha. Thanks for looking out.

Coming very soon: Re-upload of the broken lizard movie pack (quality upgrade on all, Add stand-up special, no subtitles in Super troopers, and extended version of Club Dread) and monk complete series."

(And that's no hyperbole!)


I LOVE THIS SHOW. Many of the people behind Frisky Dingo worked on it, not least H. Jon Benjamin, and as much as I love that show, this one is so much better. I was so happy to hear a 16-episode third season has been approved. I rewatch these shows constantly, they never cease to entertain, and I'm always finding little bits of dialogue I hadn't previously noticed.

I've D/L'ed almost every Archer torrent out there, and after comparing all of them, this one rules them all! It is an excellent effort, and my first D/L from you, mkvGOD; I am VERY pleased by your results. The file size is INCREDIBLY small for such great quality.

My only quibble is the volume is a little low, but that is trivial and only requires a knob turn. It's not so low that raising it to adequate levels introduces any speaker hiss.

mkvGOD, you did an outstanding job here. If you could get a season 2 DVDRIP of this quality, I would be eternally grateful. On some episodes - and this goes for EVERY TVRip of season 2 out there - in the beginning of some episodes the rating graphic in the upper left-hand corner covers something that should be seen. For instance, this is especially noticeable in the beginning of the 'Movie Star' episode. The actress's face is completely hidden.

But as of now I haven't found a (real & complete) season 2 DVDRip, so your season 2 TVRip & season 1 DVDRip combo here is THE most excellent quality I've EVER found.

Kudos!"
