A collection of moody instrumental experiments, The Shutov Assembly was recorded by 
Brian Eno between 1985 and 1990. An overt dalliance with atonality, this recording 
abandons most conventional concepts of pitch, modes, and scales. With most of the 10 
compositions shifting gradually and without discernible focus, this is one of Eno's more varied ambient collections. Other than treated keyboard, conventional instrumentation is eschewed. The final recipe results in one ghostly, subdued soundscape after another. Brian Eno's minimalist leanings have rarely been in greater evidence than on this album.
