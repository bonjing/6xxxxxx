Infomation

Aided by Stetsasonic's Daddy O on a pair of cuts ("Make It Funky" and "Top Billin'"), Audio Two's full-length debut is a patchy affair, just like the albums that would follow from the Brooklyn duo. Neither Gizmo Dee nor his brother Milk are proficient rappers with above average lyrical capabilities, but the way they play off each other is occasionally enough to cause some excitement. "Top Billin'" stands easily as the best track here, thanks in no small part to Daddy O's sparse yet infectious work -- the beat would later reappear in Mary J. Blige's "Real Love." Other entertaining moments include "Hickeys Around My Neck" and "Make It Funky." ~ Andy Kellman
