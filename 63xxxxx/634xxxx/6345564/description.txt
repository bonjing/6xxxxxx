   I Love You Phillip Morris (2009)

  Steven Russell (Jim Carrey) is happily married to Debbie (Leslie Mann), and 
  a member of the local police force when a car accident provokes a dramatic 
  reassessment of his life. Steven becomes open about his homosexuality and 
  decides to live life to the fullest - even if it means breaking the law. 
  Steven's new, extravagant lifestyle involves cons and fraud and, eventually, 
  a stay in the State Penitentiary where he meets sensitive, soft-spoken 
  Phillip Morris (Ewan McGregor). His devotion to freeing Phillip from jail 
  and building the perfect life together prompts Steven to attempt and often 
  succeed at one impossible con after another.
