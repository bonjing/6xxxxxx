A rare nexus of optimal swell, marquee surfers and skilled, dedicated surf cinematographers created a vast library of surfing's greatest moments over the last three decades.

Director Ira Opper and writer Matt Warshaw have painstakingly sifted the best of the best -- from "Cosmic Children" to "September Sessions" -- to bring you a premium no filler blend of touchstone moments, genuine humor, eye opening surf action and authentic surf culture. Witness Uluwatu ridden for the first time in Alby Falzon's 1971 watershed "Morning of the Earth." See Shaun Tomson and Mark Richards' epic tube duel at Off the Wall in Bill Delaney's 1978 "Free Ride."

Peer into the future with Kelly Slater's Indonesian performances in Jack Johnson's "September Sessions." As well, featured footage includes: Scott Dittrich's Fluid Drive, Steve Soderberg's Ocean Fever, Scott Dittrich's Amazing Surf Stories and Sonny Millers' Searching for Curren.
