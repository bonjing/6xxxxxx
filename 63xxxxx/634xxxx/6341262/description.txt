Thanks go out to the ULer of the original CD files of this audiobook, but I don't like how most audiobooks--like this one--are arbitrarily divided by length. I have split all of the files into individual chapters, which I think most people would agree is a better format.

There are two versions of the complete and unabridged audiobook in this torrent. You can choose the mp3 version (each chapter is a single file, 24 files in total), or you can choose the fully chapterized m4b (iPod/iPhone or similar device) version (2 fully chapterized files, already tagged for iTunes). Both versions are at 128 kbps.

Also included in the torrent is a PDF companion ebook with all of the book's original appendices along with illustrations & maps (which I made myself, thanks to Amazon's "Look Inside" feature).

Enjoy and please seed!

SUMMARY . . .

The saga of CortÃ©s, Montezuma, and the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire has been chronicled repeatedly, and with justification, since it is one of the seminal events in world history. There is probably no new information on the conquest left to uncover, but it is a thrilling, moving, and tragic story well worth retelling. Levy is not a professional historian, but he is a fine writer who knows the material, and he is wise enough to allow the pure excitement and drama of the story to unfold naturally. At the center of the tale, of course, are the two protagonists. CortÃ©s is viewed as an intriguing combination of ruthless ambition, religious piety, and surprising tenderness. Montezuma, also deeply religious, was less a man of action than CortÃ©s, and his contemplative nature probably sealed his doom. As Levy illustrates, this was also an earthshaking clash of civilizations that is still working itself out five centuries later. This is a superb work of popular history, ideal for general readers.
