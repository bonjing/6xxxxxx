,dkhere,2011-05-31T16:00Z,"The only problem of this torrent is the hard cored subs... Rest all are awesome...
Too bad there is only one season for this one..."
,pjsmoke,2011-06-21T20:15Z,"The reason there is only 1 ""season"" is because it is a mini-series, not a tv series...

Anyway, shame about the hardcoded chinese subs as I would of liked to download this. Anyway, whatever."
,duranachampion,2011-09-01T15:41Z,dont download this shit...harcoded subs in some foreign language...maybe mandarin.
