Annie Lennox has excellent lead vocals, while Dave Stewart is not only a performer, but also a music producer and historian. Throughout the eighties, they made consistently great songs and often great albums. Their main influence as Eurythmics was to prove that the genre that based itself primarily in electronics was not without a soul; they had transcended whatever limits the genre had initially imposed and began blending all sorts of styles. That kind of stylistic cross cutting made for an amazing batch of singles, all available in this greatest hits.
