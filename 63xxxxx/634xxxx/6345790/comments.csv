There is no scientific content or trivia but then again, it doesn't come accross as a documentry so much as the sort of thing they play for kids on a ceiling mounted screen at the dentist. I actually had to stop it because I couldn't handle the narator so I don't know how it ends, but I suspect they found Nemo.
Anyway, VOMIT always submits good quality rips and I would like to say thanks man. I know you are not the director or the narator so all is good. Keep em coming VOMIT. Cheers!"
