HOT MOVES is a 1 DVD addition to The Master Course thatâ€™s all about making single shots and master shots look absolutely awesome.

Where The Master Course focuses on drama and coverage, HOT MOVES focuses on a very different angle of how to make single shots look super expensive and sexy for their own sake. What is fascinating is that the vast majority of truly awesome and trailer-worthy shots come from just a handful of techniques, which we explore in HOT MOVES.

While it of course lends itself to very high-budget shooting, the majority of the techniques can be executed even on a very low budget, because itâ€™s the understanding of motion that makes it a hot move, not the equipment you shoot it with.
