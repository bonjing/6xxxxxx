Drama on 3 - Wuthering Heights

Broadcast on BBC Radio 3, 8:00pm Sunday, 27th Mar 2011

A hard-hitting modernised adaptation by Jonathan Holloway of Emily Bronte's great novel of violent obsession. Heathcliff and Catherine have entered the world's imagination as great lovers. Yet they kiss once only. Dante Gabriel Rossetti described the story: 'A fiend of a book. The action is laid in Hell - only it seems places and people have English names there.' There is extraordinary cruelty and madness in the story and yet its extremes grip us and each generation since the book was first published in 1847 has made what it will of the lovers and their disasters.
