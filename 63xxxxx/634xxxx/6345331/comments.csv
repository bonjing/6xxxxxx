,majalogan,2011-06-06T02:26Z,"Help me out here

- is this an LP rip or something ? 

The tracklist seems entirely different than the official recent 2CD ""Authenticite"" various artists compilation ... 

http://www.amazon.com/Authenticite-Syliphone-Orchestres-Nationaux-1965-1980/dp/B0000AVHAN/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1307319828&sr=8-1


Please, let me know what the deal is ...

As it's fee you decide."
,majalogan,2011-06-23T08:48Z,Fuck man at least let us know! This is serious shit don't fuck up releases mislabelling them making us think this is the cd release when in fact is your own random collection of tracks ... 
,ocnrf,2011-06-23T10:38Z,"Sorry majalogan but I don't offer refunds.

However I'm contacting Pastafari, who offers a much better service"
,majalogan,2011-06-23T16:42Z,"sorry if I was rude or something, I appreciate the effort that goes into putting out the music .... 

I am a serious collector though and I just cannot understand why anyone would put out something that purports to be a specific album but then its not that album and has had tracks changed. If you do that, please inform people so they don't think they've got an album when in fact they don't"
,ocnrf,2011-06-23T18:54Z,"No big issue majalogan.

Although I suspect I'd inhaled too much and therefore failed to put the amount of detail I aim for.

By the way I was considering putting together a Guinee comp. which may appear soon."
,majalogan,2011-06-24T19:15Z,"cool ocnrf a guinee compilation would be awesome, I'm just discovering this country's music and that shit is some totally next level shit .... 

just found an online collection of Amara Toure 45s which is incredible, not sure if he is from Guinee or Mali or something. I fucken love all the guys ripping this stuff and putting it online have no idea where they find it, I live in country Sweden and no chance in hell I would ever find anything like this available for purchase.

checked out your other releases they are good man keep going fiyah bun!"
