My entire music library for those that might enjoy it, lots of it are at 320KBPS These are by no means full collections of any artist, and some bands may have as few as 1 song to them :P  But hey, if you listen to metal, and want to broaden your horizons a little bit, this could help quite a bit.

Please seed, 12GB is a big download >_<
