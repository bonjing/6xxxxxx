,michaelrwatson,2012-06-21T23:14Z,"Er, thank you i guess, but...... this is NOT the director's cut which is the same as the theatrical version from what i can find on the web. It's the special edition. As proof, this download is 138 minutes long, *NOT* 114min as stated above (the special edition has added and different footage). 

Worst of all, the video is 480x202, *NOT* 640x202. I was wondering about that 202 before i even downloaded it (doesn't usually go w/ 640x). Also, it's h264 in an AVI file which is improper, although it plays. 

All in all, seems that V3nDetta doesn't care much for providing correct nfo."
