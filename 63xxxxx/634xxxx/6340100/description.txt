Plot: Tron: Legacy is a 2010 American science fiction film directed by Joseph Kosinski and produced bySteven Lisberger. It is a sequel to the 1982 film Tron with Jeff Bridges reprising his roles as Kevin Flynn and CLU, while Bruce Boxleitner reprises his roles as Alan Bradley and Tron. Garrett Hedlund portrays Flynn's adult son, Sam.[7] The other cast members include Olivia Wilde, Beau Garrett, Michael Sheen, and James Frain.
Cast:
Jeff Bridges as Kevin Flynn, the former CEO of ENCOM International and creator of the popular arcade game Tron, which was based on his own experiences in ENCOM's virtual environment. He disappeared in 1989 while developing "a digital frontier that will reshape humanity as we know it".[10] Bridges also portrays the film's villain, Clu (Codified Likeness Utility), a more advanced incarnation of Flynn's original hacking program of the same name. Flynn designed this version of Clu to act as an "exact duplicate of himself" within The Grid.[11]
Garrett Hedlund as Sam Flynn, the film's main protagonist. The tech-savvy 27-year-old son of Kevin Flynn and majority owner of ENCOM. While investigating his father's disappearance, Sam is transported onto The Grid himself.[7]
      Owen Best plays the seven-year-old Sam Flynn.
Olivia Wilde as Quorra, a program, adept warrior and confidante of Kevin Flynn in The Grid. Flynn refers to her as his "apprentice," and has imparted volumes of information to her regarding the world outside of The Grid, which she longs to experience for herself. Wilde describes Quorra as being like Joan of Arc, a child warrior, with innocence and optimism, led by some greater power.[12][13][14] Her hairstyle was also influenced by singer Karen O.[12] Wilde also explained that although "[Quorra] could have just been another slinky, vampy temptress" it was important for her to appeal to both men and women.[12][14][15] She and Kevin Flynn are depicted as recreational Go players.[16]
Bruce Boxleitner as Alan Bradley, an executive consultant for ENCOM International,[17] close friend of Kevin Flynn, and a surrogate father figure for Sam.[10] After receiving a cryptic page from the office at the shuttered Flynn's Arcade, he encourages Sam to investigate its origin. Boxleitner also portrays Tron in flashback sequences, a security program originally developed by Bradley to monitor ENCOM's Master Control Program, and later reassigned by Flynn to defend The Grid. He also voices Rinzler, an adept masked warrior working for Clu.
Michael Sheen as Castor, a vivacious and renowned program in The Grid who runs the End of Line Club at the top of a tower in the system.[18]Sheen describes his performance as containing elements of performers such as: Ziggy Stardust; Joel Grey from Cabaret; and a bit of Frank-N-Furter from The Rocky Horror Show.[19][20]
James Frain as Jarvis, Clu's right-hand program and chief intelligence officer.[21]
Daft Punk as two masked DJ programs at Castor's End of Line Club.
Beau Garrett as Gem, one of four programs known as Sirens. The Sirens operate The Grid game armory, equipping combatants with the armor needed to compete in the games.[22][23]
Yaya DaCosta, Serinda Swan, and Elizabeth Mathis as the other three Sirens.
Cillian Murphy appears in an uncredited role as Edward Dillinger Jr., head of the software design team for ENCOM. He is the son of former ENCOM Senior Executive Ed Dillinger (portrayed by David Warner in the original film).[24]
Steven Lisberger as a bartender in the End of Line club.[24][25]
Anis Cheurfa, a stunt actor, portrays the masked warrior Rinzler.[24][26] Rinzler is named after author and Lucasfilm Executive Editor, J.W. Rinzler.[27]
