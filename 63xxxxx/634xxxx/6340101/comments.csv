,EricViking,2011-04-25T11:55Z,Does it work on Windows SBS 2008 server?
,bhood37,2011-04-25T16:02Z,"I used these tools last year when installing Windows 7, and they worked great, allowing me to do updates without issue.  However, a few days ago I got hit with the ""Windows is not genuine"", and had to revert back about 4 weeks in my backups to get rid of it.

So, beware that even though these tools will remove WAT (and I re-verified that it was not installed), some Windows update in the past month is sidestepping this and detecting the hack."
,Dumboleifi,2011-04-26T16:58Z,So there's no working activator?
,Torpeza,2011-04-26T21:37Z,I followed the indications and it worked perfectly. Thank you very much pal for sharing this with us !
,ShinSonJazrin,2011-04-27T00:41Z,I can verify that M$ Essentials is at least 1 program that's allow activation updates in.
,meneer_pieter,2011-04-28T17:04Z,"@uploader: Thanks, works fine for Win7 64bit SP1 :)

@cosmoliu: your activator gives an error message on 64bit and tries to connect to the internet - doesn't look like a safe keygen to use."
,BvIsIoN,2011-05-06T05:13Z,"I have seen a few updates that specifically try to bypass these kinds of tools, and I'm sure Microsoft knows their own software better than anyone, and with this being older tools, I'm sure they are aware of what they do. The trick is to figure out what updates do, and disable/hide indeffinatly the ones that work around this stuff :) "
