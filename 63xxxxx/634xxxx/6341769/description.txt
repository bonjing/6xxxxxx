Few ageing comedians have managed to maintain the enduring relevance of foul-mouthed curmudgeon George Carlin, and now the man who once fearlessly broke the obscenity barrier by uttering the seven dirty words that weren't permitted on broadcast takes the stage for his thirteenth HBO stand-up special. In addition to highlighting the manner in which obsessions with shopping and eating are gradually eroding the American lifestyle, Carlin also offers keen insight into the absurdity of reality television, and observations on just what it might take for the planet to be restored to its original, pristine condition.
