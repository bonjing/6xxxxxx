                The brand new comedy set in the hotbed of academic
                mediocrity that is Kirke University continues.
                Philandering English Professor, Matt Beer, is on a
                mission to woo icy business consultant George into
                knee-trembling, resolve-weakening, book-cooking
                submission. Flatpack embarks on a little wooing of
                his own, and even accountant Jason is feeling a
                certain 'stirring' around gay best friend Nicole.
