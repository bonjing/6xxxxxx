,amishbuggy116,2011-05-01T00:32Z,I just had to comment on your awesomeness. You really help alot of people out who otherwise could not afford these programs and with the job market these days any advantage helps.
,nickeltable2011,2011-05-01T05:56Z,It seems like there is a missing set of serial numbers. When I go to type them in there is still 1 more box that is empty.
,nickeltable2011,2011-05-01T05:57Z,So I have installed it and it works fine using the trial version. However the serial numbers do not seem to work there is a missing set of numbers. When I type them in there is still 1 box that is empty.
,viragored,2011-05-01T06:01Z,This all worked perfectly for me.  Everything a rookie needs to know is there.  Now I need to learn how to use the program :-)
,LeFunMale,2011-05-02T02:57Z,"Hey thethingy,

I downloaded version 3.3 from your torrent, and two days ago the update said there's an updated version (3.4). 

Is it okay to use the update?

will I have to do all the other stuffs (replacing, copy and paste into folder, etc...) like when I was installing it for the first time?"
,falonlanders,2011-05-02T08:14Z,where are the serial numbers? D:
[V],thethingy,2011-05-02T16:38Z,"LeFunMale , if you have 3.3 installed already then just install this over the top.

Hello, I have downloaded this along with your other two downloads, which are great thank you. I am just trying to find the serial numbers. I have looked in the read me file and it sends me to a place I view on Firefox and I have tried to look through out the whole thing and still can not find the numbers. I am not completely savvy with computer, please help? :)"
,janna8488,2011-08-06T20:01Z,"Nevermind. I forgot to download both the set-ups, it made another ""read me"" file pop up, to give me the serial, thank you so much for the uploads! :)"

When i started to create a catalog, the app crash down..Now i'd uninstall the version 3.3, and install the 3.4. Now when i try to open LR 3.4, it continues in my last activity in version 3.3. Which was the time i tried to make a new catalog in version 3.3.

As i remember, when i installed the version 3.3, my pc was connected to the internet..."
,ronjack5,2011-08-16T23:58Z,Thanks thethingy!!!
,bridog80,2011-08-30T06:08Z,To all those with plugin errors: You shouldn't be trying to use online plugins like upload to flikr/facebook. Obviously the software is connecting to an Adobe server and being detected as pirated. Get a good firewall to block that. And do a clean install.
,vinhs,2011-09-04T18:34Z,works fantastically! upgraded from 3.3
,Torrettooo,2011-09-12T07:21Z,"i didn't get the insructions about the hosts file. i was lost at the instruction number 7. that far the insructions got me change ""hosts"" to ""hostsbackup"". (so i don't have any file named ""hosts"" at that point.) but number 7 asks me to copy ""hosts"" to etc folder. 1. i don't have any folder named ""hosts"" anymore. 2. i'm already working in ""etc"" folder."
,noodahs,2011-09-16T21:53Z,"hey, thethingy
thanks for the upload! but i have a problem installing it. I followed step one completely but when i tried to enter the serial, the program will say that the serial is not for this product. I have followed the video and i have checked that my hosts file did not change after restarting my pc.
Please help!"

I am 'middle of the road' when it comes to computers and if I am able to install it, then I would think the vast majority of those on PB should be able to as well.  "
