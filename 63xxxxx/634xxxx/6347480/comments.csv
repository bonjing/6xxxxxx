,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-04-28T08:43Z,"@ badboy2010, we don't go to the cinemas, because we don't like to hear your boyfriends knob polishing slurping sounds while watching a film. Thats why no one downloads your cams, cause the slurping sound makes the audio sound crap on your recording."
,McNekki,2011-04-28T09:00Z,went cinema last night ans watched this greatest one in series except for the first of course if what everyone saying about the screen not gonna bother but stop having a go with all the childish nonsense ur getting a free movie thats a cammed version they are never that great anyways

Also Many Thanks to TvTeam for this upload
Clean, watchable and I can assure you it's virus free, my Zonealarm found nothing"
,marshal_law,2011-04-28T12:43Z,"yip the right 3rd of the screen missing like the other copies but worth the early peek maybe the camera man should have another shot instead of everybody playing pass the passel.

thanks but credit to the camera man. "
,keybladekyle,2011-04-28T13:30Z,"THIS IS NOT A TS;

as the title of this torrent would have you believe, it is in fact a CAM, and a pretty poorly done CAM as well. 

However, this is the only copy of this movie out right now, so if you desperately have to watch it then this copy will do."
,immortal2312,2011-04-28T14:27Z,"@keybladekyle
you clearly have no idea what a TS is.
please find out before you post stupid comments like that one again.
www.google.com should be able to tell you what a TS is, you imbecile.
Thankyou."
,GaMeR_3,2011-04-28T14:42Z,If this was true they must add image...
,spartaqus,2011-04-28T15:02Z,useless shitty cam..
,keybladekyle,2011-04-28T17:31Z,"@immortal2312:

Just lol.

The quality of this movie is worse than most cams i've seen and certainly not worthy of calling itself a Telesync, as im sure your already aware the difference between these two bootlegging methods extends beyond simple recording methods and depends more on the quality of the audio/video itself. 

I felt that the audio in this movie was not of Telesync quality, and that this movie should have been listed as a cam, regardless of the recording method.

Thank you TvTeam for uploading this, i watched and enjoyed all 75% of the screen i could see, and it was certainly worth the $0.00 i paid for it,

A: 4-5
V: 3
