"The Ten Commandments" was the final film in the five-decade career of
legendary producer and director Cecil B. DeMille, successfully combining high
production values and epic scope for a box-office blockbuster. Expanded from
one of the segments in DeMille's 1923 silent film of the same name, it benefits
greatly from Charlton Heston's star-making performance as Moses, and from a
veteran supporting cast that includes Yul Brynner, Anne Baxter, Edward G.
Robinson and Vincent Price. The production design has an appropriate sense of
grandeur and the parting of the Red Sea is among the most famous scenes in any
film from the 1950s. DeMille's directing style is straightforward, maintaining
a clean, brisk pace throughout the film's 232 minutes. The Ten Commandments was
nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning for John
Fulton's special effects.
