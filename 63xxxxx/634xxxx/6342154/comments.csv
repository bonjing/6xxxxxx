,azureusism,2011-04-25T14:51Z,Worst HD I have ever seen - save the bandwidth and don't bother people.
,kukki2,2011-04-25T15:41Z,"It's about the source. AMCHD is crap. Same case what happened with episode 1-2 release by CTU which was propered by ORENJI.

Wait for proper rip from different source."
,dfuse,2011-04-26T07:26Z,Awesome series! thanks
,wck,2011-04-26T21:12Z,"google ""killing s01e05 720p web-dl"" and you'll find a proper version."
,gmjh,2011-07-17T10:28Z,Thanks wck. Couldn't find another source. I downloaded ep 1-4 from this source and they're terrible quality (especially the sound) Though I think amc may be to be blame for some of the bad quality.
