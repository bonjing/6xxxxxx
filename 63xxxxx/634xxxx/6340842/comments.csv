,jmac85,2011-04-25T18:29Z,"Long live the bunny! Anyway, thank you for this encode. Quality is superb, as always...especially given the year this was made."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-25T19:11Z,"@dude: I asked you to stop doing that. You have spammed and practically diverted many many people of my Classic-movies uploads (Tiffany, Catch a Thief) - by giving unfair, unjustified ratings - in scale which parameters are known only to - yourself.

For example: This Bugs Bunny is from 1946. Do you have any idea what that mean?
Mono sound, video production below modern standards for sure. It was fucking SIXTY FIVE years ago, silly.

What is the quality of original?
To what you compared it to?
Best encode EVER? Don't be ridiculous.

What is your playback system?Is it good? Better than mine? Good as any system that any potential downloader have?

You see - I (and we) know shit about you.

Who to fuck you are? Even if you say that, or answer to any of these questions - should we believe in what you say?

Please, stop it!

I asked you same three times already. And you MUST realize that any civilized man should stop doing what seems as perfectly fine to him only - until someone ask him to stop.

As I did."

Thank you for these priceless classics,especially singles like this one.I add them to preview films I burn to disc.I help at a mens halfway house,entertainment is my specialty with scads of pirated cinema.The kids love these old cartoons prior to a movie.Many compliments,I tell'em that what you got when we went to the show.Cartoons first,not 5 movie previews and theater horseshit.Twenty/Forty's encodes are perfect,every one I have so far.Thanks for making me look like I know what I'm doing-Old dawg"

,highres99,2011-04-28T16:16Z,"Salaam, @20-40: is there any way i can assist with the broken router issue, if yes, please let me know. its rather unfortunate that upon all that you've been doing, we can't see the decency in been there for you when you need help. may God continue to assist you as you've been assisting others."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-28T17:10Z,"Thank you.

 @to all who can and want to help:

 If you want to help me buy a new router and get back up to speed on ALL the show you love then please consider donating some cash to the cause as I CANNOT afford to buy it myself. My long term fans know how much I have to live on and it is simply impossible for me to purchase a new router without help from fans/friends. I am tied into buying it from my ISP - a replacement of any kind will not work as my ISP has a handshake built-in to the router and will cut me off completely if I don't use their router. I ask all my fans/friends to please help me raise this cash. I have no idea how long my old router (originally provided by my ISP) will continue to work so time is critical here. Please e-mail me at twentyforty1@gmail.com and help me come up with the cash to get back to full upping strength. For those who are willing to help with cash, my thanks in advance. "
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-28T17:53Z,"LOL, 11 minutes apart, TPB show comments with great delay, for last two months, sometimes is even 45 minutes long... Therefore.
I know, my answers sometimes look as wrongly timed or order of questions-answers is completely screwed - but I can only say Sorry for that. It looks like trolls and spammers eat too much bandwidth."

@MODERATORS
is there a rule in your policies that allow haters to write the kind of things killeurkilleur is writing about twentyforty. If you voted 20-40 to become a VIP, i suppose his work and posts are VIP too so why do you tolerate such haters? I think killeurkilleur is attacking the whole integrity of TPB while your permitting such acts. Please, do something about it...thanks..."
