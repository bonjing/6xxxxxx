,bayourick,2011-07-07T04:49Z,does anyone have a serial number  for lens effects 1.0
,schtickboy,2011-08-06T03:56Z,Some of the serials don't seem to work. Cutting and pasting the serial on some looks like the hyphens don't line up and the serial doesn't work. I know TOPAZ adjust doesn't work.
,schtickboy,2011-08-06T04:17Z,In fact Like %70 of the stuff the serials don't work. Any one out there with serials and usernames that work for this puppy?
,easyview,2011-08-21T23:11Z,"Thank you, everything worked perfectly.
Loaded serial by hand (not copy and paste) and all of them worked.
Lens effects is not included in this bundle."
