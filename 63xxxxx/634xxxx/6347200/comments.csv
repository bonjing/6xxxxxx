,fide9,2011-04-27T20:22Z,"Hey man, thanks once again, for another torrent, and I totally support this shift into the movie thing I think it makes you a lot more versatile, and that's always a good thing, I'm donwloading it now and will get back to you for some feedback, but in the mean time, I have one question, are you portuguese mate?"
[V],globeplus,2011-04-28T00:27Z,"To fide9 : beside if i am or not portuguese this movie is located in Rio de Janeiro and somehow the subtitles maked sense even in a informal nice way , my spirit on my work is like a citizen from everywhere independent of the location that i have , what i mean is that trying to do always the best correct possible work under the circunstances and with that my work it is for everyone , sometimes i upload in russian too , nice new movies that only have the audio in russian at the moment of the upload but people donĂÂ´t mind to at least get the feeling about the picture , downloading late the english version or simply applying correctly subtitles and that can be for many languages with a subtitles program , what i mean is that if i feel that my work is correct and can be useful or interest the possible users that certainly can be positive .

Cheers and happy movie to you ."

Download to see the quality and later download the english version. By the way the movie was good actually. I mean not the best quality i have ever seen but obviously like you said under certain circumstances It is actually a pretty good movie"
