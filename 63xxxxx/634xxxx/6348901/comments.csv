,haznii,2011-08-23T11:09Z,"this song makes me want to strip naked, burstï»¿ out of my room window, free fall 21 floors, land in the snow, make a snowï»¿ angel, shiver from the cold, get hypothermia, DIE!, go the pearly gate, say whats up to Saint Peter, do our secret hand shake, look in the directory for Siddhartha (Buddha), find Him, have Him reincarnate me into a frog, meet a princess, kiss her, turn into a prince,ï»¿ order myï»¿ subjects to bring me a computer, listen to this song again, and cry myselfï»¿ to sleep"
