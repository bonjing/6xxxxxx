                           DESCRiPTiON 

 The rapper trains to become a street magician and receives expert advice from 
 magician Nigel Mead. He has three weeks to learn the tricks of the trade      
 before he must put on a show in front of hundreds of people - ending with an  
 escape from a straitjacket suspended 50ft up. To help him overcome his        
 inhibitions, he also tries his hand at stand-up comedy as an opening act for  
 Andi Osho                                                                     
                                 Enjoy!
