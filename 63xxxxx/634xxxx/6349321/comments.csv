,MarkoOhNo,2011-05-29T19:03Z,Ugh. Horrible copy. Video keeps flipping out & gets out of sync with the audio - falling farther & farther behind with each occurrence. Sometimes causes whichever player I try to shut itself down. Something is very warped about this file. I'm deleting my copy & trying the other upload of this movie.
