Charlie Sheen - DC - Violent Torpedo of Truth - 2011.04.19

This might be the best compilation day due to good audio and video (nix the opening which the bass overloads the mic on the cam (not like we havent seen the RPG clip tho)    Most of the capture is from closer people, a few clips from the nosebleeds to tie it together as best possible.  The ending clips I didnt know where to place, crowd reaction during most of the show didnt fit with the overwhelming boos of those clips, so I didnt know where to place it, but I didnt want to cut it out either... so its at the end, an end i cant find to confirm or deny thats how it went...
