,xiIix,2011-07-07T18:03Z,"Nice! Did you know that you can get that crown plaza demo off steam and just copy and paste that info into your full game and it'll work? It worked for me. 

I also have all of the Race games integrated into 1. Like, every single game since Race and WTCC, all merged into 1. It was tricky, but I got it working. So I now have Race07, STCC, STCC2, GTR Evolution, Race ON, all of the addon packs etc etc... all from one menu. It's so awesome. Maybe I'll upload my  it here one day. It's fucking huge though."
