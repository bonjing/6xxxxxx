,nox150690,2011-04-26T20:42Z,"anyone with any problems with the MFD'S or Control Surfaces, please visit this link http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6346466
for my hotfix."
,The_Pharoah,2011-04-27T11:48Z,does this crack work with Win7 64 bit? I know the MD11 cracked ver would work with Win7 32 bit but would cause problems with 64 bit.
,nox150690,2011-04-27T13:38Z,"I am unsure as if to it will work. I currently running WIN7 32-bit, and it works fine. All I can suggest is try it out. Also if you do run into any errors, use the hotfix above."
,The_Pharoah,2011-04-28T11:06Z,"yeah thanks.

guys beware...the MD11 cracked version I had previously ONLY worked on 32bit - when installing on 64 bit it deleted my scenery folder and totally fucked up FSX....beware or even better...BUY IT! :)"
,aarque,2011-04-29T03:01Z,"Ya, I don't know, I got em both working fine a long time ago, so far as I know. I even have the 747-8i/737-8F extension along side the standard PMDG 747, all I had to do was copy the base elsewhere, run the 8i/8F swap, or whatever they call it, then copy the 747 base folder back into FSX>Airplanes.

But thanks for the cool one stop crack and here's to hopes for many more excellent uploads nox."
,nox150690,2011-04-29T08:25Z,Glad your enjoying the plane. The reason I made and uploaded this was because the plane can be frustrating to install and crack. Hopefully with this easier version there will be a lot less headaches.
,aarque,2011-04-30T03:34Z,"So, if you crack installs, I have the FSD Cirrus Vision installer (http://www.fsd-international.com/Hangar/Vision/index.htm). It authenticates to the online server and I don't have an account. If you or anyone is interested I will torrent it. I can't promise I will check this torrent for a reply, but I am always checking new stuff..."

,aimad,2011-05-01T15:41Z,hey nox150690 i've installed over 14 liveries of md11 do i have to remove them while installing this package. thanx im downloading it
,beedeejee,2011-05-14T18:28Z,"Hi, the crack works fine. My problem is that the knob for the navigation dsisplay (APP, MAP, PLN) does not work, it stays on APP. The same for the BARO/HPA knob. What could be wrong here?"
,beedeejee,2011-05-14T18:49Z,And that starts after half a minute with red lines on the PFD.
,nox150690,2011-05-16T23:50Z,"Hi beedeejee, this is a known error, please see the fix located here, http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6346466 (created by me) to fix this problem. 

This problem also can exist with the real retail version, but no one on the forums has come up with an official fix. this is (as far as I am aware) the only fix for it."
,fsmas,2011-05-24T03:35Z,yo bitches! you all need to fucking seed
,babyfabiola,2011-06-04T14:53Z,"This crack will work under windows 7 64x
No other torrent can clean up the black screens.
Now i fly over more than a 100 hours without a black screen or any other stuck instrument. "
,aimad,2011-06-06T18:39Z,hey nox man u rock my world man ur package is really working without any problem. but everyone this is very impor. that u install all the liveries or update before the crack or else it destroy the whole FSX textures and scenery. and starting it will give an error i.e A FATAL ERROR OCCURED. ur really good
,aimad,2011-06-08T16:39Z,hey can anyone help me on how to load the flight plan directly from game rather than using FMC
,nox150690,2011-06-25T12:07Z,"This torrent includes all of the official skins from PMDG. The reason I wrote about installing liveries is in case you have any custom liveries, which is unlikely. If you don't have any skins you have made yourself, just follow the instructions. Also please remember to apply the crack fix if you are experiencing problems.

You have to copy the Simobjects folder included with the crack, as this activates the crack. Just copy it into the FSX folder."
,pesslon,2011-07-04T00:53Z,"hi nox, many thx for your effort but this still doesent work for me:( when i dont apply the crack fix the pfd and mfd dont display correct data with those red lines. and when i apply the crack fix, the displays go dark after a short while. obviously im doing something wrong (as your crack seems to work for everyone), even though i follow the readme steps. im particulary interested in what should i do with that weird lolzzz folder and its content. should i leave it as it is or copy & overwrite into my FSX folder? in readme it says to put simobjects into FSX folder, but there are 2 simobjects - the first in the torrent and the second in the lolzzz folder, so i got a little confused. or should i select the FSX folder as installation folder and let it overwrite everything during installation? btw im running win7 64bit and the md-11 doesnt work, but fuck it, i want 744 rather than md11 :-/ any help will be greatly appreciated"
,bop239,2011-07-05T05:00Z,"I'm win7-64bit user , Installation is possible but will be executed when the altimeter problem with the flap."
,bop239,2011-07-05T05:08Z,"nox150690 , thank you , but i don't know why this can't work my computer , when i use it , will have something problem is about after 5sec , altimeter always -7000 and can't change, and flap always at 30.  it show you stays on 30."
,aimad,2011-07-14T15:36Z,"hi nox. since ive installed your pack there were no problems. but now im facing some problems with MD-11 only is that when I run it after its initialization. the commands i give to it. it dont accepts. like when i open cabin lights, no lights , and when i minimize the game for some reason and when returns the aircraft is fully unresponsive. and its not showing the engine views wing views. in the cockpit all the views are gone only OVHD, 2Dpanel, and VIRTUAL cockpit can be viewd. PLEASE I REALLY NEED HELP ON THIS. with best regards."
,nox150690,2011-07-29T20:58Z,"Please remember that there is a patch for this cracked version, find it under my piratebay username"
,BAARERBIER,2011-08-04T16:39Z,"I have a problem. I had bothe the PMDG 747 and MD11 working fine. however one day they suddenly started to have black screens. So i reinstalled and still black screens.

,geromino,2012-02-03T01:09Z,"Hey folks! I got a little problem! What do I have to type in when the installer ask me for email,registration and all?"
