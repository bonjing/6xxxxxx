Description......: Experience Japan's earthquake and tsunami through new footage and first person accounts. Understand the mega-physics 
		   inside this latest Ring of Fire cataclysm that rocked the Earth on its axis. Scientists explore whether the Pacific 
		   NW U.S. could be next.

Release Notes....: The footage from the earthquake and tsunami that we've all seen 100 times already is NTSC video but the new footage,
		   interviews, and CG are PAL. It's a pretty even split between the two but since the old footage is crappy quality
		   anyway, this release is ivtc'd for the new stuff.
