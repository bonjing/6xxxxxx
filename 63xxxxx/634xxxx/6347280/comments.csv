,NanoMan_777,2011-04-28T20:32Z,"I am looking for whatever it will take to either convert a file or record using a client to MAKE my own MODELS to be used in vghd.
I am thinking something that converts anything to what I need will be the best way to go.
Anyone have a clue that might point me in the right direction?"

,falvebarm,2011-05-03T09:03Z,"Yes, this seems to work well, although I've only burned AVI's to DVD's so far.  Thanks, Blaze69!

As a reminder, if you use this software a lot, you should consider purchasing it.  No profits = software companies go out of business = no more decent software."

,fredfan,2011-05-29T19:00Z,"Thanks for the effort.  All went as described.  Still it was a pointless effort for me since this version of the program STILL can't convert an MKV with great surround sound into any other format without downgrading to stereo, and at a lower bitrate as well."

,fieldof,2011-12-12T07:38Z,"@FingMuppet
There is no hypocricy in my urging others to pay for software which I myself have acquired through the use of a crack.  Read my comment again:  I said people should consider buying the software IF THEY USE IT A LOT.  I plan to use it very infrequently and do not want to cough up $70 just to access all the features."
