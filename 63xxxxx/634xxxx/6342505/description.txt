These are the compilation of all 5 Special Reports of this series so far.  Wikipedia listed these as Air Crash Investigation Season 6 for the first 3 episodes and Season 8 for the second two episodes.

This is just a compilation from the following:

I also included the HD 720p version of epi 5 Cruel Skies/Deadly Storms.


Hopefully this will help with people getting these easier and keep the seed alive as it seems people more likely to keep compilation seed alive a lot longer.

Please keep it seeded.  Thanks....
