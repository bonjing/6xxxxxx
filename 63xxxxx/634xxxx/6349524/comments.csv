It's amazing, after 17 years from the creation of the animation, and after 14 years from the first musical, the Lion King has the first place in the heart of many people, especially on those born in the 90's. And it's music, lives inside us! Thank's for the upload, i'm in Greece, and i never had the chance to watch the musical live, or listen to this version of the songs"

,vassilis1924,2011-04-29T13:00Z,"Thank's for replying! Yeah i think these versions are better, too :) except, the circle of life. If you like, i suggest you, to listen to the Greek version of the songs. I think you will like the voices better than the English version. Especially in ""Can you feel the love tonight"". Try it and tell me what you think :)"
