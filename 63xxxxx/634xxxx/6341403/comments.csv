,tHeJunKiE,2011-09-02T01:10Z,"@vrgadin - Same problem here. Plus, it says AFRYKA. And when I managed to start a game, the graphics were very glitchy. 

My configuration:
Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit
4GB DDR2 RAM
AMD Athlon II X2 2.8GHz
ATI Radeon HD 3870 512MB GDDR4 RAM

I will be very grateful, if you, or anyone else share the solution to this problem.

Thank you in advance."
