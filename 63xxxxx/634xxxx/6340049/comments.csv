,Aykaziel,2011-05-18T20:51Z,How do I go about installing this program? and is it compatible with Vista 64 bit?
,Aykaziel,2011-05-18T20:52Z,How do I install this program? I can't find the instruction doc.
,salsanight,2011-05-24T08:58Z,"Thank you very much for this torrent!! It works perfectly. I was looking for this software and I can't believe I have got it now!!!
Ok, I can give a tip how to install. The programme is compatible with Win7, Vista, XP 32 and 64bit.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Open the folder and extract files from [cvsx4pro.rar] file to any other folder (don't extract to the same folder otherwise you will damage the torrent file and won't be able to seed; or first make a copy of the downloaded folder and work within that copied folder). For extracting files you need a compression software like WinRar, 7-Zip, etc.
2. After you have extracted files you will see a folder [cvsx4pro] and a file [cvsx4pro.iso] in it. For opening and burning this file to the disk use softwares like PowerISO, MagicISO, IsoBuster, DAEMON Tools, etc. Burn ISO file to the DVD.
3. Open files from DVD and you will see a folder [CRACK]. Open the folder and run [KEYGEN.EXE]. From Menu ""Program:"" choose ""Corel VideoStudio Pro X4v14.0"" and you will see a serial number under the word ""Serial:"". Copy this number. Click on [AUTORUN.EXE], an installation will start, the  window ""Serial number"" will appear under the window ""Name"" later, paste the serial number you have copied.

*some free software you can find on http://www.filehippo.com/ in categories ""Compression and Backup Downloads"" and ""CD and DVD Tools Downloads"".  

I hope it helps."

be sure that your anti-virus,anti-spyware,anti-malware does not block the crack as well...
Sometimes,it's better to extract it on your desktop and to use it as admin mod

,javid7,2011-07-10T16:17Z,"I already have an corel VSPX4 Trial.I download this torrent and i extract it, i get an .iso file and i mount it,while i run the autorun and select ""install VideoStudio Pro X4"" it told ""Are You Sure Want To Remove Corel VideoStudio Pro X4 and all its Feature? i click remove, when it comes to 66% it told ""Installaion Wizard not completed
Your system has not been modified.to complete installation at another time,please run setup again.click FINISH to exit the wizard.
This action is only valid for products that are currently installed"" Please Give Me A SOLUTION.."
,bruno212,2011-07-16T12:46Z,"Funny, it didn't ask me for any installation code to enter. All i did was enter the serial, and it worked fine already."
,bruno212,2011-07-16T12:51Z,"Oh my bad, it did ask me to enter ""Confirmation Code"" when you click the register button, but the crack never had any confirmation code in it, just serial. So i entered the serial, and it worked fine."

,Lucy135,2011-08-10T19:39Z,"hi, when i click 'autorun' the sort of menu screen comes up, so i click 'install videostudio pro x4'. then another window comes up basically saying it's booting the installation wizard, but that then changes to a black window that doesn't appear to be installing anything...
i was just wondering if this happened to anyone else? and if i'm doing something wrong?

thanks"

,Sur3,2011-08-17T14:28Z,"Thank You Very Much! I was still using good old Corel VideoStudio 12, but I decided it was time for a new version. And I have to say after using pro x4 for a couple of days; ITS AWESOME!  "
,maxdgentle,2011-08-20T05:04Z,"This WORKS very well.  My only concern is that the language it gives me is in Chinese, i think because im in East Asia, and my Windows 7 is bought here, anyone have idea how i can install this and have English language?"
,albertd25,2011-08-20T23:05Z,Compared to other similar softwares like proshow producer pinnacle studio15 how could u rate this software. Does he at least can do a nice photo slideshow? Seems a little light to me in size and price.
,maxdgentle,2011-08-21T15:09Z,"i havnt gotten to all the capabilities, but the multi layer capability and u can resize the video clips on the other layers, for me as a ordinary video production editor gives immense power.  Im still trying to learn if i can make transparent the back ground so i can shoot in a blue or green screen.  that would be awesome if it can."
,ronrufin,2011-09-05T07:14Z,"When installing, a message from windows says, ""the logo did not pass ...bla bla bla.. it doesnt continue. please help me!"

,aafz02,2012-03-06T18:02Z,"I have been installing Corel Products since CorelDRAW! v2 when all work was done in wireframe mode and it was necessary to hit F9 to view the work in colour. I have used every version since then all but v5 being Pirate copies. I also used Ulead Video Studio from very early on v3 I think so again I have experience.

This version is fine, the program and the keygen are both clean but the keygen WILL alert some anti-malware to false positives. If you are concerned just run it ib a sandbox.

So to the registration procedure.. It does not work. The serial activates the program but ""phone Corel"" does nothing but wait for a code from them, which you must then input in order to generate the Activation code. Without this the program will work but you will be required to put up with a ""Please register"" once every 30 days.

Many thanks for the upload."
