Computer Power User is a monthly print publication aimed at people who breathe, eat, and sleep technology. The kind of person who gets his kicks upgrading graphics cards and smashing benchmarks. The type of person who re installs Windows at 2 a.m. because his system keeps crashing while he's encoding video.
