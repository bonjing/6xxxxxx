Why theatrical version?
The unrated version takes its own time before unleashing the terror, and that's not necessarily a good thing.

The theatrical cut is 33 minutes longer than the 1941 original and in that sense only adds 33 minutes of unnecessary exposition, or even worse, unnecessary action and gore taking away from the human element of the story.
