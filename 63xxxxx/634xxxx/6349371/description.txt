Imagine a safe, natural high inducing pleasurable feelings and emotions that in turn eliminates depression and pain. Astral Sounds professes to do just that.

Mark Beshara and a team of physcologists analyzed the behavoir of the brain when experiencing euphoric feelings. They then recreated this behavior by duplicating the sound waves that trigger automatic Astral Projection. The computer created tones and pitches immediately relax the listener, stimulating the pleasure center of the brain, and can cause safe, pleasurable visions. This recording contains sound waves and sound frequencies that have been arranged in a specific pattern to have profound positive psychological effects on the mind and body of the listener.

This remarkable CD has been used in hospitals as an alternative to tranquilizers and pain medications. It has also been used to cure sleep problems and promote rapid healing. Overall, Astral Sounds are worth experiencing for the science that led to their creation and the positivity they promise.
