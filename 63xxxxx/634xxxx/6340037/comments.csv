,brinelol,2011-07-03T22:52Z,"Ok first of all, OctgnwLobby is not even the official OCTGN game client, and it's not even supported anymore so users downloading this will be thoroughly disappointed in the waste of 1.53 GB.

please properly support the OCTGN MTG community by NOT using Torrents to download the MTG files.  We have many new users entering our community frustrated and unable to get OCTGN to work, because they obtain outdated and incorrect files from these torrents.  The MTG files are updated much too often for torrent seeding to ever be effective.  You are NOT doing the community a favor by uploading them onto torrent portal sites, in fact you're adding to the headache.

http://octgn.gamersjudgement.com (and http://octgnsets.freeforums.org, but it is shutting down soon) are the ONLY official places to obtain the OCTGN MTG files.  

If you ignore my warnings and continue to download/upload the files using torrents then WE WILL NO LONGER HELP YOU.  We are getting sick and tired of the users coming to our chatroom asking for help because their torrented files do not work."
