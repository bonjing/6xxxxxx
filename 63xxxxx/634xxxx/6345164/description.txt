40 Wii Games in WBFS (English){NTSC-U}[namster] REPACK
------------------------------------------------------

REPACK Notes

- This addresses the "stuck at 99.9%" error in the original torrent.
- If you were downloading from the original torrent, then prior to downloading this torrent, please move your "wbfs" folder into a new folder called "40 Wii Games in WBFS (English){NTSC-U}[namster]" and resume your download from there.
- If this is a fresh download then don't worry about anything. ;)

------------------------------------------------------

This is a collection of my English Wii games in WBFS format (NTSC-U), with the exception of 1 PAL game (Just Dance [SDNP41]). There are 40 games in total.

These files can be run directly from a USB HDD formatted for FAT32 or NTFS. Some files larger than 4GB have been split so they can run on FAT32. A split file has the extension WBF1.

Please help seed this as the file is quite huge. I'll be seeding directly from my Wii's USB HDD any time it's not connected to my Wii. I ask that you do the same. :)

Also look for my "40 Wii Games in WBFS (Japanese){NTSC-J}[namster]" torrent with my collection of Japanese games!

Enjoy!
