,hakuna_matata,2011-05-11T12:39Z,"One of the greatest torrent available. 
Its always better to gert them in .wbfs straight away and avoid downloading 4gb torrents. Thanks a lot."
,Namster,2011-05-11T14:31Z,You're welcome.  I know what you mean.  It's a pain to download 4.38GB files where you then have to unrar and then convert the ISO to WBFS to extract games that are sometimes just a few hundred MBs. >.
,devilrich,2011-05-21T23:34Z,"How do i add these games to my hdd? wbfs manager will not accept these files!

And i cant drag them into my disk either since its wbfs formatted."
,hakuna_matata,2011-05-22T23:50Z,"I use ""WiiBackupManager"", to transfer the files to HDD, It transfers files straight away, if you have .iso file then it converts the file on the fly and daves the hdd space by compressing it in WBFS, basically wbfs file doesnt contain empty data that is there on iso image. also WiiBackupManager will help you get the covers.
On the Wii .. I have Wii-Flow installed, I think thats what most people are using now."
,Namster,2011-05-23T11:15Z,"@devilrich: Wii Game Manager can read and convert ISO files, WBFS files, and WBFS formatted HDDs.

In my opinion, WBFS formatted drives are a thing of the past.  Now you can have games in WBFS formatted files (the contents of this torrent) and run them off of FAT32 and NTFS drives.  A WBFS formatted file uses the same amount of disk space as the same game on a WBFS formatted HDD.

The advantage of a FAT32 or NTFS HDD is you can save anything on it (including movies).  A WBFS formatted HDD restricts you to only Wii games and nothing else.

As for a USB loader, I'm running Configurable USB Loader."

im averaging about 15kB/s!!!"
,MaxThebeast,2011-07-16T06:41Z,I can't get any sources please seed!
,MaxThebeast,2011-07-17T06:28Z,"15 ko/s average for 3 days now, should I give up hope?"
,BigCake,2011-07-18T18:52Z,Makes me sad it has 11 seeders and over 290 leechers :c
,steelllynx,2011-07-21T00:01Z,"Configurable USB Loader does not see any games.  I am trying this on a FreeAgent Go 320 GB NTFS.  It sees the partition and does not complain about loading it.  Just no games show up.  The same drive worked when I used WBFS Manager 3.0 to format a 30 GB partition on the drive as WBFS and extracted a couple ISOs (Super Mario Galaxy 2 and Metroid Other M).  Any help appreciated, thanks."
,MaxThebeast,2011-07-25T05:14Z,steelllynx have you tried Wiiflow? I use it to play WBFS games from my 1To NTFS HDD and it works perfectly (and loading times are A LOT shorter then when playing form a DvD)
,Namster,2011-07-26T16:20Z,"@BigCake: Actually it's more like 100 seeders and 1200 leechers if you factor in all of the trackers, DHT, and Peer Exchange.  Make sure DHT, Local Peer Discovery, and Peer Exchange are working in your client.

@steelllynx: Make sure the games are placed in a folder called ""wbfs"" in your drive's root.  That's the only way FAT32 and NTFS drives can be read by USB loaders."
,gimble20,2011-08-01T11:59Z,"So, am I supposed to combine the split games? If so, how. Also, I am going to use WBM to convert to .iso if that changes anything."
,388,2011-08-16T03:24Z,"I would humbly request more seeds. I know it says 9 but I'm only at like 20-40kB/s here. After like four hours I'm at 0.1%.

Please seed, people!"
