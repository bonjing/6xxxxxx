When Love Speaks: Shakespeare's Love Sonnets - Read and Sung by Various Artists


When Love Speaks is a collection of Shakespearean love sonnets as read by famous actors, and songs inspired by Shakespeareâ€™s love sonnets.

It contains a 44 page book. [Actually, it doesn't, unfortunately, thanks towho nuked this file, and it took forever to find a copy -- albeit sans booklet - Ouzicat]


An unusual collaboration, When Love Speaks features interpretations of William Shakespeareâ€™s sonnets and excerpts from his plays by high-profile actors and musicians. It almost goes without saying that performers such as John Gielgud, Jonathan Pryce, Diana Rigg, Ralph and Joseph Fiennes, and Susannah York give accomplished readings of the Bardâ€™s work; the musical interludes, which range from the adult alternative pop of Annie Lennoxâ€™s â€œLive With Me and Be My Loveâ€ to Kebâ€™ Moâ€s bluesy â€œNo More Be Grieved at That Which Thou Hast Done,â€ arenâ€™t quite as successful but add diversity. Highlights include Alan Rickmanâ€™s reading of â€œMy Mistressâ€™ Eyes Are Nothing Like the Sun,â€ Rufus Wainwrightâ€™s â€œWhen, in Disgrace With Fortune and Menâ€™s Eyes,â€ and Bryan Ferryâ€™s â€œShall I Compare Thee to a Summerâ€™s Day.â€ Other featured performers include Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Barbara Bonney, Tom Courtenay, and Kenneth Branagh. As a benefit album for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts -- where most of the featured actors on this album studied -- and as a tribute to Shakespeare, When Love Speaks does an admirable job of marrying high culture to pop culture.

When Love Speaks Sonnets

Forty-Seven of Shakespeare's 154 Sonnets are read by some distinguished former alumni of RADA, making it the starriest cast ever assembled on disc, from Richard Attenborough and Kenneth Brannagh to Diana Rigg and Juliet Stevenson. And to hear such rich, wondrous language spoken with such dare and love is a treat indeed. Alan Rickman and Peter Barkworth are particularly outstanding and, while four sonnets are sung in eminently forgettable pop settings, the contrasting vocal timbres add to the pleasure of this unique recording.



INTERVIEW with MICHAEL KAMEN


'When Love Speaks' is something that's been with me four or five years. It started with me when I was 16. I started writing an opera on Othello and I wrote the Willow Song - and I'm very proud of it. Needless to say, Shakespeare is the inspiration for so much work that has gone on in the world for the last few 100 years. I decided that the sonnets were his most memorable love poems and I decided to write one - Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? I was looking for people to sing and I went to Brian Ferry expecting, without question, that he would take forever to make his mind up. But he heard it and, about two hours later, I walked out of his studio with a master.

I asked Annie Lennox if she'd give me something and she came back very excited, because she'd done a song based on one of the poems. And I also wanted Ladysmith Black Mambazo - when I called Des'ree, who also sings on the disc, she said "I'm working with Ladysmith". And I said "God, can you bring them?". Joseph Shabalala and I hit it off right away and I asked him if he would ever consider singing a Shakespeare sonnet. About a month later, he called from South Africa, saying "you know, I don't really like singing English very much". So I called a friend in LA who did a translation of a sonnet into Zulu and that's what Joseph worked on. As far as recruiting the actors on the disc, that's something I didn't have to do. One of my great friends I worked with on Die Hard and Robin Hood is Alan Rickman - he went ahead and recruited all the actors that we see on the album. It was also Alan who suggested we use the material for a benefit album for RADA.

The beauty of all great art is that it expands people's creativity and imagination. The Shakespeare sonnets are delightful - they're each a minute long, they're crafted by a genius and they are very meaningful - the emotions in them speak to us very clearly. When Love Speaks turned out to be a title that Alan Rickman came out with, but it's exactly what the album's about'.

A special live event took place on Sunday, February 10, 2002, at the Old Vic Theatre, to benefit RADA. RADA and EMI Classics launched this CD of Shakespeare's sonnets - both spoken and sung by a unique gathering of acting and musical talent including: Alan Rickman, Richard Attenborough, Fiona Shaw, Annie Lennox and David Stewart, Dave Gilmour, Des'Ree, Robert Lindsay, Tom Courtenay. Michael Kamen played piano.

Lord Attenborough (who is helming the rebuilding of RADA) and Alan Rickman were hosts of the event. While Lord Attenborough declared he was not a "luvvie", and Rickman confessed to a bit of a cold, the audience response and appreciation was enthusiastic. A Reuters article follows.


Shakespeare with Love as Bard Gets Music Makeover

-- Hannah Cowdy (Reuters)



Seventeenth-century drama met 21st century rock on Sunday when a galaxy of stars of stage, screen and song joined up for an early Valentine's celebration of the greatest love poet of them all -- Shakespeare.

From award-winning composer Michael Kamen to pop diva Annie Lennox, musicians set the Elizabethan bard's love songs, sonnets and soliloquies to music as veterans of the British stage performed his works to rapturous applause at London's packed Old Vic theatre.

Sunday's performance marked the release of "When Love Speaks," a CD collaboration between Britain's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) and record group EMI Classics, which hopes to introduce Shakespeare to a new audience almost four centuries after the death of the world's most famous playwright.

Organizers said the CD, which features dozens of celebrities from sibling Shakespearean actors Ralph and Joseph Fiennes to seventies rock star Bryan Ferry, was shooting up the album charts after last week's release -- proof of the bard's lasting appeal.

Actor Alan Rickman, who played the sinister Dark Arts teacher Professor Snape in "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone," worked with Kamen on the recording.

Proceeds will help struggling future stars of British stage and screen.

"Shakespeare is quintessential English," Rickman told reporters after the show.

"Shakespeare is simple and complex at the same time. It's the universal truth," he told Reuters.

Oscar-winning director Richard Attenborough described "When Love Speaks" as "a fascinating marriage of historical literature and contemporary song, which I assure you is the greatest labor of love."

The highlight of the evening was a reunion of pop band Eurythmics' stars Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart.

An elfin, delicate-looking Lennox, in a pale pink skirt and top with black boots, entranced the audience with a powerful rendition of "Live with me and be my love," taken from a poem by Shakespeare's contemporary, Christopher Marlowe.

Other stars performing on Sunday included British singer Des'ree, Shakespearean actor Richard Briers and Pink Floyd's David Gilmour.
