,minotaurgirl,2012-06-13T10:42Z,"I'm having a bit of trouble with it-when I try to place the flash.exe crack into the folder with the actual file, it says it cannot create a shortcut in that folder, would I like to place it on the desktop instead? I do not want to make a shortcut, I want to replace it, but I'm not sure how. Dragging it from the folder to there doesn't seem to work. Help please?"
