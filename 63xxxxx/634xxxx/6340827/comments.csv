,Dragonite_9,2011-04-29T19:42Z,Please go back to mp4! Thanks!
,lord_kushington,2011-05-09T06:26Z,"unfortunately guys mkv is the future, as it supports multiple audio streams and subtitles. if you just want an mp4 use a prog called yamb, just remove any streams you dont want and it will repackage the file into an mp4 for you in about 10 minutes. it will then work on ps3  "
,EddieG51,2011-05-14T08:31Z,"MKV a jurassic file??? please do a little research, as they say before this format is the future because of the features it gives and HD video quality"
,kepler42,2011-08-14T19:49Z,"MKV is by far more flexible, supports all video and audio formats, multiple audio, multiple Subtitles, chapters, etc.
Its also very easy to reconfigure (use lkV Toonix and mkvmerge GUI.

For th eguys stuck with mp4 , USE YAMB to extract the desired streams : need Stereo audio only ?? then good luck..."
