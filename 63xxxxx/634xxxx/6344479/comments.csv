,samscmnt,2011-06-30T06:27Z,"@frod7600
It's not so difficult. Just copy the amtlib.dll from DLL FILE\32bit\ and replace one you have in your program folder (eg. Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Dreamweaver CS5.5). That's it.
P.S. Hope you've changed your host file as instructed."

5) Copy the file 'amtlib.dll' into the install directory overwriting the exsisting file...
   (You will have to do this multiple times for each installed program in a suite)

every time i open dreamweaver it tells me that i used an invalid code and put in another the generator created and it works fine. but how can i make it so that i only have to use 1 code instead of having to put in a different code every single time i want to use dreamweaver?
pls get back to me anyone "

,adismas,2011-07-20T17:33Z,"I followed the instructions verbatim a la replacing the hosts file offline, flushing the DNS resolver cache, and replacing all instances of amtlib.dll in the trial install. This is pretty straightforward and I think a lot of people are probably familiar with this approach. I then booted up Wireshark to see if Dreamweaver would make any noise when starting and sure enough it still is able to contact Adobe and transmit some application data despite the measures provided. I used my firewall to block any remaining outbound connections not simply from the program itself but from my computer but it's still not entirely stopping it. I've seen it connect to 192.150.8.200, 192.150.16.60, 192.152.16.200, all Adobe. Not sure how to resolve this. Any suggestions?"
,bikerdaveb,2011-07-22T15:35Z,well probably going to make myself sound an idiot now but i have this installed on 32bit at moment but going to be changing to 64bit in next few days but i noticed there aint no dll file for 64 bit so how do i go about installing this on 64bit

,clsmoove,2012-01-14T18:30Z,"@delta47: DO NOT mix your bank details, occupation, adobe and pirated adobe software together. The hacks and torrents, especially by thethingy, work perfectly today, but you have no way of knowing how adobe will respond. If you work for a blue chip company, or one that has corporate clients, then get them to buy you a copy, don't risk your livelyhood.

I have an extensive number of blocks in place, in my host file and both firewalls, but if an adobe program needs to interact with adobe, like updating flash player, you can't be certain that adobe won't add an audit of their programs on your system as part of the update. 

The UK has similar laws to the US, and until our government grows a pair, and tells the US to fuck off, adobe can hack your system and take action against your employers. It's just not worth their time or expense, chasing individuals who only muck about with the programs at home. That's what the wankers in the US government do best."

I'm tempted to try out Adobe edge which is an official free preview available for download from Adobe. 

Question is: If i proceed with download & install will i put my adobe downloads from thethingy at risk of detection?"

,rachie10,2012-03-07T07:08Z,whats the serial# for this i cant find it.
,snowbirds,2012-03-09T04:44Z,"I followed the instructions, but they were bloody confusing, as you can see from all the posts.  The instructions say:

""Go to the DLL folder and copy the dll file and paste & replace the ones in the CS5.5 program directory""

The problem with this is that when you go to the DLL folder there are TWO folders in there, titled ""32bit"" and ""Original - 32bit"".  The uploader doesn't mention two folders.  So what the fuck? He says copy the DLL file, but there are TWO of those files, so which is it??  I tried both but neither worked.  I read a bunch of comments again and finally tried the first one again, and it worked for some reason.  Very confusing and annoying process.  Why, because the uploader has the English language skills of a 12 year old Slovakian boy.

Why go to the trouble of writing instructions, but write them like a fucking retard?  And then when dozens of people ask for help understanding your retard instructions, you ridicule them??  Sorry about your brain-stem hypoxia condition, dicktard.  Glad I figured out your confusing upload, but the only seed your going to get from me are the millions I shoot down you throat.
"
,snowbirds,2012-03-09T04:52Z,"and to make it more confusing he says grab the ONE file to replace the FILES in the DLL folder.  

So he's saying take ONE file and replace TWO+ files with it.

Singular ≠ Plural, dick-cheese.

The truth is you have to pick from TWO files to replace ONE with..."

,Damien74,2012-03-17T12:27Z,"I pulled the internet wire before installing and overwriting the dll-file.
Blocked DW in the firewall before starting it. But even the first time with no internet still it was in trial mode. 
Did it all by the book, as instructed in the nfo in other words. :/"
,Damien74,2012-03-17T12:31Z,"snowbirds youre not very smart are you? You should be very appreciative that this site even exists so be more respectful or never come back here with your comments like that.
The file that says original is ORIGINAL, to be used if you need to go back from the cracked one. That is why theres 2 files.
So to make even you understand. Use the file in the folder that does not have the word ""ORIGINAL"" in it. Ok? Good boy."
,lmack002,2012-03-21T02:51Z,"Guys, please i need help. I had originally downloaded this torrent but then it expired.
