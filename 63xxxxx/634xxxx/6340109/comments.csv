,12uel,2011-04-24T07:14Z,Many thanks to all of your great uploads. I stopped renting from redbox because of you and I see that as a good thing....Keep 'em coming!
[V],HolyRoses,2011-04-26T01:31Z,I don't see it as a good thing.  Every time you don't buy from red box you better do something nice for someone else.
