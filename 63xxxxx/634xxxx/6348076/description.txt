The Bourne Ultimatum is a 2007 American spy film directed by Paul Greengrass and loosely based on the Robert Ludlum novel of the same name. This film is the third in the Bourne film series, being preceded by The Bourne Identity (2002) and The Bourne Supremacy (2004)..

Trama

Jason Bourne, l'ex agente segreto che non ha nessun ricordo del suo passato, ha il bisogno, sempre piÃ¹ angosciante, di sapere chi e perchÃ© all'interno della CIA lo ha trasformato in una spietata ed inarrestabile macchina per uccidere, cancellandone l'identitÃ  e la memoria. Oltre a questo si aggiunge il desiderio di vendicare la morte di Marie, la giovane ragazza tedesca che Ã¨ rimasta coinvolta nella fuga di Bourne durante The Bourne Identity e che Ã¨ stata uccisa da un killer a Goa, in India, all'inizio di The Bourne Supremacy.

L'azione frenetica si sposta in rapida successione da Mosca a Parigi, da Torino a Londra, da Madrid â€“ dove ritrova ancora una volta Nicky Parsons â€“ a Tangeri, fino ad arrivare a New York, dove nell'adrenalinico epilogo l'ex agente segreto si ritrova faccia a faccia con l'uomo che ha presieduto al suo addestramento. Nello scontro finale con i molti nemici all'interno della CIA, Bourne viene creduto morto e dato per disperso, mettendo apparentemente fine alla sua storia.

Plot

Former CIA covert operative Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), eludes Moscow police and goes into hiding after being shot by Russian F.S.B. agent Kirill (in the previous film, The Bourne Supremacy). Six weeks later, Guardian correspondent Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) meets with a source to discuss Bourne and Operation Treadstone. The CIA begin tracking Ross when he mentions "Operation Blackbriar" on a cell phone call to his editor. Bourne travels to Paris to inform Marie's brother, Martin (Daniel BrÃ¼hl), of her death and assures him he's hunting her killers. In London, Bourne meets with Ross at Waterloo Station after learning of Ross' investigation of Treadstone. When Bourne realizes that the CIA is tracking Ross, he helps him evade capture, but Ross deviates from Bourne's instructions and is killed by Blackbriar "asset" (assassin) Paz (Ã‰dgar RamÃ­rez) on orders from Blackbriar's director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn).

CIA Director Ezra Kramer (Scott Glenn) sends Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), who unsuccessfully hunted Bourne six weeks earlier, to help Vosen after he spots Bourne in a CCTV camera feed. After searching Ross' notes, they deduce that his source was Neal Daniels (Colin Stinton), CIA Station Chief in Madrid, who was formerly involved in Treadstone and is actively involved in Blackbriar. Bourne, having taken Ross' bag after he was killed, is led to Daniels' Madrid office but finds it empty. Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), a former Treadstone support technician, arrives shortly after Bourne incapacitates the CIA field team sent by Vosen and Landy to capture him. She decides to help Bourne escape another incoming CIA squad and tells him Daniels fled to Tangiers. It's implied that Parsons and Bourne had a deep, possibly romantic relationship before he lost his memory.

Upon arriving in Tangiers, Parsons hacks into the CIA database to locate Daniels but fails, finding that Blackbriar asset Desh Bouksani (Joey Ansah) has been tasked with killing him. Vosen learns of Parsons' log in attempt and orders Desh to kill her as well as Bourne, a decision Landy disagrees with. Afterwards, Vosen calls Kramer and confirms their intentions to use Landy as the scapegoat if things go wrong. Bourne tails Desh to Daniels but fails to prevent Daniels' death by a roadside bomb. He does, however, protect Parsons by strangling Desh after an intense hand-to-hand fight and later sends her into hiding. Upon examining the contents of Daniels' charred briefcase, Bourne finds the address of the deep cover CIA bureau in New York City where Vosen directs Blackbriar.....
