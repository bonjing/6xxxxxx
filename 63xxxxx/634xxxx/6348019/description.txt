An old leper who owned a remote sorghum winery dies. Jiu'er, the wife bought by the leper, and her lover, take over the winery and set up an idealized quasi-matriarchal community headed by Jiu'er. When the Japanese invaders subject the area to their rule and cut down the sorghum to make way for a road, the community rises up and resists as the sorghum grows anew.

About the restoration:

Based on a 35mm Interpositive this film has been digitized and restored to HD-resolution on behalf of Kinowelt label Arthaus. The wide-screen Cinemascope (2,35:1) format has been captured to the maximum of the image, which causes every splice in the film to be a case of manual retouch. Prior to the scanning we performed a scene-by-scene color correction to perfectly represent the various skin tones and also underline the artful use of color accents that the director had in mind for the scenes. The restoration process reduced dust and scratch, blotches and stains, as well as numerous vertical lines that were printed in the material. With every step of the restoration process the beautiful film of famous director Yimou Zhang (â€žHeroâ€œ, â€žHouse of Flying Daggersâ€œ, â€žLeben!â€œ) became clearer and regained its original beauty. The resulting mastertape in HDCAM-SR will now be the source for the release as DVD and BluRay disk. It carries both, a restored german and the original mandarin sound track. - Alpha-Omega.
