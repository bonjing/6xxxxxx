U.S. folk-rock singer & songwriter Jake Holmes' second album, originally released in 1968 on the Tower label.A Letter To Katherine December is a record that many critics rate even more highly than his first. This is indeed a great follow-up; an album which easily evades the shadow of its predecessor' success and another recording that, in typical Holmes fashion, defies description. Although Rick Randle, whose bizarre bass playing was such a feature on the first album, is missing on this one, Charlie Fox's immaculate string and horn arrangements more than compensate. Holmes' eccentric songwriting is here in all its rich diversity, the sound quality is outstanding and the production standards superb. As was the case with its predecessor, A Letter... failed to achieve any real commercial impact, so Holmes switched to a more country feel for his next two releases. Obviously, he had perplexed the people at Tower Records enough by this time, and so the label cancelled his contract. Without a safety net, Holmes plunged into the world of TV commercials, which, ironically, is where he was to eventually enjoy his only real financial success. Highly recommended.
