├óΓé¼┼ôThe heart of the Wise Lives in the House of Sorrow├óΓé¼┬¥ can be viewed as an encrypted message, for which the key may be found in the discreet and morbid unobvious twisted black humor. The combination of the Biblical legends indicated with the elements we often forget; the incredible reality. A reality -on which margins- exist characters who are suppressed by the ongoing material and spiritual crisis of today├óΓé¼Γäós society. This film leaves an impression of masterly gloomed glass through which ├óΓé¼ΓÇ£when looked carefully- one can see and feel much better.
