NOTES:
IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Fast & Furious 5

Right here we go we our first release of FF5 ...except more shortly For this we were given two lots of video but both suffered the same issue.....cropping. Quality wise as in colours,brightness etc....the videos were good,so shame really.

Any way to get this the best we could we had to slice and dice both releases together into one....

The camera moved several times so we need to cut and rotate and then crop differently for each part,but by doing this the AR on parts goes off due to keeping the same res so we could append afterwards.

We also cleaned up the video as in the colouring,contrast etc.....
Also got to warn you the crop is still bad in some parts specially arounf 1hr to 1hr 27mins and also alot of the subs are cropped to hell.....but still watchable.

Audio was a bitch to do for several reasons but we got there or dam close in the end ....and yes its line audio 

Enjoy Folks
