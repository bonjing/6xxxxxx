(The purpose of this torrent is to get a clean picture out.)

Encoding: This is one of the darkest, dreariest, most color-leached
films ever made -- if it were any grayer, it'd be a black-and-white
movie. The most challenging aspect was preventing banding in almost
completely dark scenes or portions of the screen (very frequent!);
apparently even the studio had trouble keeping it out, which may
explain the presence of noticeable added grain on a 2010 BD release
of an A-list, big-budget F/X picture. 

Result: Grain removed; slight banding is constrained to transitional
fade-out/fade-in scenes (where it actually enhances rather than
detracts from the film).

Encoding Tool: HDConvertToX 3.0.9.6.4 ...de-noise filters OFF.
