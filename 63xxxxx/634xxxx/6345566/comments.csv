Can you extract and post the original English subtitles please?"
,mike18xx2,2011-05-02T08:44Z,Why would I make a torrent of a 50k text file when you can download it from any of a half-dozen subtitle websites?

I have tried few subtitles from net.
The original sub from source disk will always be a perfect fit and highly precise.
Its the original time index I am interested in, not even the English text in the sub.
Can u send it to freakz dot freakz at g mail dot com Thanks!

I started d'loading the 39 GB torrent. I guess it will take eons to complete that with such slow download. :("
