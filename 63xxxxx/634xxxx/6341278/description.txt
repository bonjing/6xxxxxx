This is a fabulous collection of seven unabridged stories featuring the indomitable barrister, Horace Rumpole. These stories, written by John Moritimer, who was himself a barrister, offer a satirical look inside the British legal system. Best yet, they take an in-depth look at Rumpole - his life, his style, and his keen knack for getting to the bottom of 'things'. As a barrister (a lawyer who specializes in appearing in court vs. working behind the scenes), Rumpole is intrigued and charged with upholding the law. However, he is more than willing to cut a few corners and engage in various shenanigans in order to see that justice reigns supreme - even if what he sees as justice is not exactly what the 'law' demands.

This audio book contains these stories:
Rumpole and the Children of the Devil
Rumpole and the Eternal Triangle
Rumple and the Miscarriage of Justice
Rumpole and the Family Pride
Rumpole and the Soothsayer
Rumpole and the Reform of Joby Jonson
Rumpole on Trial.
