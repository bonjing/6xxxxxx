,ConeBone,2011-04-26T09:06Z,This show pisses me off but I still watch every week. I like Tyler Levine and Jason Biggs outside of this show.. but feel they're badly used in Mad Love. Especially Jason Biggs.. I think he's Hilarious in movies.. but on this show everything he is asked to do is so cookie cutter/typical every day of the week generic sappy sitcom crap. He's better suited for movie roles IMO.. or a sitcom that uses his strengths and is a bit edgy. I hate seeing him act so predictable/safe/tame on this show..
