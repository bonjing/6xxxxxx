"Sinner's Crossroads" is a weekly gospel music broadcast on WFMU-FM, which is also available via live stream, archived streaming audio and podcast at wfmu.org.  Host Kevin Nutt presents both well-known and rare gospel records from the Golden Age of 1945-1975.  This torrent is a collection of some that reached out and grabbed me along the way.
