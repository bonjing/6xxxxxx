It's a soundtrack with no filler...even the single instrumental "Ralph and Monty" feels part of a whole. The brisk uptempo tunes, like the title track, "Hot Lunch Jam" with it's irresistible piano line and the driving gospel of "Never Alone" balance the quiet "Out Here On My Own" and the anthemic "I Sing The Body Electric".
If you are familiar with the TV show, "ER", and unaware that Paul McCrane ("Rocket" Romano on ER) is a significant character in "Fame", you are in for a shock. His songs, "Dogs In The Yard" and "Is It OK If I Call You Mine?" form the emotional core of the soundtrack...the latter song is his composition performed solo on guitar.
