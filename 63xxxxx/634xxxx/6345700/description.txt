Thao Nguyen and Mirah Yom Tov Zeitlyn were friends and like-minded singer/songwriters, so it only made sense for them to collaborate. The pair first played a set at San Francisco, Californias 2010 Noise Pop Festival, and later that year performed a full-fledged tour with their band, the Most of All, which featured members from each of their individual backing bands. They recorded their collaboration at John Vanderslices Tiny Telephone studio with tUnE-yArDs Merrill Garbus as their producer, and the results were Thao & Mirah, which arrived in early 2011.
