 Release Notes

 Video:Vodi Slonam Cam Rip thanks

 Audio:Mustangman thanks bro

 Alright here we go with the first cam for water for elephants used the russian cam rip which has a lot of issues first issue it was recorded at 15fps which makes the video
 seem really laggy/choppy so resampled the f/r to 25 lot more smooth now imo,on to colors the background had a strong yellow tint and all the faces a red tint so added rgb fixed colors
 on to pixelation added a slight smoother then sharpen, in the dark scenes the white levels were whacked out so lowered those dark scenes are eh watchable,all in all came out okay not the best cam i have seen recently but will do for a first copy.

 On to audio we were given audio by our new buddy mustnagman thanks again bro very nice clean audio didn't need much work to it just dropped in adobe removed a slight hiss
 and increaed treble so very audible then just a matter of syncing back to your encode.

 Okay reason for READ NFO the russian cam is missing about 3 minutes odd spots for about 2 seconds here and there so occasionally for about 10 15 seconds audio might be oos
 because its catching up,and the russian cam is missing a minute and a half from the ending but our audio had it so i left the audio intact and just had a scene repeat it's self
 because listening to the audio you will very well understand how the movie ends i really doubt that 1 last minute had any crucial image that would ruin the movie for you.

 As always 2 samples are included check em out before you d/l
