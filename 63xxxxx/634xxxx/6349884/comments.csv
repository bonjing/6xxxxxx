,1dallek1,2011-04-30T15:06Z,"very watchable, a-6 v-6  but its missing parts and at the end the video falls apart but the audio seems to be ok, its kind of a mess but you can get the point of this good movie"
,countrygrlkc,2011-04-30T16:35Z,"any dark images are distorted and blurry and you cant tell whats going on, i would look for a better copy.

,charlik,2011-04-30T16:55Z,"5/5 sounds about right.  It is pretty much always out of focus, there are visual major artifacts and image stuttering in several spots. Plus the audio is only so so in places. "
,MaIravrg,2011-04-30T19:57Z,it doesn't playing gyess!!! :S
,wayneking,2011-05-01T04:58Z,"It does play and is legit', but it is very poor quality, especially the video.  I would say that anyone rating Video as high as 5 is out of their minds.  

A:5, V:3 and that's being generous.  IMO this is  not a watchable copy and I will discard until a better one is uploaded.  Thanks a lot to hiest for sharing the file as usual though.  Keep up the good work."
