,Caleb37,2011-04-24T20:50Z,"Thanks for the final set.  Does anyone have an idea of what program was used to convert these.  The quality is unbelievable and they were moved from a 29.97 frame rate to a forced 23.97, which I'm trying to figure out what program did this so smoothly.  Anyone with an idea can provide input.  Thank you for all of the hard work.  I'm trying to work on the Starman TV series (no retail release - but rather from original recordings I made in the 80's)."
,XiNiTHAOUS,2011-04-25T00:37Z,"The files as far as I'm aware were converted using Handbrake. Starman would probably do a lot better from the retail VHS rip rather than a homemade copy, you could probably still locate them online somewhere. 

What's next Meech? SGA would certainly be greatly appreciated. Thanks for all your hard work."
,Caleb37,2011-04-25T01:13Z,"Actually these were originally recorded in HQ on VHS but then later dubbed to DVD in HQ, so they are roughly 4GB each.  I understand I cannot up the quality, but I'd like to be able to convert them to MKV with the identical format used for the Quantum Leap episodes.  These came out brilliantly.  I'll never achieve the perfect balance due to the source, but close enough is fine to preserve these episodes until the studios eventually release the series on DVD, all of one season that is.  Thank you for your reply.  I'll keep asking until I can get the answer I'm looking for."

[V],meech,2011-04-25T14:38Z,"Hi Caleb37.  Sorry I've been taking so long to get back to you.  I have to run again this morning, but promise will get back to you soon to give you the settings I use in Handbrake.  For now, if you download a program called mediainfo and open one of the files with it, it will tell you the x264 settings that I used."
,Caleb37,2011-04-26T01:33Z,"Meech, thank you so much for your assistance.  I've scoured the internet to find the magic of your specific settings through dozens of guides, but way too much jargon.  I was looking for something specific when I came across your work and was greatly impressed.  I do have Mediainfo and can see the settings used, and can locate most of them, but with all the recent knowledge with PY SD, trellis, and other settings I want to be as specific as possible.  The frame rate flag from 29.97 to 23.97 is beating me badly when I try the setting, but your work shows it can be done and correctly.  If you point the way, I can do it with more than a fair amount of certainty.  I've been working with video for several years on a hobby basis, but now I want to learn to do it better.  If you need to email me, let me know and I'll provide the information.  Again, thank you for the acknowledgment.  Caleb"
,harrylloyd,2011-04-26T17:13Z,"Hey. I absolutely love what you're doing, I've already downloaded all SG-1 and DS9 seasons.

But, do you only rip sci-fi series? For example, I'd love full-res rips of Married ... with Children.

Just curious, thanks again. "
,Duder82,2011-04-26T18:34Z,Thanks mate.
,Kenykool,2011-04-27T12:32Z,"Can you please encode ""Hercules The Legendary journeys"" the same way you did these ones

BTW: Thanks these are great quality "
,ipimen,2011-04-28T03:17Z,"Dude! You rock! What's next?
Too bad you don't like B5, I own the DVD's but is kinda cool to have your rips too.
Any chance of you liking La Femme Nikita :p"
,Kenykool,2011-05-01T01:58Z,"I'm doing Sliders Season 1,2,3 With Handbrake in x264, But I Don't have Season 4 could you encode Season Four?"
[V],meech,2011-05-01T18:44Z,"Caleb37:
I didn't forget about you.  It's just been busy.  And since I get this question from time to time, I figured that I would write a complete tutorial and post it externally since putting it in a comment here would just be too long.  And I can point others to it when I'm asked in the future.  Note: I no longer use Handbrake.  I've been using a program called Vidcoder more recently.  Note that Vidcoder uses the SAME exact code as Handbrake.  It's basically just an alternative user interface/gui to the Handbrake one.  The encoding core engine, libraries and everything else is exactly the same as Handbrake.  The reason I switched is because Handbrake recently got rid of the target size feature.  So there is no easy way to set or predict your target size which makes it useless in certain situations.  Vidcoder powerfully does everything Handbrake does, also with an easy interface, but decided to keep target size which really makes a difference.  I wrote up my manually with screen-shots in MS Word and then converted it to a .pdf file.  I posted it on one of those free online file storage sites.  I can guarantee it scanned free and clean of viruses. It would just take too much to post it here.  It is kind of lengthy and very detailed.  But it covers everything.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Here is the link: http://www.woofiles.com/dl-244651-spjTtj4p-VidcoderSettings.pdf"
[V],meech,2011-05-02T03:32Z,These darn file hosting sites.  Looks like it was already taken down or something. I just tested the file and it didn't work.  I'm trying another site.  Here is a link: http://www.files.com/set/4dbe09368b233
,Caleb37,2011-05-04T03:51Z,"Meech, I can't thank you enough.  I'll review the document you created to see how close I was, or wasn't.  I'll provide feedback when I get to where I should be with this process.  Again, two thumbs up.
Caleb37"
,SorrowExe,2011-05-05T04:19Z,"Thank you Meech for everything youre doing, your rips are awesome and that combined with subtitles makes your rips the best. Tutorial also looks very good and should help people who understand this fine art form!. Any word what series you might be doing next?"
,SorrowExe,2011-05-06T18:44Z,Just had a thought of what you would enjoy and wold wanna rip. Star Wars clone wars. First season is pretty intresting but second and third season are amazing and imo even more better than any of the movies. And there isnt good rips around so they whould come handy.
[A],toba,2011-05-16T10:16Z,"meech: wow! I must say I'm impressed. That pdf looks great. It's times like these that I wish we had a super vip class, which you'd be the first to get. "
,chmt,2011-05-18T10:40Z,"Meech,

I've download your TNG, SG1 and DS9 torrents, and am currently downloading your Space:Above and Beyond and Quantum Leap torrents.

I'd like to say thanks for all the uploads.

Kenykool, I'd be very interested in a high quality x264 DVDRip of Sliders. I've found one on a russian private bittorrent site, but I'm finding it very difficult to maintain a decent ratio there."
,ili2882,2011-06-08T02:31Z,"As a Sci-Fi fan I have to say tanks :)
A suggestion for a possible Rip,
Earth 2, a classic 90's sci-fi show that only run for 1 season, there are no good Rips of it, only a 350mb DVDRip by MEDiEVAL which can only be found on emule."
,danwat1234,2011-09-09T23:51Z,Thank you uploader! Perfect quality! English audio stream.
,PauloFran,2011-12-25T20:25Z,Thank you!
