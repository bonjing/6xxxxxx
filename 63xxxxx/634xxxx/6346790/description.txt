 Each week a different millionaire undertakes a different challenge. These     
 challenges involve changing the lives of normal of everyday people.           
                                                                               
 Sean Gallagher, who made his fortune by setting up his own IT recruitment     
 agency, heads for Middlesbrough to work with the founders of epilepsy         
 awareness charity Abbie's Love. He hopes that by throwing himself into its    
 fundraising efforts, he can finally come to terms with the grief he has       
 struggled with since his only sister died as the result of a seizure          
                                 Enjoy!
