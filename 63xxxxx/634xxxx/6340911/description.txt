Worry. It's universal. It is as much a part of life as breathing. Yet Jesus said, Don't! Don't worry! Easier said than done. In Why Worry, Andy Stanley explores what Jesus had to say about this important topic. You ll discover where worry comes from, why it's so difficult to overcome, and what you can do to conquer worry in your life.
