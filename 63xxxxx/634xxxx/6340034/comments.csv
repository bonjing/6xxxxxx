-The languge is US and International English.
-Only need to use the k/g and patch the hosts file with the included cmd.
-K/g seems virus free (approx.: 70kB). And given number was fine. Report here: https://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=629096ab8962c6a37c1a10217e4250bebae2cbe08d5d25a17fa78283388036da-1305825071
-I've downloaded the Setup (7GB) from adobe.com, so i can't tell you this one is good or not. But the rest is flawless.

MANY THANKS for uploading it!"
