[T],burning.love,2011-04-27T19:58Z,"I don't understand the question, what do you mean by '' How much to go'' ?  Didn't your songs reach the 100 percent ( %) ?"
[V],jeroep,2011-04-27T20:45Z,I meant that you said you had 600 bootlegs. How many bootlegs are you yet going to upload?
[T],burning.love,2011-04-27T22:54Z,"I do not know, about 200"
