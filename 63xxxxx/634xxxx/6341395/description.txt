As the daughter and son of the late Lal Waterson, Maria â€˜Marryâ€™ Waterson and Oliver Knight belong to one of the premier dynasties of English folk (which also includes their cousin Eliza Carthy and her father Martin Carthy). The Days That Shaped Me marks the first time the siblings have recorded music together, a union prompted by a 2007 tribute concert to their mother. Having appeared on stage together, the pair soon found themselves penning a swathe of new music together. It seems they had no trouble attracting other folk luminaries to join them on the record: Kathryn Williams co-wrote â€˜Father Usâ€™ and â€˜Secret Smileâ€™, and sings harmonies on both (Marry previously sang on Kathrynâ€™s Lal-inspired â€˜Winter Is Sharpâ€™ from last yearâ€™s The Quickening); James Yorkston co-wrote and duets on â€˜Yolk Yellow Leggedâ€™; Eliza Carthy sings lead on â€˜The Loosened Arrowâ€™ and plays fiddle on a couple of tracks; and Reuben Taylorâ€™s piano is used to great effect on tracks like the McGarrigle-esque â€˜Run To Catch A Kissâ€™.
