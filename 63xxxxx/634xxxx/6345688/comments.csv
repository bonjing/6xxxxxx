I have downloaded the file but it does not seem to be working. Do i have to unzip anything or download an extra program or something? Please help."

no need for crack just leave game .iso mounted

Works perfect with the dll crack from

- Download 7-zip from portableapps.com
- Unzip the rar-files (just open one of them) with 7-zip
- Mount the iso with Daemon Tools (there is a free version)

If you want more info: open the nfo-file with notepad

Thanks for the upload, will test in a minute"

,Buck.Nasty,2012-01-08T00:26Z,"This one used to work. Now InstallShield stops responding every time I try to install it. Not really an issue with this torrent as I have it with every game that uses that buggy InstallShield shit. Windows 7 Repair Disc did shit to fix it. So, the torrent works unless InstallShield is acting up on your pc too."
