plot

Career criminal Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) and his crew â€” Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer), Michael Cheritto (Tom Sizemore), Trejo (Danny Trejo), and Waingro (Kevin Gage) â€” perpetrate an armored car heist, stealing $1.6 million in bearer bonds from money launderer Roger Van Zant (William Fichtner). During the heist, Waingro impulsively kills one of the guards, forcing the crew to eliminate the remaining two guards out of necessity. An infuriated McCauley tries to kill Waingro afterward, but Waingro escapes. McCauley's fence Nate (Jon Voight) sets up a meeting with Van Zant to sell the bonds back. Van Zant ostensibly agrees, but instructs his men to kill McCauley as a warning to other thieves. With backup from his crew, McCauley thwarts the ambush and vows revenge.
