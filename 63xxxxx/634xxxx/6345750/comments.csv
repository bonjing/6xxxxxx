,10qlife,2011-11-07T19:00Z,"Dear Basil Brush and the MV group, thank you very much for this series. I just needed this I just found you and suspiciously downloaded it because there were no user comment and so so so less seeders. But sice i needed it, i downloaded it and got very surprised to see the download speed, so far this has the best average speed that i have got in all of my torrents downloads. And the quality is HD and its pretty good. Rock on..You really helped me today getting to see it, since i am from outside uk, where bbc dose't work.

Audio: 100%
Video: 100%.


God bless you."
