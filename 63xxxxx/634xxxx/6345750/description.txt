BBC Beautiful Minds 1of3 468p HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup 2010

Series in which three of Britain's most influential and respected scientists explain how their unique scientific perspectives have redefined how we think about the world around us.

Part 1. Jocelyn Bell Burnell.
Professor Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell describes how she discovered pulsars, the by-products of supernova explosions which make life in the universe possible. She describes the moments of despair and jubilation as the discovery unfolded and her excitement as pulsars took the scientific world by storm. Reflecting on the nature of scientific discovery, she talks about the connections between religion and science and how she sees science as a search for understanding rather than as a quest for truth.
