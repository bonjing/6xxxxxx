YOUR F&(*ng tracker/torrents aren't starting for a lot of people here

Any explanation? Fix? it's not ISP shaping or anything... already checked that... 

anyone else having troubles in the last month or so with TvTeam torrents starting? 

If we don't tell TvTeam, they will not be able to fix the problem."
