,drdre2,2011-05-05T07:58Z,Do USB devices work with this version?
,misomian,2011-05-08T16:45Z,"@drdre2: They work if you download and run MultiBeast. In the Multibeast installer, expand Drivers & Bootloaders > Kexts & Enablers > Miscellaneous, and put a check next to IOUSBFamily Rollback. Just that one thing, and click Continue. Reboot the virtual Mac and you're good to go."

,jacko9,2011-06-01T00:13Z,"Hey Guys,

So this is how I got it working for me. Also note, I'm running Windows 7 x64 on AMD and VMWare 7.1.4.

1 ) Download and unpack the archive to your location, add it to VMware
2 ) Because I was unable to login with the given ISO, I downloaded ""EmpireEFI4AMD.iso"".
3 ) Change the (IDE1) CD-ROM to boot with EmpireEFI4AMD.iso, not the EasyEFI v2.2 ver.3
4 ) Boot, F5 and left key over to boot
5 ) If you get to the pretty desktop, continue, otherwise this guide wont work for you
6 ) Outside of your Virtual Machine (still running though) download ""darwin_snow.iso""
7 ) Change IDE2 to darwin_snow.iso (eject if anything is there)
8 ) VMware Tools should popup on the Mac desktop. Double click and install
9 ) Continue with the forced reboot. Unmount darwin_snow.iso after reboot
10) Done.

Thanks guys for this, awesome work. Thanks to the other commenters who helped me figure this out. Hope this helps other people out there too."
