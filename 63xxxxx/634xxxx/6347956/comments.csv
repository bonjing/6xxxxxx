,black_shadow_1981,2011-04-27T16:22Z,i dont have high hopes but im downloading anyway 
,Lobyone,2011-04-27T16:41Z,im not waisting a disk on this. movie to game ALWAYS suck
,mattvoid,2011-04-27T21:55Z,@uzumaki that's because Xmen Wolverine was actually made before the movie though.  the game was going so well that they pitched an idea for a movie.  I will say Cameron's Avatar wasn't a horrible game though.
,FIRE-STARTER,2011-04-27T23:55Z,nice 1 add me on live reaper830
,littledoo,2011-04-27T23:59Z,i agree virtually every movie to game sucks colossal penis!!! and sega??? well what can be said about them. avp was there best attempt at a good game since condemed 2. anyway where the fuck are all the seeders?? this downloads taking the piss!! and for avatar the game!!! ROTFL!what a bag of turd. EPIC movie...helm-sucking game!
,abernick00,2011-04-28T00:26Z,"Wolverine was great!  I've seen the previews for this game, and it looks decent...  I believe mattvoid is wrong... the game was made in conjunction with the movie. The ""xmen: origins"" idea was thrown around well before the game was developed. Sega DID make the iron man games unfortunately, as well... so i dunno. i'm gonna wait and see..."
,capnwinkeh,2011-04-29T17:36Z,"Yea...game is complete shit.  Dull, uninspired, and bland.  Not worth the disc.

IMO Iron Man was the only decent marvel title sega has done so far, and even the 2nd was like they took a dump on the license.  You would think ""hey, this is Thor, it's a brawler...how bad could it be?""...well...find out, just dont say I didnt warn you"
,-Desert_Eagle-,2011-04-29T19:00Z,you will agree with me when i say this game is great..... if your looking to play it on a ps2.... seriously people watch gameplay on youtube before wasting a DVD

,themranonymousguy,2011-05-12T16:05Z,"Guys, my Xbox 360 is already modded. I just want to know that after I download this game, will I just burn it then it can be played on my console? "
,heyman123,2011-05-21T00:59Z,"Yes, if you flashed your Xbox, use abgx to make the .dvd file (I always make one even if it comes with one) and then burn it using IMGburn. Once you finish you pop in the disk and you're done!"
