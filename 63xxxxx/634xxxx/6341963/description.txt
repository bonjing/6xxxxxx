As you should be well-aware right now, here at LessThan3 we are always looking to provide exposure to artists of the world who are worthy of recognition. Several months ago we came across the incredible new talent emerging out of Tokyo and it has become our goal to push their content out in the states and worldwide. Today marks a strong step toward this with the launch of a new podcast, Tokyo Bliss. This very special monthly series will feature mixes from artists on Japanese parter label Otographic Music, one of the leaders in the trance and progressive scene in the land of the rising sun. Want a good sampling of the caliber music you should expect? Check out Nhato, Shingo Nakamura, Hiroyuki Oda, Taishi, and KaNa, for starters. This group of artists alone managed to claim three spots on our Top 20 Trance Tracks of 2010 chart; take that as an indication of what's in store for us all!

Shingo Nakamura will be kicking off the series with the first episode--a beautiful mix of progressive house with many unique tunes, especially the opening jazzy track. Check out the tracklist below, subscribe on iTunes, and download a HQ version of the mix here (right click and "save as"). Enjoy!
