"Liberty Defined" by Ron Paul. Converted to individual chapters in MP3 format from an M4b audiobook.

Mp3 chapter-length files are convenient to burn audio CD's, or for copying to portable MP3 players.

It took some searching to find tools that could convert an 8-hour m4b file into an mp3 file, and that could break apart an 8-hour mp3 file into smaller chapter-length files.

If anyone notices any editing errors, please leave a detailed comment here, and I will correct and re-upload.
