,PhoenixTorrents,2011-05-04T19:09Z,"@seein Seeding is when you sorta re-upload the files to help others download it quicker. The more seeds the quicker it downloads. Also thanks for the positive feedback, one guy said it was a fake? haha guess he didn't really download it. Rate the quality up? would help!"

,nittany,2011-05-12T12:10Z,"I just downloaded this and installed it, but when I go to run it, it says:

""The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect.""

I'm running Windows Vista 32bit SP2, all updates installed.

Any help?"
,nittany,2011-05-12T13:03Z,"I searched around and someone mentioned to reinstall the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables 2005, 2008 and 2010 to get this game to work.  I did that and still didn't work.

Someone else then mentioned that he fixed the same exact problem I have by installing itunes/quicktime so I did that and bam, now it works fine."
,TRMxKNW,2011-05-13T01:23Z,"Works great on Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit!
