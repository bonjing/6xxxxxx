I could not start this straight from a manager (multiman etc.)

,claudio14,2011-06-12T12:18Z,"why is this in PS2 category, if it is a PS3 game??? It's not the only one, so it must be that I don't understand something......

""Type: Games > PS2"""
,Kotapo,2011-07-10T18:55Z,Ok. I get it. I have a replace a file for another one.  patched one... but where do I get it from? Hod do I replace it? can someone please send a link with the file that needs to be replaced or a tutorial for that matter. Thanks
,R.A.A.M,2011-07-13T19:51Z,"to claudio14: 
Its because there is no ""PS3"" section on piratebay, so folks add the ps3 games to ps2 or then in the ""other"" games direction. ALSO easyest way of finding all the ps3 games here is just to simply search for ""ps3"" or first game name and then ""ps3"" after.
hope it helps"
