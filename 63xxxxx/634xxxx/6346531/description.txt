Ramayan is a highly successfulIndian television series created, written, and directed by Ramanand Sagar. 

The 78-episode series originally aired weekly on Doordarshan from January 25, 1987, to July 31, 1988, on

It is a television adaptation of the ancient Indian religious epic of the same name and is primarily

Kamban's Kambaramayanam and other works

[ World record ]

At the time it aired, Ramayan quickly rose to become the most popular program in the history of Indian 

television, a title it held until B. R. Chopra's Mahabharat aired, which was after the end of Ramayan's 

original run. Subsequently, through re-runs and video productions, Ramayan regained popularity and was 

listed in the Limca Book of Records as the world's "most viewed mythological serial" until June 2003

[Development]

In 1986, following the moderate success of his television series Vikram aur Betaal and while he was in 

the midst of producing Dada-Dadi Ki Kahaniyan, Ramanand Sagar approached executives at Doordarshan about 

the possibility of producing a serialized version of the Ramayana, of which Sagar was a lifelong 

devotee. The idea was initially rejected, then revived, but delayed due to concerns that such a 

television series might lead to a rise in communalism.Finally, the show was indeed approved for 52 

episodes (which would later be expanded twice in response to the series' overwhelming popularity, each 

time by 13 episodes, bringing the total to 78 episodes), and was given the unpopular time slot of Sunday 

morning at 9:30 a.m.Doordarshan budgeted Sagar Rs. 100,000 per episode
