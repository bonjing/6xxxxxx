A thunderhead of suspense." -Stephen Holden, The New York Times
Set in New York during the height of World War II, Focus recounts the
 unraveling of an American community when the identity of a man (William H.
 Macy) and his wife (Laura Dern) are mistaken. Slowly ostracized at home and
 work, they learn the value of self and solidarity as they struggle to
 maintain dignity and find happiness. Focus marks the directorial debut of
 award-winning photographer Neal Slavin, and is adapted by Kendrew Lascelles
 from the Arthur Miller novel of the same name. The film stars William H.
 Macy, Laura Dern, David Paymer and Meat Loaf Aday.
