The building blocks of MEMS design through closed-form solutions
Microelectromechanical Systems, or MEMS, is the technology of very small systems; it is found in everything from inkjet printers and cars to cell phones, digital cameras, and medical equipment. This book describes the principles of MEMS via a unified approach and closed-form solutions to micromechanical problems, which have been recently developed by the author and go beyond what is available in other texts. The closed-form solutions allow the reader to easily understand the linear and nonlinear behaviors of MEMS and their design applications.
