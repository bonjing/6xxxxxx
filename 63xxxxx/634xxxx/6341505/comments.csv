,saxykoolz,2011-05-04T20:26Z,"phail movie imo dont waste your time watching it ...

as for people looking for hot sex scenes there are none which can make one feel the heat so its a fucking gay movie altogether....

lastly the story sucks big time i mean fail talk unreal bullshit taking over
more like it was a movie made to resurrect natalie portman's image that she could be a bad gal too...but even as i watched the movie my mind just told me she just a psychic bitch and in a few minutes she will go all black swan ....RAWR!

Ashton K should quit and natalie should star only as a psycho gal from now on coz other roles dont suit her really. "

,isteal2,2011-05-09T23:48Z,"@YgooN - that letter is NOT from Comcast. It's a load of shit. Dont worry bud, you wont be fined or get in trouble - ignore the letters and enjoy your movies. Absolutely nothing is going to happen to you or your internets. Just make sure you have a firewall. "

@lestatvvvvvv: The modem has little to do with it. It's basically like this; A is a downloader, B is an uploader, and C is someone trying to find people with the movie and send emails about copyright infringement. A downloads from B, then C pretends to want to download from A and B. A has PeerBlock, or Peer Guardian, and knows the IP address of C is blacklisted, and says to C: ""sorry, no torrents here!"", while B doesn't have a peer checking program, and says ""Sure, I have it!!! Come on in!"". C calls the Internet provider for B and says ""At this time, on this IP address, someone broke the law"". The Provider sends B an email, and there you go."

,Barosanescu,2011-06-14T03:52Z,For the idiots that said that the torrents are not being tracked: MOST new releases are being tracked ( in the US ) and reported to the individual's ISP. The ISP gives an HTML warning to the individual and then has him AGREE to some conditions. Click YES and your internet is restored instantly. So STFU if you do not know what you are talking about ! THEY DO TRACK THE IP'S so use proxies !!!

Cyber Ghost is free but you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re limited on how much you can download, while Ipredator doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t cost much and you can download as much as you want, and best of all the bastard film companies can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t catch you.
