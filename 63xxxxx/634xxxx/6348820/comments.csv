,markrr,2011-05-03T14:07Z,"It's probably the BBC America special 'Doctor Who Rewind' that recaps season 5.

,k3nd00d,2011-05-04T00:42Z,"Yes, markrr, it is."
,Leonidas123,2011-05-22T11:23Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436992/episodes#season-6

That one is S06E00, not this one, this is different."
,k3nd00d,2011-06-23T12:39Z,"Leon, you don't know what you're talking about. Any special outside of the storyline is e00. The typical Christmas specials tend to also be considered e00 too, e00 is a bit arbitrary here and as specified at imdb for the xmas special."
,k3nd00d,2011-06-23T12:41Z,The bbc doesn't give this nor xmas specials an official episode number as far as I know.
