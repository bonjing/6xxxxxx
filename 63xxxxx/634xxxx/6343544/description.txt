This Week's Show: Watching the Watchmen

Police officers have unusual powers.  They can arrest you, shoot you.  Iâ€™d think it would be important to have a video record of their behavior.   But in the last few years -- in more than a dozen states -- citizens have been threatened, detained, or arrested after recording the police.

In this weekâ€™s FBN show (Thurs., 10pm EST), I ask Reason Magazineâ€™s Radley Balko: What's happened to the people who were arrested for videotaping cops at work?  He explains that most people arenâ€™t actually prosecuted, but often their property is confiscated and they spend a night in jail.
