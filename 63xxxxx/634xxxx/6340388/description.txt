There are many dividing lines in rock and roll: before Elvis and after Elvis, before The Beatles and after The Beatles, and so on. Highway 61 Revisited was such a turning point, a defining moment: the point where Bob Dylan dropped the folk mystique and went straight-ahead into rock. After this, it was evident that rock and roll had meaning, that it was a viable art form. Here Dylan transcend popular music and sent it spinning into areas artists are still exploring. One of Dylan's most defining albums and a ticket to immortality.
