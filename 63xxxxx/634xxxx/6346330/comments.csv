,paulderby,2011-04-26T19:34Z,any subs on this?
,theredhead777,2011-04-26T21:06Z,"Can someone please comment on subtitles

I have only found 1 comment, that says these are translated poorly from finnish version

Are subtitles OK and in sync???????"
,theredhead777,2011-04-27T10:33Z,"Just screened movie, with English SRT [Subtitles]  Great Video + Audio [but] English Subtitles, which are necessary! : The translation is for all languages, Spanish, Chinese, African [but] these subtitles must have been translated by Babelfish from Finnish subtitles as they do not make sense a lot of the time

,normgregory,2011-04-27T12:42Z,Yes there is an English.srt in the SUBTITLES.rar in the download.  I have not look at them yet.

V/9 
Totally agree with theredhead777 comments the subs seem to be jumbled up and donât make sense some of the time, pity because the movie is pretty decent and the copy is good quality... 
Many Thanx to .BONE. and playXD for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:)"
,theredhead777,2011-04-27T20:00Z,"Seems to be a new copy with hard-coded subs

,Erich505,2011-06-02T19:35Z,"Thanks for all the srt subtitle suggestions, but I'm not looking to join a club, or register my email address, or have a password sent to me. I'm just looking for subtitles. The way I look at it, if it aint hard coded, they don't see me as an audience for this movie and that's cool too. Plenty of other movies."
,ns194,2011-09-18T00:58Z,"MPAA is watching this one, BTW. Got a message from my ISP about this torrent in particular..."
