,NagatoYuki,2011-05-05T05:20Z,"To: sirv_
just check the 'crack' dir of the iso file.
To all:
Notice that for lacking shortcut else problems, it might due to selecting MATLAB Distributed Computing Server.
This stupid behavior also happen in R2010b.

I have tested that modify the components in custom install (I deselect the MATLAB Distributed Computing Server), then the next page should shown the file associations and shortcut page, then after install, all the things seems OK  "
,lil_neutrino,2011-05-06T03:30Z,"Thanks so much!!!!    Works great. BTW why so many iso files? I just used the last one, didnt know which one to choose. "

,Telemaque,2011-06-02T09:29Z,"Hi , I have a pb with the install... I mount the ISO with daemon, I launch setup.exe,  i see a window indicating that it copies some files to C: /users/..., then the logo matlab appears... and then it shut downs.

I try several time : no way to launch the installer properly. I am using win 7 64. Any idea ?"
,tanyajs,2011-06-21T15:26Z,"Pease help!  I understand how to do the install, the problem is the crack folder. Both the install.txt and the two license (.dat) files are corrupted / encoded / encrypted.  They are not text files (they should be).  The actual install files are working. I have noticed that other people had the same problem, but I don't know how they solved it.  I have exactly the same problem trying to install 2009b and 2010a.  What am I (and other people) doing wrong?  Why some people see text files while others get binary garbage?  Is it some kind of character encoding or somethink completely stupid that I am missing?  "

,nick000,2011-07-05T05:15Z,"@those who see the install.txt file as corrupt:
@InstallforMacOSX not working

DO NOT extract the mI2011au.iso file. Mount the whole image in diskimagemounter first. 
happy installing :)"

,blueeeyes,2011-08-31T04:34Z,hey.... quick question... so i get all the files on power iso... it extracts... i press setup.exe... and it says that i don't have java_launcher.dll even though its 2 items above it. Maybe i'm stupid... but i still need help :D
,izaakvac,2011-09-12T06:34Z,"I don't find any .exe in the folder...
what am I doing wrong?? :/ I really need it. "
,saihla,2011-09-12T10:11Z,"@izaakvac - it's not an exe, you have to extract the iso from the rar files. I used 7-zip.


My problem: when I provide the path for lic_standalone.dat, I get this error: ""Unable to install license file. Incorrect function""

Already spent hours downloading, extracting and installing it only to get stuck here! Any ideas?"

,sketter2011,2011-09-16T20:06Z,"hi MAFIAA, do you know when the 2011b release will be available? TBE releases are always perfect and I hope they keep on doing this great job. thanks"
,SumeklamKidd,2011-09-19T23:19Z,"varunstein, people like you  are really what make the world a bad place, in as far as it is bad. Everyone starts somewhere. My preference is to help others with what I have learned, rather than flame on them. GROW UP, PLEeeeeASSEeee...."
,Xinthose,2011-09-23T01:36Z,"/****************************************

1. Use winrar to open the first .rar file (idk why there are so many of them)

2. Mount the extracted .iso using Virtual CloneDrive

3. Go to My Computer and double click on the mounted .iso image

4. Go into the crack folder and follow the directions on the install text document after double clicking the setup.exe

5. Program will take a good 20 minutes at least to install

6. Copy the crack folder into the new installation directory

7. Select the appropriate file when it asks for it to activate the product

8. Search your computer for 'matlab' , create a shortcut to it, and put it on your desktop

9. It should work now and you can delete all of the rest of the stuff that came out of the .iso

10. Thanks to the original uploader and God Bless! Spread the love.

,grungefreak91,2011-11-16T20:26Z,"Ok, so i extracted the file, but I can't mount the .iso.  I extracted the .rar to my desktop, and then tried to mount that file, didn't work.  Am i missing something?"

,MistrzFil,2011-12-30T14:45Z,works greatly many thanks and best wishes and happy NEW YEAR for everyone!
,MistrzFil,2011-12-31T17:09Z,I've complimented it too early...my fault. In fact it was sth wrong with this release on my pc.  I couldn't use the m file functions and all of the matlab looked as if it was sth wrong with it. I reinstalled it twice without MATLAB Distributed Computing Server but nothing has changed. I don't know what I did wrong. Any way I tried newer version http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6717055/Mathworks.Matlab.R2011b and it works now as it should. I wrote there in the comments about the necessary installation of C compiler. Maybe it is the same reason why matlab goes wrong after the installation here?
,keyyen,2012-01-15T16:12Z,thnx.. :D
,Ailmental,2012-03-01T16:16Z,"it says ,it cannot find main program execution ,sth like that....the file has everything ,i install matlab and i cannot run it ...:("
