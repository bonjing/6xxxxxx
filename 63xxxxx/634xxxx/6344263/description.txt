Format: mp3

An album thats warm yet distant. Dissonant to commercial music, yet reinvigorating to the indepth listeners. Harsh sounds, but so such an amazing album to chill to.

Tracks:
Made in Hong Kong
Endless Summer
A Year in a Minute
Caecilia
Got to Move On
Shisheido
Before I Leave
Happy Audio
