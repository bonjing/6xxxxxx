,sazr,2011-04-25T12:25Z,"@yudhistir i went for the kaos one because it had audio, i download from all the rippers and they all good for different reasons, the kaos one worked fine, just because your av is free,cheap or over sensitive dont mean theres a trojan, most people on pb know that by now. and from reading the comments on the rip 90% of the downloaders have had no issues me included. and if the audio didnt work why would globe use it in his release to start with, its you who needs to wake up matey. @globeplus its nice to see you redeme yourself by making your own rip of this game, i will continue to keep checking for your uploads :) keep it up"

,yudhistir,2011-04-25T15:56Z,"PPL Supporting Kaos rip - Do you even know what a virus is and how to detect it ? The Kaos RIP Installer has ""Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Dadobra.bru"" infection which means once you run the installer it wont just install the game but also modify your system using stealth techniques so your retarted free/cracked version antivirus cannot detect it and will allow your system to be further infected by malware generating large amount of network traffic activity with the consequent consumption of bandwidth. It terminates processes belonging to security tools, leaving the computer vulnerable to other malware attacks. It uses stealth techniques to avoid being detected by the user. It spreads , across the Internet. Help yourself , get educated.  FYI this infection was detected by a genuine and paid for security software. Globe does not needs to steal someone else's rips , he himself is a pretty good ripper"

but can you give me a tip about HOW TO start the game????"
,SilenceWillFall,2011-05-09T22:01Z,"@globeplus:

This is really silly, there is one problem with your first release and a different problem with this release* - if you combined the two it would be perfect, no flaws, take the working gameplay from one and mix it with the working audio from the other. Is there any way you can do that so it's perfectly perfect? Or is it just me that has this problem?

* the problem with the light version is that it's not got any sound, and the problem with the Dream version is that it crashes during gameplay and has elements from the scene missing (eg walking in air rather than on a gangway).  "
