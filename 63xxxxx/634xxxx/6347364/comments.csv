,daba_1,2011-04-27T14:13Z,"This is a delightful 18-track collection recorded live at Nina's Lounge in Chicago on July 9, 1963.

Sunnyland Slim and J.B. Lenoir each do a solo song before teaming up. Their friends include St. Louis Jimmy Oden, John Lee Granderson and Mike Bloomfield. Good friends to have, indeed.

This is an intimate performance that makes the listener feel as if they were at the tiny, 50-member audience, Chicago clubs of that era. Most of the songs include the discussion with the audience that precedes each performance. It is hard to believe that when this recording was made it featured performers that could not get booked at the larger major clubs of the time.

The CD progresses as J.B and Sunnyland take turns with solo songs and inviting their guests on stage. There is an interesting contrast between Sunnyland Slim's booming voice and the high-pitched vocals of J.B. Lenoir.

This CD is an excellent example of Chicago blues and shows the versatility of that style of Blues."
