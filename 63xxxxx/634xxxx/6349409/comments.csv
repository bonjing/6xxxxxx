,MokiWoki,2011-04-28T10:17Z,"_0_, Nice job!!"
,realq,2011-04-30T00:23Z,Torrenten är intressant.. hjälp tilll att seeda
,erroneus,2011-04-30T13:19Z,"This is indeed a DVD rip and not BluRay or other high definition source.  That said, it's still an awesome torrent.  I have all of the DVDs already and have been meaning to rip them for years.  Just too lazy.  Now I don't have to!  Still... will take several days to complete this.  My IP filters are not getting any hits from ""unwanted peers"" so this one is not on the radar.  I will seed for a long while."
,MokiWoki,2011-05-02T12:36Z,Good qualitie! 600Mb per episode! 2.0 sound. I'll seed till 1:1. it may take a while!!!
,realq,2011-05-06T01:20Z,Seed on!!! And sorry for putting this torrent in the highres... clumpsy mistake on my part
,erroneus,2011-05-16T10:59Z,"I need to know, what conversion methods did you use to create these files?  My computer plays them but my Argosy player doesn't.  I think I want to rip my own DVDs but so far the programs I have used do not treat the video and aspect ratios properly."
,monster.x,2011-06-01T23:39Z,"Good A/V Quality, but the english subtitles are probably the worst i have ever seen (luckily they are not hardcoded).

Anyway, thanks for providing this, realq"

,realq,2011-09-05T22:40Z,"Om någon har lust att översätta skulle jag bli glad, torrenten har jag gjort själv eftersom det inte finns någon komplett torrent med alla avsnitt härute, jag har inte rippat dom utom jag har laddat & laddat & laddat.. det tog mig säkert flera veckor innan det blev komplett.. förresten så skall meech ha all credit för sitt jobb ""han som rippade"" men eftersom det var så seg/låg hastighet bestämde jag mig för att lägga upp denna"
,realq,2011-09-05T22:46Z,P.s jag har seedat säkert 20-30 Terrabyte.. av denna torrent.. men som sagt det finns en hel del hit&run nissar & jag har full förståelse för de med... men vill man ha på gratis får man på seeda
,bill2011,2011-11-09T01:05Z,"Hey , great  torrent , any chance of some more seeders , I'm trying to seed as much as i can ! speed isn't so great. hits 340kbps ocassionally but usually during the day 30kbps."
,lolm8lolm8,2011-12-07T16:19Z,Thanks alot seeders and especially realq for uploading!
,animext,2012-01-08T09:52Z,"Please seed people, as I always have :) I'll leave this on for months if need be. "
,realq,2012-01-09T19:19Z,:-) Keeping it alive thanx
,RegPulp,2012-01-16T02:24Z,"Be Warned, these were not de-interlaced correctly, I believe Handbrake or similar may of been used which uses Decomb, which unfortunately does not work well in small areas, I.E. Blinking of the eyes.
The auto-detection threshold never works well on TV SciFi shows from the 90's. (startrek TNG-DS9-VOY)

Unfortunately it makes this whole set useless, the frames as a whole are fine, but small areas within the frames contains interlacing.

Blinking of the eyes really show the problem.

NOTE: it doesn't happen all the time, but it's there and quite damaging considering the HQ this collection represents.
