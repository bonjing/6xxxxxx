This torrent contains a complete Blind Guardian studio discography, in FLAC quality. The older albums aren't really included, only the 2007 remasters. The original older albums will be included later

FLAC quality: everything is transcoded with level 8 compression, assuring the smallest file size.

File naming scheme: (year - album/track - date), suitable even for cheap music players. Every album contains artwork (cover.jpg at the very least). 

Artwork: I tried to keep a sane file size, without compromising quality a lot. JPG @ 80% quality or so. Artwork is simply collected, I haven't scanned anything.

I have also removed all the useless extra crap (nfo, m3u, txt, log) and converted complete disc rips to one track per file storage scheme, thus removing the cue sheets too.

Sources: Sin/Pecado, The Antidote and Night Eternal are my own rips.
