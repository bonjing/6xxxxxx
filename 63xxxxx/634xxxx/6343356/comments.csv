,pb_lsd,2011-04-25T16:28Z,"You didn't see that, carry on."
[T],willrain,2011-04-26T00:23Z,"tnx. I'll compare this with my release - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5362633/Moonspell (but anyway, remasters is a crap ;) )"
,pb_lsd,2011-04-26T03:19Z,"Well, irrelegious and wolfheart do sound a bit better than the original 95/96 albums, plus they have those worthless bonus tracks everybody loves! I have yet to find a remaster that's re-recorded, so i suppose no harm down with either version (i have the old ones too as flac, if you're interested). but i agree, remasters are usually just crap from the record label to get more money.

however, under satanÃ¦ is a complete rework of the older goat of fire/under the moonspell/anno satanÃ¦ albums, and sounds way better. i have those, but only mp3 :(

nice torrent. if i knew there's already one up, i wouldn't have bothered upping this one. oh well."
[T],willrain,2011-05-01T19:42Z,"So...
All albums except ""Night Eternal"" identical to my release, so i just copied missing album art (mostly ""cd.jpg"") to my collection. My version of ""NE"" has wrong breakpoints between some tracks, so i replaced this album with your version (thanks for rip :) ).
Remasters of ""Wolfheart"" and ""Irreligious"" can't sounds better because it's just recompressed 95/96 releases (i already have both versions and compared them) - you can take originals, enable dynamic range compression plugin in your player and get the ""2007 remasters"" :).
May be i'll reupload new version of discography with all this changes soon."
