Various Artists
The Essential Detroit
Soul Collection (1992)




Digitally remastered from original tapes & 45's


This collection of 23 obscure soul tracks, recorded for small time Detroit labels during the '60s, will intrigue collectors, but offers little for interest for casual fans. The Masqueraders, Tony Clarke, and Steve Mancha are the most familiar artists, notwithstanding Rosey Grier, the football player turned actor turned reverend, who also sang a bit. Two tracks by Jackey Beavers, who began with Johnny Bristol as Johnny & Jackie, are also on deck. If you like Detroit soul, you've probably been panting for this CD, but less devoted soul enthusiasts will not be especially excited by this.
