,tfizz,2011-04-29T05:11Z,"@pinkertow

You are a douche wad bro.  ""Thanks I guess""  Bow down to all the HARD WORK that EZTV GROUP puts into these releases.  If it were not for EZTV GROUP, I would have to pay like 80$ a month for cable.  

The fact that you come on here and admit you own a fucking iPad lets everyone here know you are a n00b douche wad.

next pls"

Yea, learn to convert your media like the rest of us you little bitch."
,nornin,2011-06-09T01:33Z,"How on earth can 5646 people be seeding but nothing is downloading?
I just don't get it!"
,jherrmann,2011-06-10T03:31Z,"I must agree with nomin. I've been trying to download for two days now and am still at 0%. Had connection errors on the tracker for a while, but even when that's OK I have 0 peers.

Either something is fishy or all 5645 seeders are busy seeding other torrents.

Will give it another day and then switch to a different torrent/release."
,jherrmann,2011-06-10T08:34Z,Correction - maybe the issue was my computer. Restarted and suddenly there's a whole pile of peers. :)
