Get a grip on your racquet like never before in Virtua Tennis 4. Boasting its strongest ever player line-up, Virtua Tennis 4 features the world's top stars such as world No.1 Rafael Nadal, 16-time major champion Roger Federer and UK No.1 Andy Murray. Joining them for the first time are seven new champions making their debut to the series, enabling players to take on the likes of Juan MartÃ­n Del Potro, Fernando Gonzalez, Caroline Wozniacki and Laura Robson.

In addition, Virtua Tennis 4 sees a new World Tour career mode designed to encourage replay value with an element of off-court fame. Each decision affects a player's career path meaning no two careers will ever be the same, while a brand new on-court feature makes for even more dramatic singles and doubles matches. Players can build up their Match Momentum gauge over the course of a match and revel in their improved ability as their players grow in confidence.
