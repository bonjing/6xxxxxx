Here's what the trainer consists of:


F6  - Inf. Medicine, Bullets, Crossbow, Money, Smoke Bombs Poison, etc.                               

F7 -Infinite Knives              

F8  - Stopwatch freeze at 6.66 seconds (disable this cheat when not needed)    

F9  - Countdown Timer freeze at 25 seconds (disable this cheat when not needed)

R   - Slow motion game speed will decrease to 40% within 7 seconds, press again to repeat whole procedure   

Y   - Normal Speed, disables previous cheat

,Philonetic,2011-06-23T19:43Z,"The only thing this trainer is missing is infinite health, you can get the trainer with it here - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6340133

But you'll still need THIS trainer for the time freeze."
