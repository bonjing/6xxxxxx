,KalmahFTW,2011-04-30T14:28Z,"@Zee996 Screenshot is down, can anyone verify this? All you get in here is an exe called epicbot_520.exe, gonna verify it in a min."
,yokillernick,2011-05-01T14:10Z,"it is clean i ran it. but the problem is that after it started it says that since is my first time starting it it will open its website then 2 sec later it says ""found updates epicbot will shutdown and begin downloading updates "" i leave it for 2 min and then when i start it again it says the same thing as above. it opens the site and says about the updates and shuts down again. any help please zee? "
,robenshtiel,2011-05-01T15:41Z,"Installed, works fine, same as the free download on the website. downloaded for the pro scripts, which arnt there. if it has something to do with the update, then i understand, but just thought id let you all know that the 'pro scripts' just arnt here"
,robenshtiel,2011-05-01T15:42Z,"@yokillernick that was the RS update, there another update which solves this problem"

,Bori93,2011-06-07T16:01Z,SOoo i downloaded for no reason?? its not supported yet :/
,Charzrls,2011-06-12T02:53Z,So the pro versions are cut out by the updates? and there isn't a way to get them for free? 
,azxo,2011-07-01T21:07Z,Bot = Gay
,azibet,2011-07-02T02:59Z,No pro bots anymore.
,rik801,2011-07-12T20:02Z,it works but there are errors in java before what should I do?
,DemonicBlaze,2011-07-26T11:34Z,"Please fix, or delete this torrent... It's very misleading as Epicbot has patched this exploit and it no longer works...
Thank you for your efforts though."
,extrem3hunt,2011-08-31T21:47Z,Any1 ever got banned of using epic bot?
,extrem3hunt,2011-08-31T21:48Z,Any1 ever got banned of using epic bot?????
,cheeto46,2011-09-24T04:04Z,"Holy fuck this this is AWESOME! I use it for auto-fishing, and its anti-ban system is AMAZING.

It moves the cursor randomly sometimes, as if I bumped the mouse or hesitated to make an action, rotates the camera, checks my stats by hovering over my current botting skill, and everything a player would do.

It acts more human than me! This torrent is freaking genius. Please, DOWNLOAD IT.

It helps to talk to people while you bot."
,AhhSlowpoke,2011-09-25T06:58Z,"If this bot client doesn't work for you try using this one. It has flawless randoms and the anti ban is great. This is the most recent client version.

,Wilk_Freeman,2011-10-19T21:07Z,"It's an okay bot, fast as hell download which is great. Bot is not bad it doesn't have every bot in the world but it has the essentials and it does it alright, better then powerbot (formally rsbot.com)"
,akdawnzyy,2011-10-29T20:20Z,"epicbot stops loading the game after 42% now. i think it may be because of the new ""bot nuke day"", anyone else still using this program ?? "

,hootie100,2012-05-27T22:18Z,"LOL @ nick.1 you think the police give two shits about your problem with runescape? You do realize in the Terms of Service, you don't own any of that stuff in your bank. RuneScape does, even if it is on your ACCOUNT. Read your Terms of Service before you open your dumbass mouth. You are delusional. The police have other things to worry about then your free virtual goods."
,hootie100,2012-05-27T22:19Z,"LOL ajdv that was a good try, oh all I got to do is email you my account so you can take it? GTFO you worthless piece of shit, and all you other wankers that posted a link"

this one was okay, but didnt include the bots"
,luminatx,2012-06-05T09:01Z,"This no longer works as its outdated.
When you go to start it, it says it needs to update which removes the crack. and there's no way to stop it from updating."
,luminatx,2012-06-06T20:28Z,"Also to boot, do not use these cracked versions.
All they do is take your account info and then steal all your shit."
