Follow up of Brothers In Arms, that gave Dire Straits the global pop-stars status, On Every Street is full of achingly beautiful, transcendent, evocative, lovingly created lyrics and music, all underscored by one of our most amazingly talented and tasteful guitarists, Mark Knopfler. These songs run the gamut of human emotions: an album for the ages, full of laughter, sadness, longing, irony, grace, and spontaneity.
