Death of a Salesman is a 1949 play written by American playwright Arthur Miller. It was the recipient of the 1949 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and Tony Award for Best Play. Premiered at the Morosco Theatre in February 1949, the original production ran for a total of 742 performances.

Miller's play represents a democratization of the ancient form of tragedy; the play's protagonist is himself obsessed with the question of greatness, and his downfall arises directly from his continued misconception of himselfâ€”at age 63â€”as someone capable of greatness, as well as the unshakable conviction that greatness stems directly from personal charisma or popularity.

On March 29, 1984 at the Broadhurst Theatre, running for 97 performances. Dustin Hoffman played Willy. In a return engagement, this production re-opened on September 14, 1984 and ran for 88 performances. The production won the Tony Award for Best Revival and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival. 

Death of a Salesman (German: Tod eines Handlungsreisenden) is a 1985 made for television film directed by Volker SchlÃ¶ndorff, based on the 1949 play of the same name by Arthur Miller. It stars Dustin Hoffman, Kate Reid, John Malkovich, Stephen Lang and Charles Durning. The film follows the script of the 1949 play almost exactly.

  Dustin Hoffman  ...  Willy Loman  
  Kate Reid  ...  Linda Loman  
  John Malkovich  ...  Biff Loman  
  Stephen Lang  ...  Harold 'Happy' Loman  
  Charles Durning  ...  Charley  

Todayâ€™s economic adversity highlights just what a timeless masterpiece Arthur Miller created in Death of a Salesman. As Joyce Carol Oates wrote in an essay about this powerful work, America has become an ever more frantic, self-mesmerized world of salesmanship, image without substance, empty advertising rhetoric, and that peculiar product of our consumer culture â€˜public relationsâ€™â€”a synonym for hypocrisy, deceit, fraud. Like the Lomans, millions of families sold on the benefits of the new Gilded Age bought the refrigerator with the biggest ads, only to find themselves suckered. Maybe our depression will be spun as the Greater Depression.

In 1984, during the opening assault of market wisdom, a revival of Death of a Salesman was mounted on Broadway with Dustin Hoffman as the title character. It toured the hinterlands, including Chicago, and I spent more on a ticket than I had ever spent in my life ($35) to see Hoffman, John Malkovich, Kate Reid, and Stephen Lang bring the first family of American tragedy to life on stage. The following year, the play was turned into a television movie. The cast remained largely intact, with Charles Durning replacing David Huddleston as Willyâ€™s friend Charley and veteran film director Volker SchlÃ¶ndorff replacing theatre director Michael Rudman.

Millerâ€™s searching dialogue and painful family dynamics allow the cast great room to breathe life into his characters. Hoffman, criticized for being too small for the part because of the stamp the towering Lee J. Cobb put on it in its Broadway debut (and Millerâ€™s original dialogue, which alludes to Willy being a fat man), is actually too young. He exaggerates Willyâ€™s physical infirmities, something that worked better on stage than it does in front of a camera. Nonetheless, he manages to find bridges to the other characters, creating the fractious love needed between Willy and Biff and a pitiful loneliness that comes out best in his brilliant duets with Durning, who plays Charley with sympathy, clarity, and exasperated understanding.

Kudos to Jon Polito, who plays Howard, Willyâ€™s boss. He isnâ€™t horrible, nor is he sympathetic. He is merely a businessman who is so out of touch with Willyâ€™s financial plightâ€”though he pays Willyâ€™s salaryâ€”that he suggests Willy buy a wire recorder, the most fascinating relaxation Iâ€™ve foundâ€¦You canâ€™t do without it. Business is business, and he can eat the orange and throw the peel away.

This image of an emptied shell is repeated again and again in Death of a Salesman, and is realized to its greatest effectâ€”as only film canâ€”in an overhead shot looking directly down into the Loman home. SchlÃ¶ndorff surrounds this roofless, peeling dwelling with flats of the neighboring buildings. The image is very startling and emphasizes the vulnerability of this family. He contrasts it with memory scenes of the Lomans going off to watch Biff in the big gameâ€”trees, open fields, emphasizing youth and the wide-open possibilities that still exist for Willy and Biff. SchlÃ¶ndorff sticks with a moody, staged production, with spotlights illuminating Ben and then fading when Willy returns to reality. SchlÃ¶ndorff lets his camera go one timeâ€”when Willy is raving incoherently in a bathroomâ€”spinning with Hoffman as he tumbles to the ground. He uses slow motion in a POV shot of Biff watching Rossetter twirl in her underwear and flop voluptuously on Willyâ€™s bed, again suggesting an image in Biffâ€™s mind rather than what probably happened. And, of course, he has the advantage of being able to shoot close-ups to capture the emotions that race through his actorsâ€™ eyes.

The 1984 revival of Death of a Salesman was a theatrical triumph, and a prescient one at that. This independent television production, very well realized by SchlÃ¶ndorff, preserves and reinterprets this landmark staging for future generations.
