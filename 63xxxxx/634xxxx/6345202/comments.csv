It is read by Deborah Findlay and abridged by Doreen Estall. Detective Inspector Jack Whicher finds himself traveling to a remote country house where he investigates the murder of a young child. He soon manages to discover a web of lies and concealment amid the family living there, which he thinks vindicates the police's chief suspect in the murder case. "
