the retarded Paquerette, who ate his six months sister; and the intellectual, Lassalle who killed his wife. One night, CarrÃ¨re finds an ancient journal hidden in 
a hole in the wall of the cell. They realize that the book was written by Danvers in the beginning of the last century and is about black magic. 
They decide to read and use its content to escape from the prison, when they find the truth about Danvers' fate.

*I don't take requests because I don't have time and everyone will fill the comment section with them instead of commenting about quality and other tehnical specs of the movies or say thanks.Thank you for understanding!
*For best performance I suggest you use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback
*These movies were made especially for PC and they don't play on a PS3.If you want to re-encode for PS3 or test for other devices be my guests.
*I'll ask everybody to stop with the "it doesn't work","it's out of sync" comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine.
