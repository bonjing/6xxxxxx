This is the taped live performance from the Metropolitan opera,capturing all the fun and excitement of a live show. The production itself is tops,as is the music of conductor James Levine and the performances of Pavarotti,Battle,Dara and Pons,along with the entire cast.This is the opera house at its most entertaining and i think that even people who generally dont like opera,they will like this.It is full of fun and humour,and the cast clearly has a good time with the audience. Strangely, it is still not available on DVD!
