,neil_diamond ,2011-05-01T05:45Z,"I really don't get this..no seeds? after hours of trying?

Would you like a membership to a private site where people can't hit n run, must maintain a 1-1 ratio? Currently this thing says 228 seeds and I got ZERO on utorrent, this is ridiculous!"
,devpat,2011-05-02T12:04Z,"i will be seeding for some time but there seems to be a problem. while downloading the site showed 234 seeds(TPB). but when downloaded not a single one...
