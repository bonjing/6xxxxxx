,Blink-,2011-05-26T15:28Z,"Has anyone been successful at installing this on Ubuntu 11.04? When I install it I am never prompted for a Symbolic Link option, it goes straight to install. I've tried running both Typical and Custom installs, but no luck. Can someone shed some light on this?

I also tried installing R2010b and got the same problem, never prompted for the Symbolic Link option.

Many thanks."
