With a new production of Frankenstein opened at The National Theatre directed by Danny Boyle - Radio 4 presents a reading by
Emilia Fox of the only other finished work of fiction by the celebrated author of Frankenstein - Mary Shelley.

[â€¦]Mary Shelley's publisher father, known for his own subversive books -not only refused to publish Mathilda when she sent it to
him early in 1820, he also refused to return her only copy of the manuscript, calling it 'disgusting and detestable'. The work
was never published in her lifetime and was only brought to light in the early 1950's when it was unearthed in the
Bodleian Library, Oxford.

In our own times the novella doesn't seem nearly so shocking - but her father's attempted suppression is perhaps understandable:
unlike Frankenstein, written a year earlier, Mathilda uses fantasy to study a far more personal reality. As she lies on her
deathbed, the narrator tells her story. [â€¦]

Yet, despite characters clearly based on herself, her father, and her husband, the narrator lifts the story beyond
autobiographical resonance into something more transcendent: a passionate tale of a brave woman's search for love, atonement,
and redemption.

From her deathbed in an isolated country cottage, Mathilda, a young gentlewoman with a tragic past, sets out to tell her
closest friend and the wider public the secret behind her long depression and self imposed seclusion.....
