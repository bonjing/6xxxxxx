,UAofE,2011-04-27T17:51Z,There is no science in the bible. It was a collection of stories made up by some jewish goat herders around 300AD.

[V],joshua13,2011-04-27T21:10Z,"wether you believe anything in it or not, you ought to know what you are talking about when you attack something
goat herders? read some history.
300ad?  the whole old testament was translated to greek about 200BC (google Septuagint) - and that's not the earliest provable date.
google  the dead sea scrolls. google textual criticism. read about the dating of both old and 
new testament documents. read about palestinian archaeology and the bible. be a jerk if you like but be an educated jerk instead of a stupid one."

,sonofdog,2011-04-28T11:42Z,"Not so much fiction as theocratical propaganda with embelishments. Old testement is jewish, new testement Roman. Both religions steal stories from other religions (ie The old testement is jewish but stolen by the Roman Christians to make their book bigger). It was the politics of its time and about as truthful as politicians today. They put their spin on real events but also fabricate the truth to their fashion. Some even believe they are right, like Hitler or zionists. We can disagree but such people often refuse to listen or even agree to be disagreed with. Such is the nature of religion."
,rra137,2011-04-28T18:05Z,"Belief in any religion is like betting. For my part I bet it is true, we I am dead I will know whether it is true. If it is wrong then I won't realise. If I am wrong then many people have done the same wrong bet as me lol.
For my part I trust witnesses who accepted torture, humiliation and death rather than accepting to give up their belief."
,UAofE,2011-04-30T03:36Z,"rra137, you should believe that I am God. You must give me your money or I will eternally damn you to hell.

That bet is the same as all other religions, it has an equal chance of being right or wrong. But according to your logic you should bet that I AM god, because there is a risk I could actually damn you to hell if you're wrong."
