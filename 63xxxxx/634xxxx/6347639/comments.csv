can you seed your murdoch mysteries season 1 torrent? i am stuck at 76%. i am getting about 2kbps download speed since two days from 1 or occasional 2-3 seeds."
[T],ajaxen94,2011-04-28T17:51Z,ive started seeding it again only 2 seeds at the moment think i'm one of them hope that helps abj642
[T],ajaxen94,2011-04-28T17:58Z,abj642 my upload speed at the moment is only30kb/s and its shared with sharpes eagle i dont think my isp likes me uploading so it'll probably take a while my isp won't stop me
