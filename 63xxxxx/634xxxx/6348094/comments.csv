,Shantanab,2011-04-30T00:22Z,"Yeah, I hate Monarchy too... a bunch of nobodies who get to sit and enjoy the luxurious life just because their ancestors were fucked by his Majesty! Royal bloodline is a joke..."
,Dramat,2011-04-30T01:54Z,"Fucking propaganda of people whom have NO IDEA what hard work is. I dont give a fuck about their wedding, funeral or whatever."

,cushtyken,2011-05-01T00:32Z,"2 people got marrieed,  GREAT.
Why do you HOMO's feel the need to be so negative ?     Oh and BTW Mister Quebec, you aint never been to France, so how does that make you French ?    You knob !
live and let live, except French wannabee's.
Who would want to be french anyway ?
I await your response, as thats all you are allowed, in fact I demand it, so now you must do as I command."
,Vamsay,2011-05-01T17:38Z,"It's just a wedding between two human beings. There is nothing to be discussed about or there is nothing they have done to the society to keep thinking about. Their ancestors followed the principle of divide and rule and took over much of worlds property. I mean who in the world would care or think about the wedding if he is born in a middle class family. Anyways in the end, I am happy for both of them but least interested."
,k3rc4,2011-05-01T18:47Z,i dont care about monarchy weddings but i dont dislike their funerals ;)
,jspyder24,2011-05-01T22:33Z,"America would go mad if the government ask us to pay for a family 2 ""represent"" the nation by living a luxurious life. Have multiple castle that they live in depending on the season and whenever bored they perform ""royal visits"". At least America's queen, Oprah Winfrey worked her arse off for every brick that build her castle in California. 
How is a family living a billionaires lifestyle for FREE good 4 the nation and its subjects? That have produced no art, made no contributions to science. They receive the BEST education, but do not pursue careers. What do they do on a daily basis? Im really curious. They are not even encouraged 2 get jobs. Princess Diana went to fucking Africa to help the children who lost limbs from land mines because she was bored to tears living in London. I think the Royals should get jobs and not think they ARE doing something because they have to entertain foreign dignitaries, or host dinners, or host charities. That is what the Prime Minister's wife is for!"
,janusgate,2011-05-12T05:02Z,"Personally, I think it's bullshit....all of it.. Who the FUCK CARES about william and kate? To be quite honest I think kate will probably be fucking good ol' Willy in the arse, I GUARANTEE william would take one in the ass, probably suck a cock to...I could care less about a fucking Monarchy, doesn't really matter because we will probably ALL be dead soon from these crooked as fucking politicians, monarch's, whatever they wanna call themselves.. it's all bullshit, just plain fucking bullshit. Dump Osama off a boat?.....WHAT?!!??!?!?!?!?!?! BRING THAT MOTHERFUCKER TO AMERICA, TIE HIM TO A FUCKING COCKPIT AND RUN HIS ASS INTO A BUILDING.. after torturing him first of course.. everyone is so full of shit..to me, it just makes ABSOLUTELY no sense they would just drop him into the water...I mean....WHAT!?!?!?!?...Personally, I am christian, and I think if he WAS dead, they should have let him have a burial of his religion..even though he was evil, he believed in a certain faith, and I can understand th....wait.....what the fuck am I talking about...FUCK HIM!! anyway, the William and ""Kate"" thing...fuck them, fuck a monarchy, fuck you guys if you don't like this comment, fuck everyone.. :)"
,janusgate,2011-05-12T05:04Z,and the sickest thing is I am actually about to watch this movie out of sheer boredom...
,beoch_420,2011-05-28T06:14Z,can u ppl quit fn bitchin and rate this plz... oh wait its PB already know its good shit... the rest of u need to get lives and others need to learn their geography cause u dont have to be from france to be french. QUEBEC IS FRENCH AS WELL!!!!!! in fact im pretty sure all of montreal is. 
,grumpyg,2011-05-30T09:28Z,For starters 24 million watched the wedding on TV worldwide. BOTH William and Kate work hard for a living. Many of the Royal family work damned hard to promote the UK worldwide. The Royal Family earn millions in tourist revenue for the UK. If you don't like the Royal Family then DON'T FUCKING DOWNOAD.
,givazo,2011-06-04T08:00Z,And what about the quality ? A/V?
