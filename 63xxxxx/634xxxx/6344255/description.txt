A-Ha - Ending On A High Note - Final Concert 2011

It came to an end on 4 December 2010 when Norway's capital city hosted a-ha's final show.
Exactly nine months earlier, on 4 March, A-Ha had set out on their Farewell Tour, billed as 'Ending On A High Note'.
The band had played South and North America, Europe and Asia. Even though farewells had already been said in
their home countries, the audience at Oslo's Spektrum included fans from England, India, Mexico, South Korea,
the USA, Spain, Germany, Canada, Italy every place where a-ha had touched people.
Sub-zero temperatures weren't going to keep anyone away. Not everyone could make it to Oslo to see the final
show from the band that had found worldwide success in 1985.
Thankfully, cameras were there to capture A-Ha as they bowed out at the end of 2010.
