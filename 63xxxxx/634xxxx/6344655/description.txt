A complete retard decided to post this CD in .mv format which also required CUEsplitter and it basically made it the stupidest upload on earth for 80% of people, so I re-encoded them to mp3 so that the average person can EASILY put them on his or her iPod.

Here's a link to the dumb fuck's upload: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4887335/Paganini_-_24__Caprices_For_Violin_%28David_Garrett%29

Fucking moron. 


I've re-encoded them to VBR of the highest quality in Audacity. If you want constant bitrate, go fucking convert them yourself.
