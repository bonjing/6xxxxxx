Video:Own
Audio:Own/Quagmire thanks

Okay here we go with our version of madeas cam video was very very nice didn't need much just some color adjustment was a little dark and a little dull so added it in dub

rgb slight sharpen crop deinterlace and came out very nice no movement issues you might see an occasioall 1 persons head walkng through but only for a second.

On to audio our audio was okay dropped it in adobe removed slight hiss and lowered bass some so vocals are more clear but almost any comedic scene people were laughing way to loud so what i did was took about a good 20 to 30 minutes from the quagmire audio and muxed it in with our audio

there are still people laughing nothing ican do about that but it's very audible also i used the ending credits off the quagmire cam so thanks again,so this is complete cam from opening sequence to the very last ending credit.

All in all very watchable cam as always check out sample before d/l and enjoy.
