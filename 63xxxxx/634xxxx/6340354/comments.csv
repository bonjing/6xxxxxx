,poonjabb,2011-04-24T11:27Z,why is this so popular it's not new and shit??
,xBSAACHRIS434x,2011-04-24T15:21Z,"Because Natalie Portman is in it. I don't get it either, I mean her best role is Padme in the Star Wars Trilogy, but for some reason after Black Swan everyone is all about her? I thought Black Swan sucked but to each is own."

,Pillesnoppen,2011-04-25T01:32Z,"@xBSAACHRIS434x How about V for Vendetta, Leon or Garden State? She's an absolutely amazing actress and deserves to be reckoned as such. She's not just a fling because of Black Swan. Far from it. "
,guanche07,2011-04-25T15:54Z,"She's a good actress and she is gorgeous!!!! ;)))

That's why, keep it simple!!! lol."
,orinvee,2011-04-26T06:11Z,"""Leon"" AKA ""The Professional"" was a great movie and a great start for Ms. Portman but she was only 13 then. Great cast including Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Danny Aiello. Forget the IMDB rating of 8.6...this movie was easily a 10! Truly a classic by writer/director Luc Besson.

As far as ""The Other Woman"", I dunno but am willing to give it a try.

As far as ""Black Swan"", it was a DUD, with capital letters.

But that's Hollyweird for ya."
