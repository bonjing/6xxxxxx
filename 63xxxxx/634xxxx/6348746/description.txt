A love story between an 18-year-old girl named SofÃ®, cursed by a witch into an old woman's body, and a magician named Hauru. Under the curse, SofÃ® sets out to seek her fortune, which takes her to Hauru's strange moving castle. In the castle, Sophie meets Hauru's fire demon, named KarishifÃ¢. Seeing that she is under a curse, the demon makes a deal with Sophie--if she breaks the contract he is under with Hauru, then KarushifÃ¢ will lift the curse that Sophie is under, and she will return to her 18-year-old shape.
