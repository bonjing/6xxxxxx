,coolname,2011-06-08T03:47Z,"I know i'm not all that good on the computer but mp4 with 6 channel audio is NOT compatible with xbox for streaming. I spent 2 days googling it and unless i pay 4 some fucking converter, i get unsupported code. even after changing the file type to avi. This really pissed me off. other than that it looks good on my little computer screen, but will not stream & not convert W/vso!"
,coolname,2011-06-08T04:45Z,"And I'm not hating, I really appreciate the work that went into the upload. The quality looks great, I'm just trying to figure out what I'm missing here. I'm running wmp11, wxp pro, i have divx to dvd converter, free dvd creator, xenonmkv, and this just won't stream!! Any secrets? Wtf am I doing wrong here, and I've searched the shit outta it. Any good free ware converters?"

,jenotron,2011-06-25T06:27Z,"it wont play on PS3. you don't get a incompatible file notice, it just stays fixed on 0:00. Played it on PC and the quality it very poor for a 1GB file and such a short film."
