Theres is NO comparisament to a DVD9, probably because of the the three language track options taking up a major part of this DVD. The picture is dull and dark, and gets blurry when it enlarges on bigger screens.

Sorry to say this, since I always thought of Lindoffs as a potential skull-man. I hope and believe this is a one-time-bad-offer from Lindoffs.

Here is a VLC-screencap for your own judgement, if you for instance just wanna look at this movie on a small screen:

,Mutegrill,2011-07-23T09:48Z,"Need to revise my previous comment a bit:

It seems Lindoffs registered on piratebay in 2011. His nick is confusingly similar to Lindoff41, whoÂ´s been around since 2007.

Consciously wanting to use Lindoff41:s success, or not: beware of Lindoffs uploads, and do not blame Lindoff41 in the case of this dudeÂ´s bad uploads.

This torrent is still a bad torrent, quality wise...
