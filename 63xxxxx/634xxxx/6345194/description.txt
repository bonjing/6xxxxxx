Contains some oriental subs, but they don't interfere with the movie. It was ripped from Tudou (Think thats how they spelled it) and is in wide screen format, the subs are in the black area and are non-intrusive. Sound stays in sync unlike the other versions online that i've seen tonight. Reupped for the reason the other 1080 and 720 dpi versions aren't seeded very well and it was quicker to download it at 50kbs elsewhere as apposed to the 1.5 - 2.5 kbs i was getting from their torrents.
