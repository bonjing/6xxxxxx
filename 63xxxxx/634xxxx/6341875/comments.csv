I have no idea if the trackers I used even work. I am fully vested in DHT and Peer Exchange, so this torrent WILL WORK! Please seed though, as my upstream bandwidth is VERY low."
,turdcrow,2011-05-08T19:02Z,"Why are people such pitiful bandwidth hogs? 15 people have downloaded this torrent, and there is currently 1 seed: me. At one time there were 6 seeds. Why won't anyone seed this? It's such a nice performance!"
,turdcrow,2011-08-11T02:17Z,"OK, I'm tired of the hit and run. I'm not seeding this anymore so that you can download it and delete it. I have uploaded 9 copies worth of data for this torrent and there are no other seeds that I can see. Obviously no one cares about this content besides myself, so I'm not going to waste my bandwidth anymore."
,moon-cat,2012-03-09T06:25Z,"Hi, I just joined this, I would *really* appreciate it if you would restore this torrent... I promise I will seed it every time my computer is awake.  I've wanted to see this again for 30 years!"
