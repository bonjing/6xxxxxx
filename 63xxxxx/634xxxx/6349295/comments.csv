,daltron101,2011-04-29T18:10Z,does this include a texture pack like your previous torrent?
,mare89pzs,2011-04-29T19:42Z,"No, because mc patcher messup with some files and than achievements don't work like they should ... sorry"
,crazy_horse1989,2011-05-01T16:46Z,"Hmm... Weird, every time I try to download, it gives me a ""No input file specified"" error. I don't know why is that, but am I the only one getting that error?"
,Ramzes_,2011-05-01T19:28Z,"It does give an error, but you should use ""MAGNET LINK"", it should open with your torrent client."
,mare89pzs,2011-05-01T23:04Z,"I am sorry because of that , I don't know why is that happening..."
,crazy_horse1989,2011-05-02T20:33Z,"Zan's Minimap Mod, that I knew from your 1.4 mod release, but SP commands and the pistons? They are absolutely brilliant! Thanks for the torrent, you did a great job!! "

,artiti,2011-05-04T00:04Z,I would prefer releases without mods (or only the minimap one)
,mare89pzs,2011-05-04T01:44Z,"@artiti

You can turn of mods, read instructions on  minecraft forum ... "
,mare89pzs,2011-05-04T22:09Z,"@mrmine50078

I don't have that any more... If You want You can disable/delete mods in game or download 1.4_01  from my list and just force update it to latest version without mods ....

@ALL

Stop spaming with free minecraft acc-s You will never get it free
If You love game , buy it ...

,unicron_tpb,2011-05-07T02:09Z,"... but Ramzes_ is right- I clicked the MAGNET LINK and it works...

dont even know what the hell that is but it worked"
,agent_washington,2011-05-07T20:58Z,why does the launcher says i need to have an accaunt?
,mare89pzs,2011-05-07T21:26Z,"@agent_washingto

If you trying to login thats why... just click login and play offline, don't input anything in blank fields...

start game with ""minecraft.jar"""
,TobiaSSss,2011-05-07T22:02Z,Can u play lan? with hamachi and tunngle?
,daltron101,2011-05-08T01:11Z,"Something is wrong with the ""Download"" button... Must be a broken link. Ill try again soon"
,mare89pzs,2011-05-08T12:33Z,"@TobiaSSss 

I think You can... I played on cracked servers, so why not to play with hamachi ... :P

@daltron101

click magnet link, they says that works, I don't know why download button don't work... :/"
,TobiaSSss,2011-05-08T16:31Z,"@mare89pzs 
But how? and can i make my own lan server without minecraft server launcher?"
,mare89pzs,2011-05-09T00:07Z,"search on google or youtube, and You can't create server without launcher ..."
,daltron101,2011-05-16T08:07Z,"I just bought the game, but to make things easier, I simply copied the Bin folder from yours and replaced the default one in the .jar file of the one I DLed off the website. I know very little about modding on MC, so doing this saved me a TON of time. Zan's minimap is a must, and the SP commands are beasty."
,Reaper24,2011-05-17T18:32Z,Won't work. It tells me to play online once to play offline after I login with a random username.
,Reaper24,2011-05-17T18:38Z,"Never mind, I made a silly mistake. It works now."
,leeds101,2011-05-18T18:15Z,no input file specified. :(
,mare89pzs,2011-05-18T20:49Z,"click magnet link and download the game ... download button don't works, don't know why ..."
