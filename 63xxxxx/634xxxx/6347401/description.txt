T-Bone Walker
T-Bone Blues
The Essential Recordings (2000)



Modern electric blues guitar can be traced directly back to this Texas-born pioneer, who began amplifying his sumptuous lead lines for public consumption circa 1940 and thus initiated a revolution so total that its tremors are still being felt today.

Few major postwar blues guitarists come to mind that don't owe T-Bone Walker an unpayable debt of gratitude. B.B. King has long cited him as a primary influence, marveling at Walker's penchant for holding the body of his guitar outward while he played it. Gatemouth Brown, Pee Wee Crayton, Goree Carter, Pete Mayes, and a wealth of other prominent Texas-bred axemen came stylistically right out of Walker during the late '40s and early '50s. Walker's nephew, guitarist R.S. Rankin, went so far as to bill himself as T-Bone Walker, Jr. for a 1962 single on Dot, "Midnight Bells Are Ringing" (with his uncle's complete blessing, of course; the two had worked up a father-and-son-type act long before that).

Another package of T-Bone's Black & White and early Capitol sides from 1942 to 1947 aboard. This features a generous 22 sides, starting with 1942's "I Got a Break" with Freddy Slack and finishing up with 1947's "Vacation Blues." In between are loads of that classic guitar and smooth vocals by one of the all-time greats of the blues, including "They Call It Stormy Monday" and "T-Bone Shuffle." Hard to say no to a package like this.
