,OhhAhh,2011-05-02T18:07Z,"This does work, you just don't know how to read and install it correctly.

Thanks for this, excellent stuff!"

@TheShadowZ:
Listen to OhhAhh:
Read well!
Just do what i'm saying, maybe run it in administrator mode (vista/7).

,miss_cunt,2011-05-05T03:23Z,This is the third one I've tried. My data execution prevention won't allow this to run. It keeps closing it. I've tried to disable DEP for this program but it won't let me. I've tried to run in Administrator mode... nothing. This is ridiculous and I hate how Windows assumes it knows what's best for my computer. Any ideas on what I'm supposed to do?

I don't know the problem..
I can't do anything for you now!
Sorry!
