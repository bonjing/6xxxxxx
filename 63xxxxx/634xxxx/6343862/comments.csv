 What a total waste of time downloading."
,blammer,2011-05-27T16:33Z,"@ust2,  Before you shout check google. Then you understand how stupid you look, not knowing the best lossless format in the world. Best way to play is Foobar2000 combined with WASAPI plugin for the most direct way. Wasapi bypasses all drivers.  PCM to flac = 50% smaller without any loss of info. You can even convert it back to wav. Yeah how feels that UST2? pretty stupid right?"
