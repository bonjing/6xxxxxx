Notes:

 - Even though encoded from DVD, it seems that the DVD was actually a transfer from videotape, not film. Thus:
		- The quality is somewhat less than standard DVD. It's still watchable and enjoyable of course.
		- The audio is also much louder in the second part (even though I normalized both.)
		- The black framing rectangle in the second part is quite a few degrees off-level.
   So, not my fault. :^)

 - The IMDB entry lists the year of release as 1986, but it was actually 1985.

 - The C.K. (Polish) and H.M. (English) in the title (roughly) translates to the abbreviation for "Imperial and Royal" [Army] as the Austro-Hungarian empire at the time consisted of Hungary which had a king and Austria which had an emperor (and the leader of the empire was both.) This isn't explained on the IMDB entry anywhere I could find.

 - To use the subtitles, simply extract the .SUB file from the .RAR archive into the same folder. A free app. that will extract .RAR archives is 7-Zip from http://www.7-zip.org/
 
 - I seed using "Initial Seeding" which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for up to several days until there are enough other seeds.
 
 - This is a long movie; it will take nearly two days to complete the initial seeding so please BE PATIENT.

 - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) At 1.2GB if leechers let the torrent die I won't be able to fix it. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to at least 101%, no torrent would ever die.
