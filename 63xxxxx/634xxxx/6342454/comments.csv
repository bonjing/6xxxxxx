,KarpoofdaJulii,2011-04-26T15:40Z,"There's a glitch around the 14:07 mark. Not being a whiner but usually when people download a 720p rip its for the clarity of picture.

,e271828183,2011-04-27T06:24Z,"For those of you unfamiliar with the books, this is made of win and awesome. Download it. You want it. You don't know it yet, but you do. 

I am sooo buying this series on DVD when it comes out. Even if I've watched it ten times by then. "
,Superflow,2011-04-28T00:01Z,"@e271828183
Downloading the highres version and then buying the DVD makes no sense."
,ptae,2011-04-28T00:23Z,"I've been looking forward to this episode. Seed people, thx."
,fallout11,2011-04-28T00:56Z,"Another great episode, I will not spoil it further.
Thanks EZTV!"
,inihccec,2011-04-28T09:57Z,"What client software are ppl downloading on. I get the ""Rejected by tracker - requested download is not authorised for use with this tracker"" msg."
,tfizz,2011-04-29T05:16Z,"I am not going to lie.  I rarely seed shit after I get done downloading it.  If I try to upload more than about 15 kbs while downloading, my DL speed goes to shit.  And honestly, I have a 2 Mbit upload, which means, maxed out, I am only sending out about 220 kbps....... If i had a blazing fast upload, I would seed.

The biggest thing for me is uploading SLOWS down my wireless network.  I use a PS3 with netflix and many other computers on my wireless.  If uploading didn't slow my down speed, I would seed all day, even at a slow 2mbit.  

And  LOL @ people bitching about getting 700 kbs down.  What... you whinning that you maybe have to wait 30-45 min for your download.  Fuck, I barely get 700 kbs on a single torrent ever, and I have 20 Mbit down..... I NEVER see over 1.5 mbs"
,tfizz,2011-04-29T05:19Z,"I just would like to add.  Are we seriously getting to a point in society where people are actually bitching and whinning about having to wait an hour for a HIGH DEFINITION download to finish....

Oh by the way, we are STEALING this.  Next time you come on TPB to bitch in ANY torrent thread, remember... WE ARE STEALING.  THIS IS FREE.  As in, because of EZTV and TPB and MANY OTHERS, I do NOT have to pay 50 bucks a month for cable television!"
,pbxpb,2011-04-29T07:36Z,"awesome quality though its not 1080 p still great 
A=10
V=10
great job thanks a million 
and people this took me 30 hrs to download too long even if my speed is only 50 kbps so seed future episodes please i will seed for a month atleast"
,pbxpb,2011-04-29T07:39Z,this episode is good extremly faithful to the book looking forward to more lesbian scenes :D the chick who plays the slave to princess targaryen is super hot in episode 2 !!!!
,Superflow,2011-04-29T23:49Z,"@tfizz
We are not stealing anything, we are copying. Don't be a moron like the Hollywood mafia."
,Monteverde13,2011-05-01T00:17Z,Why voice audio layer does not load?
,shift125,2011-05-01T01:07Z,"Great Quality EZTV!!

,mw2gam3r,2011-07-06T14:30Z,All episodes (except 1) are broken. i tried different players (Gom/KM/BS). they all go crazy and then freeze. KM closes it self down. ive got the same settings as always. my computer does not suck so there's clearly something wrong with your torrents...
,MrKingJames,2011-07-14T18:59Z,"3,675 total bit rate if anyone is wondering, and it looks beautiful on my 720p TV
