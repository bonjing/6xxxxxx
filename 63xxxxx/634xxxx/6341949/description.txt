The movie draws loosely from historical events from the early eighteenth century, when Jud SÃ¼ss Oppenheimer, financial advisor to the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg, was subjected to a sensational trial and gruesome execution. The film depicts SÃ¼ss as a figure of cynical cunning and malign will, a sexual predator sowing corruption everywhere; his promotion of Jewish emancipation brings Christian WÃ¼rttemberg to the brink of moral and social ruination. That these qualities are conveyed through Ferdinand Marian's stunningly charismatic performance as SÃ¼ss suggests something of the film's disturbing power even as it acknowledges Jewish misery, Jud SÃ¼ss argues for still more lethal, pitiless solutions to the Jewish question. A key historical document of the twentieth century, Jud SÃ¼ss remains a deeply unsettling cinematic experience. Directed by Veit Harlan; music by Wolfgang Zeller; featuring Ferdinand Marian, Werner Krauss, Heinrich George, and Kristina SÃ¶derbaum.
