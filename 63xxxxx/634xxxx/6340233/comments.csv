[V],twentyforty,2011-04-24T08:23Z,"Thank you.

@to all who can and want to help:

 If you want to help me buy a new router and get back up to speed on ALL the show you love then please consider donating some cash to the cause as I CANNOT afford to buy it myself. My long term fans know how much I have to live on and it is simply impossible for me to purchase a new router without help from fans/friends. I am tied into buying it from my ISP - a replacement of any kind will not work as my ISP has a handshake built-in to the router and will cut me off completely if I don't use their router. I ask all my fans/friends to please help me raise this cash. I have no idea how long my old router (originally provided by my ISP) will continue to work so time is critical here. Please e-mail me at twentyforty1@gmail.com and help me come up with the cash to get back to full upping strength. For those who are willing to help with cash, my thanks in advance. For ALL well wishers, while I appreciate your sentiment and without being harsh - words will not help."

,dark_defender,2011-04-24T11:45Z,"@all: Please him this man with whatever amount you can. Think of it as your debt paid to this man for all you have taken from him. Not just movies & TV shows but most importantly, his time.

It's very easy to transfer. Conact him at twentyforty1@gmail.com for details.

Remember, no amount is small."

,prash1989,2011-04-27T03:48Z,dear twenty forty humble request plz seed Equilibrium.2002.BluRay.480p.H264 . i m stuck at 90 percent plz seed for only 1 hour
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-27T10:01Z,"@prash1989
you sir are on your own.  Best try for a different Equilibrium torrent.  Even at the best of times, twentyforty cannot keep his seeds alive--the ones that stay alive do so at the behest of loyal fans whose computers are on some of the time, and typically upload at abysmally slow rates.

And as long as we are making requests of said fans, I have one of my own of twentyforty's torrents:
The.40.Year.Old.Virgin.Who.Knocked.Up.Sarah.Marshall.and.Felt.Superbad.About.It.2010.272p.H264.mp4
Am stuck at 26% of smallish 249 MB.

Yeah I know, I should practice what I preach.  Shutting up now!"
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-27T10:11Z,!!
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-28T09:32Z,"@azrielle & @prash1989: I found both (luckily) on external USB HDD and seeded both. 4 people have finished Equilibrum (4-6 seeders now), but azrielle, let me know do you have it now or not, cause I was sleeping and see 2 seeds right now but do not know anything else."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-28T13:52Z,Got it!  Just noticed.  Kind of dazed/dozed off for last couple of hours.  Thank you--wasn't expecting that at all. :)
