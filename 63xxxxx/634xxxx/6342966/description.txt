LGnPST v 1.2 and LGdownload.  Both are for flashing phones.  Use the LGnPST for newer phones, and the LGdownload for the older ones.  I have included the LG usb drivers and a few links for info.

I will answer questions as I can but if you brick your phone, I cannot be responsible.  In other words sorry no new phone.

Just remember:
Fully charge the phoen first
Read read read and then read some more


It's not brain surgery it's just another "CAAACH of the day"

ENJOY!! and please seed I have a slow connection.
