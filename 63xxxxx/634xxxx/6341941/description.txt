These are the first 3 volumes from the 97x green room. There are some great acoustic performances here from some of todays best rock bands.

Format: MP3
Bitrate: 320kbps
Volumes 1, 2, 3

These are not edited in anyway and have a raw sound to them. I have included the hidden tracks not listed on the cd cover including the rare acoustic cover of Alice in Chains "Nutshell" performed by Shinedown and Seether.



As always Enjoy, Comment and Seed!
