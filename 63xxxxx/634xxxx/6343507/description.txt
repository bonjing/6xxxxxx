Ripped from the new live stream from Glenn Beck's web site. I have edited out the  music played during the commercial breaks.

NOTES: Some goofball at Mercury played commercials too long again coming back from the first commercial break each hour.  I put the scratch in to indicate, as usual.

Also, this may be my last upload for 2 weeks.  I definitely will be out of country for a couple of weeks, but will try to cap and edit the web broadcast.  Again, I do this for myself so I can listen at my convenience.  If I am able to do this while out, I will upload.  Just FYI...
