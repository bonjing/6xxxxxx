Game infos

OMSI is a realistic omnibus simulator for home use. You are the driver and
your job is to drive the bus and the passengers safely and on time through
the surrounding traffic

Great effort has been made to recreate the vehicles as realistic as
possible. So concerning handling and operation, the buses resemble their
real-life counterparts to a very high degree. Especially functions like the
gearbox control which simulates every detail of the original, the physical
simulation of the air system, the fully working IBIS (Integrated Board
Information System) and the extensive soundset (about 100 single sounds per
vehicle) create a high level of realism. Furthermore, the realistic and
detailed scenery with dense traffic and animated objects contributes to the
"omnibus experience" for everyone
