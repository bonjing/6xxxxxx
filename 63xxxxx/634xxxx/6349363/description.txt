A Feast For Crows [Chaptered][Unb]- George R.R. Martin

Martinâ€™s manuscript of A Feast For Crows was so long that his publisher relegated half the chapters to a fifth book, A Dance with Dragons. With only half the storylines and characters present from A Storm of Swords (2000), Feast For Crows should seem thinâ€”but itâ€™s so rich with characters, plot twists, and settings that a few critics thought the novel one of the best in the fantasy genre. Martin renders his charactersâ€”would-be queens, outlaws, priests, squires, ladies, and foolsâ€”with unusual depth and moral complexity, while placing their personal dramas within the epic sweep of lands lost and won. Though the book could feasibly stand alone, readers will reap greater rewards by starting with the first of the series, A Game of Thrones.
