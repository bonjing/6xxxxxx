,rduke15,2011-07-15T16:57Z,"What is this shit? It is not a ""fake"" as others commented, but it is so blurred that it is completely useless and unwatchable. To achieve a picture so incredibly out-of-focus, it must have been filmed in a theater with a camera set on macro or something."

,malanzirotti,2011-09-02T20:29Z,"Note that the video duration is given as either 52 min (under ""General"") or 39 min (under ""Video""). Either way would be incorrect because the film actually lasts 104 min (see wiki). My conclusion is that this torrent should not be trusted as genuine."
