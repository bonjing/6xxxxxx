Plot:  

In this must-see comedy hit, two carefree pals travelling through Alabama are mistakenly arrested and charged with murder. Fortunately, one of them has a lawyer friend in the family - Vincent Gambini (Joe Pesci), a former auto mechanic from Brooklyn who has never been in court - or in Alabama. When cousin Vinny arrives with his leather-clad girlfriend (Marisa Tomei in her Oscar-winning Supporting Actress performance) to handle his first case, it's a real shock - for him and the Deep South!
