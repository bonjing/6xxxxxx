        January, 1942. The Japanese war machine thunders across  South
        East Asia. In its path, on  the island of New Britain, lies  a
        tiny Catholic  mission station,  Vunapope. Here  a handful  of
        Australian  nurses   take  refuge   with  wounded   Australian
        soldiers.

        Sisters  of  War  is  inspired  by  the  true  story  of   two
        extraordinary  Australian  women,  Lorna  Whyte,  (now   Lorna
        Johnston)  an  army  nurse  and  Sister  Berenice  Twohill,  a
        Catholic nun from country New South Wales who was stationed at
        Vunapope. Although they were  two very different women,  their
        friendship would  survive the  perilous events  that followed.
        Sisters of War is adapted from wartime diaries and  interviews
        with Lorna,  Sister Berenice  and others  who witnessed  these
        events.  The  story of  their  captivity, their  extraordinary
        courage and their will to prevail has never been told.
