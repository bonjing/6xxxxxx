[T],liluser,2011-05-01T12:09Z,"if you would have read the post properly..

Default windows language ENGLISH/UK
please change to your own language when installing.
you can also use âRegional and Language Optionsâ after if need
be in Control panel."
,trickabounce,2011-05-02T00:45Z,would this be 86x or  64?
[T],liluser,2011-05-02T10:29Z,"sp3 only came out as 32bit..

,Stanaford,2011-05-04T00:25Z,"Installed on my grandfathers laptop. Everything is going fine except for one little issue. He has a built in wireless card, but it's not recognizing it and so we cannot connect to my desktops wireless router. Please help liluser or anyone else that may have any further information. Other than that... thanks."

If you have xp installed already your advised to backup
your drivers first before install. example using driver genius.
as only ""MassStorage 11.01 txt mode (sata + raid)""
and ""basic xp drivers"" are on this cd-r disk"
,Stanaford,2011-05-04T01:13Z,"I know. The problem is that I tried installing osx86 and it failed, and the hard drive was wiped of every OS and such. All I had to work with was the BIOS and the CD drive."
,Stanaford,2011-05-04T02:19Z,Is there any possible fix?
[T],liluser,2011-05-04T10:32Z,"@ Stanaford  maybe get driver genius and get the drivers needed.. or look them up online..
or get my march DVD version with driverpacks intergrated.. click on my name for dvd version.."
,Stanaford,2011-05-05T02:44Z,Alright i'll try to get your march package seeing as its probably easier. I installed the driver for his exact toshiba model on a flash drive and installed it on his computer and no cigar. I rebooted and still nothing.
,Leo_Koneval,2011-05-08T02:14Z,"Great download! Everything worked on the first go. The only trouble I had was finding the drivers again, and they keyboard ""@"" mixed up with the """""" although a quick online search gave me the solution. And just a head up for those using the US keyboard, the only thing that fixed the keyboard issue was to delete the UK option in ""Regional and Language"" under the Language tab in the Advanced menu. And leave only the US language option. Thanks Liluser, you are the man!"
,rmkz,2011-05-19T04:30Z,"thanks liluser, it is great. what do you mean with sata raid? it is mean i can install on laptop with sata hdd? thanks"
