    Tony and the Team help investigate the Saxon roots of      
    Bamburgh Castle, high on rocky cliffs in Northumberland   
    above the vast North Sea beach and with the magical      
    island of Lindisfarne visible in the distance.            
                                                               
    It's been a seat of power for thousands of years and      
    has long held the attention of archaeologists. The Team  
    are at Bamburgh to help the Bamburgh Research Project,    
    which for a decade and a half has been digging through     
    1000 years of history to uncover the Saxon roots of       
    this fortress.                                           
                                                              
    Bamburgh was once home to the 'Bernician Kings', Anglo     
    Saxon overlords who ruled great swathes of Britain.       
    Could there be a unique stone-built hall under the       
    carefully manicured lawns of today's castle?              
                                                               
    As the Team hear stories of brutal death and financial    
    wealth, and examine finds of gold jewellery and stone    
    thrones, Phil and the diggers edge closer to a            
    tantalising discovery.

    Well Channel 4  are at it again, they have labelled        
    this Series 19 Episode 1, and also as a special, guess    
    they like to confuse folks, as we explained before, we   
    are following their listings because however good sites   
    like imdb and other sites are they are NOT an official     
    source so we can only go by what the broadcaster lists    
    at the time, changing the season and ep number would     
    make our lives easier, but once again it's not what the   
    broadcaster has listed at present, that could change of    
    course at a later date but that's not down to us.

    We've been following things the last couple of weeks     
    and we have a question to ask, why are certain uk         
    groups doing pdtv releases of shows that aired in high     
    definition on Channel 4 HD, we could understand it,if     
    the source was encrypted, as better a lower quality      
    release than no release at all, we had do it for a        
    while, but when there is a FTA High Definition source      
    available, yes we know not all shows are actual high      
    definition, but can think of quite a few instances where 
    the show has been broadcast in HD and you have cappers    
    that can get it, so why release pdtv's?
