On the Classics Arts Showcase TV channel I recently saw a ballet number from the 

movie The Tales of Hoffmann 1951. It was a dance number with song by Moira Shearer

called Ophelia's Song. It looked interesting so I downloaded the video to have a

look.

It was interesting to me but was not entirely intelligible, although it was in

English. So I searched for subtitles. They were hard to find. I finally located a

copy in a most unlikely place and downloaded them. I found trouble there. After

considerable effort I straightened them out and fitted them to the video.

The result is enclosed. I enjoyed watching the first part of this opera/ballet, but

not so much the rest. 

It appears to be a deluxe, expensive production. It seemed a shame to discard the 

efforts of my labors, so I decided to share them with others. Here it is.
