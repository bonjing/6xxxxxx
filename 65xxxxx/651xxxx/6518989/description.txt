The film centres around three female supermodels who live and work together. They belong to the international world of fashion and modelling and are top of their game artistes. Off the ramp, however, they are sexy, yet alone, in a male dominated society. When a regular fashion show goes horribly wrong, they are sucked into the nasty but irresistible underworld of Bombay. The girls have unwittingly botched up a diamond delivery to the Middle East. Their task is now cut out for them: Plan A - get into the fashion extortion business Plan B - stage India's biggest bank robbery to get the diamonds back Plan C - decamp with the loot. The girls plan to take on the Dons instead of buckling under their threats. They do this by planning India's biggest bank heist and then de-camping with the loot. The Dons have their own hierarchal manipulations - Chotte Mia (Jackie Shroff), Medium Mia (Gulshan Grover) and Bade Miya (Amitabh Bachchan). Chotte wants to be Medium, while Medium wants to be Bade and Bade has nowhere to go except to hold on. Each tries to outwit and outdo each other. They are under the impression that models have more beauty than brains and are not capable of much more than looking good. This gives the girls a fair chance of pulling the wool over their eyes using their sexiness to poach any last vestige of common sense the Dons might have had. Can the three girls see their planning and plotting bear fruit or is their master plan doomed? Can the three Dons outwit them and not get bluffed by their obvious charms?
