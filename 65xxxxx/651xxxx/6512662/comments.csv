use ImgBurn, then it will automatically turn out right"
,FDB92,2011-07-22T21:35Z,"It works with VLC Player, But when I try to compress it with DVD Shrink or DVDFab to put it on a DVD-5 it become unwatchable. What can I do to make it fit on a DVD-5 without losing quality ?"
,avd17,2011-07-24T00:45Z,"@FDB92

if u use DVDshrink, u can try to remove 1 of the audiolines and/or the menu. if ur lucky it will fit then. otherwise u have to buy a duallayerDVD or convert to a lower videoquality"

720p is 1280Ă720... NOT 720x480!!
480 IS 480i/p which is standard resolution and ""the standard"" resolution for Standard Definition (SD)...
This is a DVD-Rip, not a BluRay-Rip!
Too bad..."
