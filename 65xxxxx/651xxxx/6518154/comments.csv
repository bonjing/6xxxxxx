Search and request :)"
[V],IndexTrance,2011-07-08T12:58Z,"Forum is not the way to PM me since i'm member to many by different alias and some of these i don't even use anymore .. 

Send PM to my other accounts that's listed in the Torrent NFO folder.. Easier for me to see when you request something then streaming my commentfields .. 

And regarding to EDC Vegas sets .. Not so good audio quality on those .. I will not begin working on anything that doesn't have a decent live audio quality .. 

Will check your requests out and in the future, PM me instead! . )"
