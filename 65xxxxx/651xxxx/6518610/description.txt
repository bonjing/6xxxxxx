FreeDOS 1.1 - TEST RELEASE - RELEASE CANDIDATE
THIS IS A TEST RELEASE - THIS IS NOT THE FINAL FREEDOS 1.1 DISTRIBUTION!
PLEASE ONLY DOWNLOAD THIS VERSION IF YOU INTEND TO TEST AND PROVIDE
FEEDBACK. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A STABLE VERSION.
FreeDOS is a free DOS-compatible operating system for IBM-PC
compatible systems. FreeDOS is made of up many different, separate
programs that act as "packages" to the overall FreeDOS Project.
Right now the main use is running old games and software, but you
might encounter it on some freshly sold computers, motherboard setup
CDs, BIOS flashing diskettes, embedded hardware and other uses.
While FreeDOS itself is basically just the DOS-C kernel as created by
Pat Villani, over the years many people have added programs (often
licensed as GPL, other times as freeware, public domain or a custom
license) to form a distribution so you actually get some additional
drivers and programs to run.
What's new since 1.0 (2006):
 FreeDOS kernel 2040 (Bart Oldeman, Jeremy Davis and others. Should
  fix fat32 file corruption).
 mtcp (Michael Brutman), a suite of high-performance TCP/IP
  applications for any x86 computer.
 an initial attempt at USB controller support (Bret Johnson). So far
  only UHCI (Intel/Via USB1.1 12mbit/1.5mbit).
 new Syslinux features (see installation notes, below) including free
  CD-driver for non-emulation booted CD/ISO.
 generic PCI IDE cache/cdrom driver (Jack R. Ellis) including
  PIO/UDMA modes for (P)ATA/SATA harddisks and CD.
 new installation menu when starting from CD, intended to reduce
  amount of menus you have to respond to.
 universal BIOS backup program, see http://www.flashrom.org .
 updated memory drivers (HMA&XMS, UMB&EMS) with many thanks to
  Japheth, Jack, Michael Devore and Tom Ehlert
 4DOS 8.00 command interpreter has been added, many thanks to
  Luchezar Georgiev for updating JPSOFT's code
 installation scripts have been streamlined.
 very limited USB flash disk support (often showing up as C: )
 many new versions of many programs. Features and fixes as usual.
 ..
Removed:
 LBAcache, as UIDE now takes over read-ahead caching. Hopefully not
  only covers 586+ but also 386/486.
 CDRcache, as UIDE now takes over read-ahead caching. Hopefully not
  only covers 586+ but also 386/486.
 Unstable kernel 2039. Replaced by 2040.
Installation notes:
 the FreeDOS 1.1 distribution itself is stored as a single (ISO9660
  CD-image) file on CD.
 right now the only way to install is to boot the CD, then select
 bottom option.  this loads the entire collection of FreeDOS 1.1
 installation files in system memory.  Only now you select option 1
 (installing FreeDOS).
 Should you wish to keep things really simple, get a bootdisk and
  perform the following commands:
  1) FDISK (to create an active primary partition which should use the
  FAT16 or FAT32 filesystem)
  2) FORMAT C: (creates an empty filesystem on C:, also erases all
  previous software/data)
  3) SYS C: (writes bootsector to C: and copies kernel and shell)
  4) Whatever you'd like to do next.
Installation issues:
 due to there being an ISO on the CD, without the Memdisk/ISO method
 you'll need to boot the small diskette image and/or a bootdisk, then
 locate the CD, then mount the ISO file before continuing. General
 commands to do so:
 SHSUCDHD /F:D:\ISOLINUX\FDBOOTCD.ISO
 (or whatever your CD drive is, instead of D: )
 SHSUCDX /D:SHSU-CDH
 Then switch to the newly added drive and type SETUP
 You can copy the inner ISO to harddisk or USB flash drive if you
  like and mount it there
 Bootdisk menu currently not working
 ..
Limitations:
 Only the BASE set has been packaged, thus meaning the LiveCD
  environment is missing completely.
 If installing from USB flash drive, be careful. Your flash drive
  might show up as C: ..
 ..
TODO:
 updating ODIN directory (ready to run binaries)
 adding sources for BASE set (GPL requirements)
 adding additional sets
 adding useful programs
 creating disksets
 fixing bootdisks
 ..
