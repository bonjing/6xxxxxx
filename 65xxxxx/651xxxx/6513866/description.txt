CA ARCserve D2D is a new disk-based backup solution from CA Technologies that makes protecting and recovering your business data on both physical and virtual servers a snap. An innovative Web 2.0 interface proactively feeds you updates that help you confidently meet and manage your recovery SLAs. It is the only product that has Bare Metal Restore to dissimilar hardware and block-level infinite incremental snapshots, based on CAâ€™s patent pending I2 Technologyâ„¢. Like data deduplication, I2 Technology means that after your first full backup there is no need for additional full backups.

CA ARCserve D2D is also integrated with CA ARCserve Backup, or may be used with any backup solution for non-disruptive backups.
