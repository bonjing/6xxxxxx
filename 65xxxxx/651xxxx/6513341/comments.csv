,Slyve,2011-07-11T19:25Z,"hm, i dunno, sorry. it worked just fine for me so i have no idea what could be wrong there"
,Slyve,2011-07-11T19:36Z,"You could try the comp mode - other than that i have no idea, sorry"
,Asgfsda,2011-07-13T08:26Z,Try editing your INI file In notepad and changing the resolution to something your monitor supports.
,the_seedster,2011-08-03T21:34Z,"It's asking me for a CD Key. Anyone else with this issue? BTW, I'm running Win 7 64 bit, and I had to go into the .ini and change the screen resolution. After that it ran, but it's wanting a CD Key. "
,ClaudioKilgannon,2011-08-05T01:38Z,It's asking me for a cd key as well.
,DocPyro,2011-08-26T20:46Z,I have been looking around for an hour and still no luck in finding the problem with that Vampire.exe not working. =(
,KingMonkey57,2011-09-11T21:56Z,"Changing the resolution worked for me. If game still doesn't run, try compatibility mode.

For those who need a cd key to use here you go:
RAC2-SAL2-GAT3-RAD3-6545 "
,voraxith,2011-09-23T17:53Z,"I downloaded no problem, but no matter what I do, I cannot get the thing to run.  It keeps giving me the same error message as dalumo93.  I tried compatability, I can't find the INI file.  Any ideas?"
,NeoOrpheus,2011-09-24T02:32Z,"@voraxith

The configuration file is called, ""masquerade"". It's in the main game folder. The resolution is set to 1920x1200 and if your like me and don't quite have a HD video card; that's why it won't load up. open that configuration file with the notepad and change the resolution settings to whatever your card can handle. Also use the above CD key KingMonkey57 poseted, typing it exactly as shown. It should work then. Thanks for the CD Key KingMonkey57!! ;D"
,voraxith,2011-10-31T11:20Z,"@NeoOrpheus:  

Thanks a lot for the info.  I finally got around to checking here again today and read your comment.  It works great!  Thanks so much, to you for the help, to KingMonkey57 for the cd key, and especially to Slyve for uploading this pre-installed beauty of a game.  This really brings me back ten years.  Great work guys!  And thanks once again.  Anyone up for some multiplayer?  :)"
,Genknock,2011-11-06T21:08Z,"I cannot oppen the vampire.exe because of this message: This application has failed to start because java.dll was not found
Anyone knows how to solve this?"
,crossforsaken,2012-01-25T12:28Z,Game doesn't work and uploader doesn't give info on the .dll file that doesn't work. Bad Rep.
,Mirgu,2012-04-01T15:24Z,does it work on win 7 32bit?
,Mirgu,2012-04-02T00:03Z,i cant burn it on daemon tools
