,crysis2texturefix,2011-07-03T04:39Z,"Just looked on Orlydb, looks as though SKIDROW have released whole pack including textures, patch etc.Thanks SKIDROW.Happy Anniversary! 
If you already have patches etc this will be fine as is.
Im sure that now they have released you will get a crack only from a trusted/skulled user if your a little wary and dont mind waiting a bit more ;)"

,firefall,2011-07-03T10:02Z,"Skid said that it's not the crack's fault. It's an issue present in Crytek's patch

No solution yet :/"
,cskychen,2011-07-03T11:19Z,"Same to me, Freeze when loading game."
,crysis2texturefix,2011-07-03T12:08Z,"create a new profile eliminates all crashes for me..at least it means you get to see all they eye candy! I too had crash problem with old saves but they were done under 1.1 patch.
win 7 64 hd6950 2GB only got 2.4g quad intel processor 8gig 800mhz ram! my computer is no means a beast but runs this well, as for other crash issues try updating all soundcard drivers etc. it has been posted below apparently a problem with patch! sorry if you experience this I Didnt."
,crysis2texturefix,2011-07-03T13:02Z,"I too am now experiencing crash when reload! typical Crytek,Break as much as they give! wait for a fix from Crytek and hope crack still works."
,FakeLight,2011-07-03T15:01Z,"Ya, the crack works, but it has a bug when you try to load the game, even if you die and try to load, it will freeze and crash."
,jockepocke0,2011-07-04T10:13Z,"Works fine for me, yes it crashes but i am able to play a while atleast and it looks damn good (y) i like the name of the settings in the patch too xD (high, very high, extreme and ultra)
