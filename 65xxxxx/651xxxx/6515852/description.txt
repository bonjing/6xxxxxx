SUMMARY:
When his brother is killed in a robbery, paraplegic Marine Jake Sully 
decides to take his place in a mission on the distant world of Pandora. 
There he learns of greedy corporate figurehead Parker Selfridge's intentions 
of driving off the native humanoid "Na'vi" in order to mine for the precious 
material scattered throughout their rich woodland. In exchange for the 
spinal surgery that will fix his legs, Jake gathers intel for the cooperating 
military unit spearheaded by gung-ho Colonel Quaritch, while simultaneously 
attempting to infiltrate the Na'vi people with the use of an "avatar" identity. 
While Jake begins to bond with the native tribe and quickly falls in love with 
the beautiful alien Neytiri, the restless Colonel moves forward with his 
ruthless extermination tactics, forcing the soldier to take a stand - and 
fight back in an epic battle for the fate of Pandora.
