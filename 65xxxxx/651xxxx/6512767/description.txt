In 1967 The Monkees played at 36 concert venues in the U.S. and the U.K. Twenty-seven of these concert dates were during the Summer U.S. Tour that began on July 8, 1967 in Jacksonville, Florida and ended on August 27, 1967 in Spokane, Washington.

 Mike Nesmith played, of course, lead guitar and, every so often, the harmonica. Peter Tork played bass guitar, keyboards and the ubiquitous banjo. Davy Jones played percussion. Mickey Dolenz played drums. Of course, each of The Monkees sang. And while the individual Monkees were in their solo spotlight singing "Cripple Creek"/"You Can't Judge A Book By Looking At The Cover"/"Gonna Build A Mountain"/"I Got A Woman," they were accompanied by the musicians of the tour's backing band, The Sundowners.

 The final three shows of this tour -- August 25, 1967 in Seattle, Washington, August 26, 1967 in Portland, Oregon, and August 27, 1967 in Spokane, Washington -- were recorded by RCA Records, who then manufactured and distributed Colgems Records, The Monkees' original label, with the aim, it is presumed, of creating a live album for commercial release.

 All of the tracks on discs two, three, and four from Seattle, Portland and Spokane have been freshly remixed into STEREO from the original four-track masters. And all of the tracks on disc one from Mobile, Alabama are presented in the one-wire MONO.

 From concert to concert, the progression of The Monkees' 1967 stage show is captured in its entirety. And this entirety from time to time includes false starts, the occasional stage miscue, and odd mixes at the beginning of some songs. So whilst each of these recordings is not perfect, each is exactly as you would have heard had you been front row center in the halls in Mobile, Seattle, Portland and Spokane on one of those perfectly frenzied nights.

 And all this means that Summer 1967: The Complete US Concert Recordings contains 51 previously unreleased tracks. And weâ€™ve included a nifty 40-page star-studded 1967 U.S. tour diary that captures in exquisite black-and-white photographic detail The Monkees performances, antics, and visitors at earlier stops of the tour.

 Summer 1967: The Complete US Concert Recordings is available as an individually numbered limited edition of 3,500 copies.
