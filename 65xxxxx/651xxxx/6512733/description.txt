THE BEATLES
UNFORGETTABLE (aka The McCartney Christmas Album)
Remastered Edition
Remasters Workshop RMW 688

Vinyl transfer by beatlebren66, from the LP on His Master's Choice HMC 011.

Declicked, pitch, phase and level corrected at Remasters Workshop April 2011.

This has got to be the quietest vinyl transfer I have ever heard, and for a bootleg vinyl pressing, this was nearly perfect. It won't be obvious that what you are listening to is a record. Thanks to beatlebren66, we now have a digital rendering of "Unforgettable" from a vinyl HMC package. The track order and selection differ from the bonus CD versionAll extraneous noises were removed, but noise reduction was not necessary.
