Mircea Predeleanu, "Prediction of Defects in Material Processing"
 Publisher: Kogan Page Science | 2003 | ISBN: 1903996406 | PDF | 380 pages

 This work contains contributions taken from the Fourth International Conference on Materials Processing Defects in September 2002, including prediction of the occurrence of bulk or surface defects, evaluation of damage induced in a product during processing, formability characterization with a theoretical analysis that couples material flow equations, and the influence of processing-induced defects on the integrity of structures. The book also covers a number of research trends that are still being developed, such as the development of micromechanical damage models, micromechanical analysis of fracture mechanisms and criteria, damage modelling of free surface and interface elements, methods of predicting anistropy induced by large strains in the forming process, quantitative characterization of microscale damage and straining effects, and computer methods for estimation of residual strength of damaged structures or the fatigue limit.
