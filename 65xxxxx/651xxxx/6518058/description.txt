                     |Open Falcon 4.7 with Realism Patch V2.12OF|          
                      ------------------------------------------

       



       Try one of the finest modern combat simulators ever built..., with over 10 years of experience and constant upgrades it remains one of the most realistic simulators for the best multirole fighter of the world, The F-16 Fighting Falcon!

        
Read the "Install.txt" file and it will guide you through the hole installation process in no time!



*Important*:

       After installing any new theaters, please make sure you have also installed "More realistic DEMO's OF 47 Soundpack" from the "ADD-ONS" along with the "Realism patch V2.12OF" from "Open Falcon 4.7 upgrade", then copy the "SIM" and "SOUNDS" folders from the game's main folder(usually Falcon4) into each new theater's own folder within "Falcon4", and overwrite them in order to have all the new theaters flyable at a same realistic level and sound feature as the Korea Theater!



***WARNING***:

       The "Realism patch V2.12OF" is a MULTIPLAYER CRITICAL(***), so it is recommended that everyone who flies in multiplayer will have it installed in order to experience the same levels of realism at their best! For this matter everyone should backup the "SIM", "TerrdataObjects" and "Music" folders in case there is a need to turn back to the original Open Falcon realism level, which is deffinetly lower than what this patch can give...!


Sorry for deleting the older torrent and allways uploading a new one in a mean for keeping this as a complete image and up to date with the latest mods and enhances so everyone can have the same without the need to search for them. 

With this in mind don't forget to periodically come and search for any possible new image version, that may be uploaded...!
