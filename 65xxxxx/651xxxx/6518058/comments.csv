Here come's the latest realism patch (2.15OF), with various fixes, and nonetheless having the F-16 flied to it's real potential and closer than ever, in terms of flight behaviour and characteristics! Now the real F-16 pilots can find it matching in performances, just like the real thing...!

This patch is highly recommended for those who are willing for realism, and may be found here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6620202/Open_Falcon_4.7_s_Realism_Patch_V2.15OF.exe


***VERY IMPORTANT NOTE***

IF YOU HAVE INSTALLED THE ""MORE realistic DEMO's OF 47 Soundpack"", FROM THE ""...ADD-ON\VISUAL AND AUDIO ADD-ONS\"" (FROM WITHIN THE GIVEN IMAGE FILE), AFTER INSTALLING THE REALISM PATCH, THEN YOU HAVE TO INSTALL THE REALISM PATCH AGAIN, OR IN OTHER WORDS, ALWAYS INSTALL THE REALISM PATCH AFTER INSTALLING EVERYTHING ELSE..., OTHERWISE IT MIGHT NOT APPLY CORRECTLY!***

With that in mind, you might always want to look for the best!


Long live the Fighting Falcon..., and Open Falcon FTW!



""Falcon11..., you are free to fire...!"""
