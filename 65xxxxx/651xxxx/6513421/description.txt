About movie: In this film the greatest masterpiece of the creative pair describes the Anglican nuns high in the Himalayas attempting to organize a school and hospital in a former brothel, an ancient ruler. Kerr is very good in the role of a young, ambitious sister Klodag first taste of power, but is susceptible to the temptations of the devil ... Indian-born young actor Sabu (in his last major role) plays a wealthy, hung with jewels young general (he uses the spirits of "Black Narcissus"), bewitched by the seductive beauty of a local girl (weird but very good selection of Simmons for the role). Sister Ruth (Byron brilliantly played the role) is absolutely loses his head and self-control because of their passion for Mr. Dean and jealousy of her sister Klodag.
