,ilocano1968,2011-07-18T16:12Z,thethingy pls try to understand my bad english coz I have a suggestion that you need to verify if its only a luck or realy works and this what I have done...I install my original W7 oem (this OS in cd comes with my medion laptop I buy) into my desktop and use the serial key that attach on my medion laptop and it works that my desktop is activated till now...and again I use the same installer to another laptop and activate it with my neighbors vaio serial key and works also...so I think everybody can use this OS installer and use any active serial to activate it...I will try to upload again this OS so that everybody can try if they can got luck as mine twice...look for my name as the uploader

,McGunMonkey,2011-07-21T23:50Z,"Hello thethingy,

I would like to ask if you could do a Sony Vegas Pro 10.0 torrent for us, I tried Anacondaz but due to the keygen I don't feel safe using such a program and if possible could you do provide us the torrent the same way you have done with adobe products? I have always found those to be the most safest way and 100% to work.

Thank you for the contribution you have done so far thethingy, it has helped me greatly."

,basha04,2011-07-30T13:36Z,tried but no luck :(
,porotta99,2011-08-10T14:14Z,"I was already logged in as ADMINISTRATOR, so i just double-clicked the file and it popped up perfectly. Selected my test version of Enterprise and.... it's now, once again activated! :)

Thank You !"
,ker1997,2011-08-26T12:58Z,"Once again thethingy, you have provided a vast community with a torrent free of viruses or fake promises. Keep up the good work."
,Gabbriel,2011-08-26T15:43Z,"Not working. When I right click and run as administrator, it starts the black small screen and close imediatelly"
,jabire3,2011-08-28T15:23Z,Ran as admin a black box quickly came and went. Opened as normal and I got the screen I am supposed to get but it wont let me activate as it does not have permission as it is not being ran as admin. HELLLLP
,leetut,2011-09-03T20:24Z,"still not working for me, like all the other activators ive ever tried error :0xc004f015 run 'slui.exe bla bla
just want a working windows7 torrent surely someone can crack it by now?"
,zedmike,2011-09-11T03:57Z,"Good day TheThingy. i cant find a way to get in contact with you... as i would expect... and i also cant find a way to graciously do this so here: Huge project, doing a documentary on Pirating to submit to the  film festivals this season, hopefully. I have always been a huge fan of your uploads, adobe especially. We would humbly ask for few comments if you can.

PS- sorry for the spamming"
,sammyboblammy,2011-09-17T03:36Z,"Hey thethingy.
I was using your Microsoft Office installer and accidentally installed with the internet on. I was unable now to uninstall or register with the activator. If you can suggest a program to wipe it clean. I have installed this version the right way many times before but never had to take it off after fucking it up "
,AhhSlowpoke,2011-09-25T04:33Z,"If this activator doesn't work try one of these. 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6699719/Windows_7_Activators

There are two activators on the torrent, if one doesn't work the other one will. Just download, extract, and run the activator. 

Enjoy and please seed!"
,Vircatou,2011-10-27T00:42Z,"Hey, thanks for upload thethingy! But.. how do I know which version to pick, I'm using enterprise(sp1). Am I to pick the one without an extra letter, or the one with an E or N? :s"
,xsanders,2011-11-12T10:13Z,"@jabire3 and leetut

Had the same problem with admin rights and this is what i did
1. opened start -> typed cmd -> right click and select run as administrator
2. select the cmd file (it's full path so u can execute it, u need to know some basic dos commands for this )
3. after the program launches i personally chosed option d and it gave me an error but not that i had no admin rights , moved to next step
4. selected the first option , it was succesfull
5. afther this it gave me an message to update slmgr.vbs since the  KMS client is not updated 
6. typed in start -> slmgr.vbs /ato
7. and now it say that my copy of windows is activated

Good luck"
,hujev,2011-11-16T04:37Z,"Hi, tx as always. 

Do I need to be on the web for this to work? No internyet at home, but trying to install on a workstation there. 

If so, is there a workaround?"
,clsmoove,2012-02-18T16:32Z,"Thanks to thethingy for another great torrent and thanks also to xsanders for the installation tips. I'm now activated for 180 days instead of 30.

For anyone who gets error messages, remember to run cmd as administrator, and don't forget to use ""quotes"" in dos for any filename that's greater than 8.3 characters. "
,shaboogamoo,2012-05-23T23:50Z,"Its not working for me, I right click - run as administrator, a command prompt looking window pops up and disappears, thats all that happens.  

I tried in safe mode also and restarted both times to check for results.  What do I do?"
