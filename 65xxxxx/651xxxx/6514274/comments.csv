,black_shadow_1981,2011-08-28T22:17Z,"i want the movie :-( as a brit im sad that no uk uploader as steped up yet, when its a film from the us it dont take this long for it to be uploaded 

come on guys show the fans some love, im going to buy this on blu ray anyways but i would like to see it first"
,chrismyarse,2011-08-29T04:53Z,black_shadow_1981 totally agree. Maybe it harder to sneak a camera in uk cinemas?! Want the movie now in Vietnam and I v much doubt we'll get it here! Though it does give me the option to shout clunge at random people and they have no idea.
,babsdan,2011-08-30T13:22Z,any1 gonna upload th movie plsssssss
,black_shadow_1981,2011-09-04T02:04Z,still waiting for the movie!!!!!!! at this speed i may as well just wait and get the blu ray (should be out before xmas!)

,Macwilko,2011-09-07T17:40Z,PLEASE can someone upload the movie??? -..... in a S.E.Asian country with no chance of getting a copy
,yogiwankinobi,2011-09-08T23:35Z,Does any of u benders know when the tv special is coming out?
,congo77,2011-09-09T08:37Z,yogi you big bender the special is on oct 3rd.
,good.bloke,2011-09-14T23:10Z,yeah in the UK apparently they check you before you go in so you dont sneak cameras in. I guess we will all just have to wait a bit longer but it should be worth it
,Sachinb,2011-10-02T19:48Z,Funny how so many people are begging for someone to upload the movie and cursing people for not doing it.  When you punks are the spineless ones who won't do it yourself.
,RogerFlipFlop,2011-10-05T13:45Z,"The Inbetweeners Movie is rumoured to have a uk DVD release date of December 12th, until then Im guessing a good quality copy will be as ellusive as a hihg quality Hangover 2 or Devils Double."
,good.bloke,2011-10-07T00:26Z,sweet if its december 12th im gonna go see it here in australia on november 23rd then buy it off ebay
,SoCal87,2011-11-29T11:51Z,"The movie may take a while for people to get, like everything Inbetweeners they have fuck all distribution. A lot of cinemas in my country (Australia) wont even get it and if they do it may only be 1-2 showings a day, alot harder to sneak a camera in. If only the exec's realize the following that The Inbetweeners has maybe they would spend more money on distribution. "
