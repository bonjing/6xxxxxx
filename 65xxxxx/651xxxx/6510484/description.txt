    Erik (Andrew Pleavin), warrior of Draeganoth, is sent by his dying       
    king to retrieve Prince Malachi (Luke Goss), heir to the throne,         
    who's been on an extended tour of the continent for years.               
    Accompanied by Erik's brother, Jason (Ed Speleers), they return home,    
    only to find the king dead and the kingdom desolate. A mysterious        
    stranger appears with a book naming Witchcraft as the cause with         
    clues as to how to defeat the evil ones. The stranger leads the new      
    king and his men on a journey to find the Witches' hiding place,         
    beginning a voyage packed with battle, betrayal, witchcraft and          
    revelation.
