This torrent includes:

The new single-page AreYouTargeted.com website 

The MC-Recovery podcasts by the owner of the above website, in which he briefly touces on his reasons for pulling down the old site, a complete download of which is inculded in one of the previous torrents in this series.  Essentially he is concerned that a lot of the speculative material on that site does more harm than good and may tend to serve the disinformation agenda, as do other well-known "TI" websites such as raven1.net which was also previously archived.    I'm archiving this material because I want to be able to judge for myself and view the material in the future, even if a website gets taken down by its owner, if not a hostile external force.    But the podcasts in particular I recommend, as a great primer on the nature of the human rights abuses that are going on in our midst.

Also a few other odds and ends.
