This is my first upload since being awarded my skull and I wanted to share 
something special. THE KILLER has been called 'The BEST comic you didn't read'


The Killer Vol 3 - Modus Vivendi
by Archaia Comics

A new story arc begins for this Eisner Award-nominated series! In Venezuela, 
the â€œsanctuaryâ€ that he chose to withdraw from the world for four long years, 
our Killer reappears on the scene. What brought him back? Boredom, fatigue, 
the need for action? His old friend Mariano recommends him for a quick-and-dirty 
freelance job. Except that the job, obviously, is worse than it seemed at first. 
Remove one banker and one international oil broker, sure, no problem. But why is 
his third and final target a nun, Madre Luisa, so devoted, selfless and invested 
in her ministry to the poorest of the poor in all of Latin America? A perfect 
jumping-on spot for readers new to the series!
