,agm137,2011-07-03T13:41Z,Thanks a lot! Why you miss stage 5?
,agm137,2011-07-03T13:43Z,Thanks a lot! Why you missed Round 5?
,jeffro890,2011-07-03T16:51Z,Dude thanks a lot for this.... been waiting for first motos since beginning of the season... question?? how do you get this recorded??.... let me know how and I'll try so if you missed some motos maybe I don't and I will post them too. I've been following slicknick torrents for the last 3 or 4 year. I hope you keep these coming.

I record these videos with iShowU HD. It's just a soft to record your computer screen, i think it's dedicated for eLearning, but works perfectly for motocross.
Thanks.
For the previous rounds, I just don't have the time to record them, as the races are available on allisport.com, I focus on FIM championship."

,ninjakecil,2011-07-05T04:28Z,"Thanks for the release..

But, is it just me or the playback is a little choppy/lagging? I try all of my player on my PC and it is still choppy/lagging."
,jeffro890,2011-07-06T00:10Z,"Ok great, I'm gonna try to do it and see how it goes I did tried once a similar software, but the quality was the worst, I saw Red Bud first moto already and it looks good not excellent but good really good...thanks a lot for the info"
