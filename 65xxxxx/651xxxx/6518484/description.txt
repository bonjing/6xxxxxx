                           DESCRiPTiON 

 The story of Vicky and Andy Lamb, who in May 2010 became parents of the first 
 sextuplets born in England for 17 years, following them through the most      
 dramatic time of their lives. Although two of the babies died shortly after   
 being born, the couple were eventually able to take home the remaining four,  
 and began to experience such tasks as nappy-changing and bottle-feeding, as   
 well as preparing for their first Christmas together. Narrated by Hugh        
 Bonneville.                                                                   
                                 Enjoy!
