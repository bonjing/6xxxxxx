 This book describes comprehensive step-by-step protocols for the delineation of genetic amplification and histological detection techniques. Each procedure has been tested and validated for its sensitivity, precision, and reproducibility, and the authors give advice on the design of primers for PCR applications and on optimizing these protocols for use with plant, insect, and prokaryotic cells.
