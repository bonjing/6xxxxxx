,cartman19987,2011-07-03T17:33Z,Thanks so much. I'll seed indefinitely.
[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-03T20:27Z,"You're welcome C-Man. Im a huge fan of the show and so glad its ongoing in comic form, TPB just needed an update."
,cartman19987,2011-07-04T01:32Z,Well said. I've been meaning to finish watching the series for a while now.
[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-04T03:23Z,"I watched it sporadically when it aired. But funny you should mention it, I LITERALLY finished watching the series all the way through yesterday. :)"
,cartman19987,2011-07-05T18:41Z,"Haha wow. I've actually been watching Babylon 5 recently, very good show which, also, had a run of comics."
[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-05T22:58Z,"B5 is awesome, rewatched that a few months ago - not a fan of Season 5 tho."
,cartman19987,2011-07-06T23:02Z,"Yeah there were a few problems with season 5. For starters, the show's fourth season was thought to be its last, since the creator thought it was doomed to be cancelled, which is why season 4 is so intense (and also my favorite). Also, no Ivanova in season 5 :("
[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-07T03:47Z,The few people who remained just got corrupted or some other depressing thing happen to them. I just stop at the end of S4.
,cartman19987,2011-07-08T23:34Z,"Yep. Although I am a fan of the series finale, which was actually filmed during season 4, hence Ivanova and no Lochley."
