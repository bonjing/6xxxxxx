James Mollâ€™s documentary chronicles the 16-year history of the Foo Fighters: from the bandâ€™s very first songs created as cassette demos Grohl recorded during his tenure as Nirvanaâ€™s drummer through its ascent to their Grammy-winning, multi-platinum, arena and stadium headlining status as one of the biggest rock bands on the planet. This chronicling of the Foo Fightersâ€™ triumphs and tragedies will culminate in an in-depth behind the scenes perspective on the making of the new album: a process in which the band pushed itself forward by going fully back to basics and recording in Grohlâ€™s garage completely on analog tape. No computers, no software â€“ just a band recording an album to tape in a garage.
