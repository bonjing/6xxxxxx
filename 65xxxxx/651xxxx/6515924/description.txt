eTextbook of "Thomas' Calculus, 12th Edition" by G. B. Thomas, M. D. Weir and J. Hass (c2010). A single, unduly large PDF file (350 MB; not for netbooks obviously) complete with table of contents, appendices and index. Quality: Good (best viewed in full screen mode). Non-native PDF could not be losslessly compressed.

COMMENT: Consult  http://www.pearsonhighered.com/pearsonhigheredus/educator/series/series_result.page?seriesId=11601 for info (features & table of contents) to make an informed decision. This upload corresponds to the first version in the series, covering both single- and multi-variable calculus, and with transcendental functions treated in a separate chapter, not along the way as notions are being developed.

Comment: Instructor's solution manual already available here on TPB.

Once your download has finished, _please_ seed this torrent as often and for as long as you possibly can.
