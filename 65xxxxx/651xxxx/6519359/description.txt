This album is so good it's unbelievable; It's such a great listening experience. I especially love the rendition of "Will The Circle Be Unbroken" by The Staple Singers it carries so well and the emotions come through.

There are so many great songs on this album for true fans of classic blues and folk that I would almost venture that it has no equal. 

If you have never really listened to bluesy folk music, give this disc a try. I definitely recommend adding this album to any collection of American folk and blues recordings.
