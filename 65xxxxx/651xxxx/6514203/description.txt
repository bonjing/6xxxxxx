
Don Quixote (BBC drama - radio play, 1980) [WebRip (mp3)]

Cervantes' classic novel, dramatised by John Arden

First broadcast in 1980

Two episodes of one and a half hours each

"Widely regarded as the first modern novel, Miguel de Cervantes's classic tale chronicles the adventures of the knight-errant Don Quixote de la Mancha and his faithful squire Sancho Panza in 17th century Spain. Published in two volumes a decade apart, Don Quixote is the most influential work of literature to emerge from the Spanish Golden Age and perhaps the entire Spanish literary canon. As a founding work of modern Western literature, it regularly appears at or near the top of lists of the greatest works of fiction ever published and is the best-selling non-religious, non-political work of fiction of all time."

Bob Grant dons the suit of armour as Don Quixote and Bernard Cribbins is Sancho in this enjoyable caper.

Directed by Alfred Bradley
