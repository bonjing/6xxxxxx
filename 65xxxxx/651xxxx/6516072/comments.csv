[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-05T19:21Z,"Yeah I plan to do the same when price drops and bugs are worked out. I'd like to be able to take my digital comics with me.

You're very welcome FattyMcButterpants - PS love the name. LOL"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-05T21:49Z,How is the screen? I heard its a bit small for comics. Also how is it on the eyes and in bright lights/ direct sunlight? 
,BatDinger,2011-07-07T05:00Z,"comics work GREAT for iphone/pad/touch. I read on iphone 3gs, no app, just upload the jpgs as photo albums. "
[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-07T08:43Z,"Ive thought about throwing one on my Ipod but since sometimes I find even my computer monitor a bit small - Cant imagine, unless it goes panel by panel... "
