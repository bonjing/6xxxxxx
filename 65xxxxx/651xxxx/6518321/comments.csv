Thanks and Kindest regards,

A true ardent fan"
[V],VLiS,2011-07-08T18:27Z,"I never take requests and rarely reply to comments but i'll do it this time because your comment is to the point and your observation is correct.
I've uploaded too much ""hollywood"" lately but decent movies IMO.
I'll try to make things right in the future :)

BTW, i've also encoded and shared Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal"" :P
You didn't mention it in your comment :P

TC m8 and thanx for your comment :)
