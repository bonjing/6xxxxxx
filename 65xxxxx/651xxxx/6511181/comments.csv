,exateit,2011-08-06T06:12Z,"Burn it to a 50GB bluray disc

BTW thanks to the uploader, quality and 3D is fantastic!  See if you can upload some more full 3D titles.

Much appreciated"

Or, if you're like most of us who don't have a BluRay burner, just mount the .iso using Virtual Clone Drive (or whatever mounting software you prefer) and watch using CyberLink PowerDVD 11.
