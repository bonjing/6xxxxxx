This is a no-frills set of CD's reissuing the classic Miles Davis albums released during his tenure with the Prestige label in the 1950's, prior to his signing with the Columbia label (where he made such classics as Kind of Blue, Sketches of Spain, ESP, etc). The albums are presented in stand-alone card sleeves, the original liner notes have not been reproduced here, and there is no booklet. While some bonus takes are included, not all of the alternate material available elsewhere has been included on the albums. Some of the CD's clock in at not much more than half an hour in length, and they have not been remastered, relying on the (excellent) masterings of the late 80's and early 90's. So those expecting this release to be of the standard of the Sony/Columbia material from Miles Davis will be disappointed. This material has been given a more thorough treatment elsewhere, eg on the Chronicle box set. However, if you want the albums as originally released and the price appeals, proceed with confidence. This is a hard release to rate, and it depends on individual taste - if you want the original albums uncluttered (as I did) it is a four-star release. If your expectations have been raised by the various Sony boxed sets and you enjoy careful documentation, critical commentary, newly discovered takes and remastered sound, you might feel this set only warrants two stars. The music, of course, is excellent, notably on the final five discs. Those five albums document the First Miles Davis Quintet with John Coltrane, some of the most influential and best-loved music in all of jazz. The other albums are more mixed, but are never less than listenable and contain a few lesser-known gems in the Miles catalogue.
