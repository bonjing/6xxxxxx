Magical Mystery Tour is an LP and a double EP by English rock group The Beatles and produced by George Martin, both including the six-song soundtrack to the 1967 movie of the same name. The record format released in the United Kingdom on 8 December 1967, was a six-track double EP on the Parlophone label, whilst in the United States the record, released (11 days earlier) on 27 November 1967, was an eleven-track LP created by Capitol Records, adding the band's 1967 single releases.

The US LP was later adopted as the official version of the record when The Beatles' catalogue was updated for the 1980s digital Compact Disc releases. The album was remastered 9 September 2009 for the first time since its CD release. The soundtrack was a critical and commercial success, a #1 album in the US and Grammy-nominated, despite the relative critical and commercial failure of the Magical Mystery Tour film.

It was the Beatles first album to be released after the death of their manager Brian Epstein.

History of the project
Magical Mystery Tour film


After Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Paul McCartney wanted to create a film based upon The Beatles and their music. The film was to be unscripted: various "ordinary" people were to travel on a coach and have unspecified "magical" adventures. The Magical Mystery Tour movie was made and included six new Beatles songs. The film originally screened on BBC-TV over the 1967 Christmas holidays but was savaged by critics.[1]
Initial release formats

The number of songs used in the film posed a problem for The Beatles and their UK record company EMI, as there were too few for an LP album but too many for an EP.[2] One idea considered was to issue an EP which played at 33? rpm but this would have caused a loss of fidelity that was deemed unacceptable. The solution chosen was to issue an innovative format of two EP's packaged in a gatefold sleeve with a 28-page booklet containing the lyrics and colour pictures.[2] Of the package, Bob Neaverson wrote "While it certainly solved the song quota problem, one suspects that it was also partly born of The Beatles' pioneering desire to experiment with conventional formats and packaging".[3] The package was released in the UK on the 8th of December, in time for the Christmas market, at the sub Â£1 price of 19s 6d[2] (equivalent to Â£13 today), which made the package much cheaper than an LP.[citation needed]

In the US, EPs were not popular at the time so (and against The Beatles' wishes) Capitol Records decided to release the soundtrack as an LP by adding some recent non-album singles.[2] The LP package included the EP set's 24-page photo/comic booklet blown up to LP-size.[citation needed] The first side of the LP was the film soundtrack (like earlier British Beatles soundtrack albums), and the second side was a collection of A-side and B-sides released in 1967, with the songs "Penny Lane", "Baby, You're a Rich Man" and "All You Need Is Love" presented in duophonic, fake "processed" stereo, sound.[2][4]

Note that on all stereo releases of both packages, "I Am the Walrus" is in true-stereo only part way through, after which the sound becomes fake-stereo.

In 1969 and 1971, the previously unavailable true-stereo mixes were created[2] that allowed the first true-stereo version of the LP to be issued (in Germany in 1971[8]).

Due to public demand for the LP in the UKâ€”as an American import, it had peaked on the British album charts at number 31 in January 1968[9][10]â€”in 1976, EMI released it in the UK [2] but reusing the Capitol masters with the fake-stereo.

When standardising The Beatles' releases for the worldwide Compact Disc release in 1987, the LP version of Magical Mystery Tour (in true-stereo) was included with the otherwise British album line-up. [11]

The inclusion of the 1967 singles on CD with this album meant both that the Magical Mystery Tour CD would be of comparable length to the band's other album CDs, and that those three singles would not need to be included on Past Masters, a two-volume compilation designed to accompany the initial CD album releases and provide all non-album tracks (mostly singles) on CD format.[12]

The album (along with The Beatles' entire UK studio album catalogue) was remastered and reissued on CD in 2009. In homage to the album's conception and first release, the CD incorporates the original Capitol LP label design. The remastered CD features a mini-documentary about the album. Initial copies of the album accidentally list the mini-documentary to be one made for Let It Be.
