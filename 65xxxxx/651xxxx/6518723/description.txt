Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law features ex-superhero Harvey T. Birdman of Birdman and the Galaxy Trio as 
an attorney working for a law firm alongside other cartoon stars from 1960s and 1970s Hanna-Barbera cartoon series. Similarly, Harvey's clients are also primarily composed of 
characters taken from Hanna-Barbera cartoon series of the same era. Many of Birdman's nemeses featured in his former cartoon series also became attorneys, 
often representing the opposing side of a given case.

-------------------------------------------------------

Summary Shazzan the Genie v Mentok the Mind-Taker
 
Avenger inexplicably starts talking. Peanut discovers a vase that, when rubbed, releases Shazzan, now in servitude to Peanut. Shazzan accuses Mentok of having imprisoned him in the vase centuries ago for gazing on the king's intended. Mentok was a genie called Mufti the Mizwa of Muzzy Tah in those days, one of several identities he has had over the years. Shazzan insists on Peanut representing him, and Mentok, after he is captured, manipulates Harvey into representing him. Mentok insists that Shazzan is attempting to frame him, and escapes from court to retrieve the halves of a magic disk that, when put back together and the magic word thus revealed is spoken (by Avenger), imprisons Shazzan in the vase again. 

Note:

Mentok attempts to escape from his prison by putting on Harvey's mask is based on Hannibal's escape on The Silence of the Lambs

35 Babysitter Richard Ferguson-Hull October 16, 2006 
-------------------------------------------------------
 
Summary N/A 

Peter Potamus takes over Sebben & Sebben in Phil's absence. Reducto babysits Peanut on his birthday. Birdgirl/Judy is searching for her father Phil. Birdman goes to his highschool reunion. While running across an intersection after Peanut's party, Reducto is hit by a clown-car and killed. 
Trivia

When Phil gets hit by the bus, and near the very end of the episode, the bus that hits Phil and almost hits Reducto has a billboard that says "Watch the Colbert Report" with a drawing of an eagle with headphones on. The eagle is the main symbol of The Colbert Report. 
When Phil is about to leave, he talks about starting his own law firm ("or spin off, if you will"), and how it will have a big S-shaped desk perfect for interviews, and that he would be far too busy to regularly appear, but that he will still be a contributor, or a senior correspondent ("... in law"). These are references to Stephen Colbert (the actor who voices Phil and Reducto) getting his own Daily Show spin-off, The Colbert Report. 
At the part when Harvey says "Phil's dead 10 minutes" is right at the 10 minute mark on the DVD

Trivia

On an island, a bus driver has his bus parked in the rain, and an arm, a leg, and a lobster appears from the bottom of the windshield wiper. Finally, Phil Ken Sebben appears and laughs "HA HA HA! Final episode stunt casting!", which is referring to Stephen Colbert's brief leave to work on his show, The Colbert Report, and coming back for the final episode to voice his character again.
