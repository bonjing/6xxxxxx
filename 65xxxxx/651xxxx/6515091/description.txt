Extreme Fishing: Series 1 with Robson Green
This thrilling adventure series takes actor and passionate fisherman Robson Green on the adventure of a lifetime to the greatest fishing destinations ever seen. Robson Green is on a mission to discover the weird, the wonderful and the way-off-limits of the fishing world. Chasing some of the most elusive and terrifying fish on the planet, Robson learns new tricks, hears old stories and eats pretty much everything he catches. From Costa Rica, living with the Maleku tribe as they hunt the elusive piranha-like machaca; through Louisiana in search of barracudas; to South Africa to face a hammerhead shark; hunting giant catfish on the Ebro River; and at sea in the Azores, attempting to catch a 500lb blue marlin; in all these experiences and more - Robson Green discovers a world of drama unlike any he has ever experienced before.

Robson Green embarks on a trip of colossal proportions that sees him attempting to land some of the wildest and most elusive sea creatures in the world. His first port of call is Costa Rica, where he will try to realise a lifelong dream of catching the fastest fish in the water.
