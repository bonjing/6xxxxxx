Video=9.5/10
Audio=9.5/10
Excellent quality. Keep it up. 10/10 will be the actual blu ray release(49 Gb.. LoL). 
Thank you very much. Btw... please try to add DTS audio. Each video is less than 3 Gb but still only one can be fit on a 4.7Gb DVD. So increasing the size a bit shouldn't hurt?
I watched all 3 three movies with my Sony BluRay HT and LG ""42 HDTV with my jaw dropped, specially Ultimatum. Thanks again."
