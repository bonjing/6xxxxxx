         Daphne and Emmett join Toby and Wilke in a poker game         
         with a couple other people; Wilke flirts with Daphne,         
         which Emmett doesn't like; Daphne and Emmett aren't           
         allowed to sign to each other while they play poker,          
          but she communicates with him anyway.
