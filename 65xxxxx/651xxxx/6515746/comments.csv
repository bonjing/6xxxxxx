,Laranth,2011-07-06T01:02Z,Does it have the start?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
,ashtonkusher,2011-07-06T08:50Z,is this missing begining 15 min?
,G3n3tiX,2011-07-06T13:51Z,"One word. EXCELLENT.....Best quality so far. Best Audio too....And has what I believe to be ALL of the movie. Aprox 13 minutes of the start is there as opposed to the other POS copy with crappy azz audio and video. 

One tip 

1.) Open the VLC video settings and click on sharpen and slide it right about 5 millimetres.

It looks like the hue has been changed a bit too. You can re-touch it if you want in the VLC video settings as well.

Compared to the best TS I've seen, which was Watchmen many years ago, I'd give this 

V: 8
A: 9.5
M: 10

Compared to the best TC I've seen, I'd give this 

V: 7

Compared to the best DVDSCR I've seen, I'd give this

V: 6.5"
,G3n3tiX,2011-07-06T14:10Z,"Image adjust this in VLC 

HUE: right 1 millimeter 

Pause it on Prime @ 28:24 and make sure his heads a touch more blue than purple. Make sure his arm is closest to red as possible. 

Caution: Don't move it too far right otherwise his head will be optimized at the blue range, but reds turn purple. So any really fair characters will turn a touch blue on the darker parts of their faces (Ears, etc.)

CONTRAST: right 1 millimeter
BRIGHTNESS: left 1 millimeter

This will show more defined colors."
,catthou,2011-07-06T17:20Z,"Very good quality for a ts. At one point I noticed the volume dropped around the middle and came back up later on, but it was only a slight dip.

Near the end some lady stands up, so you can see her silhouette for a bit, but that's to be expected with cams.

Overall it's pretty decent."

Good quality for a cam. Just wish that woman at the end didn't stand up.

There are some awesome action scenes, and they actually downplayed the cartoon robots."
