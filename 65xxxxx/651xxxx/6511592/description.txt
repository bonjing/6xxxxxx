The complete Aubrey/Maturin unabridged works by Patrick O'Brian all read by Patrick Tull

Set in the Napoleonic era the series revolves around the exploits of friends and colleagues ship Captain Jack Aubrey and his Surgeon Stephen Maturin. Without a doubt these are some of the best historical fiction novels around, laced with detail and an incredible level of accuracy these are highly enjoyable sea faring adventures novels.

Why download this version? Because the entire series is read by one man, Patrick Tull. His reading are superlative, some of the best Audio book readings I have experienced. Personally I found Simon Vance's readings dreadful.

This has taken quite some time to compile. Many I got off my own back, I have also Codger to thank for providing the last 3 books which had eluded me for some time! Some of these audio books were near impossible to find so I hope to make your lives a little easier!
