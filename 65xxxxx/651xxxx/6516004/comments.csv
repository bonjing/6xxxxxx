I've been producing music since I was 11 (I am now 18) and I am ready to get out there and chase after dreams.
All you dubstep/electronic lovers, please check out my track on Youtube by searching ""Kid Chemical - Genesis"".
Listen while you browse! You wont regret it! (Free download! ;)

Thank you all :)
