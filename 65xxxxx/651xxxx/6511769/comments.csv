You didn't follow the instructions after step 1. 

2. Once installation is completed, click on authorize later
3. Wait for it to finish installing Live Pack Content
4. Once Live Pack Content installation is completed, copy the Live 8.2.2 onto 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Ableton\Live 8.2.2\Programs\
5. Dobule click on Authorize822.auz
6. Open Ableton Live 8.2.2 in C:\Program Files (x86)\Ableton\Live 8.2.2\Programs\
7. You will now see a pop message saying
""You have successfully authorized.
Thank you, and have fun!
Max for Live is authorized but Max does not appear to be installed. Download Max.""



If you didn't follow the instructions after step 2 then Live Pack is not installed properly. "

I have followed all instructions but it does not seem to want to install any live packs, I did the first intallation yesterday but did not have the time to finish the live pack installations as I had to leave work and pack up my laptop, i tried to resume it today but ableton does not give any prompts to install live packs or download max again, I have gone into ""file"" and selected the install live packs button but all the files it brings up are emty? am I missing something?
I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling Ableton but it doesnt ask to intall live packs again, what do I do now?"

,sufibridge,2011-07-22T13:12Z,"Have tried this twice now .. also got ""This authorisation is not valid on this computer.""
Pretty sure I did it right. Anyway got fed up and am using the 30 day trial. Meanwhile tried again and it just goes to the trial one. 
If I take everything off and start again do you reckon it will work ? I wonder if Ableton leave something on the comp so that once you have opened the prog with them or used the trial version they suss you out ?
When you open Ableton there is a folder with 8.2.2 on it but inside there is a folder with one like yours and another one looking just the same inside a folder called ""program"" .. 
When you say write over do you mean drag and drop ? ..  
I understand the method but get something wrong each time maybe .. or is it that Ableton will catch it every time now ? 
 I put the trial one in a seperate place (downloads) so I wouldn't get confused and yours installed in programs as expected .. but it'll just go to the trial one and open that .. 
If I uninstall everything and follow your instructions again will it work or have I fucked it now ? 
Â£300.00 is a lot of money .. but it's the only good one after trying Mixcraft, Fruity Loops, Cubase and Multitrack Studio .. Jeez I'm going crazy here ! Please be patient .. yours desperately  : )"
,sufibridge,2011-07-22T13:20Z,"If I'm already using the trial version will this still work ? Tried twice now. Get ""This authorisation not valid on this computer."" message and now just opens in the trial all the time."
,sufibridge,2011-07-22T17:43Z,"Thanks ! Triumph of the will ! Very nice. :) Yeah .. in the pic it looks like the straight 8.2.2 live (coloured) but when it initialises on my comp the pic is in black and grey like the ""Suite"" advertised on their site .. Don't know if you are answering questions any longer (or even reading  them) however it would be nice to know which one it is .. I'm still working out what's on it .. but the difference in price is about 200 $ (? !!)
the Max zip didn't want to open but I think I opened it with Ableton .. correct ? .. 
 It's a good prog .. Thanx again anyway. :)

For anyone else concerned with all these issues the trial version and the cracked one run as completely seperate entities. No cross-over problems on authorization. "
,adrianlives,2011-07-23T13:45Z,"@ sufibridge.. I had a few problems but have it right now... you have to do the setup from the downloaded file, when finished with setup close everything & open the ""live 8.2.2"" file inside C drive/program files/ableton/8.2.2/programs, once it has opened, it will ask you to authorize, in the bottom right  of this pop-up click ""authorize later"",  Live will tell you that u cannot save etc without authorization, click OK, it will then automatically open load the live packs, this takes quite a while but leave it to do so, I tried cancelling before but then cldnt load them again after and had to clear every ableton file from my system before I cld reinstall and load packs.
after everything has loaded and the program is open you must then close it, go back to your downloaded file and copy the black 8.2.2 file, go back to C drive/program files/ableton/8.2.2/programs and paste the copied file, click copy & replace.
After this close all and open downloaded file again, double click on the authorize.exe and open the new 8.2.2 file pasted into your program files, let the program do its thing, it will authorize itself and open the full version, after this it will ask if u want to download max..... hope it works for u it has for me :) - also hope this makes sense..?? cheers!

Just do as it says, and once you install you may have to wait 3 minutes until it opens, then it will install the live (Bass, Guitar, sounds etc) and this will take a few minutes.

Once done, copy the Live 8.2.2 into the folder, and if its already there, replace it.

,JBent0n,2011-10-01T21:31Z,"@theLEAK hey, nice torrent. I downloaded and authorized the software successfuly! Nice job.
Well, I've still got some quetions about MAX:
You say that max is actually authorized too, right? where can I get it? I went to the official page an there is MAX5 to download, but it says trial or buy.
LOL, i can't buy of course. How to get full version of MAX5 or does it automaticly active to full after installing trial?(because it's authorized already?)

THX!! Please reply."

,Negate,2011-10-15T19:45Z,"Now anyone facing missing Library problems i have the solution xD

Step one open ableton live 8.2.2
Next you must open the preferences and go under library

select change library and then find ableton live in the programs and it will start a scan

after the scan it will give you a message saying its not there and say download live packs or library nonesence and then when you get a little window downloading 11000 items that's the library downloading
it can take around 15-30 min but is vary needed in whatever your doing"

,96seg96,2011-11-28T01:33Z,"I have installed and it works perfectly, but the only issue I have is, when I run Ableton, a pop-up about installhelper.ex comes up requesting permission to run. I looked it up and was told by a few websites that this, along with OceanM.dll (both found in C:\Program Files\Ableton\Live 8.2.2\Program) are viruses. I then deleted those ASAP and ran a virus scan afterwards. Everything was fine, but now every time I run Ableton, I first get a pop-up saying ""Windows cannot find 'C:\Program Files\Ableton\Live 8.2.2\Program\InstallHelper.exe'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, then try again.""  and Ableton will only load after this pop-up is closed. This isn't a major problem as Ableton works fine, but this comment serves as a warning to anyone who uses this! Also, if anyone can tell me how I can stop this pop-up, please do!

3. Wait for it to finish installing Live Pack Content
4. Once Live Pack Content installation is completed, copy the ""Live 8.2.2"" from the folder u downloaded (where u ran ""Setup.exe"" from) into the installation folder which by default is

6. Close Ableton and re-open Ableton Live 8.2.2 in C:\Program Files (x86)\Ableton\Live 8.2.2\Programs\  (Or the directory where u installed it)

I installed ableton and got it running but there was a message saying that the library was unavailable - This is how to resolve it.

1) On Live 8 go to ""Options"" then ""preferences"" and find the library tab on the preferences window.

2) At the top of the window it will say the library location is c:\users\documents\ableton\library - the library file does not exist, you have to create it yourself, so create a folder called Library in c:\users\ableton

3) Go back on to Live 8 - options - preferences - Library, you should now be able to use the repair library feature, click it and let it install the packs (this will take a turtles lifetime so be patient)

4) After this you should be able to use the all the default features and packs in the library.

,winning1,2012-03-12T20:17Z,"Download great, took a moment to get the authorization but now its fine, but now im not getting any sound at all plz help"
,pokeintheeye,2012-03-15T04:47Z,"@Bieshealer

I pretty much did the same thing. In order to install again, I went in to registry and searched 'ableton'.

I then deleted each instance in which it occurred.

Just installed ok."

,reaperking666,2012-03-17T03:51Z,"The steps are right but unclear, here is the way I did it and it worked.
Instructions:
1. Install Ableton Live 8.2.2 by clicking on the application ""Setup.exe""
2. Once installation is completed go to the same folder u downloaded (the folder where u clicked ""setup.exe"" to install ableton) and copy ""Live 8.2.2.exe"" to installation folder. 
3.Then click the ""authorize822.aux"" file. It will say ""Authorization Complete""
4. Allow installation of Live Pack content to complete.
FINISHED!!!

(After doing this I realized what the issue is, here is the revised instructions that came from the uploader of ableton to clarify any discrepencies)

Instructions:
1. Install Ableton Live 8.2.2 by clicking on the application ""Setup.exe""
2. Once installation is completed, Ableton automatically starts up and begins to run, wait for the Authorization dialogue to appear, then click on ""authorize later""
3. Allow and Wait for it to finish installing ""Live Pack Content""
4. Once ""Live Pack Content"" installation is completed, copy the ""Live 8.2.2"" from the folder u downloaded (where u ran ""Setup.exe"" from) into the installation folder which by default is
C:Program Files (x86)AbletonLive 8.2.2Programs (unless u changed it to a different directory)
5. Dobule click on ""Authorize822.auz"" from the folder u downloaded.
6. Close Ableton and re-open Ableton Live 8.2.2 in/from C:Program Files (x86)AbletonLive 8.2.2Programs (Or the directory where u installed it)
7. You will now see a pop-up message saying
""You have successfully authorized.
Thank you, and have fun!
Max for Live is authorized but Max does not appear to be installed. Download Max.""
8. Click ""Download MAX"" button/link which will take u to ableton website. Download it from there if u want and install. (This is Optional)
9. Enjoy!

2. If the program open after install, close it.
3. Copy the live 8.2.2.exe that's in download to C:Program FilesAbletonLive 8.2.2Program or where the hell u installed and OPEN it.
4. When the authorization screen pops, choose Later... and still with the program opened, open the Authorize822 file thats in this download.

First of all, at Step 2, My Ableton does not open automatically after first install, I have to open it, and from then, the library is not automatically imported, again it must be done manually. At this stage, I return to the Steps, where upon opening the Authorization file, I simply get, (as many other people have stated) the error message ""This Authorization file is invalid on this computer"". I would be most grateful if anyone could come forward and explain how to get to step 8, I would be extremely grateful! Thank YhoO!"
