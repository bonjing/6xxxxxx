    Cody Abiliene is a semi-successful private detective desperately in      
    need of a big (and well-paying) case. When he's hired to solve the       
    murder of Contessa Luciana's husband, he jumps at the chance. In         
    between investigating the many women around the Contessa's estate,       
    Abilene eventually uncovers a complex case of espionage and              
    blackmail.
