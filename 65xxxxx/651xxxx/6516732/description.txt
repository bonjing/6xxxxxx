Playing in a New York City club as honored in jazz circles as Yankee Stadium is in baseball, and where grand slam saxmen John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins gave some of their finest performances, saxophone star Joshua Redman follows the tracks of jazz giants but gets a few base hits of his own. He's helped by a receptive audience (which he thanks in the liner notes by saying Through you, jazz lives) and first-rate combo including outstanding solos from pianist Peter Martin and drummer Brian Blade.
Spirit Of The Moment recalls much of the traditional jazz known and loved before. But when most new jazz stars fall under the smooth banner (with critical barbs and high sales that entails), Redman's performances in this live setting show him and his combo to be growing jazz talents.
