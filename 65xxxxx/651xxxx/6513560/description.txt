                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Making a Fake Fiona Bruce and Philip Mould investigate the career of notorious forger
 Han van Meegeren, who fooled galleries and buyers in the early 20th century with his
 fake versions of paintings by Old Masters. Using modern forensic science, the
 presenters unpick the intricacies of his technique, and investigate claims that a
 piece in a prestigious London gallery could be the final example of van Meegeren's
 handiwork.
                         
                                 Enjoy!
