Bunnyman (2009)

Driving through the remote regions of Southern California, a group of friends are forced into a sickening game of cat and mouse, with a five ton dump truck. When looking for help, they stumble upon a family of cannibals, who take pleasure dismembering and eating as many of the kids as possible.

The lucky few who escape, now most answer to the head of the cannibalistic family, a horribly disfigured man, simply known as Bunnyman. Consumed by rage, he hides his demons behind a bunny suit. He lures in his victims with a cute bunny costume, only to torture them with his weapon of choice, a chainsaw.

From filmmaker Carl Lindbergh (Shattered Lives) comes this years most bizarre and hardcore horror film where nothing is sacred. You've been warned.
