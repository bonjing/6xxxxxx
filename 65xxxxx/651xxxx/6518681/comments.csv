I notice you donâ€™t get a lot of thanks from anybody, but I assume that everyone actually thanks you, but is just too lazy to say so. 

This is a great torrent, I had all except Classical 2 which now means you have personally saved me a lot of time by not having to rip my CDs. 

I think Vanessa May is phenomenally talented and I really donâ€™t mind there being no tag information what-so-ever, as this provides an opportunity for checking.

There is an error however regarding the track listing and titles in the torrent. 

The album â€œClassical 1â€, tracks 10-16 are wrong. Basically they have slipped down by one and track 16 should be â€œI'm A-Doun For Lack O' Johnnyâ€

Apart from that, a great upload, and thanks again for this and your many others. "
