Release Notes:
Here we go with another fine release. Ok, now i'm not going to lie, this was a right bitch to sort
out. As you all should know, the REZiLAB release was the better of the two videos, but it was
missing around 14 mins at the start, and the odd bit here and there throughout the movie. The
SMSB release was full, so for starters i cut the missing mins from the SpankMySeedbox release.
I then cut the little paramount opening part from the RELiZLAB release, i then synced and added
the missing part of the movie - the opening. Now i guess you are wondering why this release is
only 2hr 20mins? - That's because of all the cuts i had to make to put it together, those missing 
minutes are just from little parts in the film where odd seconds are missing, so there may be a few 
little glitches, but nothing that messes up the storyline at all. I have finished watching this and 
there was not a problem for me, the story is there in full, just odd words are cut out here and 
there, but it's nothing massive and still very very watchable..

As for the audio, i just took the audio from the SPSB release and synced it up with the better
video CAM, the RELiZLAB.

Anyway, when i had the complete video, i put it into a letterbox format, as the videos were
dfferent sizes. I also touched up the video a little whilst i was there, filter wise. I then
finally took the 1.4gb avi file i was left with and converted it to a 700mb x264 MP4 file, for
easier compatability, i then cropped of the letterbox and was left with a very sweet 640 x 268
file. I know a few encodes are already out of this, but in my opinion this is the best yet.
This is perfectly is sync all the way through, no quality has been lost, i have to give
it a 9/10, if you are fussy and want to wait for a better copy then please feel free to go
ahead, but this is watchable even for the people that hate CAM's, i doubt any of you are
reading this, but i hope you are. Big thanks to the people who CAM'd the original sources.
Anyway, i hope you enjoy this release as i've put so much effort into it lol.
