What's going on?"

,RealArmyMan26,2011-07-03T21:09Z,"Movie was great up until about 1hr 15 mins.  After that, the audio is COMPLETELY out of sync, by God knows how much.  This goes on for the next 25 minutes, during which, nothing makes a lick of sense.  Then, audio completely cuts out for the remainder of the movie.  "
