The Admirable Crichton

From BBC Radio 4. Written by J.M. Barrie; Full-cast dramatisation.

Liberal aristocrat Lord Loam favours a return to nature, with masters and servants living together as equals, but Crichton is the perfect butler and the perfect snob who adores the intricacies of the class system. He cannot help but be horrified by his master's opinions, and it will take a sea change to alter them.
