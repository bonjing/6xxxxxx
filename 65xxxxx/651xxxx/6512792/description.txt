
Okay, this was well worth the 45 year wait.

Only one blemish in the whole set. They (or he) have found it prudent to remove the 1966 vocals on 'Breezes Of Patchulie' and replace them with vocals that sound like they were recorded 5 minutes ago.

Apart from that the sound on this set is absolutely FANTASTIC.

I've added the missing 5 tracks from this period on a bonus disc.
