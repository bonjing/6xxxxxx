,6patera9,2011-07-06T10:13Z,"Wow you know I have been following the uploads that StyLishSaLH has been doing for some time now since I was lucky enough to run into them. This upload is far from garbage as piratexpirate asserts. Every upload is high quality and well done, especially considering the size of the file. Please judge for yourselves its not like the file size is too big to download and see. I appreciate the work here and my hard drive appreciates the real estate saved. Simply put piratexpirate is very, very wrong. Please see for yourselves."
,6patera9,2011-07-06T10:15Z,On a side note : Take a minute to look at piratexpirate's uploads if you want to see some real garbage work....

I notice that your 9(!) uploads have a minimum 4+GB size, the largest being over 39 GB. Not all of us have blazing fast ISP's and/or unlimited HD space. Yet we still love movies. Go figure. If you don't like 'slumming', why don't you stay uncontaminated up in your gigabyte palace, and just let us be happy with StyLishSaLH rips and the like, which are fine to those of us not putting them on a 102 inch HD plasma. Don't let the door hit you in the ass on your way out, thank you for shopping.
Stylish, Thanks, pal! Always good."
,yargeo,2012-02-09T04:01Z,"Okay. 
Thanks for the rip, size vs quality a good trade to me. Still very watchable to these eyes, and much appreciated:)"
