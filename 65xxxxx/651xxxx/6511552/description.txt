Description

It began, long ago, when Mole abandoned his spring-cleaning and first met Ratty, Badger, Otter and, of course, the exasperating Toad. Now we find the loyal companions approaching the autumn of their lives, reflecting on their many escapades together, and preparing to hand over to the next generation. But, when the future of the River Bank suddenly comes under threat, all the creatures, young and old, must rally together. 

My thanks to JakeTucker
, it appears that these books were published in a different order to that which I had.

The true order should be!

01 The Willows in Wintergrey
02 Toad Triumphant
03 The Willows and Beyond
04 The Willows at Christmas

So many thanks JakeTucker.
