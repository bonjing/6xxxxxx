Release Notes....: Not too sure why but History decided to air this episode letterboxed on their HD channel. The same
		   letterboxing was present in the reair on the original air date. I waited to pre this hoping someone else
		   might have gotten an HD feed through a different source but it doesn't look like that's going to happen. I
		   will see if the Thursday reair is any good and, if so, I'll pre and HD version.
