[W4F PRESENTS]: Surviving.the.Tsunami.WS.PDTV.XviD-W4F

 
[RELEASE DATE]: 2011/07/03

 
[GENRE.......]: Documentary

 
[DESCRIPTION.]:
An excellent and compelling documentary put together by
Japanese broadcaster NHK covering the catastrophic 2011
Japan tsunami. The documentary features extensive original
footage and showcases the stories of human survival behind
the images.

Note: This release uses an unusual resolution, this being due
to a constant news ticker that was cropped out (it was
broadcast on the ABC's news channel). Fortunately this does
not affect the viewing experience, subtitles etc were above
the news ticker.
