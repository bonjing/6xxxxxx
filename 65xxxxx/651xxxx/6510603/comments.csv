[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-02T12:15Z,it really is a shame that you dont provide subs for your foreign torrents.
[V],DownTYU,2011-07-02T12:54Z,Any bluray sub will do...a google search will simply reveal thousand of 'em.

love your work man... and goodfilms your so gay with giving ppl - on quality and telling them what to do. about dupe's etc."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-02T17:36Z,"quality rating is not me, and good advice is good, evilll."
,EViLLL,2011-07-02T18:47Z,sorry then if i whas wrong about the rating ... but i personaly think there's nothing wrong with dupe's as long as its a diffent in ac3 sound or dts and when it dont have foreign lang. like some of your rel's have russian dts audio and thats like 1 gig of wasted space and bw.
