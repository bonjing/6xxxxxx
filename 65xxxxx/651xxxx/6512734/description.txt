THE BEATLES
STARS AND STRIPES
LIVE AT THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL
Remastered Edition
RMW 570 / 571

Pitch, phase and level corrected from HMC 010.

Here is the Remasters Workshop edition of the HMC set, at the right speed and with the phase corrected. (It's twenty years later and I'm still fixing up Yellow Dog releases...)

They did their own dubious editing job on the last track of disc 2 - Long Tall Sally stopped abruptly on Tony Barrow's cassette when the tape ran out. So they edited to the cv, except it was at a different pitch than the concert. That has been fixed here.

Thanks to HS for the scans used to make the artwork.
