           Assigned to accompany two priests on a mission to convert      
           the court of Kublai Khan (Brian Dennehy, "Assault on           
           Precinct 13") to Christianity, Marco Polo (Ian                 
           Somerhalder, "Lost") is abandoned in the mountains when        
           the priests, doubting the very existence of China, turn        
           back. Polo eventually pushes bravely forth alone toward        
           the fabled country where he is accepted as an envoy into       
           Khan's court. Marooned on the far side of the world,           
           Polo, accompanied by his servant, Pedro (B.D. Wong, "Law       
           & Order: SVU"), advances as a Mongol grandee for 20            
           extraordinary years. What he eventually brings back with       
           him to the West is a chronicle that changed history            
           forever. "Marco Polo," a Hallmark Original Movie Event,
