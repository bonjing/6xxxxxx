On January 23, 1997, Tori Amos gave a sell-out benefit concert at the Madison Square Garden Theater in New York to launch "Unlock the Silence," a year-long promotional and fund-raising campaign sponsored by cK Calvin Klein to raise awareness of the extraordinary work undertaken by RAINN, the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, a non-profit organization who offer support and counseling to survivors of sexual assault. 

Tori performs compositions from her three albums, including "Silent All These Years," which appeared on her 1992 debut album "Little Earthquakes" and is the touchstone track for the "Unlock the Silence" campaign.

Featuring Maynard James Keenan, vocalist of Tool.
