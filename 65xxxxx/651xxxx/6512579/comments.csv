As with all my torrents, I aim to keep them alive, if you ever have trouble downloading due to insufficient Seeds, Please let me know and I will start re-seeding a.s.a.p.
I also only upload quality Mp3 Music files at 320Kbps (very lossy) That is my preffered choice.
Always remember that all Torrents are Free and rely on downloaders to keep seeding. So a big thankyou to all who play their part in doing so.
As always, Happy listening, Enjoy :)"
