,M69W,2011-07-17T07:32Z,"interesting remake of the 1970's anime
series "" Star Blazers "" would have been
nice had they also had an English Dub Track : )
the original series was good and spawned
another series called "" Battle Tech ""
also another good one"
,Daniccus,2011-08-01T20:47Z,"m69w, a simple search would show your just making stuff up, star blazers was the bastardized english version of space battleship yamato that was heavily edited and changed around, this is not based on star blazers, it is based on the original source material and a but of its second incarnation, also, battle tech has nothing at all to do with this in anyway and wasnt a spin off of the original or american versions, battle tech is an entirely different entity"
,bullerbase12,2012-04-09T13:39Z,DONT DOWNLOAD THIS CRAP  NO SUBS    
,WinterGale,2012-04-10T19:49Z,"@bullerbase12 hey genius, there's a folder there called SUBS...but I don't think it'll do you much good since you obviously can't read..."
,meth0dman,2012-04-18T18:42Z,"this has by far the fastest download speeds, i'm currently downloading 3 different copies of this, the other two are the italian one and HOPE's. obviously will have to wait and see which is best.."
,claiho,2012-05-13T04:30Z,For the record - it's a movie based on anime series.
