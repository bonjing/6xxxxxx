Since some of you demanded I split the torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6515232/The.Big.Four.SVTPlay-rtmpdump-rip, I decided to do as you please.

Slayer.mp4  is the first of SVTPlays four "episodes" of The Big Four-gig at Ullevi in Gothenburg, Sweden. This is not the same as the gig in Sofia, Bulgaria.
I used the Windows port of RTMPDUMP to rip these. Format is MP4 untouched after rip.
