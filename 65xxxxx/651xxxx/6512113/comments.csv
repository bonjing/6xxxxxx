,trtcmt,2011-07-05T05:00Z,Is the patch supposed to upgrade it to pro? I still get ads after applying the patch
[T],scuba-doo,2011-07-05T16:17Z,"@trtcmt the patch works fine...
make sure trillian is closed after installing, add the patch to install directory and run it...simple "
,Oddobject,2011-07-06T04:17Z,"Worked perfectly.  Patched up to pro, and is now blissfully ad-free.

Thanks a lot guys."
,TRMxKNW,2011-07-06T10:38Z,"Works great, thanks a lot!"
,TinyTana,2011-07-09T01:58Z,"Boo, this one doesn't work for me either. I ran the patch and it said it patched, but I still get Ads in my chat window. :("
,TinyTana,2011-07-09T04:33Z,"Hm, that might have fixed it. What I did was deleted the old trillian.ini and astra.ini from my trillian documents folder (under application data and etc) and went back to the 'no default/default' theme and it SEEMS to have removed ads like that."
,Shadow Master,2011-07-11T14:20Z,I was still getting ads on these past two versions too. You have to replace the talk.dll in order to stop getting the ads.
,TinyTana,2011-07-12T01:32Z,"Shadow Master: Thank you for that info, I found a patch on demonoid that included the patched .exe and a .dll to replace, hopefully that fixes it."
,zeth006,2011-07-14T07:33Z,Where can I get a talk.dll file????
,hiphopjayflick,2011-07-16T10:50Z,please brother upload Screen Clue 2011 Essential Full Setup + Licence Key please brother please please please And Thanks  For Trillian Pro 
,mrhozer,2011-07-25T09:06Z,"I had a nightmare of a time trying to get the patch to work, it kept saying that the file, trillian.exe, was already in use... and it definitely was not.

It wasn't showing up in my task bar, or services, and I restarted multiple times after manually disabling auto startup in windows as well as in Trillian.

What I finally did to get it to work was to change the permissions on trillian.exe so that the user account had full access. After that it worked like a charm. We'll see how long I go without ads, hopefully forever :)  Thank You Uploader!"
,mrhozer,2011-07-26T00:20Z,"Damn, same problem as everyone else... it says I'm pro but I'm still getting ads.

Maybe someone can find out if there is a way to block the a certain IP which communicates to their ad server, or possibly a modification to the ""host"" file on windows. That might be more effective."
,mrhozer,2011-08-01T21:17Z,"Warning!!!!! This contains a tracker, it will gather and try to send data your data/keystrokes to an outside ip address."
,SoundAdviceCT,2011-08-15T08:14Z,"Came up like a dream... a wet one, evenz!  

Used Revo uninstaller to COMPLETELY uninstall previous Trillian installation, then installed an OEM download of the very latest Trillian version (5.0.0.34b, rel. 2011.07.27), then patched before running program.  Came up as PRO, entered my Trillian Name/Password, and we're ready to go!

(Now, if I only had someone that actually wanted to chat with me...)"
,branmcgrady,2011-09-04T06:17Z,"for people having problems with the patch, run as admin .. that is what I did for win 7"
,ElectricWizard485,2011-09-04T08:05Z,"Thanks, so far so good!"
,ruchirrathore,2011-09-11T02:21Z,Installed smoothly in the first go...No problems at all till now... great  upload... million thanks :)
,freedomdwarf,2011-10-07T12:38Z,"For the sake of a few small ads in a chat window, why even risk this sort of torrent?
Trillian is *FREE* from the official developers - nothing is restricted any more.
Latest build is v5.1 build 11 so this one (or the patch) may not even work for FaceBook, G+ or Skype as they have changed the connection.
And unless you buy a Pro license and opt for the cloud sync your info is NOT stored on their servers! The Ads have been greatly reduced too.
Audio/Video/cam doesn't work on most mediums tho so don't be fooled with false claims."
