Nurarihyon no Mago aka Nura: Rise of the Yokai Clan.

Plot:
Rikuo Nura is part human and a quarter yÅkai (demon). Because he is only a quarter yÅkai, Rikuo is able to turn into his yÅkai form only after sunset, when the moon is out; he turns back into his human self when the sun rises. He lives in a house full of spirits along with his yÅkai grandfather. Trying to escape his fate, he does good deeds in order to avoid becoming a yÅkai, despite his grandfather's wish that Rikuo succeed him as master of the Nura yÅkai clan. Rikuo is a different yÅkai because he helps humans. He eventually comes to terms with his demon blood and decides to take up the position of Young Head of the Nura house. Multiple factions aim to stop him or usurp his position, and he must gather friends and allies, a new Hyakki YakÅ under his banner of "Fear".
