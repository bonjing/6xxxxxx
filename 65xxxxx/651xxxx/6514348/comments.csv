Also could you upload this Textbook on PreCalculus by David Cohen which is available for viewing on the site you have directed.Its a very good textbook."
,djh101,2011-07-05T07:46Z,"1. Mount disk and install software (disk must also be mounted whenever you want to use the program).
2. Enter your first and last name and click log in.

After that you just go through the lessons and find what interests you. Each chapter has some video lessons and quizzes and what not.

As for the book, the ebook available on Google is supposedly just a preview so every x number of pages they like to not show a few pages so it wouldn't be the full book. Not only that, but my teacher has told me that a new edition is being released next semester so this book will be outdated, anyway (I'll try to get my calc 1 book up, though, if there's an ebook for it)."
,indiaman,2011-07-05T09:59Z,Thanks for explaining the method of using this package.But can we extract it using PowerISO and then view it.Kindly explain because I have extracted it using PowerISO but don't know how to use it.Please do forgive my ignorance about what may appear a very simple procedure for you.
,djh101,2011-07-05T23:57Z,"Mount the disk in powerISO and it should autorun (if not go into the autorun folder and laungh 'start'). You're not extracting anything from the disk, just using it to install and run the program. Then install it like any other program. Once it is installed, run it like any other program (you can either launch it from the disk, from the desktop shortcut it will create, or from the start menu or whatever."

,djh101,2011-07-07T20:49Z,"Sorry, I upload books as I take the classes. I'll be done with pre-calc in a few weeks, though, and getting my books for next semester so if calc 1 comes with an ebook or anything significantly useful, I'll be sure to upload it."
