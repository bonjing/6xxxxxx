For years you couldn't even get this movie on DVD and the best rip out there was one I made from VHS and released on ed2k.  Then finally it was released on DVD but looked pretty crappy.  I never thought I'd see this film in cinematic quality.  GoodFilms you earned your handle :-)

OK I have to go now, there is a roll of clingwrap to hand and I just saw my neighbours cat walk past my window..."
