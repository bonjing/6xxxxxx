The final installment in this threesome.  This was remade in English (by Veber himself) as "Three Fugitives" a couple of years later, with Nick Nolte, unsurprisingly, in the Depardieu role.

A famous bank robber is released from prison and wants desperately to go straight, but alas his intentions are foiled by one Francois Pignon, a pathetic putz of a wannabe bank robber who puts him in all the wrong places.

The subtitles have some imperfections, but not so very distracting. It has a choice of two audios, French 2.0 and 5.1.  A few trailers as extras, and that's it.
