Product Description: Experts in the UK advise us to eat two portions of fish each week, one of them being an oily fish such as salmon or tuna. Fish has long been considered beneficial to the health, making a delicious meal that is low in harmful saturated fats and, in the case of oily fish, high in omega-3 fatty acids. These essential fatty acids have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and lower blood pressure. "Hamlyn All Colour Cookbook: 200 Fab Fish Dishes" provides an array of delicious ideas for introducing more fish and seafood to your diet, including recipes for starters, soups, main courses and barbecues.
