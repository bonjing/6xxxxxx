

Kiss Symphony: Alive IV is a 2003 live album from Kiss performing with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.
The arrangements were made by David Campbell, who also conducted the MSO. It is the group's fourth album in the Alive series
and first release under Kiss Records and Sanctuary Records. The album featured three of the original members of Kiss
(Peter Criss, Paul Stanley, and Gene Simmons). Ace Frehley once again left the band and the concert featured for the first time
a replacement musician, Tommy Thayer, dressed as Ace Frehley's "Spaceman".

Back in 2000, Kiss was to release the original Alive IV (Featuring the original re-united lineup) but, due to label politics
and contracts, it was not to be. Even with the artwork being revealed[1] and "Rock and Roll All Nite" (from Alive IV)
being added to the Kiss Box Set, the album was shelved. The band then moved labels from Universal/Island to Sanctuary Music
and they released Alive IV - Kiss Symphony. However the original Alive IV was indeed released when the band released the box set
of all past Alive albums entitled Kiss Alive! 1975-2000 in 2006. The album is not called Alive IV, but rather ALIVE:
The Millennium Concert.

The members of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra who accompanied Kiss during this performance wore makeup that mimicked
the band members. At the same time they also wore tuxedos.
