 With the evolution in data storage, large databases have stimulated researchers from many areas, especially machine learning and statistics, to adopt and develop new techniques for data analysis in different fields of science. In particular, there have been notable successes in the use of statistical, computational, and machine learning techniques to discover scientific knowledge in the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, and astronomy. With the recent advances in ontologies and knowledge representation, automated scientific discovery (ASD) has further, great prospects in the future.
