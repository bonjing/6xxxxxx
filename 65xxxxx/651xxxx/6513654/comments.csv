Like dressing in leather, smelling smelly socks, licking feet, whipping or being whipped, liking fat girls or guys, and all the other crazy things out there that turn people on.
I'm not gay, but I have boy+ girl+ tranny threesomes in my collection, and I'd rather watch extra pair of boobies than one less pair of boobies if I'm watching DP scene.
Not into tranny+guy vids without girl tho, but thanks anyway for upload dodger."

If you don't understand something then you can't honestly insult it.  period.  So move the fuck on.  For the record though, many who are attracted to transsexuals are bisexual or bi-curious (if you think about that it makes sense that a bisexual man might appreciate the softness/beauty of a woman with the junk of a man), but many are also straight men who are into the taboo of it and not hung up on the whole ""does this make me gay"" insecure bullshit, and (though you will obviously never admit this is possible) some are straight men who just like women and don't care about what is between the legs (though the guys downloading this porn clearly come from the first two groups).  You seem close minded to me and therefore unlikely to accept the idea (though it is backed by a decent amount of scientific research) that a transsexual really is a woman that happened to be born with a male body, therefore you will never ""get it"" so why waste your time trying.  Just move on and let those who like it enjoy themselves.  The world would be a truly boring place if everyone had exactly the same tastes in everything.  I would not try to convince you to like transsexuals, and you should not try to convince the many thousands of men who like them not to (they are very very popular, way more so than gay porn so explain that).  If you came here and stated that you ""just don't understand"" the attraction and left it at that, that would be understandable, but, when you admit to not understanding and insult at the same time, you make yourself look like an ignorant fool."

With all respect Man, you gotta learn to respect other people's fetishes and sexual fantasies. Besides noone was harmed while filming it ;)

besides if you have the time and patience to read my 'elaborate' answer on shemale porn and the debate that followed it, then see this thread:-

for some strange reason I just read that whole thread you mentioned and I dont see how you could have been banned for it.....you just asked a question.  Easy to see how a couple others got banned on there but why you?  or did you get banned for something else?  Also, why do I care?"
