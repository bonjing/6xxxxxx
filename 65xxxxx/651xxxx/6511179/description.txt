Witchfinder General - Export Cut - DVDRiP

Starring: Vincent Price, Ian Ogilvy and Rupert Davies 

The year is 1645 - the middle of the English Civil War. Matthew Hopkins (Vincent Price), an opportunist and witchhunter, takes advantage of the breakdown in social order to impose a reign of terror on East Anglia. Hopkins and his assistant, John Stearne (Robert Russell), visit village after village, brutally torturing confessions out of suspected witches. They charge the local magistrates for the work they carry out.

This is the Export Cut of the movie. It has the added violence from the Director's Cut plus some additional brief shots of nudity from certain sequences.
