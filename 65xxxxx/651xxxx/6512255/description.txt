Harrison Mixbus v2.0.3 MAC OSX


Mixbusâ„¢ is a full-featured Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) with "True Analog Mixing"â„¢: a combination of Harrison's world-renowned sound and features in a knob-per-function interface. Mixbusâ„¢ provides a solution for engineers and mixers who need a recorder, editor and mixing system with world-class sound and features.

Traditional DAW mixers were designed by companies with no pedigree in music mixing. Harrison consoles are known for their great-sounding EQ, filters, dynamics, and bus summing on every track. Now Mixbus offers every engineer a real Harrison music console "in the box". With Mixbus's logical knob-per-function interface, the user works with the fluidity of a traditional analog recording studio while retaining the convenience of a DAW. Mixbus enables the user to record, edit, and mix a musical performance "in the box" but get a sound that rivals the golden age of album recordings.
