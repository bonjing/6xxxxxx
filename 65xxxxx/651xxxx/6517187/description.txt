NOTES:



IMAGiNE bringing you another release.......... Transformers 3 Dark Of The Moon



Right heres a custom made dvdr off the sweet source files we had ;-)

Firstly the sources.....the main body of the film is from the same source as our xvid release and the

ending,well after credit scene and some of the credits is off the syncmaster release.

The quality does drop for the after scene credit as its from a lower Q release but at least you have a fully

complete release now and we also cleaned it up.

Back onto the main bosy of this release.....firstly we have to use a quad filter to level it up and crop all non video

off it,then from there we had cut the intro off and do that differently as there was a shift in the video and then append

it back at the end.The rest there was hardly any camera movement so it was a case of changing the rgb colours,fixing contrast

and brightness levels along with the chroma,sharpness etc.....

Once done we then had to resize the syncmaster cam and crop the thin borders top and bottom and filter it and then append that to

the main video.....yes AR goes sligthly out on that end scene otherwise the black borders would have changed and got alot thicker.

Now onto the audio.....we had to use the syncmaster cam audio to make it complete so we added that to our line,then it was a case of

relaying it over the video,99% of it was insync but for some reason a part wasn't near the end so re-corrected that and finally ...

we cut the audio @ 1hr 54mins to 2hrs 14mins and boosted the volume on that part by 250% to it matches the rest as most of you now

know ( who grabbed the xvid ) that there was an audio drop ...still nice but alot lower sounding.

Finally once all done and fix we converted to AC3 to fit better with the dvdr :P
