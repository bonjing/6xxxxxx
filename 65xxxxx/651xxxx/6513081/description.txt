ROCK OF AGES ON BROADWAY 
Product Description
 Rock Of Ages is a Tony nominated smash hit musical comedy currently running on Broadway and starring American Idol's Constantine Maroulis and Amy Spanger. In 1987 on the Sunset Strip, a small-town girl met a big-city dreamer - and in L.A.'s most legendary rock club, they fell in love to the greatest songs of the '80s. It's a hilarious feel-good love story told through the hit songs (including several medleys / live mash-ups) of iconic rockers Journey, Styx, REO Speedwagon, Foreigner, Pat Benatar, Whitesnake, and many more. The album was mixed by Michael Barbiero (Appetite For Destruction, ...And Justice For All).
