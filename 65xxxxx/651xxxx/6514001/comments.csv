[T],MelloYello,2011-07-04T05:52Z,"@VikingNor - It says JOIN and there won't be RAR's directly from their site.  This torrent is in RAR's.  People read that and don't understand what they read for some reason.

But anyways this torrent is fucked up.  File is corrupted."
,Otaku1,2011-07-04T06:07Z,FAKE!  Don't download.
,chloe2011,2011-07-04T06:24Z,"For the first time EVER, Winrar failed to open a rar file for me.  It said that that this file was corrupt.  Has anybody gotten this torrent to open?  If so, how?"
,VampireMuffinMan,2011-07-04T06:42Z,"Remove this junk please...  If it's corrupted, why leave it up?"
