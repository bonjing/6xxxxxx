THE BEATLES
BACKYARD SPOOL
Remastered Edition
RMW 057 (2004)



Acetates declicked; pitch, phase and level corrected at Remasters Workshop 2004 from Masterdisc 013 (1999).

Not circulated since 2005, this remaster features eight mid-late-period acetates, all meticulously declicked, and very high quality recordings of some other familiar material. The last track, Not Guilty is a forgery, with jarring edits back and forth between the two stereo mixes, to create a different version... for what purpose, I'm not sure. There is, however, a well-done composite of all of the bits of You Know My Name from both the mono single and the stereo Anthology version. Overall, a very nice-sounding disc.
