Storyline: Two people who can't stand each other are forced to care for the same child in this domestic comedy drama starring Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel. Holly (Heigl) is a caterer whose career is just getting off the ground; Eric (Duhamel) directs sports for a major network. Their first date was a nightmare, and now they're about to become a family. When their goddaughter Sophie's parents both perish in a tragic accident, Holly and Eric are informed that they were singled out as Sophie's caretakers in the event of an unforeseen disaster. Now, in order to raise Sophie right, this bickering pair must put their differences aside while mastering the fine art of parenthood. Coordinating their new lives and getting along won't be easy for Eric and Holly, but somewhere between the conflicting schedules and drastic lifestyle changes, the reluctant couple realizes that with a help from Sophie, they're starting to resemble a real family. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi
