Alan Watt is a long-term researcher into the causative forces behind major changes in historical development.  Born in Scotland, he watched the subtleties of politics and media as they guided the population of the U.K. covertly into a European Amalgamation.  He has been warning the North American people for some years now that the same process of amalgamation is being carried out.  

With historical documentation, he shows how cultures are created and altered by those in control, always to lead the people like sheep into the next pasture.  Rather than simply stating current events and details, Alan attempts to deprogram the listener and reader of his works.  He has authored three books, made available CD's and has just completed a DVD on these topics.  He spent a good part of his life in the music industry and has had poetical works published by major university presses, mainly under a pseudonym.
