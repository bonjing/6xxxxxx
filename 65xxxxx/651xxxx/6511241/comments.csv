,sarsapil,2011-07-13T22:08Z,"Thanks. Could you possibly get The Beast Must Die 
1974 with Peter Cushing? I hope you can..."
[T],bitstreeem,2011-07-14T03:18Z,"Howdy,

I don't usually up rips that are already here on The Bay, but the one copy is not seeded well so I'm going to go ahead and rip The Beast must Die and post when it's done.

Weekend Warriors is proving to be a tough one to get, but I'm not done trying yet!

Thanks!"
