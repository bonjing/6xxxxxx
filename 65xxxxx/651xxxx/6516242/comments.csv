,quinnjin,2012-02-27T06:07Z,"Hello ... have the file 100 % apparently, they ar in rars, but a couple have the ""!ut"" symbol which I thought meant a file that was still downloading... , and winrar can't unpack quite a few of them, rendering the whole thing useless for me... Have checked and it says everything 100 % downloaded... Can't figure this out..."
