,spina27,2011-07-06T20:53Z,Good copy only not in english! I cant believe there still isn't an english copy of MONTE CARLO let alone a copy of BAD TEACHER or Mr poppers penguins?? But transformers was uploaded same day??
,ZenRhino,2011-07-07T02:14Z,"Transformers had its world premiere in Russia... so it makes sense that a copy got out quickly. But you're right, no copy of this let alone Bad Teacher & Mr. Popper's Penguins... I don't get it."
