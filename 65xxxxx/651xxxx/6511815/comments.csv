,ShadowMastr,2011-08-18T02:26Z,so does that mean it won't run at all on win 7 64 bit unless we're in xp mode?? gack....
,SonOFBaldr,2011-10-12T07:31Z,"@ShadowMastr   I got this from the sandboxie website;
 ""Starting with version 3.44, Sandboxie offers full support for 64-bit editions of Windows Vista with Service Pack 1, and Windows 7.
The downloadable installer package SandboxieInstall.exe contains both 32-bit and 64-bit editions of Sandboxie. To install Sandboxie, simply run the installer package, and it will automatically select the appropriate edition of Sandboxie.
Note that some editions of 64-bit Windows 7 can also run the 32-bit edition of Sandboxie in Windows XP Mode.
Full disclosure: The 64-bit edition of Sandboxie provides a reduced level of protection, compared to the 32-bit edition of Sandboxie, unless the Experimental Protection mode is enabled. "" (end quote)
SO.. I assume since this is a newer version than stated above in the quote, it should work for us. I am dl it now.. .will let you know if it doesn't.
