""Crysis 2 MOD SDK"" is mod tools
""Crysis 2 Sandbox Editor 3"" is the map editor


""CryEngine 3 SDK"" ... will come August as planned, an equivalent to UDK."

well, it seems that crytek is working overtime,
this torrent has the sandbox 3 editor and Mod sdk.

search ""Crysis 2 mod sdk"" and the first website that you will see should be crytek announcing the mod sdk, sandbox 3 editor and dedicated server."

sorry misunderstood your comment,
this is the crysis 2 sdk not the ""cryengine 3"" sdk.
the cryengine 3 sdk will be coming out in august and hopefully i will upload that and other crysis 2 mods and maps.

check my page:""http://thepiratebay.org/user/ka40"", for the latest (best) crysis/crysis 2 mods and maps."
