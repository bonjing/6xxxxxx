,radische,2011-07-09T02:52Z,"Installed Win 7 Starter on an older HP Laptop (dv1520us). The install worked perfectly. However, the OS would NOT activate. I did this only as a test on an unused hard drive, and will not be keeping the OS on the machine (Win XP is now back on the machine using the hard drive that belongs in the machine) so that problem does not bother me at all, but I am disappointed in the lack of activation."
,brackile,2011-07-09T20:16Z,Do i need a key during installation or i leave it blank?
,pkisme,2011-08-03T09:17Z,"so, in the end, does it auto-activate or not? :)

hope to clean install win 7 on my acer aspire laptop"
,dublea2,2011-09-14T21:31Z,How is this OEM when you've preactivated the shit?  Lame
,reactii0n,2011-09-17T08:27Z,I see Acer but not Gateway or eMachines but I'm going to download this anyway assuming it will work since Acer owns them both.
,pc-addict,2011-10-07T13:09Z,"This is just what i need being a PC Technician but how can this be OEM when there isnt a need to enter the product key? The product key is on the the green sticker which is entered using an OEM install to activate, if this DVD is activated without entering a product key how can this be legal? Please expalin as my business has to be legal. Thanks"
,Nobahd,2012-02-17T19:08Z,"@pc-addict are you retarded? for one if your looking for legal software and your a computer shop owner or worker you shouldnt be on this site and with that said yes this can be a OEM cd with a alrdy ativated KEY if you are a real computer tech you would know most companys IE Dell, Gateway give you a OS CD that doesnt need a Key they are factory disc i first noticed this when i got my first pc from Dell back in 1997 and the OS Cd worked on all my friends computers without a key"
,Hitech411,2012-06-14T06:06Z,This wouldn't burn with MagicISO without giving corrupted 'install.wim' file. ImgBurn worked okay. Also people say UltraISO is a good burning program.
