This is a Windows 7 disk similar to Original Multi XP "System Builders" multi OEM.

Starter (x86 only)

___________________________________


Reason I made this disk was because I could not find a "System Builders" version of Multi OEM Win7 online. All versions I found had various things added or removed and that didn't suit my needs.

It will not apply any kind of crack or loader to Windows, if it cannot find a matching Slic 2.1 bios it will not activate. This is strictly designed to reduce a technicians need to keep multiple copies of Win7 around for the most common manufacturer's they would see.


This disk will activate automatically for the following manufacturers:


Acer
Alienware
Asus
BenQ
Dell
Founder
FSC
Fujitsu
HP
Lenovo
MSI
Samsung
Sony
Toshiba



-----THIS DISC WILL PROMPT FOR A SERIAL KEY DURING INSTALLATION....JUST CLICK NEXT WITHOUT ENTERING ONE...KEY IS ADDED LATER VIA script-----
