THE BEATLES
VINYL TO THE CORE
Remastered Edition

Details:


The "Vinyl To The Core" project was originally a mail tree in 1999. I was afforded an opportunity to go over the files first, and the Remastered Edition came out of that. It coexisted in circulation with the non-remastered version. These three discs were traded by mail, and then posted on Usenet once, no later than 2002. Unless it lives on someone's blog, this is one of those issues that a lot of people may have heard of, but never have seen.

It was very early days at the Workshop, and not having heard these discs in many years, I was expecting to find room for improvement. Actually, there wasn't much wrong with the sound or the discs in the first place. This time around, I did phase correction on the very few stereo recordings, and fixed the pitch of a few tracks. The majority of the contents needed no adjustment.

These recordings were extracted without incident from the original Kodak Gold (Mitsui) CD-Rs. They still have adhesive labels which have not eaten through the data layer yet. It has been on my to-do list for quite some time to back up this set to new discs before they became unplayable, and now it's done.
