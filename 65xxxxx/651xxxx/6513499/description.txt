From Wiki:



Grease is an 1978 American musical film directed by Randal Kleiser and based on Warren Casey's and Jim Jacobs's 1971 musical of the same name about two lovers in a 1950s high school. The film stars John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Stockard Channing, and Jeff Conaway. It was successful both critically and at the box office; its soundtrack album ended 1978 as the second-best selling album of the year in the United States, behind the soundtrack of Saturday Night Fever, another film starring Travolta.






Grease - Remastered Deluxe Edition 2003


Grease: The Original Soundtrack from the Motion Picture is the original motion picture soundtrack for the 1978 film Grease released by Polydor Records and originally by RSO Records. The song "You're the One That I Want" was a US and UK #1 for stars John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.

The soundtrack was released in April 1978, two months ahead of the film's release.[1] The cover gives credit to, and prominently features, the two stars of the film - John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John - although they only appear on seven of the 24 tracks. The remainder of the album is sung by various cast members and Sha Na Na - a group who performed many of the 1950s numbers in the film. The title track was recorded by Frankie Valli, who had no other connection with the film.

The most successful songs from the soundtrack were written specifically for the film. They included the Billboard number-one hits "You're the One That I Want", "Grease" and the number-three, Academy Award-nominated "Hopelessly Devoted to You".[2] In the UK, the album proved even more successful where "You're the One That I Want" reached No.1 for nine weeks, "Summer Nights" reached No.1 for seven weeks, while "Grease", "Hopelessly Devoted to You" and "Sandy" all became top three hits.[3][4][5][6] The soundtrack album hit the top of the charts in the U.S. during the summer of 1978, replacing The Rolling Stones' Some Girls. In the UK, it remained at the top of the charts for 13 consecutive weeks.[7]

Two of the bass players who recorded on the Grease soundtrack were (at different times) members of Toto. One of these, David Hungate, also performed on Olivia Newton-John's album Totally Hot with Toto guitarist Steve Lukather. Other musicians here have previously worked with Elton John, Steely Dan, The Bee-Gees and others.

The album sold 28 million copies worldwide

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic rated the soundtrack four-and-a-half stars. He stated that "the originals hold up better than the '50s tunes", but that they "are so giddily enjoyable" "that everything works." He also said that "the sleek pop production the movie's soundtrack boasts and the cast's enthusiastic performances go a long way in making this Grease the definitive Grease."


The CD of the soundtrack has been released twice in the US. In April 1991 it was released as a single disc replicating the sequence of the original 1978 LP. In September 2003 it was released by PolyGram as a 2-CD digitally-remastered "Deluxe Edition" containing additional tracks. As with the LP and single-disc CD, the songs are not presented in the order replicating their appearances in the movie.
