Dino Gangs
For years, scientists concluded that Tyrannosaurs like the T-Rex were solitary creatures because their skeletons were found alone. Now, leading paleontologist Dr. Phil Currie believes that Tyrannosaurs were cooperative pack animals that hunted in terrifying gangs. This major new discovery, and Dr. Currie's radical theory, are the subject of the new special DINO GANGS, Currie's theory is based on new evidence from a remote corner of Mongolia, where paleontologists have unearthed the remains of 90 Tarbosaurus dinosaurs - the Chinese T-Rex -- in one region of the Gobi Desert. Dr. Currie believes that many of them, found close together, were part of a single social group.
With exclusive access to his research, DINO GANGS follows Dr. Currie on a global quest from the dinosaur graveyards of the Gobi Desert to the wilds of the African Kalahari. To prove his theory, the special uses cutting-edge animation and powerful computer generated imagery to immerse viewers into Tyrannosaurs' mysterious lives. Using CT scans of a Tyrannosaur skull, the special shows how it is possible to build a 3D model of the Tyrannosaur's brain, blood vessels and nerves. DINO GANGS could change our understanding of dinosaurs forever, by revealing that Tyrannosaurs were more intelligent -- and far more deadly -- than we had ever imagined.
