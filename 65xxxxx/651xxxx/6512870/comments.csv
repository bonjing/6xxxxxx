,kidderxl5,2011-07-03T18:25Z,Just downloaded the nfo file and it says this film is The.Amityville.Horror.2005.DVDrip.XviD-DVL probably a fake unless someone wants to risk d/loading and prove me wrong.
[T],artpepper,2011-07-03T19:12Z,"When it comes to recent releases that everyone wants, the wisest policy is to wait until a trusted uploader posts it. The time-lag between a legit copy being released in the wild and a known uploader posting it on TPB is negligible. This one looks like bullshit to me."

,EdmAddict,2011-08-07T22:26Z,"Haha! Why are you all complaining like you bought an fake copy? I really can't see the harm done here... 
He uploads fake torrents probably to see how many stupid people there are out there;)"
