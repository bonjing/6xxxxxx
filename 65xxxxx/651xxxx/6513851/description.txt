       WHITESNAKE (David Coverdale)  -  Soldier Of Fortune  (unplugged)



      "Soldier of Fortune", a song by Deep Purple from their 1974 album "Stormbringer", covered by Opeth, Black Majesty and Whitesnake. In the Jerry Bloom biography, "Black Knight", former lead guitarist Ritchie Blackmore says of "Soldier Of Fortune" it is "one of my favorite songs. It's got a few of those mediaeval chords." This slow, sentimental ballad was co-written with new vocalist David Coverdale for the first album by Deep Purple Mark Three. Unfortunately, the rest of the band didn't like the song, but Blackmore continued to play it after leaving the supergroup, including with Blackmore's Knight, where the soft feminine voice of Candice Night although obviously not as fitting as David Coverdale's, does not sound out of place.
