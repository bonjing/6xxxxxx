,beaujoulais,2011-07-04T23:35Z,"Hi Zlatko, 
As I mentioned at your conversation in the comments a #005, you must be a Croatian or close to Croatia located person. Nice - you're welcome ...
To the subject: I once had a Croatian girl friend (about 1975) who loved the music from a famous Croatian group: Bijelo Dugme ... and the best and most popular song I remember was Kad bi bio bijelo dugme ... do you have a video from this pretty nice song from 1974 ? Would be real great !
Hope to be able to help you once, too.

"
,dehou,2011-07-09T18:21Z,"beaujoulais: by part 5 you mean the new or the old one? there no leechers for parts 5 (old one), 6 or 58"
,beaujoulais,2011-07-09T20:05Z,"you can find the torrents via downloading 
""research @ series ''GREATEST HITS - THE BEST OF '60 and '70"" - start them & you see the state ... 
I'm complete with this great collection with the exception of #5 & 6, both between 60 and 70% (and teh lost or forgotten #23 & 108).
All the old ones ... 
When complete I'll forward it to a special friend as a birthday present ... so it should be befor 2011-07-20.
Because of restricted law in Germany, I'll almost only ul & dl promos - no DVD rips and no MP3 & FLAC CDs at all - big brother is wathching us ... stay clean.
You're a real great frined !"
,beaujoulais,2011-07-09T21:36Z,"@dehou: you could also create a folder and put in the torrents for #5 and #6, then create a folder-torrent and ul them like I did with the ""research - ..."" torrent."
