Fanny and Alexander is one of the best movies I saw (along with Oxen 1991 
from Sweden too) at a special theater in the University of Alberta neighbournood
where such movies were specially brought in for the academic crowd in particular
at the time - as third world multicultural ideas instead had few friends openly
displaying such a preference back then.

It is a great thrill to have to endure sitting through the full lenght of this
feature, as the children of Sweden are in fact a gift from god to all the earth!

What great beauty of spirit, what joy in seeing them in their expressions
of the most naturally beautiful human intelligence, one could concieve of.
It is a real joy indeed. There can be no better substitute for such minds than
to be fully surrounded by their own - completely so - in a way as to give
comfort, security, and nourishment to the mind and spirit equally - along with
all the resources that would be required to make it as god intended - the very
best possible - based on the merits already inherent within.

Do buy a Volvo eh! (if you can look like you do really own it with right 
enough pride)

May god save the people of Sweden from any ideas of being over-run that are
at present a problem all around europe in what are alien ways of existing
by any sense of relative comparison whatever.

PS The 13GB version on the net doesnt give you any better audio in what
is the Swedish language track - although it does offer Russian in addition.
So why not settle for this one here with nice enough video too!


Subtitles included for English, Danish, Spanish, Russian - please post
others if you are able to contribute equally - perhaps using the 
included English SRT file folder as a template starting point
