,metalhue,2011-07-08T17:51Z,"Burn onto a DL DVD (ISO-file) watch on a bluray player, or use daemon tools to access the file or mount it as an dvd/bluray drive, and go to folder BDMV\STREAM and use the M2TS file in VLC Player"
,fatallion,2011-07-09T12:34Z,"ok, found the m2ts file and got it to working! thanks a lot!"

,gdrbsg,2011-08-12T11:58Z,"hi, i have a weird problem. the audio is playing at normal speed, but the video is playing at half the speed. i have tried it with vlc media player and smplayer"
,SakuraBlack,2011-09-20T14:10Z,"Audio: AC3 5.1ch 48khz 640kbps not 384kbps, but is crap not real 5.1.
I think this show deserve better quality sound 
Thanks!"
,FentonSpadrig,2012-05-05T16:45Z,"You have really chosen the worst sound available. This ""fake"" 5.1 is not funny at all, and I feel that it ruins the complete show. 

For me its now more worth checking the tracks at YouTube, as its the stereo audio there. This ""fake 5.1 audio"" does so that only the mail vocals and the orchestra can be heard. Honestly: It sucks! 

Video: 8/10.
Audio: 2/10."
