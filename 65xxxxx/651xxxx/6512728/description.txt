PAUL McCARTNEY
"B" SIDES HIMSELF
Remastered Edition
Remasters Workshop
RMW 701

Dynamics restored, declicked, pitch, phase and levels corrected at Remasters Workshop June 22, 2011 from the CD on FAB 2 (1996).

It's odd that in a collection of non-LP tracks, with so many to choose from, there are four unreleased recordings here. But oh well, such is the nature of these compilations.

This was the first issue of these tracks in this order. In 1997, the FAB CD was reissued on Hawg Leg 130 with no changes, simply as "B" Sides.

All the tracks ran at the wrong speed - some fast, some slow (quite slow!). It looks like the tracks are not straight from vinyl, but from cassette recordings of vinyl, (except the outtakes, which are probably extracted from other CDs of tape sources) because they were all horribly out of phase. This suggests tape recordings, as they don't make records that way. On most of the tracks, the right channel was overdriven into clipping. That's fixed now. I think I got all the clicks off all the records... it's a very nice listen now.
