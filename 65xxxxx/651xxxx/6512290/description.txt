 Semiotics, a well established discipline of signs and their use in human and computer communications, is increasingly recognized as important to understanding information systems and computing in general. This important new resource examines a set of semiotic methods for information systems development. Kecheng Liu offers well balanced coverage of recent theoretical investigations and practical applications. He introduces the MEASUR approach for requirements elicitation, analysis, and representation and illustrates the methods in three major case studies. In these cases he demonstrates how information systems can be developed to meet business requirements and to support business objectives.
