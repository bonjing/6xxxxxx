The Welfare Poets are an Afro-Caribbean Hip Hop band that was established in 1990 by Ray Ramirez and Hector Rivera at Cornell University. They have toured the United States, Puerto Rico, South America and across Europe. The Welfare Poets play Hip Hop with a fusion of Jazz and various styles from the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico, Cuba and Jamaica, complimented with lyrical content concerning social, political and, ecological issues which has made their music urgently relevant for past 20 years. They released their first studio album " Project Blues" in 2000 to critical acclaim. They then followed up in 2005 with the genre bending and thought provoking album "Rhymes For Treason" which gave the world "Sak Pase", "Freedom", and "The Media". In 2009 they released a tour de force entitled "Warn Them", an epic 16 song opus which brought the group back to their hip hop roots.
