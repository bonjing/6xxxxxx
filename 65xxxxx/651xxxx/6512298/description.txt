The current version of my Lady Gaga live-appearances collection.
This includes all of her appearances on TV shows, radio programs and assorted special events when she played a song or few. Also includes a few appearances where she played longer sets, such as 2009 summer festivals.

I've included everything I can (for instance, no audio sources exist for some early performances, at least that I'm aware of.)

Audio-only, nearly all MP3, a lot 128kbps but some higher

Metadata:

Artist tag - "Lady Gaga"
Album tag - "YYYY.MM.DD - Performance Name/Location" 
* This date system means that they will sort chronologically, and in a separate section from other Lady Gaga content. Since I was able to date them in this manner, they also all have the proper year in the 'date' field.
Genre tag is 'Pop'.
I put in songwriter credits under the various songwriters' birth names.

Thanks to those who sourced the files - I just collected & collated them, and harmonized the metadata as described above.
