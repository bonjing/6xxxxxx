Why use key-changer?
1. So you don't have to go offline while changing key files.
2. You don't need to type that 1111-1111... serial code everytime.

Just drag and drop the key file on the window and be done!

Requirement:
------------
Kaspersky folks have a habit of black-listing every key changer or trial-resetter program as false-positive virus.
So, I'm not supplying any .exe file but a simple autohotkey script (.ahk)
in order to use this .ahk file, you must FIRST Install autohotkey from following site

And then 3 easy steps:
----------------------
1. delete the old license.

3. drag and drop the key file

DONE!
