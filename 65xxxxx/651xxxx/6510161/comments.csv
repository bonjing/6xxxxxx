,Crazy-Scamp,2011-07-03T18:35Z,this has been around for ages ... why name it 2012 version?
,ekarth22,2011-07-04T18:21Z,"@Crazy-Scamp

Kaspersky 2011 and 2012 use different registry settings, hence 2011 keychanger won't work on 2012. so new keychanger with modified code."

,sanvar,2011-07-19T14:36Z,@ekarth22: AutoHotkey has some virus kaspersky is deleting it
,waree,2011-07-22T01:01Z,"Works well, hope the key won't be blacklisted too soon.
Tried trial resetter but after 10mn the second trial ended !"
,ekarth22,2011-08-01T06:28Z,"@Sanvar,
I assure you there is no virus. Kaspersky false-detecting."

[V],Anacondaz,2011-08-09T16:03Z,"+1 rep
for another great upload mate"
,oldbone,2011-08-30T13:58Z,"It`s not working for me. If i drop the key file to the window it says:

Error: Failed attempt to launch program or document:
Action 
.......
.......
............
-->017:RunWait,%find_install_folder%avp.com......"
,yhanzee,2011-09-15T08:29Z,what's next after the drag and drop process?? how will i activate the code without going offline??
,ekarth22,2011-09-22T19:28Z,"@oldbone, what's your OS? it is tested on XP. May or may not work in Win7.

@yhnzee
it automatically activates once you drag and drop the key file. you don't have to do anything."
,JFromM,2011-10-31T04:11Z,"do you have any idea how affordable Kaspersky is when it goes on sale? newegg had a rebate on last month that got you Kaspersky IS PURE 2012 for FREE. cmon people, dont be so cheap. antivirus is the MOST important software you should pay for. save yourselves the trouble, and with the best AV, youll detect any viruses in the rest of these torrents"
,KnightZero217,2011-11-15T10:18Z,"its not very practical to buy av since it doesnt assure you 100% security.
and btw, every AV has different definitions and database so it means they have different findings of whether a file is a virus or not. Also, AV makers are the ones who started to make those viruses just to earn money."
,rambo180,2011-12-13T14:57Z,"Worked perfectly for me... same as 2011 key changer, thanks!!"
,IzekielReige,2012-03-06T15:48Z,"Downloaded this on March 6th, no issues, no virus warnings and it worked great. The man gave the people what they asked for a working non-exe file and for that I thank you.
