,tavery80,2011-07-05T09:39Z,Ok...so why is right side cropped off?  It's impossible to show the whole film in any viewer.  Let alone a WDTV player.  What gives?
,RemuxarN,2011-07-06T01:25Z,"Thanks for telling, didn't notice. Im going to remux and reupload this one. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS REALEASE "
,RemuxarN,2011-07-06T19:53Z,I'm home now and did check the movie for any errors but there arent any. Try redownloading. NOTHING WRONG WITH THE TORRENT IGNORE MY PREVIOUS COMMENT
,MajorMayhem,2011-07-21T01:07Z,Is the alternate ending with the timetravel to the future in this version or is it the ending in the store?
,NetDrebin,2012-02-16T17:32Z,Thanks for the torrent it is watchable but tavery80 is right.
