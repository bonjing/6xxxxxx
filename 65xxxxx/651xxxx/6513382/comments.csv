,miguelsz3,2011-07-04T14:42Z,"lol, that was the other dudes upload. This ones real and clean. =/"
,miguelsz3,2011-07-04T15:11Z,"Oh and by the way..... I was infected with the same installer you downloaded........ I was pissed that it infected my pc. I tried to report him but he was already banned..... So I just decided, I minus well upload a proper copy.

P.S.
Why reformat your pc? I used a rescuse disk and that seemed to clean my pc up from all the trash."
