,dee60,2011-07-07T16:53Z,"@culleo
get Bit Che at http://www.convivea.com/
You'll find 1 or 2 links there after you do a search."

,BoonesFerry,2011-07-08T04:56Z,"@err00014 as usuall, you Rock!

@dee60, installing an application that might be full of spyware just so you can search for torrent files...that's one of the dumbest things I've heard all day. There are plenty of online torrent search sites that already check multiple sites....no need for a program/application. LAME!!!

@culleo I found the movie you're looking for at ten different torrent sites...however, the torrent is a password protected FAKE. Bummer. Maybe a new torrent will surface after the movie is released on DVD. "
,etornam,2011-07-09T08:21Z,i thought there are 13 episodes? where can i find the last one ? 
,etornam,2011-07-09T08:22Z,perhaps it not aired yet.. thanks err0001
,culleo,2011-07-09T13:26Z,"@dee60 thanks...will try that one.

@BoonesFerry 
yes, tried that one too, unfortunately it's fake.
thanks again..it should be in DVD copy now, movie was shown last april 2011 though. thanks again"
