A=9
V=10"
,Darkbebop,2011-07-09T01:02Z,"ok Update here , Ep 11 and 12 will not work for me, im not sure if the video's don't work or my computer wont run."
,DarkMario616,2011-07-12T05:18Z,"I fucking hate people that say video is 10 when at least half the episodes are all pixely.

Audio: 10, perfect.
Video: 6, most episodes all fuzzy."
,Hidendra,2011-07-13T20:07Z,"Epi 6 confirmed to not have sound in left channels. Epis 11 and 12 also will not work (I am using VLC.)

Subs: 10 (if anyone was wondering.)
Audio: 10
Video: 9
I didn't have much of any issues with pixely artifacts, just the missing segments (I watched epi 6, 11, 12 elsewhere..)"
,Hidendra,2011-07-15T04:44Z,"also, anime itself was excellent. Highly recommended!"
,themanuel08,2011-07-18T01:23Z,ppl use Media Player Classic
,Pothead808,2011-08-08T09:42Z,"What a shame, the first 4 or 5 episodes are AWESOME quality for the size, then everyone after that is pixelated to hell. Am I doing something wrong? Using MPC with all the codecs, it isn't any better in VLC either..."
,Luvnarg,2011-11-15T04:34Z,No subtitles.
,ThatLankyBastard,2012-02-06T02:10Z,"Love the show, had no problems downloading or watching (so far)...
