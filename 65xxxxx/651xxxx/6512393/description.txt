THE COMPLETE 1932-1940 BRUNSWICK, COLUMBIA AND MASTER RECORDINGS OF DUKE ELLINGTON AND HIS FAMOUS ORCHESTRA

This exquisite 11-disc boxed set from Mosaic collects the complete output of Duke Ellington's orchestra on three labels - Brunswick, Columbia, and Master - for an eight-year span from 1932-1940.

Description:
After achieving youthful acclaim in Washington, and making a successful move to New York fronting (at first) small groups, Duke Ellington entered the 1930s with an expanded line-up and an increasingly creative approach to composing. Weekly radio broadcasts and swank guests in the audience spread the word; Hollywood noticed his marquee smile and musical brilliance; and the orchestra began touring extensively, including trips to Europe. His fame and popularity were on the rise.
But more importantly, Ellington entered the '30s having perfected his method of using the group to experiment with arranging and orchestrating. Ensconced at the Cotton Club in New York at the end of the previous decade, Ellington catered to a lot of musical interests and needs - he played for the dancers, and for the jazz lovers. He relied on ideas from his musicians, and wrote for them as individuals rather than as anonymous section players. With all that work and a line-up of marvelous, distinctive musical voices, Ellington began the most creative period of his life.

"Sophisticated Lady." "Stormy Weather." "Solitude." "In a Sentimental Mood." "Echoes of Harlem." "Caravan." All of them and many more are a part of "The Complete 1932-1940 Brunswick, Columbia, and Master Recordings of Duke Ellington and His Famous Orchestra," an unprecedented 11-CD set that compiles these recordings for the first, and quite possibly the last, time. There would be many more exceptional compositions in the years following, including his highly regarded suites and longer works, but the scope of our latest, lavish Mosaic collection is the period when Ellington would establish himself as the most important composer ever in jazz.

Musicians Created Their Own Voices, and Interpreted His

"Jazz, if it means anything, means freedom of expression," he told writer Stanley Dance. And express himself is what he did, through the instruments of stalwarts and newcomers to the orchestra who not only created personality for Ellington's band - they were, in many instances, standard bearers in their own right for their respective instruments.

Barney Bigard on clarinet and tenor saxophone established links to the past with his New Orleans-style runs, executed with exceptional warmth. Harry Carney was the only important soloist on baritone saxophone for years, and the big bottom his instrument provided brought real gravity to the Ellington sound. The great trumpeter Cootie Williams joined to replace the fallen Bubber Miley, quickly perfecting Miley's growl and mute techniques while creating his own sound with the open horn. He was a master of establishing mood and emotion. Lawrence Brown had a ringing tone on trombone, which complemented Joe "Tricky Sam" Nanton's earthy growl and Juan Tizol's fat sound. Trumpeter Arthur Whetsel, saxophonist Otto Hardwick, and the inimitable Sonny Greer on drums were all associates from the earliest days in Washington. Ben Webster began perfecting his tenor saxophone style during a brief mid-'30s stint with the band before being offered a permanent position in 1940. Late in the decade, Ellington discovered Jimmy Blanton, who would revolutionize bass playing with his terrific sense of swing and dead-on intonation before illness led to a tragically early death. And what can be said about Johnny Hodges, the silky smooth alto saxophonist who influenced generations of musicians? He was, in a line-up of superstars, a cut above all.

Ellington made use of them all, for their personal styles as well as for his own unique voicings that placed trombones at the apex of their range and clarinets at the bottom, or by putting unusual notes in the baritone instead of giving the instrument the chord's dominant tone. His compositions, the unique personal style of his players, his innovative arrangements, and his confidence in his soloists to raise any composition to a new level, combined to provide him with a palette unequaled in music.

The Complete Collection

Our set comprises a massive 11 discs featuring well over 100 Ellington compositions. In addition to the above-named musicians, guest stars Bing Crosby, Ethel Waters and the Mills Brothers make notable appearances. Ellington's female vocalist Ivie Anderson proves she was tailor-made for the band along with other superb band-mates Freddie Jenkins and Wallace Jones on trumpet, Fred Guy on banjo and guitar, Wellman Braud, Billy Taylor and Hayes Alvis on bass, and the unique cornetist Rex Stewart.

The exclusive Mosaic booklet includes a complete discography of the dates, a revealing essay and track by track analysis by Steven Lasker, and a number of rarely seen photographs. We urge you to order early - like all Mosaic sets, this edition is strictly limited, and given the importance of the music it contains, we're expecting significant interest.

DISCOGRAPHY

This discography is informed by the work of Steven Laskerï¿½s extensive research on Ellington recordings. His sources included the American Record Corporation (ARC) engineer logs, ledger books and Columbiaï¿½s matrix cards, which he was able to inspect thanks to the gracious help of Tina McCarthy, the longtime archivist for Columbia and then, Sony Music. More recently, Scott Wenzel conducted a supplemental review of the company files courtesy of Michael Panico of Sony Music.

The attributions of who plays what reed instruments on which sessions aren't noted in any company file but were made by ear, and are thus not necessarily correct in every instance.

All recordings were issued as DUKE ELLINGTON and his FAMOUS ORCHESTRA, DUKE ELLINGTON & HIS FAMOUS ORCHESTRA, Duke Ellington and his (or His) Famous Orchestra or Duke Ellington and his Orchestra, and released on 10ï¿½ 78s except where noted. For the purposes of this discography, only the first issue number of each matrix is listed. All are American releases except (Au) for Australia, (E) for England, (F) for France, (G) for Germany, (It) for Italy, (J) for Japan and (Sw) for Switzerland.

Label abbreviations for this set are as follows: BD for Blu-Disc, Br for Brunswick, Col for Columbia, Col Mas for Columbia Masterworks, FDC for For Discriminate Collector, Mas for Master, Par for Parlophone, SE for Special Editions, UTD for Up To Date, Voc for Vocalion and Vri for Variety.

Duke Ellington is believed to be the arranger on all titles except where noted. The start and end times shown here for many of the sessions were found in ARC's ledger books and engineer's logs. Recording supervisors (producers) are also mentioned where known.

Note: There are variations of tempo with matrix M 647-2 as it is believed the recording cutter was not running at the proper speed during the recording.

What we have designated in this discography as matrix M 650-x is misidentified on the Raretone LP as M650-1. The short silent section at the end of Hodges' first solo in Harmony In Harlem (at 1:16) corresponds to the music portion left out due to an unavoidable skip of the original recording.

While the Brunswick 78 shows Dusk In The Desert, the copyright application and sheet music both show Dusk On The Desert.
