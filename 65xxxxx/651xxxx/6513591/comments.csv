,DaFinkelstein,2011-07-08T20:48Z,"Sam Rockwell kicks ass and this film is proof! An awesome performance by both he and Kevin Spacey make this one hell of a flick. Don't read the synopsis above, just download, watch and enjoy!

Thanks .BONE.!"
,ChaoticCookie,2011-07-12T15:18Z,"This torrent appears to work perfectly fine (I say ""appears"" only because I haven't watched the whole thing through yet) and is of a decent quality (it is after all a small file size; one can't expect it to be *perfect* quality).

So, thankyouu! ^-^"

,pimpin121,2011-10-27T00:19Z,good rip i sin it at idvdrip.eu and knew it was gonna go on dvd
,altonina,2011-12-18T10:36Z,"A/V=8, but CONSIDERING THE FILE SIZE a RELATIVE ""10"", 5 stars, 2 thumbs up & ""Nice Job!"" sticker is more appropriate! The compact file and many seeders made for a LIGHTNING FAST DOWNLOAD for me.
Why the 8 then? Only because I had to turn the volume up a lot to hear and the video was pretty dark (I thought it was the movie itself until Sam asked for sunglasses).
The quality was but a tiny distraction from the movie, which TOTALLY ROCKS btw, so TUVM upper!"
,roller_reaction,2012-02-03T00:35Z,"Thanks so much. Good quality on both audio and video, certainly worth grabbing. :-)"
