     Football-mad Jess is 18, smart, beautiful and can bend a ball better than
     any boy she knows. She's set her heart on playing for a top women's footie
     team, but there's one problem: her strict parents want her to settled or
     with a nice Indian boy and learn how to cook! Flying in the face of her
     parents' disapproval, Jess and her best mate Jules make a name for
     themselves in the Beautiful Game, but then love rears its head for them
     both in the form of their fit (in more ways than one) coach Joe.
