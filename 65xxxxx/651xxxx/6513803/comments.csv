,spy_v_spy,2011-07-06T07:46Z,i have a problem getting FCP and Motion to work. it says there is a problem and i just have to ignore it? wondering what i can do to fix. Compressor works like a dream! thanks!
,spy_v_spy,2011-07-06T07:51Z,i also downloaded the updates for it to see if that would fix the issue but didn't seem to do anything. 
,impact_,2011-07-06T12:37Z,Final Cut X and Motion 5 content is already included into the apps or not?
,yuiop264,2011-07-06T14:35Z,uploaded 12.7GB. works great!
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-07-06T15:09Z,"@spy_v_spy 
Could you explain more? What's the problem? 

@impact_  
Final Cut Pro Content can be downloaded from the links in the Instructions inside the torrent/info on the botton of the description.

@yuiop264
Thanks! Uploaded 12 myself ^^,  Appreciate it :) "
,spy_v_spy,2011-07-06T22:55Z,"when I open the app an error msg comes up and says check to make sure this software iscompatible with your OS. I'm currently running snow leopard so I don't think that should be an issue. Esp since I grabbed all the updates. I'll keep working on it and see what I can do but any suggestions would be great. ialso, downloaded FCP Pro 7 last night in 30 min and works perfectly!"

,HawkTheGod,2011-07-22T22:33Z,"@CharltomWintale - You just need to change the receiptfile for FCP and Motion.

To do that follow these instructions:
1. Go to the Mac App Store and download any free app.

2. Go to your Applications Folder, right click on the free app you just downloaded and choose Show Package Contents.  Select _MASReciept Folder and Command C to copy to clipboard.

3. Now select FCP and right click and choose Show Package Contents and Command V to replace it with the old one.

4. Do the same thing with Motion (use the same _MASReciept).

It's NOT necessary to this with Compressor!!

- Hope it helps you out. :)"
,HawkTheGod,2011-07-22T22:38Z,"Btw - awesome torrent! Everything works perfect for me so fare. Though there is a little problem with the receiptfile, that makes an Angry Birds-update appear in your Mac App Store.

Thank you very much, Cyberpiraten, for this wonderful torrent. It works perfectly without bugs, and it is able to update without problems. I'm running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.1.

The only problem occurring after installing this app is the App Store displaying an update for Angry Birds. This can be solved by following HawkTheGod's instructions:


To remove App Store's update notification, you just need to change the receipt file for FCP and Motion.


1) Go to the Mac App Store and download any free app.

2) Go to your Applications Folder, right click on the free app you just downloaded and choose Show Package Contents. Select _MASReciept Folder and Command C to copy to clipboard.

3) Now select FCP and right click and choose Show Package Contents and Command V to replace it with the old one.

4) Do the same thing with Motion (use the same _MASReciept).

It's NOT necessary to this with Compressor!!

I'm no white knight; however, if I ever get into a situation where I start making money from editing, I hope to have the decency to buy it from the app store.  This is just letting me get my hands dirty for tools I hope to use in the very near future.  

I have a question regarding the updates:  Any word on the 10.0.2?  Have I overlooked an important comment here?  Also, I am running into the same issue with Angry Birds.  I followed the instructions of an earlier post, but to no avail.

The DL time for me on this app was blazing fast and the install was so easy it makes me think there has to be something wrong.  This is the first day of the DL so I will keep checking back for updates and I will report my results.  

Warm regards from the Hi-Cs.

P.S. (is p.s. really necessary when on a computer?) The most experience I've had with FC is FC exp 4 so I don't have much to go on when comparing it to past products.  There are mixed reviews but this works great for what I have plans for.
