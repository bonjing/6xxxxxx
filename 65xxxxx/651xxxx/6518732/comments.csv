,yancie,2011-07-22T13:01Z,"It's very good. it's the first one I try and it works very well!

Please read and follow the instruction of the torrent. 

@lgcanon, the page where it ask for a confirmation id:
Step 1: select your own country , it will provide a number for you to call, call it.
Step 2: On the phone,  a woman will ask for the numbers, give her the number on step 2.
Step 3: She will give you the confirmation ID, listen and type it.
DONE!

To all folks: just read and follow step by step all the instructions... And i can say you'll get a copy of Office 2010 activeted like i had...

Many thanks PRIME \o/"

,67steinip,2012-02-17T12:14Z,"Guys stop making things harder then they have to be it is very simple..

1. Download
2. Open the Office 2010 Toolkit ( Admin mode i prefer )
3. DISABLE ANTIVIRUS SUCH AS TRENDMICRO FOR THE TIME BEING
4. Go to License backup, uncheck save keys and check reinstall keys put PRIME as name in Backup name and click Restore
5. Go to main window and click ""ez activator""

Activation successfull without any phone ringing... at least on Win7 which i am using x86"
,nobruusa,2012-03-10T01:54Z,"Did not work...i followed the instruction and nothing.  When i opened word or excel it simply asks for a key.  no option for phone or internet activation, just a key, i tried entering the one i found on the toolkit but that didnt work."
