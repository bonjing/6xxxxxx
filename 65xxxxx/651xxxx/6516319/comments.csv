Thanks for the upload.

Great Stuff."

,abhishes,2011-07-25T23:07Z,"works beautifully.... but not for visio and project. they are not getting activated by this process. rest everything (word, excel, ppt) is.

does anyone know of project and visio as well?"
,abhishes,2011-07-25T23:09Z,"does this work for visio, project? for me everything got activated (word, excel, ppt) but visio and project did not get activated."
,Mitch_Bainwol,2011-08-04T03:56Z,"I setup my friend's machine using this, but it won't work on mine.

I tried repeatedly - it says nogo and begins the call transfer to a real person.

Also, the same fixed ID number to read to MS comes up every time. That would seem pretty easy to block.

Any ideas?"

Question is should i now leave the toolkit on my pc or delete/uninstall it?  Also can i now fix the changes its made to the registry?"
