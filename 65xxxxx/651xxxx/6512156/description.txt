This one is like a total ripoff of the original Wolfman, at least the werewolf aspects, and some dialogue, except for this werewolf is really kind of neurotic and reactionary, and really craves affection. 
And the werewolves are not above getting involved in politics.

There is another torrent for this, but it is never active.

You can also get this on Youtube on Openflick.


For anybody that likes Werewolf movies, even when they suck, they will love this.
