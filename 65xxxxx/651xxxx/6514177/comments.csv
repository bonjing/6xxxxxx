,Oxymuss,2011-07-04T11:20Z,"Well I would, but I get a ""No input file specified."" error when I try to download the .torrent file."
,Llamalord,2011-07-05T18:03Z,"Yeah, I get that too. I think it's the umalaut in the title, tpb doesn't play nice with special characters."
,ismiss,2011-07-06T03:17Z,"How am I supposed to download if it comes up with ""No input file specified""? Is there a way to get around this? "

,sharayde,2011-07-15T16:26Z,"Has anyone managed to download this? As said above, the torrent link does not work but the Magnet link does.

Seems to be quite a few trying this one but I just got to 0.2% same as a few others.

Need the uploader to seed if no-one else can."
