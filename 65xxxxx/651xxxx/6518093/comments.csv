,Mac Genius,2011-07-06T04:26Z,"Also, if am not wrong, the link for imdb is http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/"
,Slammer94,2011-07-06T06:42Z,"Thanks Mac Genus. I didn't think imdb had pages for tv series, and probably wouldn't have even bothered to find it if I knew they did :)

Sorry for my painfully slow seeding, my connections is about 130 KB/s, and probably less for uploading data."

,Slammer94,2011-11-08T05:22Z,"Not sure. Personally, I don't even touch iTunes. If you're not jailbroken, get CopyTrans manager as an alternative, should let you ""sync"" movies (and everything else) right onto your iPod, hassle-free. If you're jailbroken, find the MobileTheatre package on Cydia, install it, and then use a program like iPhone Explorer, Iexplorer, or iPhone Folders to put the video files in /var/mobile/library/downloads. Then you can watch them perfectly from MobileTheatre. That's the method I use. "
