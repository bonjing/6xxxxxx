Here is the 320 kbps version of the great 24/96 FLAC files supplied by Dr. Robert.  I converted the original files to 24/96 .wav using Audacity, then on to 16bit/48 using SoX.  I used Windows Audio Converter to get them to 320 kbps, so those who want to have them immediately ready for a portable device, here ya go.  Thanks again to Dr. Robert for the work done on the original vinyl source to get it to us.  Enjoy!
