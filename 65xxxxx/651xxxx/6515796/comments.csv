[T],thetorrentlord,2011-07-06T17:18Z,Thanks for this great upload. Now we just have to hope that someday the whole series will be released in BR.
[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-07T13:37Z,"hey bozx. I recommend reuploading this one with the proper title: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6399010/Barndon.1975.720p.BluRay.x264-SiNNERS

tpb doesn't like ""ry dot/space ly"", so you have to do put a dash instead: ""Barry-Lyndon"" :)"
