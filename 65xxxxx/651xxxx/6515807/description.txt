NG Salvage Code Red: On the Rocks
Salvage Code Red follows the real-life heroes from some of the world's biggest salvage companies as they race against time to rescue stricken ships, crews, and cargo. National Geographic cameras follow some of the most experienced salvors in the business, who must draw upon their own unique knowledge and experience, as well as rely on the strength and tenacity of the younger generation to tackle some of the most dangerous and out-of-the-ordinary missions ever seen. 
On the Rocks
Salvors must rescue prized dressage horses from a tanker run aground in the Azores. At the same time, they must keep oil from spilling and figure out how to refloat the vessel before it's too late.
