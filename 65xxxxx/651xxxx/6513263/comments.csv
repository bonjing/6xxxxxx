,Powerslave0,2011-07-06T04:24Z,"Ha, no shit!  A Starblazers remake!  I watched that cartoon when I was a kid!  Too bad there are subtitles and no dubbed English..."
,creek75,2011-07-06T21:32Z,"It's *not* a remake a Star Blazers (SB). SB was a 'cut for violence and adult themes' version of Space Battleship Yamato (SBY) for a US audience.
In the UK we got the SBY dubbed without the cutting of SB - though the translation was clearly less gritty."

,grseif7,2011-07-12T15:28Z,"In the description, it say's the texted language is in English.  Does anyone know why I'm not able to see the English subtitles?"
,Powerslave0,2011-07-15T05:18Z,"creek75: I watched it, and it sure is a complete remake.  Well, remake may be the wrong word, ok, but the story line is the same as the first season, with different things in it.  They changed a HELL of a lot, but it brought back memories.

grseif7: If you use Win Media player, you get the Subs, or if you transcode on the fly with PS3 Media Server. They are not imbedded in the video. MKV2VOB errors out when I tried to transcode the subs in, so I just watched it with PS3, transcoding on the fly."
,totenkopf1891,2011-07-16T16:02Z,This movie is freaking awesome! Will be seeding it forever!

,Star_blazer,2011-07-30T15:41Z,"Soooo coool! Can't wait to see it;))

Notice that I once upon a time chose ""Star_Blazer"" as my nick..."
,blown_zed,2011-08-01T06:10Z,"Why ""HDChina"" in the title?- its Japanese!"
,Halizar,2011-10-03T13:59Z,"I give the movie a 10/10.
I didn't want to dl the 6 gig one so i dl.ed Space.Battleship.Yamato.2010.DVDRip.x264.AC3 and that one was a/10 v/10.
I must say tho that if the japs are going to make this kind of sci fi movies Hollywood has some good competition."
,5TR34K,2011-12-10T05:59Z,"Hey guys, I cant seem to get the English subtitles to work In Win Media Player, VLC, or Media Player Classic.

All i get are the Japanese subtitles.

Anyone have any suggestions?"
