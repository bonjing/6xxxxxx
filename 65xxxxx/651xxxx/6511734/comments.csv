,badboy420,2011-07-31T21:10Z,"Quality is great..

But movie sucks..

If ur looking for a movie like ""Taken"" just try ""Trade"" - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399095/

which is a thousand times better than this movie"
,Ruby_pirate,2012-02-05T01:18Z,"@badboy the movie doesnt suck you moron. You just didnt get the point. And it doenst have ANYTHING TO DO with Taken or Trade.

Thank you very much neon :D A:10, V:10 ! I'm seeding :)"
