,crysis2texturefix,2011-07-04T18:59Z,I believe that this may have been a Skidrow release once again!? as it originally came with skidrow.dll however i didnt include this as it appeares to be the same .dll as in  the previous release of crack by them?!
,billias1020,2011-07-04T19:07Z,works great...no viruses...thanks to uploader...
,elessarGObonzo,2011-07-04T19:27Z,so nobody's tried it and confirms?

,elessarGObonzo,2011-07-04T19:47Z,"just ran Crysis 2 and resumed from the last checkpoint I was playing. also loaded a couple games, seems to be okay.
after I first upgraded to 1.9 it worked at first also though. fingers crossed."

,VeteranD13,2011-07-04T20:01Z,"The loading works,but after a few minutes of playing the Hud becomes distorted making the game unplayable;it seems to be an implementation on Cryteks part."
,Bujaaa,2011-07-04T20:10Z,legit
[T],Shepard76,2011-07-04T20:22Z,Thanks for this. But I can't kill the crysis2.exe process after exit the game ? Is that normal?
,crysis2texturefix,2011-07-04T20:51Z,"@Adrian and veteran! just played solidly for half hr and no blurriness or crashes for me?! dont know what your problem is? try updating drivers etc  if your not just trolling that is?! @sheperd I dont know why you may be having this issue, I dont have this issue when exiting game, checked all processes and doesnt keep running for me..no problem with closing via task manager either. sorry cant help."
,necrovamp,2011-07-04T21:54Z,"This is the only one I have found to be working.
Although I needed ONLY the Skidrow.DLL from this torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6512125/Crysis_2_crack_for_1.9_Patch

and to address some issues I saw.
no hud problems here
No crashes (unless you didnt get the skidrow.dll
no viruses
Loads saved games just fine

PS. im runnign win 7 x64, with the highres, and dx11 patches, so this is confirmation this one works great."
,VeteranD13,2011-07-04T22:25Z,crysis2texturefix-Well it seems like it just happens at random times.Happened to a few other people in a specific mission point The Warehouse map.Has not happened anymore so all is good for now.Thanks.
,crysis2texturefix,2011-07-04T23:32Z,"ok veteran thanks for comments @necro the torrent you mention still has unable to save problem? stick with this and you'll be fine, I used the previous skidrow.dll as it had exactly the same checksum(meaning they were the same!!!)

Man dont ya just hate the trollers when youre just trying to help."
,crysis2texturefix,2011-07-04T23:36Z,just re-read what you posted Necro. sos my bad for misunderstanding. yes correct in what you say..long day. :S thanks for clarifying for others if they didnt have the previous Skidrow crack.
,ToonForever,2011-07-05T09:48Z,"This fix works fine with Save games, no problems to report"
,lucbm,2011-07-05T15:06Z,Same issues as Veteran.
,crysis2texturefix,2011-07-05T15:15Z,"Hey all! 
Looks like FLTDOX just propered both skidrow cracks! and funny info to boot.
go below to updated proper crack.
I havent had any issues as yet with one i posted, however im no cracker or programmer so I'd take FLT's word anyday.

,zm786,2011-07-06T07:20Z,ANYONE KNOW IF MULTIPLAYER WORKING OR NOTT 
,msoulovej,2011-11-16T06:19Z,i cant start the game... it keeps on giving me errors saying stuff about incompatibility...
,1622,2012-01-08T23:26Z,"Not working alert! -

Crysis 2 (TM) has stopped working,
Close program.

grr..."
,shmimbadad,2012-02-17T12:19Z,"Where is a working 1.9 crack???!!!! I've tried like 5, including this one. They either won't even open the game, or they'll open but crash on game load."
,blekman,2012-03-13T03:34Z,"Mutliplayer does not, and will never work guys. You need a working serial otherwise the game will crash whenever you try to connect to a server every time."
,firebirdjimbo,2012-04-20T17:20Z,"Worked Fucking Great!  Thanks!    before when i would load a save it would try and load the map but then crash,  now it works.  i did the FLT, then 1.9 with DX11 and high res,  then this.  "
