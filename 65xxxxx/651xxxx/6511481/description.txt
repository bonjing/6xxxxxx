Nancyâ€™s off to Germany to investigate mysterious sightings of a creature thatâ€™s been terrorizing the community of a remote Bavarian castle. Local legend tells of a creature that marauded the area centuries ago, wreaking havoc and ultimately causing the death of a young woman before disappearing without a trace. Can you, as Nancy Drew, unmask the creature before you suffer the same terrible fate?
