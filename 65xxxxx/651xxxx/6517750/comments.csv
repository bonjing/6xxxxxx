,Ninjashizzle,2011-07-11T13:26Z,"I think for some reason only the normal version was installed, it's not requesting a serial. Anyone else have this issue?"
[V],ChattChitto,2011-07-13T16:15Z,"If you have an earlier version installed it might have taken the Registration Information from it.
That's why it didn't ask, and It will be rubbing as PRO :)"

,metameric,2011-09-14T06:55Z,"CHATTCHITTO!!

Let me just say, that I rarely write comments for torrents, but felt compelled to due the level of quality in your work and the level of trust I have learned to place in your uploads.

It dawned on me that for years, when searching for a torrent, I have sought the ChattChitto version FIRST.

Why? For one, your shit ALWAYS WORKS. Period. 

Beyond that, your custom interface and aesthetic is beyond compare...

Finally, I usually HATE keygen audio, but with yours, I have found myself leaving your keygen open, JUST FOR THE MUSIC!!!

Excellent Work.

THANK YOU for making cracks a work of Art.

(Sorry for spamming this in a couple torrents...just wanted to make sure you got the message)"
,nacos_ciprian,2011-10-07T01:25Z,"Great job!

Very great torrents!
Thank you ChattChitto for these great torrents!"
