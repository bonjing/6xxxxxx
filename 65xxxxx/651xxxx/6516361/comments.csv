Sorry, I do not collect David Letterman episodes. I only record parts of shows with hot women."
,petter35,2011-07-05T16:55Z,"Ok,thanks for this one.
Do you know why david letterman shows now days only upload as divx and not in 720p?
Most of the other talkshows like leno and conan are up in 720p."
,gizzrdy,2011-07-06T00:06Z,"My first guess is not enough people wanted Letterman 720p or 1080i. So TVTeam stopped making the bigger videos.

Or...the person associated with TVTeam who uploaded the big videos got a ""cease and desist"" letter from their internet provider."
