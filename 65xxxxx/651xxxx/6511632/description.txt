About The Book
"Dark and deadly and halfway to hell." This is Londonâ€™s Underground Railway, and the description proves only too true in 1895. The murder of Sarah Culdrose is just the first in a series of mysterious and often gruesome deaths that the cityâ€™s subterranean trains will witness. The deceased â€“ all women â€“ pile up quickly. There is a maniac at large, and Inspector Sholto Lestrade of Scotland Yard is detailed to work with the Railway Police. The detective plunges through a tangled web of deviants to solve a string of murders so heinous that every woman in London fears for her life. Will the London Transport System survive? Or will Lestrade run out of steam?
