,papasneb,2011-08-01T22:52Z,"This looks extremely fresh to mine eyes, Anacrolix!  These questions are for you or Rambooka or anyone else who may know (and I WILL seed this if I can use it).  I have a Verizon Fascinate version (boo...hisss) of the Galaxy S with firmware v2.2.1....so I ask:
1) Is this version of firmware v2.3.4 for a specific cellular provider?
2) If not, can I use it to trounce the locked Verizon version of the firmware so I can free my device from Verizon's tyranny...they bastardized Apps that should be free so the Apps cost me minutes or money for no good reason (i.e. With Verizon, I must use Cellular minutes to make a SKYPE call...I am not able to use any Wifi networks)???
3) Will my Galaxy S phone still be able to operate on Verizon after install?
4) Might my Galaxy S phone be able to operate on another provider's network that uses the Verizon cellular network, such as StraightTalk, ater install?
Sorry so many questions. Thanks in advance for the assist!    Papasneb ;D"
,anacrolix,2011-08-03T14:31Z,"1) No, it's a generic version.
2) If and only if your phone isn't locked.
3) Yes. You may need to enter the Verizon APN details to connect to 3G. I just googled mine and changed a single line in the settings.
4) Upgrading won't affect your ability to roam networks."
