Hi zgn35, i want to know if the dvd has southamerican spanish as an option (did you understand what i just say? LOL)
Well, i dont know much about torrents, but can you rip latin spanish chapters or if that's too much, maybe spanish subtitles....

Please! Please!"
,hegb05,2011-07-14T08:21Z,"And just for the record....
I will be waiting for your answer... "
,zgn35,2011-07-14T09:14Z,"i m truly sorry to say that but dvd doesn't have audio track or subtitles in spanish.
maybe you can find someone/website to translate english subs."
,hegb05,2011-07-14T19:08Z,"Ok, thanks, i can translate them...
I just wanted to make it easier, but thanks anyway
Let me ask you something else, im new at this torrent thing, and i want to know how can ido to download just a part of it, Example: I just want the first 2 seasons...
Or i have to download everything together?"
,zgn35,2011-07-14T21:40Z,"nope you don't have to download all of them. when you click on the torrent file you downloaded from here, your torrent client opens up a ""start download"" dialog box somewhere in that box you can find filenames with checkboxes. if you uncheck the box of a certain file, it won't be downloaded."
,hegb05,2011-07-16T08:27Z,"Hi it's me again... Just 4 gb in 2 days, this will take like a week or more...
Well, the thing is... Are the 'seasons epiosodes' like the same qualiity of the shorts? Because the shorts are like 320x240, and what exactly are this shorts?
They were too young in the shorts...
I just wanted to know that, because im not exactly the guy who growed up (?) watching this, im from 95, and Pete & Pete was a little bit older, but I used to watched on Nick like, 3 or 4 years ago, with Clarissa, when they rerun the shows."
,zgn35,2011-07-16T16:52Z,"before the show they started with short  comic videos. people loved them and asked nick for make pete & pete a show. so they turned it to a show which aired 3 seasons.
i also not a native english speaker maybe someone american can explain it better."
,hegb05,2011-07-19T01:29Z,"And one last thing...
It's like you have the DVD's?
I was wondering if you won't have others like Clarissa Explain It All, but i just want the subtitules!!"
,zgn35,2011-07-19T02:34Z,"yeah i have pete & pete dvds but unfortunately i don't have the others.
i will be more than happy to rip both videos and subs if someone can supply dvds."
,hegb05,2011-08-03T06:10Z,"hey, what happen? the download stops at 71.3!"
,zgn35,2011-08-04T11:44Z,i m still seeding. at least 10 guys downloaded so far but most of them are not seeding.
