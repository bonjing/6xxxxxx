,1355970,2011-07-04T23:49Z,"Best copy i will get until retail?

Don't kid yourself, the color balance is all messed up, first thing i did after watching like 10 seconds was to change the RGB gamma to 0.70, 0.82, 1 (unchanged)

... now it finally looks like i wouldn't watch it through night-vision goggles!"
,rcr29budcar,2011-07-05T21:10Z,"This is the best copy of the best movie of the summer in my opinion.  This is great. Its rare to get one this good until it comes out on retail.  I just wish that IMAGINE, or anyone who can, would release a copy of pirates of the caribbean 4 that is this good.  But thanks to IMAGINE and anyone who was involved in releasing this.  Your hard work is greatly appreciated. "
