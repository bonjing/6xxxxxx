,Num13ers,2011-08-27T19:19Z,"For the people wondering how to properly install and play the game, all you have to do is change your locale to Japan.

Control Panel > Clock, Region and Language > Region and Language > Administrative > Change system locale > Japan

Then once that's done, restart your computer. Then install the game."

,invesibel,2011-09-26T11:57Z,this game is a simulation for a japanese school you're going to creat and make everything in it from the 0 to the 100 it's nice but the way it's played needs a lot of pationce and needs players that can understand it
