An extensive list of songs you can dance to, a good 24 hours worth here :)

There is a variety of different styles in here, ranging from the commercial sound to rock n roll and everything in between. I'm sure there'll be some varying opinions on this list, but it's what I came up with.

Quality varies, some are in mp3 and some in m4a format, though most of them are at least 192kbps

Enjoy :)
