,picturedude,2011-07-02T16:09Z,shouldn't it be called a quadrilogy?
[T],Harrharrr,2011-07-02T16:15Z,"This is the name off the site, just moved all the info over =)"
[T],Harrharrr,2011-07-02T16:17Z,"Oh and 

A tetralogy is a compound work that is made up of four (numerical prefix tetra-) distinct works, just as a trilogy is made up of three works."
[V],DownTYU,2011-07-02T16:53Z,Whatever...anyways good upload +1
[T],insinuendo,2011-07-02T17:17Z,"The term ""quadrilogy"", a nonce word basing the prefix on Latin prefix quadri- instead of the Greek prefix"
,subotai68,2011-07-02T17:37Z,"""Quadrilogy"" is not a real word.  Neither is ""prequel"", along with many other words you might expect to see on a dvd/blu-ray package or movie poster.  

Lesson: Don't rely on the entertainment industry for your vocabulary.

I'm actually shocked that the site used the real word!"

[T],thetorrentlord,2011-10-09T01:35Z,"Just letting you know that your upload of Mad Max had hardcoded subtitles. What a complete waste of my bandwidth. The other 2 in the series were fine, just the 1st and it appeared to be Japanese. (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6403245)"
[T],Harrharrr,2011-12-04T10:24Z,"Better late than never but...smartvillan this one and the other big packs used to be seeded on a box whit a 1GB line, had about 240TB uploaded by the time i shut it down :)"
,sdfgh678,2012-02-20T15:01Z,"nice package! thanks
but for some reason the speed is not constant, sometimes fast sometimes slow.
I want you to be permanent.
I usually 500k / s speed in retrieving.
Thanks again."
