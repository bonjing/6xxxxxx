,Notor1ous,2011-08-12T03:44Z,"**** this file is UNCENSORED!! ****

But, its also CENSORED. It has TWO Audio Streams. You have to go to the sound options in your player and set it to the ""second"" audio stream, and like magic, it will no longer be Censored. :)

If you use ""gom media player"", just right click the the film and go to ""Audio > Select stream"" and select ""Stream 02"""
,ut_bhai,2011-08-17T15:55Z,"oh Notor1ous thankz alot. but, i use kmplayer. controls are different. to change it u gotta activate advance menu, then right click on moviw > audio> ""stream selection"" then select the second stream.

for a minute i thought i downloaded the wrong thing."
,h714375,2011-08-30T14:10Z,"Thanks, great work. Is there any possibility you could extract the uncensored audio and put it up ? useful for listening to while driving"
,ut_bhai,2011-09-01T21:54Z,oh yes... kmplayer rocks... in that you just gotta activate advance options and then in audio and select the second audio stream... DONE... GOOD TORRENT
