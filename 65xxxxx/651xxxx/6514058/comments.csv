,miss_mel,2011-07-04T06:53Z,"Hi, I was just wondering I downloaded the first 2 episodes of true blood season 4 a week ago.. shouldn't there be a third episode now..? By the way always love ur downloads :)"
,Jacilynn_Kate,2011-07-04T07:48Z,The third episode doesn't air until the 11th of July. The reason you downloaded the second episode a week ago is because it was an early release on HBO 
,miss_mel,2011-07-04T09:03Z,oh damn it! I am so hooked on the 4th season already and wanted to watch it today lol I am in australia so america is way ahead of us which is awesome i can download months earlier.. look forward to watching it next week. Thank you :)
,Insane_In_The_Brain,2011-07-04T10:29Z,I'm holding back until at least 6 or 7 Episodes in to the season to start watching because sometimes i just want to know what has happen the following week now before i start shooting things you know what i mean?

,reapster1,2011-07-04T13:11Z,Why only 2 seeds ?
,ManLemon,2011-07-04T14:22Z,"Thanks eztv! Though I wonder why your RSS is so behind lately, I keep updating it but it just won't show stuff that has been released on TPB or your own official site for hours or sometimes even days!

Not complaining though, you're doing an awesome job, thanks again! :D"
,seamus79,2011-07-04T15:25Z,Thanks again eztv!
,mismackenna,2011-07-04T18:34Z,I know that it's a stupid question but how can I seed? I'm new here and don't know. 
,nobipl,2011-07-04T20:24Z,"Hi, I have downloaded the torrent but how do i play it all i have is a sample .avi and a bunch of rar files... I have no clue would someone help me out here?"
,Autotronix,2011-07-04T21:07Z,@mismckenna.....Seeding is just having the torrent active with an internet connection after you have downloaded. Some people delete the torrent from their torrent program
,Autotronix,2011-07-04T21:12Z,"@nobipl....the torrent here is just an avi file....I'm normally wary of those rar files....If it's a legit rar file (which is rare), u may have to unpack or unzip it...

BTW, thanks eztv....from Jamaica"
