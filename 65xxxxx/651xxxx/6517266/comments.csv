,Monniker,2011-07-31T11:30Z,It works great!!! Thanks!
,devils5thleg,2011-08-04T05:51Z,This works great thanks...slight twist to the instructions....when activating over phone I tried 6 times without success kept getting transfered to operator and I hung up. Finally dialed using *67 plus toll free num to hide my phone id.  Followed instructions but this time let the  Microsoft operator come on the line and she gave me the activation code no questions asked. Great thanks again
