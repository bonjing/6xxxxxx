SEASICK STEVE YOU CANâ€™T TEACH AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS
Audio CD 30 May 2011 
Label: Play It Again Sam
Format: Mp3@320

You Can't Teach an Old Dog New Tricks is still recognisably a Seasick Steve album, but it also marks a distinct broadening of the guitarist's style. The album stretches to new band members too, with erstwhile Led Zep bassist John Paul Jones and drummer Dan Magnusson joining Wold on several tracks to provide a punchy rhythm section he has hitherto denied himself. It's an effective partnership; the extra power on Back in the Doghouse pushes the Seasick sound ever further into rock'n'roll crossover territory. Elsewhere, opener Treasures embraces the sombre atmospherics of the great country and folk miserablists, Wold's rumbling sigh â€“ an appealing cross between Johnny Cash and Mark Lanegan â€“ accompanied by violins that wouldn't sound out of place on a Nick Cave/Warren Ellis collaboration. Throughout, Wold seems to be making a concerted effort to find new gears within his rattling crankshaft of a voice.
