,rcr29budcar,2011-07-03T13:27Z,"seepoo1117,  you, obviously, are a giant douche bag too.  you saw the last post? well, its more than true, scene doesn't post fakes. So STOP trolling.  You are just causing trouble, so go away.  None of the normals want you here.  This is a REAL file and we don't need you here trying to hurt the credibility of good people.  So listen really good, most people know already that the green skull means its a trusted uploader and they do not post fakes. In fact the green ones are VIP's.  So get the fuck out and don't come back!"
,CainusLorre,2011-07-03T17:58Z,i will say this i do trust Scene so far but the first GOOD copy of T3 the one he spliced together i did have problems with.. at the point where sentinal activates the transport thing... the video and audio was way out of sync and shortly after that WMP stopped playing the video... is there a more current US copy out around here? and if there is please post the name of it here so i can find it easier thanks
