for the people who have problems installing this 1.9 patch  you need a original not cracked version of 1.8 or below so this can install 

these are instructions of how to install this patch

1.if u downloaded the full game from fairlight or some where else please browse your iso 

2. open the bin32 folder and u should find crysis2.exe and crysis2launcher.exe both are 1.0

3.copy and paste them on where your game installed on the pc

4.run the patch 1.9 and now it should install

what you think you are the best person at writing in english or what or you asswhole think this is a piece of writing that will be shown in a office meeting  i been watching elturbo and he is the best helper around here and on bitsnoop and btjunkie he helps people on what ever problems they have he mostly writes on windows apps and in mac for example sometimes he gives the reg files to change languages or configs on the game or some software sometimes uploads requests like missing videos of game rips and so on 

if you know how to torrent then you should know how warez groups work you should know what kind of stuff fairlight uploads skidrow uploads and reloaded uploads and if know how to torrent also you should get an idea of when or what group what will release what game 

sometimes don't trust skull uploaders becuase they sometimes fuck up like globe or littles or mafiaa or .bone"
