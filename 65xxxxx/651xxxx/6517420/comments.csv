All the Autograph sizes r quite large.......almost 700mb...............while ur rips r in the region of 450mb
hence i was req..............no prob if it is not on yr list............"

It's in my list, i can also compress it within 410 mb file. but if you d/l 688 mb file u hv to d/l only extra 278 mb. if u use 256 kbps line i.e ur d/l speed is 25 kbps only, 90 mb  per hour, then only 3 hours extra needed to complete 688 mb file download. i can not understand why you are asking to upload some repeated stuff where there are 3 torrents available with a good seed / peer ratio. thnx.."

Oh no ! you must change your connection. 12-14 kbps only ! terrible ! you must take Rs 750/- with 512 kbps (unlimited) / 2 mbps night unlimited ( Rs 500/- ) / 256 kbps unlimited ( Rs 500/- ). 144 kbps means you have a lot of patience. thnx.."
,sinner77,2011-07-06T09:35Z,"Thanks Robin

Rs 750 unlimited @ 512kbp sounds perfect for me......pl confirm then i will switch!!"
