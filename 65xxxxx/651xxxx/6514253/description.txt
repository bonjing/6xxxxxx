PlaneShift is a Role Playing Game immersed into a 3D virtual fantasy world which is FULLY FREE to play. Fully free means you will have no surprises of premium content which will limit your gameplay or unbalance the game. There are no limitations in skills, ranks, abilities, items you can gain with your free account. There are no time limits or additional constraints. Other similar games just advertize the "free" concept to sell you premium accounts. PlaneShift don't. Servers and bandwidth will be donated by sponsors.

PlaneShift is made by a group of RPG enthusiasts and not by a commercial company. This allows us to expand the game wihout any constraint or limitation.
