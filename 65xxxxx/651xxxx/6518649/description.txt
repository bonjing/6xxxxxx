Amazon Best Books of the Month, July 2011: In this true story of love and adventure, nothing can stop Thad Roberts from keeping a promise to his girlfriend Rebecca-not even NASA security. When he's in the lab, Roberts is a brilliant NASA co-op intern, but the other interns know him better for devising thrill-seeking activities, like cliff diving and sneaking into the shuttle simulator. When he realizes that scientists consider moon rocks worthless once theyâ€™ve been in experiments, Roberts starts to wonderâ€¦ if theyâ€™re worthless, how could stealing them be wrong? Ben Mezrich, author of The Accidental Billionaires (which inspired the movie The Social Network), starts each section with excerpts of Robertsâ€™s love letters to Rebecca from prison, providing a love-drunk context for Robertsâ€™ journey as the moon rock heist balloons from idle fantasy to stark reality. Behind-the-scenes looks at NASAâ€™s Johnson Space Center and thriller-like action that ranges from the U.S. to Belgium make for an enthralling read for anyone who ever dreamed about being an astronaut-or promised to give someone else the moon.
