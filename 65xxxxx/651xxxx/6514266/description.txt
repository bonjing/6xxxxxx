Agent Nelson Tethers just solved the biggest case of his career. So why isnâ€™t he satisfied? Thereâ€™s still the case of a missing eraser factory foreman, a whispering madness is still creeping from mind to mind, and a troubling recurrence ofâ€¦ creaturesâ€¦ is lurking into the town. The FBIâ€™s Department of Puzzle Research has marked the case closed â€” are they sweeping it under the rug? Or worse, do they not even care? Worried that the case will languish forever unsolved, Tethers must go rogue and venture back to the eerie town of Scoggins, Minnesota to solve the mystery of â€œthe Hidden Peopleâ€ once and for all.
