How to play it just the same as before by moving the Angry Birds catapults and destroy the enemy. But by the Angry Birds Rio we do not always destroy the object after conquering the enemy, at any given moment, we will free the bird in a cage which had been captured by a flock of other birds. In addition to presenting 60 level for Angry Birds Rio, Rovio also adds some character, achievements, and unlockable secret not found in previous series. The greatest of the latest version of Angry Birds Rio is a better quality graphics than previous games.
