This is the tracks from The Incredible Machine 3 soundtrack.

The original CD-ROM had high quality versions of the MIDI music as CDA tracks.

Flac RIP <3

Since this stuff seems to be pretty rare on the net and has received no love whatsoever as far as I can tell, here it is in case anyone else is interested.

Music composed by Tim Clarke and Christopher Stevens.

Many Thanks to 1ucasvb from youtube who take me in the past with these songs:


This is full Hi-Quality Flac RiP from the ORIGINAL CD

With love, from 1996 ('Sup Doc ? Gigowatts anyone ?)



Q/A ?:

:Why its starting at track 2 ?

-Because its a Mixed Data/CDA disc, who have game data plus CD-Audio part on the same disc.
In this case, all the data is "Track 1", and the others tracks are simply the audio-cd tracks

:Track 22 is 5s long and it's empty

-Yes it is, in any CD-Player, on my ORIGINAL release disk, the track is really 5s long and blank.
