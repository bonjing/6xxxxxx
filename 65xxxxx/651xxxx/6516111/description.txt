Sookie's trip to the land of the faeries is a short one though when
she returns to Bon Temps, she learns that she has been missing for
nearly 13 months. She hasn't brought herself to forgive Bill as yet
and Eric is still quite interested in her. She also learns that in her

absence, Jason has sold her house. Sam Merlotte has found new shape-shifter
friends. Jessica and Hoyt are learning to live together and to get along,
particularly when it comes to matters in the kitchen. Arlene is worried that
her new baby is evil though Terry Bellefleur doesn't seem to get it. Tara has

moved away and found a new friend as well as a way to release her inner frustrations.
Lafayette is introduced to a group of witches.
