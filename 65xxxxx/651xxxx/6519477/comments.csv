,richardpa,2011-07-06T20:32Z,"Ok DVDRip and a steady download...
A/8
V/6
The picture seems to stick every 5 seconds or so, seemed to play a little better on the VLC Player but was still sticking...
Many Thanx to Hero_No_1 and UnKnOwN for the effort and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:)"
,qui-gon-gin,2011-07-08T01:36Z,Is this movie good?.........M?
,Kojones,2011-07-08T22:35Z,"Thanx Hero No 1 for the upload. This movie SUCKS BIGTIME though. A good idea raped by very bad camera work and so on... When I watched this movie, I did not believe one second of it. Not the kind of feeling you want to have watching a movie. The trailer is very deceiving. I love all genres when the movie is good. From action to romance, syfi, you name it. This movie is one of the reasons I download rather than rent or buy..."
,strontkegel16,2011-07-10T01:19Z,a/v is good enough; the movie itself is stupid. 
,ametiste,2011-07-13T00:12Z,"Worst movie, storyline is dumb.
Too bad cauze the idea is interesting and there are pretty nice landscapes and abandonned constructs...
the poster is the only good thing.
Thanks for sharing anyway."
