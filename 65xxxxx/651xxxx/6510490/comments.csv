[T],Tyr3ll,2011-07-04T18:10Z,"still get huge problems with certain peers...
sometimes,my up slow down hardly...
too regulary conflicts between certain peers...
Please,listen to me :
first : slow peers must absolutely give more up
speed,it's crucial in this case !!!
avoid any proxy and try to not use vpn connection as well.
I think it's really time to open a support for those who often get several problems to connect or download on torrent and especialy for slow peers
I will be pleased to know your opinion about : Anacondaz
Any suggestion ?
Post here after me in case you might be interested to such topic.
regards"

,SphekS,2011-07-07T14:29Z,"Tyr3ll , your iso is installing well but i can not have the login . after installing catalyst driver , the screen is showing to press keys b c d ... for computers .
this software is shit because of that . is there a way to turn off the multipoint or even better unistall it ? i never seen a server having to be configured after station... that is pure M$ madness"
,SphekS,2011-07-07T14:39Z,"the iso is installing well but do you know how to remove the multipoint software ?
that shit kills the start of windows , asking to press b , c, d , e.. as much as display monitors .
it s really idiot to have stations config like that ."
,SphekS,2011-07-07T14:42Z,first message was made with your wiwi and ie [8 it was not showing so i use firefox on a other pc to ask help ...
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-07-09T17:34Z,"Well,sorry bro for my late response...as i don't have installed yet this version for real,unfortunately,i cannot give you a such support.I really apologize mate.
I suggest you to try to go on MS forum for that
or find a competent person about this topic.When i will get time enough i will try to find something talking about for you anyway.
really sorry again bro :s
or
try to ask to prathabrabhu for that,may be he will be able to give more help than me about
or take a look at here :
www.microsoft.com/windows/multipoint/default.aspx
regards"
,SphekS,2011-07-09T21:13Z,"thanks for help , i tried to set multipoint service off but it is started despite setting it at manual .
M$ did a good system with nt4 and win95-netsetup . i feel this one is having the same ""idea"" but the setup breaks all .
if you found the command line to disable-enable , i ll be glad . "
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-07-14T21:53Z,"@SphekS : i will try asap
