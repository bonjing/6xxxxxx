,Steveatron,2011-07-04T10:44Z,I downloaded this of the EZTV website and for some reason wont play?
,Steveatron,2011-07-04T10:49Z,At like 6 mins something just cuts out
,manwich49,2011-07-04T17:30Z,IMMERSE has been screwing up the 720p Falling Skies torrents also with funky sound encoding. EZTV needs to ditch these fucks.
,zamszowy,2011-07-04T17:47Z,"Why it hasn't got 6 channel audio, only stereo?"
,mrdoubleb,2011-07-04T18:39Z,"Thanks for the heads up, guys! I had the same issues with the Falling Skies torrents as well, so not even going top try this one."
,Diabolixxx,2011-07-04T22:01Z,Heil eztv!
,Steveatron,2011-07-05T02:24Z,"EZTV is the best for HD Shiznay shows but this is making me annoyed, Wasting cap on a show that crashes :( 
I downloaded all of Game of Thrones in HD and Spartacus in HD and No Problems"
,Superflow,2011-07-06T23:11Z,"This works fine, no problemo."
,meccs,2011-07-07T12:25Z,It works fine on VLC etc but NOT on stand alone players like Popcorn Hour etc. IMMERSE should stop this shi*!
,ronnieonetime1,2011-07-08T12:13Z,"What the hell are you people complaining about? I've got 6 channels of audio, the piture is the same as always, and it plays PERFECTLY on my Popcorn Hour. Uodate your firmware I guess. NO PROBLEMS. Thanks for this!"
,mackilll,2011-07-08T14:56Z,"This is not a perfect copy, eztv is the BEST, IMMERSE needs improvement... to bad"
,LanMax,2011-07-10T19:50Z,"NO PROBLEMS!. What are you all talking about? Plays on my XP and MAC, no issues. "
,RaW-D-Coy,2011-07-14T04:06Z,A big fail.
,firexninja,2012-05-05T01:39Z,thank you!
