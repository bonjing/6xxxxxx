,Jack_Raiden,2011-07-03T02:49Z,"Thanks AsA, extremezone, seeders. As good as it gets for SD (480p) BRRips; 'Unrated Extended Cut', too.

@Connor: FU... This IS a new film! (????????) This IS a BRRip! HD (720p/1080p) releases at this size are foolish, low quality. Also: /CAPS!"

,Malasky,2011-08-15T18:40Z,"@jimmy000
Most people seem to be using VLC as their preferred player. Never used it myself, I use PotPlayer Mini, and have never had a problem. Plays everything I've thrown at it. You could try either and see which you prefer."

Thanks man !"

,Cheyenne-tgy,2011-10-19T20:00Z,thanks mate.
,unRheal,2011-10-27T13:24Z,"TheEx94: 720p may have been the original resolution, (thus: ""source"") but, if you read the info, it clearly states it's 720x304, which is not 720p - it's not *even* 480p!

Maybe they converted to 480p before the final coding or something? Not sure why they put 480p in there.

That doesn't mean it's bad, but might look like crap on a 60"" TV... still close to others around here, so, depends on what you want/need..."
,primey0,2011-11-11T19:18Z,"It's not 720p, TheEx94. If it was 720p then the res would end in 720 not start."
,Nord1980,2011-11-18T22:06Z,"I hate the star of this movie,  I don't know his name but i heard it's good.  TY extreezone"

,VisExp84,2011-12-19T01:10Z,Awesome. thank you
,johntheone86,2012-01-24T10:24Z,Fantastic Quality! A/V - Both 10!
,Koshiki,2012-02-29T21:59Z,"@TheEx94, 720/1080 is defined by the *vertical* resolution, not the horizontal. 720p would be 1280x720, just as 1080p is 1920x1080. 

This rip is slightly worse than 480p (at 304), but can be classified as such as it's over 240p... but is less than 1/4 the resolution of 720p."
