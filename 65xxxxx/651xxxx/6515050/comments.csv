,downaccs,2011-07-04T16:47Z,incredible 222GB !!
,dspijkers,2011-07-04T17:27Z,Are there Dutch sub included? I can't find a 1080p LOTR with Duch subs.
,rabbit131,2011-07-04T17:27Z,this is INSANE!!! any one ripping this for low bandwith downloaders???
[V],DownTYU,2011-07-04T17:50Z,"@dspijkers
No, not included but any bluray dutch sub will work with any 1080p rip

@rabbit131
It has already been ripped to death in every possible size and format.Search to get your criteria."
,BMcM2000,2011-07-04T18:01Z,Thank You So Very Much!!!!!!!
,dspijkers,2011-07-04T18:31Z,"@DownTYU, thanks for the quick reaction. 
But don't i have to look for an extended version of the subs? Subs are related to the movie lenght, aren't they?"
[V],DownTYU,2011-07-04T18:54Z,"Try this

,bill71149,2011-07-04T19:01Z,My internet service provider would shut me down and ban me for a year if I tried to download such a huge file.  Wow.
,dspijkers,2011-07-04T19:05Z,"Thank you!!
I see now i didn't try hard enough!
;-))"
,vivatpb5776,2011-07-04T23:02Z,"This is HUGE for three movies, even if it is 1080p. However, I do have one concern...am I missing something or does this seem odd to some of you:

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Length: 1:45:43 (h:m:s)

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers
Length: 1:46:39 (h:m:s)

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King 
Length: 2:07:40 (h:m:s)


I do not know about you but those times appear to be ""extended"" to me. In fact, they appear to be retracted (less than the original). Has anyone fully downloaded the .torrent? Any verification?

Uploader - can you clarify please?"
[V],DownTYU,2011-07-04T23:20Z,"Read the description

http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Motion-Picture-Trilogy-Blu-ray/12237/

Every movie is cut into 2 bluray discs...
I gave description of the 1st disc of every movie

[T],-Gabe-,2011-07-05T12:11Z,"@DownTYU I hope you're seeding it from a seedbox :)

@bill71149 where do you live? Africa? Australia ?

,pc_,2011-07-05T13:22Z,"Challange Accepted 222,4 GB"
[V],DownTYU,2011-07-05T15:38Z,"@-Gabe-

It was made public after two weeks in a private site...It is already well seeded. Intial seeding was at 5 gBps...now only one of 5 seedboxes are active which will be removed the day after tommorow."
,Apikong,2011-07-09T16:39Z,Thanks a lot!!! My project of the month.....
[T],-Gabe-,2011-07-11T01:59Z,"@outstanding job DownTYU, if you can preseed it from time to keep it alive. I'm afraid many will disappear pretty fast from seeding.

However, I think you deserve to look green :)"
,UMe2,2011-07-12T00:14Z,"I'm downloading with a constant speed of 7.7 MB/sec (yes, megabyte/sec) - I never thought to hit the max speed of my connection of 64 MBit/sec ever with a torrent. After 5 hours I have more than 50%.

Thank you very much for that great release. As an owner of the Extended Edition on DVD I refuse to buy it on Bluray again."
,Lennnon,2011-07-25T13:11Z,"Thank you for uploading great files!!!
and please upload 9 bonus DVDs in Blu-ray Extended Edition!! :)"
,Lennnon,2011-07-25T14:38Z,Wow!! Download speed is 10.7MB/s !! Thanks a lot!! :)
,GenT17,2011-07-30T01:22Z," this is ridiculous. why is yours the only one that is this big, all the other ones are at below 77gb. why so big? are all 9 discs in this?"
,GenT17,2011-07-30T01:32Z,"also I just switched to windows 7 and now bittorrent causes it to freeze sometimes, does anyone know how to fix this"
,Gacy4Gein,2011-08-04T18:19Z,"Can someone upload just the Demuxed DTS-HD audio files separately ?
I don't want to DL 222Gb just for the Audio ;)

Cheers"
,HoNds,2011-08-08T03:22Z,"What language is this, and if it isn't English is there a way to switch it?

thanks"
,jpd456,2011-08-21T02:04Z,"WOW!!!  One question.   How do I put this on discs?  I've got 50Gb blue rays.

Thx a ton  Down TYU!!"
,jpd456,2011-08-21T02:12Z,"WOW!  This is truely epic!!  How do I get them on disc!!

Thanks a ton for the upload!"
,jpd456,2011-08-23T03:54Z,"Is anybody else having a problem with the two towers disc 2?  I have tried burning it twice, niether would work on my computer or bluray.  the two towers disc 1 worked great!"
,teos9888,2011-09-08T00:54Z,why can't I rate it +10???
,Polie,2011-10-01T02:28Z,"Dont hate me too much, but is it possible to get it to play on English vs whatever its in?"
,HundeBrot,2011-10-16T10:23Z,the language seems to be english from the info posted or cant you fuckin read??
,thegr8luiz,2011-10-22T04:13Z,Words are not enough to thank you for all the time and effort you have put into making this available. It is very much appreciated.
,thegr8luiz,2011-10-27T12:56Z,"It took me 98 hours to download this at an average speed of 660kB/s, one third of what my connection is capable of. I'd say this was pretty decent in terms of speed. The files are perfect and play flawlessly with PowerDVD 11. DownTYU has also uploaded the Star Wars blurays, but those have awful download speeds. Why is it so? The upload is only five weeks old. I'm very grateful for all the work that's been put into making these wonderful uploads available, but don't understand why the speeds for the Star Wars blurays are so incredibly low."
,Branato,2011-10-28T23:26Z,does not appear to be any english audio streams in the m2ts files =(
,Pinkya,2011-11-04T06:30Z,Does it include all the extras? Like the behind the scene footage? I've been looking for it without any success :(
,machmach112,2011-11-10T22:09Z,"Thanks for the upload...Was downloading at full speed the whole time. 

But the movie was in Russian I believe even though I saw the language as English. Is there any way to change it to English? "
,lostflguy,2011-11-15T08:03Z,yah this torrent has me maxing out at 5MBps going to take barely 13 hours to finish. thumbs up.
,Selquin,2011-11-16T01:54Z,Well here we go.... started right at 7pm... will repost a comment when i'm done lol.
,bigjohnman,2012-03-11T10:15Z,"I'm working on a repack of this so that each disc will fit on a 25 BD-R. This process is insanely slow, because I set all possible settings to their max for quality. I will post a link when done, until then, you must seed this one!!!"
,LAMBORGHINI39M,2012-06-14T21:00Z,is there a link to add greek subs for those 3 movies and are they with bonus disc and what does it include?
