Freedom Teachings Foundation Course - Recorded Live 9-21-2007 in Virginia Beach, VA
Presented by Kathara Team Member Noel Tobin.

The God Worlds Module provides a detailed description of our cosmic geography. We live in a world that in turn lives within a magnificent multi-dimensional structure that connects us all the way back to Source. We came into embodiment within this cosmic structure and our pathway home takes us on a journey through the many levels of the God Worlds. Familiarizing ourselves with the structure is a part of finding our way home.

This module explores the multi-dimensional structure of creation and how this manifests ever finer levels of detail, spanning local Veca universes and parallel universes, inner Ecka core worlds within larger Eckasha universes. You will learn about the Lower, Middle and Higher God Worlds. These emerge in turn through the Cosmic God Seed and the Primal Life Current fields of Source. You will also learn about the â€˜Stairway to Heavenâ€™ and how this forms a personal pathway back to our home in Source. The God World maps provide a depth of information and integrity of structure that is totally unparalleled.

The information in this module provides a foundation for understanding the cosmic drama unfolding around us. It is essential to understanding the grid connections, energy flows and the personal and planetary activations arising at this time. This information is a very precious gift to our personal growth and to our race and planet in these important times. It informs and honors our connection to Source.
