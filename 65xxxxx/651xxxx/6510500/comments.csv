My need was to Password Protect 500GB USB Drives - portable. Nice design, I guess, but I found it very confusing, EXTREMELY SLOW - 10 min a gigabyte or something, ERROR PRONE...

STORAGECRYPT, here on PirateBay - AWESOME. As fast as USB Secure, as simple, as easy... STORAGECRYPT STORAGECRYPT...!!!

If I find problems, I'll let you know. "
