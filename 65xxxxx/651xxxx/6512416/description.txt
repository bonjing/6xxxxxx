    Double agent Picasso Trigger is assassinated in Paris by                 
    double-crossing bad guy Miguel Ortiz. Then Ortiz begins eliminating      
    agents of The Agency who were involved in his brother's death. The       
    Agency (belatedly) springs into action to stop Ortiz' heinous            
    activities. The usual gunplay, romance, and nifty toys with bombs        
    ensue.
