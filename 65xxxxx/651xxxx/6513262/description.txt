Holy Fuck EP is the 2nd release (limited pressing) from Canadian Improvisational,/electronica group, released by Dependent Music, a music label and artist collective that began in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. The band uses live instrumentation and miscellaneous instruments and non-instruments (including a 35 mm film synchronizer, toy keyboards and toy phaser guns) to achieve electronic-sounding effects without the use of laptops or programmed backing tracks. Experimental yet danceable & beat-driven. Packaged in a black, textured paper fold-out digi-pak sleeve with glossy, silver ink logo on the front.

Review
by Stewart Mason
Toronto electro-rockers Holy Fuck are clearly banking on the continued rise of satellite radio, because they're just not gonna get that far in a broadcast world still under FCC restraints. The eight lengthy songs on their debut album are largely improvised, with two drummers (one of them, surprisingly, Glenn Milchem from the languid AAA country-rockers Blue Rodeo) and three keyboardists creating completely rhythm-oriented instrumental grooves that are introduced, percolate around for five to eight minutes with little variation, and then recede. So melody and lyricism are entirely beside the point here, but what makes Holy Fuck something far more interesting than the average LCD Soundsystem knockoff is the album's thrillingly live feel. In a style of music that's mostly created by pressing buttons and manipulating touch screens, the drummer-powered, live-in-the-studio feel of Holy Fuck provides both musical excitement and textural variety missing from most similar electro-dance albums.
