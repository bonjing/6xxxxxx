Have you heard anything about the Carenado 210 yet? It seems to be a solid plane from what I've heard."

,sidewinderv2.0,2011-07-06T19:12Z,Hey no problem FBI! I can't wait for this 146 now! I only wish they had her painted in the Debonair livery. Hopefully a repainter will do a paint of that when it's out.
