This is a 7 minute uptempo remix based on ""song to the siren"".  repeats only the words ""Did I dream, you dreamed about me"" and these words only, throughout the 7 minutes.  Great beat for the dancefloor but fans looking for a cool remix of This Mortal Coils ""Song to the Siren"" I think will be disappointed on account of the repetitious nature of this mix."
