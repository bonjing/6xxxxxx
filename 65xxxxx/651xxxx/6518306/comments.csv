,ReallyHow,2011-11-13T08:20Z,"dd, I've got a double dose of bad news for you.

Kaspersky returned what's called a False Positive. Which means that there is code inside the file which is mistakenly detected by heuristics as matching portions of malicious software.

You're also retarded. The torrent has now been up for a little over four months. Likelyhood of infection? Nil.

Oh yeah, and I also scanned it with MBAM and MSE. Nothing found."
