[T],thetorrentlord,2011-07-10T00:47Z,I have your DVDFab Platinum  v8.0.6.7 + Crack  torrent from 1-6-2011 and the bluray part expired 30 days after install. Have uninstalled and cleaned out the DVDFab keys from the Reg and reinstalled but as soon as you apply the crack it says that the Bluray option has expired. I am going to try this one and hope it actually does what it claims to never expire. Thanks for all your fine uploads.

,XegniX,2011-08-06T12:07Z,"Thx again, ChattChitto, for another exquisite production!
As for the errors reported, it's hard to reproduce them when you have met no problem whatsoever with this CC-prog.
Maybe something went wrong with overwriting a previous version? (thus the 'expiring' remark)
My sequence: setup-button->reboot->crack-button (below)=> no worries!
It might be wise to check the Properties of the shortcut of the program on your desktop-> Find Target, for there you see what is launched.
Happy Fabbing!"
