In the late sixties British record labels started to release a selection of their artists' material on records known as samplers. These were not intended as  anthologies or compilations - the purpose was to allow listeners the opportunity to sample a range of acts at a reduced price, showcasing in particular those for whom there was not a conventional singles market and hence little opportunity for radio airplay in the UK.

This double LP has many artists who you will soon recognise even today.
