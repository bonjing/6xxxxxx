Thanks a lot... CRAZY FIGHT"

,jimijimijimi,2011-07-03T10:16Z,"Can someone please explain something: 

seeds 12(426)

Does this mean I'm only connected to 12 of 426 active seeders, or that there's only 12 of 426 who are actually seeding (i.e. the other 414 are hit and runners)?"
,SeanShotgun,2011-07-03T10:35Z,"5 of 398 seeds, wtf?"
[T],tdkdemon,2011-07-03T10:40Z,"@jimi..

means thr r 420 + seeders...n u r connected to 12 of `em..."
,TrueSatan1,2011-07-03T11:13Z,"Though many seeders may be seeding at any given time you may be too distant from some to establish a reliable connection or they may be already saturating their connections supplying other users so, to be blunt, you need to have more patience and not complain so much."
,shareeasy80,2011-07-03T13:13Z,Thanks for this mate . BEST UFC OF THE YEAR IMO!
,q106cathal,2011-07-03T13:55Z,whats going on? almost 1900 ppl have downloaded this file and i have 1 seeder?? will have seen 133 before i've seen this.
,Mefayor,2011-07-03T14:23Z,"thank you for this , can't wait to see it...btw is there any chance that someone will upload this in 720p quality ? i know it will probably have a big file size but i'd love to see this fight in 720p."
,Bluesharp61,2011-07-03T14:35Z,"It's great that this came out so quick after the PPV, but it's not the best quality. Dark and grainy. A=10 V=5. Can't beat the price, tho. LOL"
,jimijimijimi,2011-07-03T16:14Z,"@tdkdemon & TrueSatan1: thanks for the clarification :)

A: 9.5
V: 9.5

Considering the size of compression - perfect! Thanks for the upload, you're a champion."
,jaded3825,2011-07-03T19:28Z,thx
,Topazskillmauler,2011-07-03T19:51Z,Missed the event last night. Can't wait.
,mjsstujo,2011-07-03T20:35Z,"I have alot of lag in the main event, at the start of round 2 and at the end of round 1"
,jp62284,2011-07-03T20:57Z,thx for the upload Long Live Pirates!!!
,xoctor,2011-07-10T04:19Z,"Thanks for the up. Less compression would be good.

A: 10
V: 5"
,c3bhm,2011-07-15T03:29Z,"Absolutely terrible encoding quality considering file-size.  This isn't 2008 anymore!  Switch to .mp4 and this could be damned near 720p at this filesize, or at this video quality it should only be about 600mb total."
,prs_fan,2011-08-07T07:28Z,Thanks a bunch! This was freaking awesome! So many impressive moments and KO/TKO's.
,zkt,2011-09-04T08:03Z,"tdkdemon, thanks for the upload! I was expecting a better video quality for as large as the file is, but hey, I'm not paying for it so I'm not complaining!

A - 8
V - 6

It's watchable, but definitely would look better in a small window on my computer, than on my 50"" HD Samsung TV. "
