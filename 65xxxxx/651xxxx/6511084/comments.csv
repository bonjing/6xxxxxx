,Skorp686,2011-07-02T17:08Z,"Thanks. I see there aren't any seeds, so I'm only downloading at a mere 50kB/s on average; however, I am uploading at an average of 502kB/s. I will seed for approximately two weeks...my usual seed limit.

Thanks again ^_^"

Or come back in a few more days when i've got it out to more people!"
,comopa72,2011-07-02T21:10Z,"Hi...thanks for uploading this game - I have been waiting for it for months...hopefully my speed will pick up soon, as I dled this torrent 4 hours after it was put here - and still only at 13%...will seed too, once I get it :)"
,uroshuchiha92,2011-07-04T01:45Z,Downloaded it and player for like 30 minutes or so and it works perfectly so far.Thanks uploader and seeders.
,Skorp686,2011-07-04T21:33Z,"@ xxnicxx

I wasn't being sarcastic btw. I was ACTUALLY thanking you for uploading. Just because the majority of people on here tend to be a**holes doesn't mean we all are. 

Anyway, I finished playing it. Everything went through fine, no crashes, freezes, nada. So thanks again.  "
,ydurla,2011-07-22T06:09Z,"WHY DO PEOPLE SEED ONLY FOR A FIXED AMOUNT OF DAYS, WHEN IN REALITY THEY SHOULD BE SEEDING DEPENDING ON THE TORRENT'S RATIO!!! For example, you might think your the best seeder in the world because you might have seeded a torrent for a whole year, but in reality if you have only a ratio of 2.001 for that torrent, that means you only managed to seed it for 2 people!  Therefore people should stop seeding based on the days or times u seed, but rather seed it DEPENDING ON THE RATIO OF YOUR TORRENT. My default seeding ratio for a torrent is 20.001, which means i will continue seeding until 20 people manage to download it from me. THIS IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF BEING A SEEDER AND NOT A LEECHER! (PASS IT ON)"
