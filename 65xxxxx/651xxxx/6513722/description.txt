Totally Turkish starring Ruby is fast, furious and full of spunk. Turkish Oriental belly dance is defined by strong movements, bold hair tosses, kicks, spins and sassy isolations. With deep roots in Turkish Romani dance, Turkish Oriental stage dancing carries an energetic and raw quality. In contrast with the more ballet-infused Egyptian stage dancing, movements are big, bold and energetically outward.
