    The codex â€“ I hear you aksin ? It sounds like a product doesnâ€™t it â€¦ well actually is latin for a rulebookâ€¦. Well this rulebook â€“ here â€“ should be used for writing and performing kick ass hard rock musicâ€¦ I think they should actually pass a copy of this to everyone who intends to do an album â€“ as a reference pointâ€¦.
    Were do I start and were do I begin â€¦.
    Well take one measure Magnus Karlsson famous Swedish guitar-wizard, a super-talented and busy guy actually, since he is the mastermind behind Starbreaker (with Tony Harnell) and the recent very successful Allen / Lande collaboration and out of the mothballs bring a very virile and seemingly Reborn MARK BOALS known as one of the best singers ever to work with Yngwie Malmsteen and first class vocalist, awarded in 1999 by BURRN! Magazine readers in Japan as Best Overall singer of the year. Join the two and augment the band with a good rhythm mection in Linus Abrahamson and Daniel Flores â€“ both notable musicians in their own right. Then superbly produce â€“ 12 superb â€“ very melodic and very catchy songsâ€¦.then just stand back and marvel at the creation â€“ get a nice cover â€“ and you have a winner of a melodic album â€¦ this is hands down one of the best albums Mark has done since Trilogyâ€¦ and to be quite honest â€“ I donâ€™t think heâ€™s done any particularly bad ones â€“ (bar the terribly produced WTEAW â€“ that had good songs but the shittiest production & mix imaginable â€“ courtesy of his Malmsteenessâ€¦) Ehm â€“ a very serious contender for my top 5 albums of this yearâ€¦. An epic-o-lyrical hard n heavy masterpiece ! And I tend to use the word sparingly â€“ cause people toss it around like they toss saladâ€¦.
    Raise your hands !!! Indeed !
