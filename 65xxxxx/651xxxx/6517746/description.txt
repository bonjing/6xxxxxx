Tootsie is one of my favorite all-time movies for the truly lovely great
Christianly warm beauty and lovely gracious presence of the (arguably) goddess of
Germanic beauty in this movie - Ms. Jessica Lange - born of a German parent in fact.

Whenever I hear the theme song "it might be you" by Ste[phen Bishop 
(included here as an mp3 add-on bonus) I think of Jessica Lange handling
all my cares for Christianly warmth and comfort in what is any idea of a
worthwhile earthly existance.

Dustin Hoffman is interesting in this choice of role, he is certainly
a talented actor and quite versatile in what he is able to attempt and
even pull off quite successfully I would say.

To protect the spirit of Jessica lange is the highest calling of nobility in man
