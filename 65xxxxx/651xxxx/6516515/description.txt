How come you press harder on a remote control when you know the battery is dead? so you better seed to get speed ;)

        Seed back for speed

[color=RED][b]Work Done[/b][/color]

Well here i go with my version of T3.Thanks to Imagine and their friends for the 
audio and for the video.Now onto the filtering.For this one i ran a perspective filter 
cropped and resized. needed to adjust colors,lowered the saturation a bit changed the 
hue slightly increased gama and black levels and sharpened the video.Now yes OP head looks
purple but that has to do with a setting from the cammer where it couldnt tell the 
difference between the blue and purple im guessing cause all the other colors are spot on
so if you can live with that then download this awesome cam if you can't then grab a marker
and paint it blue lol also the begining credits are oof a bit for a few seconds but 
it straightens real fast didnt mess with it as i didnt see a need for it since it was the 
credits.all in all it looks awesome.Hope you all enjoy from BDK.
