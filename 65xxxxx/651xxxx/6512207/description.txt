How can college be a "scam"?

We hear that young people need to go to college.

"Your future depends on it!"... "It's the only way to get a good job!"

Hillary Clinton says: "Graduates from 4 year colleges earn nearly twice as much as high school graduates...an estimated one million dollars more."

Many experts agree.

But I argue that for many students, if not most, college actually is a scam. Clinton's $1,000,000 earning disparity is deceitful because it's based on a census study that doesn't factor in the fact that kids who apply to college are already more motivated.

The truth is that many colleges don't teach much. Many students are not right for what is taught. Yet this decade, college tuition rose 92% (the CPI was up about 27%).

Tonight, I expose blaring liberal bias on campuses, and lazy tenured professors, who spend little time actually teaching America's kids.

We meet an entrepreneur who pays people not to go to college.

And I confront a representative from my alma mater, Princeton. The college constantly tries to get more money from its alumni, but I'm guessing they might stop contacting me after this week.

Is college worth it? Find out tonight at 10pm EST on FBN. The show will re-air Saturday and Sunday at 9pm & midnight EST.
