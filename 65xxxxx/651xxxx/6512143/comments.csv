,zekeisaszekedoes,2011-07-04T21:53Z,"The video/audio quality is very good for SD, not sure why everyone's moaning.

The fight itself on the other hand, that was really bloody painful.  Haye keeps falling over and Klitschko just keeps darting out of the way.  It goes the distance but never really takes off.  How Klitschko won all those belts I'll never know, because he's a boring evasive boxer with no flair whatsoever."
