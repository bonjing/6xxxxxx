,Nickyboy7,2011-07-06T18:55Z,"Thanks a lot for all this paranormal stuff, I've been very interested in it since I saw a ghost in my back garden at 2am, glowing white and moved over my garden wall next door when it saw me. I was looking at it for a good 30 seconds right in front of me, no shit. I won't even look out there at night any more as it scared the shit out me. 

There is definitely something out there, I've seen it for myself. "

[T],trialNerror,2011-07-07T02:12Z,"I know what you mean, Nick. I've had experiences which can't be explained.  For example the door across the hall slowly opening all the way then closing again.  I swear I'd hear a couple footsteps down the hall.  I've heard what sounds like a picture frame swinging on that lightly textured kind of wall in the next room.  I've had scratch marks on the back of my neck after jokingly provoking.  People who say ghosts, spirits, unworldly entities, demons, whatever, are not possible and can't exist piss me off.  Closed minded ignorant saps is what they are; acting like we know everything of this world and universe when we know only maybe 30% of what's there."

Saint PRS is currently working on more Investigation episodes.  No definitive answer as to when they'll be available, but yes, more will be coming in the future."

Way too many things that can not be explained."
