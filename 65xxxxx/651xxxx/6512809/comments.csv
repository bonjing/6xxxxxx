The video is only 54% so here you go forced to download the optional files that you don't want. Take that!

As answer to all the bitching comments I got for having the tracks  separate (demuxed) giving you the option to download only the track(s) you want.

..and those majesties who were happy with the torrents with tracks demuxed didn't take the huge effort to bitch back the bitches (LOL) in comments.

So the poor Italians for instance with their slow internet will have to download 4 GB instead of 2.5 GB with this torrent.

This is the great thing about mkv, unlike the dvd you can make your own ""salad-plate"" (like in a salad-bar), if you're not too lazy.

I only seed Ratio 2.0 then delete my torrent and re-mux my file so don't ask for reseed because I won't be able to and all the others won't care. 
(I'm curious how long this torrent will survive.)"
