Thanks allot scene. Does anyone know if this has the first 10 or 15 mins thats missing from some of the other copies?  And thanks."
,rcr29budcar,2011-07-02T18:35Z,"Sorry for this many posts. But kaplis, I just noticed who u were talking to. And spammers suck!"
,rcr29budcar,2011-07-02T19:21Z,"Yes, you can tell by the name, but you gotta look at the uploader too. Green skull=REAL! Also, scenebalance don't post fake uploads.

i know its real.....REAL!"
,rcr29budcar,2011-07-02T19:28Z,"Oh, i forgot,  sometimes when i'm downloading a file and try to preview it before its finished, sometimes it will play off the wall movies, so i have to wait until its finished completely, then it plays the correct movie.  I previewed one once and it played a different movie from what I was downloading. I then made a complete ass out of myself calling the uploader lots of bad things.  People said I was crazy, and that something was wrong with my computer, that the movie was exactly what it was supposed to be. So I tried again, this time waiting until it was completely finished.  Turns out that they were right.  I've found out that the uploaders with green skulls are 100% reliable.  "
