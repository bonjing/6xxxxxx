Hi there,

Here is a rip from a VHS Tape I used to have a few years ago. Just after I ripped it I took it to work & couldn't seem to locate it ever again. It has some ducking here and there, but what's to expect from PBS broadcast. I also adjusted the audience response. It seemed unbalanced without a visual reference.

Hope you enjoy this rare T.V. broadcast


I tried to recreate my old torrent, but decided nothing matched, SO... I Checked for CDDA, converted to FLAC, Tested encoding FFP, & then MD5 before the 4th of July repost.
