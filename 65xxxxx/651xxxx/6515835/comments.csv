Some error from pbay
Use the magnet link, should work fine. :)"
,Bjareboy,2011-07-05T22:05Z,"Ok, tnx :) Works fine with the magnet link(never tried those before)"
,zumzod,2011-07-05T23:18Z,"No problem
It's easier, less files ;)"
,Kayaq,2011-07-06T23:10Z,"The magnet link isn't working for me. I click on it, and this small window appears, and I click ""start program"", but nothing happends. Any advice? :)"
,zumzod,2011-07-06T23:18Z,Are you sure it's trying to start the correct program?
,lennytheking,2011-07-07T01:44Z,Tack! Men du missade dom tre sista lĂĽtarna. (Am I Evil? Damage Inc och Creeping Death) :(
,zumzod,2011-07-07T10:52Z,SVTplay didn't add those songs because they were encores
,Kayaq,2011-07-07T17:03Z,"@Zumzod I don't get to choose which program to start. It's trying to start frostwire.exe, but I don't have that program.
I'm using Vuze for torrent downloads"
,zumzod,2011-07-07T17:25Z,Download Âľtorrent or bittorrent and see if it works
,Kayaq,2011-07-07T23:37Z,"It worked :) Thanks!!
BUT, neither WMP, VLC or Quicktime can play the file. What do you use?"
,zumzod,2011-07-08T11:49Z,"@kayaq
VLC can play the file perfectly for me. Just try and update it :)"
