,xaximus,2011-07-05T23:16Z,Why is this 147MB?
,KaLaNco69,2011-07-06T01:14Z,"Cause it's .mp4 ^^

rdkt11, have you tried uploading without super seed enabled?? Can't believe you have slower than dial-up upload speed?! But it seems that way....

Cheers for providing this season for us - very muchly appreciated!"
,Quorwyf,2011-07-06T02:22Z,thanks
,KaLaNco69,2011-07-06T13:54Z,"Why choose Finale to change a great thing?!

Not sure whether these are your caps, but previous caps have been fine.

400kbps Video, and 64kb/s audio = why now!!

I'm sure peeps will wait the extra time for the better quality. Infact, Look me up, and I will help you seed these next season no dramas at all - just keep to original standards......"

,bwheat,2011-07-07T18:37Z,"You did a great job all through the season and I cannot believe you switch to such an inferior quality. So disappointing...unfortunately, beggars can't be choosers I guess. I just thought I'd mention it. Also, at least for me it is ridiculously out of sync - something that never happened with your avis.
Most people are laughing about scene standards - but as much as they seem blown out of proportion and overly regulated - they are there for a reason..."
,rdkt11,2011-10-17T15:17Z,"Sorry about the lower quality for the finale, it annoyed me too.  But I am simply uploading the work of others that I found on the net.  I don't know why the last episode was changed, and I never found a better version.

About the slow uploads, on the days when my uploads were really slow, I was staying in the mountains in South America, so nothing could be done.   But I appreciate the offers for help.  Next time, I'll take you up on it."
