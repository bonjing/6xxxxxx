Spectral Finite Element Method
 Springer; 1st Edition | January 28, 2008 | ISBN-10: 1846283558 | 454 pages | PDF | 14 MB

 This book is the first to apply the Spectral Finite Element Method (SFEM) to inhomogeneous and anisotropic structures in a unified and systematic manner. Readers will gain understanding of how to formulate Spectral Finite Element; learn about wave behaviour in inhomogeneous and anisotropic media; and, be able to design some diagnostic tools for monitoring the health of a structure. Tables, figures and graphs support the theory and case studies are included.
