National Geographic: Collapse
Over 20th and 21st centuries, the rise of our civilization has seemed unstoppable. But could our modern, industrialized civilization fall apart like great ancient ones before us? Three hundred years from now, will scientists find evidence that we followed a recipe for disaster similar to that of the Maya or the Romans? To understand a sudden collapse, imagine it has already happened, National Geographic reveals a vivid look into the future to our descendants in the year 2310 as they set out on a scientific expedition to figure out what brought us down. A water crisis? Lack of energy sources? They search to find the single factor that tore our world apart.
The National Geographic Channel looks 200 years into the future in COLLAPSE, based on author Jared Diamond's book COLLAPSE: HOW SOCIETIES CHOOSE TO FAIL OR SUCCEED, to examine how current habits might affect humans' ability to survive. Directed by Noel Dockstader and narrated by Jamie Effros, this documentary examines how relationships among current methods could lead to human extinction. Shortages of land, water, and energy could potentially propel civilization to collapse; choices such as sustainable, local farming and organic practices are highlighted as ways to ensure life on Earth continues.
