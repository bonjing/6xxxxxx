Plot :
Lonny Smith, a young man with a suitcase full of money, who might drop dead at any moment is searching for love with each dying breath even if he has to pay for it. One is an ex-assassin slave runner, who operates a mail order bride scam exploiting prostitutes infected by HIV. Another is a mysterious club owner named Kyo, who manages a cabaret show and finally, a vixen named Nana, the girl who will bring it all crashing down. They all will carve their way through the macabre alleys of a magical land buried in South East Asia, a city named Pali, the city of gold. In two days their lives will twist and turn, slicing a bloody trail leading them to a cryptic divine plan to create a new Lotus. She is an individual that can heal anything she touches, only, the current Lotus is suicidal, and has promised never to heal again.

This two day adventure bereft with unfortunate players, in a do-or-die land, will entwine together in the most abstract of ways, to create a unique ethnically diverse surreal love-action-crime drama, that questions the importance of life and love. Through their eyes, we will uncover a miracle in the most unlikely of places.
