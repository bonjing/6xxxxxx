I don't know if you read old comments. The April 1961 issue you uploaded with the 1961 set is incorrect. The cover is correct, but about 2 pages in, the March cover shows up and the remainder of the issue is the March 1961 issue.

Any plans to upload the correct version with your same high quality?

Thx."

It's on its way, then he can upload it.

Sorry about the wait....
