This torrent was originally downloaded from demonoid and thanks to the original uploader. 

This version has been cleaned using wavepad sound editor, as the original was "hissy" due to it being copied from tapes. The sound, though not perfect, is significantly better than the original. Also removed should be all the "..end of tape 1, side 1......start of tape 1, side 2...etc. Additionally, the original was read/edited in such a way that there were elongated pauses between sentences. This to me got irritating after a while, so I painstakingly removed the long pauses, and now the flow has greatly improved. The additional amount of files is due to each one being cut to around 25-30 mins each.

Overall a highly recommendable book.
