SUMMARY:
At the end of the Ice Age, The Machine came from the outer space with the 
purpose to change men into mutants. However, a hero defeated the device and 
a great seal was laid over The Machine. In 2707, the depleted world is ruled 
by four Corporations: Mishima, Bauhaus, Capitol and Imperial that are in 
constant war. During a battle between Capitol and Bauhaus, the great seal 
is broken and The Machine works again transforming soldiers and civilians 
in hordes of mutants. A small part of the population escapes to Mars, 
leaving millions of people behind. The man of faith and leader of an 
ancient brotherhood Brother Samuel is a believer of God and the Chronicles, 
a bible about the mutants. With the city under siege of the mutants, 
he visits the Corporations' leader Constantine asking for an aircraft 
and twenty men for a suicide mission to destroy The Machine, planting 
a bomb and a detonator following the knowledge of the Chronicles. 
He recruits the tough Major 'Mitch' Hunter; the Bauhaus Lieutenant 
Maximillian von Steiner; the keeper of the Chronicles Severian that 
is under a vow of silence; the gorgeous and lethal Corporal Valerie Duval; 
Corporal Juba Kim Wu; Captain John McGuire; and Corporal Jesus 'El Jesus' 
de Barrera. Together they become the last hope of Earth against the evil mutants.
