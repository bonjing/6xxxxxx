 As scientific research increasingly requires the efforts of globally diverse, multidisciplinary teams from different laboratories and organizations, there surfaces a need to facilitate this kind of collaborative work. These large-scale scientific initiatives, where information technology plays an important role, are termed e-Science; e-Science activities employ geographically distributed resources like high performance computing facilities, scientific instruments, databases, and high performance networks. 

 Future Application and Middleware Technology on e-Science presents selected papers from the 2008 Korea e-Science All-Hands-Meeting (AHM 2008). Hosted by the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI), the Korea e-Science AHM was designed to bring together developers and users of e-Science applications and enabling information technologies from international and interdisciplinary research communities. The AHM 2008 conference served as a forum for engineers and scientists to present state-of-the-art research and product/tool developments, and to highlight related activities in all fields of e-Science.

 The following topics concerning e-Science are covered in this volume: 

 e-Science applications in Physics, Astronomy, and Chemistry
 e-Science applications in Bio-medicine and Life science
 e-Science applications in Geo-science with remote sensing
 e-Science applications in Climates and Earth systems
 e-Science applications in Engineering (Aerospace, Ship, Automobile, and etc)
 Grid technologies (Computing, Data, VO, and etc)
 Collaborative science models and techniques
 Enabling technologies of Workflows and Web services
 Resource management and scheduling
 Problem solving environments
 Scientific data management
 Application development environments
 Robust and transparent middleware
 Programming paradigms and models
 Software engineering tools
 Community development and engagement
 User outreach, training, and documentation 

 The works presented in this edited volume bring together cross-disciplinary information on e-Science in one cohesive source. This book is suitable for the professional audience composed of industry researchers and practitioners of e-Science. This volume is also suitable for advanced-level students in the field
