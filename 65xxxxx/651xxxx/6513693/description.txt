The Golden Girls, Seasons 1-7 Complete. (Comedy)

Cheers to the people who provided the original media to work with.  However, there were two noteworthy issues with these torrents/media.  1) The original rips were poorly encoded, so you can't seek with the videos without losing sound or burn to DVD, and 2) The original rips are needlessly large, with stretched videos making each file nearly twice as large as they need to be even with the original encoder.

I re-encoded the entire series using x264, resolving each issue.  Now you skip to portions of the video you want to and burn them to DVD without experiencing audio issues, at about 1/4 the original size. 

Also:
-files renamed to include season and series
-all in one directory

"The Golden Girls is based on the lives and interactions of four older women whom have all been divorced/widowed, and are now roommates. Dorothy's main goal during the series is to find a companion she can relate to while her mother Sophia adds her comical outlook and frequents "Picture This" stories. Rose's St. Olaf-ness makes her a little corny but lovable. One thing that changes nearly every episode is whom Blanche is courting. "
