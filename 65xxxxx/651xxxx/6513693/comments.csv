,Nitego,2011-08-27T00:32Z,"@Snatcher7, just download ps3mediaserver. "
,Harley81,2011-08-30T20:57Z,ok so I downloaded it but I cant find a player that will play MKV. Alittle help here....
,biblisaemi,2011-09-14T13:33Z,I love you for doing this. Really. ;)
,sphinxman10000,2011-09-22T07:49Z,"@Snatcher7 - H.264 (x264) is the encoder, the extension reflects the container type... You can use X264 for both mp4 and mkv. Also, the extension is visible when you download. Learn a bit about video encoding before you complain like a baby.  How about a thank you for the hours I spent on this? "
,effec75,2011-09-27T11:04Z,"damn thanks ;-) ... nice job man.  my fiancĂÂŠ is pretty stoked about getting all these, me too, they are funny as hell -- if you weren't just a random dude on teh 'net you'd be over here collecting some sweet 'n tasty thank you pussy (on condition we can film it ;-).  aside from me removing all the spaces and crap from filenames (am i the only CLI-master left?), the vids look pretty good.  kudos for using the best encoder *and* the best container -- so i didn't have to do a damn thing!  XMBC HTPC plays them nicely ... don't worry about dippy above that obviously cant use the web to find his answer faster than it takes to complain.  nice w3rk++"

,kkbb3000,2011-11-22T14:20Z,"I'm a techno twit, some help please, I've downloaded the files and normally watch on a USB chip via my Blu-ray player, it plays MVK files well but these it isn't, it tried to load, finds the time and ep name but doesn't display video or audio and just skips through the seasons.

Any advice would be appreciated, sorry for being dumb."
,kkbb3000,2011-11-22T14:23Z,"Why wont these play vie a USB chip on my blu-ray player? other mvk files do, sorry to be a twit."
