Teracopy Pro 2.12 Feautures :

TeraCopy is a file-copying utility that offers more speed and
security than Windows. It's a compact tool that can quickly copy or move single files
or batches of files to any directory you select, but it does much more, such as
automatically calculating CRC checksum values to speed up the validation process.
It also skips bad files during the copying process, displaying them at the end of
transfers so you can see just which ones need replacing or other attention.
