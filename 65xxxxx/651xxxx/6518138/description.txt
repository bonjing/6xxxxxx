David Bazan (born January 1976) is an indie rock singer-songwriter from Seattle, Washington. Bazan (pronounced "buh-zahn") was the lead singer and creative force behind the now-defunct band Pedro the Lion and was the lead singer of Headphones, a band he formed out of his interest in synthesizers. In early 2006, he began performing and recording solo. Bazan is currently touring the United States with a full band for the first time in almost five years.
