Album Reviews (c/o amazon)

Holly Johnson proved that he was more than just a cog in the ZTT machine
with his first solo release for MCA, Blast. Pure pop, with some great synth-disco leanings.
This album contains the popular sinlges Americanos and Love Train, plus the big,
lush ballad, Heaven's Here.

The album starts off with the brilliant 'Atomic City' which has great vocals
and some catchy lyrics. 'Heaven's Here' is a lush ballad which shows the great vocals from
Holly as well as a memorable tune. 'Americanos' is probably the best known song from Holly.
A instant hit of the time with its extremely catchy chorus, well written lyrics and tune.
'Deep In Love' is a very catchy track with some nice lyrics. 'S.U.C.C.E.S.S.' although isn't a
stand out track, the words are memorable. The 'Love Train' track has to be my favourite track
of all time. The lyrics are incredible, the tune fits perfectly and the chorus is catchy.
'Got It Made' shows Holly's vocals well with a memorable chorus. 'Love Will Come' has some
brilliant lyrics. 'Perfume' is a catchy dance track. 'Feel Good' shows one of the stand outs on the album.
Holy's vocals are incredible and the song is a catchy but calmer track to finish the album.
