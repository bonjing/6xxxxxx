Motley Crue Live in Las Vegas June 18, 2011 Red Rock

For the die hard Crue Heads from me! I filmed this myself with a Kodak Playsport HD camcorder. Some of the camera work is shaky but if you love the Crue, this is worth watching. I even got the surprise beginning explosions before Wildside. It's pretty much the entire show minus some talking and I believe S.O.S. and Don't go Away Mad missing the beginning. I have no idea how to shrink the filesize, I used Power Director to put the individual clips together. If anyone can advise me on how to do that I would be happy to resubmit it.
