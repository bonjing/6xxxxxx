 A basic introduction to mathematical modelling, this book encourages the reader to participate in the investigation of a wide variety of modelling examples. These are carefully paced so that readers can identify and develop the skills which are required for successful modelling. The examples also promote an appreciation of the enormous range of problems to which mathematical modelling skills can usefully be applied.
