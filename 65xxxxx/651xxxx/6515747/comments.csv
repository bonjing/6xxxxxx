,girlsinhawaii,2011-07-15T17:28Z,"Help please - I cannot see the mouse cursor, only when you slide over a hot spot the name shows but still it's 'tre' instead of 'tree' or 'bir'/'bird' so there's definately something wrong.

I run the game as admin and in the XP mode(i have vista)."
,gorristor,2011-07-16T01:25Z,"Installs fine. However somewhere in chapter 4 I encountered severe graphic glitches and a game stopping crash. Dont really know what to do about that. Would like to hear if someone else ran into this problem.
