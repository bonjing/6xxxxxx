RELEASE NOTES

A New Beginning is a cinematic, interactive eco-thriller. In this
classic adventure game, an impending global climate cataclysm threatens
the world, in a story ripped from today's headlines, dealing with the
defining issue of our time. At locations all around the globe, players
will have to try and stem the tide - with the whole world hanging in
the balance.

In A New Beginning, players take control of two protagonists and
explore the detailed, hand-painted backgrounds. The more than 30
characters are rendered in a realistic 2D style and are painstakingly
animated by hand in feature film quality. Many challenging puzzles and
adventurous situations have to be overcome to prevent the impending
climate chaos.

Scientist Bent Svensson has had to give up on his life's work of trying
to engineer an eco-friendly alternative energy source. But his
existence as a reluctant retiree is interrupted by a most peculiar
visitor: The young Fay claims to have been sent from the future to
prevent an impending environmental catastrophe. The only remaining hope
is Bent's research which is about to fall into the hands of an
unscrupulous energy magnate. Bent decides to trust the young woman -
but is she really telling the truth?
