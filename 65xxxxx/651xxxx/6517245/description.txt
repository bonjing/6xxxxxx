 This volume contains the Proceedings of the conference "Complex and Differential Geometry 2009", held at Leibniz UniversitÃ¤t Hannover, September 14 - 18, 2009. It was the aim of this conference to bring specialists from differential geometry and (complex) algebraic geometry together and to discuss new developments in and the interaction between these fields. Correspondingly, the articles in this book cover a wide area of topics, ranging from topics in (classical) algebraic geometry through complex geometry, including (holomorphic) symplectic and poisson geometry, to differential geometry (with an emphasis on curvature flows) and topology.
