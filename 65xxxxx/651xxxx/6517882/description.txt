\'The White Bus\' is a 1967 short film by British director Lindsay Anderson starring Patricia Healey, and featuring Anthony Hopkins and Arthur Lowe. The screenplay was jointly adapted[1] with Shelagh Delaney from a short story in her 1963 collection Sweetly Sings the Donkey.[2]
It was originally commissioned by producer Oscar Lewenstein as one third of a feature comprising three short films based on Delaney stories that would also have included contributions from Anderson\'s Free cinema collaborators Tony Richardson and Karel Reisz.[3]
Locations featured include Manchester City Center, predominately around Manchester Town Hall, Central Library and Piccadilly Gardens, although Cross St is featured in one shot. Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Central Stations are also shown. The \"model estate\" of high rise flats was shot on the Kersal Flats estate, home to the notorious Moors murderers, Myra Hindley and Ian Brady, whilst the factory sequences were shot in Trafford Park, notably in the Metropolitan Vickers works. Both the exterior and interior shots of the school are certainly set in the the former Pendleton High School for Girls now mainly demolished, but with the original Victorian building converted to a retirement home.
