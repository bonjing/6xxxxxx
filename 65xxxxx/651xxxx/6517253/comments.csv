,ihavenoblackfriends,2011-07-10T06:00Z,anyone else have a clicking noise on their d/l?
,ihavenoblackfriends,2011-07-11T19:13Z,"i thought it was part of the background music, but @ 10:40 in, you can hear it with only conversation

its like a little speaker click or pop, only a millisecond long, but you hear it often (especially around 00:59 seconds in)

99% sure its not supposed to be there"
,ihavenoblackfriends,2011-07-11T19:46Z,"just downloaded a non-highres version, the popping / clicking isnt on that version

i think both highres versions have the noise in it
