Johnny Allen Hendrix was born on November 27, 1942, in Seattle, Washington, the first of five children to James Allen "Al" Hendrix[19] (10 June 1919, Vancouver, British Columbia â€“ 17 April 2002, Renton, Washington) and Lucille Jeter (12 October 1925, Seattle, Washington â€“ 2 February 1958, Renton, Washington). Early on September 18, 1970, Jimi Hendrix died in London. He had spent the latter part of the previous evening at a party and was picked up by girlfriend Monika Dannemann and driven to her flat at the Samarkand Hotel, 22 Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill. Hendrix's body was eturned to Seattle and he was interred in Greenwood Memorial Park, Renton, Washington.

Hendrix synthesized many styles in creating his musical voice and his guitar style was unique, later to be abundantly imitated by others. Despite his hectic touring schedule and notorious perfectionism, he was a prolific recording artist and left behind more than 300 unreleased recordings. Hendrix owned and used a variety of guitars during his career. However, his guitar of choice (and the instrument that became most associated with him), was the Fender Stratocaster. He started playing the model in 1966 and thereafter used it prevalently in his stage performances and recordings. The Hendrix sound combined high volume and high power, feedback manipulation, and a range of cutting-edge guitar effects. He was also known for his trick playing, which included playing with only his right (fretting) hand and using his teeth or playing behind his back and between his legs.
