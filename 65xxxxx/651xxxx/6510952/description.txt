About quality of current audio tracks.
Now it takes level "MP3-Complaint with KyuAerostat Project". Also DJs should accept it as friendly for music mixing. More, please, check http://simbatango.com/2011/01/18/improved-loudness-correction-with-ebu-r128/ 

Quality requirements was:

1. All tracks have correct tags. 

2. All tracks have same psychoacoustic level. You don't need to move your volume at all. To know more about level equalization please read Wikipedia - ReplayGain. For creating this tracks we use Foobar2000 compilation for project KyuAerostat version 1.7. Please, use our compilation to convert your tracks to project quality and easy use them everythere. 
For more info please read project docs.
Your tracks can pass KueAerostat and DJ-sound compatibility. Now foobar2000 use libebur128 to calculate ReplayGain values. 

3. Normal MP3 quality for project is "as good as it possible". To keep size of MP3 files effective we set maximum quality to Lame V0 (depend on source) with TrackGain applied. 

We are looking for other Allen Carr's books on all available languages. Please, join common task to be healthy.

Thank you.

Good Luck.
