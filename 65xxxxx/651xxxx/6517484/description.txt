An ancient Ring thought lost for centuries has been found, and through a strange twist in fate

the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron, Frodo must make an epic quest to the Cracks of
Doom in order to destroy it! However he does not go alone. He is joined by Gandalf, Legolas
the elf, Gimli the Dwarf, Aragorn, Boromir and his three Hobbit friends Merry, Pippin and
Samwise. Through mountains, snow, darkness, forests, rivers and plains, facing evil and
danger at every corner the Fellowship of the Ring must go. Their quest to destroy the One
Ring is the only hope for the end of the Dark Lords reign!
