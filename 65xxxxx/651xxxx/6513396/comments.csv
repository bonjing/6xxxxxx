,SonOfBasuto,2011-07-04T18:28Z,"Thanks very much - I only had eleven of his books, so this will fill in the blanks very nicely.

(BTW, for anyone needing to convert these files, like me to EPUB for my Nook, Calibre works great and it's a free download. Will convert to many different formats.)"
,t4akawolf,2011-07-05T00:38Z,"I used Calibre myself. Most of the books were in in LIT and, incidentally, EPUB format. Since PDF is the most common and the software required to view MOBI files was small, I converted them to those formats with Calibre. Talk about coincidence and irony, huh :P ?"
