Congratulations, zombies, you've got yourself a mouthful of fresh, juicy, living FAIL!

Even the best of zombies (such as they are) don't always get their prey. Slips, trips, flips and other mips - er, mishaps can befall them at any time, usually when it's funniest. We've captured some of these heart-warming, rib-tickling, brain-missing moments to share and enjoy with all of you.
