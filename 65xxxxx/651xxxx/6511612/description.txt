About The Book
Douglas Jacksonâ€™s debut novel Caligula (recently reviewed and enjoyed by Simon A) is the first in a three-book series set in ancient Rome, and centres on the character of Rufus, a young slave. 
Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, the third Roman Emperor, is better known by another name: Caligula, a name synonymous with decadence, cruelty and madness. 
Rufus, a young slave, grows up far from the corruption of the imperial court. His master is a trainer of animals for the gladiatorial arena, and Rufus discovers that he has a natural talent for controlling the animals. It is at the arenas that Rufus meets his great friend Cupido, one of Romeâ€™s greatest gladiators. His growing reputation as an animal trainer and his friendship with Cupido attracts the cruel gaze of the Emperor. Rufus is bought from his master and taken to the imperial palace. Intrigue permeates his court, and Rufus and Cupido find themselves at the centre of a conspiracy to assassinate Caligula. But can a slave decide the fate of an Emperor?
