The book

Between 1485-1688 England became a protestant Country under Henry VIII: his daughter Elizabeth battled for succession at home and supremacy abroad and the discovery of 'the round world' enabled a vast continent across the Atlantic to be explored. Whilst this new era spawned the beginnings of modern America, England was engaged in a bloody civil war... This is the second volume in Churchill's famous account, it remains a testament to the skill and insight of a remarkable storyteller and historian.
