 This much anticipated second edition provides a user-friendly, up-to-date handbook of reliable immunochemical techniques optimized for molecular biologists. It covers the breadth of relevant established methods from protein blotting and immunoassays through to visualization of cellular antigens and in situ hybridization, each with their latest refinements. Protocols for the production and purification of important classes of immunochemical reagents are also provided, including "conventional" and recombinant antibodies, fusion proteins and their various conjugates. This book will open the door to a new generation of immunochemical reagents with exciting possibilities.
