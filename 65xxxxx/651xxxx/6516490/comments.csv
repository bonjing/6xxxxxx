obrigado!!!!!"
,stonerz101,2011-07-05T08:19Z,so im guessing we download there new Crysis and then replace these with cracks?
,tiboka,2011-07-05T10:53Z,Köszi!
,DJ Logix,2011-07-05T16:01Z,"My Crysis 2 is installed in the default dir so I ran this and it searched and couldnt find it, so I reinstalled crysis 2 and ran the patch and got the same result, anyone else having a problem like this and or know how I can fix this, Thanx."
,mlgpro512,2011-07-05T16:54Z,Im having the same problem as DJ Logix. Any help would be awesome.
,siki20,2011-07-05T17:07Z,Wee need multiplayer CRACK
,s3nr1,2011-07-05T17:46Z,You'll need the original crysis2.exe for the installer to find your game directory and patch.
,lucbm,2011-07-05T18:04Z,"Dj Logix and mlgpro512, you need the original exe to be able to update the game."
,plugNplay,2011-07-05T19:46Z,"i cant open it... it comes with 12 files, the .nfo and an .sfv. i joined the 12 parts using hjsplit, and it leaves a flt-cry2u19p that i cant extract anything, cuz i dont know what to do, since it doesn.t have a file extention.

Help please! 

PS (for instaling this, do i need to have the game installed without any crack and then install this one, without a 1.9 crack?)"
,Cooleditor,2011-07-05T20:27Z,hi
,Cooleditor,2011-07-05T20:36Z,"@playNplay

these files can be extracted with winrar, but not easily,
because files not named as standard *.rar

and yes, first install crysis2 iso
then run Crysis2Patch19.exe (and DX11 pack if you need it)
finally add Fairlights cracked Crysis2.exe (v1.9)

and i cant extract it without it, it seems... btw, where is the 1.9 crack? in the .rar only as the patch"
,Cooleditor,2011-07-05T22:08Z,"goto extratorrent dot com and search
""crysis fltdox""

you will find full v1.9 release from Fairlight already extracted,
including both patch and crack"
,rqstd,2011-07-05T22:13Z,"how are you guys installing patch 1.9? i keep getting the  ""game directory not found"" error, even with the original .exe. any suggestions?"
,plugNplay,2011-07-05T22:49Z,thank u guys!
,forgetit,2011-07-05T23:14Z,"This one crashes on me sometimes, freezes my pc with stuttering sound. Only resetting helps. The modified skidrow crack works fine so far. Ah well, it's a crappy game anyways.  :-) Towards the end it gets completely ridicoulous.

,tripoleks,2011-07-06T08:07Z,"installed it with no problems, and as .nfo says, resume and loading save games work flawlessly! guaranteed! ^__^"
,plugNplay,2011-07-06T10:59Z,"i must look like a noob, but i downloaded the one u said from extratorrent, then i tried to open the patch and a memory location problem apeared, and i did not change a thing in the game folder!"
,Cooleditor,2011-07-06T14:49Z,"@ all who downloaded from extratorrent from my previous post

That Crysis2Patch19.exe file seems infected !

Rename that .exe to .rar and extract

You find 2 extracted files - the small file ""dll.exe"" is TROJAN - remove it

The big file is the patch - it is ok

I recommend you scan your computers with Antimalware
from Malwarebytes dot com

Sorry about this :("
,plugNplay,2011-07-06T17:56Z,"finally it worked, ty guys"
,dumas1000,2011-07-07T05:33Z,"I got wierd graphical glitches from the version mentioned by forgetit. Scrambled radar. Screen becoming all distorted, like a bad acid trip. And rain falling on your visor when it's not raining. Just bizarre, bizarre stuff. I'll try this one. Crysis 2 updates require the original .exe, which I never keep. I had to redownload the entire game first and then reinstall it."
,Jess100100,2011-07-07T09:10Z,"When I download I get 14 files, I've tried putting them all into bin32 in the game directory and it doesn't seem right and doesn't work what am I doing wrong?"

,towbolz23,2011-07-07T18:06Z,crysis  2 v1.9 cracked - FLTDOX from ET has a trojan virus..it was already been deleted from the torrent..is this the same from ET without the small dll.exe file? is this working?
,towbolz23,2011-07-07T19:00Z,i think both crack from SKIDROW & FAIRLIGHT works..the only problem is in the update/patches v1.9..the game crashes and you cannot load saved games..
,towbolz23,2011-07-07T21:32Z,"@ Jess100100,

extract the .p001 file using 7zip..the extracted file contains the cracked (fairlight folder) and the crysis2v1.9 update file..make sure to use the original crysis2.exe (which you will put into the installed directory) before running the update/patch..after updating, copy the crack crysis2.exe to the installed directory replacing the original file.."
,Argineboy,2011-07-07T23:41Z,finished the game with this crack.
,saran287,2011-07-08T12:02Z,"after patching and applying the crack i tried to run the game and i get an error message saying ""the application configuration is incorrect"".

Ive tried reinstalling the game and i cant get to run the game...pls help"
,towbolz23,2011-07-08T15:37Z,ok i tried this update/cracked and it works fine..i can load saved games and no crashes so far..thanks for the upload..

,Fr4zr,2011-08-21T16:54Z,Okay forget last post fixed that. but the patch still won't find my install any ideas why and what to do i've already reinstalled twice and it still doesnn't work thanks again
,filt78,2011-09-08T19:46Z,How the fuck can i unpack this? and why the fuck there is any instructions on what software to use WHY THE FUCK'? 
,bscroom,2011-09-10T03:38Z,"after extracting, i get a file called flt-cry2u19p. do i rename this to crysis2.exe and put it in C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\Crytek\Crysis 2\bin32\?

if i do that and try to run it, it says version incompatible with Windows etc."
,bscroom,2011-09-10T03:41Z,"ok, i found the files using 7zip.

DO NOT USE HJSPLIT!

,DanynS,2011-09-21T01:53Z,how do i get the patch to locate the crysis2 file installed on my pc. says it cannot locate the file
,Conin,2011-10-02T08:43Z,"Thanks!, this is the good one!."
,erech2k2,2011-10-26T21:49Z,"Much props and thanks for the patch.  I downloaded the patch to my Z drive (where the game is installed).  When I start the patch it is taking forever searching for the game directory obv starting with the C: drive.  After watching it crawl through my C: drive, I watched it search right through the game directory (which was renamed).   While I have my fingers crossed and faith that your patch will actually fix the game loading crash, the Skidrow 1.9 update quickly identified the game directory with no problem.  "
,Caldrumr,2011-11-02T00:47Z,"This all installs fine, but I can't seem to install the high res texture pack. I tried downloading it from three locations, with the same results: ""Failed to extract file from archive: diff_000001.dif.""  I tried restarting, uninstalling the game, installing the patch from a different location, and using different locations for the texture pack.  Nothing works.  The tessellation patch works fine.  
Is there any workaround to this, like files that I can copy over manually?  Thanks in advance."
,AlienHack,2011-12-08T20:44Z,"so that works 100% i just checked it.
loads fine!  :-)
