Treasure Seekers: Lost Cities of the Inca
A National Geographic documentary of the Inca, the greatest empire in the new world explored through the lives of two men, Hirem Bingham who revealed the Inca civilization to the world and Francisco de Toledo who was determined to destroy it centuries before.
Rumours of a 'lost' Inca city had abounded for centuries until a young academic fought through the impenetrable jungles of Peru and found Machu Picchu - surely one of the finest cites on Earth. After the Spanish conquest of the Inca world in 1532, the surviving Incas retreated into Vilcabamba, one of the most remote regions of their empire. Follow how Professor Hiram Bingham set out in search of this lost empire which was left abandoned after the Incas were wiped out. Setting out in search of Vilcabamba, a hidden jungle city built in one of the more remote and inaccessible regions of the Inca Empire, Hiram Bingham stumbled upon one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of the century-the magnificent ruins of Machu Picchu, which opened up the glories of the Inca civilisation to the entire world.
