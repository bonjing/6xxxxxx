Intrada presents Observations, a recording of Symphony In The Glenâ€™s historic concert at Griffith Observatory on October 4, 2009 to mark
the launch of the Observatory's Cosmic Conjunction. The main highlight of the CD is the premiere of Arthur B. Rubinstein's 20-minute "Observations." In "Observations," the composer seeks to touch on that sense of the infinite which exists within each of us; creating a â€˜time travelogueâ€™ in music, from the primitive mysticism of the Ancients to the symphonic â€œbig bangâ€ of the Moderns. The piece draws from both the composerâ€™s childhood and adult experiences. Thus, "Observations," while not strictly â€œprogrammatic,â€ is a reflection of the child-like wonder and awe we all feel when contemplating the boundless reaches of space. The piece appears twice on this CD -- once with the narration by Leonard Nimoy and a second time without. Also featured on this CD are works by Claudio Monteverdi, Jean-Phillipe Rameau, Henri Duparc, and Darius Milhaud.

Cosmic Conjunction was developed â€œto present original, substantive, artful, and unexpected perspectives on the relationship between astronomy and the artsâ€ and fell during the International Year of Astronomy, in recognition of the 400th anniversary of Galileoâ€™s telescopic discoveries. The music spans the 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st centuries, and each work expresses the composerâ€™s interpretation of some aspect of the cosmosâ€”Â¬mythical, poetic, theatrical and historical. Each embraces both the simplicities and complexities of â€˜musicalizingâ€™ the cosmos, as well as the mystery and romance of the night sky.
