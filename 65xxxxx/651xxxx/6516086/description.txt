SCRATCH - DC Comics [feat. Batman]
By: Sam Keith
Issues #1 - 5 [Complete]

'A young werewolf stalks the DC Univese.'

This one is hard to describe and quite rare. This follows a young man/werewolf on 
a surreal adventure. The story is very bizarre but interesting. The artwork is
beautiful and you should read it, if for no other reason than that alone. Batman does
make a brief appearance but its more a gimmick to sell the book than an actual Batman
adventure. Chek it out.


Enjoy and Please SEED
