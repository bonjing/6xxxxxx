Whenever I think of Marcus - my all-time music hero - I always get in a sentimental mood. I always feel like I am walking, drifting in an endless dream that has no heavenly destination because the musical journey that he takes you on is paradise itself! And Tutu Revisited is a magical carpet ride of a journey. Whilst many musicians are trying to revisit classical musical eras of yesteryears and failing miserably, Marcus - as always - succeeds and excels. He makes old music sound brand new. Like you have never heard it before. He always manages to deliver killer funky riffs and the finest example of this is "Splatch" probably the funkiest track on the album. Marcus also delves into a bit of reggae vibe with "Don't Lose Your Mind" proving once again that he has the midas touch and can do just about anything musically. But the ultimate track on this album is the best ever and finest ever rendition of an ageless classic "In A Sentimental Mood" and it does exactly what it says on the tin. It is so beautiful, it is like a dream within a dream. Marcus isn't just a bass guitarist, he is a bass clarinetist and he gives one of his finest performances on this rarely heard and used instrument. In my opinion, it should be heard more often! Marcus's bass clarinet is perfectly complimented with a superb performance from a young alto saxophonist Alex Han - who is most definitely one to watch out for! Thanks Marcus for this latest offering of paradise. It is worth every golden coin I have hiding in my treasure chest! ~ Hannah Trinnaman
