Boxed Set, released on 7 September 1990 is a boxed set of the English rock group Led Zeppelin's popular songs digitally remastered, on six vinyl albums, four compact discs, and four cassette formats. Compilation and remastering of the tracks took place in New York during early-to-mid 1990. A 30-page booklet was included for the vinyl and CD releases.

This boxed set contains two previously-unreleased tracks and a new mix. "Travelling Riverside Blues" was recorded on 24 June 1969 at the BBC Maida Vale Studio. "White Summer" was recorded at the Playhouse Theatre, London on 27 June 1969. The "Moby Dick"/"Bonzo's Montreux" mix took place at the Atlantic Synclavier Suite in New York, in May 1990.

To differentiate this release from the future Remasters box sets, some world recording industry associations have listed this under the title The Complete Collection (not to be confused with the later 1993 release The Complete Studio Recordings).

In an interview he gave in January 2010, Page made reference to the Boxed Set:

Oh, I'm now fully aware of the mark Led Zeppelin made on the musical landscape. My awareness was re-heightened when we were remastering the material to do that CD box set in 1990. When you hear it all, song after song, you realise what a textbook it is for musicians who are coming along, and that's so great. The whole thing is about passing it on, because that's how it was done for me when I was learning from all those old blues and rockabilly records. It's all part of how this cultural phenomenon keeps moving on. I think everyone carries the flame on.[1]

Enjoy this monster. one thing about this pressing. it was pressed on very flimsy vinyl which I suppose was the norm for 1990 so there is a little more surface noise than usual. still a very enjoyable well balanced non-brick-walled listen compared to the Mothership and early days and latter days vinyls.
