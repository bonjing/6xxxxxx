[DESCRIPTION.]:
The Tour de France is an annual bicycle race held in France
and nearby countries. First staged in 1903, the race covers
more than 3,600 kilometres (2,200 mi) and lasts three weeks.
As the best known and most prestigious of cycling's three
"Grand Tours", the Tour de France attracts riders and teams
from around the world. The race is broken into day-long
segments, called stages. Individual times to finish each stage
are aggregated to determine the overall winner at the end of
the race. The rider with the lowest aggregate time at the end
of each day wears a yellow jersey. The course changes every
year, but the race has always finished in Paris. Since 1975,
the climax of the final stage has been along the Champs-
lyses.

Note: Australian commentary, shouldn't be too much of a
problem for international audiences though...
