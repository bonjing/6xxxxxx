Description

Only Pumpkin and the venerable Master Librarian Stour have been left to defend Moledom's greatest library against the Newborn Inquisitors, but his best hope lies with Privet, scholar and scribemole, and her adopted son, Whillan, who have escaped from the wood in search of the Book of Silence. They must go to Caer Caradoc, and face the Newborns' sinister leader, Thripp, and must reveal all the grim secrets of her past, giving up all hope of reconciliation with the only mole she has truly loved, Rooster, Master of the Delve. Only then can she embark on the most daunting journey of all.
