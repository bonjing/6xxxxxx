Fear not; I proofed the books far more thoroughly than the description. :^)

Ah.. and I didn't snip "".pdf"" off Microcosmic Tales.

Guess I was enthused to be finally done the project."

Thanks"

A couple of things that I left out of the description as well:

- I of course repaginated all of the books to the optimum e-reader page size, so the pages don't match up with the original books.

- There are at least two duplicate stories in the collection; ""The Rag Thing"" and ""Displaced Person"" come to mind as being in more than one of the four books."
