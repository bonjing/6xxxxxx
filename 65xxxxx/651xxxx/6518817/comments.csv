,Lone_Foxx,2011-07-06T05:27Z,"Hey you have some nice looking torrents, great old school collections when games where games and not this BS we have now days where the game almost plays itself.

Don't get discouraged by these people who cry wolf for no reason other then their own ignorance. Which is total shit, I mean Vietcong was such a hardcore game as I recall.

I'm sure if you continue to upload more of the same quality collections then you will get more seeders and support.

,motley666,2011-07-06T17:17Z,"luke use combatibility mode.

ganjaripz i understand that music is ripped right? If so, half the game is missing because the music in Unreal is amazing and must be there. Anyway, good choice for an upload. I had na pali mission pack on this site for years but tpb erased my account with no reason, so i will up it soon again for those interested."
,lukegoodman2001,2011-07-06T17:33Z,"ofcourse i did, no luck tried playing with the ini still no luck"
,ganjaripz,2011-07-06T18:21Z,"@motley666:
The music is NOT RIPPED.
It is 100% Complete Unreal Gold + DX11 & TEXTURES.

@Lukegoodman:
You need this:
Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86)
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=5555"
,ganjaripz,2011-07-06T18:22Z,"Proof it works:

,ganjaripz,2011-07-06T18:53Z,"Otherwhise you might have to reinstall the DX11 Driver/Windows update again.

I've tested this on a other computer before uploading, and it worked like a charm.

Just extract it, Launch the Game, There is only 1 graphics driver remaining to choose, the DX 11 one.

If it doesnt work, its something on your computer thats needs installing/updating!

If you get a certain error, plz tell me what it is, ill try to help you guys!"
,rotxam2,2011-07-12T17:12Z,Wow!  looks just as good as my Voodoo card did.  Rest in Peace Voodoo.

examples:

http://kentie.net/article/d3d10drv/detail_pom.jpg

it says dx10 driver in the url, but the creater updated it to dx11.

The render difference is not that difference of the old skool Unreal, But the TEXTURES sure ass hell make a big difference in allot of the maps"

No sry this will only work on Vista / W7 with Directx11 installed and a Directx11 Videocard.
