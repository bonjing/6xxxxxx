 This innovative and timely Handbook brings together the work of 25 leading human rights scholars from all over the world to consider a broad range of human rights topics. The book discusses a wide range of contemporary themes, for example jurisdictional issues, such as human rights in the private sphere and extra-territorial obligations. It also deals with global and regional human rights systems, intersections with other areas of international law and practice, such as international criminal law and globalisation, and specific human rights topics including terrorism and indigenous peoples. Providing an excellent grounding for scholars seeking to understand the major topics within the discipline, this book is accessible to the novice human rights scholar, yet of great interest to the most seasoned human rights researcher. It will strongly appeal to law academics as well as students and practitioners of human rights.
