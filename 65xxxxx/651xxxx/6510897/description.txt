RELEASE  NOTES



Xilinx introduced the ISE Design Suite software to enable

breakthrough optimizations for power and cost with greater design

productivity. For the first time, ISE design tools deliver 'intelligent'

clock-gating technology that reduces dynamic power consumption by as

much as 30 percent. The new suite also provides advances in

timing-driven design preservation, AMBA 4 AXI4-complaint IP support for

plug-and-play design, and an intuitive design flow with

fourth-generation partial reconfiguration capabilities that lowers

system cost for a broad range of high performance applications.



With full production support for all Xilinx Virtex-6 and Spartan-6

FPGA families, the ISE release continues its evolution as the

industry's only domain-specific design suite with interoperable design

flows and tool configurations for logic, digital signal processing

(DSP), embedded processing, and system-level design. In addition, Xilinx

incorporated a number of software infrastructure and methodology

enhancements that improve run time, streamline system integration, and

expand IP interoperability across its latest generation device families

and Targeted Design Platforms.



Intelligent Automation for Power Optimization



ISE Design Suite introduces the FPGA industry's first intelligent

clock-gating technology with fully automated analysis and fine-grain

(logic slice) optimization capabilities specifically developed to reduce

the number of transitions, a primary contributing factor of dynamic

power dissipation in digital designs. The technology works by analyzing

designs using a series of unique algorithms to detect sequential

elements...
