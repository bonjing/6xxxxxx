To follow the Merantau tradition, Yuda, a Minangkabau, a master in the art of Silat, left his home to seek experience and success. He planned to teach Silat to the children of Jakarta. He found that the address where he was meant to stay had been torn down. Yuda became homeless. His wallet was stolen by a child named Adit. Chasing the thief, Yuda then encountered the thief's sister, Astri quarrelling with her boss, Johnny. When Johnny began abusing Astri, Yuda intervened. Yuda saved Astri but instead of gratitude, he was rebuked because she had become jobless as a result. Yuda becomes Astri's protector as two European high-class thugs chase after her with the purpose of enslaving her in the world of foreign sex trade.
