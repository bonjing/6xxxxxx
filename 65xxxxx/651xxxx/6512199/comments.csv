@agent

,casan0vax,2011-07-07T10:16Z,"I really appreciate this rip - it's definitely the best out there in terms of quality and the fact that it's in the native language with soft-coded English subs. The encoding, however, leaves a little to be desired. The picture quality is very good, but the audio... it's encoded in mono at 39kbps with a sample rate of 24kHz. This accounts for the very small file size, but also unfortunately, for rather poor audio. At various points in the movie, the audio cuts out and is replaced by sporadic static and white noise which gets a little hard on the ears.

Again, I appreciate the rip and I thank you for taking the time to do it - I'm just posting this as a warning to others who might want to download this.
