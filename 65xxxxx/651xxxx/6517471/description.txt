Presents assembly language from the high-level programmer's point of view, so you can start writing meaningful programs within days. The High Level Assembler (HLA) that accompanies the book is the first assembler that allows you to write portable assembly language programs that run under either Linux or Windows with nothing more than a recompile. The CD-ROM includes the HLA and the HLA Standard Library, all the source code from the book, and over 50,000 lines of additional sample code, all well-documented and tested. The code compiles and runs as-is under Windows and Linux.
