                Fast-paced thriller about the trafficking of children
                who are brought to Britain for a better life but end
                up working outside of the system. Working in the
                Human Trafficking Unit, Detective Inspector Anthony
                Carter has a wall of snapshots in his office of
                unknown children; children without passports, without
                identity, without family, without hope, who have been
                smuggled into this country to be enslaved and
                exploited. And if he could save just one of them, all
                of his work would be worthwhile.
