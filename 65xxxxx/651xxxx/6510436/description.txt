Uploader's Comments:

Those episodes as well as this song received high praise from fans, and the episode: inner Light 5x25 won the Hugo Award for best dramatic presentation. I highlight that from Wikipedia to show that I am not the only person moved by this song, and these episodes. 

As such I wanted to make this song more widely available, as I had to search extensively just to find it. I don't believe this to breaking any copy write laws as the song can be found at:

I just recorded it, and put it into MP3 format for ease of use. 

The Orchestra version can be found here:

However there are intermitant high pitched beeps which ruins it.

Enjoy! and please seed at least a 1:1 ratio...
