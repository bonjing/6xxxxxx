About:

The editors at New Scientist magazine (Does Anything Eat Wasps?, 2005) are at it again, dredging up from the magazineâ€™s archives stories that bring to life the wacky side of science and scientists. This time the organizing principle is the remarkable ingenuity shown by hard-working scientists, ingenuity that sometimes verges on, well, craziness. Think of this book as a science edition of the Darwin Awards, only (mostly) not so fatal: these are stories of hands-on research performed by dedicated, if often decidedly offbeat, individuals. Like the biologist who tried to use a remote-controlled miniature helicopter to capture freshly expelled whale snot; or the researchers who used models of turkeys to determine the â€œminimum stimulus it takes to excite a male turkeyâ€; or the physician who tried to measure the weight of a human using a dying patient and a wooden beam; or the Italian fellow who told police he could determine a suspectâ€™s guilt or innocence by examining his internal organs. A deeply fascinating and occasionally rib-tickling book.
