Do you take requests? 
If you do, then can you perhaps upload Motorhead's discography at 320kbps please? I would be grateful. "

I researched your archive and I did not found 3 very important bands' discography at 320kbps.

Poison, Twisted Sisters and Firehouse.

Could you upload this bands' discography at 320kbps please? I would be so grateful."
