Hey this is the real thing.

Thanks for the upload TvFantom."
,Bshroom,2011-07-04T17:52Z,"Yup, Benders ghost. So it's the right one.

Maybe he got the season wrong or whatever. ""Do we start a new season? Or do we just pile on the numbers from last time?"" There seems to be alot of confusion on what is the right numbers. Same thing with Mythbusters. But what counts is that it's the right episode. You can always rename it later...

This is the real deal.

Or maybe it's horrible and illegal porn mixed in halfway trough it, and Im actually writing this on my stinky cell phone (wich I cleverly hid inside my ass) from the back of a police van... We may never know..."
