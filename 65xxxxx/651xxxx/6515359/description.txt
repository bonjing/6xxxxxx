Fight To Get In, Fight To Get Out. The Circuit. It,s an underground fight club with no rules, no limits, no mercy where millions are paid and legends are made. Only one man was ever tough enough to walk away alive and undefeated. But now, the gangsters have got his brother and the only way he can save him is by entering the ring once more.  International Kickboxing champion and hunk Olivier Gruner is Dirk Longstreet the only man capable of using his fists, his feet and his fury to fight his way back and take down The Circuit, forever.
