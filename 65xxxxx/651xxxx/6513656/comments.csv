,sergio.amoni,2011-10-07T10:06Z,"no it is not an action movie...it is the story of the National Truck drivers union...very very intense movie, serious one one of the best of Stallone before he started the Rambo and Rocky sagas. My opinion is that this movie should be considered a classic one ...very true , with mafia and politicians involved.....a very good one"
,sergio.amoni,2011-10-07T10:08Z,"F.I.S.T. is a 1978 movie directed by Norman Jewison and starring Sylvester Stallone. In this film, Stallone plays a Cleveland warehouse worker named Johnny Kovak who becomes involved in the labor union leadership of the fictional ""Federation of Inter State Truckers"", and finds that he must sacrifice his principles as he moves up through the union and attempts to expand its influence. The movie is loosely based on the Teamsters union and their former President Jimmy Hoffa.

A number of other well known actors and actresses appeared in F.I.S.T. They included Kevin Conway, Brian Dennehy, Rod Steiger, Melinda Dillon, Richard Herd, Peter Boyle and Red Hot Chili Peppers lead singer Anthony Kiedis.
