The group consists of four of its generations most hard working musicians in Sweden and has created its own, unique space in European jazz, with a personal and contemporary sound, outside of the main stream. A great sensibility for the inner being of jazz is always present in their music, which is based in thorough compositional work and an almost intuitive interplay. Melodic, hard swinging, contemporary jazz with one foot in the tradition, the other in our time and with the aim steadily fixed into the future!

Hans Olding is one of Swedens most active and acclaimed jazz guitarists. He has been heard on stages around Europe and the rest of the world during the last ten years. Well known musicians he has played with includes, Daniel Humair (FRA), Francesco Bearzatti (ITA), Mikko Innanen (FIN), Karl-Martin Almqvist (SWE) and others. He has also received numerous grants for performance and composition.

Linus Lindblom, saxophone, is one of the clearest sounding voices on the Swedish jazz scene today and was recently awarded the Swedish National Radios jazz price as Newcomer of the year. Hes a highly personal musician with a lyrical and energetic sound.

PÃ¤r-Ola Landin, bass, can be heard on several recordings and on scenes around Sweden in different well-established bands. Hes one of the most in demand bass players of his generation in Sweden and has a long list of merits. Hes a thoroughly musical bassist with a rare drive and lots of experience from touring all over the world.

Chris Montgomery, drums, is probably the strongest and most exciting drummer emerging from the Swedish west coast. He is one of his generations biggest talents, playing regularly with top creative Swedish jazz groups all over Europe. Singers, Rigmor Gustafsson and Jeanette LindstrÃ¶m, as well as the BohuslÃ¤n Big Band are some of his recent employers.

Gruppen utÃ¶kas med vibrafonisten Mattias StÃ¥hl i tvÃ¥ melodier. Klarinettisten Fredrik Ljungkvist medverkar i en melodi. All musik Ã¤r skriven av Olding. Det Ã¤r en modern jazz som presenteras dÃ¤r kompositionerna knappast intar nÃ¥gra publikflirtande vinklingar. Men jag vill definitivt inte kalla musiken svÃ¥rtillgÃ¤nglig. HÃ¤r handlar det mer om tillit till den egna identiteten utan spekulativa tillsatser. Gruppens vidare Ã¶den Ã¤r svÃ¥rt att fÃ¶rutspÃ¥. Den seriÃ¶sa instÃ¤llningen och musikernas  personliga spel borgar fÃ¶r kommande lagrar.

Oldings gitarr och Linus skÃ¶na ton ger gruppen en tilltalande vÃ¤lljudande klang vilket ocksÃ¥ kunde konstateras pÃ¥ den tidigare skivan No Space. BÃ¥da har ett uttryckssÃ¤tt som frapperar och lockar. Gruppens bakre delar, Per-Ola och Chris, Ã¤r alert inspirerande och skapar en bra groove nÃ¤r tempot stiger. Mattias vibrafon Ã¤r en tillgÃ¥ng och bidrar till att fÃ¤rga klangen i de nummer han deltar i. Fredrik Ljungkvist klarinett hade jag gÃ¤rna sett lite ymnigare. Han Ã¤r verkligen en speleman, en positiv sÃ¥dan, som sprudlar av leklust peppat med fantasirika inpass. (GÃ¶ran Olson digjazz.se)
