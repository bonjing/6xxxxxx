Description

Since he was a child, the author has loved "The wind in the willows", but he has always been worried by the way that Toad altered at the end of the story. "Toad altered! I didn't believe it then and I don't now and I doubt if the many millions of people who have enjoyed Grahame's book believe it either. To me he always seemed incorrigibly unaltered and what I wanted to know was what happened to him next?"
