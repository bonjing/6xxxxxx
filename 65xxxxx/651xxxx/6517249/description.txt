This is the game audio from my play-through of the LA Noire case "Manifest Destiny".

I have no idea why anyone would want this, but I figured what the hell, I'll put it up anyway.

This is recorded on my laptop in 192 kbps AAC using an optic cable running from the digital audio out on my TV to the line-in on my laptop. It is strictly game audio. Don't worry, you won't hear any stupid commentary or anything. Just straight-up in-game sound.

I start the recording immediately after the briefing at the start of the case, so the first part you hear is me on my way out of the police station. The recording comes in at a little over an hour.

Happy trails. And BTW, if anyone does actually download this and use it for some purpose, please leave a comment and let me know what you used this for. I'm really quite curious.
