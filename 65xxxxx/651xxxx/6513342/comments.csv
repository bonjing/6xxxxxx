,Camel_Filters,2011-07-08T18:48Z,"cracks are on each iso file.

And yes, I did not use compressed files, would have taken ages and 100gb space to unpack, silly imo! :)

Enjoy"
,Malikory,2011-07-11T04:03Z,It won't let me install the expansions without updating sims 3 but it won't let me update sims 3 either...any help?
,atwater,2011-07-11T20:36Z,it saids the same thing when i was just trying to install too
,lissa_monster,2011-07-11T21:06Z,"Everything installed fine. I haven't tried playing the game yet. I am having trouble with your instructions. (This is my first time with this stuff) You say ""Mount 08 The Sims 3 Generations and copy over crack to harddrive.
Move Mods/Packages to ""My Dokuments\Electronic Art\The Sims3\""

Copy what over what crack? and I don't have such a folder. "
,atwater,2011-07-11T21:14Z,"you copy the crack the in  
 Electronic Arts\the sims 3\game\bin"
,atwater,2011-07-11T21:17Z,you dont copy the folder all together but just whats inside the folder
,lissa_monster,2011-07-11T21:21Z,"I meant that I don't have an electronic arts folder in my documents. Do I create one, or should it be there?"
,lissa_monster,2011-07-11T21:34Z,"I don't mean to be a pain either, but what is the name of the crack in the bin folder (I don't know what I am supposed to be copying) and where am I copying it to?"
,Malikory,2011-07-11T22:02Z,"@lissa - The Crack is in the iso itself.  Just mount Generations like you are going to install it, go to 'My Computer' and right click the Generations icon and click Explore, Find the folder that says Crack and then copy the file in that over to your Electronic Arts\Sims 3\Game\Bin folder.


Now does anyone know what to do with the being able to not install the other games?  Or do you have to go in exact order with the numbers for it to work."
,lissa_monster,2011-07-11T22:44Z,"@ Malikory THANK YOU! Everything works perfect now. I apologize that I am a newbie to this. And yes, I installed each in order and it worked fine."
,Malikory,2011-07-11T23:58Z,"@lissa - no problem everyone here has been in your shoes at one point in time.

And if I have to go in order that is going to upset me a little because I didn't want to install all of them just certain EPs but if I must then I will."

,CryxWolf,2011-07-14T07:36Z,"I downloaded the latest 1.22 patch but the crack doesn't launch after the update.  Works fine with just the fresh install.  Was wondering if this was completely unpatchable? Or if there was a way to get it to work with 1.22.

,Dazziko,2011-07-15T20:10Z,Great torrent works perfectly
,Malikory,2011-07-17T17:11Z,"Yeah still getting the same message saying I can't install the EPs without updating sims 3, and I can't update it, so I'm just uninstalling unless someone knows how to fix it."
,Dazziko,2011-07-17T20:52Z,"@Malikory you have to update the game with the EP expansion packs for it to work. Then when you install generations, you use the generations crack and you should be fine!"
,Malikory,2011-07-18T02:50Z,"I know that is what you are suppose to do, but the update keeps failing.  That is where my problem lies."
,Camel_Filters,2011-07-18T06:32Z,"Install game from iso 01 to 08, when your done with installing 08, copy crack from cd to disk and play :)

,amayafaery,2011-07-26T07:05Z,"ok so do i just have to use the crack from the generations or do i have to do it for each? still downloading, but will seed as soon as i get it done!"
,Sims3LOve,2011-07-26T07:55Z,"Ty for torrent works Perfectly takes up space but worth it !!
Anyone that's having trouble ..

You do not have to have all the Expansions Just the Original & Generations (These are necessaries to play) Mount Images and set up will come up. All Expansions in between are optional. Ok Install the ones you want but make sure keep order 1-8 Aka don't do 8 then do 2 etc, Once you have done installing 
Open the Generations theres a folder called Crack Copy the bottom 2 (Dont copy the Keygen but everything else) Extract/Move To '' My Computer/ C:/Program Files/Electronic Arts/Sims 3/Game/Bin '' Paste it and Replace Original,, 

Move the Mod/Packages to Electronic arts/Game
And Paste (Its the Same Path as the Crack but you only stop at Sims 3.

And when I was downloading this I had been downloading for 2 days then I restart the torrent it took 11h

Take a risk 
But I cant be responsible if it fails"

,SHNS0,2011-07-28T16:19Z,"Hey, I have a little concern. This is my only pirated game (i prefer to buy, but the price for all this stuff is insane and I boycott Maxis), will I have compatibility problems with my other original EA games and/or Origin? Also, would it be safe (aka=will they spot me if I do it) to shortcut the exe's in Steam?"
,amayafaery,2011-07-29T21:03Z,for anyone who have installed this correctly...do i have to extract all the iso files or just generations? and do i mount all of the expansion packs or just generations? if anyone who has this working right with all the expansions could you give a better walk through because the instructions are a bit meager and not very helpful...thanks!

rld-s3genk.exe is  a keygen and should not be in this folder. as the keygen is in the archive root.
Install all games from 1 to 8 IN ORDER.

Use Correct Keygens and serial.txt files

Use the Launcher (will get an error which is Crack Normal) or Run
C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin\TS3.exe to skip launcher.


Mods\packages\NRass files this cause a dialog error to popup in the background leaving you with a black screen (apparent freeze) alt tab to dismiss error.
I deleted these 3rd party mod files.

Mods\packages\NoMosaicWA.package causes graphical glitches, missing icons in bubbles, bubbles wrong size. I deleted this 3rd party mod. (Mod removes the blurry private areas in shower, etc)

nointro.package and Both M4Rk13 seem ok.

Store Updates seem ok, when creating a sim, icons show which expansion provides the items, folder icons represent items the store updates provide.

Downloaded Content when installed, becomes uninstalled when you quit the launcher or run the game.
I removed all mods and custom content except a single Downloaded file and it still did not work. I can only assume the crack breaks Downloaded Content completely.

Hope this detail helps out.
