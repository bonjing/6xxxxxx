Pretty Little Liars  S02E04

Blind Dates

After getting Lucas a date with his new dream girl, Hanna feels the need to help him out when Lucas starts to unravel as the date swiftly approaches. But when Caleb is thrown into the mix and Hanna's idea of what is helpful starts to backfire, Lucas' date takes a downward turn. With her mother blaring to the world about her scholarship commitment, Emily is at the edge of spilling the truth behind the fake letter. But with some help from a surprisingly supportive Samara, maybe the situation isn't as dire as Emily once thought. Spencer, on the other hand, is certain that the situation with Melissa and her mysterious communication with Ian is only getting more serious, and Spencer feels that Wren may be the only one who can finally help give her the answers she is looking for. But is Spencer, and the other Liars, ready for what they might find at the end of the search? Meanwhile, Aria has a chance encounter with Jason that brings back some surprising memories.
