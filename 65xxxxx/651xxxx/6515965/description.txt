 A quick-tempered, flamboyantly-dressed,     
 retired hit-man returns to India for one    
 last job. Just don\\\'t call him \\\"Buddah\\\"      
                                             
 BBUDDAH HOGA TERRA BAAP has the 69-year-    
 old Bachchan enacting the role of a defiant,
 flamboyant hitman in his inimitable style.  
 With BBUDDAH HOGA TERRA BAAP, the angry     
 young man of the 1970s and 1980s re-surfaces
 to re-live various roles that he enacted in 
 those memorable films. This one\\\'s a masala  
 film all the way. Right from a medley of    
 Bachchan hits to the expertly crafted action
 sequences to the by-now-famous Bachchan     
 baritone, this one has it all.
