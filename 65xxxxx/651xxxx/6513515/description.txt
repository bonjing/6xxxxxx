NG Salvage Code Red Coastal Crisis
Salvage Code Red follows the real-life heroes from some of the world's biggest salvage companies as they race against time to rescue stricken ships, crews, and cargo. National Geographic cameras follow some of the most experienced salvors in the business, who must draw upon their own unique knowledge and experience, as well as rely on the strength and tenacity of the younger generation to tackle some of the most dangerous and out-of-the-ordinary missions ever seen. 
In this episode The typhoon threat passes Taiwan and attempts to refloat the Colombo Queen tanker resume. Meanwhile salvors must battle a storm to reach a barge and ground it before it wipes out a pier in the US.
