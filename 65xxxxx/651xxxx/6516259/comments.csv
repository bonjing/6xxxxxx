I have been searching for subtitles to this longer version with no luck.  Can someone please post a link to the correct subtitles that cover the extra scenes in this version.

For instance The stick to head funny scene - 1hr 13mins, then again at the funny sex scene - 1hr 21 mins. I just have to know what's being said about his dick and when he won't fall after having his head smashed again and again : )

This version has at least 15 more minutes than early pre dvd releases but on the extended scenes there are no subtitles?

I've searched and tried multiple downloads as well as many subtitle sites and none provide the dialog in english.

This movie is awesome and the quality is unmatched when compared to other posts.
A/10 V/10"
