There is no HD version of Viva Zapata!  This is just an upscale, followed by a badly done encode.  Instead of downloading over 9GB you could get exactly the same quality (or maybe a little better because no middleman doing an encode) by watching the retail DVD9 or iso.

,rippervanwinkle,2011-07-08T01:30Z,"Yes I can read the tag.  Some HDTV are genuine HD streams, some are only DVD streams upscaled.  And whatever the stream there is no reason to have 33% of the picture black bars; this is a very elementary mistake.  "

The seeding looks bad."
