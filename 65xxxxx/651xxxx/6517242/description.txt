A. A. Mohamad, "Lattice Boltzmann Method: Fundamentals and Engineering Applications with Computer Codes" 
 Sp,..er | 2011 | ISBN: 0857294547 | 296 pages | PDF | 1,9 MB 

 Lattice Boltzmann Method introduces the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for solving transport phenomena â€“ flow, heat and mass transfer â€“ in a systematic way. Providing explanatory computer codes throughout the book, the author guides readers through many practical examples, such as:
 flow in isothermal and non-isothermal lid driven cavities;
 flow over obstacles;
 forced flow through a heated channel;
 conjugate forced convection; and
 natural convection.

 Diffusion and advection-diffusion equations are discussed with applications and examples, and complete computer codes accompany the coverage of single and multi-relaxation-time methods. Although the codes are written in FORTRAN, they can be easily translated to other languages, such as C++. The codes can also be extended with little effort to multi-phase and multi-physics, if the reader knows the physics of the problem.

 Readers with some experience of advanced mathematics and physics will find Lattice Boltzmann Method a useful and easy-to-follow text. It has been written for those who are interested in learning and applying the LBM to engineering and industrial problems and it can also serve as a textbook for advanced undergraduate or graduate students who are studying computational transport phenomena.
