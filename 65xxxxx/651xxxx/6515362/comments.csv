,promaty,2011-08-08T15:45Z,"For dll issues try searching them on google. This is not a game problem, it is a windows problem.

For me it happens from time to time for random games with random missing dll's.

For RockalDLL.dll try this one:

dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?rockalldll



To add widescreen to your shortcut right click on the shortcut on the desktop and rewrite your shortcut's target.

For example my target is :
""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Age of Mythology\aomx.exe""

Need to be :

""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Age of Mythology\aomx.exe"" xres=1680 yres=1050


Cheers!"
