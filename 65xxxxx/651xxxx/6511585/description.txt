Description

"The Book of Silence", William Horwood's second trilogy about the moles of Duncton, reaches its climax. Under Quail's cruel leadership, the Newborns have taken control of many key systems of Moledom, including Duncton Wood, but the followers of the Stone have not given up. Meanwhile, Privet, scholar and scribemole, has vanished on her quest for the lost Book of Silence and no one knows whether she will ever be able to return it to its rightful place. 

Well thats the end of the Duncton series. I do hope you all enjoyed it.
