,rocky4500,2011-07-05T17:20Z,Are you running xp or vista/7?...Also what is your directx version? because this requires directx 9.0c...Try updating your graphic card driver and directx version to the latest..

,rocky4500,2011-07-16T00:58Z,"for the audio,,it has some bugs in MP ONLY..So you need to download and apply the latest patch by patch switcher...Google for it"

,JoshoFosho,2011-07-18T14:17Z,Bots dont work..
,rocky4500,2011-07-23T22:27Z,"I tried bots in the game but they are not very good and skilled..You should add the file zzz_bots.iw into the folder named ""main"" in the game folder."
,Randyspears667,2011-07-25T02:12Z,"this problem has been 2006 DAMN it . Shet !   DirectX unrecoverable error
im fully updated with directx "
,Randyspears667,2011-07-25T02:23Z, DirectX unrecoverable error this is 1 of my problems since 2006 .  i had a directx 9.0c 
,Randyspears667,2011-07-25T02:24Z,any cure to this problem rocky? 
,rocky4500,2011-07-31T12:45Z,I think you should update your graphic card driver to the latest version..And also is your graphic car meet the minimum requirements for the game? If your graphic card does not support directx 9.0c you won't be able to play this game..

,Arph,2011-08-07T21:43Z,"Hey there. Well I am having some glitches, unfortunately..

""tintin821 at 2011-07-15 08:54 CET:

rocky4500 at 2011-07-16 00:58 CET:
for the audio,,it has some bugs in MP ONLY..So you need to download and apply the latest patch by patch switcher...Google for it""

Now, that works. But the fact is the glitch for the sound is in single player, too. Gun sounds, nature, etc. All work. But there is no voice coming from the NPCs. What can I do to fix this?"
,Arph,2011-08-07T21:50Z,"Hey. I am having some glitches involving the NPC sounds in single player. Guns, nature, etc. All work. but when the NPC's are talking there is no sound.

I downloaded this torrent at a rate of 800kps-1mbps. Got about 200-250 seeds, and 25 leeches.

Great download, thanks."

There should've been two singleplayer executables.

CoD2SP_s, and CoD2SP_s(2). The first one asks you for a CD. Click the CoD2SP_s(2) one."
