The Mercenary aka The Lazarus Papers (2010)

Lonny Smith, a young man with a suitcase full of money who might drop dead at any moment searching for love with each dying breath even if he has to pay for it, an ex-assassin slave runner who operates a mail order bride scam exploiting prostitutes infected by HIV, a mysterious club owner named Kyo who manages a cabaret show and a vixen named Nana, the girl who will bring it all crashing down will carve their way through the macabre alleys of a magical land buried in South East Asia; in a city named Pali, the city of gold. In two days their lives will twist and turn, slicing a bloody trail leading them to a cryptic divine plan to create a new Lotus, an individual that can heal anything he/she touches, only, the current Lotus is suicidal, and has promised never to heal again.

This two day adventure bereft with unfortunate players in a do-or-die land will entwine together in the most abstract of ways to create a unique ethnically diverse surreal love action crime drama that questions the importance of life and love at the barrel of a pink handled gun; through their eyes, we will uncover a miracle in the most unlikely of places.
