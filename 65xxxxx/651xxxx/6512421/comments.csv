,Jayd32,2011-07-16T01:13Z,Heey Man episode's 54 - 62 r audio any idea how to make them into a video file ?
,thelittlevoices,2011-07-17T10:01Z,"@enzup  .....thers only 89 episodes in english so far.  one is released each week.  so no, i cant upload at least to episode 100....

@jayd32  sounds like you have a bad video program.  use VLC or Gom player."
,furquan1993,2011-07-19T06:10Z,hey dude when are u going to add other episode after these
,mylytzza,2011-07-21T17:00Z,too bad it takes too long to download one episode :( but tnx anyway :)
,talkitivewizard,2011-08-05T03:14Z,"This isn't the best quality out there... It claims to be English Dub HD when in fact the majority of the episodes are actually encoded at 640 x 360. In addition to that, there are several episodes that aren't english dubbed at all. they are: 38-41,46,52,55,59-61,66,71,73,75-76

In addition, alot of the earlier episodes (30ish-50ish) have annoying yellow english subtitles for the some of the english dubbed episodes. Also the later episodes that are englished dubbed have issues playing in alot of different players. The most common side effects were not being able to use the slider or sound and video where not in sync.

Lastly,episode 77 is missing completely and there are two copies of episode 63.

Might need to find another torrent to complement this one.

,thelittlevoices,2011-08-05T15:05Z,"perhaps you should try using another player, since clearly your current player (and your eyes for that matter, two episode 77s? try not opening the same file twice) are fucked up."
,thelittlevoices,2011-08-05T15:06Z,"you can swap between english and japanese, and turn subtitles off an on on most players.  so whatever youre using, youre doing it wrong.  clearly you have no idea what youre talking about, if you cant even figure that much out."
,talkitivewizard,2011-08-05T17:29Z,"Please note the following mistakes you made when you told me that my eyes are fucked up.

I did most of my testing in Totem FYI.

No episode 77 and two copies of 63 is actually what I said.

Please review your posts before you go bashing someone else's post.

Additionally, you are clearly getting very offended over this (as am I at this point).

Also, because I use something different from you to default view my videos in, does not necessarily mean I do not know what I was talking about. It just means in the particular default OS players I used, I received those results. But I will give you credit, I didn't take your suggested player into account.

I did take your suggestion from the 2nd post you wrote in response to mine and used a different player (VLC) for some of the ones I claimed to be Japanese, and you are correct, and I'm sorry for the injustice i obviously did you.

But next time before personally go and insult someone, think about it. If you treat people nicely in the world you might actually get something accomplished."
,Xenn99,2011-08-17T22:02Z,"thnx for the uploading, helping seed..

Please note though there are NO!! HD episodes in this pack!!

Just about everyone of em is 4:3

Some episodes are not dubbed, as mentioned above.

The upload is nice but please next time post decent info since i was especially looking for 720p (which is hd 16:9)"
,K_2_Bandit,2011-08-19T20:34Z,Thank you soo much great collection and great quality : )
,thelittlevoices,2011-08-30T04:58Z,"@talkativewizard
there is an episode 77, please look thuroughly through the files before randomly assuming things.  its in the double episide, 76-77.

apparently there is two episode 63s, i suppose i uploaded this before i chose the best of the 2.  regardless, its better than there being no episode 63 at all.  if you dont want to download both, choose the one with the larger size.

finally, i dont have to treat people nicely on the internet.  iv already accomplished what the intended goal was for this torrent.  


@xenn99  when i said HD, i meant high quality.  youre going to be incredibly hard pressed to find naruto shippuden english dubbed in 720p+ anywhere.  if thats what youre after, i suggest you buy DVDs, if it even comes out in that quality on DVD.

also, ""Some episodes are not dubbed, as mentioned above."" is clearly wrong.  again, if youre downloading my torrent, and not using the player i suggest to view it, any problems you have are YOUR OWN FAULT.  NOT mine, and NOT the torrents.

the description does have decent info.  its your own fault for not fully understanding it. ""Mostly 720p (i think) But even if theyre not, these episodes are pretty much the best quality youll find, anywhere. Aside from buying blu ray"""
,dhtpex,2011-10-19T15:26Z,where can i get fidelbd's files for ep 33 - ep53 just like the first 32 eps. They are awesome.
,iulixmax,2011-10-27T19:11Z,good job
,iulixmax,2011-10-27T19:13Z,naruto shippuden
,Art9191,2011-10-28T13:47Z,"what about the other episodes,another torrent may be? "

,gellis2010,2012-03-09T22:07Z,"little voices.. your a bit of a dick are you not?
Why are you getting so defensive and frustrated?"
,bbjk7,2012-05-07T15:44Z,"leave the poor guy alone... he went to all this effort to bring you this torrent (which so far i don't see too much wrong with) and you treat him like s**t. if you know of better torrents out there, back it up by posting links instead of just insulting this one."
