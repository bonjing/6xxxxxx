Excellence in Concrete Construction through Innovation by Mukesh C Limbachiya and Hsein Y. Kew

Product Description
The concrete industry has embraced innovation and ensured high levels of long-term performance and sustainability through creative applications in design and construction. As a construction material, the versatility of concrete and its intrinsic benefits mean it is still well placed to meet challenges of the construction industry. Indeed, concrete has kept evolving to satisfy ever more stringent, as well as demanding design requirements and calls to improve the performance. This has been achieved through the introduction of new constituent materials, technologies and construction methods.
The current challenges faced by concrete construction may not necessarily be the same as those in the future. However, an ongoing programme of innovation and product development means that concrete should continue to provide cost effective sustainable solutions that are able to turn a challenge into an opportunity.
