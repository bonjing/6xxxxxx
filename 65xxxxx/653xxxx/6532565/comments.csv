,autobot29,2011-07-28T21:43Z,"can someone help me understand what CAM, TS, or any other abbreviations I may need to know means? "
,Canuck13,2011-07-29T02:31Z,"@autobot29

CAM is a camrecorder taping of the movie in the theatre.

I think TS is a feed pulled of off the movie reel, but Im not sure. 

Generally TS > CAM

And DVDrip is always better then either of these."

,blusniffer,2011-08-03T07:45Z,thanks alot on this early attempt m8!
,amitron45,2011-08-07T17:23Z,"Better yet convert the file using Bittorrent. Then use freemake video converter to convert the file into an MP4 format. Upload the file to your Flash Drive, stick the drive in your PS3, upload the file to your PS3. There u go, a movie that u don't have to put on DVD, unless u want to and that u r able to look at without being blocked by anything."
,braduz,2011-08-08T18:01Z,"Actually.. 

TS is telesync.

Tc in ripped from the reels. 

And ye cam is filmed with a cam."
