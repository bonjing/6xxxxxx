 Multivariate statistical methods are described in this study and advice is given on how best to apply these methods using CANOCO software. Data sets and program files for the case studies are provided on a supporting website. The book is useful to anyone studying complex ecological problems, such as the variation of biotic communities with environmental conditions or their response to experimental manipulations. It is primarily targeted at ecologists who need to analyze data resulting from field observations and experiments.
