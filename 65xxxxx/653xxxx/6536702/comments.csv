,sjc9999,2011-07-15T21:41Z,"Update: Can't get this on my seedbox, but can downloaded on PC using uTorrent (it sees seeds via DHT but gives a 404 for HTTP and 'invalid URL' for all three udp trackers)."

what does that mean?  can you tell me if it's something I may have done wrong?"
,RedLady1,2011-07-16T05:25Z,"update:  The torrent was created with uTorrent and uTorrent doesn't support udp trackers... I didn't know that, sorry."
,sjc9999,2011-07-16T13:39Z,"My uTorrent is older (1.8.2) because some sites I use prefer that. It downloads fine, but the torrents all stay red rather than turning blue. But I found a thread here http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=93861 so it may not be specific to this torrent."
,sjc9999,2011-07-16T14:25Z,"Update: Finally got it going on my seedbox. Just in case this helps others:

1) Uploaded torrent to http://torrenteditor.com

IT shows errors for all current trackers

2) Added: http://tracker.ilibr.org:6969/announce (found inb another torrent)

it shows 1 seed. Uploaded new torrent file to seedbox.

3) Turned on peer exchange 

now seeing 15 peers and 3 seeds.

THanks for the upload and help."
