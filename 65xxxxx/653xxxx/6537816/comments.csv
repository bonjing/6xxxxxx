I wonder if there's English audio on this one..."
,richardpa,2011-07-13T15:58Z,NO SEEDERS..............:(
,QborT,2011-07-13T17:39Z,"This version IS English.

But unfortunately scenebalance doesn't bother to seed many of their uploads, so you might never complete."
,richardpa,2011-07-13T19:24Z,"Proper DVDRip and a steady download...
A/10
V/10
Eventually got it downloaded and the audio is in English, will seed the tits of this...
Many Thanx to scenebalance and SceneLovers for the Great rip and Thanx to the 27 guys that are seeding...:)"
