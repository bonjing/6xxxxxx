A combination of â€˜Mystery Case Filesâ€™, â€˜Clueâ€™, and â€˜Guess Whoâ€™. â€œSomething Wickedâ€ is one complete storyline in a series of mystery/hidden object games called â€œGhastly Glen Mysteriesâ€. All of the stories take place in the little town of Ghastly Glen, where you travel around to different characterâ€™s houses and explore their rooms for clues. In â€˜Something Wickedâ€™ you are helping Gryffin Canis figure out who in Ghastly Glen might have it in for him. Gryffin feels as though heâ€™s being watched and is constantly hearing strange growls coming from all around. Heâ€™s also been having blackouts and memory loss, and when he awakes he finds strange wounds on himself, as though some creature had been biting and clawing at him. Help Gryffin figure out whatâ€™s going on; uncover clues, discover motives, and eliminate suspects in this all new Ghastly Glen Mystery.
