A serial killer is terrorizing a small town. Mark Bishop (Brad Jones) has just killed an intruder who attacked him in his home. Only he's not sure if he killed the real serial killer, but knows he doesn't want the attention. Mark has to get rid of the body and avoid the authorities. But he can't shake the feeling that the real killer is still out there."

,MCMGM,2011-08-22T22:54Z,"Then you go out and make a better film, jackass. Oh yeah, you won't. Because you're some mouth breather who lives in his mother's basement and gets off on insulting people's hard work from behind a computer screen. 

Buzz off. "
