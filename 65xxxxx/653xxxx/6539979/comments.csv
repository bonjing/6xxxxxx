You can also activate Office 2010 very simple and straight forward.
I have tried many of the activations out there but this one works 
best and I have not had any issues with it.

1.Copy and paste w7lxe.exe to Local Disc (C:)
2.Run CMD (Command) then paste this in   C:\w7lxe.exe /office2010
3.Press enter, wait few seconds and then Office 2010 is activated for life!!

I have had on PC with Office activate for just over a year"
