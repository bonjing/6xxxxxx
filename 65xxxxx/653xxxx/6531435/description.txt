Specifically, the following topics are covered: implementing JavaScript unit tests; explaining the intent of Dynamic Languages, Web Services and SOA; defining and implementing contracts using REST; understanding why JavaScript Functions have state; implementing JavaScript "Generics", which are a mixture between real Generics and a replacement algorithm; using code blocks; using functions to make decisions; understanding the difference of JavaScript code that behaves like a value type or a reference type; implementing proxies, delegates, mixins, and overloaded functions; implementing a complete Ajax and Web Service architecture; defining a Web Service using REST; handling large or slow or real-time data sets; implementing shopping cart type architectures; and solving the back button problem using Ajax.
