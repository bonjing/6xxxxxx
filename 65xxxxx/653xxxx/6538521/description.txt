Scheduled Guests
................

From the Infowars web site ::

Alex's in-studio guests for this Wednesday, July 13 edition of the Alex Jones Show will be Cody Hess and Matthew Medina of We Are Change San Antonio. Hess and Medina host Truth Exposed Radio. 

Alex is also joined by Tony Farrell, who served with British South Yorkshire Police for 12 years as a Police Intelligence Analyst. It was Farrell's job to produce annual Strategic Threat Assessment Matrix reports as part of counter-terror operations. When Farrell discovered damning evidence that both 7/7 and 9/11 were false flag attacks, he blew the whistle and told his superiors that "internal tyranny" and "state sponsored terror" were far greater threats than Islamic radicalism. Despite several of his superiors agreeing with him, Farrell was subsequently dismissed and his case is currently on appeal.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
