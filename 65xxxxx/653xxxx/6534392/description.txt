 This volume assesses the role of legal semiotics in legal education. The field of legal semiotics is new and highly relevant to legal practice and to the transference of legal knowledge across generations of lawyers. The material included in this book promotes new semiotic ideas in four specific domains: the philosophical and legal foundations of the newly developed sign-directed expressiveness in law; the historical, political and semiotic dimensions of first efforts to teach Law in Pennsylvania and Virginia; gender issues and family relations in the light of legal qualifications; and economic and business approaches to cases in which trademarks are functioning as signs in law or public use of property is forwarded.
