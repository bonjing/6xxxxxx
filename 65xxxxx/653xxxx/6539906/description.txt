 An ambitious study examining the encounter between Gaels and Europeans in Scotland in the central Middle Ages, offering remarkable insight into an important period of Scots' national identity. Based on close readings of charters, indentures, brieves, and other written sources on the business of royal and baronial courts from 1150 to 1400, this volume structures its history around land, law, and people, exploring interactions among customs, laws, and traditions of native inhabitants and incoming settlers. 

 Drawing on a range of theoretical and methodological approaches, Cynthia J. Neville situates her subject firmly within a recent historiography of the British Isles and demonstrates how the experience of Scotland was both similar to and distinct from a larger process of Europeanization.
