Tour de France 2011 Stage 9.

Ahar me hearties! 'Twas a dramatic stage. Aye a dramatic stage indeed!

This is up until the stage finishes. Sorry - there's no post-race presentation today.

Also: I think I may have made a small encoding mistake somewhere in the middle, possibly causing another program to be shown for a short while. If so, please just skip a tiny little bit and it should be fine...
