For iPhone:

,fjoson,2011-07-16T10:59Z,"@theone10 that method only worked on beta 1. Beta 2 fixed this issue and it remained fixed in beta 3. This is what I did:
1. Update to 5.0b3
2. Download the latest redsn0w and follow the instructions to jailbreak your device.
3. Download iFunbox (google it :P)
4. Make sure your device is plugged in and turned on and run ifunbox.
5. Your device will be shown in the left pane of ifunbox. Under it, click on ""raw file system"".
6. Click into the folder named System.
7. Click into Library.
8. Click into CoreServices.
9. Drag the file ""Systemversion.plist"" to your computer.
10. Open with notepad.
11. Delete Releasetype
12. Delete Beta
13. Save
14. Drag the file you just saved (systemversion.plist) back into ifunbox. It'll ask you if you want to overwrite the original one. Click yes.
15. Done!
It will still go to the setup screen when you unlock it, but when you get to the activation part it won't give you a message saying that activation failed. 
If you have trouble getting your device to restore to the firmware (like I did), use sn0wbreeze to restore it (tutorials are all over youtube) and then re-jailbreak with redsn0w. "
,fjoson,2011-07-16T11:02Z,"@theone10 also those methods don't truly unlock it. You don't get notification center and some default apps don't work. While my way takes longer, its permanently activated with all features enabled."
,alain.aoun,2011-07-17T00:40Z,"can i do this without jailbreaking?? 
""1. Update to 5.0b3
2. Download the latest redsn0w and follow the instructions to jailbreak your device.
3. Download iFunbox (google it :P)

,fjoson,2011-07-17T23:47Z,"Only way without jailbreaking is to get your UDID activated with Apple. There are people that will do this with a small fee, as opposed to the $99 dollars for an apple developer account. "
,sarangkg,2011-08-03T15:42Z,For best UDID activations for $3 contact Vinz Felix . I did several activations thru him..he is most reliable and honest guy i found...Vinz u rock..
