You haven't patched it with the crack. 
Copy the "".exe"" file from the crack folder over the top of the original one located in: 
C:\Program files\Telltale Games\Back to the Future The Game\Episode x\
This needs doing for each episode

These are SO good! What a great game series. 
Works fine. 
The only issue i noticed occurred on Windows 7 64-bit systems (two tested) and on them both the frame rate on the in-game movie scenes began skipping/stuttering badly. Both were high-end machines: a quad core and a triple core with 4GB ram each and N-Vidia Geforce graphics cards. 
On Windows 7 32-bit systems i tried they played out smoothly as anything (and these were much lower spec machines than the 64bit ones tested and with budget 3rd-party GeForce cards.) 

Fantastic game series. Thanks again, uploader."
,mar6125,2012-03-26T07:28Z,"I have a problem with the crack. It says :The program cant be started because  QtGui.dll is missing form your computer. Try reinstslling the program to fix the problem

What can i do?"
,turq_hex,2012-04-22T18:32Z,mar6125... you have to copy over that exe file over to the game directory and copy & replace. QtGuii is in there
,_Necross_,2012-06-06T21:29Z,"thanks for the game
