,Cool12309,2011-08-07T06:50Z,What does Seeders and Leechers mean? Oh and can you do a 3.4.6? :D
,echo873,2011-08-10T01:45Z,"Cool12309, seeders are the one with the complete torrent only doing sharing to other people (leechers).

Leechers are the people _not_ with the complete torrent because they are still downloading it (they can still upload what they have to others, though).

You can check out WikiPedia for a complete list (includes terms really nobody uses anymore): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_vocabulary"
,L3GiTPro,2011-08-11T04:18Z,Seeders are nice people who let you download off of them and Leechers are ass holes who download off of everyone else but wont let anyone download off of them.

,jtaker,2011-09-05T09:41Z,"Little problem here, just wondering how to fix it.

When I press the hotkeys, nothing happens. There's no framerate overlay, and nothing is recorded.

Any help?"
