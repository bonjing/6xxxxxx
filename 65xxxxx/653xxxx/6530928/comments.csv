Excellent British chiller.
[10 stars] 15 November 2004 | by HumanoidOfFlesh (Chyby, Poland)

""The Woman in Black"" is easily one of the creepiest British ghost stories ever made. A young solicitor, after arriving in a small town to handle a dead client's estate, is haunted by a mysterious woman dressed all in black. The film is loaded with extremely eerie atmosphere and the frights are calculated for and deliver the maximum effect possible. The action keeps the viewer deeply involved and the finale is quite disturbing. The acting is excellent and the tension is almost unbearable at times. So if you want to see a truly creepy horror film, give this one a look. I dare anyone to watch ""The Woman in Black"" alone at night with the lights off. Highly recommended. 10 out of 10.

,sprongle,2012-03-12T19:09Z,"Makes more sense and is scarier than the 2012 version IMO. Excellent copy. Previous poster is probably a Saw fan. Excellent psychological film with tons of atmosphere, although the locals are much friendlier in this than in the 2012 version. The 1989, 2012 stories and the book version are all different."
