Thank You was called "nearly perfect" by Allmusic's Stephen Erlewine, who wrote that "STP made music that sounded great at the time and even better now" and that the band's music had "stood the test of time." Rolling Stone, who initially named STP as the Worst New Artist of 1993, gave the compilation album 4 out of 5 stars.
