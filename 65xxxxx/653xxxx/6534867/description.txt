Updated Sherlock 'will be back'


The BBC's modern update of Sherlock Holmes will return following the end of its initial three-episode run, its producers have confirmed.

"There will be more," producer Sue Vertue told the BBC's Breakfast programme. "We're having a meeting to talk about how many and when."

Starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes and Martin Freeman as Watson, Sherlock has been a ratings hit for BBC One.

More than seven million people tuned in to see Sunday's dramatic cliffhanger.

Based on stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the 90-minute specials were written by Mark Gatiss, Stephen Thompson and Steven Moffat.

Moffat - lead writer and executive producer on Doctor Who - said there would "definitely" be more instalments in the future.

"Steven and Mark are very busy - Steven is obviously doing Doctor Who as well - so it's just when we're going to do them," said Vertue.

Moffat, her husband, also confirmed that any future instalments would remain 90 minutes long.
