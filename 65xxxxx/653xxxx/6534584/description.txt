Part 3: The Final Battle

Just as she is close to healing Paser and solving the whole mystery, Maiaâ€™s adventure takes a new twist. She now finds herself hurled into a dark paranormal worldâ€¦

At least one thing is now certain: a divine power is directly behind the problems on the building site.
It seems inevitable that Maia will have to confront this supreme being to save the Great Obelisk, the Pharaoh, and even Egypt itself.
This is the last part of a three-part adventure.
