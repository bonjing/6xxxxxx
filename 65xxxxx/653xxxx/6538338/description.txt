CHARLIE PARKER BIRD ON 52ND STREET
Released :1948 (LP); October 21, 1994 (CD release) 
Recorded July 6, 1948 at the Onyx Club, New York Length 40:01
Label: Debut (JWS 501)
Format:Flac

A companion album to Bird at St. Nickâ€™s (OJC-041), this was also taped on location by trombonist Jimmy Knepper. It comes, most likely, from the Three Deuces on New Yorkâ€™s famed â€œSwing Alley,â€ 52nd Street.
The supporting cast of trumpeter Miles Davis, pianist Duke Jordan, bassist Tommy Potter, and drummer Max Roach helped compromise the Charlie quintet but Jordan is heard in solo only briefly and Davis hardly at all. Tape was precious and Knepper saved the lionâ€™s share for Bird. The standards and the originals are all here as only Parker could play them, including â€œA Night in Tunisiaâ€ â€œbreakâ€ and several versions of â€œ52nd Street Theme."
