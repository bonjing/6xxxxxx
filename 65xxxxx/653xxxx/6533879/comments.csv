,bbmarcus,2011-07-12T17:00Z,is this fake or real?
,bbmarcus,2011-07-12T17:02Z,I'm asking because the download speed is ridiculously slow. And it has been alot of fake torrents out there on the top 100 for the past days. Thanks in advance
[V],Masterzilla,2011-07-12T17:47Z,It's real. and VTV is real and VIP for a reason.
,faslify,2011-07-12T19:15Z,"BBmarcus. sort your router/isp/firewalls out this downloaded in about 20 minutes for me lol.
Interesting to see if this is any good. There has been so many fucking superhero series flying about, they would need to do something pretty special to get this past the first series. First one to bet it gets cancelled mid season!!"
,ChrisMT86,2011-07-13T09:13Z,Thanks VTV! A/V = 10!
,xposya,2011-07-13T12:02Z,"Thanks VTV, any idea when more episodes are coming?"
,Mimmipimmie,2011-07-13T14:22Z,Great new series!
[V],Masterzilla,2011-07-13T22:17Z,"@ xposya:
New episodes should be on TPB each tuesday by airing schedule as it's usually the day after airdate. You can find it at tvrage.com

Cheers"

,dogbert1121,2011-07-14T21:41Z,One of my Favorite Uploaders.  I always check history before I even try a download.  Slow to start is common for new torrents since there are sooooo many out there trying to be the first to get the known good torrents.  It can start slow but it runs up fast after the first few complete.
,Tranlator,2011-07-14T22:23Z,This is realy awsome SHOW... When will the next Episode come?
[V],matimike,2011-07-15T21:30Z,a/v 10 thanks
,lowlander333,2011-07-16T05:09Z,vtv rules the roost
,downl22001100,2011-07-25T22:58Z,"Good quality v10 a10
No large egos so only a story line to make it work. Certainly has potential."
,pollenhead,2011-08-01T05:23Z,"i found this show just about watchable ! it's a bit cheesy at times,the dialogue is predictable,but still it's much better than a few other show's of the same genre.plus it was the 1st ep"
,jsallday,2011-08-25T15:22Z,Thanks you for the upload.  Beats waiting for reruns and dealing with commercials.  Better than Tivo!
,Guykenndyballsack,2011-10-08T06:39Z,heads up sifi is tracking this one
