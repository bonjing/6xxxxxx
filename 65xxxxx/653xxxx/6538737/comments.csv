,scottjwkelly,2011-08-30T06:50Z,"key stopped working, should have blocked at firewall....."
,CirusVirus,2011-08-31T13:26Z,"OK people Very Very easy to solve the problem!!
firs in program folder their is vc.exe program
on win7 create block rule for this inbound and outbound
first step done
second step is to change some reg key
open regedit and navigate to
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID\{0BB6C95A-CE6C-425a-84F2-EB211CD1A90A}]
change values for those as you can see
""440D54AA8AF58E3D""=""1A""
""580950B697F5823D87""=""194D31F5CEB1D37DD187""
""481244AA97E58A29""=""1B""
""5E0E54A082F8883F97D844""=""1B""
""5918569797E09F35""=""1A""
and delete all the other keys
start imtoo and see the unregistered is gone!!!!!!!!!!
now if you blocked the vc.exe via fire wall it cant check if the serial is ok so it will not chnage the state of the program back to unregistered
Enjoy:)"
