,H3roChr1s,2011-07-12T15:54Z,"The real beta was 3.96 GB,so this might be the full version,i download it thank you!"
,shzb56,2011-07-12T16:50Z,"fake, it's beta. inside is also archive ""deus ex human revolution.rar"" 3.95GB"
,Cogollito,2011-07-12T16:55Z,No more seeds? Why?
[T],musy2,2011-07-12T17:05Z,"but the most best of them are not yet released in mail site also like ipt etc.....waiting for skidrow,reloaded,razor 1911"
,surgerygames,2011-07-13T03:37Z,"not fake. it's a beta. says so right up there ^ betas are for testers. doesn't necessarily have to be the full game. don't just put ""fake"" because you think it's fake. this one happens to be misleading, and there is already a better one up. i played it. it's buggy and i really hope they fix a few things before the release. remember, kiddies, you probably don't know everything. now, wil i download this? fuck no. and neither should you. get ya some smarts, bitches!!!!!!!!"
,cole90,2011-07-13T16:28Z,"THX !! THIS GAME IS WORKING !!!!!

,Cogollito,2011-07-14T19:13Z,"Why don't you try it before calling it a fake?

Bunch of shitheads"
,Casevil,2011-07-16T14:00Z,"Downloading at the moment, I will let you know if this is real."
,Casevil,2011-07-16T19:52Z,"OK guys, so here is the deal - this is the actual Deus Ex Human Revolution game, but I cannot tell if it is any different than the previous leak beside that this one is twice as big. Clean, no viruses whatsoever."
,Casevil,2011-07-16T20:25Z,"All right, I got my save games from the earlier leak - don't waste your time with this one, it is the same content, but it runs a little bit smoother."
,cole90,2011-07-22T02:42Z,this is not full game
,blixkling,2011-07-24T19:33Z,"its obviously not full game u morons, look at the title, its got BETA written in it... jeez "

,vaikou15,2011-07-28T12:43Z,it would help if we had some fuckin seeders. serious guys. nobody is seeding. seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed !
,geuheo28,2011-07-28T18:05Z,I HAVE NO SOUND !!! WTF ???
,Sintek,2011-07-28T19:56Z,"The reason people are calling it fake is because it's twice the size of the other beta. One would think the uploader did that to make it look like a real or full version, thus all the comments calling it fake. There's no point downloading an 8 gig torrent when it's exactly the same as the 4 gig ones."
,seeloa81,2011-07-29T19:36Z,soooo slooooow
,saequa253,2011-07-30T02:12Z,"wow perhaps you should put away the computer games an pick up a grammer book lol.  ok the torrent is fake, don't blame him for uploading it, why be stupid enough to dowload a torrent with no info and not from a trusted member lmao."
,youcankillcandy,2011-08-08T20:40Z,"hey retarded  morons ho call this torrents fake  this is not a fake torrent ? learn to use goggle dudes 

 its verifyd by skidrowcrack"
,youcankillcandy,2011-08-08T20:44Z,@saequa253   noob he is a trusted memmber dickhead
,keaze,2011-08-17T04:07Z,"The reason why this version is so big is because he put twice the same files.  The first file in this torrent deus ex human revolution.rar contains the rest of the files.   I.E. he extracted the game and forgot to delete the original rar file.  
Which is why this version is exactly twice the size of the other torrent."
,filipzag,2011-08-24T06:40Z,is this a game ???????
,Viktor6665,2011-08-29T14:11Z,"Where can i find a working full version game, where the download speed is not 0,1kb/s??? pls help"
