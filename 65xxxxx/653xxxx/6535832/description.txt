The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born by Blender Magazine
We're taking a look back into the recent history of rock.

"There are people who will tell you that all the best rock songs come from the 1960s and 70s, the Golden Age of Genius-Level Hall of Fame Rock Immortals. These people are called baby-boomers, and theyâ€™re the same people who are bankrupting Social Security and invented the male ponytail.

Blender has never bought the myth that rock & roll declined at middle age; the last 25 years were as good as the 25 before them, unless you somehow think Eminem and U2 arenâ€™t as Genius Level as the Moody Blues and Captain & Tennille. So weâ€™ve constructed an alternative rock history that begins long after Woodstock stopped smelling bad and the Sex Pistols quit with dignity, a list of the 500 greatest songs since 1980. And believe us, it was hard to stop at only 500. Sometimes, the good olâ€™ days were yesterday and today."
