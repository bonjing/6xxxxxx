----------------------About The Audio Format Apple Lossless: ------------------------


Apple Lossless is The Best Possible Audio Quality Playback for Itunes and Ipod. Apple Lossless is Apple's in house version of the universal CD quality compression known as Flac. Your Ipod can play no other audio format that is superior than Apple Lossless. However other than Itunes and Ipod almost no other media player known will play this format, as Flac is already free to use and sounds every bit as good.
