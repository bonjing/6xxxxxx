As you can see in the description of the torrent, in the list of albums, the names are sometimes in all capitals and are sometimes all lower case, there is no consistency. I wasted over 6 gigabytes of download bandwidth due to this lazy uploader not using one format for the names."

I basically copied the albums -exactly- as they were.
If the song names are in all caps, it's because they were like this on the albums.

I precisely like consistency and need to do things properly. I'm not going to provide something I modified to my own subjective rules."
