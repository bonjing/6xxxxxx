â€œA smart, funny and original treat,â€ Michael O'Sullivan, The Washington Post, DreamWorks Animationâ€™s Megamind puts a whole new hilarious twist on the superhero movie.
Super villain Megamind's (Will Ferrell) dreams have come true when he conquers the city's protector Metro Man (Brad Pitt) gaining control of Metro City. But when a new villain (Jonah Hill) is created and chaos runs rampant, the world's biggest "mind" and his comic sidekick Minion (David Cross) might actually save the day. With an all-star cast - including Tina Fey - and amazing animation, Megamind is packed with high-flying action and non-stop laughs.
