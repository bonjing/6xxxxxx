,Xx.Izzy.xX,2011-07-17T08:24Z,"To sako.q8: Well, Most torrents you download gives you options for subs, if they don't, well you dont get subs. lol; but next time you download something look to see if they have sub folders. (2) Seeders & Leachers are: Seeders are those who take the time out and leave the torrent running to seed what they've obtained, it's something to do out of respect for the uploader so  others too may enjoy this torrent at fast download speeds. Leachers: are the everyday Jhon Does out there downloading. Hope this helped some ^^

A/V : 7/6"
