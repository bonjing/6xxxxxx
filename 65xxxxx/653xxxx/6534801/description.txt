 "In this perhaps most important of his pioneering theoretical works, the distinguished author writes with brilliant insight in attempting to break the deadlock in the struggle between the instinctivism of Konrad Lorenz . . . and behaviorist B.F. Skinner. He moves toward a provocative conclusion which involves a critical revision of Freud's theory of a "death instinct" in man. . . . Fromm's studies of Stalin and Himmler, and especially his penetrating psychobiography of Hitler, fascinatingy support his thesis."-Publisher's Weekly

 "Rich and provocative . . . a major book from the pen of a major writer."-the Washington Post Book World

 "Fromm is an original thinker. . . . His analysis of the causes of destructiveness is unique, and he has an enviable skill in the lucid presentation of intricate material."-Atlantic Monthly

 "By far the best book I have ever read on the subject and by far the most absorbing."â€”Ashley Montagu
