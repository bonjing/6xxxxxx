,mr_foofer,2011-07-12T02:54Z,"V:10/A:2  

2 CHANNEL AUDIO!

Asshats at Dimension still can't figure out how to make a HD rip with proper 5.1 audio. The fucktwits should leave it for someone else that knows what they are doing."
,e-Marc,2011-07-12T07:32Z,"Downloading for 12 hours now, 52 % finished. DL-Rate at the moment: Zero. With 5000 seeders?!"
,CrAcKeZ,2011-07-15T20:06Z,"Downloading with 1.5 MB/s quite nice speed - I don't need 5.1 sound as I have 2.1 system, if I needed a 5.1 sound I will look for 5.1 torrent :D

Thanks eztv for the upload!!"

,Rawkstar4life27,2011-07-18T08:56Z,Thank you once again!!  
,Vegasbob,2011-09-01T10:31Z,"Sorry but the audio is shit on this rip. Was barely able to make it thru episode. Sounded like bad over-modulation. May be related to the encoder issues Dimension is having where someone dosent know how to use the encoder settings. Too bad as usualy Dimension rips are pretty good.
