Orbital: Profile

One of techno's most celebrated and accomplished partnerships, the brothers Paul and Phil Hartnoll
trace their beginnings as Orbital back to the late 1980's, when their first single, "Chime" was released
on Oh-Zone/FFRR and broke into the British Top 20 in the spring of 1990. The single was made in their
garage using their father's four-track recorder and mastered directly onto cassette, but became a smash
hit, giving them the momentum for a handful of other singles and their untitled first CD (the "green album")
in 1991.

Their career took off in 1993-1994, with the release of the EPs "Lush" and "Radiccio" and their second
untitled album (the "brown album"), which took the public by storm and made the UK Top 30. They also
continued to hone their famous live act, which featured live projections, live musical arranging and
sequencing on the fly, making their shows entertaining, improvised and truly "live". Their appearance at
the 1994 Glastonbury Festival in the UK became the stuff of legend and cemented their reputation as
one of the best techno groups of the 1990's. Their subsequent albums saw them taking a more varied,
introspective angle to their music, while at the same time captivating audiences worldwide with their
relentlessly energetic live shows. In addition to their own productions, they have done remixes for EMF,
Queen Latifah, Meat Beat Manifesto, Madonna, Kraftwerk and more. More recently, they compiled a
volume for the Back To Mine series, released a retrospective compilation called Work, and put out
The Blue Album, their last album.

In mid-2004, Orbital released one final single, "One Perfect Sunrise", and then seemingly split up for good.
However, after several years of solo production, Paul & Phil reunited in 2009, and a long series of live gigs
has followed, as well as a new double A single, "Don't Stop Me" / "The Gun is Good".








Single Review (c/o Amazon)

Halcyon is one of the towering achievements of the Hartnoll brothers,
and a prime example of how they manage to force emotions out of zeros and ones.
From the blissed-out chords at the beginning through the sampled Opus III vocals,
this is one of the best techno-dance tracks ever recorded.
Halcyon still features in Orbital sets some eight years after its release,
testament to its timelessness.
