Quote:
Muties was a six issue miniseries from Marvel Comics

It focused on six different Mutants, and each story was essentially self contained. The miniseries was supposed to show the day-to-day sufferings of mutants, not just those that managed to find their way to the X-Men and Charles Xavier. It was written chiefly by Karl Bollers with different artists doing different issues.


Introduces a handful of characters you'll prob'ly never hear from again.

Apparently issue 5 was corrupt so I dug around and got a repleacement
