And it is as sensational and striking as its title! â€œDeath magic doomâ€ breaks the chains of genre restrictions and serves the listener an album of monumental, breathtaking (Doom) Metal formed to perfection.

Many listeners might be unaware that on CANDLEMASS` groundbreaking debut album â€œEpicus Doomicus Metallicusâ€ (which gave a name to a whole subgenera) the vocal duties were not covered by Messiah, but by a certain Johan Langquist. Messiah joined Black Sabbath enthusiast Leif Edling and the rest of the crew in time for their second effort, the immortal and epic â€œNightfallâ€. The density of all-time favourites such as â€œDark Are The Veils Of Deathâ€, â€œBewitchedâ€ or â€œThe Well Of Soulsâ€ on the 1987 album was, and still remains, breathtaking. After the release of 1989`s concept album â€œTales Of Creationâ€, Messiah left the band for the first time. The two â€œcomebackâ€ albums â€œDactylis Glomerataâ€ and â€œFrom The 13th Sunâ€ were recorded with different vocalists and saw the band experimenting with new moods and styles. The reunion with Messiah, who rejoined the band in 2002 for a legendary tour and more memorable shows, didn`t last long: shock and dismay hit the scene once again in 2004 as the next split occurred. Marcolin returned for the self-titled, massive â€œCandlemassâ€ album which marked the band`s debut with Nuclear Blast. This opus embraced both a heavy, modern sound and the timeless CANDLEMASS trademarks that has won legions of fans since the bands early days in the mid eighties. After the monk had left for good during the recording sessions for â€œKing Of The Grey Islandsâ€, Robert Lowe (SOLITUDE AETURNUS) picked up the microphone in 2007 and delivered a hauntingly great job on this sombre concept album. The CANDLEMASS fans gave Robert a warm welcome on their following European tour â€“ just listen to the live cuts on the â€œLucifer risingâ€ EP (2008)!

Now the Swedish/Texan fivepiece has returned with an album that deserves the title â€œclassicâ€ right from the start â€“ because â€œDeath Magic Doomâ€ has it all! Uptempo Metal madness (â€™If I ever dieâ€™), grinding Doom (â€™Hammer of Doomâ€™, which the record was initially supposed to be called) and â€“ most of all â€“ those immortal hymns with achingly addictive and beautiful melody lines (just check out â€˜Dead angelâ€™ or â€˜The bleeding baronessâ€™)! Recorded once more at the famous Swedish Polar Studios, â€œDeath Magic Doomâ€ captures CANDLEMASS at their personal best: immortal songwriting, incredible guitar solos and Robert`s brilliant vocals... Colossal, epic, heavy, doomy, you gotta love this one!!!
