Installation:

1. First make a backup of the Vehicles Folder in \"Shift 2 Unleashed\\Pakfiles\\\"
2. Copy the Contents of the Torrent to the in \"Shift 2 Unleashed\\Pakfiles\\\" Folder, Overwriting ALL FILES when asked.

Then ingame you can use the cars in Career, or in Quick Race / Tuning Race.
Only the versions of the car named in the list work:
The Nissan Skyline R34 is modded, but not the Nissan Skyline R35.
So check good what cars are faster and what are not
