Description
Jake Humphrey introduces live coverage from Silverstone as the famous Northamptonshire venue once again gears up for its afternoon in the global spotlight. The 3.6 mile circuit has many familiar landmarks, including Copse, Beckets, Stowe and Abbey corners, as well as the Hangar straight, which will all have to be negotiated 52 times. Last year Australian Mark Webber won his first British Grand Prix. He finished 1.3 seconds clear of local favourite and 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton, while Nico Rosberg held off Jenson Button's challenge to complete the podium. Commentary comes from Martin Brundle and two-time British Grand Prix winner David Coulthard.
