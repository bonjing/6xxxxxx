        Season 4, Episode 16: A Winter's Tale

        Christmas  is  near and  Kate  Rowan has  arranged  that Danny
        Parkin, who is  very ill, gets  home from hospital  during the
        holidays.  A  trip  to a  sanatorium  in  Switzerland will  do
        wonders for him  and to earn  money for the  trip his siblings
        "borrows" Christmas trees from  Lady Whitly's estate in  order
        to  sell them.  The snobby,  but very  attractive Lady  Whitly
        shows  a  lot  of  affection for  PC  Rowan,  who  is sent  to
        investigate, and she is  also involved in the  local Christmas
        charity concert. The  same concert needs  a Santa Claus  and a
        reluctant Greengrass is hired for the job. Not surprisingly he
        tries to make money on  the deal. And speaking of  Greengrass,
        somebody has nicked his lorry!
