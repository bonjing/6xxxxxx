Bookmarked and patiently waiting for parts 6-8."
,VitualWorld,2011-07-12T00:35Z,"Always a pleasure sir,

and part 6 is ready to roll out, but since I don't have the capability to seed 2 torrents at the same time because my upload speed is about 180 kb/s at max, I will be uploading that one in a day or two.
And part 7 and 8 aren't yet released, but once they are, I will upload them also ;)"

,everlasting_griffin,2012-01-23T20:04Z,"Dear Virtual World,
Thank you so much for giving yourself and volunteering your efforts, determination, energy, heart, expertise in uploading the Harry Potter Extras. It means so much to us all...(The Harry Potter generation that is!)... especially with Post potter depression being at the peak. Looking forward to the rest of the Extras. Hope you'll take some time off and upload them. Take care and God Bless."
