Deeper. Bolder. Darker. 
As the eight Harry Potter films trace Harry's journey from innocent schoolboy to selfless hero, the series undergoes a transformation. 
Creating the World of Harry Potter Part 5: Evolution takes you along for every exciting step of the 10-year filmmaking odyssey. 
Join the four directors, key members of the crew and cast, including Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, 
as they explore how the creative vision for the films evolved to maintain the integrity and increasing intensity of J.K. Rowling's expansive literary series. 
From the ever-changing architecture of Hogwarts Castle and expanding landscape of the wizarding world, 
to the darkening color palette of each successive film, to the young actors maturing along with their characters, 
it is a wondrous and spectacular adventure to experience.
