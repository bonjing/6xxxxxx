Doesn't work on Hulu. Works just fine on youtube, but that's kinda useless for me cause I know of quite a few that can download from youtube. Wanted this just for hulu, but I guess I'm shit outta luck."
,ThanksForPlaying,2011-07-15T09:31Z,Doesn't work anymore as there is a new Flash out 
,ThanksForPlaying,2011-07-15T09:52Z,"Ignore my comment, still works. "
,nceylonz,2011-07-16T11:40Z,"For some reason, in this new version for some websites the video link doesn't show. In this case you should try the older version 9.0.2.6

,chle70,2011-09-04T19:51Z,anyone else having problems with GetFLV not connecting when entering the registration info?
,dajester10,2011-09-06T13:10Z,ok so avast picks the keygey up as malware ( Win32:Induc-W) and gets rid of it - so what now? - does it actaully contain malware or what? .... dodgey
,rudolphrn,2011-09-17T23:43Z,"Great torrent, and MS Security Essentials doesn't think there is a virus in the keygen.  Doesn't work with seesaw, but it appears nothing else does either.

Only one complaint.  In the .nfo you recommend that if I like the software I should buy it.  GetFLV violates ffmpeg's gpl licence, so I would recommend in the strongest possible terms that you do not buy this software.  GetFLV corporation are the pirates in this particular case."
,Sysanin,2011-09-28T01:30Z,"1. Run patch, enter email address, apply patch.
2. Disable DEP or add GetFLV.exe to DEP exceptions.
My Computer > Properties > Advanced > Setting Performance > Data Execution Prevention
Then Select Turn On With Except Program And Add GETFLV.exe

,yodasgreencock,2011-10-05T21:03Z,Any chance of a 9.0.5 version being released??
,Blodsvalte,2011-10-06T19:21Z,"Doesn't work :(, neither does the 9026. [Win xp, tested it on to different cps, same thing.] This even makes program to freeze. Maybe an earlier version...I seriously doubt it. No I have to look for somthn else. Sad because it seemed to be promising. twas tv4 sweden I tried it on..."
,Blodsvalte,2011-10-06T21:25Z,"Nope, tried an earlier version... Is this really working for some, I wonder?"
,Blodsvalte,2011-10-06T21:33Z,"Now I'll try to use a commercial one 14days If this works I'm puzzled. The price is to damn high... Perhaps I can use this with the k-genes here...(don't think so though, this seem to be shitty crappy doble fraud thing... ;) No big deal really..."
,Blodsvalte,2011-10-06T23:09Z,"What is this crap? I downloaded the latest trial version, recorded (recorded it did...) and it cannot play it. Not wmp nor vlc. ????????????????????????

There should be a better simpler way...I think..."
,Blodsvalte,2011-10-15T20:25Z,"None of these works (xp). Can someone U.L.  a working GF (now 9053) I found one, with patch and so... downloaded and it was great until it said my account was out of date or something like that... Managed to download about 80%... Funny is this the only program...?"
,KirkBauer,2011-10-27T20:44Z,"Didn't work with SnagFilms either...got the commercial, but not the movie. (Eek!)"
