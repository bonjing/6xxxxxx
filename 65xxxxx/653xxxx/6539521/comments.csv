If you want the URLs that you put in the description field to be clickable (they turn blue), then you must leave out the [img] tags, and include a couple of carriage returns between each URL instead."

,vincenzo_007,2011-09-02T16:39Z,what kind of audio format is it?
,Wave_rider,2011-09-19T17:32Z,"Good quality if you don't want to download a 1080p 77 GB file. Including Elvish-only, English subs in MKV, rather than complete movie English subs, would have been appreciated (Uploader). A/V/subs: 10/10/4.


Elvish subs:

,Wave_rider,2011-09-19T17:48Z,"â€¦also, Subs Girmi is suggesting are already in this MKV container. His recommendation is for entire movie subs, not Non-English parts only subs.

Dl'ers, download mkvtoolix (mkv merge) to add elvish-only (.SRT) subtitles suggested above) to MKV container, and delete or undefault English subs for entire movie. 

Open MKVmerge, ""add"" mkv movie file and corresponding .srt file downloaded from subscene. Click the elvish-only .SRT subtitle file under ""tracks, chapters, and tags"", change ""default"" to ""yes"" on ""default track flag"". Then change ""default"" to ""no"" on existing subtitles in file (if you want to get rid of them all together, merely uncheck them), unless hearing impaired and you need/want the entire movie in English subtitles, ignore this. Good luck"
,Wave_rider,2011-11-01T22:35Z,"***WARNING***

great on computer.

BUT...after trying to use on WDTV, found that this encode does NOT allow trick mode (ff, rw, skip), so if you can't sit through each movie in its entirety, don't download this. I am deleting and will be searching for a properly done encode that enables trick mode. WTF uploader."
,Kamalrk,2012-05-18T07:50Z,"i saw a part of this with my friends, of this torrent and was really good, great quality, i'm now downloading, i'm going to seed but please people, seed!"
,dugalmc,2012-06-07T21:37Z,"C'mon seed, i'm seeding at 1mbs and downloading just at 200kbps :("
