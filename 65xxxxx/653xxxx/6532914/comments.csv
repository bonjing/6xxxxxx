,JustAnIllusi0n,2011-07-11T19:54Z,Downloading now. Anybody know when the Old World Blues DLC is comming out??
,smoketwojoints,2011-07-11T19:58Z,"I got this yesterday from a dump site, I will most definitely seed this though! Thank you. I love this game! :D"
,smoketwojoints,2011-07-11T20:03Z,"Also, if anyone is interested in testing if this will break their mods, you can without multiple installs.

Firstly open the installer exe with 7zip/winRAR and extract the data folder.

Then select 'create from folder' in the package manager in Fallout Mod Manager and make the patch into a FOMOD.

This way you can turn it on and and off without having to reinstall anything if it breaks one of your mods."
,Darkfirebird,2011-07-11T20:13Z,Works great. Figured it might of been a virus like the lot of them but seems nothing was flagged. Been waiting for this patch :) The game is now playable to me! No more randomly holding my rifle over my head while I try to sneak and shoot!
,smoketwojoints,2011-07-11T20:38Z,The little pink skull and crossbones next to rlf-rls' name means it is a trusted member - hence there is no chance whatsoever that they would upload a torrent with a virus - rest assured. :D

,Darkfirebird,2011-07-11T20:50Z,"@smoketwojoints: Yeah I figured. Seen some that had false positives before. But I am really happy I can play this again. I hated that Sneak bug where my weapon always went over me. Was my 1st post and I had this acct for a while XD.

Thanks again for the great upload :D Will seed til... I forget to put my torrents back on XD"
,fellcbr,2011-07-12T02:25Z,you forgot to upload a crack.. i checked on the Skidrow folder and there was no crack friend..
,kaliver,2011-07-12T03:42Z,it's far more likely that your AV automatically deleted the crack as they are prone to do when your AV is shit.
,maskdemasque,2011-07-12T03:43Z,Is it safe to use this crack while on Steam? It seems to have the Steam menu enabled whenever I play it.
,maskdemasque,2011-07-12T03:44Z,@fellcbr You have to highlight all the zip files and extract them to a folder. That should make the extracted crack file have the cracked launchers.
,JustAnIllusi0n,2011-07-12T03:57Z,"@Darkfirebird: Thanks, feeling stupid cuz i didnt got the brains to check that myself...


@fellcbr: Think something must have happend to your torrent then, cuz i had the crack in my skidrow folder."

,Stone_Owl,2011-07-12T04:53Z,6/6 of the previous updates never set off my virus protection.. and now on the 7th does.... ill pass its stable enough with update 6. I've tried a few different sources for this skidrow release and its the same result.

,khfe,2011-07-12T10:53Z,"Assume I have reformated my computer and want to reinstall Fallout New Vegas. 

So, Fallout New Vegas update 5 and Dead Money DLC - Skidrow (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6200435/Fallout_New_Vegas_update_5_and_Dead_Money_DLC_-_Skidrow) is not needed, right?

I start with installing Fallout New Vegas, followed by Fallout New Vegas Honest Hearts DLC (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6404371/Fallout_New_Vegas_Honest_Hearts_DLC-SKIDROW) and lastly Fallout.New.Vegas.Update.7-SKIDROW. Are these steps correct? Thanks for the information."

,Jishkah,2011-07-13T13:43Z,"@khfe: I'm assuming so. Or... at least I hope that's the case.

,londelen,2011-07-13T20:43Z,"I don't understand, I've unpacked all the .rar files and then switched the Fallout new vegas launcher and game files, but it says that Im missing a steam.dll file whenever I try to start it! What am I doing wrong, and what do I need to do with the other files in the .rar?"
,Jishkah,2011-07-13T23:53Z,"londelen: Do you have Steam installed? I remember downloading and installing this release a while back ago, and as soon as I launched Fallout: New Vegas, Steam opened up right along with it. A bit odd... but I guess it's just the way the release was made. I'm guessing this release was based on the Steam release; could be wrong.

Anyway, hope that helps."
,Gamez4You,2011-07-15T04:35Z,"wow really... every one of you guys that can't get this working don't deserve to play. Skidrow makes always crack their games noobfriendly, and only someone retarded couldn't ge this working. But I guess some people are just born slow...

Anyways i'll explain how to make this update work, for the incompetent people.

First, after you downloaded the torrent, open the containing folder. You'll see plenty of winrar folders. Select all of them, and then press extract here. After that you will  see the update. Simply run it. After you did do that, copy/paste the cracked FalloutNV application and the launcher with the old ones and tada it works! Jesus, it isn't that hard is it?

If it says you're missing a .dll file, just search the .dll file name on google and copy/paste it in your NV main folder. That's it.

Anyways, thanks rlf-rls for uploading."
,Rebi312,2011-07-15T20:23Z,"Hello, I need help with this torrent, I followed the instructions as carefully as possible, but when I clicked on the cracked falloutNV and launcher, even after i moved them to the main install folder, it gives an error saying ""The procedure entry point SteamRemoteStorage could not be located in the dynamic link library steam_api.dll, yet I have steam installed and updated."
,cvele93,2011-07-16T20:51Z,"ok i did the extract, installed the update, the skidrow file was empty but i used the crack from my original installation of fallout new vegas which was also a skidrow version it worked with previous skidrow updates but with this one i start the launcher and hit play but all i get is a black screen that closes 4-5 seconds later SO I NEED HELP "
,Jennacide,2011-07-17T23:15Z,"You guys probably should note that even though this doesn't include Honest Hearts, it's meant to be installed after Honest Hearts.

Anyway, still getting instant appcrash when loading the game now, doesn't make it past the first credit screen. And if I use NVSE, it doesn't even get to that first screen. >=|"
,Jennacide,2011-07-17T23:18Z,"Uhh, right after posted that I found something highly unusual that may be the culprit. I went into the launcher options to check if any of my settings went weird, and lo and behold one did. Except it was not one i'd ever suspect. It now gives nVidia 7900 GS as my only video adapter option, a card I have never used in my PC. Hell, isn't the GS a laptop series?"
,Jennacide,2011-07-17T23:29Z,"Just one last update before I give up. Went into the ini's to manually correct the wrong video adaptor, which can be done, but the game will launch directly into the launcher and not the game, and undo your fixes. I'm wagering everyone that this works fine for is on ATI cards."
,TriggerNgo,2011-07-18T17:05Z,"If you're using NVSE and crashing, be sure to grab the latest update off the site. If youre using any mods and having your game crash, be sure to troubleshoot each one. It's known for updates to break mods when formid's are changed. Anyone know when Old World Blues will be up? Just came out today."

have you tried what I posted above?

@ngu 

If you have the purchased steam version, you shouldnt need this at all. Make sure you have automatic updates on."
,ngu,2011-07-19T06:18Z,"Well i do not own the real version of it so i already downloaded fallout new vegas and this update 7 by skidrow cracked from thepiratebay and everthing it works 100 % but what i am worried about is why it requires ""steam_api.dll"" for the game to run correctly

Sorry if this is a dumb question its just that i dont want to lose my steam account

Please Reply"

@Cvele93 So you have no mods enabled, and the latest version of NVSE? Did you remember to copy and paste the contents of the Skidrow into your game directory?"

,dsafjaly69,2011-07-23T21:26Z,"Beware,  if you are upgrading from update 6 it can bone all your save files under 6.  I can load my older saves from under update 5 okay, but lost about 20 hours of game play under update 6.  It's definately the update, I checked all the mods and DLC.  I just get a crash to desktop whenever I attempt to load a save game from update 6. If you have been playing under update 5 only, you are probably okay, but I recommend backing up the game folder before you upgrade."
,sid-afc,2011-07-25T17:39Z,"I installed Old World Blues, and then update 7, and then copied skidrow-crack. Now, the launcher works but the game crashes instantly.

,Zecreus,2011-07-28T18:57Z,"For anyone having trouble with the DLC try this. First reinstall New Vegas (your saves will remain but back them up just in case). Download update 7, Old World Blues, and Honest Hearts. Run update 7, then install Old World Blues. For honest hearts, you must install it to a fake directory (such as the desktop). Take the Honest Hearts esm, esp, and nam files and place them in your New Vegas data folder. NVSE will work properly."

I went through the update installation process twice to verify that this update was the source of the rootkit before I posted. I recommend that anyone who has or will download this update run TDSSKiller.exe to eliminate the rootkit attached to this update.

,Psythik,2011-10-24T00:31Z,Guess the Angel Park mod wasn't compatible with 1.4.  Disabled it and now the game runs beautifully.
,flatlinepb,2011-10-27T08:37Z,DONT DOWNLOAD IF YOU LIKE MODS! THIS RENDERS ALL MODS USELESS!
,IGreyKnightI,2011-11-03T22:44Z,"Hey skid, my friend, you are really confusing us here with all these parts, updates and stuff, here you say i don't need your other updates then i read the readme that says: ATTENTION!!! Install only on Update 6!!! a guy here tells us to install honest hearts then patch 7 with dead money but i see no dead money files in here.Y sure all works when i install it but i just don't know what the hell have i installed and why did i download all the dlc's seperately."
,IGreyKnightI,2011-11-06T15:28Z,bump ;/
,MALicouseWAREhouse,2011-11-07T09:13Z,those this update run all DLCs up to date (OWB LR gun runner's arsenal and courier's stash)?

The fuck? My game won't open after i installed this, I get a box that says application load error 50000065434

To fix this, copy the crack .exe's over from the skidrow directory.  I had issues locating them... Turns out I had to unrar the complete rar file (the one without the ___xx.rar)  I'm not sure exactly I have multiple parts but I'm assuming it has something to do with file size limitations when creating the torrent/rar file.

I had to reinstall 3 times before I finally found the missing crack files.  Backed up everything so I don't have to deal with this crap again =D

Thank you +1"

I had to stop seeding however after getting contacted by these guys:

I'd take a bit of caution if I were you.
Run through a proxy or put some encryption up before you download."
