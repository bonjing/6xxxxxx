I did his fix and works. Apparently IMMERSE is using a bugged muxer that specifies a sampling frequency of 0 in the audio track.

,jctcom,2011-12-15T00:55Z,Please ignore Velcroman and continue with the MKV's.  they are better for surround sound and higher quality picture in the same size file.  Thank you.
