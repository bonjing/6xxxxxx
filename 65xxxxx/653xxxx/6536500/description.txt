Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between MagnetoÃ¢Â€â„¢s Brotherhood and Professor XÃ¢Â€â„¢s X-MEN.
