"I hope that something better comes along ..." - Kermit/Rowlf

Something better indeed. Here is a great extended PAL DVD version of the classic
 Muppet Movie, restoring a number of scenes and shots later cut of the film.

It's rare enough that not a lot of people know about it, but there are indeed
 two edits of The Muppet Movie out there - the familiar version and a longer
 edit which has never been made available on DVD. It turned up on VHS in England
 in the 1980s.

I was especially impressed by the ending of this version, which is I think
 exponentially better than the theatrical ending. We hear the Muppets talking
 over the end credits, as they talk about the movie and their roles in it. It's
 funny and sweet and very Muppety. The audio is the only difference here - a big
 difference.

And then there's the full version of Rowlf and Kermit's song "I Hope That
 Something Better Comes Along," which is excellent.

[Both clips are available at Yootoob from user ocpmovie2.]

We also get more footage of the evil Doc Hopper, and other little moments
 throughout.

The author, who is British so his DVD is in PAL format, has taken an old VHS 
of the extended version, and edited the extra footage into a nice high quality
 DVD version of the film, so that we can all enjoy it. For the most part you're
 watching the theatrical cut in DVD quality, but then for the extended clips we
 cut to lower quality VHS footage. It's certainly noticeable but not jarring,
 especially since the audio is edited smoothly. I did notice that sometimes he
 used the lower quality VHS for shots that were still in the theatrical cut in
 some form, but perhaps the shots were cut shorter in the theatrical cut or
 something.

The VHS he used was apparently pretty much a "full screen" "open matte"
 transfer, rather than pan & scanned, so we don't lose much if any picture when
 it's cropped to widescreen. Certainly when we cut from his VHS footage to DVD
 footage, I don't see much if any difference in the framing of shots. Very nice.


When originally released in theaters in England (and possibly elsewhere), the
 runtime of the film was 97.5 minutes or so. Many small scenes were cut from the
 film to reach the current 94 minute running time. The original longer version
 has become very rare for some reason, but was released in England on PAL
 laserdisc and home video during the 1980s. Most notably the longer version has
 a different (and better) ending, where the Muppets talk to each other during
 the credits, talking about how they did in the movie. This is a very funny
 scene. Also, the full version of "I Hope That Something Better Comes Along"
 is performed by Rowlf and Kermit, with several more verses than in the 94
 minute version.

The longer version, as released on video in England in the 80s, contains the
 following extended scenes:

Extended shots of Kermit entering the bar where Fozzie is performing, after the
 James Coburn cameo.

More of Fozzie being heckled in the bar. He honks a horn which falls apart.
 "This is not my night."

Extra shots as Doc Hopper and Max watch Fozzie and Kermit dance in the bar. A
 little bit more dancing and more of the crowd manhandling Kermit and Fozzie.

An extended commercial for Doc Hopper's Frog Legs. More of Doc Hopper asking
 Kermit to be his spokesman.

Extra Fozzie in "Moving right along." "A bear in his natural habitat - a
 Studebaker."

Even more Doc Hopper trying to convince Kermit. "Shut up, Max!"

In the church, an extended recap of the entire movie by Dr. Teeth - we see shots
 from previous scenes. It's not clear if this was actually in the version which
 screened in theaters, or if it was added for the video version, as the 
laserdisc version seems to have been edited on video. (Because this is a recap,
 the version on this fan DVD still has DVD picture quality - the author was able
 to use footage from earlier, excluding one shot of Doc Hopper.)

Doc Hopper and Max chase Kermit and Fozzie. Max asks what his cut of a million
 is. A whole extra car chase scene of Max trying to catch up to Fozzie and
 Kermit, and failing.

An alternate musical arrangement on Never Before, Never Again. (The UK and
 Canadian releases of the soundtrack LP feature yet another recording of the
 song...)

Great extended version of Rowlf and Kermit dueting on "I Hope That Something
 Better Comes Along," with about two or three more verses. "A laddy needs a
 lassie." "Come father's day, the litterbug's gonna get ya." (For some reason,
 on the fan DVD the lower quality footage covers much of the sequence, even
 though some of it is actually in the theatrical cut, such as "She made a monkey
 out of old king kong" and the final verse.)

Extra shot of Giant Animal laughing at the bad guys (possibly deleted because
 Animal's fingers were thought to look unconvincing - just a guess from me).

LESS reaction shots in Orson Welles scene than the shorter version - strange.

A lot more explosion and set destruction footage when Crazy Harry blows up the
 set at the end, before "Life's like a movie." Seems like padding really. It's
 set to circus-y music.

Extended and alternate ending in the movie theater - Sweetums says "I just knew
 I'd catch up to you guys." All Muppets talk and say funny things over ending
 credits. Robin says Kermit is a great actor. Fozzie wants to hear that he was
 funny in the movie, but no one will tell him that except Kermit. Muppets are in
 character for the entire credits. Music is also different in this section.
 Apart from Sweetums shots, picture quality doesn't change for this addition as
 only sound is changed.
