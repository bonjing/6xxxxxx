        Set during the 1960s in the fictional North Yorkshire  village
        of Aidensfield, this enduring popular series interweaves crime
        and medical  storylines, with  a host  of colourful characters
        that viewers took to their hearts and a wonderfully  nostalgic
        soundtrack.

        Season 4, Episode 7: Trouble in Mind

        A  stranger walks  into the  Aidensfield Arms  and collapses.
        George  Ward  recognizes  him  as  Dennis  Parker,  who   left
        Aidensfield and  his wife  and daughter  seven years  earlier.
        Parker  claims he  has no  recollection of  what has  happened
        since he went away. He only hopes to find his family. But that
        may not be as easy as he thinks, because Parker is wanted  for
        embezzling his  former employer  of 800  on the  day he  went
        missing. Inspired by Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train" Harold
        Jackson approaches Greengrass and wants him to set fire to his
        work shop. In return the Jackson will set fire to  Greengrass'
        barn and they both  can claim the insurance  money. Greengrass
        wants nothing to do with it,  but a few nights later his  barn
        is on fire.
