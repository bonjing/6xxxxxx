minimum 2000 kbps ... 
3089 is more suitable for videos.

your upload size and resolution is good .but peoples afford big size also but increase the bit rate also...

example: this video is just 42 mb, if this video have 120 mb with more quality ,then its more likable."

Thank you for your suggestion.
That will make things a lot easier for me. I wouldn't have to encode videos if thats how you want to see things turn out. 
I'm using all the quality retention techniques that there is available so that it won't eat up a lot of hard disk space and assist in swift download without compromising much on picture and sound quality. I guess there are users who would like to have uploads like this. I check all my torrents on my 22"" monitor and everything appears just fine.
And sorry mate can't find no HD source for your request."
