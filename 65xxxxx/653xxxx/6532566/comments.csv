Maybe it does some online checks. Dunno..."

IT WORKED FOR ME "
,ptbarnum3,2012-04-13T11:10Z,"I installed this on 4/13/2012 2 days ago.After clicking on the link to a Russian website I deleted the shortcut to it that went on my desktop and the link in the program.Everything was perfect.I probable went wrong when I downloaded the dock icon package and themes off Winstep's site and used them because 24 hours later the program said I was 1 day into trail.I didn't update the program though,I'm not that dumb.I reinstalled and now everything is fine again,but I am only letting the modules connect out though my firewall.My fingers are crossed.Has anyone gotten this to work past 30 days?I love this program,it's better then Stardock."
