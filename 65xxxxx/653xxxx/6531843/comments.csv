,tannerman,2011-07-25T14:39Z,"yeah. kaspersky has blocked all of these.
it locks your kaspersky after the 30 days has been applied"
,swexpert,2011-08-02T19:13Z,"The good news is it still works. A bit tedious process though. Patch, activate. Within the 10 min period, Unistall Kaspersky, delete license info also. Reinstall and activate as trial.

Perhaps ""Ganjin"" still left some file unaltered.

BTW i tried on XP 64bit.

Thanks and regards
