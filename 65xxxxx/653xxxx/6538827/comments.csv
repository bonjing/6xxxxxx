,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-07-14T02:30Z,"RealFlow, with sister product the RealFlow RenderKit, is a unique fluids and body dynamics software package which allows you to simulate anything from a single drop of water to a massive tsunami crashing across a beach, sweeping debris in its wake.

RealFlow remains the definitive tool for the creation of flawlessly realistic simulations, and has been used to produce some of the most ground-breaking visual effects ever seen, in movies like â€œAvatarâ€, â€œDistrict 9â€, â€œ2012â€,
â€œGI Joeâ€, and â€œThe Curious Case of Benjamin Buttonâ€, as well as commercials, TV programs, and game cinematics"
,ClassZero,2011-07-14T04:16Z,Try using search stoopid. Uploaded torrents before your lame name showed up on TPB.
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-07-15T00:09Z,"@ClassZero whats your problem man? go troll someone else :(
and what are you talking about search, you mean the search engine on tpb? or is it a site or program I never heard of it before and I am not a pro at torrents so go easy on me! :("
,dogbolter,2011-07-15T11:51Z,"thanks karatychicken, not sure why he is flaming u, but you are ok in my book.... not even sure what he is talking about.... but im gonna try this app i guess, probaably hard as hell to use.... who the hell knows.... peace"
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-07-20T10:41Z,@dogbolter hey no problem if you need some other program just tell me and I don't know what's wrong with this guy either.... he's just one other moron and for using the program if you use it with cinema 4d (like I do) then it should be not that hard you just need to export the object you created in C4d to an .obj file and your good to go (if you adjust your model you have to do it again though) I also have uploaded C4d with all modules and a quick tutorial on how to install so you aren't limited n tools... here it is: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6538779/Cinema_4d_R12_all_modules_MAC_WINDOWS_KARATYCHICKEN have fun again if you need something even if its just a question about the program (and how to use it) I'll be there for U :P
,darkczar,2011-09-02T03:02Z,How do I get the license working?
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-09-02T04:21Z,"@darkczar hey if I'm right you'll get a license screen prompted the first time you start RF up... and you have a txt file containing, what else, your license I thought (its been a while ;] ) you could just copy paste it (between # REALFLOW5 GUI LICENSE DATA STARTS HERE and # LICENSE ENDS HERE)

if not please describe as detailed as possible to me what IS happening... though if this solved your problem please tell me (otherwise I'll have to install it again to help you)"
