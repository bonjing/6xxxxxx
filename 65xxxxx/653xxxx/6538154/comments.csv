,sako.q8,2011-07-16T11:51Z,"Hello Guys I am new here and I have 2 questions and appreciate your herlp with the answers please, i downloaded few movies so far and I am watching it on VLC player whenver i choose subtitles I cant find it can anyone help me how it can be done.

Thanks"

To view subtitles on VLC you first need to download a subtitle file if one is not already included (I use subscene.com).  Then, select Video>Subtitles Track>Open File... 

Seeders are clients who are sharing an entire file; leechers are those currently downloading.  Once you complete a DL you automatically begin seeding unless you move or delete the file.  Hope that helps!"

You are lucky I'm the first to reply to you, any other would be verbally bashing you right now. 

Firstly, In order for the subtitles to work they have to be in the same folder as the video AND they have to have the EXACT same name as the video (minus the extension of course. That's the .avi or .sub) 

Secondly, Seeders are good guys. Seeders are people who are uploading the file that have already downloaded it. The more seeders, the faster you will get the file. Leechers are the opposite. People who are downloading the file and don't have it all. Leechers tend to download the file then delete the torrent. BUT they do upload the parts of the file they have while they are downloading it, so if a file has a lot of leechers you still have a decent chance of getting the file.

And yes, you will be a Leecher as you download this. ;-) "

,Byron187,2011-07-17T09:36Z,"oh okay nevermind my last comment.
i downloaded VLC Media Player and i was able to play the VOB files, you can download VLC at http://www.videolan.org/vlc/
the movie works, the quality isn't perfect but it's free so i shouldn't be complaining lol :)"

Actually, with VLC the subtitle file can be located anywhere and named anything--it doesn't make any difference, aside from convenience."

I don't see what the point was in converting this to DVD. The quality just wasn't there. 
I wasn't impressed in the least...it was watchable but barely. The subs are hard-coded (or my VLC player just wouldn't shut them off). I'll wait for someone to up a decent copy."
