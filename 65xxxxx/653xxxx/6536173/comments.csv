,jp223,2011-07-23T06:33Z,Does some one can explain all the file on that torrent?? 
,vivek585,2011-07-23T19:24Z,It worked for me. Thank you so much!!!
,kokak2010,2011-07-24T02:40Z,"It works in Nuvi 255W, but why a lot of files included when it finished downloaded? Is it 2011 or 2012 update?"
,skeppley,2011-07-24T18:54Z,"Works Great!
Thanks"
,mlipe,2011-07-29T03:13Z,"Had to delete some of files off my 255W to make enough room, but no sweat, I just deleted the voice files for the languages I don't understand.
Works great! Only need to copy the file specified in the instructions."
,handsolo7,2011-08-10T18:58Z,"I backed up all files from my 755T, then I replaced ALL files with the unlocked versions...works perfectly. Thanks to metheguy for the updated maps!

@jp223â€”Basic description of the files:
D3060020A.JCV: Junction View/Lane Assist.
GMAP3D.img: 3D Buildings map.
gmapbmap.img: BaseMap.
gmapprom.img: Main detail mapset.
gmaptz.img: Timezone map.

I wish I knew more about the files to be more descriptive, but I hope this helps.
-han"
,handsolo7,2011-08-10T19:01Z,"Also, like mlipe, I too chose to remove some voice files that I don't use, due to lack of space on the Nuvi. And I just felt compelled to copy over all the files—it works fine."
,SerSpec-V,2011-08-23T03:59Z,"You don't need to del any files on a 255W since you only need the gmapprom file, .JCV doesn't work on 255W so don't bother to install it. "
,TaiTheGuy,2011-08-26T21:07Z,"Uhhh, whats with the name?
Not to mention i 1st noticed it looking for ""the help"", AND i sell 5- 10 garmins a year on craigslist! Wierd. Im 25 & have been usin my name/alias for half my life."
,mambrake,2011-08-29T03:13Z,"I am confused. I deleted the .IMG files from my Garmin 1390T and tried to replace them but they are still to large. I deleted voice files to.  If i do it on the SD card, wich .IMG file do i change to gmapsupp.IMG? Do i install all the files you sent to my SD card?"
,mambrake,2011-08-29T03:38Z,"Am i able to break the .IMG files apart? (e.g) gmapbmap,gmaptz .JCV files into the garmin device and gmaprom into SD card? also If i put gmapprom in SD card do i change the file name to gmapsupp? Please help."
,monchi89,2011-09-07T22:32Z,"Thanks, it worked for me. just copy the file to the hidden .System folder. Make a backup of your original file first. It took 40m for me to save my original file and 40m to copy the new file. Thanks for sharing!"
,7golfnut,2011-09-10T23:20Z,"This wouldn't work on my old Garmin C330.  I have to use a SD card with gmapsupp.img to have the maps be recognized.  I renamed gmapprom.img to gmapsupp.img (the closest in file size to my 2010 maps), copied it to the SD card and no joy.  This may work on the Nuvi and other newer Garmin devices but I couldn't get it to work on my C330.  I d/l'd the 2011 maps and they work fine.

In any case, thanks for the upload and the effort to post!"
,bl00dcarver,2011-09-24T14:50Z,Hey works great i have renamed and saved the .img to a folder on an sd card now where do i put the rest of these file the most important one to me is junction view/lane assist file where does it go in the same folder on the sd card?? or somwhere else??
,chiefFox,2011-10-05T08:02Z,works with Garmin nuvi 350. Thank you! I'm sharing this!
,oviovik,2011-10-15T07:10Z,"Hello Guys. 
I want to know if I can put this 2012 map on my old Garmin c320. if yes how to do that? please help) thank u in advance)"
,giant350,2011-10-19T21:05Z,"I live in Southern California and own a Garmen Nuvi 750.  I backed up gmapbmap.img and gmapprom.img and then replaced them with the new versions.

I recently tested the unit by going to a city that is about 100 miles away.  

My Nuvi 750 recognized the updated maps and worked perfectly."
,mrnik2007,2011-10-20T01:19Z,Are POIs updated automatically once you update the IMG file?
,psuman,2011-10-26T14:09Z,Worked like a charm. Can't speak for all of the files as I only added the maps. Thanks.
,buckawheat,2011-10-31T06:51Z,Thanks!  Worked like a charm.  I didn't have enough internal space to update the .Jcv on my 1690 so I just left the factory one on there.  Had to delete a pile of voices to fit the updated Map pack but still have the ones I need.
,daddyjerz,2011-11-02T23:06Z,"Works perfect (except for a few oriental characters that show up in every now and again).  I have a Nuvi 255 and just backed up and replaced the gmapprom.img file.  Wasn't sure if I needed to replace the gmapbmap.img file but I didn't and so far so good. 

Also is it my choice on whether to put the files on an SD card or not?  I didn't do it as the instructions mentioned.  Anyone who knows let me know.  Thanks Metheguy!! You saved me 90 bucks :D"
,ctb10j,2011-11-09T06:44Z,Im not understand what to do to install this map on an SD disk and have the garmin read it.  I do not have mapsource or any other software.  How can I install this map onto an SD disk so my garmin nuvi 200 can read it?  I do not have the internal space to fit on garmin.  Thanks
,rufino1212,2011-11-09T22:27Z,"Thank you very much, your map works very well.  I have two Garmin devices, one is the 660 and the other is Pilot C530; your map works in the 660 however the C530 does not have enough memory to support your map.  I put the map in the SD memory card but it still doesn't work even after following your steps.  Do you have any advice on what else I can?

Thank you very much for your help."
,LILC1024,2011-11-12T08:03Z,Thank you it works great
,farname,2012-01-11T22:51Z,Worked great! On Garmin nuvi 650 there is not enough physical memory to put it in the rom. It only has a total of 1.9GB total memory so you must use a 2GB SD card. Dont bother trying to delete voices or anything else as there is not enough memory even if you could delete everything.
,gary88254,2012-01-17T04:51Z,rapid downloading
,luneaux,2012-01-22T01:15Z,"works perfectly, although there are some spelling errors for certain streets. "
,jimwalcot,2012-03-13T00:50Z,"I downloaded and installed on an sd card and it works perfectly, but i just used one file - gmapprom.img. there are other files like GMAP3D.img, gmaptz.img, and gmapbmap.img. i am not sure what to do with these files. i know the gmap3d gives 3d mapping, but do i just add that file to my sd card as well? thanks."
,raytome,2012-03-19T16:38Z,The download speed was incredibly fast!!! 
,dman4x4,2012-03-28T21:36Z,I did add gmapsupp.img to garmin folder in the SD card but still my nuvi 710 couldn't recognize it.
,GhettoLee,2012-03-29T23:48Z,Can someone help me figure out how to use the files here to install them to either my sd card or my Nuvi 1100 gps? My computer says that they are image files but i can't burn them or mount them in Deamon Tools. Thanks to whoever can help me.
,jimwalcot,2012-04-19T05:12Z,"GhettoLee - You don't have to mount the file Daemon Tools. You just copy the file to an sd card and rename it to gmapsupp.img. If the nuvi does not recognize, it try changing the format to Fat or Fat32."
,jimwalcot,2012-04-19T05:14Z,"dman4x4 - If the nuvi does not recognize, it try changing the format to Fat or Fat32. fat32 did not work for me, but when I reformatted to Fat, it worked."
,tester852,2012-05-07T01:06Z,I followed Part B instructions. Works like a charm on Streetpilot c330. Thank you!!!
,naughty_damon,2012-05-20T05:39Z,"JCV file doesnt work on my Garmin 255... I did step 2, i created a new folder on my SD card called JCV and i put the JCV file inside that folder and still didnt work. 

Please help... "
,henpogi123,2012-05-30T03:45Z,"i just bought a nuvi 50 base model knowing that i can put maps from here. my nuvi only has the lower state of us plus cayman islands and doesn't have canada. does this mean that if i drive to canada it would give me poi's? or can it search addresses in canada?
