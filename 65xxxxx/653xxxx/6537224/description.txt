Highway 61 Revisited is the sixth studio album by singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. It was released in August 1965 by Columbia Records. On his previous album, Bringing It All Back Home, Dylan devoted Side One of the album to songs accompanied by an electric rock band, and Side Two to solo acoustic numbers. For Highway 61 Revisited, Dylan used rock backing on every track, except for the closing 11-minute acoustic song, "Desolation Row". Critics have written that Dylan's ability to combine driving, complex, blues-based rock music with the power of poetry, made Highway 61 Revisited one of the most influential albums ever recorded.

Leading off with his hit single of that summer, "Like a Rolling Stone", the album features many songs that have been acclaimed as classics and that Dylan has continued to perform live over his long career, including "Highway 61 Revisited", "Ballad of a Thin Man", and "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues". Dylan named the album after one of the great North American arteries, which connected his birthplace in Minnesota to southern cities famed for their musical heritage, including St. Louis, Memphis, and New Orleans.

Highway 61 Revisited peaked at number three in the United States charts and number four in the United Kingdom, while its single, "Like a Rolling Stone", reached number two in the US and number four in the UK. It is often considered by critics as his magnum opus. The album has received multiple accolades. It was ranked number four on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and "Like a Rolling Stone", "Desolation Row", and "Highway 61 Revisited" were listed at number one, number 185 and number 364, respectively, on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list.
