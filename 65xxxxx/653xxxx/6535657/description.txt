Hey this is a video i took from my iphone at the animal collective concert on July 9th 2011. I was front and center in the second row of the seats and nobody was in front. This is not a shitty grainy video but i didn't have and awesome camera or a tripod but the video is decent. The audio is excellent at all times and crowd noise has been edited out as best as I can on imovie. Hope everyone likes this
