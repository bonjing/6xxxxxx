invo is a multi-purpose and flexible operating system that is based around Linux kernel and GNU (these operating systems are simply called "Linux", however they are GNU/Linux distributions). Linvo's goal is to be easy and efficient to use, however productive and reliable, as GNU/Linux is! Linvo has the best applications for everyday and professional use! It comes in desktop Live CD form, which means that it can run simply from one CD, without installing it on your hard drive. An installer is included in the CD, so you can install it if you want. Linvo Live CD uses software modules, so you can customize your Live CD easily and you can select what to install. Linvo also comes in installation media, from which you can modify your installation to perfectly fit your needs. For more information, see 'Why Linvo'.
