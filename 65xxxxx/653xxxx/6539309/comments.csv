I really like this movie."
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-07-15T19:33Z,"u'r welcome miau

It seems that aรถmost everybody downloads at least one f the optional dub files. strange.

The English is muxed in mkv so most of you may want to download only the mkv (8.7 GB)."
,Night_89,2011-07-15T23:56Z,"thanks

could you please upload transformers duology with the best video and audio quality"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-07-16T01:05Z,"Night_89
I got the two already prepared, but I wait for the third then upload all 3 as trilogy torrent."
,Night_89,2011-07-16T07:01Z,I am wondering transformers 3 would take at least 4 months to come out on bluray and dvd
,Night_89,2011-07-16T07:03Z,and I must say revenge of the fallen would be Imax edition and it should not have black bars over the borders
