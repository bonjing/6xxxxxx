There is a torrent file for each DVD.
To find the other five torrent files, just search this website for AAGG

If you have trouble downloading or finding the torrent files on this website, you can instead download all six of them from media*fire or mega*upload.
This website won't let me post links, but I can post the ending part of the links.
Here they are:

Media*fire

Mega*upload

All you have to do is find a media*fire link then replace the ending part with the part I provided.
(Same thing for mega*upload)

If that doesn't work, you can try searching search Google for TNAufin53M0
That should bring up a video that has a link to the six torrent files.

Note:
They're the same six torrents that were uploaded to this website."
