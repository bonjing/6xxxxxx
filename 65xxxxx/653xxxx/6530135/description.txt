Michael Land et alii*: The Secret of Monkey Island (19th anniversary edition soundtrack)

40 minutes of pure nostalgia! Being unsatisfied with the audio quality and sequencing of the release over at LucasArts Soundtracks and other sites, I took the enhanced CD version of the game and tried to make a listenable experience out of it. I also added the PC speaker version of the main titles to the album. The track list (below) and its song titles are different to other releases but I included alternative names of the pieces in the liner notes/comments of the FLAC files (and as tooltips on this page) to keep the confusion low. This "19th Anniversary Edition" tries to serve the audiophile as well as the completist. Download and have fun! If you're not able to handle torrent files, please contact me for a direct download link.
