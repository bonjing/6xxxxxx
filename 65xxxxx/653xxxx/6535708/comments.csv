[V],_F1_,2011-07-12T21:44Z,"Really? Oh!!!
I least bother. I'm here to share files only which I'm doing with my heart and soul. Thanx anyway ///"
[T],theLEAK,2011-07-12T22:13Z,Dude! Congrats on the skull! :D
[V],_F1_,2011-07-12T22:44Z,Thanx mate ///
[V],_F1_,2011-07-12T23:24Z,"Boom!!! Now the goal is to turn that to green!!!

Actually the thing is not like that. I feel TPB provides that skull for downloaders only; that is just kind of an indication to the newbies that the material is from a trusted source, means less chance of discovering crap after downloading. I'm here for only last 20 days as an uploader till today and you people are with me from the very beginning. You all know the quality of my upload. That skull doesn't mean anything to you. And I believe none of my credit is related to get a skull indicator beside my name; that is for all you people: encouraging me by thanking, promoting me to the forum etc. So, why congrats to me? Congrats to all of you for your selfless support ///"

   You are on the way to change the history. I dont know whether you realise how important is the free access to thechnological information. Thousands engineers like me all over the world dont have access to such books and i am so thankfull. "
[V],_F1_,2011-07-13T03:05Z,"That realization has actually brought me here, my friend. Even today also sometimes I myself starve for some books and codes related to my field (hydrocarbons). Thanx to my employer who has the ultimate international online codes and guides available for the employers. I don't post those staffs, may be some other time when I'll leave the organization ///"
