,pyroclastPRO,2011-07-27T10:44Z,i dont know why but i cannot access your other torrents. I can only see 2 torrents of yours :(
,pyroclastPRO,2011-07-27T10:50Z,@zombifuzz i dont know why but i cant access your other torrents. only 2 torrents are available. @@
,xBSAACHRIS434x,2011-08-01T20:08Z,"@pyroclastPRO that's because he deleted all his old torrents. I don't get it but whatever. Jonnybeans was the only reliable source for good music. He has a job in the music industry now so I'm guessing that's why. MUSIC SHOULD BE FREE FOR EVERYONE I am in a band and fully support file sharing especially music. I love you Jonny, but damn stop being a pussy and up some real shit. My bandwidth is terrible but check out my torrents I only up a few a week but I try my best."
