He is going to get it soon. I have seen the discussion in TPB

anyway hanks for the re-up"

Thanks again."
,goelijan,2011-07-30T19:02Z,Where can I find the English subtitles for THESE episodes? I tried alot of subtitles but they don't sync.
,CakeMonster,2011-08-17T09:42Z,"How is it possible that a 720p file is only 300mb

Normally 720p files of a 45 min show is 1.09 gb

So are these 300mb files and just stretched out so that they will when vlc launches open in a window ande be the same window size but not pixel quality as a real 720p

Please explain it all to me, I do not understand"
,I.Kagerou,2011-08-20T18:20Z,"@mkvGOD

Are you gonna encode the BD for season 5 once it comes out? BTW thanks a bunch for this. I second the subtitles though. I know the syncing is real simple but since it's also tedious and I don't have much time... Anybody out there who would like to do the community a favor?

@CakeMonster

When you say that the video just ""stretches out"", I suppose you're asking if it's an upscale. This is most likely NOT an upscale. It's probably a downscale, since the guy said he used Bluray. The WebDL was probably 720p though. And even if it is an upscale, the file size would probably be larger than it's original.

That's not really your question though. Sorry 'bout the rant. Anyways, on a Bluray disk the original file size is WAY larger than 1GB. What encoders do is take the original Bluray, extract the video file, compress it and ta-dah! You have a compressed video file. Depending on how it's compressed (as in how good it's done) the files can range from as small as 250mb to it's original Bluray disk size. Unless the compression goes wrong and it ends up larger. Which has not happened that I know of and will not. Probably. BTW I'm only talking about 45 min TV shows.

If you're still reading, kudos. You know how Bluray is all about Hi-Def? Well to preserve the Hi-Def goodness, the compressed file can't be too small or else it'll lose the good stuff. 1GB HD files usually keeps most of the good stuff. Unless the compression gets f-ed up. That's another story. But most of us want HD and space saving aspects. That's where awesome encoders come in. I don't know how they do it, but they make it just right so the quality's still there but the files won't be munching up disk space like the Cookie Monster munches cookies.

Really sorry 'bout the rant again. There's more to compression I'd like to explain but if I did that I'd take half the page. I hope you're satisfied with this answer (if you even get around to reading it) and if you aren't, you can ask me (if you don't mind rants) or ask others or check wiki."
,CakeMonster,2011-08-22T14:59Z,"@I.Kagerou

If what you say is true then that is interesting

From my understanding all  blu ray 720p 44 min episodes were 1.09GB

All 1080p Blue ray 44 min episodes were 2,18 GB

That was my understanding until I saw these episodes

By stretched out I meant that the window size of the video was increased but the quality was not just a trick so that the file opens in a bigger window than it should

Anyway your comments about selecting quality from HD and keeping some vs size, I do not know if I can believe that

My opinion is still same as before 44 min 720p episodes that are blu ray should be 1.09GB"
,CakeMonster,2011-08-22T15:06Z,"@I.Kagerou

Am uncertain about 1080p blu ray size so forget that part of what I wrote"
,bocian82,2011-08-26T12:41Z,file are so small becaouse Nominal bit rate : 700 Kbps normaly is much higher
,CakeMonster,2011-08-27T17:00Z,"@bocian82

So nominal bit rate dosen't effect HD?"
,jadedpick,2011-08-30T05:03Z,thank you so much!
,spookypie,2011-09-07T20:36Z,Thank you!
,fillinthisspace,2011-09-13T02:33Z,"These are around the same quality as a 480p 350MB AVI. Maybe a little better, but had they been encoded at 480p they would have looked great. 720p though really requires a higher bitrate.
A good quality 480p video when up-sized and displaying on a large TV would have looked better. Personally, I always go for quality first, resolution second.

@ CakeMonster,
Yes bitrate effects quality. I.Kagerou was offering generalisations which don't really mean much.
In the case of these encodes, the bitrate is really too low for the resolution (well at least it is for the couple of episodes I downloaded). I guess you might be able to call them high definition, but they're not high quality."
,LeeH,2011-09-13T07:42Z,THANKYOU!!  Great quality.

,Mimimae,2011-10-17T15:52Z,"Thanks for naming files, but you have very strange name convention. episodes should be named like 01, 02, 03... instead for 1, 2, 3.
Obviously."

nice upload

but where is english subtitles??

i desperate needed????

is there any link guys...???

all 720 subs out of sync... help me.???

suggestion :- better to include english subtitle with torrents in future uploads"

,xodarap7,2012-01-05T04:18Z,"Wow, all this confused talk about bitrates, sizes, quality, and HD.

It's VERY SIMPLE.  Not as complicated as made out.  You have a bitrate that determines quality, and a framesize... and a framerate.  Think of mp3s: A five-minute 128k mp3 will be half the filesize as a five-minute 256k.  That's the bitrate, or quality.

Video has another dimension.  But it's no different than the temporal (time) dimsension - it ""spreads out"" quality, so a 720p file, which takes up about 3x as much space as a 480p file, will be about 1/3rd the quality for the same size.  Normal file-size for a 480p rip is 350M, so these are about 1/4 to 1/3 the regular quality of a 480p rip.

Number of pixels is a quality factor, as are encoding speed and processing filters.

Okay, so that sounds complicated... but it's really not :P  Summary is that this encoder, despite the hyperbolic moniker, would be better off encoding at 480p for this filesize.  It would net a better subjective visual quality, because he would be getting more ""bits per pixel"" and also having to employ fewer smoothing filters, which decimate quality.

But people want to see the frame light up to 720p size, so this is what they get :)"
