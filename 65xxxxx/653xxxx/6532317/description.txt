 Pattern Recognition has a long history of applications to data analysis in business, military and social economic activities. While the aim of pattern recognition is to discover the pattern of a data set, the size of the data set is closely related to the methodology one adopts for analysis. Intelligent Data Analysis: Developing New Methodologies Through Pattern Discovery and Recovery tackles those data sets and covers a variety of issues in relation to intelligent data analysis so that patterns from frequent or rare events in spatial or temporal spaces can be revealed. This book brings together current research, results, problems, and applications from both theoretical and practical approaches.
