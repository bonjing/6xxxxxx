The content is from the GOTY edition of the game, and is DRM-Free."
,black_shadow_1981,2011-07-11T03:12Z,"could useing this get me a ban?

thanks for the upload"
,DeMoGoGoN,2011-07-11T13:20Z,"As with using ANY copied content, there is always a risk...  

However, this content does not require any disk, and was designed to be installed on the content.  So in this case, I would say the risk is minimal."
,DeMoGoGoN,2011-07-11T13:21Z,*installed on teh console*
,DutchMfkr,2011-07-11T16:44Z,I cant find the Title Update.

,DeMoGoGoN,2011-07-11T17:28Z,"I also have the DRM Free DLC for Borderlands(Including Title Update this time) and the 'Bring Down The Sky' DRM Free DLC for Mass Effect.  If anybody wants these, just post here and I'll upload them. :)"
,bush82,2011-07-12T11:16Z,hey DeMoGoGon ive noticed the other day that the DLC for red dead redemption is DRM free the disc version once installed from disc it can be copied with a memory stick.
,theclarkster,2011-07-14T21:07Z,"Alright mate ive done as you say with the memory stick but evertime i go to put it on my xbox its says they disk space has gone on the memory stick but all the options to transfer to my hdd are empty,games,gamer profiles,demos videos ect. PLEASE HELP!"
,DeMoGoGoN,2011-07-15T00:53Z,"OK, sounds like you may not be placing the files in the correct locations.

I have the instructions with pictures but it seems TPB wont let me post this particular link... lol"
,DeMoGoGoN,2011-07-15T00:56Z,"OK, sounds like you may not be placing the files in the correct locations.

I have the instructions with pictures available here: xbox360.dyndns.org

(Tip: If you are using IE9, make sure you toggle Compatibility View if the pictures dont show)"
,DeMoGoGoN,2011-07-15T00:57Z,Figured out that it was a word in the link that TPB didnt like... lol

,J288,2011-07-17T21:56Z,"Thanks mate! Got it all loaded to the game. Every chapter and pack is viewable in-game under DLC in the menu. However only the three official chapters are playable (via the top menu). 

How do I use the packs that you have added? Like Vegas Pack and all; by the way - what are all of those packs? Maybe I can read more about them somewhere?

Thanks!"
,J288,2011-07-17T21:58Z,"...the message/questions above was of course to you DeMoGoGoN , didn't mention your name there though :)"
,hawk333,2011-07-25T13:54Z,Thankyou Dude
,hawk333,2011-07-25T13:56Z,"@J288 The Vegas pack and the others are car packs, once you complete the first 2 or 3 missions and park your first car in the garage, you can press x at the garage to open a menu and it shows all your dlc cars for you to take out and drive, some of these packs also add clothing which can be changed into at the wardrobe inside your house."

,sdodge06,2011-08-26T12:38Z,"Hey man disregard my last comment. Turns out I did not do everything right. When I made the 0000000000000000 folder I didn't put it under content, i just put it under Data.  So then I just moved that folder to Content and worked perfectly. That's my bad man, and thanks for the upload, I seeded too. :)"
