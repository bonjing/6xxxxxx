try Battlestar Galactica with best video quality, minor increase in size than usual would not be a problem if the video quality goes better
and make sure you include everything of the series

Miniseries (2003)
Season 1
Season 2
Webisodes: The Resistance
Season 3
Webisodes: Razor Flashbacks
Razor (TV movie)

,kkiran,2011-07-12T14:05Z,wen will u upload sopranos?
,ManLemon,2011-07-12T15:08Z,"Excellent, I so wish there will be a sequel to this show (a man can dream).

And I second the request for Battlestar Galactica (though I normaly don't request anything, happy enough already you're doing this for free) :D"
,pjsmoke,2011-07-12T15:38Z,"Thanks again Brosef.

I'm awaiting 720p Battlestar Gallactica also...and I hope you are able to fix the conversation problem."
,pjsmoke,2011-07-12T15:48Z,"Also, I hope you're still re-encoding The 4400...no rush, I'd just love to have a great quality 900p small size version."

DO U TAKE REQUESTS FOR MOVIES?????"
,Xorakka,2011-07-14T06:14Z,The cancellation of this show by FOX was the biggest tragedy ever. :(
,menopirate,2011-07-14T20:49Z,"@mkvGOD
thanks for all your work, but please educate yourself how FB is used to track people down. I would hate if you were one of them. 
Maybe better find a place in the forum here..."

,BONGARA,2011-07-15T15:56Z,"you're ONE of the BEST quality uploaders, thank you very much for your huge efforts. please upload more of these highest rated series and take care =)"
,pjsmoke,2011-07-16T03:26Z,"Somehow my Sopranos dvdrip encodes and your Deadwood rip completely disappeared from my hdd! I tried a recovery tool and there is not one trace of these videos on my HDD.

Geez, I must of deleted them by accident somehow and forgot because my HDDs are fine and everything else is there.

Needless to say, I am redownloading your Deadwood rip again and will download your Sopranos bluray rip [if you are doing it?]


Point being, I'm a frigging idiot and thank you."
[V],mkvGOD,2011-07-16T04:58Z,haha

Thanks a lot.
A Request - Since you have been uploading TV series lately could you upload this one.

Band Of Brothers 720p
IMDB: 9.6

Its not available in 720p in decent size as torrent. Please try. "
,kkiran,2011-07-16T11:52Z,"wen is sopranos being uploaded?
?"
,pjsmoke,2011-07-22T01:47Z,Episode 07 Jaynestown has hard-coded subs...it's a shame too because that's my favourite Firefly episode. No matter.

,drako314,2011-11-04T22:57Z,"Very good series,
The quality is above average on a 1080 hi def screen.
A=10
V=9"
,MongKP,2011-12-14T13:53Z,Thank you for your share. Seen Serenity before and really like it. wish I enjoy this as well.
,SR4T9US,2011-12-16T09:35Z,Video is not as clear as FatFreddy's 720 but this doesn't have the fuck-ups that his torrent has. Threw the others away in favor of this ..Thanks for the up.
,Burnzy_Ryan,2012-01-22T15:16Z,"@mkvGOD thanks so much for this, i don't know what i'd do without a pirate like you :) it's a nooby question but do i watch them in the order you marked them 1,2,3... with serenity being first ? I'm confused because of the muddled up air-dates on wikipedia. Thanks again mate"
,BxRxUxCxExLxExE,2012-01-29T21:14Z,Thank ya =D
,Kalohux,2012-01-30T13:22Z,"This was so fucking stupid! What the hell are wrong with you guys? Are you fucking retarded or have you drunk to much of that fluorided water of yours?

Even my teenage children thought this show was stupid and childish."
,xny675,2012-02-27T06:11Z,"Watchable but it's slightly beyond me why you'd take 720P source and compress it more than anyone would who wanted good quality out of standard def.  
In other words, the quality's no better than a good standard def torrent.  In some ways it's worse.  
Thanks, though."
