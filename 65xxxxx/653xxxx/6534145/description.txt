Frankie Lee Sims  Essential Blues 
Label: Master Classics Records
Released: 2009
Time: 78:35
Format: Mp3@320


Cousin of the honorable Lightnin' Hopkins and ardent devotee of the Country Blues culture (Texas style), Frankie Lee Sims rocked the late 1940s and early 1950s with a crunchy, dirty tube-toned, Electric Blues guitar style all his own. Sims' fevered playing pumped a healthy dose of octane boost into the gas tank of his near satanic sound, often inviting the likes of Smokey Hogg and Lil' Son Jackson along for the ride.
