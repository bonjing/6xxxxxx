1) Go to the following link: http://1337x.org/torrent/221943/Harry-Potter-and-The-Deathly-Hallows-Part-2-Proper-RELOADED-Crack-Only/ 

2) Download the Crack via torrent

3) Copy all the files which are inside the Crack folder (DONT COPY THE FILE)

4) Go to the place where the game is installed (My computer/C:/Program Files/Electronic Arts/Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows(TM) - Part 2

5) Now go to the file named ''pc''

6) Paste the files that you have copied
Note: These files have to overwrite the similar ones which are already inside the folder. So if a note pop up while copying asking you to overwrite click ''overwrite''. This will happen only if some of the files you copied already exist in the ''pc'' file.

7) Run the file ''hp8''

8) Play the game

If someone has any other problems with installment in Vista send me a message.. :) :) "

,BJLindsay,2011-07-23T23:36Z,First I want to say thanks for the download. I have always enjoyed your torrents and they always work for me. However I am having trouble with this one. The first time I tried I copied the only file that was in the Skidrow folder which is the Paul.dll into the PC folder and it told me that I needed the 2nd CD. Then I tried the suggetion that was listed on here for the crack and now it does try to start but it stays minimized and does not respond and crashes. So I tried to do both and it does the not responding thing. I have unistalled and reinstalled several times and does not work for me at all. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what to do. Because of alot of people saying that this game is not all that great I would really like to try it before I buy it for the Wii. Also I would like to add that the people that are cussing out the people that are complaining that is not really necessary. Just a polite don't complain really is enough. And for the ones that are complaining these people do work quite a bit to give you free games. They don't really have to do this for us. It is really for us to try the game before going out and wasting money. Thank you again for the games you provide for us.
,BJLindsay,2011-07-23T23:50Z,OH BTW I have disabled my AVG as well because that picks up the Paul.dll as a threat. But I put it in the exceptions anyhow. I also put it in the excption for my windows firewall but I also disabled that as well.
,Fuzzidio,2011-07-24T04:02Z,"Hey Thank you Extremezone for torrent, i installed and pasted cracks and it works fine, for those people who have had problems at the bridge make sure your running down not up, you dont have to kill him because he falls off the bridge at the end anyway.

Im Stuck at the Giant Part where you press 5, ive seen other people have this problem...can anyone tell us how to get past it"

,BJLindsay,2011-07-24T11:15Z,I got yet another error this time which was paul.dll in not a valid file....I just really don't knw what to do. I am putting it in the same folder every time nd I am getting different errors...lol. And when it does try to runs with no errors it stays minimized and goes to not responding then crashes. I don't know hw many times I have uninstlled it and reinstalled. When I uninstall it I even run CCcleaner to make sure I get everything off of my computer for a fresh install. Oh and I forgot to say this before I am seeding and will continue to do so until I finish the game myself since alot of people don't seed. 
,Gandalf13,2011-07-24T13:59Z,Guys I have downloaded it but I dont know what to do next..Can anyone help me please? Thank you...
,BJLindsay,2011-07-24T20:44Z,Can someone help me please...and @Gandalf13 the instructions are in the NFO file that was downloaded or on the top of this page in the info.
,BJLindsay,2011-07-24T20:45Z, @Gandalf13 again if you have problems after following the instructions then ask for help. :-)
,BJLindsay,2011-07-24T21:37Z,I want to add a note for the people saying that this torrent is really slow and it is taking a long time like 24 hours and stuff. It was taking along time to download game torrents for me and then while I was downloading this I looked up on google what the best settings were for Utorrent on Vista and when I changed the settings it downloaded in a couple hours. You might want to look into what the best settings are for your torrent client and change them as I did. I can't remember the page I went to and it is gone from my history because I have already cleaned it out but the page I found will give you a small range of numbers. I went from downloading at 30/sec to over 1000+. So it makes a big difference. 
,gandlaftheslightlypurple,2011-07-24T22:40Z,"Thanks Skidrow it works for me,

All i did was put the paul.dll file into pc folder in the installation directory and it launched perfectly, i don't know why yours aren't working i'm not a programmer, but i do know that just because a crack works for some people doesn't mean it will work for everybody, some specifications about your computer may not be compatible for this crack, so don't slay the hard working programmers that made it work for some of us just because your too tight to go out and actually buy the damn game

Thanks,
Gandalf"

Why you're failing at pushing 5 is that you don't push it quick enough. Just start spamming 5 as fast as you can from the moment Mcgonagall says 'Protego!' (instead of waiting for when your game is going to tell you to push 5). That should do the trick (:"

Don't worry about the crack yet, just mount the image, and if the installation window doesn't pop up, go to whatever drive you mounted on and open it up (right click, open). Then click one of the EA Installer icons. Then use one of the CD-keys given.
After the game has installed, find it. I suggest choosing the normal install option, and then you will find the game in Program Files/Electronic Arts/... Open the pc folder.
