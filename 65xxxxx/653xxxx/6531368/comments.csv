,aftyrbyrn,2011-07-11T15:30Z,As expected.  Opaque. Sears catalog photoshoot.
,Ioxen,2011-07-11T18:47Z,"Why they feel the need to share their feelings on the tameness of the sets every single week is beyond me. 
Thanks wmi."
,lodger111,2011-07-11T23:43Z,"That baffles me too. If you like it, download it.  If not, don't.  WMI has helpfully provided a preview so you know beforehand if it's worth your time.  And if you're only after porn, guess what, there's a whole section on TPB full of that!

Sandra is quality eye candy no matter what she's wearing or how much. *That's* the point of this set.

And a big thanks to you, WMI.  I know very well how thankless it is taking the time and trouble to upload pic sets, only to take crap from ingrates.  More so, given you pay for this stuff so we don't have to."
,Gunnar_Sigmundson,2011-07-12T02:30Z,Lodger111 said it perfectly. Kudos. 
,TheLeecher,2011-07-12T03:41Z,"I'm one of them who dont want her to undress for the camera.
And WOW shes pretty in this set."
,BBD3,2011-07-12T03:47Z,"i wait every monday morning for new sandra, thank you WMI!"
,lena.katina,2011-07-12T14:48Z,"@the leecher

if you dont want to see her pussy, or her undressed, or you dont wanna see her get fucked, then you probably have some psychological issues.

it is called a mother-complex, or Oedipus-complex.
That is usually guys who want an idealised women, worship her, but feel that she can't have sex without becoming ""dirty"".

LOL . anyway the set is pretty good, at least you see her nice ass presented well.
thanks WMI"

wrong... that complex presents itself in every men in the phalic stage according to Freud... the wrong closure of this complex may cause some pathologies... the complex itself its not a pathology... "
