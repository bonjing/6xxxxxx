Really wanted to check it out again after some years of not playing it, see how they're doing considering all the bots and login problems etc, but the downloader from the site is just so friggin slow.. I've been dl'ing for 2 hours and 45 minutes now, and I'm at 52.3%. Will keep seeding after I'm done ^^ "

Tried to login, but they didn't think it was important enough to mention that I only have three tries (didn't remember my pass, so tried everything I used the last years), so my account got blocked for one hour. After noticing that clicking the 'Forgot my password' button won't work either, I decided to make a new account. My email adress was too long, so I made a new one just for this game. After filling in everything on the site, yep, you can guess it, SERVICE ERROR. (Tried it 3 times..) So, once again, FUCK YOU JOYMAX."

i too have stopped playing SRO for a couple of years until i tried it again. as usual, their downloader was a headache.

if you weren't able to get in again, the bots are still there but not as bad as it was in 2009 when i stopped. at least sometimes, i could get in in just a few minutes. hehehe.

anyways, i hope you try SRO again. i am enjoying it again.

legend 8 is coming and currently downloading from their downloader which is still a headache. will upload here when i'm done."
