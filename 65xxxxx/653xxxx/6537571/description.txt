Product Description
For Becky (Rachel McAdams, "The Notebook"), running a TV show in New York City was the big break she dreamed ofâ€¦until star co-anchors Mike (Harrison Ford, Indiana Jones) and Colleen (Diane Keaton, "Somethingâ€™s Gotta Give") declare an all-out, on-air war. Making the show work with its cast of eccentric characters and outrageous story angles will take a major miracle, but Becky is ready to rise and outshine. From the writer of "The Devil Wears Prada" and "27 Dresses", "Morning Glory" is a â€œTart, terrific comedy*â€ that critics rave is, â€œSmart! Fresh! Brilliant! Heartwarming! Morning Glory has it all!*â€ *Peter Travers , Rolling Stone **Neil Rosen, NY1
