PES 2010 focuses on enhancing the excitement of matches between players,
making for a truly challenging experience that will constantly test the
player. Intuitive zonal defending will cover spaces and players need to look
constantly for new ways to attack. PES 2010 focuses on being a real football
simulation, as it requires both strategic play and quick reactions, as in
real life. In addition to key out-field elements, goalkeepers are more
versatile and with abilities matching those of modern shot-stoppers. The
game\'s referees have also been reworked, with smarter AI elements allowing
them to make more balanced calls during matches.

PES 2010 has undergone a major visual revamp, with its celebrated player
likenesses and animations now even closer to those of real-life players
including live player expressions to be depicted with an improved lighting
system which differentiates between various conditions! Stadium detail is
also massively improved, with the grass and other in-stadium elements
finely depicted.
