[T],Rajon.Ri,2011-07-14T03:01Z,Hey HolyRoses. Is it possible to make copies compatible for most HDTV usb ports. My HDTV has a usb port but it only supports certain formats which don't include this kind of file or encoding. My only suggestion is you try and see what you can do to make your copies universal for HDTV's as well.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-07-14T03:36Z,what is your tv model and give me a link to its manual in PDF form.
,rockstar172,2011-07-14T18:01Z,holy your awesome. =)

[T],Rajon.Ri,2011-07-15T01:16Z,It's the SV471XVT model I don't know if that has anything to do with it
,Krizzy901,2011-07-15T15:52Z,HR - How is this release larger than the source?
[V],HolyRoses,2011-07-15T17:29Z,I didn't dumb down the bitrate in my encoder.  this was already dumbed down a lot and didn't want to risk further reducing the quality.  BRRIP be out in day or 2 anyhow if you want to wait for it.
,Rahail,2011-07-16T01:38Z,Thank you HR
