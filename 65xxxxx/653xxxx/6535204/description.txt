[Notes]

A hedonistic blend of dizzying electro-pop with their roots in the rock
scene, Denver, CO duo Breathe Carolina have their eyes on superstardom with
the release of 'Hell Is What You Make It.' With every album, their tracks
get stronger, their sound gets tighter, their crowds get larger and the buzz
gets bigger. Their third full-length sees the band at their best - pushing
their own limits, determined to bring their party to the masses. Kicking off
2011 with a performance at Winter X Games, Breathe Carolina stormed into
their biggest year yet, with a performance at Bamboozle Festival and a full
summer headline tour booked. Their impressive resume that already boasts
music cues on NBC's Monday Night Football, The Jay Leno Show and MTV's The
Hills/ The City, a slot in Alternative Press' Most Anticipated Albums 2011,
and 60,000 copies already sold of their hit album Hello Fascination.

Featuring killer lead single 'Blackout'--a bevy of 80s-tinged electro
melodies and hip-shakingly infectious driving beats--every inch of 'Hell Is
What You Make It' is designed to grab you by the hand and drag you to the
dancefloor. Bring on the good times - Breathe Carolina is about to give you
the summer of your lives!
