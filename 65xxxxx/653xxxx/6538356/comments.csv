can't remove as I did that with 04-05-06 = named it incorrectly, removed and tried to re-upload by deleting the bit torrent on my hard drive.  Then making a new one, re-named it and tried to upload... tpb keeps telling me it's in the system.  So, if anyone has any idea how to fix this, I would like to upload E04- 05 06..."
