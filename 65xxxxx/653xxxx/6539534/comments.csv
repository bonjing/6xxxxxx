,Courtnut,2011-07-19T04:47Z,Can anyone confirm this is Kara no Shoujo? I am skeptical because I know that mangagamer did not release Kara no Shoujo with voices due to expenses.
,deathtoaji,2011-07-19T14:42Z,It didn't have the voices as I said it was excluded from the official english release. The voices were patched in from the original Japanese

it has a minor, but pretty annoying bug that reveals the character's endgame profile right when you first meet them, sometimes giving out important plot-related spoilers."
