Whoever you are, you do a better job of giving me what I want to watch than CTV who surely pays millions for the ""rights"" to do this then fuck it up with shitty commercials and a streaming site that doesn't fucking work with a Mac, and who fucking blocks my access to Comedy Central's stream.

You my friend are the future of media. If I was a rich man I would offer to fund your operations, alas I am merely a consumer of Stew Beef's epic digital file."
