,rikurakutaa,2011-07-21T11:54Z,"I can't play these files. I've tried mpc, VLC, Quicktime and even re-installed K-codec pack and checked if the problem was there but it was okay... I think :) So can anyone help me with this?
Actually this is the first time having this kind of problem which I couldn't find solution by googling. I mean there were and I tried them but nothing changed."
,rikurakutaa,2011-07-21T11:58Z,Forgot to mention that VLC plays but it shows only a picture of Victoria with two dogs so I was wondering if this is a fake?
,xxxSIKSxxx,2011-08-25T11:32Z,"i dont think its fake, but these files are auto-associated with iTunes. i read someone's post through another torrent site that these require a password through iTunes.    These didn't work with VLC for me either. :( thanks anyway felixufpe"
,truthseekers666,2011-10-02T12:38Z,Downloaded and im quite experienced with wierd formats and this doesnt play 1 of the files. Its some idiot who downloaded them on iTunes and then thought they could share them. Thats not in the Mac users mindset... bzzzzt. Corrupt.

,babylulis,2012-05-27T00:52Z,It's m4v file. It opens directly on itunes but asks for the apple ID which obviously we don't have. I'll try downloading a converter for m4v files. VLC won't play it and handbrake won't convert them.
