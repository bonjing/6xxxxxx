Origin is the first demo CD by American rock band Evanescence. It was released on November 4, 2000 through Bigwig Enterprises. Although it is commonly referred to as a full-length album, Amy Lee explicitly refers to it as a "dressed up" demo CD. Only 2,500 copies were pressed and sold at the band's live concerts in Little Rock, Arkansas and on the Bigwig Enterprises website. However, pirated versions of the album later began selling for over $300 on eBay, making it nearly impossible to receive an original copy.
Origin contains the earlier versions of "My Immortal," "Imaginary" and "Whisper", which were later re-recorded for the band's debut album Fallen. Origin is also considerably different from the band's later releases, containing more industrial pieces of music whilst the tracks are more linked to others.
