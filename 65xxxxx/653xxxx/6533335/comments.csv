For those who are having difficulty deciding whether or not to try it, it's basically Kitchen Nightmares (UK Version) with more of a focus on front of house and design, brought to us by Fernando Peire, Director of London's 'The Ivy' restaurant.   With Fernando, the viewer is greeted with less shouting and 'a touch' (alright, 'a boatload') more class. 

So sad its initial run is only six episodes.  I hope for many more seasons to come.  

Thanks again TvTeam, your hard work when it comes to consistently bring us new series' such as this is very admirable!"
