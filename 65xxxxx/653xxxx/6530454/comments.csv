,BoonDockSaiNt30,2011-07-14T16:09Z,"Dang it. Why is all of these ""cinavia"" protected? Isn't there a way around this crap?"
,BKhanford,2011-07-19T05:27Z,"@BoonDockSaiNt30. its called get an xbox lol, i play all of these movies on my xbox and not once has it done somethin like that. im guessing you are on the ""powerhouse PS3""?"
,AriGold45,2011-07-20T17:18Z,"^^ I agree, you should get an XBOX. But at the same time, it's not the PS3's fault... All Blu-Ray players are required to have CINAVIA"
,tmkuroda,2011-07-22T17:27Z,why don't you do like me and buy a WD plus live media player and just move the movies over to a hard drive to play on your TV. Much faster then burning dvds and cheaper in the long run.  Amazon has the WD for $89.
,r0bbinh00d,2011-07-24T04:23Z,A/4 : V/6
,jvanwey,2011-07-24T19:58Z,bkahnford must be terible to not be able to view blu ray. and have to plug your head set into your controler. enjoy your hd dvd lol 
,ronibob,2011-07-30T19:05Z,just buy an external hard drive download it to that then play it on your plasma or lcd using them as your monitor just buy an extra monitor cable and a monitor switch off ebay for less than a fiver ive been doing it for years.
,dohcturbo,2011-08-01T10:18Z,"You can use a ps3 that hasnt the update for the cinavia.
I use the xbox for now while its offline but think theres an update.
Or a Iomega mulimedia station.
Plenty ways around it."
,whybitch_itsfree,2011-08-05T08:26Z,"To All Whiners & Complainers:

Stop doing that annoying thing you do, and go pay for a movie, then come back and see if you appreciate that the people here that PROVIDE this service for you, actually did JUST THAT... they paid, so you wouldn't have to.  Show a little respect and gratitude, or keep your negative comments to yourself.  

There was never any implied ""theater quality"".  You get exactly what you've paid for (I'm not going to do the accounting on this for you)

As for you other complete tools that want to babble mindlessly over whether you should watch it on an xbox or a playstation or whatever fanboy gadget is the latest and greatest..... here is the solution you've been waiting for:

Items Required:
1 x BIG TV (42"" or better)
1 x laptop with HDMI Output
1 x HDMI cable
1 x Wireless Keyboard and Mouse
1 x shut the herll up about which setup is better to watch it on because  no one here has $20,000 invested in their very own personal home theater.

I highly doubt someone who knows their  Home Theater Audio gear is going to play a bunch of staticky crackly audio form a movie through their X Brand name towers, nor will they play flickery crappy video through their 72"" LED 3D TV.

They would go to the movie theater.  And pay.
Full price.
and not bitch.
At all.


But then some of us would have no hobbies.

And be forced to be contributing members of the Gene Pool.

Perish the thought."
,amitron45,2011-08-07T17:19Z,"Better yet convert the file using Bittorrent. Then use freemake video converter to convert the file into an MP4 format. Upload the file to your Flash Drive, stick the drive in your PS3, upload the file to your PS3. There u go, a movie that u don't have to put on DVD, unless u want to and that u r able to look at without being blocked by anything."
,no_name_3,2011-08-09T01:27Z,"Thanks for the upload.

I personally don't have problems with a big of camera shake every now and then, just sucks when the video is out of focus for 5-10 minutes."

,DirtyLogic,2011-08-20T06:15Z,"@amitron45

Why do you say better yet as if your process is somehow easier than getting off your ass and plugging the laptop into the television?  =P"
,Darkforge317,2011-08-28T09:09Z,"I think it's funny how in the movie the actor is like ""I brought a video camera in the movies and recorded that shit."" and the guy recording is probably like ""umm... o.o"""
,yobar23,2011-08-29T21:49Z,"Thanks for the efforts, TvT.

As for playback, I just burn a few of these flics to a DVD and drop that into my Samsung Bluray player, which loves all sorts of computer files, then we enjoy them on the big screen in our comfy chairs"
,AidyD,2011-08-31T18:04Z,"Or just plug pc into hdtv for one off movies that have cinivia.

Takes 2 secs. Rather than blow aload of money on a dying console like 360..

,spaceballz2010,2011-09-08T00:05Z,"i watched this a month or so ago and it was bad filming by the other uploader but this movie is the shit so i seeded it for a while and still would watch it again, SO FUNNY"
,BeenGamingLongerThanYou,2011-09-12T05:17Z,"Will you complete douchebags not turn a torrent listing into a console war, wtf, get a life you damn losers.  Douchebags.  Go suck some dicks to make the money for both.  "
,playballdr,2011-09-20T16:02Z,"does anyone know a broker, i need to straighten my portfolio.  lost a bundle from oil futures last quarter and now obama wants to take more taxes from me.  i only make 1.8 million a year.  how can i keep my lifestyle if he does that.  but hey at least i can come here and get free movies.  keep up the great work, lol"
,iammillsy,2011-09-21T03:36Z,You tell em whybitch_itsfree  lol  i just wanted to thank you for the movies
