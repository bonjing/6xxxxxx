 Matthew Guille assembles a hands-on collection of basic and essential molecular and embryological techniques for studying Xenopus and zebrafish. Easily reproducible and designed to succeed, these detailed methods include cellular techniques, techniques for the quantitative and spatial analysis of mRNA and proteins, and techniques for the expression of gene products in embryos. More specialized methods enable users to analyze promoters and transcription factors during early development, and include gel shift assays, as well as in vitro and in vivo footprinting. Molecular Methods in Developmental Biology: Xenopus and Zebrafish affords newcomers rapid access to a wide variety of essential, state-of-the-art techniques in developmental studies, and offers experienced researchers time-saving tips and new techniques from experts who have fine-tuned them for best results.
