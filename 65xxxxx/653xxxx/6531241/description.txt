Quote:
The Revenant is a crime fiction comic book created by Shannon Eric Denton and Keith Giffen. It has been published by Antarctic Press, Komikwerks and Desperado Publishing respectively.

The comic focuses on a mysterious, sadistic crime fighter called The Revenant bent on eliminating the criminal element in the fictitious twin cites of Sapphire City and Jade Harbor. This ghost-like figure may or may not be a reputed gangster who was killed 15 years earlier on during Sapphire City\'s Day of the Dead celebrations.
