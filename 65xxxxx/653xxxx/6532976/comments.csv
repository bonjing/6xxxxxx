,jamzkie,2011-07-12T13:37Z,i highly suggest that u better use AC3 than AAC. AC3 delivers clearer audio when encoded especially in 5.1. AAC is no good when dialogue of actors are delivered in the film. 
[T],MitZep,2011-07-12T16:45Z,"@muk i will keep that in mind..
@jamzkie k i wil try your suggestion.."
