,xjd77,2012-01-20T15:25Z,First of all I'd like to thank ajaxen94 for uploading this. However I must point out that this is a TV rip and not a DVD rip. The quality is great and the adverts have been removed. I already had a TV rip of this and was actually looking for a DVD rip without adverts. Just thought I'd point this out in case like me you wanted to replace a TV rip. Still a great movie and upload by ajaxen94.
