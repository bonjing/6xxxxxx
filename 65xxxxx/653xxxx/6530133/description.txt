Michael Land et alii*: The Secret of Monkey Island (monophony EP)

13 minutes of painful nostalgia! By popular request I recorded the PC speaker version to present it here. It's true PC speaker music, no emulators have been used. Click here if you dare to download this â€œmonophony EPâ€! If you're not able to handle torrent files, please contact me for a direct download link.

Another very interesting place to look for Monkey Island soundtracks is the Soundtrack Island. It hosts - among others - a Roland MT-32 version and an Amiga version of â€œThe Secret of Monkey Islandâ€.
