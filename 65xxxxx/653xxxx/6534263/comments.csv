Once Upon a Time in the West 720p BRrip
TLOTR Extended Cut 1080p BRrip "
[T],murdoc47,2011-07-18T00:39Z,"i already uploaded once upon a time in the west in 1080p and in 720p. i don't like stardust and i never watched the LOTR. sorry, i'm not really into fantasy. but i like drama."
,CosmAvngr,2011-08-08T18:16Z,"How about Barry Lyndon? 

The only BluRay version I see are 10GB plus.

I know it is a long movie, but 720p 5GB must be reasonable.

I have a 60GB/month cap so 10GB movies are out of the question for me. "
[T],murdoc47,2011-08-08T22:55Z,"i already uploaded barry lyndon, but something screwed up the title.

it is a great movie and i just had to rip it. it is 3.23 GB. enjoy!"
,CosmAvngr,2011-08-09T04:28Z,"Thanks on Barry Lyndon and nice size.

Though I am too close to cap now (2 weeks and 7GB left) and it looks kind of dead anyway. "
[T],murdoc47,2011-08-09T19:06Z,i am personally seeding with unlimited DL/UL. so (everybody) please contribute! thanks
[T],murdoc47,2011-08-10T10:02Z,"uploaded barry lyndon again, with the correct title. seeding it right now."
,CosmAvngr,2011-08-10T19:33Z,"My thanks yet again. Though I really can't DL until my cap rolls over, I am even avoiding youtube right now to conserve BW.
