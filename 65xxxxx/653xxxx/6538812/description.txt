Synopsis:

Walt Disney Animation Studios returns to the Hundred Acre Wood with "Winnie the Pooh." Featuring the timeless charm, wit and whimsy of the original featurettes, this all-new movie reunites audiences with the philosophical "bear of very little brain" and friends Tigger, Rabbit, Piglet, Owl, Kanga, Roo--and last, but certainly not least, Eeyore, who has lost his tail. "Ever have one of those days where you just can't win, Eeyore?" asks Pooh. Owl sends the whole gang on a wild quest to save Christopher Robin from an imaginary culprit. It turns out to be a very busy day for a bear who simply set out to find some honey. Inspired by three stories from A.A. Milne's books in Disney's classic, hand-drawn art style, "Winnie the Pooh" hits theaters in Europe and Latin America in Spring 2011; the U.S. release date is July 15, 2011.
