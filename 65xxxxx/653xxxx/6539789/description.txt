*Extra note for the blind & lazy* This has two audio streams, both the original Chinese and a dubbed English version. The Chinese will play by default (as I prefer to watch it with the subtitles and original audio to the corny English in the dub). If your media player won't let you select which stream, use a better one. I recommend Media Player Classic Home Cinema, VLC or SMPlayer.
