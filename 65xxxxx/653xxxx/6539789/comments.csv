,keerochee,2011-07-14T13:20Z,what do you mean dual audio? tnx for the rip.
,PsychoLogic,2011-07-15T01:42Z,I mean there is 2 x audio streams in the file. A decent media player should allow you to select which one in much the same way as you would with subtitles. See the note at the top of the description :P
,keerochee,2011-07-15T07:57Z,"hope this will play in HDTV with english audio. can you rip smokin' aces 2006, the ten commandments 1956, ben hur 1959, spartacus 1960, first knight, robin hood: prince of thieves 1991 and thor: tales of asgard? know it is too much, just asking if you can. it will be great coz most rippers out there dont rip classic and nice movies, just the new ones. thanks again for the great rips."
,keerochee,2011-07-15T15:36Z,thanks! it plays great in HDTV. just changed the settings to language 2.
