Similar in style to The Twilight Zone with more science fiction than fantasy stories, The Outer Limits is an anthology of distinct story 

episodes, sometimes with a plot twist at the end. Unlike the original incarnation of the series, which was a pure anthology with each 

episode completely unrelated to the others, the revival series maintained an anthology format, but occasionally featured recurring story 

elements that were often tied together during season-finale clip shows.
