,TheAbstruseOne,2011-10-08T16:36Z,"The DVDs for Season 3-7 were censored (read the Amazon reviews), while 1-2 were uncensored (save for a few episodes in the S2 set). The reason was that two different companies released the DVDs. One used the original uncensored versions, while the other used the syndicated, censored versions."
