this is the auto uploader from my previous upload but this one is pre-modded
it has he following mods installed:
modloader
GuiAPI0
Audio mod
portals mod
singleplayercommands
worldedit
toomanyitems
CCTV mod
Bookschelf mod
spawner GUI

and some other mods that aren't installed but can be fun are included too...

also you can (of course mod yourself -if u know how-) change the skin and texture of minecraft by going to:
library/application support/minecraft/bin/minecraft.jar
for skin adjust inside the "mob" file the "char.png" file make sure its a png file when you're done with it.... otherwise it will crash

and for texture just search for terrain.png and adjust it same story make sure its a png otherwise it will crash

if you have a black screen your java is not up-to-date OR your computer lets minecraft use older versions of java to solve this problem go to "minecraftsp" show package contents/contents and then edit info.plist with texteditor or some other program...   anyways...   adjust (in rule number 53) "<string> ... </string>" to "<string>1.5+</string>" 
that should do the trick

still having any problems? ask away ;p
I will help you ASAP
