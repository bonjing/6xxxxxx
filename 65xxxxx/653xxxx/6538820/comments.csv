,ClassZero,2011-07-14T04:15Z,"An awesome moron. You didn't do fuck all either asswipe. Only a fucktard who claim he did someone else's work and be stupid enough to put lame shite like THEKARATYCHICKEN in a torrent name.

Everything you shared awesome idiot has been uploaded. Use the search stoopid."
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-07-14T14:44Z,"I had 2 accounts, I was temp. banned now I am back on this account -THEKARATYCHICKEN IS STILL BANNED- bringing you stuff to make life easier and your whining go fuck yourself"
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-07-14T20:17Z,"and btw I don't see any pre-modded minecraft for mac 1.7.3 around except mine .... 
(it doesn't update the mods too, you need to backup your saves and delete the whole minecraft folder inside library/applications support then lauch app and it will re-download)"
,memphist,2011-07-16T22:37Z,"What the fuck is up your arse Zeroclass.  Leave  this guy alone!  as he said ""bringing you stuff to make life easier"" abd you pick on him.  Would love to me you asrewhip... NOW FUCK OFF! "
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-07-20T10:33Z,@memphist thx again :P this dude is trollin all my stuff :(  but you naild him!
,DeathOfJack,2011-07-25T00:32Z,"I'm new to this whole modding thing, could you potentially tell me how to activate the mods or input them into the game? Would be much appreciated - Jack"
,DeathOfJack,2011-07-25T20:23Z,"I restarted my mac laptop to see if it was due to the fact that I had other versions of Minecraft torrents (Modless) but it still doesn't seem to have the mods built in, do I have to apply them myself? If so how? I click on the Mod/Texture Pack menu slot, then go to open folder, and nothing happens.. Please help, I've searched for a good two and a half weeks for something like this and I'm quite disappointed with myself that this didn't work for me. The game itself works fine, the mods seem ineffective. (I mainly want to use the Toomanyitems mod.. - Jack"
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-07-27T11:42Z,"@DeathOfJack hey what you should try is to delete every thing in side this folder: YOUR COMPUTER NAME/Library/aplication support/minecraft EXEPT SAVES so you delete the bin folder resources etc. then drag and drop the saves out that folder (if you wanna keep your saves if not, just delete all) now you have a folder downloaded called ""minecraft"" this represents the folder from application support... open both up and drag and drop all the content (the folders...) from the downloaded minecraft to the minecraft you already had IF YOU DIDN""T HAVE A MINECRAFT FOLDER JUST DRAG AND DROP THE WHOLE DOWNLOADED MINECRAFT FOLDER IN APPLICATION SUPPORT now go back to minecraft auto updater 1.7.3 auto updater and drag and drop the minecraft icon to your applications

you see a folder called mods -you don't need those- they are just extra mods for peeps who know how to install them....

have a nice day, greetz The Karaty Chicken"
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-07-27T11:45Z,I will make a video on how to install this ... only problem I can't upload for 3 weeks -holiday-
,DeathOfJack,2011-07-28T22:42Z,"Ah okay, well that was all a bit confusing, so if possible could you mail me the link to the video once you have done it or a (No offence) easier description of the tutorial you have written to me (EssenceoftheCurse@hotmail.com). I'm so sorry to be a pain but I'm really looking forward to playing with mods for once :]

Once again, sincerest apologies.

- Jack"
,DeathOfJack,2011-07-30T17:13Z,"So sorry, I mean .co.uk

,TheMadHat,2011-08-04T21:05Z,"Okay well i want to put in some new texture packs but every time i add one and i go to the title screen and click ""Mods and texture packs"" it just gives me a blank screen. what do i do. (game works 100% perfectly btw except for those parts) and also if i add new mods the same thing happens except i cant go to the title screen and have to re-download it. Please help "
,TheMadHat,2011-08-04T21:23Z,"Also can i play online, if so then how?"
,TheMadHat,2011-08-12T20:25Z,nvm found out that with some texture packs it will give a blank screen but i fixed it. However how do i play multiplayer?
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-08-17T10:57Z,"@TheMadHat hey great you found the texturing stuff out yourself... if you want to play online you could use hamachi, tough I don't understand hamachi at all... there are 100000+ vids on youtube for that =) and if you find a cracked server you can just fill in the IP and you can play online, simple as that "
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-08-17T11:04Z,"@TheMadHat and when adding new mods you should be careful, some mods can't be installed at the same time otherwise minecraft will crash. if this isn't your problem it could be that minecraft is using an older version of java which some mods don't support... good luck, if there are any problems I answer as soon as possible"
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-08-17T11:13Z,"this is for example a cracked server... have fun

quote from 'NORWAYFREAK'

""hamachi id.. NORWAYFREAK
PASS: 1234

SERVER ID: 5.159.106.84

but its only up when i play or have the mac on..""

thx to NORWAYFREAK for being awesome enough to share his server"
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-08-20T22:14Z,"@DeathOfJack hey very simple.... 
1.just go to HOME/library/application support/minecraft and drag your saves out (to desktop) 
2.then drag the downloaded ""minecraft"" folder into HOME/library/applications support 
3.drag your saves back in (same place as #1)
4.drag the app (the minecraft logo with the title ""minecraftsp"" to your programs 
5.it should work"
,latroo,2011-08-25T16:58Z,do you still need to install the mods?
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-08-26T19:38Z,"yes and no.... you just have to drag the minecraft folder into home/library/applications support and drag the program ""minecraftsp"" into your programs if you don't know what you're doing ignore the rest"
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-08-26T19:39Z,"though you fist should drag out your saves....

(HOME/library/application support/minecraft) "
,porky2017,2011-09-01T23:59Z,"I have been trying to mod my daughters minecraft for weeks to no avail-finaly found this,you are a life saver & I am in the good books with my daughter-

,porky2017,2011-09-02T00:02Z,"Is there a mo creatures zombies or creepers mod or something,

kind regards:porky2017."
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-09-02T00:27Z,"@porky2017 what mods do you wish to be installed?
If you would email me all the mods (in a text file or something - links are appreciated - but its not really necessary :] ) 

my Email = Dontuspammenow@hotmail.com

though I could teach you how to mod 2... its not that hard...

BTW IF ANYONE ELSE WANTS DIFFRENT MODS ASK AWAY!!!    ...I am bored anyway...."
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-09-06T20:54Z,"Hey, 5 steps....

1) drag out your saves.... (can be found by going to: HOME/library/application support/minecraft)

2) delete the minecraft folder (where you just dragged your saves out)

3) replace the folder with the ""minecraft"" folder you downloaded from me (so place the folder at HOME/library/application support)

4) place ""minecraftSP"" inside your applications

5) see if its working and leave the rest, if you don't know what you're doing ;]"
