2011 - Demolished Thoughts

Unlike Sonic Youth's snotty noise rock/pop offerings, Thurston Moore's new solo album sounds more sedate and folk defined. On this song oriented album he plays mainly acoustic guitar, polished up with some orchestral instrumentations. Endings of "Circulation" or "Orchard Street" recall memories of Glenn Branca as well. He, in any case, took deep influence on Sonic Youth's early musical history, primarily by his epic and uncompromising guitar symphonies.

Produced by Beck Hansen (aka Beck), one of the most praised alternative rock representatives between 1990 and 2000.
 
iTunes Bonus Track "This Train Is Bound For Glory" in AAC format included.
