[Notes]

The self produced album of 12 songs features two new unreleased songs called
2nd Street , and Better Off Without You , as well as the final recordings of
the original lineup with former guitarist Tommy Skeoch from 2005. The aptly
titled album is not only called TWISTED WIRES & the acoustic sessions... for
the way Tesla has always seemed to seamlessly blend acoustic and electric
guitar sounds in their music, but is also descriptive of the bands
continuous and tumultuous ride over the past 25 years, overcoming the ups
and downs of rock and roll. From the band that sparked the unplugged craze
of the 90s with 5 Man Acoustic Jam , and the radical electric guitar riffs
of Modern Day Cowboy featured on the latest Guitar Hero game, now comes
TWISTED WIRES & the acoustic sessions... a creative mix of past and present,
as well as a classic rendition of Climax Blues Bands I Love You which so
happens to be the first song TESLA recorded together after reuniting from a
painful 5 year break up. Take a spin of the new disc by TESLA and enjoy the
celebration of 25 years with America s gritty blue collar band of survivors
who still rock today, and will for another 25 years!
