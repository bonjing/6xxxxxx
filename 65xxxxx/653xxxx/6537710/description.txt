How the States Got Their Shapes
We take the shapes of our states for granted, but the map of America could have looked very different. Ever heard of Chicago, Wisconsin? Why is Texas so big that you'd better not mess with it? And what ever happened to the state of Jefferson?How the States Got Their Shapes is a great dvd! It tells the story of how our nation formed geographically -- how it added states and how their borders changed. For instance, did you know there was a state named Franklin for 4 years? Or that Texas had to lose some of its northern border to remain a slave-holding state prior to the civil war? Or that the Louisiana Purchase happened because the Haitians rebelled against the French? There is so much more! This is history that just isn't found in our kids' history books anymore.
In HOW THE STATES GOT THEIR SHAPES, Brian Unger hits the road to uncover the history hidden in our map. From the crooked borders in the east to the organized boxes in the west, the shapes of the states are more than simple geography. Every line on the map of America is a surprising clue that reveals how the 13 colonies became the 50 states and how an intrepid group of settlers and immigrants built a new nation. The same forces that shaped our states still influence us today--how we eat, speak, vote, pray and play. From the Atlantic to the Pacific, the nation's capital to your own backyard, HOW THE STATES GOT THEIR SHAPES will uncover the history you never knew about the places you know best.
