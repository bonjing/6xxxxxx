The End of Poverty - 2008 by Philippe Diaz - DVDRip / Xvid / MP3
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903943/

"A phenomenal discourse on why poverty exists when there is so much wealth in the world. A must see for anyone wanting to understand not only the US economic system but the foundations of today's global economy."

It's not great / arty cinema, but pretty interesting information about history, politics & economy... enjoy :)
