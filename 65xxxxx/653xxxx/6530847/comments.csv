,netrek,2011-07-28T12:42Z,Is this the censored version or the uncensored which shows nudity?
,quual,2011-08-31T04:42Z,"Season 1 - Uncensored, Season 2-6 Censored."
,quual,2011-08-31T04:43Z,"Season 1 episodes are uncensored, however seasons 2-6 are censored."
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2011-10-01T11:51Z,I think y'all are wrong about season 2 being censored.  I just saw boobies at the end of the second episode of season 2.  Censorship is not going to be a big deal with this show though.  Despite not being censored 90% of the episodes of season 1 could have been put on network TV just the way they were.  The majority of episodes that aired on Showtime had no nudity or adult language to begin with so even though some of the seasons are censored there really wasn't much to censor.
,dark_illusions,2011-10-02T05:47Z,yall are sick ppl honestally who cares if its censored its a tv show not porn u want to see nuditiy go download porn not the outer limits ffs
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2011-10-02T06:08Z,"dark_illusions, I agree with you for the most part.  But there are times when something has to be so heavily censored that it messes it up.  For instance, if you've got a scene in a strip club the whole thing might have to be cut and then the story might be made confusing with it missing.  Or maybe you've got a lot of mob types sitting around dropping the F bomb with every other word they say.  That might have to be completely removed as well.  I think that's the sort of thing people might be concerned about.

But luckily it really doesn't matter with this particular series.  Even when uncut there was hardly any adult language or nudity anyway so barely anything had to be removed."
