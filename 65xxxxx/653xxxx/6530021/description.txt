Constance: The Tragic and Scandalous Life of Mrs. Oscar Wilde

From BBC Radio 4. Written by Franny Moyle; Read by Rachel Atkins; Abridged by Libby Spurrier.

Constance was a shy child with a bullying mother. After the death of her father she escapes to live with her grandfather and blossoms into a confident, outgoing young woman.

In the spring of 1895 the life of Constance Wilde changed irrevocably.

Up until the conviction of her husband, Oscar, for homosexual crimes, she had held a privileged position in society. Part of a gilded couple, she was a popular children's author, a fashion icon, and a leading campaigner for women's rights. A founding member of the magical society the Golden Dawn, her pioneering and questioning spirit encouraged her to sample some of the more controversial aspects of her time. Mrs Oscar Wilde was a phenomenon in her own right.

But that spring Constance's entire life was eclipsed by scandal. Forced to flee to the Continent with her two sons, her glittering literary and political career ended abruptly. Having changed her name, she lived in exile until her death.
