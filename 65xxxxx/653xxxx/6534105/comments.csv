,Mike_08,2011-07-28T18:56Z,"Downloaded the other torrent to trial TP2 before upgrading but this one works way better with no warning messages on start up.

The only bit that is disappointing is the shortcut icon...

Great torrent A1! "

,rava2oo7,2011-09-15T20:43Z,does this have or need a serial ?
,nt74,2011-09-18T12:50Z,No need for a serial its already k'd. If you want the scratch function then simply replace the Traktor.app with the one included in the dmg file.
