Islamophobia can only be defeated with knowledge.
Thank you TvTeam! :)"

Actually, THE MORE one reads the Unholy Quran, THE MORE intelligent people find it a backward, stupid, ignorant concoction by an illiterate delusional camel-shagger to convert and rule over peasants and bedouins. Imagine the titles: sura The Cow, etc. How bloody RIDICULOUS !  "

It was created by Vatican in order to destroy east part of the church get people to struggle and hate each other on the east for the centuries ! For 1500 years we have fight between Orthodox Church and Islam .Who benefit on it ? Vatican and west of course. When people will realize it ? Never. Just look at the east .Most of the countries are in the chaos for centuries , countries that have everything except brains because they have too many primitive religious idiots . "

      If you guys think that Islam is a ralegon of the runes then you guys must have been watching to much of CNN or FOX news 
Give Islam a chance. I have.

ps. if you hate the relegeon Islam (thinking about 9/11) you don't have to comment about like you are paranoid of it.Watch the ARIVALS doc."
