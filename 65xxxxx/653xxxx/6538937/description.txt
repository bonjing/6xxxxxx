Introduction

The main reason I made this was to combat porn threads by giving those who want to fap, a whole collection of porn that would normally be on /vp/. I don't care how you use it, hell, post it on /vp/. But it's probably a better idea to just fap to yourself anyways. Please share the /rs/ link in porn threads.

                                   SHARING IS CARING!

FAQ

Q: Something is in the wrong place!
A: Don't panic, drop an email and I'll get it fixed right away. Simply send the name of the file in the email, and I'll take care of it.

Q: Why is there so much shit in this?
A: I've made an attempt to get rid of all the REALLY bad art. If you were in my position, you would know that this is the creme de la crop. It's fucking Pokeporn and 99% of it is shit. I've had to go through thousands of pictures just for this. When you have seen that many, you'll know the truth.

Q: Why is there a lot of X pokemon/character compared to Y pokemon/character?
A: Some pokemon/characters just don't have that much porn. Sorry bro.

Q: Can I have some of your real contact info?
A: No. I check my emails often. Use that.

Q: What's your waifu?
A: Blaziken. Hnngh.

Q: Gary? Posting porn?
A: Yes, it's called irony.

Q: What can I do to help?
A: A thank you and a .7z of all of your pokeporn onwould be nice.

Useful Tools

7-Zip: Better than WinRAR/zip and FREE!
Link: http://www.7-zip.org/

uTorrent: Piracy ahoy! Also, a neat tool for fast legit downloads too! I recommend the v2.X, though v3.0 works fine too.

4chanX: A userscript that has more support than 4chan Plus (Which is dead in the water right now) It requires greasemonkey on Firefox/Nightly, and Chrome/ium users can install it right away.
