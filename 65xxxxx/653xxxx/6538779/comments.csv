Thanks for the effort though KARATYCHICKEN.

,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-07-27T11:28Z,@aka_akira srry to hear that maybe your download took to long or something wich caused that your download was corrupt... :( I have had it twice (not with my own) and the 3rd time it worked.... so don't give up!
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-07-27T11:31Z,"hey srry guys I'll not be seeding for 3 weeks though there are more seeders than just me -22 it sais now- :) just to let you know. when I get back I will be seeding again 

my ratio on this torrent is 40.6 right now so don't be afraid I'll be back =D"
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-08-17T10:53Z,Im seeding again :)
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-08-21T20:25Z,@aka_akira hey I've bin thinking maybe I could upload the file on mega-upload or something like that and then you download it directly? message me back if you want to try.... (I don't have your email so srry if you already have it or something...)
[T],CheckOutEr,2011-08-27T11:36Z,"@ KARATYCHICKEN


Please, be so kind & tell me what's 

the PROGRAM THAT WAS USED TO CREATE THE ARCHIVE, 

because the best archive extractors are giving me these errors:

7-zip : Unsupported compression method.

WinRAR: The archive is corrupt.

WinZip: Error: Central directory not found.

In 99% of these cases it means that the archive contains incorrect headers.

Other ZIP programs can open some archives with incorrect headers,

since these programs just ignore errors. Thanks for this great upload anyway!

I don't want to say anything bad about this torrent, 

I just want to fix that problem to help out ""aka_akira"" & other guys

who'll have the same problems after downloading this Torrent.


NOTE: My Download was perfect. I have deleted the torrent file, downloaded it again,

used as download directory ""the same directory"" & checked all the files for many times (100%).

Best regards, CheckOutEr.

,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-08-27T18:18Z,"@CheckOutEr hi, thx for trying to help... I used archive-utility from apple every mac has it build in. I don't know how it could give errors.... :[ it never caused any before so I'm dazzled.... I know for sure this should work on a mac... and for windows it should work without any bullshit... though, I could compress it otherwise (.rar or .zip by ""the unarchiver"") and upload it again or mail you/post an other link... (mega-upload or 2shared etc. )"
[T],CheckOutEr,2011-08-28T00:20Z,"""KARATYCHICKEN"", thanks mate! 

It would be gr8 if it is possible to you to reupload ""Cinema 4D R12 all modules MAC/WINDOWS KARATYCHICKEN"" Torrent without compressing anything. I know that it's size will be bigger & you and other seeders should then upload more, but from the other side it'll be very comfortable, because then downloaders can download everything that they need by unchecking files that they don't need. For example Macintosh users could be able to uncheck ""Cinema 4D modules"" for Windows etc.
I give U +3, just because I trust you littlebit 
( :D ), ""KARATYCHICKEN"".

Thanks a Lot Again! ^_^"
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-08-29T16:38Z,haha no problem -sigh- :D (sigh because I am tired :[ ) keep your eyes open on this page... I'll post the link...
