,daltron101,2011-07-17T02:46Z,This is a legit copy. A:10 V:10 M:? haven't watched it all the way through. Just a few minutes to see how it played. I don't think It is being traced either. didn't find any viruses or anything : ) Thanks a ton ltt99. 1080p at such a small file size is awesome. 
,daltron101,2011-07-17T12:42Z,"ok, The movie is a 9/10. I loved it. One of the first in a while that had a really decent ending. Maybe there will be a part two in the future? who knows... I suggest you DL this right away. Thanks again ltt99"

however I can't get this to play with out skipping and shuddering on a 2.2 core duo / 4 g ram, no other process... =("
,dimuthu44,2011-07-23T18:57Z,"@WhyteDem0n: its because its on low bitrate you see this in 2GB.
Don't criticise unless you see it.
This is really decent 1080p rip. Thanks LTT."
