now lets get the seeder count up!!!"
,VitualWorld,2011-07-17T13:35Z,"Glad I can help people :)
And I don't think the seed counter works.. In BitTorrent it says the availability is 7.. so that makes it 7 seeders right?"
,everlasting_griffin,2012-01-23T20:02Z,"Dear Virtual World,
Thank you so much for giving yourself and volunteering your efforts, determination, energy, heart, expertise in uploading the Harry Potter Extras. It means so much to us all...(The Harry Potter generation that is!)... especially with Post potter depression being at the peak. Really looking forward to the rest of the Extras. Hope you'll take some time off and upload them. Take care and God Bless."
