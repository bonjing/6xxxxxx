Release info:

'Sound Surfers' is the first release of newly established record label 'Unlimited Music'.

Based in Russia Unlimited Music was founded by no one else but Fungus Funk aka Sergio Prilepa.

His name was at the forefront of Russian psychedelic sound for the last 10 years and now Sergio decided to give his support for local and international artists by releasing cutting edge psychedelic sound on his new label.

Preparing this CD, Sergio was surfing on the waves of modern morning sound, searching for the freshest and most rocking tunes that give unlimited joy to the dance floors. And what a result he achieved! 50 percent of 'Sound Surfers' consists of tracks produced by Russian artists, both uprising like Artsence, Lyric and Neospherix as well as already established stars like Fungus Funk himself and a remake of 'Letite' from RadioTrance. For the remix Ultrarech teamed up with magnificent Miss YoYo and together they put a fresh breath into this legendary anthem. The international psytrance scene is represented here by such masters as Alternative Control, M-Klome and Neuromotor. Also promising new producers from South Africa, Shockwave and Zezia appear here with their debut international releases.
