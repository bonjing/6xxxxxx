,vivatpb5776,2011-07-13T19:45Z,"I believe this IS the 2011 BRRip. Please take note of the running times:

Per Wiki, the running times for all three movies listed match what appears on their website:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Two_Towers

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Return_of_the_King

The imdb running times match as well (the Return of the King imdb information is not updated). PetaFOX, please confirm."
,vivatpb5776,2011-07-13T19:55Z,As to the quality...spot on. I already have the 720p version and I compared my version to this version and they are identical. I am not sure about the subtitles but I only QC'd a portion of the movie. Thank you uploader.

,omegadonkey,2011-08-06T19:13Z,"Is there a forum? I need to learn how to convert and burn to disks and about what all this stuff means. IE Mkv,brrip,aac,avi, ect."
,Jona198102,2011-08-21T20:59Z,"PetaFOX:

Thank you for this quality rip! 

I don't know what it is about these 3 movies - poor-quality rips, out-of-sync/low bitrate audio, choppy video, etc. I don't know why people can't simply do a quality rip like you have done here. I'm not sure why these 3 movies are different than any others.

Anyway, thank you again!

This is like the One Rip to Rule Them All. Perfect blend of size, quality, and audio.

Love it man. Love it!

,osriccc,2012-05-27T21:57Z,Please tell me if this has the credits included? Seems to be the perfect rip but there are lots of Extended rips out there that have the credits cut off being an important part of the Extended Editions of this trilogy. PLEASE TELL ME!!
