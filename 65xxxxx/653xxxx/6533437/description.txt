Idris Elba returns as John Luther, the near-genius 
detective struggling with his own demons.

Devastated by the brutal murder of his wife, John 
Luther returns to policing in a different world. After 
Zoe's death and best friend Ian Reed's betrayal, Luther 
spent some time working on cold cases.

Now he's back. His old unit has gone and he's working in 
the newly created Serious and Serial unit. Headed by former 
police complaints officer Martin Schenk (Dermot Crowley), it 
is Luther's chance for a fresh start. But is it one he 
really wants?

Luther quickly gathers together his team, rescuing his old 
partner Detective Justin Ripley (Warren Brown) from career 
oblivion. Joining them is ambitious Detective Erin Gray 
(Nikki Amuka-Bird). She's heard of Luther's reputation, 
seen what's happened to Ripley and doesn't want her own 
job prospects tarnished in the same way.

It's not long before they're dealing with their first case. 
A masked man wanders the streets of London, carrying out 
ritualistic murders in historic locations - Smithfield, 
Petticoat Lane... He's taking Luther on a tour through 
the narrow alleyways and back streets of the city, 
using murders to mark out his territory and working 
up to one final masterpiece..
