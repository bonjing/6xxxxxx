I am the author of this torrent, and will continue to seed but keep in mind my connection has poor upload speeds.

If anyone has a copy of the teachers soln manual and wants to combine them that would be cool.

I removed the drm on this pdf so i could put it on my ereader / laptop  hope you guys like it."
