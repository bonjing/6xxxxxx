,CarnageHeart,2011-09-21T00:45Z,"People are so fucking dumb. The ""virus"" is a false positive. All the AV companies have been adding game cracks to their shit to attempt to stop piracy."

Download Daemon tools lite or pro. And mount the .iso with that program. on't burn it, it takes too long and its a waste of disks. One it is mounted it will launch like a CD, just click""Launch Autorun"" or ""Launch Setup"" when it pops up. Then accept and agree the license terms. Let it install. Once it is completely installed, you have to copy the crack that came with the torrent, and paste it in your game directory. C:/Programfiles/Rockstargames/GTA:SA

Launch the game and enjoy.

Don't forget IV:San andreas is out, and looks amazing. If you want the San Andreas exprience with better graphics and physics download it. Search for AndReAGE in any browser."
,OpiumStoned,2011-11-02T00:21Z,"And thank you rjaa for this very nice torrent.

Quick, easy and works perfectly.

You need a little green skull, it's time you step up!"
