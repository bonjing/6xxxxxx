,fenque,2011-07-31T01:51Z,Thanks for this upload. If you (or some one) uploads this in 720p I'll seed for a long time.

Last I had looked for Treme 1080p torrents, I found at least a couple of 720p copies floating around on here and/or I!S@O#HzUxNcT (sorry folks, this name is censored by TBP), but that wasn't what I was looking for."
,matriarchies,2011-08-09T21:07Z,"I've uploaded this 1.971 times, but no one seems to care about seeding.  Just now I watched as 5 peers went from 99.98% to 100% after I removed my upload speed limit for a few minutes.

I should stop seeding for a couple weeks or months.  If you can't find complete copies, you can blame those 5 people who definitely reached 100% but never stuck around to seed."
