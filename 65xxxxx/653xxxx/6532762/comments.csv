,Huntzberger,2011-09-27T14:52Z,"thanks for the upload. i am having problems getting Extreme and my HD PVR to work. Extreme says device is either unavailable or being used by another application - which, of course, it isn't.
sometimes it displays HD PVR as source, sometimes it doesn't. it currently won't let me refresh. i am stuck. help please!"
