 Your Complete Example-Rich Guide to Using and Extending LINQ to Objects and PLINQ

 Using LINQ to Objects, .NET developers can write queries over object collections with the same deep functionality that was once available only with SQL and relational databases. Now, for the first time, developers have a comprehensive and authoritative guide to applying LINQ to Objects in real-world software. Microsoft MVP Troy Magennis introduces state-of-the-art techniques for working with in-memory collections more elegantly and efficientlyâ€”and writing code that is exceptionally powerful, robust, and flexible. 

 Drawing on his unsurpassed experience coding software using LINQ and hosting the popular HookedOnLINQ.com site, Magennis presents timely, realistic solutions to a wide spectrum of development challenges, such as combining data from multiple sources, and achieving optimal performance with extremely large sets of data. Youâ€™ll begin with brief quick-starts that walk you through LINQ to Objectsâ€™ key features and query syntax. Next, youâ€™ll drill down to detailed techniques for applying and extending these features with C# 4.0 and C# 3.0â€”including code examples that reflect the realities of production development.

 Coverage includes 
 â€¢ Writing basic LINQ queries with C#: filtering, projecting, and sorting data from in-memory collections
 â€¢ Mastering advanced techniques for grouping and joining data and understanding the performance implications of each technique
 â€¢ Taking full advantage of LINQâ€™s standard query operators 
 â€¢ Creating custom query operators that follow best practices for coding patterns and error handling
 â€¢ Writing more fluent, readable LINQ queries with C# 4.0â€™s language enhancements, including the new dynamic features
 â€¢ Combining LINQ with COM-Interop to access data sources such as Microsoft Excel
 â€¢ Using Parallel LINQ to Objects (PLINQ) to optimize queries for multi-core processors, and how to build custom parallel query operators
 â€¢ Integrating the best LINQ to Objects patterns into your day-to-day coding
