Thanks to JellyHead0012!

In this torrent you will find the movie in a 1.88 GB XviD AVI with all DVD extras, including a 45 minute interview with Simon and Raja.  The DVD had only a 2 channel stereo audio track, but it is high bitrate and sounds great!

 As an artist, it's always good to challenge yourself... and the
 thought of translating all the complex layers in a shpongle    
 album into a live show with a band gave me a panic attack and 
 still does! Some songs we couldn't even find, as they were     
 done on old computers that have long been obsolete, soaking up 
 water under a leaky roof in my garage. Pretty early on I       
 realized the secret would be to bring in musicians far better  
 than ourselves and lots of them! Two weeks before the show the 
 band had never even met each other, even though I had recorded 
 some of them individually in my studio for previous Shpongle   
 albums. Pixel Addicts took care of the lights, showing me      
 complicated diagrams on their laptops which I pretended to     
 understand, having no clue how it would actually look on the   
 night. Meanwhile we all rehearsed in a darkened room, with no  
 air or daylight, getting to know each other by smell alone and 
 perhaps sound. Reams of manuscript paper littered the floor,   
 everyone wore ear plugs, and all I could think was 'What the   
 hell am I doing?'. It is a testament to their talent, hard     
 work and skill that you are not holding a blank DVD in your    
 hands right now. We didn't know if we would ever repeat the    
 performance, so recorded it for posterity... Surely only an    
 idiot would actually release their first ever gig though,      
 right?  We hope you like it, it was made with love, sweat       
 and laughter...
