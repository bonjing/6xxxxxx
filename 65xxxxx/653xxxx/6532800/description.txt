Ripped from the new live stream from Glenn Beck's web site. I have edited out the  
music played during the commercial breaks.

Notes: Glenn is back and live from Israel today.  I've listened to the first hour and so far it sounds like we've missed the Casey Anthony distraction, thankfully.

Either due to his vacation and getting back into the saddle, or due to being in Israel there are a couple of bumps in the road around the commecials - I left them in for your amusement.  :)
