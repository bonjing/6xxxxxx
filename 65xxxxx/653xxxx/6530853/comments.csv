Nothing wrong with image or sound quality. Plenty wrong with movie quality; it's shit! Natalie Portman, talentless,  Zionist poster-girl that she is, hams it up as usual while the vastly superior Mila Kunis gets shoved into a supporting role. She outshines Portman at every turn but its not enough to save this preposterous, melodramatic fart of a movie. Avoid."
