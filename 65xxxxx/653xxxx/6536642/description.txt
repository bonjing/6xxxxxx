 Matchmoving has become a standard visual effects procedure for almost every situation where live action materials and CG get combined. It allows virtual and real scenes that have been composited together to seamlessly appear as though they are from the same perspective. This authoritative step-by-step guide from one of the best matchmovers in the business allows you to master this technique that has been called the foundation upon which all VFX work stands. Author Erica Hornung (sr. matchmover for Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, Matrix: Revolutions, and more) imparts her techniques, tips, and wisdom from the trenches that will have you matchmoving like a true professional in no time. 

 Lessons in the most popular matchmoving software (Maya, Boujou, and others) are included, as well as tips and techniques for surveying on set, dolly moves, and operating nodal cameras. Individual chapters dedicated to object and character matchmoves show you how to matchmove for shadow casting, adding weapons and other objects, focusing on center of gravity, as well as complete CG character support.

 The companion DVD includes Quicktime examples of techniques shown in the book, as well as project files that allow you to master these techniques yourself by working alongside the lessons featured in the text.
