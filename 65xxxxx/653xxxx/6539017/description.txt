Album opening with â€˜Time Of My Lifeâ€™ track, intense guitar play on different sound of Brad was good to keep on playing the CD. Something that i really wanted to listen, unique without mainstream repetition. Now comes â€˜*Landing in Londonâ€™ Style song â€˜ When Youâ€™re Youngâ€™ that really was nice to listen till the chorus ruined the expectations. The song itself having variable attitudes, especially in a time when the guitar solo comes up, but soon breaks into the mainstream, having compositions containing the words â€˜already and doneâ€™, canonically cheerful and energetic soon fades out on typical new age rock play.
