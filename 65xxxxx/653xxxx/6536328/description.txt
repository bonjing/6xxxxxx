Dear Brigitte (1965)



Charming comedy with James Stewart, Brigitte Bardot, Billy Mumy, Fabian, Glynis Johns, Ed Wynn, and many others. Released on VHS, but not DVD.

Thought I\'d never find this movie. Maybe you thought so, too.

The waiting is finally over!



Ripped from 1988 VHS, color-corrected and encoded by TheTooleMan, July 2011


Plot:
Professor Leaf (James Stewart), an absent-minded poet with a prejudice against the sciences, is forced to face the fact that his son (Billy Mumy)is a math prodigy with little artistic talent of his own.
