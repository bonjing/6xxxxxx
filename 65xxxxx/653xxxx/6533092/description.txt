 The Individualized Music Therapy Assessment Profile" (IMTAP) is an easy-to-use, reliable, indepth music therapy assessment protocol developed by a team of six experienced music therapists. Designed for use in paediatric and adolescent settings, this multi-level process of assessment provides a clear profile of each client over time. The accompanying CD-ROM allows the therapist to store and refer back to client details, and to create charts and graphs showing progress and areas to work on. The authors cover the assessment process from intake through planning assessment and research to analysis and include accessible sample assessment sessions and examples of activities and interventions. Addressing the lack of a standard tool for assessing music therapy, the "IMTAP" may be used on a variety of levels: as a treatment plan for music therapy work; as a tool to develop goals and objectives; as a means to address and assess targeted skill sets; as an indicator of overall functioning, as a baseline for treatment; as a research method; and, as a communication tool for parents and healthcare professionals. The "IMTAP" yields detailed, easy-to-understand information on client abilities and functioning and identifies effective music therapy strategies for each client, making it an essential tool for students and professionals in the field of music therapy.
