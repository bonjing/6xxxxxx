There are lots of M.U.G.E.N. over the net, but the ones I present here have something peculiar: in all of them it is possible to fight 2 players at the same time, together, against the machine. Yes, a 2 vs 2 simultaneous, what makes them very enjoyable. 

Some of them share characters, some of them are unique. Every M.U.G.E.N. has something that makes it different from the rest. That's why I share all of them.
