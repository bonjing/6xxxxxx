Gregorian chants and dance music rhythms.








Album Review (c/o Amazon)

It's fair to say Le Roi Est Moi... is more of the same. It's got the monks, it's got that woman
talking jibberish ("The first is the father, the second is the mother... and the third is the child"),
and it has that cheesy sounding guy spouting out horse throat meaningless vocals at the top
of his (admiteddly very competent) voice. It's would also be fair to point out that this is the least
'inventive' of all of the Enigma albums. But over-inventiveness often leads to rather inconsistent
wobbly albums, Name one Orbital Album that doesn't have at least a couple of tracks that suffer
from rather crazy obviously untried incoherent musical idea's. Dont get me wrong, I love originallity,
but I also reckon this album doesn't suffer because it offers nothing new. It is pure consistent, typical
Enigma and it is absolutely marvellous. Every track sends you into an almost comatose state of
relaxation of which ime sure is exactly Michael Cretu's aim.

This is an absolute must, 45 minutes of aural bliss if occassionaly a tad corny, but its so good you just wont care.

- Standout tracks -

Beyond The Invisible (Pure quintessential Enigma; monks, woman, horse-throat guy and an awesome mellow melody)

The Child In Us (Such a beautiful tune, one of the finest Enigma tracks ever)

The Roundabout ("I yeh, I yeh.." how hard does that vocal hit you! This song gells soo well)
