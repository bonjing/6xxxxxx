Through light, shadows, and the edge of the frame, I reveal small glimpses of the most beautiful and complex thing. I feel that the human body and especially the female human body is the most beautiful thing in all of the cosmos, at least if it's a human looking at it... I seek to capture that and present it disconnected from the connotations of identity and sexuality, presenting only the aesthetic element. Not all my work is like that, I sometimes make something that's all about who it is, or conveys strong erotic feeling. But for the most part... my nudes are safe to show your grandmother, and I like it that way. Either way I don't want to be sterile, I want to provoke, to stimulate, to inspire. I want the stories to be your stories, your feelings, your expectations.
