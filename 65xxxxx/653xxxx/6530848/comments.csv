,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2011-10-01T11:41Z,"quual, you went and wrote that on all of these torrents but it isn't true.  I checked at Amazon and some of the DVD sets are also edited so these are DVDRips (Additionally, I can tell by the way they look that they are).  Everybody already knows that season 1 isn't censored.  However, I just finished watching episode 2 of the second season and there was a tit shot at the end of it.  One of the reviews at Amazon said that only seasons 3-7 are edited.  But anyway, even for the ones that are censored it isn't going to be a big deal.  Most episodes on Showtime had no or very little cussing and/or nudity anyway."

Don't let the first comment mislead you, this is a DVDRIP with no additional censoring. If you watched season 1 dvdrip by this uploader you know what I mean. "
