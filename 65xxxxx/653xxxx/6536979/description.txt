- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

  From its bright-yellow packaging to the summery pop/rock songs within,
  Sunshine State of Mind is a tribute to We the Kingsâ€™ home state, sort of like
  the Floridian equivalent of the Academy Isâ€™ Fast Times at Barrington High.
  â€œSay You Like Meâ€ flirts with reggae rhythms, â€œEvery Single Dollarâ€ puts a
  Warped Tour spin on 1950s rock & roll, and â€œFriday Is Foreverâ€ barrels forward
  with a sunny, epic sweep, its melody elevated by vocal harmonies and
  overdubbed strings. The lyrics fall into the same prepackaged categories as
  previous albums -- either the girlâ€™s leaving the boy or the boyâ€™s leaving the
  girl, both of which are described with the sort of literary semi-prowess youâ€™d
  find in a high-school lit mag -- and theyâ€™re filled with plenty of wordless
  syllables (whoa, oh, oooh being the most frequent) to maximize their singalong
  potential. The ballads donâ€™t carry nearly as much heft as the faster songs,
  even with the added benefit of S*A*M & Sluggoâ€™s high-sheen production, but We
  the Kings have never been concerned with heft anyway. Sunshine State of Mind
  is a lightweight, breezy album, with just enough melodic mass to keep its
  songs from floating out of listenersâ€™ heads and into the ether.
