What if someone wanted to download just one episode or season of this show, instead of the whole thing?
They won't be able to do that, since you hid all the episodes inside a gigantic RAR file.

Video files are already compressed, there is no point in hiding them inside a RAR file.


If you are smart, you'll delete this torrent, and make a proper one to replace it.

Here is a good example of how to make a proper multi-season TV show torrent:
