Changes in Version 4.01 (2011-05-30)
New:
âœ” Added support for file sizes stored in binary format in TAR archives. Some TAR archives use the binary size format instead of octal for files larger than 8 GB.
Bugs fixed:
âœ” "Repair" command failed to properly reconstruct structure of RAR archives, which contained at least one file with packed size exceeding 4 GB. This bug did not affect the recovery record based repair. It happened only if recovery record was not found and WinRAR performed reconstruction of archive structure
âœ” Even if "Do not extract paths" option in "Advanced" part of extraction dialog was set as the default, WinRAR still unpacked file paths if called from Explorer context menu
âœ” After entering a wrong password for encrypted ZIP archive, sometimes WinRAR ignored subsequent attempts to enter a valid password
âœ” "Wizard" command did not allow to create self-extracting and multivolume archives, when compressing a single folder or a file without extension
âœ” "Import settings from file" command did not restore multiline comments in WinRAR compression profiles
âœ” When converting RAR volumes having name1.name2.part#.rar name format, "Convert archives" command erroneously removed ".name2" name part. So resulting archive had name1.rar file name instead of expected name1.name2.rar
âœ” RAR could crash when creating a new archive with -agNNN switch if archive number in generated name was 110 or larger
âœ” WinRAR failed to display non-English file names in 7-Zip archives properly if they used a non-default code page. It was the display only problem, such names were unpacked correctly.
