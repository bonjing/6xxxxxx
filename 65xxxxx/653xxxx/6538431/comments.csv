[T],Smokey9t9,2011-07-14T09:16Z,Given my limited bandwidth can I suggest people download this one ep at a time in number order because if you tick all 27 to start with and you get chunks at random it's going to take a long time for any of them to complete.
,laggomundi,2011-07-15T02:15Z,"awesome, got the first episode down and the quality is great, Appleby Horse Fair, great start, can't wait to see the rest now. thanks Smokey9t9"
[T],Smokey9t9,2011-07-16T04:22Z,"Glad you're happy with the quality. Obviously even the original TV tape footage was a bit grainy as it was all taken with hand held cameras 40 or more years ago but I've tried to get a compromise between a sensible file size and resolution. This is my first attempt at editing video files and I think it's worked out not too badly.

There's a smidge more detail on the 490mb rips but nothing you'd ever really miss."
[T],Smokey9t9,2011-07-17T18:11Z,"Please help me seed this folks. Not a single person of the 25 or so who finished this is still seeding it and I'm back to square one with all the new downloads. It'll take me 2 or 3 days solid to upload the whole thing from scratch again.

If you have to remove things from your list then pick the popular ones with lots of seeds already."

  Thank you very much for this.
 Good job with file size reduction and keeping  quality.        

 Could use some seeds other than Smokey9t9.
 I will leave this seeding for quite a whole after I get it done."
,donleavy1,2011-12-27T03:35Z,"I reeeeely want this.

Would some kind person indulge a grandad and seed til I say thank you?"
,pirateradiorocks2,2012-04-03T09:19Z,"Thanks, very much!  I can remember tyring to get this from Mini Mova when it was in the larger file size.  I'll, be glad to let it seed back once I have it for at least 6mo. "
