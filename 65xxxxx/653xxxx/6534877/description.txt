Vantage Point 2008 720p BluRay DTS x264-CtrlHD


In Columbia Picturesâ€™ Vantage Point, Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid)
and Kent Taylor (Matthew Fox) are two Secret Service agents
assigned to protect President Ashton (William Hurt)
at a landmark summit on the global war on terror.
When President Ashton is shot moments after his
arrival in Spain, chaos ensues and disparate lives collide.
In the crowd is Howard Lewis (Forest Whitaker) an American
tourist video-taping the historic event to show his kids
when he returns home. Also there is Rex (Sigourney Weaver)
an American TV news producer who is reporting on the conference.
Itâ€™s only as we follow each personâ€™s perspective
of the same 15 minutes prior to and immediately after
the shooting that the terrifying truth behind
the assassination attempt is revealed.
