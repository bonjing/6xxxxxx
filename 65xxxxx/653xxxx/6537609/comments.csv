,feartruth,2011-07-13T19:32Z,"Have you been able to get hold of A-i-deul.. (aka Children...)? Its IMDb link is: 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1861982/
If yes, are you going to upload it?

Let me know IF possible. Sorry for asking it again. I honestly don't mean to spam. It's just that I'm very much curious about this movie and am not able to find it anywhere. Hope you won't mind it. I know it isn't possible for you to tend to each request individually, and I would understand if you can't reply. Thanks for sharing whatever you could have."
,AARRGG,2011-07-13T22:50Z,had a quick look at it 10/10 av rating and 2 hours of movie while only being 383 meg in size [including credits]. why cant other uploaders make their rips this way. please keep uploads like this happening. this is really good work
