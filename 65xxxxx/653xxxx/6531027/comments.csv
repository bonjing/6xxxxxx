,indiaman,2011-07-11T06:38Z,Thanks for this excellent book.
[V],_F1_,2011-07-11T09:10Z,"Wooo ... I was just to upload it ///
Mine is (January 1, 2011) | ISBN: 0538497815 | 1368 pages | PDF | 54 MB
I'll hold it now. Thanx for sharing ///"
[T],dynstab2,2011-07-12T00:38Z,"Your ISBN-10 and my ISBN-13 both refer to the same book (I assume you got your ISBN from the copyright page, not from what some other dude said). Jan 1 2010 is the release date. The production date stamp of my e-copy is Dec 15 2010 and meetyourbrain.com headers and footers have been added to each and every page sometimes interfering with contents. (meetyourbrain.com provides homework help for this text; related to cramster.com) Your page count is for the print copy. The page count for the e-copy I have is 1381 = 1368 + 13 others (mostly reference/reminder pages). PDF size is 54.5 MB (after repair for Adobe and retooling of bookmarks).

If you can (losslessly) compress significantly below 25 MB, post. I said significantly. ;-)   Anyway, statistics show that people prefer by far uncompressed (and sometimes broken) files... They then simply cut on seeding not to bust their monthly BW cap. [sigh]"

,savingmybass,2011-09-16T05:01Z,please upload  the solution manual to this one. please!
,chuckthechampion,2011-09-26T23:22Z,ok so I downloaded it but the adobe reader 9 on my computer says that it can't open the file. Can someone help me please?!
[T],dynstab2,2011-10-04T04:27Z,@chuckthechampion  First unpack the downloaded file (7-Zip format) to reveal the PDF file. Your first time with this encoding format?  Read instructions in the following torrent description:  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6718449/
,chuckthechampion,2011-11-16T18:45Z,"Thanks dynstab2, been using it for class this semester. Any chance that a solution manual will be available any time soon?"
[T],dynstab2,2011-12-04T21:12Z,Unfortunately solution manuals are crap shots. You can make partial use of the manuals for the 6th edition available on TPB. If I ever find it I will upload in the next 5 minutes.
