I dont think i'll upload the eps since theres already heaps of those available on the net, but do you want the season 3 extras that are on the australian release?"

You can rip commentaries by just using a free program called dvd decrypter, you can either copy the whole dvd to your hard disk or just the commentary stream, there are lots of other ways to do it, just google - how to rip audio stream from dvd, you'll find a lot of guides on how to do it.
Thanks to anyone who can upload these missing commentaries."
