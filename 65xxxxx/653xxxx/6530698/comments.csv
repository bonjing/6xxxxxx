,blackxino,2011-07-20T18:58Z,"@thugking8 

if it says .mkv
it means its an hq format, most of the .mkv are mostly in HD 720p. But this isn't.

you need KMPlayer or VLC Player to watch hd movies or play .mkv files"

Subs are horrible... doesn't make any sense. You can sort of piece it together. Stopped watching... waiting for better subs. Movie is worth the wait."
,LaMendt,2011-08-12T16:44Z,"Thanks for the effort on the subs, but damn there has to be some way of acquiring good subs. Checked out some of the movie, and it got me hooked looking for decent subs everyday. Great quality though."
,blastedy,2011-08-21T16:53Z,"any one knows how to burn this movie to dvd? tried dvd flick, doesn't work cause of some problem with the multiple audio channels"
,SnowBun,2011-10-23T00:48Z,"QUESTION regarding burn to DVD (multiple audio) I have learned at least this much.  In order for SUBS to work properly (I mean show up at ALL) the NAME of the subtitle file must match EXACTLY the name of the VIDEO file (except for file type extension....AVI for video, .SRT for subs (example)    Wu Xia.2011.SCENE-balance.torrent.AVI   (the subs file might just say ""Wu Xia.srt""  In which case, you must rename the subtitle file)  If there are multiple audio files that you can ACCESS, delete all but the one you want to use.  If you are not sure, you'll have to PLAY the video with each audio file to ascertain.  Perhaps they also must have the same name, I don't know.  I haven't had any problems related to AUDIO file only MATCHING UP SUBS so they show up on ripped DVD.  If the name (including dashes, dots, CAPS, etc.) is not exactly the same, subs just won't show up at all.  (tricked my know it all husband who couldn't get subs on a ripped DVD even trying 5 different subtitle types and files  LMAO!!!  I said OH well I don't understand anything, but, can I try?  3 minutes later, Here let's just test it.  WORKS.  >:O    â—„ 'him'  HAHA"
,fwee288,2011-10-25T01:30Z,anyone found better subs yet? found one on subscene but it got poor reviews too
,fwee288,2011-10-25T01:37Z,"oh and even tho the alt name is Dragon on IMDB its being floated around under the name Swordsmen, so perhaps proper subs can be found that way"
