,jersson,2011-07-13T15:08Z,Thank's but unfortunately it did'nt work on my Windows 7 machine. It works fine on my old XP machine. Any idea why ?

this is the exact same thing as xilsoft, these two companies do literal the same thing... even the exact same layout of the program gui!, this program doesnt carry over the id tags or artwork like my 4 year old crappy converted does... its just slow whereas this program is very fast and actually utilizing my 6 core cpu like it should be... 

really needs support for shit"
