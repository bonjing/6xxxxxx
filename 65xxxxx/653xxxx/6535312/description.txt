
As this is a soundtrack to a movie one definetely needs to go to the nearest Blockbuster and see it first. And see it again, just to understand it. 
If ever there was a European movie (besides Betty Blue) this is it! And if ever there was a European soundtrack - this is it! 
Bregovic is a genius miner of musical heritage of the continent, or rather of his home country - former Yugoslavia. And what jewels he brought us! 
Some of the songs worked so well that I never realized that I was watching a French movie (the book was written by Alexander Dumas) with traditional Croatian music in the background. Or a synthesis of Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian tunes. David Bowie put it best:"The end of twentieth century is about juxtaposition of information." And look what comes out when You do it right. 
But, besides all this - this is just fantastic music from a great composer and skilled craftsman that was lucky to have happened to live in a great place at a great time.(Customer from Amazon)
