,skibbeb,2011-07-11T22:06Z,"@MXMG are you sure this is compatible with XBox?  Does this come with 2 different audio tracks?  6-channel audio in MPEG-4 file doesn't play on XBox.. Just wondering, not bashing you at all"
,oldtimer48,2011-07-12T05:13Z,"A/9, V10, EXCELLENT COPY, thank you MXMG, great job. A good movie as well. 13th Century England seige of the Rochester Castle, blood and gore - look out for the scene where a man is writing his name on the wall towards ethe end of the movie, and the man alongside him has a hearing aid in his left ear."
,skibbeb,2011-07-12T19:39Z,DOES NOT stream to xbox.  Have to convert audio to 2 channel and it will then stream.  Why the uploader states X-Box is compatible baffles me.  Completely FALSE information
,TorrentTimUK,2011-07-21T23:08Z,Thanks very much.
