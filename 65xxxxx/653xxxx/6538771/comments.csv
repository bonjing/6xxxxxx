,crybaby95,2011-07-14T16:23Z,@fightapilotdean you don't have to mount it. you can burn it to a CD and install it by booting from the BIOS and select the correct partition. Then you can transfer all your data.
,crybaby95,2011-07-14T16:24Z,"BTW everyone! DO NOT USE THIS AS AN UPGRADE! This isn't the full every component install. It has some of the apps and components taken out. So for the sake of your computer, do a FRESH install!"
,crybaby95,2011-07-14T16:27Z,@fightapilotdean Just burn it to a CD and boot with the BIOS and install to the correct partition.
