MANKO SAYS: â€œ2011 dawned on our planet with mysterious hints to a imminent eco-calypse: first there were flocks of dead birds falling from the sky, Australia got swamped in alligator-ridden floods, then the worst earthquake and tsunami hit Japan followed by a nuclear fright, and all the while the global warming boils the oceans, and man still wages ceaseless wars on his neighbour. This time those Christian cults raving about the Judgement Day on 21 May 2011 don't seem so far fetched to me. Let's see if we survive this one, darlings. But if we don'tâ€¦ There's no sound as beautiful as the violin on the sinking Titanic.
