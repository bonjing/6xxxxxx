This isn't mine and I can't be sure, if that is a false positive or not.

Other way around, I could put some serials here too:

FMBP-JPBJ-DMBY-ZRNZ
MGPX-RKZD-GMFZ-YJXH
GRNH-GNWZ-ZZHB-YJRZ
XGCN-HNHC-RHFG-KZPY
DKXF-BWFZ-XHCN-KKPD
RXFZ-BBYX-PYKR-CCJZ
HFJM-HNHD-WNCX-DYMK
ZHND-WCYX-MCGG-JHZN
WPRB-YCNG-XJCC-XNYC
WCXN-WPPK-RBFF-HNYZ
CPDK-RWNG-HMXN-HHRH"

Tested and 100% works, you can update CW2 with serials generated by it."
,nadroje2,2011-10-03T10:48Z,I must be stupid because I cant figure out how to actually use the keygen.  I click on the application and nothing happens.
,Sephiroth93,2011-10-04T23:15Z,Make sure to run it as Administrator!
,Salzamar,2011-10-06T06:48Z,"The key's made with this, and the one's posted above only function untill update 327.  Then become invalid.   "
,Sephiroth93,2011-10-06T09:34Z,"Obviously the maker of Creeper World 2 has banned those serials on the update, so download the keygen and use new one. :)"
,Sephiroth93,2011-10-07T12:02Z,"Also, try to uninstall and clean registry and then reinstall CW2 and use serial and updated, should work..."
,johnmyster,2012-01-16T06:22Z,"Would someone mind posting some keys for v. 439? I can't get the keygen to work, even after closing my browser and all other programs, running as admin, even xp compatibility mode (I have windows 7)

Thanks!"
