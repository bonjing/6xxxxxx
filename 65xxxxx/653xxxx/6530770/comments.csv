,Renatus_Upborne,2011-07-12T14:14Z,Do we have to download all the store updates? I could certainly save myself a lot of time downloading since the store updates are the largest of the files.
,firedingo,2011-07-18T13:47Z,Man I love the uploader. Normally I don't put store content in but a few things caught my eye and I could never find them or get them to install properly. This is by far the coolest torrent ever. THANK YOU UPLOADER!!!!!!!
