A guitar and a computer turned Taiwan's university student Jerry Chang 
(better known as JerryC) into an international celebrity. One spring morning, 
the amateur guitarist played his hard-rock version of Johann Pachelbel's 
classic Canon in D in front of his webcam and uploaded it onto the Internet. 
His musical sense and his exceptional skills with the instrument attracted a 
great deal of attention, generating a hit rate exceeding 10 million on Youtube 
and making himself an Internet sensation. Guitar fans and musicians the 
world over expressed admiration for him, many imitated him, and some even 
wanted to challenge him.

Now, JerryC's highly anticipated debut EP is finally released. It comes with his 
breakout hit Canon Rock and his latest work Dear Mozart, plus their guitar-
less versions, as well as the guitar tabs for Canon Rock.
