The most complete collection I could gather from the internet from Elastic Steel: Method of Athletic Conditioning. This guy does amazing work and really knows his stuff. Paul Zaichik can turn you into a badass killing machine with these DVD\\\'s.

 Mixed quality in here, none too high unfortunately, but it is the best I could find. Please bear with this seed at first as my upload speeds are horribad.
