 The childcare expert tackles nine-year-old Max, who has never eaten a hot meal
 and exists on a diet of custard creams, leaving him with no energy and unable to
 concentrate at school. Trenyce is bullied at school, and the seven-year-old takes
 out her unhappiness on her family. Jo has to teach her to speak to her mother, and
 give them both the skills to manage her anger.
                         
                                 Enjoy!
