Summary

A Groundbreaking Work Offering a Balanced Presentation of Human History

In today\'s world of globalization, there is a growing trend among historians and students alike to study the common challenges and experiences that unite the human past. Facts On File\'s seven-volume Encyclopedia of World History is a truly groundbreaking work and one of the first to offer a balanced presentation of human history for a global perspective on the past. A team of distinguished world history academics has brought together scores of specialists in writing signed entries based on the latest scholarship.

Based on the National Standards for World History

Influenced by the National Standards for World History, this comprehensive and authoritative set is rich in features to make the study of world history easier for students to understand. Arranged in six chronological eras that span prehistory to the present day, its chronological approach follows the way world history is taught and studied in the classroom. Each volume era begins with essays that address large themesâ€”such as agriculture, science and technology, social and class relationships, trade and cultural exchanges, and warfareâ€”allowing students to make connections and trace key global patterns over time. The final volume contains primary source documents and a master index for the set.
