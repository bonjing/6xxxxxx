Frame of Mind (2009) 

New Jersey Detective David Secca's life is changed forever when he discovers a piece of film in an antique box. On the film is a lone man, concealing a rifle, standing on a grassy knoll-the exact knoll President John F. Kennedy passed as he was assassinated. But is the film authentic? Or, is it another hoax surrounding President Kennedy's murder? When David seeks help in Professor Steve Lynde, it becomes horrifically clear the photo holds evidence of conspiracy. Now, the two must race to expose the cover-up before they're eliminated.
