Quote:
Theneer Viduthi decides to give in to Kollywood. Within those restrictions, it tries to distinguish itself. It attempts to recycle Kollywood trash with no intentions of revitalizing it. Its result is something that isn't worthy of your opinion. I don't hate it. I don't like it either. I just went in, saw something and left. If you're still contemplating going for the film and asking what the movie is about, read on.

Two brothers set up incandescent pandals for a living, around the city. One guy is having an affair with his cousin sister while the other is about to, with the daughter of a righteous man who plans to marry her off to an 'American mappillai.' Then, there's the owner of a theneer viduthi (tea shop), who has a mirror fixed in such a way that he can ogle at the girl working in the opposite shop with ease. Once in a while, another character, whose entry was marked by a "Dummy piece" from certain members of the audience, kept coming on screen trying to destroy the integrity of the righteous father.

While watching the film, I felt that the music director was talented and his contribution stood out. His dexterity with various instruments is evident. I was thinking about how talented people have to start at the bottom. When the credits rolled, I found out that the film was scored by the film director himself. Director S.S. Kumaran has new ideas but they work on the surface and have little impact on you. He doesn't know how to weave video and sound, seamlessly. There're shots where the camera is at a distance, yet you hear the characters voices so clearly reminding you that the dialogue was re-recorded. The acting is acting and the dialogue is dialogue. I think a film like Theneer Viduthi will have its viewers cheering only when screened at a prison. Anywhere else, it's like going for a ride on a pleasant day at 20kmph. There're occasional breezes but you take them for granted. In the end, you do it and then you're done with it.
Enjoy
