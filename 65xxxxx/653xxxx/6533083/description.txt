 This book offers an examination of Levinasâ€™s philosophy of religion in light of his ethics and anthropology. It provides critical perspectives on Levinas by relating his work to that of Heidegger, Ricoeur, Rorty, Derrida and Vattimo. The focus of interpretation is the hermeneutics of kenosis: the subjectâ€™s ability to be open towards the other to the point where man can be seen as a place of God.
