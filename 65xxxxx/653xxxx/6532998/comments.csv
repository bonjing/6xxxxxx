,xeusoi16,2011-07-30T00:07Z,"Its a rar within a rar, within a rar, within a rar... I don't get the joke here?"
,mcrowley,2011-08-31T10:52Z,"If you can't bother update your codecs maybe just use vlc media player or at the very least install fddshow.  Also, no RAR file registered in the download list whatsoever, and if it was compressed it's only three fucking clicks away to unRAR shit.  You people drive me to drink.

Besides, scenebalance is a good uploader, not a fake."
