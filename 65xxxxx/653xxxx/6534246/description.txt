 From cell phones to treating cancer, EM energy plays a part in many of the innovations that we take for granted everyday. A basic force of nature, like nuclear energy or gravity, this energy can be harnessed and used, but still holds the potential to be harmful. The question remains, how safe are EM products? Bioeffects and Therapeutic Applications of Electromagnetic Energy provides a review of cutting-edge research in EM health effects and EM therapy along with emerging areas of bioengineering and biomedical engineering.
