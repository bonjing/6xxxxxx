                           DESCRiPTiON 

A reclusive scientific prodigy and three college friends find themselves in the
middle of a toxic storm, when an unscrupulous business deal rains terror down on
an entire county.

iMDB User Review: "Black Rain" is a kind of toxic rain disaster conspiracy
thriller with a paint-by-numbers plot, stock characters, and a rather suspect
science premise. It's the kind of thing you watch, late at night, when you're
not too fussy, and the only other movie playing is "Terminator", which you've
already seen 27 times. There seems to be an entire movie industry built on these
low-budget made-for-TV potboilers. But wait. The writers threw a wrench into
this one. Jack, Jenny and Andrew are out camping. Jack and Jenny (I know, I
know, those names) are an item. Andrew is the fifth wheel. Andrew is gay. Enter
Kevin, a hot guy with a cute butt. Kevin is a hermit living in a tent, nearby,
with his chemistry set. Kevin is also gay. Do you see where this is going? Will
they or won't they? Anyway, bad things happen but Kevin and Andrew save the day.
They kiss just before the final fade-out. It's good to see a gay romantic
subplot in a project such as this, even if it's presented in a rather chaste
manner. Otherwise, this is strictly generic fare - filler for cable movie
channels and a hook on which to hang commercials.

                                 Enjoy!
