[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-13T17:49Z,Anybody heard if RR/TD will have his own Relaunch title???
[V],mirrormaster82,2011-07-13T18:29Z,"MrDowntown:As far as I know they won't relaunch his title,but Tim will be in teen titans and he will have same costume as he had in the unternet."
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-07-13T22:19Z,"I can't believe, they're gonna give Jason Todd his own comic book, but discontinue RR, Batgirl and Power-Girl :-("
[V],mirrormaster82,2011-07-14T01:05Z,"Yeah,I know,I mean batgirl will still have her own book,but it will be Barbara Gordon not Stephanie,Power girl - really I don't care,but RR gone after issue 26,I don't know what to say...I'm speechless,100 things pop to my mind ( what I would do to them )..."
