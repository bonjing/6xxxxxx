This is the latest version of Nolan Lawson's PokeDroid Extras, the compliment to PokeDroid 1.5.2. It contains an installer (APK) to copy additional resources to the PokeDroid app, found here. All pokemon-related apps are being removed from the Google market in compliance with a DMCA complaint by The Pokemon Company inc, but this would otherwise be free.

The perfect app for either the PokÃ©maniac whoâ€™s gotta catch â€˜em all or the Gen-Y hipster trying to be ironic. It started out as something of a joke app, since the main feature was that it used the Android TTS engine to speak aloud each PokÃ©monâ€™s description, similar to the PokÃ©dex in the TV show. Now itâ€™s more of a full-on strategy guide, with lots of detailed info for PokÃ©mon gamers. Supports generations three through five.
