,zylch,2011-07-15T20:58Z,"Thanks for all your superb releases. I'm stuck at 93.2% with this one, though tracker is showing 12 seeds I can't connect to them... any suggestions?"
,rippervanwinkle,2011-07-16T11:25Z,"Very impressive picture quality.  I have the region 2 remastered DVD and that was the best I'd seen until now (the .  There are a few different versions of The Last Emperor, so here's what you get:

In terms of the length and the scenes this one is the theatrical version, not the terrible extended TV cut.  Except it is in 2.0:1 aspect ratio, as always intended by the director (the film was shown in theatres at 2.35:1 and some DVD versions are at 2.35:1).  So you can say that this is the definitive version as intended by Bertolucci, nothing added or taken away and looking just as he envisaged when shooting.

Picture quality: this movie is from the era of technicolor 35mm, not digital capture.  There is film grain and thankfully the studio and encoder didn't go crazy with a denoiser and turned it to mush like so many people do. This leaves you with a hugely detailed, sharp picture with rich, saturated, natural colours and  just a little grain.  It's ideal.

Every other BDRip or HDTV release of the Last Emperor that I've seen has been truly awful, much worse than my DVD.

This is the one to get."

AND IT IS NOT IN ENGLISH...it's Dubbed with Russian so you can't even hear the english anyway. Don't bother...unless you can understand Russian!"
