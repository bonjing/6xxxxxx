 Understanding the cell is the key to grasping the significant potential and technological developments of the new biology. Gene therapy, animal cloning, and stem cell therapy are possible now only because of the great advances in our knowledge of cell biology, which modern technology has allowed scientists to make. As researchers are able to understand more about individual cells, questions and theories arise about such elements as DNA, enzymes, and chromosomes.
