                           DESCRiPTiON 

 The A&E staff of King's College Hospital in London treat patients involved in
 accidents, including a construction worker who broke his leg in three places and
 suffered injuries to his chest after being trapped under a cherry picker. Plus,
 a man who fell from a ladder and landed on his head, and a widower who had a
 nasty encounter with a mandoline while chopping vegetables.
                         
                                 Enjoy!
