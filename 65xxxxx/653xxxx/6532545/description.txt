Itâ€™s All Good is a feature length film created in 1998 focusing on inline skating. The film starts out as a documentary focusing on skating in general narrated by rollerblading pioneer and legend Chris Edwards and turns into a storyline between rival companies FR and Senate. 

The classic East Coast vs West, New York vs the world story line is showcased and New York Cityâ€™s history is preserved and represented in this documentary. Itâ€™s All Good is over 90 minutes long featuring NYC legends and FR team riders Dave Ortega, Ryan Jacklone, Gil Vasquez, Nene Tejada, Ozzie Tejada, Robert Disla, Harry Disla, Jose Disla, and FR creator Nick Hartman. â€œYou havenâ€™t seen street until youâ€™ve seen Dave and his crew. The part of that other world. That one percent that uses the streets of New York as they were meant to be usedâ€ â€“ Chris Edwards.
