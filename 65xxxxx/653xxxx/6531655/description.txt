Release info:

London based Francesco Mura is a well know member of the legendary Live Act Dejavoo.
With his first Solo Album, 'Subliminal Broadcast', Francesco presents a 9 track Album of minimal classic Goa Trance.
Certainly hitting a progressive note, this Album is very hypnotic, mixed with heavy Techno Beats and British Psy-Trance!
