[b]Thx Hive


CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D


Sources:
Video: Russian TS Proper
Audio: Imagines Line
thx


Encode:
Another 8h job.
Well that was a biatchload of work, the russian proper video is a lot better than the previous ts, but all levels
on brightness, constrast, and HSV are all more than overdue. Even scenes at night are now looking like they were
shot at daylight. All current versions out arent that good so i took time to fix the problems since audio was
line and worth doing a makeover. First i had to find a base level on all scenes shot at daylight inside a room,
house, or hotel room, where the sunlight doesnt effect the scenes, and made a new project out of that. Afterwards,
i had the complete movie leveled out but all scenes outside, in the classrooms and all scenes at night, didnt look
as they should be. So i had to cut out those parts and do them all individual as needed. Had to fix a lot but the
final project looks good now also on big TVs and will do till a screener or r5 gets out. Audio was good, still did
my usual cleanup anyway, and fixed a couple oos spots, all in sync now - enjoy!

ps:
for those who may complain its darker than the others --> no its not - it should look this way. if you brighten
something up more than it should be you see more than you should, but that doesnt mean it looks good.
