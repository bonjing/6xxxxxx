Nagoya - Day 01 2011
Welcome back Sumo fans!  After a long hiatus, we finally have Televised Coverage from NHK.  I have in this time, upgraded my PC and my ISP has also upgraded my service, which should get the seeding going great! (knock on wood, cross fingers, etc.)

Resolution:	720 x 480
Source:		Non-HD NTSC Cable source
Languages :	 Japanese and English
Processed through S-Cable and edited with â€œSony Vegas Pro 9.0â€ (once per language) and recoded to .AVI with â€œQuick Media Converter 3.6.5â€(again once per language) and finally combined with â€œAviMux_GUIâ€ to create the dual language file.  
This process as you can guess, takes about ten hours to complete: so please be patient!  I'll get 'er done!
