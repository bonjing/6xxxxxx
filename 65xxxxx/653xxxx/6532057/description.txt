Steveâ€™s last album â€˜of Many Handsâ€™ was a excellent folk album that was well received by both critics and the general public; this new album picks up where the last one left off and shows Steve to be one of the most players and singers on the current folk scene.
Where this album really shines is in the quality of the songs, of the 14 songs on the disc, twelve are written by Tilston and only two are trad arrs; and over the course of the album the songs are of a consistently high quality. From the folk-like storytelling of â€˜The King of the Coinersâ€™, the celebration of the simple things of â€˜Jacarandaâ€™, through to the analysis of â€˜Madame Museâ€™ the standard of the writing is exceptionally high. Bringing everything together is the fantastic sound of Steveâ€™s Martin Cole guitar, it has a distinct sound and his playing style is easily recognisable; combine this with a strong ear for a melody and an engaging vocal delivery and you have an album that works on every level.
While Steve is the main focus on the disc, and every track is guitar focused, the songs cover an impressive range of styles and dynamics; additional instrumentation is restrained but beautifully used with Chris Parkinsonâ€™s accordion obviously present with double bass, violin and percussion also present.
Add considered and interesting liner notes to the package and you have an almost faultless contemporary singer/songwriter album â€“ there will be few better discs released this year. Unreservedly recommended
