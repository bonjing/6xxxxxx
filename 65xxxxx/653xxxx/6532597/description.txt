Commander Badman [Eric Idle, Monty Python, Rutland Weekend Television]

A precursor to Eric Idle's post-Monty Python TV series Rutland Weekend Television,
 this not very good short aired as part of the children's comedy anthology series
 "Funny Ha Ha" on 24 May 1974. Eric Idle wrote and narrated the 12 minute sketch.

This was the first time Idle worked with Henry Woolf and David Battley, who would
become regulars on Rutland Weekend Television the next year.

Aubrey Woods [who sang "The Candy Man" in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]
plays Commander Badman, a clueless, aging supervillain unsure of how to commit
a crime.
