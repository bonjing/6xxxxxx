        Season 4, Episode 2: Witch Hunt

        PC Rowan  is stopped  by three  children, who  claim they have
        seen a witch. And indeed they find an urn with the remains  of
        on  of  Kate's  former   patients  Amy  Dewhurst,  which   the
        mysterious  woman  threw  over  the  church  yard  fence.  The
        description of the woman matches Nancy Bellow, the housekeeper
        and  companion of  the deceased.  Now she  cooks for  Marjorie
        Salter,  the  grand  niece of  her  former  employer, and  her
        husband,  who  are  renovating  her  aunt's  old  house.   The
        following  night the  Salters are  admitted to  hospital with
        symptoms of food poisoning. Inspector Crossley is so convinced
        that Nancy Bellow  has tried to  poison her new  employers and
        murdered Amy Dewhurst that he goes to far to get a  confession
        out of her.
