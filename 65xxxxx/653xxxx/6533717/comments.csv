A/9
V/8
Pictures in 4:3 format, but the quality on this copy is really good, there's a few minor focus issues on some of the darker scenes but the lighter scenes are as good as you'll get from any PPVRip and the audio is spot on... This is easily the best copy of the movie that I've seen and I've downloaded six different copies so far...
Many Thanx to heist and Feel-Free for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"

TS sucks and should be forbidden"
,iamnotobama,2011-08-17T11:37Z,"I'm with you.  Why does anyone bother with TS at all????  If i want shi*ty bootlegs I'll grab em from the gypsies on the corner.  Still, points for getting movies on to the internet as quick as you guys do.  (for $0 i might add!). "
