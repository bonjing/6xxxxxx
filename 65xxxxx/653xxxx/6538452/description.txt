 Artificial intelligenceâ€”broadly defined as the study of making computers perform tasks that require human intelligenceâ€”has grown rapidly as a field of research and industrial application in recent years. Whereas traditionally, AI used techniques drawn from symbolic models such as knowledge-based and logic programming systems, interest has grown in newer paradigms, notably neural networks, genetic algorithms, and fuzzy logic.
