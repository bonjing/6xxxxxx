Release Notes....: I had originally planned on encoding this at 550MiB since it had a longer runtime than most episodes. After seeing how
		   small the 720p came out with crf 20 I thought that 350MiB would be more appropriate for this episode. Also, I'm sure you've 
		   noticed that this episode is tagged S07. After doing some research and judging by the DVD releases, I'm pretty sure this is 
		   the season 7 premiere. Sorry for all the terrible tagging on ALL the previous seasons. We will start anew without REAL 
		   tags!
