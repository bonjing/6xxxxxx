 It will come as no surprise to those already familiar with earlier editions (1957, 1974) that the third edition of this title remains unrivaled as the authoritative one-volume dictionary of the Christian church, its doctrines and practices, and its most influential historical figures. In addition, the reader will find a host of entries pertaining to the Bible and its world. Because of the rise of theologies of liberation since the publication of the second edition, and because of a growing awareness of the need to heed Christian cultures often regarded as on the fringes of Christendom, many doctrinal articles have undergone revision and many have been added. Prominent Evangelicals have also been included (though, owing to this work's decidedly historical thrust, only rarely does the name of a living figure appear).
