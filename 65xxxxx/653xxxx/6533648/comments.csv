,mvp7001,2011-07-12T16:46Z,"They totally f@cked the pc version.

Even at HIGH settings, there is no road glare
or the detail that they put into the console versions.

Sad... Unless a High Res Pack comes out, I won't be playing or buying this game."
,gamesforfree,2011-07-12T17:55Z,"Worst PC port of all time .

Thanks extremezone anyway ."

,geoffp,2011-07-14T12:35Z,"Having now installed and run the game I wish I hadn't bothered. As someone else mentioned, it's the the worst game EVER!.... In fact you can find Flash games with better quality graphics.
One DVD wasted. Oh well!  "

,silenceisgood,2011-08-02T19:00Z,"Thanks 4 da upload. thou the graphics shit. but that disneys failure to b careless abt pc versions. FOR THE PPL WHO R FACING Rld.dll ISSUE , here is the solution. your antivirus (sure if norton) is thinking that Rld.dll is a virus and without telling u deleting the file. 
1. disable antivirus
2. extract the file
3. install
4. copy crack (here u will find Rld.dll)
5. enable antivirus.

Still if its deleting, try to register Rld.dll as safe in antivirus.

Thanks extremezone."
