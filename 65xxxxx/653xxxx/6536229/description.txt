I downloaded all of these episodes from here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5597313/Case_Closed_Detective_Conan_All_English_Releases

After being unable to get the rest of the episodes, and no seeders coming in I decided to upload it myself so everyone else can have this great series too.

I know the audio for one of the later episodes is off, I don't remember which one it is. So if anyone figures out which one it is later, please comment to let me know thanks. :)


PLEASE! Don't forget to see when you are finished. <3

Detective Conan/Case Closed English Dub. Episodes 1-79.

Also if anyone is able to get the dubs of any of the movies or any episode past 79 (season 3 end) please comment here <3
Spread the love of this great Anime mystery <3
