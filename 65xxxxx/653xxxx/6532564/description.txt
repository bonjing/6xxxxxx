There\\\'s Something About Mary is a 1998 American comedy film, directed by the Farrelly brothers, Bobby and Peter. It stars Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon and Ben Stiller, it is a combination of romantic comedy and gross-out film.

The film was placed 27th in the American Film Institute\\\'s 100 Years, 100 Laughs: America\\\'s Funniest Movies (see the 100 Years Series), a list of the 100 funniest movies of the 20th century. In 2000, readers of Total Film magazine voted it the 4th greatest comedy film of all time. 


PLOT
Awkward and shy 16-year-old high-schooler Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller) lands a prom date with his dream girl Mary Jensen (Cameron Diaz), just to have it cut short by a painful and embarrassing zipper accident involving his penis and ends up going to the hospital. After that, they lose touch with each other.

13 years later, Ted is still in love â€” maybe even obsessed â€” with her. On the advice of his best friend Dom (Chris Elliott), he hires sleazy private detective Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to track her down. Healy finds that she is an orthopedic surgeon living in Miami with her friend, Magda (Lin Shaye), but he falls in love with the irresistible Mary as well. Healy resorts to lying, cheating, stalking, and drugging Magda\\\'s dog to win Mary but is exposed by Mary\\\'s architect friend, the apparently crippled Tucker (Lee Evans). Tucker, however, turns out to be a fraud himself, a pizza boy who is also in love with Mary and drives potential rivals away by slander, including Brett Favre, the famous American football star (playing himself), whom she almost married.

Ted, aided by Dom, drives down to Florida and seems to have won Mary\\\'s love, until an anonymous letter exposes his being less than honest about his link to Healy. While Ted confronts Healy and Tucker, Mary is confronted by Dom, who turns out to be her former boyfriend Woogie, who \\\"got weird on her\\\" in college, setting up the original prom scenario. Having found out that Tucker also lied about Mary\\\'s former love interest, football player Brett Favre, Ted decides that Mary should be with Brett, as Brett was the only one who did not resort to deceit to win Mary. After reuniting Brett and Mary, Ted leaves tearfully but Mary chases after him, preferring him over Brett. The film concludes with the two engaging in a kiss while a guitarist (Jonathan Richman) who narrates/sings along all the story is accidentally shot by Magda\\\'s boyfriend who was trying to shoot Ted so he could win over Mary.
