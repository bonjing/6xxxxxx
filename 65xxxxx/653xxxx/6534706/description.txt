Release Notes....: History Channel tried a neat trick tonight where they aired American Pickers, American Restoration, and Pawn Stars in one
		   long episode without any break in between.  However, each segment has the show intro and is much like a normal episode only
		   its storyline correlates with the other shows. So if you wanna watch the whole episode you'll have to download all three
		   shows. Enjoy!
