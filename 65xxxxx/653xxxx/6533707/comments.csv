Those whom don't believe Feng Shui doesn't work should mind their own business and not post, nor download material realted to Feng Shui- your energy is bad.

Just a few of the well known buildings that have employed Feng Shui techniques are:

    Trump Tower (Donald Trump)
    Virgin Airlines
    Bank of England
    Disneyland (Walt Disney Corporation)
    British Airways"
