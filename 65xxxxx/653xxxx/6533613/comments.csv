[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-08-05T15:26Z,No sound is your codecs. There's a notepad doc in the torrent with a link to free codecs.

First go to Preferences in the Tools menu.
In the Audio section make sure that, Enable Time-Stretching Audio is UNchecked.
Click Save, then exit and restart VLC.
Under the volume control there is a box with 1.00x in it. NOTE: This is the position in VLC Version 1.1.11; it may be moved somewhere else in later versions.
Click it and move the slider down to 0.96x
This will reduce the speed to approximately the correct speed for NTSC."
,stzfrkx,2011-09-23T21:08Z,"@ Mercury8215:
WTF r u talking about??! Nobody ever gets this torrent because none of those motherfuckers are seeding!! NOBODY IS SEEDING!! FUCK YOU ALL!! Bloody fucking assholes!"
,technosailor,2011-10-14T06:45Z,"If you can rip it again with x264 (H.264) for video and AAC 128K HEv2 6 channels for audio and Matroska (.mkv) for container would be great for smaller files if you could add subtitles in the .mkv or external .srt files would be awsome.

This looks like is XVID (is H.263 only) and mp3?

Thx for this upload anyway man, I'm downloading another torrent but your intention was commendable."
,technosailor,2011-10-15T01:13Z,"This: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6604038/STAR_TREK_ENTERPRISE_-_Season_1_Complete_480P_H264-ILPruny and the other 3 seasons has MONO AUDIO and compressed to average 41Kbps, max 49Kbps so poor quality, video is 10/10; so i'm downloading this one I hope is stereo and good video quality since is a big 350MB per file, the other torrent was only 180MB and it has good seeding."
,Lucian_,2012-01-16T16:04Z,Thanks for these boxset uploads! I just hope I can finish D/Ling them so I can seed.
,markusminix,2012-01-31T04:32Z,Is there any subtittle text in this collections?
,markusminix,2012-03-31T06:27Z,"Anyone, help me to find the english subtitles pack for this series,,  Download link please...

Thank you"
,fern1975,2012-04-07T23:27Z,"Well thanks for upping the complete collection, unfortunately in a completely proprietary codec forcing people to use just your codec. wont even work with a fully upgraded vlc. Very sad, so don't seed, useless."
,Arkat00thpaste,2012-04-28T10:42Z,"Heya folks, seen a couple of comments about audio,  there are quite a few codec packs out.  The most popular from my world has been the Klite codec pack which recently released a newer version.  I however am currently using the CCCP codec pack and it is working superbly.  Also depending on what player you use, VLC is a good one but sometimes with HQ video such as mp4 and mkv it will pixelate some times as it  doesn't buffer as well as it should.  WMP I have found can be adjusted to a very high read/buffer setting.  I currently have mine set to 90 seconds so if you don't mind waiting a minute and a half (and if you do you should see a shrink for OCD) WMP is a good one to use if you are getting the pixelated issues with VLC.  Hope this helps... oh by the way there are a few websites that will pop up when you search the CCCP codec so make sure you get the proper one.  I  flies a Russian flag so you know you have the right site.  Now for the most important part of this novel I am writing right now..... THANK YOU T.S.V!!!!!  I am one of the minority in the Trekkie world whom loved this series, it was a weekly get together with a good friend of mine who passed away last week so it will be hard to watch without him but I will nonetheless.  You are a  God among pirates my friend and I salute you for making this available."
