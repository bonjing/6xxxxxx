,bball230,2011-07-13T14:19Z,is this for jtag only?
,DeMoGoGoN,2011-07-13T23:57Z,"This will work on unmodified xbox's.
Just like my other torrent."
,deadvirgo,2011-07-14T00:30Z,"It works. Just killed an assload of zombies. The only thing that I was confused about was the title update. In Party Buffalo, Cache was not in the data folder, it was it's own separate folder and had a folder inside of it that was also called cache. I ended up putting the TU in cache\cache and everything's working for me. Thanks to demogogon for the up."
,Caeljin,2011-07-14T20:06Z," worked well as the instructions of demogogon, but the TU works as deadvirgo say,into the cache\cache .was the first time i did it,but as noobmaster in this matter i didnt know how to use the update with a usb....i discovered u need always need to leave the update into the pendrive while playng to works,all other dlc can be put into the hd.
Ty Demogogon , now its mafia 2 download :)"
,DeMoGoGoN,2011-07-15T00:18Z,"Yeah, sorry....

The Title Update instructions are a bit screwy.

If you have the Xbox HDD Transfer cable, you can put the TU directly onto the HDD and not worry about having the USB connected.

Ive got a fairly large collection of XBLA games that work on Non-JTag consoles too, they dont require any special equipment as they can be loaded the same way as this.

The reason the games work, is because they are/were all free to download via the marketplace.  Some of them arent available any more however.

If anyone expresses an interest, I will upload them too :)"
,Caeljin,2011-07-15T01:07Z,lol i vote YES to new torrentz of new XBLA working games !!!!
,Copnm,2011-07-16T05:13Z,Will this procedure work on any Xbox with the current dashboard and not get the user banned?

,zoull,2011-10-25T10:47Z,"All of them seem to work except for Claptrap's New Robot Revolution. When I try to transfer that one to my jump drive with Party Buffalo it throws an unhandled exception. Is anyone else getting this? I'm going to redownload and try again. Or it someone could give me their copy that they know transfered over please let me know, I really want that DLC. Thanks uploader and everyone for all your continued support."
,zoull,2011-10-26T00:46Z,"Never mind figured it out, for the Claptrap Revolution I had to right click select inject new file and choose it and do it that way for some reason but it works. Sad day that I'm against the Claptrap's I liked those quirky little robots. Thanks again uploader."

,mamailo,2012-04-02T20:45Z,"Thank, all work perfect.
 Since i do not like to have the USB connected just to play; I did conect the Xbox HD to the PC and transfer the file ""TU....."" into the HD/cache directory; reassemble the whole thing and Voila!!. No more USB needed.
Thanks again"
,gunstrike8g,2012-04-06T05:43Z,would i get banned playing online with friends?
,sinfthedruid,2012-04-27T01:39Z,"@gunstrike8g

if using a pirated copy or ""backup"" of the game then possibly but that's why you use abgx to verify stealth passes. also, since it's an older game, they probably won't be upping security anytime soon for this title. but, if using a legit copy, since this is drm free, there should be no issue with online play as there are no checks for drm free content."
,sinfthedruid,2012-04-27T01:44Z,"side note, you don't need the xbox hdd transfer cable. all you need is a torque bit that's the right size (t4 i think) and you can get into the casing really easily and it is just a sata laptop drive inside which you can hookup as you would any other sata drive. also, if you have a third party hdd (like the ones that are bigger than the microsoft ones) then you won't need a t4. you will only need a standard phillips as they almost always change the screws since not everyone has torque bits. beware though that those drives often have a messed up 2nd partition that you must fix if you intend to play original xbox games since that partition is for the xbox emulation. the 360 is not backward compatible so it runs an emulator."
,Greylore,2012-05-03T17:05Z,"Thx for the torrent!  Dl' ing right now at around 300 kbps!  Unfortunately, I can't seed right now because of my ports -_- .  If I ever get them fixed, I'll be sure to seed."
