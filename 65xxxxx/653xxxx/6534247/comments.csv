,miguelsz3,2011-07-16T05:59Z," You did copy all the files from the crack folder to where you installed Worms Reloaded right? (steamclient.dll,steam_api.dll,Skidrow.ini)

 Though whole ""game cache fail"" sounds like Steam is trying to check for the games integrity .... You arent running it through steam or something like that are you? Other than that I dont know... I guess, I'll try to find some more information to help you fix your problem =/"
,aliksstar,2011-07-17T16:34Z,"Getting the same thing, ""cache error"". Hoping to play soon))"
,miguelsz3,2011-07-18T01:42Z,"@T4N9L3D,aliksstar

I installed it in C:\Games\Team17 folder! The updater correctly finds the game location, installs, then I copy SKIDROW folder and start the game. It veryfies game files (1666) and somewhere in the end says it is corrupted, blablabla... "
,miguelsz3,2011-07-20T08:21Z,"Ok I did a bit of research...... It might sound a bit stupid.... but try this. Re-add the contents from the Skidrow folder to where you have Worms Reloaded installed. Then when the ""Verify Integrity"" thing pops up...... Just click cancel, the game should start up..... agian I know it sounds a bit offbeat... Just try it and tell me if it works."
,miguelsz3,2011-07-20T08:23Z,"Oh, I almost forgot re-run the patch before you install the crack!"
,aliksstar,2011-07-21T11:46Z,"Ok, It worked! =)

The only thing now you have to press ""cancel"" all the time and game says you have ""new"" content every time)))

Anyway thanks miguelsz3 for help! I appreciate that! ;)"
,KJAKJ,2011-07-25T22:16Z,it works with doing cancel  but  while u play the game  all the damage  is set to 1 
,miguelsz3,2011-07-26T10:51Z,"Yah that crap started happening to me.... I did a bit of research and found out that this was cuased by some Bullshit anti-cheat system Team-17 implemented. It checks whether or not files have been modified... Funny thing is I never once messed with them. Anywho I found a fix for it just google ""Worms Reloaded Crc Patcher"" should be the first link. It removes the dumb check for modified files. Oh, you should get a ""verify file integrity"" popup but just let it load up. Worked for me."
,dothackjhe,2011-08-21T07:34Z,I downloaded Worms Reloaded Crc Patcher but BitDefender 2011 found a virus in it. I guess sticking to the original game won't hurt if one just wants a little bit of fun. .
,Husain.87,2011-08-23T05:39Z,"same problem for me, i got an error when launching the game
