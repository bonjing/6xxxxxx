I was curious if you were planning on releasing The Lord Of The Rings anytime in the future....specifically the newest released extended cut version....and actually as I write this I realize that due to the fact that the movies are so long that you can almost read the books faster, that they probably wouldn't fit on a single disc in the correct format to which you upload them....but if possible that would be awesome. Thanks again for all work."
,joaoandrew,2011-07-12T16:11Z,"Hey HD-R-US,
Wondering when you're planning on uploading Rango ?"
,lordkv,2011-07-12T20:55Z,Kindly keep us informed in advance what movies you plan to release next. That way I can save my bandwidth for only your releases and don't waste time downloading some other releases and more importantly to seed too. TIA

HD-R-US stated that he's traveling and is busy a lot, so you can't expect him to update everyday. Just be patient and I'm sure more stuff will come."

,Horse66,2011-08-03T14:15Z,"I thank you very much for the great job you are doing, however I need an advice; only on your movies my vlc (mac) do not synchronies the subtitles and they appear by flashes.
I tried to increase/decrease the speed but it seems to never catch up with the movie...beside that, the subtitles shows longer enough to be read ONLY while I am increasing or decreasing the speed....PLEASE HELP! :-)"
