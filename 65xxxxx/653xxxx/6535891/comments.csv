,bro_red,2011-07-13T00:34Z,Thank you. I've been counting down the days for this to release.
,normskis69,2011-07-14T08:46Z,YES! Roy Dotrice is back!
,Angelo85,2011-07-15T12:02Z,"Torrent is A+

But I have to say that some voices from Roy Dotrice kind of annoy me, Daenarys is a major example. Other readers from previous volumes did a better job imho."
,cemccall,2011-07-15T23:00Z,Dotrice is awesome.  He read the first 3 books and was sorely missed for book 4.  
,plasifras,2011-07-28T21:33Z,will you be releasing a chaptered version like with books 1-4?
,Scribblur,2011-07-30T22:41Z,"hate to do this to the uploader, but found a chapterized version with maps too ...
