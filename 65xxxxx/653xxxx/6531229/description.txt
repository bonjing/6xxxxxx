The film focuses on the stories about four relationships and their trials, pains, heartaches, and subsequent separations. The plot lines eventually connect in some way, but they remain unrelated for the most part.
The film was a relative success, with just over a million admissions in South Korea.[2] It also received a strong showing in Japan, mostly thanks to the popularity of lead actor Jung Woo-sung.
