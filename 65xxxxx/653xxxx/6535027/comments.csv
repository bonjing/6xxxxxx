You say that the Antichrist has not arrived yet, although any day he may show.  One of the implications of 2 Thes 2.3 is that the Antichrist will already be upon the world scene, before his actual identity becomes known.  By 'known' here, there are several possibilities: 1) the body of Christ will in general know who it is, or 2) a minority but threshold level of awareness will be reached within the body of Christ, or 3) those within the body of Christ who have doctrinal purity and who engage in serious study of the prophetic word will have consensus, whether publicly or unspoken, as to who it is.

There are several Scriptural ways to help determine, or piece together the puzzle, as to who the Antichrist is, but the primary method is given in Revelation 13, and the one to be identified will also fit all the other characteristics given in the Bible.

I believe this has already been done by some and also i will pursue verification of what i have seen.  Once an individual knows, it becomes obligatory to share that important information, and this may very well trigger an economic collapse.  Let the chips fall where they may; the truth shall be told.  There are a few things that must be done both to edify the body of Christ and to help those who will remain after the Rapture, and you are one of them whom God is using mightily in that regard.

Amos 3.7  ""Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but He revealeth His secret unto His servants the prophets.""

The Lord always tells to a remnant what He will do, before He does it.  After this remnant pronounces what the Lord has to say and is rejected, then the Lord does what He had said He will do.

The Antichrist is already upon the earth, and i will be detailing with the mathematical calculation, exactly who it is, in the near future.

The day of the LORD is very near."
