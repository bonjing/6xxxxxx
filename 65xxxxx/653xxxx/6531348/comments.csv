I've seen a few repeats uploaded where the original is still being seeded. Just thought I'd make you aware so you could save some bandwidth. Thank you for all the ups- even if doubles."
[T],skJGZV6z,2012-05-13T06:51Z,"@bnyst, they have the same title, and are on the same subject but do have different exemplary content. It seems, as of my writing, that revisiting ""The Road to Serfdom"" is something of an annual theme for Stossel. However, thanks for your comment: folks coming here after seeing Stossel's 20120510 show on ""Serfdom"" now have an express link to a third program on this.

20100211 - The Road to Serfdom
20110707 - On the Road to Serfdom
20120510 - On the Road to Serfdom 2"
