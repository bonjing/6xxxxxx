,ThailandAtoZ,2011-10-04T21:32Z,"This is the Trail Version - No Transcoding available, a feature that is disabled in the Trail"
,President_Kush,2012-01-16T12:29Z,"it is not a trial version as ThailandAtoZ said, nor is it a ""FULL"" version as RedDr4gon's description says, but rather an OEM version.  Manufacturers include this with DLNA certified devices.  (e.g. my LG tv came with this software)  It does requires a KEY but it is auto-inserted You can download a newer version as well from within the program.  

ThailandAtoZ was correct about NO transcoding though.  "
