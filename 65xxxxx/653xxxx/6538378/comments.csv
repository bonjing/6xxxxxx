,somjelly1,2011-09-05T09:43Z,@malle_melle: no it is not possible 2 upload MW2 multiplayer because 1) this game is not native to mac and 2) its cracked and 3) if u connect 2 the internet with MW2 it jacks it up and 4) i mean come on its pirated wat do u expect infinity ward and activision r jst gonna let you play multiplayer... they hav filters and its impossilble 2 get MW2 multiplayer im srry tho but try to look around and if u find sumthing tell me
