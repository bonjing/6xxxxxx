Here's a tough one you might be able to answer. On CFNY during the 1980s and early '90s they used an instrumental track as a backdrop during all of their remote broadcasts--events and sponsor sales. Does anyone know what that piece of music was?"
,80spreferred,2011-08-15T21:38Z,Thanks for this too.  The artwork for this era of music is so cool and unique hehehe.  I don't know of any of it to offend people like some of today's covers.
