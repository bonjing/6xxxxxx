Instructions
==================
To watch the DVD, mount the ISO file using DAEMON Tools or your favourite optical media emulation software.

If you would like to create a disc that can be played in a stand-alone DVD player, you can open the ISO file in DVD Shrink and compress the DVD data so that it will fit on a standard blank DVD.
You can also search the Internet for instructions on burning to a Double Layer DVD for better quality.

Important Message
==================
HELP STOP THE SPREAD OF CHRISTIANITY

SNSD and many other K-Pop artists are being used to spread Christianity across Asia.
Tell record labels such as SM Entertainment to stop allowing their artists to be used to promote other people's religious and political agendas.

If you are a Christian, I urge you to embark on a journey of serious, extensive, open-minded research about the Bible and Christianity.
You have not been told the truth.
