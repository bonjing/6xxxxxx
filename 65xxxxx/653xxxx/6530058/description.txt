Not the best bootleg from this late Hang Cool Tour but nevertheless it has some great material. This is a combination of performances at the Summerfest event of Milwaukee on June 29th, 2011 and from Summerfest Charlottetown, Canada from July 2nd, 2011. The video isn't of very high quality and the audio is just okay. Quite a few songs are incomplete but especially Two Out of Three looks and sounds very nice. Paradise is again major fun. This impression of Meat's summer tour of 2011 gets 2 out of 5 stars.
