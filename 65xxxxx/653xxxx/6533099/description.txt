 Photonic Microresonator Research and Applications explores advances in the fabrication process that enable nanometer waveguide separations. The technology surrounding the design and fabrication of optical microresonators has matured to a point where there is a need for commercialization. Consequently, there is a need for device research involving more advanced architectures and more esoteric operating princples.
 Photonic Microresonator Research and Applications would appeal to researchers and academics working in the optical sciences.

 This volume discusses these issues, while also:
 -Showing a reader how to design and fabricate microresonators
 -Discussing microresonators in photonic crystals, microsphere circuits, and sensors, and provides application oriented examples
 -Covering the latest in microresonator research with contributions from the leading researchers

 Photonic Microresonator Research and Applications would appeal to researchers and academics working in the optical sciences.
