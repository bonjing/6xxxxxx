ALBUM INFO(from wikipedia)

God He Reigns is the fourteenth album in the live praise and worship series of Christian Contemporary music by Hillsong Church. A single-disc version of this album was released in the USA by Integrity Media.

Making of the album

God He Reigns was recorded live at the Sydney Entertainment Centre on 27 February 2005 by Darlene Zschech and the Hillsong team with a congregation of 10,500. God He Reigns was released at the annual Hillsong Conference in July.

Chart success

God He Reigns reached #2 on the Australian album charts and the DVD hit #1. Initially, there was doubt as to the commercial success of the album as the release coincided with the release of new albums by Guy Sebastian and Paulini, but in that week more copies of God He Reigns were sold than every other CD in Australia combined (including pop charts, alternative, rock, et cetera).
