,dragontoo,2011-07-12T23:41Z,"after i put pw, busycal freezes so that i have to force quite and restore it from time-M. does anybody have the same problem or any solution, please?"
[V],polisdavid,2011-07-13T00:07Z,"dragontoo,

Sorry about you problem dragontoo, worked fine on my end - maybe if you use a busycal2 sn it won't happen - did you try that from the keygen?

DP"
,dragontoo,2011-07-13T01:10Z,"i did use the sn from keygene. i even unstalled the busycal using appledelete and reinstall them using the ones you posted. btw, should i use little snitch to block it first?"
,LiaFlia,2011-07-13T01:15Z,"Even though I didn't get BusyCal from this particular link, the exact same thing happens to me. Busycal is fine once it's in trial mode, but once I use one of the serial numbers, it completely freezes and I have to Force Quit."
,tuvokk,2011-07-13T05:07Z,Thanks. This is a good tool.
[V],polisdavid,2011-07-13T07:25Z,"Thank you for addressing this ""freezing"" problem, but I can't seem to reproduce it

Maybe you should stick with the previous version.

[V],polisdavid,2011-07-13T07:25Z,"Oh yes, you should always bolck hacked software with little snitch."
,cezzione,2011-07-13T11:35Z,"when blocking wth LS buzycal reacts with ""cannot check serial number"" and quits; did not have that prob with 1.5.1 so i returned to that version"
,zhaowu,2011-07-21T03:39Z,The serial code generated is not working. 
,splurf,2011-07-24T15:58Z,Works Great!!!  Easy.  Thanks a bunch for this program.  Much better than ical.
,forunsd,2011-07-25T04:20Z,"SN does not work. PLEASE, add another generator."
,techpixie,2012-06-04T22:21Z,SNs all rejected--can we get a new keygen?
,shaltac,2012-06-05T07:27Z,"BusyCal suddenly asks for me to stop blocking so that they can validate SN. Where are the files on my Mac that prompt this, and how to stop and not have this validation trick?"
