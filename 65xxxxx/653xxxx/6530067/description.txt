Anime Hero 1 is a modified version of Guitar Hero 2 with (custom songs) there's four Anime Heroes that were made and i plan on uploading them all as i dont see any of them on tpb 

Note: I did not make this nor do i know who did so even if i wanted to give credit to them i couldn't anyway i'm just uploading it because it wasn't on here and i figured people would like to have this so enjoy i had fun playing this part 2 is even better to me though.

Important Info: On all the Anime Heroes except for #4 they have a glitch where the game freezes unless you skip the opening/intro so make sure when the opening starts playing you skip it you'll see what i mean if you don't.

This game is NTSC and is esr patched already. Oh and by the way the game is in English&Portuguese if im not mistaken.
