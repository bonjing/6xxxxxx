        Season 4, Episode 15: A Bird in the Hand

        Ronald Pitts wants to buy  Tom Abbott's farm, but the  old man
        does not  want to  sell. One  morning his  sheep have been let
        loose.  Furthermore   Kate  Rowan   suspects  that   there  is
        brucellosis on his farm,  because a young girl,  Jane Shields,
        has caught  the disease  apparently by  drinking unpasteurized
        milk from one of his  cows. Greengrass is going to  church. He
        has not become a holy man though, but he tries to get a reward
        for finding  a lost  heir and  wants to  look into  the church
        records.  PC Ventress  still has  not quite  got the  hang of
        driving. On a  nightly patrol he  parks his police  car in the
        middle of  a river  trying to  avoid a  flock of  sheep on the
        road. When he  leaves the car  to get help  he hears an  eerie
        scream.
