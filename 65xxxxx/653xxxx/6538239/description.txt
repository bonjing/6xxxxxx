Unfinished Business DVDRip [2011].avi

Joel (Kris Slater) is away at university just getting ready for midterms when he gets a surprise visit from his old partner in crime Lana (Kirsten Price). This of course can mean nothing but trouble for Joel. Before you can say 'I just failed Algebra' Lana and Joel are back in business, and the news is spreading fast. The whole campus wants what Joel is selling, and are willing to pay for it... big time. Lana and her girls (Alektra Blue, Asa Akira, Misty Stone and host of other beauties) are more than happy to give the student body a taste of their 'private tutoring' sessions. Joel is having the time of his life, or so he thinks, but he quickly learns that all good things cum to an end. Now it's time for Joel to take care of some 'Unfinished Business'. Cause sometimes you just gotta say WTF! ( Want To Fuck? )
