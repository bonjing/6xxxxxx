,bert16,2011-07-16T00:47Z,"varunstein: I don't know about this proggie yet 'cause I'm leeching it now, but with Auto Hide if you uncheck all the shit that appears in the installation, the Ask toolbar won't appear. Even if it does (it happened to me once) Your! Uninstaller can easily get rid of it."
,pilot12,2011-07-30T03:57Z,"To avoid the Ask toolbar, you need to uncheck everything. I've encoutered the same problem some weeks ago, I installed the program and this fucking Ask toolbar poped up everywhere.

At the next release, I carefully read everything and discovered I forgot to untick one choice. There are 3 if my memory is good, so untick all of them.

At first I let one because I didn't carefully read and thought it was mandatory to continu installation and activate the ""next"" button. It was a mistake."
