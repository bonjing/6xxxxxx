     Could the chemicals found in marijuana prevent and even heal several deadly cancers? Could the tumor-regulating properties of â€œcannabinoidsâ€ someday replace the debilitating drugs, chemotherapy, and radiation that harms as often as it heals?
     Discover the truth about this ancient medicine as world-renowned scientists in the field of cannabinoid research illustrate their truly mind-blowing discoveries in this feature-length documentary.
     Using original and archival footage, the film presents controversial but highly convincing evidence that this forbidden herb has healing properties beyond any other plant on the planetâ€” interacting as it does with the bodyâ€™s own â€œendocannabinoid systemâ€ to keep us fit and disease-free.
     â€œWhat if Cannabis Cured Cancerâ€ explains how we are all born with a form of marijuana already in our bodies, and when pot is consumed, the â€œendocannabinoidsâ€ inside usâ€”along with any cannabinoids we ingestâ€”fit together like a key in a lock. Thereby promoting the death of cancer cells without harming the bodyâ€™s healthy cells.
     Like the old parable of the beggar who was sitting on a treasure chest but never bothered to look inside, governments and the medical establishment have been slow to realize the miraculous anti-cancer properties of marijuana. Finally, in this extraordinary documentary, the truth comes out.
     A powerful and eye-opening film about the future of cannabisâ€”and perhaps even the future of medicine. Written and directed by BBC filmmaker Len Richmond. Narrated by Emmy-winning actor Peter Coyote. Featuring interviews with...

"What if Cannabis Cured Cancer summarizes the remarkable research findings of recent years about the cancer-protective effects of novel compounds in marijuana.  Most medical doctors are not aware of this information and its implications for prevention and treatment. If we need more evidence that our current policy on cannabis is counterproductive and foolish, here it is. An excellent film. "
