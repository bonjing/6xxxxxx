"Claudio Abbado is one of those rare conductors who seem to get more youthful and enquiring with age, while at the same time his music-making takes on an ever greater profundity.â€
--Daily Telegraph, London

On this fantastic, critically acclaimed recording of Beethovensâ€™ greatest masterpiece, Claudio Abbado leads the Berlin Philharmonic through a performance of such nuance, such tumultuous emotion, that itâ€™s difficult to imagine thereâ€™s a better way to hear this massively influential piece of music. Abbado is widely considered to be one of the most virtuosic and important conductors of the 20th and 21st centuries: in addition to winning two Grammy Awards, he holds four honorary doctorates, the Imperial Prize of Japan, and the French Legion of Honour among many other honors. Add that to one of the worldâ€™s premiere orchestras performing one of the most important compositions of all time, and a stunning high resolution audio recording, and you have an absolutely essential addition to your music collection.
