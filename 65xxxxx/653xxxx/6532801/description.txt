  Important:
  ~~~~~~~
  
  We have done extensive testing on our releases. We ripped them atleast twice 
  on 2 different Consoles and crc compared both rips. It occasionally happened,
  that crc's and number of files were different. We blame that partly on the early
  stage of Backup Manager, but also on the fat32 filesytem.
  So be sure your own private rips are working properly - especially if you 
  plan to release them!
  
  Some games won't start if you have old gamedata on your console. So delete
  that if neccessary!

  This dump was made using the PSGROOVE (PSJailbreak) method using Backup 
  Manager 1.0 . We have tested quite a few old PS3 Scene Rips which mostly
  didnt work correctly (empty/corrupted or missing files etc..). 
  
  To warm you up until you receive your jailbreak device we'll
  bring you a few PS3 exclusive and some major cross platform titles
  to get things going.
    
  Unrar contents to an external fat32 formatted usb drive into a
  folder called GAMEZ (in root dir), connect it to your PS3, use 
  your usbkey to get it into service mode and play from the external drive.
  Make sure you have an original ps3 game in your drive (any game will do).

  Notes:
  ~~~~~~~
  
  Be aware that fat32 filesystem can't deal with files bigger than 4gb. So
  some Games can't be ripped to an external hdd - only to the internal ps3
  hdd. As soon as more tools are available, we might change the format (e.g. 
  using some form of containers like .iso etc..) Time will tell :)
