[T],AntiSecurity,2011-07-11T23:42Z,"CORRECTION:

Password hashes are not MD5 but mostly BASE64(sha1(password)); some other hashes may be mixed in. Happy cracking."

,anthonygr,2011-07-12T15:43Z,Anonymous hit the greece government 
,googlybug,2011-07-12T16:05Z,Lol. ;))
,strongnc21,2011-07-12T17:26Z,"Reveailing secret government plans detailing how to be bastards and control the world?  Very cool.  Exposing usernames, passwords, and social security numbers of innocent people?  Not cool.

You claim to be Hacktivists, but so far, all I've seen are Anarchists.  You can be a force for good in this world - battling tyranny, fighting injustice, shining spotlights into dark corners.  Hurting innocent bystanders, though, is only hurting yourselves."
,yotomyo,2011-07-12T22:34Z,lol what a bunch of grade A pussies. i know that doesn't mean much to you because you're probably a 1000 miles from me. which is good for your sake because i'd fucking beat your face in if i ever saw you. don't ever hack the PSN again. or any other gaming company for that matter! low life losers. i can't wait for them to catch you. it's gonna be HILARIOUS. 
,yotomyo,2011-07-12T22:37Z,"i actually find this funny also.
your ""slogan"" lmfao.

""We are Anonymous.
We are Legion.
We are Antisec.
We do not forgive.
We do not forget.
Expect us.""

""we are legion"" sounds like something from the game fallout new vegas. ""we do not forgive, we do not forget"" sounds like something from the Mafia. and the rest is just total hilarious. bunch of pansy ass losers LMFAO"
,weak_algro,2011-07-13T04:21Z,Sounds like a few people who do not know how to research before they make comments are butthurt lmfao. I have a warm feeling inside right now watching you write your heart out on a napkin.

,spielberg101,2011-07-13T19:31Z,"Hey yotomyo why not use that big book with lots of words in your Mom gave you last month. You know the dicktionary (intentionally misspelt there) - Webster's for Grade 5. Try looking up adverb. .... your English is ""totalLY"" juvenile. I'd expect better from a bright 10 year old."

,Hokrollo,2011-07-13T23:44Z,"Thank you very much for once again making life more sad and difficult for everybody but yourself. What a wonderful word we live in...

If you want to hack peope, keep it inside anonymous please."
,H8ckt1v1st,2011-07-14T00:55Z,"@strongnc21-when you work for one of these companies you are not innocent. You are working for the wrong people, and perhaps orchestrating or directing the very wrongs they are guilty of.
@yotomo-you have no idea what you are talking about. Do your homework."

They sure are full of themselves. Sigh. Fat sweaty nerds..."
,aobo11,2011-07-25T21:12Z,"@yotomyo
Call me well informed but, im fairly sure lulzsec hacked psn. Just a hunch, but the fact that they admitted they did it and released a few thousand peoples info to prove it is kind of making me think that.
Honestly even if they didnt admit it i wouldent expect anonymous to ever go that far."
,CplMajor,2011-08-10T03:19Z,"What sucks is that I'm a Legion supporter. The reason this sucks is because myself and a friend of mine from the military work for this company. 
On behalf of our wives and kids I say for the both of us, ""Thanks.""
You, of course, have no reason to believe me. No more reason than to believe any person who showed up back in the day of the Scientology protests wearing Guy Fawkes masks when they said they were part of ""legion"" or ""Anon"". 

By doing what you have you've hurt one of your own /b/rothers. If we start to turn on ourselves without regard, what is the point of working ""together""?
We tell people to expect us. We never expect to be hit by our own. I might be able to forgive fellow /b/rothers, but I sure as hellfire won't forget. "
