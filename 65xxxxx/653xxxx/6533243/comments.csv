,cyem,2011-07-12T04:04Z,How are we supposed to use this? It's not a normal ipsw..
,Joshuajjc,2011-07-12T06:04Z,"this zip file caused me a lot of problems (OS X)
Don't remove the .zip
Unzip it.
In OS X after it unzips it will automatically unzip again (unzipping the ipsw) cancel and you will be left with the working ipsw"

,flash9887,2011-07-12T15:11Z,"how do u put the ios beta on to ur iphone 4?

please help"
,pnewseqqq,2011-07-12T21:28Z,"yo flash9887-
First you need your UID registered with apple. You will find no shortage of people on TPB offering this service for $2-5. Check the other beta torrents. 

2nd, you need to have iTunes 10.5 beta 3. Again, a torrent on this site.

3rd, you need to unzip this file, and from itunes, shift+click restore, select the file you just unzipped, voila.

*Note- Ensure you sync your contacts to your PC if you have any computer illiteracy whatsoever"
