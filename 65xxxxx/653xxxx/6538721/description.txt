Shortest version is the best one according to Andrei Tarkovsky


"Nobody has ever cut anything from Andrei Rublov. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In the first version the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long (192:00 PAL). In the second â€” 3 hours 15 minutes (187:12 PAL). I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes (178:34 PAL). I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance."
