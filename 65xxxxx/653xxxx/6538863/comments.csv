,TheLastSon,2011-07-17T15:49Z,SEED PLEASE HOW ARE WE EXPECTED TO DOWNLOAD IF YOU DON'T UPLOAD WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE ON THIS SITE LATELY? 
,MrJumper,2011-07-17T20:24Z,"I've been seeding since I uploaded, the trackers are screwed up, so it says that there arent seeders when there are, I had a thread on superbay to find this out, so I'm not just talking smack.But there does seem to be a lot of downloaders that just download then remove and not seed.
I seed till I see at least 20 other seeders before I remove it from my Bit Torrent to make room for new ones."
,MrJumper,2011-07-28T18:44Z,"Come on guys, I've seen over 50 leechers on multiple torrents at different times, and yet they do not have the courtesy to seed for at least a day after downloading, thats just not right people !!!"
,McMerda,2012-03-31T03:00Z,maybe some of us dont like to be tracked :P
,theonlydj,2012-06-14T16:13Z,I'll seed for ever!!!!!!!!!!
