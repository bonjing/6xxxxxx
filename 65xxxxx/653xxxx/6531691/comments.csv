,zootalaws,2011-07-11T23:06Z,"Thanks. There's another 9000-odd where they came from - just working my way through them, cleaning them up, cataloguing them, etc.

If there's anything particular you are after..."
,tuvokk,2011-07-12T10:16Z,"Thanks!

We live in a great time, to have easy access to so many books, and to be able to take them with us anywhere in a small electronic device.

Read and learn, the more you know the less they can manipulate you!"

,LynnW98,2011-09-14T19:33Z,"Hi, I can help buy Kindle ebooks, only $5 a book! Please email me if you're interested. Lynn_w98 at live dot com."
,zootalaws,2011-10-10T14:39Z,"@DalittleBIGmen you don't need to put it in your Kindle account - from your Kindle app on your android device, just 'open' the file.

But... I think you should look at Calibre - best e-book management utility out there. I have a Mac, but he has a PC version as well.

@LynnW98 I prefer to share books for free rather than sell them - go peddle your wares somewhere else, scumbag."
,zootalaws,2011-10-10T14:50Z,"@OsageBetty - sorry, don't have it.
@SuziB52 - Sorry, don't have any of his
@Jed989 - sorry, no Susan Lewis, but I have Diane Chamberlain in my 'Suspense' collection."

,zootalaws,2011-10-22T18:28Z,"Sorry, none of hers."
