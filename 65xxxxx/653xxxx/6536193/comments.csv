[V],catflap,2011-07-13T02:30Z,"I prefer 350MB xvid files.

I waited over a week for a scene release but there was none so I made this myself to upload for the people who also prefer smaller files."
,neeliesu,2011-07-14T12:33Z,"Thank you very much!  I've been waiting anxiously for a torrent I could play on my DIVX. Already have the first 5 episodes which play OK, but couldn't play the final episode because it was a matroska video file. Really appreciate you doing this :)"
[V],catflap,2011-07-14T13:03Z,"you can always re-encode mtk files to
xvid, divx, mp4, and others with free
software if you get files you can't watch
on your standalone player.

I recommend Freemake Video Converter. It's
what I use when AutoGK doesn't work.

Freemake Video Downloader can also download
and convert files from youtube and many
other streaming sites.

They are both free, easy to use, no spyware, adware, or malware and the developer always
replies to emails.

PS: you can also invest in a cheap dvd player
which plays mtk, mp4, and other uncommon
codecs.

you can google for it."
,neeliesu,2011-07-14T13:46Z,"Thanks for that info catflap, I'm always learning :)"
[V],catflap,2011-07-14T14:42Z,"no problem. we all start learning at some point. :)

just to be clear to anyone reading this:
this file IS NOT a re-encode of the larger
matroska scene release file from last week.

it is my own recording and encode.
i used AutoGK for the encoding process.

@neeliesu:

to learn a lot more, go to videohelp.com
where you'll find message boards, tutorials,
and links to tons of free software."

[V],catflap,2011-07-17T22:08Z,"yea i dunno why there was no
scene release of 350MB. i often
record BBC, ITV, Ch4 shows just
in case a scene release goes missing
or is corrupted, or the group has some
other problem. so I didn't mind doing
this one. i always get the scene files
and then delete my own recordings.

so that's why i held onto this one for a
week before posting it in case the scene
file turned up in that time."
