Charlie Parker attracted young musicians like a magnet.
Among them was trombonist Jimmy Knepper, who, at a time when tape recording was a brand new thing, captured Bird in flight one winter night in Manhattan.He soared and when Charlie Mingus heard the music years later, he issues it as his first release on his new Jazz Workshop label.Since then many private recordings of Parker have been made public. This was one of the first and remains one of the best, a precious musical document
