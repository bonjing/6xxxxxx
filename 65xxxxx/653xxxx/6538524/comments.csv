,anythingless,2011-07-13T23:37Z,"can maherz or even u guys tell me whats the advantage of these updates
i mean any major advantages cause as far as i know i ran both my Xp3 2009 edition without updates n a few latest with updates i dont see much difference
This is not just my question i would assume a lot of em share the same concerns

thanks"
,DarthBubba,2011-07-14T00:24Z,@anythingless:  Maher adds SATA drivers (which XP does not install straight-out-of-the-box) so that you can install XP w/o needing to have a floppy disk on-hand to load the drivers (the F6 key  problem) during the initial installation.  He also pre-installs the license so you don't have to go find it.  He deletes some useless WinApps and adds a newer one.  I don't know if he includes the dual core CPU patch.  The rest of the updates and patches simply keep your installation more secure.  He's just saving you the trouble of repeatedly downloading the same updates when you do lots of re-installs as many of us experimenters do.  If his version of XP runs about like your unpatched version consider yourself lucky - or smart enough to install good protection software.  Maher is doing us a favor - we should all thank him every time he makes an updated copy of XP available for download.  He saves a lot of people a lot of time by doing that.
,DarthBubba,2011-07-14T00:25Z,Thank You Maher!  :-)
,mEmOkIrI,2011-07-14T02:38Z,"well said ""DarthBubba"" ... this fucking SATA is a pain in the ass and because of guys like ""maher"" we are over that headache but i have a couple of requests if you may add with next releases hopefully in August ...!
if you may add general modem and VGA driver with general Audio driver beside SATA, it would mean the world to some of us whom are still suffering from these out of date products!

thnx a million and keep it up m80"

it's easy to make it boot from usb with win7, just a little flawless program like ultraISO and so, it will run till finished.

but with xp, only this program work (for me)

than u'r usb had MBR error, u must fix it first.

To clean MBR:
-open WinSetupFromUSB
-click RMPrepUSB, find ""clean"" button, run till finish
-after MBR cleared, click ""install grub4dos"" button

To burn:
-from 3 boot options, choose winpev2/winpev3 blabla
-from 4 FS & overrides, choose ""Boot as HDD"" and use ""64hd/32sec""
-now click ""6Prepare drive"", run till finish and exit RMPREPUSB.
-back to Main GUI, and choose win200/xp/2003setup. and choose the drive that had Mahers iso loaded in virtual drive.
-click option ""Test in qemu""
-Go

Don't unpack and burn! This is what you're doing wrong!
You have to burn the image as it is.
Search your burning software for something like ""burn image file"" and then locate the file you downloaded that looks like a RAR file.

Is your CD/DVD ROM set as the first boot device in BIOS?
If no, then set it.

No, not true. certainly u CAN mod ur XPx86 multiple of times using nLite.
I've done it. U just need to know what exactly u're doing, dat's all. Don't 
just go blindly removing windows components.

These are summary of different XPx86 i've modded using Maherz's XPx86 as base..


1- XPx86v3.0SATARAID_full -
full blown XPx86 for use of regular people

iso size = 492MB
C drive size after install without virtual memory, system restore = 851MB

2- XPx86AkuMod_v2.2SATARAID - 
futher mod without system restore

iso size = 323MB
C drive size after install without virtual memory, system restore = 629MB

3- XPx86_GamingMod_v1.1 -
For gamerz only, all driver removed except SATARAID & LAN, most of XP useless
components removed highest XP performance, not suitiable for regular use, not
for average pakcik makcik. Only for Gaming!

iso size = 178MB
C drive size after install without virtual memory, system restore = 486MB"

 I got Toshiba laptop with vista and thinking to go for XP.  I understood that the setting in the bios must be changed, right?
Where can I find the AHCI or IDE mode in the Bios and what must I change? I just can‚Äôt find it. "

u CAN update officially from M$, no prob  updates. ""No need 2 be afraid be radical.""

@kingsteve2002

Use nero tu burn. I burn using fastest speed available be it 16x all the way to 40x depending on CDs and DVDwriter. Never had any prob. ""No need 2 be afraid be radical.""

,clissold345,2011-08-13T14:46Z,"This is a good torrent. Thanks to Maherz for providing it!

For anyone who isn't sure what to do: you burn a CD from the ISO file and then you do a fresh install of Windows.

If you have a wireless card in your computer but Windows doesn't list the available wireless networks then you probably need to go to the website of your computer manufacturer and download and install wireless drivers. Then (hopefully) Windows will list the available wireless networks."
,r3b,2011-08-13T18:08Z,"This is NOT GOOD.
It does include a lot of SATA drivers but a very common one, which is included even in older XP versions is missing - the driver for the Nforce 410 chipset.
My WD sata drive on an Asus K8N-VM with Nfroce 6100 chipset (Nforce410 southbridge) is not recognized by windows setup with this disc.
I've tried again with a very old Student Edition not even SP1 and of course the drive is recognized.
I'm glad I've burnt this on a RW DVD.

I appreciate the effort, but -at least this time- the result is bad."

,voronin,2011-08-22T03:35Z,"Maher, I realize you have the little TRUSTED icon next to your username, but I have to call you out on this one.

-- as someone previously mentioned, IE (which you removed and then added a different version) is very corrupt. There is no title-bar text, no menus, right-clicking does not work, downloading files does not work, and 9/10 times it crashes. your response to them was (paraphrased) ""LOL IDK MAYBE YOU HAVE VIRUS"".  If you are such l33t h4xx0r that you make your own customized crack of XP then you should at least be aware that the IE you admittedly fucked around with is a corrupt piece of shit, and not blame ""viruses"".
-- After poking around in the system settings, I found some interesting things. There is a shared folder called ""C:\WINDOWS.0"" which is given remote admin access. Now I'm more of a Linux person so I may not understand exactly how Windows does remote access, but this looks to me like a huge security risk. One that is compounded by the suspicious behavior of IE (which, by preventing downloads, ensures that it is the only browser you can use), and the fact that Windows Firewall is turned off by default.

Now I'm not claiming that you are knowingly releasing a corrupted version of XP that is being used by someone as a vector for spyware, trojans, identity theft, or other sinister hacking purposes. That would be beyond my level of technical expertise and willingness to investigate the matter further.  All I'm saying is that I am going to look for a different torrent, one that contains the stock, retail version of XP with no shadowy ""integrations"" that make it behave in a suspicious manner, and I urge anyone who has enough braincells to be disturbed by the problems with this release to do the same."
