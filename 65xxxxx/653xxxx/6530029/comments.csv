,Rod321,2011-08-06T00:45Z,"Hi rahulro,
Thank you very much for this it is working good. I had tried several other 26 versions without success.

I did try loading it over version 24 & it didn't take, I uninstalled version 24 & a message advised I would have to remove some remnant files. I tried to install again without removing remnants & failed again however this time the uninstall gave me the option to tick a box to remove all history from version 24 which I did & then 26 installed in seconds & I am currently scanning.

I just found that it won't auto start on Login, Scheduler won't work & Defrag Registry stops the program & Windows advises that it will send a fix if it finds one.

I have Vista

I just reinstalled version 24 & everything is working.

I note that version 24 is embedded in the Registry where as Version 26 is not. I don't know much about these things but perhaps if it is not in the registry auto start & schedule won't work.

Thank you very much anyway.
The Portable has  appeal but I'll stick with 24 & everything working for now."
