 This book provides axioms of partial order and some basic material, for example consequences of â€œcriss-crossingâ€ of data profiles, the role of aggregations of the indicators and the powerful method of formal concept analysis. The interested reader will learn how to apply fuzzy methods in partial order analysis and what â€˜antagonistic indicatorâ€™ means.
