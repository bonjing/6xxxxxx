Howards.End.1992.1080p.BluRay.DTS.x264-CHD ?
"
[V],DownTYU,2011-07-11T00:11Z,In half an hour...
[V],DownTYU,2011-07-11T00:13Z,not chd
,elitenoobboy,2011-07-11T01:17Z,Why does the listed resolution say 1920x800? Shouldn't that be 1080?
,elitenoobboy,2011-07-11T01:19Z,Actually nvm. For some reason I was expecting it to have full 1080 even with its extra long aspect ratio.
,jey7db9,2011-07-11T01:40Z,What is the difference between this and that: /torrent/6472333/The.Lord.Of.The.Rings.Extended.Editions.Trilogy.1080p.BluRay.x26  (?)
,bg3867,2011-07-11T01:44Z,@jey7db9..that one is a WiKi encode and this is CHD
,jey7db9,2011-07-11T02:11Z,Which is better? Because I download first torr and have 1/3
,bg3867,2011-07-11T12:58Z,"@jey7db9..they are both good...if you already have 1/3 of the Wiki, finish downloading that one"
,X45JKD,2011-07-11T16:34Z,"Thanks!

Note: The Wiki edition's audio is slightly out of sync. Haven't tested the CHD edition yet but am hoping it's better than the Wiki."
,omnimodis,2011-07-11T21:40Z,"@X45JKD - I have finished downloading all 3 and already watched them, and the audio is not out of sync with the video at any spot in any of the 3 files.  The subtitles are out of sync though.  Maybe that's what you meant?"
,omnimodis,2011-07-11T21:41Z,^^^ I mean the Wiki editions are fine - the audio is not out of sync!
,Luckmann,2011-07-22T00:38Z,Does this one have proper subs? The release posted by Insinuendo is trash and there's still no word on a PROPER.
,afr126,2011-08-05T20:58Z,Where can i find the subtitles? 
,tenkre1,2011-08-20T01:49Z,could you guys please do CHD of LED ZEPPELIN SONG REMAINS THE SAME. PLEASE

,Coldblackice,2012-04-15T15:08Z,"Does anyone know what font is used for the retail's hardcoded subs? I'm in the process of making a tutorial on how to encode your own hardcoded subs into this release (for Elvish/English parts), but I also want to show how to style the subs so that they appear with the pretty font/lettering from the movies.

Anyone know what fonts are used? Anyone have any screenshots of the fonts from the retail versions?"
,afr126,2012-06-03T01:44Z,"thanks hauntnut, i had the subs for the whole movie, but i only needed for the non-english parts. Your subs worked perfectly, thanks again. "
,afr126,2012-06-03T02:03Z,"If you start downloading this and you see no files and all the peers with 0.0%, don't worry, the torrent will kick in in like 5 minutes or so. this torrent works 100%. its the best version if u don't want to download the 200 something GB EPIC package from DownTYU. Be patient and ENJOY!! BTW, if u want the subs just look a few comments up :D."
