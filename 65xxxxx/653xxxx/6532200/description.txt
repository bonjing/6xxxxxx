 Information Technology in Biomedicine is an interdisciplinary research area, that bridges the gap between tethodological achievements in engineering and clinical requirements in medical diagnosis and therapy. In this book, members of the academic society of technical and medical background present their research results and clinical implementation in order to satisfy the functional requirements of authorized physicians for the benefit of the patients. An extended area is covered by the articles. It includes biomedical signals, medical image processing, computer-aided diagnosis and surgery, biometrics, healthcare and telemedicine, biomechanics, biomaterials, bioinformatics. Section on bronchoscopy presents the basis as well as new research studies performed in this field. Papers present various theoretical approaches and new methodologies based on fuzzy sets, mathematical statistics, mathematical morphology, fractals, wavelets, syntactic methods, artificial neural networks, graphs and many others.
