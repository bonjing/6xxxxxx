TORRENT CONTAINS AVI AND M4V FORMATS

The Day of the Rope is more than just a skate video. 

Make no mistakes, it does contain the best footage of the best rollerbladers in the world, but its purpose is greater than just that. Consider the best Senate riders, not just as the best team or rollerbladers ever assembled on the face of the Earth, but also as messengers of a new era. With the release of this video begins the official countdown to THE DAY OF THE ROPE. So to any-one who has ever crossed a rollerblader, beware. To anyone who has ever raised a fist, shouted an insult or even so much as directed a dis-approving look towards a rollerblader, your days are numbered. We are gathering our troops. Our numbers are already strong, and they are growing. To rollerbladers, this is a call to arms... To everyone else, this is a warning... THE DAY OF THE ROPE IS COMING.
