""nuking refers to rejecting, deleting or simply recommending people don't download that particular file. There are plenty of reasons for this, but in the video side of things, files are often nuked because they're out of sync (that is, the audio isn't sychronized with the video), are badly cropped (sometimes people zoom in on the video source and end up losing a fair bit of visual material), are incorrectly encoded or use bad codecs (these are more technical issues to do with how large video data files are shrunk down for distribution) or even are just poor quality.

@hahahafr

It is Watchable..Definitely Bluray.But small Problem at 12m18s..

The proper version will be released on 26-07-2011"
