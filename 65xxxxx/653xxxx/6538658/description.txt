[b]Summary[/b]

Is there ever a case for pornography, or should it be totally off-limits in an ethical society? Feminist anti-pornography activist Gail Dines spars with gender politics advisor Catharine Lumby in this heated session at Sydney Writers Festival.

[b]Detailed Program Description[/b]

UK feminist Gail Dines was easily one of the most controversial and talked-about guests at this year's Sydney Writers Festival. During her visit to Australia, Dines won supporters and enemies in equal measure with her hardcore pronouncements against porn.

In the Sydney Writers Festival session called "Porn Wars", there was a heated stand-off between Dines and local feminist academics Catharine Lumby and Leslie Cannold. Also on the stage was memoirist and former sex worker Kate Holden. The subject for discussion was: "Is there ever a case for pornography, or should it be totally off-limits in an ethical society?"
