Product Description
From Academy AwardÂ®-winning director Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire) comes the powerfully uplifting true story of one manâ€™s struggle to survive against mountainous odds. Aron Ralston (James Franco) has a passion for all things outdoors. But when a falling boulder traps him in a remote Utah canyon, a thrill-seekerâ€™s adventure becomes the challenge of a lifetime. Over the next five days, Ralston embarks on a remarkable personal journey in which he relies on the memories of family and friends--as well as his own courage and ingenuity--to turn adversity into triumph!
