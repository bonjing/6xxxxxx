No you cant. Its quite easily to install just go to the forums and everything is there that you will need. All you have to do is read the simple directions so you can start encoding your stuff ;)"

[V],jainmehul,2011-07-12T06:10Z,"I don't get it,i downloaded the rar file HR provided on ubuntuforums for ripping,but all it contains are some txt files,What do i do with it??"
,albert2172,2011-07-12T07:44Z,"@jainmehul

They are scripts files jainmehul and it only works on LINUX and Mac PC.

It used ffmpeg to encode any video (any format) to the desire present.

1st Step - do you have a linux or mac
2nd Step - Install ffmpeg
3rd Step - copy encode-handheld.pl to ""/usr/local/bin'
4th Step - Copy Atomic Parsley to ""/usr/local/bin""
5th Step - Open terminal and type in 'encode-handheld.pl'

This should create a Folder on your Desktop, its where the encoded stuff goes into.

jainmehul - Its a Command Line Interface CLI so there is NO graphic interface.

If you need anymore help on how to install encode-handheld.pl to your Linux Machine Post Comment and ill advices you what needs to be done.

Requirements - 
Linux or Mac
-basically all you really need ;)"
,albert2172,2011-07-12T07:52Z,"@jainmehul

This is how to copy encode-handheld.pl to ""usr/local/bin""

------------------------------------------

please do not discuss ""rip"" or anything remotely regarding such a thing. This is totally not the correct forum for such discussion.

I will provide the exact key sequence to install.

open a terminal window

change directory to where encode-handheld-5.0d-with-ffmpeg-and-atomicparsley.tar.gz is located.

for instance if its on your desktop

cd Desktop

gzip -dc encode-handheld-5.0d-with-ffmpeg-and-atomicparsley.tar.gz | tar xvf -

cd encode-handheld-5.0d-with-ffmpeg-and-atomicparsley/

sudo mv encode-handheld* /usr/local/bin

cd ffmpeg-SVN-r20562/

sudo mv ffmpeg* /usr/local/bin

cd ..

cd AtomicParsley/

sudo mv AtomicParsley /usr/local/bin

installation is completed.

now run

encode-handheld.pl -h

When prompted for password from sudo enter your current password.

,albert2172,2011-07-12T08:01Z,"You will also need to install ffmpeg and x264 

This will help you do that...

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=786095

Note that ffmpeg can not downmix 6 channel audio to 2 channel stereo. The best source to use when you have 6 channel audio is .mkv but you will require you have mkvmerge, mkvextract installed and a52dec and dcadec. 

Simple Google will allow you to learn how to install mkvmerge,mkvextract, and a52dec and dcadec. 

After that your all set to go ;)"
[V],jainmehul,2011-07-12T08:18Z,i have windows but i have heard that such encoding can be done using command prompt(cmd).is it true?
,albert2172,2011-07-12T08:46Z,"Its true you have ffmpeg for windows to but its not the same as isn linux or mac. On that system is way better and if you want to do the encode that HR does you would have to use his scripts (encode-handheld.pl) and they only work on those OS.

Im sure you can you just need to tell ffmpeg the options that you want to encode like HR but that can take sometime to learn all those settings.

If you have a windows you can Dual Boot between Windows and Ubuntu.
You can also check out Handbrake for windows it probably the closest thing to what HR does. But To me HR settings are the best =))"
,albert2172,2011-07-12T08:50Z,"Ffmpeg for windows using cmd.

[V],jainmehul,2011-07-12T11:18Z,I have handbrake but that doesn't give quality equivalent to HR... 
,albert2172,2011-07-12T12:46Z,NO much you can use vmware tool to create a virtual machin and install ubuntu there and install encode-handheld.pl But since its in emulations it takes longer.
,neilton_new,2011-07-13T08:51Z,You post the best movies! I liked for the subs!
