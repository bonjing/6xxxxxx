***UPLOADERS NOTES***

As the commercial copy below reads, the Diana Hacker Guide is the most commonly used writers reference handbook in the United States. This specific addition is the MLA (Modern Language Association) seventh edition, published in 2011. Odds are, anyone currently attending college, or who has done so in the past 25 years, was required to purchase a copy of this writer's guide. As an instructor of developmental writing at a local community college, this textbook is not only REQUIRED, it is that rarest of all possible things - a legitimately useful and even indispensable college textbook. Any writer of the English language, no matter what their level of development, either has or should have a copy of this guide. The reason for the unusually large size of the PDF is that I have scanned it in full color at high resolution. This is because a great deal of the content depends on multiple color markings to make its various points. I am choosing to make it available as a torrent because (at my local community college, anyway) the incompetence and malfeasance of our bookstore has made it increasingly difficult for financial aid students to get their hands on this textbook before the semester is half over. I have never felt any moral qualm about any of the myriad and diverse media that I have uploaded as a pirate, but the Bedford St. Martin's publishing company has done such an incredible job with this invaluable book (not to mention its supplemental workbooks and free online exercises), that I am quite loathe to deprive that wonderful company of even a single penny. I encourage anyone reading this to order supplemental materials and or to pay the online fee at the Bedford St. Martin website for additional access.


Furthermore, I have uploaded the INSTRUCTORS edition, which offers additional insight into how to use and implement these materials. I realize that almost nobody reading this is likely to be an instructor of English at the collegiate level, but any homeschooling parent, advanced high school student, or someone who either is or knows a learner with ESL (English as second language) difficulties learning written English, will be able to make great use of this book. This is very probably the single most useful thing I have uploaded to the Pirate Bay in three years of torrenting. It is my hope and wish that many, many of you find this PDF to be of great use.
