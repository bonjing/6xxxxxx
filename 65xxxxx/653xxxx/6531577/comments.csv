Thank you!!"

No doubt. Most of us graduated to the real world a long time ago. The MLA is good, but it is not unique and the vast majority of college graduates in the US over the past 25 years did NOT have a copy of this. Just need to set the record straight on the ludicrously out of touch comment from the uploader."
[V],rambam1776,2011-07-12T05:03Z,"As wetmouse yet again displays his idiocy: ""THE"" MLA is good... sheesh. MLA (much like APA and CMS) are offical writing and citation STYLES. There are 40 different MLA guides you could get. The Hacker guide is simply the best of them. Further, since most American colleges require MLA citation rules for non-pysch classes, it's also the most common style.

Two things here, moron.
1 - Just 'cuz YOU say so (Set the record straight, my ass) with no offered proof, doesn't make it so. In fact, sounds like YOU need a citation guide.

2 - To anyone else who has to read this crap, just search wetmouse here on TPB. He has a little list of people he/she/it doesn't like, and he takes any opportunity to post inane bullshit on their posts. Wetmouse is the quintessential troll. Judge it's worth by looking at all of HIS spiffy uploads. Oh, wait..."

Just wanted to thank you very much for this upload. Having finished both my undergraduate & graduate work, I wouldn't put much stock in what the one commenter said, because as an adult educator who does an awful lot of writing and do use the APA & Chicago style HB, the Hacker Guide was essential reference all through my undergraduate coursework. 

Therefore it can save a starving college student a sum of money, and for older adults like me who have lost so many books over the years, to put a recent version of this guide in my desk reference tool box is very welcome indeed.
Therefore I see your upload for those of us who appreciate what you share because we are people who can put it to good use.
Again, Kudos 

Robert S. M. Ed."
