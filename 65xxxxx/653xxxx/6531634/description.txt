Title: The Black Saint And The Sinner
Artist: Charles Mingus
Genre: Jazz
Label: Impulse Records
Release Date: 1995

This 1963 album by legendary bassist/composer Charles Mingus is one easily one of the most impressive and sprawling works in jazz history. The album features the signature pathos of his earlier workâ€”screaming saxophones, a rocking and unpredictable rhythm section, and explosions of harsh dissonance followed by intensely emotional interludes that recall the great Romantic composers. An absolutely essential addition to any music-loverâ€™s library, The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady is a true and unparalleled benchmark of jazz composition and improvisation.
