,margitmayer,2011-07-11T17:42Z,Please let me know ir that works. It is the third torrent i am making of this thing !
,margitmayer,2011-07-12T02:07Z,Good .It is a great way of studying Kanji. But you have to repeat all the time. If you take long breaks you will forget many stories. Have fun!

,unRheal,2011-07-26T14:32Z,"Hmm.. I don't get it - in the zip file I get one file called ""Japanese Kanji Study - The Heisig Way"" - and it's not a PDF or any kind of zip/rar/compressed file. I'm not a total newb with computers, but this file doesn't make sense to me.. what gives?"
,Justin23L,2011-08-26T15:44Z,@unRheal You must be dumb. Do you even have uTorrent? You download the torrent file and then download the .zip with uTorrent.
,mangakjd,2011-09-20T17:01Z,"What kind of file is this supposed to be...? After you download the zip, it unzips into a ""File,"" no extension whatsoever."
,blargarg,2011-09-25T17:22Z,"I'm taking the JLPT, as I've been speaking Japanese for about 8 years fluently now (my wife is Japanese, so I taught her English and learned it in the process).  

I have the same issue that others have here - you download the torrent, open it in uTorrent, which downloads the file, and the file is ""Japanese Kanji Study - The Heisig Way"" with no file extension.  I've tried opening in Notepad, MSWord, SumatraPDF (better than Adobe), and a few other PDF readers and none of them know how to open this file.

The download was fast, everyone was connectable - but I have no way of reading it, unless someone can offer a tip?

The file itself is 507kb, last modified on 5/17/2011 at 9:49PM, if that differs from what Margit has (maybe uploaded the wrong file?)."

Btw, please don't flame someone who had a legit question.  He has the same issue as me.  It's not the downloading of the torrent that's cooky, it's the file that you actually get that's not a pdf/zip/txt/doc file (or whatever)."
,sarabjeet,2011-10-05T08:29Z,I think the uploader should comeback to check the comments.
,friedegg,2011-10-17T07:37Z,"Yep same story for me. Not seeding this no name ""file"" anymore."
