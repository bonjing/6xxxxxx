,kash79,2011-07-12T13:43Z,"for everyone's info,there should be a total of 73 chapters - 

prologue+71 chapters+epilogue= 73

sometime's all the chapter's don't show up on ereader's TOC (Table of Contents),like in a NOOK ,so be careful u don't skip chapters by accident just because they don't show up on the TOC. "
