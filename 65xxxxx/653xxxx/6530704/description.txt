Hillsong LIVE - God Is Able (2011)

Hillsong LIVE returns with an all-new album entitled God Is Able (Deluxe Edition). Recorded at Hillsong Church in Sydney, the album delivers 11 brand new songs inspired by the God of our here and now. Songs include Rise (Joel Houston), The Cry of the Broken, (Darlene Zschech) and God Is Able, (Reuben Morgan). Another standout song is The Lost Are Found which is sure to become a anthemic chorus for the church.
