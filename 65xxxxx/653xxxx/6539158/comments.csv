[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-14T15:02Z,"i know this one was up first, but you really ought to consider deleting it, because bozx's torrent has a much larger swarm :)"
[V],DownTYU,2011-07-14T15:37Z,"People with actual brains will download this one...
People who will download from other one will get shit speed..+ 3 seedboxes are active in this one."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-14T15:41Z,.
[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-14T15:41Z,so you care more about initial speed than torrent life. shame.
[V],DownTYU,2011-07-14T16:11Z,I don't want MHD to live anyways...I won't see this untill some decent release group rips it..wiki or CHD...definetly not MHD and MaxHD
[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-14T17:29Z,youve got to be kidding.
[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-14T17:44Z,"firstly: there's nothing wrong with this.
secondly: why would upload something that you don't intend to last??"
[V],IndexTrance,2011-07-14T18:22Z,"@ GoodFilms 

What wrong with you?

Bigger swarm or not .. Who cares?

Let the people that download decide which they want to grab .. 

Nobody cares of your opinion on things anymore therefor your status here on TPB .. "
[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-14T19:18Z,"IndexTrance, don't butt it where you're not wanted and don't know what you're talking about ;)"

[V],DownTYU,2011-07-14T20:41Z,No the repack doesn't have any glitch...apart from shitty pic quality for my caliber...Its all right.

,hauntnut,2011-07-15T07:08Z,Can confirm: The skip that was was present at 12:18 in the original torrent has been fixed! This one is legit and complete! And great download speed!
