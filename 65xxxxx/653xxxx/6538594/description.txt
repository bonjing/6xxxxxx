
American Legislative Exchange Council model legislation data dump.



   Credit for all the work behind this goes to http://alecexposed.org


   We have taken the following steps with the data they released:


    1. pulled all zip files, extracted PDFs, put them in a tree structure

    2. cured egregious fail in file names such as spaces and shell characters

    3. packaged as torrent, only 624 files, despite them saying it was 800+


   They seem to be pretty well Slashdotted at the moment, but long term it
looks like that site will be the nerve center for picking this stuff apart. 
This torrent is a nice backup so they don't get pushed around by ALEC, and we 
made things a bit easier for those who might want to script up stuff and 
apply it to all these PDFs.
