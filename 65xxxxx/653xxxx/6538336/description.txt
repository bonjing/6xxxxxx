 The 5th International Symposium on the Molecular Breeding of Forage and Turf covers all aspects of molecular breeding of forage and turf plants, from gene discovery, functional genomics, molecular genetics and marker technology, marker-assisted selection, transgenesis to transgenic molecular breeding; address applications - among others - for enhanced quality, tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses; relating to forage grasses, forage legumes, their bacterial and fungal endosymbionts, as well as turf grasses.
 The Symposium includes keynote presentations from international science leaders in the above fields and offer abstracts in the following topics - breeding and functional genomics for tolerance to biotic stress, - Molecular breeding and functional genomics for tolerance to abiotic stress, - Molecular genetics and modification of flowering and reproductive development, - Genomics of plant-symbiont relations, - Molecular breeding for animal, human and environmental welfare, - Development and Application of molecular technologies in forage and turf improvement, - Bioinformatics-bringing data to a usable form for breeders, - Population and quantitative genetic aspects of molecular breeding, - Gene manipulation, field testing, risk assessment and biosafety, - Intellectual property rights for molecular tools or marker systems.
