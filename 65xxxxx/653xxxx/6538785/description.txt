Billed as "Cyber-Fi", and as one character puts it, "Bio-Gender Warfare", this small film has plenty of references for the film-buff and computer geek alike.

The Tilda Swintons, or should I call her replicant selves, Swilda Tinton, survive on a diet of jizz, but long for the real world, and gag on simulated sperm. There are four of her in this, including the dressed down scientist real life one.  Glasses were always a symbol, if only that, of homeliness (or perhaps braininess...in men). Their dance sequences show a lack of rhythm, but that's not surprising, they're told to act more robotic.

A couple of Hal Hartley mainstays, James Urbaniak and Thomas Jay Ryan, as well as a mumbling Jeremy Davies fill out the staff. Oh, and Karen Black!

The director, Lynn Hershman-Leeson, is also responsible for "Conceiving Ada" and "Strange Culture", also starring Tilda.

There is a director's commentary and some trailers.  The film itself is but 82 minutes.
