 It is a general trend in computing that computers are becoming ever smaller and more interconnected, and sensor networks - large networks of small, simple devices - represent a logical extreme of this trend. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are attracting an increasing degree of research interest, with a growing number of industrial applications starting to emerge. Two of these applications, personal health monitoring and emergency/disaster recovery, are the focus of the European Commission project ProSense: Promote, Mobilize, Reinforce and Integrate Wireless Sensor Networking Research and Researchers.

 This hands-on, useful introduction to WSN systems development presents broad coverage of topics in the field, contributed by researchers involved in the ProSense project. It emphasises the practical knowledge required for the successful implementation of WSNs. The first part of the work covers basic issues of sensors, software, and position-based routing protocols. Part Two focuses on multidisciplinary issues, including sensor network integration, mobility aspects, geo-routing, medical applications, and vehicular sensor networks. The remaining two parts present case studies and further applications.

 Topics and features:

 * Begins with a Foreword by the Nobel Laurate Professor Martin Perl, of Stanford University
 * Presents a broad overview of WSN technology, including an introduction to sensor and sensing technologies
 * Investigates real-world applications of WSN systems in medical and vehicular sensor networks
 * Contains an extensive section on case studies, providing details of the development of a number of WSN applications
 * Discusses frameworks for WSN systems integration, through which WSN technology will become fundamental to the Future Internet concept

 Providing holistic coverage of WSN technology, this text/reference will help graduate students of computer science, electrical engineering and telecommunications toward mastering the specific domains of this emerging area. The book will also be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in entering or exploring the field.
