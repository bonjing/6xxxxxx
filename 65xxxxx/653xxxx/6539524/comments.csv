I am pretty shure this movie is up-scaled from a 720p version, then the pixels has been blured in trying to ""hide the crime""... But the result only shows that the details has gotten blurry on zooming in, the real livfe sharpness is not there. For instance: Its hard to pinpoint single straws of hair on peoples heads, they look mushy.

Would be just about acceptably viewable on a 42"" screen, but not any larger than that."
