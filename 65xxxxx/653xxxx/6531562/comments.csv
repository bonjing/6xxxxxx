A: 7  for a cam

easily watchable so thanks to the uploader for the effort"
,Stumbled,2011-07-11T10:34Z,pictures off center for the first 7-8mins and shakes a little in places afterwards but otherwise pretty good and you get the odd bit of laughter in the sound but all in all very watchable

,Maynard46,2011-07-21T06:48Z,"pretty bad quality imo. you can see and hear whats going on...and its a cam. But not worth the DL
A 4

,Jebus567,2011-07-22T05:10Z,A cam is a cam. Of course this isn't ideal. Theres a few minutes in the begining where the person is adjusting the cam but I found this totally watchable. If you really want to see this movie DL it. If you want quality wait or go spend the $20 at the theater.
,Capn_Cunt,2011-07-23T00:30Z,"Download this if you fist fuck your dog, that is all."

,DjLuxor,2011-07-31T10:43Z,Dude...what is it with you fucking cam people. I dont mind watching cams...it beats going to the movies...but why the fuck cant you hold them still? The camera will be in a perfect spot...then out of nowhere the guy starts re adjusting it and gets it off. Then waits 5 minutes and does it again...the whole movie. HOLD THE CAM STILL!
,joo-loved-it,2011-08-01T03:02Z,"to all the people that think their quality rating for this movie is relevant, perish your headbangin souls to death.
this is a straight up comedy with next to no action whatsoever so what the fuck do you really need 720p bluray quality for when all you need to really see is who is talking. it's a comedy ffs.your opinions are about as wanted and valid as mine. and y'all could be a little nicer to the uploaders by not being cunt reviewers."
,skull9876543,2011-08-02T10:05Z,@MrToast47 you're a faggot
,Earl_Manbow,2011-08-03T07:00Z,"Thanx Pops, very watchable, hilarious movie!!!"
,whybitch_itsfree,2011-08-05T08:31Z,"To All Whiners & Complainers:

Stop doing that annoying thing you do, and go pay for a movie, then come back and see if you appreciate that the people here that PROVIDE this service for you, actually did JUST THAT... they paid, so you wouldn't have to. Show a little respect and gratitude, or keep your negative comments to yourself. 

There was never any implied ""theater quality"". You get exactly what you've paid for (I'm not going to do the accounting on this for you)

As for you other complete tools that want to babble mindlessly over whether you should watch it on an xbox or a playstation or whatever fanboy gadget is the latest and greatest..... here is the solution you've been waiting for:

Items Required:
1 x BIG TV (42"" or better)
1 x laptop with HDMI Output
1 x HDMI cable
1 x Wireless Keyboard and Mouse
1 x shut the hell up about which setup is better to watch it on because no one here has $20,000 invested in their very own personal home theater.

I highly doubt someone who knows their Home Theater Audio gear is going to play a bunch of staticky crackly audio from a movie through their X Brand name towers, nor will they play flickery crappy video through their 72"" LED 3D TV.

They would go to the movie theater. And pay.
Full price.
and not bitch.
At all.


But then some of us would have no hobbies.

And be forced to be contributing members of the Gene Pool.

Perish the thought."

,vector1818,2011-08-07T14:52Z,"What is wrong with someone commenting that this download does not look good? Should he lie and say thanks for the upload,  it's a 10 out of 10? 
I appreciated negative comments posted so I know if it's worth a download or not. I have no problem watching a cam or ts as long as it's viewable. If 
someone leaves a comment like 'a/v sucks not worth the DL' than I know I have to wait for another upload. Who wants to watch a real crappy upload anyway? "
,magoozer760,2011-08-15T03:02Z,"i dont know why people bitch at other people who leave comments about the movie. Good or bad comment, doesn't fuckin matter cause thats what the comments are for. You jerk-offs go and call someone an asshole for saying what your thinking. You cock-suckers just get some sort of self satisfaction out of trying to be the righteous vindicator but in reality your just a prick cause you try make your opinion more valid than anothers. You want people to stop saying bad comments? How bout you go make a better copy you fuckin douche bag."
,magoozer760,2011-08-15T03:09Z,Oh and the radio is free too but they still put shitty songs on there and no one tells you to fuck off if you dont like it. Get a life.
,pops87pl,2011-08-16T17:18Z,"@irishtampon
its a CAM... didnt notice ? You can trash your rates..."
,Barefoot1983,2011-08-18T21:58Z,"Ok, the uploader should be shot. He was drunk because half the movie the camera isnt even facing the screen. yeah he moves it around a little bit. but this is a terrible try at piracy. plz retire"
,handsworthzark,2011-08-20T19:21Z,"thanks. 
It is what it is. 
Xvid CAM

not a 4 - 4
actually give it a 7 - 7 "
,theoRyzN,2011-08-22T10:11Z,"To anyone that is complaining.

Where in the title does it say DvDRip, R5 or BRRip ? If you can answer that question your argument is valid, if not delete your account and go kill yourself.

Cheers."
