Build the Next Great iOS Game with Cocos2D! 

 Cocos2D is the powerhouse framework behind some of the most popular games in the App Store. If youâ€™ve played Tiny Wings, Angry Birds, Mega Jump, Trainyard, or even Super Turbo Action Pig, then youâ€™ve played a game that uses Cocos2D or Box2D physics. The beauty of Cocos2D is its simplicity. Itâ€™s easy to become overwhelmed when you start developing an iOS game, especially if you look at things like OpenGL ES, OpenAL, and other lower level APIs. Writing a game for the iPhone and iPad does not have to be that difficult, and Cocos2D makes game development fun and easy.

 Learning Cocos2D walks you through the process of building Space Viking (which is free on the App Store), a 2D scrolling game that leverages Cocos2D, Box2D, and Chipmunk. As you build Space Viking, youâ€™ll learn everything you need to know about Cocos2D so you can create the next killer iOS game.
