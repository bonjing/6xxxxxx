,Seed_Demon,2011-10-12T06:42Z,"Since no one else has,...THANK YOU for your efforts if this works.   I just spent an uncountable number of hours painstakingly poring over thousands of deleted folders, with 10's of thousands of deleted files on a TB drive, to find just the files which caused my programs to break, only to find the software needs to be reg'ed in order top recover them...I think this is a poor manner by which to lure people in to buying it, once they put all their time in to finding the  files needed recovering, and THEN hit them with, ""In order to save your files you must purchase a license"" It was on a freeware Boot CD< with no indication it was a trial or reduced function, or i would ave used something else i have already, but was to much trouble to dig out on my old XP computer.  No way i am losing all that time and have to do it all over again!  Again Thanks if it works!!!"
