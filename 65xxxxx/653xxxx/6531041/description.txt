 By Rumor Has It, Clay Walker had settled into a comfortable formula of radio-ready country-pop and honky tonk, and he had ceased to experiment with his music. Which isn't a bad thing, because Walker is a consummate professional able to make even mediocre material sound good. Rumor Has It may not be among his very best, yet there are enough strong moments to make it worthwhile for most fans. -- Thom Owens
