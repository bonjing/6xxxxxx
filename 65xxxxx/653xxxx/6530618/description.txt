An amazing, rare treat for Terry Gilliam fans.
May 5th, 1974. Bob Godfrey presents the Do It Yourself Film Animation Show.

Terry Gilliam demonstrates his own cutout animation method in great detail. The format of the show matches Gilliam's own anarchic sensibilities and Godfrey has created some original animation to match.

Quality is good, high quality VHSlike, PAL, with a timecode at upper left.
