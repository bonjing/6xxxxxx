Though in his twenties and married, Los Angeles police officer Dan Shay (David Cassidy) looked much younger than his age, so he was assigned to operate in undercover situations, typically posing as a student or a naive young man on the wrong side of the law.  Keeping his head together at home was his wife Joanne and young daughter Cindy, while Sgt. Abrams (Simon Oakland) was his firm police superior.

The pilot "A Chance to Live" originally aired on 28 May 1978 as a 2-hour episode of the series "Police Story".
