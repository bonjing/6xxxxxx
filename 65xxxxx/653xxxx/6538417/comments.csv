,deznutts1420,2011-07-14T19:35Z,"I keep failing to load game gives a message: The Dynamic library ""rld.dll"" failed to load. What did i do wrong or what needs to happen for it to work. I followed all instructions perfect. Also it puts a harry potter shortcut on my desktop for some reason"
[V],Subzero!,2011-07-14T21:40Z,"@deznutts1420 

the rld.dll is part of the crack, i guess your virus tool has deleted it during extraction. de-activate your virus software and try again, and put the whole directory in your virus tool's whitelist (exception list!). have fun.

ah, and the harry potter icon was my bad, used the wrong one on this release! ;)"

,JesseFTW,2011-07-21T01:20Z,"It says the Rld.dll was removed, and I'm pretty sure that the game needs that file to run, is there any way that i can make my Norton 360 stop from removing this file?"

[V],Subzero!,2011-09-09T12:05Z,"now, what you probably got, is a false positive alert from overly protective heuristics."
