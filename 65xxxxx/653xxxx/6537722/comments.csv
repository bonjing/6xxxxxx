(I came up with that amount after many hours of deliberation as I thought $20.00 was reaching for shit and if they had $15.00 they would have been able to afford to use a chihuahua in at least two frames which would still realistically leave the chihuahua invisible to the naked eye but the subliminal quality would have made it so the entire movie was watchable)."
