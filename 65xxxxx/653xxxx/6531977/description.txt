In 1991, Roxette embarked upon its first global tour, Join the Joyride. The tour lasted a little over a year, played more than 100 dates and sold out to more than a million people. While traveling, Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle decided to capture the energy of the band by documenting their development on tape. The result, Tourism, is not a compilation of live material. Rather, it's a tour album, complete with some live tracks, some re-mastered material from the late '80s and some newly written, newly recorded songs. Probably Roxette's best overall effort.
