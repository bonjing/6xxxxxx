,iaKH,2011-07-14T07:22Z,"thanks BOZX, connected to no seeders but getting decent speeds from just peers so far. been waiting a while for this movie. (saw it in theaters but had to take a dump in the middle of it :(!)"
,hacker7890,2011-07-14T10:30Z,"@iaKH

Far too much information..."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-14T12:47Z,delete the original torrent buddy
,blusniffer,2011-07-14T15:17Z,"Fucking 1.2kbs speed, thanx but no thanx as Source code 2 will be released before it DL's!!!!!"
,agrsssuka,2011-07-14T16:10Z,"so, is this legit?
wont be nuked in few hours?"
,tynx,2011-07-14T18:12Z,4.39 GiB seems small? Or are the rips nowadays so good? 5203 kbps is a bit to little for my taste. But thanks for the upload.
,abhikrit,2011-07-15T06:06Z,ah.. yes... this is again NUKED.... had almost done it. got all wasted.
,Redundantos,2011-07-15T09:45Z,What was wrong with Source.Code.720p.Bluray.x264-MHD ? Why it's deleted? I almost finished downloading it. Should I download this one instead?
,abhikrit,2011-07-15T12:52Z,"@ Redundantos

That copy was nuked.... it had repeated scenes problem..yes you should delete it.. & PROBABLY... it is being said that this one too is nuked"
,SD_rocks,2011-07-15T13:59Z,"no this one is not nuked i guss, cause everyone here who is sayin it is nuked has read it frm rslog or frm others on tpb... no has actually d'loaded and confirmed"
,paerchu,2011-07-15T16:27Z,"Base on the screens, it's better than those with korean shit subs that looks like a cam. Downloading this one to compare :) "
,blusniffer,2011-07-15T19:24Z,"Heads up, if any of u like me wanted to play this on ps3 it's another upload which doesn't state type of file. Also ( like me) you'll discover it won't go through any muxer to convert it, unit error!

Fuck u!!"
,iCookie,2011-07-15T20:52Z,"This one still has bugs and scene repeats! Terrible torrent, A0 V0 don't download! OP is a faggot!"
[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-16T03:27Z,"NOTHING WRONG with this torrent! NOT NUKED, no scene repeats! :)"
,abhikrit,2011-07-16T07:56Z,Yes. I too can CONFIRM. NOT NUKED. NOTHING WRONG. everything is perfect in the torrent. 
,abhikrit,2011-07-16T08:53Z,icookie is an asshole... iasshole.. dont believe him
,figglegiggle69,2011-07-16T17:42Z,its definitely nuked.
,bewareoblivionisathand,2011-07-16T19:01Z,"Appears to be the correct running time (93 min), so I reckon its a good copy."
,Johnny575,2011-07-17T02:46Z,"@blusniffer
I experienced that too. mkv2vob just wouldn't start the process.
But... I solved it by remuxing the file with mkvmerge. I just set ""Compression"" to ""none"" in the ""Extra options"" tab (for both the video and audio track)."
,lordquad,2011-07-17T03:01Z,"I just watched it and I couldn't see anything wrong with it.

It seems that people who ""complain"" about repeat scenes are pulling a joke. It's part of the movie that some things repeat themselves ;)

It looks like it has been ripped from Blueray and while the video quality is not great it is fair for a 720p 4.39GB Bluray rip."
,L3GiTPro,2011-07-17T20:56Z,"Thank you.  Quality turned out really good.  Finally there is a version of this that does not have the subtitles hardcoded, and that is not XViD.  I don't know why people are uploading HD movies in XViD now.  Stupid right?"
,Johnny575,2011-07-18T15:07Z,"@lordquad
Yeah, either they are trolling... or they didn't pay attention to the story at all : )"

,funnyname,2011-07-22T19:49Z,thank you
,um4d,2011-07-24T06:57Z,One of the best movies I've seen this year.
,Ezel,2011-07-25T23:21Z,"This release crashed my computer 7 times. :-(
In the end it was more of a challenge to complete watching it than I enjoyed it.
Great picture, great sound, good movie but this release is unstable and glitchy as hell. 
Kept jumping between VLC and MPC hope that one player would survive the glitch-onslaught but no. :-(

I would NOT download this release! I guess something have gone wrong when converting it from .rar to .mkv or something. 
Hope for a proper release soon."
,Ezel,2011-07-25T23:24Z,"And by the way: This is the complete movie! The reports of ""repeated scenes"" are wrong! It is a time-jumping movie so some repetition is there but that is part of the movie.
So if you want to gamble that your setup can tolerate the glitches, feel free to go ahead and try."
,DanaWhite,2011-08-04T18:15Z,"really wanted to download this,but im not sure if i can burn a bluray rip to a standard 4.7 dvd.it probably wont fit,lose a shit load of quality or not work."
,funnyname,2011-08-07T23:52Z,The video file is free of errors !  If your PC installation is a mess try 'vlc player' which plays everything or try  'k-lite codec pack' which comes with a smart mediaplayer. 
,papali_,2011-08-09T11:25Z,Problems connecting to tracker....jag blir sååå trött! Varannan torrent e så! Vhy???

,mcordell,2011-08-20T17:35Z,"Audio/Video Quality: Perfect quality for 720p.  No problems.

Movie:  8.2/10

Plot was consistent and very intriguing.  However, I felt the movie would have benefited from more character development and a longer movie.  I felt not showing some failed attempts at finding the bomber took away from the story and helped take away from the entire central theme of the movie: life is priceless and you are surrounded by people with years of living, loving,  and experience each with their own story.  Giving the movie a longer length would have made a more significant impact on the audience as the audience, and the character, would learn more and more about each individual surrounding the main character.

******SPOILER ALERT*********

******SPOILER ALERT*********
I feel the ending was very cheesy.  The central theme would be much more effective if the main character simply died instead of being alive in the source code.  I feel that director made the main character live simply to make the audience happy, which took away from the entire theme of the movie."
,nero_pt,2011-09-30T19:38Z,The image and sound is messed up :(
