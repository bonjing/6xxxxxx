1st off i'm very grateful that you uploaded Melty Blood English Version online but theres a problem with re-act. i opened your .txt to see what i had to do so i changed the directory letter and location... but it keeps telling me that the original melty blood is not installed, and that i need that to play re-act...

so if you possibly know what the problem is, please respond to this torrent page

thx
