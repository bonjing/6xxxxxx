This is an accurate track listing with all MP3's accurately tagged and organised.

Please note this isn't a retail rip as that isn't out for another week or so.

Disc 1 over runs (if buring to audio cd) by 3 minutes. However disc 2 is only 70 mins long so you if burning to disc take one from disc 1 and put on disc 2.  I trimmed and scouted every where for shorter tracks but this is the best I can do until the official release 

Anyway enjoy and please seed and spread theh love :)
