1- You need a DL DVD ( DL for Double-Layer ) So a dvd with 8.5gb capacity

2- you need ImgBurn ( free on internet ) Its a software for burn ISO ( iso is the format of the game )

3-You need Utorrent ( free ) ( to download the torrent )

4- Maybe you will need WinRar ( free to ) if the file is compress

( after you got all the software )

1- download the Torrent ( file on this page )

2- Clic on the torrent ( where the torrent is save or in your list of download )

3- let the download go ( is can be long or not depend about your internet and how much person seed

4-after the download is finish you need to decompress ( with WinRar )

5- after that you will have a Iso file and a dvdfile

6 - iso will be 7.3gb and dvdfile 1ko

7- Be sure that the dvdfile have the same name that iso file !

8-after open your ImgBurn and go to write image file to dosc

9-go to tools ( in the top ) / setting / write /

10- now you will see Layer break

11- select user specified and write in the box 1913760

12-clic ok and select the DVDFILE NOT THE ISO

13- put a 8.5gb dvd DL in your pc

14-select 2.4x to burn

I hope i help you

Enjoy it ! "
