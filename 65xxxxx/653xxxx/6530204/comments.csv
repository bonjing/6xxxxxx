[V],DownTYU,2011-07-11T21:25Z,Frame rate modulus is perfect check with proper AVC decoder.
,unfocused,2011-07-22T08:48Z,+1 for the excellent quality. 
,VicVega,2011-09-21T02:24Z,"@DownTYU Don't just look at the numbers, grab some stills and check it with your eyes - it's shit. If you don't see it you're blind and should be untrusted. No idea what these guys did with it."
,Mutegrill,2012-01-19T01:22Z,"Nothing wrong. If it looks & plays ok on our computers, there MUST be something lacking on yours (codec, speed, wrong player, retarted).

DownTYU is trusted for the same reason you are not (stupid).

Great up! :-)"
,VicVega,2012-05-14T21:45Z,"Go ahead and check with any decoder you want, the results are the same because the rip is bad. I'm getting sick of morons posting before checking facts.

Proof:

Screenshots are from 0:21:33 to 0:21:34.

Tested with same results using three different players and decoders:
Media Player Classic Home Cinema 1.6.1.4112 using ffdshow rev 4360, WinDVD 11 and Nero Kwik Media 1.10.

Got different results than I? No? Then stfu. I'm not ""trusted"" here because I don't upload. Maybe I should start, because so much on here is crap."
