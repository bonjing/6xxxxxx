To deal with some of the doubles (sex Bob-Omb/Beck versions and Metric/TCAD versions) If a song was only teased in the movie I used the Beck version and saved the Sex Bob-Omb version for when they actually perform it. And I used the Metric version of black sheep when it plays in the background at the record store, and saved the TCAD version for when they perform it."
