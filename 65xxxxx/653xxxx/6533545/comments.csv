   Will definitly go into my ""Noire"" catagory of flicks^^ Prolly said this before but I luff your taste/choice in movies, I tend to be a Sci-Fi/Fantasy fan in both movies and books...but I do so enjoy forays into other gendres. Speaking of witch. Have you seen ""War Hunt""? If not do so....an amazing hidden Redford gem.
