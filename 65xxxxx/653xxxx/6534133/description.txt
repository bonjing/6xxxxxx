Part 2: The World of Ptah

Paser, the architect who designed the Great Obelisk, is suffering from a strange illness. If no-one cures him, work on the building site will remain at a standstill. Maia has been ordered to heal him of this strange scourge. Her quest to find an effective cure will bring her to the famous city of Memphis. However, this mission involves more than a simple visit to an apothecary. Maia will be forced to call upon supernatural forces in order to help Paser.
