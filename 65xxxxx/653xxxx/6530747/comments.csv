,surprisee,2011-07-17T04:57Z,"What's the suggested method for being able to copy this onto a usb thumb drive and then playing it on a PS3? Been trying to do that with another movie and haven't had much luck using handbrake. PS3 keeps complaining the file is corrupt or not compatible.

thanks"

I watch all of HD-R-US releases on my PS3, but I always burn them to DVD5 discs. As far as the thumb drive goes, I would assume that just copying the file to the usb drive and inserting it into the ps3 should be sufficient. Sometimes I noticed that I had to hit TRIANGLE over the file name and then hit ""Play from beginning"" to make them work....but haven't had to do that in awhile.

When you say you were trying to get it to work for another movie, do you mean one of HD-R-US releases?"
