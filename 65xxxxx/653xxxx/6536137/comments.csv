,hackpsp7,2012-01-11T06:09Z,why for smartphones/ipads and not just in avi format?!?!?!?
,desal555,2012-02-07T02:21Z,this is censored
[T],karl2802,2012-05-03T17:33Z,Hi I chose to do these in smartphone format for the smaller file sizes. Plus there are loads of other torrents out there offering these in normal .avi formats. And yes these are uncensored.
,cadetbester,2012-05-18T23:55Z,"i like that people are able to torrent these in the mp4 format... it save both time and worry... it saves time because i dont have to convert it so that i can use it with my apple tv and or ipad/iphone... it saves effort because there is alot of people that post crap that makes you buy a specific player.
thank you uploader."
