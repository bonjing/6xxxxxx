[V],_F1_,2011-07-11T20:14Z,"Its not a funny piece mate, its the dictionary of the food technology. Go through the preface:

This book contains nutrient composition data for 287 foods.This is Crown copyright material from The Composition of Foods, Fifth Edition and its supplements which has been reproduced with the permission of the Controller of Her Majestyâ€™s Stationery Office. In addition to the nutrient content per 100g, we have calculated nutrient yields per serving, and shown the information as a note that a specified serving is a source, good source or rich source of various nutrients. A rich source means that the serving provides more than 30%, a good source 20â€“30%, and a source 10â€“20% of the recommended daily amount of that nutrient (based on the EU nutrition labelling figures shown in Table 2). Any specified food will differ in composition from one variety to another, and from sample to sample of the same variety, depending on the conditions under which the animal was raised or the plant grown, so that the values quoted here should not be considered to be accurate to better than about Â±10%, at best; the variation in micronutrient content may be even greater."

I'm pretty sure that joe was referring to the irony of this character (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bender_%28Futurama%29) giving nutritional advice, as he has no regard for his personal well being."
