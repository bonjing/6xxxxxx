 Voet, Voet, and Pratt's Fundamentals of Biochemistry, challenges students to better understand the chemistry behind the biological structure and reactions occurring in living systems. The Third Edition continues this tradition, and additionally incorporates coverage of recent research and an expanded focus on preparing and supporting students throughout the course. With the addition of new conceptual assessment content to WileyPLUS, students have the opportunity to assess their conceptual understanding of key introductory biochemistry concepts and retrain themselves on their misconceptions.
