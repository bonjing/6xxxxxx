,elitecrusher,2011-09-17T21:47Z,"You better watch your sick ignorant mouth when you talk about Jesus you fool, or anything related...Your part of the reason that this world is so screwed up and gone severely down hill towards destruction.. You anti jesus people are sick and you spit in the face of the one who gave his life for you! If the rest of the families inb this world were like this family, this world would be wonderful. Instead all we see around us everyday is death, hate & negativity!! Which is why we are becoming our environment "

You ""Jesus"" people have done more to hurt this world than anyone, so watch your mouth.  To even say I am ""Anti-Jesus"" would be giving too much credit to your pathetic, soul saving, fairytale, Jesus story.  Jesus never existed so I can't really spit in his face can I ? ... No, but I can spit in your uneducated face.  Fuck off and leave thought to those capable of it."
,Kovo1,2011-09-28T18:39Z,Thanks - quality and audio great

Wow, you really need to watch when you are calling other people uneducated. The evidence of Jesus existing is undebatable. It has been proven over and over again by historians that Jesus is in fact as real as George Washington. I think what you might have meant to say is that Jesus isn't really Christ or maybe you meant to say that God isn't real. This would be your opinion not a fact. And to be honest this is a kinda stupid place to ranting about your opinion. Try Facebook, it seems like a more suitable place to debate your spiritual beliefs."
,fuzzybrain,2012-04-12T20:48Z,this movie is a true masterpiece

Great another jehovah witness, when will you people get it through you head, that your so called ""Jesus"" never existed to begin with. So take your atheist self and go read your fictional bible.
