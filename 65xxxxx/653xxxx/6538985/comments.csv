[V],_F1_,2011-07-14T05:57Z,"The cover page I upped in BayImg marking 'Offensive' and it didn't accept in non-porn category. If BayImg fails; mess happens to the torrent file: it is a general issue.

Solutions:
Try 'Magnet Link' instead of 'Download This Torrent'.

Enjoy ///"

E99CB3DB52B9575471009D13BDE6E751A59D2098

I'm not providing the link. Go to Torrage and follow the 2nd line on how to make a link from the hash. its easy. Enjoy ///"
