The original is here:
https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6455274/Paul_%282011%29_DVDRip_XviD-MAX
(4450 seeders)"

,pawnone,2011-09-01T22:05Z,yah some people just feel the need to act like a dick he must get picked on by the other dorks...
,LadyBlackArachnia,2011-09-27T00:25Z,Always share. No need to care where you got it just that you re-uploaded it and caught the attention of the downloaders. Thank you.
,mellyboi1,2011-10-01T09:40Z,"Fuck the polictics! This is why I like BTjunkie better...why isn't anyone commenting on the actual torrent???? Hello, is it 10/10 or 8/10. Out of 125 seeders I know I can't be the only one annoyed by this. I mean, come on!!! You think the uploader torrented this movie for us just so we could argue. Jesus. I wouldn't even be here if BTjunkie weren't down..."
