Released July 30th (30-7-2011) as an open beta test. Spiritual and physical successor to the DKZ version of DMX. It has many updates and improvements, while retaining that dark decayed look, and the high system requirements of the DKZ 1.3.2 version.

Installation: Copy mod Gamedata folder to a clean install of Stalker SOC patched to V1.0005 (the Steam patch level). This mod needs 13 Gigs of HD space. Add -noprefetch to the game shortcut so the mod has more working memory (other options: -nointro, -noshadows). A new user.ltx file is expected soon, with custom video settings. Recommend at least a dual core system with an x64 OS, 4 Gigs & a strong video card. Tecnobacon suggests lower spec machines can try playing on Static Lighting with brightness and contrast turned down one notch.
