,hahahafr,2011-08-09T00:36Z,"by the way, unlike recent HD releases of the original scream, this one is really uncut."
,moviecroc,2011-08-14T08:01Z,This isn't the uncut version. 
,henryspencr2011,2011-08-14T22:20Z,"Okay I registered just to comment on this. 

I've been looking for my long lost 1st edition vhs copy of scream for a while now. AFAIK the only uncut editions are the laserdisc, my 1st release vhs and a korean/import dvd. 

Google scream uncut and go to dvdtalk, it won't let me post the link of the differences.

I've seen my version so many times after seeing all the butchered shit on dvd and blu ray it got very aggravating trying to track down the original again and keep track of whats in or out. All DVD and blu ray relases of scream thus far have been shit. I got 2 different versions of the other vhs screams and between all of them they all cut something just like this one.

The sad thing is, THIS is actually the least cut out of the DVD/Blur ray releases.

The good:

1. Steve guts are shown.
2. The zoom in on Casey is fast.
3. Stu gives his little cheer after inviting the girls to his house.
4. Tatems death is uncut.
5. Billy's line ""movies make psychos more creative"" is left in. 

The bad: 

1. Visual quality is comparable to a dvd. Increase the bitrate please! Size"

,henryspencr2011,2011-08-14T22:54Z,"Ignore the 2nd and 3rd posts.

The bad: 

1. Visual quality is comparable to a dvd. Increase the bitrate please! Quality over size!
2. The scene where Billy stabs Stu twice is instead heard, not seen and focused on Sids reaction.
3. The camera is panned left when focusing on the dad on the floor. The blood drip is audible but not visible. 

Everything else is ok without me playing them side by side. 

So for a 99% uncut 16:9 DVD quality Scream, this one is the choice I'd actually keep. "
