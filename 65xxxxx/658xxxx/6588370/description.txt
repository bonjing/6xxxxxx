Titeuf (voiced by Donald Reignoux) is about 10, though he looks like a baby; his huge, egg-shaped head is bald except for a single blond and bouncy plume of hair. He's in love with his classmate Nadia (Melanie Bernier), but each time she looks in his direction, he does or says the wrong thing (sample dialogue: "All girls suck").
