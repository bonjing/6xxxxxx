,olivergeorget,2011-08-04T17:12Z,Brilliant thanks for this! Downloading at 2mb :) Is there anyway to separate the add ons from the rwp file?
,PESSO114,2011-08-04T17:27Z,this download doesn't even start
,rossuk,2011-08-04T17:58Z,downloading is slow but it's worth the wait
,Thootjeajax,2011-08-05T18:07Z,"@olivergeorget yes there is. Just select open with and then select winrar. 
If you did and there is still only the .rwp file just click double on it."
,tankbob,2011-08-05T21:30Z,great torrent and a great idea but where have the seeders gone keep up the good work msflight
,darrencaf,2011-08-05T21:53Z,"Nice Torrent, I have all these and more but I'll seed it for you for a while ;)"
,Thootjeajax,2011-08-05T23:16Z,"@darrencaf
Do you also have the class 455 add-on?"
,mihai2692,2011-08-06T00:12Z,It`s work on Railworks ?
,analjuggern4ut,2011-08-06T07:49Z,"Thx. At the moment there are no seeds and the availability is 0.385, but I'm hoping to finish this later on anyway. Does this only have rolling stock add-ons or also routes? Much nicer to have a proper .rwp than just RAR's containing copies of the stuff in game folders, as those are often missing something vital."
,apreston,2011-08-06T13:18Z,"every time this guy put one of these files together you never get to 100%. Last time he did it stopped at 78% and this one has stopped at 38.5%.
So will one of you guys who claim to have downloaded 100% tell everyone else how you did it."
,hexorz321,2011-08-06T18:39Z,if i have other addons can install this?
,shamus178,2011-08-06T19:30Z,Please seed people!!!!!!
,Thootjeajax,2011-08-06T19:49Z,"@apreston mine is stopped on 38.5% also:(

,Rangler,2011-08-06T20:06Z,Who can give the link to add RW2 tram line???
,Rangler,2011-08-06T20:08Z,38.5 - FIN !
,shamus178,2011-08-06T20:10Z,"I think we are all stuck at 38.5, please help leechers!!!!"

,hexorz321,2011-08-06T23:13Z,if i have half of these can i install this pack?
,tankbob,2011-08-07T11:50Z,if this torrent had gone to 100% msflight you would have been a legend on some other sites but this is going nowhere what a shame just got your newest torrent hope you can get this one finished or someone who has it 100% please seed.
,Thootjeajax,2011-08-07T12:32Z,@hexorz321 should be no problem
,rossuk,2011-08-07T19:11Z,no seeders on this file
,Thootjeajax,2011-08-07T19:43Z,"Good morning Rossuk
It might help if you read the posts above."
,rossuk,2011-08-07T21:40Z,this collection pack is faulty so the person who owns this torrent has immediately suspended seeding of the torrent to not waste your time
,tankbob,2011-08-07T21:47Z,"uploader has commented that this torrent was faulty and he has stopped seeding just so as you all know,"
,shamus178,2011-08-07T23:06Z,"Thanks tankbob, do we know when he will upload again?"
,tankbob,2011-08-08T11:43Z,it was a huge collection so will take some time to repair check his new pb account for info on new files
,NunoMMG,2011-08-10T11:29Z,"WTF, where is the SEEDER?!!! Most of the time is offline. doesnÂ´t even give time to spread your own torrents!"
,Rangler,2011-08-10T14:48Z,no! Fin? no razdacha!
,noripants,2011-08-11T05:25Z,again read the comments above... it says exactly why its not being seeded...
,RailGamer,2011-09-28T21:24Z,Great News! I am formerly MSFLIGHT i am relasing this again on my new account. It is slightly different to this one. The new one is all integrated with Train Simulator 2012 it will contain every add-on apart from Isle of wight which can be obtained. I'm hoping to have this released within the next 48 hours. There will be only one snag as it has taken me many of months to compile all these add-on's a donation will have to be made (as appose to setting a set charge so you get to decide what it is worth) to receive your serial number via e-mail. Thanks in advance and i hope that you will enjoy this massive pack!
,alanko007,2011-10-05T20:56Z,"Hi RailGamer, how are you continuing with the mega pack? :) I am really looking forward to it. A donation seems like a good idea to adequately appreciate the work you have done it ;)"
,voltrix128,2012-02-12T21:02Z,"but this works or not ??????
and why don't seed???"
