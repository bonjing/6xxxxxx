Art of Public Speaking: Lessons from the Greatest Speeches in History


Taught By Professor John R. Hale, Ph.D., University of Cambridge,


Everybody is a public speaker. Maybe you\'re delivering a corporate presentation or interviewing for a new job. Maybe you\'re a teacher lecturing students or a citizen addressing a neighborhood association. Maybe you\'re arguing a case before a courtroom or persuading book club members about the merits of your latest read.

Whatever the situation, being able to speak in public is essential to success. You can have the most logical argument possible, but in order to truly teach, inform, persuade, or defend, you need to present your ideas with conviction and confidence.

Yet this is often easier said than done. Many of us have a deep fear of public speaking. Or we think it\'s just an intuitive talent that can\'t be learned. But according to award-winning Professor John R. Hale of the University of Louisville, a masterful public speaker who has delivered more than 1,000 speeches to all manner of audiences, that couldn\'t be further from the truth.

All it takes is confidence, practice, and the knowledge of time-tested techniques and strategies used by history\'s greatest public speakersâ€”all of which you\'ll find in The Art of Public Speaking: Lessons from the Greatest Speeches in History. This 12-lecture course is your guide to the secrets of this essential skill, an insider\'s look at what makes history\'s enduring speeches so unforgettable, and an invaluable reference tool you can use any time you have to speak your mind.
