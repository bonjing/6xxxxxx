Songs in Red and Gray is the sixth studio album release by New York-based singer/songwriter and musician Suzanne Vega. The album was Vega's final album for A&M Records (with whom she had been with since 1983) and also marks the divorce with her husband and producer Mitchell Froom. Lyrically, most of the songs deal with the ending of the marriage, notably Widow's Walk, If I Were a Weapon, and Soap and Water ("slip me loose of this wedding band").
