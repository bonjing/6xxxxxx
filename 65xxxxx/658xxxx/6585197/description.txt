Clinical Anatomy has remained the word of the same author for nearly half a century. Initially written for clinical medical students on the wards, clinics and revising for Finals, since then it has sold all over the world in hundreds of thousands and in several languages. Its success has been its constant revision to ensure it covers the student's needs. Today, it also covers the bulk of the anatomy required in the MRCS Part I, II, III and provides an excellent revision text for these candidates and medical students in a concise form with clear, easily reproduced diagrams
