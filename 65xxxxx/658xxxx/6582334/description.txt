With the increased need for competent avian practitioners and the formation of avian specialty programs worldwide, clinicians as well as academics are required to have a more comprehensive understanding of applied anatomy, physiology, internal medicine, pharmacology, disease management and preventative medicine. Avian Medicine: Principles and Application was developed to provide a definitive reference text that blends the science of health with the art of clinical medicine. By applying the information presented in the book, the competent avian practitioner will be able to effectively provide the highest quality care for his patients and guide the companion bird client or aviculturist in implementing and effective preventative health programme. Less experienced practitioners can learn basic evaluation, support and surgical techniques while developing an expanded understanding of advanced procedures that can be performed by specialists in avian medicine and surgery. Avian Medicine: Principles and Application is the essential reference and the most comprehensive why to, when to and how to guide for companion and aviary bird management, medicine and surgery.
