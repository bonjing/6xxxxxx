^How To Play:


If you are hosting make sure it says that server IP address is 127.0.0.1 default

Although when hosting, the other players are going to need Your IP not the default to connect

If you are game host you need to start SarFriend Server first.

Start Server_0.44 located in SC2 directory /Server

^Now start StarCraft 2.


As username use lan.sc2c@dark.blizzz and password gg

Game host need to connect first!

You will be named Slayer

Now to create game click Multiplayer Game, select Game Mode, Race and click Create Game

Chose map and create game.

I Game Lobby click + Players and invite players (other players first need to be connected to server to join)

PS: You need to give other players your IP address so they can connect



^Other Players:


Other players to join game host's game need to add host's IP address to configuration file.

You need to edit config file located in SC2 directory
