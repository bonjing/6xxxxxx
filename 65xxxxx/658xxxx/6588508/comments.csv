,stark13,2011-10-10T14:02Z,why do black bars appear if it is 1080p and in a 16:1 ratio..the first 9 min of the movie was awesome since it filled my screen and then the black bars appear now and then towards the end..
,stark13,2011-10-13T17:33Z,sorry for the above comment..its seems that its because certain scenes are shot in imax..my bad
,MWisBest,2011-10-16T01:13Z,"I don't see how you can call a 1080p rip at 1460kbps good quality. The minimum bitrate that should even be used on 720p is 4000kbps and for animated 720p movies 2300kbps. This is 1080p, so you need an even higher bitrate because of the increased amount of pixels. Minimum 1080p bitrate should be 8000kbps. Look this shit up..."
