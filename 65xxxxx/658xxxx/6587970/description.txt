In the summer of 1977, Saturday night fever ruled and the first thrashings of punk were being heard. By day temperatures soared on the sweltering streets of Manhattan but by night a serial killer dubbed the Son of Sam stalked the suburbs, indiscriminately shooting young brunettes and held New York City in a grip of terror.

Trying to make sense of their lives in this overwhelming atmosphere of fear and suspicion are Vinny, a streetwise Casanova indulging in affairs under the nose of his loving wife, Dionna, and Ritchie, a punk musician moonlighting as a male stripper.

As the murder's actions impact on all their lifestyles, they start to suspect the killer might be someone from their own neighborhood - or even one of their own friends.

From the controversial director Spike Lee comes his boldest and most ambitious film brilliantly capturing the sights, sounds and sexual attitudes of the 1970s.
