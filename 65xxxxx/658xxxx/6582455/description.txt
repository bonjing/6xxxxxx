Glenn Kaiser & Darrell Mansfield - Trimmed And Burnin' & Slow Burn (2-CD set)
This is a two-fer CD of two separate CD releases from Glenn Kaiser and Darrell Mansfield. Kaiser was a founding member of the Resurrection Band (REZ) in the early 70s, and Mansfield had his own Christian rock band around the same time. The two turned to blues music later in their careers.

On these tracks, Kaiser plays acoustic guitar and sings, and Mansfield plays harp and sings. Both musicians are among the best on their instruments. Kaiser can play a mean slide guitar, and Mansfield is plainly one of the top blues harp players around.

The duo cover traditional gospel blues songs by Blind Willie Johnson and Rev. Gary Davis, along with some original tunes by Kaiser. All songs are acoustic, without bass or drums, and minimal overdubs.

Whether you're a country blues fanatic or a Christian looking for something besides the same CCM music, you will enjoy these two professionals singing songs from their heart and soul.
