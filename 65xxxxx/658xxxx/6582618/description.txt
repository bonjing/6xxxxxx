1. Download Ubuntu

2. Burn your CD or create a USB drive
Once you\'ve finished downloading your file, you\'ll need to create a CD or USB drive.
 
Why do I need a CD?

Burning a CD means that you can trial Ubuntu without affecting your current system. And you can install it alongside or instead of your system whenever you\'re ready.

3.Try it!
You can try out Ubuntu before you install it. When your CD or USB stick is ready, you can run Ubuntu directly from your CD or USB without affecting your current system.

4. Install It!
When the CD is ready, simply put it in your CD drive, restart your computer and follow the instructions that appear on your screen.
