,Newb787,2011-08-06T21:38Z,"Download works, installation instructions do not work with Windows 7 #fail"
,Shazam_777,2011-08-06T22:34Z,"I agree with the previous comment. I have 6.13 patched and this method won't work with Windows 7.  Furthermore, this download is incomplete. This is NOT a Mapsource Installation. There is no setup.exe files, nor are there are any junctionview files, or .tmz files.

This is a half-assed first attempt. It's wise to wait until someone else posts a complete working and useful instructions.   I think you may get that from another torrent site though ;)"
,Ipmark,2011-08-06T23:25Z,"You don't need Setup.exe.
In Windows 7 systems, simply put the .gmap folder in C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\GARMIN\Maps and start Mapsource, the program will recognize automatically the map.
Then you have to unlock it."
,Ipmark,2011-08-06T23:33Z,"And THIS IS a Mapsource installation.
Mapsource doesn't use Junction view, 3D-Buildings and Time-Zone files ...."
,Shazam_777,2011-08-07T02:24Z,"Ipmark. I still couldn't get it to work using your method. I did a workaround though. I used mapreverse converter and it installed 6.13. Now it works. 

Are you able to get your hands on additional files such as junction view and upload it for the various devices?"
,Ipmark,2011-08-07T09:44Z,"Ok. In some Seven systems the .gmap folder can be putted in C:\ProgramData\GARMIN\Maps.
Check if you have this folder.

Today I will start the 3D-Buildings (Unlocked) and the Junction View torrents."
,JoeRonda,2011-08-13T01:48Z,"Thanks Ipmark, for the maps.
Is it normal to not see any side streets on these maps?  I don't remember if my original 2008 pre-load had them or not.  I don't use it alot."
,Ipmark,2011-08-13T15:10Z,"First, the perfect GPS map doesn't exist.
In my country the coverage is good, but not absolute, smaller roads are missing.
Including the smaller roads, the map would become too large and too complex.

Sometimes large roads are missing too .... :)"
,shrifty,2011-08-15T04:39Z,"I do not have a patched copy of Mapsource and it worked with no issues.  Installed using the instructions, unlocked map with Jetmouse keygen."
,shrifty,2011-08-15T04:50Z,"I do not have a patched version of Mapsource, and was able to install with the provided instructions with no issues."
,GreyGold,2011-08-19T22:11Z,"Thanks a bunch!  Is there any sort of writeup on just what ""unlock mapset.exe"" does?  Does it accomplish something more than unlocking via JetMouse's keygen?"
,Norbert99,2011-08-29T03:25Z,"Worked great for me.  I copied the .gmap folder into the same directory as my other Garmin maps.  The new map showed up in Mapsource as locked.   I ran the unlock mapset.exe copy that is in the .gmap folder.   It ran for about a minute. The new map now shows in Mapsource as ""Not lockable"" and is fully accessible.  ""Not lockable"" is what maps like Worldmap which don't require unlocking normally show.  Didn't need the Jetmouse Keygen.  Didn't need to update or patch Mapsource.   

Thanks Ipmark for this and other great postings!"
,Olegken,2011-09-10T18:18Z,Can somebody share image file of the map?

,gspa72,2011-09-22T00:58Z,"Ipmark would this work with Nuvi 255W? Can I also use the ""Junction View and 3D Buildings files""?"
,gspa72,2011-09-22T01:01Z,"I'm new at this guys so please bare with me. Ipmark I would like to know if this would work with my Nuvi 255w? Also if ""Junction View and 3D Buildings files"" will work too?"
,Ipmark,2011-09-22T10:51Z,"This map works on all Nuvis, but your Nuvi 255W doesn't support 3D Buildings and Junction View files."

Follow the instructions !

Make sure you have Mapsource v6.16.3 installed. The patched version is availble from TPB.

1. There is no install, for Windows 7 just copy the folder to.....
 C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\GARMIN\Maps

You will have to enable viewing of hidden folders to see this path.

2. Use the keygen to unlock the map in mapsource, as follows.....

You will need your unit ID number !
You can do this from the unit or in mapsource.

In mapsource click on Utilities > Get Unit ID from the menu bar. The program will take a second and display your deviceâ€™s unit ID (make sure your GPS is plugged into your computer to get this). You will need this number for the keygen.

Now, start the keygen and enter your ID number in the first space, where it says ""enter unit ID here:

You don't need an unlock code for software so that alone and go to the bottom for ""select map prodouct""
Here you will select ""custom maps"". A custom mapset popup will appear, enter ""2484"" in field and click OK.
Next, hit the generate tab. This will give you the unlock code for the 2012 map according to your unit ID.

Lastly, open mapsource and click on the ""utilities"" tab and select ""manage map products"". You will see the map in there. Click on the ""unlock regions"" tab and then select ""add"", which is to the right. This is where you will paste the unlcok code from the keygen.
It goes in the first space, there's no need to enter anything below it in the comment space.

Thats it ! The map is unlocked.

If you can't see the map make sure it is selected in the ""view"" tab (view>switch to product) and select the 2012 map.

,RAWBits,2011-11-04T20:46Z,"Comment by Norbert99 on 8/29/11 is right on.  It worked for me (Win 7 Pro 64-bit) and was much simpler than the instructions supplied.  Much thanks to both Norbert99 and Ipmark.   BTW, the map storage directory is C:\ProgramData\Garmin\Maps.  The GMAP directory in the RAR file can be extracted (I use WinZip) directly to there."
,Mertes,2011-11-07T20:13Z,"HELP.  (please!)

Ok.  I have been at this for a couple of hours and can't seem to get it patched in Mapsource v6.16.3.

I have tried copying the .img file to the folders:
C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\GARMIN\Maps
AND
C:\ProgramData\Garmin\Maps

I can't get it pulled up in Mapsource no matter what I do...  

Can anyone please tell me what I'm doing wrong?  What step to take next? 

Thanks much!"
,Ipmark,2011-11-09T09:10Z,"You have to copy THE .GMAP FOLDER in ..... \Maps folder not the .img files ....

If you want unlock the installation, put unlock mapset.exe in the .gmap folder and run it."

i have no clue what i am doing. would you be able to help me? thanks.."
