From wikipedia:
Warren Ellis announced the project at the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con which the statement : "I've written two hundred pages and I still have no idea what it's aboutâ€¦ it's retro-punk, it's near future steampunk"[1] It was launched on February 15, 2008. New installments are released in six full-colour page episodes every week,[2][3] a schedule that allows the story the chance to grow naturally.[4]

The story grew out of Ellis' question as to what would have happened if the Midwich Cuckoos had survived and grown to "disaffected and confused twenty-one-year-olds." The story builds on the legacy of John Wyndham's style of disaster fiction.[5]

The series will run for 144 episodes, completing on Friday, August 5th, 2011.

Ellis' synopsis of the plot involves characters "living in a post-flood London that they might possibly have had something to do with."[1] The so-called FreakAngels, who possess telepathy and many other "special" abilities, such as space-time manipulation/distortion, and pyrokinesis, live in Whitechapel.[3]

As the story progresses, eleven of the FreakAngels are introduced and their role in the community is expanded. For the most part cooperatively they have created a small community of roughly three hundred people with fresh water, watch towers, markets, home-grown vegetables and a medical clinic. Their society is threatened, however, externally from refugee attacks and internally from personal conflicts and crime.
