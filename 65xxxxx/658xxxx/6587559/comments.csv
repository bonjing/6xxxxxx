Picture is, obviously, a cam and not a dvd rip, but upon this first skim the picture and sound quality seemed very good.

As advised, adding the following trackers DID increase my download speed (two to 3 times as fast in my case)- yet my download speed is still fairly slow, but thats what we get when one figures the seeders versus seeders (supply and demand).

http://tracker.istole.it/announce
http://tracker.publicbt.com/announce
http://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce
http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce
udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce
http://exodus.1337x.org/announce
udp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce
udp://tracker.istole.it:80/announce

Adding these trackers may not always result in increased speeds, but it sure does not hurt in this case. As said, in my case it directly resulted in faster download speeds, and the increased speed may not exactly be anything ""to write home about either""- at least until this torrent gets maybe a few thousand more connecting (which no doubt it will soon)."

I can not understand the members that complain of the quality of this. I watched it on a 46 inch TV via my Pc and VLC Media Player and I would say the video is in-between VHS tape and Dvd quality. Audio at 128kbps is fine for most any movie.

So, the quality is the BEST I have ever seen in about a full decade from a Cam (video). Also as said, the audio sync is right on the money with no background noise, just the audio of the movie. I would say this is actually worth burning to Disc as I can not see a normal DVD Rip being much better than this.  "

It is very unlikely that you'll find a better copy until the dvd / bluray rips come out.

No ads, no audience, and except for about 4 seconds at the very beginning of the film, no camera obstructions. Clear audio and clear picture with nothing too dark to see. Ignore the idiots that are giving this a 2 or saying it's completely unwatchable. Fucking ridiculous.

@ashen77- on a side note, I liked the way they used ""that"" line. The scene in question was just as pivotal in this movie as it was in the original. "

Take MY word for it. 

Quality based on dvd quality: if hd is 10, id give it a 6 or even a 7 for both audio and video. but its not hd so you cant rate it on those.. you could watch this on a 50'' flat screen easy thats how good the cam quality is.

In the cage Caesar says to the other ape something about being able to talk. The other ape says he was in the circus. I think Caesar asks for a way out. The other ape shrugs.

Time when he has the sticks. ""Apes, alone weak. Apes together strong"" Then the other ape says ""Apes dumb"""

You can watch the film directly from vuze or utorrent or whatever program you use to download the file, but I will recommend VLC, because it plays almost anything. 
I hope this answered your question :)"

,therealDIZZLE,2011-10-12T03:34Z,"It makes me sad and a bit disgusted that people can't control themselves... even moreso when they lash out at people they don't know over stupid comments - grow up.  These comments aren't here for you guys to verbally molest each other; they're intended for comments on quality, and questions/support when needed... which is actually why I came here, for english subs, thinking that somewhere in the comments would be an answer to my dilemma... instead I see ignorance rearing its ugly head yet again.  First of all, to say that ALL Americans are fat, lazy, greedy, etc. is the same as saying all blondes or anyone from Poland is stupid; or that anyone who uses profanity to make a very obtuse point of view or personal opinion are considered rude, obnoxious, and considered oxygen thieves who only help to perpetuate the cycle of social de-evolution that's tearing apart the human aspect of humanity....... 
Well, okay, that last part is mostly true, but my point stands as this:  if you can't comment on the quality of the torrent or offer some kind of constructive help toward those who have legitimate questions, then don't even bother commenting at all:  If you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say anything.
As for the torrent, awesome quality; one of the best TS ul's I've seen in a while.  Thanks for the upload."

You said: ""Oh btw, Americans should be banned from TPB? You really are an idiot and it makes me laugh! If it wasn't for ""Evil America"" the WOULD NOT BE A PIRATEBAY...why? WE INVENTED THE INTERNET YOU DUMBASS!""

LOL, America did not invent the internet!!! It was 'invented' over about 3 decades by different people from different parts of the world. But if it wasn't for the telephone there would be no internet, so if we were to get technical, this all down to the Scottish - Alexander Graham Bell was born in Scotland.

You should have just said: 
"" If it wasn't for ""Evil America"" the WOULD NOT BE A PIRATEBAY...why? BECAUSE NEARLY EVERYTHING ON IT WAS MADE IN AMERICA. YOU DUMBASS!""
