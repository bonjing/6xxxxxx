                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Documentary examining the life of the late singer-songwriter, who died on
 Saturday July 23. On stage, she was one of the most gifted female vocalists of
 modern times, but away from the spotlight, the demons of drunken binges, drug
 abuse and an explosive relationship with Blake Fielder-Civil led her to spiral
 out of control. Featuring interviews with her former husband and mother-in-law
 Georgette, this documentary reveals the reality of her life away from the 
 headlines.
                        
                                 Enjoy!
