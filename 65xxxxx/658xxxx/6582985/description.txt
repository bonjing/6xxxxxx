2011 release from the L.A. based Punk-edged rockers. The World In Shambles is the follow up to their 2009 debut Loss of Desire and showcases the bandâ€™s growth with 18-year-old singer/guitarist Bruno Mascolo coming into his own. Completely recorded live to two inch tape, the album has bottled the bandâ€™s firecracker live energy and onstage prowess. Drive A is not your older brotherâ€™s Emo band or your dadâ€™s Punk Rock. Drive A represents a new awakened generation and attitude. â€˜The World In Shamblesâ€™ was recorded with Dave Cobb and Julian Raymond, mixed by Chris Lord Alge.
