RealVNC Enterprise Edition 4.6.1

==============================================================================

VNC has a wide range of applications including system administration, 
IT support and helpdesks. It can also be used to support the mobile 
user, both for hot desking within the enterprise and also to provide 
remote access at home, or on the road. The system allows several 
connections to the same desktop, providing an invaluable tool for 
collaborative or shared working in the workplace or classroom. Computer 
support within the geographically spread family is an ever popular use.

For the individual user, one common scenario is using VNC to help 
troubleshoot the computer of a distant less-technically-savvy relative. 
In other words, sitting at your desk in Baltimore, you could use VNC to 
take control of your relative's PC in California and show them how to 
install and use some new software package by actually doing it yourself.

A very common business application of VNC is in remote system administration, 
where it is used to allow administrators to take control of employee machines 
to diagnose and fix problems, or to access and administer server machines 
without making a trip to the console. VNC can also be used to provide a flexible 
hot-desking and road-warrior environment by allowing employees to access their 
office desktop and server machines from any machine in the company's offices or 
from other remote sites, regardless of the type of computers involved at either 
end.

VNC is widely used in educational contexts, for example to allow a distributed 
group of students simultaneously to view a computer screen being manipulated by 
an instructor, or to allow the instructor to take control of the students' 
computers to provide assistance.
