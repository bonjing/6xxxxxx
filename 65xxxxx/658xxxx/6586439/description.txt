	NOTES:
	
	--crf 21 slow (The excessive grain made 19 quite large
	with no quality upgrade.)
	
	Unlike the old pres by DIMENSION I chose to IVTC even
	though source is hybrid. About 4.30 of total runtime 
	should not have IVTC applied, but leaving dupe frames
	for the remaining 16+ minutes felt wrong. The two short
	sketches were low motion so the missing frames doesn't 
	hurt too much. 
	
	INFO:
	
	MINDTHEGAP is living up to its groupname. We do mind all
	the gaps in archives out there. If we see a rerun airing
	of unreleased eps from series we try to get it. If the
	show is really old and the hope of finding the original
	release is gone, we try to fix that too with iNTERNALs. 
	
	This of course makes our releases a bit random and some
	might think we are mad but there will be a reason behind
	the madness.
