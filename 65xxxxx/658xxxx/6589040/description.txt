The Rolling Stones are an English rock band, formed in London in April 1962 by Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica), Ian Stewart (piano), Mick Jagger (lead vocals, harmonica, guitar) and Keith Richards (guitar, vocals). Bassist Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts completed the early line-up. The Rolling Stones raised the international regard for the primitive blues typified by Chess Records' artists such as Muddy Waters, who wrote the song Rollin' Stone after which the band is named. R&B and blues cover songs dominated the Rolling Stones' early material, but their repertoire has always included rock and roll. Critic and musicologist Robert Palmer, says the Rolling Stones's endurance and relevance is a result of being "rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music", while "more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone".
Jones initially led the band, but after teaming as songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed leadership. By 1969 Jones' diminishing contributions to the band and his inability to tour the United States for legal and health reasons led to him leaving the band. Three weeks after his departure, Jones drowned. His immediate replacement Mick Taylor stayed with the band until 1974, and was replaced by Ronnie Wood. Wyman retired from the band in 1993, and his replacement Darryl Jones is not a full member. Stewart was taken from the official line-up in 1963 to continue as the band's road manager and occasional keyboardist until his death in 1985. Since 1982, Chuck Leavell has been the band's primary keyboardist.
First popular in Europe, the Rolling Stones quickly became successful in North America during the British Invasion of the mid 1960s. Having released 22 studio albums in the United Kingdom (24 in the United States), nine concert albums (ten in the US) and numerous compilations; their worldwide sales are estimated at more than 200 million albums. Sticky Fingers (1971) began a string of eight consecutive studio albums reaching number one in the United States. Their most recent album of entirely new material, A Bigger Bang, was released in 2005. In 1989 the Rolling Stones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 2004 they ranked number 4 in Rolling Stone magazine's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked the Rolling Stones at number ten on "The Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists", and as the second most successful group in the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

The early albums and singles released from 1963 to 1967 were originally released on Decca Records in the UK, and on London Records in the US, often in a variety of different forms.
It was common practice in the music industry prior to 1967 for British releases to be reconfigured for the American market. In some cases, the US version would feature a different track listing, cover, and sometimes even title from its UK counterpart. The first five Rolling Stones albums were converted into eight LPs for American consumption, adding material from non-album singles and the UK EPs, and adding the concert documentary Got Live If You Want It!. The two Big Hits singles packages, respectively from 1966 and 1969, differ in each nation, and in the case of December's Children (And Everybody's) and Flowers, there are no UK counterparts. After The Beatles insisted that their magnum opus, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, be released internationally in identical configuration regarding cover and track order, the practice was quickly abandoned. Rolling Stones' LP releases from Their Satanic Majesties Request in 1967 are uniform in both the UK and the US, except for the abovementioned Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2).
