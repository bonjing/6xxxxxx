All of which he has according to his lawyer admitted quite openly and readily.Some things are as simple as they seem and you do a disservice to yourself and others by trying to make this incident to be more or less than the atrocity it is. If you are indeed sincere in your desire to root out conspiracies, best that you look elsewhere and put your energy to constructive use."
