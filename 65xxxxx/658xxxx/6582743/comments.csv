The only thing that stands out is episode 19 is watermarked and apparently recorded from The Hub, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hub_%28TV_channel%29), whom are advertising for the cartoon in line after this episode.
Else the torrent is flawless :)"
,DeMasque,2011-09-28T05:34Z,"@Atomoxetin Well, the Hub version of episode 19 has a few extra seconds worth of Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy at approximately 12:41 that other versions seem to lack. Take some comfort in that?"
