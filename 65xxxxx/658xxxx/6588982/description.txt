This is Star Wars Empire at War. Forces of corruption is optional.

Installation Instructions:

1. Burn EAWGold (Size 2.85GB) or mount using DAEMON Tools (Daemon Tools installer is included)

2. Use the serial cd44-a63-ddb-9ac7-na20 for Empire at War
  and cd44-a68-7fa-defc-na20 for Forces of Corruption.

3. Have fun!

Note: You must mount the EAWGold again to play it.

P.S. The reason being if you bought the game you would put the disc in, the EAWGold acts like the disc.
