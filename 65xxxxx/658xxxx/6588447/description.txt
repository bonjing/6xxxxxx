Book Description
================
Often called the greatest novel ever written, War and Peace is at once 
an epic of the Napoleonic wars, a philosophical study, and a celebration 
of the Russian spirit. Tolstoy's genius is clearly seen in the multitude 
of characters in this massive chronicle, all of them fully realized 
and equally memorable. Out of this complex narrative emerges a profound 
examination of the individual's place in the historical process, one 
that makes it clear why Thomas Mann praised Tolstoy for his Homeric 
powers and placed War and Peace in the same category as The Iliad.

War and Peace was translated by Louise and Aylmer Maude.

About the reader:

Alexander Scourby
November 13, 1913 - February 22, 1985

The precise, mellifluous voice of Alexander Scourby, trained in Shakespearean 
roles in the 1930's and perfected in radio dramatic parts in the 1940's, 
became a well-known sound on Broadway, in motion pictures, and on television, 
where as Harriet Van Horne has observed, he is "the most sensitive and 
knowing narrator in the business." His most appreciative audience, however, 
is found among the nearly 80,000 borrowers of Talking Books, the recordings 
of literature produced under the supervision of the Division for the 
Blind of the Library of Congress for the use of the legally blind. Scourby, 
during his lifetime recorded over 500 books for the blind and has described 
his recording of Audio books as, "the one work that really means something 
to me."
