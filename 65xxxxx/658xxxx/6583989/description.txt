Whether extracting ingredients from a block of ice or using a Swiss Army knife as a lone
cooking utensil, three chefs are pushed to their physical and mental limits in each episode
of Extreme Chef.

107 - Survive the Farm
3 chefs travel to a farm to dig for their own ingredients,
but a powerful dust storm stops them in their tracks.
And 1 chef almost quits after a cow he's milking goes mad.
