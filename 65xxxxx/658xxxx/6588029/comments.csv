,Leonidas123,2011-08-12T20:44Z,"hmm seeders are getting less, leechers are constant.
Plz seed, at least 1:1
I have never in my life done below 1:1.
Few people keep torrent alive, rest are shameless."

,Leonidas123,2011-11-11T19:56Z,"No man no idea as to why its stuck at 87%, i am seeding. TPB had auto disabled my account for un-known reason, i some how got it back. Usually TPM ban me every 3 months. For unknown reasons. I just make new account an login. :) 
This time i could recover my account."
