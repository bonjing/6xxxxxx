Yes it's the full Suit, The Gamma Ray, Subspace,Flagship,Star Trek,Solar Flare,RedShit. All 32Bit & 64Bit installer's..  Just forgot to Mention the Theme looks for an Update, & with some AV's we all know they can be a little over Zelus, So some may sound off.."" IT'S A FALSE POSITIVE "" & Nothing to worry about. It's the "" Update.dll"" Looking for update's to the theme only ok..
Peace out & Enjoy people.. Please vote & Comment.."

,CodeMeRight,2011-09-28T01:24Z,"Thanks "" henrick "" although i find i have to reinstall the theme sometimes as folder icons change. But since it's a installer it only take a few seconds.

Also "" madman91x "" Am sorry mate i can't honestly tell you if they work on xp  i never used xp. But i do hope you do find some use for them."

,CodeMeRight,2011-11-03T16:02Z,Lmfao ok. if you say so... if some dude wants to make himself look big by commenting on my up's.. then hell let him troll. ask me if i care.... you live & learn Kid
,CodeMeRight,2011-11-03T19:35Z,"PS
