Genre - Action | Adventure | Crime | Drama | Thriller 

Show nfo - A unique bodyguard masquerades as his clients in order to draw out and eliminate threats to their lives. 

More nfo - Christopher Chance is a highly discreet problem solver, specializing in desperate causes. He works with retired police detective Winston, who acts mainly as back-office, and Guerrero, a scary computer wizard and former gangster. Christopher is, and needs to be, a fearless unbeatable commando as well as handy and clever as McGyver, assuming all kinds of identities, from bodyguard to monk and from lawyer to sports professional. 

Review - This review will be brief. Human Target is a show that has good acting and a good story line. It has enough action to be a movie, and that makes the show a keeper. I'm not sure what it takes to keep a show like this on the air, but it has been one of my favorite TV series ever. Christopher Chance, the main character, was a professional assassin, and is now a bodyguard for hire. The past of the team is used to easily write new episodes, and keeps the show from exhausting ideas for story lines. Like other reviews have said, Christopher Chance is a great mix between James Bond and Jason Bourne. This movie is not 100% action though. Human Target also has comedy and some romance intertwined.

Omg, i love this show alot! so does my mom!
