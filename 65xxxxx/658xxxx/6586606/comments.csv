,EricViking,2011-08-12T20:24Z,"Anyone get this working...recive moviedata from internet, and not get Trial expired?"
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2011-09-10T18:07Z,"For everyone having issues with it suddenly saying trial expired, you need to pace yourself.

With previous versions of this (cracked), i was unable to do more than 50 movies automatically at a time without it suddenly saying that.

Your ip gets blocked.
So change your ip address, and do it again, but only select about 30 movies at a time.
You still may get it every now and then (i thought i was being careful, but happened after about 130 movies), but simply change ip and alls good again.

Easy way to change ip address is to disconnect your router for... 5 minutes - works with most - or connect through a proxy."
,jamallachgar,2011-09-15T09:32Z,"cheers,works fine"
,jamallachgar,2011-09-15T09:43Z,"I added 3000 tv shows and 400 movies at once to my collection.
It works as long as you do not run it before you place the crack in the right folder."
,lkadar,2011-09-22T11:48Z,Thanks Dude. It works perfect!
,TrexWarrior,2012-01-15T09:13Z,Works fine as long as you don't run it before you complete the crack. Thanks for the upload but I chose to uninstall.. Didn't like the GUI (personal opinion). I guess I have severe OCD I just like things that look nice... lol
,gooberty1,2012-04-07T19:07Z,"Great Up bro, easy install, works perfectly...ignore the toolz and takerz...."
,kuflinks,2012-04-15T00:26Z,"Like Dude says, follow the directions, and it will work. I have more than 900 DVD/BR movies that were instantly visible in v8 (had been running v6.6). "
,trrsxxx,2012-06-10T00:06Z,"I did everything correct (installed, did not run before I'd replaced the executable with the crack) but it still went ""Search failed, Trial edition expired"" halfway through my 800 movie collection."
