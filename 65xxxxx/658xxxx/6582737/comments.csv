,TechnoMax,2011-08-04T19:02Z,"thanks, you're a life saver - with all the fake avis and huge 720 mkvs of this out there, this is very good quality with amazingly small size :)"
,the.snf,2011-08-04T19:28Z,indeed! What's going on with the 4th series anyway ? Why so late and why file sizes differ from ussual?
,starkhalo,2011-08-04T19:32Z,thanks 20-40!!
,iskara,2011-08-04T19:36Z,"This must be either a fake, or the people who left comments downloaded this and aren't seeding.  Everyone is stuck at 99.3%"
,TechnoMax,2011-08-04T19:52Z,"no fake, 54 seeds and 100+ leeches atm"

,the.snf,2011-08-04T20:20Z,"no fake, just finished watching. Quality is better than what you expect by having a file half the size"
,artgrrrl,2011-08-04T21:08Z,@twentyforty: You rule! Thank you!
,thruster77,2011-08-04T21:13Z,"Thanks, but why so small reso? 720p is minimum these days."
,LazarusL,2011-08-04T21:22Z,"About time someone has emerged who's willing to do EZTV's job for it. Wonder why they stopped carrying this program 3 weeks ago: they either don't know, or are too embarrassed to say. All praise to twentyforty for getting the job done.  And I too appreciate the modest file size in this age of limited bandwidth."
,fasurvivor,2011-08-04T22:36Z,"thanks

Not everyone who downloads illegal video files owns a high def television.  Most still watch on the good old fashioned computer screen--or even netbook, judging from the vast numbers that have been sold over the last 2 years.  None of them require 720p--many stutter from video/cpu overload--as does my November2009 netbook, and my 2003 desktop; both play 480p quality videos quite nicely, thank you--even on my new 23"" LCD screen.  It is dipshits like you that cause good people to miss out on their favorite shows because the small-size encoders have ""left the building"".  Aren't you proud of yourself?"
