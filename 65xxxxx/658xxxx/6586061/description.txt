Battle of the Coral Sea (1959), 86 min, mono, black and white, English. Quality is very good.

Rare oldie with Cliff Robertson. The title is misleading. The film is about subs and POWs with a few pretty girls tossed in. The battle is mentioned, but only briefly. 

Other old war films avalible, see V100 (above).

Please help seed.
