Computers might be better than us at Jeopardy, but how about on a racetrack? It's man versus computer as the gang races a computer-controlled BMW around Laguna Seca Raceway. Later, Dan Neil ditches his usual cardigan for a helmet and fire suit and to find out what dirt-track racing is all about, and the guys debate who builds the best convertible sports car in the world, the Europeans or the good old US of A? Special Guest: the legendary Pete Brock, designer of the iconic Shelby Daytona Coupe.
