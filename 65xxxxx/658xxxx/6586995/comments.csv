,Marv70,2011-08-06T19:44Z,"Dear Mr. Extremezone,
First of all, thank you so very much for the great entertainment over the many years. I am old and hard of hearing and use subtitles for all the movies I can. FXG uploads always contain a subtitle .srt file that for me makes the movie so much more enjoyable. If you could include a subtitle .srt file with your movies, I and the many delft and hard of hearing fans would be forever in your debt. If this is impossible, I do understand and keep doing the good work you are doing.. Thank you again.

[V],extremezone,2011-08-06T20:11Z,"@Marv70 i usually upload scene releases-or personal but as soon as they are available (sometimes few minutes after a specific group announce time) , FXG uploads movies after few days far on the original release and this is the reason i don't include subtitles...also some groups don't release a movie with subpack and all needs few days to make others subs

after downloading a movie make a search on (i you can't find none try again in 2-3 days): 

subscene.com
opensubtitles.org
tinysubs.com

google for more"
,MOSOBOH,2011-08-06T21:35Z,"Dear Marv,

My wife is also deaf and I understand how you feel, it would only be selfish of me to watch a movie without subs with her... so I try very hard to find the subs on most of Extremezones ups....... so from now on when I find the proper subs for Extremezones ups ill post the link on the comment section, if I can find them that is...

P.S. thank you Extremezone for the magnificent ups!"
,Marv70,2011-08-06T21:51Z,"Wow! Thank you for the fast information. Is this what they call texting? I have been doing as you say and most of the download .srt files are fake or very badly done - out of sync subtitles. The best for English is from EngSub.net. 

Is there a place I can learn how to upload movies and is it safe to do â€“ do you have to use proxies or Virtual Private Networks? Could I upload them to you and you could make them available for the TPB? I see the â€œNote: If you have something to offer, etc.â€ But I can not seem to find the website: torentz 3xforum ro? Thank you and I promise not to bother or annoy you again. You are my HERO!!!

[V],extremezone,2011-08-06T22:09Z,"@Marv70 i don't use proxies because my country piracy is not a problem,even is in the 2-3 first place on world in this domain (about 70-80% citizien with internet are downloading movies from the net) , i'm using proxies only on few sites were i'm blucked or where access is limited just for a range or ip's (bulgaria,russia,etc) 

also if you want to start sharing torrent you can use tpb forum http://suprbay.org/ (sorry i don't have the time to make tutorials again-already lots of others asked)"

who renamed the file for unknown reason


(It's from the torrent info text box)"

Sorta similar to The Blind Side but with some more realistic perspectives to it.  The lead actor, Paul something, is awesome at everything he does."
