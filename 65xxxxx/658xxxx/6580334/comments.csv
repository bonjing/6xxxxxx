I take it this means the CD version doesn't come with the 13th track, ""Broken Glass"" that's on the iTunes version? (And can't be bought off there separately) That sucks because Broken Glass should be hilarious from what was heard on the show.

It looks like they didn't put the version of Best Friends Brother with Ariana Grande singing backup on the CD (The version from Prom Wrecker), but just the official single version. :( 

Leave it all to shine is the version with the rest of the cast though. :)

The entire CD is worth it just for the full version of Ariana and Liz in ""Give it Up"" though. 

Thanks again for the upload :D"

Perhaps the song needs to be re-ripped and re-up the cd? Thanks for your efforts."
