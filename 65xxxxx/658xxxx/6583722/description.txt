Quote:
Take a trip back in time on Robert Blochâ€™s That Hellbound Train! Join Martin, an out-of-luck orphan, as he struggles to fulfill the American dream. As Martin comes of age, fate conspires against him at every turn. On the verge of giving up hope, our young protagonist is visited by a monstrous train, one whose conductor might just have a ticket to fame and riches... if Martin is willing to pay the price! Scribes Joe and John Lansdale ( 30 Days of Night: Night, Again) and artist Dave Wachter bring this unique tale of American folklore to life!
