@sconzz - There is a thing that we Bay users like to 
call the Files section. It's located just under the name of the torrent at the top."

,mongoloid1,2011-09-17T16:26Z,"Well I guess it is passable. The picture is ok if you like people walking in front of the camera for that 'real' multiplex experience. I could almost smell the popcorn! Nice try, but get the camera level next time! What's so hard about that!?"
,AariMae,2011-09-23T06:17Z,"@sconzz Clearly, you are mentally challenged.  You see where it says ""Files:"" ? Use it.  

@MattGo74 Even though sconzz is retarded he did say portable device.  Googling VLC wouldn't help very much in that case would it ? .. Learn to read."
,SixLo,2011-09-28T03:38Z,"Hey sconzz. Try dumping Win Media Player and use VLC Player. MKV is fairly common. Portable device? Limited as to file types supported. If you're not sure, don't download it. That way you can avoid the gutter talk on a public site. Will agree tho, a little more info is nice. MORE is more in this case."
