,hei-ja33,2011-08-07T13:38Z,thanks! your torrents is good!!!!
,muLineZu,2011-08-07T13:58Z,"Thank you for the great uploads!
I have a question (as usual): which version is this one? There are 3 movies with the same name:
The Last Samurai (2003) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325710/
The Last Samurai (1991) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099987/
The Last Samurai (1977) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0123129/
The last one is spoken in Japanese, so (as you specified that the upload is spoken in English) from the other 2, which one is it?
And one more thing, is the source blu-ray? I'm asking as I must synchronize the right subtitle with the release, and it reduces the search.
Thanks! All the best!"
[T],murdoc47,2011-08-07T16:13Z,"this is the 2003 version with tom cruise. also the source is blu-ray. it has selectable subtitles, in english. thanks for the feedback!"
,MaddamVP,2011-09-13T05:04Z,"This is good quality video but the subtitles are USELESS. They only show subtitles for the ENGLISH speaking parts and not the NON-English parts.

Another fail for TPB. What happend to the old pirate bay where the VIP members were only allowed to release real 100% quality content? This is bull shit."

Agreed. Its usually better not to address idiots like him, he hasn't uploaded anything and obviously wouldn't have seeded anyways."
