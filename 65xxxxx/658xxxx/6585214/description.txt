Eric becomes drunk on Claudine\'s fairy blood and runs away from Sookie: he is able to daywalk and takes a swim in a lake. Sookie enlists Alcide\'s help in finding Eric. Jason escapes from Hotshot, pursued by werepanthers. He kills Felton and runs away from Crystal, and eventually collapses next to a highway: he is discovered by Hoyt and Jessica, who tries to heal his wounds. Nan Flanagan tells Bill that she does not believe the witches pose any real danger. Bill discovers that Portia Bellefleur is his descendant and ends their relationship. Meanwhile, Marnie is possessed by a witch named Antonia, whom she sees in a vision burned at the stake centuries ago. Lafayette, Jesus and Tara urge Marnie to reverse the spell she has put on Eric.
