If a man's biceps get stronger and harder with exercise, why can't his penis? The answer: It can. Despite popular belief, more than 1.3 million men have already learned the truth: The penis, like other muscles, is shapeable through exercises. For the first time ever, this book shows how you can:

Increase your penis size. (In a survey of nearly 1000 men who exercised their penis for three or more months, the average size increase was 1 inch in length and 0.5 inches in girth-a volumetric increase of fifty percent.)

Yield harder, stronger, and longer-lasting erections. (In one study, penis exercises improved erection strength just as much as erection drugs.)

Overcome premature ejaculation and have multiple orgasms. (A strong pelvic region built through penis exercising gives men control of their ejaculations.)

Endure dozens of other benefits. (A healthier penis and penile vascular system can increase libido, create stronger orgasms, and more.)
