It's about a year after Lurch69 made that comment, but I'll respond to it for the sake of future readers.

The idea is that if you constantly and deliberately break tissue down and let it heal each time, it'll grow back in excess prior to the last state it was in, as a response to its environment. 

And if anyone knows anything about cell growth in damaged areas of the anatomy, more tissue, more bone, or whatever it may be is placed in that region after each time it is healed.

Those who practice TKD, Muay Thai, and most other contact martial arts usually have more bone built in their shins (and other areas) due to constant, deliberate damaging of that region of the bone; the affected location becomes toughened to prevent future injuries. 

This happens with tissue too; if you continuously damage a specific part of your skin, get ready for an ugly deformity to form after each healing. It's the body's way of coping with its environment.

Any guitar players here? How long do your finger callouses stick around for? Mine stayed for about nine months of not playing and even after they were gone, the skin on the tips of my left fingers was tougher and shaped differently from the right fingers (which almost felt like girl fingers-tips compared to the left).

Don't get discouraged; it's worth the effort if you want it. Everybody's different, so it might take some of you longer than others to get results. Do 20-30 minutes sessions of exercises every other day and shoot for having a bigger dick next year. Shit, it's fun anyway, it's kind of like masturbation.

People who have not taken a single look at the exercises (or have never been to the gym before) seem to disqualify the word ""growth"" because the first thing that comes to their mind is the common thing that can grow on a body and the common method of doing so: ""muscle"" and ""weight lifting."" 

Weightlifting won't increase penile size because the penis is not a muscle; never said anything more true. But none of the exercises suggest weight lifting with your dick to enlarge it. Maybe using weights to pull-downward (an attempt of breaking tissue apart - be fucking careful, this is your dick).

Even some doctors disqualify penis enlargement, but read this shit, before I got into the medical field (the way I see it now) I used to think doctors were fucking magicians (like most of the population). Then I experienced stuff like this, ""So Jeremy, what do you think I should do for this patient? I have 4 different options; have you ever had experience with this type of case before?"" Most of them are fucking idiots. 

Becareful with your dicks.
