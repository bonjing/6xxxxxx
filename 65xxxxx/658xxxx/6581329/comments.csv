,kaiser818,2011-08-21T17:35Z,Hi. Do you think you can upload the entire f1 2006 season. Have been looking for ages and cant seem to find anything except the interlagos race. it will be greatly appretiated. cheers
,LiOnBliTz,2011-08-22T19:44Z,"I can upload the whole season here, but i think its around 25 GB in total and will take a lot of time for anyone to download.

although i will upload it here but what i suggest is to chose and download races you want one by one and seed as much as you can because big torrents needs a lot of seeding otherwise they become real slow.

next up, whole 2006 season. :-)"

,peco151,2011-09-03T12:01Z,seed pls
,raymond_u,2011-09-08T20:49Z,Blitz; why don't you delete this torrent and just focus on the whole 2006 season? People could also just download it off there.
