From the Infowars web site ::

Alex welcomes to the show Austin, Texas, business owner, artist and writer Genae Girard, who wrote Off the Rack, Chronicles of a Thirty-Something, Single, Breast Cancer Survivor. Girard is a plaintiff in a high-profile lawsuit filed by the ACLU against Myriad Genetics. Myriad holds the patent on the BRCA1 and 2 gene mutations, linked to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Myriad has a monopoly on genetic tests that identify the presence of the genes.

Alex also talks with the publisher of Trends Journal, business consultant and author Gerald Celente.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
