I don't think i've laughed that hard since he had Chris Rock on last march."
,AlfNader,2011-08-06T17:15Z,"TheChoZen1, you're an idiot. When you made your comment the torrent had just been uploaded so even if people wanted to seed they couldn't because they hadn't finished downloading.

I thought the demographic who watched Maher was rational and somewhat intelligent, hopefully you are just an outlier."
,LadyBabe,2011-08-06T17:16Z,I agree ChoZen1! Ppl need 2 seed! Plz!!
,Krass_Man_85,2011-08-07T10:25Z,"Chozen1, one day later there are 1860 seeds. I don't think you understand how seed/leech counts work. Take a chill pill, and type correctly, your comment looks like it was written by a twelve year old."
,ntguru5,2011-08-07T14:59Z,"Wow, first time I've ever heard people bitch about seeding on a Real Time torrent.  It's always well seeded and a fast download.

Thanks for the up VTV!"
,wanna-bac,2011-08-09T17:50Z,"TheChoZen1: Suggest u remove the ""Z"" from ur 'clever' letterplay & restore the ""S"" to its rightful place. The ""Z"" insults the Buddha as clearly your understanding of ""Zen"" is equal to, if not less than, your understanding of torrents.
 LadyBabe? Pls see AlfNader comment RE: reason 4 the lack of seeders. (""Alf's"" post was prob'ly not there when u were wrtg urs. IOW: 's'okay.)
 FYI: Is now sev'l days AFTER the show's airing and STILL over 1000 seeders~.
 Lastly, to ""ALL."" I am frequently disgusted by the venom & intolerance expressed on torrents' boards -- be it abt quality or seeders or... u name it. 
 If this is an inkling of the ""brave new world"" that lies ahead....
 ""We *all* create our OWN realities..."" Cho? I am SO glad NOT to be living in yours!
Suggest we ALL learn from Krass_Man_85's (not so ""crass"" advice) -- CHILL OUT, people. Get a GRIP!!!"
