When using TPB, please enagage brain before calling fake!

Nice of you to realise your mistake and apologise, but those Trusted icons are't given out like M&M's at a rave, and scene4all is a well recognised and trusted uploader.

Yes, occasionally VIP and Trusted accounts get hacked but in nearly all cases i've seen, those are accounts which have been dormant for at least 3 months, chosen most likely because any VIP or Trusted uploader still active would be discovered very quickly, well TPB community and admin/mods suss them out very quickly anyway, they don't stand a chance of getting away with fakes and should give it up but as they are Insane they keep on trying expecting different results, but from the antipiracy, account hacking oiks point of view, dormant VIP/Trusted accounts are favourite because true account holder will be unlikely to log in and discover a load of files they haven't upped in their list, scene4all is a regular and active uploader, not likely to be a hacked account, and uploads are not likely to be fakes.

If you think something is fake, click the account name hyperlink to previous uploads to see upload trending, if activity is regular then you can pretty much be assured a VIP/Trusted account is safe, if there is a long period of dormancy then a suspicious upload then it may be fake, if that is the case then by all means check it out and flag a comment and report in Suprbay or trackers 'contact us' facility for admin to check it out.

But please refrain from calling our Trusted and VIP members dodgy, they upload tons of excellent material  for the community and deserve more respect, so please engage brain Before transmitting comments flagging something as fake.

Thanks. : )"
