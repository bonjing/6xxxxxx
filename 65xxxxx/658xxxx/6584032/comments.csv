,KwyjiboLinguist,2011-08-05T11:05Z,"hmmm...if you want people to believe it's ""real"" maybe you should change your name from ""EvilCloudStrife"".

You're welcome 2"
,piruser,2011-08-05T11:44Z,"Yes, seems to be real and good quality too.

Thanks for uploading so soon after broadcast"

,zahur,2011-08-05T16:57Z,Many thanks! Unless...
,mocean,2011-08-05T18:11Z,"Definitely real, thank you!

I must say that the others are right - creepy username and specifying that 'this is real' made me quite nervous to download this."
,bryentheartist,2011-08-05T21:24Z,thanks baby
,johny-moumoute,2011-08-05T22:30Z,thank u !
,Skaterx99,2011-08-06T01:06Z,Thank you.
,Lady_Bronco,2011-08-06T09:18Z,I agree with Mocean... start over fresh with a better name.  I'm still nervous about downloading.  Where is eztv when you need them?
,EvilCloudStrife,2011-08-06T15:47Z,"sorry guys. Next time I upload Ill have a different fucking name. Maybe ""honest guy"" or ""fuck you ungrateful faggots"""

,fizdude,2011-08-15T01:04Z,Thank you very much for the quick upload E. It's very nice quality and a beautifully fast d/l. And your username is cool! Just ignore the ungratefulness. Your work is much appreciated.
