The narration seems rather rushed in places but the story is an exciting one anyway.

There may be slight echoes where the tape has picked up other parts of the track but overall it is good quality.
Enjoy!

When beautiful Nicola Ferris chose the remote island of Crete for her vacation, 

all she desired was to experience the ancient and brooding land on her own.

But one day her impulse led her on a little-used path into the foreboding 

White Mountains. And there she found a man in hiding for reasons he could not explain.


Warned to stay away, Nicola was unable to obey. And before she realized what 

she had uncovered, she found herself thrust into the midst of an alarming plot 

in which she would become the prey . . . .
