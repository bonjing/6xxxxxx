The Football League is back in business, 
and the games come thick and fast in the first Football League Show of the new season. 
Newly-promoted Brighton and Hove Albion start the Championship campaign with a 
home game against Doncaster Rovers in their brand new stadium; Steve McClaren's 
first league game in charge of Nottingham Forest is at home to Barnsley; 
while Birmingham City, who won the Carling Cup last season, acclimatise to life 
outside the Premier League with a trip to Derby. 
Presented by Manish Bhasin with analysis from Steve Claridge.
