I came across these online !

Set your favorite videos as wallpapers and screensavers . just install the software and add your videos and away you go .perfect for music videos, home movies, ect 
their are two separate installers one a video wallpaper the other a screensaver just double click and follow instructions
 

once installed you can change your screensaver via control panel in appearance and themes ! and select in the list of  your screensavers  ( Rodflashvideoss ) where it says setting press that and select the video you want to use ( You'll have to go to your videos files ) in order to select a video P.s you can select  to either have the sound on or off and to either have it full screen . 


The video wallpaper once you've installed that go to start menu and click all programs  from their find the folder ( Video Wallpaper ) where the movie symbol is send to your desktop or double click it but it's easier to have on your desktop . once you've doubled click to open video wallpaper it will sit on your system tray in the right hand corner every time you open it .just press that their are 4 buttons and volume mute click box press set and find your video from your folders and the press ok button if you want sound don't press the volume click box if you don't want sound then press it ( you'll have yo do this every time you change a video but it plays  video files in a loop time after time so you don't have to press play all the time .


the video wallpaper is one of the best wallpapers i have and have come across and it was free to download and so was the video screensaver so i thought i would share with other people ! . 


IMPORTANT :

Please Note . The video screensaver uses ( Direct X Codecs To play the videos make sure you can play videos using windows media player ) 

The Video Wallpaper work well with (  mpg format and avi )
