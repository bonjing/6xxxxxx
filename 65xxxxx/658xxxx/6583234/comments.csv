its strength lies not in whether its up to your pre-conceived ideas or not but how u tackles the subject and how it can broaden your view of the history..

i would say that its one of those rare works that records the cries and the pain of ordinary people, slaves and the underdogs that made America rich and prosperous for few people.

this book shows how the founding ""fathers"" and the leaders of the United States could be so callous as to call themselves as champions of democracy and justice while enriching themselves by inflicting so much pain and misery on the majority. 
a real eye opener.

wish we has more howard zinns"
