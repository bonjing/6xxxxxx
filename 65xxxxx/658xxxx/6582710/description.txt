                  and returns to his home - to find that he's been
                  replaced by an exact duplicate of himself, a clone.
                  When the clone's creators find out the pilot
                  didn't die in the crash, the hunt is on.

       aGGr0 was founded in 2oo2, consisting of only one member.
      Now we're a few more, spreading our love and joy throughout
       the world. At first, we mainly did svcd and mp3, but since
        november 2oo3 we're just into xvid (and a dvdr or two,
         occasionally). Our goal is to satisfy those who like
       movies, and watching them in the best quality attainable
        by xvid, with ac3 sound and vobsubs whenever possible.
       We release a variety of types of movies, both horror and
         comedies, drama and pure b-crap. All our releases are
              made from retail dvd's and we own them all.
                Remember, kids! A movie worth watching
                    a second time is worth buying!

            aGGr0 shoutouts to AQUA, ForZa, FFM and all the

              Let the light of the movie lovers guide you!
