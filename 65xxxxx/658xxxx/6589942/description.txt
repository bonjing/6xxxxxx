Personnel:
Roy Book Binder - Acoustic Guitar, Vocals

This live album captures Roy Book Binder in concert at Another Fools Cafe, Athens, Ohio in May 16, 1993. Playing a selection of standards and originals with conviction and energy. In fact, the record is frequently more compelling and exciting than his studio efforts, which tend to sound a bit too clean and studied. Here, he just plays the blues and the results are always engaging.
