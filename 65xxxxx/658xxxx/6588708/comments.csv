,stmux,2011-08-11T00:17Z,"Running 24/7 for two days and so far no problems with the program.  I did have a problem running the patcher. The window would not expand so I could see the buttons.  I think it is video related.  I turned Aero off and got it to work.

,PrettyPistol,2011-08-18T21:44Z,"are there any real instructions that i missed? What is key.txt for?    I ran the patcher, but it still said it was unlicensed TRIAL, with 30 days left. looks like some great software, but not if it expires in 30 days.... "
,wildpig1234,2011-08-19T07:35Z,"After patching, need to copy the key in the txt file and then go into serv-u, under the server detail section in the management console, click on view and configure license.  Should then be able to find the place to enter the key."
,sidneyw79,2011-09-22T09:55Z,Thank you very much. I've been running this program for over a week with no problems. This is the easiest program that I've encountered to setup a FTP server.
,Twilight99,2011-09-22T23:20Z,"For anyone having problems with the patcher. The patcher window is popping up outside of the desktop. I had to run the patcher, and then enlarge the desktop to see the window. I've been using Serv-U since 1997, and I love it. It's just way to expensive to buy for personal use."
,dreamweaver2,2012-01-24T05:07Z,I cannot locate the patcher is it suppose to be in this download! ? I installed without patching and it runs? please advise
,dreamweaver2,2012-01-24T05:12Z,Found the patcher! Norton was preventing it from extracting! Thanks very much for uploading!
,moschleff,2012-01-26T20:16Z,Get a malwarebytes warning on this for Trojan.dropper.pgen - is this a false positive?
,tbozeglav,2012-01-27T15:50Z,"TO THOSE WHO NEED HELP INSTALLING:

1) Uninstall all previous versions. Clean all directories (Program Files, Program Files (x86), AppData, etc) and Registry (look for the keyword ""Rhino""0
2) Install Serv-U from .exe
3) At end of install DO NOT start Serv-U
4) Exit Windows tray icon
5) Run patcher - should see message confirming along the lines of ""patched""
6) Open Serv-U management console - Go to license tab in ""Server Details""
7) Paste key in the .txt file

And you should now have the unlimited version of Serv-U running on your computer"
