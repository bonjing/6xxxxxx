,Heimiswil,2011-09-15T15:50Z,Installs OK and converts to MP3......but Nero didn't recognise the file so would not burn. Had to d/load another which is less fussy but does the job!

,Blaze327,2012-01-03T02:47Z,"File scanned via VirusTotal.com.  0 results, clean file, successful install, seems to work properly.  Although I am curious about the file size, as the file direct from Illustrate is on 6.7mb, not 10.4."
,Manny74,2012-02-03T23:41Z,"Excellent! I used this to update my Vs 13.2, (also downloaded from PB) Updated with no problems. Now I can add album art to the whole albums at once.  Thanks for the UL! "

,AdamantiumAngel,2012-02-25T22:14Z,"This doesn't include the WMA codec by default, is it safe to download it? Also, is it safe to use the Accurate Rip feature?"
,tehnores,2012-03-11T18:44Z,"@AdamantiumAngel:

I installed the WMA codec from the Illuminate website, installed with no trouble, and it's still registered. AccurateRip should be safe."
