,timber_w0lf,2011-08-04T17:18Z,"Congratulations mirrormaster82 on your 1000th upload. A while back you were most probably the only good comic uploader on TPB, now there are are a few other good ones around. But, frankly speaking... you are still the MASTER :)!!! I live in Pakistan, the only access to comics we have here are second hand, dog-eared and usually from the 80s :P. You are the only way i can keep up with all the latest comics. So keep uploading, i'll be waiting for your 2000th upload... Thanks for everything dude, I speak for all of us here when i say your work is greatly apprecaited!!! :D"
