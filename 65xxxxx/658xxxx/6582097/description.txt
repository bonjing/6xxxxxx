FOR MY 1000-TH TORRENT,I WANTED SOMETHING SPECIAL-DON'T KNOW IF MANY OF YOU KNEW

ABOUT THIS COMIC,BUT HERE IT IS,ENJOY.

SCARFACE - DEVIL IN DISGUISE 1-4

The definitive prequel to the 1983 cult-classic film! Before Tony Montana came to 

America, he cut his teeth as a young military assassin in Cuba, and rose up as a 

hustler in Havana. He knows the world is his, and he craves the American dream. 
 
But first, he's gotta get out from Castro-imposed solitary confinement. Add to this
 
Molotov cocktail mix the CIA, La Cosa Nostra, and the scumbag who gave Montana his 

infamous scar. Make a deal with the devil...just know which devil you're dealing 

with first.
