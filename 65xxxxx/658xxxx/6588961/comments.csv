I am a Wonder Woman fan and have read pretty much all her book from the 80's till now. I understand what David E Kelley the script writer was trying to do. 

This was a bold attempt and the show was never ment to be judged on one pilot episode. kelley allowed for things to be played out over the season.... I am very sad this was not picked up."
,lessandoh,2012-05-16T17:50Z,"This is NOT a remake of the 1970's Lynda Carter show. 

This is more a comicbook adaption then anything else. 

 This is a TV pilot not a MOVIE so you are not going to get all the answers about Wonder Womans motives and personality in this one episode. 

If you don't follow Wonder Woman comics and ONLY know Wonder Woman because of lynda Carter then you will not at FIRST be able to relate to this character as Wonder Woman. 

To bad it got canceled because it could have been the BOMB "
