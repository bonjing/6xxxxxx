,RubberbandBoy,2011-08-04T17:58Z,"Good morning everyone. This is Jonathan, the author of Rubberband Boy. I got a frantic call yesterday morning from my friend Emily who said that my book was being shared on a site called Demonoid. She wanted me to contact the site and threaten legal action. I laughed at her and said that the more people that enjoy the book the better. I asked her to keep an eye out for it being shared on other sites, and I just got another call from her. I don't understand a lot about torrents or these websites, so she helped me set up an account so that I could talk to you.

As somebody who grew up in a household living paycheck to paycheck (and still living paycheck to paycheck), I understand that not everybody has extra money to spend. I didn't start writing to make money; I did it to make people laugh and feel good. After 4 years and around 50 rejections trying to get the book published with a traditional publisher, I just decided to upload the book myself to Amazon and Smashwords.

For those of you who can't afford to buy the book, please enjoy and recommend it to your friends and family and ask them to get it for themselves. I hope that it brings you as much joy and laughter reading it as it did me when writing it. I would ask one favor, however. Please take a couple of minutes to give the book a high rating and good review (the reviews don't have to be long if you don't have the time, just something short and sweet) so that the book will move up in the rankings at its respective websites and will have traffic directed to it. The book is up at two locations:
http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/77793
http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004YDKQ12

Also, if you are ever in a forum or website where you can recommend it, that would be great. Maybe the book can generate enough buzz and be picked up by some hollywood company and be made into a movie. I can always dream 

If you're the same person, Nukemaway, as I mentioned yesterday on the other site, thank you for purchasing the book and for your kind words. I'm thrilled that you children couldn't stop laughing. That's what makes all the time and money put into the book worth it. For those of you who can afford to buy the book, it is only $2.99 and is available at those above addresses. I would recommend getting the Smashwords one, because it gives it to you in multiple formats including for Kindle, however the Amazon one was specifically made for and checked for Kindle compatibility, so it has a few extra Kindle features.

If I can get enough sales to justify paying for another cover to be made, the second book is almost in final form and just needs one or two more revisions, so I will ask Emily to help me post back here if and when the second one is available.

Also, apparently I'm being told that there are other torrent websites, so if you put the book on another one, or if you see it there, would you mind copying this message there? I would appreciate it.

Again, for all of you who have gotten the book, and for all of you who will, please enjoy it over and over! I hope that my book helps to brighten your day and those of your kids!
