Mixed in two different directions, CD one Ã¦Space ClassicsÃ† draws 
from the last ten years of amazing parties, celebrating the 
diversity, revolutionary line- ups and production that is integral 
to CarlÃ†s night at Space. Part two Ã¦Future ClassicsÃ† is all about 
the nurturing and growth of new artists. Quality and innovation 
have always been a massively important part of The Revolutions 
ethos and it is reflected in this stellar mix. 

In CarlÃ†s words: Ã´Enjoy this CD, please enjoy this season, it 
really will be the best we can bring you with ten years of 
experience and a big thank you to you! As you are really what 
makes it all possibleÃ¶
