If you downloaded GTA San Andreas and you deleted the trainer.exe file, the radio stations and cutscenes voices will not worck so those are the SFX and STREAM files to fix it.
Just extract all sfx file in the sfx folder and the stream files in the stream foalder of GTA San Andreas but delete the old files.
