What's Inside:
Disc 1: Chest, Quads, Back, Shoulders, Biceps
Disc 2: Triceps, Hamstrings, Calves, Abs
Disc 3: Nutrition, Outtakes
First and foremost let me start of by saying that this video is a must for anyone involved in bodybuilding and fitness. Whether you are a beginner, intermediate or advanced everyone will benefit greatly after watching the video. I think this is probably the first video which dwells deep into technique, form, angles and explaining the logic behind each and every exercise; why it's done, how it is beneficial and how we can perform it for unleashing the best gains.
Milos explains all his concepts in laymans language. The DVD makes u think to re-evaluate your training where u lack. It also gives u a rush - a sudden urge to pack your bags and hit the gym.
The "outtakes" section is very funny and the "slideshow" of kolessium gym is simply breathtaking. A great dvd and every penny worth it. Absolutely must have.
