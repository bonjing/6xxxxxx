There's another copy available from Repeaters.2011.DVDRip.XviD-playXD but I have downloaded this copy from two other sites and both copies could be played after 2 minutes, it would just stop in it's tracks no matter what app I used to play it. So big thanks to Horrorspoke for this great working copy. Haven't seen the movie yet, just tried it to make sure it would work. A/V quality is great from the preview I conducted."
,Montel-,2011-08-18T03:44Z,"I have found the same problem.  This is also the only  one that works for me.  The other two I tried get distorted, freeze and my player intermit shows NOT GMC COMPATIBLE.  I've never found this problem with hundreds of movies.  "
