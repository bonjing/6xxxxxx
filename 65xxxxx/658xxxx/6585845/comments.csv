V: 5

At this quality, the file should be no larger than 200 MB.  Please read up on x264, which can encode a full-length movie @ 720p in under 700 MB."
,AriGold45,2011-09-09T11:28Z,"x264 won't play on either of my computers, and when it does, it looks pixelated and crappy, runs slow, or just plain skips.  It's not for everyone."
,mclean007,2011-09-24T20:49Z,"@AirGold45 - unless your computer is from the 90s (in which case, get a new one!) , it should be able to play x264 without problems.  We shouldn't have to deal with crappy xvid rips just because you can't be bothered to learn how to play newer/better codecs.  Check out VLC and educate yourself."
,Stanvdmeer,2011-09-29T22:52Z,it's pritty crappy quality when i run it in vlc here too. how can i improve the quality using codecs when i want to burn this onto a dvd?
