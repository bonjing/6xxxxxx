This is a slightly modified version of the WPA wordlists provided by wifi-foo-er but with duplicates removed and a few secure passwords added. This is the wordlist i used to create the huge rainbowtables, should you feel the need to create your own then this is a good foundation.

Will be creating a huge wordlist full of secure passwords shortly.
