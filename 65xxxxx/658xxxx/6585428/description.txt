This is the remastered and restored mix of the original Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds "Henry's Dream" album. Tracks have been ripped from the limited edition DVD and converted to .WAV 24bit audio files. Do whatever you want with them... This is how this album was apparently suppossed to sound at the time of its release. After almost twenty years later we can hear it in its original form and I'd say it is very good.
