[T],The_Day_Walker,2011-08-05T02:46Z,"oops, my bad i mispelled your name baby, sorry, i love you Chelby! also, tomorrow i'm gonna go look at a car, hopefully it's the one, i have a good feeling about it, it needs a new radiator and possibly a new head gasket, it also needs the air lines for the air ride redone, but the pros out weigh the cons by a lot, it's $2,500. It has a body kit, spoiler, custom paint job, aftermarket headlights and tailights, aftermarket exhaust, short ram intake, a sounds system, airbags (air suspension), it's a convertible, it has shaved doors with door poppers but it needs a new clicker for that. It also comes with another engine and extra dash. Also, it only has 95,000 miles on it.

I really hope it's the one for me cuz i love it and it's for a good price with a lot of extras, i'm taking my mechanic friend to look at it tomorrow, he and i would do the work that it needs."
