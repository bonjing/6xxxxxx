,micmac33,2011-08-05T00:35Z,"Thanks a lot, great quality.
But the aspect ratio is wrong, it should be 2.35:1"
[V],GoodFilms,2011-08-05T03:14Z,"rookie error, anoXmous. the aspect ratio is indeed VERY WRONG. you have it at 1.78:1 when is should be 2.35:1.

The picture is horribly stretched as a result. This is useless"
[V],GoodFilms,2011-08-05T12:27Z,You're a liar.
[V],Zen_Bud,2011-08-06T03:42Z,"This ripp is playing very WELL, on mine Benq 24 inch 16:9 monitor :)

I use MPC, on the computer :)

So THX anoXmous for this small quality ripp :)

This was not my intent.
Regarding to the aspect ratio, if you look up IMDB, it actually says 2.35:1
And personally, watching the movie with this aspect ratio seems more fit to me, rather than 16/9.
Right or wrong, I still thinks the quality is great and thanks again for your upload."
,gorgang,2011-08-06T17:56Z,"Unfortunately, anoXmous in his zeal to upload a great film, made a rookie mistake with the aspect ratio setting, which should be 2.35:1. I put it at 16:9 and the film is squeezed left and right. I put it at 2.35:1 and the film looks normal (which is quite wide), just like it did in the theater when I saw it. Can the eye lie? Can the film's own production stats lie? Please reign in the ego and re-release a corrected copy. Everyone appreciates the effort you are making to put this wonder out there."
,anoXmous,2011-08-06T23:56Z,"@Admin toba

Att du tog ställning på en sida och tog bort min självklara rätt att försvara mej gör dej till en IDIOT!

Jag har bemött en IDIOT som attackerar inte bara mej utan många andra här men att du blundar för detta faktum, är fan bedrövligt!

Ni behöver torrent jag behöver inte er så dra åt helvete........................."
,gorgang,2011-08-07T13:07Z,"anoXmous not only screams vile thoughts in Swedish only (although he understands English perfectly well), but edits out his own nasty previous comments. What a lack of character and class."
,anoXmous,2011-08-07T16:32Z,"@gorgang Dina diskussioner passar inte här ta dem på forumet där de hör hemma!

Och lägg upp lite torrent själ, istället för att komma med korkade kommentarer!"
,Lovejam,2011-09-02T02:36Z,Thank you much.
