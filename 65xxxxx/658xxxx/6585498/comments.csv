,scottsasse,2011-08-07T00:31Z,"@ tejar9, Find your own damn solution to your subtitle problem you lazy bastard or better yet learn English or maybe wait until it is released for retail!! Uploaders are not responsible for providing you with subs unless you see the word ""subs"" in the torrent description. If you have a problem with SaM's torrents then don't download them. There are 5,089,311 registered users on this website so if your not happy here then download from another uploader. As for me I have downloaded many of torrents form SaM and always found them to be perfect. I only wish more uploaders were as responsible when labeling their torrents!! "
,Archonin,2011-08-07T01:37Z,It takes you a minute to sync your subtitles yourself -.-

,wizzkid1970,2011-08-10T23:13Z,this idiot sam dont understand english cause if he could then he know everyone been telling him on previous torrents of his to stop fucking using imageshack to show screens when they banned this domain stupid fooker
[V],SaM,2011-08-11T04:06Z,wizzkid1970  i do understand english and speak another 4 languages (with manners)..if the note at the bottom of my torrent info doesn't help..u can simply download a sample which is always included in my encodes..or find the screen shots from any other site that doesnt block it..or simply sign up to imageshack..

,pirate_guy8,2011-08-14T20:07Z,solution for the subtitles: use VLC player and then use H and J keys to move the subtitles.
,redactedwv,2011-08-15T23:08Z,"Some particularly stupid complaints in these comments. 

-----------

Thanks for the up, SaM - Sincerely appreciated. 

Thx also to all seeders and leechers. Will seed."
,empm9,2011-08-20T08:57Z,watermarks but pretty watchable aesome thanx SaM
,PsB21,2011-08-23T23:13Z,seed
,redactedwv,2011-08-29T06:15Z,"@wizzkid1970: Do you have some sort of obsession? You constantly vandalize SaM's listings with your banal complaints and laughable attempts to condescend. 

If the images don't appear for you, open it in a new tab and c/p the link directly into the address field. Reload the page & ... presto chango, you sniveling half-wit. 

It would seem a more productive use of your time than constantly whinging about the fact that, iyo, the person providing free shit for the world isn't making it easy enough for YOU.

FFS.

""He don't understand English""

Priceless.

Go find some other comment section in which to spew your endless bile, you ridiculous fucktard.

Thanks to SaM and all seeders and leechers - Sincerely appreciated. "
,QuickRidez,2011-08-29T06:29Z,"Slightly grainy with watermarks, but excellent besides! Definitely recommend!"
,RotorDJ,2011-09-07T19:10Z,"@scottsasse:

Please look back upon your comment and detect your frustration and ignorance. Have you no better things to do other than to write this agressiveness? I'd rather use the time to see someone who can help you with your anger problem if I were you. It's just subtitles you're talking about... :s

Let peace be on you, dude!"
,wizzkid1970,2011-09-11T10:55Z,"at redactedwv you obviosly are not anywhere near a quality kind of guy or you wouldnt say that .. one thing to post images that dont work once but all the torrents he does it and his team also...there are loads of decent image hosters on the net why are these lazy fuckers just using a site that bans thepiratebay ones ?

is plain crazy it not just me who says this read his other torrents comments"
,walsh9239,2011-11-03T02:42Z,another good torrent thanks SaM and seriously people no need for that kind of language especially on SaM's torrent page and if the guy cant read or speak english what is the point in replying lol
