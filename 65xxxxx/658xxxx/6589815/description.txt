Converted from the dvd9 Criterion Collection edition which also
yielded two brief clips of interviews with the two main actors of 
the movie which are included here for your edification equally.

870MB version - also available 1.59GB version posted separately

720 X 480 at 881k video bitrate, 192k audio for those fans of this
stuff that have made clear they want to fully get the goods on this movie.
For the better video version avail yourselves of our 1.59GB version instead,
I suggest - as it offers 1800k video bitrate quality at 224k audio too

SRT subtitles in English (template which may be used to instantl;y translate
to any other kanguage using the freely available donation supported "Subtitles
Editor" utility from Denmark's nikse.dk along with the free "Google translate"
website facility or what have you), along with French Spanish and Portuguese.


"My Dinner with Andre - 1981" is a movie that strives for profundity while
instead bordering at all times on the inane. A complete lack of connection 
to what are real human ideas of relating and sharing in beauty that comes from
a fullness of true human emotions free of retarding instincts and insane drives
to make thngs somehow weird and strange and alien which gives meaning to those
that lack this basis for their own idea of genius.

It is quite true that "speaking in a feign" or to cause somehow having to
constantly read between the lines suggests an arrogance towards the audience in
this sort of mindset which doesnt wish to or want to revaeal its own agenda for
what makes its own existentialism - which is generally intolerable by comparison
I submit, if it is to be "brought out into the open" - suffice it to say
That "to throw a teddy bear into the air" in order to astound the 140 people
watching may seem like the thrill of a lifetime to a small mind, however
there is a lack of credibility established on the part of the advocates
of such a lifestyle of "constantly venting" inane psychosis - to those that
must now decide if the experiment has run its course and needs to be declared
a dismal failure in what is human history for better notions that are more
than just equal to the sensibly inane.
