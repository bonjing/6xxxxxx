As for the Greater Journey I know you're trying and that sooner or later it might come. 

Regardless, GREAT JOB"

how about necessary secrets by Gabriel Schoenfeld? this is a pretty good book. think you could get it?"
,senseinai,2011-08-07T19:36Z,"Don't know how you are managing to get these ... but many thanks for your efforts & sharing. 
If you get a chance, one of the best non-fiction books right now is Railroaded ... the kindle price is $18, which is a rip-off."
