DESCRIPTION:

As a member of the strange secret society E.Y.E, you wake up after a
fight in which your fellow teammates were killed. E.Y.E, an armed branch
of the Secreta Secretorum is attempting a coup against the all-powerful
Federation, a coalition of several worlds and planets that rule with an
iron fist.

To complicate matters, E.Y.E itself is plagued with its own internal
conflicts between the Jian faction and the Culter faction, to which
you belong. Your loyalties are torn between Commander Rimanah, your
superior and the chief of the Secreta who is a separatist with an
unstoppable ambition, and the "Mentor" your friend and instructor.
The "Mentor" tries at all costs to unite the two rival factions.
In doing so, you are thrust into the middle of a fratricidal war
frought with political conspiracies and quests for power in which
ifferent groups and megacorporations are implicated.

These troubles set the stage for an attack by an unknown force bent
on destroying humankind.
