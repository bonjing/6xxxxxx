Rebel Soul Collective are dance/indie alchemists evolving out of 90s chemical rave. We take sample material, dancefloor-lifted electronic noises and combine with vocals, guitar and drums. With elements such as angular guitars, uptempo drums and dark energy of Bloc Party, Editors and Wire, along with synth sounds and euphoria from 80s and 90s house music such as K-Klass, 808 State and Utah Saints and intense vocals in the style of Kasabian or Kings Of Leon delivered by a singer operating on the edge of sanity

"Their unique mix of funk, soul, indie, jazz madness is caked in euphoric energy and had the basement jumping from the word go. Their refracting guitar tones accompanied with cowbells and trumpets created a chaotic cloud of refreshing dance your ass off music." - Natalie Saville's review of Hockley Hustle for the Nottingham Evening Post
