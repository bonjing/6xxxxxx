REL.NOTES



The title track of Trace Adkins' tenth studio album, Proud to Be Here, has its
roots in autobiography. Written by Chris Wallin, Aaron Barker, and Ira Dean, the
song was offered up by the songwriters to reflect the gratitude Adkins
experienced when his entire family was spared a fire that claimed his house.
With the exception of "Just Fishin'," produced by Michael Knox, the contemporary
honky tonk album was helmed by Kenny Beard and Mark Wright. There are ten new
songs on the standard edition, and 14 on the deluxe version, which contains a
duet with ubiquitous pal Blake Shelton on "If I Was a Woman" and the anthemic
"Semper Fi."
