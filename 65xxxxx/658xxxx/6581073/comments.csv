A pity as this forces viewer to attach remote to hand to constantly turn volume up & down over & over.
A fine effort, but if a standard dvd rip is to be your final copy then i'd search / wait for 1 with a better audio source.

Anyways, that's just my opinion;  film was ok but could've been way better. Gee, aren't u glad u didn't pay for it?... :)
