About The Book
A brilliant memoir of journalism, cricket and conversations...

Pretending to be Humphrey Bogart, Michael Parkinson became a familiar sight around Barnsley, riding his bike while wearing a military style raincoat snap-brimmed trilby with elastic chinstrap and green cycle clips. Thus disguised he bluffed his way onto the Manchester Guardian and later the Daily Express before ending up at the BBC with a talk show which ran for many years. With the help of his wife Mary, he has overcome many problems, including drink, Meg Ryan and an irrational fear of emus, to lead a charmed life in which he has had his kneecap touched by such glamourous ladies as Kylie Minogue and Dame Edna Everage.
