Description:

 The debut EP of the new side project from Deftones front man Chino Moreno and Far 
Guitarist Shaun Lopez. Released on August 2,2011 Moreno Describes it as "Really 
minimal and soothing. Itâ€™s sort of like the stuff I like listening to when Iâ€™m not screaming my head off.â€ 
 
 This stuff is kind of similar to Team Sleep at first glance, Yet very different in many ways. It's pretty percussion heavy with a lot of spacey, dark guitar riffs. It has a lot of electronic samples,sounds and textures that create a dreamy atmosphere that compliments Chino's trademark crooning vocals and lyrics. If you're into Chino's and Shaun's other bands then I'm sure you will dig this. I've included The front and back cover art, as well as another piece of band artwork that I found online,also couple of photographs.

Note: The Quality is 320kbps But the mix is minimal and rough I read in an interview that they've done this intentionally.


Seed that shit.
