This is the Formula 1, 2003 Season. It has all the full races. Unfortunately there are advert breaks. There is no qualifying either.

Commentary: Martin Brundle & James Allen (ITV Commentators (English))

The pre-race show is included in most races. It's some Australians that don't input anything but they at least recap Saturday's qualifying

Oh and sometimes they take over commentary for a few minutes whilst the ITV guys are on break. Again they don't say anything except repeating the ITV commentators as if it were their own opinions.

Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka has no pre-race show which is annoying since it's the finale of the season and it's rather anticlimactic.

But apart from that, I hope you enjoy...
