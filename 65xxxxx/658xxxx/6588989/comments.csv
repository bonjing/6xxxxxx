[T],ILPruny,2011-08-07T18:42Z,"Is made by RiddlerA, see the link above"
,Johngoundry86,2011-09-08T05:20Z,What software did you use to convert/encode this?
,reject3d,2011-10-04T20:17Z,"Has anyone tested any subtitles with this torrent?
Maybe you can point to a link?"
,DrLex,2011-11-27T22:50Z,"Image is good, audio is bad. The too low bitrate is forgivable for a small rip like this, but the fact that the audio has been messed with is not. It has obviously been amplified, to the degree that it is distorted during all action scenes. Turning down the volume does not help, open the file in Audacity and you'll see the clipping sound waves. I hope this was an error in your software and was not done intentionally."
,Virginator,2011-11-28T00:30Z,A10/V10 Thanks for the upload.
,Chackravanti,2011-12-16T03:11Z,"Static images while sounds go on. If I move forward, the image catches up, but freezes, sound still works. Any ideas?"
,stuffmanca,2012-04-20T23:30Z,"Downloaded fine. Every time i click the folder with the files Explorer crashes. Tried opening file from Windows Media Player and DivX player, loads but does not play."
,FRivera,2012-06-06T17:26Z,v10 a10 plays like a charm on vlc. thanks ILPRuny!
