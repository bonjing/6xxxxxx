i.e. All 720p releases are always 1.09GB in size, but the whole of this series is all over the place with file size, so are the likes of Rescue me 720p, etc.

Maybe the DD5.1 is adding to the file size, so what not just run AC3 or AAC instead - run @ L4.1 and we can go back to 1.09GB ??

Thanks again for the 'up' bongboy - just wondering why the filesize is bigger that's all."
,bongboy,2011-08-07T01:16Z,"There are a couple different factors. For one, the scene, who normally cap and release episodes which you will find on most torrent sites, for example EZTV, have started using CRF (constant rate factor), which means that the size of the x264 encodes they release depends on how much video bitrate is needed in order to make the episode look good. Since they changed over to this method about two months ago, I've seen 720p HDTV rips which range in size from 888 MB - 2.5 GB for a 42 minute live-action show.

Separately from that, the scene has completely ignored the current season of Damages because it airs exclusively on DirecTV's Audience Network. I don't know why they seem to have a problem with capping these episodes, but luckily, P2P groups have been releasing the episodes on their own.

The group who encoded this webrip left in the Dolby Digital 5.1, and the file size seems to be mainly dependent upon the length of the episode, although I believe they are also using CRF."
