The third album from angst-ridden guitar duo Ezio, Higher is another intelligent and perceptive take on the familiar themes of life and love--there is always something in their lyrics that will strike a chord. However, fans who have become familiar with Ezio's soaring acoustic sound may be disappointed. The guitars are still there, but--in an attempt to capture a "live" feel--they are joined by their touring band, and the results simply don't have the energy or intensity of previous albums. That said, "Oranges" and "Perfect" are fine examples of the band's quirkiness, and "Meet Me in the Gods" is a poignant and haunting prayer to past love. Overall, though, Higher is not as uplifting, powerful and evocative as Black Boots on Latin Feet, which showcases the band at their dynamic best.
