,chisue1,2011-08-10T16:58Z,"thank you sir for sharing this beauty . i used to install and try dozens of ghost xp on my notebook or pc or my friends pcs and to be frank with everyone here this is the best of them all and i will not switch to any other xp 
you have done a great job thank you again
last thing to mention is that the serial of xp is not genuine and changing it is a must 
overall my rating is 10 and exellent job "
