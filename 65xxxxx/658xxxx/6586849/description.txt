193 days have passed since Alice was seen for the last time. Every day MÃ¡rio, her father, leaves home to repeat exactly the same steps he took on the day Alice disappeared. Obsessed with tracking her down he installs several video cameras to record the movement on the streets. In the middle of all those faces, of that anonymous crowd, MÃ¡rio seeks a clue, a trace, a signâ€¦
The shattering grief caused by Alice's absence turned MÃ¡rio into a different person but this wilful and tragic quest is perhaps the only way he has to believe that one day Alice will reappear.
