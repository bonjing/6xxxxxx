Once upon a time, I was in your shoes. Yes, I know how difficult it is to get started with Cisco studies. But stick to it and I promise, the challenges will pay off handsomely. The CCNA is Cisco's entry level certification exam, but it is not easy. And since the CCNA covers a wide array of topics, I have designed this course to help you tackle those diverse challenges. The key to exam and job success is in the details. And most of those details are hard won from real world experience. Everything I am going to teach you, I wish someone would have taught me when I first started studying for my CCNA. At least you can benefit from my hard won experience and hopefully not repeat the same mistakes.

As with all Train Signal courses, I break down the theory and "real world" application of Cisco Networking. This exciting course contains nearly 29 hours of video instruction where I break down networking theory as you work hands on with real Cisco routers & switches... and build your own working network!
