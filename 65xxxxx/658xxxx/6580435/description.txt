Despite that Vista has been a relative flop,this os with latest SP2 stay reliable,acceptable
and is stable enough anyway.
Less good than Win7 indeed and slower but stay a good os for several reasons
This version is the most advanced build and is dated from : 2009/4/11
Business version is equivalent to Enterprise edition and will still be
as VL edition.
If you like this torrent,Seed a bit with me to the others,please !
don't forget to regulary check your tracker's list also.
As usual use a suffisant up speed to download this torrent.
Japanese and Chinese peers,please,use old version of utorrent and others
for better compatibility !
for several good reasons i should switch to VPN connection asap in few days to come.
This should not affect to much my torrents and host anyway.

our knowledge and much more again.
