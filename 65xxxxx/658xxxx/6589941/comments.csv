,Sanicle,2011-08-20T11:51Z,"This is based on my viewing of the sample, I'll correct this if the full file isn't up to par (though at present I have no reason to suspect this)

A: A perfect 10/10. 6 channels of AC-3 goodness: front left, center, right - Side left, right and LFE (low frequency effects). No sync issues either.

V: 9/10. Very slightly noticeable artifacting can give a not quite crisp look to some objects, though that could easily be the source material. I've seen worse video on original blu-rays simply down to the original cameras not dealing with variable lighting as well as standard film cameras could."
