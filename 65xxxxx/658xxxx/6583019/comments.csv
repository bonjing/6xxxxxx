There is always 1 person who has to assume ""its a virus"" I can assure you this is not a virus and it is working perfectly, Will seed on my end."
,Raven_11,2011-08-04T23:07Z,"The main thing is to have Nvidia Physx on your comp.  You can get the file from the Nvidia site.  I bought the game, but had the Physx installed from another game.  No crashes at all.  

There is also a program you can get to test your system to see if Physx is running properly on your comp.  Here is the link.  http://www.geeks3d.com/20101126/gpu-tool-fluidmark-1-3-0-gpu-physx-fluids-with-more-than-700k-sph-particles/  Have fun!  :)"
,Raven_11,2011-08-04T23:16Z,"If you downloaded this patch, seed it for a while.  Don't be a sponge!  This patch is very hard to find in the 1st place, and it isn't even working on the games official site."
,Raven_11,2011-08-04T23:50Z,"Wow, check out the leechers on this one lol"
,Ultrakonkret,2011-08-05T00:22Z,"i´m seeding around the clock, but have only low uploadrate...sorry...
so please seeeeeeeeed guys, that anyone who´s in need for this can get it...thanks !!!"
,British89,2011-08-05T00:31Z,"Seeders 3
Leechers 75

Come on guys you taking the piss? It seems like i got 75 people or more leeching from my seed...

I'm uploading at 50 MB's
spread that over 75 leechers apparently is 20 KB's - 100 KB's each person, You guys must be downloading this at a very slow pace... Now everyone stop being such losers and seed this for others, It isnt hard ""Unless you are on dial-up"""
,British89,2011-08-05T00:36Z,"There is 1 guy from Germany who has 100% of the files you guys need yet i have not seen it upload 1 piece of file, Its people like that who are killing the whole point in torrents"
,Raven_11,2011-08-05T02:04Z,"I will seed this for a whole night. But I gotta get it dl'd lol  At the rate it is going with everyone leeching, I am fluctuating between .9/kbs  34/kbs.  "
,Raven_11,2011-08-05T02:11Z,64% @ 64/kbs WOOT!  This guy from the Netherlands and I are neck and neck lol
,Ultrakonkret,2011-08-05T02:28Z,"@british89
ähm, maybe im that guy from germany, and i´ve uploaded the file, but if i dont seed a thing how have u completed the download???"
,billybob007,2011-08-05T02:32Z,"Cheers for the UL...
Now dip shits stop cutting and running and seed this shit.....Not 1 person with a full copy is seeding...
Only %70 available at the mo"
,Ultrakonkret,2011-08-05T02:57Z,"@billybob007

strange, im seeding all the time, and i´ve uploaded 1,3 GB from what utorrent shows me, maybe theres something wrong..."
,British89,2011-08-05T03:04Z,"@Ultrakonkret

I see 3 people from germany, 2 are 100% 1 is 75% only 1 of the germany is seeding the other is doing nothing, The reason i am already 100% is because i have fiber optic internet, 1TB ftw but my upload is only limited to 50MB's upload, spread that over 149 leachers? not good for the people wanting the file :/"
,ThomasDollar,2011-08-05T08:26Z,thank you so much for this!
,klord2010,2011-08-05T10:55Z,"+1
Thanks!"
,mattatude,2011-08-06T06:32Z,Hi. I downloaded POBC skidrow. I wanna download the patch. But I downloaded patch automatically from game promp and it dont work. Will this patch work with my skidrow copy.??? 
,klord2010,2011-08-06T06:37Z,Still crash. Hmmmm...
,mattatude,2011-08-06T07:08Z,Yeah I cant get into game half the time. hmmm 
,Ultrakonkret,2011-08-06T07:41Z,"@mattatude 
yes, i use skidrow version too, and the patch is working with it fine...
the crashes are there with or without the patch, maybe the next one will fix that..."
,mattatude,2011-08-06T09:45Z,Everytime I load my save it crashes on the load screen. Does this happen to anyone else?? any Ideas?? help/. I have re-intalled twice and it still happens? 
,smythtec,2011-08-06T16:40Z,Game still crashes about every 15mins for me. Hopefully new 1.02 patch today will fix this. This game must be really buggy if they are releasing some many patches this close to the game release date. Makes you wonder what the devs actually did.
