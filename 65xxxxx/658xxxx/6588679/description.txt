Converted from the Criterion Collection Special edition which provided 
(in this case) better dvd9 source content resolution, and extras which
yielded two brief clips of interviews with the two main actors of the movie
which are included here for your edification equally.

720 X 480 at nice 1800k video bitrate, 224k audio for those fans of this
stuff that have made clear they want to fully get the goods on this movie.

SRT subtitles in English (template which may be used to instantl;y translate
to any other kanguage using the freely available donation supported "Subtitles
Editor" utility from Denmark's nikse.dk along with the free "Google translate"
website facility or what have you), along with French Spanish and Portuguese.


"My Dinner with Andre" is a movie that strives for profundity while instead 
bordering at all times on the inane. A complete lack of connection to what
are real human ideas of relating and sharing in beauty that comes form a
fullness of the emotions free of retarding instincts and insane drives to
make thngs somehow weird and strange and alien which gives meaning to those
that lack this basis for their own idea of genius.

It is true that "speaking in a feign" or somehow having to constantly read
between the lines suggests an arrogance towards the audience in thet a mindset that wont revaeal its own agenda for what makes its own existentialism seem
intolerable by comparison if "brought out into the open", suffice it to say
That "to throw a teddy bear into the air" in order to astound the 140 people
watching may seem like the thrill of a lifetime to a small mind, however
there is a lack of credibility established on the part of the advocates
of such a lifestyle of "constantly venting" inane psychosis - to those that
must now decide if the experiment has run its course and needs to be declared
a dismal failure in what is human history for better notions that are more
than just equal to the sensibly inane.
