,ironymon,2011-12-06T20:29Z,"Video audio size 10... now these are tv rips that means there are no violent scenes like abruzzi getting his throat cut by t-bag, now watching this i noticed that that scene were missing so how r people supposed to know why abruzzi wants t-bag dead and worse, his insurance ""expired"". I'll watch this season fine, but i want the rest uncut. Thanks for this great work anyway."
,ironymon,2011-12-06T21:07Z,"I don't know if im saying this too soon but, my mistake, i think abruzzi will get his neck slit i just didn't get to it yet... assuming they did not cut that part out and i hope not. thanks."

,kemcolian822,2012-04-22T07:54Z,"Just finished watching season 1 (in just 1.5 days) episode after episode (each of ~43 minutes)...

It was like orgasm after orgasm of AWESOME thrill of this series :)

Definitely one of the BEST thrillers ever !!!

P.S. Good quality torrent, not HD but still worth it. Download its subtitles from TVSubtitles.com"
