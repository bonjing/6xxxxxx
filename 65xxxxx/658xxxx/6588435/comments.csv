,Ipmark,2011-08-09T12:40Z,"Official Nuvi 1300's firmware doesn't support Lane Assistant and 3D Buildings.
If you want to enable this features on your model, you have to flash it with a ""custom"" firmware.

Search the web for ""ENABLE HIDDEN FEATURES IN YOUR NĂVI 12XX, 13XX AND 14XX"".

BE CAREFUL!
Read with attention the instructions of flashing operation."
,Maty360414,2011-08-13T19:03Z,works with  nuvi 765t?
,Ipmark,2011-08-14T09:35Z,"3D Buildings works on 765
For the 7x5 series Garmin has released a specific JCV file, search it on the web for D3060030A.jcv"
,mambrake,2011-08-27T17:38Z,Would it work on my nuvi 1390? and are all the files unlocked or just the 3D Buildings? Am i Suppoes to just replace the files and thats it? What folder do they go in?
,Ipmark,2011-08-28T15:12Z,"Your 1390 doesn't support 3d Buildings.
Junction view is supported."
,mambrake,2011-08-28T19:53Z,No disrespect (ipmark) but for some reason the 3D part came up on my map info. it said City Navigator North America NT 2012.20 3d.  Also there is a button on the map section that say 3D view. I am just a confused follower. I have no idea whats going on. How do i add the .JVC? do i just put it on the micro SD?
,Ipmark,2011-08-30T10:24Z,"Reading the features of the nuvi 1390 on the website garmin, 3d buildings would appear that the function is not supported.
But if you can see the 3d map in ""map info"" means that it works.
JCV file must be placed in the \JCV SD's folder."
,Olegken,2011-09-10T18:19Z,Can somebody share image file of the map?
,Mustafa_NYC,2012-05-20T12:45Z,"Ipmark, even after flashing the firmware successfully, and placing these files inside the device, I did not see the buildings in 3D when I was driving in Manhattan. I have nuvi 1300T.
 Software version is 5.90. I really wanted to see the buildings in 3D. Lane assist appears on uppers left and speed limit appears on lower right. I am not sure if flashing the firmware brought those are not. 
Thanks again! You da man!"
