Madman Sam is somewhat of a throwback. His musical style and approach quickly brings to mind the artists of the Delta from back in the 20s and 30s. Armed with just his National guitar, a booming voice, stomping feet, tambourine and a little kazoo every now and then, the music is hypnotic and intense. He hits those strings with a fierce passion, a little remindful of Son House. That is if Son House, a man torn between his religious beliefs and the blues, were to use a bit more coarse language. Not that the themes between what House played and what Madman Sam does now are much different. Itâ€™s just times have changed in the last 70 years and folks are not quite as shocked to hear such verbiage nowadays. But that is few and far between on the disc, and should not prevent you from exploring this crafty and exciting musician.

Madman Sam knows the blues within his heart. This disc is all original material. Itâ€™s filled with songs about unfortunate luck with women that leads to bail-jumping, suicidal intentions or thoughts of murder, naked men jumping out the back window while he catches his partner with her panties down, which leads to the belief that there is nothing better to start the morning out with than a strong drink of whiskey. Thereâ€™s a lot of anger, in fact heâ€™s mad as hell. Donâ€™t argue with him, just fetch him his pistol and lay some plastic down on the floor. His tribulations have made him so evil that even the devil wants to sell his own soul to Sam. But who knows, maybe his tenth wife will be the one that works out.

The songs may sound foreboding, but theyâ€™re delivered quite tongue-in-cheek, backed by sensationally serious guitar playing. This is Samâ€™s first release since 1998 and the first since moving to his new home of Portland, Oregon. It may sound like a throwback to the Delta of old, but Madman Sam is an authentic bluesman for the 21st Century. Seek this one out!!
