This is the full instrumental score to David Fincher's film 'Seven' (1995). Music by HOWARD SHORE. 25 TRACKS. TOTAL LENGTH=61m.17s. FLAC format.


This is not the mediocre 'various artists' compilation that was released on its day. If you are a fan of the movie or Howard Shore, this is a must have. This soundtrack is quite rare and limited (as a matter of fact, I think it is a 'bootleg' of sorts), so please help me seed it for a while. Thank you and enjoy.
