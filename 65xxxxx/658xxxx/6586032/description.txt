This a western, comedy.
The movie tells the story of three Romanian brothers (from Transylvania actually) who, having crossed Europe and the Atlantic, are trying to settle in the US Great Plains. One is hunting down "wanted"-criminals to finance the ranch (or rather a house falling apart) his younger brother bought. The younger brother gets married to an American girl.
