                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Help! My House Is Falling Down is presented by Sarah Beeny. The series sees   
 Sarah offering advice on how to repair major structural faults, dealing with  
 subsidence or dealing with nasty pest infestation in different properties each
 week.                                                                         
                                                                               
 Sarah revisits Dave, Sharon and their two children in Hull who were forced out
 of their five-bedroom Victorian house in Hull's Garden Village after huge cracks
 started appearing through their newly decorated walls, causing their doorways
 and windows to get badly bent out of shape. Sarah soon discovered that the large
 trees surrounding the property were the cause for the damage. The local council
 refused permission for the the trees to be cut down. Sarah finds out how the 
 family are now getting on, one year on.
              
                                 Enjoy!
