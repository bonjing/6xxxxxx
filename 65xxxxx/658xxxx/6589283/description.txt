This is William A. Borst's amazing book The Scorpion and the Frog - A Natural Conspiracy (2004) which presents the idea of a conspiracy as a consistent cord that binds all historical progression together. To deny that conspiracies exist is to deny history itself. While there are several chapters on traditional conspirators, from the Masons through the Bilderbergers, this fascinating book unveils the ideas that have unified conspiracies into a coherent rendition of evil. This book is an intellectual history of the "City of God" versus the "City of Man," in the "ultimate culture war." It does not take a cadre of men in some secret room to effect a unified conspiracy. This is the story. A scorpion wants to cross a river, but it canâ€™t swim. It asks a frog to help. The frog is worried, but the scorpion promises "I wonâ€™t sting you, because if I did I would drown". In mid river the scorpion stings the frog. The dying frog asks "Why?" and the drowning scorpion answers "Thatâ€™s my nature". Like the scorpion in the fable, their ideas become second nature to liberals, socialists, or communists and they act in accordance with their nature. The author, known American educator and radio host, presents the philosophical roots of conspiratorial groups that have engulfed the world and are reshaping it into their New world order. 335 pages. A must read for everyone.
