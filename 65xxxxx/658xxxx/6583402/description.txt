US Marshal, Teddy Daniels, has come to Shutter Island, home of Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally

Insane. Along with his partner, Chuck Aule, he sets out to find an escaped patient, a murderess named

Rachel Solando, as a hurricane bears down upon them. Nothing at Ashecliffe Hospital is what it seems,

and disappearing patients arenâ€™t the only secret the island hides. The closer the Marshals get to the

truth, the more elusive it becomes...and the more they begin to fear that someone doesnâ€™t want them to

leave Shutter Island.
