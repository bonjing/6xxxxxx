[T],soupucia,2011-08-03T20:35Z,Official scene release. Please don't bitch about this being virused or etc. Enjoy
,gaza99,2011-08-03T21:39Z,Works perfectly...soupucia thank for sharing and u r the first
,zaqaz,2011-08-03T22:04Z,"I don't get this to work. When I launch the game the pointer shows something is loading for a couple of seconds then nothing happens. 
I couldì±„nt get the Theta release to work either, it crashed the computer. 
I'm running Windows 7 64bit. Any ideas how to solve this?"
,gaza99,2011-08-03T22:04Z,Finished 10 chapters...awesome game...once again Thank u
,zaqaz,2011-08-03T22:39Z,Installed Steam and updated Catalyst drivers. Now this release does exactly the same as the Theta did. It go to a black screen and freeze my computer so I have to physically restart it. 
[T],soupucia,2011-08-03T22:40Z,At what resolution do you initially run it? (aka whats your desktop resolution)
,Netarangi,2011-08-03T22:40Z,"Why the hell is this a ""RIP""? It's about 3MB smaller than the offical one."
[T],soupucia,2011-08-03T22:41Z,.
,zaqaz,2011-08-03T23:16Z,@soupucia: I installed and ran it with 1920x1200 resolution. Should I try something lower?
,ikweetnie,2011-08-03T23:21Z,Got a black screen after the first loading screen.. any ideas? steam installed already
,ikweetnie,2011-08-03T23:23Z,Got a black screen after the first loading screen... any ideas? installed steam already
,springw,2011-08-03T23:36Z,Does any of these work I download it and try to run it and it says  missing no found d3dx9_43.dll any help would be great please .I really like to play this game.
,zaqaz,2011-08-03T23:45Z,@springw: This link http://www.ihaveapc.com/2010/11/how-to-fix-d3dx9_43-dll-missing-error-in-windows-7/ solved that problem for me. But my game still freeze at a black screen.
,djroosta,2011-08-03T23:47Z,"@Springw - Download Direct X 9 then :)

For those who get black screen let it load, it takes a while, but it loads...

It done it with me, and it loaded just fine after 2 minutes.

Or change your res. lower :)

Thanks for the upload :D"
,zaqaz,2011-08-04T00:07Z,"I lowered the resolution and got the game to work, no more freeze at black screen. 
1440x900 worked, 1680x1050 did NOT work. 

Now I'm gonna spend some time actually trying the game! However I doubt I will buy it because of the sloppy coding with the resolution. Lots of people use desktop resolutions higher than 1440x900 today, a problem like this should pass the testing phase."
,Lustikurre,2011-08-04T00:26Z,"Works, No viruses.

The game is very short, but it's really good!

Thanks for uploading :D."

,sunbleached,2011-08-04T08:08Z,"It works great for me, but am I the only person who is having the problem of not being able to save? There is no save option and when I re launch the game it doesn't continue where I left off, it starts back at the very beginning. How are you folks saving?"
[T],soupucia,2011-08-04T08:15Z,"@zaqaz I have no idea why it doesnt work on your max resolution, but its probably because you have an unusual resolution( meaning that the common one would be 1920x1080, and the game works in this resolution just tested it myself). Expect a patch soon i guess."
,Moonshaft,2011-08-04T09:13Z,"My problem is that I had the:

""The program can't start because d3dx9_43.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.""

So I went ahead and installed the latest redist for DirextX....and now the game won't even start. I double click the limbo.exe and absolutely nothing happens.

Any help?"
,gaza99,2011-08-04T10:14Z,@Soupucia can you plzzzzzz upload Bastion pc version. i am waiting for that game
,Stanliwalsh,2011-08-04T12:02Z,"""Does any of these work I download it and try to run it and it says missing no found d3dx9_43.dll any help would be great please .I really like to play this game.""

I used to have the same problem before, I have DirectX11 u see n this dll is DirectX9.

So ppl suggest u update ur directX 
I do it here http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=35

However this never fixed my problem. So wat I did was downloaded d3dx9_43.dll off off google and copy pasted it in the windows program folder...works like a charm. I'm assuming this isn't the right way to do it but hey... It works!! :p GL"
,zaqaz,2011-08-04T12:28Z,"@soupucia: There are basically 2 kinds of 24"" monitors. 
Home = 16:9 1920x1080 
Professional = 16:10 1920x1200 
There are certainly more Home ones but I wouldn't say Pro is ""unusual"", at least not in a way that developers should ignore it. 

Have I done something wrong or can't you save your progress? It was ""saved"" while I was playing but since I restarted the game all previous progress seams gone.  :(

I don't understand the hype around this game. It's pretty cool puzzles and ""unusual"" graphics but you can't even set the volume in the game!"
,TempDude29,2011-08-04T12:47Z,The game starts allright for me and I've played about halfway in one session. Unfortunetely the games progress isnt saved once you quit the game. I've tried it several times but whenever I restart the game I'm back to the first level and cannot load any previously completed chapters.
,Stanliwalsh,2011-08-04T12:56Z,"Sou!! Ok I figured u'd b d best person t ask.

When i unzip unl-limb there isn't an installation folder, it's a program folder(well it looks like it) with Launcher/data/titledata/limbo/Skidrow(??) So ofcus I run directlly from here, tried both 'Launcher' and 'limbo'... so like u said on the description I click Launcher->Save and Launch-> I get a box saying Limbo has stopped working, search online for solution/close the program.. Basically the game does NOT WORK!! Do u know why?"
,farsighter,2011-08-04T14:00Z,"can confirm that it doesnt save progress. I was romping through the game and I was 3/4 through and next time I load it, its gone.

btw, I think the game is overrated, its just a side scrolling Tomb Raider."
,dubeau10,2011-08-04T14:05Z,doesn't save...breaks the atmosphere to restart the same thing over again.
,a7ebak17,2011-08-04T14:44Z,Can't save :(
,Quattrox,2011-08-04T17:21Z,Awsome. Works great. Thank you.
,zaqaz,2011-08-04T20:47Z,"@Stanliwalsh: You are not supposed to UNZIP unl-limb.exe   It's an installer, just run it."
,jackayb,2011-08-05T13:56Z,"at firest he said some (ddl ) files are missing so i updated my directe x and know this error show 
""The application failed to initialize properly(0xc0000005).Click on OK to terminate the application ""
