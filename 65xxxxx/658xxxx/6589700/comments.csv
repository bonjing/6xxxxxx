,jaybeebrad,2011-08-08T05:03Z,Aren't episodes 9 and 10 supposed to air tonight back to back as a 2 hour season finale? Is this both of them or just 9?
,acidsteve,2011-08-08T05:51Z,ok guys just finished downloading and it's legit and the quality is good. haven't watched it just skimmed it. my only concern is that the final episode of the season is supposed to be a 2 hour finalie but it's only 40 min long. Any thoughts?
,acidsteve,2011-08-08T06:18Z,ok nevermind. the episodes aired as 2 episodes so to get the whole thing you have to download s01e10 also. thanx uploader!
