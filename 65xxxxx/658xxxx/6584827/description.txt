Dear Writer

From BBC Radio 4. Written by Jane Rogers; Full-cast dramatisation starring Anne Massey as The Writer and Leah Verity White as Polly.

Ten-year-old Polly sends an email to her favourite author, asking why there have been no new books published recently. The writer responds that she is old and tired and has run out of stories, but there are deeper reasons for her inability to conjure any more from her imagination.
