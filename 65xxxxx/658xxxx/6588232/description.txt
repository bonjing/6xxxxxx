These classic albums were remixed, remastered and put together by original band member Scott Gorham and Joe Elliott (Def Leppard) â€“ each contains a remastered version of the original disc and a second disc of rare bonus tracks. Released in 1976 â€œJohnny the Foxâ€ was Thin Lizzyâ€™s seventh studio album. The overall tone of thealbum is looser than previous albums.
