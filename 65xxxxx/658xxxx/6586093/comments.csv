@ echos
thx for the appreciation friend :)
My bandwidth is poor friend. I skipped many tv series due to their sizes, eg. prison break.about 30 GB. It'll take one whole month to get it downloaded :(
If you can link a source under 10G, may be I can help you :)
@lax
I dont have a Android device bro. I just follow the settings. No idea about playback s/s :(
@blumac
I skipped it. lol :)"

,nexuswolf,2011-08-25T16:07Z,"@lax_prat

Use Mobo Player.....its the best video player which can play each and every format except mkv.....also u don't need to convert files to play them. 1080p and mkv files play very slowly on them though!
:-p"
