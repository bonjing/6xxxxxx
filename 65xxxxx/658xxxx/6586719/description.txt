[b]3 3 "Ramlak Rising"August 5, 2011 (2011-08-05) [/b]

Following the events of the previous night, Lion-O, Cheetara, and Tygra hold 
a funeral pyre for King Claudus, with Lion-O etching the Thundercats symbol 
into the broken statue of his father. Determined to get revenge on Mumm-Ra, 
Lion-O sets out for the Sea of Sands with a relunctant Cheetara and Tygra in tow. 
As they leave Thundera, Wiley Kit and Wiley Kat approach the trio, asking to 
join in the journey until they find El Dara. Lion-O refuses, but the twins follow anyway. 
They reach the desert like ocean, but are captured by a group of Fish people called the Koi. 
Their leader is obsessed with tracking down and killing a creature called Ramlak, which 
sucked up the waters of the Koi's homeland. Lion-O begins to succumb to his own obsession, 
helping the captain's goal despite the protests of Tygra and Cheetara alike. 
Eventually the Ramlak snags the ship with it's tentacles and tears it to pieces, 
forcing Lion-O to forgot his obession and save everyone from drowning, the captain 
dying as he makes one final strike at Ramlak. Once everyone is safe, Lion-O is seemingly 
devoured by Ramlak, only to cut his way out with the Sword of Omens, releasing the 
stolen waters from it's body. With their home restored, the Koi bid the group farewell, 
Lion-O accepting the twins after seeing their capability in battle. At Mumm-Ra's black pyramid, 
it is revealed that Jaga is still alive, but now a prisoner of a lantern which Mumm-Ra claims 
will lead him to the Book of Omens
