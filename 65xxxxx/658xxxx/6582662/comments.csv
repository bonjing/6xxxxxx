,fredfan,2011-08-11T04:26Z,Definitely an R5 with it's acceptable quality and 5.1 sound so weak you can barely tell it's not stereo.  Thanks for spreading the love here.
,LeProNr1,2011-08-16T15:46Z,super goede kwaliteit en geluid. echt goed werk. respect voor mensen zoals jullie.
,bootyboo096,2011-08-28T02:54Z,"Hi NLUPPER002, how come you don't like to include a menu. Having a menu is like having a retail dvd. It gives you the option of scene selection and other stuff. If you could do it like that, it would be appreciated. "
