Plot:
Ex-con Jensen Ames is forced by the warden of a notorious prison to compete in
our post-industrial world's most popular sport: a car race in which inmates must
brutalize and kill one another on the road to victory.

Encoders note:
Well friends here it is brand new QEBS 5.0 engine. I know many of you are asking
what the fuck is this thing. Well let just say it is the tool which is at least
twice as efficient as normal x264 using low bitrates. This mean that even if you
could find better looking encodes, the QEBS encodes will have at least a class
better looking quality than anything else in similar size. Developing QEBS is not
easy and yes during each revision progress not all our choices were good and you
could not be satisfied with the quality in certain areas. To test our progress
we need to reencode the same movies over and over again and that is why we again
give you the same movie TRON, but this time reencoded with our new engine, which
progressed so much, that we decided to give him so much higher number 5.0 and
start to differ our new releases created with it by using QEBS5 in the name.
Wanna know how good the video commpression can be, check this out
