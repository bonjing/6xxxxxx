STANLEY CLARKE MODERN MAN
Label:Epic
Released Date: 1978
Format:Mp3@320


A bit more high concept than before for Stanley Clarke â€“ almost a suite of sorts, but one that still has some great standout tunes in the mix! Although Clarke used to bring his higher concepts to bear in the space of a single song, this one's more of a full exploration of the character in the title â€“ served up at the best moments with more soul than on previous albums from Stanley, some nicely tuneful tracks that almost get a bit funky at points. There's a bit of vocals on the record â€“ courtesy of Dee Dee Bridgewater and others â€“ and guests
