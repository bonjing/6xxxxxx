Ok, haven't got this seeding part figured out to work properly yet so bare with me..(sorry mod velvet I'll try to figure it out..)


And to papakeno, all respekt!! New name will come next time if i come up with a new name... 
HaÂ´ve been thinking of this for a wile and no disrespect intended just wanted to stir things up a bit! ;-) More music is more fun! :-)
This is stuff I like, not neccesarily the best songs ever but good stuff :-)
And I encourage people to get Spotify if U can to get more music for free or for a low fee! It's great! :-)
Since there are SO many electronic groups out there it's really impossible to know them all, so this is something to push U in the right direction to find hopefully new stuff to support :-)


lets hope this one works...
