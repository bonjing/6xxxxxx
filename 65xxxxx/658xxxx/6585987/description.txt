First of all this is not a .iso mod file this has already been put together and it is the memory from my flashdrive. Im not sure if this fully works so please comment saying if it does or not so i know weather to leave it up or take it down to prevent wasting peoples time :(

PLEASE READ THE READ ME FILE FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO SET THIS UP!!

You need an 8gb flash drive im not sure if a bigger one would work but 8gb is the minimum!

I wish you luck :) Happy modding.

(also has .txt with some of the features but i forgot to put a map for the spawn points so heres a link to the picture:
