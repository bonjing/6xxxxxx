,millzy107,2011-08-06T22:11Z,first of all thanks for the upload. so if this is not an iso and you dont burn it to a disk? how do i use it? thanks in advance

@millzy107 its an install file of my modded gta from my iso that i hotswapped with. you just put the files in the flash drive (follow instructions with it) and put it in xbox and it should load up as an installed game."
