In Scream 4, Sidney Prescott, now the author of a self-help book,
returns home to Woodsboro on the last stop of her book tour.
There she reconnects with Sheriff Dewey and Gale, who are now
married, as well as her cousin Jill (played by Emma Roberts) and
her Aunt Kate (Mary McDonnell). Unfortunately Sidneys appearance
also brings about the return of Ghost Face, putting Sidney, Gale,
and Dewey, along with Jill, her friends, and the whole town of
Woodsboro in danger.
