 Peter Andre: Here 2 Help sees Peter Andre offering a helping hand to different
 members of the public.                                                        
                                                                               
 The singer and his team visit Terry Kemp and Chris Johns, who need help with
 their Kent and East Sussex-based animal rescue centre Happy Endings. Setting up
 the sanctuary has taken up all the couple's free time and they are hoping that
 Peter can help them recruit volunteers, re-home animals and increase the profile
 of the establishment.  
                                    
                                 Enjoy!
