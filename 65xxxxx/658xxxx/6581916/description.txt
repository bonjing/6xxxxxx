The BSAVA Manual of Exotic Pets has been a tried and trusted friend over the years. There are now many more nonâ€“traditional pets and both owners and veterinary surgeons have higher expectations of clinical care for these species. It is against this background that this new edition is published. All chapters have been completely revised and updated by 30 international experts.

The BSAVA Manual of Exotic Pets, 4th edition covers an extended species range, including the degu and sugar glider. It also has expanded chapters where information is now in greater demand, such as for the chinchilla. Additional chapters group together clinical anatomy and radiography of the major groups.
