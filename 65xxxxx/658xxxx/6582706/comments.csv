,reddfraser,2011-08-04T22:56Z,"HEY TIRA...
     Why don't you and all your rude, arrogant, though more experienced, pecker-wood friends quit with your power-tripping put downs. This guy is trying to do something good.As a VERY intelligent man, just getting into PC's, they are NOT user friendly!!! A marketing oxymoron....like 'Military Intelligence"", Or ""Polite, gutless bully""...
      We newbies are out here, and we waste hours every day trying to figure this crap out. Quick suggestion:
Next time, and times after, invest 2 more lines of type.....And walk us down the twisted, dark pathway, through the swamp infested brains of people like GATES, who make this shit so hard to figure out on our own.
        Now go to your room...W/O your milk and animal crackers!!"
,reddfraser,2011-08-04T23:21Z,"Hey scenebalance,
     Been coming to PB few weeks now and has used your stuff many times.....with no problems. 
      I just now learned how to get in here so I could start saying thanks to you guys.....Numb nuts Tira was my 1st letter. Man, these pinheads that bully from behind the screen always get my goat : ALL BITCH-- But never a detailed, helpful suggestion
       Anyway, just so you know lots of us REALLY appreciate all your efforts, and my new place is isolated....no TV at all. All these shows, movies, science text books, PC programs, etc are such a treat!! 
          Just to get a little greedy....Does anyone know where I can get The Rachel Maddow Show , Of MSN, to go with the Keith Olbermann's Show I'm finally finding on here. Used to be able to download off her MSNBC, and watch full speed. Now the download logo just spins forever, and no clips will open...which magic circle, in which buried sub-menu, do I have to find to put the curative check mark in?
      Lastly, are there any free TV sites that actually have Kelowna's Shaw cable lineup on it??
Thanks again."
,tiramisubob,2011-08-04T23:31Z,"oh, yes, let us GIVE THANKS TO HE WHO CANNOT SEED!  and fuck both of you bitches, you clearly need to spend a little less time on the internet and try to get laid for once!  i give thanks where it is due and it is certainly not due when my download has been in que for over six hours and HAS YET TO EVEN START!  there are clearly more stupid people than intelligent people on the planet and your comments are only evidence of that.  cheers!"
,tiramisubob,2011-08-05T01:58Z,"i now give THANKS because my download is GOING!  i give utmost gratitude to those decent folk who SEED!  if we all give just a little, the world will be a MUCH better place!  i apologize for earlier comments in a rage; roseanne is a goddess to me and i don't have lifetime so this show is hard to come by for me.  thanks a bunch, seeders!  i will keep it up for a few days!  :)"
,reddfraser,2011-08-05T07:32Z,"Tira, 
     u obviously didn't get my point...your 2nd rant was 5 lines....tell us poor newbies who don't know these sites, (which have F**KING USELESS   ""help""
sections), HOW to seed...I'd be happy to...spent hours trying, with no luck. OR is there a Vuze for Dummys-type book you could recommend.?"
