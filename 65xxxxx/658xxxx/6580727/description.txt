When the evil wizard Gargamel chases the tiny blue Smurfs out of their village, 
they tumble from their magical world and into ours -- in fact, smack dab in the middle of Central Park. 
Just three apples high and stuck in the Big Apple, the Smurfs must find a way to get back to their 
village before Gargamel tracks them down
