,bearzoo,2011-08-25T10:09Z,"All of his games have viruses. Or most at the very least. All of his games are extract tons of files (a general protection no-no) and then run an .exe next (the biggest of all protection no-no's!)

 If you look at his games, they get uploaded.. then that same day or the proceeding few days the same accounts leave comments saying thanks, worked great. They are his fake accounts thanking himself. He doesn't even spread it out. He just does that same and the next few days. Then there are NO comments after that on almost all of them. This was my initial indication of a fagot.

 Always read the comments. Always follow the safe procedures until you know the uploader to be trustworthy. Good luck guys."

,Wowtgp,2011-10-01T09:02Z,@Bearzoo if you dont know what you are talking about then shut the fuck up.i have downloaded atleast 20 games from him and never had a virus.he just cracks the game and then compress it with 7z or winrar.
