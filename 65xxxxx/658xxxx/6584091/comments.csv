[V],Masterzilla,2011-08-06T11:52Z,"Hey, would you rerip first 2 episodes for us perfectionists who'd like it better in your 350 mb format? :D please?"
[T],fredyr,2011-08-06T15:28Z,"The 2 first HDTV episodes are well seeded and the quality is perfect, i watched them myself too.

I'm thinking to encode the first 2 episodes at 350MB and releasing the whole season into a single torrent after the last episode airs next month :)

According to IMDB this season will only have 10 episodes unlike the previous which had 13."
