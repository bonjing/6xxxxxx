Having checked the original torrents it turns out that E09 was reloaded due to the original being episode E08 the one that is included in this torrent. Because of this E09 is not in this collection. Yet not a single person has pointed this out to me after the torrent has been live for nearly 2 months. Useful bunch you lot are, grateful too. If anyone wants me to upload E09 separately then ask, other than that you will need to locate a copy"
