SUMMARY:
Throughout history, tales of chivalry have burnished the legends of brave, 
handsome knights who rescue fair damsels, slay dragons and conquer evil. 
But behind many a hero is a good-for-nothing younger brother trying just to 
stay out of the way of those dragons, evil and trouble in general. Danny McBride 
and James Franco team up for an epic comedy adventure set in a fantastical 
world-Your Highness. As two princes on a daring mission to save their land, 
they must rescue the heir apparent's fiancÃ©e before their kingdom is destroyed. 
Thadeous (McBride) has spent his life watching his perfect older brother 
Fabious (Franco) embark upon valiant journeys and win the hearts of his people. 
Tired of being passed over for adventure, adoration and the throne, he's 
settled for a life of wizard's weed, hard booze and easy maidens. But when 
Fabious' bride-to-be, Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel), gets kidnapped by the 
evil wizard Leezar (Justin Theroux), the king gives his deadbeat son an 
ultimatum: Man up and help rescue her or get cut off. Half-assedly embarking 
upon his first quest, Thadeous joins Fabious to trek across the perilous 
outlands and free the princess. Joined by Isabel (Natalie Portman)-an elusive 
warrior with a dangerous agenda of her own-the brothers must vanquish 
horrific creatures and traitorous knights before they can reach Belladonna. 
If Thadeous can find his inner hero, he can help his brother prevent the 
destruction of his land. Stay a slacker, and not only does he die a coward, 
he gets front row seats to the dawn of an all-new Dark Ages.
