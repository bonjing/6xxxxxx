,richilooo,2012-05-01T10:25Z,This file doesnt have separate subtitiles. I like to hardcode my subs into the file so i can transfer it to my ps3 and play on my TV instead of computer. Does anyone know where the correct english subs are for this version? Ive looked but all the other ones appear to be out of time with this version. Cheers for any help.
