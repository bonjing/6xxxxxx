Megafactories: Swedish Super Car
Only a privileged few ever get behind the wheel of the slick, sexy Koenigsegg and, similarly, only a privileged few play a role in its lovingly hand-built construction. Enter their artistic Swedish factory. Discover how each powerful Koenigsegg car is lovingly hand-built, in a Swedish factory that looks more like an art studio than a car production plant.
The basic concept of the Koenigsegg is simple: a road car body that incorporates a Formula One racing car chassis. Koenigseggs are among the most exclusive super cars in the world with unparalled levels of performance. The combination of uncompromising quality in both finish and function and the use of space age materials make these super cars among the very best in automotive history. Koenigseggs are built to excel on the road or racetrack, yet are still highly comfortable for long distance travelling.
