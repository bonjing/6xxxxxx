    Her name is Diana Jackson, but you can call her T.N.T. When T.N.T.'s     
    brother is killed by ruthless drug dealers, the beautiful young          
    karate expert goes to the most dangerous part of Chinatown to find       
    the killer. In trouble with the law since she was 13, T.N.T. wants no    
    help from the pigs; but she does befriend a Chinaman named Joe, whose    
    impressive martial arts skills prove useful more than once. In her       
    quest for the killer, she'll meet the white drug lord, Sid; Elaine,      
    his bitchy girlfriend; his suspicious Chinese assistant, Ming; and       
    Charlie, his handsome black assistant with criminal ambitions of his     
    own. Before her search is over, she'll find herself making love to       
    Charlie, trading insults with Elaine, and fighting criminals while       
    nude and in the dark. Just call her T.N.T.
