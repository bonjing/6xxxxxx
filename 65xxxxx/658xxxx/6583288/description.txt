Storyline:


Stallone. Stone. Two Hollywood titans combine fiery action with steamy sensuality in The Specialist. Sharon Stone is May Munro, a drop-dead beauty with a fatal past. She's sworn death to the mobsters who murdered her parents and she also knows the right man for the job: cool-fire ex-CIA explosives expert Ray Quick (Sylvester Stallone). Miami's playground of the rich becomes an incendiary slayground as May lures the killers and Ray ingeniously detonates them into ashes. But a vicious mob boss (Rod Steiger), his brash son (Eric Roberts) and a psychotic hired gun (James Woods) with a lethal grudge against Quick won't go without a fight. And the fevered passions shared by the two avengers can't hide an ominous question from Ray. Is May falling for him.... Or is she setting him up, too?
