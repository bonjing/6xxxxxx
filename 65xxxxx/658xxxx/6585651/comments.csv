Life is not always fair or easy and bankruptcy is a tool for a fresh start. Grow the fuck up, and just wait till you are in a position where you need help or protection from creditors that want to take everything...above and beyond what they are owed.

Ever wonder what happens when people get hospitalized due to serious injury and they cannot pay their bills? Health related issues are why over 80% of all bankruptcies are filed.

Think it is fair for the creditors to up the interest rate from 12% to over 33% just because you are unemployed or miss one payment or because you are a minority?

Still riding that big high, I KNOW NOTHING, retarded horse of yours ramikaz???"
