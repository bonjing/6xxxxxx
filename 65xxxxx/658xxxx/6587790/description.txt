"This beautiful and disturbing film recounts Americas story from the
environments point of view. From the arrival of Columbus to the simple
wilderness living of the 16th and 17th centuries, through the agrarian
lifestyle of the 18th century, the changes from the Industrial Revolution,
to the 20th century when most of the planets resources have been depleted
-- this film examines the North American landscape and all the wildlife
destruction, deforestation, soil depletion and pollution that have been
wrought to make the American Dream come true."
