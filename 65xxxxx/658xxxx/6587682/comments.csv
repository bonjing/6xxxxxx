,MikeXRyan,2011-08-07T06:22Z,Just finished watching this movie.  Wasn't really expecting anything great but WOW!  Franco is totally excellent!  Absolutely great movie - we haven't seen anything this good for quite some time.  The monkeys on the Golden Grate Bridge were fantastic.  We were CHEERING like crazy people for the monkeys!  
,JRJ-000,2011-08-07T06:22Z,Very good TS. A/V 9&9  Thanks
,LordReserei,2011-08-07T08:45Z,"Probably the best quality out there right now and fast download speed too. 

Thanks. 

V - 9
A - 9"
,LordReserei,2011-08-07T08:57Z,Does anyone know where I can get English subs for sign language? 
,sukdink9999,2011-08-07T09:50Z,"Video is quite good for a TS - 8/10(for TS)
Audio has a buzzing noise through out - 6/10(for TS)

Think I'll hold out for for a version with the audio buzz fixed but thanks to uploader"
,ogrilla,2011-08-07T10:55Z,@LordReserei: This is the problem I'm having. I really want to know what the sign language is and the other one I downloaded was in Russian. Didn't think it'd be a problem until the orangutan started talkin to Caesar.
,nawitch,2011-08-07T12:46Z,"Blaaaaa   Video 9 A-4 first off, a constant clicking in the audio, but worst of all, file can only be played using VLC,    good try though  :) "
,miketheratguy,2011-08-07T13:34Z,"Here you go ogrilla m8. I did the translation myself- literally stopping the movie to look up a Russian online keyboard and copying that into google translate, lol. This is a literal translation so the dialog is open to some interpretation, but you can tell that it's generally accurate.

You didn't miss much, but I had to know too. :)

FIRST SIGN LANGUAGE SCENE


-Are you badly hurt?

-You know sign language?

-I'm an orangutan from the circus.

...

-Beware of people. Don't like clever monkeys.



SECOND SIGN LANGUAGE SCENE


-Why cookies rocket?

-A monkey...weak.
Monkeys together - a force.

...

-Stupid monkey."
,miketheratguy,2011-08-07T13:35Z,For you too Lord Reserei. :)
,miketheratguy,2011-08-07T13:52Z,"Lol I think my comment got deleted. Oh well, if it appears twice in the end, I guess I'll apologize then.

For the guys like myself who wanted to know the sign language scenes- here's a translation I made with a Russian online keyboard and google translate, lol):

,fs_1999,2011-08-07T14:59Z,I get no audio after 5 seconds.
,Bargetti,2011-08-07T15:41Z,"@miketheratguy

Everything you got is correct but it is ""Monkeys are stupid"".

btw, anyone know if the audio is out of sync at the end or is this a different copy?"
,BrandonRose,2011-08-07T18:47Z,"Great copy 
V/7
A/9
M/8
had to use vlc to play it but no big deal "
,miketheratguy,2011-08-08T02:29Z,"@Bargetti

Thanks for the correction. And I don't know if this will help, but for my copy of the film, which I got from zaq2qaz, the audio seems kind of messed up when you see the man in the helicopter for the last time, but when Caesar is being spoken to at the end the dialogue seems pretty well-synced."
,Insertyourlinehere1rrhafj,2011-08-08T03:09Z,This is great! Thank you! The quality is awesome for cam :) I will be seeding tonight.

,ThePwncilSharpener,2011-08-10T08:16Z,"This is bullshit. When I play it on the divx plus player, a stupid ad pops up. I already checked to remove ads on file>prefrences, but when I do it just does the same thing, but without the ad. It just plays it for half a second and then it stops. WTF!!"
