,bob-420,2011-08-31T19:48Z,"get a dvd player that doesn't have the cinavia protection....you're a moron if you think anyone that uploads just puts the cinavia restrictions on it.  Get a player without cinavia restrictions, and you'll be good to go.  Or buy a big monitor for your computer to replace your t.v. with.  
Sony Playstation 3 (PS3) firmware 3.10 or higher
Pioneer BDP-V6000
Marantz UD5005 UD7006
LG BDP550

these dvd players have cinavia protection...if you have one...oooops too bad for you"
