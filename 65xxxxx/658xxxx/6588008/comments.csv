,ChuckDzzNutz,2011-08-07T10:16Z,What is the difference between this one and the one you have in the High Res category?  They both have the same title and are the same size so I'm guessing nothing?
,labcoat,2011-08-07T11:40Z,"Thank you very much. Being in South Africa, I'd never see UFC events if it weren't for the kind souls on TPB :)"
,strontkegel16,2011-08-07T12:30Z,"Question here.

I allways watch downloaded movies, series and obviously the UFC events on a mede8er player on my tv. Not a single problem with anything, except the audio on UFC events. Allways weird blips and blops throughout the show. Anybody knows anything about that?"
