This is nutty and rather extraordinary I must say!
Its certainly hard to take Bob Hoskins lip sync-ing to a woman's
singing voice or see him doing a quick dance with his banker.

That said, it is for the curious as to what insane antics we 
have to put up with seeing our best stars get put up to.

More importantly, we bring his to you for the great schoolchildren
featured beginning at the start of the program, as these great 
children seem truly insanely mistreated by an insane schooling system
while they do their best to remain truly vibrant in radiating
the best of human idealism as is their birthright and entitlement to
do by gods own will as they say!
