,kill1234,2011-08-09T23:39Z,Can it work on iPod touch 3g?
,uchihasasuke2709,2011-08-10T03:26Z,@kill1234 no it says iPod Touch 4G for a reason go search up 3G and they'll give you it
,uchihasasuke2709,2011-08-10T03:27Z,@v0hnj33 yes needs registartion but on ebay they have 99cents but heard that Apple are terminating accounts that have sold slots to make a *PROFIT*
