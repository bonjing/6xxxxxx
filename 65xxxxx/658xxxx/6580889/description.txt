PLOT

Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and find security has been tightened because of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black's escape from Azkaban, the wizarding prison. Harry learns that Black betrayed Harry's parents to the evil Lord Voldemort 12 years ago, leading to their deaths. Black is also known to have murdered the Potters' good friend, Peter Pettigrew.

Despite the disapproval of headmaster Albus Dumbledore, the grounds of Hogwarts are being guarded by Dementors, dark, sinister beings that drain the happiness of anyone nearby and are the appointed guards of Azkaban. The Dementors have a particularly strong effect on Harry, causing him to black out and hear the screams of his dying parents every time they come near him. Professor Remus Lupin, the school's new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, befriends Harry and agrees to teach him the Patronus Charm, a difficult spell used to repel Dementors.

Harry is depressed to learn he will not be allowed to visit Hogsmeade, the local wizarding village, with his fellow third-years, because his guardian, Uncle Vernon, has refused to sign the permission form. Harry is also angry with his arch-nemesis Draco Malfoy for ruining gamekeeper Hagrid's first lesson as Care of Magical Creatures teacher. Malfoy's rude behavior during the lesson causes him to be attacked by a Hippogriff named Buckbeak, and Malfoy's father Lucius promises that Buckbeak will be executed in the course of the year.

Meanwhile, Sirius Black manages to break into Hogwarts twice, presumably to reach Harry, but is unsuccessful. Fred and George Weasley give Harry the Marauder's Map, a map that shows the whereabouts of everybody on the grounds of Hogwarts as well as secret passageways that can get him from the castle into Hogsmeade.

Ron discovers that Scabbers, his rat, has disappeared and believes he has been eaten by Crookshanks, Hermione's cat, causing a falling-out between him and Hermione. Hermione later finds Scabbers hiding in Hagrid's hut when the three of them visit him before Buckbeak's execution. On their way back from Hagrid's, the three hear the sounds of Buckbeak being executed. Just then, a large, black dog appears and attacks Ron, dragging him and Scabbers into a hidden passage beneath the magical and dangerous Whomping Willow. Harry and Hermione receive a brutal beating from the Whomping Willow before entering the passageway in pursuit of Ron.

Harry and Hermione follow the sounds of Ron's screams and find themselves in an old, boarded-up shack in Hogsmeade, known as the Shrieking Shack. They also discover that the dog is actually Sirius Black, who is an Animagus and able to transform from dog to human at will. While Harry attempts to get revenge on Black for betraying his parents, Professor Lupin suddenly arrives. To the shock of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, Lupin embraces Black like a brother.

Hermione confronts Lupin about habits she has observed during her classes with him, accusing him of being a werewolf. Lupin admits to being a werewolf, and begins to explain that he, Sirius, James Potter (Harry's father), and Peter Pettigrew were inseparable friends while at Hogwarts, even writing the Marauder's Map together. To make Lupin's monthly transformations into a wolf more enjoyable, his friends all became Animagi so they could safely interact with him in his animal state.

The Marauders remained friends after Hogwarts. When they learned that Voldemort was planning to go after the Potters, Sirius agreed to become their Secret-Keeper, the only one to know of their hidden location. Harry interjects that he knows the story: Sirius betrayed the Potters' location to Voldemort, and later killed Pettigrew as well.

However, Sirius then reveals that he had secretly switched his duty as Secret-Keeper with Pettigrew, to throw Voldemort off the Potters' trail. Pettigrew was the real betrayer, and faked his own death in order to frame Sirius for the murders. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are skeptical, but Sirius swears that he can prove the truth, as he believes Scabbers to be the Animagus form of Peter Pettigrew.

Professor Snape suddenly barges in on the scene, and upon seeing Sirius and Lupin together, threatens to turn them over to the Dementors. Harry, Hermione, and Ron, wanting to see if Sirius is telling the truth, all attack Professor Snape, knocking him out. This allows Lupin and Sirius to revert Scabbers back into Pettigrew.

Pettigrew admits to the story, but Harry stops Sirius and Lupin from killing him, not wanting his father's best friends to turn into murderers. Instead, Harry persuades them to take Pettigrew back to Hogwarts in order to clear Sirius's name before turning Pettigrew over to the Dementors. As they return to the castle, the full moon emerges and Lupin transforms into a werewolf. Amidst the confusion, Pettigrew transforms back into a rat and escapes across the grounds.

Lupin begins to lose control of himself in his wolf form, knocking out Sirius and nearly killing Harry, before a strange howl lures him away into the Forbidden Forest. Harry finds an unconscious Sirius lying by the lake, where Dementors suddenly descend on the pair and nearly kill them. They are saved at the last minute by a strange figure across the lake, who casts the Patronus Charm. Before passing out, Harry believes the figure is his father.

Harry awakes in the hospital wing, only to learn that Sirius has been captured and is being imprisoned in the castle, awaiting his fate. On Dumbledore's quiet suggestion, Harry and Hermione use a Time-Turner (which Hermione has secretly been using all year to take multiple classes at the same time) to travel back in time and try to prevent Sirius's capture.

Harry and Hermione first manage to rescue Buckbeak from his execution. They then watch the scenes of the night unfold while safely hidden from sight, as any interference with their past selves could prove disastrous. When they finally see the Dementors cornering Harry and Sirius at the lake, Harry watches intently for the figure who conjured the Patronus, only to realize at the last moment that it was, in fact, himself. Harry quickly performs the Patronus Charm and watches as Sirius is discovered by Professor Snape and taken up to the castle. Harry and Hermione then fly Buckbeak up to the tower where Sirius is imprisoned, and help him escape on Buckbeak into the dark. Having accomplished what they set out to do, Harry and Hermione rush back to the hospital wing just in time.

Lupin, now revealed to all as a werewolf, must resign, even though he was the best professor Harry had ever had at Hogwarts. Harry is worried that Pettigrew, now free, may help Voldemort to return, but Dumbledore says that Harry may be grateful one day that he helped save Pettigrew's life. On the way home on Hogwarts Express, Harry receives a letter from a small owl from Sirius Black, thanking him for saving his life, and that he is in hiding, and also granting him permission to visit Hogsmeade in the coming year. Ron is also given the owl, as a replacement for Scabbers. As the train reaches King's Cross, Harry greets Uncle Vernon, and is whisked back to the Muggle world, looking forward to another enchanting year at Hogwarts.
