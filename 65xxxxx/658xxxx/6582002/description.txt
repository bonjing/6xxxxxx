What does a possibly demon possessed boy, a poet traveling by Greyhound, a miracle healer, and an adulterer caught in a repeating sequence of recycled time have in common? They all come from the twisted mind of Eric Simpson. In these four \\\"true\\\" tales, Simpson explores family, religion, love and loss in truly disconcerting and peculiar circumstances. Degradation: When Peter Lindquist cheats on his wife again and again, he really does it repeatedly. Trapped in a cycle of time, Peter and his lover and wife seek escape. Judgment Sunday: A Pastor holds an entire congregation captive, waiting for someone to publicly confess sexual sin, and a young boy, possibly possessed, thinks he is the culprit. Dog: A missionary discovers God can use him to heal diseases, then is confronted with his grandfather\\\'s wish to heal his dying dog. The Poet: Confronted with the loss of love and his own dark history, a poet traveling across country via Greyhound confronts his own demons.
