what about season 6,7,8"
,rojo85,2011-08-20T03:36Z,"Any chance of getting Season 8 in this quality?

The other rips don't even come close. "
[V],meech,2011-08-20T15:45Z,Concur with the audio issue in episode 11.  The english track stops around 1:07 then re-starts the audio from the beginning of the episode which obviously doesn't match the video for the rest of the episode.  So just an fyi...don't start watching this ep. as you will be disappointed to not be able to finish it to the end (it's a special 2-part episode).  Get this ep. from another torrent.  However do note that the rest of the torrent (and other smallville torrents) are great quality.  Thanks to the uploader!
,rojo85,2011-09-11T15:55Z,Would love to see Season 8 & 10 in this quality. Your uploads are the only good ones ILPruny!!!!!

,zelimshan,2012-02-15T21:19Z,"Note that the AUDIO is RUSSIAN, but you can also turn the translation off and play the english original sound. (at least BS player can..)
Great quality and fantastic torrent ! I will seed forever"
