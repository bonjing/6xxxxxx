For thousands of years, writing has been a powerful way for us to communicate with one another, to share our distinct thoughts and ideas through the power of words. Even in today's technologically saturated 21st century, we still express ourselves in writing almost every single day. And oftentimes, we write to argue our viewpoints, persuade others that we're right, and share our unique experiences and perspectives.

But all writing-whether it's a powerful essay, a persuasive letter, a detailed business report, or an autobiographical story-is at its most effective and memorable when it's built on the fundamental critical and analytical skills that transform your words from ''good'' writing to ''great'' writing. Regardless of your subject, your goal, or your occasion, these skills are the heart and soul of engaging and effective writing. They include the ability to

* organize your thoughts into a coherent piece that never leaves your reader behind;

* make a persuasive argument rooted in solid facts;

* draw on the styles and characteristics of various literary genres;

* make responsible use of research materials and outside resources; and

* avoid common grammar errors that could cost you your credibility.

You'll find the secrets to these and other concepts and methods for clear and strong writing in the 24 accessible and practical lectures of Analysis and Critique: How to Engage and Write about Anything.
