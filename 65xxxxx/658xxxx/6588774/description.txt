Cannibal Holocaust and the Savage Cinema of Ruggero Deodato
By Harvey Fenton, Julian Grainger, Gian Luca Castoldi

It is a book about Ruggero Deodato and all of the films he directed, not just the cannibal ones... but it does spend a lot of time on those. There are a lot of pictures, movie posters from around the world, and other interesting information.
