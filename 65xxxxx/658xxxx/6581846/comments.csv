,MyFootHurts,2011-09-05T17:41Z,"Anybody else have a problem where the video freezes permanently after 2 seconds of playing in MPC-HC? Works fine in VLC, but I'd prefer the higher quality playback."
,MyFootHurts,2011-09-07T00:37Z,"^ If anybody else has that problem, disable ffdshow DXVA in your CCCP settings."
,alambuko,2011-11-01T20:57Z,"After downloading this, I will seed for a very long time."
,Dexterspet,2012-01-01T07:25Z,"Worked great, love the anime so far, love the torrent, love the quality.

Well done and nicely put together."
,Vincent17601,2012-01-29T11:43Z,"Downloaded this and all I'm seeing is English dub. I have ffdshow and CCCP, so, if there's something else that's needed, any help would be much obliged. Ugh, the English dub for this show is beyond awful."

Any media player that allows you to switch between audio tracks will do (VLC or MPCHC for example). I do not recommend DivX player.

As for compatibility with your mobile, it depends on what it can handle playing."
