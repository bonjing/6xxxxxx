Formed in 2008 in the small village of Cisco Illinois (pop. 300) by Aaron Blythe and Josh Winters, the duo wrote and recorded 6 tracks for their first EP (nearly 31 minutes) "Warrior Style" in early 2009. Soon the duo had expanded to a trio, in preparation for live performance, w...ith the addition of Erich Hehn (Bass, Vocals). The track "Truel", featuring drumming from Mike Hogan(ex-Confines) as well as Blythe and Winters, focuses on rhythmic juxtaposition and collaboration in attempting to portray a "confrontation amongst 3 adversaries" (the definition of truel). While, tracks like "Mountain" display conversational improv between guitar and drums, as well as elements of late 60's free jazz. The 2 tracks with vocals, "Trainrider" and "Last Rice", vary sharply from their instrumental counterparts. "Trainrider" being an almost-ballad with heart-felt lyrics and a blaring guitar solo, and "Last Rice" having a whimsical blues-rock feel, with Hehn sing-yelling in Korean.
Drawing comparisons to The Melvins, Sleep, and Shellac, Man Made Blast combines a number of genres and compositional styles to carve out a unique album in "Warrior Style".
