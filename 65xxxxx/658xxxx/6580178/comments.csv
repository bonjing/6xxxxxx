stfu. It would be better to have one file. Some of us want to reencode for other devices also, I have a shortcut to reencode a single file to 750 megs. This way I can't do that. 

Nobody says it's a big hassle, but it's just if it could be avoided it would be slightly better. I looked at the other DVD rip and it's the exact same... two files.  "

,st0gey,2011-09-23T07:21Z,"thanks very much for this!

In case anyone's interested, Jean Rhys wrote a great prequel to this called 'Wide Sargasso Sea' which, was made into a movie and apparently can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5707331/Wide.Sargasso.Sea.2006.DVDRip.AC3.X264-BARC0DE
I haven't downloaded this copy but I have seen the movie and can say it's a very good adaptation of the novel. It's very different to Jane Eyre (tells the back-story of Rochester and his first wife, Bertha, the one locked in the attic!) but it's a great story, well worth a look."
,thenursepp,2011-09-23T09:44Z,OK! Thanks! Ô¿Ô
,kyfos95,2011-11-12T15:04Z,thank you!!!!!

,lalalynn,2012-03-30T16:30Z,the sound won't work for me! It is happening with other movies as well. Suggestions?
,generic42,2012-05-10T00:54Z,"Great movie.  High quality file.  A9 V9 Much thanks to original uploader.  

ISP tracked me and sent a cease and desist letter.  Just FYI."
