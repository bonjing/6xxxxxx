,zablot,2011-08-08T15:41Z,Where did the seeder go?
,alown1,2011-08-08T17:43Z,"I told my friend to seed it, but she turned off her computer. I'll seed it more now but I have slow internets. "
,JackAteJill,2011-08-09T03:38Z,"how is this the only torrent i can find for this anywere and theres no one seeding ! 
thanks for the effort though.
i seriously appreciate it."
,real234,2011-08-09T06:28Z,all the fuckin trackers are shittin out. thx for the up regardless.
,real234,2011-08-09T06:47Z,@alown1 tell your friend you'll eat her out if she seeds this shit hardcore.
,JackAteJill,2011-08-09T08:57Z,ridiculous that this is the only torrent out there for this and just my luck . . 0 !! seeders ! anyone have any luck anywhere else ? (obviously you wouldn't be reading this if you did but im desperate) 
,real234,2011-08-09T09:50Z,"@JackAteJill no where else. i've checked a couple private trackers and they dont have a copy either.
at the current rate from one seeder it will take about a month after u get to 3.60gb :(. i may just 
buy a copy and upload it since i got a decent upload speed."
,Chesterchaz,2011-08-09T17:28Z,"Thanks for the upload!

Is this the untouched DVD9 or a re-encode?

The .nfo of the AURORA-release, that can't be found anywhere, mentions LPCM audio, while this seems to have AC3 audio (as far as I can tell from the chunks that downloaded)."
,andulis,2011-08-09T19:57Z,"seeeeeed,plz! I really wanna see this dvd!"
,moesama00,2011-08-09T23:05Z,By the Size I think it's a DVD-9 (6.42Gb).... But please SEED!!
,moodesty,2011-08-10T01:26Z,70%. SUCCESS. 
,JackAteJill,2011-08-10T02:09Z,ditto. ive been at 70% for about a day and a half already. i can assure you as soon as its complete ill try and seed till i bleed to get some more seeders on this thing. 
,d4w1d3k,2011-08-10T09:43Z,"Stuck at 73,8 %  :/

Please seed!"
,alown1,2011-08-10T11:00Z,"I thought I didn't have to seed anymore, I have 14 seeds showing in utorrent. "
,alown1,2011-08-10T11:04Z,"@Chesterchaz
I just ripped it and uploaded it. 
I used dvd decrytper. "
,Chesterchaz,2011-08-10T11:44Z,"Thanks for the reply, alown1. I figured the .nfo of the AURORA release was wrong about the PCM audio."
,SoupGuise,2011-08-11T05:28Z,Stuck at 98.6%... Seed please.
,d4w1d3k,2011-08-11T06:38Z,"Stuck at 99,5 % "
,moesama00,2011-08-11T08:09Z,"It's just me or the sound sounds weird?? Like a in ""slow motion""?? Someone with differrent opinion??"
,SoupGuise,2011-08-11T08:16Z,"@moesama00

Yeah, I actually noticed that too. Although maybe he actually played the songs live like that."
,Binary010,2011-08-14T19:42Z,"Does the bass sound really mumbled for anyone else? I doubt it was on the DVD like that, because I found an audio only where the bass is a lot cleaner.

Not complaining, just wondering if its something with my sound set up."
,shriek_span,2011-08-18T07:26Z,seeeeed plz 
,PaulvdHeide,2011-08-20T23:50Z,Thx for uploading. I don't torrent stuff of deadmau5 but i just don't have a creditcard to but the damn thing :P so thanks again for uploading.
,PaulvdHeide,2011-08-21T03:09Z,"I'm using nero to put it on a dvd, but it doesn't work. Which files need to be on the dvd, because it says that specific files aren't supposed to be on the dvd"
