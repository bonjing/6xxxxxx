Right, apologies for the long description but I'm going to try answer everything at once :P 

This is the final Snow Leopard VMware Image I'll be bringing out until the release of 10.6.9 (which I doubt will happen), and with it comes every fix that I've worked on in the past, what? 3 months? Both Intel and AMD processors are supported, with various fixes implemented to accommodate both, without actually changing much from 'stock' 10.6.8 (the kernel is even the same :P). Ideal for running XCode or any other Mac programs, they work as though it was a Mac, and as usual with any of my builds, there's plenty of contact information contained within the torrent should you need me (it's in the torrent so it's not broadcasted online). Oh, and every language Mac OS X supports is also included.

Make sure to watch the video link, because it details how to configure for your preferences (i.e. some stuff won't work unless you configure) and there is also valuable information on it

Works under pretty much all VMware products, only problems you may get are with video and audio (audio is easily fixable whereas video is slightly more complicated).
