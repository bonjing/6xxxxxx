,rOb_hAm,2011-08-19T15:08Z,"First time I have tried to upgrade OS on Mac so a bit of advice would be appreciated. 
Can You upgrade without doing a clean install ?
Is it at all reversible ?
Is the the right version for me to use for the above ? 
Im very experienced with Pc's windows ect. Been working in IT for 11 years but this is my first ""dabble"" with my Mac so I'm a bit wary of making a complete balls of it !!
 So any advice from experienced Mac techs would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks "

,skulldragon,2011-10-03T08:38Z,"Finally, after 2 unsuccessful tries to get Macs to work, this one actually does work!
Sad, that there are no tutorials about getting this to work on VirtualBox - what would be the differences anyway?

Anyway, audio can be fixed easily and for Adobe Flash issue, it can be solved easily too.

This works on my PC: XP Pro SP3 x86, Intel Core i7 2600K, 4GB DDR3, 2GB AMD HD 6950 DVI.

The only problem is to find some programs to put on Mac. Bricksmith sure was crap."
,rtudd87,2011-10-10T19:46Z,"This works for me on Linux/AMD64/VirtualBox-4.1.2:

Create VM, select type ""Mac OS X Server""
Disable EFI by unchecking Settings -> System -> Enable EFI
Add boot CD in ""Storage -> CD/DVD Drive -> Choose a virtual CD/DVD disk file"". Select ""EmpireEFI4AMD.iso"" (this is in the directory ""Boot .iso's [Not Required, But Just In Case]/"" from this torrent)."

The patch files are not any kind of virus. They're picked up as one because of what they need to do to patch certain files.

If you need help with certain issues, you need to post give us a little more information than ""this isn't working."" Computer specs and detailed information like what you were doing and what messages you are receiving."
