The keygen in the CS5.5 torrents had a limited formula of keys which MS is now blocking.

The new keygen serial worked, and CS5.5 had been insisting on being connected to the Net.  As soon as the new serial took, I used my paid firewall to block all further Net access for Adobe.

Those who have a problem:  Download CS5.5 directly from Adobe.  When download is complete, shut off your anti-virus and download here as the Adobe download is long.  When this download is done, create your serial in the keygen.  The reason you shut your anti-virus is that the keygen will seem like a Trojan and will be removed.  IT IS NOT A TROJAN.  Anyway, once you enter in the serial, you will get your green check and all will be fine.  Enjoy.  Thanks scene4all!    "

Got it to work!!. I downloaded the torrent on Mac OSX, placed on a thumb drive, then opened in Parallels on my Win 7 partition. Ran the keygen for mac Serial # and bingo. Before doing any of this though I HIGHLY recommend, for the more computer illiterate like myself, that you download a program for Mac called ""little snitch"". It gives you the ability to block ANY outgoing or incoming connection to your computer. I blocked any attempt by the adobe programs to connect to the internet. This was I don't have to mess with any root files. Probably sound like a total noob, but its what worked for me..... Hope I helped. "

Nevertheless there are only a few things that aren't working and I could really use someone's help here please.

I downloaded CS5.5, disconnected internet, tried to install and didn't work so i created the firewall as noted elsewhere for the file PDApp.exe (blocked) and then 1 of the other serial numbers someone posted worked, but none that were created by my keygen worked.    

Nevertheless got green check so I proceeded.  Then ran activation, then I connected internet and got virus for 64.exe which Norton deleted, so I allowed the activator file and re-run, seem to do the trick, no Norton warning popped up.  Wasn't sure if I was supposed to close program, but once I opened it would only do the same thing again.  Let me know if I did something wrong here or if I needed to do more please.  

I then started to open each program to test and was mostly successful. Below are the issues I am having and wondered if someone had the same and had a solution?  I saw the note on blocking all Adobe host files yet since I am novice I am not sure what they are to do so . I have Norton Security Suite so need to block firewall and anti-virus I am assuming to get these to work??????.

1. Once this is setup can I update without any issues, or should I never? 

2. Same with the sign-in, is that allowed or will it cause ""issues"" (i.e. Adobe Story and a few others ask for sign in to use program)?

3. Acrobat keeps failing says need re-install, so I am trying to do that now (internet off and will go through activation run again).  Flashbuilder, same issue fails to load says stops working Windows will close and let me know when resolution is found, so reinstalled both but not testing until i get answers to all these

4. Encore error and closes ""Adobe Encore CS5.1 cannot run in non-royalty serialized mode. The application needs to be serialized with a royalty bearing serial number."" How do I resolve?

5. Illustrator & InDesign both do the same thing; they open and then immediately close.  I finally caught the error message which states, "" is not properly licensed and will now quit.""

I tried to see if anyone stated a resolution and apologize if you did and I just didn't get what I need to do, so if anyone can help me here I would appreciate it very very much!  Thanks to everyone for all the notes and feedback it helped tremendously during the process and I am 80% done now and will be 100% once I get the above issues resolved, please help.  "

,Skepticat,2012-03-10T02:28Z,"@sweetvim,

I just ran this successfully on Win 7 x64, so I'll try to explain the process that worked for me, and I'll throw in some background info that might help you (and anyone else reading this) resolve your issues.

First of all, let me explain the setup process on a high level (because I think you might be over-complicating things).

1.  You go to Adobe, get the trial download, and proceed with the normal installation process.

2.  After you've downloaded the necessary shit (it's like 6 gigs or something), the installer asks for a serial number (or to indicate that you're only doing a 30 day trial--but we don't want this option, we want to give it a serial number). This is where you run the keygen and paste in the serial number it generates for you. The green check indicates that it's a valid number sequence--but it doesn't know whether or not that serial number has been used (that check is done during activation...which we will prevent from happening).

3.  After your selected programs are installed, you have yourself a fully-functional CS5.5 Master Edition...but as soon as you open one of the programs, it's going to connect to Adobe's activation server and verify your serial number. Then you're fucked. So you have to make sure Adobe's activation server is unreachable before you open any of your new programs.

4a.  The first method to block activation is to configure your computer's firewall so that it doesn't let Adobe make outbound connections. I personally didn't use this method, but it could work.

4b.  The second method to block activation is to edit the Windows hosts file so that Adobe thinks it's connecting to the activation server, but really it's connecting to your own computer--which is harmless. This is the method I used, and it's the method explained in this torrent's install.txt file. (When you run disable_activation.cmd, it edits the hosts file for you.)

4c.  The third method to block activation is to disconnect your computer from the internet. Not the most realistic method, but it is certainly the most foolproof. The first 2 methods are meant to block only Adobe's activation servers while keeping everything else connected.

5.  As long as Adobe can't reach it's activation server, your programs should continue to work like a fully licensed installation."
,Skepticat,2012-03-10T02:31Z,"(...continued from previous comment)

Now that we have that out of the way, let me explain a couple of gotchas/bugs that you should be aware of, especially if you are using the 4b method.



-- To edit the Windows hosts file, you need administrator privileges. Therefore, to run disable_activation.cmd successfully, you need to run it as an administrator. To do this, right-click on it and select ""Run as administrator"".

-- TIP: On Windows 7, the hosts file is located at C:WindowsSystem32driversetchosts

-- When I ran disable_activation.cmd, it DID NOT WORK properly, due to a minor bug/typo. Thankfully I caught it before opening any Adobe programs. The reason I was able to catch the error is because I opened the hosts file in Notepad and manually inspected it before and after running disable_activation.cmd. Here is my before/after snapshot:



BEFORE:

# several lines of comments

127.0.0.1       localhost127.0.0.1



AFTER (notice the missing line break between ""localhost"" and ""127.0.0.1""):

# several lines of comments

127.0.0.1       localhost127.0.0.1                   activate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1                   practivate.adobe.com



AFTER (fixed):

# several lines of comments

127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.0.1       activate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1       practivate.adobe.com



-- To edit the hosts file manually, you need to run Notepad with admin privileges--otherwise it won't save your changes. To accomplish this, click the Start Menu icon, type ""Notepad"" into the search box, right-click on the Notepad search result that appears, and select ""Run as administrator"". If UAC is enabled, it will ask to proceed--click yes. Once Notepad is open, open the hosts file, make changes if needed, and save. Again, that file is located at:

C:WindowsSystem32driversetchosts

,Skepticat,2012-03-10T02:40Z,"(...continued from previous comment)

Now, on to your questions...



Q:  Should I update?

A:  It is possible that Adobe will one day pull their head out of their ass and figure out how to patch this loophole. When they do, the only way to get that patch onto your computer is through an update. Therefore, every time you allow Adobe to update your software, you should be prepared to immediately roll back those changes if necessary. In other words, do a full backup before you update. After the update, check to make sure everything still works. (Or another strategy might be to wait a few weeks and check forums to see if anyone is bitching about the latest update killing their software.)



Q:  Same with the sign-in, is that allowed or will it cause ""issues"" (i.e. Adobe Story and a few others ask for sign in to use program)?

A:  I don't know. Just to be safe/paranoid, I created a new email account specifically for this purpose. It works perfectly, as far as I can tell.



Q:  Acrobat keeps failing says need re-install, so I am trying to do that now (internet off and will go through activation run again). Flashbuilder, same issue fails to load says stops working Windows will close and let me know when resolution is found, so reinstalled both but not testing until i get answers to all these

A:  Using method 4b, I didn't experience any of these issues. And judging by your other comment, it looks like you got this resolved. 



Q:  Encore error and closes ""Adobe Encore CS5.1 cannot run in non-royalty serialized mode. The application needs to be serialized with a royalty bearing serial number."" How do I resolve?

A:  I don't have this issue. Try editing your hosts file as explained above. It could be related to your keygen serials not working and the fact that you got your serial from somewhere else? Worst case...uninstall, reinstall with a different serial, edit hosts file, and you should be good to go.



Q:  Illustrator & InDesign both do the same thing; they open and then immediately close. I finally caught the error message which states, "" is not properly licensed and will now quit.""

A:  Again, I didn't experience this problem, so I'm not much help here. But my advice from previous question applies here too.

==============
SIDE NOTE
==============



If anyone is wondering why I just spent over an hour typing up this detailed explanation of how to crack Adobe Creative Suite 5.5 Master Collection, then here's your answer:

I paid over $1K for CS4 Master Collection (I was a student at the time). I'm not rich by any means, so this purchase was a huge decision--but ultimately, I decided it was worth it because I didn't want to deal with the risks that come with cracked software.

Since then, I have replaced/reformatted my hard drive and re-installed CS4 two different times (mind you, the installation is from the boxed set of DVDs that I paid full price for and still physically have in my possession). Unbeknownst to me, each time I re-installed the software, Adobe's activation server was tracking the number of installations and only allows a max of 2 installations. In order to install it a 3rd time, I was instructed to open the software on my ""other 2 computers"" and initiate the deactivation process.

Needless to say, it's kind of difficult to open my first 2 installations considering the fact that #1 was on a busted hard drive and #2 was overwritten when I reformatted. Consequently, Adobe refused to let me use my $1K software!

I searched adobe.com and found a number to call to speak to someone about activating my software. An automated voice system answers, tells me to hold for the next available associate, and then tells me the expected waiting time is ""more than 2 hours""!

It was at that point that I began researching how to crack Adobe's license/activation system. And the funny thing is...it took less than 2 hours.

So Adobe...if you're reading this: You need to get your shit together. For a retail price of $2,599...you better make sure your fuckin' software doesn't lock out paying customers. And if it does, you better make DAMN sure those paying customers don't have to wait more than 5 minutes to be let back in.

You brought this on yourselves, you fuckin' greedy pigs. You can eat my asshole for over two hours."

What can I say but THANK YOU!  You explained it perfectly to what it does or is supposed to do.  You are awesome, generous and gave me exactly what I asked of someone for help and sooo quickly and you took so much time that I truly appreciate your efforts and consideration.  

Sorry for the delay, been going through physical therapy from a major surgery and the last week or so was a tough one.  I am up tonight, can't sleep, so trying to get this done and working without much luck and I cannot figure out why it won’t work for me.  

I edited the host file like you said to do.  Silly question but do I put the # sign at the lead of each line, does it matter?

On the updates & email figured that was the answer. I also created a sort of fake email, as opposed to my regular one with them for my CS4 which I own and like you dropped a pretty penny(s) thinking it would be worth it, but the upgrade is asinine for the little I use these programs for my job.  I really use for minor editing or review of proofs and saving to other formats, etc. but utilized all the same. I paid initially thinking I would become a designer and was taking classes so I could get a ROI, but never did so won't pay the ridiculous amounts they want for upgrading, etc. on top of never getting a ROI.  

I too experienced the number of install limit and when I told them my computer crashed and I got a new laptop and was not able to get to those HDD deactivate, it took much efforts and pleading, but I finally got them to reset my activations. Sorry you didn't have luck, I guess I was luckier than I thought and they were able to see it was a different motherboard, and hdd I was trying to activate it with.  That is when I got totally creep-ed out that they captured all my system information and knew everything I was working with - did not like that! However, I then learned that if I just used a different motherboard and cloned the hdd to another brand I was able to get them to reset and they reset to zero, just a side note which may work for someone.  "
,sweetvim,2012-03-20T11:42Z,"continued...
Nonetheless, I APPRECIATE your time!!!! AND I totally agree with your comments on the subject as it applies to Adobe the amount of money they make for as little the product cost is absurd and makes no sense for the average user who is not a corporation or multiple license client, they really should have a different tier and that is why I went to this way of working as well, I felt they are taking advantage of all of us user who do not have thousands to spend on software.

Anyway, back to my results... I am stuck again.  I redid it all and followed instructions completely still same issue. I am restoring to new point, uninstalling (again) to try again with another torrent that has many lines of edit to the host file and see if that works.  Something is wrong and I wasn’t even connected to the internet and it said the serial was not valid so closing program now. I am new to this sort of thing, build my own PCs but am not sure what files I can block in my firewall, etc. to just block Adobe from wanting to check a serial number whether online or not and the host file is not working for me, so there must be something else and why for me it is different than you I have no clue, but I am a unique person which does not surprise me that I have this extra challenge as life seems to bring them my way.  Even so I always surpass the challenge and I will conquer this just the same.  At least I am learning a lot from it but do not want to uninstall and reinstall this anymore; it is so large and takes so long to do…

Total bummer, so any ideas???? Maybe I can do the firewall thing?  Does anyone know what files I need to block?  Or do I just block each programs exe file? Does anyone use Norton (I use 360) or manually blocked to have work for you?

Since even being disconnected from the internet caused this error I am stuck as I can’t create a PC just for this program and not be connected to the internet because even that didn’t work for me. Thanks again in advance for any tips you can give me so I do not waste anymore hours of this nor do I want to waste any of yours.  Am I the only one who has had this happen? I don't get why it’s not working; the instructions are fairly simple to follow. The only thing I did a month ago was try another torrent which had a “activator” which I do not know what it did and am thinking maybe that did something and the only thing I can do is wipe my hard drive clean and start over which would be a BIG BITCH and take more than a weekend to get all my programs installed, registered updated, etc. Help Please!

Thanks again @Skepticat"

#         Any other entries you had go here (new line no # no space);  

I installed CS 5 from thethingy and that modified my hosts file. When I just installed the CS5.5 (downloaded from Adobe) and used your key to activate it looked all jumbled with multiple entries on one line. I gave each entry a separate line but there are an awful lot of entries there now. Do I need to remove any of these that may be from the installation from Adobe???

Thanks"
