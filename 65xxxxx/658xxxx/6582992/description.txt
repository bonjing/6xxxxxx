Took way too long to find this disc. Helpless was one of the better tracks imo on the full release (cass tape only though). Was so disapointed they didn't include it on the original CD release. Wore through 2 cass tapes. I could never get a quality enough rip from cass tape.

So here ya go. Please enjoy and share.


VBR, Lame, higher quality. Sorry I forget the settings.


This is the mp3 offering, there is also a FLAC version.
