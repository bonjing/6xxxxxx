Plot summary:
For MÃ¥rtensson, the teacher, every new school day is sheer torture. He has long since lost control of the class. Though more or less resigned to his lot, he occasionally loses his temper and tries to gain respect through violence. But he knows that this is not the answer. His pupils sense his insecurity and torment him in their childish way. The pressure also begins to affect MÃ¥rtenssonâ€™s marriage. For a while, he finds solace with Ann-Marie, a teacher who possesses natural authority. When summer comes, MÃ¥rtensson tries in vain to make the children stay near the shore. He jumps into the water and swims after them. What begins as a game turns into catastrophe.In this film, Jan Troell draws upon his own experience as a teacher. As usual, he wrote the script in collaboration with producer Bengt Forslund. Clas EngstrÃ¶m, author of the 1957 novel on which it is based, was also involved in the scriptwriting. All three are former teachers.The film was shot at Troellâ€™s former school, the Sorgenfri School in MalmÃ¶, with â€œrealâ€ pupils and their parents, with a skeleton crew, minimal lighting and â€“ to heighten the authenticity â€“ an unobtrusive, mobile 16 mm camera.

Jan Troell was born in 1931 in Limhamn near MalmÃ¶ in the southern Swedish region of SkÃ¥ne. Many of his films are set in this landscape, where he worked as a teacher for nine years, while making his first short films and documentaries. Troellâ€™s international breakthrough came with his epic film version of Wilhelm Moberg's novel, â€œThe Emigrantsâ€ (1971) and â€œThe New Landâ€ (1972). Troell made his comeback as a director with his 1991 film â€œIl Capitanoâ€, a thriller about a couple on the run. In three other films Troell looks to the past.
