Been using AVS4You its to damn complicated for nOObs like myself. I am converting a BRRip 4.36 GiB from MKV to AVI so I can play with it in Vegas. I know alot ppl that say they will be back to comment. I will be telling how it worked out. (Gonna take awhile though)     "
,ljbew,2011-08-12T00:44Z,"Well Hell Like I said Im a nOOb It was 94% finished and I got a warning that I had low disc space :( so I had to cancel it after almost 8 hrs of trying. 
Is there a way to place it some where else besides Local disc C? "
