NBA Rules History (VIII):
-------------------------

Take a look back at some of the rules changes that have taken place over the years.
(Changes/clarifications implemented prior to season, except where noted) 
-------
1954-55
-------
- The 24-second shot clock is introduced.
- A penalty free throw is awarded following a teamâ€™s sixth foul in any quarter.
Both rules had to be adopted to make each one work. The time limit made in unnecessary for the trailing team to foul deliberately, since it would get the ball after 24 seconds. The foul limit made it too costly to foul to prevent a chance at a basket.
- The penalty for a backcourt foul became two shots â€“ three to make two if you are over the limit.
- Offensive fouls are treated as violations, no free throws and the defensive team gets possession. The foul would still count towards a playerâ€™s limit of six personal fouls.
