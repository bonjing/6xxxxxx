Elton John followed up his masterful 1972 album HONKY CHATEAU with a record that was far more ambitious in scope. The result was 1973's sprawling GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD, a record that mixed genres and sounds with ease and spawned hit singles such as "Bennie and the Jets," "Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting," and "Candle in the Wind." This episode of the CLASSIC ALBUMS series uses interviews with Sir Elton and his songwriting partner Bernie Taupin, archival footage of the demo sessions, and rare live performances to tell the story behind the canonical album.
