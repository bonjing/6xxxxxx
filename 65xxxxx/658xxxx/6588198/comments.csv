Extract all the .ZIP files to the same folder.  you should end up with one folder containing 27 .RAR files forming a spanned set. 
extract the first file (*.r00) and all the images will be extracted from the spanned set.
Then you can delete your ZIP and RAR files.

She's cute, and it's a nice upload. Spanned RAR files I get for folks with bad bandwidth or maybe on dial up, but I can't fathom why anyone would zip the rar files."

he thought .RAR was for splitting only
and .ZIP was for compacting only"
