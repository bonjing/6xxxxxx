,indiaman,2011-08-04T05:43Z,"Dohduhdah,dear friend,any news on ""Electric Circuit Analysis(Engineering) by MathTutorDVD""?"
[V],dohduhdah,2011-08-04T09:21Z,Patience indiaman.. I have no idea if or when that math tutor course will be available online on one of my favorite torrent sites.
,gakjelasbgt,2011-08-04T19:00Z,"thanks for your great TTC stuff, i think we're all really grateful for your effort in sharing them.."
,rododododo,2011-08-04T22:10Z,"thaks for answering and thereÂ´s no problem, i am not even close to watch all ttcÂ´s that you have shared here."
,xplorsonu,2011-08-05T21:01Z,"this looks like a very intriguing course by the title and more interesting due to 86 leechers and n0 seeders...hehe. Thankfully, I came to know that there's a course on Engineering circuits by mathtutor through the comments on this page. However I wanted to say that there are courses on Electric circuit theory/analysis on youtube by MIT and IIT. Keep up the good work Niek Sir, I will be back on this page after a few months again. :-) Good day

Below are the youtube links I was talking about.Thanks
