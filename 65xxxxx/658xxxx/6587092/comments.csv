,luxlucis,2011-08-14T07:17Z,I just came across the author's website.  I knew this was a ripoff.  There is nothing in this book you can't find somewhere else.  
,CyrustheVirus1,2011-08-14T13:38Z,Exactly luxlucis the nerve of some people charging that amount of money fair enough it does contain a fair amount of knowledge but that can easily be obtained for free... So I thought Id share this for all who would even consider buying it :O
