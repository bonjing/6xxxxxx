Eminem - 3 a.m. - Masonic Ritual Killing (2009)

Eminem 3 A.M: Mass Satanic Sacrifice Ritual at the Masonic Temple/hospital mocking the holy trinity, the devilâ€™s hour. 

The song itself has importance, read here about 3 A.M. The lyrics fit exactly with the song: About Eminem working with demons at 3 A.M in an altered state, going on a mass killing spree in the hospital and masonic temple, however he does not remember or recollect the memory, "I donâ€™t remember how they got there, but I guess I must have killed them." Complete with a blood bath ritual, and particular references, all relevant to Monarch programmed slaves. Proof was sacrificed on the 11th as a blood sacrifice, and after checking himself into Rehab/Reprogramming, he came back with this hit single.

Magazine featuring Monarch programmed slaves: http://www.dazeddigital.com/ - The movie 'Zoolander' also hints at this phenomenon. Fashion magazines are very important for the creation of role models and social engineering.

comment: You should watch the Eminem video once with the sound track and once without any sound to better focus your mind on the visual and symbolic aspects of the film. This torrent is of particular importance if you want to understand what may have happened in Oslo. Eminem is doing here what Breivik has done, and both of them may be Monarch slaves. What has happened in Norway may have been a masonic blood ritual - and Breivik is a mason "they" said. But of course it was a "lone nut" as usual - what else. The child-like public shouldn't be burdened too much with truth - and most of them aren't even interested in truth anyway. They don't want their cozy little paradigm be broken up by the ugly truth. If you want to protect your quality of life with the help of self-deception then you will end up losing everything.
