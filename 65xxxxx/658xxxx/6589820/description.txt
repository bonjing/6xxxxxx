Subsequence is quite simply, a beautiful trance album that came out of nowhere during C79. Hopefully making this torrent will increase the popularity of this album, and build support for Curled-Coil to create more great trance music.

The track "5 in threes" is so dang eclectic and peaceful, it's one of those tracks that can just let you flip off your brain and relax. Really reminds me of something MAYA AKAI would make. "more power to you" is pretty nice too, sampling the only line that matters from Hixxy's "More and More". 

While not god-tier, the album is a sure-step ahead of the rest of the crap floating across the rancid seas of modern music.

Enjoy.
