you need Winrar to unzip the files. 
you can download that for free. Once unzipped you have a .avi file ready to play. "

,vossmann,2011-10-05T17:07Z,Excellent stuff sceneline- thanks.
,Podgkin,2011-10-27T12:31Z,"FFS!
The reason so many peeps are having difficulty playing this and audio sync issues, as it's actually a fkin MKV file!? :o(
Why do they keep using this format - it's no better, for us normal folk.
Thanks for the upload, anyway.

The FREE VLC media player...fixes most issues."
