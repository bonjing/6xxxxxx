        More speed and increased security!

        Over 13 years of experience in system maintenance and
        optimization of operating systems by MicrosoftÂ® stand for modern
        technology, efficiency, security as well as intuitive user
        guidance. 

        Over 100 improvements were incorporated into the new Ashampoo
        WinOptimizer 8 by contrast to its predecessor Ashampoo
        WinOptimizer 7. This results in more speed and therefore improved
        efficiency especially within system maintenance and the
        adjustment of WindowsÂ®. The cleaning modules registry optimizer,
        Internet cleaner and drive cleaner , for example, reach a plus of
        up to 500% in results. 

        In real time the new live tuner pools all available resources in
        exactly those places where they are urgently needed. Existing
        processor cores, WindowsÂ® priorities and assigned usages of
        applications are customized, in order to ensure a trouble-free
        workflow. The resource-saving live tuner runs in the background â€“
        just a mouse click away. 

        Itâ€™s so easy to tune WindowsÂ®! Just answer a few special
        questions about your personal requirements concerning your
        WindowsÂ® system and our tuning assistant will automatically
        choose all suitable options. 

        The concept of the all-in-one user interface has been developed
        further for the Ashampoo WinOptimizer 8. Via the clearly
        structured main window you can immediately access all six
        function groups, in which over 20 modules with hundreds of
        options and functions are assembled.
