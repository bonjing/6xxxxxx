@sarsapil don't talk about something you have no idea. People who are trying to learn Islam with open mind most of them are already converting to it.Maybe it's time for you also to think. "
,twoeggedanimal,2011-08-14T22:45Z,"@sarsapil: One shouldn't talk about something that is beyond his comprehension. After all, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, isn't it?"
,Proper_Acid,2011-10-31T20:36Z,Islam is the truth brothers!
,MissRedRose,2012-01-06T00:27Z,"Someone who dares compare Islam to Buddhism knowing the great differences between them is the most illiterate. my dear if your IQ is hitting the gauge then tell me what do you worship? a low-life being that is obviously inferior to us humans such as a cow or any other animal? or do you worship a human who has been proven to be inferior by being killed? or maybe you worship a stone statue that you created your self, by that you become his creator, so he should be the one worshiping you logically. The one who created all humans, animals and the whole world must be the superior of all, and that is the one and only Allah. and by the way the file wasn't posted to hear out your good-for-nothing comment, it was meant for muslims who seek it. like-wise you upload whatever filth you want and nobody talked about it. you can keep your mouth shut and lock your opinion to yourself you feel like, you aren't going to be rewarded for your opinion ""sarsapil"" or whatever your name is.



Thanks for the upload bro. May Allah bless you inshalla"
