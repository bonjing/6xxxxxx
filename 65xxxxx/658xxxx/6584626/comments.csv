,cschrille1,2011-08-05T15:43Z,Not fake. But the map is same as DR sim 09. I think it is different map in 2011 but i dont know. It works eitherway but might be modded 2009 version.
,PotloodDutch,2011-08-05T16:49Z,It has the same map as '09 but '11 has a extra city.

,David1544,2011-08-11T02:54Z,"Hi, I am running Windows 7 64-bit, and for some reason everytime I start the game it freezes on me, I have everything that needed to be installed, installed."
,PiratWizard,2011-08-11T10:32Z,"@David1544

Try theese methods thats below, if that doesnt works i got no idea.

a ) Run the game as administrator
b ) Reinstall the game and BE SURE of what u are doing. NOTE : Be sure that ur installing on a place where its enough space.

c ) If its still freezing , u will need to try get help using Google."
,PotloodDutch,2011-08-11T16:45Z,"@PiratWizard

I made a mistake. There's no indicator sound. DS 09 has also no indicator sound."
,PiratWizard,2011-08-11T17:29Z,"@PotLoodDutch

Thats true..Okey.. What can we do so the indicator sound works then? Reupload AGAIN or what? xD"
,PotloodDutch,2011-08-12T22:52Z,"@PiratWizard

No I don't reupload again. I've bought this game so.. or it is a bug in the CD or it is not a bug.

I have no other solutions.. sorry."
,PiratWizard,2011-08-13T13:19Z,"Okey.
