,Bondshead,2011-08-03T18:23Z,"SPRUNK provided the audio. It doesn't mean that this too will be out of sync. 

Froggie - Is this out of sync? I'm dl'ing now but after 25 minutes only at 13% due to no seeders. I will def seed when done."

Well its the right audio and its there but the quality is far from good and also its out of sync. So much out of sync that it makes this movie unwatchable.
Also isn't AC3 supposed to be more than 2 channel audio? AC3 = dolby = surround sound this is just stereo.

Video Quality is fine

Might be a good movie, but its hard to watch a comedy when audio is out of sync.. so unwatched."
