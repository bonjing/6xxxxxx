Sounds WAY less than 192kbps. I'm guessing he downloaded it from a 360p YouTube video and re-encoded it. I'm going to extract it from the Redbull website. MUCH better quality there. (not perfect but more acceptable than this crap)

The human ear cant distinguish any quality difference from 192kbps and 320kbps.  Infact anything above 192kbps just takes up more space.  It is absolutely useless unless you are editing/mixing music"

It is true that many people cannot discern the difference between 192kbps and 320kbps. I am one of those that CAN, and ESPECIALLY in post-hardcore songs. Minor artifact, like the fuzziness in a JPEG image, stands out like a sore thumb to me. Even in a 320kbps MP3 I can hear it. Only on a CD or an uncompressed rip from a CD is perfect. 

If you were listening to, say, a rap or pop song, 192kbps would be MORE than sufficient because there are not very many layers of audio. But for this genre, you're talking about 3-6 vocal tracks, several layers of guitars, and constant live drums with prominent hi-hats. 256kbps is the minimum for this to sound okay to me. 320kbps is the ideal bitrate."
