avast! Internet Security provides complete antivirus, anti-spyware, antispam, and firewall protection, complemented now by new avast! SafeZone technology. It creates an isolated virtual desktop, invisible to any possible attacker, where you can do your online shopping and banking securely. avast! SafeZone opens a new (clean) desktop so that other programs donâ€™t see whatâ€™s happening â€“ and it leaves no history once itâ€™s closed. Our award-winning and certified antivirus engine and shields stop even previously unknown threats â€“ for peace of mind when you chat or spend time on Facebook, Twitter, or other websites. Our silent firewall stops hackers and other unauthorized entry attempts to your PC, to keep your data where it belongs â€“ safe and sound. Internet Securityâ€™s antispam feature blocks both spam and sophisticated â€œphishingâ€ attempts, to keep you from clicking â€œharmlessâ€ links that really can cause damage. avast! has been proven again for its great scanning speed.
