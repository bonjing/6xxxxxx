CINAVIA Warning for any PS3 users:
This movie completely cuts off when watching on PS3"
,gambit18,2011-08-04T04:34Z,nice ups EZ..can i add u in Facebook?
,jb59,2011-08-04T06:07Z,"awesome bro.....!!!!!!
dude please upload fast 5.....soon......"
,Teachem,2011-08-04T06:49Z,"I enjoy most of these uploads, but have to take exception to this one. The laughs are thin and vulgar, poor writing for great actors. It does demonstrate how far we've fallen as a culture.
V9.6, A9 ... not complaining for free, just saying."
[V],extremezone,2011-08-04T07:29Z,"@Teachem totally agree with you, i don't even bother to watch most of recent hollywood bad movies, long live the classic period 1970-2000 fine movies (Goodfellas,usual suspects,serpico,etc)"
,3olaH,2011-08-04T11:03Z,thanks extreme..

,doude422,2011-08-04T14:07Z,right on extremezone 70's to 2000 movies where the best now almost all teh movies these days are cheap budget poor acting
,ramikaz,2011-08-04T14:47Z,Thanks goes to all the great uploaders and TPB who prevent us from wasting money on movies like this steaming pile.  There are enough suckers out there to keep these Hollywood a-holes rich.
,Hawko_1985,2011-08-04T16:12Z,"First of all thanks extreme zone,you always have the best quality most reliable torrents,however iv'e noticed over the last few months when I'm watching a movie on my PS3 i get a message saying ""protected by cinavia blah blah....does not allow playback on this device""? why would someone rip a movie,and then specifically target ""pirates"" to code this useless cinavia.....it's pointless...and really annoying....can anyone help with how to get around it? I'm not blaming you EZ just asking why."
[V],extremezone,2011-08-04T16:41Z,"@Hawko_1985 i'm aware about cinavia but i don't have a ps3 to know much about it, try using google or something (i know it's not encoders fault-maybe movie or device production companies)"
,s0m30ne,2011-08-04T16:49Z,Any english subs available for this release?
,jonesz10,2011-08-04T17:09Z,"Great torrent thanks!!!

Can anyone recommend a good copy of THOR or Pirates of the Caribbean 4?  Cheers"

,ptl_base,2011-08-04T22:24Z,@Hawko_1985 I've had the same issue with Cinavia on PS3. Its a playstation thing to cut back on pirating of bluerays. The best solution I found to work around this is that I just stream them onto my Xbox 360 instead. Xbox also streams better anyway with little to no lagging unlike PS3 and you do not have to spend 10-15 mins copying the files off your computer to your PS to avoid the lagging issue.
,TyMod,2011-08-05T06:30Z,http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5821849/Aimersoft_Video_Converter_Ultimate_4.0.2_drm_remover This will get rid of Cinavia.  If it doesn't then search for other Video Converters. There are PLENTY of them that will let you get rid of Cinavia.
,lohu,2011-08-05T08:19Z,Thank you! 
[T],TUXtorrent,2011-08-05T09:48Z,"CHEERS TyMod HOPEFULLY THIS REMOVER THAT VRAP SO I CAN PLAY THIS ON MY PS3 threw my hard drive . will let you know it it removes cinavia for me .

other hand a10 v10 great up cheers extremezone you never seem to fail with your ups . keep them up boss!!!"
,nozzanil,2011-08-05T11:52Z,please seed... so slow...
,kmc1979,2011-08-05T14:35Z,If your streaming on ps3 i found that putlocker is brilliant. Most streaming sites have this player and it doesn't lag at all... or you cud split the movie in two and watch a film between megavideo and 2gb hosting..
,kmc1979,2011-08-05T14:43Z,"Just started downloading.. eta 34 minutes.. cheers extremezone, much appreciated!!!"
,MOSOBOH,2011-08-05T19:04Z,Extremzone: is there any way we can find english subs for this movie... tried looking everywhere and cant find... please help! Cheers m8

,Goldfire1986,2011-08-08T04:46Z,"@TyMod, thanks for the suggestion but that converter didn't work in removing Cinavia. Most probably because it doesn't know the exact frequency that Cinavia is using."
