NBA Rules History (VI):
-----------------------

Take a look back at some of the rules changes that have taken place over the years.
(Changes/clarifications implemented prior to season, except where noted) 
-------
1952-53
-------
- The late-game free-throw rule (see 1950-51) now required the jump ball to take place between the man who is fouled and the player who is guarding him.
(To eliminate the advantages of having a tall-man foul a short-man.)
