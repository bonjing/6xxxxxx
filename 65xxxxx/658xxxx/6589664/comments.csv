,bobbysg,2011-08-08T08:21Z,Why the odd file size?
,atheeshkr,2011-08-08T08:31Z,"looks like a fake
in nfo the file size is 700 mb but in torrent info it is 428.68 mb"
,eremy,2011-08-18T16:29Z,totally not fake. AV 10/10
,muviepsyco,2011-08-21T02:37Z,it may be in mkv or mp4 format that is why its file size is within 500mb....its ok....
,tempuser531,2011-09-07T05:09Z,"Well, if it sounds too good to be true...it is. This is a completely bogus torrent. Other commenters have pointed out the file size discrepancies.

It downloads to 99.6% very quickly, but never finishes. There are a lot of peers supposedly seeding with 100% of the file, but it won't ever finish.

I tried to analyze the partial file with themonospot, and it doesn't seem to be a valid AVI video.

Extremely disappointing because this is a small, independent film that's only showing in three cities. I have no other way to see this movie."
,ayleycat,2011-09-21T00:56Z,there is nothing wrong with this film. i d/l in 5 mins. it's an avi. runtime is 1:32:21 mins and bone always gives us his best. a/10  v/10
,stormy1,2012-02-28T23:18Z,Bone is the best! How dare you even doubt him! Thank you bone for all your hard work.
