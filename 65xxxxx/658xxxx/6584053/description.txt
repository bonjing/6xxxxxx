Its about 4 Minutes long and its almost half a damn Gig, you do the math on that one, all i can say is this, when i show people that think my phone is a gimmick they usually start with saying "wow" and then soon after  "daaaaaaaam...."  and typically i have to ask for the phone back and with this avatar clip i have to physically reclaim our wonderful phone/awe-inspirer. 


its in english
(es en ingles)

Please refer to this guide for an easy method of increasing the volume on the EVO3D to 200% roughly of the original volume !!!

Just remember if you try to make your own videos dont make a file over 4G, that's the max file size transfer for the EVO3D, that is, until some awesome nerd figures a way around it. 

ENJOY!!

Typical Comments in person include "Hoooooly Shiiiiiit"  and "lemmme watch another one, come on man"
