But the audio seems out of sync in the later part. Hope the full video doesn't have such issues. Keep sharing."

cant comment on video or audio but I'am totally shitting in my pants while waiting for all of these downloads from 1983. hat off to ya for stepping up on the HTC EVO 3D. had my phone for about a month and there is like no support or products out there for it. It's like christmass everyday. PS already have a SDHC 10 class 10 card in my phone begging for files."
,CaptainSpackle,2011-08-18T10:49Z,"A:7  obvious as stated before 
V:9 looks great but why the double image?

Hope you or some one reads this to help me out. FYI Watching this on my EVO 3D having problems. will try to move file from my Gallery to Watch movie APP. To see if this resolves the double image. ( i know that is the format just thought it should be 0ne image putting the two halves together) "
