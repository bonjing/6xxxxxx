,MaverickM6,2011-08-13T00:57Z,Thx for the Upload but am noticing its very grainy on my 42'' T.v so why is that?
,jay12345ist,2011-08-20T06:43Z,"@MaverickM6 
this is because it was filmed with a film camera instead of digital seing the grain means you have a good tv but if you want it off just turn up noise reduction on tv"
