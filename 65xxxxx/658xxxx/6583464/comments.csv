,RitchieRich,2011-08-08T01:29Z,"@nofil

You are more than welcome to update to CS5.5 and if you have and issues just use one of the serials from my torrent. "
,Simg,2011-08-09T19:05Z,Hi RitchieRich I used your previous activation blocker and serial number download on CS5.5 and all was good until I updated some of the software. Then the serial number was invalid I found an up to date number but it would seem the previous activation blocker has failed and I have to keep little snitch running. If I  uninstall everything and use the new blocker and serials will I still be able to update the software without having to run little snitch all the time. And is this all compatible with Lion if I want to go down the new OSX route. Thanks in advance for your reply and all your hard work. Simg
,RitchieRich,2011-08-09T20:19Z,"@Simg

Yes, the new activation blocker adds new servers to the list that will help keep Adobe CS5.5 from calling home. Also, the new serials will work with CS5.5 as my other torrents for CS5 serials won't work."
,Simg,2011-08-09T21:03Z,"@RitchieRich
Many thanks, is it also cool to upgrade to Lion and use this blocker etc? Again thanks in advance, Simg"
,RitchieRich,2011-08-11T04:05Z,"@Simg

Yes, everything will work on Lion. I currently have Lion installed and haven't had any problems. "

If problem need to install unplugged to internet, and also modify the hosts file and reboot before you enter the serials so it will work when internet is plugged in.

- i have already downloaded photoshop and dreamweaver from another torrent, so would i delete these completely in order to follow your instructions?

- For some reason, when i tried downloading illustrator cs5 from another torrent but using same method as yours, when i opened the application the window to enter a serial never came up. What would i do here?

I am on lion 10.7.2. Please can you advise me. I would rather juts download the master collection if it is easier. 

Please pleaseeee repsond.

,RitchieRich,2011-11-13T02:20Z,"@TehMagic

Thank you very much for the kind words. :)

@ukg273

Yes, you can download the Master Collection. Make sure you see what version you download. If you download CS5 or CS5.5 you will need to pick one of my torrents that go with the version. More than likely when you downloaded Illustrator it just used the serial from your other Adobe install. What ever decision you decide just make sure you run the blocking script then install the software as a trial.
