Sorry I don't know."
,Wokrakken,2011-08-06T09:45Z,"Animeman1000,

Dual means it has two of something.
Both part 1 and part 2 have English AND Japanese audio. You can change between depending on which you prefer.

If you use VLC player, just right-click on the video and select it under the audio section."
