You said we may make requests.  I noticed you had some harder-to-find Christmas movies and I was wondering if you had a movie called ""Christmas Eve"" from 1986. I believe it also went by the name ""Christmas Dove"". It starred Loretta Young.

Here's the IMDB link:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090838/

Thank you again for this upload."
