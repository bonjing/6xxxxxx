[W4F PRESENTS]: Foreign.Correspondent.2011.08.02.Paper.Tiger.WS.PDTV.XviD-W4F

 
[RELEASE DATE]: 2011/08/06

 
[GENRE.......]: Documentary/Investigative

 
[DESCRIPTION.]:
Two scenes from candid cameras tell a troubling story. In one,
wild and gravely endangered Sumatran tiger cubs cavort in
their forest home. In the next, a bulldozer ploughs through
frame. Not far from these hidden lenses are some the worlds
biggest paper producers and serious questions are being
asked about their impact on remote, delicate ecosystems. And
as Australia wrestles with its carbon future why are some of
our biggest retailers stocking tonnes of office paper produced
by the worlds largest paper plant under some of the worlds
biggest greenhouse plumes?
