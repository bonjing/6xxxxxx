Pre-Independence India, on the cusp of freedom;  
suspicion, pent-up ire, religious fervor fills   
the air... and then the unthinkable happens...   
a dead pig is found at the foot steps of a       
mosque in Jalalabad, propelling a frenzy of      
violence that engulfs scores of Hindu, Muslim &  
Sikh lives in its ravages flames.                
In spite of the best efforts of the well meaning 
from the warring communities to salvage the      
situation, the spark soon morphs into a huge,    
wild fire that claws into the fragile communal   
situation. Bestiality prevails as man slays man  
with all the brutality in him.                   
Tamas, throws light on how communal prejudice    
can scar generations of lives throwing them into 
a bottomless abyss of physical and psychological 
agony recovery from which is slow and excruciatin
