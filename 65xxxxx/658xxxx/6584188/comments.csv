,bamakoko,2011-08-05T18:58Z,"Can someone (or the uploader directly) upload this to a direct download website? The torrent protocol is forbidden for me at work :/

thx in advance!"
,bamakoko,2011-08-06T09:05Z,"I didn't know this website, thx a lot! Once I had access to the forums, a user named Rick Astley helped me with my problem. I asked for the next releases of keys by ChattChitto and he promised to never give me up. :-)"
,lenky,2011-08-06T15:31Z,"thx CC, much appreciated!"
[V],ChattChitto,2011-08-06T19:05Z,"meats is not our site and we have nothing to do with it. its most probably a spam site.
our Site is known and it can be found inside each of our releases. [ChattChitto com]"

,Tatletz,2011-08-10T10:02Z,"Hi CC, thank you for the great work!
Do you think you could start uploading keys for KIS 2012?"
,eijiro,2011-08-10T14:42Z,"Hi, I'm new here. Could you help me understand how to use these keys? I need to download the trial first then use these keys to activate? Thanks!"
,manoj_alhan,2011-08-10T18:25Z,i think probably chattchitto should take req for email ids as these keys doesn't help anyone as they are blocked by kaspersky.Consider this as a request.
,repeat123,2011-08-11T15:38Z,All blocked sadly.
