              Dito, a writer in L.A., goes home to Astoria, Queens, 
              after a 15-year absence when his mother calls to say 
              his father's ill. In a series of flashbacks we see the 
              young Dito, his parents, his four closest friends, and 
              his girl Laurie, as each tries to navigate family, race, 
              loyalty, sex, coming of age, violence, and wanting out. 
              A ball falls onto the subway tracks at a station, small 
              things get out of hand. Can Dito go home again?
