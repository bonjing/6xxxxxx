"
[V],.Dude.,2011-08-07T22:25Z,"It works,m using it for months now..
Just follow the instructions properly during installation :)"
,spikeoscar,2011-08-08T13:24Z,don't work.
[V],.Dude.,2011-08-08T13:34Z,Did u read the what was in the instructions file?
[V],.Dude.,2011-08-08T14:34Z,"Sry.. ther's a little change in the installation instructions than the once inside the file.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1.Install WindowBlinds7 from WindowBlinds7_public.exe  ( http://www.stardock.com/products/windowblinds/ )

2.Run a theme of your choice

3.After close WindowBlinds.

4.Copy and paste all the contents from the crack folder to the installation folder.

5.Now run the file Crack WindowBlinds7.2 By ExĂÂľs as admin in the installation folder itself.

6.Now Open WindowBlinds 7 and enjoy.

7.After 29 days(or whenever you want) just uninstall the program,restart your pc and then reinstall the program and then run the trial reset once,now re-run the crack inside the installation directory and you get another 30 days. :)

This is more efficient than the schedule trial reset.

Note:

30 days remaining will still appear when you restart your pc

But it will not expire."
,Seragon,2011-08-09T22:01Z,Says 30 days remaining but will not expire... So why have we gotta uninstall it & reinstall it every month????
[V],.Dude.,2011-08-10T12:53Z,"@Seragon,y take a risk.. :)"
,MaTiSrAw,2011-08-15T20:14Z,will this work if my windowblinds has already expired?
[V],.Dude.,2011-08-16T05:10Z,"I think yes,but uninstall it using your uninstaller or the uninstaller within this.
then restart your pc once."
,MaTiSrAw,2011-08-17T19:55Z,well i mean i cant do your directions. Because i cant apply a theme since my windowblinds has already expired.
,venu1984,2011-08-21T15:32Z,"Great work Dude ( n' smooches in Air) I have been waiting for crack for years and I eventually got a working crack

,SnapplerX,2011-08-31T07:04Z,"my windowblinds never works. every time i uninstall/reinstall and apply a theme, i get windows classic and it always f*cks up my computer.
It also always says that it was not installed correctly every time no matter what i do. i reboot a billion times, i try clicking the fix button. Nothing works. Anyone have any ideas?"
,mite_jan,2011-09-01T01:49Z,"LOL SnapplerX
what happened with your trial reseter ?

i've been using that trial resseter you have provided (happy themming couple of months) and i have exactly the same problem like you now... no matter what version i install it says always blinds is not installed corectly
maybe windows 7 SP1 is the problem or maybe we F****d it up with those trial resseters and everything :)

i am still waiting for a real proper crack (for that i will gladly reinstall windows but till then i won't touch it)"
,Kirbichu,2011-09-01T23:52Z,"Apparently this version of the trial just doesn't work anymore. There's an updated version at Stardock's website, but I don't know if the crack and reseter still work with this."
,SnapplerX,2011-09-03T03:30Z,"@mite_jan

I don't even know what happened with my trial reset. I stopped using WB for a couple of months and when i tried it again, it just totally F*cked up my entire desktop.

So, i went to my torrent, and sure enough, people were saying that theirs stopped working too.

So, I don't really know what happened and I would appreciate if anyone knew how to fix it :) thanks."
,SnapplerX,2011-09-04T22:29Z,"for those of you who are having this problem:

When you run/install/reinstall windowblinds it always says that it is not installed correctly and when you apply any theme, it either only applies windows classic or it F*cks up your desktop

Heres the solution: Yes I have finally found it after like 3 years of trying and failing and it is so simple

All you have to do is uninstall windowblinds -> then install windowblinds 6.2 ( i found the installer on ChattChitto's old WB crack http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4928799/WindowBlinds_Enhanced_v6.2___101_Themes___Patch_By_ChattChitto ) and it will tell you that t is no longer supported or something. Then you uninstall that and install windowblinds 7 and it works!! make sure to reboot and do all that good stuff. 

Hope this helps, I know it helped me."
,Mun60,2011-09-10T18:45Z,"A very thank you to the uploader.

@ SnapplerX you save my life I had the same problem with windowblinds for ages, and couldn't solve the 

problem untill i reade your comemnts it work perfect.

In reference to the crack i still getting the countdown window, maybe because I didn't apply 

the crack before I reboot my computer as per instruction. Will see in the future if that wos 

the problem.

I Have some good news the ((Trial Reset)) still working. Run It In Safe Mode As Administrator. 

Wait a few seconds, it will flicker The Reset Windows For About Two Times.


General Note:

Those WindowBlinds Programers are very good in disabling cracks for there application sow its
important to block all of it components, from connecting to there server.

I Personally Block These component:

sevenconfig
wbconfig
wbload
Activate


Need Help Maybe Someone Can Help:

For some Reason WindowBlinds Explorer Backgounds Will Not Work In Window Vista 64 Bit.

Is This A Vista Problem. I Will Google It In The Future. But The Pirate Bay Have Very Good 
Help On all Issues.


Thanks In Advance."
