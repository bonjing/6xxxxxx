	NOTES:
	
	Unlike the old pres by SYS I chose to IVTC even though
	source is hybrid. About 4.30 of total runtime should 
	not have IVTC applied, but leaving dupe frames for the 
	remaining 16+ minutes felt wrong. The two short sketches
	were low motion so the missing frames doesn't hurt too 
	much. 
	
	INFO:
	
	MINDTHEGAP is living up to its groupname. We do mind all
	the gaps in archives out there. If we see a rerun airing
	of unreleased eps from series we try to get it. If the
	show is really old and the hope of finding the original
	release is gone, we try to fix that too with iNTERNALs. 
	
	This of course makes our releases a bit random and some
	might think we are mad but there will be a reason behind
	the madness.
