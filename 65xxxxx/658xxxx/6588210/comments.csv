P.P.S : how bout u seed uploader?"
,Naroon,2011-08-07T13:09Z,"I have the original CD somewhere in my home. It sure is a great game :-)

Hoping for seeding from the uploader thou..."
,FORUFOEN,2011-08-08T19:40Z,"VERY sorry, forgot to press ""play"" button in torrent (i'm releasing not often)
also, can't seed all day, hope for your help (if you like and have no problems, of course)

P.S. did pack by myself, i'll try to answer questions next login here (though may be never :D)

P.P.S. if you really like this, no need spend time for finding something same (i did it already :) )
only perfect (yep, really perfect) thing is old """"X-Com Apocalypse""""  (of course, don't forget to find new mods)
no realtime remakes which can be near Apocalypse and no turn-based near 1st version of game (in this torrent)
only ""X-Com"" bookmark i left after long search - Xenonauts"
,FORUFOEN,2011-08-09T17:52Z,"SORRY PEOPLE, XComUtil options ruin game :(
Never can suppose that, lots of problems with research, laser weapons and hardness
Seems, all should be repacked without xcomutil but with better weapon mod"
,FORUFOEN,2011-08-09T17:52Z,"P.S. Don't seed, please :("

Lately I've been playing UFO: Afterlight (2009) which is also a decent version."
