William S. Burroughs & Robert Gale - The Book of Breeething
 
http://www.amazon.com/book-breeething-William-S-Burroughs/dp/0912652276

Here's a real gem for any Burroughs fan. A short essay on Hieroglyphs, Hassan I Sabbah, Curses and State-coups, congenially illustrated by Robert Gale. It\'s a collectors Item too - lowest second-hand prices start at roughly 200$ (!)

This is a scan of Berkeley Blue Wind Press' edition from 1975; "an edition of 250 hardbound copies without dust jacket as issued. This edition was published with an extra â€˜eâ€™ as The Book of Breeething as were subsequent Blue Wind Press editions of this work."

Review from http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/257571.The_Book_of_Breeething:
"The illustrations push this to a new level. Burroughs explores Egyptian hieroglyphics, Hassan i Sabbah, The Curse of King Tut, etc. It all ties together: visionary, magikal (&, yes, my spelling is deliberate). It's as if Burroughs achieved a highly disciplined penetrating vision & locked it in place. Gale's images are just as great IF NOT BETTER. The 2 together are amazing."
