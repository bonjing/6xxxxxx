,zyzykwy,2011-08-06T07:45Z,"seed it, and don't move the files from where the torrent prog is uploading them from."
,nickie1801,2011-08-07T12:27Z,"it is not seeding yet. i think you should put the folders that you want to share, in the folder where your downloads are normally saved. After that just download this torrent the same way you download other torrents.  So it works in my torrent program"
