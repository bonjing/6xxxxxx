Port Citizen are (probably were) and independent band from Charlottetown, PE. The band was formed in 1999 by three ex-members of Supercar: Brodie Read, Jonathan Holmes, and Peter MacDonald. Additional percussion on the album was added by Mike MacDougall. All lyrics and music are by the band, except for a cover of "Money in My Pocket" by Dennis Brown. RÃ©alisateur was James Carrier.

Â¿Por QuÃ© No?, the band`s debut (and possibly only) album was recorded at Studio Baobab in Mont-Carmel, Prince Edward Island; there is no copyright date, a practice usually seen with Quebec music labels. The catalogue number was WRC8-7559. If anyone knows what company uses WRC8, leave a comment.

The only information I`ve been able to find online is from a page on KickInTheHead.com that was last updated 31 May 2002. The band`s official site, www.portcitizen.com, produces a "Server not found" error.

Additional percussion was added by Mike MacDougall.
