It seems compilation packs are all the rage these days, and now Sony has tossed their hat into the ring with God of War Collection. Collection includes God of War and God of War II, both of which play identical to their PS2 brethren, but now with high-definition support and trophies. In celebration of Sony releasing these classics, we've compiled both of our guides into one super-guide, ideal for aspiring gods.
