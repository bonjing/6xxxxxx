,Lyrian,2011-08-05T11:48Z,Is this Pc version or playstation emulator?
,Netarangi,2011-08-05T12:32Z,Obviously PS emulator.
[T],musy2,2011-08-05T16:13Z,play station emulator.....graphics not seems like it
,dumas1000,2011-08-05T21:50Z,"There is not PC version. I am not convinced that these games are truly playable using the Ps2 emulator, even with a high-end computer. In my opinion, a 60fps s2 game must obtain at least 40fps through emulation to actually be playable. Most Ps2 games run at somewhere between 20-30. Hence, I don't believe this game is truly playable. The slowdown ruins any serious attempt to play it. I could be wrong. This is only my experience. download at your own risk."
,Netarangi,2011-08-06T00:45Z,"Dumas, you are what your name says.. A dumb ass.

Any medium-high end computer could play these at a constant 60fps."
[T],Coolguy33,2011-08-06T05:22Z,Hey buddy you need to be a bit more specific in your description. This collection has only been released for PS3. The only way you can run this is with a PS3 emulator. Am i wrong?
,puli9,2011-08-06T05:40Z,"is there any ps3 emulator available please tell me
"
[T],Coolguy33,2011-08-06T05:46Z,"Fuck it, waitin for someone to say if it's legit!"
[T],Coolguy33,2011-08-06T07:08Z,"@puli9, at this stage there are some PS3 emulators but they are still in development and cannot run games fully. It will take a few more years to get a good working emulator and a powerfull PC to play it on. "
