I was disappointed in members who did not become seeders. The download would have been much faster if all would give back and upload the full content. 
Giving back is the key to making PirateBay successful. Come on guys, be part of the solution, not part of the problem."
,jctcom,2012-02-19T02:40Z,Some of us aren't watching on Crappy little computer screens.  We do appreciate and have the patience to download a great quality release like this.  If you want something crappier and smaller I am sure there are plenty of other choices out there for you.  Feel free to download them.
