,stevenrankin,2011-08-06T09:19Z,"thanks, but when recording please remember to include the next time trailer, for some reason torrents have left them out the last 2 episodes, but they are getting broadcast?"
,malinea,2011-08-06T10:37Z,thank you for the fast upload. :)
,nostromo47,2011-08-07T18:40Z,Muy buen aporte gracias...
,oldcrank,2011-08-07T22:13Z,A big thanks to VTV and also to those who upload.
,dahauk,2011-08-08T09:10Z,"I've been thinking this series was plodding along on some sort of boring auto-pilot, but this episode rocked my world. Surprising, shocking, tear-inducing --well done folks! "
,godoffire2004,2011-08-08T19:56Z,"Thanks for uploading Torchwood Miracle Day I'm sure the quality is excellent because I've watched other series you've uploaded and they've been great! 

Thanks again! You're awesome!"
,Sattori,2011-08-08T20:25Z,"Thanks! But ""Torchwood"" (only two members left from third season, sigh...) should really get a grip now. Only five episodes to come and they are as harmless as Hello Kitty. They no longer defy anyone, just watching and getting beaten up. C'mon guys, start kicking some asses!!!"
