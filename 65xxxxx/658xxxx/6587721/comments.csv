,gigabyteme,2011-08-07T01:55Z,150 MB space needed to download updates after the game is installed. Feel free to comment if the game does or does not work on ur Android device... ENJOY!
,gigabyteme,2011-08-07T02:08Z,"And for those who think that the game is stuck on the ""EA"" screen, it isn't. You will hear the music in the background playing. It takes approx. 2 minutes for the EA screen to disappear and then the game will start... "
,LawnMowerKing,2011-08-07T14:02Z,"LOL AT YOU gigabyteme.

There are no any self updating apps to download out of the android market, the only way to get an update-able version is to buy it off the market!
