My torrents are perfect.
Your torrents are riddled with errors.
Errors should be pointed out for the sake of the downloaders.
Now grow up, kid. For your own sake."

Att du tog ställning på en sida och tog bort min självklara rätt att försvara mej gör dej till en IDIOT!

Jag har bemött en IDIOT som attackerar inte bara mej utan många andra här men att du blundar för detta faktum, är fan bedrövligt!

Ni behöver torrent jag behöver inte er så dra åt helvete........................."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-08-07T01:06Z,"Hahaha he's back for more. Sometimes you just have to admit you're wrong, anoxmous. I guess you are blind to reality."
,hutness,2011-08-08T16:36Z,"Thanks for upload, GoodFilms! :D
I got a problem, though. When I try to convert one using mkv2vob, even when choosing English language audio, it still coverts it with the Russian audio. Is there a solution for that?"
[V],GoodFilms,2011-08-08T18:41Z,"I don't know, try a forum.

I recommend watching it on something that plays MKVs (lots of options) so you don't have to convert."
,PhoenixRe,2012-04-05T22:15Z,"Any subtitles for this?
Thnx for a great upload btw"
