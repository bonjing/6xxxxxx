While the storyline is sometimes goofy the idea remains with us that the rangers will always be around. PROO is basically a combination of Turbo, Lightspeed Rescue and Space Patrol Delta but for a kid or adult who loves or loved power rangers from the beginning it's pretty kewl. however the morphing call should have stayed as the title for the first episode instead of what it became. Hopefully the writers will remember the funniness of the story as well as the seriousness of it. oh yeah one more thing "Good Luck Rangers and May The Power Protect You."
