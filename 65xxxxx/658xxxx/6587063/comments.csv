,xenoFLASH,2011-08-06T19:11Z,all the media coverage for this? what a joke.
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-08-06T19:30Z,"I know how much you've been wanting to read this, and I feel your disappointment. What a let down :("
,MuserClair,2011-08-06T21:40Z,"i'm waiting til i've got it all to read it - sounding like a let down already :-s

Thanks for the ul though GH :-)"
,xenoFLASH,2011-08-07T00:50Z,"I'm with you, GH90. I learned more about the the new spidey from the newspaper than I this comic. At least the other two story bits were good."
,Lyxnman,2011-08-07T03:26Z,The news coverage is about the Ultimate Spider-man series not ultimate fallout
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-08-07T05:58Z,"@Lynxman

""What will become of Captain America? Where have all the X-Men gone? And what is up with the new Spider-Man suit? Don't miss the final chapters of one of the most talked about Ultimate events ever.""

This is the description marvel gave. Does this seem to have any relation to the comic? I don't think so."
,Tinny_pb,2011-08-08T12:09Z,"The 4 issues so far have been slow-moving and padded. And the Kangaroo is a pretty lame attempt at scripting an Australian character... that Simpsons episode was more accurate.

Nice scan though. ;)"
