Fusion Reborn: The universe is ripped apart at the seams after an industrial disaster in Other World unleashes the monstrous Janemba â€“ and the beast grows stronger with every moment. The turmoil reaches across dimensions, and the battle rages on two fronts. Goku and Vegeta unite in the fight for Other Worldâ€™s survival, while Goten and Trunks confront a ghoulish army of the undead on Earth. With strength and fury, the warriors reach incredible heights of power â€“ but it isnâ€™t enough. A dangerous plan of attack is devised, and only an unprecedented level of teamwork will deliver victory. This is the story of the sum of all evil.

Wrath of the Dragon:Two strangers have appeared on Earth. One of them invites devastation. The other has the power to prevent it. Harsh sacrifices must be made to untangle the web of deception that threatens to blind the forces of good to an approaching evil. Dark magic has released an ancient monster â€“ Hirudegarn â€“ that consumes both flesh and soul. As it rampages on Earth, its power threatens to multiply to unthinkable levels. Such wickedness can only be defeated by Tapion, a man who has already given so much â€“ and must now offer his very life to save the universe. This is the story of true brotherhood
