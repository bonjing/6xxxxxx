You might wanna edit the title, it's called ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"". Just saying.

@SS64084

Actually if someone told me it was a dvd screener I WOULD argue with them, only for the fact that dvd screeners aren't usually out so quick after the movie was released in theatres. And for the fact that most dvd screeners are A9V9, and not as you say A6V8."
