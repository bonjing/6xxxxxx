THE PSILOCYBIN LIBRARY

This year I have been working on a large project, which went under then name â€The Mushroom Diaryâ€ for a long time and thats pretty much what it was, a diary depicting a new growers path into muchroom growing, namely mine . 

Now the name is â€The Psilocybin Libraryâ€ and I am pre-releasing a minor part of its content to the public, to see their reaction and as a late summer gift. The archive will be released in its entire version later this fall. 

The full archive contains over 1500 pictures, og which around 50 will be shown now. The archive is split into categories and I mean to show a small portion of each gallery of my choice. Also I would like to dedicate this pre-release to members at Myco-Tek.org who with effort helped me in the last stages of the archives creation. 
Enjoy!

I would like to inform each and every person that I personally hold copyright to each picture and I will not tolerate misuse. These pictures are works of art and have taken me hundreds of hours to complete. I own exclusive copyright.
