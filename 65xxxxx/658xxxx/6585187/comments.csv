,Kaosunoburinga,2011-08-14T18:07Z,Anyone know where to find the Gothic Library. It adds the magic skill to the game
,Serird,2011-08-25T18:48Z,"Can you make one folder with all packages (classified by month) and one folder with all Simspack (classified by month too), so we can more easily select what we want to download?"
,DisOrder08,2011-09-02T01:25Z,"EXCELLENT!!! 
Thanks so much!
@Serird--downloading the latest update overwrites the previous months so wuts the difference?
maybe we should just appreciate the uploaders sharing this and quit yer bitchin'"
,kittyclaw,2011-09-04T01:53Z,"this is one great upload! I simply love the sims, and this pack gives me absolute great joy and possibilities! Thnx a million!"
,Green-Banana,2011-09-04T20:12Z,"@DisOrder08 Because if an uploader makes a mistake, it could multiply exponentially if left unfixed.  Just because someone DOES something doesn't make them holy and blameless.  Now stop being an Orwellian pig and learn what REAL appreciation means.  "
,Green-Banana,2011-09-04T20:16Z,Hidden Springs came out in August 2011.  This torrent does not have Hidden Springs.  
,Spollero,2011-09-19T15:05Z,"Thanks. This torrent is awesome.
To make this more awesome, next month, do what Serird said. It would make our lives much easier."
,nickotin3,2011-10-14T16:39Z,"I've downloaded both the August and September store items from you, I've installed them right..

But..

Ever since I installed these, I've had two blue screens (after sims crashes on me) Anyone else had the same problem? I've done a system restore and a full virus check and there's nothing, but it still crashes :( Any help please?

(Not saying that these files are viruses, might've been a virus that got in whilst downloading overnight)"
,nickotin3,2011-10-14T17:22Z,"^^^ I withdraw my last comment
Found out it was just my RAM, dead :("
