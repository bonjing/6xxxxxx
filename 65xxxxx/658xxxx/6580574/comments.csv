,Steiner101,2011-08-08T21:12Z,"WTF?

Real, fake, a/v; any chance?"

,cedal,2011-08-15T00:19Z,Better than IMAGINE :)
,caprikornius,2011-08-19T06:03Z,i don´t understand you people. Why do you need coments about this torrent? Can´t you just download the 35mb sample and check it out? unbelievable!!
,caprikornius,2011-08-19T06:50Z,"just downloaded the sample. It´s weird, the details of the file says 720p. but it looks like old movies quality. if i were you i´d look for a better quality. This one is not worth it!!!
i think that the bunch of people that are downloading or downloaded this are too desperate to see this movie. That´s the way i see it"
,zfone,2011-09-01T11:17Z,if thts hd thn how low res .would be??
,bennjamin,2011-09-08T04:26Z,Could everyone from now on just say whether its legit and good quality. Stop trying to be witty. We don't care if you're funny.
,ghandi253,2011-10-01T05:46Z,How can it be in 720p and be a TS? Fucking moron! -1
,Crazy-Dutchman,2011-10-07T22:37Z,Only watched the sample but that doesnt look like 720 AT ALL!
,spacer70,2011-10-12T19:01Z,"720p means its 720 pixels in height video, it does not mean that its high quality fking idiots."
,lordshadows,2011-10-17T20:13Z,Then this belongs in the Movies section not the Highres-Movies section.
,thomasbill,2011-11-23T16:49Z,"Rubbish download! A4 V5 - This is not 720p, it is similar quality to something that was filmed with a cam at a cinema. I will wait for better download before i watch it as this not really enjoyable to watch at all."
