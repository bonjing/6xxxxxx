This is an English translation of Louis-Ferdinand Celine's book "Bagatelles pour un massacre", or "Trifles for a Massacre", long out of print in France and previously never translated into English. It's content is a long series of anti-semitic diatribes, delivered in Celine's trademark slang focussed irreverent style. The book is one of the reasons Celine was declared a "National Disgrace" after World War II. Celine himself is looked at as one of the most important writers of the 20th century, and the translation of this long unavailable 'bad book', the one that ruined his reputation, is a good addition for both fans and people curious about what the controversy dealt with.
