 It is hard to imagine that Runrig have been going since the late 1970's and have successfully bridged their native Scottish roots with contemporary rock. Recovery more than adequately reflects this and it is refreshingly apparent that the Celtic language which appears in so many of the tracks proves so accessible to those of us who do not identify with it. In short, the songs are beautifully crafted and the whole album is varied to a point of being magnificent. A real treasure in any collection and, for those who hear it, a window into their considerable catalogue of superb music spanning four decades.
