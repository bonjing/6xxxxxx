Pre-release of the Psilocybin Library
This year I have been working on a large project, which went under then name The Mushroom Diary for a long time and thats pretty much what it was, a diary depicting a new growers path into muchroom growing. Now the name is The Psilocybin Library and I am pre-releasing a minor part of its content to the public, to see their reaction and as a late summer gift. The archive will be released in its entire version later this fall. 

The archive contains over 1500 pictures, of which around 100 will be shown now. The archive is split into categories and I mean to show a small portion of each gallery of my choice. Also I would like to dedicate this pre-release to members at Myco-Tek.org who with effort helped me in the last stages of the archives creation. 
Enjoy!

I would like to inform each and every person that I personally hold copyright to each picture and I will not tolerate misuse. These pictures are works of art and have taken me hundreds of hours to complete. I own exclusive copyright. 

I hope you will enjoy this archive and its contents. 

From myself to you all, I wish you a really nice summer!
