Riblja ÄŒorba (Serbian Cyrillic: Ð Ð¸Ð±Ñ™Ð° Ð§Ð¾Ñ€Ð±Ð°, pronounced [rÃ®bÊŽaË tÍ¡ÊƒÉ”ÌŒËrba]; translation: Fish Stew) is a Serbian and former Yugoslav rock band. Their presence on the scene has lasted from 1978 to today. They reached their peak of popularity in the 1980s, but it has declined in the 1990s, partly due to controversial political attitudes of the band\'s leader Bora ÄorÄ‘eviÄ‡. Known for their provocative political- and social-related lyrics, Riblja ÄŒorba were one of the top acts of the former Yugoslav rock scene.
