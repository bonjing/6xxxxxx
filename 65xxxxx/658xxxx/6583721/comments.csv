,retrogoddfather,2011-08-05T10:12Z,"I know, it is just the way I rip it. my standard setting. space isn't an issue for me and my rack is all set for 24/96. I don't need to change all of my settings just to rip a cd and share it. I just stated that it is 24/96 which it is, I never claimed the original cd was 24/96.  audiophiles/professionals usually take this as a given. but I had to advertise that the current file settings are 24/96 thank you"
,retrogoddfather,2011-08-05T10:14Z,"some people, if not properly set up, and depending on their equipment/cards/software, may not be able to play in 24/96  or some phones can't play over a certain bitrate, therefor, the advertisement of 24/96"
,retrogoddfather,2011-08-05T10:19Z,"don/t know what's up with my comments, but I will try again.. I know that the original cd is not 24/96..nor did I say it was.  I advertised the 24/96 and 2000kbps because some people have trouble playing in that format depending on setup or phone. 24/96 is the standard setting i rip with. and my rack setup. so before someone downloads and realizes that they can't play it.  I put it out there"
,elektrostatisk,2011-08-05T10:57Z,"Fine with me. But fĂÂśr a lot of people 24-96 means higher resolulotion/higher playback quality. And therefore they take the opportunity to download such files even if they are the double size and take the double time to download.
Even worse is that a lot of people actually believe that you improve quality when upconverting from, say, a mp3 to flac.
Frankly, I see no point whatsoever to upload a cd in 24-96 format, I don't even see the point of storing them in that format either, even if you have space.

I am glad you did tell the source, so even we ""unprofessionals"" can decide wether a download is worth the time or not :-)

,retrogoddfather,2011-08-05T14:12Z,"Don't, get me wrong, I welcome comments, especially informative ones, I've seen many uploads of people converting mp3 to flac not knowing there's no gain, and I would have updated my description of tpb had the edit feature functioning. Just to explain, I personally have 96 because my rack is all dig..when changing from 96 to 44 our 48, or up to 192 I have to change a setting on the mastering processor. I figured I'd give people a high quality file and they can convert to wherever they e want but I use wav files..so I just converted to flac because most don't want a2 gig album like snobs like me ;-) ..so thank you, perhaps if I get the time to upload more, it will be worth it to change rip settings."
[T],PeteSapai,2011-12-11T01:58Z,"Hi there, Retro!

I have 2 questions/comments for you:
1. Can you seed this? ^^ Stuck at 96% here.
2. I understand you have a default setting for ripping audio. However, if you use that setting, I'd say you're a bit of an audiophile, in which case I assume you use EAC to rip audo, in which case you can just use different profiles. Ripping a usual CD? Load the CD (16-44) profile. Ripping some HQ disc? Load the HQ profile. Furthermore, if you;re uploading this on TPB, you want to share and let it be shared, yet this is 4x bigger than it has to be, greatly lowering the chances of this torrent ever surviving (heck, even ""only"" 300MB flacs have a hard time being seeded).
Anyway, great you share (or shared ;p) this! Quality over quantity! :)"
