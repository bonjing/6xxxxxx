This is a Full SBS  copy of Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs in Stereoscopic 3D

Specs?  

960*540 Full SBS 3D .mp4 made especially for us few that have an EVO3D, o snap


its about an hour and a half long and its over 3.4 Gigs, you do the math on that one, all i can say is this, when i show people that think my phone is a gimmick they usually start with saying "wow" and then soon after  "daaaaaaaam...."  and typically i have to ask for the phone back.  


its in english
(es en ingles)

Please refer to this guide for an easy method of increasing the volume on the EVO3D to 200% roughly of the original volume !!!

Just remember if you try to make your own videos dont make a file over 4G, that's the max file size transfer for the EVO3D, that is, until some awesome nerd figures a way around it. 

ENJOY!!
