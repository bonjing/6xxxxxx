,nairrb,2011-09-06T10:40Z,Hi Phatwarez. Thanks a lot for placing this torrent. I have been looking for the same since a very very long time. One of my old-time favorite movie where I lost my VHS copy. I am sure a good number of us are in the lookout for this movie. Thanks again. Will write again after the download.

I appreciate your upload of this nice old movie; however, I am sorry to mention that the quality is not up to the mark. The movie frames are jerky and strenuous to watch. Especially when this is a movie with mostly dances, it is very disturbing. Could you redo the conversion? -- be it a bit less compressed, but of better frames. It will be highly appreciated. Thanks once again for the upload."
