A group of nuclear explosion survivors are trying to survive attacks of the    blind villagers.The survivors board up in the villa and prepare for an attack at night.It all leads to surprisingly downbeat and tragic ending. The cast shall be pretty familiar to fans of Spanish cult cinema as it includes Paul Naschy,Nadiuska,Alberto DeMendoza,Teresa Gimpera,Tony Kendall and Maria Perschy. Very enjoyable and pretty dark horror movie!
