,memphist,2011-08-05T22:03Z,"Great work bensteele. I have only played with this for half an hour and to just let others know what I think.  You do have to try it for yourself and this below is only my limited impression of the Browser.

This Browser is very fast! I do mean fastâ€¦  It has some well thought out features such as Text-to-Speech.  Text to speech is cool and has a nice voice, a bit too fast talking to keep up with what is being said and to comprehend.  The voice drops a syllable every now.  I would on no occasion use this feature.  There are other feature I've not explored yet that might be great...

As for the CONs: (well, they are only my cons as to how I like to use a browser):

-It only opens a new Windows and not TAB when. (It uses TABs when it performs a task like 'Open Gif' only) so it does have TABS
-The new windows that opens is IE9 not Benz
-No shortcuts for keyboard  i.e. Crtl+T for new TAB or Crtl+D for Bookmark ..or.. Crtl+Enter
-No Bookmark Bar, Period.  (History has where you've been, but you have to search for the site, and that I find Slow) 
- The runtime error for the speech (thing) gets annoying. But that just a bug
-Options to change or access are very thin - not many to adjust
- Private Browsing is a good feature. But again it start with a blank page and requires the full address.

* If you only accessed a couple of site and/or you like to type in the full name of the site,  than this is for you. It is a very fast browser, no question about that.  Float from site to site; the speed is a poor substitute for the inconveniences of typing I found.  

Still nice work

,bensteele,2011-08-06T00:14Z,"Thank you for your comment memphist. Im glad to get your feedback. Im have been working on this for years. The browser does open tabs. The add tab button is next to the forward button and the remove tab is next to that. Its also in the controls menu.

I have not yet found out how to store bookmarks after the application it closed but im working on that. Im also im pleased with the speed the browser loads the pages as well.

Im only 19 and im a beginner in software programing so this is a good learning project for me. If you would like to share more ideas or problems, please email me at ben.steele33@gmail.com."
,memphist,2011-08-06T05:39Z,"I have a 30Mb cable and timing your browser against the other big five.(Opera-Chrome-IE9-FireFox-Safari) your was the winner everytime.  It just didn't win, it slayed them.  

For protection reason I'm not going to mention the page I used,  But it is a speed test my company uses as a standard we can all relate to and is a private site built by us.  The site is only known by employees. 

IE9 is the quickest at 25 to 30 seconds, since the site was built some two years ago Opera is most times second.  For a short while Safari was the quickest at 45 Seconds at the start... 

(IE9 is the quickest today at 20 to 25 seconds) - Benz Web Browser_1.8  opens this page/link between 1 to 2 seconds.  
???????????????????????????????????????? WTF I said!!!!

Thinking this was not right I put Benz Web Browser_1.8  on a Netbook AMD 1.6GHz and on my 27"" MAC i7 3.3GH using parallel.. they all were  between 1 to 2 seconds.  I surfed other site to test the speed and Benz, it was always 200% to 500% quicker...  Every page  -  

Very very nice work... At 19 and just a biginner,  this is a hell of a start...

I hope some one from Opera,Chrome,IE9,FireFox or Safari make you an offer to fix there shit.  

Love your work"

,emiliouser,2011-08-07T00:22Z,"i have this message trying to install

Unable to install or run the application. The application requires that assembly stdole Version 7.0.3300.0 be installed in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) first."
,bensteele,2011-08-07T11:08Z,Im not really to sure about that as i have not had that problem. You can try updating Mircosoft.NET to a newer version as i think the stdole.dll is in there.
,bensteele,2011-08-10T14:49Z,"My new version is now out. The script error has been fixed and now the browser has keyboard shortcuts. need help, have errors or have ideas please email me. Link is below.
