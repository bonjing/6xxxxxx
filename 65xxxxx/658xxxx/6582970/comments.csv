,xbox06032,2012-01-02T12:48Z,"2012? No-this is NOT a Drover Pack. As of Jan 2nd,2012. The Newest XP Driver Pack is Feb. 2011. This ""All drivers 2012"" is ONLY a app that saves your own Drivers. its NOT a part of ANY ""Driver Pack"""
,kenoisify,2012-03-21T19:44Z,"ALL DRIVERS 2012 (LATEST) By: saquib123456 the pirate bay page at the following address:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6582970/ALL_DRIVERS_2012 (LATEST).
 Download this program and run it on my system with Windows XP sp3, run the setuo.exe that comes in that you download iso image, after it has started to scan the hardware of my computer because I finish scanning my computer I said if I wanted to install the program in C: drivers or C: Windows / drivers, I said that in C: driver.
 Then he started to unzip all drivers packages
 C: driver, since all packets decompressed drivers in C: driver told me if I wanted to install all these drivers on my computer and I said yes.
 So has started installing these drivers on my computer and now when I finish installing all these drivers told me I had to restart the computer for these were installed well.
 THE MAIN PROBLEM OF IT ALL is that when, after all these drivers installed on your computer and after you restart the computer I'm running the folder C: driver where the decompressed program packages all drivers to install on my system after Windows xp sp3.Mi question I ask to you is that if this folder C: drivers can be cleared after this program I just installed all the drivers on my system, as it weighs more than 1GB, which I think is a good hard disk space if you do not really need to delete this folder but I want to be sure that if the delete that folder C: driver will not affect the operation of my computer.
 Hopefully I podais help solve this huge problem since I really do not know what to do.
