My first torrent, it probably won't even work but if it does and you own an HTC EVO 3D then today is your &^#$-in day.

This is a Full SBS  issue of National Geographic's The Reef in 3D

Specs?  

960*540 Full SBS 3D .mp4 made especially for us few that have 3D phones, o snap


its about a half hour long and its over 3 Gigs, you do the math on that one, all i can is this, when i show people that think my phone is a gimmick they usually start with saying "wow" and then soon after  "daaaaaaaam...."  and typically i have to ask for the phone back.  


its in english
(es en ingles)

Please refer to internet sources for an easy method of increasing the volume on the EVO3D to 200% roughly of the original volume !!!

Just remember if you try to make your own videos dont make a file over 4G, that's the max file size transfer for the EVO3D, that is, until some awesome nerd figures a way around it. 

ENJOY!!


PLEASE NOTE IF YOU JUST DOWNLOAD AND DONT SEED THEN YOU ARE AN A$$HOLE, JUST SEED WHILE YOURE WATCHING THE MOVIE COME ON NOW DON'T BE LAZY !!!!
