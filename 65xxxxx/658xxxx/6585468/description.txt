Daan Broos en Dapokaster (1975) Vinyl-rip

This is a little gem from Belgium. Never released on CD and as far as I know this is the first vinyl rip.

It's no high-quality rip, I do not have the equiptment for that.
Just enjoy it for what it is and hope some day it will be released on CD.

Including pictures from front and back of lp-sleeve, PAR's
