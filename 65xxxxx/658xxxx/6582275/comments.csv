,Echiman,2011-08-04T19:06Z,"so what does it mean? that if we attack the ikko ikki faction on single player (which still not selectable), they would have those units including warrior nuns?"
,grisslol,2011-08-05T01:02Z,"This is Tanauser, so logically it is real and it has to work properly. Downloading..."
,hanbei18,2011-08-05T18:56Z,Maybe I can have those warrior nuns by bribing them during campaign?
,Echiman,2011-08-06T18:59Z,"have try it. And i must say although its not the real warrior nuns, its more like monk body with onna bushi faces. But its still worthy. Looking forward for your next update"
[T],Tanauser,2011-08-07T12:40Z,"If you give me the latest Update PATCH 7 & PATCH 8 ; I can make the same job on it .

So far it hasen't been Uploaded in a Pirate site

About the unit cards:
I can update this pack with different unit cards ; 
for the Ikko Ikki  ( specific) ; but it will be cutomized as those unit cards are not inside the patch5 .

- Same as the Nuns ; they are not in the Pach5 ; they must be remade by hand .

I guess Steam must send the model part mesh & the unit cards once you pay for them ...."

Sengoku Jidai DLC ^^
it got patch 7, but did'nt see any patch 8 in there"
[T],Tanauser,2011-08-08T09:05Z,"thanks Louco
Got it ! Great !

You guys want me to do specific  unit cards for Ikko Ikki ??

(explain what's wrong with the actual unit cards ?)"
,axe500,2011-08-08T10:34Z,"man i want the latest patch,i have been stuck to this buggy DX11 patch,and i would like to try the Ikko Ikki Clan....i know i demand too much but if its possible can you please make one."
[T],Tanauser,2011-08-08T10:53Z,"IKKO IKKI units are playable with this pack ; (all factions units playable).

Regarding the Ikko Ikki faction playable in the campaign it is hard coded in the exe. Meaning that only by having a steam green light the code will unlocked.

Though it can be done by a good hacker if he knows how to crack the algorythm"
,axe500,2011-08-08T12:50Z,"thanks,how about the SJ unit pack?"
[T],Tanauser,2011-08-08T23:18Z,"Alright ; Can you play the Avatar campaign ??
"
,Louco_da_feira,2011-08-09T01:55Z,"no one could break the ''code'' and make the ikko ikki playable? D:
like, checking the packs, i saw some files of the warrior nuns and some other stuff like, starting, lose and win movies for the ikko ikki '-'"
,Louco_da_feira,2011-08-09T17:02Z,"it crashes with build 3444 when on avatar, and multiplayer stuff"
[T],Tanauser,2011-08-09T19:55Z,"yeap it crashes for me also with the avatar ....

So  ; do you want special unit cards for the Ikko Ikki ?"
,Louco_da_feira,2011-08-09T21:08Z,"did u manage to unlock the icky? O.o
WOA :D"
[T],Tanauser,2011-08-09T22:23Z,"only the units  ( see this mod) , not the faction ; 
the key is inside the .exe"
,elppir,2011-08-29T22:27Z,"""Campaign map All visible ( No shoud) after first turn .""

Why? Can someone please confirm that I can just use the update without this added cheat?"
,Louco_da_feira,2011-09-03T04:50Z,"damn, ikko ikki must be really hard to crack :S"
,Pobbes,2011-09-03T07:00Z,any way to turn the fog of war back on?
,Mescaleros,2011-09-03T08:52Z,"to turn back the fog ; I already told you to remove in the DLC4free the  .lua file inside campaign/jap_shogun .

With a Pirate game ( like the one we have )
To make the Ikko Ikki playable as a faction would mean to replace one of the existing faction by the Ikko Ikki ;  which is a hell of a work. 

All I could do was to unlock the units 
"
,kingbread,2011-09-09T03:47Z,"sry 2 questions:

when i play a faction like the hojo, why can i build special units like the other faction's special units like mori raiders.

also, i can't seem to find you .lua to delete to get the fog of war back.

thx in advance "
,grisslol,2011-10-04T19:29Z,"So, any chance we get the new content from you?"
,MaliciousTentacles,2011-10-06T08:54Z,"awesome - it works great! the only annoyance is that I'm called ""Ali213"" in the custom matches but it doesn't really matter  since I just play the single player lol"
,grisslol,2011-10-07T11:33Z,"For the name, blame the chinese guy who cracked it."

for rise of the samurai, the crack is effy though"
,grisslol,2011-10-22T20:41Z,"Well, I got it from http://www.argentinawarez.com/juegos-gratis/1644133-multi-rise-samurai-funcionando-fs-fsc-wu.html 
Perfectly working, except that if you hit the spacebar or anyother keybind that speeds up the campaign movement, game crushes. Except from that, it is perfect. You also get the Ikko Ikki faction and not just the units."
,grisslol,2011-10-24T23:30Z,"pfff, don't even bother with the previous link. Your saves get corrupted, you can't go after turn 12 and there are also a handful of other reasons you get crushes. We need a better crack. Thank god tanauser always gives us the right stuff."
,Bad213Boy,2011-12-13T07:12Z,"*** UPDATE ***

I've fixed Rise of the Samurai Load Saved Game Crash bug. Make sure you remove the spaces, TPB wont let me post links.
