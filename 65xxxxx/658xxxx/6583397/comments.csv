,dzlrules,2011-08-05T05:07Z,"One of the few books I read as a kid, was ""Little House on the Prairie"" back in the early 70's. It was my favorite then and still ranks pretty high on the favorites list.

Thanks.... I'll seed back too! New Comcast 6/2 with the wonderful *ever glorified* power boost... :p

Namaste"
