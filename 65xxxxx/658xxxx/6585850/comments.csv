There is no reason for distributing video material in archived form, it only decreases the number of seeders as many people don't want to leave the RAR's around. It only wastes 1.7 GB's of hard disk space and don't contribute any value compared with sharing the actual MKV file as torrent clients have built-in error checking and recovery system for bad data."
