If Thin Lizzy got a bit too grand and florid on
Johnny the Fox, they quickly corrected themselves
on its 1977 follow-up, Bad Reputation. Teaming up
with the legendary producer Tony Visconti, Thin
Lizzy managed to pull of a nifty trick of sounding
leaner, tougher than they did on Johnny, yet they
also had a broader sonic palette. Much of this is
due, of course, to Visconti, who always had a
flair for subtle dramatics that never called
attention to themselves and he puts this to use in
dramatic effect here, to the extent that Lizzy
sounds stripped down to their bare bones, even
when they have horns pushing them forward on
"Dancing in the Moonlight" or when overdubbed
vocals pile up on the title track. Of course, they
were stripped down to a trio on this record,
lacking guitarist Brian Robertson, but Scott
Gorham's double duty makes his absence
unnoticeable. Plus, this is pure visceral rock &
roll, the hardest and heaviest that Thin Lizzy
ever made, living up to the promise of the title
track. And, as always, a lot of this has to do
with Phil Lynott's writing, which is in top form
whether he's romanticizing "Soldiers of Fortune"
or heading down the "Opium Trail." It adds up to
an album that rivals Jailbreak as their best
studio album. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine
