PART ONE:

3 backpackers are in Amsterdam where they get locked out of their youth hostel. They are invited into a man\\\\\\\'s house where he tells them of a hostel somewhere in eastern Europe where the women are all incredibly hot and have a taste for American men. When they get there, everything is too good to be true - the hostel is \\\\\\\"to die for

PART TWO:

Three female college students take a detour from their partying, enticed by a beautiful European woman who promises seclusion, safety and maybe even romance. What they get is a living hell where they are sold to the highest bidder who\\\\\\\'s fondest wish is to kill them slowly. Hostel 2 also follows 2 American men who, on the flip side of the coin, are willing to pay to join an exclusive club where a life will end at their hands...any way they like. It\\\\\\\'s a story of human monsters and the almighty dollar as only Eli Roth could tell it.
