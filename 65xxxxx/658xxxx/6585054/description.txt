One of the true enigmas of the Nigerian music scene, Sir Victor Uwaifo has been an instantly recognisable figure throughout his five decades in the music industry. He built his first guitar aged 12 and went on to be awarded Africa's first gold disc in 1969. 

His incessant energy have seen him record countless LP's and singles and become one of Nigeria's true superstars. A musician, poet, philosopher, sculptor, painter, ambassador and recently Commissioner for Culture, he has carved a unique place for himself in the history of African music. This compilation focuses on his 'Ekassa' period in the first half of the 1970's. 

These recordings were made after his return from Lagos to his home town of Benin City in Edo State at the start of the new decade.

Uwaifo mixed the ancient culture of the Benin Obas with highlife & a dash of rock and soul to form his new style. Amazingly many of these cuts have remained unavailable since then... until now.
