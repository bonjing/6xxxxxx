In Detail

The Field module is a new core module in Drupal 7, and is the next generation of the legendary Drupal 6 CCK (Content Construction Kit) module. The CCK was a developer's best friend, used on any Drupal project of any size. Now, the Field module builds on the strength of the CCK module, bringing new features to Drupal 7.
The Field module allows custom data fields to be attached to Drupal entities (content nodes, users, taxonomy vocabularies, and so on) and takes care of storing, loading, editing, and rendering field data.

In Drupal 7, you can create content types and you can add fields to any content type. You can rearrange the order in which fields are displayed and you can specify the label position and format of the field. Unlike in earlier versions, you do not need to download a separate module to add fields to a content type.
Wouldn't you like to know more about how to use this important and interesting feature?
