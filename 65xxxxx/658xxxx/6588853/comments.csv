,xASPiREx,2011-08-08T08:09Z,"Title says it all, don't you think?"
,warejaws,2011-08-09T00:19Z,"umm, actually it doesn't say whether the subs are hard-coded or not. See, xASPiREx, some of us don't enjoy reading mongloid while watching a film. Thank you onegreatguy for clearing it for us."
,xASPiREx,2011-08-09T00:44Z,So 'SWESUB' doesn't say anything to you? Really? If you've been hanging around TPB for a while you should have noticed that everything with SWESUB on it are swedish subtitles burned in the actual movie file .. 
,BC,2011-08-13T15:14Z,not really
,dynamite69,2011-08-17T12:02Z,Yes - SWESUB = Swedish subs 99% hardcoded
