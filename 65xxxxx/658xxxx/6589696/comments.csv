,skyscrapper81,2011-08-08T06:11Z,"There is a password to UnRAR the thing here.

,ilieea3,2011-08-08T07:33Z,rar password??? what?? please tell me this works. because i've been spending my past hour downloading it! dial up sucks!:(
,mesays,2011-08-08T07:51Z,"this is a rar file and does require a pssword to extract... I've never seen this before with tvteam...what happened...what about this....
(((((((((((((= Enjoy No RAR releases =))))))))))))))))))))"
,mesays,2011-08-08T07:58Z,"the file comes with a link to get a password but instead that link wants you to do surveys and input personal information in order to get the password, also there may or may not be a fee attached, I didn't bother to jump through enough hoops to find out for sure, this is truly a black mark on what I until now considered to be a very trusted uploader in tvteam...why would you cheapen yourself like this?"
[T],MelloYello,2011-08-08T08:06Z,Quit fucking lying.  There is no password.  TvTeam doesn't password anything.  Use winrar takes about 20 seconds to unrar.  Get a clue and stop being a troll.
[T],MelloYello,2011-08-08T08:10Z,"It says in the info 
""www . TorrentDay . Com  (((((((((((((= Enjoy No RAR releases =))))))))))))))))))))""

This is Pirate Bay so their file is rar.  If you want to join their site then u can ""Enjoy No RAR releases""

That is the way I understood it. Kinda makes sense doesn't it.  Some people are burnt.
"
[T],MelloYello,2011-08-08T08:11Z,LOLOLOLOL to funny.  I checked just and it's not even a rar file idiots. lololololololol
,ilieea3,2011-08-08T08:40Z,^^^ah thank you so much! I was about to freak out  if what the person said was true lol. i just hope the whole 'out of sync' thing isn't too bad=/
,Svarta.katten,2011-08-08T12:33Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Biggest fucking shit ever. 
I was so excited but then it's a FUCKIN password that you can't get. I will NEVER download from Tvteam again."
,Svarta.katten,2011-08-08T12:37Z,And Melloyello is a fuckin retarded lier to. There's no rar file? what the fuck are you talking about? you can see it's a rar file when you open the torrent in your program AND it's a password you disgusting motherfucker
,Svarta.katten,2011-08-08T12:38Z,looooooool why are you deleting my comments  :) fuck off
,IrritableWOcoffee,2011-08-08T14:05Z,"WTF? It's not even  RAR file, all you have to do is click on it and check. What the hell is wrong with people?"
,BigEd2469,2011-08-08T14:21Z,50% dl after 15 minutes.  thanks to all of the seeders out there.  I will seed till I have to go to work tonight and then seed some more tomorrow.  it is an AVI and not a rar so stop flipping out about that
,knope,2011-08-08T15:53Z,"uh it clearly says "".avi""

note to the unsure pirates: click the number 5 next to ""Files:"" up top so you can see if what you're downloading is .avi or not.

them trolls be rollin hard lol.
THANK YOU TvTeam!"
,Tobakk93,2011-08-10T00:15Z,"It's no rar file or pasword, its a avi file and TvTeam are just as reliable as eztv or more reliable if you ask me, TvTeam FOREVER "
,gocry_emokid,2011-08-11T22:03Z,Confirming that it's an .avi file. Downloading pretty fast too.
