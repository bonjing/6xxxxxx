,FaNtAsY2011,2011-08-05T23:24Z,Just checked out the sample and it looked a bit fuzzy a bit like a bad vhs but definitely gonna watch this one i cant wait any longer
,snowbirds,2011-08-06T02:47Z,The sample looked like a cam.  Fuzzy and dark.  Impossible to see details.  
,danova,2011-08-06T04:17Z,we have been waiting a good RIP for this movie since a while.... all we got is TS... so what about this torrent? i will download the sample first plz i hope its good quality coz these kind of movies needs really clear screen to see the details 
,asteink,2011-08-06T04:32Z,Definitely not standard PPVRIP quality. Super fuzzy yet watchable. V-4 A-6
,danova,2011-08-06T04:38Z,ya now after i saw the sample.. nah i guess im gona wait..

,phattsao,2011-08-06T15:49Z,"Sadly, this really is fuzzy and doesn't look any better than a TS.  Sound is good, video looks like crap.  I'd wait, I'm sure the real DVD rip will be out within a week or two"

,Pwny,2011-08-06T23:39Z,"So, wtf is a PPVRIP?
Is it like a Camrip that was recently created as a word?"
,dlarrym1111,2011-08-07T04:10Z,"@Pwny: PPVRip = (Pay Per View) its a rip from a movie bought from a PAY per view cable service and directly recorded onto a DVR or TIVO recording device. It is then converted to XVID/DIVX/.MP4/H264/AVI or whatever format one chooses. Then it gets UPLOADED here. A PPV is ABSOLUTELY NOT NEW and NOT the same as a CAM. If quality is as BAD as a CAM it is because someone doesn't know what they are doing. In theory, it should be the same quality as recording a DVD and uploading it as the source is also digital."
,riahc3,2011-08-07T05:06Z,Look at the codec used: DivX 5. No wonder it is shitty quality. This should be nuked.
,ThaiDennis,2011-08-07T07:01Z,Also keep in mind that PPV rips are almost always 4x3 pan and scans. (Since they are played on hotel TV's etc.)
,Ebol,2011-08-07T13:40Z,"Dear lord, why has it taken so long for a good copy of this movie to come out? There is still no good copy out."

Im sure there was a time when you didn't know how to use torrents just like all of us and therefore your comments seems a bit hypocritical

And secondly, people that dont know much about torrenting are usually the ones that dont remove torrents from their download clients and therefore end up seeding much more than any regular torrenter would, so your comment is not only hypocritical it is also flawed (or in short - Complete rubbish) "

The video is boxed and the quality reminds of an old VHS-tape. It is really dark and sometimes it seems like even the camrips are better.

Yes it's still watchable, but nothing i'd reccomend watching with friends/family, then you'll be better off going to the cinema or aith for the DVD/BR release.

''A/V 8/9'' What the fuck are you compairing this with? An old tape that has been outside for several decades? Seriously this is not even near an 8 or 9. This could even be just an descent camrip.

You sir/madam/troglodyte are an idiot if you think that your Russian savior will come out with ANYTHING of better quality for this or any other torrent on TPB. EZ is notorious for mislabeling his torrents and expecting people to ""deal with it"" because his ""work"" comes out marginally faster then other scene group releases..

If people would stop being sheeple and blindly sucking on EZ's cock, they'd realize that there are other choices of equal or better quality to what he offers, they just need to stop being lazy and look at whats out there..

EZ does get mad props for being a name that is alm ost as known  in the scene as aXXo's was... but that certainly doesnt mean that because one has a name, that their offerings are any good...

Knowledge is power and how one uses that knowledge makes all the difference.

,EffMinor,2011-08-11T09:33Z,"@RawThing the actual DVD would have to come out on the market for them to actually make a DVDRip. Hence the ""DVD"" part in ""DVDRip"""
,omggmo,2011-08-12T01:12Z,"@RawThing

How long do you think it takes to come out with a DVDrip!? The only way you can get a good DVDrip is from someone who works in the industry that can leak a copy; when I say the industry I mean within the companies that Produce Manufacture or distribute said DVD's. PPVrip is about the best quality your gonna get on something like this right now... Unless there is a leaked R5 Line (which means that it was recorded off of a projector with a amachine that connects to it as it plays in a theatre, usually in Russia, China or some other country like that. The ""line"" is in the title because they have to replace the audio with an english audio source.) Although this PPVrip Fucking blows, not worth the bandwidth. I am personally going to wait for an MKV 720p version. Now that you know a little bit more about hacking stop being a greedy fucking little noob wanker. It takes time to get ahold of these films. "

,dlarrym1111,2011-08-29T21:09Z,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS UP-LOADER!!!!  

This and ALL of his/hers uploads are GARBAGE and have the same flaws over and over again yet people still come here and I guess are so desperate they figure it is better then some CAMS (it may be, but so is a hemorrhoid). 
It is 4:3 aspect ratio for some reason which is BAD enough.

To ADD: it looks to me as if a camera was set on a tripod in front of this persons TV and is recording it in that TOTALLY GAY manor.
This up loader bought it on PAY PER VIEW through D-TV. (D-TV gets theater releases of BIG NAME movies 1 week ahead of the the theatrical release but you have to use there version of PAY PER VIEW and due to it being a new release it cost more then a regular PPV they may have.

WHY doesn't this retard use a DVR or TIVO, I'll never understand. paying for PPV and then using some B.S. method to capture the movie doesn't make any sense?? 
TOAST has a plugin just for the purpose of taking TIVO or DVR data and converting it Directly to DVD-R if you want. You can obviously put it onto your hard drive if you want. Then use an app like : Xilisoft Video Converter Ultimate to format it as an Xvid or H264 or whatever you want. (I have D-TV and you can get a control box for a few extra dollars each month with a DVR built in to record shows/movies/documentaries, or WHAT EVER you want). 
SO, Why is this guy/gal actually worsening the quality once he/or she gets there hands on it. There are now MANY MANY better DVD rips of THOR out at TPB that are excellent. No need to even come to this place. This old school TV aspect ratio 4:3 is NOT what anyone wants and mMANY have commented so. DOES  listen to the peoples comments or suggestions. NO he doesn't. I guess if advise isn't said nicely, this up-loader will not make any changes. Even nicely put suggestions don't seem to do any good either.

AVOID THIS UPLOAD-ER LIKE THE PLAUGE!!!! I don't understand why anyone would even download any of this guys garbage.
NO ONE wants a 4:3 aspect ratio yet this up-loader continues to do so. people beside me have mentioned that a DVR of some type should be used if your going to capture a movie using PPV, but STILL this guy/gal is putting a CAM in-front of a TV to capture these so call PPV uploads. If nothing changes, nothing changes.

Do you people know what the definition of Insanity is ? ? ? ?  
The definition is:  To do something exactly the same as you have always done, but expect a different result. to think this way is text book insanity!
If I boil water in a pot, It takes @ 208 degrees of heat to bring water to a boil (depending on your altitude above seas level) I would expect it to boil at the same temp if I did it over and over again. If I did it again and this time expected it to NOT boil at 208 degrees, but expected it to boil at 80 degrees, I would be insane.
Why should any of us expect anything to change here. This up-loader isn't responding to any kind or unkind suggestions of ways to improve his uploads. Maybe he/she thinks they are always right and are above having any constructive criticism. NO this isn't a very NICE or constructive criticism but it is a very real breakdown of the problems with this persons uploads. 
I have given ""NICE"" comments before to no avail???? I am not the only one to try to help either.
I shall never look to this up-loader for anything ever again.  He/she () is so arrogant that nothing anyone says will be looked at by this up-loader as advise. It is this shitty attitude that will keep this up-loader continuing to make CRAP uploads. Sadly, the movies presented by  will NEVER improve."
