Encoder Notes: We took the liberty of filtering out the audio and rebalancing it. It was really badly hissy and the high end was overcooked. Its still a little high in volume and minor hiss and there's another issue with it. Each channel is left heavy. I.e. there not centered but are played heavy to the left. Its like 3d positional audio gone bad, but other than that nice line :) The video come out very nice indeed, and yes the subs are hardcoded when needed and in sync. Enjoy This Fine Kingdom Release. ;)
