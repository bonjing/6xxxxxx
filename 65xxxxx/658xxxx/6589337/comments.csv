When you do that, you are forcing the staff to move all of them.

Feature films should be uploaded to Movies
TV episodes should be uploaded to TV shows.

Neither belongs in Video > Other, where you have been uploading them.

I have taken away your green skull for now, until you come to your senses.

,shanow2010,2011-08-13T11:14Z,"Dark sections are a bit too dark but other than that very watchable.
A: 8 
V: 8"
,johnyrocker,2011-08-14T15:54Z,"good download watchable but only one problem with this film.

when the apes sign language you can't read the Russian writing  apart from that its a good copy.

audio 8 a very light hissing sound through the film."" very normal for a cam""

video 9 good for a cam little washed out.

it depends on how much you want to see the film wait a few months for the DVD version or watch this best copy out there at the moment ""14/08""2011"""
,cool92,2011-08-14T18:38Z,fantastic quality
,maverickman-fan,2011-08-15T16:32Z,"Yep. Best cam I've seen so far.
Definitely 10-10... although there's a shadow at the start, which looks like an ape... so, all's well."
,tracy1au,2011-08-21T08:13Z,A Very good copy.... Great job... Cheers~!!

,Bufor,2011-09-03T16:46Z,Saw it in theater and was such a great movie I immediately wanted to watch it again. This is probably the best or at least one of the best camrips I've ever seen. Good job uploader!
,jalanforsy,2011-09-06T01:59Z,"V - 8.5
