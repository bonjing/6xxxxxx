Dispatches reporter Oliver Steeds travels the globe to investigate the conservation movement and its
major organizations. Steeds finds that the movement, far from stemming the tide of extinction that's
engulfing the planet, has got many of its conservation priorities wrong.

Should large conservation organizations be involved in eviction, rape and murder to create living space for animals while displacing native people?

Should major conservation projects be re-introducing ugly colonialist attitudes and alienating local populations who can much better help to conserve wildlife?

Do the major conservation groups pander to the publicity needs of corporate greed to self-promote themselves?
Are the major conservation 'brands' cultivating cute, cuddly and colorful projects while ignoring the urgent needs of more strategic, endangered species?

The film examines the way the big conservation charities are run. It questions why some work with
polluting big businesses to raise money and are alienating the very people they would need to stem the loss of species from earth.

Conservation is massively important but few dare to question the movement. Some critics argue that it is in part getting it wrong, and that, as a consequence crucial natural resources are heading to oblivion.
