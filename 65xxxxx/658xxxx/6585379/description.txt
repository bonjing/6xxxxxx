Hello All 

This Is my first Game upload so hopefully all goes well with it. It is an old game but I used to enjoy playing it.


Star Trek: Starfleet Command is a computer game based on the table-top wargame Star Fleet Battles. It simulates starship operations, and ship-to-ship combat and fleet warfare in the Star Trek universe.

The game's design and rules are drawn largely from those of the tabletop wargame Star Fleet Battles. The playable races match those from Star Fleet Battles, as do many ship functions and ship classes, as well as many aspects of gameplay.

The player can play as one of six races:

    United Federation of Planets
    Klingon Empire
    Romulan Star Empire
    Gorn Confederation
    Hydran Kingdoms
    Lyran Star Empire

It is divided into three main parts: a "Campaign" game, "Skirmish" games and a "Multiplayer" game. 

PLATFORM:

Windows 98 / 95 (I did manage to play it on XP once)

Unfortunately I cannot provide any technical Assistance if an error does occur. :(

PLEASE ENJOY AND PLEASE SEED!
