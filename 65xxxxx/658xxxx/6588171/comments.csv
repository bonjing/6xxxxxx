Quality of picture hardly HD but watchable, typically bad set lighting as was the fashion back then but on the whole well performed and interesting from a historical perspective, as was Edward the Seventh which I watched alongside this. Just one WARNING though, that is that the last two episodes are the wrong way around. 6 is labelled ""His borrowed plumes"" but is in fact 7 ""A past and a future"". This confused me as I generally skipped the intro to find Jennie was old, died, yet there was still another episode."
