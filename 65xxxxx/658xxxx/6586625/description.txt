This lovely compilation taken from dates recorded in the mid-1970s presents two of jazzdomâ€™â€˜s great lyricists - the incomparable trumpeter, Chet Baker and the equally incomparable alto saxophonist, Paul Desmond. Both of the principals play superbly. Each note counts. For Desmond, the 1977 tracks - â€œYou Canâ€™â€˜t Go Home Again,â€ â€œIâ€™â€˜m Getting Sentimental Over You,â€ â€œYouâ€™â€˜ve Changedâ€ and â€œHow Deep Is The Ocean?â€ - were, with the exception of a cameo on an Art Garfunkel date, his last recordings. Along with â€œTangerineâ€ and â€œAutumn Leaves,â€ thereâ€™â€˜s also the impressive Don Sebesky arrangement of Joaguin Rodrigoâ€™â€˜s â€œConcierto De Aranjueza,â€ with guitarist Jim Hall, pianist Roland Hanna, bassist Ron Carter and drummer Steve Gadd.
