Quoting Alec Troniq from


"Currently i'm reworking my whole Live Performance Set. A bunch of new great uplifting music and even new self-programmed techniques will be in it.

So I thought I could put out my *OLD* live set - a recording from March of 2011, because the most content is released already. Three parts are still unreleased.

Are you wondering, what actually is a LIVE PA / LIVE ACT / LIVE PERFORMANCE?

I played this live performance at the "Freunde Feiern" event in Puschkin Club, Dresden. It was my first proper live performance in my hometown since maybe two years. The small location was totally overcrowded. We had so much fun together and afterwards everything and everybody was soaked with sweat.

I'd like to thank everybody who joins my liveacts and give credit to my collaborating fellows Raumakustik, Alberto Pascual and Ka.rambolage!
