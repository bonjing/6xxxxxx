Sven Zetterberg is a swedish bluesicon. He's been playing and singing the blues for 30 years. For the last fifteen years he has moved closer and closer to the soulful side of the blues. Geater Davis, Bobby Bland, Tyrone Davis and Spencer Wiggins has been his greatest influences. On his new album, Let Me Get Over It, Sven does masterful interpretations of great soul songs. But the most amazing fact with this cd is that his own songs, and those co-written with the guitarist Anders Lewen, are even better than the covers! Train of love, Dangerous Lonesome Soul and You Took Off With My Life is the best soulblues songs this side of 1980! Sven is also one of the few white soul and blues singers who has found his own style. He's no power shouter like Joe Cocker or Michael Bolton, his vocie is full of emotions and an intense weakness. The result of this unique voice combined with blistering bluesguitar is awesome.  (review, amazon.com)
