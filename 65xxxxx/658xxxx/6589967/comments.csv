,cloud2019,2011-09-13T06:18Z,AWESOME! -- Thank You! -- Opened right up like it was installed already waiting for me to point it o to the discs! - Works great - Very impressed! SO far estimator disc iso image from the big 75gb Mitchell set works great - wil take 4days to 8 weeks to get the other 13 discs to check - thanks again! This little portable stratup program was a big help from the mess of trying to install and activate the regular discs and access floppies I have - such a pain. Awesome!

,capitalz1,2012-05-27T06:48Z,"Hey guys,

The portable works, but the CDs I'm not able to work.
I tried mounting the ISO and then going Update Data, it complains the DVD is not compatible with this version of software.  Add Data is disabled.  I tried setting extracting it to folder and pointing to it on the Setup, and still the portable program keep on asking.  Could somebody tell me how to work this out?

Thanks a bunch"
