Description:

 Debut EP of the new side project from Deftones frontman Chino Moreno and Far 
Guitarist Shaun Lopez. Released on August 2,2011 Moreno Describes it as \"really 
minimal and soothing. Itâ€™s sort of like the stuff I like listening to when Iâ€™m not screaming my head off.â€ This stuff is kind of similar to Team Sleep Yet very different in many ways. It\'s pretty percussion heavy with a lot of spacey, dreamy guitar riffs and Chinos trademark crooning vocals and lyrics. If you\'re into Chino\'s and Shaun\'s other bands then I\'m sure you will dig this, I did. I\'ve included The front and back cover art, as well as another piece of band artwork that I found online,also a picture of Chino and Shaun.
