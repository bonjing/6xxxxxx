It's part of the Gallian Liberation Front campaign to persuade 3rd-party publishers to localize Valkyria Chronicles 3 and the goal to provide a statistics of the fanbase to these publishers. Don't worry, it's not a virus or anything. Thanks a lot!

I'm posting this on other Valkyria torrent as well, sorry for spamming."
