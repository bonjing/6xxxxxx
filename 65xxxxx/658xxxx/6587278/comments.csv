,jolopy,2011-08-06T20:46Z,it would be seriously impressive if someone manages to crack it and release it today. i will make a shrine for you if you do and you will be remembered by all for eternity
,Jimstalk,2011-08-06T20:47Z,the size is correct.....I must inform you guys that the activation for the ngx is not beeing made from the executable.In order to activate it youll have to load the plane and then a popup window will appear which will ask for your serial.You MUST HAVE an internet connection to proceed....
,F.B.I,2011-08-06T21:24Z,"@Jim jim i was thinking the old method that was used to crack the 747, you know adding the pmdg conection details to a windows file, i cant remember what file it is of the top of my head, but im sure you know!!"

,Jimstalk,2011-08-06T22:30Z,Yeah i know but you also had to add some information to the registry.The trick with the file you say may work but it wont do the job because i cannot find my PMDG 737ngx in regedit.exe.They have added some kind of encryption i think...I know its complicated enough but there must be a way to find these .reg keys

But ill be on tomoz now as i cnt be arsed to watch me dwnload speed @ 0.1 mbs"
,MajorWales,2011-08-07T00:04Z,"@F.B.I we're downloading it so when the crack comes, we already have the .exe to install... all we have to do is add the crack!"
,u55g,2011-08-07T01:42Z,"Jim and FBI, sorry but you won't crack this thing.

I've been looking at it for the past 24 hours and it'll need someone with actual knowledge to do it. It's not just registry, it's process activation executables in the background, XML calls to remote server for initial activation, encrypted trusted data storage for licensing etc.

Good luck."
,jolopy,2011-08-07T02:19Z,"Maybe DCrack can come back and crack it? Let me cast the DCrack summoning spell:

,Jimstalk,2011-08-07T02:58Z,"DCrack?What makes you think that he could crack stuff? Probably He was a senior member at wickedfriends dot com....Trust me tpb looks like drugs. For example Dcrack and me are the drug dealers and we give you what you want.But these drugs are not made from us.The producer (cracker) is the guy who makes this stuff.Komu was the ONLY user in tpb who achieved to be producer&dealer.Well this is really dangerous because the cops can find you. As far as i know komu got busted some months ago....So dont request the ngx if theres no fuckin prOducer out there.,,FBI and I will do our best but the ppl from PMDG worked really well on this project. The encryption they use seems like a labyrinth to me so please DO NOT depend on me cuz im sittin'  around 30 hours in front of my monitor and   Cannot even find the fuckin reg keys. And now every time i try to launch the ngx with FSP i get a fattal error and then fsx shuts down. 

P.S If you guys think that DCrack can do the trick then please tell me WHY did he not achieve to crack the concorde?"
,alexmorph3us,2011-08-07T03:23Z,That would be something :))) 
,alexmorph3us,2011-08-07T03:29Z,However is there a way someone could contact DCrack and tell him that we need his help ?

It seems this is where all the stuff is happening, could somebody let me know if removing the .dll above works for u!!! "

I cracked this plane half but still black gauges and no fan blades, don't worry guys I am giving my best to crack this bird. I won't upload a torrent but will just give you instructions on how to crack it, so keep on reading comments and don't forget that I am a human only so it may take a long time for me also and in the mean any other person may crack it, there isn't any competition, we just need this bird for free. I know that we ain't that poor that we can't afford it but still majority of us including me hesitate to put their credit card information over the web.

,u55g,2011-08-07T18:15Z,"I never said I could do it, I said you couldn't.

The DLLs themselves aren't activated, you need to remove licensing calls to other modules from them. There's no such thing as an ""activated"" DLL."

,F.B.I,2011-08-07T19:05Z,@u55g i maybe getting some activated .dlls from someone :-)
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-08-07T19:07Z,"I have figured out how to crack this software. The method I am going to write is theoretically correct, however I haven't tried it yet, but I will give you results as early as possible.

Before that, I want to tell that in this installer I have found that all the security or activation files that PMDG has made lies either in registry or in other hidden folders, they can not interfere in working of DLLs until and unless they aren't present, simple huh!!!

So, first thing is that, we are going to create a RIP of all the files, but it ain't easy, PMDG is really clever and even if you change the installation directory, the NGX would be installed in the location where FSX is installed, indirectly wherever it's entry in registry lies, for that purpose we are going to use a simple tool:

http://fullterrain.com/hotfixes_patches/FSX_Registry_Fix.zip

'FSX registry fix'
So just simply change your FSX location for a while until you get all the NGX files.

Now just backup them in your pen drive or anywhere in HDD and use CCleaner to uninstall NGX completely.

Then paste all the files in your FSX directory and check if it works or not?

NOTE: I can say that it's theoretically correct because when I renamed the Gauges, and ran all of them, the activation was bypassed but plane wasn't fully working, so when I renamed them to original gauges, everything worked but that error message was freezing my FSX when clicking fly now, this incidence proves that there isn't any licensing module on DLLs. "
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-08-07T19:09Z,"@FBI really, man you are a god, then it would be simple to crack this thing. I hope you get them. Best wishes from my side!"
,gerrarditto,2011-08-07T19:39Z,"@NvidiaPhysX
Well, I've tried right now this sollution, but I can't change the defauld location with that folder.
I've created a new fsx.exe file on a folder from my desktop, and I used that program to locate the exe file. At the end it tolds me that the fsx location has been updated.
Afterthis, I ran the setup for PMDG, but it still installing on the defauld FSX location."
,MajorWales,2011-08-07T19:50Z,"im trying what @F.B.I said and am following his tutorial. its going well, but i found some files that wanted to be overwritten... so i guess that its still putting some files in the FSX directory - but im not too sure if the uninstaller uninstalls all other files."
,MajorWales,2011-08-07T19:55Z,"it sorta works, but you have to install key - i know i aint got the cracked/modded dll's yet, but i thought it may be of use... not that it will with ones that are modded anyway xD"

,u55g,2011-08-07T21:00Z,"@FBI, there is NO SUCH THING as ""activated DLLs"". The licensing is managed by the Flexera modules and stored in an encrypted location in C:\ProgramData. Stop going on about ""activated DLLs"".

,u55g,2011-08-07T23:09Z,"@People who say I'm wrong, you cannot rewrite DLLs successfully from inside installers, etc, you can only patch calls to other methods or libraries to prevent things like activation or licensing from occuring.

The PMDG/Flexera authentication is obtained by contacting the remote server, and receiving valid strings of authenticated data back for each key, enabling certain 'switches' in the secure storage of the Flexera licensing, located where I said in my last post.

What you'll need to do is patch the DLLs to remove any authentication. The DLLs you have from the install are the same that everyone else with an authenticated product has, just some other feature in the system (not registry) has been altered to suit some calls in either NGX.dll or NGX_2.dll or others."

Last evening I bypassed the .dll activation the same way as you did now, figured somebody would discover it eventually also. I regd here so we maybe could discuss this matter better.

It seems the clever guys at PMDG have merged some kind of failsafe voodoo shit in there, so that in case of activation bypass it clamps on certain failures.

Well the few problems occur from PMDG_737NGXdll file.. This controlls everythin except the HUD and TCAS..6800ultra make sure you didnt edit anything that is need which could stop the annimation process...."
,ek1,2011-08-08T03:29Z,"So I found a link to a supposedly cracked .dll file on the other torrent. But after the installation when I went to launch the aircraft it asked me for a password, which it turned out was nowhere to be found"
,Solarflexlanka,2011-08-08T03:52Z,"@6800ultra Woke up a few minutes ago...Tried the crack...it works well except for the Engines..Im pretty sure this failure is set by PMDG..

When i used SLEW mode ( Y ) the engines were running...strange..."
,UnkownFlyer,2011-08-08T09:10Z,For me the engines worked BEFORE the crack. And now its the other way around. I trust the crackers to  fix this fast
,bgsoft,2011-08-08T09:24Z,"Not only engines. I'm tryed from C&D panel state and when click on battery swich and nothing. Same happens with external power. I tried to plug it in to the mains electricity power al nista, still nothing (just kidding :)). Apu works but no blue lights on above apu gen power switches... I do not understand the process of cracking, but I think we need more work to be done on the other two dll files.

,captsi,2011-08-08T11:29Z,"@F.B.I

it seems if u bypass the activation pmdg has been clever and clamped on some failures and it seems with the current crack that animations are missing such as flap animations and overhead panel lights etc etc."
,F.B.I,2011-08-08T11:34Z,@6800ultra @u55g  is there anyway i can talk to you guys maybe we can all worr together on this??
,F.B.I,2011-08-08T11:41Z,"from what iv read somewhere else PMDG/FLEXnet Hides a licence file on your computer somewhere, when it loads the first .dll it looks for that licence, if no licence then it the goes straight to the 2nd .dll calling for the activation, which then goes to common files to run the programme to activate your pmdg 737 of a remote server, when activated the remote server unlocks something in the first .dll, this is just an idea of the top of my head whats going on!!"
,Solarflexlanka,2011-08-08T11:57Z,@ F.B.I. Then how was 6800ultra able to build up a .dll file which didnt load up a activation module...The only problem with it is the engines...( which might be controlled from a different file)
,F.B.I,2011-08-08T12:12Z,"@Solarflexlanka  thats why i need to speak to him, i need to know how he got to read the .dll, i have some c++ coding knowelede so maybe able to help alittle more!!"
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-08-08T12:16Z,"I am very close to crack this, you just need to delete the commands from DLLs that check validation or you may simply retrieve the serial number from PIDKEY which is in Windows installer property."

,6800ultra,2011-08-08T15:19Z,"@NvidiaPhysX
I've done it in that way, maybe it helps you:
 in the TPB-Comments someone said that the J41 have the same protection like the ngx, so i've looked at the J41 dll-file and copared the original j41-dll with the cracked j41-dll in a hex editor. I found out that there are 3 values changes, from ""C0 74""  to ""C0 EB"". So ove looked for those  kinda values in the ngx-dll, and i found them.
The problem is, that there are no only 3 values of ""C0 74"", so ive just tried out changing some values.  Just compare the original dll with my cracked in a hex editor and you will see my changes."
,RoxxyFly,2011-08-08T15:22Z,"@NvidiaPhysX

Tried the RIP method earlier.. no luck... I fiddled around with the FnpCommsSoap, and I believe it has little to do with the actual activation process. Better just leave that one alone.

This should be crackable the same way as JS4100, as it used flexnet protection also. The HEX string to call up activation is identical, so we just need to locate the shit that messes up all the systems (unless somebody comes up with a different approach).

To remove activation process execution from the first DLL:

1. Open the file in hex editor (such as hxd, I used that)

2. Search for hex string 52 56 50 E8 E5 59 0F 00 83 C4 1C 85 C0 74

3. After you've located it change the last value (74) to EB

4. VoilÃ¡! Activation won't pop up BUT systems are somewhat phucked.."

,u55g,2011-08-08T15:29Z,"@RoxxyFly, you're right to say leaving FnpCommsSoap alone. It only handles the SOAP/XML calls to the activation server, nothing to do with the actual activation."

,Vermos,2011-08-08T21:27Z,"Here are one question from forum:

""In trying to install some addon ai aircraft, I carelessly delete some FSX files and now wish to reinstall FSX, not just repairing it, just to be safe. I got the Ngx the day it came out, and had zero problems with it, but after reading the beginning of the intro document, I decided to reinstall FSX into a c:/FSX directory as the guide recommended, so I had to uninstall the Ngx. When I went to reinstall it, it didn't ask me to activate again? This this take away one of my activations, and when I reinstall it again will it take another one away? ""

And the answer is:

""It didn't ask you to activate because you don't need to activate the NGX each time. It's not like the MD-11 and products prior to that, you only need to activate the NGX the first time, then you should be good to go unless you reformat. So don't worry about it taking away your activations.""

So there are some hidden files in the system that holds activation code. "

You obviously have not clue either. I used to work for a company that licensed FlexLM. It cost us a lot more than thousands. And I'll tell you something else. To this day, none of these elite hackers you speak of have EVER managed to crack it. Not that you'd want to after all these years, but every single customer that used our product paid nearly $500 per head to do so. And if you really think you can afford to hire marketing staff, programmers, support personnel, etc and not being making a lot more than ""thousands"", you are completely nuts. I realize 9 out of the 10 comments here are cringe-worthy in terms of their displayed ignorance (a team of hackers cracked this within 24 hours, yeah right!), but yours really stands out."

Yes, of course you're right!   No one can ever crack a Flexnet-licensed product - it's an impenetrable fortress of uncompromisable security.   This is indeed the very end of piracy and copyright infringement as we know it.   Damn you I say, damn you to hell!   You, sir, obviously possess the wisdom of Solomon and the tenacity of Job, the genius of Tesla, the innovation of Edison.   And also more realistically the naivety of Moe, Larry, and Curly...       Gee, what other PMDG products have used Flexnet in the past (while we're on the subject)?    Well, a quick perfunctory search of ALL previous PMDG products available here on TPB reveals each and every one has been fully cracked, Flexnet license or not.    Waka, waka, waka.    "

If your software using flex has never been cracked, why the fuck are you on TPB? If you work for a software company this would be the last place you'd be seen. And the reason it isn't cracked because its probably some shitty software nobody wants or is free in the first place. Go shove a tampon down your throat and stfu"
,UnkownFlyer,2011-08-11T20:20Z,Guys! We should not fight with each other! We are all here for the crack so lets get it! Go to famous crackers and request a crack. Try to look over google for forums etc. in other languages like russian or chinese. They seem to get real far with this to. But I think that our best shot lies in requesting cracks at more famous crackers or forums.
,xpycxpyc,2011-08-11T23:27Z,I went to some Chinese and Russian forums but even them can't find the solution for the moment.
,LarsLaur,2011-08-11T23:43Z,"To end the entire can be cracked, cannot be cracked debate.
It is simple, if it is popular like lets say Call of Duty games, the crackers swarm it and it is a fast and quick job.

But if it is not popular, like a small program from an unknown vendor... Well, it won't be because it isn't in the path of popularity.
And since FSX is old, nowadays the major pro crackers have moved on, so there is a lot of ""lost knowledge"" and lack of interest.
If PMDG's products have been as popular as Call Of Duty... You can bet on that the crack rate would have gone through the roof EXPONETIALLY!"
,xpycxpyc,2011-08-12T00:05Z,"Here's what I found on one Chinese forum:
""Today mounted on NGX, found the break to take the identical protection and JS4100, JS4100 so I look through the crack, only a DLL, that I thought of whether such a DLL NGX also has a validation step, etc. inside it, and is I look through the next JS4100 that the DLL directory, GAUGE / under, and sure enough I found PMDGNGX the DLL, but 45 times the size of JS4100 = =. . . I first opened the JS4100 with PE EXPLORER's DLL, decompile found such a text which referred LICENSE (license certificate?) and then I opened the NGX DLL files, which anti-compiled and are so found the same two items from such places we could find a breakthrough to get rid of it NGX protection? (Just a personal guess ....)"""
,UnkownFlyer,2011-08-12T00:05Z,"Yeah, your right... I also have tried to look at chinese an russian forums but all I get is the same progress as we have here. I wish we could contact a big cracker form larger games but they dont give a damn about fsx I think. All we can do is rely on the crackers we have here that pretty much already gave up. 6800ultra and F.B.I. gave it up but I didnt hear anything from NvidiaPhysX yet I think. And I didn't hear anything about Dcrack even working on this job. I hope something will happen soon."
,xpycxpyc,2011-08-12T00:51Z,"I hope someone will find a way, PMDG really did a good job on this one, but I hope within a month this will be cracked."
,F.B.I,2011-08-12T08:59Z,"@6800ultra mate you dont knwo how close you are to cracking this!!! Your more experienced than me, but i can tell you all you need to restore in the hex/.dll is find a way of restoring FULL POWER to the aircraft and walla fully activated!!! you will not believe how long i was looking threw bloody hex last night. All i need to know is where that string was that you found that actiavted the gauges as i feel thats where the power supply lies for the ngx too. I already tried looking threw the string that u posted in your first patch but it couldnt find the string!!"
,F.B.I,2011-08-12T09:01Z,"Guys the patch that @6800ultra is about 90% fully cracked, the engines wont spool up cause theres not enough power running the the aircraft, if theres not enough power theres not going to be enough pressure for the engines. seriously guys itsnot that far off, just cause i have brought it, doesnt mean im not working on it for you guys!!"
,clintferns,2011-08-12T09:09Z,hey this might sound stupid...but can you try connecting it to ground power and then try starting the engines...or instead...load another aircraft that has the system running...and then select the pmdg aircraft ngx... :)
,john5706,2011-08-12T10:03Z,"@F.B.I

Yes there is a problem for the engines but if you do it right you can reach 28.6% N2 (using APU bleed) and then when you open the fuel valve nothing appends. But for me that's not a pressure problem (N2 is high enough to start and to avoid a Hot Start), it's more an electrical or fuel problem (no fuel injection or no ignition inside the engine). 
I think that's more an electrical problem because a lot of electrical things doesn't work (FMCs, captain NAV, electrical panel from the overhead panel seems to be not working (if you switch APU GEN ON, that's doesn't really work)
If you load the plane Cold And Dark (via the CDU) then nothing works."
,perckypick,2011-08-12T10:12Z,"To all the people trying to crack it:

I have no idea how to hack or crack things, otherwise I would be more than willing to help. That being said, a word of advice (please don't take this as condenscending, just a word of warning). When you test the aircraft in-game, FOLLOW THE MANUAL/PROCEDURES. The NGX is obviously a highly-complex aircraft, and it is entirely possible that things like control-E or just hitting the starters will not work, even in a legit copy. Open the manual, find the checklist to start the aircraft, and follow it! I just think it would be bad if ya'll actually succesfully cracked the aircraft, yet stayed under the impression that it was un-cracked because you were improperly operating it in-game. 

'Tis all. Carry on :D"
,xpycxpyc,2011-08-12T12:13Z,Thank you FBI!
,frkaipanika385,2011-08-12T12:41Z,"@Perckypick... Of course nobody is trying with CTRL E
There is some problem with electrics. Because if you switch off everything in aircraft then you cannot switch on battery or get ground power to have any influence. IRS is not having power.
FMC is possible to switch on ...but not possible to enter data. 
6800ultra made some cool failure feature :) 
Not even Boeing engeneers could repair this bird to fly. 
What i read the only solution is that ultra6800 and FBI should work together... as a team. A-Team :)"
,UnkownFlyer,2011-08-12T12:51Z,Only problem is that they both already gave up on this one
,frkaipanika385,2011-08-12T13:21Z,"I installed HOT FIX that PMDG issued yesterday.

,vaios123,2011-08-12T14:33Z,"i think 6800ultra just might got the first dll to a full
i strongly suspect that there are more triggers in the 2nd dll, and might be the main activation dll since its stamped  as a ""flexnet"" dll while the first is stamped as fsx gauges, i think the first activation is from the first dll, and than the plane might check itself everytime u use it after ""activation"" using the 2nd dll."
,F.B.I,2011-08-12T14:39Z,"Ahhhh the hot fix, that .dll must think there is a licence already intslled, maybe if i remove that check all system might work!! As im thinking there is no call for the flexnet server in the hot fix cause why would somebody who hasnt brought it need a hot fix!! Best check the file size of both .dlls"
,vaios123,2011-08-12T14:46Z,"i just found another thing, the first dll exports some gauge creation functions along with the entry point, while the 2nd only exports two fnp libs, libFNP_2 and libFNP_3, i dont know if this means we have been wasting time on the first dll."
,frkaipanika385,2011-08-12T15:30Z,"Yeah... HOTFIX rules!!
F.B.I. that would be funny if this solution works..."
,6800ultra,2011-08-12T15:31Z,"""i think 6800ultra just might got the first dll to a full""
....

to make it clear: I dont work on that crack anymore, i ve never cracked anything other and my initial crack release was just a work of 10 min, comparing the DLLs of the J41 and appy that to the ngx DLLs, without really knowing what i do. 
I dont have any other ideas, i dont understand disassembler and so on. Trial and Error is also not possible on more that 100.000 pages of hex-code !

So please, when there is nobody other then me, who try to crack this, then there is nobody, please understand that. Maybe we will see a crack from a cracker-crew, who knows what to do. 

So again ladies, I'm off. 
So please stop yelling at me.

Regards, 6800ultra"

Problem: all screens black (more like BLANK) can not turn any knobs in VC or 2D pit. Looks like the crack did not work for me!

@berzerk2 Offcourse we tried turning the systems on, but since i can NOT twist any knob, or click on any button in the plane, i guess it must be the crack.

So once again, anyone who has had this and solved it, please let me know! "

hotfix solves this problem, but you have to crack PMDG737NGX.dll again. Use instructions that 6800ultra posted yesterday. Also, turn on DX10 in FSX."

,jimbob493,2011-08-14T19:39Z,DX10 is a piece of shit in FSX. Its buggy as fuck. Leave it off as per PMDG recommendations. And technically the hotfix is pointless for this crack because majority of freezes come from the .dll that is cracked. So we're overwriting the new .dll with a cracked old one so really the hotfix does very little for us. Unless someone wants to go crack the hotfix .dll?
