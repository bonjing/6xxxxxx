Trust me, THIS IS NOT WINDOWS 7. Windows 7 is build 7600, this build is 7989. It does have the same installation screen as Windows 7 (A few tweaks to it), but this is not Windows 7. there are a few new features, for example a new bootscreen, a new 'lock' menu near the corner, the titles are centered, and the genuine center. Once you have installed this, go to youtube . com / TheAeroHacker and watch the Windows 8 video. It will instruct you on how to remove the timebomb and unlock more hidden features...

Most WinVista/ Win7 Apps will run on this. the only programs I've had issues with is 
Firefox constantly crashing, and no sound in google chrome. IE9 works fine though




And yes, I know I have other torrents that say "Milestone 3" but those are actually Milestone 2. I made a mistake while creating those torrents. I would've changed the name but for The Pirate Bay won't let me rename them...
