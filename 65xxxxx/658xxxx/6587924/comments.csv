,naeem42,2011-08-07T07:22Z,hey there is no windows 8 on microsft 
,TheAeroHacker,2011-08-07T09:02Z,"@mruniverse00 - This only works on computers with a 64-Bit processor

@naeem42 - Of course it isn't. There is no such thing as a fully finished Windows 8. This is just a milestone, which means it's not even close to being finished, they still have a lot of work to do on it (e.g. metro start menu, html5 apps, internet explorer 10, etc. etc.) so these milestones are basically just to keep people entertained for a while until the actually Windows 8 comes out on the market (and by 'the market' I'm talking about the pirate bay)"
