Alot of movies on here I don't particulary like but I'm not after a critique of the movie.

We are all more interested in the quality.

Is it watchable?

I never would've thought these PSP, iPod movies would be any good.  But I've been playing them
on a HD LCD 40"" TV and the quality is awesome despite the size.

I live in Australia have ADSL2+ so they each take me like 5-10mins to download. I have a download cap of 150mb per month and it costs me money if I go over or I can deal with 512k speed shaping. So size is always a concern when downloading and despite the size I reckon these movies are as good as any 700mb XviD.

720p movies and 1.5 to 5gb downloads are great if u got the bandwidth but for your 10 720p movies I can download twice or more as many."
