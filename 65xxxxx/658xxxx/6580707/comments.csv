,JD74,2011-08-04T02:08Z,"I agree. Although the quality is amazing for such a low bitrate, 1280*544 is FAR from being 1080p."
,moshster,2011-08-04T14:09Z,You're both mistaken.  This is 1080P.  1080P doesn't exclusively mean 16:9 movies.  Cinemascope movies are still 1080P even if some of it is black bars.  1080P should not be taken literaly.
,benlalonde,2011-08-04T15:30Z,"Gentlemen, I'm disappointed with the ratio comments. Simple math: 1920 / 2.35 (or 2.40) = 817 to 800. Therefore, a 1080P in PANAVISION will be 1920x800. Hence forth, 1280x544 is 720P in Panavision. The remainder of missing lines to complete either 1080P or 720P will be complimented with black bars top and bottom on a 16:9 native screens.

Cool?
