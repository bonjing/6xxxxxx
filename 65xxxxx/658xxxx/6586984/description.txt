This is a large torrent, comprised of my collection of radio productions (and a few audiobooks) which STAR police inspectors. You will not find Inspector Japp, Inspector Lestrade or their ilk here. They are merely players in their respective universes. Yes, i know about the Inspector Lestrade novels, but I choose not to include any Inspector who has not also has a radio production of his/her adventures. 

There are more than eighty Inspectors featured here, with productions from the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, and South Africa. 

This torrent will take a while to seed and I have no objection to cherry-pickers selecting portions, as long as they SEED the portions that they select. 

Much, although not all, of this work has been on Demonoid before in torrents that I posted four years ago (now dead). If you have any of those, feel free to seed them along with me. 

And, finally, thanks to all the original cappers and Usenet posters who provided source material for this omnibus.
