  Notes:

  Back in the days when it was all about white label tracks and unknown mixtapes,
  there was one particular italian producer/dj that stood out.
  Maurizio Colella, better known as EDX,hit the EDM radar in 1994.
  About 15 years later, he has become one of the most requested remixers,
  having put this magical touch on tracks by Deadmau5, Armin van Buuren, 
  Steve Angello, Laidback Luke, Kaskade, Funkagende, Lauryn Hill, Bob Sinclar 
  and many, many more.

  But there's more to the Swiss based talent than just his impressive list of remixes.
  Besides being a successful label owner, he also caused waves with his very own originals,
  from 'Hoover'to 'Out Of The Rain'to 'Casa Grande'and 'Embrace'.
  When it comes to DJ'ing, there's not a lot of venues in the world he hasn't seen yet.

  In the summer of 2011, with the Ibiza season in full swing, he returns to his roots.
  He presents a brand new mix album, made of nothing but the best progressive-house tracks of today.
  No Xcuses stands for the summer sound of 2011!
