[T],thetorrentlord,2011-08-06T03:06Z,Did you consider that if there are only 5-8 leechers on a file of this size it will take quite a while b-4 anyone will be able to complete the D/L and be a FULL seeder. Also dependent on your original upload speed. I face the same problem on my less popular torrents. Just try to be patient with the downloaders.
[V],Nepotu,2011-08-06T13:53Z,"@thetorrentlord: Thanks for your attention. I DON'T MEAN THIS PARTICULAR TORRENT. I know that takes a while to complete the DL. I'm not stupid. I mean all torrents in general. And when I see that my good intentions are treated with indifference and with selfishness I think that not worth the effort. If I think of you, uploading rare things, I expect some help (not to me but to the others like you). If you, guys, (80% from USA) don't give a f...k (not you, thetorrentlord, in particular), you don't worth my effort. If after 2 days I'm the only seeder, with who I must to be patient? I don't have enough space in HDD to seed in all my torrents and for that I asked a little help. FOR YOU. So I can bring you more of this. But no one understood that if they want more, I need more help by SEEDING. And than, am I right or not?"

[T],thetorrentlord,2011-08-06T22:11Z,"@ Nepotu: I have the same problem, as I have tons more stuff than I can host on my HD. So I am just very choosy about what I upload. On the more obscure torrents it takes weeks to seed. My first large torrent 45GB took over a month to seed just to 1:1. Just keep doing what you can. I have grabbed all your torrents and will watch them once BBall starts."
[V],Nepotu,2011-08-06T22:25Z,"@JOR23: Gracias compaĂąero! Como siempre, un buen amigo. Gracias por tus palabras! Siempre sabes poner el dedo en la llaga. :) Estoy pensando en parar o no de subir estos partidos. Me sabe mal de que la gente no entiende que haya 10000 seeders no importa si hay o no otro seeder, pero cuando hay 1 o 2 seeders, si todos pensamos solo por los suyos... Que Dios sea siempre a tu lado Jordan! And welcome!"
[V],Nepotu,2011-08-06T22:53Z,"@thetorrentlord: Anytime I start to think: don't worth it, always appear someone to make me reconsider. Someone like you, like JOR23, like mma4me... Thank you for your good toughts! God bless you!"
