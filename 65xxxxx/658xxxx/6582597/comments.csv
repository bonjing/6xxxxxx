What is the deal between you and anoXmous ?"
[V],GoodFilms,2011-08-05T15:27Z,"anoxmous has many problems, the biggest being that he's an UTTER BULLSHITTER who can't admit when he's wrong."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-08-06T02:48Z,ignore anoxmous. he's just parroting me. kids shouldn't be allowed internet access in my opinion.
