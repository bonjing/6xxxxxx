Sorry for the last torrent. I looked up the problem and people said maybe a thumbs.db file got in it or something that caused it to stop at 99% for everyone. Instead of making it a Dmg I changed it to a .zip so this time it might work a lot better for everyone. Just so you know I will be seeding the whole time its up but probably not at full capacity because it makes my xbox live shitty. If it gets stuck at 99% again I wont try uploading it again. Sorry for all the problems, I'm a noob at creating torrents.
