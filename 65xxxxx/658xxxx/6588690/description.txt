Passmark PerformanceTest is a software tool that allows everybody to quickly assess the performance of his or her computer and compare it to a number of standard 'baseline' computer systems. This program is a little difference to another benchmark programs because it designed to be small enough that it's possible to run from a floppy disk. This means you can take it with you when you go out shopping for a new or second hand PC. The other major advantage is the built in base line results that enable a reasonable comparison to be made between computer systems. The results are presented as easy to read bar charts so that you don't need to spend hours studying the numbers to know the result. Timing for the tests is done using high resolution timers, which are accurate to approximately 1 millionth of a second on most PC's.
