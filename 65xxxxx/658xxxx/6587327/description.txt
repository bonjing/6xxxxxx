Release Notes:

All music is innocent until proven guilty. To triangulate
our sound, pick up signals from Kraftwerk, The B-52's and
Goldfrapp. Or think of a half-remembered fever dream
featuring Ferris Bueller and Grace Jones.
All bands are transient. The album 'Fatty Gets A Stylist'
was mostly written and recorded on a lap top over several
months in the different locations we found ourselves in
between Australia, South East Asia and our loft which is
unfashionably located in West London.
Our singer's name is Kate Miller-Heidke. Her name may
sound familiar but her voice will not. Not even her own
band recognised she was Fatty's singer because of the
unusual use of her lower register. Keir Nuttall is a guy
who programs and produces.
Other musicians include bass player Justin Meladl-Johnsen
(Air, Beck, Nine Inch Nails) and drummer Pete McNeal
(Cake). Mickey Petralia (Flight of the Conchords, Back,
The Eels) engineered and played percussion on much of the
record.
'Fatty Gets A Stylist', the album, was mixed by Cenzo
Townsend, a modern hero of the art of mixing and
responsible for sculpting influences of ours such as
Florence and The Machine, Bloc Party and Editors. He is
such a genius they gave him an O.B.E. Or was it a Brit
Award? Same thing. We were lucky enough to persuade him
(it did take some bribery) to mix our record.
We practice loose, Western Zen, drink martinis and enjoy
nose-to-tail dining.
