[T],soupucia,2011-08-04T22:25Z,I sincerely hope this is the final release for this game. Should fix the saving game problem the previous release had. DirectX problems should be fixed with an update to the latest version. Enjoy the game~

""The application failed to initialize properly(0xc0000005).Click on OK to terminate the application ""
help plz "
,Amegon,2011-08-05T15:55Z,"First Limbo version without virus, great :)
game works completely.

@jackayb
If you cannot start it because of a dx...dll, install directx 9 (google, microsoft, webinstaller, about 70MB download during installation, you can do it)

@whitephantom
To change the resolution, change it in windows. The game should run in the resolution you are using in windows

@sa3atsky
press left/right a few times (the real direction arrows). then his eyes should open and after 20 seconds you can move"
,Tybalt86,2011-08-05T16:07Z,"same here , if i run the exe or the launcher ""nothing happens"" ... bullshit upload"
,lklttt,2011-08-05T19:52Z,"@Tybalt86 
its not a bullshit upload...the torrent is clean and working. in the earlier versions problem of saving was there but this one has fixed it.
All those having a blank or a black screen....u just need to update your directx...i dont care if u have directx11 or 10, u just need to update it which will definitely fix the problem...   .and dont go about complaining and criticising the uploader if u are too shitty to make the game work.its your fault not his...
heres the link to update the directx>>>>>http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=35
thnxxx a lot soupacia..i had been waiting for this a long time"

,THE_ROBBA,2011-08-08T07:50Z,"I got the game working, I bought it for $10 lol... it's a cool looking game with cool puzzles but it's a pretty short game... especially when you use a walk through for most of it lol"

Solution?"
,EndFED,2011-08-08T22:46Z,The game has no colors what should I do?

,Noname017,2011-08-10T00:15Z,"Unleashed failed again! In this release the secret level (ch. 25) is already unlocked without the need to collect eggs.

The game was working fine and got no issue on my computer but the false-positive still annoys me. soupucia has a skull meaning that all his releases are clean but maybe this one really got something in it even if it wasn't soupucia fault.
