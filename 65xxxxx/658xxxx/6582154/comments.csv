,tyecita,2011-08-06T01:14Z,"@4skinn I'll upload more little bill and team umizoomi season 1 and few that are pending of season 2 since i'm doing so many shows on my own that involves editing/converting/recording and on top of all that uploading! uploading takes so long and so many download the file and DON'T SEED! so it involves me having to upload slowly it'll take 2-3 days for a file to have at least 2-4 seeders.

PLEASE SEED! I DON'T MIND DOING ALL THIS FOR NOTHING BUT I NEED YOUR GUYS HELP!

About your other question, yes i do know of the amanda show, but since i'm focusing only on children/preschool shows because i saw a huge necessity for it. So many people care only for the adult shows and not for the children. 

But I'll look into your request and if i could obtain it, i'll let you know :D"
