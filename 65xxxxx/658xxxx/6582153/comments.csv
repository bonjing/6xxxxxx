,Mikeydunn420,2011-08-04T12:19Z,can any1 confirm this is legit if so i will seed for long time
,DangerDan43257,2011-08-04T12:27Z,"if its KaOs its legit, thnx for adding it gansuk. love these guyz work."
,scyris99,2011-08-04T12:33Z,"Seem's Legit, the uploader has mutiple other torrents too, and torrents uploaded by someone with a Skull icon usually means its legit, least from my experence. it seems he downsampled the audio and video's to greatly reduce the filesize."
,jezba112,2011-08-04T13:03Z,Hell Yeah Finally found  A KaOs One!Thanks Gansuk/KaOs! :)
,DangerDan43257,2011-08-04T13:13Z,"yeah the description says movies are 1/2 the size of the original, and from my experience with kaos releases the movies are always a nice watchable quality and they probbly compressed the games audio data just the same as when u mp3/rip a audio cd. its a good idea and you cant tell the difference in quality but save alot on the total filesize."
,Mikeydunn420,2011-08-04T13:53Z,yep its legit thank you everyone!!!
,1TWISTED,2011-08-04T15:23Z,"thanks,.. nice upload,... well done,.. ; )"

,dysphunktion,2011-08-05T08:20Z,"This works great. I actually bought it this title, however. Downloaded it for a friend. For being an indie game from a lesser-known developer, it's really quite good. A very nice mix of HL2/Deus Ex here. It could use some work to flesh out a lot of bugs (lots of random crashes, never the same crash twice for me) and to help smooth over various little details. Overall a very fun game and well worth the 17 US dollars for it."
,click2shaan,2011-08-05T18:37Z,"nice upload!!!
thankzz buddy!!"
,DangerDan43257,2011-08-06T14:07Z,"i dunno if anybody else noticed but as nice as the installer is, it installs to the wrong location the files extract to c:\ rather than c:\games like normal ;)

,Atlas91,2011-08-08T18:59Z,Does this come with the patch? A couple of days after it released the developer made a major overhaul fixing and improving a lot of things.

,5bux,2011-12-24T06:42Z,"Works fine! You can Co-op Lan easily with this one.

Co-op Lan = 1st player create server, 2nd player log into single player mode, then open console with ~, then type in ""connect [1st player IP]"", wait while it configures, then play. Great team game."
,tahwos,2012-01-07T21:04Z,"I keep getting a ""problem connecting to tracker"" error no matter what torrent of this game I try to download.  Any suggestions?"
,tahwos,2012-01-07T22:46Z,Nevermind...was only using BitTornado.  Downloaded Miro and works fine.  *Newbie*!
,tiz2,2012-03-14T23:01Z,"For LAN you need the developer console, and for me the ""~""-key was not set to open it as the default setting, but if you open the file found at this location ""x:/EYE/EYE/cfg/config.cfg "", and edit the line: bind ""x"" ""toggleconsole"", you can set it to what ever you want.
