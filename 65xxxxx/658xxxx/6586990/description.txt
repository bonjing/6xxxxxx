Offering bracketing bonuses on this follow-up album are the "ITV" and 
"Full" versions of the stately "Morse Theme". Barrington Pheloung's new 
material then swings between airy strings ("The Warmer Side of Morse"), 
and chilly piano phrases ("Gently Sinister Revelation"). If sequenced 
together, the portrait of Morse is of a most tranquil mind at sea while 
swimming about for clues ("Lewis & Morse"). Setting the Inspector's 
cogitative juices flowing are the following pieces from his treasured 
classical collection: Vivaldi's Concerto for Two Mandolins, selections 
from Mozart's Don Giovani and CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte, Bach's Chorale "Er Kenne 
Mich Mein Huter", and Puccini's "Signore, Ascolta!". The booklet kindly 
details the action and thinking behind the cues, and properly credits 
Pheloung's involvement in each classical piece. If you enjoyed Volume 1, 
there's no reason not to get the sequel.
