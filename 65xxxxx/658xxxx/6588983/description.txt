While Blade and Motoko discuss their plans a familiar belonging to Frosts 
pureblood vampire visitor appears and confirms that Frost can be found in 
the Sumatran Mountains. On their arrival at Mount Subayak they discover a 
mine being run by Existence. While scouting the mine they encounter a 
local Shamen, called Agus, who asks them to follow him and see something 
important. He Tells them how the Vampires have been taking humans as slaves 
to mine silver for them, his wife  had been taken and turned before he could 
rescue her but he has been attempting to return her humanity by feeding her 
holy water that he has blessed but Blade does not belive it is possible. 
Once again they are visited by the Pureblood, in person this time, who 
introduces himself as Lucius Isaac, He taunts them and claims curing a turned 
human is impossible while easily evading their attacks. During the Daylight 
Blade and Motoko attack the Mine, meanwhile Agus discovers his wife has 
awoken and disappeared and he follows them to the mine and demands Blade does 
not harm her but when he finds her she has become another of Frosts strange 
vampire creatures and bites him. While Blade fights off more of the strange 
vampires Motoko helps Agus and the human survivors to reach the nearby 
spring where the surviving creatures follow, He blesses the water while 
standing in it and the creatures are all slain.
Meanwhile Blade confronts the Mine foreman, one of Frosts Vampire lieutenants
