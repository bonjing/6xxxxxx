Also, about Mount&Blade - With Fire and Sword... Haven't tried yet, but just might eventually. If so, I'll start a new torrent. If you want to try it with the same instructions, go for it, and let me know!"
,BirM0n,2011-08-08T17:49Z,"Update - Mount and Blade - With Fire and Sword

Tried the same method:
1 - Installed the game, updated it, and cracked it (to version 1.143, using Skidrow)
2 - Solved the mouse problem with MouseWarpOverride
3 - Game appears to be functioning very well, graphically. But it plays windowed, which means two things - The bottom shows the dock and hides the commands, and the mouse sensitivity has to be adjusted.
4 - Seems as the only thing you have to do is, in the initial menu, configure the game for the correct resolution, instead of using the option ""Use Desktop resolution"".

Still, I haven't played it enough to tell you if everything is working fine, but so far, seems as so... :-)"
,destiny36f,2011-08-09T00:01Z,i downloaded it n installed the crossover games but i cant open it
,BirM0n,2011-08-09T01:07Z,"@ destiny36f, does the app logo appears on the dock? It doesn't show anything apart from the top bar at start...

If it doesn't start, send to trash and download this one instead...

I'm pretty sure this one will work... Let me know!"
,destiny36f,2011-08-09T02:18Z,"this one is working, thanks very much, n the game works perfect on my macbook air i5 1.7"
,BirM0n,2011-08-12T01:14Z,"To update to version 1.143, use this torrent.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6598409

Just follow the instructions, running the updater through Crossover games as you would to install the game.

Have fun!"
,Pureox,2011-08-17T14:20Z,"Ummm i have a problem i cant do a complete 360 turn, really annoying be helpful if u can advise away to fix it"
,Pureox,2011-08-17T14:42Z,The screen wont rotate with the mouse help !
,BirM0n,2011-08-17T16:20Z,"@ Pureox:
That is the mouse problem you need to fix. That's why you have to follow the instructions, and place a MouseWarpOverride. Read the part about the mouse issue. You should be able to follow the guide and fix the game.

If you have followed the instructions and still aren't able to make the 360 turn, repeat the process, you might have done it wrong..."
,Pureox,2011-08-18T14:45Z,"ok thanks and sorry bout that double post thing, and shld i just like re download it or sumthing"

,BirM0n,2011-08-20T13:17Z,"@ jez123456789

About the wrapper.. I should try that wrapper. If it works it's awsome!! I read somewhere about how to make it, but I couldn't find proper instructions and I didn't have time, so I ended up using Crossover Games... That wrapper prevents from using it...

About the 360ยบ, just one thing. With the wrapper, in Campaign Map, when you go with the pointer to the edge of the screen, does it return to the center? If not, that's even more awsome!"
,spelertje7,2011-08-24T11:53Z,"he guys I cant find the appdefault thing
and the link to the wrapper doesn't exist anymore some help please??"
,TehHawg,2011-08-29T18:50Z,"I followed the instructions PDF to the letter, even doing the mouse scroll fix before trying to launch. But now when I launch, after I pass the launcher and the intro-movie, I get a white screen. A white screen with the M&B cursor, but nothing happens. I end up having to force quit the application due to inactivity. Any troubleshooting?"
,TehHawg,2011-08-29T19:02Z,I tried changing the resolution and setting it to default to windowed mode; no difference. White screen.
,charles_the_wolf,2011-09-14T07:31Z,Anyone know where I could find horse_meshes.brf anywhere My mount and Blade doesn't have that file.

,Diplex,2011-10-14T16:31Z,what do i do to play online
,Aypolo,2011-10-24T06:00Z,"Hey, I'm not a total noob, so please don't be condescending in any response...
I'm getting an error after starting up the wrapper: ""unable to compile the effect file"", then a black screen.

Any fixes?
Thanks,

,CKaT,2012-03-18T17:05Z,"Hey, does anyone know how where the config file is to change key bindings? It doesn't let you change the zoom keys for map mode, and they don't work."
,Saxred,2012-04-02T21:38Z,"Everything works perfect!!! BUT when I start playing  the cloth/armor or any kind of cloth disappear. The only thing is left is air....
Does anybody have the same problem?"
