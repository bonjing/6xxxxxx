So, first thing, this is not an app, or dmg, which you can just move to your applications folder and play... There\'s a lot to be done before, and it\'s the ONLY way I have found to properly play this game on my mac!

It\'s an awsome game and that\'s why I bothered to search everywhere how to install it without resorting to a virtual machine (makes the game so damm slow it\'s unplayable)... And it\'s the reason why I made my first torrent and decided to share the solution with you guys!
None of this is my doing, everything except for the final instructions were downloaded from somewhere else, and the tricks to make it work are around in forums... So, thank them, not me!


I have a MacBook Pro 13\", Spring 2010 model:
2.4 PCU
4 GB Ram
GeForce 320M

and so far, even in huge battles, it plays superbly, with good graphic settings! No lags, no long waits, no bugs (except one small - related to a MouseWrapOverride), but trust me, it\'s no big thing...

Follow the instructions with caution and time, and you\'ll be fine!!

Any questions, I\'ll make sure to answer as best and as soon as I can!


Have fun!
