Description: Crysis 2 - Advanced Graphics Options Utility
This fan-made tweak utility for Crysis 2 will create an autoexe.cfg to adjust settings for the detail steps of shader effects, objects, particles, physics, shadows, textures, water, and much more. Also anti-aliasing in two different versions, Anisotropic filtering, field of view can be customized.


Just a note if you're using an autoexe.cfg already, you should probably delete it, it could cause a crash.

Anyways requirements:
Crysis 2
.Net 2.0 or higher
Windows XP, Vista, or 7

Basic instructions:

1. Once you have unziped place anywhere you want.
2. Delete any autoexec.cfg files found in the Crysis 2 root folder. (if you're asking what that is, don't worry about it)
3. Delete any target commands you may have put on the shortcut as they will override the autoexec.cfg that is created
4. Run the Crysis2AdvancedGraphicsOptions.exe
5. Hit apply once all settings are set
6. If no settings are applied, try running the program in administrator mode.

*note* You do not have to start this program every time you want to play Crysis 2.
