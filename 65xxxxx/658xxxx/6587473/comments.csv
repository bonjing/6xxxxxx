,Basnagus,2011-08-08T02:14Z,"@ neil22768 . thnx man took your advice your right best cam I've ever watched (only recently started watching cams 5x)

A-10
V-10

** I watched it with PS3 on a 27inch SD TV so might not be a 10 to those watching on comp or HD tvs..

Massive thnx to .BONE. and IMAGINE

also thnx to all who have commented so far .. no bitching or complaining about seeds or speeds. Just some good feedback.  And if anyone cares I thought it was a great movie!"
