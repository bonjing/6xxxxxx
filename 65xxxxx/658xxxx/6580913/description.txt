How KeyScrambler works
Using advanced encryption algorithms, KeyScrambler encrypts your keystrokes deep in the kernel, as soon as they enter the computer. 

When the encrypted keystrokes finally arrive at the intended application, the decryption component of KeyScrambler goes to work, and you see exactly the keys you've typed.

This way, as your keystrokes go through the different layers of the operating system, it doesn't matter if they get logged, or whether the keyloggers are known or brand new, because your keystrokes are completely indecipherable the whole time.
