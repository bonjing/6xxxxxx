,pekerhed,2011-08-08T18:39Z,"Thanks for the uploads.  BUT, this file glitches several times in both VLC and QuicktimeX.  Picture pixelates, and audio drops out.  It only happens for several seconds at a time.
I'm not bitching, but just informing everyone else before they download it.
EZTV ups are usually flawless.
I still enjoyed the episode, outside of the glitches. 
Keep up the good work.  Your commitment to the community is always recognized, so we can sweep this under the rug."

,mu911,2011-08-11T14:13Z,This is password protected. Do you mind telling me the password? I honestly do not know how everyone managed to successfully open the file without the password. This has never happened to me (at least not with an eztv-uploaded torrent).
