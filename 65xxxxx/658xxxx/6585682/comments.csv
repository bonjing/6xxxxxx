thanks for ur support my friend"

,matthew_rs7,2011-08-08T19:59Z,"I have been looking for an office 2010 activator but none have worked for me as they all got black listed by the time I got to them.

This one works perfectly for me. Just launch it and click the 'ez activator' button.

I did get an error when trying to launch the program in regards to .NET framework but all I had to do was download it from the Microsoft site.

We shall see how long this version will be good for.

Thanks for the torrent!"
,al_gor,2011-08-09T08:56Z,Safe and very usful torrent. Works perfectly for my windows 7 (64 bit). Thank you!
,thisisarandomname,2011-08-09T17:15Z,If anybody is having trouble running the program you need .NET Framework 4 here: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17851
,Hiiumaa,2011-08-13T00:31Z,"Works like a sharm, thanks a mill, will seed that one for sure,"
,tktorrents,2011-08-17T23:54Z,"I've been ""activated"" since I installed Office 2010 on release day (x64 Office on X64 Win7) without any need to do anything... recent update finally ""fixed"" that error and so now my copy is no longer activated.

This little toolkit got my office up and running again!  Great app, will seed until I need a new version!  A+++"

,vinny567,2011-08-21T09:41Z,Worked great for me. Thanks for providing this. I was really getting frustrated trying to get Office 2010 registered until I came across this.
,Angie3333,2011-08-23T20:39Z,I checked the license. Does this work only for 180 days?

Do you have to run the program again at the end of the 180 days?

Cheers Mates"

,telllab,2011-09-03T18:06Z,"Getting the .Net download was the key for me.  Before that the EZ activator gave me an error message ""Failed to inject memory"".  Now I have a successful activation.  Thank you, greatly appreciated!"

,sleddog218,2011-09-10T20:17Z,"Both the Office 2010 torrent and this crack popped up as having a trojan labeled TR.Dropper.Gen. Can anyone confirm that this is okay, and that I should just let it ignore it? 
TIA! I used this on my other computer, and it didn't detect it, I just want to make sure this torrent didn't get corrupted somehow."

,puff13,2011-11-17T01:52Z,Thanks man..my trial version of office 2010..is fully activated...
,Belgian-Ginger,2011-11-20T19:40Z,"Thank you so much! I tried many things and only this one worked for me. It's my first message on TPB, I create this account only for you! (I also changed my isp DNS to google DNS, because you know, Belgium...).

I see there is no really need to seed, can I do something else?"
,cedders,2011-11-28T01:45Z,"@frankvallecillo
Not quite right. The activator runs automatically each time the machine boots and every 24 hours thereafter while the machine is up. Each time it runs, it resets the activation grace time to 180 days. Providing the app and scheduled task remain unharmed, you only ever need to run the activator once."
,tehnores,2011-12-26T17:58Z,"Thanks so much! I actually had a copy of 2010 Pro Plus from a university, but it was always loudly complaining because it couldn't connect to the university's license server. This solved all my problems, and is definitely easier to use than TheThingy's activators."
,zaidi86,2012-02-14T18:36Z,"I have done all the steps.On Office 2010 Activator Toolkit, i even see the Product activated successfully, But when I open the Microsoft Office word, or power point, then word page opens and at once it asks me to enter a key. i closed the key windows because i have no key than the office 2010 shutdown. I have tried a trial key from microsoft, but after entering a trial key, office 2010 shows me trial license,then using ez-activator i gain stuck up on the activating my product.Pleaze guide  "
,airone77,2012-02-17T07:31Z,"Anacondaz 

You really rule  i found yours so much eaz, it took me 5 minutes and voila it works perfectly ...
Many thanks to make our lives so simple.
:)"
,technothriller2992,2012-02-24T02:06Z,"worked perfectly. 
1. download
2. run the only exe file in the folder
3. click ""EZ-Activator""
4. (make sure your firewall and antivirus software dont block the activator.)
5. DONE!"

Thanks, Anacondaz, you're a star!"
,stonesour025,2012-03-29T19:13Z,"Worked perfectly. I used to use [thethingy] for the activation, but it didn't seem to work this time. Thanks!"
,lucasbda1,2012-04-05T00:38Z,"Please, i tried to use the IOORT, but it didn't work, so i downloaded this toolkit and when i try to use it, it says to uninstall the IOORT, but it already is. i've already rebooted my pc, please help."

,glh1309,2012-04-11T20:39Z,"Works well on Win 7, but it took some fiddling to succeed. Had to first choose the License Files button to create license files. First few activation attempts failed with message that the product id was already taken."

,hitex13,2012-04-16T14:32Z,Thank you so much !
,rfport,2012-04-19T23:12Z,The only activator that worked properly. Many thanx!!!
,Ecno,2012-04-22T19:19Z,"Confirmed working without threats detected by AVG Free edition.

But the Windows Firewall asked me to configure the network acces for ""Visual Basic Command Line Compiler"" ?
I told myself ""It's trying to compile a Virus over the net ?? O_O"" and I blocked it... 
If anyone knows something about it."
,Ackyroth,2012-04-25T05:45Z,"Worked perfect, to check if the activator worked or not, open a Microsoft office app, and then click on the top left Microsoft button, then click help. It should display on the right side if you're copy of ms office is key active or not key activated.

Thanks very much Anacondaz."
,Ackyroth,2012-04-25T05:47Z,"@ Ecno

Windows will try to firewall the activator from configuring your computer to activate msoffice. Allow it access, this program isn't malevolent in any way."

,lif3isfr33,2012-05-06T17:30Z,"I got a problem, this thing installed great. I had history with this neat toolkit. I really like it. However, couple months back my antivirus detected ""autokms.exe"" as a virus and either removed it or quarantined it. So, being a noob I removed it thinking office would still be activated. Well shortly after, office said I had a fake key and was not able to use it. So after some time I uninstalled it, reinstalled it and now doing it again.. any way I can keep this toolkit to do its job whilst having my antivirus active? there's no way I can keep my virus scanner inactive for life... help appreciated."
