As long as you have a network connection between your iPad and your computer, you can send your Adobe Eazel artwork directly to Photoshop CS5 from anywhere.

â€¢Mix â€œwetâ€ and â€œdryâ€ paint to create rich, realistic color blends. Breakthrough technology allows digital paint to â€œdryâ€ over time.
