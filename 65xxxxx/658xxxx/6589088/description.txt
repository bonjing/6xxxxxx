Genre: Thriller 

Movie Nfo - A man awakens in a mangled car-wreck at the bottom of a steep cliff. Injured and trapped inside, with no memory of how he got there or who he is, he must rely on his most primal instincts to survive. But as he attempts to free himself from the carnage and escape an impossible situation, a darker side is revealed. Even if he manages to survive, the man may have to face the horrible consequences of an earlier, forgotten life. 


Revieiw - It\\\'s not for everyone, no matter how banal this phrase is, but seeing user rating it\\\'s a fact. But then again, I had low expectations myself.

The performance of Brody is good, if not excellent. Well, he has a talent. The story is not very original or twisted, but it has some interesting and quite scary moments. Speaking about soundtrack, it\\\'s very very good. Slow guitar ambiances creating a deep feeling of isolation.

If you like movies with almost no talk, just nice scenery and such, then grab it (buy a DVD or through torrents).

TL;DR version: Underrated film with great atmospheric soundtrack and simple story.

I am also downloading and encoding stuff for you guys like crazy. I am constantly filling up my hard drives, and I am about have to get another 500 GBs. I am doing my best to fill everyones requests, and in the meantime, I am trying expose everyone to my personal taste in tv-shows, movies, and porn. lol.  I am also trying to widen everyones horizons / preferences and help you consider watching things that you might not have watched without someone insisting. (^_^)
