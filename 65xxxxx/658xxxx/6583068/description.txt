Reservoir is the debut album of the London-based band Fanfarlo. Their debut album was recorded in October/November 2008 at Tarquin Studios, Connecticut, USA and was produced by Peter Katis (The National, Interpol). It includes the bands featured singles "Fire Escape" and "Harold T. Wilkins, or How to Wait for a Very Long Time," which were released on preceding EPs. Sigur RÃ³s's singer JÃ³n ÃžÃ³r Birgisson suggested the sister of Czech photographer Jan Saudek when they were looking for art for the album cover. Fanfarlo chose a photograph which contained SigurrÃ³s , the little sister of JÃ³n ÃžÃ³r Birgisson[1], and the namesake of the band Sigur RÃ³s.
In the UK a strictly limited edition red box set version of the album was released to a selection of independent record stores, containing numerous art cards and the album tied with red and white string.
