Description: Sweet Sinner pulls out all the stops in this incredible tale of intense older/younger passion that evokes the classic film â€œThe Graduate.â€ Joey Brass comes home from the army at loose ends, until he meets jaded older woman Mrs. St. Michaels. As the young stud and older woman embark on a complex love affair, Joey meets Magdaleneâ€™s daughter Zoe and falls madly in love with her. But an angry, bitter Magdalene has no intention of letting the young stud go. With first-rate performances and the hottest older/younger sex ever captured on video, My Girlfriendâ€™s Mother is a must have for any erotic film collector. Starring Magdalene St. Michaels, Joey Brass, Zoe Voss, Michael Vegas, Angelina Armani, Johnny Castle and the legendary Veronica Hart (as Joeyâ€™s mother). Written and directed by Nica Noelle.
