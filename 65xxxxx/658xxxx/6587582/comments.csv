,Dektep,2012-04-24T13:17Z,"I always people uploading stuff of this kind of subject matter.  And I'm sorry but I just have to vent about this.  It was such a pile of shit.  The guy loves himself so much that it reminds me of the books that Kenny Powers writes in East Bound and Down.  Part 5, the interview, is an interview with the guy (Taylor) who designed this 'course' and they just basically talk about how awesome he is.  It's blatantly obvious that the 'invite only' monthly stuff is played up as been so exclusive because anyone who knows anything about slaes and/or persuasion knows that something which is apparently rare is desirable.  It's human nature.
The Advanced techniques section is just the guy and his buddy talking absolute drivel.  Or ""conversating"" should I say?  Seeing as it's one of the many words the guy seems to have gotten wrong.  For someone who is a 'master' of NLP you'd think he'd be able to speak properly.
""when you are conversating"" with someone""...
what a dick."
