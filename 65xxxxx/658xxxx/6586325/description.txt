                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Jonathan Maitland talks to families struggling to meet their mortgage payments
 and hold on to their homes, and examines the role the banks have played in this
 latest housing crisis. More than 100 people a day are having their properties
 repossessed and one leading banker is warning of a further increase if interest
 rates start to rise.
                                        
                                 Enjoy!
