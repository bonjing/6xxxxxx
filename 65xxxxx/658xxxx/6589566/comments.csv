That said, this is the only copy I've been able to find, so thanks to uploader."

[T],ajaxen94,2011-08-31T10:32Z,@Scinik as i said it is a tvrip the aspect ratio is as near as i could get from a tv recording they very rarely show it as it's supposed to be
,Scinik,2011-09-01T22:08Z,"Quality is very good, considering it's a TVrip of an older film, and aspect ratio issue is easily dealt with through in-player controls.

This movie is FUNNY, in a post-modern hipster cynic kind of way. For even more fun, every time someone says the word ""communist"", imagine they said ""atheist"". :D

And Nancy Olson was hawt in the day (see her in Sunset Boulevard http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043014/ , as well).

I'm revising my above comment to BIG THANKS to uploader. :)"
