Source: HD-Stream with 5.1 track

Encode:

well tagging this movie is kinda difficult. have seen it tagged from dvdrip,ppv,hdtv etc.
from sharpness and motion its not a retail file thats for sure, best guess is a web-download 
from itunes or similar ppv site in the end it doesnt matter, i am just happy to get you some quality stuff.
Since this is a hdstream prolly the best tag is hdrip.
Besides sharpness video was really nice,came along with 5.1 audio so did my usual with sharpness,brightness,rgb 
and denoise, got very nice in the end
just check pics and sample
enjoy

Video: 720x400 @bitrate 1800 2pass
