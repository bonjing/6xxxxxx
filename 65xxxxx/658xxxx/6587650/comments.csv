The source in the notes said that this copy was a HD-Stream but it plays like it's a 480p BRRip with full 5:1 audio out put, in a word ""perfect"". You want get much better than this for 1.4gb...
Many Thanx to froggie100 and CM8 for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:)"
