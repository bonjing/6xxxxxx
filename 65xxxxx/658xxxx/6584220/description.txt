Western Civilization: Beyond Boundaries (6th Edition)
Wadsworth Publishing, January 1, 2010
ISBN : 1424067820, 945 pages

Western Civilization: Beyond Boundaries (6th Edition) is distinguished for its wider definition of Europe that includes Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, and European frontiers. Recognizing that factors outside the continent affected European history, the authors highlight Europe's place in the world throughout the narrative and in the primary source feature, "The Global Record." Carefully revised and edited for greater accessibility, the Sixth Edition is briefer and incorporates pedagogical features such as focus questions, key terms, and section summaries to better support students of western civilization.
