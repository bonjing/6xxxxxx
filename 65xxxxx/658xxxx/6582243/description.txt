To make up for this lack of guidance, 
Part 1 acts as your personal driving instructor, 
leading you step by step through the process of buying, setting up, starting, and shutting down your PC and using the controls (the keyboard and mouse) to navigate Windows 7, 
run programs, and enter commands. You also discover where to look for
help when you run into trouble or just donâ€™t know what to do.
