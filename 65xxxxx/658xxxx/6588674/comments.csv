,PsychoLogic,2011-08-23T15:24Z,"Ummm, thanks for linking to a seedless torrent which doesn't contain what was asked for."
,dustyshot,2012-03-27T23:23Z,"I think this is the one I downloaded in the past and got rid of because there is a spot in the movie where there is a high pitch audio noise that will hurt your ears if your wearing headphones on a laptop like I do. There is no good quality bdrips of this movie or the second one around with good seeds.

People are uploading worse than dvd rips of this movie on this site that have more seeds than this torrent. What gives. Do people know the difference of a regular tv and HDTV that bluray is way the hell better than dvd, and by ripping a bluray to smaller than a dvdrip makes it even worse than a dvdrip? This one has good quality video, but the audio is not good."
