,robidew,2011-10-04T17:26Z,The movie is trying to copy aspects of There Will Be Blood. That's fine it was a good movie and so is this.  But the ending is so fucking frustrating and dumb!
,Marv70,2011-10-22T21:53Z,"Great work as always. Excellent movie. It is as if you were traveling with a covered wagons back in the early days. Congratulations to everyone concerned!  A=10, V=10, M=10. Thank you Mr. Extremezone. The best English subtitles for Meeks Cutoff is âMeeks.Cutoff.LIMITED.DVDRip.XviD-DoNE._www.ENGSUB.NETâ. The words are correct and the sync is right on. Marv."
