C4E's iXtreme LT+ 1.91 FULL Firmware Pack + JungleFlasher v0.1.86 (267)


C4E released the iXtreme LT+ v1.91 CFW in association with Team Jungle & Team Xecuter:

Official release of the iXtreme LT+ v1.91

* New random AP26 challenges defeated. Due to the new AP26 random challenges the safety freeze for unknown or bad AP25 data is no longer supported.
Please ensure your AP25 data is correct for the dashboard version you are using.
* No need to reburn current AP25 backups from dashboard 13146

I would like to dedicate this fw to all the dead DG-16D4S drives from the kamikazi hack

Thanks go to Team Jungle for their hard work and efforts in the development process.
Thanks also go to Team Xecuter for their support to this project.



As always with a new C4E iXtreme release, Team Jungle also comes with a new version of JungleFlasher to add full support for the new firmwares.
