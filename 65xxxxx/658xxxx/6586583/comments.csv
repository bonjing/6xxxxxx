,Strikefear13,2011-09-07T15:51Z,"Hate to ask but I can't seem to find a guide for this anywhere. I had my 360's firmware drive flashed for me by someone I'm no longer in contact with. It's one of the Arcades with the Lite-On drive from 2009, and I didn't have the hardware required that earlier drives didn't need. Anyway, I still have the drive key he extracted. I just need help with upgrading to the current firmware. I can find first install guides, but I have NO idea how to update. Pretty sure I don't need the hardware he used since I have the key, but I have no idea what I'm doing. Can anyone help or link me to a guide please?"
,jwil00,2011-09-07T20:15Z,"Thanks for the upload!  I have a Hitachi 59, and I'm going to flash it with a USB to SATA connection in JungleFlasher.  I know that I don't have to worry about AP25 with this drive, and I don't play online, so what firmware version should I use?  Thanks again!"
,mrnexus,2011-09-14T19:11Z,"I cant install this as it says my computer is missing libusb0.dll,does anyone know what it is,BTW my laptop is a HP G62 x64 bit windows 7,6 months old,it also says ""Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem""I have Dloaded the same or simalar jungleflasher apps and am always getting this message,PLEASE REPLY IF YOU CAN HELP ME OUT THKS."
,TatShi,2011-09-24T05:46Z,"@mrnexus: copy the libusb0.dll from the folder labeled libusb, and paste it where the program is located. PortIO is not a signed driver, so 64 bit windows will not load that driver without ""disable driver signing"". To disable press f8 on windows boot. Good Luck."

,rmorsy,2011-10-30T03:18Z,"I am a complete noob and had a cpl questions.  I have a benq drive and it was modded a few years ago.  My xbox isn't even connected to live, so I don't think I can get banned.  I have purchased the DVD +R DL's, have image burn 2.5.6 and have agbx, and power iso.  Am I missing something in order to play this game?  I don't know what version it is flashed to.   PLZ!!!  Any info would help.  I watched videos on how to burn the games, I just don't know if I can play them.  THX"
