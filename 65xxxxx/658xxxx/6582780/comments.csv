,richardpa,2011-08-05T01:42Z,"Good WEBRip and a steady download...
A/8
V/9
Great picture but the audio goes fractionally out of sync in the last third of the film (about 0.300ms) easily adjusted with the VLC Player so it didn't really spoil the movie...
Many Thanx  to .BONE. and MC8 for the decent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:)"
,CocoaJackson,2011-08-05T06:41Z,Can anyone define WEBRip and update wikipedia please? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirated_movie_release_types
,Farzin67,2011-08-06T09:52Z,"thanks for the upload.
A: 8

As ""richardpa"" mentioned audio goes out of sync a little bit nearing the end but doesn't cause any problem.
It was a good surprise to see a nice movie after a long time, I enjoyed watching it."
