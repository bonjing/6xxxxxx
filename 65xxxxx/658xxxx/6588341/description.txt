Here are best book about Lua (Programming in Lua, 2nd edition) and fastest Lua jit-compiler (LuaJIT 2 beta 8, downloaded from www.luajit.com and compiled for Windows).

Now you are ready to go with Lua:
1) Prepare source file (e.g., MyFirstProgram.lua) in your favorite text editor.
2) Enter command prompt window (cmd.exe) and type this command to run your program:
luajit.exe MyFirstProgram.lua

Or you can use Lua in interactive mode:
1) Run luajit.exe
2) Enter lua statements one at a time, they will be executed immediately as distinct code chunks, so you must define all your variables and functions as global.  By the way, you can use short syntax \'=var\' instead of \'print(var)\' to display variable\'s value.
3) Type os.exit() to close LuaJIT

I believe this is good starter kit for beginners - minimal and essential simultaneously.  You should not read tons of literature - it is sufficient to learn only \'Programming in Lua\' (written by Lua\'s author) and sometimes look into Lua manual www.lua.org/manual/5.1/ to get help on standard Lua functions.
