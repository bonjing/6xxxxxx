,riplikethat,2011-08-08T01:20Z,Wow I actually forgot I had this game installed. At least now I can go back and finish it.
,TheBigHase,2011-08-11T20:44Z,Thanks a lot!
,TheBigHase,2011-08-11T21:00Z,"Oh my, I think  I withdraw my thanks! Antivir found a Trojan ! What do you say about that? Another ""false alarm""? :-/"
,Marvalitch,2011-08-15T22:42Z,"I teste it, and it work fine for me. Nod 32 didn't find anything."
,newmouse,2011-08-18T23:08Z,"WARNING This update means you have to start a new game.
Any older gamesaves are ignored @@@"
,TyMod,2011-08-23T22:32Z,"Thanks a ton,  They still didn't let you turn the Depth of Field off!!! IT SUCKS. But the lagging issue and FOV can be changed and plus the decals look better so whatever.  If htis is how they would had sold the game, it problebly would had gotten better reviews.  I feel bad for Gearbox, they got left with the mess of ALL the other game companies."
,TyMod,2011-08-27T21:57Z,"Thanks, worked great.  I can play the game without it lagging every freaking second.  I wish they would let you turn depth of field off by itself."
,EndFED,2011-09-23T02:47Z,"Yeah, still can't trun off the depth of field. It's unplayable on my commodore 64."
