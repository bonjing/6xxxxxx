Hardly matters, granted. Most of the information from it is somewhere in here, including the older book it takes the place of, and any one of the adventure paths alone is probably enough to keep you going for a year.  But still, I was specifically hoping to find that book..."

Cities of Golarion corrected, thanks :)"
