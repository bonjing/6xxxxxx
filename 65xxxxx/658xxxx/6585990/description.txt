Paper Aeroplanes is a girl and a boy from
the westest extremes of Wales, who spend a
lot of time on the M4 in pursuit of pop
perfection. For such an amicable duo they
have gone through a considerable number
of band members and have recently resorted
to a squad rotation scheme, periodically
affected by injuries, international duty,
soaring wage bills and a lack of space in
the boot. They are not afraid of a good 
tune and Sarah Howells gorgeous voice will
melt even the most hardened 

cd ripped by EAC

pleae seed
