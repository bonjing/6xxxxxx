,ranres,2011-08-13T09:29Z,"The silence on track 13 is intentional. 

Saw this on Amazon:

Product Alert: Intentional Silence on Track 13
Please be aware, track 13 of this album, ""Illest M----------r Alive,"" intentionally features a three minute silence at the onset of the track. This is not a defect, it is intended by the artist to separate the 12 tracks found on the standard version from the 4 bonus tracks only found on the deluxe."

,gshuck420,2011-08-20T07:55Z,"This is sad that this is album is the #1 seeded and leeched file. come on america wake the f*@k up and learn that this is not even worth getting paid to buy, or getting paid to steal it off the net. if anything it just shows how shallow and lame humanity has become. "
,TheMovieDon,2011-08-22T04:22Z,This I have to admit is the most disappointing dl of my pirate career (only just started lol) but compared to frying pans banging against the walls. I'll rather the pan. No offense i expected something exceptional but it just sucked ...my two cents
,gaysianlover,2011-08-23T04:29Z,Music sucks quite a load of donkey balls.
,SleepingThunder,2011-08-24T00:59Z,"I was expecting more from this album.
All hype no content with you all the way gshuck420.If i had payed my hard earned on this i would be pissed & they are rip off merchants 4 releaseing this shit.But the record company will give music press & radio station's a kick back inturn 4 rave reviews & airplay.Track1 is only good track & on lift off beyonce is sreaming all over it were as the soul gone? "
,oikjgbvguiugfc,2011-08-24T03:56Z,"I agree with the other comments above, this album is pretty horrid.

,southsidesiren72,2011-08-31T22:54Z,"I have to agree about the music these days, but must we be racist about it. Jayz and kanye are doing whatever to make money please dont look to them to throw a whole race into one category it's sad and ignorant. Moreover, I happen to love Otis its a banger!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Smoochies"

,HiroPro2,2011-10-10T06:58Z,"Please stop ripping in CBR!

I don't understand why people have the idea that CBR would be better than VBR!!!

The LAME encoder was DESIGNED TO DO VBR!!! And a lot of the work the devs did was in that regard. All you idiots are doing is making INFERIOR and LARGER files than if you just used -altpreset -v2

use VBR and JOINT STEREO!!!

Not CBR320 Stereo YOU RETARDS!

and use dBpoweramp to rip!"
