Review: This volume improves on its two forebears in a number of ways. 
The cryptically jolly "Inspector Morse Theme" is shunted last for once, 
to make way for the adagio "Eirl Theme"--a sombre opening that reflects 
the album being dedicated to producer Kenny McBain who died during the 
third series upon which this collection is based. Again, Barrington 
Pheloung's arrangements of classical source material is meticulously 
impeccable. The list includes selections from Mozart (The Magic Flute 
and the Piano Concerto, K488), Wagner (Wesendonk-Lieder and 
GÃ¶tterdÃ¤mmerung) and Brahms (String Sextet No 1). As always they 
represent a fine insight into Morse's struggling thoughts at the 
relevant time. The composer's own material is atypically restrained. 
Although he can bang out the action when called for, these three volumes 
have all sustained a respectable quietude-- symbolising, perhaps, 
Morse's preferred state of living a quiet life. --Paul Tonks
