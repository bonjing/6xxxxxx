Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is probably the most extraordinary genius in the history of music. When he died, age 36, in 1791 he had created a body of work unrivalled before or since. The autographs of many of his greatest compositions have survived and show page after page of perfect manuscript with no corrections and no additions. Mozart didn't write sketches or short scores. He committed the completed work to paper and that was it. Job done.

Aldous Huxley in his famous essay on creativity â€˜The Doors of Perceptionâ€™ written under the influence of mescaline, suggests that the greatest creative talents are not really creative at all but the result of a direct conduit to the â€˜Etherâ€™, a filter for the collective creative conscience.

The Requiem was Mozartâ€™s last composition. He did not live to complete it and the enduring question is how much of it is by Mozart and how much by his pupil SÃ¼ssmayr who completed the work after Mozartâ€™s death.

The central enigma lies in the fact that on the one hand SÃ¼ssmayr was a very ordinary talent as a composer and on the other hand the pupilâ€™s music â€“ if indeed it is his - matches that of the master. Perhaps, in the emotional turmoil surrounding Mozartâ€™s death, SÃ¼ssmayr made his own brief but extraordinary connection with the â€˜Etherâ€™? Much scholarly verbiage has been expended on this enigma and there have been several unsuccessful attempts to improve on SÃ¼ssmayr.

Sir Colin Davis has spent a lifetime with the works of Mozart and believes that, whatever the arguments of scholars, there is no point in messing with a masterpiece. This performance with a fine group of young soloists and the LSO and LSO chorus on top form provides the perfect justification for his view.
