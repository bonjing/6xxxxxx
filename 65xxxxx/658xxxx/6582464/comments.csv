SkunkWeed is a moron whose mother was raped by the FLT members in a gangrape while Batman wasn't available to save her at all. Probably joined in the rape later on."
,swaty007,2011-08-05T10:13Z,"Skunk does have a point though, original files are meant to be bin and cue (info says that). 

This torrent is an iso, so its not in its original format, so its likely to have been tampered with?

so i wouldnt bet anything on it. :("
,riplikethat,2011-08-05T17:38Z,"IC.exe isn't a trojan. It doesn't even launch after first try (during which u enter serial no.).

The only trojan here is SkunkWeed  who was luckily shat out by his mom after she god pregnant cause of the gang-rape."
,caki.deki,2011-08-06T12:25Z,"ic.exe chocked my CPU, constantly hitting 50% of usage, with one core completely taken. Then my bitDefender reported its some generic crap. In my book its pure CRAP! Deleted game but ic.exe stays on system so stay the f* out of this torrent.

you have been WARNED!!"

,mamailo,2012-04-10T08:32Z,Search the web for a torrent that only includes the cue and bin files. This one DOES have the ic.exe
