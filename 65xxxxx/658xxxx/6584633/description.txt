Mr. Anthony Hopkins gives a brilliant performance as Adolph Hitler in 
what were his final days alive - from the "Bunker".

This is a great movie to show the lack of care for Germany's own
displayed by this psychopathic personality type - given the scorched
earth policies and the like. No man of conscience could stand his tirades
in this respect, and we see that Albert Speer (in this made for TV movie) 
for one seems to not want to give in any more to this madness of self inflicted
cruelty against the German peoples.


What terrible tragedy for the women and children shown - it is a sad
piece of history that is captured in this piece of movie making history.
