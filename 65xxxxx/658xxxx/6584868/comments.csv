michaelrwatson was right, it IS better to find out for yourself and googleing it is a VERY useful skill. By the way asswipe, he wasn't rude.. I am :)"

A= 6
V= 6

I'd wait a bit tbh"
[T],artpepper,2011-08-06T22:33Z,"Thanks for the upload, but as others have remarked, it looks like a VHS...then again, all the PPVs (Pay-Per-View, i.e. recorded from a TV broadcast) I've seen look like VHS to me...and the audio is pretty harsh. Perfectly watchable though, so thanks.

Video = 7

Audio = 7"
,Play4263,2011-08-07T03:14Z,Decent quality A7 V7 Thanks been waiting for this!
,dougbug,2011-08-07T11:48Z,"IwannaFan2 -- what a lame piece of shit you  are to include a ""sample"" clip...of the intro titles and actor credits.  Not one fucking second of actual video of the movie -- just a bunch of rolling fucking credits.  You fuck your mother's dirty cunt...and smell it while you spew your sperm in her twat."

,mocean,2011-08-07T17:27Z,"Thanks so much for the upload, been looking for this movie for ages! Decent quality, but it's such a great movie so it's definitely worth it. Many thanks."
,faldoroc,2011-08-07T21:07Z,"A: 7
V: 6
This is a PPVRIP, even though ""IwannaFan2"" removed that part of the PB-title just to get more popularity. 4:3 aspect ratio doen't really suit modern movies tbh.
@mark1990: Don't report A/V=10 without watching the movie first."
,SuperWurm,2011-08-08T00:01Z,"thanks for uploading the movie.

about the quality. It's watchable, but it's not realy sharp. It's like watching an movie from the seventies. You know, where everything is a littlebit blurred because it's not digital but from VHS cassettes or whatever they use."
,y3n007,2011-08-08T00:30Z,I really hate Owen Wilson he is annoying as  heck.....so just want to know if this movie is even worth watching no the because of quality but the movie itself......
,lozory,2011-08-08T02:36Z,wow thats the most USELESS sample EVER!!?!
,FBeckaered,2011-08-08T11:27Z,Quality is terrible.
,kenagunner,2011-08-08T23:49Z,"thanks Iwannafan2 
good watchable PPV thanks again ;)"
,scottsasse,2011-08-09T02:28Z,"@ dougbug, You dumb inbred fuckhead, the sample is primarily intended to give people a taste of the A/V quality and to show that the upload is real!! What your toothless ass is bitching about not getting is called a trailer!! You can find these simply by searching Google for movie name, trailers. Now go munch an your anus like an apple unless your dog is already doing it for you! P.S, you should change your username to ""douchebag"".   "
,bcoug,2011-08-09T15:40Z,"@scottsasse
on the contrary, a sample is supposed to be a sample of the a/v quality. how can you determine a/v quality from scrolling credits across a screen? it's best to include a section that has several different sound volumes and lighting levels."
,ashen77,2011-08-11T00:44Z,woody allen.... BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
,Daker9,2011-08-11T15:20Z,"I'm sorry I don't like to complain too much but this is terrible quality.
I'm not sure what the folks who give it a high quality rating are watching it on maybe a 2"" cellphone?
Please do not waste peoples time giving hit A/V quality ratings."
,spankbot,2011-08-13T13:05Z,"A: 5
V: 5

Bad copy in my opinion.  Over compressed, cropped video and horrible sound.  For a movie about sights and sounds, this is the worst torrent you could download.  Wait for a poper DVD of Bluray rip."
,highlander777,2011-08-18T09:42Z,"Thanks for the upload but the video quality is just fair. Movie was surprisingly good although it starts slowly.

,XxXanarchy86XxX,2011-08-22T11:41Z,decent quality... alright movie... great upload!
,olivehere,2011-08-29T08:20Z,"Wow, some people are so fucking rude. They feel like they can just say anything they want (and they do), just because it's over the net. @ dougbug I cannot believe that you would go on a tirade like that, over not liking the sample. Sheesh man, you've gotta learn to chill out a bit. "
,ghostriderRO,2011-09-05T11:49Z,nice movie...
,soundthealarm,2011-09-08T07:23Z,"You guys can complain about the quality making it look like a vhs, it just makes me nostalgic. "
,XxCautionNJ84xX,2011-10-05T08:26Z,"Gj on the upload Iwannafan2. And for all of you dipshits giving some type of negative feedback, If you don't have nothing nice to say don't say nothing at all. Its very simple. The movie is free, your aren't being charged. This guy takes his time of day to do this upload for all of you and the least you can do is not talk crap. I don't understand how hard that is to understand."
,bil_gr7,2011-10-07T14:26Z,@scottsasse what kind of moron are you? Who told anything about a trailer faggot? The sample is useless because it doesn't show SHIT and noone can determine the A/V quality of the file. Which by the way sucks. So take your delusional insults and fuck off!
,imprecation,2011-10-11T03:22Z,"@XxCautionNJ84xX 
Dude you're not a dickhead for saying that the quality is shit.  If you are polite and are just giving an honest opinion there is nothing wrong with that you are passing on an opinion.  This saves others time and bandwith and helps the community as a whole.  I don't give a fuck if the movie is free or not.  It's great that IwannaFan2 uploaded the movie and I appreciate that but if the quality is shit the quality is shit and people need to know that."
