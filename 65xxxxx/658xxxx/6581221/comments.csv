Thanks a lot for all your uploads.

Would you be able to upload BR RIPs 4GB or bigger of Derailed (2002), In Hell (2003), Nowhere to Run (1993) ?

Thanks"

Let's make this clear again: we DON'T have any rules against dupes. If you, or any of your ""Trusted Mafia"" friends have a problem with that, I'm taking away your skulls.
Why? Because I don't want to see trusted people trolling other members.
Chill out man."

Don't blame the file if you aren't smart enough to figure out how to switch between audio streams."
