Review: Barrington Pheloung's stroke of brilliance in embedding the name 
of each episode's killer into Morse Code at the start never distracts 
from his wonderful "Main Theme". Of course the guitar leads, because 
that is the composer's instrument of choice. On this first volume it 
should be noted that there is only the original short version of said 
theme. The original pieces include an ambiguity for harp and strings 
("Oxfordshire Country Home"), a contemplative piano's plodding ("Morse 
On The Case"), eerie wind effects backed by doom-laden strings ("Macabre 
Pursuit") and a piano and woodwind duet for the ever put-upon "Lewis". 
Suiting and soothing the detective's turbulent thoughts are the 
following classics: Mozart's Laudate Dominum and the "Overture" from The 
Magic Flute, Puccini's "Senza Mamma" and Mendelssohn's Lieder Ohne 
Worte, Op. 67. If you have the means to play it in a red jaguar, this 
album is a must.
