Back in 2007, I started putting together these mixes of songs from rather obscure 80s bands that I believed deserved far more recognition. Anyhow I am re-posting this series for those who are new to TPB or missed them when they were first posted. If the mainstream music is all you know about the 80s, then get ready for a bit of revelation. This comp. includes one of the best new wave songs ever made by a Canadian band, "Lust For Love by Images in Vogue". Catchy, infectious and superb!
