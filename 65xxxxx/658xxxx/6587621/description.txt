Warning: The puzzles in this book will not torment,
tease, or frustrate you!

In fact, these guided mental exercises have been created to
enlighten rather than exasperate you. Brain Building will arm you with the
practical thinking tactics that give you a sense of mastery over confusing
situations. How? By teaching you the seven critical mental processes that spell
the difference between "scatterbrained" and clear thinking.
First, you're provided with a simple problem. Then you'll get to
see these mental techniques in action as you "listen in" on the thought
processes of a logical thinker. You'll learn how to organize information
into a manageable structure and zero in on key facts that enable you to
find an answer-without hours of fretting. Finally, you'll get a chance to
practice these logical principles by solving similar problems yourself
You don't have to be a genius to tackle problems effectively. If
you've ever felt overwhelmed by complex problems and wish you could
think more logically at these times, then this unique series of puzzles is fyou!
