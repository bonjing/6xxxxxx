,MyFootHurts,2011-08-12T18:56Z,It boggles my mind that we're in 2011 and people are still encoding things in xvid.
,spicyworm,2011-08-13T06:35Z,"Boggles MY mind that you - MyFootHurts - would actually have the audacity to COMPLAIN about someone's choice of format - someone who gave their time and energy so that an ungrateful ass like yourself can have a FREE download.  Also, some of us don't waste time and/or money on the ""latest greatest"" format because it's RIDICULOUS to try to keep up - next month it's another new format....sheepople - that's you."
