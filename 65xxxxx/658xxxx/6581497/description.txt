Senior Constable Rose is called to an accident where a motorcycle rider has tried to split the traffic and go between two trucks. The rider has been run over by one of the trucks but the drivers did not stop. The police are on the hunt to find the truck drivers to determine whether it was a hit-and-run, or whether the drivers are unaware of the hit. Meanwhile, the rider is in a serious condition fighting for his life. Then, Senior Constable Byrnes pulls over an unregistered car, but the driver attempts to do a runner.
