,john8611,2011-08-09T23:15Z,"Rip-off of Ground Hog day..?..

  OH MY GOD....ground hog was a fair movie but geeze how can you compaire the two, this is thriller not a sappy romance with a slight dollop of comedy squeezed in somewhere, there are so many other movies with a repeat the same day or time over again most recently ""source code"", 50 first dates come to mind, with the mind numbing adam sandler(almost cried typing his name).run lola run,retroactive, tru calling.....you guys may as well compare steamboat willy to saw3.. im sure a mouse or 2 got squished in that... sure comment on a movie but give it a chance,, ground hog day? really... V9:A9 great up thanks."

,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2011-08-11T06:49Z,lol @Pakastani.. lol.. Yeah it's in English. Some people obviously can't read English so they ask if it's in Hindi.
,cephalocaudal,2011-08-11T11:22Z,they can't read english? but they can write english? LOL
,Pito232,2011-08-11T12:21Z,"""A gritty mind-bending thriller about three twenty-somethings""....cmon is this the real description?first time i ever seen a description that never gave a exact age on characters"

A.9

M.4

A miserable, bleak, depressing outlook on the lives of 20 something trash drug addicts and  sexual abuse. A sad commentary on the spoiled youth of America.

,AidyD,2011-08-17T02:01Z,"I only downloaded this because of the comments saying it was gritty and dark...

Fuck you guys need to watch some real movies.. This thing plays out as a highschool teen angsty melo-drama with laughably ironic dialogue with cheese on top.

Was expecting requiem for a dream with seven cinematography... 

Anyway
