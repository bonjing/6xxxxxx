,wtfbollos,2011-08-12T02:57Z,"On tonightâ€™s edition of â€œThe Daily Show,â€ Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said that his Republican colleagues â€œlike war.â€

In a discussion about the debt ceiling, Durbin said he was â€œgoing to point the finger at my Republican colleagues for a moment.â€ He went on to say â€œMany of them have said they like war. They like waging war. They like the notion of staying in war. They think we should spend a lot of money in war.â€

Durbin said that when President Obama needed to borrow money to support wartime expenditures, Republicans then said â€œNo way. Iâ€™m just for war when I donâ€™t have to vote for the debt ceiling.â€

Host Jon Stewart responded â€œTo be fair, though, I donâ€™t think anyone would say, â€˜I like war.â€™ Do you mean that metaphorically?â€

â€œMetaphorically,â€ Durbin answered. â€œThey like the notion that we would engage our troops in combat to assert Americaâ€™s position in the world.â€ He then began to talk about voting against the war in Iraq.

â€œDidnâ€™t see that coming,â€ Stewart said, and promised to put the whole interview on the web."
