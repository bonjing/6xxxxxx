,DarthPS3,2011-08-13T05:41Z,You are very welcome.
,scum666,2011-08-14T15:49Z,This is great quality and the show is pretty good. Eps 9 has no sound for most of it. I had to watch that on youtube. Cheers.
[T],trialNerror,2011-08-15T04:08Z,"Is this a re-re-encoded version of the WEBrip torrent that's out there?

Did you use Handbrake?  
Ever tried YAMB?  
That can most often make a MKV into a PS3 compatible MP4 without any conversion by simply changing the container while leaving the audio and video exactly as is.

I'm looking for a REAL 1080p version of this, no WEBrips... anybody have any leads to those files?"
,DarthPS3,2011-08-26T18:05Z,"O.K., yes, re-encode of the Webrip.
No idea why there's no sound on Episode 9, all I know is that that sucks ass. 
No, I did not use either of the two programs you mentioned. Be assured that I will do so."
