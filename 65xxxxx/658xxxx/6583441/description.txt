In the second episode of this fascinating series, Professor Marcus du Sautoy uncovers the hidden patterns that explain the shape of the world around us.

Starting at the hexagonal columns of Northern Irelandâ€™s Giantâ€™s Causeway, he discovers the code underpinning the extraordinary order found in nature â€“ from rock formations to honeycomb and from salt crystals to soap bubbles.

Marcus reveals the mysterious code that governs the apparent randomness of mountains, clouds and trees and explores how this not only could be the key to Jackson Pollockâ€™s success, but has also helped breathe life into hugely successful movie animations.
