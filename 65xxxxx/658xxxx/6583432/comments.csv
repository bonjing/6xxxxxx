Wrong, it is the 21st episode (S06BE08) in the AIRED order.

The actual number of the episode is 15."
,drcat123,2011-08-05T06:41Z, He didn't do last week at all and Wikipedia has there crap all out of whack for it . So it's not my fault

""He didn't do last week at all""
What does that have to do with anything? Just because eztv didn't post S06E20 doesn't mean it never existed... And even if it did, wouldn't that make this episode 21 and not 22? How are you GAINING an episode if you claimed to have lost one?
That makes it your fault.

""Wikipedia has there crap all out of whack for it""
I'm not sure which ""wikipedia"" you're using, but if it is this one: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Futurama_episodes#Season_6_.282010.E2.80.932011.29
then it is not ""out of whack""...
It is set up correctly, and couldn't be any clearer. It has the Title and even the Air Date...
If you can't read that correctly, then that is your fault."
,NxFals,2011-08-05T07:38Z,"""wouldn't that make this episode 21 and not 22""

I meant to say:
""wouldn't that make this episode 20 and not 22"""

,drcat123,2011-08-05T09:06Z,"first of all ep 21 was last week 

this is ep 15 . 

wiki is out of whack because of this is ep 15 "
,spifkitten99,2011-08-05T09:23Z,"It all doesn't matter. Stay away from ASAP rips.

ASAP has not yet produced any videos in anything even close to decent quality.

Just get another one. ASAP ALWAYS has horrible encoding."
,spifkitten99,2011-08-05T09:25Z,"Why the fuck do you fools use wiki as an episode guide anyway?

Use epguides for episode guide.

http://epguides.com/Futurama/

Here you can see both the official episode number, and the production number."
,spifkitten99,2011-08-05T09:26Z,"But seriously, just don't get ASAP releases."
,ZephirDX,2011-08-05T10:07Z,"Who the fuck cares what number it is. Also, ASAP is fine enough quality for me. I want it fast and I ain't watchin' it on no HDTV. You get what you aim for here."
,NxFals,2011-08-05T10:48Z,"@drcat123
This being episode 15 has absolutely nothing to do with wikipedia... That is what episode this is... EVERYWHERE. 6ACV15 is the official production code; it is officially episode 15. They just chose to broadcast it in a different order.

Also, you're still wrong, can you not read or something? If you use Wikipedia or the episode gudie spifkitten99 posted, you can see that Episode 23 was last week (all the presidents' heads) yet it was aired as episode 20 (S06BE07). Episode 21 was July 21st (yo leela leela) and was aired as episode 19 (S06BE06).

@spifkitten99
The Wikipedia has all the info on that guide, and more, and is more organized, and more accurate. By accurate I mean it lists the episodes by their official tv name, such as this episode being S06BE08 (Season 6B Episode 8). Either way, both guides are pretty much the same.

As for opposing ASAP release so strongly, even going as far as saying ""ASAP has not yet produced any videos in anything even close to decent quality."" is clearly just your opinion. Which is wrong, because clearly this is pretty decent quality. Sure it isn't MAXIMUM SUPER BEST ULTRA CRYSTAL CLEAR quality... but that would make it High quality, not ""decent""."
,NxFals,2011-08-05T10:59Z,"@ZephirDX
I don't think anyone here really cares about what number the actual episode is, but more of correcting drcat123 who was basically saying ""this is wrong"" when in fact, it isn't. Also that he is trying to blame Wikipedia somehow which still hasn't fit into a single thing he has said. He simply just doesn't know how to read propperly is all. One of those people that just can't be bothered to spend a few seconds actually READING rather than skimming. Also, for some reason, he seems to think that Wikipedia just numbered it episode 15 for no reason at all, when in fact that is the official episode number given by the writter(s) and/or producer(s), or whoever's job it is to label it that, but you get the point."

No... that is the very same link I linked, and you can't seem to read it correctly either.

This is episode 21 in the aired order, it is episode 15 in the production order.

Next episode is obviously episode 22 in the aired order, but it is also episode 22 in the production order, not 20. Episode 20 has already aired... both the production and the aired order. If you can't count, 22 comes after 21, 21 comes after 20...

The next episode is 22 - Fry Am the Egg Man (S06BE09) it will August 11, 2011."

""WHo gives a shit? its a fucking EPISODE NUMBER, GET OVER IT!""

You don't seem to get it either. All of you that keep saying ""who cares, no one cares, it doesn't matter what episode it is"" are just as retarded, because you keep missing the point. I even pointed out in one of my comments that it isn't the episode number that is the issue.

It is people like you, and people like them that get the episode number wrong, because you all can't read (propperly anyways).

What's wrong with you people? How can you not read a simple guide. How can you have three guides linked on the same page and still get the episode number wrong? I tell you why. Because they're too stupid or too lazy to even bother trying to read ANYTHING."
