Saxophone heavyweight Scott Hamilton wanted to make an album that would stand up to the best of them and he wanted to do it the right way. To do this he choose some of his favorite ballads and played the songs live in studio with a large string section, with no overdubs or laid-in tracks. The album was arranged and conducted by Alan Broadbent. The record was recorded in Hollywood on October 5 & 6, 1992.
