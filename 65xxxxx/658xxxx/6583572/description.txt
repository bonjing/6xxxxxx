Herois da decadensia (1987)

------------------------------

There was an intense feeling that something vital was lacking. A direction. Answers. And, above all, questions. Right there, in the post-dictatorship, in the middle of the silence, of the â€˜lost decadeâ€™. Without pose. Without compass. Believing. Gleaning the shards. From the hands of Waly, Leminski. Glauber, Chacrinha. Wesley, ZÃ© Celso. Oswald, Oiticica. Piva, Augusto. Glued shards. Assembled fragments. Pound, Vertov. Edited scenes. Poetry phrases. Music making tracks. Gil, Caetano. Doors, Beatles. Ultraje, Satie. Looking at life as a film. Without heroes. (...) I stumbled. And it ended up in the video â€˜HerÃ³is da Decadensiaâ€™ (sic).
