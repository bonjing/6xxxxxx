Movie is a bit weird though... With only 30 minutes left in it, they where still doing the buildup. Then they kindof skip the usual middle (and longest) part, and go straight towards the end of the movie, where you learn what you are watching, and that it is now finished."

Bad news for us pirates in the future regarding screener copies. Any chance this watermark was edited to look like stern's copy?

Great Torrent!
Thanks!

PS: I know what SCR is.
But after seeing EZ's uploads, I DON'T WANT TO KNOW nor UNDERSTAND what SCR is.

All I need to know is: eventhough EZ says it's SCR, don't trust him :P
The Video and Audio quality of his uploads speaks a different kind of level.

Thanks will never be enough for all you've done EZ :D"

And the end was even worse. There was no big battle or nothing. The alien just put together a bunch of cars, tv's, microwaves and a bunch of other dumb crap, made the spaceship out of that and just took off. This movie Sucks!!! Really boring. The movie playing during the credits was way better than Super 8. Spielberg and abrahms shouldve put a bigger budget in the movie playing during the credits. Would've been a better movie!! Super 8 was shot well and looked good, but it sucks!! 2.5/10"
,train_wreq,2011-11-04T08:38Z,"this movie is crap. it had potential but i felt like the acting sucked, the story was original yet WAY too comfortably predictable. its E.T. for the new era but without even a loveable alien or decent child actors. the creature they present in this is a total faggot. and the end of the film sums up the laziness as the little boy has a crying E.T. style epiphany. nice try Spielfuck, not fallin for it.
