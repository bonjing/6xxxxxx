,The__dude21,2011-08-04T22:00Z,@x_Darkstorm_x  lol ! maby he's been growing weed since 6th grade :)
,kr3z,2011-09-11T20:41Z,"@x_Darkstorm_x, I'm afraid it's you who must have flunked 6th grade science. While plants do absorb carbon dioxide and give off oxygen in a process known as photosynthesis, this is not what the author is referring to. Plants, like animals, respire. They take in oxygen and give off carbon dioxide. This is a requirement of the cells of all living organisms. If you deprive a plant of oxygen, it will die within a couple hours."
,IronPlane,2011-09-13T15:28Z,Has anyone used this guide to actually succeed in growing their own weed?

,MrPirate8,2011-10-10T18:44Z,"@x_Darkstorm_x - It also states in the beginning of the book ""Positive Effects is reduced nausea and the Negative Effects is nausea"" This makes no sense. I will continue reading this book and hope it gets better :)

Thanks to The__dude21 for this upload. I will seed for a few days if this book is good.
