From Wiki:


William Michael Griffin Jr. (born January 28, 1968), known by his stage names Rakim (or simply Ra), Rakim Allah, R.A.K.I.M., and The Master, is an American rapper. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential and most skilled emcees of all time.[1][2][3][4] Eric B. & Rakim's classic album Paid in Full was named the greatest hip hop album of all time by MTV,[5] while Rakim himself was ranked #4 on MTV's list of the Greatest MCs of All Time.[6] Steve Huey of Allmusic stated that "Rakim is near-universally acknowledged as one of the greatest MCs -- perhaps the greatest -- of all time within the hip-hop community."[7] The editors of About.com ranked him #1 on their list of the Top 50 MCs of Our Time (1987â€“2007).[8]

In addition to his career as a rap artist, he is an author and a poet. Rakim's rapping, which pioneered the use of internal rhymes in hip hop, set a higher standard of lyricism in the genre and served as a template for future rappers. Rakim began his career as a emcee for part of one of the most important rap duos of the golden age hip hop era: Eric B. & Rakim.

The 18th Letter is the debut solo album of American rapper Rakim, released November 4, 1997 on Universal Records in the United States.

The album debuted at number 4 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and sold 500,000 copies in the United States.[15][16] A deluxe version of The 18th Letter was sold with the compilation disc The Book of Life (UD2-53111),[17] an Eric B. & Rakim greatest hits collection.[18] The Book of Life was also issued separately as a double vinyl LP in 1997
