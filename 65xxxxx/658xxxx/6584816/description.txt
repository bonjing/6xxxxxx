IMDB REVIEW:

I went to see this movie with my almost ten year old daughter. She LOVED it! I thought it was fun and clean...perfect for young girls. I am unhappy with the low IMDb score. (3.5 out of 10) Clearly, the people who are rating this film are not it's target audience. Our theater was full of tweens...even boys. I heard many of the boys talking to one another (we are so much like those two guys, etc.) The girls in the audience could relate to the girls in the movie. (My daughter would look at me at some parts with such a sweet smile on her face...part swoon, part thrilled by the romance. It was too cute!) This is NOT High School Musical...more mature, yet age appropriate. Like I said before, perfect for tweens! There were also many fathers taking their daughters...very sweet! Parents...(or Grandparents)...take your daughter...she will love it! It is the perfect "date" movie with your little girl! Have fun!
