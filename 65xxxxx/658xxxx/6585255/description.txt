Storyline: While closing his Jujutsu training academy studio one evening, Mike Terry (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is approached by attorney Laura Black (Emily Mortimer), who is seeking the owner of the parked vehicle she accidentally sideswiped outside the studio because of the heavy rain. Off duty police officer Joe Collins (Max Martini), who was receiving a private lesson by Mike after a class, sees that Laura is distressed and chivalrously tries to take her coat. Startled, Laura grabs Joe's gun, which he set down only briefly, and fires it; shattering the studio's front window. To avoid having Laura charged with attempted murder, Mike and Joe agree to conceal the event.
