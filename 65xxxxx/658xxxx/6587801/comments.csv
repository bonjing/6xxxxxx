,dreadzzz,2011-08-07T03:44Z,Mafurios you came here and you also download stuff so what ? Are you a dick too ?
,Insomneac,2011-08-07T03:47Z,"Why does a Humble Bundle upload always bring out the do-gooders?

It's a pirate site, it's not up to you to dictate what can and can't be downloaded."
,rhinowar,2011-08-07T03:49Z,"wasn't gonna,  but I will now.  And mass mail the file.
Thamks"
,Netarangi,2011-08-07T04:19Z,"Because it's ""for charity"". Wah wah"
,riplikethat,2011-08-08T10:57Z,"Nice.

I love how retards crawl out of woods to bitch about people downloading these stupid games. When we can pirate million dollar productions, nothing is stopping us from not paying for shitty games with shit graphics."
,riplikethat,2011-08-08T10:57Z,"Also, sending this torrent link to over 50 people on my mail list who I know pirate games.

Good times."
,ArtieT,2011-08-30T13:22Z,"Well, this certainly brings out the provocative, argumentative types, doesn't it?! If that's your idea of a good time, I feel sorry for you. Maybe one day all the contrarians will realize that having to do the opposite all the time is actually boring and slavish!

""nothing is stopping us from not paying for shitty games with shit graphics"" 
- All this plus ingratitude and arrogance - and you have 50 friends - amazing?! 

Actually there are some great games there, and unlike the creatively bankrupt Hollywood, I think people ARE buying games and will continue to, because they need/use them more than films, and they usually know they're going to be good, unlike films! 

Without the needless provocation, I like to think/hope this acts as an advert for the humble bundles, and people will support them, but I would ask the uploader if he could type the address next time, maybe?

Thanks for the upload! "
,MagicMercury,2011-09-19T08:29Z,"Hey, I would more than happily pay the above average cost of $6.00 for these games, but they closed down Humble Bundle 3, and I'm not gonna pay $10.00 for just Braid or any other one of game out of here. If they would let me download it from them, I would give $10.00 for all of the games, which is the point of HumbleBundle, so don't blame us, blame them for shutting down the download."
,iycgtptyarvg,2011-10-04T00:27Z,"I don't understand why these bundles are time-restricted. By the time I hear about them they are long over.

Thanks Netherian for uploading this."
,bungiefan,2011-11-02T06:49Z,"Well, if you don't hear about them right away, subscribe to their emailer and they'll tell you as soon as they open a new bundle. They run for 14 days every time they run a bundle.

Gaming news sites also go nuts promoting them."
,GenKaan,2012-01-07T03:46Z,"Got bundle 2 and 4 :) Just here to seed!

Love what your doing!"
