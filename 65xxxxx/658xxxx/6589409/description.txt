John Frankenheimer was the original director, but he was replaced by Buzz Kulik before shooting began. Well into shooting Kulik was replaced by Roger Spottiswoode.

The film was based on American poet J.D. Reed's novel Free Fall. The musical score included the song "Shine," written and sung by Waylon Jennings.

In an attempt to drum up publicity for the movie, Universal Pictures offered a million dollar reward for any information that would lead to the capture and arrest of the real Cooper. No one ever got the money.

The movie includes a lot of inaccuracies. For instance, in the movie it shows D. B. Cooper jumping during daylight with clear weather. However, in the actual event, Cooper jumped during the night and it was raining heavily. The movie shows Cooper with 200 dollar bills, instead of the actual 20 dollar bills in which he was paid.

The film was not a success in theatres and is now difficult to find on video UNTIL NOW!
