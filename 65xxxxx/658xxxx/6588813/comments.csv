,irishboyblue,2011-08-08T10:33Z,nice m8 ty 4 the up be seeding dis quality is fine ! 
,scottsasse,2011-08-13T23:33Z,"Thanks for your effort and for sharing. However I cringed when I saw this was an flv file. Flv is a thing of the past due to it's poor picture quality. I would suggest MP4 or MKV which will give you 480p x264 and you would still end up with a small file size around 300MB to 400MB!! Love, DrScott "
,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-09-02T09:28Z,DrScott makes a lot of sense. flv is ancient.
