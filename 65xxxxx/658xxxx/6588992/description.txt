Tony Stark is accused by Defense Minister Kuroda of trying to avoid controversy by sneaking plutonium into Japan aboard an undefended cargo ship. This ship has been attacked and the plutonium stolen, posing a grave threat. Suspecting that heâ€™s been set up, Tony dons the Iron Man armor and vows to retrieve the plutonium and clear his name. He tracks down the stolen nuclear material and discovers that Zodiac, a terrorist group associated with Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.), is behind the theft. Reporter Nanami Ota gets caught up in the chase and nearly killed, attempting to get Tonyâ€™s attention. Iron Man ultimately defeats the Zodiac warrior, Cancer, and retrieves the plutonium while Nanami finally gets to write her first story on Tony Stark..
