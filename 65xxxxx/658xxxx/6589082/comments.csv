[T],insinuendo,2011-08-09T20:57Z,"For many reasons.

1) The bit rate, both audio and video

2) Highres audio DTSMA

3) fZ is the best encoder and does not sacrifice quality for size

It is a transparent replica of the blu-ray video.

I promise you won't be disappointed !!"

The audio quality is superb! Just like the video quality.

The movie was ok, but those kind of movies don't need such quality to my opinion.

Besides that, it's a great upload!"
