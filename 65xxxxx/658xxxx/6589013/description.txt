Live at Radio City is a miracle of concert cinematography, filmed from all angles by nine HD cameras.  Images of the stage mingle with soft-focused closeups of the artists' hands and faces, silhouetted by prismatic spot lights. The shadowy backdrop is textured with a fine, digital grain.

This isn't the sort of film that screams for a 1080p rip; the shots aren't super sharp, and there aren't any pyrotechnics.

But after extensive testing, I've settled on this high bitrate. It preserves shadow details, color gradients, and camera noise -- nuances that would be lost by smaller encodes. I've seen the 720p rip going around, 3.6GB, replete with blocking artifacts.

If appreciate such fine points, know that 3.6GB doesn't do justice to Dave and Tim's epic, 160-minute show.

P.S. The 5.1 audio track is totally superfluous. This concert was mixed for CD in stunning stereo.
