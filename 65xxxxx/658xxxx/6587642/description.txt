Engineers looking for an accessible approach to calculus will appreciate Youngâ€™s introduction. The book offers a clear writing style that helps reduce any math anxiety they may have while developing their problem-solving skills. It incorporates Parallel Words and Math boxes that provide detailed annotations which follow a multi-modal approach. Your Turn exercises reinforce concepts by allowing them to see the connection between the exercises and examples. A five-step problem solving method is also used to help engineers gain a stronger understanding of word problems.
