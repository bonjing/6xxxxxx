None of the files I will be uploading are mine, the credits go to others. 
All the files can be found on bittorrent sites. 
All have been re-encoded and cleaned up.

All have custom menus using part of the original menus where possible.

This was found by accident, even though I had been looking for nearly 18 months.
If you have already downloaded the previous versions before, it's still worth downloading a second time as the quality is great.

All other versions of this file will not be surported from here and have been deleted.

I will seed until there are enough seeders and then will upload more.

To everyone who don't hit and run but keep on seeding - THANKS.


Enjoy 

All 30 episodes on 2 dvd9s

Removed commentary, interviews and FBI warnings.

Cd cover has been redone. Fancy Fancy has had major cosmetic surgery and has had his ear rebuilt.

Files basically untouched (some minor compression) as the quality was fine, just joined to make this dvd9
