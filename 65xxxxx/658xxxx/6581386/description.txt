A lot can happen in the middle of nowhere. The tiny mountain town of South Park, Colorado has proven that beyond a doubt for the last eight seasons. Fortunately for fans of this Comedy Central pillar, series creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker obviously had no lack of ideas for their ninth season. Over the course of fourteen episodes, Mr. Garrison gets a sex change, Cartman thwarts a hippie music festival that threatens to destroy the town, the boys (Cartman, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny) start a talent agency, Kenny leads angelic forces in an epic battle against Satanâ€™s minions at the gates of heaven, and the boys become really bad at losing at baseball. And thatâ€™s just the first half of the season. The most notable episode from this season is definitely the controversial "Trapped in the Closet," where Stan is "recognized" as the reincarnation of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, and a dejected Tom Cruise locks himself in Stanâ€™s closet. Naturally, over the course of the episode, TV reporters get to decry that "Tom Cruise still wonâ€™t come out of the closet." It's funny enough on its own, but when John Travolta and R. Kelly end up in the closet as well (all singing together "Now Iâ€™m trapped in the closet. Iâ€™m trapped in the closet too"), thatâ€™s worth the price of the set on its own.

After nine seasons itâ€™s also nice to see that one of the series key running gags, the perpetual cluelessness of the adults, still isnâ€™t getting old. It's as if the adult townspeople only know how to behave based on movies theyâ€™ve seen (this seasonâ€™s cinematic targets include Rocky (in "The Losing Edge"), The Day After Tomorrow ("Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow"), and Pet Cemetery ("Marjorine"), and their inevitably clichÃ©d over-reactions still provide many of the showâ€™s best moments. The commentaries from Parker and Stone are once again typically short; they usually last only a few minutes into each show before they end it with "Ok, onto the next show now" not even trying to conceal that they really want to get through the recording session as quickly as possible. That might seem lame on other shows, but on South Park--a show where 8-year-olds send a talking killer whale to the moon through the Mexican Space Agency for $200,--somehow itâ€™s totally fitting. --Daniel Vancini
