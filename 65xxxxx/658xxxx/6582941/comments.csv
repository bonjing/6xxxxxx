,tjej3n,2011-08-27T00:26Z,I just updated that you told me to do. but The sims update remanes the same it wont update

,vagranttrees,2011-08-28T01:20Z,sorry for the repeat posts. my comments weren't showing up for me at first.
,Acopyforall,2011-08-28T01:27Z,"tjej3n,  yes it will say that since it has a cracked exe  but it works fine.  ive played for hours at a time and it played flawless!"
,Acopyforall,2011-08-28T01:33Z,"suzhesin, i had similar issue at one point and found for some reason i had to copy the games over to my ""c"" drive as i had all of  them in my ""D"" drive which for some reason it was giving me that error when installing them from that drive sometimes,  also it did it to me when i was seeding a torrent that i was trying to istall at same time so i had to pause it til i was done. so make sure ur not seeding it while trying to install and install the programs ""from"" your main HD let me know thanks "
,Acopyforall,2011-08-28T02:02Z,"vagranttrees,  np on the posts i had same issue a while back lol,  umm newer updates come out and usually patch files and make cracked exe/s and other files to no longer work,  i would say check games4theworld.org for updated material.  let me know how u make out."
,Acopyforall,2011-08-28T02:09Z,"vagranttrees,  please note these cracks were for if installing all,  im not sure if they work otherwise, they might work and updates just messed it up.  if u gonna play just the base game try and not update it by turning off ur internet and it should still install and crack should work fine"
,babya,2011-08-28T05:09Z,"acopyforall, I am having some issues with this game. I understand it has downloaded and been played flawlessly for you. But as for me, I cant get anything done right. At first, i install the base game which worked great until applied the crack to the file, and now it wont open. I also cant get the game to mount through powerISO? I think i just need someone to full explain the process of which i need to follow to play this game and the expansions i wish to install. I need some serious help. Any advice is much appreciated! I've been working on this for 4 days now.... :("
,babya,2011-08-28T05:19Z,"I can't get any of the expansions to download. I get a message that says something with the sims 3 is still running? Also, i dont know how to mount it. everytime i try, i cant explore the file and it says i need a disc to play :("
,babya,2011-08-28T05:22Z,"ahhh now it says: ""an error occurred while running the setup. make sure you have closed all other applications and finished any previous steps""
ughhh i just want to play. i cant download any expansions."
,vagranttrees,2011-08-28T05:50Z,i went on the games4theworld.org site and did some reading...apparently you have to install the base and town life stuff and/or generations expansions for the crack to work at all. this is just taking so long! been downloading for a week straight and only have the base file
,vagranttrees,2011-08-28T05:52Z,"babya-i had that problem w/poweriso too. for some reason you have to open poweriso, go to ""mount"" at the top right of the screen, click ""set number of drives"" to 2 drives, then mount on the second drive (g: for me, not sure if other computers might be different)"
,babya,2011-08-28T06:09Z,"i've tried that. when i go to my computer>drive that i mounted it on, i cant explore the file because it doesnt mount as a powerISO file."
,babya,2011-08-28T06:48Z,"OOPS, looks like all i needed to do was read all the instructions."
,babya,2011-08-28T07:19Z,"okay, ran into another problem.
i installed world adventures just fine, but now it says i have programs associated with the sims 3 currently running, so it wont let me install high end loft stuff.. :( what do i do?"
,yetisamas,2011-08-28T15:18Z,"dont say you put the ISO's in rar, when they are damm DAA files."
,babya,2011-08-28T16:55Z,I don't think so?
,suzhesin,2011-08-28T17:54Z,"still no dice, placed it all on the c drive still does the same"
,Acopyforall,2011-08-29T17:14Z,"babya,  i not sure what version of windows u are running but open task manager and check to see if sims 3 is running as that can cause u a problem applying cracks and so on but the instructions i supplied should be all that is needed.  power iso works great but again some machines are different."
,Acopyforall,2011-08-29T17:19Z,"vagranttrees,  im sorry to hear that its taking u so long to get where others are getting the whole thing within a few days,  have u the newest ver of utorrent 3.0 and if so have u cleared ur peer list and reset bans?  seems to work for me.  here is what i used to configure mine http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6576946/A_A_Torrent_Set_Up_Guide___uTorrent_Set_Up_Guide"

,Acopyforall,2011-08-31T08:15Z,"No not at all How i did it was i right click using winrar extract files.... and select c:/users/  /desktop where being my main drive put each one right on my desktop 1 at a time then right click on the power iso file ""mount"" then browse the cd image right click on the .exe the sims setup file run and install it once finished delete image off desktop to recycling bin and empty that too then proceed to repeat process until u are finished thus leaving the torrent intact and still seeding hope this helps."

,Acopyforall,2011-09-03T10:08Z,"goncalo16,  once all is installed basicly what happens is that the cracked exe/s supplied all route back to the main base game launcher wise so if u start game and it says Town life stuff then all is in,  remember these are all expansions/additions onto the base game.  that razor update u speak of i left in and it doesnt matter whether u install it or not as u will be getting updates anyway over writing it."

,Acopyforall,2011-09-12T13:10Z,"lmaharj,  it sounds like u didnt install the main game which should have the ending ext .daa,  and im not sure u can install any other part of the game unless u install base game so with that said i would think that if u look in your add and remove programs and its there then u have some other issue.  If not then u may want to try uninstalling all and reinstall."
,Acopyforall,2011-09-12T13:14Z,"ralphmaztah,  this torrent is working as said in previous statements and as far as speed some have had speed issues which may be confined to u or there is some other problem.  like with me i have found that dl with utorrent seemd great but uploading is better for me to use bittorrent."
,HolyWinter,2011-09-13T01:36Z,This is going to take an incredible amount of time fer meh. I would hope that anyone whom downloaded this would seed it to spare everyone else the long torture wait. I'm seriously only getting 0.2 kb's which earlier use to be 120 kb's at max. So SEED plz!

,Acopyforall,2011-09-15T04:44Z,"iamjempe,  this happens when your not blocking the program from accessing the internet.  if you have incurred this problem then i suggest going to daemontools.com and Downloading the most current ""free"" version install then attempt to mount the images of the game."
,jagpit,2011-09-15T10:07Z,"help? I downloaded your files, but could not find the base game. So I downloaded Razor1911's The Sims 3, and it works just fine. But when I tried to continue installation starting with World Adventures, it told me it The Sims 3 needed an update, yet it failed to do so. So I am now stuck and don't know what to do? I looked around and tried to understand what you've said to others who had this problem, but I can't really understand what to do still. I'm new at torrents, so this is a bit frustrating. :/ "
,iamjempe,2011-09-15T16:11Z,"#Acopyforall. FINALLY. i was able to manage to install the base game but i don't know how to crack it. where do i copy ""TS3.exe""? and what's this other file: ""TSLHost.dll""? please help."

I looked this up as well and people say to just reinsert the disc and play from TLS not base game. I obviously dont have the disc to reinsert, and when i open sims from TLS it says the same thing. It should be up to date, 9.0.  and the base game is 1.24. I've tried so many things, yet its not working? :("
,Acopyforall,2011-09-16T15:07Z,"jagpit,  if its asking for town life when trying to play then u must go into the task manager ""instructions i supplied"" and make sure EA and anything to do with the sims is closed then copy over the files in directory with the cracked files,  it should then work."

However, they are not downloaded from yours, and I am interested to have Town Life and the store updates to 3 July. Do you think I can just download and install your version of Town Life and the store updates and my game can still work?"
,deathblade93,2011-09-21T22:38Z,"Dunno about the rest of you, but apparently if your trying to download it now your late to the cake.

No one is seeding, on a 1.8mb/s connection I get 6.1kb/s

...

Basically, either hope that asshats who don't seed stop leeching, and the original seeders show up again... I'd recommend another torrent except I dunno any and then asshats would follow my link and shit all over that as well.

Basically, wait the 40weeks of download time, or pray and hope it changes."
,gibseuleuh,2011-09-23T15:45Z,"Hi ! 
I've downloaded only the ""the Sims 3"" folder. I extracted the .daa from the .rar, mounted the .daa on a disc with PowerISO (and with Daemon on a second attempt), installed the game, copied the crack folder onto ""The Sims 3"" folder created during the installation. The launcher appears correctly, but when I want de start the game, a window pops up saying that the game cannot find the cd, so the game won't start. I've tried to start the game with and without the updates (those proposed when you first launch the game). 
Does anybody have any idea why the game does not find the cd that is mounted (with PowerISO) ? 

PS : I've also tried to uninstall and re-install the game, as someone suggested before, but it didn't work ! "

,Dankness,2011-10-22T06:36Z,"For those of you getting errors. I found the issue. The crack is for game version 1.24 but the most recent one is 1.26. 1/26 was released on oct 17th. Go to this link, http://www.gamezone.com/downloads/the_sims_3_patch_1243

Download 1.24 and use the provided crack. Then make sure not to update the game until you can find a crack for 1.26. "
,slkching,2011-10-22T08:38Z,"There are 2 cracks for base game (one in 1 - the sim 3 folder, the other one in 10 - the sim 3 fix folder), so which one do i apply, i reinstalled 3 times already and i still getting that ""unable to start game service initialization failed 0x024e424f "" message. i tried uninstalled and installed n applied the 1.24 patch but it still doesnt work"
,slkching,2011-10-22T09:22Z,"so i kind of get the base game to work...so after i installed the base game, i moved the crack and run it..it worked..so then i applied the update 1.24 version. and then i run it...this time it said insert the cd...so what should i do?"
,Dankness,2011-10-22T21:07Z,"Go and download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6656158/the_sims_3_crack_v1.24.3

that crack. Install The sims 3 and then also download patch 1.24. If you do the automatic download it will go to 1.26 which is not cracked yet far as i know. So you have to download 1.24 separately from that website I previously mentioned or somewhere else. 

Now after you download the torrent and the 1.24 update, install the sims. (UNINSTALL the game if you already failed and reinstall).  Once the game is installed run the 1.24 update. Make sure to run the launcher and turn off auto update. Then use the crack from the link that I just posted to crack the sims 3. This trick worked perfectly for me. 

After you do that you can install each expansion just like it says to. I would suggest doing one at a time cracking them as you go, running the game to make sure it works after each one. Also make sure it works past the loading screen. Sometimes it will come up with a insert a CD. If it does, you did something wrong and need to reinstall the game like I said.

Far as I can tell as long as the base sims 3 game works then the expansions and their cracks in this package work fine. "
,Dankness,2011-10-22T21:25Z,"Basically just make sure the crack matches the update. I know that the expansions work with 1.24 in this way, so I assumed the crack that came with the torrent would work. I guess not. I used the crack that I linked and it has worked with ALL of the expansions perfectly fine. Enjoy your game!"
,slkching,2011-10-22T21:42Z,"what about the expansions, do i use the cracks that was provided in this torrent?? because like i said earlier, in this torrent. Base game has two cracks to it, one is from the 1- The Sim folder, the other is from 10-the sim FIX folder. So the one you provided for the base game, so the expansion set i still use the one provided in this torrent?"
,slkching,2011-10-22T21:59Z,"i tried the way you suggested, it doesnt work. This is the pop up i get: ""it looks like you have installed an unofficial game modification that does not match your current version of The Sims 3.

,kennedyn,2012-02-11T08:19Z,When I start the game after installing everything it loads to a black screen and my regular mouse shows up. The black screen occurs when the EA Games logo and stuff is supposed to pop up. Does anyone know what the problem is or how to fix it?

,boytert,2012-04-05T07:41Z,I have a Problem I Cant seem to overwrite and replace the base game crack is there a new game file because i cant seem to get it to work because of this reason.
,boytert,2012-04-05T08:06Z,i even tried the new fix off the site and read the comments and tried everything that sounded like my problem any help or advice would be nice
,Daisuke-kun,2012-04-20T17:55Z,"Great job.  Torrent works and the game works too.  Just to let you know, the replacement files for the last 2 expansion is named incorrectly.  You have to rename the files yourself.  Other than that, perfect.  :)"
,SlashBlack,2012-05-08T16:37Z,"@ilikechoco5  300$? lol, This shit is not worth that much money"
,Neuronyx,2012-05-14T12:01Z,"Do the math. It's about $300. 

Also holy shit the download is slow. "
,Neuronyx,2012-05-24T10:48Z,"Jesus christ, can someone please decipher the readme files? This was apparently typed by someone with downs. "
,Neuronyx,2012-05-24T23:12Z,"Of course, any attempts to install anything are worthless. I only get a 'Sims 3 launcher has stopped working' message every time I try to start the Sims. 

Before this i'd given up on installing any of the expansions since it inexplicably fails ( ""Setup has failed"" ). 

Maybe if the readme's weren't done by complete fucking morons this would be possible. As is this is a fucking crapshoot. "
,Neuronyx,2012-05-25T05:32Z,"Alright, I managed to get everything installed myself. But NOW when I try to start the game I get the message ""Unable to start game, Service initialization failed"". "

,Dixie51,2012-05-25T21:50Z,"OH MY GOD... Seriously? The people commenting need to take a sedative or something... Yes, it's slow. I agree that it's slow. I will seed until my eyes bleed once I get it downloaded. But really, do people have to get all butt-hurt because their free software isn't downloading fast enough? Is everything always so perfect in your world that something like this has to get you all upset? I'm like, ""Okay, big file, slow download, looks like I won't be playing this today. What else can I do to occupy my time?"" and I go find something else to do. Deal with it! Calm down and just find something else to do and be patient. It's free. The uploader did not have to supply this for all of us to use. Remember that. Suck it up, Buttercup."
,mad.man,2012-06-01T05:13Z,"Having an issue with sims3 world adventures.  For some reason as I'm playing every now and then the game kinda freezes for a few seconds.  It doesn't crash, it doesn't lock up and not work, it just pauses for a few seconds (The longest was about five seconds) and then continues.  When I had just the base game installed it worked perfectly, upgraded to ambitions and then master suite, still worked fine, but when I installed world adventures, that's when the problem started.  I meet the Recommended requirements, so I don't think that would be an issue.  help pl0x?"
