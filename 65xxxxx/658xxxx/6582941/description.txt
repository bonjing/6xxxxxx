2. The sims 3 july 2011 store updates

3. Folder 10-The sims 3 fix Are the finishing cr^cks for the games supplied from Games4theworld.org 

have revised and installed this exact pack and have been playing for a week now and it works wonderful and felt i need to share So Enjoy!  


optional folder containing extra programs  for people who may not have extracting utility for rar ext, so i included fyzip and winzip,  power iso and imgburn for mounting iso images and burning, Also damn nfo viewer,   which will be required for installation i did 2 of each because they are not big in file size and sometimes people have trouble running certain programs.

Here is everything that should be needed to view run install extract and mount these installations! i recommend img burn if power iso does not work for some machines,  i also recommend update your direct x and audio/video drivers prior to installation of game. All files have been checked by 2 different Antivirus programs Comodo and Avg and all is clean! 

The real work goes to games4theworld.org and razo1911 for there super hard work in making things sharable, Thanks. so please seed because sharing is caring and the slowest speed is better than none :) 

Any comments or questions are welcome but please keep them clean as it is all about sharing and nobody is perfect in what they do!
