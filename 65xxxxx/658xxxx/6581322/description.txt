                Flynn, A-Rab and Barry are three British chancers,
                fresh out of uni and determined to have one last
                summer of irresponsibility before they face the real
                world. For reasons best know to Flynn, they've
                blagged themselves jobs at Beaver Falls, an elite
                American summer camp for the ridiculously beautiful
                teenage offspring of California's rich and powerful.
                In episode two, it's July 4th, the day America
                celebrates ridding itself of the tyranny of British
                rule and the day Beaver Falls throws its annual
                Independence Day Pageant - only this year Flynn's in
                charge. Throw in the arrival of Beaver Falls' most
                glamorous and infamous camper, Lily Meadows, and it's
                got diplomatic incident written all over it.
                Meanwhile, A-Rab must pluck up the courage to ask
                Rachael to the dance, while Barry finds the most
                unlikely of drug dealers,as the boys embrace life,
                liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

                Encoded at crf 21 because this series is less
                compressible than most scripted series. It would go
                over 5000 kbit/s on crf 19.
