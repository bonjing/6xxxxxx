,pieterdegreef,2011-08-15T12:05Z,will you do the other seasons as well?
,kewrel,2011-08-15T16:37Z,"I doubt it. The main point of these uploads is they were originally released in .mkv format, which isn't supported by Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. Season 16 and 17 also had some audio issues when remuxed.

The previous seasons are just Xvid in .avi containers as I recall, so they are already PS3/360-compatible."
