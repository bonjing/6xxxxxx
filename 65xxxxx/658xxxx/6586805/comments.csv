,frosticle,2011-08-07T10:02Z,"Thank you so much for keeping up with this. After you posted the first one, I figured you were done. Years of waiting around for sports simulators to get cracked and not seeing most of them kind of made me pessimistic. I'm really glad that you have stuck around and continued to post the updates. Thank you again."
,AXXOFAN2008,2011-08-09T04:26Z,Can someone seed this for a while again please?
,GH0ST11,2011-08-09T22:25Z,"Excellent game, and I would like to again thank those responsible for the continuing updates!

However, been playing OOTP since v11, and I always seem to experience crashes with cracked versions. D/L'd this thinking I wouldn't have that problem anymore, but it happened to me with this version as well.

Just wondering if anyone in the same boat, still, I look forward to more updates. I understand the nature of cracked games but I will try the next one hoping that it is more stable for me. Much appreciated!"
,quadsas,2011-08-12T00:21Z,"I know you guys won't respond, but do you plan on cracking other sport management games? lots and lots of them are left uncracked, even older ones which you can't buy anymore, but are still great"
,frosticle,2011-09-01T21:34Z,"Thanks, again, for all the hard work. I just wanted to let you know that update 4 is out now and it is a good looking one.

As for GHOST11 having problems, I would say it is with you and not the cracked game. I would do a completely clean install and make sure that the settings are correct. If you continue to have a specific problem, search for it on the OOTP forums. There were no problems with the previous cracked versions, that I know of."
