Luckily, filmmaker Domingo de Oliveira had made ├âΓÇ░ Simonal (This Is Simonal) in 1970. The fiction piece stars Simonal as himself and preserved some of what the documentary makers most coveted: images of Simonal in the army, and concert footage from his 1969 show at Maracan├â┬úzinho (Little Maracan├â┬ú), which he gave at the height of his fame. As happy as the filmmakers were to find these elements, the pi├â┬¿ce de la r├â┬⌐sistance was still missing├óΓé¼ΓÇ¥footage from TV Tupi, a broadcaster that no longer existed. It featured Simonal singing ├óΓé¼┼ôThe Shadow of Your Smile├óΓé¼┬¥ with the American jazz great Sarah Vaughn, who recorded in the ├óΓé¼Γäó70s with the likes of Milton Nascimento and Sergio Mendes.
