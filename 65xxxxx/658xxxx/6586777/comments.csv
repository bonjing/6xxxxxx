,catchsumwaves,2011-08-18T16:50Z,"AMI99 Hi in order to download (not upload) you need a client/program to download the torrent. I use Utorrent just do a search in google. Install Utorrent. It will allow you to download any of the torrents such as George Kavassilas Sydney Equinox 2011. Than you will need something to play your downloaded file I use KM player, VLC or Gom. Just search in google and install the above. Btw everything I mentioned is free. Have fun!!!"

Just search in PB for the above programs. Hope this helps."
