Across three oceans and more than two years, marine biologist and filmmaker Rick Rosenthal set out to capture on film the biggest, fastest, most dangerous gamefish in the sea -- the ancient and amazing creatures known as billfish. The group includes the graceful sailfish, the menacing swordfish and queen of them all, the marlin. Marlin can top speeds of 60 miles an hour on migrations that can span 9,000 miles.
