Great Quality, haven't watched the entire film yet but video is fine and audio is fine - sync is spot on.

Thanks soupucia - Nice upload"

1115 SEEDERS AND ONE OTHER COMMENT ALSO WHEN DOWNLOADING IT SAYS I WAS CONNECTED TO OVER 700 OF THE SEEDERS BUT MAX DL SPEED WAS AROUND 30 Kb. 



Maybe it is real but im not spending days downloading to find out when all the signs are pointing to fake."

I never seed exactly because of whiny retards like eye_leech. Cry babies don't deserve my bandwidth."
,grumpy1972,2011-08-06T02:25Z,"Pretty nice quality.

Audio - 9
Video - 9

There's a  paramount Pictures watermark on the bottom of the screen and the name H Stern on the upper right, but it's quite tolerable.  Not a fake so far, though I haven't watched the whole thing yet."
,grumpy1972,2011-08-06T02:27Z,"also @ eye_leech - If it takes days for you to download a torrent this size, maybe you should shoot your fucking squirrel and get a real connection"
,jzenman,2011-08-06T02:50Z,"Don't listen to the nay sayers. This really is a good copy. It's a DVDSCR for sure but it ain't no cam. Someone must have slipped it out the back door of Spielberg's ranch. 

A/9
V/8.5 unless you have a HD then it probably won't look good. "

better than expected since some people said 7.5  or 8, its very watchable, & dl in about 20min thanks dudes"
,grumpy1972,2011-08-06T04:51Z,"I finished watching it and wanted to give a full review of quality.  The music at the end seemed a little off, but that may have just been me, but otherwise it was a fucking great copy.  

V - 8.5
A - 8

The video seemed a little grainy when the scenes were dark, but this is a very watchable copy.  Thanks, uploader!"
,1ursos2,2011-08-06T06:16Z,"REAL, thanks a lot pal ;DDDD."
,dmnrocha2,2011-08-06T08:28Z,"Yay @eye_leech you suck dick. People who post false fakes(Like 95% of the 'fakes' out there) piss me right off. It's not everyone elses fault you're such a n00b! Learn how to dl baddy. As fer the movie, 9min d/l averaging 1.12mbps. Quality.. If you remember VHS you'll be fine."
,dmnrocha2,2011-08-06T08:31Z,"@eye_leech Shit turkey it probly said 2 of 1115 seeds, not 1115. 30kb? Retarded Cow>YOU"
,eye_leech,2011-08-06T12:38Z,"Take back what I say this is real and surprisingly good quality I must have left this Dling over night  This is REAL .

Sorry soupucia."

Sorry soupucia.

Oh and bitches stop moaning at my comment because if you where stood right here infront of me I would slice your throte without hesitation and watch you bleed out. Luckily you wank stains are safe behind your little monitors. 

So I made a snap judgment.... opportunity for all the people with no lives and to much time on their hands to start throwing abuse.  Oh and BTW with this torrent I have shared/uploaded over 600Mb  so far and will continue to do so as always. 

Dont be fooled by the name it is but a stick to provoke."
,eye_leech,2011-08-06T12:54Z,"Also I did say in my original post that maybe it was real but at the time all signs where pointing to fake.

Its ok I forgive you"
,eye_leech,2011-08-06T13:03Z,"@epictroll well im sure you got plenty of the 600+Mb I shared during the night and @grumpy1972 my bandwith might be a little slow at the moment but that is because I am currently sharing over 22 torrents. 

But im not gonna judge or critcize prople for making assumptions without knowing all the facts. We are all guilty of it from time to time."
,divinitymagic,2011-08-06T14:25Z,"@eye_leech... get a grip you moron! 

If your life had a face i'd punch it!"
,JadeyGal,2011-08-06T14:42Z,"@eye_leech I suggest in future you download the file first from now on instead of jumping to conclusions.

,grumpy1972,2011-08-06T23:15Z,"@ eye_leech - I commented on your bandwidth because it played a part in your snap decision to call the torrent a fake.  Plus the mental image of a squirrel powering your router was oddly hard to put out of my head.  

Erroneous snap decisions are easy to arrive at on the internet.  It's all good, bro. :)"

,scottsasse,2011-08-07T01:38Z,"@ eye_leech, You DUMB FUCKTARDED TROLL, how exactly do limp-wrist fruits like you manage to use a butter knife let alone be capable of slitting even your queer squirrels  throat?? Take the hamster out of your ass and wipe the Vaseline off your fingers next time you try to type a comment!!  "
,scottsasse,2011-08-07T02:02Z,Imageshack does not work!! I appeal to everyone to please stop using them. There are plenty of other sites that do not violate the few working images that they actually host.
,pvt.db,2011-08-08T09:17Z,the qual sux balls man. no better than a good cam sound is tinny and the pic is grainy at best. but shot for the upload and size of torrent. awesome movie
,Cr4zyDaN75,2011-08-15T18:00Z,"V=8 bit dark a times
A=7.5 get's a touch distorted at times with big sounds
i thought this was a good flick, Stand by Me meets Goonies meets Cloverfield meets ET...
Plus if you watch the credits and see ""The Case"" look-out for the nice reference to ""Night of the Living Dead"""
,Cr4zyDaN75,2011-08-15T18:01Z,Thanks for the up too! Nice job
,Dr_Dassler,2011-08-19T12:34Z,"EXCELLENT QUALITY COPY
