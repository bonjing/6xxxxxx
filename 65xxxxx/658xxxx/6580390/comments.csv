[T],Zeberzee,2011-08-04T19:28Z,"ok here we go...

@justregged....give me the link or tell me where to find the bluray

@dude888....i'll do mrs doubtfire and twister but they will be around 700mb ...my pc speed is not very good,i dont have a seedbox or anything like that,i only made this one 1GB because its one of my favorite movies

@micmac....thanks :) 

@Kokua651....good question...i like movies from all diffrent genres,i think 60s and 70s movies are some of my favorites,also gangster movies from the 30s-40s,im a big fan of alfred hitchcock, robert de niro,clint eastwood,james dean,marlon brando and klaus kinski [also werner herzog] ,love british movies from the 60s-70s.. i also like many foreign movies[not really keen on japanese movies although battle royale might be one of my upcoming torrents] some of my favorite movies are taxi driver, aguirre,saturday night sunday morning,on the waterfront :) "
,justregged,2011-08-04T20:56Z,"You can get the links from a site called teh paradox but you will need to sign up if u aint a member... its split into 3 interchangeable links from fileserve or filesonic u can take ur pick. Or i can just mail them to you if u have an email address best not to post ur personal mail address on tpb though or you will be bombarded with enlarge your penis emails i guess lol

Anyway google this - Swimming with Sharks teh paradox - it will be the first search result and u will see the page the links are from but wont see the links unless u sign up. Not a bad site to be a member of anyway tbh.
