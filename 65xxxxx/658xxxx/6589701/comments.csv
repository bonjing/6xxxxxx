,Skembear,2011-08-11T09:13Z,"Why is this crap even being discussed?
christian and scientist, the great American oxymoron
One atheist, although not confirmed and everyone else christian, typical fox news type bias
Scientists (real ones) talk of quantifiable processes, christian scientists (bit of upchuck stuck in my throat then) talk nothing but hypebole, metaphore and pseudo science
A question asked, does science need to be saved because Stephen Hawking said there is no god?
Wow, no wonder the world is in such a mess
Needs to be watched to be believed

Thanks to the uploader for a few good belly laughs"
