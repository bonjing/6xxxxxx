Sameer Khanna lives a wealthy lifestyle along     
with his dad, Adesh, and mom, Suman, and          
studies in St. Marks High School. He is           
attracted to statuesque London-returned student,  
Aishwarya Dhawan, while his close friend, Tariq   
Naqvi, likes Nandini Oberoi. The four hang out    
together, though Nandini is resentful of          
Aishwarya and her parents, and even play          
characters in Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet. The   
four, while attending a wild party, have to flee  
when the police raid the premise. Three are able  
to get away, but Sameer is apprehended, held in   
a cell, and beaten by two police inspectors - who 
claim they have evidence that he is a drug peddler
They agree to let him go provided he bribes them  
with Rs.50,000/-. The question remains what will  
Sameer do under these circumstances?
