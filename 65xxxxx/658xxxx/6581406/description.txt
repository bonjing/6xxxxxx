The story is set in a dystopian near-future where the United States have split into 

several extremist factions, and tells the story of Martha Washington, a young 

American girl from a public housing project called "The Green" (see Chicago's 

Cabriniâ€“Green). The series starts with Martha's birth and sees her slowly grow up 

from someone struggling to break free of the public housing project, to being a war 

hero and major figure in deciding the fate of the United States.
