                           The Complete Season 1


Falling Skies is an American science fiction dramatic television series created and produced by Robert Rodat and Steven Spielberg.

The series tells the story of the aftermath of a global invasion by several races of extraterrestrials (including the lizard-like Skitters, a race of seemingly humanoid grey-skinned beings that seem to be their commanders, and mechanical Attack Drones called mechs) that neutralizes the world's power grid and technology, quickly destroys the combined militaries of all the world's countries, and apparently kills over 90% of the human population within a few days. The story picks up six months after the invasion and follows a group of survivors who band together to fight back. The group, known as the Second Massachusetts (an allusion to a historical regiment from the Continental Army), is led by the retired Captain Weaver and Boston University history professor Tom Mason who, while in search of his son Ben, must put his extensive knowledge of military history into practice as one of the leaders of the resistance movement.
