,kik6666,2011-08-08T16:58Z,"THX!!! I'm downloading right now, I'm a fan of this even though I started watching it yesterday :)  O_O"
[V],manOtor,2011-08-08T20:44Z,"@Gexxie and everyone else who is confused:

It says 9 files in the description, because episode 1+2 are one file - the two hour pilot.
Although the series has also a two hour finale the scene release groups seem to have decided to devide it into eps 9+10.
FYI - episode 10 is the final REPACK release :).

Cheers"
,mabus666,2011-08-15T15:36Z,"watched the first season , better title = failing skies

bad wooden acting , mechs look like ed209 from robocop , even after 10 episodes you feel zero emotional connection to any of them

plus the story , so aliens can destroy all our armies before a rebel chef/grandpa macgyver can figure out  armour piercing bullets/communications disruptor , hahaha lol

a spielberg branded turd is still a turd"
[V],manOtor,2011-08-16T14:14Z,"^^lol :D

I'd say it is not the best series I ever watched, but come on..., it's not that bad ;)."
,warrior134,2011-08-22T18:51Z,"Can anyone tell me when season 2 will be out . its so frustrating waiting to see whats going to happen .

,Christobel,2012-04-28T22:13Z,This isnt the best of speilbergs work but still very watchable. warrior134 in answer your question Season 2 of Falling Skies will air on June 17th in the US.
,Asuzejo144,2012-05-02T10:24Z,"Relax you guys, Spiergerg itÂ´s the producer and every or several eps have different directors, like in TAKEN 2002 which in my opinion is the best miniseries of all"
,warmonger3,2012-06-11T22:38Z,Thanks for quality upload. Saw this at Redneck-Mart for 31 bucks (DVD) and decided to get it for free. ;)
