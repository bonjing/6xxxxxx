[V],_F1_,2011-08-07T20:56Z,"Sorry g8mate, I'm too much frustrated about the treatment of some powerful person of TPB with me from the very beginning. I've tried everything to be good to all but ended up with a warning from the staff of Suprbay Forum. I think I was not wrong but I can't debate coz it will result to a definite BAN. I'm totally demoralized now and decided to stop uploading till I cop-up with my mind. I really need a break.

Sorry friends and goodbye as of now. Thank you all for all of your supports."
