This is the OST of The Legend of Zelda 3D, in FLAC, ripped with EAC. Includes CUE file.


It's the one you could get by registering your copy of the game until June 20, 2011, I think. So if you didn't register the game in time, better download! :)

Includes scans of cover and booklet!
The booklet is available in English, German (Deutsch), French (FranÃ§ais), Italian (Italiano), Spanish (EspaÃ±ol), Nederlands and Portuguese (PortuguÃªs).
The quality of these isn't great, because of my scanner. Sorry :(

I tried to be the most accurate possible with the audio tags (and included ReplayGain tags).
