,MoviesR101,2011-08-05T20:29Z,"@ Slickinator - I still do not understand how you get the patch to work? Can you download DvdFab to a folder on your desktop and then replace the patch or do you have to download DvdFab to you program files? It was much easier when there was a key! Can you help?
Thanks!"
