Megafactories: Apache Helicopter
The Apache is perhaps the most lethal attack helicopter in the world. Pass through the security protocols at the Boeing plant in Mesa, Arizona, to see how this battle tank of the air is built. How it is engineered to be a stealth fighter, flying low over the battlefield, resistant to heavy groundfire. Built to take multiple hits yet bring its pilots home. How it is engineered to hide its tracks as it steals through the skies, to evade enemy radar and heat-seeking missiles. How it sports some of the most sophisticated military technology on the planet. Workers at the Boeing plant, and the men who actually fight the battles and return home in the Apache, reveal the secrets of this deadly fighting machine.
