,mehrum,2011-08-21T21:02Z,"I watched the movie. It is crappy and boring. When in shooting scenes approx 30 shots are fired from an clear shot angle (no obstacles, straight, enough time etc) and not a single bullets hits the target you can speak of bullshit. Which the movie is.

A: 9 (troubles with MPlayer makes -1)
V: 10"
