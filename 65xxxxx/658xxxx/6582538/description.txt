These are dvd\\\'s I created for a Friend that did not want to watch this show online.  It is the complete season 1 on 3 single layer discs. 
The original files were 720p and do NOT have the advertisements or the Hub logo on them.

Included are also 3 images for the labels on the Discs if you want to Print or Lightscribe your discs. I used Nero for this, but any label program should work as long as it lets you overlay an image on the disc template.

Now you can enjoy ponies anywhere you have a dvd player : )


I hope you enjoy these as much as my Friend did.
