,72194123,2011-12-22T12:20Z,10 DUPLICATES IN THIS PACK. Sort your shit out before you upload here and waste peoples time and bandwidth with your mislabeled torrent episodes.
,todown,2012-02-07T17:03Z,thx man !
,twijjit,2012-02-19T06:27Z,"wow, yep - lotsa dupes in here - and most of the episode numbers are wrong - not complaining, I'm glad they were made available - but having one person sort it all out and removing the dupes saves 20+ or 100+ other people from having to do it. Still, thanks for makiing these available N2K - will try and repackage these and give you credit for it."
,twijjit,2012-02-19T08:39Z,"Okay, I set up a new torrent for it - the episode numbers are fixed, episode titles added, all duplicates removed, and added a few of my own. :) http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7043421"
