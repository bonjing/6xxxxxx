Hardcore Pawn is an American documentary reality television series produced by Richard Dominick Productions and RDF USA (later Zodiak USA) for truTV about the day-to-day operations of American Jewelry and Loan, a family-owned pawn shop on Greenfield Road between 8 Mile Road and the John C. Lodge Freeway in Detroit, Michigan.
American Jewelry is owned by Les Gold, a 60-year-old man who is the grandson of a pawnbroker who once owned Sam\'s Loans, a now-defunct pawnshop on Michigan Avenue in Detroit. Les first opened American Jewelry at the Green Eight Shopping Center on 8 Mile Road in Oak Park in 1978, moving to its present location in 1993.
The shop's general manager is Les' son, Seth, who also handles the shop's marketing (he claims that if it wasn't for him, the shop\'s only marketing would be "an ad in the Yellow Pages"). The assistant manager is Les' daughter, Ashley, who, as the series debuted, returned to the shop after taking some time off for maternity leave. The sibling rivalry between her and Seth is a common element of many episodes.
The series premiered on August 16, 2010, delivering 2 million viewers, setting a new record as truTV's most-watched series premiere ever.
On June 22, 2011, the day after Hardcore Pawn\'s fourth season debut, the series was picked up for a fifth season.
