,Cortax,2012-02-09T15:16Z,"Might want to skip the dot's as they just disappears when you do a search mate. Thus trying to find S.H.I.E.L.D. becomes S H I E L D and you end up with all to many irrelevant responses.  Only reason I found this one was by using torrent.eu while the TPB search egnine gave me somethong on the order of 34 pages of potential hits among the comics, most with nothing more then a letter or two in common with Shield and 99% with not even a remote connected to marvel. 

In short, you might as well have thrown this torrent into the haystack with a needle if it wasn't for that non-TPB torrent search engine. "
