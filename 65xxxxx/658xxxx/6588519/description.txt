Foobar2000 is a freeware audio player for Windows developed by Peter Pawlowski. Featuring slim graphical interface, the program is light in terms of memory and CPU used, although it has many options and features including features for managing metadata and to obtain high-quality audio. 

While the core is closed-source, the author provides an extensive SDK under the BSD license, with which to develop add-ons. Since version 0.9.5, foobar2000 supports Windows XP and later versions of Windows. The application is multilingual. Read the Readme.txt file to see how to install the APE Plugin.

I find this software excellent for merging files  (mp3/flac/ape)  without any sound glitches occurring.

Having tried many other software applications to do this task I can state that this is the only one which works properly.



Enjoy and Seed!!
