While their names may seem indicative of something exotic and unfamiliar, the music of Shahin Shahida (acoustic and Spanish guitars) and Sepehr Haddad (guitars and keyboards) is smooth, easy-listening material designed to rest comfortably on Western ears. The Iranian-American duo\'s lively sound revolves around Shahin\'s graceful, flamenco-tinged guitar textures, unobtrusively embellished by Sepehr\'s keys and the same low-key, groove-based rhythmic underpinnings that propel the music of 3rd Force. (William Aura and 3rd Force are routinely involved in the production of Shahin & Sepehr\'s music.) East/West Highway is a best-of compilation that samples the duo\'s first four recordings (while also tossing in two new tracks), and it presents a decent showcase of the musicians\' strengths. The pair\'s sound is handsome, intelligent, and refreshing, with just enough rhythmic and ethnic spice to produce a stylish, feel-good atmosphere. Fortunately, for listeners with a taste for smooth, Spanish-flavored music (with occasional Arabic and samba flourishes; \"Jakarta\" and \"Midnight at the Basilica\" are winning examples), they all sound pretty good. Pop the CD in your changer with a few other discs, hit shuffle, and you\'ll likely enjoy the results.
