[S],B.S.O.D,2011-08-08T05:52Z,"got nuked for being out of sync, this one will prolly get nuked for being oversized "
,sealrockswell,2011-08-08T06:00Z,Thx for the reply... Which one should I DL then? 
,sealrockswell,2011-08-08T06:05Z,"Ps: What does ""nuked"" mean exactly?"
,scottmrchicago,2011-08-08T06:18Z,"rar , no good also way too big"

It's complicated, but release groups have to meet a certain set of standards for their releases. If they don't meet those standards, the releases are refused for wider distribution.

This release should have been around 560MBs. This one is over-sized. But what the hell, the quality is good enough for me.  "

Thx for the clarification... This file is still taking stupid long to DL. Oh well, beats using anyone other than eztv. My loyalty remains with eztv always!"
,upload69,2011-08-08T08:34Z,Thanks.
,RobTortureWright,2011-08-08T10:40Z,Wouldnt class it as a nuked file but i downloaded another torrent as its too big a file.

,analu,2011-08-08T21:59Z,"I'm a devoted EZTV fan, but... 

What's happening to EZTV?... I mean, True Blood's season 4 has been oversized from the start: 550mb?! That's too big already for me! I mean, the previous seasons' episodes used to be about 400mb and the quality was always TOP!

700mb?!!... Way too much for me! I lilke to burn each season in 2 DVDs - and this oversized files crap is going to make me used 3 instead - and probably just for 1 or 2 eps! :( It wouldn't be much of a problem, though, if the inherent quality improvement should compensate - but it doesn't... ;/

Plus, two episodes ago, there were glitches in the picture in the file and the three last eps were a bit out of sync... :(

I love you, EZ guys, but... I don't know.............. ;(
Feeling kinda disapointed here....



Anyaway, apart from this, EZTV is still the best! Keep up the good work, which is usually great! 

A big thank you from Portugal. \m/^__^"
,Rzi,2011-08-08T23:25Z,i don't think eztv is the ripper. just uploading the files he can get so complain about the quality to fqm and other groups or don't complain cause it's free stuff you are downloading here anyway. no room to complain about it imo 
,analu,2011-08-09T01:24Z,"@Rzi:

Yup, not worth it complaining about free stuff.
My point was rather to inform and speculate about the recent changes in order for something to change - or get back to the usual AWESOMNESS we'd gotten used to and were, are and always will be GREATFUL for:p

Thus, my emphasis goes to the last lines I wrote before:

''... EZTV is still the best! Keep up the good work, which is usually great! 

A big thank you from Portugal. \m/^__^ ''

I appologise if it sounded like a mere stupid ass complaint :p That was not my intention at all.

Thanx again."
,Rzi,2011-08-09T01:29Z,indeed. it has been almost too perfect :D 
,Jaxx89,2011-08-09T23:06Z,"Did anyone notice that this one is shorter than ASAP
This one is 57m:48s whereas ASAP is 59m:18s
What part is missing?
And now I'll have to download the ASAP version too, just to see."
