[T],Tyr3ll,2011-08-07T12:52Z,"Well,i up several beta and final versions of DVDFab.you can still wait for a next final version if you prefer anyway.
All version is always tested before i up as i know and trust his author.
you can absolutely install each version and overwrite previous version if the method and the author will be the sames.However it's better after each update to uninstall latest previous version as well.Your settings will be preserved anyway.
it doesn't matter it's a just a logical question,no more so.
sorry for my english as it is not always perfect ! (lol)
regards"
