A few large WPA rainbowtables, usable in cowpatty, pyrit or aircrack-ng provided that you are using a 64-bit operating system. Will be adding more tables later on in another torrent. Also included is the wordlist used to generate them. The rainbowtables where generated in pyrit and then exported as cowpatty hashes.

The wordlist is based on the ones provided by Wi-Foo-er but with duplicates removed, i also provided a few secure passwords of my own.
