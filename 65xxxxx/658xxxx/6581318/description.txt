This is a lean, cold knife-thrust of a novel, a revenge fantasy anchored on the compelling voice and savage purpose of its titular Prince. There is never a safe moment in Lawrence's debut."
-Robert Redick, author of The Red Wolf Conspiracy

"Dark and relentless, the Prince of Thorns will pull you under and drown you in story. A two in the morning page turner."
-Robin Hobb, author of The Inheritance

"Vivid...smooth and compelling... gritty and full of wonder. This book is brilliant."
-Galaxy Book Reviews

"Disturbing, Beautiful, Chaotic, Poetic, Haunting, Exhilarating."
-Fantasy Faction

"Without a doubt the most original and most memorable fantasy debut of 2011. It's difficult to imagine how another book could top this one."
