200+ Mac Classic Command & Conquer Missions For NOD and GDI.

For use with the original version (1996) Command And Conquer for Mac classic OS 7.5.3 - OS 9.x 

Included:
Roughly 200 user made and also saved NOD, GDI Missions and dino missions.
Mission making kit (including a step by step guide)
A Mission Editor.
A Money Cheat.

BONUS:

For the original FULL installer NOD and GDI disks go here:
 
http://nyerguds.arsaneus-design.com/isos/cnc_mac/

Burn them to disk and voila !!!
They are in .dmg format. I know they work, because I tried them with my PPC G4 Tower with OS 9.04.

Or you could run it through a non intel with classic on it

OR

Run it through sheepshaver emulation for Mac intel OR sheepshaver for non intel versions.

Hope this helps
