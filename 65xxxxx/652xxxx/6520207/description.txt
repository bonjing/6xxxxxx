Richard Hammonds Engineering Connections Series 3
In a third series Richard Hammond investigates the engineering connections that lie inside some of the most iconic structures on the planet: 

â€¢ a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) tanker designed to carry an ultra-cold cargo with the energy equivalent of 50 nuclear bombs, 
â€¢ the 'earthquake-proof' Rion Antirion Bridge in Greece, 
â€¢ NASA's Space Shuttle, the first re-usable space vehicle, 
â€¢ the sail-shaped Burj al Arab hotel in Dubai, 
â€¢ a Formula 1 car, 
â€¢ the iconic Japanese Bullet Train, the first, and still the most technologically advanced high speed railway system in the world.
â€¢ 
Richard reveals an amazing range of unexpected ideas and legacies hidden deep in their DNA. Through large-scale demonstrations he investigates the crucial technology that makes these structures possible. He shows how, thanks to a WW2 German submarine, the Space Shuttle protects itself from self-destruction at launch. He creates his own earthquake to see what's required to save the Bullet Train from severe seismic shocks - proof even against the biggest earthquake ever to hit Japan. And with a steam 'bomb' he explosively reveals just how much power the apparently old-fashioned technology can deliver to power an LNG tanker. Richard makes the surprising connections that make possible the greatest miracles of modern engineering.


1)  Burj Al Arab 
The Burj Al Arab (Arabic: Ø¨Ø±Ø¬ Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø±Ø¨â€Ž,Tower of the Arabs) is a luxury hotel located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. At 321 m (1,053 ft), it is the fourth tallest hotel in the world. The Burj Al Arab stands on an artificial island 280 m (920 ft) out from Jumeirah beach, and is connected to the mainland by a private curving bridge. It is an iconic structure whose shape mimics the sail of a ship.

2)  Formula 1 
Richard Hammond reveals the surprising engineering connections behind the Formula 1 car. The stars of the most glamorous, and expensive sport on earth wouldn't even cross the starting line without inspiration drawn from a revolutionary 19th-century cannon, ancient sailing boats, jet engine fan blades, body armour and a technique practised by blacksmiths for thousands of years.

3)  Super Tanker 
Richard Hammond reveals the ingenious engineering required to transport one of the most potentially hazardous cargoes in the world in some of the biggest vessels afloat. The huge ships, bigger than the Titanic, carry enough fuel to heat a city the size of London for a week - the energy equivalent of 55 Hiroshima atom bombs. Shipping this potentially volatile cargo required engineering solutions inspired by cutlery, mid-air refuelling and fire engines.

4)  The Earthquake Proof Bridge 
Richard Hammond reveals how engineers made one of the longest bridges in the world earthquake-proof. Building a structure almost 3 kilometres long in water 65 metres deep was almost the least of the engineering challenges of bridging the Gulf of Corinth in Greece. The construction would cross one of the most active seismic fault lines in Europe. Defying disaster called for solutions inspired by fragrant Indian incense, the ring-pull in a soda can, a tobbogan, a hammock, and some shiny steel chimneys.

5)  The Space Shuttle 
Richard Hammond reveals the engineering connections in NASA's Space Shuttle - the world's first re-usable space craft. He goes backstage at Kennedy Space Centre, in Florida, to discover how an organ pump, tram tracks, a WWII anti-sonar device, a camera iris and a cannonball all helped create the most technologically advanced machine ever engineered by man. Conceived in the early 1970's as the successor to the Apollo Moon missions, the Shuttle is a delivery system, designed to transport payloads such as the Hubble Telescope, and most of the International Space Station, into orbit, and return for its next cargo. The delivery van is the Orbiter - what most people call the Shuttle - which is mated with a huge external fuel tank and rocket boosters which are all jettisoned. Surviving the huge destructive forces of travelling to space and returning in usable form called for ingenious engineering compromises. The Shuttle is a rocket for the first part of its life, then morphs into a plane for the return journey..

6)  Bullet Train 
Richard Hammond reveals the surprising engineering connections between Japan's Bullet Train, the world's first high-speed train, and ancient charioteers, a crowbar, a medieval clock, the electric telegraph and a 19th-century luxury racing car. Nearly fifty years old, the Bullet Train is still pioneering new high-speed technology. Richard builds his own train to show how engineers reinvented the train wheel to prevent it violently shaking at its top speeds of close to 200mph (300kph).
