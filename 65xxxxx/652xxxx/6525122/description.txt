Storyline: Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto,
they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were
archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some
familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process,
a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and
Professor X's X-MEN.

Uploader Note: After lots of stupid "groups" out of sync/bad audio encodes,IMAGiNE version
is a little better but still audio is very weak (from CAM) and also in or out of sync
in some parts so please wait for dvdrip/proper release from MAXSPEED and ignore these epic
failing old story r5 releases with LINE audio,as always wait for the best quality and stop
waisting your time/bandwidth and movies.
