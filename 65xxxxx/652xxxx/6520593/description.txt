Yes
â€œFirst Unionâ€
April 09, 1991 
Pensacola, Florida
Pensacola Civic Center

Two-camera edit 
Double DVD set with Dolby 5.1 audio

PRODUCED in SEPTEMBER 2010 by TOOLEMAN TV

Later RIPPED OFF and "OFFICIALLY RELEASED" by Gonzo/Voiceprint on their 2011 box set "Yes Union Live"

(Apparently Yes thought so much of this fan-produced video that they used it as a bonus disk in their Gonzo/Voiceprint "Union Live" set, AFTER REMOVING THE CREDITS and blanking out the ON-SCREEN WATERMARKS placed there by TOOLEMAN TV! That's right, folks, they ripped-off our labor of love to make a few bucks. But why pay for it when it was intended to be free from the very outset of the project?)

On April 9, 1991, Yes debuted its 8-man line-up and kicked off the Union world. Not one but TWO video cameras captured the momentous event. 

Now, for the first time ever, TooleManTVâ€™s â€œFirst Unionâ€ presents the union of these two videos. Every note of the first concert by this legendary line-up is captured here. 

This is no ordinary single-cam fan video. â€œFirst Unionâ€ cuts between the two camera angles like a professionally edited video, bringing you up-close with each member of Yes as they take solos and share the spotlight. 

This two-DVD set features a fantastic Dolby Digital 5.1 mix of the stereo sound recorded by the two cameras. The video comes from high-quality direct transfers of copies of the original camcorder tapes, which were destroyed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina! These are not re-authored single-disk DVD's in lower quality, which is what you get from the Gonzo version and other rip-offs. 

Prepare to be blown away by the opening night excitement!

Lineage: 8mm camcorder tapes -> VHS -> DVD -> TooleManTVâ€™s editing suite -> â€œFirst Unionâ€

Note: the original 8mm camcorder tapes and first-gen VHS copies were lost in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

The DVD's made from the first-gen VHS copies are the best available sources that exist. Other copies, including the Gonzo single-disk version, have been re-authored and suffer from a further loss in quality. 

Approximately 25% of the show was captured by only one of the cameras. Between the two cameras, the entire show was recorded.
