Hi All,

 

It has recently come to my attention that on 5/7/2011 an example of the Level 1 pack was circulated to you; unfortunately we mistakenly included the CU membership list within this document.  We have apologised to the CU for this error but would also ask you all to ensure you delete these lists from your records as a matter of urgency.  We are sure you will appreciate this is sensitive information that should remain confidential.  Please be assured this error will not be repeated.

 

Thanks in advance,

 

Shane
