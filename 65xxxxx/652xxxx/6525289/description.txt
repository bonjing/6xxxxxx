      PLOT SUMMARY      
                                                                  
     After a run-in with the law, Haley Graham (Missy Peregrym)   
       is forced to return to the world from which she fled some      
       years ago. Enrolled in an elite gymnastics program run by      
     the  legendary  Burt  Vickerman  (Jeff Bridges),  Haley's    
     rebellious  attitude  gives  way to something  that  just    
       might be called team spirit.
