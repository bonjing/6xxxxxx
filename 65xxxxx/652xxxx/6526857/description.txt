About DREAM THEATER:

Progressive metal band Dream Theater formed in 1985 under the name Majesty by John Petrucci, John Myung and Mike Portnoy. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010, when Mike Portnoy left the band. In October 2010, the band held auditions for a new drummer, and added Mike Mangini to its roster.

Dream Theater\\\'s tenth studio album, Black Clouds & Silver Linings (Roadrunner Records), was released on June 23, 2009. It entered the U.S. Billboard 200 at #6 and Eurochart Hot 100 at #1, marking their highest entry on either chart. Black Clouds & Silver Linings - a highlight of their 25-year career - was praised by Mojo magazine\\\'s Paul Elliott: \\\"...their lofty ideals remain intact. By modern criteria, Black Clouds & Silver Linings is as highbrow as The Mars Volta, as grandiose as Muse and as heavy as Metallica.\\\"

The legendary progressive metal masters have sold in excess of 10,000,000 records and DVDs worldwide.
