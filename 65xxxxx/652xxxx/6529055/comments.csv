[T],Tyr3ll,2011-07-14T18:57Z,"few trackers are closed !!!
check your list and delete them !!!
I suggest you to add more from the list of my ashampoo torrent
you can just open torrent file without completely downloading this one
copy-paste all trackers from and add them to this one directly in your list of trackers.
