Review by your friendly neighborhood Hyperdrive25
-------------------------------------------------
Of all of Sam Raimi's films, this is the one I cherish. Liam Neeson's acting is very realistic. He has a dual personality in this one, that of the scientist and that of the man he is becoming: Darkman. Darkman's character throughout the film is single-minded coupled with bouts of rage. There is an element of horror in this film, bit it is not continuous. Raimi opted for fast paced action thrills which opts over the horror element. The science fiction part of the film is the one that is the backbone of the film. Visual effects are superb and far ahead of the time at which the film was released. Danny Elfman's (Batman, Red Dragon, Army Of Darkness) score is superb as always and comlements the dark atmosphere of the film. The excellent photography is by Bill Pope (Pet Cemetery, Army Of Darkness, The Matrix).
