Legendary album that gave birth to the "world" music genre. According to the liner notes it was probably the first African album recorded in stereo in the US. Olatunji had many well known fans - John Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie, Santana, Bob Dylan, Bob Weir, et al. Santana covered "Jin-Go-Lo-Ba" on their first LP. Bob Dylan name-checked Olatunji on his "Freewheelin'" album. Olatunji played on Cannonball Adderley's "African Waltz" album in 1961.
The recording sounds very good, nice space and three dimensionality.
