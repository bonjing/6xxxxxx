Fun John Wayne comedy/adventure, and a cool snapshot of the Africa of that era, just before it all went to hell."
,jyanendra,2011-07-09T23:52Z,"A truly great blast from the past! One of the classics I grew up with back in India.
Great acting. Great camera-work. Great scenery.
Great fun for the  entire family.
Released in June 1962 actually.
Great upload for those who missed out on a gem.
We miss such ones.
We also miss the Africa that was then."
