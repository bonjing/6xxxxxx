I've once been buying the three most popular Bijelo Ducme CDs at ebay and I really love them. My favourite Bijelo song forever will be ""Kad bi bio bjelo dugme"" because of perfect harmony between guitar, organ and voice and some nice remindings of some months at youth.
Keep History of pop and rock music alive ..."

Song ""Kad bi bio bijelo dugme"" (If I Were a White Button) is the opening track on their 1974 album, of the same name. It is considered the most heavy metal-oriented album of their 16 year career. At the time the band was strongly influenced by the heavy metal pioneers such as Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple. "
