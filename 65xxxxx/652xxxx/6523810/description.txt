The Rothschilds - War Wealth Politics and Powerâ€¬â€

Full Title: Rothschild and the Secret History of the International Bond Market - War Wealth Politics and Powerâ€¬â€ 

The wealth of the Rothschilds is said to sum up to 500 trillion (sic!) dollars - half of the total wealth of humankind! Forget the Fortune 500 list - it's a deception. That magazine like so many others is in all likelihood being owned by the Rothschilds too. Did you know that Rothschild made his fortune by using messenger pigeons? Do you want to know how? Watch the film - and there's nice music too.
