[T],zombifuzz,2011-07-10T06:54Z,"burnashes, thanks for coming around again. I hope to use this to get unsigned/lesser known bands some serious attention. Things are going to be slow at first but I promise to find some of the greatest lesser known bands out there for everyone to enjoy.

The bands sending stuff in are great for allowing me to do this."
