          Plot/Summary 
     A psychopath known as Buffalo Bill is kidnapping and murdering young women 
     across the midwest. Believing it takes one to know one, the F.B.I. sends 
     Agent Clarice Starling (Foster) to interview a demented prisoner who may 
     provide psychological insight and clues to the killer's actions. The 
     prisoner is psychiatrist, Dr. Hannibal Lector (Hopkins), a brilliant, 
     murderous cannibal who will only help Starling if she feeds his morbid 
     curiosity with details about her own complicated life. This twisted 
     relationship forces Starling not only to confront her psychological 
     demons, but leads her to face with a demented, heinous killer, an 
     incarceration of evil so powerful, that she may not have the courage -- or 
     strength -- to stop him!
