Londonbeat was originally a UK and American R&B and Dance band who scored a number of pop and dance hits in the early 1990s. Band members include Americans Jimmy Helms (who also had a successful solo career and sang radio jingles for the likes of Radio Hallam and Hereward Radio in the UK) and George Chandler (formerly a founding member and frontman of The Olympic Runners), with Jimmy Chambers (born 20 January 1946), from Trinidad, and multi-instrumentalist William Henshall UK born (credited as Willy M).

Londonbeat's career started in the Netherlands where There's a Beat Going On reached the Top 10, and then 9 A.M (The Comfort Zone) which subsequently became a modest success in the United Kingdom. They are best known for their song I've Been Thinking About You, which hit no 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts in 1991, and for their close harmonies.
