The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This seventeenth alphabetical installment is: Els-Fh

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 750-800gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.

Today's offering: DC from Els-Fh

Plus some fine comics from Quality, IDW, Claypool and even Marvel.
 
Enjoy!

If you are old enough to remember the 1960s Cain and Abel, the caretakers of DC's House of Mystery and House of Secrets you may find Elvira a bit of a change. Of course that means you are old enough to remember these comics, and the real Elvira from her younger days on TV. If you do, you know what I mean. Yes I realize I didn't say anything to warrant that last statement. But If you know what I mean, you know what I was thinking, but did not say. If you know what I was thinking, but did not say, you may well be the one who is sending me messages in my head. Would you please talk to my psychiatrist so she knows I'm not making this up? I think she will be interested to talk to someone who thinks they know what a stranger on the internet is thinking, but did not say, and furthermore believes s/he is sending him messages in his head. One of us is leaving that meeting on meds.
Anyway the first two items below are big Elvira bonus material. Two big bonuses.

One of these Fawcett Funny Animals, see below, was Hoppy. Hoppy was a "bunny". This was considerably to early for the Playboy kind. Hoppy belonged to the Marvel family, as in Captain Marval aka Shazam. The Marvel family have super powers. Hoppy is a super rabbit. Hoppy. The Marvel. Bunny. To be fair, the superman family eventually had a dog, a cat, a monkey and a horse. Not to be confused with Lois, Lana, Jimmy and a horse.
