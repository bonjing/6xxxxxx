Hi,

Thanks to the web, now is probably the first time a human can travel through all available music world wide. In principle I do not totally agree with the used methods but I simply could not resist the opportunity and built a MP3 Pop (plus) Database for my granddaughter called "The day before you came". 

While collecting I compiled some playlists. Including the best (sounding) MP3 files ranging from Blues to Indie and from Jazz to Metal (avoiding some disturbing noise). After finalising an Indie Top 100+1 (Play in Reverse) I had the feeling the set (50 + 1) was more or less complete (and honour the involved artists).

Yes Iâ€™m a freeloader (too).... and now its time to do something back. So I named the set â€œDutch Treatâ€ and gave it back to the Web. However,  I cannot seed it for ever and I closed my Torrents after a while, disappointing people looking for some missing parts. Therefore one Torrent was created that includes the whole set and will be available until 10 complete copies are uploaded. So it very much depends on you whether other people can get a complete copy too. So make an exception this time.

Another reason to publicise these lists, I found in the changing music world itself.  The technique has grown up and large machinery (and companies) to organize the pop-business is no longer needed. This gives rise to a new mainstream, now called Indie (from Independent) and will have some major impact.

For instance in location (studio to home) and sound (studio - privately used equipment). That means more time to concentrate on the music and more time to concentrate on the words.  A bit like it was when Rock & Roll Music started to make an impact. 

The tone has changed though. From complaining and protesting, to explaining and story telling (clean, tight, self convidenced and target conscious). If I am not mistaken, Rock & Roll music has matured into a new inspiring (and hope giving) phase. Just like we felt the first time in the sixties. A bit like the son of Sting (in Fiction Plane). The song "Play in Reverse" from â€œLex Landâ€ sais it all. It has become my new "Yesterday".

All compilations are 100% clean HQ VBR MP3 files. Fully labelled and include a nice picture (from the web) I use as a folder. Enjoy and consider buying for true sound quality and support.
