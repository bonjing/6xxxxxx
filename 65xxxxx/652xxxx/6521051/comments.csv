,fedeval,2011-07-07T00:17Z,"thanks FTD, I was waiting for this one. Hope quality is as good as Rango.

,ftservd,2011-07-07T00:53Z,"@HolyRoses I didn't know there was a tag the belonged to you.  It just says appletv and its hd.  Should I use another that would describe the upload I""m just trying to help Apple TV people get UL tailored to them."
,ftservd,2011-07-07T01:09Z,@fedeval If your referring to my Rango release this is of comparable quality.  I just watched it I found no big flaws just minor artifacts from more compression and in my opinion is V 8.9 A 10.  Rango was V10 A10 the CG came through good in the encode.
,isparkle,2011-07-07T04:51Z,Thank you so much for yet another great release for the apple tv :).
,ftservd,2011-07-07T08:51Z,@isparkle Thx.  Are you enjoying the Apple TV experience.  Wonder how many of us are on here? Hope these UL's are helping some of you see some good content on your Apple TV.  I won't give you guys lame quality!!
,fedeval,2011-07-10T12:51Z,"Great quality, thanks. You are also uploading great classics. Do you think you could upluad in this format the xmen saga?.
Thanks again"
