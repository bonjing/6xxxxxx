,Slammer94,2011-07-10T23:55Z,"It's not high res, but it's still pretty freaking good! Thanks for a uploading a great vid that's iPod ready! I can't figure out what you're all complaining about. Looks almost DVD quality to me (at least on my iPod touch) so I give it a 10 for both audio and video. Thank you. "
