But upon starting the tool, it will download the current version from the kaspersky homepage anyway.

,motley666,2011-07-08T02:30Z,BigNoise as you can see the description is missing something and it won't let me edit. I wanted to add that many users don't know this utility so they can find it here more easily by checking this site. So my aim was to let people learn about this powerful app that saved my pc even if they use the newer version.
