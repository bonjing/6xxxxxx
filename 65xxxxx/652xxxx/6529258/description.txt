This is Acorn 3.0.2 patched to accept any serial that begins with: FMAC30-

EX: FMAC30-ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

So just copy to your Applications folder and activate with any serial.

The previous upload didn't work because I didn't realize that file permissions aren't stored in torrents (doh).
