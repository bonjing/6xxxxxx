A/9 (Has English hardcoded subs for the foreign language parts) 
V/8 
Plot: Takes place in 1995, the year of the second referendum on the separation of Quebec. In the dead of winter, a serial killer is on the loose in the small Montreal neighborhood of Notre Dame de Grace. The tenants of an old apartment house must figure out who they can trust and who they canâ€˜t. 
Pictures in 16:9 format instead of the usual 4:3 format, thereâ€˜s some slight focus issues here and there but all in all itâ€˜s a decent copy and is certainly watchable... 
Many Thanx to IwannaFan2 and IFLIX for the Good rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"
