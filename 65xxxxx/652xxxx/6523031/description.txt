 This volume is number ten in the 11-volume Handbook of the History of Logic. This handbook covers the rich history of scientific turning points in Inductive Logic, including probability theory and decision theory.

 While there are many examples were a science split from philosophy and became autonomous (such as physics with Newton and biology with Darwin), and while there are, perhaps, topics that are of exclusively philosophical interest, inductive logic - as this handbook attests - is a research field where philosophers and scientists fruitfully and constructively interact. 

 Written by leading researchers in the field, both this volume and the Handbook as a whole are definitive reference tools for senior undergraduates, graduate students and researchers in the history of logic, the history of philosophy, and any discipline, such as mathematics, computer science, cognitive psychology, and artificial intelligence, for whom the historical background of his or her work is a salient consideration.
 Serves as a singular contribution to the intellectual history of the 20th century. 
 Contains the latest scholarly discoveries and interpretative insights
