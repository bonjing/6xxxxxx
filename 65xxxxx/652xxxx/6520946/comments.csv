,wayo1234,2011-07-07T12:49Z,This has english audio. Looks kinda cheesy. :-) Go for another torrent if you prefer the Japanese audio with english subs.

,bloodred125,2011-11-17T01:53Z,English versions of foriegn movies are fckin stupid. They should destroy english dub overs for good. How could you enjoy stupid fckin english fck head actors talking over the real actors?
,xhizors,2011-12-16T21:13Z,"bloodred125: to each their own, why don't you go mind your own business. there are two options: 1) Read subtitles that are chopped up and shortened to death so people can read them fast enough. 2) Listen to an english dub that looks pretty cheesy, but can use more complexities in speech.

Who cares. Neither is better than the other."
