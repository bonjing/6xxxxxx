you are in hard conflict with a japanese peer !
use utorrent 2.2.1 maximum and quickly fix
your connection or i will be forced to ban your ip !
Anyway,to all peers :
if you freeze,please,disconnect and check what's wrong with you,first !
don't insisting anymore !
it's completely stupid !
the only thing you will do is to ruin my seed !

[T],Tyr3ll,2011-07-14T18:58Z,"few trackers are closed !!!
check your list and delete them !!!
I suggest you to add more from the list of my ashampoo torrent
you can just open torrent file without completely downloading this one
copy-paste all trackers from and add them to this one directly in your list of trackers.
