,bumchunder,2011-08-28T12:07Z,My antivirus blocked a trojan on the keygen... explain?
,htd01,2011-09-09T07:30Z,"Keygens often contain a program that accesses areas of your system the same way a typical TROJAN would, and alter certain values.  My advice to you is to turn off av protection, make sure the keygen zip is not deleted, then unzip to desktop.  Turn AV on and run, if it still deletes the keygen, it will leave the zipfile alone.  Turn off av, unzip keygen again, then run it.  Once it is finished running, you may turn av back on.  Once the keygen is deleted, the key should still work."
