This disc represents one of a two show concert (the other is 'Blues Is My Business') given by Lightnin' Hopkins in the States in 1971. No info on where the recording took place or who the bass player and drummer accompanying Hopkins are, either. The recording source is probably board tape with strange volume fluctuations, microphone poppings, and occasional feedback, oddly mixed in stereo. Audio disclaimers aside, this recording would be a welcome addition to anyone's collection as Hopkins is in rare form, telling incomprehensible jokes as he charms the pants off his audience while playing and singing his heart out.
