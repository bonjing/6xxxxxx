I was such an avid fan of the Forbrydelsen I that I downloaded series 2 and watched it despite the disappointing English subs which made you wince at times.However I do appreciate the efforts of the uploader.I  can confirm series 2 is awesome with Lund and sweater still kicking ass and will watch this download and post ratings,Many thanks       "

Skimmed through and looks a brilliant upload with A=10 INCLUDING SUBSand V=10.Having rated series 1 as 10 I would rate series 2 at 9.Many thanks DAVIDOUU for the hard work for us.Slow download but promise it's worth the wait.
,davidouu,2011-07-25T21:15Z,Cheers MickMac.....unfortunately you are at the mercy of other downloaders as far as speed is concerned...I am unable due to my location seed continuously.....I seeded the file through 3 weeks and uploaded some 46 gig of files from my machine.....it seems that many just download the files and then fk off and don't bother seeding once they have their files downloaded......Should there be no movement please post here and I will reseed the files....
