Ok...First off my thanks go to Joan for making the full images of the Danish release second series of this brilliant show.
I have ripped the images and created 10 XVID avi files and have spent a week or more painstakingly re editing the English subtitles that are in SRT format and in English.

That\'s proper English as spoken and not the subtitles that are currently doing the rounds which clearly have been translated from the Dutch subtitle files that accompany the dvd\'s.

All have been re edited and synchronised with these 10 episodes and will give those of you who can\'t wait for BBC4 to broadcast this series an opportunity to enjoy a series that is even better than the first.

On a technical note, the files are made using the xvid codec, all letterbox aspect ratio, and use mp3 audio with a CBR of 128......blah blah blah.....

Do you want to see it?
Is it watchable?
Will I understand it ?

Answer....Yes to all.

Please seed as you can.
