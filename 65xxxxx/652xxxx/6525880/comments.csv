also can anyone suggest me games like shadow of the colosus and ico??"
,shikibane,2011-08-04T07:32Z,@nicholes shadow of the colossus and ico work fine when i burn it so i have no clue why it wouldn't work when you put it on your hardrive. I wish i could help but i'm not really sure what could be wrong.
,nicholes,2011-08-05T13:08Z,"both games are working fine when burn on to dvd. but shadow of the colosus does not work when we put iso on the hard drive, but ico works fine. anyways thanks for the replay."
