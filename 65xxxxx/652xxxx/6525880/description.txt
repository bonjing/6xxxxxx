This iso contains Ico & Shadow Of The Colossus on 1 dvd5 disk just burn at 4x with your favorite burning program to a single dvd-5 disk. I tested this iso and it works with Esr, and Swap Magic 3.6&3.8 

How to use --- When you get to this screen "http://bayimg.com/MaIfnAADi" press x then it will show another screen with the name of the games choose which one you want to play click x on it then it will load.


Important Info: Ico has a DVD Pal 50hz & Ntsc 60hz selector (When you start it will flicker select language you want the game to be in then pal(50hz)or ntsc(60hz) and flickering will stop. For english just press x on the first startup screen, then choose pal-left or ntsc-right for your pal or ntsc ps2 console. You'll know when you choose the right one cause the screen will stop flickering.
