,runner121,2011-09-26T02:22Z,"Hi HR thank you so much for uploading this movie. I'm having some trouble changing metadata or adding subtitles using iSubtitle. The movie plays smoothly as it is, but as soon as I try to change the metadata of add subtitle my appletv2 won't play it anymore but I still can see it in iTunes. Can you please help with this? I appreciated big time."
