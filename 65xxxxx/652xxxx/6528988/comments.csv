,kira75,2011-07-10T13:15Z,sorry mate but why u make it with such a resolution 1440!!!!! and not 1920 witch is the normal one for 1080p format....i have to re size it to 16:9 for watching it on my TV...keep the good work.... 
,jorrell0733,2011-07-10T17:00Z,RE: kira75 The resolution is untouched as the BBC broadcast at 1440x1080 not 1920x1080 mate
