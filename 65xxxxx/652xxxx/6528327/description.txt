BERNARD ALLISON KEEPIN THE BLUES ALIVE
Label Cannonball
Original Released: 1997
Format:Mp3@320

Using a group of hand-picked Chicago musicians he was friendly with, and borrowed equipment, Bernard Allison recorded his stunning U.S. debut, Keepin' the Blues Alive. The album was released early in 1997, perfectly blending traditional post-WWII Chicago blues with a few blues-rock riffs from the 1970s and '80s thrown in. Songs like "Young Boy's Blues," "When I'm Lonely" and "Tell Me Why" demonstrate a refreshing approach to blues songwriting reminiscent of Louisiana bluesman Larry Garner. ~ Richard Skelly
