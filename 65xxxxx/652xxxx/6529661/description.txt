The 1998â€“99 season was the most successful season in the history of Manchester United.[1][2][3] The club claimed a treble of trophies (the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League), becoming the first side in English football to achieve such a feat. Over the course of the season, United lost only five times, including a one-off Charity Shield fixture, their League Cup quarter-final against eventual winners Tottenham Hotspur and a league fixture at home to Middlesbrough in December 1998. A run of 33 matches unbeaten in all competitions soon followed, beginning on 26 December at home to Nottingham Forest.
The team's never-say-die attitude, instilled in previous seasons was focal to their success as they often snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. Wins in the FA Cup against Liverpool and holders Arsenal en route to lifting the trophy exemplified this. The crowing moment though was United's dramatic comeback in the Champions League final, when Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar SolskjÃ¦r both scored injury time goals to overturn Bayern Munich's first half lead.
The treble haul is often regarded by fans and writers as manager Alex Ferguson's finest hour, although he has dismissed that assertion in later years.[4] Tens of thousands of fans lined the streets of Manchester to welcome the team as the season drew to a close. In recognition of his achievements, Ferguson was awarded a knighthood shortly after[5] and handed the Freedom of the City of Glasgow in November 1999.[6]
Manchester Unitedâ€™s achievement was also matched off the field, officially becoming the worldâ€™s richest football club[7][8] and the most valuable sporting brand worldwide.[7] The club however was at the centre of a takeover threat by BSkyB, [9] only for the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to reject such advances in March 1999.[10]
