Question: What release version contains the 2 tracks (67-68) from 666 intl (mine ends at 66), and when the fuck is their 2011 release due?"

Many of us are stuck at 64% for a while now, could someone please seed ? 

Thanks in advance."

Nothing has changed, we're still stuck at 64%.

Is someone kind enough to help on this ?"

Hopefully someone will help us seed the rest of the album..."
