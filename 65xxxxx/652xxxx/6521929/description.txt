New AutoEvony release as of may 30, 2011. Sorry it took so long to get this up. But the file's legit and it's worth the download

AutoEvony is an automated bot which assists in the building of cities, troops, attacking npcs, etc. This bot can do everything you can except at a more efficient pace.

WARNING: DO NOT LEAVE THIS PROGRAM RUNNING 24/7 AS THIS MAY SET A RED FLARE TO EVONY ADMIN. 

Evony does not seem to enforce anti-bot rules on some servers, but do not take the risk, leave AutoEvony running for perhaps 8 hours at a time.
