Release info:

Damaru Records is proud to present the second full length album of Antagon which is called 'Amnesia'. During the last year, Lars Peter (Antagon) refined his own style of dark psychedelic trance which combines strong kicking bass drums with spacy alienated sounds in a brilliant production. Eleven new and unreleased tracks from 148 to 175 bpm will catapult you into a dark and weird sphere of psychedelic music mastered by Tim Schuldt.
