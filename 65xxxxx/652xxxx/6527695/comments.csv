,dee_mer80,2011-07-12T13:02Z,no sound..can not install driver...and also graphics cant be installed...is it really like this originally?
,redback38,2011-07-12T13:39Z,"hi!...audio has been tough to implement,i have found a number of scripts over the net but,due to issues with them,im coding my own for future releases......as for graphics drivers,the builder has a function for adding driver packs during the build,but its a vry large .iso already,i was tryin to keep it light as possible,but intergration is on the list for future releases..and yes it was like that originally the standard graphics drivers are ok for PE/rescue/browsing/downloading work,its not really meant for top level game playing...thank you for the feedback:-)"
