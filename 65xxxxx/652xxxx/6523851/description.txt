Nearly 60 years ago, the U.S. Air Force
became an independent service. This year,
as we commemorate the 60th anniversary
of our proud service, we also reaffirm our
commitment to today's fight. We celebrate
where we've come from to get where we are
today â€” evolving into a service of Airmen
warriors who have the most advanced
weapons systems available to them.
Airman magazine's almanac, "The Book
2007," provides a comprehensive look at
today's Air Force. Published annually since
1992, The Book continues to be one of the
most popular issues.

This year's almanac introduces you
to the Air Force's leadership; recognizes
the 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year;
includes detailed information about
each major command's organizational
structure; highlights the more than 30
field operating and direct reporting units;
includes an "A-Z" listing of the Air Force's
weapons inventory, space, missile and air
base defense assets; and provides you a
graphical snapshot of the Air Force budget,
personnel demographics, and awards and
decorations.
