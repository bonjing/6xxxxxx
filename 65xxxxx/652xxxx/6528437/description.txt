Mr Glegg writes about the adventure of inventing: where to begin, how to think about a problem, what principles to apply in tackling it, choosing between one possible design and another, and so on. He takes the reader through each of these stages in turn, illuminating his discussion with often highly entertaining examples from his own wide experience as an inventor, consulting engineer, company director and university teacher.

Although he here adopts a more systematic approach than in his earlier book, The Design of Design, Mr Gleggâ€™s evident enjoyment of engineering is still apparent and is communicated to the reader. It is a book that will be especially helpful to the young designer who lacks experience and self-confidence, while also appealing to the old hand, who will find that he still has something fresh to learn from it.
