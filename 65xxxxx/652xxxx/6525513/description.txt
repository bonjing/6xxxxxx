ORBX FTX YPMQ Port Macquarie: 
http://fullterrain.com/product_ypmq.html

The John Ross classic Port Macquarie Airport that was first seen in FS2004 and revised as Orbx freeware for FSX, has now been given a new life with over 85 square kilometres of the latest licensed Nearmap aerial imagery superbly annotated by Tim Harris. Additionally all the original models have been revised and improved with TextureFlow added for vastly improved performance. We've also made a completely new airport precinct using 15cm digital imagery with brand new line markings and lighting systems. Finally we added many new objects, PeopleFlow tech and atmospheric sounds. This is Port Macquarie like you've never seen it before - a beautiful, living breathing coastal city that is breathtaking to fly into and do circuits around. Add it to your east coast airports collection now!
