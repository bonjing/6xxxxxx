[T],thetorrentlord,2011-07-09T17:49Z,"I have yet to see them issue a proper for a WebDL yet. Try the 720p version if you can find one. This was not my rip, just downloaded and shared it here."
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-07-10T05:08Z,@Angelus45 : FYI the last two episodes also had parts where it skipped with no sound and neither one has been re-released.
,Angelus45,2011-07-11T17:47Z,"Thanks for the info @thetorrentlord.
The 350Mb versions skips too?"
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-07-12T15:57Z,I have not tried the 350MB yet but I will soon.
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-07-13T00:52Z,Anyone else having problems? I am testing the file on 2 different computers and 2 different media players and one stand alone Blu-ray player today and if I succeed in playing without problems  I will redo the whole file as a new torrent tomorrow.
