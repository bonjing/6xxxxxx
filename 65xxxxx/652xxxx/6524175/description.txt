List of known issues
There is a known conflict between Acronis True Image Home Nonstop Backup and the Avira antivirus software. This conflict could result in the error: â€œOperation has been aborted. The item essence is incorrect. Probably metadata in the file archive is corruptedâ€. This error will appear in the Acronis program when rebooting after having installed the Avira antivirus software This conflict occurs only with Avira antivirus. Other antivirus solutions do not conflict with Nonstop Backup. Both companies are working closely together to find a solution. Once known, a solution will be delivered by either Avira or Acronis.
