This collection is only a start! Right now I have most of the tablature books from Dream Theater in the best qualities I could find available on the internet, as well as John Petrucci's Suspended Animation book, one of the most sought-after tab books, and Black Clouds & Silver Linings

I would very much like to add to this collection, so I need the communities' help in either tracking down or creating high-quality and full-band backing tracks (minus guitar) for playing along with the tab books. This will aid in creating a complete go-to reference for playing Dream Theater music!
