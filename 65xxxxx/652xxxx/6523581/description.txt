This Album has some very Good tracks like the Abrar\'s brilliant Debut \"Billo\". Ali Haiders \"Wala Wai\" and \"Koi Darwaza\" (Based on Famous Pushto Song Tunes)and Shehzad Roys\' Dholna is very good except for his fake accnet pretending he has lived in Europe an dcanot speak Urdu properly just like Hadiqa, Hate these fake accents ! Why can\'t they be themselves?
