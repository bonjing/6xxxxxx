The audio is ahead of the video by more than one complete second. This trash of a torrent should be deleted as well as your ""Trusted"" status.

Check your work before you post such garbage. Waste of my time..."

,rhodyvik,2011-12-13T04:01Z,He's right. Audio is a full 1 second behind in the beginning and slowly becomes 1.5 seconds towards the end of the movie. The reason no one else has probably written is because they just deal with it in VLC and adjust audio or they don't want to register.
