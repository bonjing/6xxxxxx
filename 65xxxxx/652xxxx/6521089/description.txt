Ital Roots Players were formed by Lee Ellis, Craig Clarke and Pablo Tyler in January 2003, the release of their debut collection of dubs, Ital Promo 2003, followed in March 2003. Before IRP they had spent several years organising dub jams with friends, experimenting with recording techniques, and regularly attending dances by the likes of Jah Shaka, Iration Steppas, Jah Tubbys Sound and the Earthrocker himself: Aba Shanti-I. Sadly, Craig had to leave IRP in 2005 due to family commitments. Their music appears on the soundtrack to the J. Michael Seyfert film RENT a RASTA which was released in October 2006. Described as Lounge Dub, the Ital Roots Players style is distinctive in that it may be enjoyed just as much at home as at a sound system. They produce a blend of acoustic and digital high-energy dub which should be played at MAXIMUM VOLUME!
