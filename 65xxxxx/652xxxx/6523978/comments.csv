,jake_samuals,2011-07-10T22:38Z,"There's no DD 5.1 track. Also, the encoding is XviD, not X264. Xvid shows noise artifacts, at least I can see it. If you follow in HolyRoses' footsteps for format I think you'll get more seeds."
,ftservd,2011-07-12T22:58Z,@jake_samuals Your right there is no DD5.1 track just stereo as stated. Dolby Pro Logic is only stereo. As for codec yes it is x264 I already tested on my AppleTv and works flawless.  AppleTv will not play xvid
