,Nonstopriot3,2011-07-10T02:36Z,"--READ ME--READ ME--READ ME--
To install all patches all you do is click on the first patch(1010) install all of them. To install the crack you copy the files in the crack folder and replace the files in this location --> C:\Program Files (x86)\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto IV

,bannoura1,2011-08-08T01:23Z,"actually i take that back, the loading got better but the game lags lags lags, i just think it's wind 7 64 bit, not suppose to run it on that, and bad coding from the game itself. these updates didnt fix anything for me, thx anyway"
