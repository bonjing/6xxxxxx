,SuperWurm,2011-07-10T21:39Z,how is the movie? For childeren?

,richardpa,2011-07-11T02:58Z,"Proper DVDRip and a fast download... 
A/10 
V/10 
The movie is part of a TV series (probably a 2 part pilot) I belive this is part 1 and there should be a part 2, because at the end of the movie it says ""To Be Continued"" and Iâm sure some of the other torrents say part 1 on there torrent headings... 
Many Thanx to extremezone and LYCAN for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"
,richardpa,2011-07-11T10:29Z,"The second part is here, I forgot that there was 2 AVI files and just played the first one...LOL 
It's probably only a 2 part miniseries with how the second part ends..."
,sysdrone,2011-07-11T10:35Z,"A/v 9/9 

videos in theis torrent are ""a"" and ""b""

""b"" begins with ""previously on...""

it definitely has a television feel

as for question about is it good for children... I would say maybe older ones (teen?) lines like:
""11 year olds aren't sexy"" and a couple scenes of drinking...and some other more mature dialogue might make answering questions for younger kids complicated... 

Thanks for the seeders who at least gave this a 1:1! and as usual thanks extremezone
