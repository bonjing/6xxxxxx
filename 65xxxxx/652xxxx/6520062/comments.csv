,quadsas,2011-07-14T23:53Z,"I love your releases too, DDS Pro Basketball was surprising, I haven't found the crack in a year or so, and bam! Now the only ones that I'd need are Wrestling Spirit and Bowl Bound College Football from Grey Dog Software, but they have elicense support, which is rarely cracked"
,elpa1122,2011-07-16T02:44Z,"I love your releases.  
But could i get any chance of DDS CB 1? CB2 is beta ver, you say so, it doesn't work full system.

Thanks in advance :)"

Can't wait your release! I bought the first College basketball game when it was $5.99, $40 is waaaaay to much for a game like this. :|"
