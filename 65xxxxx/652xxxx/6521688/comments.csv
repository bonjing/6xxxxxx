,frenchmichaels,2011-07-07T09:27Z,thx for this TNE one of few encodes you got right!
[T],trialNerror,2011-07-07T14:46Z,"All uploads for the past few months have been made via the same process.  If this one works for you then there is absolutely no reason the others wouldn't.  Check your system and update your codecs/player or something if you're having problems.  You're like the only one that supposedly does have any.  

Besides, I recall you once saying you weren't ever going to download from me again, yet week after week you seem to get every upload I post.

Good job."
