,falseflag911,2011-07-08T17:24Z,@Agentbay Thanks. I can't edit torrent otherwise I'd add those links. Error message says 'EDIT - Temporarily disabled !' -- don't know if it's because I'm new here or what? 
,abids,2011-07-08T17:28Z,subtitles???
,falseflag911,2011-07-08T17:31Z,No subs on the original so no subs here! Don't know if they exist anywhere.
,falseflag911,2011-07-08T19:31Z,"Thanks again, Agentbay. Glad to know I'm doing it right, especially since I just figured out how to get it to actually start uploading (was pointing to the wrong dir for the actual file). The original footage was shot with an 8mm camera in 1929, so I opted to do a 2GB iso (for this mere 37min long film) instead of avi to keep the quality full on. It's an amazing film."
