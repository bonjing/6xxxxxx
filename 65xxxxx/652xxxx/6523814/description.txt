"Robert Parker always knew he was a killer-he just needed to let it out. Stuck in traffic behind a driver who won't even attempt the speed limit he realizes the time has come. In the grizzly act of that first murder Robert is born anew. An artist of death and slaughter, he begins to ply his trade in earnest growing bolder with each new victim.

Warned by an enigmatic stranger that he's left too much of a trail, Robert begins a cross country flight from justice, leaving a slew of bodies in his wake. Along the way he encounters a host of deviants, killers, and criminals, all of whom seem to steer him towards the one man who holds the key to Robert's next evolution."
