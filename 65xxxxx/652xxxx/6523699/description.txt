Organ Music Not Vibraphone Like I'd Hoped is the first full-length album from Moonface, the solo project of Spencer Krug (frontman of Sunset Rubdown and co-frontman of Wolf Parade). Though the album runs only around 37 minutes, Krug described the album as "dense, but in a satisfying way, I hope, like eating a small, heavy piece of cheesecake." Also included in this torrent are Dreamland EP: Marimba and Shit-Drums, a 20-minute track released in early 2010, and "The Way You Wish You Could Live in the Storm," an eight-and-a-half-minute bonus track being given away for free on Moonface's website which does not appear on the album itself. Enjoy and seed!
