[V],_F1_,2011-07-08T14:35Z,":) Nothing. Just try to avoid including TPB logo inside rip, if you at all love to do it: put it for some certain time / make it semi-transparent / reduce the logo size. It really sucks ///"

So you are from Bangladesh ! Welcome mate, as we are brothers. ( kinship )

Reason 1 :---

If you see my last post (ogo badhu sundari), then you observe there is a logo named 'dhoom' in the film. that's one reason for using thePiratebay logo. in my previously posted film they all have logo created by own production houses.if i do not use TPB logo you will see d original scintillating logo. that's why i can not reduce the opacity also.

Reason 2 :---

Preventing for copying my torrent file (dito) to other private trackers. i have no problems with other public trackers. but i can not tolerate any private trackers al all !

Reason 3 :---

Yes, I love to use ThePiratebay logo because i have a centimental weakness for TPB. I want people should visit this site with a large scale.That's why TPB logo is used."
[V],_F1_,2011-07-09T08:38Z,"Mmm, well taken points. Accepted.
I also love TPB as much as you do. I'm not from Bangladesh, but my origin is. I'm from Kolkata.
We are obviously brothers (I'll be proud to be). Thanx for all your ever-good works ///"
