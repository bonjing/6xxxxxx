This collection has the following titles:



Alien

This was a really well-written book, not like most awful movie and TV novelizations these days. I'm guessing it was written before that turned into mass market industry.

Alan Dean Foster is actually a real writer, with real talent, so this book is worth reading even if you've seen the movie- In fact it will tell you a lot more stuff not told, or only briefly mentioned in the movie, and you get to know the other characters better, besides Ripley.
