,marrafinha,2011-07-13T17:32Z,"Can anyone teach me how to install the game step by step ? im portuguese and not very comfortable with english.. ive never downloaded a game before and im kind of lost...
thank you"
,debugman18,2011-07-14T07:16Z,"Okay, firstly you'll need an ISO mounter; Google it and find a tutorial, I'm too lazy to write out all of the steps, becuase its quite a lot of steps. Mount each ISO, starting with the base game. Install all of them, then run all of the patches. Get the crack out of the ISO root and put it in your Sims 3 install directory. And voila."
,MichealRein,2011-07-14T07:19Z,"Can someone please seed this.

I had it downloaded it but I deleted it by accident.

When I restarted the torrent I got A mb/s for a few hours but then it drops to .4 kb/s and it hasn't  improved much at all."
,debugman18,2011-07-14T12:20Z,"I'm the only seeder at the moment, so until more people upload/finish the download, the download speed will be quite small."
,ajbo,2011-07-15T10:57Z,hi
,ajbo,2011-07-15T10:58Z,"The speed is very very slow.

Is there any other way where you can give it a boost?
it is 40GB 
BTW, do you have the latest patch included in it too?
I mean do you have a website or something where we can track the patches and stuff?
thanks in advance"
,ajbo,2011-07-15T10:59Z,More Seeders plzzzzz
,debugman18,2011-07-16T02:30Z,"It has the latest patches, yes. If you want to update from that version, (a la Town Life Stuff, out soon) then you will have to grab the updates from the official website or from elsewhere. From this update out, however, there is no need to update expansion; Updating the base game will suffice."
,MichealRein,2011-07-16T05:55Z,"While I had the game, it would always ask me to update, but when I did so, it would crash about half way through and not finish. Did this happen with you?

The game itself worked fine, but the updater didn't.

I think that's the reason why the spellbook was brokeb"
,debugman18,2011-07-16T07:57Z,"Spellbook isn't broken. Its even in another torrent of mine. Also, this version's updates WORK. I do not know what you experienced, perhaps trying to overwrite a crack caused the problem. If you install everything, update, then apply the cracks, you will be golden."
,MichealRein,2011-07-17T20:24Z,"Well, I've just been using the Ultimate Bundle anyway.

If this ever does finish downloading I will seed it though"
,debugman18,2011-07-18T05:05Z,"I wouldn't suggest the ultimate bundle. It uses a different method of installation and makes it difficult to install expansion or perform updates. Nothing against .BONE, but I think he went about compiling everything the wrong way."
,MichealRein,2011-07-20T08:18Z,"Yea, I much preferred the way this installed, so that's why I'm still downloading it.

I just have the bundle on right now because I wanted to play."
,gxj,2011-07-22T03:18Z,My files do not contain a mods folder. Do I make one or what? lol I am a derp noob at this so please help.
,ajbo,2011-07-22T03:19Z,"so I am trying to apply the patches for the base game.

Now I have applied the First Patch first but now I cant apply the second patch TS3_1.22.9.0110xx_update
for some strange reason, it gives me a msg saying:
>SetupNew\setup.cpp (140)
PAPP:
VENDOR:
PGUID:
$
@Windows Vista Service Pack 1 (7601)
IE Version: 9.0.8112.16421

Please help

Also when opening the game to start, it says that my CD key is invalid or something and it logs me off :("
,gxj,2011-07-22T03:19Z,Ignore that previous comment wrong torrent sorry 
,gxj,2011-07-22T03:19Z,Ignore that previous comment. Wrong torrent page.
,ajbo,2011-07-22T03:24Z,"Ok nevermind my earlier problem about the patch, I just had to install it again.

But regarding the crack for the game, I am still facing the serial number issue inside the game, where it says that the key is invalid.

So how do I solve this?
thanks :)"
,debugman18,2011-07-22T04:21Z,Did you prevent Sims 3 from accessing the internet? That's important.
,ajbo,2011-07-22T09:52Z,"How do I prevent it?
is there an option?"
,MichealRein,2011-07-22T17:03Z,"Well, it finally finished downloading, and it still works.

The spellbook is still broken for me though, but the other shop items work."
,debugman18,2011-07-22T22:48Z,"@Rain, did you download my July Store Content? It's in a seperate torrent of mine, and its confirmed working.

@ajbo, Check out Zonealarm Firewall, really great for keeping programs from the internet, and its free."
,MichealRein,2011-07-23T07:08Z,"I used this one, just for convenience because I've had it downloaded for a bit.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6530770/Complete_Sims_3_Store_-_July_2011_(package_and_decrapified_sims3

I'll try yours, though."
,breakoutstar,2011-07-23T20:35Z,someone please help i got it downloaded and updated and it still won't work it keeps saying something about the region and i don't know what to do please
,debugman18,2011-07-23T22:51Z,"@breakout I'd be glad to help, but it would be much easier if you told us what the error actually was. I also suggest installing everything in order of release; Base Game and ending with Generations."
,MichealRein,2011-07-23T23:44Z,"It says I need to have the CD in.

I tried mounting the game again, but it didn't work.
Do I have to remount all of them, or am I doing the wrong thing"
,MichealRein,2011-07-23T23:56Z,"Never mind, I mounted the wrong thing.

It's working now"
,debugman18,2011-07-24T00:14Z,@Rain Did you put the Tslhost.dll and TS3W.exe from the crack folder into the Bin directory of Sims 3?
,ajbo,2011-07-26T03:43Z,"Hey, do you have the latest patch?
with its crack?
a patch just got released so was wondering :)

thanks"
,ajbo,2011-07-26T03:47Z,"BTW, the game reads only the Sims 3 Store Update 25 - June 2011.package And the July ones.

all the others are no mentioned when the game starts.
Is this normal or is it supposed to read all of them?"
,debugman18,2011-07-26T07:36Z,I'll get that up in a moment Ajbo.
,debugman18,2011-07-26T08:01Z,"And that is normal, yes. Patch is up. It's 680 mb, its the full patch again, the smaller patchers like to fight with people."
,xjsc16x,2011-07-26T18:56Z,"its downloading REALLLY slow, about 50 kb/s. i dont understand why, seeming there are 20 seeders. please help it says itll take a week D:"
,xjsc16x,2011-07-26T19:49Z,"nevermind, i got it :D i came back a few minutes later and it was at 700 kb/s with 20 hours to go"
,ajbo,2011-07-27T12:22Z,"Thanks :D
Patch works great :)

BTW, I was checking the sims signs in the sims browser and there appears to be a nice sign.
I went to youtube and searched and it is a new expansion :D

its called Town Life Stuff
so I will be waiting for you if possible to upload this one too :) :)

thanks again :D"

,satuurday,2011-08-17T09:52Z,what is the name of the file that I should mount first? please help. :(
,satuurday,2011-08-17T13:35Z,"Nevermind. :)

This time, how do I crack the game?
I've installed all expansions and the base game. Finished the patches. But every time I hit play, it say s that I have to put the disk in. I mounted the Sims 3 base game but it still won't work. what's wrong?"
,debugman18,2011-08-17T23:08Z,Crack files are in the ISO. Drag them (Tslhost.dll and TS3W.exe) from the crack folder into the Bin directory of Sims 3.
,bona_drag,2011-08-18T14:50Z,im having the same problems. please help!
,jakey616,2011-08-21T08:45Z,can somebody who has successfully installed this please list the steps you did this in. Also do you have to install all the expansions or can i just install the base game and when i finish downloading each expansion install them at different points without stuffing something up
,debugman18,2011-08-26T00:05Z,You can install them one at a time if you wish.
,Wuppertaler79,2011-09-06T11:33Z,"Hi there, at first thanks for up! :)
Only one question, is there also german language?"
,ingridblaru,2011-10-04T22:42Z,I'm sorry to bother you but after trying a million times to mount fast lane every single time tells me I cant because of the version. I download already from 2 different people this game and happens the same with both'. Must be an order in the installation of the updates or the extensions that will make it work but don't know how. Could you help me please 
,ingridblaru,2011-10-05T12:03Z,"Im sure Im doing something wrong but what no idea!!!. I instal everyth all the updates (doesnt let me instal fast lane for some reason related to the game version). Might be a dumb question but once I instal everyth I just need to take the crack from generations, as is the last extension, and paste in the sims 3 base game bin instead of the exe file (together w the dll of the crack). I dont need to copy every crack of each extension in every extension no? I dont know why doesnt work but I tried 6 time at least. can anyone help me"
