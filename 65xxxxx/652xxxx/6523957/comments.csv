Over 21 seeders!!"
,alshoura,2011-07-17T22:16Z,"Just for the sake of clarification, this seems to have both NOD32 AV and ESS, both 32 and 64 bit. I almost skipped it because it's not indicated that it has ESET Smart Security in the title. Thanks to the uploader."
[T],djjlicious,2011-07-26T12:12Z,"@ Alshoura. This is the title:
ESET Nod 32 For Life 32 & 64 bit AV & SS
Just read hahaha"
,Mklangelo,2011-07-31T21:14Z,"I have yet to see one of these NOD 32 torrents be worth a crap.  But we shall see.  I'm running Vista Home Premium SP 2.

I will post when I give it a try.  "
,Mklangelo,2011-07-31T21:23Z,Yep.  As usual it's not working.  What about the detail of a username and password?  Nothing in there about that.  
,dopsleutel13,2011-07-31T23:30Z,"Antivirus 64bits versie is werkend!
 Iss niet gelukt ."
[T],djjlicious,2011-08-01T06:58Z,"Skip username, don't use that.
1. Run Eset purefix.
2. Install eset
After install reboot, that's it!
Works on all versions"
,Raz0rLink,2011-08-02T17:40Z,"It seems to let me manually update and stats the latest update. But when ever I click on the update signature database, it sends me to, http://www.eset.eu/podpora/aktualizacia-5630?lng=en  I this normal?"
[T],djjlicious,2011-08-03T17:09Z,"@razOrlink
No, it must update manuely.
I gues u have to install again."
,Raz0rLink,2011-08-03T18:06Z,"@ djjlicous, I think it's like that. My eset says the latest version of virus signature database but when I click it, it just sends me to an older link. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and it still does the same. Maybe its a glitch?"
[T],djjlicious,2011-08-03T18:49Z,"I have really no idea, it's working here for over 2 months and still works.
Smart security on windows 7 ultimate."
,robsario,2011-08-08T01:19Z,"@djjlicious
the only way to update this version is manually? if I click on update signature database won't work?
thanks in advance!"
,3Brothers,2011-08-08T18:05Z,AS OF 8/9/11 it is working guyz im Using Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit..i will comment if this patch is not working anyomore..=)
,Drwow,2011-08-10T06:46Z,"@djjlicious
Is it supposed to be a trial version?  I ran Purefix then installed the Antivirus, rebooted and ran a successful manual update.

Virus database is current as far the Eset is concerned, but it states:

Remaining Trial Period 30 days.  Purchase/Upgrade to Full Version.

Is there anymore to the installation to make it Full...or is this merely a Trial version you've uploaded?"
,Drwow,2011-08-10T07:40Z,"@djjlicious
Update to previous comment...Nod did an auto update a little later and changed from Trial to Full.  It is telling me my license expires in November of this year.  Will I need to reinstall then, or will the license be auto updated?"
,3Brothers,2011-08-10T11:10Z,"AS OF 8/10/11 it is working guyz im Using Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit.
BOTH EAV & ESS ARE BOTH stable...
"
,Drwow,2011-08-11T07:48Z,No longer works.  Refuses to do both auto and manual updates with the error : Invalid Username and Password.  Will not update the virus signature database to its current value.
[T],djjlicious,2011-08-11T11:59Z,"I don't know what you all do, run purefix, install eset, after install reboot.
That's it!"
,3Brothers,2011-08-11T13:16Z,"@djjlicious
thats right this is awesome realease ty by the way..sometimes people must have common sense...
this is a crack..for unlimited trial then someone will ask why it says 30 days left funny right?"
,Drwow,2011-08-11T22:28Z,An antivirus is only as good as its latest update...and if it doesn't update...its no good.
[T],djjlicious,2011-08-12T01:51Z,"@drow
Then you did something wrong!
It works here for over 2 months, and still works!"
,robsario,2011-08-14T10:30Z,"again:

,Pulse555,2011-08-20T13:49Z,"working ok, just installed purefix.exe in safe-mode, clicked enable, closed it then restarted my pc, eset said my license had expired like 476 days ago, then i updated virus database without problems, the only thing u have in your eset gui is a red section saying license expired but it updates no probs , im using 5.0.84.0 build btw, cheers :D"
,plus__one,2011-09-13T21:10Z,"you legend, how the hell people come up with cracks and things like that is beyond me...

,sachib,2011-09-17T10:30Z,"Works perfect!! Update works after reboot ! THANKS!!



Dziala zajbiscie, polecam goraco!! :)"
,totcambiu,2011-09-23T01:58Z,"Ok guys this shit is working 100%. I had problem installing it as well. 
If it does not work try this. 
1) Install NOD 32 (any will do, even from other download)
2) Restart to Safe Mode (press F8 after reboot)
3) (In safe mode) Right click on ESET PureFix ""run as administrator"" and click ""Enable""
4) Restart again.

If you did everything right you should have no expire date in NOD 32."
[T],djjlicious,2011-09-23T16:22Z,"Shure does it work, but the most people don't read!!
But thanks for the nice comments, and helpful comments!"

,EK117,2011-10-17T05:02Z,"Works great on Win 7 x84! Purefix.exe is a bit glitchy through. I run it as admin, then install Nod32. Purefix doesn't detect that the install is complete so I have to close it. Then restart in Safe Mode and run the Purefix.exe. After I choose the ""existing Installation"" option, I let it do it's thing then close and restart. Works like a charm. Thanks djjlicious!!!!"
,brijeshsingh007,2011-10-20T15:05Z,"it worked on my Win 7

,xXxbuster,2011-10-24T16:26Z,not working for windows server 2008 r2.
,namshub,2011-11-12T17:51Z,"Install this program EXACTLY as @totcambiu has written above and you should be fine. 

Note: RUN PUREFIX IN SAFE MODE. Also, make sure you don't already have an antivirus or any other security running.

Thanks to @djjlicious for the first ESET torrent I've downloaded that actually works! Well done.

Also, thanks to @totcambiu for the excellent install instructions.

[Running on Win 7 Ultimate 64-bit]"

,vincepass,2012-02-11T06:28Z,OK after 7 retries I finally got it LOL...I have only one question;I WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE NO EXPIRATION DATE ON ON THE NOD 32 SO I KEPT MOVING TO THE SCAN. NOW YOU SAID THE UPDATES HAVE TO BE DONE MANUALLY; HOW DO WE DO THAT AND WHERE DO WE GO TO UPDATE THE SIGNATURES? OR DOES THE SOFTWARE DO IT ON ITS OWN EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T CLICK THE UPDATE ICON? OTHER THAN THAT I AM GOO THANK YOUUUUUU
,Manni15,2012-02-18T16:24Z,"Wow, the first version after so many that I downloaded that actually works! And the procedure is so simple! Thanks for all the useful comments as well!"
,KOBKED-X,2012-03-31T21:23Z,"Thanks, NOD32 has yet to let me down, but I have a new comp running win7 X64 bit and my old nod won't werk.. So Thanks!"

,Hidframe,2012-04-10T16:17Z,"Very satisfied with it. Thanks for the upload.
A quick tip to you all. After you're done using the ""PureFix"" patch in safe mode, add it to an archive before restarting. The antivirus detects it as a threat and it automatically quarantines it. By adding it to an archive you keep it from doing that, and you can use the patch again some other time if needed."
,mfk1bee,2012-05-28T01:26Z,i especially made an account just to say this works like a charm! legit download! thumbs up! jst follow the instructions in the read me file!
,mhnasg,2012-06-07T17:34Z,ok..LOL...my already installed nod 32 antivirus..keeps blocking and puts in quarantee the purefix.exe file...lol..and i thought i didnt download it correctly...what can i do now? ;/x
