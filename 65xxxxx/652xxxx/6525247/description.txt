Description:

Past cricket games have suffered from being lopsided, with either batting or bowling â€“ but not both â€“ being enjoyable. Ashes 2009 satisfactorily addresses that fundamental flaw, although it is a good idea to work through the tutorials for its control systems before you take on the baggy green cap-wearers (naturally, you can play as Australia, too). When bowling, you can switch between three broad types of delivery â€“ swing, cutters or reverse swing (unavailable until the ball is old), then pick swing direction or slower ball by hitting the appropriate button. This launches a timing meter, requiring you to press that button again. It sounds fiddly, but works nicely, and the same principles apply when you control a spinner.
