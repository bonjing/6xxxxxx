[V],NLUPPER002,2011-07-07T22:38Z,"Thanks lsd67 finally somebody that says  my encoding for Game Of Thrones is good.

Cost a long time for every episode, some ours to encode that. (At least 6 ours every epi)

So i keep that setting for other conversions from I to P.

BTW real good serie"

Video quality: 6
Audio: 9

Personally, I couldn't stand the choppiness and ended up downloading a 720p version."
