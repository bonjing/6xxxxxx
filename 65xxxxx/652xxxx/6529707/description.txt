Couple of days ago I got an e-mail from someone who was asking if I was ever going to get some obscure MOD, power pop and punk stuff posted as well. I said to myself that sounded like a great idea,  and indeed I have some cool tracks to share and in the meantime it's something relatively new (musically speaking). So this is part one, there would be more coming if you guys are interested.

Track Listing:

01 The Click - Just Another Monday
02 Linda and the Dark - Where Have All The Good Times Gone
03 Volcano - It's Not the Time
04 Glass Torpedoes - Call It Music
05 The Cruize - Strange Little Girl
06 The Signals - Person to Person
07 Mal Cochran - The Girls In Room 429
