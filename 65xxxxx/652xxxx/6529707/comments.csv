I am looking forward to the next iteration. Thanks!"

[V],80zforever,2011-07-18T00:59Z,"nonsentence, I am glad someone liked this at least. was getting disappointed that thought noone likes MOD and punk stuff on tpb. See You In Vegas song comes off their 7'' ""The Day The World Caught Fire"", other songs are ok but nothing special. "

,Mesohappy,2011-10-23T18:57Z,THX for your love of keeping sounds alive. These will last for years. I played in the late 80`s a modern rock band. Did not go to far but it was fun.
