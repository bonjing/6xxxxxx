,Cerebral222,2011-07-08T02:29Z,"The in-game videos are pretty low quality, but the game play is ok, I mapped the keys with xpadder to play with my game pad. You can download the RAD Tools program to play & convert the .bik files to AVI in order to checkout the cut scenes. All in all, I thought it was a good upload, Thanx Subzero, nice bug free torrent."
