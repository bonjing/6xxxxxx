PLOT: Point Break is a 1991 action film directed by Kathryn Bigelow and starring Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze, and Gary Busey. The title refers to the surfing term "point break". The film was a box office success upon its release and it has since gathered a cult following. Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves), is a rookie FBI agent and former Ohio State quarterback who, with his partner, Angelo Pappas (Gary Busey), are investigating a string of bank robberies by a gang known as the Ex-Presidents. They are called this because they use masks of former Presidents Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, and Lyndon B. Johnson to disguise their true identities.
