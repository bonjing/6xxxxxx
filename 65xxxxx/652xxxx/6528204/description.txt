The film is based on a popular radio series in Estonia.

The eccentric residents of a small Estonian village are characters in a live radio soap opera voiced by two dorky actors (Henrik Normann and Madis Milling) in this 2003 comedy. As the actors read their lines, director Rando Pettai intercuts staged scenes, with the leads playing their characters (some in drag). Something must have been lost in translation, because the wackiness is severely strained, and the farce, which for the most part consists of absurd plot developments precipitated by studio mishaps, falls flat.
