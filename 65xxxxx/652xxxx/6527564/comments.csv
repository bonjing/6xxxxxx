,darkshanker,2011-07-12T19:31Z,"@Dimarko

Because it sucked ass and noone cared about it."
,amputate,2011-08-04T20:33Z,"This is the beta.
Confirmed it myself.
The game will come out the 23th of August so the earliest anyone could possibly bring out a full scene release is about 1 week before that..."
,MARYNBOSS,2011-08-10T09:01Z,FAKE FAKE FAKE
,godziothc,2011-08-23T16:22Z,"Doesn't have to be fake just because release date is in some time...Remember Sims 3, out in the bay 3 weeks before launch? Just be sure to check scene release lists.

Oh and if it still matters, yeah, it's the beta"
