From Big Bad Zero's Myspace page:



 BBZ, a Las Vegas based quartet, was founded in 1996 by vocalist/guitarist Nick Mattera, guitarist Dave Meeks, bassist Dan Gauthier, and drummer Rob Whited. From the downbeat, they knew exactly what they wanted to achieve with this project. Their goals were to create great music, develop a unique image, forge credible industry contacts, and build a loyal nationwide fan base. They were well aware that the combination of these elements would help lead them to undeniable success in the music industry. This work ethic and commitment has since opened many doors for the band. BBZ has been invited to perform at many radio sponsored festivals and shows for stations
