,sprongle,2012-04-01T17:37Z,"These videos are well made and slick. The underlying facts contained fall into the ""if just one of these is true, it's worrying!"" category. Unfortunately, the author is a Christian, and although that isn't a bad thing, it colours his attitude to what he reveals. It would have been much better to have left the religious aspect out, even though he believes it, and let the viewer use their own intelligence to interpret what is going on, with him suggesting reasons rather than just stating that it is all down to Satanism in the Establishment and Media"

The content in these films are all ""dots"" to be connected to the others being revealed by similar researchers. "
