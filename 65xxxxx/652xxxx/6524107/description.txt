American stage and screen legend Elaine Stritch stars as Dorothy McNab, a brash writer living in London who hires suave, selfassured Robert (Donald Sinden), the perfect British butler, and then struggles to retain the upper hand. Cultures clash and sparks fly as she pits her blunt antiBritish, profeminist views against his oldschool attitudes and witheringly polite putdowns. It is the American Revolution and the battle of the sexes all rolled into one rollicking comedy. Guest stars include Penelope Keith, Tony Selby, and Joyce Carey.
