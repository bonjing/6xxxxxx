                    PLOT                    
     Phoenix officeworker Marion Crane is fed up      
           with the way life has treated her. She has            
           to meet her lover Sam in lunch breaks and             
           they cannot get married because Sam has to            
           give most of his money away in alimony. One           
           Friday Marion is trusted to bank $40,000 by           
           her employer. Seeing the opportunity to take          
           the money and start a new life, Marion                
           leaves town and heads towards Sam's                   
           California store. Tired after the long drive          
           and caught in a storm, she gets off the main          
           highway and pulls into The Bates Motel. The           
           motel is managed by a quiet young man called          
           Norman who seems to be dominated by his               
           mother.
