Enigma are the brainchild of Michael Cretu (b. 18 May 1957 as Mihai CreÅ£u, Bucharest, Romania).
Acheived commercial success after popularising a brand of chill-out music utilising
Gregorian chants and dance music rhythms.








Album Review (c/o AllMusic)

Cretu being no fool, he figured if it worked the first time, no need to change things
much for the second. But he also knew not to simply go ahead and just rehash his debut for
Cross of Changes, resulting in a just different enough effort along the same overall lines.
The usual air of tasteful middle-of-the-road spirituality takes precedence, right down to the cover art
and appropriately pantheistic quote from Persian mystic poet Rumi in the CD booklet. Needless to say,
the music attempts to match the same throughout, and often succeeds. Things kick off with more of
the synth-whale song noises and atmospherics from MCMXC, however there aren't any monks to be
found this time around, but what sounds like the same whispering woman talking about
"clearing the debts of many hundred years" and the like. From there, Cretu merrily takes the same
plunge -- some of his sample choices this time around show he's got a decent record collection,
including parts from Songs From the Victorious City, the striking fusion of Egyptian and Western
musics from Anne Dudley and Jaz Coleman.

His work with beats and loops noticeably shows a more developed edge -- while hardly an innovator,
there's a bit more grime and loud in his rhythms, which in combination with extra electric guitar make
a reasonable contrast to the smoother elements. Consider the rampaging conclusion to
"I Love You...I'll Kill You," which while sharing some cheese with the title itself still works surprisingly well,
right down to a clever Robert Plant vocal sample at the end. "Return to Innocence" was the big single
from this one, not quite up there with "Sadeness" in the popular culture in the U.S. but almost inescapable
elsewhere. There's another Led Zeppelin sample (this time John Bonham) and a haunting male vocal
providing oomph under the fuzzy-headed greeting card philosophy of the main lyrics. It's an impressive
effort, showing Cretu had a definite something in his own way.
