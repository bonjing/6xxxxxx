Storyline:


From the Farrelly Brothers (There's Something About Mary, Dumb & Dumber) comes your ticket to fool around! Rick (Owen Wilson) and Fred (Jason Sudeikis) are best friends, each married many years. With the guys showing signs of restlessness at home, their wives (Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate) take a bold approach to revitalizing their respective marriages: granting them a "hall pass," one week of freedom to do whatever they want . . . no questions asked. At first a dream come true, it's not long before Rick and Fred find that their expectations of the single life - and themselves - are completely and hilariously out of sync with reality.
