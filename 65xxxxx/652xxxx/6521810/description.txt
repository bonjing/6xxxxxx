

The story begins with Krishna (ajay) who is a nice guy and responsible as well. His life takes a turn when he sees Geetha (radhika) and falls in love with her. However, Geetha is clear with what she wants since she is a middle class girl with a lot of commitments. Krishna supports her at every instant and eventually, they agree to get married. However, the pressures of life compel Geetha to look for material wealth and in this process, she accepts the proposal from the wealthy Narendra (pradeep). But then, life has something else in store for her. What happens from there forms the rest of the story.
