,anon_X22,2011-07-08T09:22Z,"Thanks for the upload! I have not listened through the entire album, but I love it so far. From what I have heard it is easy to tell that this album is different from Sublime with Bradley, but that does not mean it is bad. Obviously, it does sound like Sublime, but just a different Sublime; it is hard for me to explain at 3:00am haha. Anyways, I'm going to buy this album when it comes out on the 12th to support the comeback, and I hope that other fans will do likewise. Also, if you liked this album, be sure to check out ""The Dirty Heads"". Trust me when I say there is a good chance you will love them."

Sublime died with Brad :(

Fuck this Sublime with Rome garbage. Any true fan would agree."
