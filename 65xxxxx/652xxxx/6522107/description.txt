Itâ€™s time for the Hill Vally Expo! Back in 1986, Marty and First Citizen Brown must join forces to create an epic invention so that he can prevent the young Emmett Brown from making the worst mistake of his life. Martyâ€™s gotten into a sticky situation as heâ€™s dealing with the consequences of his and Docâ€™s actions back in 1930â€²s Hill Valley, so itâ€™s going to take some crafty thinking for him to get out of this mess and back in time to fix the altered timeline.
