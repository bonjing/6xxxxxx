,mutekiazy,2011-07-18T11:53Z,"I saw this at the Bram Stoker film festival in Whitby earlier this year. It's not a film to be taken seriously, but it's meant to be a bit of a parody. If you enjoy those ""so bad they're good"" films then you might like this. 
Personally, I found it pretty funny and entertaining, but nothing amazing. There are a couple of scenes during the big battle near the end that made me laugh out loud though!

But yeah: Poor special effects, poor acting, ridiculous, childish script, nonsensical plot developments... but good fun if you enjoy that kinda thing."
