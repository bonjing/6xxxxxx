this time this is the mooded driver from very newest catalyst 11.6b
for full mobility support
this driver is not official and is for internal testing purposes only !
as usual comes from our friend asder00 from guru3d
Many thanks to him for his very job.
asder00 call them as 11.7b hotfix cause this driver version is exactly the same
than my previous torrent talking about catalyst 11.7 early preview designed by a mysterious code name...
This is the same but revised version from anyway
