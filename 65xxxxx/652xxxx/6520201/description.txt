Maximum performance for your computer

Fragmentation can cause your computer to slow down drastically. When saving data, the operating system scatters fragments all over the hard disk and this slows down the time needed for accessing files. To make sure you have the fastest access times possible, keep the data on your disks arranged in perfect order. O&O Defrag lets you merge the individual fragments so that files are then positioned consecutively on the hard disk. To accomplish this, O&O Defrag gives you three new methods of defragmentation that combine perfectly with all its standard options. Altogether, they allow you to customize the way files are organized on your computer.Your system will start faster, running programs will be speeded up, and new fragmentation can be avoided!

Fully automatic defragmentation at your fingertips! The full set of professional options makes O&O Defrag everything a superior system tool should be!
