[b]Thx Hive


CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D

Sources:
Video: Russian DVD-9 
Ljudi.Iks.Pervyj.klass.2011.D.DVD.ELEKTRI4KA
Audio: Imagines Line Thx


Video Encode:

firstly this was a 8h workjob!
It maybe not the first version, but i am sure its the best possible version.

Russian DVD was ok, not the greatest not the sharpest but good. Still needed a lot of work.
The DVD was dark,unsharp and colours not that great.
Added brightness,contrast,chroma,fixed rgb colours,sharpness,denoise.
Made a really nice and more than competitive version.

A lot of Subs were needed too for the french,german and russian parts.
I used the russian full subs for the timeline that everything appears where it should be.
and removed all eng spoken parts and just kept all foreign.
I translated all german parts myself, i used most of the french parts of imagine and replaced them inside the russian sub file.
The subs for the russian parts was the most work, since the russian dont do subs for there own language so i had to insert them manually and hardcoded them within my nice video

Audio Encode:

cleaned the line from hiss and noise.
Used the russian dts track for the sourround channels and cleaned the rears from all the russian voice that was present.
Synchronized the line and entered it back into the russian 5.1 track.

All in all a perfect release like it should be. 
I included 2 samples that you can see how a quality releases looks like
enjoy

Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering 
their powers for the first time. Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, 
with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, 
a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-MEN.
