SUMMARY:

Hannibal is a 2001 psychological thriller directed by Ridley Scott, adapted from the Thomas Harris novel of the same name. It is a sequel to the 1991 Academy Award-winning film The Silence of the Lambs that returns Anthony Hopkins to his iconic role as serial killer Hannibal Lecter. Julianne Moore co-stars, taking over for Jodie Foster in the role of FBI Agent Clarice Starling.

Set ten years after The Silence of the Lambs, the premise is that Lecter's only surviving victim, Mason Verger (portrayed by Gary Oldman), is determined to capture, torture, and kill him. The film's locations alternate between Italy and the U.S.

Hannibal was a highly anticipated sequel. It marked the third film appearance of Lecter.

The "bumpy" development of Hannibal drew a large amount of attention, with Silence of the Lambs director Jonathan Demme, screenwriter Ted Tally and actress Jodie Foster all eventually declining involvement.[1] Upon release, Hannibal broke box-office records in the United States, Australia, Canada and the UK in February 2001.[2]
