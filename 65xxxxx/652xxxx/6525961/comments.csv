One has to wonder what the point of inaccurate quality ratings is supposed to be... Truly pathetic if that represents their best effort at thwarting file sharing.

Guess it's a stop-gap measure until the money men rewrite international law in order to destroy the net at the little conventions they've been holding. Amazing that humanity still tolerates/encourages this sort of authoritarianism. Sad lot, we are.
