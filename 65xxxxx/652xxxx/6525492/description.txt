Hailey Young is the kind of girl who panics when she realizes she has no control over her situation. The knowledge that she is helpless comes with a growing anxiety until it is all she can do to hold herself together. That is during the best of times. This is anything but. With PD so eagerly preying upon her fears Hailey is screaming at the top of her lungs. As the torments begin to escalate she has no refuge. It makes it impossible to keep her cool.
