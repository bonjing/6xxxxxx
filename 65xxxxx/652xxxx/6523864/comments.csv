I'm a highly emotional person. I always have sentimental weakness for ThePiratebay. I have
been searching this site since November 2006. I only upload my movies in TPB. I will never upload anything to any private / public tracker. I believe in ' Freedom '. And TPB is the only one site provides enormous freedom in the net world. Can you suggest any site which is so simple & give so much freedom ? answer is "" NO "". In other sites there are lots of rules & regulation. ' no abusive words ', ' no personal attack ', ' sharing ratio ', ' spamming ', ' no contest / dispute ', ' registration / pay $$$ then get full access '. What all these ??? These barriers only create pressure to end viewers. I do not like them at all ! And your above mentioned site is on a growing phase only. ThePiratebay is always within 100 net site according to ALEXA rating. They still manage to hide their servers from others. Is it not enough to claim their supremacy ? I'm new at uploading business. Just one month old. so after some days i'll be noticed to others. And others will be bound to visit ThePiratebay. I have lots of collection my friend. By comparing my full collection only .01 % i collected by downloading. Only one problem is that my connection speed. But that will be changed in near future. So, people who are interested in Bengali / Classic films & also uncut / controversial / unrated films and excellent porns they are bound to visit ThePiratebay. It's my wish. And i'm servant
of my feelings !!"
