It is very easy. Download this http://www.girlshare.ro/2476349.7  and install it normaly (avoid the toolbars). Open it, press video select the video you want. Then choose the format you prefer (http://shareimage.ro/images/28udrrms4e3qiwglcm.jpg ). And that's all.
It may have much size then the actual format"

,archerXIV,2011-11-23T20:08Z,"@Uploader: Gabe, I was wondering if you could help me? I have problems with MKV as well, so I tried using your steps you posted in the comments to convert to mp4 and... when I download from girlshare.ro, the program won't install. Nothing opens when I double click the icon (or even when I right click to select ""Open""). Do you know why this is? Do you have any suggestions? Thanks :/ "
[T],-Gabe-,2011-12-14T20:44Z,"@archer

Why you didn't download it from google? just type ""Totally Free Converter download"" Its free, no need to download from my girlshare link. Sorry for delay."

People, MKV, MP4, it doesn't matter!  It's just the container that the file is in, little more than a difference in extension, and absolutely nothing to do with the content inside of it.  If you have a program or device that doesn't work with MKV files, simply use YAMB (Google it) to export it to an MP4 file.  Takes 5 to 10 minutes for a typical 2 to 4GB 720P movie.  About twice as fast if you want to change an MP4 to an MKV file, in which case you use a program called MKV Merge.
