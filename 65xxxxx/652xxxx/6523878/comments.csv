Arguably the most consequential book every written - creating Gandhi, and maybe MLK.  

Buy the book, but be CERTAIN it is the Hapgood translation.  It's still in print - blue cover.  You'll find it on Amazon if you dig."
,UnviolentPeacemaker,2011-07-08T02:36Z,"BTW - like me, and Gandhi, Tolstoy had ZERO interest in whether Jesus was a God, Deity, worked miracles.... HE CARED WHAT JESUS TAUGHT ABOUT HOW TO LIVE, AS A FULL HUMAN, IN JOY, ESCAPING THE HELL OF MEANINGLESS, INTOXICATING, DEATHLY PLEASURE.  Tolstoy found what he was looking for, as did King, Gandhi, me.... You?  Or are you going to stay burried in The Matrix?"
