Gospel in Brief - Leo Tolstoy - Made a young lawyer into Gandhi - (HAPGOOD translation!)

After writing all his novels the original Greek texts of the Gospels is where Tolstoy turned as his last remaining hope to avoid Suicide.  It worked.  He spent the next 40 years applying, living, and writing what he learned there.  

The Gospel in Brief is what he found in those original Greek Texts.  The young law student in London read one of the off-shoot works - The Kingdom of God is Within You - it became his Bible, he took that Bible to South Africa, named his first Ashram there the Tolstoy Farm, considered Tolstoy the greatest Living example of his day of being Fully Human, considered Jesus the greatest Human Being of all time, and Gandhi is the name of that young Hindu law student.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. MLK may well have been Created by his reading at Crozier Seminary another off-shoot work of Tolstoys, The Law of Love and the Law of Hate.
