At least comment on picture quality."
,ghandi253,2011-07-19T04:00Z,"I with you, funky_ace. It seems like hardly anyone wants to comment anymore. Im like you. I want to know what the hell Im downloading before I download it."
,Shantanab,2011-07-22T22:32Z,It would be better if the uploader himself posted some screenshots/included a sample : we could have judged for ourselves
,kepler42,2011-07-31T19:59Z,"This kung fu panda 2 is a FAKE;
Its just a FullOfShit File that neither MediaInfo nor VLC understand.
STAY AWAY From MrJumper, he is a jerk!"
,MrFlamboyant,2011-07-31T22:34Z,downloaded both files.... they dont work using VLC. if it were a real .avi file it would play.... thanks for nothing asshole!
,MrJumper,2011-08-02T12:40Z,"My appologies, I put the wrong Kung Fu Panda 2 in the torrent, 1 works fine but 2 does not, and it won't let me delete the torrent for some reason."
,Harrr_mayte,2011-08-24T20:29Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!!! Both files won't work.
I have all necessary codecs AND VLC btw.

I surely hope your other uploads aro of better quality, MrJumper..."
