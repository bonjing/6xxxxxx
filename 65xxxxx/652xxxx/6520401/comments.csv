,dackral,2011-07-06T20:09Z,"I probably don't say it enough, but I take advantage of these uploads religiously, because my current cable package doesn't contain Fox Business.  Thank you so much for doing this!"

I've downloaded almost every one for months now.  I also seed like a maniac now that I've got a really good internet service.  Is ReplayTV really going to stop?  I don't have cable because I despise it, I NEED THIS!

Thanks for everything!!!!"

Alternative sources for guide data are being explored by the owner community, but there are some doubts as to the ultimate usability of the units after this date. IF it becomes impossible to schedule unattended recordings with my unit, then the flow of torrents describing this show and others will stop after this date."
