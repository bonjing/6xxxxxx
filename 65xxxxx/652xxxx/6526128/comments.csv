and if not please tell me the settings I would download 1080p version and convert it myself (I`m afraid how much time would it take?)"

I won't. sorry.
If you have  4 GB RAM with 1.6-2.0 GHz pc it will take you about 3-4 days for each episode with the highest encoding settings   ( me=tesa ) 
http://ind01.bilderkiste.org/3130838118115/LOTR_%5Bmkvonly%5D_encode_settings.png
with Quality Avg Bitrate ~ 2700 KB/s.

So it would take you about 21 days ;-)
Or if you use Motion Estimation Method Uneven Multi-Hexagon (me=umh) would take you half the time but with some little quality loss.
Good luck."
