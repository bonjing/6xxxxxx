,phoenixrises,2011-07-07T11:32Z,"Alternatively, you can manage content on your Kindle by using a brilliant bit of software called Calibre. It is legal software and it is free to download and use too! As well as managing content it also converts any format eBook to the format of your reader, so you can download ePub and convert it to Mobi. It does loads of other stuff too, I read about it on here so I am passing on the tip. Can't recommend it highly enough.  "
