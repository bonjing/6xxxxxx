Venghai (Tamil: à®µà¯‡à®™à¯à®•à¯ˆ; English: Leopard) is a 2011 Tamil action-masala film directed by Hari, starring Dhanush and Tamannaah Bhatia in the lead roles.[1] The story is based in Sivagangai district. The film started its shooting in November 2010 at Trichy,[2] and released on 7 July 2011[3] to mixed reviews.

Vengai is typical movie of Hariâ€™s stamp. It is just the tale of father and son affection and in between comes some action and love which forms Vengai.

Selvam (Dhanush) is the son of Veerapandi (Raj Kiran) who is an influential person in a village in Sivaganga district and does all good for the welfare of the village. Prakash Raj fondly called as Annachi becomes MLA for this region and Veerapandi takes an oath from Annachi to do only good things for the people in the village. However, Annachi brings out his evil image and does all illegal activities to make money and exercise his power. But Veerapandi, who gets angry with his activities, tries to stop them. Selvam who comes to know about his activities takes things in his hands but his father sends him to Trichy.

Selvam comes across Radhika (Tamannah) who is his childhood friend. Both of them within no time fall in love for each other. As Veerapandi is always standing as a problem for his activities Annachi decides to settle Veerapandi scores. From here the Tom and Jerry show starts between them. How Annachi takes revenge on Veerapandi? Will the love life of Selvam and Radhika turn successful? How will Dhanush settle the scores with Annachi? Checkout for the answers â€¦â€¦.[/COLOR][/B][/QUOTE]
