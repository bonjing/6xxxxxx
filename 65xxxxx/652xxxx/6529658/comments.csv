Anyone seen wurlitzer for hauptwerk?"

@ Mark64nl: I'm seeding now @ 100kb/s. 

Note that you can find a 3 manual modification for the Velesovo organ here:
http://morse.home.comcast.net/~morse/content_hacking.html

I adjusted this modified version to enable you to use it with this sample set. If you want it, just ask.

Do any of you have other great Wet/Surround Hauptwerk sample sets you can share, like for example Caen, Zwolle or Notre Dame Metz?"
,Mark86nl,2012-04-16T00:23Z,"Hello GJart, thanks for seeding. Downloading goes much faster now...
I just downloaded Hauptwerk two days ago, still trying to find out how everything works.
What axactly is the difference between this version of de Velesovo's sampleset and the 3 manual modification?
I'm new to this so forgive me for any stupid questions.

To bad there aren't a lot of samplesets available trough torrents or newsservers.
I tried out the Hinsz organ from the Bovenkerk in Kampen, but the trial only allows you to play a small range of ""keynotes"" (don't know the proper word)
And to be honest, paying 1100 euro's for the sampleset is a little bit to much for me."
,GJart,2012-04-16T02:49Z,"Mark, the original Velesovo organ only has two manuals, and therefore the sampleset too. The modified 3m version turns it into a three manual organ. Of course that is only useful if - like in my case - you have an organ with three manuals."
,Mark86nl,2012-04-22T22:12Z,"Thanks GJart, I've got it!
I don't have a 3m organ so it wouldn't help me much.

Off topic:
Stupid question maybe, but on TPB, can you set a email notification or something for new reply's on messages over here?
I assume you don't check every torrent daily to see if anyone has commented on it?"
,GJart,2012-04-24T14:23Z,"Mark, for as far as I can tell, TPB doesn't have any built in support for notifications on new comments. (for torrents you can use the RSS feed)
But however, if you use chrome, you may wanna give 'Page Monitor' a try. It's a simple plugin that allows you to check a list of websites for changes.
