,Dgcz,2011-07-31T09:23Z,"No subtitle - but there are many Hungarian voices during battles, WTF? 

(like ""to the gate!"", ""hurry!"" during a siege. Must be HU actors, as I see filming location was in Wales)"
,Dgcz,2011-07-31T09:46Z,"(yes, all stunts were Hungarian: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1233301/fullcredits#cast  but still funny why their voices remained in the film)"
,Dgcz,2011-07-31T09:52Z,"and this EN subtitle matches fine:
