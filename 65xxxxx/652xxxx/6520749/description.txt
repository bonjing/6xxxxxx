 Locating the South African challenges within a broader international perspective, this study covers all the major economic growth challanges from employment, industrial policy, urban governance, and the informal economy to the social challenges of poverty, inequality, HIV/AIDS, and health policy. The key development debates of the post-apartheid era are outlined and the success of a decade of reform and experimentation is considered by a wide range of international development specialists, including American economists Gil Hart and Michael Carter; British economist Jonathan Michie; and South African Scholars Alan Whitesides, Julian May, and Mike Morris.
