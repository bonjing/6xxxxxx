,Verosumatic,2011-07-15T09:49Z,@dilz669 - Because the black bars that would be on the top and bottom have been cropped out.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6537668/Rio.2011.BluRay.720p.DTS.x264-CHD
It is a bigger filesize (3.3GB) and looks exactly the same. Only benefit to it is it has 6.1 DTS audio, while this one has Stereo."
