""pro-coder""... if you re-encoded this, was it with DVD Rebuilder/CCE?  I found that by default the CCE file size is about 4.32.  In DVD Rebuilder's Help, search ""size"" under 'Hidden Settings"" and the default and max CCETargetSectors is shown.  Max causes re-encodes to often go over 4.379GB, but I've had good experience with a modified rebuilder.ini CETargetSectors=2259000; so far all rebuilds have ended up around 4.376.

If you are using CCE for re-encodes from DVD9 to DVD5, Thank you!  I know it takes longer than one-click, but IMO worth it.  Thanks again for the DVD5's, sailo."
