Shot in 4:3 format with the usual LI watermark, thereâs a couple of minor audio syncâs but nothing major... Still a very watchable copy... 
Many Thanx to IFLIX for the decent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:)"
,iamcims,2011-07-09T04:44Z,"watermarks? 4:3? hahaha

why would anyone waste their time."
,platipus24,2011-07-09T09:06Z,It seems like everytime i download torrents now im seeding about quadruple at what im downloading..would it be all possible for someone too SEED quite a bit for maybe like two hours and ill keep seeding at FULL for the next twenty? is that a fair trade? 
,platipus24,2011-07-09T09:10Z,"Not sure if my last comment went through...but if anyone wouldnt mind UPping the bandwidth for about three or four hours(so i can complete the download) i will seed at full speed all night :-)
thank you!(thats if you did..lol)"
,platipus24,2011-07-09T10:22Z,Srsly man there is this many seeders and nobody has a decent bandwidth? considering i can seed at full why cant anyone else? 
,Dribble21,2011-07-09T11:15Z,"' why would anyone waste their time '

Dude this version is different than the theatrical one, I'm so happy with this one cause it different (dialogue wise) and I'll keep it forever!"
,Dribble21,2011-07-09T11:16Z,"' why would anyone waste their time '

Dude this version is different than the theatrical one, I'm so happy with this one cause its different (dialogue wise, example the conversation in Kirby's car about Trevor and Jenny) and I'll keep it forever!"
,Hammer1974,2011-07-09T12:26Z,No disrespect to the uploader. Thank you for your time in uploading this but why in this day and age are we still getting 4:3? 
,heyman1981,2011-07-09T18:56Z,"Sme one do a 700mb copy please, some people have limited bandwidth and dont want to waste almost 2 gb on a PPV
"
,TorrentJezuz,2011-07-10T04:53Z,We get the point its 4:3 and has water marks. So shut the fuck up and stop bitching you faggots.Say thanks and download or get the fuck away from torrents and never use them again. Thanks IwannaFan2
,saqwatxer,2011-07-10T13:39Z,When a decent rip for Scream 4?
,Rosechu,2011-07-12T04:05Z,"A 9
V 8

4:3 format

There is a watermark, but at the last 2 mins of the film and at the bottom of the screen, doesn't interfere with the movie.

Very watchable copy if you can't wait for the DVD rip.  

Some dialogue slightly different from the theatrical version, would be good to keep and compare if the dvd cut is the theatrical cut."
,ericv1984,2011-07-13T04:22Z,"@saqwatxer, this is a ""decent rip"" of scream 4, faggot. Can't get any better then PPVRip right now, duh."
,wayneomac,2011-07-23T21:19Z,yeah it's in 4:3 but good rip. Thx uploader.
