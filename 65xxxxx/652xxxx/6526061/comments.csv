Ping is a basic Internet program that allows a user to verify that a particular IP address exists and can accept requests.

Ping is used diagnostically to ensure that a host computer the user is trying to reach is actually operating. Ping works by sending an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request to a specified interface on the network and waiting for a reply. Ping can be used for troubleshooting to test connectivity and determine response time.

Go into the folder which you installed Counter Strike in, then right click and press Properties. Go to security, and give yourself FULL CONTROL to the folder. Wait until it is done, and then use the icon from your desktop to access the game.

Enjoy! :D"
