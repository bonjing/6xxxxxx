,i.me.myself,2011-07-09T17:39Z,VIP uploaders also upload shit stuff? anyone d/l this? pls comment!
,QborT,2011-07-09T19:26Z,"How do you 2 dumbasses both think it's shit?  It's a fuckin .avi file, you morons.

The only thing shit about this is the fact that scenebalance doesn't seed 90% of their uploads."
,EinStupid,2011-07-09T19:44Z,Something odd with scenebalance's ups today.  Over 100 and not able to download a few i've tried. ??? hacked maybe ???
,QborT,2011-07-10T02:36Z,"EinStupid this isn't just today, this is for a long time.  The account isn't hacked scenebalance is just a dick and wants you to go register at their site.  Flip back through scenebalances list of uploads you will notice that most are unseeded."
,EinStupid,2011-07-10T19:15Z,QbortT  I see that now.  Not very convenient.
,koji2u,2011-08-27T04:57Z,"no problem with avi file but no seeders what up scene ,??? I usually don't have problems with your files"
