,unogazzy,2011-07-08T09:36Z,if you check the episode guide on tv.com you'll see that this episode is really s08e04.
,criminet1,2011-07-08T10:09Z,but they are wrong
,The_DooD,2011-07-08T12:16Z,No this is S06E17. The only thing it might be otherwise is S07E17 if you counted the movies as a season. But these episodes coming out now are just the second half of season 6.
,CWFRage,2011-07-08T12:28Z,The season was split up between two years. I don't know what the TV guide says but this is correct. The next season won't start until next year.
,rarapas,2011-07-08T19:42Z,"This is Season 6-B, the numbering is correct. Thank you eztv for being a source for us fans of many many TV shows :)"
,smangko,2011-07-08T20:28Z,you're the best! thank you!
,shawnaldo,2011-07-08T21:34Z,"It's listed as s06e17 for whatever reasons, but it should be s08e04

Series was cancelled after season 5, Then there were the movies which they converted into season 6, then last June (2010) they brought it back which should have been season 7, this june should be season 8.

For some reason they compacted the first 5 into 4 seasons. If you look on Wiki the air dates aren't even in order anymore. The movies are season 5 now. and what should be 7 and 8 is merged into season 6. 

This so called season 6 started June 2010 and keeps going past June 2011? Makes no sense... kinda confusing for the fans, but we can all agree it's great to have it back.

Thanks for the upload."
,Xavier120,2011-07-09T01:30Z,"so many inaccurate comments.....

We are currently in season 7a.  this is 4/13 of 7a, with 7b also being 13 episodes later this year or next year.  That is all. "
,train_wreq,2011-07-09T14:37Z,"trying to claim that a movie presentation also counts as a season (episodic story broken up through a couple month period) is like saying the Stargate movie was 'season 1' (to SG1) or the Stewie Griffin movie was actually 'season 5' or Godfather 2 was 'season 2'. Its not only confusing to others, its f*cking retardly wrong."
,seedplease2010,2011-07-09T21:42Z,"Even more inaccurate comments, the original series ran for 5 seasons, the episodes we watched last year were the first half of season 6, the 6 month break between episodes was a mid season break, we are now watching the second half of season 6. "
,RipOrDie999,2011-07-10T02:24Z,Thanks. 
,hollende,2011-07-11T23:01Z,"Funny comments for no reason
Some movies are like a season
They come and pass and come again
Thanks EZTV
And thanks Futurama creators! The recent episodes rock!"
,Nanostronghold,2011-07-12T00:00Z,"Just to make this convo even more complicated :P Based on the UK version of the complete futurama dvd boxset, this would only be season 5 :P"
,jj441,2011-07-15T04:03Z,its definitely season 6 ep 17. stop trying to confuse people.
,shawnaldo,2011-07-15T09:03Z,"First of all... Thanks for the upload!!!

For everyone who doesn't know the history of this show. There's were originally 5 seasons of Futurama... then it was cancelled by Fox. 

Then Futurama made 4 movies to see if there was still interest. There was, then those movies were AIRED AS A SEASON. Technically it should have been season 6... but for some reason they crunched the original 5 into 4 seasons. Labelled the movies as season 5. (Normally I would agree that movies don't count as a season, but If you are a diehard Futurama fan, you know the movies follow the main plot/continuity of the entire series.)

Then Futurama was revived last summer. This was called season 6-A and this summer is 6-B. Since when do seasons take 2 years? This is why people say these seasons should be Seasons 7 & 8. 

If you look it up the next two years of shows are broken up as 7A & 7B too. I'll warn you know... people will be calling them season 9 and 10. 

It really doesn't matter what you call them. There is no right answer worth getting all uptight over... just be happy it's back and there's at least there's two more years of Futurama!!! WOO!!!"
,FavouriteX,2011-07-16T07:04Z,Good stuff.
