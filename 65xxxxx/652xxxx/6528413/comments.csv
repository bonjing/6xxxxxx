,velcroman0001,2011-07-28T10:18Z,Please EZTV DON'T wrap your files as .mkv files it is SO BLOODY hard to find a media boxes that will read the damb files.  Follow the KISS principle and keep file in .AVI.  This files you can play on a 'tin whistle'.
,zaqaz,2011-07-30T11:21Z,"@velcromad0001: MKV is THE standard now and in the near future. Lots of media boxes support it and those who don't is, well... Let's just say you shouldn't spend your money on companies that doesn't adapt their products."
,rawree,2011-08-01T23:06Z,What media box doesn't support MKV?! o.O Even the hacked AppleTV can take it..
,tdiamante,2012-01-04T18:32Z,"It makes it difficult to write to DVD on a MAC without having to convert as Toast does not read MKV files.
Converting from MKV to AVI pixelates the hell out of the file leaving the quality from a 10 down to about a 7. You put so much effort into doing his for us it would just be far for appreciated  if it were a universal such as AVI for burning.  Thanks for the files though "
,jctcom,2012-04-03T20:12Z,Please keep giving us the high quality MKVs.  I really appreciate the higher quality and the 5.1 surround in most of them.  I never download crappy low quality AVI files.
