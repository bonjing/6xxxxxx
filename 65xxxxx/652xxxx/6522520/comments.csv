,jamie9000001,2011-07-21T10:23Z,"@Oxumoska - Unzip the file using WinRAR or similar programme, open the Emulator, go to file, then open, the search for the folder where the games are held, select the game you want to play, and enjoy.

@DJLucius - You can, but not in the version of VBA I've included here"
,Earl96,2012-04-10T16:34Z,I unzipped but the destination folder is nowhere to be found. 
,Earl96,2012-04-10T16:37Z,Oh lol nevermind. Never seen games go to documents.
