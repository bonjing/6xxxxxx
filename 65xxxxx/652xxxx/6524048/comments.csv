,guybhoy,2011-07-09T01:56Z,@ Pwny your kind and constructive comments make me want to ask what forums you use so I can be sure and avoid them ;)

the video is defo better than any camrip but it's not dvd quality.
it looks somewhat grainy and as if it had some sort of filter on, kinda weird but still very watchable compared to the cams."
,Sketikal2,2011-07-09T12:33Z,whinny bitches. How about a thank you for a very watchable movie. 
,Purification,2011-07-09T12:53Z,"@ Pwny ThePirateBay is of course a place where people can ask questions, also some questions that seem stupid. Everyone once learned how to use these devices, so you are in fact judging yourself.

Maybe we can put a basic manual on this site? So everyone won't ask these questions anymore.

Anyhow, this is a great movie. Enjoy!"
,thrash16er,2011-07-09T21:06Z,i was wondering I see the file format is a .MKV and it wont let me burn it to a dvd what (free) program can i use to convert file format

,BlizardBusty,2011-07-10T00:42Z,"@ trash16er you can use ""mkv2vob"" to do the convertion.
I always use it to convert mkv-files for my PS3! ;)"

Great film for fans and worth looking... will seed!"
,thrash16er,2011-07-10T14:48Z,blizardbusty- is the program called mkv2vob?
,BlizardBusty,2011-07-10T16:00Z,"@ thrash16er Yes the program is called mkv2vob, 
and just google it, since it i a free program :)"
,Phatfish,2011-07-10T18:38Z,"@shattered_red:

I dont know why you rate the audio when you are deaf. Nothing against deaf people but... The subs would be great for a deaf person as they are not only present for the non-English scenes but all through the movie which is pretty annoying for us hearing people. Also something that you as a deaf person wouldn't notice is that the subs are totally out of sync.


But thanks anyway!"
