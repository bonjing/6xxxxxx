John is an extraordinary teen, masking his true identity and passing as a typical
high school student to elude a deadly enemy seeking to destroy him. Three like him
have already been killed ... he is Number Four. 

Uploader Note: I don't really trust DEFACED (p2p used sources history for a scene group) and
would wait for a 1 gb/hd version but if you don't want to wait more here you go,when a
better quality will be available i will upload it for sure
