The screenshots are provided in the links below.
Please Seed after you finish downloading so that others can download as well

There are a total of 36 Tutorials in this torrent, and a list.txt file which displays all the names of the videos.
Don't Expect rar files from me, I don't plan on uploading anything other than what I write here.

Downloaded in .mp4 format, so you can play it offline.
