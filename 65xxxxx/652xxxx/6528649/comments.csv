Reboot computer and try update."
,StankyLefthand,2011-09-13T18:55Z,"ooohhhhh ggooooooooodd, game won't update no matter what, can't play the game and now the uninstaller just keeps freezing. how fun. is there any other way to uninstall this from my comp? because, uh, I'm not seeing anything other than the Remove option in the Windows Installer package in the torrent file and it seems to enjoy freezing itself."
,StankyLefthand,2011-09-13T20:49Z,"Nevermind, CCleaner fixed it. I really wanted to play the game too but noooooo, even when my computer can handle stuff it decides it doesn't want to play nice. Thank you for the upload, though. Was worth a try, ya know?"
