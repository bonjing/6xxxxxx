[T],bookzilla,2011-07-08T13:04Z,so you are saying don't bother downloading this?
[V],extremezone,2011-07-08T13:09Z,"something like this if you care about quality-this is the best version out but still doesn't worth downloading until a real dvdrip (not a mislabeled one) , see sample and decide for yourself-maxspeed high quality dvdrip copy will be made for sure but in about 1-2 months"
,imdevil20,2011-07-08T13:12Z,its a line audio guys check sample..audio is clean..i have wait for cm8 release..

Dude, you are completely full of shit. So full of shit that you must fart through your ears.

Seriously - this upload by extremezone is in fact BETTER that the file you seem to have a hard-on for.  It is certainly not a CAM you fuckwit.

I've downloaded both, and the smaller file you are in love with is obviously inferior to the larger file.

Both are good, but the larger is excellent.

If you want to watch the move on your stupid little iphone or other piece-of-crap mobile device, by all means go for the smaller file. But to claim the smaller file is better quality just shows how much of a dweeb you really are.

Knucklehead!"

 (Like the Wolverine one awhile back, that still had sketches/rough drafts where 3d animations were supposed to be lol)

 I sure hope it was, this movie had some of the worst looking effects i've seen in awhile."

Btw, I have a small request for all you people. I was in India all this while and since the rules about copyright infringement is quite lax here I used to directly download the torrent file from Piratebay and  download the content using a BitTorrent client(uTorrent). 

I'll be moving to the United States shortly and I know that downloading movies off sites like Piratebay is illegal there and I could be charged for copyright infringement. What protection should I ensure to allow me to download without federal intervention ? Please guide."
