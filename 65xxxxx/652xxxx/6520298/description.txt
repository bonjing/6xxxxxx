Storyline: Edward "Eddie" Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a writer who lives in New York City and has recently been dumped by his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) in addition to failing to meet the deadline to turn in his new book, which he hasn't started yet. One day, Eddie comes across Vernon Gant (Johnny Whitworth), the brother of his ex-wife, Melissa Gant (Anna Friel). Vernon is a drug dealer, and he offers Eddie a sample of a new nootropic drug, NZT-48, claiming it has the ability for humans to access 100% of the brain's power, as opposed to the normal 20%. Eddie accepts, and, much to his surprise, the drug does indeed work, allowing him to finish his book.Eddie asks Vernon for more of the drug, and Vernon agrees, after Eddie runs a few errands for him. When Eddie returns to Vernon's apartment, he finds Vernon murdered and promptly calls the police. He quickly deduces that Vernon was probably killed by someone who wanted his stash of NZT, and he searches Vernon's apartment for it. He finds the stash of NZT and a wad of cash and uses it to turn his life around. He abandons his writing career and starts trading stocks, borrowing capital from a Russian thug, Gennady (Andrew Howard). Eddie becomes rich at an incredibly fast pace and is soon employed by the powerful businessman Carl Van Loon (Robert DeNiro). Eddie also gets back together with Lindy. Meanwhile, he feels that he is being followed by a man in a tan coat (Tomas Arana). He also starts using more and more NZT, causing side effects to occur: lost time, frenetic activity, and heart palpitations.
