Are you using winrar or 7zip because sometimes i have problems with winrar extracting zip files, so you should use 7zip."
,takiyagenji,2011-07-25T01:17Z,so this will allow us to use steam and cysis's multiplayer?
,ka40,2011-07-25T03:47Z,"Eh, no.
steam and cracks don't work, and multiplayer doesn't work because you just can't go with a fake copy (or key) in the mp.
this patch would just let you play crysis 2 in dx11 tesselation and improved textures."
,vwoot3,2011-07-29T21:52Z,"Hey can you explain me why there is 2 sorts of 1.9 patch ?
I mean there's the original from the website : http://www.geforce.com/News/articles/download-the-crysis-2-directx-11-ultra-upgrade
~130MB 
and there's other ones around 18mb on the internet? Thank you!"
,ka40,2011-07-29T22:50Z,"@vwoot3
I think i know what you saw,
The patch 1.9 of a 130 MB is the patch itself to update the game.
The 18 MB file is the crack for the patch so people can play the game with the ""illegal copy"" 'of the game'."
,vwoot3,2011-07-30T19:06Z,"Alright, thanks for answering ka40.
I have a last question, I saw people getting problems with saving the game with the FLT's torrent.
Is your crack fixing this ?
Thank you! :)"
,ka40,2011-07-30T21:29Z,"@Vwoot3
No, this doesn't fix the saving issue.
to fix it use this crack: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6516040/Crysis_2_-_WORKING_v1.9_Patch_Crack_-_save_problem_fixed.rar
(Copy/Paste)
(Note: this is the FLT's crack.)"
,vwoot3,2011-08-01T01:47Z,"The link you posted seems to be a skidrow crack.

Fairlight made one too;

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6547309/Crysis.2.v1.9.With.Savegame.Fix-Fairlight
Should I take this one  ? ^ 
Will everything be fine if I install the original 1.9 patch and use FLT's crack ?
Thanks"
,ka40,2011-08-01T05:39Z,"i didn't try that 1 yet.
if you have a choice between 2 torrents just use the 1 with more seeds.
(or just try them all and use the 1 that works the best for you.)"
,bomber3swe,2011-09-10T21:16Z,Shit crack
,dandalis,2012-04-20T13:04Z,why is the size so small ?
,dandalis,2012-04-20T20:17Z,"well this tottaly fucked up my game, now there are no sound and when i start playing, i just fall down from textures."
