,debugman18,2011-07-09T07:38Z,This is working for everybody?
,noxnoxnox,2011-07-09T16:55Z,"I'm downloading, a little bit nervous about the spell book because I had a bug with it when I install it as simspack. Hope this one work. "
,rctalon417,2011-07-09T17:48Z,my spellbook works fine but does this have the library in it . i cant find it in my game.
,debugman18,2011-07-09T17:52Z,"No, it does not have the library lot. I'll see what I can do about uploading it."
,noxnoxnox,2011-07-10T02:57Z,"Thank you very much, fast downloading and the spell book works perfectly. I think the building needs to be separated from package. It's like the previous Olympian Gym, I have to install the gym and library from sims3pack.
But is there a massage chair in the package? I can't find it nowhere.
Again, thanks for sharing."
,noxnoxnox,2011-07-10T03:09Z,"Oops, sorry. I made a mistake, the massage chair is in June compilation, not July. I just can't find it. "

Games4theworld has a June store content compilation, if you need to grab it."
,noxnoxnox,2011-07-10T10:14Z,"I appreciate the link, I can locate the chair now. Thanks for your help."

,gxj,2011-07-22T03:21Z,Ok I don't have a mods folder in my Sims 3 file. Do I make one or what? I am a derp noob at this so please help. lol
,debugman18,2011-07-22T08:55Z,You can simply create a Mods folder. Then you must create the Packages folder within the Mods folder. Then put the files there.
,gxj,2011-07-22T10:36Z,"Thanks. Now my sims crashes and the main loading screen is fucked. So I just removed it, thanks though."
,debugman18,2011-07-23T10:04Z,If it crashes your game then you did something wrong. Most likely you don't have a Resource.cfg. 
,MichealRein,2011-07-24T00:56Z,"So this is July only, correct?"
,MichealRein,2011-07-24T01:48Z,"The spell book works, thanks"
,debugman18,2011-07-24T01:49Z,Yes.
,SarahK_2009,2011-07-27T06:58Z,Thanks! :)
,yoashmo,2011-08-02T00:16Z,do you plan to upload these in sim3.pack?
,debugman18,2011-08-02T01:10Z,"@Yoshmo No, I do not."
,AyresUK,2011-08-04T16:34Z,Does This Work On Mac OSX??
,debugman18,2011-08-05T06:44Z,It is .package files. So one would assume so.
