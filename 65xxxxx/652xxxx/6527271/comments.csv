[V],mkvGOD,2011-07-09T19:02Z,"@dingo8baby

source is 720p HDTV rip

@Night_89

I'm not going to redo that anytime soon, and I believe it has a few problems. But it should be fine other than what people said in the comments"
,dingo8baby,2011-07-09T20:44Z,"@mkvGOD awesome, thanks!"
,fasurvivor,2011-07-09T21:20Z,"thanks mate!

waiting for the DEXTER S01 re-up
and still looking forward to LOST, 24, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA"
,maxbot,2011-07-09T22:22Z,"will you be doing 

a. 30 Rock
b. Seinfeld

anytime soon? please?"
,fasurvivor,2011-07-10T08:10Z,"Quality is going down day by day
mad men was the best result I found in your torrents
Plz Redo the setting of your encoding
Parks & Recreation is not fair as well
just a feedback- don`t mind
just try to encode like
Mad Men V10-A10"
[V],mkvGOD,2011-07-10T09:21Z,"@fasurvivor

i dont know what you are seeing, but they are all the same settings"
,kkiran,2011-07-10T13:00Z,hhey can u do sopranos tv show?? in a small size if possible...i cant find any small size uploads...try if u can! 
,fasurvivor,2011-07-10T18:38Z,"I played mad men on 32"" and the result was just great and this one was not good even on 17"" monitor"
,Night_89,2011-07-10T18:43Z,"I think I agree with fasurvivor
almost all of your torrents are great other than some
the re-ups like Rome, Jericho, John Adams are excellent as well but this one and some of the others are not good enough"
,paddymad1,2011-07-10T18:56Z,"Killing , Mad Men, Friday Night Lights and now Arrested Development..talk about quality shows..excellent stuff lad.

Add Sopranos and Battlestar Galactica to that to form a list of the most substantive American TV shows.

Can I expect any of them anytime soon?"
,Night_89,2011-07-10T19:07Z,"Yeah, I am also waiting for Battlestar Galactica
Please reply if you could do it any time soon or I should try this one
from the torrent comments I know the result is just brilliant just one problem, size is bigger than your torrents
waiting for reply

for anyone wondering
this one is the entire series and the best result yet

,HBOFan,2011-07-11T09:36Z,"Hi mkvGOD, I am a big fan of your work. No one compresses it like you. Well done. Are you going to upload ""The Sopranos"" in HD any time soon?"
[V],mkvGOD,2011-07-11T13:53Z,working on sopranos
,pjsmoke,2011-07-12T15:45Z,"Once again I'll replace my rips with yours, thanky.

@Everyone, if you love Seinfeld or Curb Your Enthusiasm you will love this show...Download it!"
,pjsmoke,2011-07-14T02:27Z,"@fasurvivor

If one of mkvgod's newer torrents doesn't seem as good as another, it's because the source/original video he encoded from is not as good as other sources for his other uploads. For example Bluray rips are obviously better than HDTV rips etc.

People can't improve upon the original video, especially if the encoder lowers the bitrate for convenience for the uploader and everyone else."
,erikjen1,2011-07-16T22:14Z,Thank you! Seeding.....
,HBOFan,2011-07-18T14:38Z,Anyone has english subtitles for this?
,daledenton,2011-09-26T23:39Z,"Brilliant quality and fast download, i will seed as hell. Thanks mkvGOD!"
,Seutekop,2012-06-04T00:34Z,"Are there screenshots anywhere? Pardon my suspicion, but 6,7 GiB seems a bit small for 53 30-minute 720p episodes."
