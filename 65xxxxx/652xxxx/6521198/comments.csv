First question:   Was this a one-off upload, or are there more on the way?

This series has been impossible to find online for those of us who don't live in Ireland... those lucky guys... hmmmm ... somebody should incorporate that into a phrase and slap it on them as a stereotype.  It'd serve those little Leprechauns right!

Nah... Itâ€™d never catch on.

Now, to put things into perspective here: Imagine I had been given 3 'thepiratebay' wishes regarding Dragonsâ€™ Den Ireland, from the 'TvTeam' uploaders/creators team (I believe), they would be as follows:

1. A nice full copy of the very first episode of the first series.  -Result!  My first wish has already been granted.

2.  On an interval basis, the quicker the better though (of course), continue by posting the next episode in the series, then the next, and so on.

3.  TvTeam decides to just put up complete season files so all of us Dragons' Den groupies can get our Irish fixes on now! ...in return, weâ€™ll keep it seeded until the world has been blown to bits by religious zealots who've acquired nuclear weaponry.

If wish #2 or wish #3 come true at some point in the future, I promise to name my next 1 000 000 unfertilized sperm in that user's honour, and forever more.  No, you wonâ€™t be received yearly â€˜progress reportsâ€™ on how your namesake progeny is doing.  One photo, upon completion of your end of the deal, should suffice.  Also, ethically, I feel itâ€™s only right to inform you that I do intend on aborting each of the sperm Iâ€™ll have named after you.  Should you wish to bury them in your family plot, arraignments can be made.  (I believe the T.S.A. is OK with transporting aborted sperms, as long as they are stored in a semi-rigged combustible transport: i.e. A crumpled up Kleenex.



Next, in this (admittedly odd) post, I would like to ask a general question.  How do you folks know, with relative accuracy (no need to bring Jason Bourne in on this one) which user it was who actually capped/filmed the media.  Do you go by the one that is date-stamped' first, or on how many seeders they have, etc?  Or is there another place I haven't looked?

For example, here I'm thanking 'TvTeam' and requesting more of the same in the series/season.  If they had nothing to do with that, then I'd rather be making this comment on the board for the folks who did supply us with it.

OK, really last thought here.  This is a message to my countrymen, and our neighbours to the South:  If you find yourself unable to understand the Irish (or the Scottish/English, heck even the now-infamous 'Geordie' (Newcastle) accent, you simply need to power through it.  I call it the three episode challenge and I think it almost makes it too easy.  I challenge anybody who complains about not being able to understand these marginally different dialects, to sit down and actually watch three episodes of one TV show (find something you're interested in; BBC has LOADS of great stuff on it) and by the time youâ€™re watching the fourth episode, and far far quicker for some people, you'll no longer have any difficulty discerning what they're saying.  

They still may sound a little different to your ear, though that's typically just a result of your being unaware of their slang/media/colloquialisms, which you can learn as you go along, having already mastered the basics of how Scottish/Irish/English dialects sound.  Really, just three shows.  For those wanting to understand Brits, I recommend going 'The Office' route.  My first time, I could barely make out a sentence in the first episode.  By the last episode, I didnâ€™t miss a single word... not even a reference.

Cheers!

P.S.  I've also run an informal 'watch three consecutive episodes of Star Trek: DS9 challengeâ€™ for people with 'average' -to- 'above average' I.Q.â€™s, who, for myriad reasons, were not impressed with Star Trek.  Nearly half the"

Where was I again... oh yeah.   I think the price of tea in China is...."
