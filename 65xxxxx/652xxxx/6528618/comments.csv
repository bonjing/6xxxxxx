,Shabs123,2011-07-21T20:13Z,"@tagetes - instead of complaining about people asking questions why not use the same time to answer the question, rather than giving them instructions to wreck their pc. after all everyone is a newb at some point in time.

There is nothing worse than someone who claims to be an expert, and then complains that everyone else isn't!"

If you didn't kick his ass, I should.
Sad to see people like him exists."
,jdgga,2011-08-25T18:11Z,"To install a crack you need to just copy and paste.  First copy the crack then go to were the software was installed and paste.  If done correctly it should give you the option to copy and replace, do that.  If I need to learn how to do something I look up instructions on Utube.  This keeps you from getting replies from dicks like Tagetes."

IP BLOCKING"" software only 'blocks' other machines from connecting to you. It 
does NOTHING to obscure your IP address, either internal or external in ANY 
WAY.
IP Blocking software simply has a big list of ""known bad"" IP's. IP's 
used by the **AA, government, spyware companies, etc, It keeps those IP's 
from making a connection to your machine.
Your ISP, on the other hand, could in theory (but doesn't bother to in 
practice) see every packet that leaves your machine. There is NO way around 
that.
If you use a secure proxy you can encrypt packets... FOR HTML WEB 
SURFING ONLY and your ISP will only see that you are requesting data from a 
proxy. However, this does NOTHING to hide your P2P activity. It ONLY works for 
web pages.
There is NO WAY to ""hide"" your IP address. Any program which 
claims to do so is simply lying to you. Period

Fact.............."

,Sprout,2011-12-09T00:13Z,"@dannowrw the free version of autohide ip does hide your ip address. i checked when i visited facebook. facebook tracks your ip address. how to see your location on facebook: account setting, security, active sessions. shows your location and what browser you are using. the free 30day version of this programs worked exactly as they described it. this torrent does not work however. shows my location on multiple sites i went to. the free version said i was where i set it to, on every site i went to. this torrent, still showed my normal ip. and i followed directions exactly. this isnt my first cracked program that ive gotten. every one has worked but this one. could be the plug in issue or that there is an updated version of autohide ip. dont know why this one isnt working."
