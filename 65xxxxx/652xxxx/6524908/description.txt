It premiered with the episode "Peter, Peter, Caviar Eater" and finished with "Fore Father".

Nielsen Ratings with 6.320 million households tuning in.[1]

By the end of the second season, due to low ratings, Fox resorted to canceling Family Guy. However, following a last-minute reprieve, it returned for a third season in 2001. The series was canceled again in 2002; however, high ratings on Adult Swim and high DVD sales renowned Fox's interest in the series. The series returned for a total of 35 new episodes in 2004.

The season received a favorable reception from critics, who called the series "extremely witty and darkly hilarious," and was "unfortunately" canceled.[2] The Volume One DVD box set was released in Region 1 on April 15, 2003 and Region 2 on November 12, 2001. All twenty-one of the season's episodes are included in the volume. The first season's seven episodes were also included in the volume.
