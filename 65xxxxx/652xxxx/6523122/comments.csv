One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Kept expecting it to get better and it just continued to disappoint. This movie is just plain stupid. If you like really pathetic and contrived plot and dialog watch the movie for yourself. But remember, you were warned...Reviewing guidelines say I have to submit ten lines or they won't submit this review. I have never written a review before. But i have never seen such a pathetic movie such as this before. So sorry about that, I just have to write more so that they will publish this review. You can stop reading this review, I don't have anything else to say about this movie which is just so unbelievable that it might make you mad you watched it like me...
