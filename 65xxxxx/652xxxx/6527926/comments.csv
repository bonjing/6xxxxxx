It's in the torrent.  You can download the book list by only selecting that file in your download window.

There are only 3 files - the .rar, the readme, and the downloaded from demonoid.
There is no way to access the book list as far as I can tell."

Do the stars out of five (in the far right column) represent the visual quality of the ebook (formatting and whatnot) or some subjective rating (the 'stars' of a book on amazon, for example)?
