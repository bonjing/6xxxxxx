** Reading these Books **
 All MOBI files can be transferred directly to the Kindle.
 You can use Calibre to transfer, and also to read the books on PC.
 There are other free apps that will let you read them on PC, iPad and other book readers. 
 Calibre can also convert them to epub format (or a dozen other formats).

** Calibre **
 Calibre is free software for managing and viewing e-books.
 It is available from http://calibre-ebook.com/ .
 If you have a version prior to 0.8.8,
 consider upgrading as previous versions were somewhat unstable when trying to work with a collection this large.
 Once Calibre is installed, just point it to wherever you downloaded this collection and tell it to "use existing library".
 If you already have a calibre library, Calibre is happy to switch back and forth and has features to copy files between libraries.


Please keep this Torrent going by seeding back,thank you
