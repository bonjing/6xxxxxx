a=9
Thanks for listing"
,blusniffer,2011-07-16T16:08Z,"@CRITIC89 loving the irony, named critic and gives this poor R5 a 10/10! lol

The opening part of the movie with kevin bacon and the kid looks like a clip from a 70s german porn flick with rough out of focus picture and bad audio sync! All that was missing was bacon pulling a blonde and dildo out of the drawer! lmao
357mb only good thing!"
,swiftless,2011-07-17T02:37Z,"very good quality, thank you"

,EXODDUS_27,2011-07-29T01:20Z,"hey styLishSalH
Thnx for this film great copy for R5, Please could you upload Scream 4 if you can.
Also i was woundering if by any chance you are a fan of Laurel and Hardy as i am a big fan of them myself, i have most of their films and their solo's but i do have a few requests of those that i am unable to get:

should Tall Men Marry?, Scorching Sands, Wandering Papas, Mum's The Word, Mighty Like A Mouse, the bakery, love and duty, Angora love, zenobia and air raid wardens. 
Appreciate your work man. If anyone have any of these great classics. please seed! Thnx."
