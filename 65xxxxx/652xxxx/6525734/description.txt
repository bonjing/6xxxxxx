Maybe it's because they look almost exactly alike--and it's a look you're not likely to forget--but more than any other pair of brothers in rock & roll, Johnny and Edgar Winter will always be thought of as a duo, despite the fact that they really don't play together very much. Johnny's a straight-up bluesman, after all, a white-hot guitarist with roots in the Texas soul of T-Bone Walker and Charlie Christian. Little brother Edgar, a keyboard and saxophone prodigy, has more eclectic tastes, with his own albums ranging from jazz-tinged instrumental funk to space-prog epics.

The joke is that even on 1992's Hey, Whereâ€™s Your Brother--a phrase both of them must hear a dozen times a day--Edgar only joins his big brother on a few tracks, a soulful rendition of Charles Brown's blues classic "Please Come Home for Christmas" being a clear highlight. Another treat is the sassy "You Must Have a Twin," one of the non-twins' few co-written songs. The whole album bristles with good humor and genial attitude, making it one of the most enjoyable items in either brother's catalogue.
