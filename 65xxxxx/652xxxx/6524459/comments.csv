00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,708
Understand this, Erik.
These Nazi's, I'm not like them.

2
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:05,948
Genes are the key, yes...

3
00:04:06,232 --> 00:04:12,973
But their goals? Blue eyes,
Blond hair, Pathetic.

4
00:04:18,497 --> 00:04:19,936
Eat the chocolate.

5
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:22,350
It's good.

6
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:24,144
Want some?

7
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:28,126
I want to see my, Mama.

8
00:04:35,096 --> 00:04:40,659
Genes are the keys that
unlocks the door to a new age, Erik.

9
00:04:41,512 --> 00:04:44,943
A new future for mankind.

10
00:04:44,944 --> 00:04:46,833
Evolution.

11
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,059
You know what I'm talking about?

12
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:55,036
It's a simple thing I ask of you.

13
00:04:55,288 --> 00:05:00,801
A little coin is nothing compared
to a big gate.

14
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:02,761
Is it?

15
00:05:17,863 --> 00:05:19,897
I tried, Herr Doctor...

16
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:23,543
I can't...I don't...

17
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:26,334
It's impossible.

18
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:33,900
The one thing I can say for the Nazi's,
is their methods seem to produce results.

19
00:05:36,925 --> 00:05:38,458
I'm sorry, Erik.

20
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,616
Mama!

21
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:52,848
My darling.

22
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:55,128
How are you?

23
00:05:58,963 --> 00:06:00,591
Here's what we're going to do.

24
00:06:01,713 --> 00:06:04,332
I'm going to count to three...

25
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:08,217
...and you're going to move the coin.

26
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:13,456
You don't move the coin,
I pull the trigger.

27
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:16,905
Understand?

28
00:06:18,198 --> 00:06:19,622
One...

29
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:23,175
- Mama!
- You can do it.

30
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:29,228
Two...

31
00:06:32,202 --> 00:06:33,912
Everything is all right.

32
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,758
Everything is all right.

33
00:06:47,336 --> 00:06:48,336
Everything is all right!

34
00:06:49,796 --> 00:06:50,950
Three.

35
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:14,039
Yes, wonderful!

36
00:07:24,147 --> 00:07:25,287
Excellent!

37
00:07:36,352 --> 00:07:53,832
No....

38
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,373
Outstanding, Erik!

39
00:08:12,514 --> 00:08:16,068
So we unlock you're gift with anger.

40
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:20,832
Anger and pain.

41
00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:28,753
You and me, we're going to
have a lot of fun together.

42
00:13:26,925 --> 00:13:30,226
Possession of that gold is illegal.

43
00:13:30,412 --> 00:13:34,344
- I should inform the police.
- Let's not play this game.

44
00:13:34,454 --> 00:13:38,275
Where did you get it?
A Friend.

45
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:40,852
He recommended your bank, most highly.

46
00:13:42,628 --> 00:13:43,732
I see.

47
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:46,421
Do you know our terms, sir?

48
00:13:46,602 --> 00:13:47,602
Yes.

49
00:13:49,403 --> 00:13:51,910
And you should know mine.

50
00:13:54,164 --> 00:13:57,081
This gold is what remains of my people.

51
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:01,625
Melted from their possessions.
Torn from their teeth.

52
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:03,976
This is blood money.

53
00:14:04,084 --> 00:14:07,065
And you're going to help me
find the bastards responsible for it.

54
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,007
Don't touch that alarm.

55
00:14:16,695 --> 00:14:20,657
I want Schmidt, Klaus Schmidt.

56
00:14:20,807 --> 00:14:24,510
- Where is he?
- Our clients don't supply addresses, we're not...

57
00:14:24,661 --> 00:14:26,848
Not that sort of bank?

58
00:14:34,976 --> 00:14:39,269
Metal fillings, eh, not gold.
Worried someone might steal them?

59
00:14:39,381 --> 00:14:43,102
Argentina! Schmidt is in Argentina!

60
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,257
Villa Gesell!
Please, please!

61
00:15:03,585 --> 00:15:04,757
Thank you.

62
00:15:09,186 --> 00:15:11,698
I would love to kill you.

63
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:21,063
So mark my words, if you warn anyone,
I'm coming...

64
00:15:22,557 --> 00:15:24,257
...I will find you.

65
00:21:49,748 --> 00:21:52,728
- Good evening, my friends!"
,wankerr,2011-07-09T09:56Z,"65
00:21:49,748 --> 00:21:52,728
- Good evening, my friends!
- Good evening!

66
00:21:52,837 --> 00:21:54,097
- Hot, no?
- Yes...

67
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,706
One beer, please.

68
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,774
- German beer.
- Of course.

69
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:25,524
Yes, it's Bitburger. You like it?

70
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:33,450
The best.

71
00:22:38,772 --> 00:22:41,307
What brings you to Argentina?

72
00:22:43,046 --> 00:22:46,524
The climate, I'm a pig farmer.

73
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,632
Tailor, since I was a boy.

74
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,427
My father made the finest suits in DÃ¼sseldorf.

75
00:22:57,361 --> 00:22:59,751
My Parents were from, DÃ¼sseldorf.

76
00:23:01,731 --> 00:23:04,661
- What was their name?
- They didn't have a name.

77
00:23:06,689 --> 00:23:08,624
It was taken away from them...

78
00:23:09,027 --> 00:23:10,338
...by pig farmers...

79
00:23:11,664 --> 00:23:13,165
...and tailors.

80
00:23:42,205 --> 00:23:43,755
""Blood and Honor"".

81
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:45,860
Which would you care to shed first?

82
00:23:45,949 --> 00:23:49,037
- We were under orders.
- Blood then.

83
00:23:51,707 --> 00:23:54,217
- Freeze, asshole!
- Come on, shoot!

84
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,167
Who, what are you?

85
00:31:01,475 --> 00:31:02,768
Herr Doctor...

86
00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:09,055
Little Erik Lensherr.

87
00:31:17,577 --> 00:31:19,963
What kind of greeting is that?

88
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:24,890
After all these years?

89
00:53:44,344 --> 00:53:45,557
Where are you going?

90
00:53:45,558 --> 00:53:47,028
To our farm.

91
00:53:48,696 --> 00:53:50,366
Open the back.

92
00:53:50,367 --> 00:53:51,930
As you wish, as you wish.

93
00:54:14,595 --> 00:54:15,595
Anything back there?

94
00:54:15,596 --> 00:54:16,916
Nothing, it's empty.

95
00:54:20,255 --> 00:54:22,092
- Everything's okay?
- Yes.

96
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:44,920
To your health.

97
00:57:38,081 --> 00:57:39,477
Who are  you?

98
01:07:31,408 --> 01:07:32,408
Hello.

99
01:07:34,399 --> 01:07:42,616
Once again, my sympathies for your
treatment at the hands of the CIA.

100
01:07:42,617 --> 01:07:44,895
These American's are ruthless.

101
01:07:33,876 --> 01:07:38,119
Now they have their missiles placed in Turkey.

102
01:07:51,194 --> 01:07:55,766
I expect you'll be planning new
missile sites of your own.

103
01:07:55,767 --> 01:08:02,250
Somewhere where you know the American early
warning system won't help.

104
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:07,540
I hear Cuba is lovely this time of year.

105
01:08:07,621 --> 01:08:10,388
And so close to Florida.

106
01:08:11,595 --> 01:08:13,034
Missiles in Cuba?

107
01:08:15,789 --> 01:08:15,031
You're serious?

108
01:08:15,698 --> 01:08:20,778
We may as well declare war.

109
01:08:39,654 --> 01:08:42,777
Hello, General Armivolkoff.

110
01:08:46,009 --> 01:08:47,798
It's nothing.

111
01:10:58,163 --> 01:11:00,596
Captain, no sign of any American ships.

112
01:11:00,597 --> 01:11:03,200
Maintain course, full ahead.

113
01:12:10,846 --> 01:12:12,561
Dear comrades.

114
01:12:12,562 --> 01:12:20,109
The United States have dispatched
war ships for Cuba.

115
01:12:20,690 --> 01:12:14,600
This leaves us with no choice.

116
01:12:25,937 --> 01:12:29,347
Comrade First Secretary.

117
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:33,181
We must send in our fleet.

118
01:12:35,912 --> 01:12:37,874
Dispatch the fleet!

119
01:33:11,748 --> 01:33:17,430
Captain, we already have our orders.
Why so eager for new ones?

120
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:21,625
I've lived through one war, comrade.

121
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:25,072
I'd prefer not to start another.

122
01:33:27,317 --> 01:33:29,530
Battle stations, NOW!

123
01:33:39,259 --> 01:33:42,272
Fleet reports all weapons ready.

124
01:33:42,458 --> 01:33:44,375
From the Kremlin, sir.

125
01:33:44,793 --> 01:33:48,813
New orders. As of 1025 hours, the cargo
vessel Aral sea, is hereby ordered to...

126
01:33:48,814 --> 01:33:52,094
...reverse course and return to port in Odessa.

127
01:33:52,095 --> 01:33:53,554
Aral Sea, come in"
,wankerr,2011-07-09T10:00Z,"128
01:33:54,263 --> 01:33:55,935
Aral Sea, come in.

129
01:33:56,926 --> 01:33:58,339
They are not responding.

130
01:33:58,340 --> 01:33:59,912
She's not turning around.

131
01:33:59,913 --> 01:34:02,541
Aral Sea, you are ordered to turn around.

132
01:34:02,542 --> 01:34:04,254
Do not cross the line.

133
01:34:54,726 --> 01:34:56,875
USS Independence,
this is, Alexander Nevski.

134
01:36:13,218 --> 01:36:15,842
Congratulations, comrade.

135
01:36:16,038 --> 01:36:19,812
You just averted a Nuclear war.

136
01:36:10,155 --> 01:36:11,637
What?

137
01:36:21,638 --> 01:36:23,249
Take him to the brig.

138
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:25,234
What? What just happened?

139
01:53:02,585 --> 01:53:04,493
Stand by...
Standing by, sir.

140
01:53:19,167 --> 01:53:20,411
