[T],shemyaza,2011-07-10T22:40Z,So how does this compare with the Super Rugby final?
,rugbyburger,2011-07-12T16:51Z,honestly i prefer the S15 final. shemyaza had your more old matches to uploads?
,rugbyburger,2011-07-12T16:52Z,or aviva/magners/top 14 matches?
[T],shemyaza,2011-07-12T18:20Z,"Nope, sorry mate. Never fear, the Tri Nations starts next weekend :)"
,rugbyburger,2011-07-12T20:33Z,"I'm very grateful to you, if you live in switzerland your torrent it's the only choice for watch good rugby."
,JimBonner8,2011-07-17T03:58Z,"Thanks for this! Brilliant.
What a dramatic turnaround.

Heineken Cup v Super 15? Hmmm...good question. I liked both matches. I do think the HC is played at a much higher level than Magners, Aviva or Top14.  

It'd be interesting to see a HC champion v Super 15 champion Super Bowl of Club Rugby"
[T],shemyaza,2011-07-18T18:11Z,"@JimBonner8: they were talking about a HC v Super matchup a couple years ago, don't know what happened to it though..."
,Blisstick,2011-08-18T23:31Z,"Thank-you very much for this.
I was at this game - it was probably the best game of live rugby I have ever been to - absolutely unreal!

I think they scrapped the idea of Heineken Cup v Super 15 winner due to the logistics, travel, etc and also the fact the season is already too full and too long. Shame though, would be an amazing game.

Thanks again for the upload."
,JimBonner8,2012-02-20T00:08Z,"@shemyaza & @Blisstick

Yeah -- shame they can't make it happen -- now THAT would be the Super Bowl of football. 

It would have such a unique feel to it, i think. Not an International but perhaps something even more dynamic & exciting."
