,ekarth22,2011-07-12T05:24Z,"@NEil,
if you're so concerned about worm alert then use keyfiles instead of trial-reset. it is obvious Kaspersky won't let trial-reset function by itself. that's like asking a cop to handover the prison key :D"
,19wafunapogipa87,2011-07-12T12:32Z,"why you guys using a trial resetter instead of a keyfile? there's a lot of torrent site got a keyfile for your version. so stop doing things you do not want to happen.
waste of time reformatting your computer. LOL
(sayang lang oras mo sa pag format ng PC mo. hahaha!)"
,NEL117,2011-07-17T09:43Z,"19wanapogipa87, 
        di na kailangan i format ala namang nangyari sa pc ko, block naman KIS2011, subok lang kung ano mangyayari pag gamit trial resetter sa KIS. gumamit na ko nito sa ESET. na outdated na ESET kaya hanap ako iba. keyfiles din ginamit ko sa KIS2011 kuha ko pirate bay hanggang ngayon gumagana pa. OK lang, SALAMAT! MABUHAY PINOY! No need to format my format my PC, KIS2011 block it, i wanna try this if  it is effective like my past anti-virus( ESET ) i already used a trial resetter (eset) but the apps is now outdated then i tried this. i used keyfiles on my KIS2011 that i DL here on TPB. Right now KIS2011 is working good. OK , THANKS! MABUHAY PINOY! FILIPINO.. THANKS AmSterDoom. Lesson learn."
,VÃ­vek,2011-07-23T13:50Z,working only 10min.
,swexpert,2011-08-02T19:14Z,"The good news is it still works. A bit tedious process though. Patch, activate. Within the 10 min period, Unistall Kaspersky, delete license info also. Reinstall and activate as trial.

Perhaps ""Ganjin"" still left some file unaltered.

BTW i tried on XP 64bit.

Thanks and regards
SG"
,yhanzee,2011-09-15T08:45Z,"The resetter didn't work for me.. after i did all the process, I still got 90 days remaining on the next day.. Do anyone here who made it work??"
,swexpert,2011-11-15T16:24Z,"Agree, works no longer. Will stop at next update within 30 mins.

Thx
