Storyine: The racers begin the race in Hollywood. When they encounter traffic, they all, except for Soccer Mom, move up their cars in order to cross. Tom chases Jerry until he sees the tunnel where he falls at the road causing the other racers to hit him. The racers are now traveling out of the U.S. The race is initially from California to Mexico, but due to public ratings of the event, Globwobbler then pushes the finish line farther away to Amazon Basin Jungle. The first extended leg of the race is to the Amazon rainforest. During the leg, Tom switches a sign causing contestant Mallory "Soccer Mom" Macdoogle to drive her car into a pit of quicksand. She initially tries to escape using a computer rescue help system, but the system takes too long and she gets out of the car using its open sunroof. She switches the sign back and gives Jerry an orange slice. She then ventures into the jungle. Tom then attempts to cut a bridge, in an attempt to eliminate Jerry. However, Jerry gets to the end of the bridge and Tom's car is set on reverse and falls into piranha-infested waters. However, he gets back up with a contraption in his car. Then J.W. changes the leg to get more ratings. The hosts, Biff and Buzz, then announce the next leg of the race is set in Antarctica, and they will have to modify their cars for water transport.
