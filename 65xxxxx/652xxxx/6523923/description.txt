Notes
Firstly had to crop black borders and resize, added slight smothnoor script and strong denoiser to clean the video up,
added strong sharpness to get some life into it, added slight contrast/brightness levels as it was rather dark
not too bad overal but not great either, retail prob only 2 or 3 weeks away if you can wait

Sample included so check it out first

Enjoy
