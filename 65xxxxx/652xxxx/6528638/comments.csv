,mna127,2011-07-15T19:28Z,"HDRUS - thank you!!  Question, for you or someone who is willing to educate me -- The IMPORTANT INFORMATION is very helpful!  I only watch movies streaming from my PC to TV (fast PC), using VLC.  With these iso files (which I understand are different from non-BluRay iso's) once extracting the m2ts file, is there an easy way to just convert it to AVI or MP4 rather than burning or software mounting the disc?  THANKS FOR ANY ADVICE!  "
,rogue1911,2011-07-16T22:26Z,OMFG Soooooooooo glad you are back you are the only one who that puts up great proper blu ray HD THANK YOU SOOOOOOO MUCH :)
[T],HD-R-US,2011-07-17T03:06Z,"mna127 - Hi, I'm not sure why you would want to convert an .m2ts file, because it can be streamed directly once the image is mounted to a virtual drive or extracted, and any conversion would mean some loss in quality. In saying that, VLC Media Player can work differently for some in comparison to others, dependant on version/operating system- some can play an AVCHD disc image directly, without even mounting it, when for others VLC Media Player will state that no video file has been selected. Personally, I use Twonky Media or Media Server for all streaming, but naturally, it's each to their own - just stay away from conversions if you can help it. ;o)

rogue1911 - Cheers, and enjoy. :o)"
,pirateYoho,2011-07-20T18:15Z,"to HD-R-US
first, thanks for the up..
 I am new to this style of up (file format)
I read the comments above and see that u have much respect from the other pb fans! 
 I wouls like to also be a fan, but not sure to dl a 4gig file if i dont know it will work for me. i dont know shiet about streaming , i have pc and ps3 and big LCD tv. I have VLC & MPC , never needed more. I can update vlc if i need, but do you or ANYONE know the details about what is needed to view this file?  I havea MAC but never have out it online ,its too precious :) 
thanks to all for input and thanks again to HD-r-US !"
,pirateYoho,2011-07-20T18:28Z,"i should have read the IMPORTANT INFORMATION FIRST! sorry HD-R-US!

I really wish it was not so complicated.. are u sure i cant just plug the HDMI cable into my TV and witch via PC?  I dont want to get a virtual drive and dont even know what it is! 
Why do i have to burn to disc.. i have 3 terabyte drives, i stopped using Discs ages ago!
 And if its already on my hardDrive why do i need to burn it again?
  I apologize for my ignorance but id really like to sample your Up's cuz everyone above says ur the best! thanks!"
,DonDyablo13,2011-07-20T18:54Z,glad to see you back ive got a couple of your downloads that ive seeded when you were gone and im still seeding them :) can you let me know what movies youre uploading now thanks in advance.
,PryingOpenMy3rdEye,2011-07-22T20:15Z,"@PirateYoho

As far as I know, you can just plug an HDMI cable into your PC and run it to your TV, IF you have a computer with a blu ray disc drive. (My computer doesn't have a Blu ray drive, so this doesnt work for me, or it could simply be that I don't have the proper codecs, it doesnt matter as I always burn them to disc) But what you will need to do, like stated above, is to get a program like Alcohol 120% or Daemon tools, which will allow you to make a a VIRTUAL DRIVE, which is basically a fake Disc drive, that you can mounth CD images to, to tricky our computer into thinking that actual disc is inserted, and then you can watch the files that way...

Sorry if I typed that out extremely confusing....and to HD-R-US, sorry if it seems like I'm leading your followers in the wrong direction, I'm simply trying to help as I think everyone should have access to your awesome releases."
,patch5252,2011-07-24T22:00Z,"o my god ""hd r us"" is back, tought u had left us, great to see u back man ur the best"
,somedude112,2011-07-25T20:10Z,Once i mount it what program can i use to watch it. thanks in advance
,lordquad,2011-07-25T22:34Z,This movie is tainted with bad frames :(
,PryingOpenMy3rdEye,2011-07-26T10:08Z,"@lordquad

Hey genius, I'm going to point you in the direction of some information you should have already clearly read in the INFO:

""Fair warning - Many computers will struggle to render Hi-Def video smoothly unless they're up-to-date and/or fast, so if the movie is sluggish or out-of-sync, don't worry; it's your hardware, not us! (="""
,Velkan89,2011-07-30T07:33Z,"Thank your movies they're all great quality. But I'd Like to know how you get them to that file size once they are ripped from the disc? I can rip and make ISO files like you have here, but I'm stumped on the compression part."
,jff3,2011-07-31T06:23Z,"No all tv's work with an hdmi cabled plugged in running to the tv, some are unsupported. If you cant play this on your pc, you need to download Power iso, which was stated above, which allows you to play the iso."
,jff3,2011-07-31T06:27Z,"Ive played these iso's before with Power iso, with no problem takes a while to figure out the software. i like .mkv because its easy for me. But im sure this format is the best and most versatile."
,JUSTlN182,2011-08-01T04:21Z,"@everyone who has trouble watching the video

there are many ways to watch the movie. you can burn it to a disc like it says in the description, or you can simply watch the .mt2s file from your computer(and connect HDMI cable to TV if you like). download CCCP, this is a codec pack. then open the .mt2s file by mounting it to your drive, or putting the burned disc into your drive. you can browse the contexts of the disc and then click on the file if your computer doesnt support blu ray discs."
,JUSTlN182,2011-08-01T04:27Z,"thanks HD-R-US 
I was wondering if you could upload some series of movies:
Star Wars Saga
Harry Potter movies
Lord of the Rings Trilogy
i would love if you could upload any of these movies
thanks and keep up the great work"
,DontPissMeOff,2011-08-06T13:02Z,"@Justin182
Harry Potter movies
Lord of the Rings Trilogy
have already been uploaded and can be even found in TOP 100."
,Luckmann,2011-08-06T22:01Z,"How do you get this to work with VLC? I mount it through Daemon Tools Lite, I try to run it through VLC, and bam, big wad of nothing.

Says it cannot open it."
,Krimian,2011-09-18T23:34Z,"Seen this movie on a crappy copy disc from india, But im going to download it now in this 1080p beast and enjoy it even more!

So thanks alot! :D"
,Krimian,2011-09-18T23:35Z,Plus i'll seed to about a ratio of 2 or 3 we'll see :()
,hackerps3,2011-11-13T04:24Z,"@HD-R-US
So I'm new to this site but not new to torrents and such. I'm running Windows XP Pro Media Center Edition and using VLC Media Player. I downloaded this torrent and must say I have to give it a 10! For using such an old computer with these new updated HD video's, it's still great. The video's play on my comp like it has HD! Anyways...just wanted to give my .002 and say thank you to HD-R-US and keep up the great work bud!"
