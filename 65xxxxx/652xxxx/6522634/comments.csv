It is not that much bad. I'll give 7.5/10 to it.
If you want better then download of MJN.

,missbooty,2011-08-30T16:24Z,"For those who can't hear: This Isn't even the REAL song. It's some cover. The words are wrong, and not to mention, It's not even the same VOICES!!! 
Nice cover, but please do not mislead and get us to think this is the real version. Rename this! "

,HiroPro2,2011-10-10T07:11Z,"Mp3 101 !!!

(1) Encode using LAME (itunes is CRAP using Fraunhofer encoder boo!!)

(2) Set encoder to VBR (variable bit rate) as LAME was engineered for this. CBR is CRAP and in all honesty a VBR altpreset standard at -V2 is as good as a 320 CBR !!!! and file is WAY SMALLER!!!

(3) SET IT TO JOINT STEREO NOT ""STEREO"" and if I have to explain don't ask because you have no comprehension of what the setting actually does or the maths/technology behind mp3!!!

owhh and LEARN how to use GOOGLE and RESEARCH ripping music PROPERLY you 320 CBR Fraunhofer RETARDS!!!

PS dBpoweramp is FANTASTIC ripping software!"
