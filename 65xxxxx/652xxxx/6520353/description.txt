Today is a great day for us all, and a very bad one for italian universities.

Their sites are full of weaknesses. Some of them even think being secure,

so they don't mind hashing their passwordz.

And you, Italian people, are giving all your data to idiots like these?

Is it a joke?

Change your passwordz, guys.

Change your concept of security, universities.

We could have leaked much more.

We could have destroyed your db and your network.

Were you ready for this?
