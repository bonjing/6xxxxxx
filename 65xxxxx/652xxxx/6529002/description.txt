Halo-101 Bringing You A First Encode Release.....
Toy Story -- Hawaiian Vacationâ€ CAM V2

Ok so here is my first encode and i decided to make it a favourite of mine, short, easy and a unreleased film to the scene.

My main goal was to try and remove all the shakiness and borders of the bad cam I didnâ€™t do to bad for my first encode but it was shaky as hell so removing it all would be a nightmare., after which I blew up the res,brightened,contrast,saturation levels,sharpen,smooth etc.
For the audio I had to resync from the original source as it was of majorly but now nice and lip-sync: D I also boosted the volume :).
For a first encode I thought i did pretty good although I did realize that it was a bit washy but solvable by watching in windowed mode on small res but also pretty watchable full screen..imo this is a first release and there is only so much one can do with a 360p YouTube vid but its a good watch :) so here it is Toy Story -- Hawaiian Vacationâ€V2 :) enjoy
