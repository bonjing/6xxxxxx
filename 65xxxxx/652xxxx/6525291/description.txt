 Siblings Darryl and Trish are on their way home from their freshmen year     
 at college. But the trip starts turning dangerous as they see a man in a     
 trench coat and a hat that covers his face dumping something down a pipe.    
 They recognize him as the man who tried to run them off the road earlier     
 and go see what he dumped after he leaves, but what they discover is too     
 terrifying for them. They get help from a crazy woman who has too many       
 cats and a psychic before they realize what's been chasing them is an        
 ancient demon known as the Creeper who eats people to regenerate his parts   
 and he sees something in one of them that he wants for his snack.
