Dude, we're all the same here, don't think that you're better than anyone.."

BUY THE COMICS!

They're fun to read, and this storyline is crazy good.  But if no one buys them, they won't make them.  I purchased physical copies of every issue, to support the artists.  I'm no better than anyone else, except.....maybe you, psycho."
