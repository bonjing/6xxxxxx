Pyramids mummies & tombs (Discovery Channel).2002.NORDIC.RETAIL.DVDR.PAL-BOOMI


Documentary focusing on the men who stood behind the creation of the pyramids, one of humanity's greatest achievements.

Egypt is far from exclusive to the pyramids, they are everywhere! Pyramids turn up at the most unlikely places in the world. On the island of Java, in the Peruvian desert in China, and even on Iraq's oil fields.

While the pyramids at first glance looks remarkably alike, this is far from the case. We explore the differences in both structure and function, and takes you on an unforgettable journey through the pyramid mystery.
