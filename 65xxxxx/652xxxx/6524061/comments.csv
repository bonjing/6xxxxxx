What would it take for you to upload the whole letterman shows in the future?"
,gizzrdy,2011-07-09T00:43Z,"I do have access to Letterman in HD, but I have no interest capturing whole shows. Also, editing and transcoding a whole show 1080i to 720p would take 3 hours (plus watching the show = 4 hours).
I don't watch these TV shows every day. I just look at the guide and record only the parts I want. Saves time and drive space."
,petter35,2011-07-09T11:58Z,"I understand. What about putting the whole show up in 1080i?
Just have it up for a short time so I can download it.
If you could do that,it would be great.
Or maybee I could ask you about a spesific show with great guest. Like the one with lady gaga? She looked hot in that one.
Thanks for your time."
