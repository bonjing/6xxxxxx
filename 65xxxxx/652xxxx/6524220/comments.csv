,urje69,2011-12-05T22:50Z,"Actually ""Fists Of Fury"" with an ""s"" was the english title release of ""The Big Boss"" in the US.  
""Fist Of Fury"" was released as ""The Chinese Connection"" in the US. 
The same with ""Way of the Dragon"" = ""Return of the Dragon"".

The uploader also put a link to IMDB to show that its ""The Big Boss""/""Fists of Fury"".  

Also, the release date of Fist of Fury - The Chinese Connection was March 22, 1972.
The Big Boss - Fists Of Fury was Oct 3, 1971"
