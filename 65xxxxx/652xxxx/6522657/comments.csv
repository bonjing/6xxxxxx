,hsv4lyf,2011-07-08T05:49Z,"Please seed, we are all stuck at about 76.3%
With the amount of leechers we have got I'm pretty sure most of them will stick around to seed and then we will all have the episode in no time."
,hsv4lyf,2011-07-08T06:13Z,"Thank you so much phorce1, this is why I prefer private trackers, because thy only allow you to upload if you meet their qualifications, just so happens I couldn't get the file from any of the private trackers I am on. Once downloaded i'll be seeding for the next week, once again, thank you."
,haddrick,2011-07-08T11:07Z,How is it now? Don't want to leech if it's not going to help with distribution
,ScaNZ,2011-07-08T12:48Z,"@phorce1 - I thank you for the help, however I didn't appreciate some of your remarks.

I had been looking for this episode for days and finallyfound it on a direct download site. As this torrent did noot exist anywhere I decided to share it with everybody else. 

I have already seeded it to 200% and fully intended to help the others finish as well (as per my previous comment), however I am on a monthly bandwidth cap and couldn't afford to leave it running all night & day unchecked. Really you should be flaming the 'hit & run' leechers rather than someone at least making an effort.

As for the renaming - The file I picked up was named ""SP.S05E12.avi"" so obviously renamed prior to me. All I have done is make it a little more recognisable for others.

Don't push it dude ......"
,matttyger,2011-07-08T20:05Z,"w/e, we've got the file. Thnx for all the effort, all of you!"
