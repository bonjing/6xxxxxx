,kashx5,2011-07-10T19:13Z,@Robin5555- Thanks. And can u tell me the software u use to convert and compress these files ?

If you have dat file extension (video cd) then use vcdgear to change it to mpeg. then use RipBot264 to compressed into Matroska file.You can also use Megui & Its Related S/W to make 350 mb movie file.you can also use Video Watermark Pro for watermarking on your video file. And Removing watermark and Logos use DeLogo virtual dub filter. 

But bear in my friend, it's a  time consuming task, most of the time you find some codec missing. then u must use virtual dub & other related softwares. thnx..    "
