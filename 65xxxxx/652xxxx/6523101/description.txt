It is inspired by a famous and legendary Synthesizer from the 80's, which a lot of talented guys used as their central Keyboard, including some synths Gurus.

Its a piece of history, maybe the last Vintage Analog Polyphonic synthesizer.
It has a special multitimbral mode, 5 different hi quality and hi character filters, as you could expect from a Xils-Lab synth.
It is MORE than a strict emulation.
It has many additional features compared to its glorious ancester, as you could expect from a modern era synthesizer.

This version adds
*Option (Misc) : Layer locked when loaded
*MIDI settings panel label typo.
*Alert pop-up when a layer is read only
*Chorus BBD mode (led ON) : slop time inceased to reduce the noise.
*Synthix logo, Wave form labels, GUI polished.
