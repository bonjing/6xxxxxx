,savagecabbage,2011-07-10T05:08Z,"Nice quality and all, but if you are going to hardcode subtitles in you could at least give us fair warning, it's really annoying having english subs on the film. "
[V],AliBaloch,2011-07-10T07:41Z,savagecabbage its not hardcode subtitles you can off subtitle by using option if you dont know how off subtitle then loll go and ask google to help you
,savagecabbage,2011-07-10T13:32Z,"Ah you are right, in normal wmp the subs didn't go away even after turning them off, after trying it in vlc I can turn them off."
,amarko,2011-07-22T05:37Z,"Wonderful quality for such a reasonable file size. For some reason the movie couldn't play in The KMPlayer (what I generally use), nor in WMP, so for those having a similar problem, VLC Media Player works."
