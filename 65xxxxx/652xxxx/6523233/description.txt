 In 1947, banker Andrew "Andy" Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on strong circumstantial evidence. He is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary in Maine, run by Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). Initially, Andy keeps to himself and doesn't go out of his way to make any acquaitances, but eventually approaches Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence whose parole application was recently rejected around the same time Andy arrives at Shawshank. Red is known for obtaining contraband and Andy asks Red to smuggle a rock hammer into the prison in order to maintain his rock collection hobby, allowing him to create small stone chessmen from rock. It is also during this time Andy is confronted by a gang of cons known as "The Sisters", who subject Andy to a series of sexual assaults.
