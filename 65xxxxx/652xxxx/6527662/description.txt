The singer, known as the Travelling Texan and Masked Singer of Country Songs, was among the first to share a stage with Elvis and last to tour with Hank Williams. He later cheated death on the 1963 plane-flight that took Patsy Cline, Cowboy Copas and Hawkshaw Hawkins when Hawkins gave him a ticket for another plane. Walker had 32 top 10 hits - "Charlie's Shoes" was selected as one of the Top 100 Hot Country Singles of all time. He died at 77 in 2006.
