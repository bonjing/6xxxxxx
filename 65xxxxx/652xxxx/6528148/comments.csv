,micobartek,2011-07-09T23:21Z,use the crack in the previous version...its working
,francolien,2011-07-10T12:26Z,thanks uploader...valid until 25 jan. 2012
,therazor538,2011-07-14T03:06Z,Works great you just need the regular download then click on avast internet secuirty lic.avastlic.
,nishobay,2011-07-19T13:07Z,really good
,CHAOS1972,2011-07-21T02:08Z,"Strange.. 

This install is 75.6mb and the one from the avast site is 76.2mb.

And yes, they are both the same version.
I'll have to test them both."
,mothie,2011-07-30T22:03Z,Licence till?
,Jay_mulley,2011-07-31T08:16Z,@ locobot12 just wanted to let you know that you can just press update program on your avast v6.0.1125 that you uploaded and if you repeat the instructions and copy the same ashbase.dll file over you get the same exp date as before 14/3/2050 with the updated program v6.0.1203.. I have tested this twice on two computers and it works fine.. Just wanted to thank you as well..
,AlanaRusso,2011-08-01T05:40Z,Works great thanks!!
,thejunkboxxx,2011-08-02T03:21Z,"@Jay_mulley, I heard that if we update our program then the old trial trick of upto year 2050 doesn't work because when we connect to internet the trick is detected and the trial license is blocked.
Is that true?"
,Jay_mulley,2011-08-02T05:30Z,@thejunkboxxx well when you click the update it updates and the expire date is changed to only a month but if you goto settings then untick avast self defence module then press ctrl alt delete to goto task manager and stop the program then drag ashbase.dll over to desktop then copy the ashbase.dll file that you get in your previous version from locobot12 then restart you will be upgraded to 2050 licence as before.. this worked on two different computers so far and i successfully upgraded from the v6.0.1125 to v6.0.1203 with the original 2050 expire date and have had no problems at all..
,Jay_mulley,2011-08-02T05:56Z,Basically just follow the install instructions in the previous avast from the uploader... remember i used the crack from v6.0.1125
,makky91,2011-08-06T11:56Z,"Thank you licobot12 ! great uploads!!!

Today i updated my cracked avast v1125 with the official update button in the avast menu, i  received a 1 month version, then i used the crack from the 1125v and now the 1203v works perfectly till 2050. Thanks again!

I have one question: when i run a scan test i get 3 wornings with ashBase, i did the 3 methods you explain in the HOW TO Guide, but still after that i get 2 wornings with ashBase, what can i do?

,Elysiium,2011-08-07T16:20Z,"After downloading, installing and applying the crack my computer (which has been built within the last month) has started encountering the BSoD, and redirecting me to wrong pages when I click on search results on Google. I'm not sure if this torrent is to blame or not. Just thought i'd share my problem
P.S. My system -
CPU: AMD Phenom II X6 1055t
RAM: 2GB DDR3
GPU: ATI HD5450 

Also, I am using a pirated version of Windows 7 x32 could this be the cause of the problem? Any help is much appreciated."
[T],locobot12,2011-08-08T15:45Z,"@Ellysium 

Ur pc is probably Trojan infected and so avast instal must have fucked up!

Download this - http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html

Malwarebytes Antimalware , install , full scan and remove all trojans !

then install avast and perform a scan using avast.

@makky91

,Prisca81Norway,2011-09-01T17:03Z,"@Jay_mulley
I followed your advice (nice short cut!) about using the update button, untick self defense, drag out ashbase.dll, and in with ashbase.dll version 1125.
The neat thing here is that I had version 1000. I just downloaded the 1125 crack and tried. It worked! I didn't have to reinstall or any other tricks. Thank you so much. I am now up to date :)"
,Prisca81Norway,2011-09-01T17:05Z,"Forgot to mention that the point offcourse is Im up to date with expiration date 2050 using your trick. This works on both version 1000 and 1125. Awesome :)
And a big thanks to locobot12 as well. It took me several years to finally find a good IS that Im happy with, and one that is not a resource hog. I love Avast IS."
,Itbankrock,2011-09-11T18:39Z,"Fuckin' A loco! Good Job, works like a charm :D"
,ashginez009,2011-09-13T14:16Z,please create a new crack for avast 6.0.1289 .. tnx locobot in advance !
,rick_nl,2011-09-14T12:18Z,"After updating to the new version 6.0.1289 the Ashbase.dll crack is not working anymore. Applying it results in the Avast application not starting up at all.

For now I had to go with the updated Ashbase.dll with the date of 06/09/2011 - but the subsrcription is back to jan 2012. 

So yes Jay_Mullen or locobot if you have another working crack I'd like a copy as well :)

And in the mean time THANKS for the great work guys!! "
,defjam12,2011-09-16T06:47Z,"@rick_nl

,Prisca81Norway,2011-09-18T17:24Z,"I tried the same with this as I did before, but the ashbase trick didn't work here. I unistalled and installed this program with licence until january. Might as well update the program. Hoping there will be a crack for newest version soon. Thanks in advance."
,ashginez009,2011-09-19T16:16Z,THIS CRACK IS NOT WORKING ANYMORE !!! PERIOD !!!! CRACK IS ALREADY DETECTED !!!

,donx009,2011-09-21T16:43Z,can avast people trace us and perhaps sue us?
,xTc17,2011-09-25T18:45Z,"For anyone having problems replacing Ashbase.dll, install avast, reboot in safe mode, replace the DLL and reboot and your good!"
,msankalpa,2011-10-28T19:15Z,thanks works like a charm..
,ili2882,2012-01-08T16:48Z,"how to patch the easy way
1.Install in trial mode and Reboot (a reboot is a must!)
2. in Settings->troubleshooting disable Avast self-defense module
3. win->Run (or use win key + R button for the Run box) type; ""services.msc"" stop both avast services (avast antivirus and avast firewall)
4. using task manager ctrl+alt+del kill the AvastUI.exe process
5. Replace the dll (I recommend renaming the original dll to AshBase-Orig.dll) copy the patched AshBase.dll to avast install folder
6. using the service manager (see #3) start the avast services (both of them), now start the AvastUI using the Desktop or Start Meny icon

That's it no need for safe mode or a reboot. Tanks for the upload"
,bdman12,2012-05-02T17:18Z,what about avast IS 7.......
