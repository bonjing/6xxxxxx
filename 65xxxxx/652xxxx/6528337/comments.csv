,sendron,2011-07-09T20:46Z,"Pretty bad file..

- No race leadin
- 16:9 format forced into a 4:3 format
- File ends before broadcast finishes

,bloodred125,2011-07-09T21:56Z,fck HD. The files are too big.
,OrderXsoL,2011-07-10T00:19Z,"Quality is absolutely horrible. Not only video quality, but audio as well. Don't download."
,S.B.R,2011-07-10T04:51Z,Terrible quality. Stay away.
,tony4finger,2011-07-10T09:01Z,"quality is fine, format in 16.9 and is perfect , thx"
,metalracket,2011-07-10T10:30Z,Bit upset as picture is poor wide screen squashed into 4:3 ratio and end of broadcast missing. would have this this kind of quality would have only needed 400-500 mb not a gig
,SuperSkyline89,2011-07-10T18:14Z,"Where is all the lead-in and post-qualy stuff? If I just wanted the race I'd watch the shitty coverage on SPEED. The pre and post qualy stuff is the whole point of the BBC coverage.

Next time make it very clear that this IS NOT the proper BBC broadcast. You just wasted like 1.5GB of my monthly bandwidth cap."
