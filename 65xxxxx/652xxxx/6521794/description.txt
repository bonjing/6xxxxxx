I had difficulty finding this fantastic movie, so here it is for you... Please note that the audio is recorded in mono, so you will not be getting the stereo effect. However, I found that this was not a detriment to my viewing pleasure at all. The reason being was that the original file only had audio on the right channel, so I simply copied the same signal over to the left channel. It sounds fine though.
