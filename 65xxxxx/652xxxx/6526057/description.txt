Scheduled Guests
................

From the Infowars web site ::


Alex talks with the executive director of Gun Owners of America, Larry Pratt, about the Mexican gun-running scandal that might bring down the ATF and discredits the accusation by the feds that U.S. gun sellers and the Second Amendment are responsible for the violence in Mexico as banker funded drug cartels slug it out and destabilize the country. Pratt has founded a variety of organizations, including English First, Gun Owners of America, U.S. Border Control, and Committee to Protect the Family. 

Alex talks with Jennifer Jones, a woman forcibly removed from speaking by cops during a Quartzsite, Arizona, city council meeting. 

Prince Leonard and Quanell X speak with Alex about the case in Houston where CPS have seized Mr. Leonard's children. 

Alex also talks with regular Friday guest Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
