,agranel,2011-07-09T19:26Z,thanks
,Robertman20,2011-07-11T01:53Z,Does this one work because the last one i saw ruined my OS... QQ
,Cireagle,2011-07-11T09:20Z,"the release works as it should the only quirk is that it's insistent to install itself on system drive;  (as to the quality of the game - I'll refrain from judgement); to those that may have problems finding out how to switch to full screen, save and other options -- a right click inside the window remedies that ;) ---- also before I forget: my thanks to rjaa for uploading the torrent.- "
,Lulzbat,2011-07-11T14:48Z,"Dont download it, it will fuck your system up and you wont be able you start.

Had to reinstall my os."
,Drake213,2011-07-13T23:35Z,"Made an account specifically to comment on this torrent.

Same experience as Lulzbat and Robertman20.
Had to reinstall OS after hitting autorun caused my computer to instantly blackout, reboot and not be able to get into windows.

I had a mechanical drive previously. but since reinstalling my OS on an SSD, it still crashes but is able to reboot into windows.

Specs:
OS: Windows 7 x64 [ legit, latest updates, etc. ]
CPU: Intel i7 920
RAM: 6 GB Ram
Video card: Nvidia GTX295

Fortunately, Cireagle's comment shows that I'm not missing much :)

But ... If there's anyway around the error, i wouldn't mind giving it a go :]

,Digirati,2011-07-16T10:52Z,Works perfectly Thanks ^^
,Lulzbat,2011-07-20T20:02Z,"@Drake213 it seams the problem lies with this torrent my avast found a couple of viruses inside this one (Might be false positive) whereas it didint find anything inside the one i got from a forum which installed without a fuss.

As for the game its a visual novel if you don't like reading or fapping to underage cartoon girls don't bother to download it.

Gladly i like doing both of those."
,osriccc,2011-07-26T07:40Z,"Shit, I wanted to play this so much. Years not playing any visual novels. Anyway, I'll pass until there's a safe download...or a new game."
,swthrxos,2011-07-27T14:03Z,"i dont see any dialogue in the game at all,what should i do???(my language is set in english)"
,Dark_Walker,2011-07-30T07:18Z,So is this safe to install or not?
,Dark_Walker,2011-07-31T07:30Z,"Don't bother with this one, it's not cracked. You need a code for software defender."
,amyasleigh,2011-09-10T03:33Z,Worked Great! don't know why people had to reinstall their OS.. that's weird. Oh and the crack comes with the dl on your cd or vcd under the directory fasiso. just copy/paste it into demonbane dir. easy enough. Oh and thanks!
,supersaiyandoyle,2012-04-21T05:38Z,Anyone know if this thing still causes the user to need to reinstall their OS?
