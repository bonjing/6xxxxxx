[V],neon,2011-07-10T19:36Z,@flashhhh ...yes
,flashhhh,2011-07-11T07:21Z,that cool !! why ur all releases are above 2 gigs in size while resolution is still 720p ? i have seen 1080p releases in the size ur 720 p are. So should not be 720 less than 2 gigs ?
[V],neon,2011-07-11T18:32Z,flashhhh i would say most 720p torrents are over 2GB ..... http://thepiratebay.org/search/720p%20brrip/0/99/200

First it counts the length of the movie !!

2 hours it's not the same with 4 hours !!

Than, he bigger is the bitrate the bigger the output  file will be and the quality would be better [with the right settings !!]  !!! [Check also the Quality factor(QF)=Bits/(Pixel*Frame) that also should be the biggest possible after compression]

Sometimes it's possible to get more than average BRRip with less bitrate/filesize/QF !!!

So, not all BRRips or BluRay rips are over 2Gb!!

But for the movies over 3 hours you just can't get the true quality under 2gb output filesize !!

Pay attention also to audio bitrate[it means audio quality!] !!!

Cheers."

,enonumus,2012-03-15T00:17Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!  There's a major frame rate issue from roughly 2:22:00 to about 2:28:00.  Very strange, it's similar to a 29.97FPS video that's been encoded to 23.976, but it only happens during that 6 minute time period from what I can tell (I've spot checked the whole movie pretty thoroughly but haven't watched every second of it).  This is definitely NOT an issue with my system, and it consistently happens only during that segment.    There are plenty of other high-def torrents available, just grab another one.  It's a shame because otherwise the audio/video quality is good, and it contains properly sync'd English subs for the Indian parts, unlike some other torrents.  "
