No, trial-resetters don't extract any viruses to your temp folder, trial-resetters just edit your Kaspersky product's registry by reseting it back to 30 days. Of course it depends on what trial resetter you are using. The best trial-resetter for Kaspersky 2012 for now is Ganjin's trial-resetter (in my opinion) , it's the most comfortable trial-resetter. If you are not sure then you can always delete all files from your Temp folder by clicking ""Start"" - ""Run"" , entering ""%Temp%"" & clicking ""Enter"" on your clipboard and deleting all files that you see in that folder, or just scanning that folder for viruses. In my opinion trial versions of any Kaspersky products don't have fully functionality just because purchased (activated) versions are fully updated with all advanced virus definitions that give information to Kaspersky product of how to fight against different types of viruses, trojans, malware, spyware etc &  trial versions are updated just with standard, most important virus definitions that will give you optimal protection instead of advanced protection.
I hope it will help you. :) So, enjoy TPB & RESPECT h4ck3r2012, because he is doing well. ;)"
