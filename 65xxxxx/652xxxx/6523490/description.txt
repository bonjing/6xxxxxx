Moom allows you to easily move and zoom windows to predefined areas of the screen, or to make them full-screen, using either the mouse or the keyboard.

When used via the mouse, all you need to do is hover over the green resize button in any Mac OS X window. Moom's panel appears, and you then click the desired action.

When used via the keyboard, a hot key displays the Moom bezel, and you can then use the arrow and modifier keys to move and resize the windows.

What's New:

New Features:

* New 'Save Window Layout Snapshot' menu item allows quick creation
  of saved window layouts.

Bug Fixes and Improvements:

* Grow and Shrink via keyboard now repeat when you hold the assigned
  keys down. (Hat tip to Sherman W. for the suggestion.)

* Fixed a bug with the Shrink keyboard command.

* The Settings window will now properly appear on the active Space.
  (Hat tip to Jacob D. for finding this one.)

* The Arrange Windows Custom Control now always remembers all
  windows. The 'Ignore obstructed windows' checkbox now applies when
  you activate a saved layout, so you can choose between affecting those
  windows and not affecting those windows.

System Requirements:

Intel Mac OS X.6 or later
