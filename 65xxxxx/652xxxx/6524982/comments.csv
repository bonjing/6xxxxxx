,kuhas,2011-07-17T17:50Z,Rar files 62-67 are bad. Don't download. Waste of time.
,megahurts_gr,2011-07-25T19:07Z,"I confirm what kuhas wrote above: the torrent contains 98 RAR files that are 15,000,000 bytes each, except for the following files:

Brazil.1985.BRRIP.Xvid.AC3.CrEwSaDe.part062.rar 9,879,552 bytes
Brazil.1985.BRRIP.Xvid.AC3.CrEwSaDe.part063.rar 3,047,424 bytes
Brazil.1985.BRRIP.Xvid.AC3.CrEwSaDe.part064.rar 278,528 bytes
Brazil.1985.BRRIP.Xvid.AC3.CrEwSaDe.part065.rar 0 bytes
Brazil.1985.BRRIP.Xvid.AC3.CrEwSaDe.part067.rar 704,512 bytes

Of course, WinRAR finds these files to be corrupt.

I tried re-downloading them and I got the same, so the problem appears to be baked in the torrent."
