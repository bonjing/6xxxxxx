,Dantheman420,2011-07-19T01:46Z,"... i was in the middle of writing a comment to this, and it was already finished dloading. looks good, for how small it is, its definately better than ANY cam or TS ive seen, but its not DVD quality

if u have anything bigger than a 17inch monitor, wait it out, but if u have ipod or a smaller DVD player, li9ke a portable one, its perfect"
,mokoloko14,2011-07-19T02:54Z,"ILPruny, you'r kind of a genius. tanks"
,magi123,2011-07-19T02:58Z,"Fast download, but not the quality I expected. Thank you anyway."
,Matak12,2011-07-19T15:16Z,This is the best quality xmen first class on here and better than the extremezone version if you guys want to download a 1gb version be my guest but those on limited plans should get this trust me much better than a cam
,irj2,2011-07-20T16:51Z,"I guess I am gulity of not commenting and not saying thanks, as much as I should, but in this instance, I just had to say a big thanks to ""ILPruny"" as  this torrent is just amazing. The file is soo small, yet contains a film of over 2 hours in very good quality. Brilliant! "
,heheporn,2011-07-20T23:46Z,"Not a dvdrip !!
CAM"
,lecoyle,2011-07-20T23:46Z,"This really is an amazing torrent.  The file size in tiny and the quality is amazing.  It downloaded in about 2 minutes and looked great when played (via my Tivo) on my 52"" tv.  For a film that's still in theaters it doesn't get any better than this."
,lozory,2011-07-24T11:37Z,"@heheporn its not a cam dumbass
very impressive rip i dunno why you made it so small tho, the vid is only 8.5 or 9/10, coulda been perfect if it was just a bit bigger like 500mb even!
o well pretty impressive anyway good for an iphone & watchable on a tv i guess:)"
