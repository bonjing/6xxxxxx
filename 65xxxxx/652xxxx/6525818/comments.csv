,bobbysg,2011-07-09T22:11Z,"Dude, ericwg, nobody has your african cats.  Don't be an asshole.  You're the one posting comments about it on every torrent.  It's annoying.  Nobody gives a shit about your movie choices, or that you have kids.  They are annoyed that you are begging for this movie on every single torrent.

Obviously, nobody has a cam of the movie.  If someone had a cam, it would have been posted two months ago.  The movie isn't in any theaters at this point, so there won't be a new cam.  The DVD is due out in October, so you'll probably get something in September.  Your kids will have to wait (and you don't want to show your kids a cam-rip documentary, anyway)."

,train_wreq,2011-08-02T13:00Z,"shitty movie. it was funny when Billy Boy Thorton played a similar role in Bad Santa, but Cameron Diaz doing it is annoying and mediocre. Her 'bad girl' dialog is also kinda cheesy. Some laughs but very few.

a-6/10
