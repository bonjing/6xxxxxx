You sack of shit. In your logic then, Super Mario is a shit game. That didn't even need 512kB of RAM.

It's about GAMEPLAY. Not fucking graphics you mank. This particular game is also about creativity, not just mindlessly shooting people for hours like you would in COD.

Bad video card drivers!      
      -----------------------      

Minecraft was unable to start because it failed to find an accelerated OpenGL mode.
This can usually be fixed by updating the video card drivers.
