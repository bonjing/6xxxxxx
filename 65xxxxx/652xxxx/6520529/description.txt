How the Earth Was Made Complete Season 1
HISTORY" reveals the 4.5 billion-year journey of our home. Spectacular on-location footage, evidence from geologists in the field, and clear, dramatic graphics combine in this stunning 13-part series to show how immensely powerful, and at times violent, forces of geology have formed our planet. 

From the Great Lakes to Iceland, the San Andreas Fault to Krakatoa, How The Earth Was Made travels the globe to reveal the physical processes that have shaped some of the most well-known locations and geological phenomena in the world. With rocks as their clues and volcanoes, ice sheets, and colliding continents as their suspects, scientists launch a forensic investigation that will help viewers visualise how the earth has evolved and formed over millions of years.


1)  San Andreas Fault 
The San Andreas Fault runs 800 miles through some of the most valuable real estate in the world. Through the southern section hasn't had a significant quake for over 300 years, recent warnings have Los Angeles primed for a destructive quake that could wreak havoc on the city.

2)  The Deepest Place on Earth 
Lying seven miles below the surface of the sea, the Marianas Trench is the deepest place on Earth. Investigate the mystery of this strange underwater abyss, where a world of fiery mountains, bizarre marine mud volcanoes, and devastating tsunamis reveal how the deepest scar on Earth's crust was created

3)  Krakatoa 
The 1883 eruption of the Krakatoa volcano unleashed an explosion that was heard mroe than 2,000 miles away, and triggered a giant 100-foot tsunami that wiped out more than 36,000 people. What made this corner of our planet so dangerous, and could another catastrophic eruption be on the way?

4)  Lock Ness 
Home to the legend of the Loch Ness monster, this lake holds more water than any other lake in Britain. It's only 10,000 years old, but billions of years in the making. Trace the lake's extraordinary history and find out if the famed monster could really have survived in its murky waters.

5)  New York 
Built on the remains of mountains that 450 million years ago were as tall as the Himalayas, New York is one of the most man-made spaces on the planet. Learn how everything about it--from the height of its skyscrapers to the position of its harbour--is governed by the amazing forces that shaped it.

6)  Driest Place on Earth 
Since human records of the area began, some places in the Atacama Desert have never received rain; yet strange bacteria have been discovered living there. Look into the riddle of this South American desert to discover how this extraordinarily dry landscape was created.

7)  Great Lakes 
The Great Lakes of North America are the largest expanses of fresh water on the planet. As the lakes settle to their current levels, geologists delve deep in search for clues of their formation, discovering that the Great Lakes' evolutions are far from over.

8)  Yellowstone 
This National Park houses one of the most dangerous geological features on Earth, a hidden super-volcano overdue for a massive eruption. In the past 16.5 million years, the volcano has mysteriously moved hundreds of miles to its present, and active, location. Is this sleeping giant beginning to stir?

9)  Tsunami 
Tsunamis are one of the most terrifying forces of nature, destroying all in their path. The December 26th tsunami in 2004 is estimated to have released energy equal to that of 23,000 Hiroshima-type atomic bombs. What are the enormous forces that generate these catastrophic waves deep on the ocean floor?

10)  Asteroids 
Until recently geologists could find no evidence that asteroids had actually struck the earth. See both the immense riches now known to be the result of these giant boulders from space, and the decimation their violent impacts had on the first people to live in America.

11)  Iceland 
The largest and most fearsome volcanic island on the planet, Iceland is being ripped apart by powerful forces lighting its fiery volcanoes. Could these volcanoes cause climatic chaos and devastation across the planet?

12)  Hawaii 
Emerging from the centre of the Pacific Ocean, the origins of the Hawaiian islands have remained a puzzle for generations. See what clues their history of raging volcanoes, vast landslides, and mega-tsunamis might hold about the inner workings of our planet.

13)  The Alps 
Spanning seven countries, the Alps are Europe's most important natural landmark. But how did marine fossils get there, seven thousand feet above sea level? A team of investigators attempts to understand how the Alps evolved, and how long they will be around.
