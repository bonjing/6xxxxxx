The Secret of the Holy Grail in France [documentary]

description: Maybe you've seen Indiana Jones 3 - The Last Crusade. This isn't just fiction - the holy Grail truly exists. Watch this and get the true chance to become a real-life Indiana Jones. But maybe this quest for the holy Grail also reflects the externalization of an inner spiritual quest, a guest for the one and only GOD, your heavenly Father. There's more between heaven and earth than you could possibly have imagined in your wildest dreams. If you think your life is boring then that's just your imagined state of mind - nothing is boring here on this earth but your own mind. Watch this exciting documentary and tell your friends about it - those who are open-minded and ready for it.
