,stopngo,2011-07-21T02:49Z,My wife will thank you for this. Speeds are extremely slow though and only 1 seed. I hope you hang in there long enough for some folks to finish. At this rate it will be a long time. I will seed for as long as you're having to if I can finish.
,kiasu1,2011-07-25T06:24Z,ZERO SEEDERS. 100+ of us are stuck with no complete copies seen.
,kiasu1,2011-07-25T06:26Z,And its only been up for 14 days....hmmmm
,BarbM,2011-07-27T02:03Z,"I agree with you kiasu1, many people out there who would like this treasure and yet no seeders.
It appears that the 6 who snatched it have gone to other private sites where we do not have the ability to access them. I have added even more trackers into uTorrent, yet not one of them has a seeder.
If you are going to upload such huge files, at least plan to keep going for quite a long period of time.
I belong to a torrent site where ratio counts, and I have over time uploaded 460Gb and leeched 160Gb. I seed, and that appears to be something no one else has learned to do."
,stopngo,2011-08-01T02:52Z,"I have added every tracker I can find for this torrent as well. It's showing 200 leech and 3 seeds, but I can't ever seem to get on any of the seeds. Everyone I'm connected to has the same % done as I do or less. Please rosie1966 seed some more. We really do appreciate you uploading this but give us another 2 weeks of seeding so that more seeds can be created."
,kiasu1,2011-08-01T16:32Z,Sorry everyone...I have no complete episodes and with the uploader doing a runner I am going to stop sharing and delete my torrent and incomplete files. Unbelievable this uploader did not share this hard to find and (by the looks of the file sizes) a good quality rip longer as with no seeds it is useless to everyone. 
,JHD1995,2011-08-07T23:27Z,"This torrent is clearly on alot of people's list. It's been up for less than 1 month now and it has nearly 200 peers to 5 seeders - there's about 10 peers who have about 60% of the files. Let's hope they seed.

Thanks a lot uploader :)"
,BarbM,2011-08-09T08:16Z,"I am now getting it from another source (at demonoid) but take NOTE season 8 on the version 2 over there is completely different to version 1.0 here.
I am trying to grab as much as possible and seed this older torrent as well as grabbing more from the new one.
I don't even know if it will work but I can try.
I am also playing with a lousy upload speed, so please hang in there I am doing the best that I can for one and all.
It is stopped occasionally so that I can get one to recognise the other, with exception to season 8 as that is way out of order.
All the best "
,BarbM,2011-08-11T03:33Z,"For those wanting to save all they have already downloaded, seasons 1 through to and including season 7, and season 9 are ALL correct.
Season 8 will require a change as follows.
From this alteration, selecting Demonoids The Walton's Version 2.0 from the user named Pixels will get you all of these completed.
The following information comes from a Demonoid member who took the time to correct all of Season 8 so any losses are minimal.

I can then assist those needing this file and the others, as I now at 73% approx, with Seasons 1 and 2 completed.

If you don't wish to do this, that is okay too but I will not be able to assist you with Season 8."
,stopngo,2011-08-12T23:28Z,Do you have a link to the changed torrent with the season 8 changes? I've made the corrections as you've suggested and I've told this existing torrent not to download those files.
,BarbM,2011-08-13T03:34Z,"
/files/details/2708284/00549322300/

Sorry I didn't get back sooner or to add it at the time of posting the comment, as Demonoid were doing something I couldn't get in to any torrent file to copy the link.
Now I am getting a database error trying to post the link in here."
,BarbM,2011-08-13T03:36Z,"So that's how they want to play it?

now put in front of the above link the following...

http://world wide web dot demonoid dot me"
,BarbM,2011-08-14T01:34Z,"OK all, got 100% on Seasons 1 to 7 and 9, NO season 8 as it is different from this file. 
All Seasons except 8 is identical to the demonoid file.
Follow my directions for demonoid if you want that one too.
I am a lone seeder here so be patient as my upload speed is not great, nor is the size of my PC large to flog it death with seeding. May have to reboot frequently to keep it going for you. 
If the weather turns bad, hang in there, DO NOT turn off because I will come back to seed.
Thanks for your patience one and all, it is appreciated.
Cheers"
,rosie1966,2011-08-14T12:46Z,"I will seed this to completion.

But remember I cannot seed 24/7 so please help each other and if you are a true pirate make sure you seed to a ratio of at least 1 : 1.

Then this torrent will never die!!

Take care
Rosie xxxx"
,BarbM,2011-08-14T22:33Z,"Thanks Rosie, I have discovered no seeds on version 2.0 on Demonoid so I am going to alternate between downloads, a day or two on one and a day or two on the other.
I can do this until my monthly Gb upload is all but gone. I have used over 50% of my upload quota for the month, and 80% of my download quota, and I still have 75% of my days left. Inn fact I am in red!
Will do my best on both versions before I run out.
Thanks once again Rosie.
BarbM"
,useitright,2011-10-04T18:57Z,I have never even heard of having a limited upload or download rate.  I am going to forgo even starting this because it has not one seed and that is pathetic.  It was probably wishful thinking to be able to get something this old on here anyway.  The fact that I even found this amazed me.  Good job on trying to upload a great show but it seems there are not enough fans on here to keep it alive.  Thank you anyway!
[V],neil1966hardy,2011-10-18T00:57Z,"Version 2 of this torrent can be found here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6751606/The_Waltons_-_The_Complete_Collector_s_Edition

Revision changes: Added extra's and fixed season 8 naming.


If you are using utorrent as your client then simply save v2 to same file location as this torrent to resume your download from v 1."
[V],neil1966hardy,2011-10-18T01:00Z,"Damn, I forget to say all respect and dues to Pixels for originally uploading this and v2 on demonoid.

Hope you can show your appreciation by seeding to at least 1 : 1 ratio.

Take care
Neil"
