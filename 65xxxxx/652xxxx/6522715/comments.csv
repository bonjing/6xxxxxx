,axemblack,2011-07-21T14:17Z,"@billyunl clearly you know nothing about encoding. AVI is an old format. MP4 and MKV are superior and are the future. Convert it to AVI yourself, ungrateful tit."

,ven1x,2011-08-12T21:36Z,"audio is not that great, its ok on crappy speakers but not that great on anything else. Thats a thing with a lot of KICKASS's releases...but hey, for that size...would be great tho if you could provide better audio.
