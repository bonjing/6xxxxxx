,z-nith,2011-07-10T00:04Z,"Hey Mr. Eighties, thanks again for continuing this series. I look forward to checking out no.53, as I've enjoyed all the others! Sadly I had my laptop stolen and only had about half the torrents backed up..time to try re-DLing em! =\"

,tkm0718,2011-07-10T20:42Z,"Oh boy, Christmas in July ... another RHOTE!     Thank you!!!"
[V],80zforever,2011-07-10T20:59Z,"Hey Simon, sorry don't have it. I have come across the vinyl once or twice but for some reason never went for it. Also thank you all guys for commenting. By the way do you hear what sounds like a 'hidden' Classix Nouveaux song on this mix? lol"
,braniacfive,2011-07-11T04:14Z,"I've got that Sherry Kean extended single here. A great listening experience. You've really got the touch for picking out the atmospheric stuff.

Is there something different about Volumes 5 through 9? They don't seem to ever connect."
[V],80zforever,2011-07-11T08:10Z,"braniacfive, thx for the comment. I am glad you liked these. Now I don't know why those volumes would not start, but I will re-post them tonight hopefully. thx"

,22ndWave,2011-07-16T21:12Z,"Nice selection. A standout for me was ""Under The Sun"" by Rockets. A very cool track. I was wondering if you ever found ""Walk away"" by Roaring Boys. any luck?"
,alejandro70,2011-07-17T23:58Z,GRACIAS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[V],80zforever,2011-07-18T02:45Z,"22ndwave, found the single and cleaned it, however it does jump a few times so not good to be posted. I am trying to see if i ever made an mp3 of it. i need to check a few hds."
