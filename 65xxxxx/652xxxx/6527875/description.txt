Harris Eisenstadt wrote all the compositions on The Soul and Gone, and he
recruited a fine band of musicians who never cease to make the music
amazing. All of the players have consistently created monuments of aural
splendour. This time out is no exception. There is a constant shift of emphasis
and shade, subtlety and emphasis, momentum balanced with reflection.

In the midst of all this comes the blowing "Koala #2 (Reduction), which has
several factors going for it. Jason Mears lopes in on the alto sax, casting a
sturdy path that dazzles in its swift change of direction and the switch of pace
and enunciation. Jeb Bishop's trombone is an articulate messenger in finding
intriguing nooks. Jeff Parker's guitar beckons with its melodic fervour. At the
bottom of it all is Jason Roebke, his bass a stimulus with its varied pulse and
interplay.

The take on "And A Hard Place is free expression skittering in on Eisenstadt's
drumming. Sound jiggles and dances before the horns stomp in. Which way will
they band now go? Will there be meter and time? Will the beat be paced
uniformly? The answer comes from Bishop, now playing a melody that has body and
shape. This sparks off a looser ambit from Mears, who soon gears the shift into
harder terrain. It is all conceptualized logically enough, the different strands
finally forming a pulsating whole.

"Three Breaths comes with greater latitude in freedom. Mears and Bishop get
involved in quirky structures, countenancing each other with short jabs and
curlicues. They bring in an equilibrium but that soon dissipates as the others
take their own strands of thought, seemingly in different directions before
finding the apex.

The road to discovery is a constant adventure, making The Soul and Gone a
stimulating record.
