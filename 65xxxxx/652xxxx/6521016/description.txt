Groundwater Science by Charles R. Fitts

Review
"The writing and presentation is clear and economical. The figures have a crisp and uncluttered look to them. Fitts stresses concepts over formal development....a fine textbook."
-Roger Beckie, Univ. British Columbia, for VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL, 2003

"Groundwater Science would serve well as the text for an introductory groundwater course...The graphics are crisp and explanatory. Data sets needed to work some of the problems in the book are available as text files from the book's Web Site...I found these files to be complete and easy to understand. The references are up to date...concise, well-written, and well-illustrated..."
-Sean A. McKenna, Sanda National Labs, EOS TRANSACTIONS, July 2003

"Groundwater Science is presented in a clear, logical manner, with attractive, effective typeset, and crisp diagrams...I strongly endorse this book for those entering the world of groundwater science for the first time."
-David Sharpe, Geological Survey of Canada
