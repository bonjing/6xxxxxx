All credit for these programs goes to those who made them, I simply put them all together in one package so that the community doesn't have to go looking for them all at once. 

Please seed as much as possible for as long as possible. Don't download the file and run, that just isn't fair to the community. SEED! If there are no seeders, send me a PM and I will begin seeding again.

If there are missing files, that means your antivirus program detected the keygen's and/or cracks and deleted them. Check the quarantine list in your antivirus program to restore them, or turn your antivirus off while downloading. I know this sounds risky, but like I stated earlier, if you don't trust it - don't download it. Simple as that. 

Thank you to all those who took the time to make these programs, this wouldn't have been possible without you.
