,btbam006,2011-07-08T06:51Z,"Looks like a great set, just in time for my birthday :) Thanks WMI!

I could completely understand too not wanting to pay for these anymore, it just seems sometimes that it's the same thing over and over. You have done a great thing for the time being though and I am sure you know a ton of us appreciate it more than words can describe."
,33wearhilton41,2011-07-08T06:52Z,good one wmi a bit of tit!what next?
[T],webmodelsindex,2011-07-08T07:10Z,"I have another project I'm currently working on, so I'll let DigieraMandela do a resize version. Since he's so great at it :)"
,captainkhaos1966,2011-07-08T07:13Z,Thanks WMI
,ellafan,2011-07-08T07:18Z,I hope you don't stop posting them anytime soon as nobody else seems to want to take your place. I also think your doing great work. Keep it up!
,ellafan,2011-07-08T07:23Z,Is DigieraMandela downloading them as well or just downloading yours and re-sizing them?
[T],webmodelsindex,2011-07-08T07:26Z,"It's $35 a month, which I don't make back. It's being promoted on the wmi site, but with no affiliate tied to it, it makes $0 in return. There is a donate button thrown up on the site, which uses paypal. I know some of you had offered to donate in the past, so if you're still up to it, go for it. Don't need to donate much. A few bucks from some of you would help, and it will continue to bring you sets.

I'm not saying you HAVE to donate or I'll stop uploading. I still haven't decided whether or not I'm going to stop, and more than likely I won't. Just saying it would be great if you guys wanna help out."
[T],webmodelsindex,2011-07-08T07:28Z,"@ellafan

I think he downloads from me, then resizes and uploads them for all of you. Not sure if he has a membership or not. All I know is that he doesn't post his resizes until my torrents have 100's of seeds. Either way, he does a great service. I know a lot of people don't like the large file sizes."
,Oldtimerxoxo,2011-07-08T08:10Z,"Great job WMI, and about your comment wellcome to my world. +1"
[T],webmodelsindex,2011-07-08T09:43Z,"Looks like we got a donation. Will be renewing the membership, and 1 more month of FG sets."
,waftycranker,2011-07-08T12:34Z,"Instead of resizing use VLC to batchconvert to Jpeg at 60% takes 2 minutes. The pictures stay the same size and quality, this 424mb becomes 99mb."
,Procrasturbate,2011-07-08T12:56Z,"why the hell are you paying for it anyway. you can download these off of perved , com every m/w/f morning too. for FREE. the only reason i come here is you give us a preview of the week to come. Seriously folks. stop paying for sh!t online. "
,cult22,2011-07-08T15:38Z,webmodelsindex you do a great job if you do something else in a another site or a new project let us know .
,Chisinau_Moldova,2011-07-08T23:10Z,"Thanks WMI,great appreciation for your work,if we all donate even just $1 dollar it will work sure;y?"
,slee2099,2011-07-09T00:28Z, Thanks WMI I was looking at next weeks set preview and all I can say is I never thought I'd be jealous of a magic marker.
