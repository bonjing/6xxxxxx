John Smith Hurt, better known as Mississippi John Hurt (July 3, 1893[1][2] or March 8, 1892[3] â€” November 2, 1966) was an influential country blues singer and guitarist.[4] Raised in the tiny Avalon, Mississippi, Hurt taught himself how to play the guitar around age nine. Singing in a loud whisper, to a melodious finger-picked accompaniment,[5] he began to play local dances and parties while working as a sharecropper. He first recorded for Okeh Records in 1928.
