 Brazil provides an interesting blend of the customs and lifestyles of the many groups of people that have settled in this large and friendly country. It is also a nation of many contrasts. The Brazilian flag, for example, contains the slogan â€œordem e progresso,â€ which means â€œorder and progress.â€ In reality, most Brazilians, who are highly individualistic, resent excessive order and are opposed to too many rules and regulations. They are also quite unhappy that more economic progress has not been made rapidly. Although the Brazilian national anthem refers to the nation as the â€œland of the future,â€ yet most Brazilians actually place a greater emphasis on the present than the years to come. Brazil is a country from which much can be learned.
