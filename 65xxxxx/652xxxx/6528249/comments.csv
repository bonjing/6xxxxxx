,OnBlast,2011-07-10T00:46Z,Sets location for download into my PC incorrectly  ... usually one sign that this is a Bullshit torrent.
,Glennsmovies,2011-07-10T04:18Z,Onblast ....your full of shit ...how many movies have you got on here why should i trust YOU 
,agarath66,2011-07-10T05:30Z,I don;t think OnBlast knows what they are talking about. The torrent loads exactly where I have set the downloads to go to in my bit torrent client settings. (That's a hint OnBlast)
,magooze760,2011-07-11T10:32Z,sometimes when you select a new place for a download you have to change it back when you download something else. that might be your problem. Good movie though.

Dont have much to do with Hero tho :)"
,BobZombiE69,2011-07-21T18:57Z,"I guess it's a not real  HDRip , AC3 audio is poor , Video quality is not perfect and framerate has problem too , from the middle of movie i had sync problem in my WesternDigital HD player"
,d-LoiX,2011-07-24T03:24Z,"Very bad quality, I downloaded another."
