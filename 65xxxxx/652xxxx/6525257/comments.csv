Restarted it, it appears to be a Russian version of Password Remover. [I got an english one that did not like my PC] This worked perfectly. Thanks for the Up rjaa your a genius! :)"
,2soos2,2011-09-25T15:46Z,"Vista Premium, I burned the image to a disc, booted from CD, and got a bunch of Russian-looking gibberish. I figured that it's probably some bullshit virus, but then I waited, and the GUI loaded and told me what to do. If there's one word to describe it, it's:  WICKED!! Thank you rjaa. =D Wicked!"
