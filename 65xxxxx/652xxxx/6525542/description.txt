I have taken the best copy of this film and formated it into an easy to burn DVD. I can't stand watching movies on my computer and I'm sure there are many here who feel the same. All you have to do is download the file and burn it straight to DVD using Imgburn. I will fit on one single layer DVD. The English subtitles are hardcoded, picture quality is beautiful. Enjoy.
