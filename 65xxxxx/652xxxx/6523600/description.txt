From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with Mike Adams of Natural News about the FDA's new scheme for outlawing nearly all nutritional supplements formulated after October, 1994. The FDA scheme to place a huge burden of research and paperwork on every dietary supplement company in the United States will create a bureaucratic nightmare and likely force many supplement companies out of business. Adams is the founder of NaturalNews.com, an online news source. Mike has also founded a non-profit organization, The Consumer Wellness Center, an online retail center, Better Life Goods, and a publishing company, Truth Publishing.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
