Pedro the Lion - It's Hard to Find a Friend (1998)(FLAC)









Pedro the Lion was an indie rock band from Seattle, Washington. Formed by singer-songwriter David Bazan in 1995, he represented the main creative force of the band, backed by a rotation of various collaborating musicians. T. W. Walsh is considered to be the sole official band member besides Bazan. In 2006, Bazan and Walsh split amicably and Pedro the Lion was dissolved as Bazan went solo. Releasing four full-length albums and five EPs over 11 years, the band was known for its first person narrative lyrics with political and religious themes. Pedro The Lion was managed by Bob Andrews at Undertow Music Collective.

Review from AllMusic.com

by David Dwyer

Pedro the Lion's Dave Bazan is an observant Christian who wears his sins on his sleeve. Still, there's a sweetness about his outlook and journey on It's Hard to Find a Friend. The songs offer nice detail: he finds his girlfriend has ticket stubs to a movie she saw with someone, but not him; and he wishes he could become the disciplined person a friend is "for a few habit-forming years." There's some real grace and poetry in the lyrics, and the music is spare, simple, and hypnotic. Bazan seems to be a musical hybrid of Moe Tucker and Daniel Johnston, with a dash of Brian Wilson ("The Longer I Lay Here") and Popol Vuh ("The Bells"). A brotherly gem.
