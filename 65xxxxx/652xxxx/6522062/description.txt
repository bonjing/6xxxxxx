Exotic surf destinations, beautiful women, and the thirst to enjoy life are things that have inspired the Reef brand since 1984. Reef's team of professional surfers live this lifestyle and they have sent them off to document this Reef experience first hand.

The result is a full-length surfing film titled Cancer to Capricorn: The Path of the Modern Gypsy.

The cast of modern gypsies features Mick Fanning, Rob Machado, Tonino Benson, Ben Bourgeois, Mike Losness and many more. New Reef team rider, Alana Blanchard, will also make some cameos, as well as Miss Reef. The film is directed and edited by Russell Brownley, a talented new face within the world of surf cinematography.

Cancer to Capricorn: The Path of the Modern Gypsy was shot exclusively around locations that fall within the Tropic of Cancer & the Tropic of Capricorn. With the help of Surflineâ€™s staff of surf forecasters, Reef was able to pin point the best time to send out a team of athletes to score what is considered to be surfing perfection.
