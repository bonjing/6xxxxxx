Kanshin is a two CD compilation album
that presents a collection of sound
design work from some of the sceneÃ†s
finest artists from across the globe. It
has been put together to raise money for
the current recovery in Japan following
MarchÃ†s earthquake.

As the sensationalist media broadcasters
find other things to talk about in the
news, a huge recovery operation is still
on-going as we speak. Many people have
lost everything. So we decided to put
together Kanshin so that via Ian
Hawgood, 100% of profit from compilation
sales will go directly towards the Japan
recovery and on-going relief efforts.
Ian lives in Japan and his wife is
currently working with both the Japan
Earthquake Animal Rescue and Support
organisation (JEARS) in Sendai and
surrounding areas, as well as the Direct
Help for Victims and Animals Rejected
from Shelters in Japan group who are
going up to areas which are not
receiving government support for food,
water, basic supplies, as well as
rebuilding and cleaning up. By this
means they are able to transport food,
clothing and aid directly almost every
other weekend and during holidays to
areas which are not getting enough or
any support. IanÃ†s wife has also
arranged a house as a base in Sendai for
volunteers and a temporary home for
found animals who are then moved on
through JEARS either to foster homes or
animal centres. We felt that any funds
we can send this way would probably have
more of an immediate impact than
donating via one of the larger UK
charities.

Ian himself has contributed to the
compilation in a collaboration with
Peter JÂ°rgensen and through 3 hours and
some 30 tracks, the line up that
comprises this album is surely as
exciting as it getsÃ 

Kanshin is curated by Daniel Crossley
(Fluid Radio/Fluid Audio/Facture) and
Jonathan Lees (Hibernate/Rural Colours),
with invaluable assistance from Ian
Hazeldine (Cover art), Wil Bolton
(Mastering) and Damian Valles (Digital
distribution). This release is made
possible by the generosity of all of the
artists involved.
