enjoy ..."
[V],globeplus,2011-07-09T14:11Z,"SUGGESTION :

save often and in more than 1 slot to prevent circunstancial bug position places at the saving time , then with more than 1 save more or less close on the position on the level if 1 save can have any ununexpected problem it is just a matter to use another save close by from the current playing position ...

Take care and enjoy ... i am not saying this because it is some real problem on any of the levels but for general safety while playing the levels . See all of you ."
[V],globeplus,2011-07-09T14:19Z,"CURIOSITY ABOUT THE WORK ON THIS FILE :

The file that is getted for 45 mb have after the decompression of the Data and the Audio 205 mb , so this type of files with the correct work can got fantastic compressions sizes ... enjoy ."
,glynn5500,2011-07-09T14:55Z,im running xp proffessional 32 bit (sp3) and everytime i start the game it comes up .. encounterd a problem and send error report ! any ideas my freind ! 
,glynn5500,2011-07-09T14:58Z,oh and yes all my drivers r all upto date m8 
,xplor3r,2011-07-09T17:31Z,"hello globe 


- i have downloaded this just for curiosity and my opinion is that is too complicated ( ur work i mean ) ... why not create an exe installer and after pressing install or somethin' ... it would unrar all the files from the .exe into a temp file , for example %temp% ... that is included on any windows ( xp/vista/7 ) , and from there to begin the process ( install or decompress the files ) ... also you could add 'xyz' variables to the setup to delete the temp files or create a command line into a .bat or .cmd file 

- about the 'SkribblerzStonez2' there are 3 one's , only different versions of 'SkribblerzStonez2' .. with different maps ... anyway great work


- for audio files you could use 'madplay' , it has only 2 .exe's , i mean 'start_me.exe' and 'madplay' and whenever u hit start_me.exe ( meaning u have also some .mp3's inside that folder , it will auto convert them into .wav's )

- as for the the 'config' didn't work quite well ..i have multiple machines to test . so on 64 didn't do the trick ... just a recomendation , create a file , let's name it 'configuration.cmd' or 'configuration.bat' ... without the quotes , and inside we should add these lines ( where is 'nameofthegame' it fugures for sure what is his purpose ' ) and save it :

start nameofthegame.exe - setup



- and this trick will show the setup instant on any systems 


- and now i freaked out 'cause after finishing all the games , over 300 ( of tomb raider level editor games ..such as this one ) ... now i have found out about this site .. just replace dot wit'.'

trledotnet

- more than 2000 releases for tomb raider fans .. it's fucking insane

http://image.bayimg.com/fajmhaada.jpg

How does it works ?

1. start a new game and save ( or if u have a save copy/paste right next to this software ) .
2. now clik on it and choose maximise and save .
3.now copy the save and the back-up over the initial save of the game 

NOTE : .cheating with this means that u dont pick up medi packs and flares during gameplay ..u have more than enough ... at any point u can make another save and modify that ..or just insert the software inside ur main game folder ( or where are the saves ) ... best of luck ... cheaters"
,glynn5500,2011-07-09T18:00Z,"xplor3r... thnx for that m8 , ill try that now but this ul is a bit weird isnt it ? "

http://image.bayimg.com/hajmnaada.jpg

install notes for this one :

- download first
- unrar it 
- inside 'Audio' press 'start_me' 
- wait for tha audio to be converted ( it will auto make them )
- after the procedure ends you can play the game , just hit 'tomb4.exe' 

NOTE : - u could create that file i wast talking about ... how to make it ?

STEP 1 : right click on ur dekstop and select notepad/wordpad or whatever u're using
STEP 2 : write this code below and save the file as config.bat ....bat is the extension , just type when you save like this ... config.bat ... and save

start Tomb2.exe - setup

STEP 3  : now place this new file called 'config.bat' inside the game folder and press it whenever u want to change some settings for this game ...also u could make this for any game of tomb raider 2,3,4,5  and also for any tomb raider fan game"

[V],globeplus,2011-07-09T23:36Z,"INSTRUCTIONS


DATA

1 - run the GLOBEconverter.exe then wait about ten seconds to have a data folder with all the levels on the folder
2 - DONE ! NOW open the Audio folder .


AUDIO

1 - run the cdaudio_player.exe
2 - click on the Tools tab
3 - select Uncompressed external WAV files
4 - browse the extracted skribblerzstonez2\audio folder
5 - NOW IMPORTANT : with the left click mouse highlight all the ogg audio files in the folder , they will be 59 in total between 001 and 111 then click open (this little trick must be done because the tool donĂÂ´t have an add folder option but the multiple files still possible with this move)
6 - say Yes to the Delete original OGG file after UNcompressing message
7 - wait the decode to wav format of the 59 selected audio files , takes close 30 seconds
8 - DONE ! close the tool and the audio is now decoded to the original perfect state before the conversion .


STARTING

to start the game run the Configuration Box shortcut for game options or the skribblerzstonez2.exe to start the game

PS :. 

the GLOBEconverter.exe and the audio converter folder on the audio folder can be deleted after the requested tasks done .



* GLOBE 2011 * fan made tomb raider *

NOTE : carefull with the antivirus if it is blocking the converter.exe somehow because the little different structure ."
[V],globeplus,2011-07-10T09:01Z,"To the MAC users : copy the script.dat and the english.dat on the MAC Scripts ONLY folder to the front of the game folder overwriting the existant dat files .
