,lazysheep,2011-07-13T02:46Z,which program do you use to reduce the file size to below 4GB for external HDs attached to the PS3?
,DarthPS3,2011-07-13T19:49Z,"mkv2vob or tsMuxer, depending on what I'm converting. Google how to use 'em."
,DarthPS3,2011-07-13T19:50Z,Though its mkv2vob that splits the files. 
,lazysheep,2011-07-14T09:55Z,"i've been using mkv2vob, but i was trying to find a program that could do it w/o splitting the file.  i'm sure you had to get this file down to below 4GB from the original file.  trying to figure out how you do that.

good encode, btw.  plays perfectly fine on my PS3."
,DarthPS3,2011-07-15T00:33Z,"No, this file was originally just about the size that it is now. The only ways I know of doing what your talking about is either downgrading the quality of the source video or splitting the file, which I know I used, for example, on my Thin Red Line torrent. I'm just happy the splitting works as easily and as well as it does. "
,lazysheep,2011-07-15T09:50Z,"ok, guess i'll stick to splitting the files.  thanks for your feedback"
,blusniffer,2011-07-17T18:10Z,"Funny, i've put battle los angeles through every converter/muxer etc and still can't play any version of Battle LA on the ps3!

Thanks but with just 3 seeds in 10 days your talking bullshit!"
,DarthPS3,2011-07-17T20:19Z,"I wish I could do more than lol at blusniffer and his/her pathetic words, but I don't have the energy, other than to say that there's 37 seeds on this file, and 200 others have downloaded it with no complaints, not to mention that I myself watched it. Fool of a took."
,DarthPS3,2011-07-17T20:20Z,Stupid whining ignorant fucking bitches. 
,DarthPS3,2011-07-18T08:28Z,"My girlfriend says I should be nicer, but I don't like being called a liar, especially with something that is barely justifiable as a hobby of sorts. 
Anyways, you cannot just mux a Cinavia protected file, you must break the protection first. That means getting a hold of a proper .mkv format file and working from there. 
For details on muxing, check google, or the help included in the program you are using. 
...that is, if you are having trouble figuring it out yourself."
,blusniffer,2011-07-18T18:03Z,"I downloaded it, tried it + got the cinavia warning with loss of audio after 20mins ( identical to every other Battle la torrent), so not a whining bitch, just a community user who knows ur claims bullshit!
 3 quick replies, me thinks he doth protest too much! Your girlfriend obviously likes the fact u quote from lord of the rings? lmao"
,5amjr,2011-07-18T18:12Z,"Won't play on my PS3, what a fucking waste of bandwidth.
To anyone else who thinks they can get rid of cinavia with programs try reading wikipedia, there's no Muxer/converter program created that can remove cinavia copyrighting, none! All PB vip's are in agreement guys!"
,Porna420,2011-07-26T05:19Z,"Still cinevia protected.  Sorry, not seeding."
,DarthPS3,2011-07-26T20:48Z,"I've tried deleting this torrent too many times to count, and stopped seeding it long ago. Apologies, and be happy you get that much. "
,DittoHeadster79,2011-08-12T10:24Z,"Just turn your PS3 clock an hour ahead or something like that, when Cinavia kicks in...by doing so the movie plays fine again about 20 minutes. ThereÂ´s a little clicking during the movie, but donÂ´t bother me too much."
