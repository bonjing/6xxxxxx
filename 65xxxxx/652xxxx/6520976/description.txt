SUMMARY:
During the late 19th century, legendary vampire hunter Gabriel Van Helsing 
is a man cursed with a past he cannot recall and driven by a mission he cannot 
deny. Van Helsing finds a land still mired in past, where legendary creatures 
of darkness come to life. A place ruled over by the evil, seductive and 
unbeatable vampire, Count Dracula. It is Dracula that Van Helsing has been 
sent to terminate. Anna Valerious is one of the last of a powerful royal 
family, now nearly annihilated by Dracula. A fearless hunter in her own 
right, Anna is bent on avenging her ancestors and ending an ancient curse by 
killing the vampire. Joined by a common foe, Van Helsing and Anna set out to 
destroy Dracula along with his empire of fear. But in challenging an enemy who 
never dies, Van Helsing uncovers a secret he never imagined and comes face-to-face 
with the unresolved mysteries of his own enshrouded past.
