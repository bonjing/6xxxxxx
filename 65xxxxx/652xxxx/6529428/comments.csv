Again, I would like to remind the members that if anybody knows of a person with the retail CD to ask if they would mind uploading a Flac version of this album. MP3s at 192kbps and above sound good, however nothing beats a Flac upload in audio quality, as it is as good as the 16bit wave file that it was ripped from. Many make audio CDs from Flac recordings that sound exactly like the original, which is what I would like to do. Even Itunes treat such Flac>Wave produced compact discs as being originals. 

Happy to see people downloading and seeding this torrent as well. Thanks go out to the seeders, as my bandwidth is small! Thanks!

Peace."
