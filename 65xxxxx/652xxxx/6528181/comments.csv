Here's a few requests. One or two of them are FullBush and/or ATK Hairy, so its likely you have them.. Another one I believe is from Aunt Judy's, so I don't expect you to have the sets.. as for the others, I don't know where they come from but I wish I did so I can find more. I have been hunting for sets of these for a long, long time. Any fills would be immensely appreciated!

I have some names, although I am not entirely sure they are correct.

Anne (I believe) - http://bayimg.com/aAjkpaAdA

Josie (99% sure) - http://bayimg.com/bAJKaAadA

Terri or Terry (quite sure) - http://bayimg.com/BajKEAAda

No clue - http://bayimg.com/BajkGaaDA
