,rza3rdwrld,2011-07-09T10:36Z,"judging from the sample, all i can say is that it's better than a telesync, and that's about where it stops. it's really fuzzy. but hey, if you're into that sort of thing, then by all means"

,Danks420,2011-07-10T07:51Z,to see the screens you just gotta right click and open the link in new tab.. :]
,countkurt,2011-07-10T09:22Z,The screens are unfortunately blocked....
,felacio,2011-07-10T09:48Z,@countkurt: just COPY the link and paste it into a new tab.   
,Dj_xTc,2011-07-10T14:34Z,@felacio it's still blocked either way
,useitright,2011-07-10T16:50Z,"Wait for a dvd rip and you wont bitch about quality.  I am sick of hearing people complain about ppv rips and cam rips.  You need to understand what your downloading before you badmouth the quality of someone's hard work.  If you dont want to watch it in that quality, then wait for a proper rip.  Otherwise SHUT THE FUCK UP AND SAY THANK YOU FOR THE FREE SHIT DUMBASS."
,snowbirds,2011-07-10T21:56Z,"People like ""useitright"" are incredibly stupid.  They bitch, whine and complain at people who are posting the quality of the upload.

For a long time I have tried to understand the psychology of these whining complainers.  But I still don't get it.

Sharing the quality of an upload is a not a personal attack on the uploader.  Yes, sometimes people are rude about it.  But in to attack people for objectively posting their  opinion of the quality is completely stupid.

Thanks to the uploader, and thanks to all those who posted the A/V quality."
,7r0j4n,2011-07-10T22:02Z,"the screens work fine,but you cannot view them in the same window as the pirate bay.......open a new tab in firefox or new window in ie."
,BLACKCYPHER,2011-07-10T23:23Z,Damn dude you are one angry mofo thanks for the download yo.
,speedy1791,2011-07-11T07:29Z,"lol funny how can you even call that a ppv rip if you had to pay for that i feel bad for you. it is clearly a TS, camrip"
,ug2009,2011-07-11T10:07Z,"useitright @

u r right i agree with you..people are just complaining about the rip what you are getting it that is bonus no need to complain...if you can not say thanks then u must not complain......"
,darthsaber89,2011-07-11T16:35Z,best quality out so far. and its viewable. quit complaining if its free. v9:a8
,mancbhoy,2011-07-11T20:15Z,"judging from the sample its a good ppvrip best fast five upload to date, kinda like a old VHS it looks watchable if you cant wait personaly guna wait for a DVD rip but thanks for the upload IwannaFan2 +1 from me"
,shani9211,2011-07-12T20:15Z,"here is the A8 V7 M10 Quality PPVRIP, 
becareful its not my opinion i had just copy paste it !
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6529342/Fast_Five_2011_PPVRip_DTRG"
,Louloubenedetti,2011-07-13T08:05Z,ALL PPVRIP IFLIX torrents are tracked by studio. Download with EXTREME caution...
,Krumpzz,2011-07-13T14:23Z,"V6
A6

Its improved from straight CAM quality, But it still has major dark spots in the movie which is annoying. But good pp rip."
,sexter91,2011-07-16T22:10Z,"A:8
V:8
M:9
very good quality although not widescreen. thanks to the uploader for the efforts. for subtitles go here:

,harryholder,2011-07-20T20:35Z,Does anyone know if this is cinavia free?
,Louloubenedetti,2011-07-20T20:35Z,"THESE TORRENTS ARE TRACKED BY STUDIO...ALL ""PPVRIP IFLIX"" TORRENTS ARE"
,ust2,2011-07-21T06:05Z," Gave it the 20min test on PS3, it did not trigger Cinivia so it looks like it's good to go.

 A:9 (sounds great on my sub and speakers)
 V:7.5 (9 if you watch it from a distance and adjust brightness/contrast levels)

 It's true that it's not widescreen, but you know what, this is better! 

 It actually takes up the full screen without having to stretch and distort it slightly like every other movie I watch these days lol."
,harryholder,2011-07-21T16:19Z,@ust2 thanks alot man saves me time :)
,backhander300,2011-07-23T01:13Z,@toebee97 where can i get one of those? im kinda new to this
,Shauncold,2011-07-29T04:20Z,"For those having problems watching cinavia protected movies, go to youtube and type in cinavia fix PS3(that's the only fix I know of or care about personally)"
,dlarks,2011-08-01T19:04Z,"@backhander300 just type peerguardian download into google you will get it bro , "
,alsaad3,2011-08-03T09:53Z,try it out.........
,ibr4him,2011-08-04T16:20Z,"not widescreen, it sucks."
,coderX,2011-08-05T04:34Z,"like an above comment said. It's like watching a VHS. better than cam rips but shitter than DVD. It's watchable. 
A=6
V=7
I'm surprised though. PPV has excellent quality. Why does this look so shitty? You need to upgrade that capture card I guess."
,coderX,2011-08-05T04:36Z,"@ust2
Untrue. Most movies are shot with a wide camera lens to accommodate for the wide screen TVs."
,martink61,2011-08-05T13:52Z,"Been awaiting for a copy of this that wasnt Half-A-Film (Just the left side of the screen), so
I was bummed out when this downloaded and will not play on VLC or Miro?? The only one ive ever had like that too. Wosgoinon?"
,Louloubenedetti,2011-08-11T19:57Z,"@toebee97 Peerblock is not available for MAC... peerguardian is, tho both work off ""blacklisting"" which only works when a site is recorded and added. NEXT TIME, know wtf YOU'RE talking about, douche...

FROM THEIR OWN SITE: ""While many people do use IP Filtering software like PeerBlock to help ""protect"" themselves from being sued for copyright infringement, it is not 100% protection.  In fact some people believe that using blocklists like this are completely useless.  Others disagree, and believe that even if it's not 100% safe, it still lets them download files more safely.  Sometimes they invoke the ""Bear Principle"": when running away from an angry bear you don't need to be faster than that bear . . . you only need to be faster than the guy next to you. """
,azepos,2011-08-12T10:22Z,"It's not a bad copy but still not good.
In my opinion, it's like a cam rip that was recorded on better graphics.
It's watchable! Although you won't feel the action very much.

A/V 7/7"
,ILTORRENTS,2011-08-14T07:00Z,930 KB/S WOOT =) thx for upload.
