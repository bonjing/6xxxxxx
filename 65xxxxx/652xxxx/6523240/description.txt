Parker - Vol 1: Hunter & Vol 2: The Outfit [IDW]
By: Richard Stark

Volume 1 - Hunter:
Parker belongs to the bottom of the urban jungle's economic strata, but the 
top of its food chainâ€”anyone who stands between him and his revenge is 
doomed, whether they're trying to resist him or just happen to be in the 
way. As the book begins, he's returning to New York City in the Kennedy 
era with murder in his eyes: double-crossed by his wife and partners, 
he's come back to kill whoever needs killing to get his money.

Volume 2 - The Outfit:
The crime syndicate that professional heister Parker so royally pissed off 
(they pissed him off first, to be fair) in the last book finds him languishing 
in Miami Beach with a surgically transformed face. The syndicates attempted 
hit goes wrong, and Parker shifts back into his relentless vengeance gear 
(he never smiles, but you get the sense heâ€™s happiest brawling and shooting 
his way through impossible odds) as he calls in a few favors from his 
underworld associates and goes after the head of the outfit.
