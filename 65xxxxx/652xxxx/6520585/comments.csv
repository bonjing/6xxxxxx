,ribblywinks,2011-07-28T14:09Z,"hey vero, i'm the uploader of this torrent and you're right (i am a total idiot) i checked the website (dvd7 is ok though!). I dont know much about compression so my apologies to those who have downloaded! I deleted the original files from my computer so I'll have to download again and re-encode. I will upload a complete torrent soon-ish with instructions on which files you need if you already have already downloaded these."

on handbrake you can reduce the size of the files a lot by setting the bitrates for video and audio.  i've found 326kbps acceptable quality for video, maybe 48 kbps for audio.. its a bit of trial and error..

thank you for correcting the comments elsewhere."

,permageek,2011-12-07T09:38Z,"hey folks, i have the box set, and i tried to use handbrake (or maybe it was mpeg streamclip) last summer to compress the DVDs down to a usable size, but the same thing happened to me as it did to ribblywinks: only the first of the three episodes per DVD came out. if someone can help me figure out how to do it, i will compress them down to size over the holidays, i really want this permaculture course to get out because it's an excellent source of learning."
,nvcupload,2011-12-23T21:34Z,"There seems to already be a compressed version of the whole set, a little over 7 gigs total.  I haven't watched all the videos, but the quality is good enough for me, and it looks like everything is there...

It's not on TPB, but you can do a general internet search for ""Permaculture Design Certificate Course torrent"" to find it.  Maybe someone could repost the torrent on TPB?"
