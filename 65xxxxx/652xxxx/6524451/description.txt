[W4F PRESENTS]: Q.and.A.AU.2011.07.07.Leaky.Boat.Special.WS.PDTV.XviD-W4F

 
[RELEASE DATE]: 2011/07/08

 
[GENRE.......]: Documentary/Discussion

 
[DESCRIPTION.]:
"When Australia stopped the refugee boats in 2001, most
Australians applauded. Ten years later, the people who were
there tell us what we didn't then know.

In late winter 2001, the crew of the Norwegian tanker the
Tampa pulled more than 400 refugees out of a fishing boat
that was sinking off the north-west coast of Australia. The
refugees demanded to be taken to Christmas Island. As the
captain complied, the Australian authorities radioed. They
threatened to seize his ship and throw him in prison if he
entered Australian waters. The order had come from the very
top."

This special episode of Q&A features a 1 hour documentary
'Leaky Boat' followed by a 1 hour live discussion session.

Enjoy this quality doco and lively debate on the endlessly
hot-topic refugee issue.

Note: Was going to release the doco alone, unfortunately the
ABC merged it in with Q&A again.
