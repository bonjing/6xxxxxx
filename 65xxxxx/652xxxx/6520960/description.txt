 Publisher: Pambazuka Press | ISBN 10: 0857490168 | 2011 | PDF | 672 pages | 24.7 MB

 A groundbreaking book, accessible but scholarly, by African activists. It uses research, life stories, and artistic expressionâ€”including essays, case studies, poetry, news clips, songs, fiction, memoirs, letters, interviews, short film scripts, and photographsâ€”to examine dominant and deviant sexualities and investigate the intersections between sex, power, masculinities, and femininities. It also opens a space, particularly for young people, to think about African sexualities in different ways.
