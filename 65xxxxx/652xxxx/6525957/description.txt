Storyline:

After the breaking of the Fellowship, Frodo and Sam journey to Mordor with the creature
Gollum as their guide in The Two Towers. Meanwhile, Aragorn [Viggo Mortensen], Legolas
[Orlando Bloom], and Gimli [John Rhys-Davies] join in the defense of the people of Rohan,
who are the first target in the eradication of the race of Men by the renegade wizard Saruman
(Christopher Lee) and the dark lord Sauron. Fantastic creatures, astounding visual effects,
and a climactic battle at the fortress of Helm's Deep make The Two Towers a worthy
successor to The Fellowship of the Ring, grander in scale but retaining the story's emotional
intimacy.

Review [c/o amazon]

I already reviewed the regular "Motion Picture Trilogy" containing the non-extended editions
of the legendary Lord of The Rings masterpieces on one set. However, this newest edition is
a grand improvement on the previous edition. This item is a much, MUCH better investment
than the old theatrical counterparts and is perhaps the greatest DVD purchase one will likely
ever make.

A lot "Director's Cut" scenes are usually just added footage that doesn't do a whole lot to add
onto the theatrical edition of movies with examples like Star Wars, Manhunter, or even most
of the "Aliens" movies as well. The extra material is just that, extras, that wouldn't kill me to
never see again.

It's a totally different story altogether with the "Lord Of The Rings" movies altogether. While
the regular theatrical editions were mind-blowing, the extended cuts of the same films do
wonders in fleshing out the story and expanding the characters a lot more. Several characters
that were not much more than background people are shown much more screen time, stories
are greatly expanded, other scenes are much more meaningful, and the movies overall have
a totally different feel altogether thanks to all of the extra footage that was not included on the
theatrical editions. Now as I watch them, the old editions of them are rendered almost
completely obsolete due to the chopped up nature of them. I sometimes wonder if Peter
Jackson grimaced when he had to leave a lot of extra shots out of the movies to fit them onto
the theatres when they were released.

"Fellowship" has 30 minutes of extra footage included to a length of 3 and a half hours. "The
Two Towers" was extended 43 minutes to a total of 3 hours and 42 minutes and finally "The
Return of The King" is extended by a grand 50 minutes and the ultimate result is a whopping
4 hours and 11 minutes long! I don't know about you but I don't know how one can make a
longer movie like this but Jackson did it! The grand total of all three extended editions is at
least an astronomical 11 hours long! This is just the movies themselves.

As for all of the extras on the "Extended Editions", there are over a days worth of extras for
surf through on the latter two discs of each film set. The things on them are too great to
explain in detail with this review.

Whether you buy them individually or all at once on this massive gift set, "The Lord of The
Rings" trilogy goes down as the greatest trilogy of all time. You could not make a better
purchase. I swear it!
