Adventures in OZ [IDW] (2006)
by: Eric Shanower [Of Marvel OZ]
***Uploaded by Request***

From 1986-92, Eric Shanower made 5 Graphic Oz Novels [originally printed by FIRST 
and DARK HORSE COMICS]: The Enchanted Apples,The Secret Island, The Ice King, The 
Forgotten Forest, and The Blue Witch. Both the black-and-white and colour artwork 
for the graphic novels and other books have been rescanned by the publisher IDW 
Publishing, and Eric made sure that printing mistakes from the original editions 
would not be repeated (i.e. bits of a picture without colour) and did some minor
revisions to the artwork, so therefore this book looks better than the orginal 
printings.



Eric Showaner went on to do the ongoing Marvel OZ line:
