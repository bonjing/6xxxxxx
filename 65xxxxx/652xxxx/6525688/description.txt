Filmed in 1992 at the Duke of York's Theatre.  Good quality for VHS rip.

For the first time hereâ€™s the chance to savour Jack Deeâ€™s full-length live show. The "Bulldog On Valium" lets fly with an unforgettable performance which captivates a packed house at the Duke of Yorkâ€™s Theatre in London. Britainâ€™s most stylish comedian makes it a sensational night with biting routines like Radiator Man, Sodding Typical, Home Knits and Craft Fair. The star of his own television series has had the critics raving - and youâ€™ll be in no doubt why after more than an hour of non-stop, hard-hitting stand up comedy.
