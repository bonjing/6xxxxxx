Organize your research, all of it.

Papers2 helps you organize over 85 different document types
Papers doesnâ€™t just want your PDFs, it will gladly organize all your documents, whether they are word documents, spreadsheets, presentations, posters, scanned receipts, and many more. Papers even has a dedicated space for your own articles, and conference related materials, like your travel documents and posters.

Some papers are special.

Easily keep track of your own papers and documents
Your papers deserve their own place in Papers. Keep your own work at your fingertips, anytime. Papers keeps track of your manuscripts as well. As soon as you enter a citation, a manuscript file is added to your Papers library. Upgrading a manuscript to published status moves it from manuscripts into the general library, and into My Papers.
