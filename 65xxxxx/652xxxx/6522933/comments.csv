[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-07-08T03:37Z,"@runtwo
I tried to do these in small size, but it makes only a 200MB difference, the movie is packed with fast action and graphics. So I needed more bitrate, else this would look blurred :(
My area is 480p, will be 480p always. Some 720p will be uploaded in between :)
thanks mate."

,lwilli2009,2011-07-13T07:11Z,"If you would be so kind, and have the time... I have quite a list, and all I ask is if you keep the ps3 compatiablity... showtime is out so it will play mkv files now... certain ones.... anyway... here goes...

AR=All Released
Harry Potter AR
Resident Evil AR
Final Destination AR
Spider-Man AR
X-Men AR

P.S whatever you can get will be nice, and thanks anyway/in advance...
also if you need sources let me know...
I also think you should share how you encode/the program and process..."
,lwilli2009,2011-07-13T07:14Z,Also your rips are Top Notch!!! 10/10 buddy... keep 'em coming...
,lwilli2009,2011-07-13T07:15Z,"Also your rips are Top Notch!! 10/10!! Nice job, thanks for taking the time to share quality releases... Keep 'em coming...."
,lwilli2009,2011-07-13T08:15Z,"Also for harry potter it doesn't matter the size(really doesn't matter the size for any, but I know you like them small...) just try and keep it under 1gb, 720p if at all possible, only brrips done by others are 480p and I see you use .mp4 which is better than or equal to mkv and more compatible with other devices, ps3 native plays mp4's so I take it that's the fomat you'll use... excellent.... thanks and and if you ever share your program/process, I'll start ripping as well... I could even help you... just a thought... thanks and peace/later...."
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-07-16T18:48Z,"thx willi,
Most of our friends are with poor bandwidth, I'd like to stick with it :)
I really appreciate ur concern. I'll try to provide the best quality encodes, peace :)"
,gameraby,2011-07-30T15:14Z,Thanks a lot. I hope that its better than other releases an many others have uploaded it but with this amount of action they don't look good when there is action packed scene. I hope this one live upto my expectations. :)
