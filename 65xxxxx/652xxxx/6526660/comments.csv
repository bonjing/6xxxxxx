,Nickyboy7,2011-07-09T16:28Z,For people wondering where Ghost Adventures has gone it will be back with a new series starting in September. And you will get 34 episodes in the next series. Travel channel has confirmed.
[T],trialNerror,2011-07-10T03:35Z,"Nicky is correct.  What many of you thought was S05E01, E02, E03 was actually the end of Season 4.

Actually, I think it was the end of Season 3.

Oh well, since we've screwed up the episode numbering for so long I have no choice but to continue screwing it up.  This September's Ghost Adventures will be S05E01 (even though it SHOULD be S04E01 and I've already released a S05E01 because so many people have whined and sniveled to me about it saying that's what it should be when all along they were wrong)."
