Bear Family CD. Release: 2011

Bear Familyâ€™s 2011 compilation Sugartime contains all of the songs Charlie Phillips released between 1957 and 1967, filling out the lengthy disc with some â€˜70s recordings, demos, and unreleased songs. Phillips is known for writing the â€˜50s country standard â€œSugartime,â€ turned into a hit by the McGuire Sisters and recorded by Johnny Cash, but Bear Familyâ€™s compilation digs much deeper, deeper even than his own answer song â€œNo More Sugartime,â€ rounding up his singles for Coral, Columbia, Longhorn, Reprise, and Artco. Phillips strolled a little sleepily through his early-â€˜60s sides yet there was charm to his gentle touch; he had a warm, easy voice and his songs were simple and sturdy, the latter turning out to be a strength as his music turned toward purer country as the â€˜60s rolled on. While he never had a veiled threat of menace like some hardcore honky tonkers, his geniality was a perfect fit for Western swing and friendly dancehall two-steps, and his late-â€˜60s sides like â€œBig Ballâ€™s in Cowtown,â€ â€œTwenty Fools Ago,â€ and â€œBlue Blue Bottleâ€ are terrific genre pieces, the kind that should be found on a roadhouse jukebox. Phillips may not have defined his era, but listening to Sugartime itâ€™s possible to trace how the times shifted from the sweetness of â€œSugartimeâ€ to the straight-ahead beer-joint tunes of the â€˜60s, winding up with the mildly wacky novelty â€œYouâ€™re My LSD.â€ Although there may be a couple slow stretches along the way, this journey provided by Sugartime is definitely worth taking.
