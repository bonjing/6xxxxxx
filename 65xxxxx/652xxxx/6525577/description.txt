From Wiki:


The Goo Goo Dolls is an American alternative rock band formed in 1986 in Buffalo, New York, by vocalist and guitarist John Rzeznik and vocalist and bass guitarist Robby Takac.[1] Since the end of 1994, Mike Malinin has been the band's drummer, a position previously held by George Tutuska. Some of their most popular songs include "Name" from 1995's A Boy Named Goo, "Iris" and "Slide" from 1998's Dizzy Up The Girl, which produced five top-10 singles, and "Here Is Gone" and "Big Machine" from 2002's Gutterflower. The Goo Goo Dolls have 14 top-10 singles[2] and have sold nearly 9 million albums in the United States alone.


The Goo Goo Dolls were originally called The Sex Maggots[4] which was changed when a promoter refused to book them. The band's original line-up included John Rzeznik (vocals, guitar), Robby Takac (vocals, bass guitar) and George Tutuska (drums, percussion). In the beginning, John would not sing, due to his shyness. Takac and Tutuska had been long-time friends in school and met Rzeznik while he was playing in the band The Beaumonts with Takacâ€™s cousin.[5] The trio picked their name from a True Detective ad for a toy called a Goo Goo Doll.[6] "We were young and we were a garage band not trying to get a deal. We had a gig that night and needed a name. It's the best we came up with, and for some reason it stuck. If I had five more minutes, I definitely would have picked a better name" John stated. With Takac as their lead singer, the band released their first album, Goo Goo Dolls in 1987 on Mercenary Records, but was picked up in 1988 by Celluloid Records, a larger record company. The band released its second album, Jed, in 1989 after moving to Los Angeles.[7]

The band released its third album, Hold Me Up, in 1990 and featured Rzeznik as the lead vocalist on five tracks, including the single, "There You Are" â€“ as well their then concert favorite, Two Days in February. Despite being earlier dismissed as having a sound too similar to The Replacements, as well as being embraced by local college radio and punk scenes (including playing such venues as CBGB), the Goo Goo Dolls' third release had incorporated elements of heavy metal, pop rock, and punk rock. In 1991, the song "I'm Awake Now" was recorded for the soundtrack of Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare.

Superstar Car Wash, released in 1993, received significant media attention. The critical success and encouraging sales of their last album resulted in a larger budget from Metal Blade Records. The album was partially recorded in Metalworks Studio in Mississauga, Ontario. "We Are the Normal" (the single for which Rzeznik asked frontman Paul Westerberg of The Replacements to write the lyrics), received a major push toward play on college and independent radio, while its video was displayed on MTV's 120 Minutes program. "Fallin' Down" made it onto the 1993 soundtrack of Pauly Shore's hit film Son in Law.

Shortly after recording the band's fifth album A Boy Named Goo, George Tutuska was kicked out of the band. The band moved forward from this December 31, 1994 incident, hiring Mike Malinin in 1995, and toured rigorously.

A Boy Named Goo had a catchy rock sound, and became one of most successful alternative rock albums of mid-90's. It sold modestly in this time; however, it was not until the release of the single "Name" that the band experienced any viable commercial success. A Boy Named Goo became the first album in Metal Blade history to achieve double-platinum status. This success, however, proved bittersweet, as the band found themselves in a legal battle with Metal Blade records. The band filed suit against Metal Blade, claiming they had not earned any royalties from their albumâ€™s sales, which was attributed to a "grossly unfair, one-sided and unenforceable contract" which had been signed by the band in 1987.[8] The two sides reached a settlement which had the band signed to the Metal Blade's distributing label, Warner Bros. Records, under which the band released their sixth album, Dizzy Up the Girl, in 1998.[9] The undisputed success of "Name" marked a fundamental change in the bandâ€™s sound toward a more polished, commercial direction. It was "Name" that had made the band popular and they were able to make a guest appearance on 90210 and even present an Award to Michael Jackson.

Rzeznik was approached to write a song for the City of Angels soundtrack, and the end product was "Iris". This song propelled the band to stardom, as it stayed on top of Billboard Hot 100 Airplay charts for a record-breaking 18 weeks, and was nominated for three Grammys that year. According to several interviews with Rzeznik, he was experiencing serious bouts of writer's block when he was approached, and was on the verge of quitting the band days before he wrote the song that would launch the band to worldwide fame.[10]

"Iris" was included on the triple-platinum Dizzy Up the Girl, and was among Top-Ten hits "Slide", "Black Balloon", "Broadway", and "Dizzy" from the same album. The new, polished sound garnered legions of new fans, many of whom had not followed the band before their mainstream success. Most of the Goo Goo Dolls concerts feature few, if any, songs the band wrote before 1995, reflecting the bandâ€™s more mainstream sound. In 2001, the Goos released their first ever compilation CD, What I Learned About Ego, Opinion, Art & Commerce. Next, Gutterflower (2002) â€” the last longplay in spirit of America, with dark lyrical undertones from Rzeznik's divorceâ€”achieved gold certification, producing the hits "Here Is Gone", "Sympathy", and "Big Machine". On July 4, 2004, the band performed a free concert in their hometown of Buffalo, continuing through a deluge of rain that can be seen on the DVD released later that year. The DVD also contained a studio version of the Goo Goo Dolls' cover of "Give a Little Bit" by Supertramp. The single reached the top of the Adult Top 40 chart in 2005.







Superstar Car Wash 1993


Superstar Car Wash is the fourth studio album by the Goo Goo Dolls, released in February, 1993 on Warner Bros. Johnny Rzeznik wrote the song "We Are the Normal" with his idol, The Replacements' singer Paul Westerberg. The two corresponded by mail but never sat in a studio together. The song "Fallin' Down" was featured in the 1993 Pauly Shore movie Son In Law. Also, the song "So Far Away" was originally written and recorded with the title "Dancing In Your Blood"; the song had the same basic structure, but different lyrics, more minimal instrumentation, and a slightly different melody. Superstar Car Wash, or simply "SSCW", marks the end of the Takac, grungier era, and the beginning of the Rzeznik, more polished era. Superstar Car Wash was an actual car washing business on William Street just outside the downtown region of Buffalo, the hometown of the band.

A Boy Named Goo 1995


A Boy Named Goo, sometimes referred to as ABNG, is the fifth studio album by the Goo Goo Dolls, released in 1995 on Warner Bros. Records.

This is the Goo Goo Dolls' last studio album with George Tutuska on drums; he was replaced by current drummer Mike Malinin just before the album was released. This album is the Goo Goo Dolls first studio album not to have fourteen tracks. The song "Stand Alone" was written by George Tutuska, and because Johnny Rzeznik didn't want to exploit George's efforts after his dismissal, the song was only included on a promo version of the album. On the wide-release version, it is replaced with "Disconnected" and "Slave Girl." On the same promo, "Ain't That Unusual" was labeled as "Someday." The two replacement songs are covers of songs by defunct Buffalo and Sydney, punk bands The Enemies and Lime Spiders.

The song "Name" is well-known as the Goo Goo Dolls' first hit. This was "quite accidentally," according to lead singer Johnny Rzeznik. It also marked the band's last album with the Metal Blade Records imprint.

Dizzy Up The Girl 1998


Dizzy Up the Girl is the sixth album by Goo Goo Dolls, released in 1998.

In most parts of the world, Dizzy Up the Girl is the Goo Goo Dolls' most successful album to date, selling over 3 million copies (3x platinum certified). The success of Dizzy Up the Girl can arguably be attributed to the rock ballad "Iris", which was also included in the soundtrack album of the film City of Angels. "Iris" immediately reached #1 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart upon its release in March from the City of Angels soundtrack, and stayed on top for 18 weeks, setting a record that still stands as of June 2011. The song also reached #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart and the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, along with several other charts in the U.S and U.K, and included 3 Grammy nominations.

In addition to the huge success of "Iris" (US #9), Dizzy Up the Girl featured three additional top forty singles, with the songs "Slide" (US #8), "Broadway" (US #24), and "Black Balloon" (US #16). The album also produced the moderately popular song "Dizzy" (US #108), which has since become a fan favorite. Along with top forty single status, music videos for all five singles reached VH1's Top 20 Music Videos chart upon release.

Something For The Rest Of Us 2010



Something for the Rest of Us is the ninth studio album by Buffalo-based rock band, the Goo Goo Dolls. It was released on August 28, 2010 in Australia and on August 31 in North America through Warner Bros. Records.

The recording process took place during the spring to fall of 2009 in the GCR Audio studio in Buffalo and "the Ark" in Los Angeles, with producer Tim Palmer. A single had been originally slated to be released in November 2009 with an album release in February 2010, but the band went back into the studio in January 2010. According to lead singer and guitarist John Rzeznik, this was done to make further improvements on what they had previously thought had been a finished record.[3]

Several producers were brought in to assist on the production process, including Butch Vig, John Fields, Paul David Hager[4] and Rob Cavallo.[5] Something for the Rest of Us will be the third Goo Goo Dolls studio album that Cavallo has produced (Dizzy Up the Girl and Gutterflower).

When asked about the length of time between albums, Rzeznik admitted it was a mix of songwriting issues as well as taking time out for personal reasons; "I wanted to really dig deep and there are a million songs I threw away, like, â€œNah, it's not good enough. I wanna do something different. I wanna do something better, go deeper. I also wanted to have a life with my girlfriend for a while. I owed it to her to spend some time with her and be normal and be in one place. That was kind of important."[6]

In one of the Ustream sessions, Robby revealed that the album will have 12 songs and "Real" is not among them.[7] In late May, John announced that "Home" would be the first single and was released onto radio and iTunes stores on June 8, 2010.

On July 13, 2010, it was announced on the band's fan club website, Inner Machine, that an EP will be available to purchase at all remaining tour dates. The EP is titled Waiting for the Rest of It and it contains 4 new songs from Something for the Rest of Us plus a live recording of "Broadway" from the Something for the Rest of Us Tour.
