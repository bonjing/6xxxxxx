,Leib,2011-07-11T19:15Z,"Picture watching a distant scene looking through a sunglass tintted fish tank. That's the quality of this copy. Remember to set down a bottle of aspirin along with your wings, chips and beer, you're going to need it. SAFCuk009 - I'm disappointed in you that you allowed your name to be attached to this, your F1 Grand Prix vids are so good, otherwise."

,Booi3ie,2011-07-13T01:26Z,"I vote from now on we just rate based on video and auto quality.... 

for example this movie is a v-2 a-4 in my opinion.... we should get rid of the stupid ""for a cam"" ratings...."
,TyMod,2011-07-13T22:39Z,I agree.  Cause a 10 in CAM quality is like a 2 in DVD quality. lol

,Chardiieee,2011-07-14T15:08Z,"This movie sucked so bad, I could not believe it. As I got through the movie, I felt like I predicted sentence after sentence of their badly written dialogue. I couldnt even get all the way thru to the end, This isnt worth the effort being filmed, dont waste your time. Even on J's and B's for you know who's out there its not better on that. :s
~why do people post about that openly? lol only on piratebay?"
,Chardiieee,2011-07-14T15:12Z,"A = 2

The Cinavia means ""The audio track of the video that you are playing contains a Cinavia code indicating it was intended for presentation using professional equipment only (for example, in a theater) and is not authorized for playback by consumers."""
