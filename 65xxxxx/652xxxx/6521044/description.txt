Here it is...

I\'ve sourced and tracked down damn near every song that has ever been sampled by the Beastie Boys from Licensed to Ill up until To The 5 Boroughs, and all points in between. This has been an ongoing project since 1998 and although it will never be 100% complete, this is probably as close as it gets. Naturally, if I come across any of the impossible-to-find joints, I\'ll update the collection, and of course, if you have anything to add, please let me know!

All of the songs are tagged at 192kbps and are complete versions, no snippets or sound bytes...full complete tracks!
