Making music began as a hobby for the trio of Estonian based producers known as Mutated Forms. Original members Alexander (Zub) and Artjom (G-ruff) started experimenting with different genres of electronic music using any and all software they could find. They were then later joined by a third member Alex H, an experienced DJ who joined the crew in 2004. Their big break came in 2006 when Formation Records DJ SS signed one of their tracks â€˜My Feelingâ€™ to his World of Drum and Bass imprint. This was then followed by another single Blue Magic b/w Green Aquarium, which catapulted the trios music further towards the mainstream, gaining the attention of several key tastemakers within the scene.
