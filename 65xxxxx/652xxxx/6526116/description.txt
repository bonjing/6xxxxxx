Pedro the Lion was an indie rock band from Seattle, Washington. Formed by singer-songwriter David Bazan in 1995, he represented the main creative force of the band, backed by a rotation of various collaborating musicians. T. W. Walsh is considered to be the sole official band member besides Bazan. In 2006, Bazan and Walsh split amicably and Pedro the Lion was dissolved as Bazan went solo. Releasing four full-length albums and five EPs over 11 years, the band was known for its first person narrative lyrics with political and religious themes. Pedro The Lion was managed by Bob Andrews at Undertow Music Collective.

Winners Never Quit is the second album by Pedro the Lion. It was released on March 28, 2000 on Jade Tree Records. Although David Bazan played all of the instruments on the album, Trey Many (drums) and Josh Golden (bass) joined Bazan on tour later that year.

Review from AllMusic.com

by David Dwyer

David Bazan has stripped Pedro the Lion down to himself, his tape recorder and basement, and sonically the result is fine. Winners Never Quit is an odd fable of a corrupt, self-righteous politician and his sweeter but equally wayward brother. The opening song, "Slow and Steady Wins the Race," lends this whole affair more weight than it really deserves, and it is easily the best song on the album. Bazan works up a primitive blast of rock & roll on a couple of the songs, which gives Pedro more musical variety; otherwise, Bazan keeps it to the spare amateur vision he employed so well on It's Hard to Find a Friend; not always for the best. An interesting album, spooky in spots, but other than the terrific "Slow and Steady," this one's a curiosity.
