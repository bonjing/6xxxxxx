I downloaded, extracted, found an iso file and extracted THAT, and ran an installer which set up a game that launched but once you try to play it crashes.  The Game says upon launch that it is for Japan only, and everything is in Japanese, so maybe there's some Japanese component my english-speaking american computer doesn't have.  Oh well, move along."

Run it using Applocale's Japanese settings. Should work then."
