FINALLY!

A group of doctors go on their usual ritual of getting together once a year. 
This year it is camping in the middle of nowhere. And a killer who not only 
wants them dead. But wants to take away what little humanity they have.

A GREAT movie. The acting is impeccable. Hal Holbrook gives the performance of his life.

This is a 0 region encoded NTSC copy of the DVD.

It includes an audio commentary by Producer/Actor Lawrence Dane. (mitzi)
Video interviews with Lawrence Dane and Robin Gammell.

Please seed to a ratio of at least 1. If you have been looking and waiting years for an uncut version of this classic. Like I have.
So have all the others wanting it. Please show the respect they have shown you by seeding. Thank You!
