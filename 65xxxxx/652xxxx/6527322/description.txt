Big Jim Sullivan is probably the most popular studio musician in the UK, having played on hundreds of hit records. This was his contribution to the sitarploitation craze. There's some fuzzed out guitar, psych elements, interesting beats, but it's mostly melodic. Hard to find record, especially in NM condition like this one.
