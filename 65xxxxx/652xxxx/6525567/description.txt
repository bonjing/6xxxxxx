Today we release the ownage of another government-contracted IT company, IRC
Federal. They brag about their multi-million dollar partnership with the FBI,
Army, Navy, NASA, and the Department of Justice, selling out their "skills" to
the US empire. So we laid nuclear waste to their systems, owning their pathetic
windows box, dropping their databases and private emails, and defaced their
professional looking website.

In their emails we found various contracts, development schematics, and internal
documents for various government institutions including a proposal for the FBI
to develop a "Special Identities Modernization (SIM) Project" to "reduce
terrorist and criminal activity by protecting all records associated with
trusted individuals and revealing the identities of those individuals who may
pose serious risk to the United States and its allies". We also found 
fingerprinting contracts for the DOJ, biometrics development for the military, 
and strategy contracts for the "National Nuclear Security Administration 
Nuclear Weapons Complex".

Additionally we found login info to various VPNs and several Department of 
Energy login access panels that we are dumping *live* complete with some URLs 
to live ASP file browser and upload backdoors - let's see how long it takes for 
them to remove it (don't worry we'll keep putting it back up until they pull 
the box ;D)

Before we begin the drop, a personal message to the employees of IRC Federal:

If you place any value on freedom, then stop working for the oligarchy
and start working against it. Stop aiding the corporations and a government 
which uses unethical means to corner vast amounts of wealth and proceed 
to flagrantly abuse their power. Together, we have the power to change
this world for the better.

â€œHe who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps 
to perpetuate it.â€ â€“Martin Luther King, Jr.

Props to our black hat and antisec comrades: bantown, dikline,
h0no, phrack high council, ~el8 and all you kick-ass motherfuckers
we've never even heard of. Thank you.
