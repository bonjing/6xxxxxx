 An epidemic of sexually-transmitted infections and sexual violence is upon us. Political interests are overriding sexual freedom in the name of morality. Marriages are just as likely to fail as they are to succeed. Why, in a time of unprecedented personal liberties and medical knowledge, are so many Americans so uncertain about what constitutes ethical sexual behavior? 
 Sex Appeal is neither a moralistic screed nor a self-indulgent guide to sexual utopia. Instead, it charts a thoughtful course between extremes to present six ethical principles for sexual health and happiness: do no harm, celebrate sex, be careful, know yourself, speak up and speak out, and throw no stones. Sex Appeal elaborates upon each of these principles, asserting that sex can be fun, safe, and life-enhancing if approached in the right spirit and with the information necessary to make wise sexual choices. Providing clear guidelines for individuals seeking answers to their own personal questions about sex, the book also connects these questions to larger issues, such as how we as a society can reduce levels of sexual harm and sexually-transmitted infections, and how everyday individual choices can support this effort. Persuasive and eminently readable, Sex Appeal offers a welcome dose of clarity and common sense to todays most pressing sexual issues.
