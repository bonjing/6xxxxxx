,ArrMetal,2011-08-05T00:11Z,"Thanks for the brilliant upload!

Can you please upload The Outlaws and Sex Pistols complete discographies at 320kbps? I'd be grateful."
,ArrMetal,2011-08-06T17:59Z,"hmm.. In addition, I'd like you to upload Exodus, Kreator and Escape The Fate complete discographies at 320kbps if you don't mind. 

The above mentioned discography requests written in both of my comments which were posted on this web page are my last requests from you, unless you don't mind taking more requests.  

It is vital to mention that every time I wanna download stuff, I search for torrent downloads on google. Since I haven't found any of the requested discographies at 320kbps, I'm askin you to upload them. 

One way or the other, keep up the good work!!"
