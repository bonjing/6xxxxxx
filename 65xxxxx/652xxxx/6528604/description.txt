 The book summarizes the well established as well as the newest constitutive formulations that describe the variety of possible loadings beginning with quasi-static to impact. The rate dependence is crucial in the description. The implementation of discussed phenomenological physical laws into the environment of numerical codes is in focus of presentation. Numerical examples prove the importance of using the new constitutive properties in design.
