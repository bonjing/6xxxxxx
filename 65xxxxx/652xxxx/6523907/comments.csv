,chuckufarley,2011-07-08T03:42Z,Cheers.  What is the story behind the alternate covers?
,tavery80,2011-07-08T05:21Z,"Chuck: Playboy occasionally publishes alternate covers to either promote a different aspect of certain issues for regional interest or to make extra money from collectors.  Where available, I am including those alternates in the PDFs.

I use http://www.pbcovers.com as reference."
,Teos1950,2011-07-09T03:00Z,"Tav, Another great upload. I'm looking forward to the final decade.

I was looking through this decade and came across another issues that has some problems. March 1991 has a number of blanked out pages and parts of pages. It appears that the article titled ""The Killing of Jose Menendez has been blanked. This affected 13 pages starting at page 100. Since I know you pride yourself on your work, I thought you would like to know.

Cheers"
,tavery80,2011-07-09T03:45Z,"Teos1950: Same thing happened with the Charlize Theron pictorial in the May 1999 issue.  I purchased a copy, cut it apart, hand scanned the pages, cleaned them up and inserted them into the PDF file.  Probably either a right-to-publish-after-initial-run or digital rights problem since my source is the C2C drive.

Why Playboy didn't instruct the folks at Bondi to insert explanation text on each page, I have no idea.  I have the old MAD Magazine CD archive set and many of the older issues had articles/contributions from now-famous folks and if they couldn't secure permission to publish after-the-fact, they explain it on each page.

If I can secure a cheap copy, I'll hand scan and include in an updated issue torrent.

BTW...it has come to my attention that the Aug. 99 issue cover was altered on the C2C drive as well.  It doesn't mention ""Tomb Raider"" or ""Lara Croft"", they photoshopped the entire area and overlaid new text (some issues even had a sticker over that area).  I'll upload a corrected version of that issue as well.  No timelines, please....it's strictly dependent on securing the issues."
,chuckufarley,2011-07-09T05:10Z,"Thanks again for your meticulousness, tavery80.
Did the C2C end with '99 or '00 and will you post '00 this month to close it out?
"
,tavery80,2011-07-09T07:15Z,"Chuck: C2C contains thru Dec. 2009.  D/Ls have been infrequent for me lately, so I'll continue to post thru July.  2000 just posted."
,LesbianCloud69,2011-07-10T22:49Z,"I should have a copy for scanning next week. I'll also scan my stickered copy form my library file.

I'll have a look at my March 1991 too. See if it's scan-able without cutting."
,LesbianCloud69,2011-07-10T22:58Z,"Also: If one of you kingly ppl out there check the 50s mags, towards the back a coupon is ripped out. I cant remember which one. If you tell me I'll scan that page! :) 

I am a pedant! :)"
