,WvBrsci,2011-07-10T19:57Z,"You're thinking of ""Paranormal Activity"" (2007) and it's 2010 sequel. However, if you take the trouble to look it up on imdb, or some other movie encyclopedia other than your own head, you'll find that there is a movie with the title ""Paranoid Activity 2"", and that it was released in 2011.

In fact, if you look for it, you'll find that the http address to the imdb listing is provided by TvTeam, right on this page.

I have to say, this was VERY sloppy of you. You should get your facts straight before you make snide comments about respected groups on the scene. Even with straight facts, you'd do well to avoid being snide. It makes you come off as some ungrateful punk wannabe. However accurate, I'm sure it's not how you want to come off."
