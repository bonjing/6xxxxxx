Hip Hop fans who also enjoy the sounds of alternative rock group The Red Hot Chili Peppers will rejoice when they hear Pepper Spray, an EP release from A-Plus of Souls of Mischief/Hieroglyphics and production team Compound 7. The 7-song EP is a reimagining of some of the Red Hot Chili Peppersâ€™ most epic tracks as a backdrop for MCs A-Plus, Del and Knobody. The brainchild of Compound 7 member AAGEE (who suggested an EP release with production based entirely off the Chili Peppers), PEPPER SPRAY is a specialty project, according to A-Plus. 

â€œThe whole purpose is a Hip Hop tribute to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, inspired by their music and dedicated to their work. The cover is going to be a spin-off of one of their most popular covers â€“ itâ€™s a theme all throughout,â€ 
he explains. â€œThe songs are all topic-oriented, sonically as well as lyrically. Itâ€™s a conceptual EP, certainly. I donâ€™t want people to look at this like itâ€™s MY new album, itâ€™s something I worked on but itâ€™s obviously in a different lane,â€ emphasizes A-Plus. â€œIâ€™m stepping outside of my paradigm to do something new, different and artistic.â€ 
  
Standout cuts on Pepper Spray include Californication, which features Del. A-Plus explains the significance of Californication â€“ â€œThe way the song is set up, you have to hear it, its two verses then the beat changes, then the verses again, like a refrain. I instantly thought of Del after we finalized the beat. The subculture of California is snaky but its home, thatâ€™s what the Chili Peppersâ€™ song is about so I just rapped about what California is for me in the same way - the positive and negative.â€ 
  
Memories and experiences of tours & being on the road are a recurring theme of the Red Hot Chili Peppersâ€™ music as well as on Pepper Spray. â€œRoad Trippinâ€™ is a song about leaving to go on the road, and what it entails. Just being out from an artistâ€™s perspective and how itâ€™s a very hard but amazing job,â€ A-Plus reasons. â€œBy the Way is another song about being on the road, but more of a specific story, of our tour bus getting pulled over, smelling like weed, me getting arrested, itâ€™s a story â€“ theyâ€™re both tour-story oriented.â€ 
  
Pepper Spray, in drawing from one of the greatest alt-rock bands of this century and turning their sound into a Hip Hop format will undoubtedly draw new fans toward both genres of music and beyond. One thing is sure; Compound 7â€™s Pepper Spray is like nothing youâ€™ve heard before.
