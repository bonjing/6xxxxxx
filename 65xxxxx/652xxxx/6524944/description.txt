This download is meant for people (like me) who hate (or have no time) going through various Indie playlists every month. Running a bar I do this every month trying to find something nice (and new) for the customers. I usually end up with three lists.

1. Nice, clear and easy for people who like to talk while listening.
2. A bit louder for people who are not able to talk anymore (too crowded).
3. The ones I like myself and donâ€™t fit in one of the above categories.

Only the best (sounding) tracks are selected. They are in 100% clean and fully labelled MP3 VBR format. This might save you some time.

Enjoy and keep the Indie spirit high (by promoting, sharing and seeding).
