ITV are using the h264 HD stream to create the Mpeg2 SD stream and audio sync is always a problem with HD.

In VLC hitting the 'J' and 'K' keys shifts the audio by 50ms - try hitting 'J' 4 times to create a -200ms audio offset.

The audio comes back into sync later on. I'll have to check for this in future and encode using a different method."
