12  Monkeys 1995 900p En Es Fr Hu It Ru multisub [mkvonly]

This was meant to be at 5 MB/s video but somebody in the family typed (by mistake ) 800, while I was interrupted...I haven't realized only after 2 days when encode was done. I was shocked about the small size but then after playing it for curiousity I was shocked again how good this rip is ;-)
So instead of deleting it I thought some folks with slow internet will apreciate it.
