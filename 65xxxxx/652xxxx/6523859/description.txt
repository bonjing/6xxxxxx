Description......: Through remarkable home movies -- gathered from archives and attics and now seen for the first time  THE LOST 
		   KENNEDY HOME MOVIES tells the story of the children of Joseph and Rose Kennedy, as they grew up in the 1930s 
		   and 40s through November 1963, with scenes of the last weekend Jack and Jackie Kennedy spent with Caroline and 
		   John, Jr., just two weeks before Dallas.

		   These extremely-rare home movies, transferred to HD, create a revealing and emotional portrait of the "first 
		   generation" Kennedy family -- with warmth and humor in moments of sports and leisure, but also in scenes of 
		   reflection and exploration. The movies provide behind-the-scenes footage of the family at their Hyannis Port 
		   and Palm Beach homes, and on trips to Europe and Asia. Featured are never-before-seen home movies filmed by 
		   Robert and Ethel Kennedy in the early 1950s. This footage, shot by the Kennedys and their closest friends, 
		   allows viewers to experience the forces and personalities that shaped their lives as never before.

		   Interviews with family members of Kennedy friends who took home movies provide fresh anecdotes and colorful 
		   stories. Distinguished historians contribute new insights into this larger-than-life American family. 

Release Notes....: Much of this show is not HD but there are numerous HD interview scenes.
