,sefros,2011-07-09T06:58Z,is this the same as the starz show that premeired today?
,ears90,2011-07-09T07:15Z,"As I understand it, the UK version, which airs in a week, has a few different scenes. I hope someone skilled in video editing can combine the two to make a full episode."
,ears90,2011-07-09T07:16Z,"@sefros, yes, starz is advertising it as an original series under the name ""Torchwood: Miracle Day"""
,Feetback,2011-07-09T07:23Z," Thank You !  Woh hoo!!! -  Excellent Shows love this T.V.Series,  i m really glad this is still on,  keep eem coming! more ""Torchwood"" please:)"
,Jacoby1,2011-07-09T09:51Z,"Thanks for uploading - although I sem to be downloading at 3 kb/s and uploading at 11 kb/s. So, you know, a little extra seeding would be appreciated. Just an idea. Use it, don't use it. Would just be nice of people, is all."
,sefros,2011-07-09T12:30Z,"so this is the fourth season but first in the U.S.
does that mean I should watch the first 3 seasons to get a better back story?"
,ezemeat,2011-07-09T13:01Z,Yeah you probably should - they are pretty damn good as well
,jakeyplay,2011-07-09T18:15Z,is this real?
,Lunatekkk,2011-07-10T03:50Z,This seems to be just as good as the original 3 seasons... I love me some Capt. Jack!!!!
,tongi14,2011-07-10T04:16Z,"@ ears90 don't think there will be different scenes in the UK version, but maybe extra scenes due to no advert breaks"
,Jack14112,2011-07-10T05:02Z,"@sefros There is a back story, but it should still be easy to pick up from season 4. But you should still watch the other seasons."

,mammon78,2011-07-13T14:40Z,"why do americans always have to make their own version of tv shows and movies.  What's wrong with the original, just take the money they'd spend on making their version and give it to the original creators."
,evilborg,2011-07-14T13:13Z,"@mammon78 Americans didn't do anything and they certainly did not steal Torchwood.

The fact is that the BBC did not like the ratings it got so they sold the rights to Starz but they kept all the people that write the stories and all the directors.

The only thing that is different is the episode locations.

However I wonder if the UK version will have more steamy adult scenes they always had in the BBC versions."
,Daniccus,2011-07-15T09:14Z,"evilborg, your an idiot, a simple google would show you how wrong you are, its a coproduction between starz, the bbc, and another section of the bbc, they didnt sell off rights, they didnt only just keep the crew, the crew was the show, russell t davis is the head of the show, its not like they sold it and went, meh, ok, we will maybe keep that guy, also, the american version will have more graphic scenes in terms of nudity and violence since it is on starz which is known for ultra violence and sex, the uk version is edited to include more doctor who universe references and more uk references, but will be edited for violence and sex as captain jack is a children's hero because of doctor who and davis doesnt want to ruin that for children in the uk"
,Daniccus,2011-07-15T09:17Z,"also, the bbc didnt not like the ratings of torchwood, in fact since its beginning the show has every season gotten more and more popular with major increasing in its ratings, moving from bbc 3 to bbc 2 and then finally with children of earth to bbc where it made a giant hurdle in its ratings and became a massive success, the fact of the matter is the government cut the funding of the bbc by 30 percent or so and lots of cuts came to a lot of shows and to do miracle day on the budget they would of had it wouldnt of happened, that is why there is the tri coproduction, and starz is putting in the most money and that is why they get to broadcast first, im not even british, im canadian, i just know my facts instead of spewing random made up things as fact as you did"
,michael3taylor,2011-07-23T22:31Z,"The AVI file appears to be broken, I had to get VLC player to repair the file before I could play it."
,BreakfastHorror,2012-03-15T11:44Z,"This show isn't spectacular, but it'll keep that sci-fi sized hole filled for a bit so I'm not stuck re-watching old episodes of Doctor Who at least. This torrent seems to be great though, downloading pretty quickly, even on my not so amazing internet connection."
