Instructions:

-Extract the directories to your C:\\\\ directory (just the root of your hard drive). This is because of the way links work and I can\\\'t be assed to fix it.

-Go into (root)\\\\forums\\\\ and choose a forum. Keep clicking until you find files named \\\"page1\\\" \\\"page2\\\" etc. Open page1 with your browser of choice.

-It\\\'s kind of buggy but not unbearably.

-Unfortunately, it didn\\\'t cache the last page of each forum.

-This is a cache from a little while back, so it can\\\'t be traced back to me.

-Also, stuff like post dates and whatnot are removed so it can\\\'t be traced back to me.
