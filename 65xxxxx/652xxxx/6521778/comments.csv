Could you increase your upload speed a little bit, please? It's taking awfully long."
[V],DownTYU,2011-07-08T13:13Z,"My seeding speed is 25 mbps...enough to seed this film many times over...
Although the swarm has the whole movie 12 times.
So, instead of trying to whip the whole thing from me...if downloaders started uploading along with downloading..there would've been no problem with speed."
