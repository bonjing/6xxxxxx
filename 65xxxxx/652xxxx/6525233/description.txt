All of these sketches with Tim Conway are among his
guest appearances on The Hollywood Palace, a 1960s live
extravaganza that for 6 years was ABC's answer to 
The Ed Sullivan Show on CBS.

The guest hosts interviewing Tim in this selection of 
two-men routines include Bing Crosby, Gene Barry,
David Janssen, Phil Harris, Dale Robertson, 
and Ernie Anderson --- who was Conway's unofficial comedy partner 
for a while in the 1960s. Ernie replaced Lyle Waggoner 
as announcer on The Carol Burnett Show in 1974 -- not long
before Conway became a regular there.

Singer Kate Smith was host in one show, but 
she didn't participate in the comedy.
