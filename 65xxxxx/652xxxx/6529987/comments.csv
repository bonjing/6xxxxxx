,krad21,2011-07-25T09:03Z,"Thnx for the UP Slickinator. I've used this program before, but it seems to me that for the past couple of updates on version 8, it wont read my drives under ""Source"". It will recognize the drives under ""Target"", so I know the bug is not completely messed up. I can still read the dvd's via a player, and dvdshrink.
Any Ideas out there?"
[V],Slickinator,2011-07-26T13:03Z,"not sure man.....it has worked fine on my LG drive 
it would not show the drive under source it just says put in dvd and i put in dvd and it analizes it and then after a sec or so it says start and lets you choose what you want too do .........and has worked fine for this version for me tested on 4 discs and covenant was one that had a harder time analizing before and this time its faster and ready to go ....... maybe right click on computer and go to hardware and devices and click the + plus beside drives and under your dvd drive right click on your drive and uninstall and then restart computer and try program again and just put in a disc and see what happeneds good luck"
[V],Slickinator,2011-07-26T13:05Z,your computer will reinstall the drive drivers automaticly so no worries in windows
