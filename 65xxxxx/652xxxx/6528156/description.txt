This 1960 episode featured the first appearance 
of Denny Miller as Duke Shannon, who was only a 
recurring character that year -- in just 3 episodes.
A few months later he returned in "The Duke Shannon Story", 
where he changed his professional name to Scott Miller.
The following fall he became a regular, and I think he was 
another trail scout along with Flint.

After he quit WAGON TRAIN in 1964, he became 
Denny Miller again -- a name the man has kept ever since.
