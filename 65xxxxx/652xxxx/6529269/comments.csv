,crazyg0od33,2011-08-01T08:12Z,"Hi, I signed up just to ask a question...how do you guys get 5.1 surround 1080p vids to be so small in file size? My rips are like 20gb or more?
Thanks if you help"
,Yawako,2011-08-01T10:12Z,"Try Handbrake, In video set 2 pass it will help reduce the file size more without loosing the quality. it supports multiple audio try use passthru (untouched) and multiple (soft) subtitle for mp4 and mkv container and great thing is free :)"
,Sit3UserX,2011-08-02T19:34Z,Great quality. A/V 10/10. No complain at all. Thanks.
,alirezanoori,2011-08-12T10:44Z,Thanks a lot...
,Dragon8000,2011-08-15T17:26Z,thanks
,john8611,2012-02-11T08:45Z,"OK please note this is not a complaint in any way just my observation, but ive download lots of 720 and 1080 movies in lots of cases ive also downloaded the same same movie in both 1080 with large and small file sizes, like this small 3gig file and a larger 8gig file. OK they are both very good quality no complaints from me in any way, but to say a 3gig 1080p has no loss of quality isn't right in my opinion sorry, on this I c a lot of artefacts especially on the very dark scenes
Once again no complaint just my opinion
Thanks for the upload IceBane "
