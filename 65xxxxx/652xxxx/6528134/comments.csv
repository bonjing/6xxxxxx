[H],HeroMaster,2011-07-09T15:04Z,ENJOY Fast Five 2011 PPV better than TS Copy by PRESTIGE!
,plugboi,2011-07-09T17:19Z,hero do u know if it will play on ps3 thanks 
,hootieman,2011-07-09T18:08Z,This will in fact play on PS3 and 360. Just gotta know how to burn it right. Anything plays on consoles and DVD players. I use ConvertXtoDVD 4 and Ive burned every type of video file onto DVD-R. Always use -R and not -RW. PS3 and 360 has issues with RW's. 
,bukareddy,2011-07-09T19:14Z,A/V = ?
,bukareddy,2011-07-09T19:15Z,screens luk gud ! bt stil A/V = ?
,avolfan23,2011-07-10T00:11Z,V8 A8  It's in 4x3 format instead of widescreen...quality is pretty good...much better than a cam but not DVD.
