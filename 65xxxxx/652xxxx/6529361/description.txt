Chris was told by his mentor Roger Sanchez to build up his profile, and that is exactly what he is doing. With the success of â€œWork it to the boneâ€, â€ I wanna freak youâ€ and â€œOne more timeâ€ Chris made his introduction. However with the release of his smash bootleg of the Justice/Simian Mobile Disco hit â€œWe Are Your Friendsâ€, Chris Moody demanded the sceneâ€™s attention. The bootleg brought all eyes on Chris, as it appeared in Tiestoâ€™s top 20 of 2010. While Tiesto, Sanchez, and Swedish House Mafia are busy spinning the track, Chris is keeping busy in the studio remixing big projects for names like Roger Sanchez, Steve Angello, One Republic, and Tiestoâ€¦ just to name a few. Chris has also been collaborating with Muzzaik ,Riz and Roxy Alex Guesta on an upcoming, highly anticipated EP.
