1. This isn't 320. The source is iTunes it can't be 320, its not even upconverted to 320, its the iTunes standard 256! 

2. Probably not a good idea to leave the purchasers email address and name embedded in the file.

3. Thanks though, good track!"

Is it possible that you can upload the Chase and status set @ iTunes festival? I can't because I have a down- and upload limitation.. -.-'
Thanks a lot!! ;)"

It's probably possible to rip 320 from the 1080p video though."
