"This is a request" and This iso contains Prince Of Persia - The Two Thrones & Castlevania - Curse Of Darkness on 1 dvd5 disk just burn at 4x with your favorite burning program to a single dvd-5 disk. I tested this iso and it works with Esr,Swap Magic 3.6&3.8 and also ps2loader & usbadvance. 

Important: One more thing i almost forgot to mention for "castlevania" i had to re-encode/downsample etc.. whatever you wanna call it some of the cutscenes towards the end of the game to make both of these games fit on 1 dvd. Also with prince of persia the beginning is Has a little glitch it skips some of the beggining cutscene but besides that it works great.

How to use --- When you get to this screen "http://bayimg.com/MaIfnAADi" press x then it will show another screen with the name of the games choose which one you want to play click x on it then it will load. 

If you want to see more multiple ps2 games on 1 dvd please feel free to comment and ask me as i do take request.

Both games are NTSC.... and this is esr patched already
