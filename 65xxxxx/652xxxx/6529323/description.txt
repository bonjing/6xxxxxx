â€¢ Synopsis â€¢ 
James Blake enters SXSW facing expectations both high and low: On one hand, the
dubstep upstart with the heartbreaking voice â€” equal parts Antony and Aaron
Neville â€” is widely regarded as a breakout star for dubstep and a new standard
bearer for electronic music itself. On the other, Blake's music is so full of
silence and stillness that no one would be surprised if stage presence was a
secondary concern. He's a guy whose gig revolves around manipulating beats (and,
of course, his own vocals), and that often means sitting still and letting the
light show work its magic.
