,asmariamoon,2011-07-15T22:25Z,"@hails592 Episodes 23 and 24 have yet to be aired.  They're called Team Rocket VS. Team Plasma Parts 1 and 2, but due to the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan back in March, they haven't even been aired in Japan yet, which means we'll have to wait for them to be aired there before we get the dubs.  Sadly, according to Wikipedia and Bulbapedia, they've been postponed indefinitely, so we may never get them."

@ADDdog: thanks and keep up the good work :)"
