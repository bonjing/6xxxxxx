The island of Ambon in Indonesia, 1945. During the War, the number of Australian 
POWs on the island had dropped from 1100 to less than 300 due to abuses 
by their Japanese captors. Capt. Cooper is the chief prosecutor. In a mass grave, 
the bodies of 300 executed servicemen have been unearthed. Cooper assumes that the 
massacre was ordered by Baron Takahashi, Japanese commander on Ambon. But the one 
potential witness has gone mad and is due to be shipped back to Australia. 
No captured airmen were found alive on the island at all, not even the four-man 
crew of a reconnaissance plane shot down late in the War. Takahashi is returned to 
the island in the custody of an American officer, Maj. Beckett. But there is little 
evidence with which to prosecute the Baron. Cooper thinks he could make a case for 
the missing airmen if only their bodies could be located. And why does Maj. Beckett a
ppear interested in not seeing Takahashi convicted? Cooper gets a break 
when Lt. Tanaka, a communications officer and a Christian, surrenders himself...
