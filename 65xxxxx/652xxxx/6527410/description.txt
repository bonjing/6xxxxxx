A simple .RAR compilation I created with 3 movies in one file.  Compressed Shrek3 The Other Guys and Due Date all in one with 7zip.

I hadn't watched any of these movies in a while, I usually get good a:v quality.
Let me know what you think

I can do up to 6 movies in one 4.7gb or less .RAR file for making it perfectly suitable for a DVD-R. 



Thanks to all uploaders who keep bringing new content.  

I'll do some new movies sometime soon.
