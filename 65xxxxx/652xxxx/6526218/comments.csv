,meev,2011-10-05T09:09Z,"Obviously you'll have to use it with Unison 2.1.5, no longer available from Panic's website. Google for that. This patcher doesn't work with latest versions."
,9enisp,2012-02-23T21:37Z,"This worked flawlessly for me. For those having trouble, try the following:

1. Download and install Unison 2.1.5 from their website here.  http://www.panic.com/museum/unison/older/.

2. Open the ""unison.2.1.5-ipatch.app"" contained in this torrent.

3. Use the ""unison.2.1.5-ipatch.app"" to choose or drag & drop your official Unison 2.1.5 app.

4. The unison.2.1.5-ipatch will take care of the rest and notify you when it's finished.

5. Enjoy Unison as normal."
