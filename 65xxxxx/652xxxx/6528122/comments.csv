question for you - are your pitch black and riddick torrents the unrated dir cuts 0r theatrical?"
[T],bobnjeff,2011-07-10T13:33Z,man i have a hard time remembering what i did yesterday. i really don't remember i believe they are rentals from netflix.you can do a time comparison for a better answer but i believe they are dir cut .but don't quote me on that

looks like pitch black may be the dir cut but the imdb info and the bdinfo you posted for riddick file both say 119min which has to be the theatrical.
