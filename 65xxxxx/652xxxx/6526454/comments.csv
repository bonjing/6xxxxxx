,thomas.p,2011-07-30T12:09Z,"Hey guys!

Does anyone know where I can get hold of a European map for Navigon? 

This torrent has maps divided into different countries which are creating problems for me. Then you can not add a route between several different country. I therefore need a comprehensive map of all of Europe. Available to CoPilot but can not find it for Navigon: ("
,devil75,2011-07-30T17:30Z,"im having no problems adding a route between several different country, but it would be rather expensive due to the data roaming."

,re1850,2011-09-08T18:23Z,"Make sure you got the ""Mobile Data Connection"" enabled...and GPS activated before you open Navigon...if not you will get the error message..""process.com.navigon.navigator_checkout_eu40""..you should not need to use Wifi for this...only mobile data,and that is only for starting the software....no data is needed transferred while in use...so don't worry about big bills for internet-usage!!...it works perfect on My LG Optimus 2X...."
,14U,2011-09-09T06:06Z,"HELLO: DON'T SPEND YOUR TIME ON THIS "" NAVIGON"" PROGRAM, IT'S WILL NEVER WORKS PROPERLY ON YOUR ANDROID. Do the following.

,bifbof,2011-09-12T16:11Z,Tried to use maps in Copenhagen. It was just one big desaster. I use copilote instead now. That works
,leffe72,2011-09-13T23:31Z,"Now I have tried it on 4 Android phones: Sony Ericsson Arc, Sony Ericsson Neo, LG Optimus x2 and Samsung Galaxy Sii with the same SHlT. It doesn't work if you don't have data enabled. BAD!!! "
,leffe72,2011-09-14T22:38Z,"@re1850 Just a little update. I did what you said. I enabled Mobil Data Connection and used this program. It worked good and it didn't cost a thing. Thank man, you're MY HERO!!! 
Finally I got it working :) "
,matorado,2011-09-15T07:47Z,"This navi works OK on my Samsung Galaxy Ace. I downloaded the program and sound and maps just for 1 country to check it first. I installed it and the program asked me to install Navigon Fresh software on my PC (with simple registration), connect phone to PC, then I chose ALL the maps I wish to have and the software installed it to the phone. Now works great.
Thank you Jmep ;))"
,leffe72,2011-09-16T12:07Z,"Actually after using if for few days now with the mobile data enabled, it worked fine BUT it needs some data and it costs and not just a little bit but about 2 Euros disappeared a day. Not as ""re1850"" says unfortunately. I'll stop using it as I don't have free surf plan and I'll use CoPilot instead... "
,mirkamp,2011-09-17T10:46Z,"It is true that you get the defoult with de checkout.eu40 while not using data connection. When its running you can get data of and it works. Without data it crash but you can solved in by start of the navigon real quick en when its crash restart it quick again, you can do it like 3 times and than it works. Thats my solution"
,re1850,2011-09-24T23:57Z,"leffe72: This software will NOT use any data transferred while use of navigation, only for the startup (checking version and registration info) I bet there is other app's on your phone that is checking for updates that makes your cost's. Are you sure you have un-checked the auto-update in your phone-settings? On my phone( Optimus 2X) there is no such costs as 2Euros for the use of Navigon..."
,re1850,2011-09-25T00:00Z,...and by the way...if you use some data-counter-app/widget..you will see for yourself how much data is transferred...
,leffe72,2011-09-25T22:42Z,"@ re1850 

I'm not 100% sure that there are no applications that have auto-update but I have unchecked many Background data and Push and all the things I could think of. No Auto Sync either but as I said not 100% sure that I've unchecked them all. 

However I've just got it done to my phone today that my little brother, who's very good with these thing, has made something that "" I get root access"" not sure though how he did it. After that I installed Permission Denied and Superuser from android market. In the Permission Denied app I scrolled down to Navigon and there are 15 accesses. I clicked on 5 of them, that require either Internet or Wi-Fi which are 5 of them. After that I pressed the Menu and chose Reboot. Now it works GREAT with no data, Wi-fi or any Internet access required. 

Thanks by the way, I'll try data-counter-app/widget. "

,koenvhaver,2011-10-09T19:40Z,"Hello, I have downloaded and tried different options but always the problem with ""navigator_checkout_eu40. Even with wifi on and mobile data on. Now i have downloaded permissions denied like leffe72 said, but I am scared to download superuser ""virus warning""."
,koenvhaver,2011-10-09T19:49Z,Is superuser free of viruses? I am hesitating to install it. I am following the instructions from leffe72.
,leffe72,2011-10-09T21:38Z,"Yes, superuser is free from virus, I have it installed on 2 devices a Galaxy Gio and a Galaxy Sii. "
,koenvhaver,2011-10-10T09:40Z,Thanks for your reaction leffe72 but first I have to root my mobile phone to use superuser and permissions denied and I don't risk it to do that. I have read all the instructions to root my wildfire and it's too complicated and too risky.

I have tried sygic too and it worked fine. But I just had to have Navigon, I had it when I was a stupid iPhone user... 

Yes I agree, rooting your phone is tricky and I have it done to my phone, I have no idea how to do it. Besides I've heard that it might void your warranty so hopefully my Samsung will continue working... "
,matsjoo,2011-10-24T15:28Z,"Works excellent on my Galaxy Mini. Did it just like Matorado. 1 country is activated, the rest of europe is downloading using FRESH. When I should experience any trouble i will let you know. Jmep Thnx!"

,kokolo7,2011-12-13T18:42Z,"it doesn't work without data transfer and licence check... I doesn't use much of data and doesn't cost much but, it is simply not practical...
