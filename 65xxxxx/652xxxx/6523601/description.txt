 "Hispanics and the Future of America" presents details of the complex story of a population that varies in many dimensions, including national origin, immigration status, and generation. The papers in this volume draw on a wide variety of data sources to describe the contours of this population, from the perspectives of history, demography, geography, education, family, employment, economic well-being, health, and political engagement. They provide a rich source of information for researchers, policy makers, and others who want to better understand the fast-growing and diverse population that we call 'Hispanic'. The current period is a critical one for getting a better understanding of how Hispanics are being shaped by the US experience.This will, in turn, affect the United States and the contours of the Hispanic future remain uncertain.
