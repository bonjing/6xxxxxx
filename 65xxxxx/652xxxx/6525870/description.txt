has managed no less than 8 Top Ten hit productions, a feat that has lead to him becoming
one of the most in demand remixers/producers in the industry and firmly established him
amongst the continent's leading acts...

the tools of his trade alongside various famous bands, producers, studio musicians and
sound engineers.
Having released over 20 EP's throughout 2004-2005, Olivier began to gain support &
recognition from a host of major DJ's & artists including the likes of Carl Cox, Misstress
Barbara, Chris Liebing, Umek, Marco Bailey, Dave Angel and Green Velvet amongst many
others...
The release of the "Jamon y Queso" EP in 2006 saw his career really take off, with instant
creditation coming from worldwide dj's such as the legendary Sven Vath and one of Olivier's
own longtime John Acquaviva... Indeed, it was Acquaviva himself who signed Olivier's next
release entitled "Walking on The Moog" to his own label : Definitive Recordings... a track that received international acclaim and went on to become Olivier's first Beatport Top Ten hit!
