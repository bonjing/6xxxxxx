DigiProtect (Germany) is copyright holder for most of those shitty Trance files (like Groove Coverage - Angeline). They do scan all torrents and contact your ISP with the law. Will cost you about 350-400 Euro (in Europe) .

Cleary a *trap* to make cash for copyright holders (DigiProtect). If you are in Europe and you want to stay out of troubles do avoid this torrents - 

Keep downloading this if you arent concerned with copyright holders -

And by the way, downloading illegal stuff isn't illegal! Distributing it is... so to all people: Just download and enjoy this fine torrent which is completely safe!"
