Dash 9 Locomotive RailWorks Addon

Debuting in 1993, the C44-9Ws proved very popular with many North American railroads featured in this Add-on.

Over their production life, the Dash 9s have amounted to almost 2500 units across more than 10 operators on 3 continents around the world. Sadly these numbers are diminishing all the time as this power-horse is replaced by a more efficient model known as the Evolution Series. Due to stricter emissions requirements introduced in 2005, the production of the Dash 9 was replaced by the GE ES44DC.

Experience one of the greatest workhorse locomotives of modern North American freight with the Dash 9 Locomotive Add-on for RailWorks.
