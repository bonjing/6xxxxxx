,quirkynature,2011-07-27T13:26Z,Legit download. Just waiting on a crack.
,Preddy,2011-07-27T13:28Z,"This might need ""DragonAge2.exe"" modification and 
-deda2drm da2_prc_drk ""decrypt key""-

For deda2drm we need decrypt key from somebody who ordered the da2legacy.

It can be dump keys from these exes.
slurpda2.exe
slurpdakeys.bat "

I have set RequiresAuthorization=""1"" to ""0"" in all my dlcÂ´s 

Plz help."
,skylarkwings,2011-07-28T16:43Z,"I get a pop up saying ""Legacy requires Dragon Age II to be installed first"" or something like that. I have DA2 installed, and it's in my add/remove programs list too. 

I even tried running the legacy installer with DA2 running in the background, to which I got another popup saying ""please close DA2 and all its components"". Then I tried again after closing the game but the first pop up appears again.

Any advice on this?"

--------------------------------------------

I done this:

Add (without brackets):
""rem Legacy
deda2drm.exe da2_prc_drk 4401-685A-21E3-68EC-C704-DB70-B98B-0D46""

Save. Run decrypt_dlc.bat as Administrator.

But I cant find the manifest file that you are talking about..... any help?"
,Syteri,2011-07-29T01:55Z,The manifest should either be in the Installation Directory or in My Documents. Check the Dragon Age My Documents folder or its Installation Directory (Sounds redundant...)
,monster47,2011-07-31T07:03Z,guys it works no crack needed woohoo
,tyswr465,2011-08-02T09:10Z,"Hey, I patched 1.03 and I set the authorization to ""0"" (followed Esteem's steps), but when I start Legacy I get a ""cannot load area"" error message, and it puts me back at the main menu. Have tried uninstalling/reinstalling but I keep gettting the same error. Help?"
,tyswr465,2011-08-03T19:23Z,"Thanks Tomemkd, but my system meets the system requirements easily. What puzzles me is that I can easily play the normal Dragon Age 2 on high settings, as well as Sebastian's DLC and all of the other DLC easily, but as soon as I attempt to start Legacy by examining the status, I get a ""unable to load area"" error. 

I have Legacy in my ""installed downloadable content"" in the main menu, and it's authorized, so I know it's installed correctly, and I also meet the standard system specifications for the game as well. I've patched to v1.03 and everything as well. Yet, I get an odd ""unable to load game area"" error and get booted back to the main menu whenever I attempt to start Legacy by clicking the statue. 

Does anyone know why this is happening?"
,tyswr465,2011-08-08T07:22Z,"Could anyone please help me out - I really would like to play this DLC, but I keep getting the same error message. "
,ds0bz19,2011-09-01T03:10Z,When i tried editing manifest.xml it says access denied ... what can i do ? anyone ?
,Meesaw,2011-09-09T13:41Z,"@ds0bz19

The same thing happened to me (access denied) but it worked after I took ownership of the file. 
It's really simple, you can search for it on google if you're not sure what to do."
