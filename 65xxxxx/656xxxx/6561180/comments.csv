Thank you for all of these rugby games you upload and in such a timely manner.  It's a shame the US doesn't get any of these games. "
,ambrouille,2011-07-24T14:00Z,"Thank you so much, it's not easy to find those games in France as well :). And quality of video is perfect ! You rock !"
,grainofsand,2011-07-25T02:55Z,"Another fantastic up. Cannot say thank you enough for your efforts mate.

Cheers."

Hope to get the rest of the Tri Nations from you."
,ACMMW,2011-07-30T09:18Z,Awww... Thanks shemyaza. If I could reach you I would kiss you. Now I no longer need to suffer the bogans and bad beer at the local tavern only to watch the rugby with no sound if it is on at all. (bloody victorians and their silly aussie rules)

Keep up the good work"
