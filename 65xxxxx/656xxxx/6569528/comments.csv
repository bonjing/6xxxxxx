,kathykat63,2011-07-31T01:27Z,"Hoping this works out!  Usually avoid MKV that seems to glitch out, but I am no super genius about encoding.  Nice balance between file size and good quality.  VLC (an old open source fave!) is supposed to handle MKV and downloaded CCC.  Am I on the right track?  

Anyway, +++ to MitZep +++ who encourages feedback and SEED!  Catch you on that fb link. (-:  "

,mzona,2011-08-06T20:10Z,"Quality and sound are impressive for a 760MB File. Had some trouble opening it with MPClassic and DivX though. I'm no genius in encoding either. However, worked well in VLC. Good for me. "
,rituvendra,2011-08-07T12:44Z,The print's good enough and the sound's fine too. I'd say A/V - 9/9
