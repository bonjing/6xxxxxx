Arguably the most famous railroad in the world and perhaps the most recognized livery ever applied to a locomotive, 3DTrains is pleased to present these beautiful Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe passenger F-Unit locomotives recreated for Rail Simulator and RailWorks in stunning detail.

Santa Fe began taking delivery of passenger F7s in A-B-B-A lash-ups in September 1949. The initial order of locomotives, designated 37-Class, were delivered with 36 inch dynamic brakes and horizontal grilles, and were numbered 37LABC through 41LABC.

Santa Fes 300-Class locomotives, delivered in October 1949, were identical in appearance to the 37-Class units, except they were configured in 3-unit A-B-B sets, numbered 300LAB through 305LAB. That these were 3-unit sets was the only reason why these locomotives were assigned a separate class.

Included with the ATSF 37-Class and 300-Class passenger locomotives are early "as delivered" and late as modified by Santa Fe shop variations.
