[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-28T16:52Z,"Youre welcome.

I try, IDW is kind of sporadic with their release dates and their website is useless - But as soon as I find a new issue I Up it. :D"
,MAGIC_HATE_BALL,2011-07-31T06:11Z,Did I ever tell you that I love you MrDowntown?

,sheol99,2011-08-10T06:47Z,"Thanks.  But the file naming is bit confusing with those vol2 and vol3. I think your torrent title is right V3#3, but your file name v2#3 is wrong.
Again thanks! "
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-08T22:41Z,"Yeah the file is misnamed & I didnt catch it until I posted. Cobra Civil War is Volume 3 of Cobra, but since the numbering from vol 1 continued into vol 2 - I guess you could argue the fact..."
