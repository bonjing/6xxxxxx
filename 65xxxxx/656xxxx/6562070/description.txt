Welcome to Drift City - your action-packed racing game!

At Drift City you put the pedal to the metal in the future ... but the prospects look pretty bad. There are almost no more oil reserves.

How will anyone survive without this vital raw material? Creative scientists recently discovered a completely new source of energy on an isolated Pacific island - the "Mittron". It's an excellent new fuel! It doesn't take long before everyone starts to mine the "Mittron". 

What to do:
-You can do missions, deliveries, huv chases, racing and much more.
-You can buy and sell parts in the Auction House (Level 30+)
-You can party up with friends and do things like HUV chasing and patrol together.
-You can join crews and race with your crew in Channel Battle.
-Make friends and have fun with them!

You can choose more than 75 cars, with 8 ST cars, 7 BT cars and 3 special cars(Sora GT, Leopard and RunnerR). 9 car levels, each with better stats.
This game is for free, but you can spend money on extra items like inventory expand, drinks and upgrades.
5 Islands: Moon Palace, Koinonia, Cras, Oros and Mittron City.

Have fun!
