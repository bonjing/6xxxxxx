    In this made for TV film, an enormous and angry bigfoot creature         
    begins to terrorize a Colorado Ski Resort during a winter carnival,      
    by eating several skiers. At first everyone insists it is just a         
    bear, until ski patrolman Tony Rill sees a white shadowy beastly         
    shape disappearing into the woods. Although Tony's grandmother Mrs.      
    Carrie Rill, who owns the Ski Resort and the town sheriff, Sheriff       
    Paraday disagree, it soon becomes clear when the creature finally        
    attacks the town.
