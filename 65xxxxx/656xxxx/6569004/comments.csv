,aarque,2011-07-30T15:00Z,"uploader, you must connect your bit torrent client to the internet long enough for several of us to get the full upload, after that, the community will seed it for you.
If you can't seed your own torrents, you haven't shared anything and this empty torrent will expire."

For the peolpe who doesn't know how to install, simply give the file a new name and write .exe at the end so your computer perceives it as a program :)"
,zurgda,2011-09-16T02:08Z,"Thanks uploader66!

@hini29 & bluuuey
There is a problem with UT 2.08 failing to start after June 1st 2011. You could try setting your date back on the computer to some time before June 1st and then see if the UT2 app starts. If so, then you can either do that to configure UT2 and then set it back afterwards to run FSX (most report this works), or you'll need to hunt down the 2.09 hotfix which is supposed to resolve this.

UT2 apparently also gets upset if it finds aircraft in your simobjects folder which have an empty ui_variation= line in their aircraft.cfg file. This used to cause the SelectedIndex error notice.

A couple of things there that may or may not help."
