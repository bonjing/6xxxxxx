The British Rail Class 02 is an 0-4-0 diesel-hydraulic shunting locomotive built by the Yorkshire Engine Company between 1960 and 1961. A diminutive locomotive with a short wheelbase (1.83m), the 02 was designed especially for use in yards with a restricted loading gauge or with tight track curvatures. It was fitted with a Rolls Royce 6-cylinder diesel engine producing 170 horsepower, and its low gearing gave it a top speed of 19 miles per hour.

Only 20 examples were built, and the type had only a relatively short service life with the last being withdrawn from service in the mid-1970s. However, many 02s were purchased by private companies and continued working for their new owners for many years, and 7 remain in preservation today
