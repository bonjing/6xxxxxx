,busterthefox,2011-11-02T22:37Z,"I know a lot of people have been waiting for a long time for this. I just made some changes that will hopefully get it to start seeding better because it wasn't really trying before.

Oh, and now that I know more about scrubbing and stuff, it's NOT scrubbed, because scrubbing files is obsolete now. XP"
,busterthefox,2012-01-25T01:18Z,"I've re-uploaded this in a better format, and it already has a few other seeders. Better version here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6966786/Negima___Neo_Pactio_Fight___[Wii]_[NTSC-J]

I'm no longer even trying to seed this version... Go to the above link if you actually want to finish downloading and play this game. :3"
