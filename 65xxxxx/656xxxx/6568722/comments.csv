Plot : The Autobots learn of a Cybertronian spacecraft hidden on the Moon, and race against the Decepticons to reach it and to learn its secrets. 


Notes: Right here we go with version 2 from the german pfd source which was very nice,just changed a few things to make it look even better and yes prime is blue like he's ment to be
      The audio is the same line from inagine that we used for v1 i just had to sync and mux it"
