Playboy magazine August 1999.  PDF file.

All issues complete, including ads, editorial content, etc.

NOTE: The original cover included references to "Tomb Raider" and Lara Croft".  These references were photoshopped out of the Playboy C2C HD archived cover page.  This abridged pdf file includes the original published cover as well.

Thanks again to LesbianCloud69 for the scan.
