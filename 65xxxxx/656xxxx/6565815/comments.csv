8 of 10 stars - One of the very fine comic films with Pierre Richard
2 September 2000 | by Mario Bergeron (Cap-de-la-Madeleine, Canada)

Pierre Richard made a lot of very good comic films between 1970 and 1990, and I think he's among the greatest comic stars of the history of French cinema, along with Christian Clavier, Louis DeFunes, Fernandel and Bourvil. Under the direction of Edouard Molinaro, Yves Robert, GÃ©rard Oury, the great great Francis Veber or Pierre Richard himself, the comedian shows us a ordinary-guy character, clumsy, sometimes shy, full of good intentions, but not where he should be. He looks a bit like the characters Harold Lloyd played in the silent-movies era. Most of these films are short (1 hour 30) and full of very funny jokes. A lot of them were badly remade by Hollywood: Le grand blond, La chÃ¨vre, Le jouet, Les compÃ¨res, Les fugitifs. This one was not his most popular film of the 1970's, but it's one of my favorites. Pierre Richard plays a photographer who madly wants to be a movie director, and he agrees to adapt a melodrama, written by one of his friends, into a porn movie. Lots of very funny dialogues and hilarious situations. And for a +, see charming young Miou-Miou playing the girlfriend of Pierre Richard.
