[T],ILPruny,2011-07-25T18:52Z,"that is because of the videosource 720p insnt good, all the rest are encoded from that."
,festisio,2011-07-25T20:23Z,"so essentially what you have done is picked up a shit, eaten it and then shitted it out again."
[T],ILPruny,2011-07-25T21:14Z,"you are probably retarded, this is not my encode, the audio delay is not that big.
Why dont you upload a better one?"
