Thank you for this film.

i was woundering if by any chance you are a fan of Laurel and Hardy as i am a big fan of them myself, i have most of their films and their solo's but i do have a few requests of those that i am unable to get:

should Tall Men Marry?, Scorching Sands, crazy like a fox, Wandering Papas, Mum's The Word, Mighty Like A Mouse, the bakery, love and duty, Angora love, zenobia and air raid wardens.
Appreciate your work man. If anyone have any of these great classics. please seed! Thnx. "
,geuheo28,2011-07-29T16:21Z,"picture and audio quality is very good, but for me the picture occasionally slows downa bit, im not sure if its the file or something in my configuration but this is the only file i have ever seen it happen. But the hardcoded subs are fuckin awful...whoever made them had zero understanding of the english language...its basically a word for word translation using google translate...90% of it makes no sense - and since you cant get rid of em, id suggest gettin another copy"
,xeusoi16,2011-07-29T16:41Z,dont know why you'd want it because it sucks!
,MINZEZ,2011-07-29T16:56Z,"OK. For all those calling it FAKE ... and those that believe them.
There has been a flood of anti piracy pricks on all torrent/P2P etc sites recently. With the lawsuit against newzbin there will be more of this coming and a possibility that more sites will befall the same fate.

This is a small list of those that are more than likeley hired by large corporations (sony etc) to ""discourage"" you from downloading illegally kietio136, leevea32, qauwua188. But this guy ""niiwea74"" takes the biscuit. Apparently scenebalance has never posted anything before??? Nor is the account a trusted one??? I quote
""weird, searching on google gives a whole bunch of posts with this same name on all kinds of torrent sites but not much else while searching imdb gets no results at all so it aint a new movie. wonder what it's meant to be, i'll certainly be curious to take a look once a trusted or vip account uploads it but i aint risking an uploader whos never posted anything before, :/""
Not only are there no REAL copys of this film out lol but the film doesn't exist LMFAO (see above quote)
So to all those wondering if this is real. YES. YES. YES. YES. ITS FUCKING REAL. IT EXISTS! lol. might not be the best quality but it fucking exists and is real. So FUCK all you FAKE BITCHES that have claimed and will claim that it is not.
P.s. The same copy and pasted comments can be found on most of the trusted uploaders files now and will spread to others. For all those that don't know a skull means its GOOD to download 99.99999999999999999999999999999% of the time. They do fuck up you know. No one is perfect. 
SHIT! I just copy and pasted. I must be working for them :P lol"
,seeloa81,2011-07-29T23:51Z,fake!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

thank you very much"
,freddy__B,2011-08-08T13:17Z,"very fast download, nice picture , audio is oke.
people who are still complaining, go to rent the movie or Shut Up and wait till a dvd/br rip comes out.   ill rate it   9V   7A   ,  nice Job"
,Taigazz,2011-08-09T00:21Z,"wow... cant u guys actually grade the V/A quality correctly? if you're not comparing it to HD quality, how am i gonna get a base of reference?
by judging the screenshots, i say:
V: 6 (okay resolution, brightness is off)
and for those of you that say stop complaining, i say i have the right to express my complaints, because i have to right to tell others my opinion and to promote/denounce it. And I WILL wait for a blu-ray rip"
,mastermind17,2011-08-17T17:13Z,good quality!
,HK88,2011-08-20T12:13Z,"All those believing the ""FAKE"" bullshit, those posts are created by bots programmed to troll torrent sites. ALL of these so called posters all have the same username layout consonant, vowel, vowel, consonant, vowel, vowel, number, number and possibly third number. TPB has been flooded with these posts DO NOT BELIEVE THEM!! If there's a skull and bones next to the uploaders name its a good torrent.    "
,jekrump,2011-09-25T02:37Z,"While I agree that this one is real, and the quality is good. Today I received the cease and desist letter from my internet provider for this exact file. (I do run peerblocker) so, I don't know what to think... the file is legit, and I have it. but there's the truth."
