People have been doing the same things on computers for years.
 Clicking. Scrolling. Installing. Saving.
 With OS X Lion, weâ€™ve challenged the accepted way of doing things by introducing new features that change the way you use a computer.
 Multi-Touch gestures transform the way you interact with your Mac, making all you do more intuitive and direct.
 Now an even richer Multi-Touch experience comes to OS X Lion.
 Enjoy more fluid and realistic gesture responses, including rubber-band scrolling, page and image zoom, and full-screen swiping.
 OS X Lion offers systemwide support for gorgeous, full-screen apps that use every inch of your Mac display.
 You can have multiple full-screen apps open at once â€” along with multiple standard-size apps. And itâ€™s easy to switch between full-screen and desktop viewsâ€¦
