[T],Tyr3ll,2011-07-27T01:18Z,"humm really ?
Do you really think team iNDISO would share a fake version ? interesting....
I don't think so dude...
they never shared any fake ISO as far as i know.
Well,you know,this team is serious and is well known since long time now,sure.
One of my friends have installed it and all works fine anyway.this is a repacked version but this one works also without any problem.
Download it and install it and after go back here and let me know if it is a fake or wrong version,right ?
Btw,what do you mean by wrong version so ?
could you please develop more ?
this dmg image file is ok anyway and permits 
a real installation so what ?
What do you want to more ? huh ?
as far as i know it is not a pre beta version,right ?
If you don't believe me i suggest you to directly ask to team iINDISO.I'm convinced and sure they will enjoy your question...
Any feedback will still be welcome,sure !
I always check any iso before sharing on torrent 
it is perfectly burnable and openable with UltraISO
who supports dmg image file.
I will wait for others complains if there will have more than yours and then i will  try to explain what problem might occur in this version.
I personaly don't have a MAC but i have few friends who have some.
regards"
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-07-27T02:26Z,"I repeat :
open it only with UltraISO and burn it from UltraISO as well.
Btw,there is a strange issue :
i discovered it now and yeah,it is strange !
this dmg file cannot be opened with PowerISO
and i cannot explain why as PowerISO supports perfectly dmg file also.very strange issue so...
Anyway with UltraISO,all is fine,all folders and sub folders contained into this dmg file are perfectly visible and valid.
so i suggest you to follow my tips and all should be perfectly ok.
I'm currently downloading a possible fixed version about this strange issue.once i will get this new one i will learn you more about then.
sorry again for this strange issue !
regards"
,ninjahimself,2011-07-27T17:38Z,ill try this iso on virtual box on my AMD 9950 rig....
,ninjahimself,2011-07-27T19:43Z,"Mac.OS.X.Lion.dmg - the file header is corrupt
Cannot find volume mac.os.x.lion.part75.r00

linux rar is touchy, looks like the files were renamed."
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-07-28T20:08Z,"i downloaded two other same versions with direct dmg file.crc32 is exactly the same and for all of these three dmg files crc32 does match perfectly !
i think it is not a bootable version but not sure !
I downloaded three other version supposed to be as retail from Apple store and the results is even bader again.none of them is readable or openable with powerISO or UltraISO...
I currently download another retail from Apple store but not from here anyway.
I will see and will make a comparison between each version i have so.
the normal true retail from Apple store is called :
InstallESD.dmg right now. 
If you burn and open mine with UltraISO only,it should work anyway.Works for me so why not for the others ppls as well ?
I'll be back again to update this curious affair then.
regards"
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-07-28T20:10Z,"does anybody else got this specific problem too ?
does anybody has successfully installed it already ?"
,pnehem,2011-07-31T07:21Z,"Downloading now, will have my room mate try it out on his Intel Mac to see how it checks out."
,pnehem,2011-07-31T07:23Z,Forgot to add Thanks Try3ll for the upload and work checking out the problem you have come across.
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-08-01T12:15Z,"ahhhh cool bro !
thx to confirm it aswell anyway ! :)
i'm not completely insane so :p
right now,you will have to decide for yourself so !
i don't force you to download it as well anyway !
but i repeat : it works !
however i have another version who seems working also !
let me know if someone desire i up the new one
as comparison so.
Ty again for feedback users,as still much appreciated
by far as well as multi-seeders help for my torrents.
best regards"
,cedders,2011-08-01T21:13Z,"I haven't yet downloaded this torrent, but I do know from experience that PowerISO does not work with dmg files which are compressed. I don't know about UltraISO because I don't use it.

Hope this helps, and tahnks for the upload."
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-08-02T16:46Z,"Thx for the tips bro !
very usefull !!!
i understand better now why so :)
you will be still welcome here dude
any constructive feedback is still extremely positive and permits to each of us to increase our personal knowledge so.A good thing anyway :)
cheers"
,buky30,2011-08-04T19:12Z,Is it possible to install updates if I download this?
,punty,2011-08-06T05:37Z,downloading now for test...
,64base,2011-08-06T08:19Z,"Tyre3ll thanks man! I'll try this after I download and seed for a year (I have unlimited bandwidth, i barely touch 1%) how do i get UltraISO (is it for mac) and will i lose anything if the update doesnt work? Thanks again"
,TheMadJack,2011-08-06T12:15Z,"The .dmg file does NOT work with VirtualBox.

Wrong header file error.

Hopefully there's a way to convert it to .iso with UltraISO."
,TheMadJack,2011-08-06T12:29Z,Even after conversion it won't load. Bah.
,64base,2011-08-06T13:33Z,"has anyone tried this? judging from what you guys are saying it doesnt work, anyways does this install from scratch (ie erases whole harddrive) or is it an upgrade that works without partitioning?"
,64base,2011-08-06T16:13Z,"Ok I have just tried this on my MacBook (late 2007) on 10.6.8(legit version):

1-I downloaded through Transmission
2-Unpacked the far files into a dmg file with ""The Unarchiver"" (found free in Mac AppStore)
3-Used Disk Utility to burn the .dmg file into a 4.7gb DVD
4-Removed DVD and put it back in
5-Double clicked DVD, ran ""Install Mac OSX Lion""
6-It downloaded some files
7-Restarted automatically, then a 30 minute installation
8-Rebooted and...
9-I have now successfully installed Mac OSX Lion!

P.S. Tyr3ll: use DiskUtility found on a Mac (it takes around an hour to burn, but its the safest way)"
,Kamori,2011-08-08T02:45Z,I upgraded from OSX Snow Leopard (10.6.8) to this and it worked perfectly. All I had to do was unrar the files with UnRarX and installed via the .dmg file--no burning or disc needed. Works great.
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-08-13T16:46Z,"Yes,i tested also with it and it works too,absolutely !
follow tips from latest feebacks just a little up more than my messages,and you will get sucessfull instalation anyway !
this image is valid and works fine !
you just only need to know and understand how to proceed within...  
all is ok as i never modified something about
ty again to all users for confirm it ! :)
best regards mates and enjoy and have fun ;)
cheers"
,ziadamrlabib,2011-08-14T08:50Z,"Can i burn this to a dvd then install it?
i have windows 7 right now.
if i can, will i be able to dual boot it?
if all that is possible can you tell me how?
i use transmac right?"
,AkaPhsyco,2011-08-22T05:32Z,"What's the deal with UltraIso, is it PC specific? And if so why did you use it instead of the many other iso programs that aren't? (I'm not complaining, ty for torrent and all, just legitimately curious about how you made it). "
,AkaPhsyco,2011-08-22T10:19Z,"Oh, and I get that you tried PowerISO, and you don't personally have a mac, but was Ultra just the next one up or is there something that sets it apart?

ALSO: I have a strange feeling to upgrade to this you need, Snow Leopard ie 10.6 or better?"
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-08-24T11:46Z,"@ziadamrlalib
Well i'm not exactly sure about
@akaphsyco
yes,you need snow leopart 1.6.8
Well i truly agree as i don't have any mac computer,and yes,on windows i especially love powerISO and UltraISO as they both have very
nice options and utilities
UltraISO have better options for Mac osx than PowerISO anyway.
Btw,many thanks for all tips provided by certain
guys here
Still nice to share personal knowledge and skill anyway.This is like i like because it is very positive and constructive as well
Ty for that mates :)
cheers"
,Jdwcomic,2011-08-26T15:40Z,I tried burning with disk utility and the disk came out blank but with used memory and not finalized do i need anything burned besides the .dmg file? i'm fairly new to mac and need a bit of assistance thanks
,teajon,2011-09-01T18:29Z,Guys can this be installed from USB? New on the mac thingy. . . Thanx XD

,asprague,2011-09-14T02:09Z,Does anyone if I can download security or other updates with this version?
,azmoaore,2011-09-15T11:41Z,"Dear All 

Please update your mac system, then install OSX Lion, it is working 100%

Thank you 

azmo"
,pushkaryadav,2011-09-15T15:09Z,"@all : 
i am gonna download this (won't harm me if it doesn't even work cause i just wanna test it...)
well i don't have a mac, but i wanted to test it on my laptop which is running windows 7 and my system is 64 bit
my laptop is not very old (just 3-4 months)
specs - 
i5 processor @ 2.3 GHz
4 GM Ram
Intel HD graphic card family 3000
see if anyone can help me dual boot windows and osX

i have a frnd who have a macbook so i can give this image so she will burn it or in any case if won't work then she can use it anyway..."
,myps3,2011-09-16T05:02Z,"Tyr3ll
Thanks for the OSX Lion, it is working pretty good, although it's a bit buggy, but that's not your fault, it's apple's fault, as usual with every new OSX the first few updates will hopefully fixes it

and 64base, thanks for the clear instructions

Thanks again Tyr3ll"
,magical_nut,2011-09-16T07:13Z,"If this works it will be amazing. 
I only have one question before I do go to install it though, and the only reason I ask is because I have several things that need updating. 
Does this version of OSX Lion work with updates? 
I would really appreciate a response from those who already have it and are still up and running with an update, thanks."
,magical_nut,2011-09-17T06:22Z,"You do not need to burn this onto an ISO, or use any program other than an extraction program. 

Instructions for none-ISO mount:
1. Download file and extract ""Part 1"".
2. Drag and drop downloaded folder with the extraction onto the Mac you wish to install on.
3. Click install, and agree to the terms. 

It is that easy guys, and it does work with the updates. This version is 100%, haven't had one problem what so ever. 

Thank you for the amazing upload Tyr3ll.

Will be seeding this for at least a year."
,Arrmehearty,2011-09-21T12:18Z,"Worked perfectly for me. 
Used win rar then copies to a USB and ran install from there. 
It could not have been easier and smoother. 
Thanks. 
You are F ing amazing. 
Well done. "
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-09-23T19:43Z,"Thx to all cool-nice guys to confirmed it works.
friendly :)"
,hitmaneid,2011-09-25T05:08Z,"Has anyone ever successfully installed this on a PC? If so, please tell me how."
[T],Apokarteron,2011-09-26T00:40Z,"Sorry to hijack your torrent, but my torrent is more retail than your torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6688033/ :P"
,NJKita11,2011-09-29T14:09Z,Should i back up my hard drive and everything on it before installing this or will this do a non destructive installation over all the files i already have on my mac?
,magical_nut,2011-10-07T23:33Z,"You do not need to back up your hard drive, this is actually a simple modification to the already installed OSX. Pretty much an update to the software to make it more user friendly. No need, the files are completely safe. I've been running it for a month now, and it checks out on every level. 

As for getting in on a PC, that is not going to work out for you. It won't work considering it is a completely different system that isn't capable of running it, unless you have made custom modifications to the system software yourself. If you can figure it out, enjoy, if not though I would recommend not trying it considering the fact that it could completely screw your system. 

This torrent is by far the best OSX Lion torrent there is on Piratebay, simple and easy to use as well with no bugs. If the system runs slow at the start, restart it and let it set a moment, and than reboot. Works perfectly. "
,Dannieloco,2011-10-10T08:47Z,"^ Nice try.. =)

He's asking if he can run windows on his mac, which he can. Look up VMware Fusion or http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6707860/VMware.Fusion.v4.0.2.MacOSX.Incl.Keymaker

Once that's installed, you can install windows xp, 7 or whatever OS u want, including Linux, OS X etc.. 

Google it :)"
,magical_nut,2011-10-12T23:25Z,"Actually, I do believe you are wrong. I read the question right. :)

""Has anyone ever successfully installed this on a PC?""

The poor sap was trying to install it on a PC, not install Windows on a Mac...that would be counter productive. :)"
,koopi,2011-10-13T15:47Z,"So to be pricise...
i can download it i can unzip it to usb and intall without apple asking me to verify the copy?"
,jooda.369,2011-10-13T21:42Z,"Thank You so much about this great Version.
i got a problem, i don't know whether if it's common or not.
When I updated, i got this message: 
""The update could not be verified. It may have been corrupted or tampered with during downloading. The update will be downloaded and checked again the next time that Software Update runs.""

Any tips ???"
,jooda.369,2011-10-13T21:47Z,"Oh, by the way, 
My update details was:
1) Lion Recovery Update V1 Size 452.5 MB
2) iTunes V10.5 Size 83.4 MB
3) Mac OS X Update Combined V10.7.2 Size 836.7 MB

The Rejected update was the last one, Max OS X Update Combined."
,magical_nut,2011-10-14T00:08Z,"Yes, that is right. You can download and install this through the USB after unpacking it. Run the install, and it all should work properly unless you are like this fella with the error. It will not ask you to verify.

As for the jooda, sorry to hear about that issue. You might want to try re-downloading it once more, or try to unpack it on the mac system itself, and run it through there. I'm not for sure if any of this works, but they might be helpful. MIGHT.
Also, try turning off your wifi and see if that may be a registration error. "
,magical_nut,2011-10-14T00:09Z,"Actually, before you update to OSX-Lion, make sure the software you are currently running is completely up to date as well. That is one issue I had as well, and that could very well be the exact issue you are having. Before running your install, just go up and check for updates, let them run, and then install Lion. "
,shaneee654,2011-10-15T18:04Z,"hi everyone,im about to download this, can anybody please tell me/confirm if i will be able to update Lion after this has been installed?"
,kreem,2011-10-15T20:03Z,"Check that Lion supports your type of Mac - I assumed it would install on my Macbook Pro Intel Core Duo, but turns out it will only install on machines with Intel Core 2 Duo, Core i3, Core i5, Core i7 or Xeon processors - bummer..."

,ShadeSeven,2012-01-03T01:34Z,"stuart: no, not unless you get a cracked Darwin loader... it's all out there, but try looking for a snow leopard one; it's been out longer, is less shit than lion (not saying much), and there are plenty of people who have written tutorials on installing it on a ""hackintosh"""
,ShadeSeven,2012-01-03T01:41Z,"azwadogrl: this site is community-contributed, it's not all organised by one person. Depending on who made the torrent, it could be safe, useless or dangerous. If it was a well-known/trusted uploader (with a skull) then it's probably fine..."
