The Ringer for Black Lion Records (it has been reissued a number of times on different labels with different cover art) with his group Music, Inc: Stanley Cowell on piano, Steve Novosel on bass, and Jimmy Hopps on drums. However..now it is out of print (and has been for some time)! A few selections are on the recording, "Mosaic Select". 

I hope you will realize how great this musician is and support him. How? By buying his "in print" recordings!!!!

This is one guy that did not get the credit he deserved! Wonderful musician. Great voice on the trumpet!
