,alex_nrv,2011-08-24T05:31Z,"I thought these releases were awesome since they were made for many devices...
I use a PS3 and I thought this would be great...
I downloaded 3 .M4V from you HolyRoses and none of them are working.

I renamed the files to .MP4 but still my PS3 recognizes the files as ""Unsupported data"".

What am I doing wrong? I stream a LOT of movies and never had ""unsupported data"" errors!

?????????????????"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-09-01T16:09Z,"hmm, i dont know what you are doing, but they work for almost all PS3 users.  it may be how you are using your device.  They do work 100% fine on a PS3.  You dont need to rename the file, that is just there for complainers."
