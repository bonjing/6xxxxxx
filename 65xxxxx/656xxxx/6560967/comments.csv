1080p & 720p, "
,SzaliS,2011-07-25T21:42Z,"the 1080i standard is not for nothing, it is for the best compromise between resolution, bandwith and motion reproduction.

All of the Top Gear episodes I found in 1080 is kept in the original 1080i, with seamless motion.
It is practically 50fps.

You can not improve the resolution of the moving picture by deinterlace, though it can help players with no deinterlacing option.

But the perfect solution with this kind of fast moving picture would be the original interlaced 1080i signal,

thanks for the great work anyway!"
