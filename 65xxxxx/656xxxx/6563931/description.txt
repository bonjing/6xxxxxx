There have been many attempts over the years to depict the horror or the effects of the Holocaust on film, but itâ€™s a subject fraught with pitfalls for any filmmaker. Itâ€™s doubtful that the true nature, sheer enormity and complete obscenity of such an event can ever be conveyed on the screen and itâ€™s telling that perhaps the most effective film on the subject â€“ Alain Renaisâ€™ short documentary film Night and Fog (Nuit et Brouillard) â€“ is mercifully concise and restrained, yet ugly, brutal and shocking. Even Spielbergâ€™s Schindlerâ€™s List is weighed down by its distancing glamorous cinematography and well-meaning pathos that distorts its message with bloated sentimentality. One other way of dealing with the subject â€“ which many feel is no more effective â€“ is to attempt to confront the subject with humour since the matter is too absurd to confront rationally, as in Roberto Benigniâ€™s Life Is Beautiful. This black, absurdist approach is taken by Robert Shawâ€™s controversial stage play and its American Film Theatre adaptation, The Man In The Glass Booth.

The plot was inspired by actual events surrounding the kidnapping and trial of Adolf Eichmann. Arthur Goldman is Jewish and a Nazi death camp survivor. Now a rich industrialist, he lives in luxury in a Manhattan high-rise. He banters with his assistant Charlie, often shocking him with his outrageousness and irreverence about aspects of Jewish life. One day, Israeli secret agents burst in and kidnap Goldman and take him to Israel for trial on charges of being a Nazi war criminal. Goldman's trial forces his accusers to face not only his presumed guilt, but their own as well.

Shawâ€™s play takes an interesting angle on survivorâ€™s guilt, the deep-rooted psychosis that the Holocaust has had on the Jewish psyche and plunges deep and controversially into many previously unexplored areas, but â€“ at least in Arthur Hillerâ€™s filmed version of the drama for the American Film Theatre â€“ he doesnâ€™t succeed, coming across as too damned clever to really get to the nature of the survivorâ€™s trauma. 

Describing the play as an â€œintellectual thrillerâ€, Arthur Hiller says the play was re-written for the screen by AFT script-editor Edward Anhalt in order to give it more emotional charge. He talks about Shawâ€™s dislike of the screenplay and his decision to remove his name from anywhere on the credits, but claims that Shaw changed his mind when he saw the finished film.
