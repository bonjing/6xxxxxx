The Corporation.  But a great addition to the information the movie gives.

I'm a novice to torrent - this said, this was a Very Slow download. 
I assume due to lack of seeders.  It is worth the time to download and to 
upload - even if it is at 20Kb/s....  Could not be relavent, but the 
two ""peers"" that had this at 100% which appeared on my list were 
listed in the overnight hours of US time."
