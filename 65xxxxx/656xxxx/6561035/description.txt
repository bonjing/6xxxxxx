The jury's still out on this album -- and it's likely to remain that way. Moonshine collected several tracks previously released on vinyl only and created a sometimes-breaksy, sometimes-trancy compilation that pleases some people some of the time and frustrates others almost all the time. Hardcore tranceheads or broken-beat fanatics tend to take issue with this collection -- it doesn't have the driving pulse of a straight trance album or the gritty bassline of funky breaks. Instead, it's got an interesting hybrid of the two -- heavy on the vocal samples and keyboard effects with lots of breakdowns and builds. Moonshine artists featured on the album include Darwin Chamber, Danny Saber, and Supersoul. All of them have made a name for themselves as producers or DJs or both. All of these tracks have doubtless gotten plenty of play in clubs. So why do certain people complain about the album? Probably just because in subgenres such as these, where the fans are opinionated in the extreme, it's virtually impossible to find 11 tracks that make everybody happy. ~ L. Katz
