[V],bubanee,2011-07-25T00:29Z,"@ Canadaguy1959. lol.. but It's all about the Music What about the others that died at 27 years of age and how a lot of people praise them, although Amy might not be in their class but they were junkies and drunks too! Aaaahhhhh lol"
,Dimmis80,2011-07-25T07:48Z,Thanks man.RIP Amy...
,SoftWarez,2011-07-25T09:14Z,"@Canadaguy1959 - you think Hendrix was clean? You even know how Hendrix died? Dont start bulshiitin.

RIP Amy."
,severed1314,2011-07-25T16:24Z,Even her death was a fucking publicity stunt. R.I.P Jim Morrison the only good musician to die at 27.
,Klepzeiker13,2011-07-25T16:30Z,Thanks
,Niro_,2011-07-25T19:39Z,"Good music is when you feel it in your bones.
True that Amy Winehouse, say it loud, say it proud girl. Hatred is a very underestimated emotion."
,TheExponentiel,2011-07-25T19:53Z,"HOHO another Debat here!
Drugs like crack, speed, coke and heroin are very very very bad.. So kids dont do drugs. Hendrix died in is vomit... 
@severed1314; i dont think she kill her self to sell more cds.. she was just sick and tired of is habits.. and by the way jim morrison the only good muscian to die a 27... are you out of your mind..

,Kole97,2011-07-26T09:43Z,"@severed1314 dude  that's not true, get ur facts right? yea some feel she was broken after her split from her ex !"
,matthew222,2011-07-26T19:44Z,heaven need you Amy
,chilled1206,2011-07-26T21:52Z,"Peace to her soul. I don't understand people who feel free to critisize others (when those others aren't hurting other people than themselves).
And I really don't understand what brings people that want to talk bad about Amy (she just died, really!) to a site about downloading her songs."
,TheBleed,2011-07-27T02:59Z,"R.I.P Amy Winehouse....


you will be missed by millions baby. :("
,hound1234,2011-07-29T15:11Z,"Exellent Music .When she was alive I never listened to her music.After her passing I searched YouTube and watched her singing in a couple of videos. I never relized what a great singer she really was..She sounds a little like Tina Turner and Janis Joplin mixed in one in a Jazz overtone.,  Too bad….  she could have released  a lot more songs ★.•:*¨¨*:•.★"
[T],locobot12,2011-07-29T23:17Z,"R.I.P Amy!

but she was the biggest crackhead of all time!!"
,CaliGrl,2011-07-31T00:54Z,"If those of you leaving negative comments disliked her so much, why are you bothering to be on a page to download her music? I assume nothing better to do with yourselves... "
,bobiv2n,2011-08-01T00:52Z,"Thx for the great tunes dude.                               R.I.P. Amy , your death was also the night the music died"
,FLAMinEK,2011-08-04T12:44Z,she was no x factor type and made it on her own so to me that's a fair play. It's very sad really everyone wanted to see her beat her demons but it wasn't to be.
,xBigChillinx,2011-08-06T02:26Z,"It sickens me to see those great artists names on the same page as this bitch. She was a horrible musician and an even worse human being. It says something about you when your father has already written your eulogy because he knows that your such a piece of shit that your going to die before he does. May the worms feast on that bitches track marks, and may the family finally get their peace."

hey watch out, think of Kurt Cobain"
,xixoka,2011-08-09T23:27Z,"@Canadaguy1959, @Canadagay1959"
,luvtpb123,2011-08-17T17:42Z,wayyy to may us Canadians look bad @canadaguy... RIP Winehouse very underrated musican I will download and collect few of your tunes..
,illuminatedgirl,2011-08-19T20:52Z,"at least the poor woman doesnt have to suffer anymore, and thats all i care about really. i love her voice and her music. thanks for the torrent."
,Brucieeeee,2011-08-20T16:57Z,"thx Bubanee
R.I.P. Amy Winehouse"
,WolfPunk,2011-08-23T20:44Z,"@Canadaguy1959. Idiots like you and your like, that don't know history should seriously Fuck Off.  The Harrison Act of 1916 'Demonized' narcotics and the Government  claimed them as their private Domain. Their Croakers in the Medical field became the only legal distributors. Prior to that. Heroin (synthesized by Bayer two years after they introduced Aspirin) and Cocaine was sold over the counter as was Laudanum (tincture of Opium). This was given to colic, crying babies, and sold under names such as ""Mother's Hours of Peace"" and similar products.  Artists live on a diffent plane than talent-less people like you. The great Beat writer, Willam Burroughs, lived to a late age and was a ""Junkie"" most of his life."
,mistyjo,2011-08-31T23:37Z,R.I.P amy!
,kingaggs,2011-09-09T12:26Z,"hey canadaguy1959 you fucking moron, how bout you take every piece piece of good music you own, although judging by your comment i'd say its not much, and burn it coz it was all created by someone effected in some way by a substance of some description. do you really think amy or anyone else for that matter asks to be an addict. get educacted before you jaw off about something you clearly have no fucking idea about."
,clashingpersonality,2011-09-21T00:39Z,Bill hicks said it best man.  but the point is drugs = better music
,rustybear59,2011-09-22T07:55Z,I am so sad she died . But I feel even more sadness for you haters whose lives are so obviously    empty that you have nothing but venom to spew regarding a fellow human being that suffered a devastating illness and paid the ultimate price . Her voice will be missed .
,rustybear59,2011-09-22T08:09Z,By the way A Huge thank you to bubanee for the upload !
,AmyWHfan,2011-10-01T06:00Z,"Amy Winehouse's talent, voice and soul was incomparable. There's just no one like her.  "
,mushyfairy,2011-10-25T03:02Z,Thank you so much :o)  RIP Amy!
,Pimmek,2011-11-28T20:16Z,"Many thanx, Bubanee.

Say no to drugs. And then shut tf up."
