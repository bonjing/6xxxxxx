,capmoq,2012-01-07T14:09Z,"Hey guys this is your chance to play on the best Cataclysm server in Europe. No lag, no crashes!
The server is Romanian but a new international realm ""Exodus"" was opened.
This is by far the best and most superb server out there.
It's patch 4.0.6 but works with all patches (4.0.6 - 4.x.x). You can download the game from Blizzard if you want to.
PVP is working 98% and most of the Cataclysm instances are scripted.
NOTE - Replace all (.) with dots - remove the ()
IF you want to give this server a chance then follow this link:
wow(.)freakz(.)ro/register.php?inviter=1654
First 10 days it's instant lvl 85!!!


Here are the steps:
1) Register on the link
2) After registration go to WoW - Data - enGB - realmlist(.)wtf (open with notepad).
There replace set realmlist xxxxxxxx with set realmlist wow(.)freakz(.)ro (the first line).
3) Then go back to wow(.)freakz(.)ro site and on the left panel click on ""Download Launcher"".
4) Install the launcher to the WoW folder.
5) Launch the game, log in, create a character and have fun!


It's as simple as that! My name on Exodus realm is Capmoq / Plight / Prodigy.
Feel free to ask any question in game! See you out there ;) "

,.Leto.,2012-04-29T19:40Z,"Nice game but DON'T join Eternal-WoW, that server totally sucks !! Full of bugs that they never fix. And it's always the same lame excuse, ""it's Trinity's fault"" Sure... it can't be because they don't have a single good developper, right?"
