Welcome to Brooklyn 1978. Disco rules, and dancing and "making it" are the only entertainment its blue collar residents can afford. Tony is a working stiff like the rest of his neighborhood, but on the weekends he is king of the disco. He is very content busting moves both on and off the dance floor with the neighborhood girls. That is until he meets his dream girl from Manhattan. Then his life is changed forever.
