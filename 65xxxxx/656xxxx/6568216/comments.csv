V5/A2

Don't waste your time.  "

,jimbuck2,2012-02-25T21:34Z,"Gotta disagree fellas.  1080p it ain't but it's still better than NTSC.  I watched s1e1 on vlc and so far so good.  Thanks mkvGOD, the compression allows me to take the season on a stick for trips.    v=8/a=8. The clarity isn't up to 720p standards(feels more like 480) but if you want more you gotta pay in terms of file size.  For what it is (2 seasons in 2GB) it's pretty good."
