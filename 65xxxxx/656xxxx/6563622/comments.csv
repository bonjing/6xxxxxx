,mbmalone,2011-07-26T04:55Z,"If you can't add all the wireless, at least add Intel & Broadcom. It booted fine, keep doing it. 2GB Ram system."
,DarthBubba,2011-07-26T05:15Z,"@redback38:  How about a listing of the utils/programs included.
Also, a ""What's New"" or ""Changelog"" listing would be nice as you update the disc.
Further, resist the urge to include 16 file managers and 22 partition managers - one or two GOOD ones will do.
Finally - Thank You for your efforts!  You're a good sport my friend!  ;-)"
,redback38,2011-07-26T05:49Z,"@Dearth Bubba.....nice to see ur still alive and kickin,and you still have great humour!:-)yes i added a lot of simillar apps,some work better on some comps than others,but i definatly see ur point.there is a change log in the readme file in this torrent,my apologizies for not listing a full rundown of included apps\tools\programs,i wish i had a good xcuse,but really im just a lazy lazy man lol!now that iv got audio sorted,and got to fully test the apps in a working environment,ill cull a few(or a lot)to make room for some extra drivers for wifi etc.version 4 will include wifi(if i can get it workin lol,and a list of included apps and version numbers.thank you for your candour and direct honesty,taken in good spirit,and it inspires me to improve:-)"
,redback38,2011-07-26T05:52Z,"@mbmalone.ill split the difference with you and include the entire driver pack,will include it in version 4,if i can get it stable and running ok:-)"
,redback38,2011-07-26T05:56Z,"@dee_mer....stick with me man,ill be making smaller ones from here on in,500-600MB,ur 1GB comp will eat it up no problems."
,dee_mer80,2011-07-26T14:35Z,"thanks for ur concern..I'm not asking much,..with V1 I can have my wifi working but cannot be 
shared,media players doesn'work (if u can fix that,many thanks)..other applications are not so 
important,they must be used with  windows..sound is important...I commend your good work and hope
for the next episode...many thanks for your hard works/efforts.!!"

,redback38,2011-07-26T15:08Z,"@mbmalone!....i have made a bare bones build with  the requested drivers intergrated for your wifi.its here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6566189/win7PE_SE_custom_4_mbmalone.its just a shell with firefox and your drivers installed.but you can test ur wifi and let me know how it goes,if alls good ill make sure version 4 has them in it.enjoy and lets know:-)"
,redback38,2011-07-26T15:17Z,@dee_mer80...hang tight man version4 will be much smaller(5-600MB) so you will have loads of ram to run the media players.and audio is stable now so give me a day or so and version will be rockin for ya!...:-)
,mbmalone,2011-07-27T03:54Z,The one you built for me didn't have network support installed at all.
,DarthBubba,2011-07-27T06:02Z,"@redback38:  Sorry that I missed the ""changelog"" in version 2; I often grab interesting files to look at later on.  I also wrote that last note as I was downloading version 3 - my apologies.

Judging from the number of folks you have trying to grab the custom copy you made just for mbmalone, I'd say you're developing a following!  :-)"
,dee_mer80,2011-07-27T12:07Z,"redback38 is just trying to please his followers..but "" you can not please everybody""
I did not see any Recovery Program than like his works... so why dont we give him a chance
to explore his talents..afterall he is sharing it with others..redback38. I commend you once again"
,redback38,2011-07-27T12:40Z,"@mbmalone....yup i screwed up by not including the net support in the test build for you my bad,too much of a hurry to post it up,regardless,they are in the V4 build and working fine,,,,.....@DearthBubba,all good matey,im not great with the paperwork,but ill TRY to do better changelogs too,some dont have a full list of apps...and yes i am getting a following,pity they didnt read the intro about being a test disk that aint worth the plastic its burnt on lol!.@Dee_mer.....thanks a bunch dude,stay keen....buildin V4 now....considering a two disk edition for the sake of keeping things small enough.....rescue dick on one....standard op/sys on the other..:0"
