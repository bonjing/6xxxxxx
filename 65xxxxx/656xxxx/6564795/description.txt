webcam 7 / IP Camera [RTSP] DirectShow Filter 0.9.9.25 Beta 

webcam 7 is our brand new product based on webcamXP. the user interface is the same however it offers exciting enhancements such as :

- Flash Video (FLV) streaming
- MPEG-4 / RTSP IP Cameras
- Audio support in MJPEG

it is now available for beta testing and you can install it even if webcamXP is already installed.

in FLV streaming, webcam 7 is supporting to stream both audio and video. the RTSP DirectShow filter is also able to retrieve both audio and video from some ip cameras so it's really a major step forward for webcamXP.

to get ip cameras using RTSP to work over internet you'll have to open and forward UDP ports 1690-1710 on your router.

After a workaround on the installer, you can now register it with a old keygen i had.
