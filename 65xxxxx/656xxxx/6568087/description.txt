description:


To bring home the checkered flag in this kart racer, you will travel to places you have never seen in a racing game! Super Sonic Racing sends you to four worlds, each more bizarre than the next, but all geared for super-charged driving action. Choose from 12 crazy characters with equally unusual rides. Drive a space shuttle, monster truck, futuristic magnetic superbike, pizza-delivery mobile, and more. Compete on 16 reversible tracks in the fiery Nightmare World, the shimmering Underwater World, the video-game-inspired Game World, or the garbage-covered planet of Trash World. Use boosts to outmaneuver other drivers and watch out for hazards just waiting to derail your charge to victory.


Feel the burning heat from the Nightmare World, see how big a planet must be to house all of our garbage in Trash World, hold your breath for a very long time while checking out the most beautiful underwater world you've seen in Aqua World, and see how computer games really work in Game World.
