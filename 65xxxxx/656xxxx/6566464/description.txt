    Some unknown source has interrupted all television transmissions         
    around the world. In place of the regular broadcasts, a lineup of        
    extremely tasteless programs and commercials have been substituted.      
    Included in the mix are such show as The Shitheads, The Charles          
    Whitman Invitational, and commercials for a number of improbable         
    products.
