              Unsuccessfully framed for his wife's murder, Dr. 
              David Krane attempts to find the real culprit by 
              utilizing a new drug that allows him to experience 
              the memories of other people first-hand. As he gets 
              closer to the truth, the injections begin to take 
              their toll on his life. Additionally, a history of 
              alcoholism, a career crisis, and the involvement of 
              police officers in the murder all conspire to prevent 
              Dr. Crane from learning what really happened. The 
              challenge, then, is for the doctor to overcome these 
              obstacles before his time runs out.
