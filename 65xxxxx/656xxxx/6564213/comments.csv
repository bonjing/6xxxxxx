,MAElki,2011-07-31T16:19Z,"The novellas ""Mountains of Mourning"" (06),  ""Labyrinth"" (10) and ""Borders of Infinity"" (11) are included in the 13th book ""Borders of Infinity"".

The others (09 Ethan of Athos and 02 Falling Free) don't concern Miles directly and thus I don't like them and don't have. "
