The Class 57 was created by Brush Traction using old British Rail Class 47 (Brush Type 4) bodies with upgraded General Motors engines and running gear. For this reason Class 57s have become known as Body-Snatchers. Produced from 1997 to 2004, the Class 57 was initially intended for freight duties, until a version with electric train heating facilities was trialled in 2000 to gain interest from passenger service operating companies. The Class 57 has since served with a number of freight and passenger operators across the UK, and has enabled the old Class 47 to continue to serve in modified form over 40 years after the last examples were built.
