Hiring Noted Roots Experimentalists Tchad Blake And Mitchell Froom As Engineer And Consultant, Respectively, Sheryl Crow Took A Cue From Their Latin Playboys Project For Her Second Album -- She Kept Her Roots Rock Foundation And Added All Sorts Of Noises, Weird Instruments, Percussion Loops, And Off-Balance Production To Give Sheryl Crow A Distinctly Modern Flavor. And, Even With The Stones-Y Grind Of "sweet Rosalyn" Or Hippie Spirits Of "love Is A Good Thing," It Is An Album That Couldn't Have Been Made Any Other Time Than The '90s. As Strange As It May Sound, Sheryl Crow Is A Post-Modern Masterpiece Of Sorts -- Albeit A Mainstream, Post-Alternative, Post-Modern Masterpiece. It May Not Be As Hip Or Innovative As, Say, The Beastie Boys' Paul's Boutique, But It Is As Self-Referential, Pop-Culture Obsessed, And Musically Eclectic. Throughout The Record, Crow Spins Out Wild, Nearly Incomprehensible Stream-Of-Consciousness Lyrics, Dropping Celebrity Names And Products Every Chance She Gets ("drinking Falstaff Beer/mercedes Ruehl And A Rented Leer"). 

Often, These Litanies Don't Necessarily Add Up To Anything Specific, But 
They're A Perfect Match For The Mess Of Rock, Blues, Alt-Rock, Country, Folk, And 
Lite Hip-Hop Loops That Dominate The Record. At Her Core, She Remains A 
Traditionalist -- The Songcraft Behind The Infectious "change Would Do You Good," The Bubbly "everyday Is A Winding Road," And The Weary "if It Makes You Happy" Helped Get The Singles On The Radio -- But The Production And Lyrics Are Often At Odds With Those Instincts, Creating For A Fascinating And Compelling (And Occasionally Humorous) Listen And One Of The Most Individual Albums Of Its Era. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine
