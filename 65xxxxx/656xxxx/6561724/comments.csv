But can anyone tell me about compatibility? I've seen many android versions, mine will be froyo 2.2 upgradable to 2.3. Will these work? Thanks"

,XpS06,2011-09-08T22:39Z,Sorry to say that neither Shazam Encore or PowerAmp worked. Both said it was the wrong license or something like that.
,Torrents00,2011-09-09T19:09Z,"Can sombody sy how to install them  in more detail,please.

Dont need any hate comments :)"
,JumpmanX3,2011-09-10T00:51Z,"@Torrents00, Just get that Astro File Manager then look for whatever folder you placed these apps (.apk) and just click on them and you should get that installation screen "
,Torrents00,2011-09-12T23:51Z,"In some of the games a message comes up :License check the market, see the network state or something like that, can I be caught if i play these games??
And I have to install each game one at the time:(

Anyway great torrent :)"
,kbowk2,2011-09-18T13:17Z,Great stuff I downloaded a bunch of them straight onto my tablet.
,HeatherC19,2011-09-26T07:51Z,"FYI- Any app that, when you install it, mentions a ""market license check"" will not be able to be played for free. What that means is kind of self explanatory- it wants to check, using the market, to ensure you have paid for the game. 

I am sure there is a way around it, but I have not found it yet. "

,archyzz,2012-02-07T08:20Z,"@simox6660 You're probably one of those iFags aren't you? If you don't like Android or these apps, why are you searching for them? It's very easy; you just stay the hell away :)

Anyway, great upload Extra (Y)"
,droiduser,2012-02-28T07:53Z,"Easy way to get it on your phone. Download a torrent client from the app store, like the free version of aTorrent, then use your phones browser to go to pirate bay. Download the files from there using your client. And even get the full version of aTorrent or whatever from here using the free version. I know, ironic as it is, it works. I use everything directly through my phone. No ""jumping through hoops"" that way."
