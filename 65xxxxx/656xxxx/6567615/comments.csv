Awesome to at last hear someone pointing to the elephant in the livingroom regarding the tragedy in Norway close to where I live in Scandinavia, and if the Norwegian gun laws had something to do with only one man being able to shoot 90 people on the spot. The Left-wing liberal guy who brought up the statistics of 10.000 gun killings in the US compared to 500 in Norway should have been answered on that remark, though. The population in the US is 300 million people, and only 4 million in Norway."
