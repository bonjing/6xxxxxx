But again, why always the explicit lyric versions??????
I get your downloads most weeks for the Kids on car journeys, causes loads of problems................"
[V],oldskoolscouse,2011-07-28T17:48Z,"@goochie01, the explict lyrics are actually part of the orginal recording, they are cleaned up for radio play. and most of the time its all itunes has available."

,bugmeless,2011-07-31T16:48Z,"Since people are always asking about clean versions, more than half the time the version you hear on the radio is actually fixed up by editors at the radio station itself - a ""radio edit"" coming with the single is the exception rather than the rule, and it's more likely to come when the tracks are long.

I really appreciate these collections - the only problem I have is that almost all the tracks are clipped, a couple of them really severely, but that seems to be a problem with the Loudness Wars in general."
