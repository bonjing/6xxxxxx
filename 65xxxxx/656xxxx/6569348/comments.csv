,cbpistolpete,2011-09-08T01:46Z,"theres a lot of whiney little bitches who are commenting on this shit.  Maybe you fuckers should just wait till it comes out on dvd and buy it, cause the dude who uploaded this torrent probably doesnt give a shit"
,Ziho,2011-09-21T23:46Z,"@ Fre0n. 720p is the full resolution, so if its recorded in Cinemascope it will be 540 px (or something close to that) in height. If you see black bars in the top an the bottom of you TV, then it doesn't use the full 720 px available. So it should actually be called 1280p and 1920p. But use your brains, its what they are there for :-)"
