This is a really good time to put out a full collection. 

Solomon Kane just wrapped up Red Shadows. King Conan wrapped up Scarlet Citadel. Conan: Road of Kings wrapped up its Ophir story-line. Kull wrapped up The Hate Witch. Everything here wraps up a complete story. Even the stories started in Robert E. Howard's Savage Sword 1 are finished in Robert E. Howard's Savage Sword 2
