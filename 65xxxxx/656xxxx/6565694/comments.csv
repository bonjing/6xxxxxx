,chankz-1,2011-07-26T10:21Z,"can any 1 plz upload the ""island wars 2"" game full version? :)"
,debugman18,2011-07-26T11:41Z,"Bone has a good torrent for that kind of thing.

,chankz-1,2011-07-26T12:55Z,hey thanx for your reply man! :)
,nataliegail,2011-07-27T02:26Z,"This might sound a little stupid on my part, but what exactly do cracks do? (is it like a game update) and where do I put the crack? "
,debugman18,2011-07-27T03:23Z,"A crack is a fixed-exe. It means you can run the game without the cd in the drive. 

You put the cracks supplied here in your:

C:/Program Files/Electronic Arts/The Sims 3/Bin

And 'Replace All'."
,nataliegail,2011-07-27T04:36Z,^^^Thank you for that! 
,Vegasbob,2011-07-27T10:01Z,Anyone know does Town Life Stuff include this patch or should TLS be gotten before or after this? 
,debugman18,2011-07-27T10:06Z,I installed Town Life over this patch. I would suggest installing everything in the order of release.
,Vegasbob,2011-07-27T10:36Z,Ok if done that way then would you want to use the crack that comes with this patch or the crack that comes with http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6566982/The.Sims.3.Town.Life.Stuff-RELOADED ? Or is it the same crack?
,debugman18,2011-07-27T12:54Z,"Use the crack supplied with Town Life, if it is installed after this. "
,mich2ga,2011-07-28T16:29Z,Crack doesn't fit 1.24. Will get an Unofficial Game Mod Notification. 
,debugman18,2011-07-28T18:42Z,"I know for a fact that it works. If it isn't working, you must've done something wrong m8. 

Perhaps you have a lighting mod or something installed?"
,debugman18,2011-07-28T18:45Z,"Oi, and if it tells you there is an unofficial game mod, click continue. It will forever tell you that because of the way TS3W.exe works."
,mich2ga,2011-07-29T00:19Z,"My Game is clean. No CC & about 400 sim packs installed. I use Delphy's Simpack cleaner so it's no bad anything. I also monitor Crinicts CC Blog. I used a mini Image & game plays fine. When You install Townlife it updates the game to 2.3. This 2.4 is the same as the one on SimsTg

The Mini Image Works fine to update to the latest patch people."
,rojie1988,2011-07-29T01:47Z,"i have version 1.22.9 installed and i downloaded 1.24.3 but when i try to install it says ""invalid file found"". but when i download this 1.24.3 it updated my game perfectly. but when i overwrite  the crack and go on with the game it says ""you have installed unofficial game modification that does not match your current version of sims 3.""
it also says "" you might experience crashes or significant bugs.

there's an option to quit  or to continue, i clicked continue and it plays the game. but im not sure if there's bug or errors in mhy game!? 
HELP!!!"
,debugman18,2011-07-29T04:34Z,"There will be no errors. Don't be alarmed by the warning, it is nothing to worry about."
,Wizard316,2011-07-29T17:01Z,"The reason some are having problems is because this is a bullshit crack.

It's the cracked 1.22.9 executable, not the cracked 1.24.3 executable.  This is obvious when you look at the details and properties of the files.

And not at all uncommon. People patch a game, and then put an older crack on.. and when it woks, they assume all is well and spread it recklessly.

But that actually undoes most of the patch changes. Most patch changes take place in the executable. You patch your game and it's content to 1.24.3, and then run with the 1.22.9 executable.. you are looking at.. at best, a buggy experience.

WE do not have a proper 1.24.3 crack yet.  And debugman is irresponsible trying to pass this off as a legitimate 1.24.3 crack. 

Just look on the sims versions wiki. The real 1.24.3 executable and DLL file are 0.2.0.154, which is listed in that wiki as 1.24.3.  

The files in this archive are for 0.2.0.151, which is listed in that wiki as 1.22.9.  And the build date on the executable in this archive is from May, where the proper executable is from July.

It's irresponsible to pass off improper cracks.  It can corrupt your entire game. It undoes many of the patch changes.  And this is not a proper crack.

The patch is correct, but the crack is actually for the previous version. This will be unstable and buggy, at best. It's not the right way to do it."

This executable and dll are for 1.22.9."
,mich2ga,2011-07-29T18:07Z,"@Widzard316 You are correct. This is what I have been trying to tell the uploader. This Crack will Mess Your Game Up People, do not download it!"
,debugman18,2011-07-29T21:30Z,"Trolls be trollin'. Whatever the state may be, (although I assure you that this is 24.3. a crack is not an official executable, so relying on EA's signature is simply stupid. 

Whoever you are, you have no torrents uploaded.

Patch works fine, so everyone enjoy. Although there is no need to use this if you have Town Life Stuff. :3"
,Wizard316,2011-07-29T22:54Z,"The proof is in the file properties.

You just took a 1.22.9 crack executable and slapped it into the archive and pass it off as a 1.24.3 crack.

But it's not.  It's definitely 1.22.9.

Calling me a troll to discredit me is childish and demonstrates your level of denial.

And my lack of torrents uploaded is irrelevant.

This is not a proper crack. NO ONE has made a 1.24.3 crack yet.  NO ONE.

Oh this one may very well work, but that doesn't mean it's working correctly, and that it will not cause problems later.

An example is if the patch makes changes to the data structure, and then this old executable is accessing that data based on the old structure. It will slowly corrupt that data.

the proof is in the file properties and build dates. This is absolutely the 1.22.9 executable cracked, not 1.24.3. 

Use at your own risk. Myself, I'm waiting for a proper crack. Or I would avoid using 1.24.3 until there is one."
,Wizard316,2011-07-29T23:07Z,"I just did a full file compare on your TS3W.EXE and the TS3W.exe from the 1.22.9 crack by fairlight, and THE FILES ARE IDENTICAL.

You sir, are a liar.  All you did was slap the 1.22.9 cracked executable in, and call it a crack.  

It doesn't matter that it ""works"".  It's the most rookie / newb ""cracking"" mistake anyone can make.  You are using the wrong executable.  Period.

The uploader is simply terrified of being found out to not be the uber-cracker he hopes to portray himself as.  That is why he is defensive, and name calling.

The proof is in the files. I challenge anyone else to try it for themselves.  Do a file compare. It is NOT a 1.24.3 crack.

NO ONE has mad a 1.24.3 crack yet. We are still waiting on one.

He just is using an older crack on a newer version. I'm telling you folks, this will eventually mess up your game.

Wait for a proper crack, or stick with 1.22.9."
,Wizard316,2011-07-29T23:10Z,"He also doesn't know what he's talking about with regards to the patch. The 1.24.3 patch DOES work with Town Life stuff.  The retail version of Town Life stuff is no up to 1.24.3.  The crack on that DVD release works with it, if you do not patch it.

If you patch it to 1.24.3, you no longer have a working/cracked game.  And I repeat, NO ONE has made a working 1.24.3 crack yet.

I'm not trying to stop anyone from playing, or anything of the sort. I'm just INFORMING people that this IDIOT is a LIAR, and trying to pass off an older crack version as a new one.. and it WILL eventually hurt your game.

That's all I have to say. It's up to the rest of you to reinstall all your shit later when it's messed up."
,Wizard316,2011-07-29T23:15Z,"WTF, is someone deleting my comments when I'm trying to educate people here?

I've just got done doing a full comparison of the TS3W.EXE in this archive, to the 1.22.9 crack by fairlight.

They are 100% IDENTICAL.

The OP is a liar.

This is NOT a proper cracked 1.24.3 executable.

And he's wrong on the patching. You can use 1.24.3 on Town Life Stuff.  When you install it from the original disc, the reloaded crack works, because they cracked it to the version on the CD, which is LOWER than 1.24.3.

But 1.24.3 will upgrade over town life stuff, and then you need a new crack.

The uploader is just desperately afraid of being caught out for the fake ""cracker"" that he is, trying to pass off previous cracks as new and proper. That is why he is resorting to name calling.

He's just wrong on every count. Use this at your own risk..  Or, wait for a proper 1.24.3 crack. Or, be happy reinstalling the whole game down the road to fix your corrupted files."
,Wizard316,2011-07-29T23:17Z,"using an older crack on a newer patch is so fucking newb and stupid, it's unbelievable.  Only a fool who is ignorant of how programming works could actually think it works."
,Wizard316,2011-07-29T23:39Z,"Please forgive my multiple posts. I am new to posting on these types of sites and didnt' realize it took so long for comments to appear.

I only just created this account recently, specifically to warn people about this kind of stupidity.

Suggesting that I don't have any uploads means ANYTHING is just ad hominem.

I'm not trying to pull anything. The uploader is a liar passing off an incorrect crack. Or he's a damn fool, and he's lying now to cover his ass.

I have said all that I can say. Anyone with any skill at all can also prove it for themselves.  This is an old crack, and using it on a new patch is a very bad idea. At best, it'll be a buggy/unstable experience.  at BEST.

Town Life stuff retail is 1.22.9 or something. You CAN apply 1.24.3 over it, and you WILL need a new, proper crack in that circumstance."
,debugman18,2011-07-29T23:58Z,"If it doesn't work to your standards, don't download it, and maybe go buy the game. If you have a problem with my uploads, go elsewhere. I've only had one other complaint, and that is from mich2ga. Don't fix what isn't broken."
,mich2ga,2011-07-30T00:00Z,Wizard316 It's several 1.24.3 Cracks out that work
,jbob75,2011-07-31T16:56Z,"I can vouch for mich2ga on this one.
First of all, this crack works.

Although you may notice the ""Unofficial Game Mod Notification"" message popping up at the beginning everytime you open the game.

But you can just ignore the warning by clicking ""Continue"" and play on.

Then again, I'm still waiting for the proper 1.24 crack. Hopefully will come anytime soon."
,jbob75,2011-07-31T17:00Z,"Almost forgot to mention, an important reminder for many of the guys here.

After every install or update, backup the original ""TS3W.exe"" and ""TSLHost.dll"" files first to a separate folder BEFORE overwriting them with crack versions.

That way, you may never have to reinstall the game if something goes wrong."
,smldmngz,2011-08-22T22:45Z,ok so i updated it and it went all good until i started the game and this re-enter and verify your registratuion code thing showed up! and whatever serial i type in wont work help!!
,immapirateyay,2011-08-28T20:59Z,"I have a question...I installed town life stuff here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6566982/The.Sims.3.Town.Life.Stuff-RELOADED

then used your update, then pasted your cracks to computer/sims3/gamebin and also sims 3/townlife stuff/game/bin and it said i no longer had town life stuff. 

SO

i posted town life stuff to both spots instead of your crack, but it tells me when i try to download gothique library i do not have the up to date/install failed. i want town life but also the latest update so i can download gothique library. can you help me?"
