,anangrysquirr3l,2011-07-25T18:09Z,by far the best copy so far that iv tried a/7 v/8 exellent quality for a cam more than watchable thanx tv team 
,piratecruzer,2011-07-25T21:10Z,"This is the best cam vid that I've ever seen actually, video wise lol.  It gets dark in a couple of spots, but not to a point where you can't see.  The audio isn't bad.  You can tell that it's in a theater, but it's no different than if you set your radio equalizer to hall.  You can still hear it clearly though.  Overall, an excellent copy.  A/6 V/9"
,LordReserei,2011-07-26T03:56Z,"A - 6
V - 8

Have to say like others that this is one of the best cams I've seen for a film. The video is excellent all things considering and I would've gave it a 7 for audio if it wasn't for the ton of reverb but what do you expect? 

Fast download too. 

Thanks for this TvTeam."

Hollywood is running out of talented producers/directors.
They are in short supply of QUALITY written material to produce, as the rehashing of of old comic book scripts.
This movie was crap, total crap, and I'm glad I pirated it for free and didn't get ripped off by Hollywood's overpaid, fat and bloated actors/executives.
Not withstanding,,,they come after us for illegally DLing this shit, wherein we should sue THEM for insulting and assaulting us with this crap!"
,LordCorwin,2011-07-26T17:13Z,"Best cam I can recall seeing in a long time, pretty good movie, thanks for the effort.

@pennknig - I wouldn't blame hollywood completely, you also need to blame the theater industry for charging $12/ticket and $10/large popcorn, that personally is why I don't like to go to the movies."
,truebeliever1969,2011-07-27T10:31Z,"One of the best cam jobs you'll probably ever see.

V=7 A=6

I liked the movie. They followed the original Marvel storyline pretty closely. Referenced the Old Timely comics version too."
