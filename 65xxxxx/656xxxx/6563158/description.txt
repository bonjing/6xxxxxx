Episode 9 Synopsis
"Cyrax and Sektor"
Cyrax and Sektor are chosen to be the future of the Lin Kuei by the Grand Master, but Cyrax is less than enthusiastic about giving his life over to a cybernetic transformation that will erase his memories and turn him into the ultimate fighting machine. When he discovers that the cyborg he is fighting seems closely familiar, Sektor must keep Cyrax focused on destroying Hydro, and not himself or their future...
