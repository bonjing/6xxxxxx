In the near future, the world's industrial infrastructure has been severely hampered by global shortages of oil. With the slowing pace of business and progress, all eyes are on a remote island, where an amazing new natural resource has been discovered: Mittron.
On Mittron Island, the usage of petroleum products is defunct; refined Mittron now powers all modes of transportation. The performance of automobiles in particular, has shown the potential of the new fuel. Cars fueled by Mittron can run faster, longer, and cleaner. And with the lower mining and refining costs required by Mittron, world leaders are watching the island with excitement, hoping to import the new resource and learn techniques for discovery and refining.

The OMD government, the managing body of Mittron Island, is also eager to form agreements with the rest of the world for sharing Mittron technology. However, a terrible threat to the world's progress has surfaced. Mysterious cars called HUVs terrorize the streets of Mittron Island, disrupting the normal ebb and flow of society. The sheer volume of HUV-related incidents occupies so much of the OMD government's resources that professional drivers have been imported to Mittron Island to help cope with the increased workload. As a new OMD Driver, you will carry out missions that the OMD government assigns to you at the different Stations you work out of. Whether you're chasing down HUVs, delivering doughnuts or smoking other drivers in the Battle Zone, your skills as a driver will determine your success on Mittron Island.
