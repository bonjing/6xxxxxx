SUMMARY:
PRIEST, a post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller, is set in an alternate world -- 
one ravaged by centuries of war between man and vampires. The story revolves 
around a legendary Warrior Priest from the last Vampire War who now lives in 
obscurity among the other downtrodden human inhabitants in walled-in dystopian 
cities ruled by the Church. When his niece is abducted by a murderous pack 
of vampires, Priest breaks his sacred vows to venture out on a quest to 
find her before they turn her into one of them. He is joined on his crusade 
by his niece's boyfriend, a trigger-fingered young wasteland sheriff, and a 
former Warrior Priestess who possesses otherworldly fighting skills.
