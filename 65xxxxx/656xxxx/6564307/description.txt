Nagoya - Day 15 2011
Welcome back Sumo fans!  After a long hiatus, we finally have Televised Coverage from NHK.  I have in this time, upgraded my PC and my ISP has also upgraded my service, which should get the seeding going great! (knock on wood, cross fingers, etc.)

Resolution:	720 x 480
Source:		Non-HD NTSC Cable source
Languages :	 Japanese and English
Processed through S-Cable and edited with Sony Vegas Pro 9.0 (once per language) and recoded to .AVI with Quick Media Converter 3.6.5  (again once per language) and finally combined with AviMux_GUI to create the dual language file.  

Hereâ€™s the final day of the July Basho from Nagoya.  I hope that your favourites have done well.  As always, I will continue to seed until the next Basho, which is in September (11th-25th) in Tokyo at the Kokugikan.  http://www.sumo.or.jp/eng/ 

 SEE YOU NEXT BASHO!!!!!!!
