Sandra's ass looks amazing in this set. Yum Yum.
And it looks like next week we'll be getting some see through titties.
Hopefully some topples to following in Virginia's lead.
We can only hope for some bottomless also."

,DaveXDeep,2011-07-26T00:47Z,In another upload are some candid pics of Sandra Holiday snaps & so on plus they appear genuine however 2 are of her heavily pregnant. That seems to suggest that what we are seeing is old material stock piled & cahnces are once it run out thats it for us Sandra fans.
,Gunnar_Sigmundson,2011-07-27T05:26Z,Do you have a link to that upload? 
,aka_NL,2011-07-29T04:33Z,"Well ,,, i don't know why she stopped modeling at all during most of her pregnancy,,,,, some guys like that stuff,,,,,,, not saying i do ,,, but am wondering about what that dweeb husband that got her 2 quit looks like.( lucky SOAB )

In all seriousness. 
She ain't coming back,,,, what ,,, she gonna pose with a baby breastfeeding in a couple of the shots,,,,,,,
Come on guys ,,,,,Think."

People have said she married a zombie.  Assuming the following image link wasn't manipulated, I can kinda see what they mean....

Even if someone did touch that up a bit, I still think she could have done better....then again, it gives me hope that even a shlub like me could, in theory, score a hotty with a rockin body."
,aka_NL,2011-07-31T18:32Z,"Thanks for the pic maxd1978
All i can say is WOW
He must be loaded lol.
Don't think there's much that can be touched up in the pic, besides copy and pasting a whole different guy in there.
If he's not loaded your theory = right :)"
,aka_NL,2011-08-04T05:04Z,"@ craig_emt
Thanks for the link,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and in a reaction.
Dude,,,,,, No amount of hair can fix that face,,,,, well maybe if he does let his hair grow and resembles cousin IT from the Adams Family.
Think that would help him.
He's one lucky SOB in landing her."
