Martha and the Muffins\\\' 1981 album This is the Ice Age, produced by Daniel Lanois and the band, was recorded in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario. More experimental than previous efforts, it also gained significant Canadian radio airplay from the singles \\\"Women Around the World at Work\\\" (a #24 hit in Canada, peaking on November 7 of the same year on the RPM national singles chart)[1] and \\\"Swimming\\\".
