I'll make a short description, because I'm out of time.



1) It includes all DLCs (yes, Legacy too), patch 1.03 and crack.

2) Everything will be installed automatically. You don't need to crack or patch anything - I've pre-cracked it.

3) My repack of ALL game DLCs weights LESS (!) than official installer for DLC "Legacy". Mine weights 812 megabytes and contains all DLCs, while "Legacy" installer weights 844 megabytes. Mine also installs faster because it does not unpack into "Temp" folder.



From the Readme:


Dragon Age II DLC Pack includes the following DLCs:

- Black Emporium
- Legacy
- Mage Item Pack
- Pre-Order Bonus Items
- Ring of Whispers
- Rogue Item Pack
- Signature Edition Items
- The Antivan Garrote
- The Exiled Prince
- Warrior Item Pack

The DLC Pack also patches your game to version 1.03.

Notes:

* You may (depending on an Act you are playing) need to access your Special Deliveries chest twice in order to obtain Signature Edition and Pre-Order Bonus Items. Which means that you will need to exit the house, and return again.
* In order to have the Mabari war hound in your party, you need to open the character's ability tree, and drag the Summon Mabari icon to your on-screen ability quick-access list.


***Access "Legacy" DLC through a statue in your house!***


P.S. Seems F-Secure anti-virus started detecting *all* of my installers as trojans again. Don't know why, don't care. Maybe Avira too. I suggest you either sort this problem out with the developers, or switch to a better anti-virus.
