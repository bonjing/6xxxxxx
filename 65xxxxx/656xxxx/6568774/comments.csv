,illiria,2011-07-28T13:05Z,"@ logitech1000
@ athanh8807

Thank you :)

@ Sebilion

Yeah, works fine. I even copied the pack to another computer just to test. Worked flawlessly."
,uroshuchiha92,2011-07-28T13:48Z,Is this version of legacy cracked?
,illiria,2011-07-28T14:04Z,"@ uroshuchiha92

Of course this is cracked. Everything is cracked there, including Legacy."
,krino4,2011-07-28T14:24Z,"Illiria, thank you so much for your time and effort. I have been waiting for your release in order to play Legacy. I wish you very nice summer vacations with friends and family.

,melloyello33,2011-07-28T14:51Z,Thanks a lot Illiria. You're the best!!
,illiria,2011-07-28T15:05Z,"@ krino4

Thank you very much, best wishes to you too. :) I'm glad to see people are waiting for my releases.

@ DL_Dragon
@ melloyello33

My pleasure. Thanks for the interest. :)"
,The_UnKn0wN,2011-07-28T15:06Z,do you have 2 put all in 1? can't you do both? All in one and each one seperate so we don't have 2 install everyone again each time there's a new add on...?
,Brometheus-Broseidon-III,2011-07-28T16:05Z,"I just registered, simply so I could thank you for this. Cheers illiria, for so swiftly putting together a complete and very easy to use DLC pack."
,halkola,2011-07-28T16:08Z,"Thanks!  I'll be seeding this for a while at hopefully 300kb/s(the max I can UL without lagging too much.

Just a question though, can I install this over your previous re-pack or will I need to remove those first, and then install this one?"
,illiria,2011-07-28T16:14Z,"@ The_UnKn0wN

Right now my full pack weights LESS than official ""Legacy"" DLC installer alone. Here, you get everything in 812 megabytes, while in original, ""Legacy"" alone weights 844.

It also installs faster than original ""Legacy"". Weights less, installs faster, patches your game... You really have no reason to complain. 

Now when other DLCs come out, we will see what to do.

-----

Besides, here everything is cracked properly, and no items are missing. Not many other torrents can do the same. Downloading and installing from multiple torrents, you have a chance to screw up your game if you do something incorrectly, or uploader submits wrong DLC activator, or messes up the description.
It's really best when everything is properly done for you and gathered in one package."
,slacker2079,2011-07-28T16:17Z,"Another great torrent illiria, thanks a lot!
A pink-green-blue skull from me ;-D"
,illiria,2011-07-28T16:19Z,"@ halkola

Ypu don't have to delete my (or anyone's) previous packages, simply install on top. Installer will overwire anything that needs to be overwritten. If uninstalling was necessary, I would have included an uninstaller.

And you don't really have to seed if you have a slow connection. Many people already do, many people will. I go easy on this.

@ Brometheus-Broseidon-III

Glad you like it, you're welcome. :)"
,MyobiPT,2011-07-28T17:59Z,Got to fucking love your work 
,uroshuchiha92,2011-07-28T18:01Z,"@ illiria 
Thanks. I noticed. I just finished it. Took me around 2-3 hours to see and do everything in Legacy. Even did the last fight two times first siding with Larius and second with em forgot her name. I hope you all noticed what happens in the last scene. Don't want to spoil it for you who didn't finish it yet but... look closer at the background during the cinematic after the last fight."
,Cireagle,2011-07-28T18:29Z,"...cir: oohh another dlc, now just download, fetch crack, copy and paste this .. then paste that ... edit some files and hope for ... *sees repack by illiria* ahh scratch that .. dl repack ..press install.. fetch a beer and play ;) .... thank you illiria for another great dlc repack - your work is greatly appreciated :)  "
,illiria,2011-07-28T18:41Z,"@ Cireagle

,Vins_4m,2011-07-28T20:03Z,"I've downloaded lots of gigas from piratebay, yet this is the first time I say ""THANK YOU FOR THIS AWESOME TORRENT""."
,hittinskinz,2011-07-28T20:46Z,thanks a lot for this. nice & simple.
,whoasy,2011-07-28T21:30Z,"I do have a problem with your patch. Your previous versions all worked splendid and I really like the all-in-one package. This one dough has a problem; the lecagy content is not available.

I could not find the statue in my house and when I checked the DLC manager, it didn't say anything about Legacy.

Is there a way to help you, or to check how I can do the process so it works?"
,illiria,2011-07-28T22:22Z,"@ whoasy

The quest entry should be named, if I'm not mistaken, ""A Memento of the Past"". I heard a report of someone not being able to find a statue (it's a bird-like statue) in Hawke's Estate. If this is indeed a bug, and sometimes the statue does not spawn, then it is a DLC bug, not a bug in my repack. If so, all we can do is wait for a patch.
There is a chance you could have missed the bird-like statue, it doesnt look too obvious in the surroundings. Also you may try to reinstall the pack. I assure you that it is cracked and packed properly, the rest (if they exist) are not my issues, I'm afraid. Can't say much about them."
,lootsrus,2011-07-28T22:51Z,"It appears the Tracker is down, i'm not able to get the file from this torrent, help please!?!"
,lootsrus,2011-07-28T22:57Z,"It appears the tracker must be down to this, as i'm unable to download from any seeders, please help!"
,lootsrus,2011-07-28T23:14Z,"Keep telling me tracker is down, not able to get this wonderful file, any help with this would be greatly appreciated!!"
,lootsrus,2011-07-28T23:15Z,"Sorry for double comment, it never showed me the first one until the second was posted, my apologies."
,illiria,2011-07-28T23:29Z,"@ lootsrus

How do you suggest I help?"
,lootsrus,2011-07-29T00:54Z,"I honestly dont know, i'm relatively new to the torrent thing, although i've downloaded torrents today so I know its working, just not this one, hoped youd know what could be done."
,Syteri,2011-07-29T01:53Z,Does it do it automatically? (The Patch I mean)
,illiria,2011-07-29T14:41Z,"@ Syteri

My repack automatically patches your game to the version 1.03 and installs all the DLCs, then copies over the new (patched) crack. Yes, it does everything automatically. Just install and you're done.

The crack (original FairLight) was modified to provide access to Signature Edition bonus items.

@ lootsrus

Torrent works fine for me and others. Problem must be on your end then. I don't know what to suggest."
,Gitzerai,2011-07-29T17:52Z,"So,1 question.If i use this torrent on my game(I beat it already,yep), will be there some problems with Sebastian,like if i choose Anders and Seb walked away to Starkheven?I mean,if i use this dlc again,wouldn't that kill my savegame like *You can't run this save coz blah-blah-blah.Play again.?"
,tieten1000,2011-07-29T17:57Z,hmm i can't find any seeds or anything? 
,illiria,2011-07-29T18:20Z,"@ Gitzerai

You better ask BioWare this question, I have no idea. I am a repacker, not a game developer. :) But I don't think it would cause any problems, I'm sure they have thought it all through during DLC development.
Besides, some people said they've passed ""Legacy"" with my repack after the endgame, and everything worked flawlessly."
,Furious1964,2011-07-29T18:47Z,The selection for anything in the menus (dialog and game) and in-game items appears to be off center. I have to go to the side of everything just to select it. But it's a great crack though. Any reason why this might happen?
,illiria,2011-07-29T19:31Z,"@ Furious1964

This is probably due to some issues with your video drivers. This is most definitely not crack-related. It's a standard FairLight crack, nobody has problems with it."
,lootsrus,2011-07-30T04:24Z,"WOOT Got it to work, sorry for all my questions, ends up I had to use a 3rd different torrent client, thanks for your hard work, you rock!"
,culprit12,2011-07-30T05:41Z,had to create an account just to tell you thanks for the patch.  you make things alot easier.  keep up the good work.
,culprit12,2011-07-30T05:43Z,illiria you rock.  keep up the awesome work.
,deceive,2011-07-30T08:50Z,"hey just installed from a clean install using the Dragon.Age.2-RELOADED copy and then install this DLC patch from here i go to run the game from C:\Program Files (x86)\Dragon Age 2\bin_ship\DragonAge2.exe and then EA asks me to sign into my EA account and then tells me my CD-Key is not genuine anybody have any ideas on how to bypass this ? 

______
ive tried it with the reloaded crack and with out. as i do understand that with this DLC u do not need a crack and ive tried it with the THETA 1.03 crack and both of those load the game but then makes the game crash at the Dragon cut scene after you slay the ogre in the begging of the game does anyone else have this problem? does anyone else have any idea's on how i might be able to fix this?"
,illiria,2011-07-30T09:50Z,"@ deceive

First question: does the installer detect your game directory properly? If it doesn't, then choose the game folder manually.
There is no great mystery to it, everything is pre-cracked. You only need to unpack it into your game folder.

Maybe it's some sort of issue with registry keys (installer reads game path from the registry. For example registry states: ""C:\Program files..."", while the actual folder is ""C:\Program files (x86)..."".

So as I said, make sure it unpacks into your game folder."
,Gitzerai,2011-07-30T12:27Z,"Thx for answering!)Beat game,yep,this doesn't looks like it can make some bugs if you have already installed other dlc.Works perfectly for me,tyvm!"
,deceive,2011-07-30T14:55Z,"it unpacks and installs perfectly without asking for an install folder so yes it detects the game folder on its own its just without me placing some other kind of crack into the bin_ship folder it wont start just keeps asking for an activation key im going to try installing it in administrator mode and ill get back to you 

____
just finished installing in admin mode and still no difference also tried running the DragonAge2.exe in admin without luck...   im running windows 7 ultimate 64bit, 6gb's RAM,intel core i7 950 and a Nvidia GTX560 the windows HDD is a 120GB OCZ agility just incase any of that helps /:"
,illiria,2011-07-30T17:12Z,"@ deceive

Hm... Judging by your description, something prevents the crack from being copied. Windows, or anti-virus. If the game keeps asking you to register it, the crack isn't there. Something must have intervened with the installation. I wonder what... Some sort of protection?

Download crack to the version 1.03 (FairLight, if I'm not mistaken), and try it. Should work, but the items from Signature Edition will be missing. They are not supported by the cracks. They require additional patching. I have done that on my crack, but your Windows refuses to copy it over."
,plastecuti,2011-07-30T17:15Z,"Thanks, works like a charm."
,Smuggles,2011-07-30T18:16Z,works perfectly. thank you.
,reffu42,2011-07-30T20:52Z,Everything Works great but when trying to get on the surface near the end the game crashes and hangs my computer. I have the latest ATI Graphics drivers and windows 7 ultimate 64 bit. I've tried disabling antivirus and lowering graphics but nothing helps. Any ideas would be great. Thanks
,maronics,2011-07-31T19:16Z,"Kinda doesn't work for me, instantly crashes after the intro with Varric. 

But I guess that's an issue with the dlc itself. :["
,slacker2079,2011-08-01T01:47Z,"@maronics
I had the same problem with you and my graphic card is nvidia.
From the Bioware's technical support forum: 
""IF YOU'RE CRASHING IN DX11 WITH NVIDIA CARDS:
Please be advised that we're aware of the crash issues in DX11 with Nvidia drivers 275.33. You will need to use earlier drivers or wait until the new 280.xx comes out some time in the near future. I'll update this accordingly when those drivers are available.  Thanks. ""
Personally i didn't downgrade my drivers.Try to scaled down to high to skip the problem, then slide your settings back to very high.That worked for me"
,illiria,2011-08-01T19:59Z,"@ maronics
@ slacker2079

Glad to see people are starting to find workarounds for crashes. Yes, it is not an issue with the repack. Once again I'll dare to repeat that me and other people have played and passed everything with no problem.

Sorry for constantly repeating that, I just don't want any misunderstandings."
,sooka89,2011-08-02T03:56Z,Thanx for the pack its works Great with everything except Legacy it dosnt show in my Quest journal and the statue that start it isnt Active ... what should i do in this matter ?
,Edmort20,2011-08-02T05:46Z,"Pay attention to the description:

***Access ""Legacy"" DLC through a statue in your house!***


Have a good game!"
,sooka89,2011-08-02T10:48Z,i know that and i said the Statue isnt there ... my problem is that i find Legacy in the DLC Menu befor i load my game but when i loade there nothing in the house and there nothing in the quest menu that pointing to Legacy at all .
,athanh8807,2011-08-03T02:13Z,"OMG, now RELOEADED release, so late....
What do you think, illiria ?
(sorry for my bad English)"
,illiria,2011-08-03T11:19Z,"@ sooka89

You are the third person it has happened with. The bug in which statue does not appear. It is not repack-related, it seems to be some bug within the game or DLC itself. Very rare bug, too. But I have no idea what causes it. Maybe the statue does not appear in certain parts of the game? Try earlier/later save. Maybe reinstall the game. Or maybe try to start a new game. I have no way of knowing what causes game bugs, sorry.

@ athanh8807

I have no opinion on the RELOADED release, if it is legit. RELOADED is a great team, which has made many amazing releases in the past. I like them, and I hope they will be back on their feet, and give us many more great releases in the future."
,Thompson93,2011-08-03T17:19Z,"Thanks illiria.

It working and i test it in  two campaigns 
one after complete DA][  and 
one in my new character ""act 1"" (but  the quest say ""FIND NEW HOME"") 

When the save loaded, a quest came up :P went  to the statue and said if i would like to play DA][: Legacy and then.... ya khow !!! 
I did not complete legacy,  i played only at the begin with Varric. (cutscene)

,feelthevibe,2011-08-11T01:50Z,"Hello, I'm kinda new here, and was hoping for illiria to help me out. i've installed the pack and when i try to press start, it says: ""This application has failed to start because d3dcompiler_43.dll was not fount."". I'm guessing the crack has to do something with it. I've also tryed puting the Fairlight crack but still the same. The game is the Reloaded release. Please help me out."
,illiria,2011-08-13T15:24Z,"@ feelthevibe

Crack has nothing to do with it. Some file is missing. And not even my repack file. D3D... Looks like you need to reinstall the game and/or DirectX.
Try reinstalling DirectX first."
