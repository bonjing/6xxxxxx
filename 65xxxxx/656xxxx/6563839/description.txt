This solid, high resistance top loading box twin wagon has a 78.6 tonnes carrying capacity and is designed for transportation of bulk materials such as ballast or sand.

The MJA wagon has a unique and unusual coupling system at one end, known as the coupling bar - which forms the wagon into pairs or a twin. At the other end is a standard buffer and screw link coupling system so that it can connect to other twin pairs or a locomotive.

In this package a custom sound set is included which contains many subtle sounds recorded from real MJA wagons. All of the sounds have been compiled to ensure maximum clarity, with a feeling of high dynamic range.

A bonus exclusive modern Class 47 with front-end, cab and sound adjustments is also included.
