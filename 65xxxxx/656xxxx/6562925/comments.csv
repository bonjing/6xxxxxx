,h4mm3r01,2011-09-09T01:00Z,"Works Great!! W7 x64
If you end up with Error 20 don't panic, you probably missed one of the steps, for me I forgot to disconnect from the internet. But to fix it it's fairly easy. Reinstalling it will do nothing, Maya saves it's registration data outside the maya folder and outside the registry as a security measure. To find the registration data you need to goto C:\ProgramData
It's a hidden folder so just copy that address into the search bar. Then go and delete the FLEXnet Folder,  it may not allow you to delete it, in which case start the task manager and goto processes and find the FLEXnet process and stop it. Then delete the FLEXnet folder and follow the instructions better this time. Good Luck!"
,i_steal_media_hohoho,2011-09-09T05:10Z,"Really straight forward. Cheers Reekded, you deserve a skull. Unfortunately I just found out I don't have the right hardware for mudbox - gutted!"
,mlord66,2011-09-15T06:15Z,"hi so when i followed all the steps, i got Motion Builder, Mudbox, Softimage working. BUT maya itself doesnt work. 

at first, i got a d3dx9_42.dll is missing error so i took care of that buy pasting in the .dll file in c/windows

then i got a new error saying:
the application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b) click OK to close the application

,adrianos1995,2011-09-19T18:43Z,"I downloaded the product, but i have problems activating it, i click the ""I have an activation code from Autodesk"" option but after that there appear 16 of those things to put the code, what am i supposed to do there?"
,nefarious.soulwhisper,2011-09-22T23:39Z,"It isnt working for me, the serials included dont work, and the steps i was told to take dont work either, it asks for a serial key, and all the ones i was given dont work, and the keygen doesnt generate a proper serial, it gives me stuff like: TRYUJ1G2489  when i need something like this: 120-02020244 [examples, not actual codes]     So, i have the program installed, just need a serial key that works."
,nefarious.soulwhisper,2011-09-22T23:42Z,"Can someone help? the serial keys provided dont work, and i tried to do the steps, but those dont work either it says i need to be connected to the internet. And i tried different serial templates like you said?"
,nefarious.soulwhisper,2011-09-23T00:42Z,FIGURED IT OUT! thank you. *bows*
,nycdcheat,2011-10-16T18:12Z,"i extracted the xf-a2012-64bits rar file in the cracks folder using 7zip, but before i could run it, it autodeletes, help please"
,DrCloogey,2011-10-16T20:02Z,"nefarious.souwhisper, i seem to be having the same problem. can you tell me what you did?"
,DrCloogey,2011-10-16T20:12Z,The serial key doesnt seem to be working =(
,DrCloogey,2011-10-16T22:34Z,"Nevermind i figured it out. In case someone else has the same problem, go ALL the way back once you get the request code"
,nycdcheat,2011-10-17T02:54Z,all the way back where?
,nycdcheat,2011-10-17T03:29Z,"x-force kegen keeps crashing, can some1 enter the code for me and then tell me the activation code? 
XD5Z 97ZD 0EA9 X0FG 4C4E AD7H Y7LV QJJZ-that is the request code"
,MyewMix,2011-11-07T04:08Z,It seems like the X-Force keygen is generating 7 less characters than it should be (only filling the first character of the 15th input line).  I followed the instructions step-by-step.  Anyone know what I might be doing wrong?. 
,MyewMix,2011-11-07T04:18Z,"Ah!  Nevermind, I got it to work.  I went and deleted the Flexnet folder, as previously suggested, and the only other thing I did differently, was I copied and pasted the whole code rather than individually typing each letter, as I did before.  "
,holzmcgyver,2011-11-15T21:13Z,"the installation will work proper, if you do the same as for the versions of autodeskproduct before.
You must apply the mempatch, before clicking the activate button the second time, dont press mempetch if youare inside the registrationwindow,thts to late and an error occured, bye "
,holzmcgyver,2011-11-15T21:21Z,"you must apply the mempatch before press the activaionbutton the second time, just like as for the earlier versions."
