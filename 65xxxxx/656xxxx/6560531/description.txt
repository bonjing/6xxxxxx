In this course, you will learn:

    What is Shirk?

    Is the Muslim Ummah Protected from Shirk?

    Is the ruling concerning a grave-worshiper different from the ruling concerning those who worshiped the idols during the time of Allahâ€™s Messenger?

    Do we call anybody who calls upon the dead, or makes Tawaaf around their grave out of respect, or worships the dead - a Mushrik right away?
     

    Is seeking Barakah (blessings) from the creation an act of Shirk?

    Is there Barakah in the remnants of the Prophet after his death?
     

    Who is a Wali? What is Karamah? Is Karamah necessary for Wilayah?

    Does Allah honor his Wali by causing his Karamah to benefit people even after his death?
     

    What is Shafa'ah (intercession) and its types?

    What are the different Shafa'ah that are special for Prophet Muhammad?

    What are the conditions of the approved Shafa'ah?

    How is it to ask Shafa'ah or Dua from the Prophet while he is in his grave?

May Allah make us amongst those who listen and benefit,
and may Allah increase the ranks of all the scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah, who indeed are the inheritors of the Prophet.
May the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon our messenger Muhammed, upon his family and upon those who follow his path until the Last Day.
