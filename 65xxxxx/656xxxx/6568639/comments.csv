Kaise123"
,kaise123,2011-07-29T16:52Z,"Sorry about that guys, seeding at about 55kb/s now on someones elses internet (otherwise on my speed it'd be about 5) should get some copies out now. Open for mod suggestions, but they will not be released until the next MC update.

,Andvariedfire,2011-07-30T05:34Z,"So does 1.7 have server files? An updated minecraft-server so i can run one offline? 

Planning on running a server on lan, but can't find the files except for the 1.2, and it's so old and buggy, it's not worth it"
,kaise123,2011-07-30T10:52Z,"@Andvariedfire; This one does not have server files, but if you email me i will send an email back with files attatched already set up for LAN play. I also host a server over LAN at my school. if you need griefing protection i can instruct you with that as well. my email is in the read me ^^^^"
,lulGAMER,2011-07-30T16:56Z,could you mac a mac version?
,PornoRune,2011-07-30T20:20Z,"I finally got it, and so far ( just opened the install file ) it looks great ! i really looks forward to try it xD Thanks a lot dude !"
,amberwithwings,2011-07-31T02:05Z,"It downloaded and installed fine, but it wont open.
I even have the latest Java."
,kaise123,2011-07-31T03:03Z,"@lulGAMER: I dont have a cav but if you install this on a friends Pc and copy .minecraft from appdata ill bet u can play it, a friend of mine got it to work that way.

@amberwithwings: What version did you install (Full, full+aether etc) and do you get any error message from it and what operating system are you on?"
,kaise123,2011-07-31T03:04Z,cav = Mac* fail
,scottm3sscudi,2011-08-01T21:12Z,the download was quick and easy but its not letting me destroy stuff for the materials... any help would be appreciated
,kaise123,2011-08-02T04:39Z,"@scottm3sscudi; Do you mean when you hit osmething and break it, you never get the block?, Is this in single player? and what are you trying to mine and with what tool (You cant mine rock without a pickaxe) watch some tutorials on youtube. if you think you are doing it right, sent me an email"
,djroosta,2011-08-03T18:13Z,"Installed fine :) And clean

Only problem i get is the unlicensed text after a while... especially when i do it over hamachi, as i am re-creating castlevania with a few folks..... and recording has to stop whenever that comes up :(

Overall, good upload :D"
,kaise123,2011-08-04T05:41Z,"@djroosta; i have seen the text come up a few times but i think only for one version, could you tell me what version you installed and i will tell you how to fix it."
,djroosta,2011-08-05T00:14Z,"@Kaise123 - It's cool, i got it sorted :)

i went into some of its files, and removed something, lol.. it is now fixed :D

Thank you anyway, i appreciate the help :D"
,Barroquecore,2011-08-08T06:47Z,Downloaded alright. I choose to install Full and I can play the game but no mods are installed. There's a mods folder created when the game is installed; it contains text files regarding items and crafting.
,kaise123,2011-08-08T15:14Z,"@Barroquecore; There are mods, but you need to know how to use them. Try pressing F for flying and press E and Q to go up/down :)"
,DallonXcore,2011-08-09T14:15Z,dude idk what i did or smething but whenever i try to grab items from the tab (all items) it shuts down says saving chunks then its a black screen. and i tried each download with that mod. help.
,kaise123,2011-08-10T09:08Z,"@DallonXcore; yer that is what happens when you install the Aether version, if you don't use/want the aether than just install the Full version"
,Barroquecore,2011-08-11T00:08Z,"Ugh, I made the stupid mistake of installing it on another folder; I reinstalled in the suggested folder and now the mods work. Thanks!"
,DallonXcore,2011-08-11T02:44Z,i want both with mods but is that not possible?
,kaise123,2011-08-11T11:30Z,"@DallonXcore; Yes it is possible, but when you get the firdt item in your inventory in any world it will crash, while it says saving chunks close the game and than open it up again and load. you should see the item you got in your inventory and now you can do whatever you want, with no crashes, just be careful not to completely empty your inventory

There is currently no fix for this. You may also need to try a few times to make it work."
,FishRCool,2011-08-13T05:19Z,"I have installed it and everything it worked Great thanks BUT (yea i know) every time i spawn something with TMI or anything else it says ""saving chunks""!!! somehow i got rid of it but i dont know how and it is back now so can u help me plz?"
,FishRCool,2011-08-13T10:22Z,"I CANT COLLECT ANYTHING EITHER!!!!! PLZ HELP ME!!!

Oh and some good mods are:
1. Mo'Creatures by Dr. Zhark
2. Mo'Creeps and Wierdos by freakstritch 
3. Mo'Trees by nandonalt"
,Hobo197a1,2011-08-15T22:04Z,"love the first verson of this mod, and this one im getting too, is it possible to include humans+ in this mod or the Millinare (spelling) mod I've tried to patch it into your other minecraft 1.7.3 download but it dosen't work and seems to disable all the other mods."
,Hobo197a1,2011-08-16T02:10Z,"Ok, i got the humans+ mod to partially install, it shows various protips on load, and a short message about wells and the like, but no villagers show up, i cannot find anyone else, and anytime i try to access the inventory it goes 'saving chunks' and crashanes.. So again any hope of adding humans+ and the Mo' monsters mod? Another interesting one would be ClaySoldiers, it adds an entierly new type of gameplay "
,kaise123,2011-08-16T14:25Z,"Anyone having problems with the game crashing whenever you try and get an item, I would recommend you reinstall without the Aether, because it is what causes the crashes along with toomanyitems, as far as i know. If you insist on using it with the Aether than you can follow these instructions, I have not tested them, but they are reported to be working.

1.) Open the game and load your level
2.) before trying to do anything at all, press escape  and save and quit to title.
3.) Open the same level again and try to get an item.

it should now work correctly, and you will not need to do it again until you next lose all of the items in your inventory.

If it did not work, try the solution i provided for DallonXcore at the top of page 2."
,kaise123,2011-08-16T14:33Z,"Also to you who are installing more mods, what you are trying to install conflicts with the mods I currently have, therefore stopping them from working correctly.
Install the 'no mods' version and if you can get it to work, start there and then go to the Full version and try the same procedure and see if it works than. look if there are any merged files for the mod and than see if any are for the mods listed in the readme. If you just cannot get it to work, send me an email with the mods you want attached and I will add them but i might not be able to include all of the mods due to conflicts."
,george994,2011-08-17T08:01Z,"I downloaded the full version but it wont let me play/open it. I also tried the basic version, same thing. i hav latest java too. "
,kaise123,2011-08-17T12:09Z,"@george994; Can you please give me some of your system info please (OS, RAM, CPU Etc). Are there any error messages? if so please make a screen shot and email them (if you can) or post them here somehow.

Also what loader are you using (Normal or Alternative)"
,scrdppy,2011-08-22T10:54Z,"so far, I installed the Basic version(that is: minecraft as you buy it - but still cracked) and the normal loader (Play Minecraft shortcut) doesn't work - nothing happens - , but the Alternative Loader (shortcut) works. Also using jdk7 (must be 32bit, had only 64bit before and complained - it's ok, understandable)
Since I'm kinda new to this, what would I need to run a 2 player game? I assume some server software and tunngle(or maybe it works with real IP addresses also?)?"
,scrdppy,2011-08-22T10:54Z,"nuggets, forgot to say, on win 7 64bit"
,scrdppy,2011-08-22T11:19Z,"Ok, I just downloaded the official minecraft server from their site, and then set  online-mode=false in file: server.properties
else I cannot join (thanks emcee214's comment somewhere else)
Thing is, I cannot break/pick any block, when about to be destroyed it gets reset to normal again, that is a block cannot be destroyed (ie. sand).
This is in the Basic (no mods) install.
Any ideas please?"
,scrdppy,2011-08-22T11:21Z,"btw, it works well in single player(blocks can be destoryed and picked up) :) but not in multiplayer with the official minecraft server (as described above)"
,scrdppy,2011-08-22T11:44Z,"I just tried it in a virtualbox-ed ubuntu and it works, with the windows server, and now the windows version of minecraft also works with the same windows server, it is then my guess that the first time I run the server (and it creates the world) the client(s) will fail to break any blocks until the server gets restarted (close and run again), either that or the updated that I did to minecraft fixed this."
,scrdppy,2011-08-22T12:21Z,I had to add some sound files manually (at leas in Basic install) - seems they were missing
,kaise123,2011-08-27T08:09Z,"@scrdppy; Hey, goot to know you got the game working ok and with the multiplayer you have done the exact right thing. You are not the first person to report that they cannot place/remove blocks in multiplayer, but i am not sure of the cause (Minecraft glitch maybe?). I have uploaded bukkit server files to TPB (just look in thepiratebay.org/user/kaise123 and get the one called minecraft bukkit server etc... if you want it, as it supports server plugins) 

with the sound files i have removed them to save  bandwidth and on my setup they automatically download as you play the game (so you need an active internet connection wile you are playing.

(From the readme: 'To hear in-game sounds you need to have an active internet connection IN-GAME, because it downloads them as-you-play.'


ALSO anyone who receives a Minecraft update im not sure why it says there is an update because there is not, it is fine to update but if you have mods you will lose them. If you want to keep the mods just don't update. "
,kaise123,2011-08-27T08:11Z,"Also, when playing in your own multiplayer game you may need to move 16 blocks away from your spawn point to dig/place blocks. Try that"
,Girald,2011-08-28T10:12Z,Kaise123 Can you put Minecraft with the Archaeology mod PLZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!
,kaise123,2011-09-02T09:26Z,maybe in 1.8... if i can get it on
,peds224,2012-01-25T04:01Z,does this include the zeppelin mod if not could u give me some tips on how to install it plz and thank you
