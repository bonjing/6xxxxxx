CHANGELOG 6.95
-------------------------------------
Special new in version 6,95
AI ships should manoeuvre more efficiently.
CAI composition of armies and navies should be better.
CAI Lite campaign handicaps were working the opposite (!) so I made them to work as intended. You should now notice insane difficulty in Hard mode and above. Thanks to shokh for the very helpful feedback about this.
Note: The gameplay of 6,95 maybe different/better comparing to the unofficial DMUC 7,0 that few people have, because it was a beta version not finally tested by me.
