Community college professor Ira Kane (David Duchovny) is invited by geology teacher/girls' volleyball coach Harry Block (Orlando Jones) to investigate a meteor that has crashed into a network of underground caverns under the sleepy Arizona town of Glen Canyon. They collect a sample and find that it contains extraterrestrial single-celled nitrogen-based organisms, which evolve into multi-celled organisms by the time Ira gets Harry to his office to see the discovery they made.
