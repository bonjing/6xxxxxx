,khannies3,2011-07-29T22:36Z,Dear i m seeding it already :)
,tyrant9,2011-08-11T03:37Z,Wow it works. Thank's a lot this helped me fix my windows 7 :D
,s3ah3n,2011-08-25T20:20Z,"Still works. NB: If you've tried to run Windows Anytime Upgrade, even if the key didn't validate, you'll have to reboot before running this, because the upgrade will still install and the new edition will expect a different key."
,Soldiers9,2011-12-07T15:15Z,"Works Perfect! Just simple follow the instructions in the 5 pictures or Launch the program called Loader and wait a bit sometimes it takes awhile to load, once loaded choose a Manufacture (OEM) and click Ok on the alert, then click Install/Remove loader and once it's done it will auto restart your computer and once booted everything will be set and ready.
If any ways gets a virus warning it's a False Positive (virus protection thinks it's a virus because the suspicious coding) and if it doesn't work it's on you so don't blame the up loader.
By the way I have tested this on 4 computers and it works fine."
