""Religions"" like this make it obvious how religions operate. Tell you to believe some stories, whatever it is, mix in a few miracles, and then repeat and repeat so that you heard it so often that you cannot distinguish the story from reality.

Which does not change the truth, the story is and stays a story, without proof, without evidence.

And then they start to kill each other because they believe in different stories. Now how crazy is that!"
