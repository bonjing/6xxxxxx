sister. Blue Jones [Oscar Isaac], one of the asylum's orderlies, is bribed by Babydoll's
stepfather into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski [Carla
Gugino], to have Babydoll lobotomized, so she can neither inform the authorities of the true

fortune. As Babydoll enters the institution, she takes note of several items that would be
