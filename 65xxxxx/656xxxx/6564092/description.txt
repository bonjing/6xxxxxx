Neverwhere (1996)

An urban fantasy television series by Neil Gaiman and Lenny Henry that first aired in 1996 on BBC Two. The series is set in "London Below", a magical realm coexisting with the more familiar London, referred to as "London Above". 

Richard Mayhew leads an ordinary life in London when one day a girl named Door falls, injured, across his path. The next thing he knows, his life is gone and he's pulled into the fantastical world of London Below. Pursued by the murderous Messrs. Croup and Vandemar, Door and Richard with the help of Hunter and the Marquis de Carabas, attempt to find the Angel Islington, who knows the secret behind the murder of Door's family, and possibly a way for Richard to go home.

The visual look of the series has come in for some criticism. Although originally shot for film, the idea was abandoned for budget reasons. To some people, the series now looks old-fashioned, and perhaps unprofessional. Garish and unsubtle. Neil Gaiman however thought the loss of quality actually improved the appearance of London Below.
