,Bouncewitit,2011-09-15T19:08Z,"Hi All!

First off, Thank you for the upload.

However, is there something I am missing? I have windows 7 (legit copy) and I've tried both cracks. used the Platinum download.  I've even tried setting the compatability of the game to Win xp and vista... I get an window saying it has stopped working... any ideas?"
,CarlesNeo,2011-09-18T06:20Z,"@Bouncewitit - Can you tell your hardware (ram,proccesoor,graphic card,etc).
That may help !"
