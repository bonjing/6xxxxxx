I have downloaded the movie and coverted to 1GB .avi file format, how do I share it?"

It's really easy if you just do it step by step, don't worry. Soon you'll be an uploader, and it feels good.. ;-)

But first you may want to use AVI-Recomp to make the movie even smaller. 700 MB is good enough for most 90 min. movies, no loss in quality to speak of, and it would greatly save time and bandwidth if you do it.
You can download the free, easy to use program here:

www.avirecomp.com/e107_files/downloads/AVI_ReComp_1.5.3_Setup.exe

Next you'd want to follow a step by step like this:

http://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Torrent

The link to the trackers that's in this tutorial doesn't work atm, but here are some 'open trackers' that work for the time being. [These are NOT links. You'd want to copy and paste these into the 'trackers' field when you make the .torrent-file you later will be uploading to TPB]

http://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce

http://tracker.publicbt.com/announce

http://tracker.prq.to/announce

udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80

udp://tracker.ccc.de:80

udp://tracker.publicbt.com:80

You need to leave a empty line between each tracker, and no line after the last one.

A relevant description and picture etc for the upload is great to have too, and IndianChristian have already provided a description, so you don't have to worry about that..

Hope that was helpful, and I [and who knows how many others?] look forward to seeing the finished result..

If there's anything you wonder about; you can mail me at:

[No, I'm not hijacking you, IndianC. I just want to take some of the pressure off you, my friend.. ;D ]

You'll find them here:
