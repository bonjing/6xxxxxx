,wetmouse,2011-07-24T02:36Z,A Sarah Palin fan. Shocked? I think not. The Gabrielle Giffords shooter was also a Palin fan.

Please get informed before you spout of. 
Jared Lee Loughner was not a Sarah Palin fan at all. 
He held a grudge against the U.S. government and had no leaning to either right or left but  had become obsessed with Giffords, the local embodiment of that government he so despised. "
