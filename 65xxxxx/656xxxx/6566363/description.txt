Infinite Self-Esteem and Confidence

Save the files on your iPod and use earphones when you listen to them.

Listen to the files in the folder \"Power Pack\" before you sleep everyday for 30 days or a few months.  
It is perfectly fine if you fall asleep while listening to them.
That\'s the idea, listening to them while you sleep saves you a lot of time.

This will forever change your life.  I promise!!!  

Please seed if you are interested in changing your life 
and the lives of others in this world.  

Peace
