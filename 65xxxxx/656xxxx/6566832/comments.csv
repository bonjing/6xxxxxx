,zimbazumba,2011-07-29T17:46Z,"Finnish subtitles are mostly swedish and rest of them are translated by google. Here's example:

""Englannissa vihaaja vuoden 1215 koskeneet
Audiovisuaalinen King John 16 vuotta.
Kuten julma audiovisuaalisen Englanti
Kings"""

Video itself was good though.

Next time, wait for retails Darklord2011."
