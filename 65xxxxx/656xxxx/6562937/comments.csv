,DalittleBIGmen,2011-08-09T23:58Z,"Thanks LawnMowerKing!

I installed flawlessly. Game it's pretty addictive. I have it im my mac. I have a Xoom and it looks not horrible but pretty bad though. 

I will write the developers and ask for a hd version.

,kbowk2,2011-09-17T09:18Z,"THIS APP/TORRENT WORKS GREAT on my Acer Tablet.  I just followed the easy instructions from the comments on another torrent.  

1) Download ES file Explorer from market

2) Go to settings/applications and check unknown sources

3) use ES to find apk file and install.

4) Yay"

What do I do wrong?"
