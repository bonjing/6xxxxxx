Description
In the Plants .VS. Zombies, you will get 200 sun points at the beginning.
Then later you will need to collect the sun points to plant more plants. Sunflower will give you extra sun points.
To collect sun points just touch the sun then it will fly to the left-top side and get 25 sun points for each sun.
How to plant a Plant? If there is enough sun points(the plant NOT show as grey),
then JUST touch the plant & hold it & slide your finger to the grid you wanna plant,
then release your finger, you will see the plant show in the grid you move to.
(one grid will allow to plant one Plant only.)
To remove a plants from a grid just do the samething, touch the Shovel instead of the plants.
