,vaikou15,2011-07-29T18:11Z,"picture and audio quality is very good, but for me the picture occasionally slows downa bit, im not sure if its the file or something in my configuration but this is the only file i have ever seen it happen. But the hardcoded subs are fuckin awful...whoever made them had zero understanding of the english language...its basically a word for word translation using google translate...90% of it makes no sense - and since you cant get rid of em, id suggest gettin another copy"

,Mr.Fox15,2011-08-07T13:41Z,"@wuaboi183 Go to the cinema if you don't like this torrent. All of you, go to the fucking cinema if you keep on talking shit about other's work, jesus. You take everything for granted. They even went through the trouble to put my language as subtitles, not that I need them but that's not the point. 
Listen you fat prick, if you can't afford cinema tickets be happy with what you're getting."

,vartego,2011-08-10T18:07Z,"heavydiamond , splitz_z , guys

Here is what is making me (and other people) angry:

1) This section is called ""Video > Movies DVDR"",  and not ""TS2DVD"" or ""whatever-DVD"". 
A DVD rip is expected to live up to a certain quality being ripped from a DVD and not being TS/CAM hiding fake ""DVD"" rips

2) NLUPPER002 had put a headline saying:
""Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) V2 720p2DVD NL Subs DMT""
Notice that the ""TS"" that appears in the ""fine small print"" turned to be ""V2"" in the headlines!!.

What is the reason that keeps some uploader posting in the WRONG section and faking headlines is beyond my comprehension.

it only makes people antagonize the uploader instead of thanking him!

And finally, thanks for the time and effort NLUPPER002 , but to be honest i rather not download this but watch it in the cinema."

,melvinhoek,2011-08-14T12:46Z,dank je wel
,djsp1ke,2011-08-14T14:43Z,"The problem isn't a problem for us who are experienced uploaders/downloaders. The problem for me, is to explain to my mother, grandmother, father and all the other unexperienced friends of mine, who are new to the torrent-world. They have no idea what to download and what to not.
And for them, the whole experience of torrents is ruined if the first movie they download, is posted in the Dvd section, named with a combination of numbers and letters and also have a well known Movie title in it. 
I say make an own section for the TS's and CAM's.
Torrent is about sharing, so dont forget about those who got their computer yesterday. =P"
,michael.no7,2011-08-23T12:11Z,damn whats the fcking problem? So some are mad because they open a link and notice that it's a cam version ? yeah its dissapointing but wtf do you all crie about? :S close the link and wait for a better version. Low life's
