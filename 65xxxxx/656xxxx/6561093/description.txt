**************************************************************************
Block Splitter is a metal band based on the south-east coast of Queensland, Australia; their music is described as \"a brutally artist empowerment and uplift of the human condition\". 

Instead of taking the road most travelled and attempting to create the hardest, baddest and heaviest music known to mankind; Block Splitter have created something truly unique and defining within the genre of metal. 

Block Splitter\\\\\\\'s music encompasses an underlying rock methodology which will get you hooked and keep you moving forward. In general terms the majority of metal music is themed on death and despair; however the lyrical contact for Block Splitter is based on rising up from these kinds of mindsets and boosting ones sense of self-worth, without reliance on external crutches such as religion.
