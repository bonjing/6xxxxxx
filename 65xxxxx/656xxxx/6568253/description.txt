Its moving day for Emily, and with a new place to call home, she is feeling more like a guest than part of the family. Hanna is also feeling uneasy, but for her it is in regard to Calebâ€™s continued shady â€œbusinessâ€ dealings and his nonchalant attitude about it. And when Toby makes a surprising discovery, Spencer is thrown for a loop by the find and her fatherâ€™s reaction to it. With the girls already on edge, could they be sitting targets for â€œAâ€™sâ€ next move? Or does â€œAâ€ have bigger plans for the four and is just making them wait?
