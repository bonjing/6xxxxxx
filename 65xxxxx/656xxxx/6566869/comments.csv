,mr.lyris,2011-07-28T18:56Z,Is this thing being seeded? Would like to try but...nothing being seeded.
,debugman18,2011-07-28T20:06Z,"I thought I had other seeders. Being seeded, should be good."
,mr.lyris,2011-07-29T03:50Z,Thanks...will seed for as long as possible once completed.
,ozzypirate1,2011-08-01T15:31Z,"Hello, is there anyone with 100% of the files seeding? I will seed for a couple of weeks once I have to try and start the ""snowball"" going..."
,ozzypirate1,2011-08-02T14:36Z,"Mr Lyris, how long did you seed for? I was on one day after your response, and there is no seeders with 100% ! Damn, was looking forward to playing this game :("
,debugman18,2011-08-02T16:51Z,"I've been seeding, so it should be downloading for everybody."
,Alcopine,2011-08-08T03:02Z,Thanx a lot for this torrent! But how do I run it? (I'm using Ubuntu 10.04)
,Alcopine,2011-08-08T22:04Z,Problem solved! Just added executable permissions for the game file.
,debugman18,2011-08-11T18:15Z,That's an important step for most downloads lol.
,ozzypirate1,2011-08-13T12:43Z,"Hi, managed to download, but cannot run - do you just set the BRAID executable ""Allow executing file as program"" under file properties, permissions? And then double click? Sorry noob to Linux :!
"
,ozzypirate1,2011-08-18T06:59Z,"HELP Pls!! I am desperate to play, my first Linux game after years of Windud games... :) Thq anyone "
