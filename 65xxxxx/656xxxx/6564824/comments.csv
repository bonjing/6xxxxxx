In the future, hopefully you will have the good sense to create individual torrents for each movie that you wish to share.

Keep in mind that the smaller the size of the torrent, the more people will help you seed it.
And the smaller the block size used when creating the torrent, the quicker the data will replicate between the peers in the torrent swarm."

We can only wish to see, some day, a good copy of The ÂŤRaymond BurrÂť USA Godzilla 1985...I don't think it was ever released on DVD."

Enjoy"
,tdkr86,2011-11-04T22:01Z,"This is spectacular! Great collection, and I love that you put them all in a single torrent. If I can finish the download, I'll be seeding for a while."
,Zoticus,2011-11-22T16:58Z,"With my torrent software (don't know about anyone else's) I can first open the torrent file, UNSELECT all choices, then manually select only the movies I want to download. So huge torrents like this aren't a problem, I just download the movies I want. Try it."
,ButrzV2,2012-01-01T11:02Z,"moar seedz nao!
