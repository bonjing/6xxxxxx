2/ Go To The Crack Folder And Copy And Paste The Cracked File Over To AVS Video Converter Installation Directory , Replacing/Overwriting The Original File.

,ajcopp,2011-08-29T17:45Z,"Works great! Thanks uploader! Make sure you copy ""AVSVideoConverter.exe"" into the installed folder. Overwrite the file when prompted."
,phatpat1975,2011-09-04T21:41Z,Works Great!
,freedomdwarf,2011-09-07T15:53Z,"@sengar_316 -
There's NO crack folder included in this torrent!
The .NFO file says to unzip the crack.zip file which also doesn't exist!

I'm guessing the ""Setup.exe"" does the install and the ""AVSVideoConverter.exe"" is the actual crack file to copy into the installed folder."

Anybody has this problem and is there any fix around????"
,10Base-T,2011-10-06T12:04Z,"Works perfectly- unlike some, it appears I must be a genius to have worked out in five seconds how to use the INCLUDED cracked .exe file. o.O

Thanks for the upload. I only needed this as I downloaded AVS Video Converter from a page claiming it was ""free"" software, only to find this was a misrepresentation. I fucking hate it when they do that shit, so I'm ripping them off for the conversion of one file, then removing it and never touching anything they make again.

They can suck my balls."
,TRocBurnsides,2011-10-10T22:12Z,"People who are saying this isn't cracked, READ THIS

Guys, it seems like it's not cracked, but the entire folder IS the crack folder. 
Take the AVSVideoConverter.exe file from the crack folder, and paste and replace it into the Installation Directory, which is at:

C://ProgramFiles/AVS4YOU/AVSVideoConverter/"

,Malakai456,2011-10-17T03:49Z,"WALKTHROUGH OF THE DOWNLOAD
Ok, I known you may be frustrated cuz you have no idea wtf to do.
1. double click setup and download AVS
2.When in the setup, it should give you the installation directory, it's a long gibberish of something that looks like this:
a.C:/Program Files/AVS4YOU/AVSVideoConverter
b.C:\Program Files (x86)\AVS4YOU\AVSVideoConverter
you want to copy paste that
3.When the download is finished, drag the AVSVideoConverter file into the installation directory, that's the thing I told you to copy paste
4.Replace the original file
5. You're ready to use it"
