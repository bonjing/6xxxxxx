,tattood_downloader,2011-07-25T16:50Z,"V7 A3 VERY WATCHABLE PICTURE BUT I WOULD WAIT FOR A BETTER AUDIO. THANKS FOR THE UPLOAD THOUGH, AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK :)"
,dinosaur58,2011-07-25T19:29Z,"Quite watchable A4/V6.5 [compared to other CAMs in the last 8 months]. Better than Erdna or SD [I Dl'd all 3]. Better color correction. Other versions enlarged, but not better resolution [Same source]. Same Audio [on my machine] for all 3. Audio is camera mic, TS would be better but doesn't exist yet. Thanks to Hero for upload, and Unknown for encode!!"

I think everyone in the audience is sick with all the coughing you hear.  Audio isn't great, but you can hear it.

Movie imitates Ironman too much.   "
,cjolwd,2011-08-05T08:14Z,"Seriously, the coughing is SO annoying.. if i'd been at that movie theatre i would've yelled ""Buy a damn cough drop!"""
