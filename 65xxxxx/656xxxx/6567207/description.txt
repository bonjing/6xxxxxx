========================================TL;DR========================================
* THIS IS NOT FOR Red Alert 2. 

* This IS for Red Alert, the second game in the series from 1996.

* This is compatible with both expansions: Counterstrike, and Aftermath.

* This contains ALL movies/cinematics/FMVs, including those from the console ports.

* You should DELETE your old *.MIXs. Either way the game will work, but otherwise
  this download will be kinda pointless.

|        SONARPULSE'S OPTIMIZED *.MIXs FOR COMMAND & CONQUER: RED ALERT v3.03       |
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------/
Includes files from all 4 disks: Allied, Soviet, Counterstrike, and Aftermath.
________________________________________Intro________________________________________
I have been trying to optimize red alert's mix files on and off for awhile, now, and I finally have a first release. First I combined the differing versions of the *.mixs from the various CDs, not knowing 

that N3tRunn3r had already done that. Eventually I learned about FullRA+, and used it to finish combining the mixes, but there was still more work to be done. But there was more to do. Westwood in their 

various patches of Red Alert rarely actually replaced old files. Instead they just copied over the new versions and had them override the old ones. And it wasn't for backward compatibility either, as files 

such as the string database just added more strings where the old version left off. For neatness'sâ€”and a few saved bytes'â€”sake, I have replaced the old version of files in the *.mixs with their newer 

counterparts, and then deleted the no-longer-need "override *.mixs."

Just unrar the *.mixes to you're red alert directory. Anything not overwritten is propably redundant (unless you installed some other mod). Either way, back up your old *.mixs if you're at all worried, or 

would be pissed if stuff stopped working. This SHOULDn't ever mess anything [but somebody eles's buggy mod] up.
