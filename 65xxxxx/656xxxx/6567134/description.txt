The album is a LTD edition Digipack with 77 minutes of brand new music. Agents Of Mercy is a project spawned from a â€œlow keyâ€ acoustic project that Roine Stolt set out to do in 2008, but after getting singer Nad Sylvan (Unifaun) onboard to do a few â€œguest vocalsâ€ it turned into a full production prog album where Nad got more involved and did most of both lead and backing vocals on the album.

Songs got longer and vocal arrangements more elaborated and more symphonic and the common love of late 60â€™s and early 70â€™s prog and artrock is all over this album.
A few favourite drummers tracked drums for the 12 tracks, Pat Mastelotto (King Crimson, XTC, Mr Mister, KTU, Stickmen etc.) Zoltan CsÃ¶rsz (TFK, Karmakanic) and Jimmy Keegan (Santana, Spocks Beard Live) the eccentric Biggo Zelfries did most of the piano, violin and analogue keyboards and TFK bassist Jonas Reingold added some fretless bass spice too.
A cluster of artful influences ranges from The Beatles, Queen, ELO, (early)
Genesis, Supertramp, CSN&Y, Klaatu, The Move, Pink Floyd, XTC, Claude Debussy, (early) Bowie.
