The Stanier Jubilee steam locomotive, famously named in 1935 to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of King George V, was one of the first fully fledged standardised locomotive fleets for LMS designed by William Stanier. Becoming the main stay of passenger traffic operating out of London Euston and surviving the war (barely) the Jubilees were granted one last reprive by appearing in BR Green before their final curtain call. Bought back to life in RailWorks, this famous Class can once again ride the rails.
