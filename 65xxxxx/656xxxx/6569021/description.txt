'Breivik manifesto' details chilling attack preparation

A 1,500-page "manifesto" recently published online, entitled 2083: A European Declaration of Independence, has been attributed to Anders Behring Breivik, who has admitted being behind Friday's bloody twin attacks in Norway.

Part of the tract details the author's "personal reflections and experiences during several preparation phases", apparently in the run-up to the 22 July attacks.

Over dozens of pages, the author chillingly and meticulously details his efforts to create cover stories for his plot, to build up his personal fitness levels, and to acquire the weaponry and explosives materials needed.
