,ClassZero,2011-07-25T03:25Z,"reichert, Hey stoopid when is Skype a game?"
[T],nobody2007,2011-07-25T07:26Z,"This one is freeware!, and its also wrong section."
,jonah_the_bear,2011-07-25T11:54Z,"this sickens me deeply considering skype is already free, available for macs, and is not a game you sir are either stupid or a troll"
,miknos,2011-07-30T17:48Z,I highly recommend NOT to download. It's a FREE app and you can download from a reliable source (Skype.com)
,neha00,2011-08-05T17:51Z,"Well, Skype.com is blocked in some countries so users cannot download the client from there.

Thanks, reichert, for this torrent."
,ClassZero,2011-08-07T14:06Z,"neha00 bullshit. No country blocks access to free services or free software. How fast was your download from the torrent? There's no seeder you dumb fuck and there has been no seeder from the day this suspicious torrent was posted 2 weeks ago!

This torrent isn't even the newest version and the newest right now was 5.2.0.1572 - http://www.macupdate.com/download/15805/Skype_5.2.0.1572.dmg"
[T],nobody2007,2011-08-20T05:51Z,The newest version is from 08/08/2011 - http://www.macupdate.com/download/15805/Skype_5.3.0.1074.dmg
