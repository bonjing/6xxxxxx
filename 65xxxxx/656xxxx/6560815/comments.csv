That alone is the Inconvenient Truth...  there will be no change in the way we use this Planet and it's resources.. Sadly we are too late to save Mankind...  the Planet will be fine and better off without us..  we had a good run but sadly we the People are too greedy and will never learn to appreciate what we have here...  I do hope that I am wrong..."

Please don't waste our time with such nonsense anymore.  It will be 'too late' for humanity when we all succumb to whining, giving up, cowardice and hopelessness like you.  I'm still here."

IT IS TIME WE ""KNEW,"" AS UNMISTAKABLY EVIDENCED BY OUR 'FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION' BEHAVIOR."
