Since Microsoft released Windows XP SP2, there have been more than 120 hotfixes and updates. Slipstream your copy of Windows XP Professional with SP3, integrate the latest updates, and then burn the image to a proper bootable CD.  What about adding all the subsequent hotfixes/updates Microsoft has released since Service Pack 2 for Windows XP was released in 2004 (August 2004, to be exact)?  Downloading and installing every one of them is no fun; doing it every time for every new Windows installation is plain crazy. Even so, you can\'t really take a chance on ignoring the updates. Venturing onto the Internet without the protection of the latest updates and patches is downright dangerous. Tests have shown that Windows vulnerabilities can be exploited within minutes after exposing such a system on the Net. So wouldn\'t it be great if you could integrate all (or at least most) of those Microsoft updates right into a copy of XP, together with the latest service pack? Well, you can, and it\'s a relatively simple process.  To top it all, you can even add some useful utilities like the newest Windows Media player to your customized version of Windows and make the disk bootable.
