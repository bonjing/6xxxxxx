,xxscreechproxx,2011-07-24T02:41Z,Thanks for another great upload! Fast Five would be greatly appreciated as well HR.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-07-24T05:57Z,"a good drama, warning you may feel ""moved"" after watching :)"
,Nuttster,2011-07-24T06:34Z,Will you be posting handheld versions of your recent uploads? Thanks!
,Nuttster,2011-07-24T07:07Z,"Never mind, just saw your comment on Source Code about uploading them. : )"
,RoyalBay,2011-07-25T02:28Z,"Hi Holy, I was wondering, when you get your Bluerays do you get them with Multi-Audio languages, I wouldn't mind if you added the french or spanish like you did with The.Rite.DVDRIP.MP4.x264.480p-HR (MULTI 3) 

Thanks in advance if you chose to do so. It's amazing to change languages on the Apple TV :)"
,lakuli,2011-07-25T06:34Z,"HR ... can u please do a HANDHELD version?? Would also appreciate LIMITLESS, FA5T FIVE, and PIRATES of the CARIBBEAN FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH"
[T],The_Day_Walker,2011-07-25T18:06Z,"Hey HR! I don't mean to spam on your torrent, i just wanted to let everyone know that i'm back, haha. my first torrent back is X-Men First Class (R5). I've missed everything and everyone. I love my fans and this community! Did y'all miss me? "
,jlet,2011-07-25T22:26Z,Hey HolyRoses...I really like your files but when I try to put subtitles manually in an app called iSubtitle once I try to view them on apple tv they don't work...and this only happens to your files..because I try other MP4 sand M4v and they work perfectly...what software do you use for adding you subs?? Cause Ive notice some of your movies like RIO have multiple subtitles...thanks
,albert2172,2011-07-26T06:12Z,"@jlet

use Subler!!!!

http://subler.googlecode.com/files/Subler-0.14.zip

Its free and waybetter than i Subtitile!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thats the one that HR uses.
:O"
,jlet,2011-07-26T07:44Z,Albert2172 THANK YOU SO MUCH..Subler is awesome!
,ajretro,2011-07-26T10:09Z,"Hi HR, I was wondering if you could upload these in iPod/iPhone formats for us. Thanks you're the greatest!!!"
,albert2172,2011-07-26T22:49Z,"@jlet

No problem. n_n"
,albert2172,2011-07-27T07:39Z,"HR hopefully you  upload your new version of encode-handheld  or a Mac Pack :) 
Please. "
,t.cody,2011-07-27T10:30Z,"when you come back can you please do Captian America
You Rock!!!!!!!
I Download"
,tyardley,2011-07-28T17:18Z,"Hi HolyRoses. I just wanted to say thanks so much for all your great torrents! I hate to bother you, but I was wondering if you had stopped doing the handheld formats. I watch movies on my psp while I work at night and having new interesting things to watch helps me stay awake and get stuff done. 

If you don't have the time, or whatever, I understand completely. Thanks again for all your efforts to share with us."
,sooogood,2011-07-28T17:50Z,"HR - I have a quick question.. Is there a way to convert the stash of .mkv's I have so they will work on my Xbox?  Your converter link (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5231719/holyroses_ps3_apple_tv_aac5.1_converter_encoder_v1.6) has no seeders, and hasn't had any for a long time.

Thanks!"
,12uel,2011-07-29T01:54Z,Can you please upload 'Hanna'? Your uploads for PS3 are awesome!!! Thanks...
,Roy.5432,2011-07-29T02:29Z,"Hey HR! I love your uploads, just wondering if you're gonna get around uplding these files compressed ""(psp, ipod, zune)"" style?? 

Thanks a lot!! Big Fan! :D"
,albert2172,2011-07-29T03:41Z,"@sooogood

That is just an audio encoder.
Its used to get 5.1 audio and then you have to mux it to your encode. If you would like to get the link for the tools that help you encode.

You can download them with this link

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5212197/encode-handheld.pl_v5.2_with_binaries_for_Linux_and_Mac_OS_X

Updated Script : http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6261444/encode-handheld-5.6

This only works on linux or mac. 

As HR ""This is not useful to 99% of humans.  Having said that if you are one of them 1% then have fun."""
,Nuttster,2011-07-29T15:56Z,"@sooogood If you use Handbrake on the regular setting, put the file on a flashdrive, then you can play it on your XBox."
,BobsNephew,2011-07-29T22:47Z,"First, I'd like to thank you for the amazing collection of HQ downloads you've provided. Second, would you mind sharing which software you use to convert blue ray to .m4v?

keep up the great work."
,Knightime,2011-07-30T14:32Z,"HR, thanks for the great stuff, but when I try to reduce the size of these files for viewing on my iPhone, I lose some of the nice touches you have embedded.  Any chance you could release new titles in HD and iPadpodphone sizes?  Thanks."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-07-31T01:01Z,"Hello, just an update, this is currently on back burner for me.  Its that I don't like doing it, or don't like you all.  I am just re-prioritizing life at the moment.

Cheers,

-HR"
,ItsNotPro,2011-07-31T17:55Z,Thanks for the upload. I put all my movies on my 1TB HD and plug it into my 360. It's a nice idea if you don't like watching you movies in your PC all the time. Thanks
,ItsNotPro,2011-07-31T17:58Z,"P.S. You should think about uploading old movies. Like classics ex. Shawshank Redemption or Forrest Gump. I like to watch good old movies sometimes, and I'm sure others do to. Please take note of that when you are back uploading again. Much appreciated.

-Mike"
,Micebiker,2011-08-02T01:48Z,damm i need a seeder for encode 5.2 can someone help me?
,albert2172,2011-08-02T17:47Z,"@Micebiker

Do you have a Linux or Mac PC?? if you do I can let a hand and share the program."
,sooogood,2011-08-03T06:07Z,"@albert2172 and @Nuttstur:

Thanks so much for the help.. I'm looking into HR's tools, and using handbrake at the moment.

To anyone else that is familiar with the way HR does work: what's used for metadata? I've tried subler and metaX, and neither's metadata show up on my Xbox when I am trying to play them.

It's not necessary, but I'd appreciate any tips anyone could give me.

-Thanks"

If you need help with the tools that HR uses I would be glad to help. I know the tools he uses and can even guide you the right direction if you need assistance. 

I need to know some specs about your PC first of.

What is the Processor that you have?
What is the OS that is installed?
What is the total capacity available?

Its not that hard to install everything that is needed you can even do it on basic computers. 

I had everything installed just as HR but I sure didn't have time with school. ;) 

If you need help just reply."
