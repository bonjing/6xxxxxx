,Hexes2011,2011-08-27T11:38Z,@MikesUploadz-Im afraid you cant play this file on your Xbox because it is a mp4  file

,FreshmensRage,2011-10-19T20:30Z,"does anyone know, why there never are german subtitles in multisub movies?"
,b_b0t,2011-10-21T00:52Z,Can all your rips be added to iTunes and watched via Apple TV? Thank you for your work :)
,Sjurk,2011-10-30T20:34Z,@FreshmensRage - because Germans synchronize (dubbed) everey movie. It sounds terrible btw.
,Wave_rider,2011-12-04T22:20Z,"I agree about the German thing. Am a Californian living in Switzerland and like watching movies in English, with german Subs, so I can see the translations. 
Agree the German's dubbing sux. Grandparents are always watching the dubbed German flicks.

,FreshmensRage,2011-12-15T18:42Z,"so does anyone know, where to find german subtitles that fit? cause there are, but they just mostly don't fit to the movies...
or another question @PetaFOX:
where did you get these subs which are included?"
,pld849,2011-12-28T16:10Z,"This file is not good. The black level is wrong. Since this is the only file in my collection with this problem, I conclude there is something wrong with the file. Or else something non-standard in the encoding. Avoid."
