,LP___Man,2011-07-29T00:37Z,"I have the new remaster of this cd. This was a decent disc but not great. Had they lasted, I'm sure they might have went somewhere. The producer was the same guy who did the first G n R disc.... Mike Clink.

Worthy tracks are;
Half the Way Valley, Doghouse, Someday, Back to the Grind and All the Time."
