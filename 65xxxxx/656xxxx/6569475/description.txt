Thank you to all the teams, scenes and other uploaders that have brought so much delightful fun into my life.
 
Please help seed when done.

As always, please be patient for the first 3-4 days after I initially upload the torrent. Thank you to all those that have helped seed my other torrents, which allows me to continue uploading new stuff. 

Please, please, unless you have a legitimate point or complaint to make, as in a file actually doesn\'t work for you, keep your noises to yourself unless its a thank you.
