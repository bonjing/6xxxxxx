From Daniel H. Pink, the author of the bestselling A Whole New Mind, comes a paradigm-shattering look at what truly motivates us and how we can use that knowledge to work smarter and live better.

Most of us believe that the best way to motivate ourselves and others is with external rewards like moneyâ€”the carrot-and-stick approach. Thatâ€™s a mistake, Daniel H. Pink says in, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, his provocative and persuasive new book. The secret to high performance and satisfactionâ€”at work, at school, and at homeâ€”is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world.

Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business doesâ€”and how that affects every aspect of life. He demonstrates that while carrots and sticks worked successfully in the twentieth century, thatâ€™s precisely the wrong way to motivate people for todayâ€™s challenges. In Drive, he examines the three elements of true motivationâ€”autonomy, mastery, and purposeâ€”and offers smart and surprising techniques for putting these into action. Along the way, he takes us to companies that are enlisting new approaches to motivation and introduces us to the scientists and entrepreneurs who are pointing a bold way forward.

Drive is bursting with big ideasâ€”the rare book that will change how you think and transform how you live.
