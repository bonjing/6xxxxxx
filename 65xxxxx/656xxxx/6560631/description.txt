Here is an audio rip from a VHS that I had many years ago. You can hear a few drop outs on the fidelity but those are defects from the VHS. For the most part its a pristine rip. This was one of my first rips I did years ago and was surprised that I didn't overboost the wave format. It was left it a little low on the DB so it wouldn't get that "digital compression" feel. Loved the drumming. Art was just one of very few pics of the VHS cover on the net.

If your a drumming fan - I think You'll enjoy
