,Weedman87,2011-07-29T19:23Z,@rk111600 do not try to doubleklick the key file and insert them. install it over the licensemanagement and they should work :) These keys are fresh and created by myself... i hope they get not blacklisted for the 92 days. If the keys dont work let me know and i will upload new ones
