,N1190,2011-07-31T03:48Z,"@Legend.Cyrus
Have you tried starting the install again? I have had that problem and just restarting the installation process fixed the problem for me. 

@dheerajjhaliwar
This does work. I installed it myself just over an hour ago with no problems whatsoever. 

@caliope76
Generally when you crack a game like The Sims 3, you do not start the game from the launcher to prevent the game from automatically updating thus removing the crack that allows you to play without a disc. I recommend always starting from the executable(.exe file) you replace when installing the crack, both for this and for other games you might play in the future. "

,N1190,2011-07-31T19:17Z,"@XTanja13
You need to replace the .exe file with the cracked file located on the disc."

Thanks for the advice :D  The only thing is I have tried restarting the installation but every time I get that same error, ""Update of Sims3 failed, Setup is unable to continue"".

,jbob75,2011-07-31T20:54Z,"@Legend.Cyrus
Question. When you got this error: ""Update of Sims3 failed, Setup is unable to continue"", were you already using the cracked files, or did you put back the original (un-cracked) ones?

As far as I know, updates or patches for sims 3 will not work if the installed game contains cracked content."
,caliope76,2011-08-01T05:31Z,"@N1190

Thanks, I know that, it's just that all my expansions have worked perfect from the launcher with the crack (all are reloaded, the base game is vitality i think, and that one had this problem). It is very useful since i have the habit of installing always one or two things with the launcher and then I play. Automatic updates can be disabled from the launcher, so it doesn't give me any trouble. But this launcher thing doesn't matter as long as the game works fine, and it does, really, i played for hours. Thanks to the author for the upload, i believe i didn't say it before."

,Legend.Cyrus,2011-08-01T21:15Z,"Ok, I placed the non cracked sims3 in the base file. And thankfully it let me install Generations and TownLife.

,N1190,2011-08-01T21:42Z,"@Legend.Cyrus
The ""Your disc is not a valid copy, please contact support"" results from attempting to play the game without cracking it first. 

I recommend going to GameCopyWorld (google it) and getting the Town Life Stuff fixed image. It allows you to play without replacing files which means you can always update to the latest patch and play without issues. All you need to do is mount it and you can play."
,Legend.Cyrus,2011-08-02T02:11Z,"@N1190 & @jbob75

That's why I use PeerBlock. It's a program that has lists of known Anti-P2P IP's and blocks them when enabled.

Along with Anti-P2P IP's it also can block malicious spyware, adware, advertising, data trackers, education institutions and university IP's. All the lists are of course optional and IP's can be manually added to an 'Allow' list.

At first I was only going to use it when downloading things I shouldn't be but after seeing how many things try and connect while just browsing the web I've started using it almost permanently!

Essentially what I did was install the base game, NOT crack it, let it update through the Sims 3 launcher, then install and update any expansion in the same fashion. When I was done, THEN I cracked the game- but not by using the ones that came with any of the expansions. Instead I found a crack that matched the BASE GAME's updated version number (at this point something like 1.24.3) and placed it in the BASE GAME's game\bin folder.

If you have a copy of the legit base game (or a copy of its legit exe) and just one single crack for the updated version of the base game, it's all you need."

I had the same problem as you but it turned out I didn't need to copy either of the afforementioned files, presumably because my version of the sims was already updated with the latest update patches.

I DL this torrent...installed correctly...then came across a form to enter to register my game. Am I doing something wrong? Is there a way around this?.....I'm pretty sure Im out of luck but if not, anybody let me know. Thanks."
,SmauG69,2012-01-03T20:41Z,"Worked fine for me when I did what Sjosjie posted by installing in this order:

Base Game
World Adventures
High End Loft
Ambitions
Fast Lane
Late Night
Outdoor Living
Generations
Town Life *
Pets

I declined downloading the EA Download Manager, and Orgin since I was prompted to update Sims 3 before it will continue with each expansion installation. Once I completed that I went to the ""Crack nieuw"" folder and used its content to successfully crack and run Sims 3. The only hang up I encountered was with the Town Life which was an easy fix by going here:

Thanks uploader for all this good shit! It was a pain in the ass but I took a chill pill and did it in small manageable steps. I vowed if I got this fucking thing to work I would seed and share this to spare anyone's misery if I could. :) Peace"

,xniccix,2012-04-28T09:10Z,"Just wanted to let everyone know that if you're having troubles with this or any other expansion giving you error screens (specifically service initiation) use this url:: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t752-the-sims-3-ultimate-fix-should-fix-most-of-your-problems?highlight=ultimate+fix

,James954,2012-04-29T13:13Z,"go to http://www.gamecopyworld.com/ and download the sims toen life no dvd crack that website is really good i use it all the time.

install that etc. then you can play with no disc!"
,itsLey,2012-05-02T16:07Z,"Got the torrent, the file only held the ISO file and when I mounted there is no crack file to be found anywhere..uh help? The expansion is downloaded but I can't replace the .exe file because I have no crack file.."
,mrpwc,2012-05-22T12:51Z,@Aker88 Have you copied the crack into the origin game folder? and then open using the crack application? that worked for me!
,aeristilheartly,2012-05-22T21:49Z,"ALRIGHT listen up here people who are having problems, this is what you do!!!!

Make sure you have DAEMON TOOLS!
This is what you mount to, you can download Daemon Tools Lite for FREE at the download website.


Unrar/unzip everything and mount into your daemon tools when instructed.
Some DO NOT NEED DAEMON TOOLS!  In this case, just open the SETUP application and run it.


Install in THIS order.


!!!!!!!DO NOT CRACK ANYTHING!!!!!!!!

THIS IS KEY! 

If you crack ANYTHING during your installs you will make it so NONE of them work and you might even have problems REMOVING them as they won't even UNINSTALL correctly


UPDATE WHEN ASKED
it won't hurt and you cannot move on unless you allow the update in EACH install!
