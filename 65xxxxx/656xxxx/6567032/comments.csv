,TheForces,2012-01-22T23:13Z,"Because Macs are Over priced to get a decent one you need 2000 $ those $1000 are crap their hardware is terrible, holy! With $1000 you get a 16GB Ram Core i7 Quad Core PC! with Apple you get a stupid dual core 1.6 GHz 1GB Ram. LOL! Apple is too over priced"
,MOOKandBEE,2012-02-25T03:01Z,"There's more to product ownership than just specs.  There's reliability, post-sales support, build quality, downtime, etc.

Go get yourself some kids, a wife, a mortgage, a career, and then review if their hardware is too expensive.  The fact it just works means I can go change diapers."
