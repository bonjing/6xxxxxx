,komod,2011-07-28T15:44Z,@maced2 why not?
,pryingeyes,2011-07-28T16:55Z,"Why not? Because VLC is a free, open-source project that I was able to download in under 15 seconds from its creators, whereas your torrent, which you're not seeding, just sits here clogging up space on a board that is not intended for freeware. 

If that wasn't clear, I can type more slowly for you."

,macreli,2011-07-28T19:52Z,"oh, i see, all open source apps should be made available by torrent on the piratebay while the creators of open source apps offer it on their own websites for free. Very useful to upload this torrent. thx...."
,c31m,2011-07-28T21:08Z,"freeware in torrent sites is not bad at all (do you remember when first torrentsites  came? what for that was :)  .. )
there is many reasons why. 
sometimes when you are in very bad network area or why not at ""dial up"" :D 
when you lose your connection you must start over again with DL (i know windows users have DL managers and s.o...) 
and the main thing is.. this is free will! DL or UL :)  You do not have to!"
,pryingeyes,2011-07-28T22:14Z,"I offered to type my previous reply more slowly, so you could understand. Go read it again. And then read your last moronic comment. And then...please stop polluting this database with unnecessary, superfluous files."
,c31m,2011-07-28T22:50Z,Do you even know what is a torrent? and how its works? what database you're talking about you little clown
,pryingeyes,2011-07-29T01:34Z,"The database, my foolish little friend, of torrent files such as the useless one you uploaded. If we could get rid of idiots who upload unnecessary files to this site, the navigation of the site and the ability to see, at a glance, those files of value that have been recently uploaded, would be greatly increased.

But instead, we have people like you polluting the database. There, I used the phrase again. Sit down, try very hard to engage your brain, and see if you can figure out what I'm talking about.

No, I didn't think so.

Now go away. Preferably permanently."
,pryingeyes,2011-07-29T01:44Z,"By your theory, anything at al, regardless of how easily and universally it can be accessed, is fair game to be uploaded here. Therefore, I think I'll create a torrent whose sole content is the url to thepiratebay.org. Surely you would see the huge value in that, since anything and everything that can possibly be uploaded here should be, right? And I'm sure, when you do a search for the newest torrents in a given category (well, assuming you know how to do that, which is probably a stretch), you won't mind a bit that the list you're looking through is polluted (ooh, there's that word again) by my torrent for the url to this site, and maybe another one to tell people that the url to google is google.com, and maybe another one explaining what a web browser is. What/s that? You say that files like that would be unnecessary here? Hey, you're finally beginning to catch on!!!"
,capoeira4u,2011-07-29T01:57Z,It's here for people who pirate software so much that they've forgotten what a legit software is or where to download them.
,komod,2011-07-29T14:27Z,"So according to some ""experts"", torrents are ONLY for illegal and pirated software and NOT for legal, open and free software. And if you upload LEGAL torrents you are clogging up the internets.

Pause for reflection.

And now laugh."
,poon!!,2011-07-29T17:20Z,"There's nothing wrong with uploading non pirated software, you can find much free software here at pirate bay, such as all different Linux versions. 
So stop writing that kind of smartass comments, Pryingeyes. If you don't like it, don't download it."
,pryingeyes,2011-07-29T17:52Z,"My comments speak for themselves, and anyone with a thought in their heads knows I'm right. Apparently that excludes the others, in the distinct minority, who are posting here.

At no point did I say, by the way, that torrents were only for pirated software. But neither are they for ubiquitous, open-source material that is more easily downloaded elsewhere. The proper thing to do, if you really feel the need to advise the world of an update to a program like VLC, is to do what I did: post the link.

And by the way, oh brilliant poster -- if you know what you're doing here, why didn't you state which version of VLC this is, and explain to those who might not know, just what VLC does? Saying it's version 1.1.11 doesn't cut it. There are four distinct versions of 1.1.11. Posting only one here and not distinguishing which you've uploaded is a complete disservice to other users. That's why I posted the link, allowing the user, in one click, to choose which of the four is right for his system, instead of being forced to download your ""mystery version.""

You're obviously not very good at this."
,BuzzMe,2011-07-30T00:07Z,"I think that posting a torrent for freely available software does have value, in that it alerts us that there is a new version available.  Posting a link to Pirate Bay in a Mac applications group would indeed be ""pollution"", as it's not a Mac application.  Posting a Mac application, whether it's freely available or not, is not ""pollution"", as it is on-topic for the group.  Maybe there are people that feel better when they give back, instead of just taking all the time, even when that software is freely given at the original source.

I, for one, have limited time to check for program updates.  I check just three torrent sites. I don't have time to sort through ""updates"" news sites, as most of that is stuff I can't freely grab, and thus to me is ""pollution."" I agree that it would have been better if the OP had included a link to the source site.  But I wouldn't have known this update was available if I hadn't seen it here."
,ClassZero,2011-07-30T17:19Z,"Jesus it's like some of you fucktards never heard of MacUpdate.

Before any of you morons debating the merits of freeware on TPB had even finished typing I had downloaded VLC."
,BuzzMe,2011-07-31T12:23Z,"Oh, I have heard of macupdates, I assure you. But they spit out so much -- to me -- useless information that it's like what pryingeyes calls ""pollution"".  Out of 120 entries, covering *two* days, there is *one* item I'm interested in -- but wait -- it's not available on the torrent sites. Darn.

So yeah, even if an item is available elsewhere for free, I like seeing it posted here, as the signal to noise ratio is much better here."
,insane_m,2011-08-07T12:47Z,"Thank you SO MUCH for the upload!! I've been trying to download the update from VLC's website but could never get past 9.5 MB!

You're the best!"
