Recorded at London's O2 Arena in April 2011, Aphrodite Les Folies is a spectacle to behold.
Featuring performances of tracks from the star's latest album, Aphrodite, including Get Outta
My Way, Closer and Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love), as well as classic anthems such
as Canâ€™t Get You Out Of My Head, On a Night Like This and Better The Devil You Know, this
live concert sees Minogue at her best.

Created by Kylie and long-time creative collaborator William Baker, the show is inspired by
Greek mythology, and features a troupe of sexy dancers, costumes by Dolce & Gabbana and
the most technically advanced and complex stage ever created for an arena.

From Kylie perched on the back of a Pegasus, riding a chariot pulled by saucy centurions and
soaring over the crowd on a bear-chested angel, Aphrodite Les Folies is a feast for the eyes
from start to a very-wet finish. In a spectacular All The Lovers finale, high-wire acrobatics
combine with water elements, designed by the engineering team behind the Bellagio's
famous fountain show in Las Vegas and the World of Colour show at Disneyland, California,
to create an unforgettable climax to an unmissable treat for Kylie fans and pop-lovers alike.

Aphrodite Les Folies has taken Kylie across Europe to the UK, Asia, the Far East, North
America, Mexico and South Africa, before she takes the tour home to Australia this summer.
The Telegraph said: "Any misgivings of Kylie's recent work wilted in the furnace-blast
theatricality of this show." While in the US, Perez Hilton said: "Kylie will make your life
better...The Aphrodite show is non-stop brilliance from beginning to end. The production
value is through the roof. The pacing is on-point."
