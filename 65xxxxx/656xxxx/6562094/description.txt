ReleaseNotes:

The track list from this set is a little different from the original list. Some of the tracks were dropped and replaced by other tracks that more accurately represent Boston's history. The tracks added to this set are "I Had A Good Time" form Boston's last album "Corporate America" and this song is by far the only real classic Boston track from that album and is a very welcome addition. The other added track is from the "Walk On" album, "I Need Your Love". Though it doesn't feature Boston's long time lead vocalist, Brad Delp, it has a classic Boston sound and really keeps this set rockin'. Another change is none of the songs bleed
into each other. On the original version "Don't Look Back" faded into "Cool The Engines". Now both of these tracks stand on their own.

We rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.
HHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)
