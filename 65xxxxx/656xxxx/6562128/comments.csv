,lonefunman,2011-07-24T20:49Z,"did i say smaller.. geez. its actually almost 2x the size, but a better image, if it's worth the bandwidth.."
,brutal_product,2011-07-26T05:18Z,"IMHO avi is a much more popular format and plays on more home standalone dvd players (the couch is more comfortable than a desk chair, as well). and unless someone is cataloging all the episodes for repeated viewing a slight loss in picture quality is an acceptable loss vs. size, compatibility, bandwidth and something you're really only going to watch once. I mean really, who generally watches the entire episode more than once other than some memorable clips on you tube? Awesome show tho and thanks for the up!
