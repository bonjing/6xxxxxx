                             Release Info                              
                                             
                                                                             
    15-year-old Tracey Berkowitz is naked under a tattered shower curtain    
    at the back of a bus, looking for her little brother Sonny, who thinks   
    he's a dog.                                                              
                                                                             
    Tracey's journey leads us into the dark underbelly of the city, into     
    the emotional cesspool of her home, through the brutality of her high    
    school, the clinical cat and mouse games with her shrink and her         
    soaring fantasies of Billy Zero - her boyfriend and Rock 'n' Roll        
    saviour. Her travels also put her in contact with the seedier            
    inhabitants of the city. Like Lance, her would-be saviour who            
    ultimately puts her life in jeopardy.                                    
                                                                             
    Tracey's stories begin to intertwine truth with lies, and hope with      
    despair as we move closer to the truth of Sonny's disappearance.         
                                                                             
    The Tracey Fragments stars Ellen Page in the title role and will         
    have a limited theatrical release in the United States May 9th, 2008.

    The.Tracey.Fragments.2007.DVDRip.XviD-AsiSter is full of blended         
    fields. Check for example frames 14, 17, 25, 29, 37, 41, 49, 62 and      
    67 in the sample we have cut from their release.                         
                                                                             
    Also a note about the audio in their release. GSpot reports that the     
    audio is "Two Mono Channels". This does not mean that their release      
    has mono audio but it is not the optimal mode to use. What it means      
    is that it has two channels that have been encoded independently.        
    The more common "Joint Stereo" is better because it allows the encoder   
    to take advantage of the similarities between the left and right         
    channels. This means that it can give you the same quality at a lower    
    bitrate.                                                                 
                                                                             
    This proper is from the region 2 PAL DVD. The DVD suffers from a lot     
    of blended fields. Removing these left us with 23.976 fps.               
                                                                             
    The sample dir contains, in addition to the sample from our encode,      
    a sample cut from AsiSter's encode and a vob sample.                     
                                                                             
    Enjoy!
