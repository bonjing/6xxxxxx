I have reuploaded this since you all had problems. I have had time to convert all of the .swf files to .avi to make it easy for you. Enjoy and comment please.


Hey guys, this is my first torrent after lurking around here for a few years (no, I'm not lazy, I just had nothing that wasn't already on here!). What I have is the FULL HectorTrader Forex Course. It was almost impossible to find but I eventually did and now I am sharing to you, who have so kindly shared with me before.


The Chapter list is as follows:
1. Analyzing the trend
2. Pattern Breakouts
3. Swing Trades
4. Stop Loss and Targets
5. Blending the News
6. Trade Management
7. London Open Breakout
8. The Golden Rules
9. Custom Indicators


I have used several other courses and none can really compare to this. It has some great strategies and can be a great help to your trading. This is the URL for the website http://www.hectortrader.com/courseindex.php


Good trading boys and gals, I hope you enjoy. Please comment! Thanks!
