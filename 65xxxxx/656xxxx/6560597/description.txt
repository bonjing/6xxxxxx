This is a guide writen by myself about creating missions in the critically acclaimed WWII Simulator IL-2 Sturmovik 1946 video game by Ubisoft. It covers pretty much everything for creating moving dogfight server missions, with the 409m patch and Zuti mod 1.13 (Ultr@Pack 2.01).

That version is the one used in the Mission Operations Group (MOG) at www.missionoperationsgroup.net

Enjoy!
