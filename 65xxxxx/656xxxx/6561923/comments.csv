,naeem42,2011-07-25T06:17Z,"martinnnemo mate i think if u install visual c++ u r problem will solve..
just google Visual c++"
,bobbyrass,2011-07-26T10:09Z,Works Great mate.
,shinku20,2011-07-28T17:38Z,"thanks it works great! 
and you dont need visual c++ you just need the security update for it which you can get with windows update if you have the right service pack"
,rdm1974,2011-07-28T19:38Z,I'm afraid that I get the same error. Simply downloading the security update for x64 does not doe the trick.
,rdm1974,2011-07-28T19:46Z,"I'm not sure my comment made it: I get the same error with windows 7 x64 ultimate. I DID download the C++ runtime security updates from the proper SP, and the error didn't change."

,koppit,2011-08-11T04:22Z,"Download msvcp90.dll, move to the same directory as the app, and run it. Try moving it and the dll to the root of your drive if it still doesn't work."
,Omen89,2011-08-11T15:17Z,Does it have camera raw? or maybe there's a separate DL for it?
,troubleshoot,2011-08-15T08:53Z,"*** IF YOU ARE ON 64-BIT:

,iJustHadTo,2011-08-15T17:29Z,"I just had to register to comment this torrent.

AWESOME!

15 minutes of download then i just extracted the files and started! worked perfect!

THANKS!"
,rleguy,2011-08-15T23:55Z,Really new at this - downloaded but in file are 9 zip files - opened first one and got photoshop.exe but it don't do anything how do I run setup as it says no need to crack??? install?
,troubleshoot,2011-08-16T05:04Z,@rleguy: you need to highlight all 9 files and tell WinRAR to extract to a folder. Open Photoshop.exe after & it should work instantly.
,jojuae,2011-08-16T22:42Z,Gives me error. Says Access is denied. Help? :(

,Samurai_Josh,2011-08-19T18:07Z,i was gettin the C++ error and i fixed it by just making the proper adobe/photoshop.... ect. folder in my program files and bang it started right up so i guess in my situation it was trying to access files from a diff place than where they were or somethin p.s. not the entire folder would move cuse it said some of it was being used by a diff program but it worked none the less :)
,Samurai_Josh,2011-08-19T18:16Z,i got the c++ error and all i did was made the appropriate adobe/photoshop...etc folder and it worked no prob not all of it moved (it said it was being used by another program) and if this comment is doubled just slightly diff my bad...

,jaydenbadboii,2011-10-19T18:00Z,"Easy to use, just throw the file anywhere and launch it! No installation required, really small file, and portable! (full version in one file!)"
,221b,2011-10-27T20:41Z,"Love the portable versions.  Used it fine for a while, but suddenly it would no longer open or create new files -- you'd click, but then it would just go back to the main PS window without the file.  Googling suggests deleting Adobe's application data/preferences/settings files -- the latter two didn't help, but I'm not sure where the application data would be saved with the portable file; any ideas?"
,Dark-Snk,2011-10-29T14:48Z,"Nice Work Pro

Thanks, just what I needed, I have the program on my PSP and I use it on ANY computer I want!"
,ben7530,2011-11-15T20:50Z,"@damogxn5ti & mrgecko1:

FUCK YOU GUYS! This is a ""portable release"", i.e., no need for serials, cracks at all. your websites lead to stupid ""wanna sign up up for some malware?!?"" sites.

TORRENT WORKS 100%; no serial, no crack.

1. Un-rar program
2. go into newly created directory (Adobe Photoshop CS5 v12.0.3 Portable -Team Rjaa)
3. Run Photoshop.exe
4. USE PROGRAM!

I understand the ""anti-pirating"" argument, but adobe prices their stuff WAY out of the range of students who need these programs for college classes. I am *sure* adobe would prefer to lose a sale and have one more person trained to use photoshop, which will get them a job, and then adobe gewts money from the site license.

Or are you two just spiteful, malware hoisting assholes?"
,z0x1337,2011-11-28T14:50Z,"Works great, was getting Runtime error, fixed the problem by cutting / pasting whole folder in Program Files. Thanks rjaa! :)"

on my XP SP3 32 bit. I tried to put extracted folder under program files, but nothing changes.
 - any ideas?"
,mercier,2012-01-07T18:09Z,"Thank you it runs smoothly, but I have to say that:
1. Image processor and
2. HDR process (Merge to HDR)
and generally the process of running scripts
are NOT working on this portable version of Photoshop.
This portable is a lite version and not full."

,CosmAvngr,2012-04-03T19:39Z,"Poster above is trying to direct you to a dubious site. There is no serial key needed with this version. It never asks for one.
"
,CosmAvngr,2012-04-03T20:07Z,"Does anyone else have the glitch where you need to click menus twice to get them?

Very annoying. I tried a CS4 that didn't have this problem (but it needed a serial).

This one just works, but the double click on the menu drives me nuts."
,Arbiter89,2012-04-05T19:27Z,Thanks for the upload. Works fine.
,avalon57,2012-04-07T13:16Z,"If you run this after copying to prog files run it as administrator and you wont have any probs at all,cheers rjaa for effort."

Hey this is good site with Adobe Photoshop Serial Numbers for all versions, here's the link:

,spid3rm4n,2012-05-27T22:05Z,"Is anyone else having trouble saving files, especially using save as? If so, how do I fix it? "
,mudpoet,2012-06-02T23:31Z,"@spid3rm4n yes we do have the same problem by using ""save as"". I cant save my file in another format using  ""save as"" so here's the other way on how you can save your files in another format just click ""Save for web & devices"" in that way you can save your file in any format like jpeg, png, gif & etc..

@rjaa thanks!"
