A dramatic history of Pu Yi, the last of the Emperors of China, from his lofty birth and brief reign in the Forbidden City, the object of worship by half a billion people; through his abdication, his decline and dissolute lifestyle; his exploitation by the invading Japanese, and finally to his obscure existence as just another peasant worker in the People's Republic.

I took a version already upped by another person (can't remember who, sorry) that was separated into 3 files and combined them.

As always, please seed when you are finished so others may enjoy.  The more people who seed, the more I can upload.
