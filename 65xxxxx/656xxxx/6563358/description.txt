Probably the softest and gentlest of the Sad Lovers and Giants albums, even more so than The Mirror Test, but it's a good look for them. Just a very nice, mellow, pastoral psych-pop sound that might be a bit too lightweight for some listeners, but some of these songs ("Christmas on Easter Island", "The Sky Is a Glove") are just too gorgeous to resist. Basically, this is exactly what you'd expect an album called Treehouse Poetry by a band called Sad Lovers & Giants to sound like. Now why this fantastic record went unnoticed? Since bands making ugly grunge rock were sadly ruling every freaking charts, TV and radio stations.
