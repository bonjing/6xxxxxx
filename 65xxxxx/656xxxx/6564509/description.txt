Notes
Firstly cropped, resized, added a denoiser as the video had alot of noise in it 
which took some removing, added some sharpness to get some life into the video 
ended up encoding this 2 times as 1st time the video still had a lot of noise in it, 
so i ended up deleting the encode and starting again with stronger script

Sample inc

Enjoy
