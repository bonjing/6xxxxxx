,sonofdog,2011-07-28T12:12Z,Stop moaning this is the only copy - better than nothing! Hopefully someone will upload the Colbert report as tpb went down last night and VTV has probably gone to bed.

And stop telling people not to complain. Yes we know it is free etc but without people voicing their opinions then how would anything improve?"
