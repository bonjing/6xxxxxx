@kietio136~ Go Rub 2 Sticks Together Untill You Make Fire. You Freaking Dumb A$$. 

AND Thanks for the up And putting up with the bull. Was hopeing for someone to watch it and comment on how many people you see durring the movie make shadow puppets A/V#, that sort of thing. Now I know why most people jumped ship and headed over to Demon.  "
,falloutg,2011-08-27T07:20Z,A?V?
,MXC1,2011-08-28T12:06Z,"This is real. The puss heads who say otherwise are full of it. Trolls trying to discourage ye olde file sharing I guess.  

Took me less then 30 mins to get this. 10-20 megabit speeds were had for the download process. Mostly 10+ megabit for the full time, once the torrent got started after four mins of the usual connecting checking and happenings. 

This version is the best one I have seen quality wise. Mind you, it is a cam still however. 

On the CAM Scale for Quality:
V: 8
A:6.5 to 7 (varies in parts greatly)

The scenes that are brighter are much better quality then some of the darker ones as fast as visuals go. To be expected however. Audio is fully understandable, just not as crisp as I personally like it. Still, this is AMAZING work for what is not a digital rip. 

Show love and respect to the cats who made this happen! Great quality for a release of this kind! 

Get this copy of you can't wait for rips (R5 or Blu Ray) later on. PeerBlock is lighting up like crazy, but that is what it is for. No fear of being busted with that running. This does seemed to be tacked hard by the usual suspects (Trident Mediaguard and other fags who are Anti P2P) yet... who cares? 

Give this a go! This is legit, has fast down speed and is quality in the very watchable range. Super work here. "
