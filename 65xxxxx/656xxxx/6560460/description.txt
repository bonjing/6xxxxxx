Now, for more serious work.



I tried to eliminate the sets I have previously uploaded, a lot of work it is.



It is going to be a slow upload to start with.


Yes, because there are so many files, I must zip them. They are not actually compressed, only packed. The largest file is about 122 MB only.


I put together a preview folder for everyone's convenience, two pictures per set.


The girl shown here is Blossom.
