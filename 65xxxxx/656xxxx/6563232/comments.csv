,illwrath,2011-07-25T08:28Z,"Okay, so I just selected the 720 version upped to extv.it, and it's dl'ing about 1000 times faster than the low-res version.

Perhaps it's something you should look into?"
,Mr_Mao,2011-07-25T15:53Z,"@illwrath
It's the fact that there are about 8k more users downloading the low rez, than the ones who are downloading the hd version.
Not always does it download faster with more people seeding."
