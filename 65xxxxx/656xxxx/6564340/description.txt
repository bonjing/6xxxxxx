Disney's Magic Artist Studio lets you draw, paint, and create animations with your favorite Disney characters. Create, animate, and print your images with tools and paints that burst onto your screen. Roses sprout from your canvas, and butterflies soar through 3-D paintings virtually dripping with color. Disney character images dance to disco, rock, classical, and island beats.

Then mount the .ISO using Magicdisk or any other mounting program Magicdisk: http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-overview.htm 

It is really a fun game. I have it for my 9 year old sister and she loves playing it.

They do not make this kind of great games anymore.
