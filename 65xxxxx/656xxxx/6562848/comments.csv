I want to be able to run it in the background."
,SoulUploader,2011-07-26T20:38Z,@nrgaway You can use the .iso from my Uploads for VirtualBox

""The disk ""C:\Users\me\Desktop\OS X VM in Windows Kit\Mac OS X Lion Bootable .vmdk (For VMware)\Mac OS X Lion Installer.vmdk"" has internal consistency errors that may be caused by partial corruption of the disk file.  It is recommended that you restore a backup of this virtual machine. If you do not have a backup, VMware Workstation can repair the disk, but there is a possibility that the data on the disk may be corrupt and affect the stability of the guest.
Do you wish to repair the disk and continue?""

Well fuck."
,vacilon,2012-01-31T20:57Z,"I watched the tutorial, but all I got from this torrent was the vmdk - and not all the other files shown in the tut. does ne1 know where to find the files shown in the tutorial?"
,madman_,2012-02-16T11:13Z,"You can download the vmware(v8.*) unlocker from, search on google: inurl:vmware-workstation-8-0-8-0-1-unlocker-to-run-mac-os-x-guest-in-windows-7. Extract that and run the .bat specific to your operation system. Afterwards do what the geek on youtube tells you to do(link in downloaded files). At last you can freely download xcode from app store inside lion. Tested with an intel i7 (dell vostro 460 MT).
I cannot give you links because piratebay does not allow me."
,madman_,2012-02-16T11:15Z,The unlocker alows you to run lion inside vmware 8.
,turdlicker,2012-02-17T22:48Z,Madman: Thanks for responding - I'll try your suggestion (Formerly Vacilon)
,asdhokker,2012-03-18T23:21Z,"this shit doesnt work with vmware.
download VIRTUALBOX and google for ""mac lion on virtualbox"".

should bring up a sysprobs dot com article and after that it WILL work like a charm!! (ignore the iso part in there).

!"
,asdhokker,2012-03-19T01:00Z,"^
if you dont have any internet in the virtualbox, then just configure the network page to use the Bridged Adapter and choose your active network card"
