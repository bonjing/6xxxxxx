,New00Folder,2011-08-10T10:35Z,"Seems like an audio album to me. Can't find anything about a DVD. What exactly is the ""visuals""- live somewhere/already released videos?
I'm sorry if sound like a jerk but 2.54 GB is a lot of data usage."
,Moral_Panic,2011-08-12T06:47Z,The music is from an audio album.  I make the visuals myself. True 720P HD video requires high data usage.
