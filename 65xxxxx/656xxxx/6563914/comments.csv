,yokbisey,2011-07-25T15:38Z,quality is good
,yokbisey,2011-07-25T15:38Z,sound is a bit off though
,Jack14112,2011-07-25T16:10Z,It's Ok ...
,MustangFord,2011-07-25T17:20Z,"Looks OK. The only suntitles out yet is the asap/immerse release, but they seem synced to this one too. English subs here:

,Frice,2011-07-25T18:06Z,"This is the best quality B.B Ep.2 at the moment.

The higher sized files are in fact worse quality than this."
,h4b1t,2011-07-25T23:41Z,"Shite. Don't try to run this on a WD TV hardware player - it will blackscreen, probably crash, and fuck it up so you can't play anymore files until you do a factory reset.

I don't know why people have to release fucking MKVs anyway: whatever people say about avi's quality/compression, it's the standard format so JUST RELEASE IN THAT FFS."
,h4b1t,2011-07-25T23:46Z,"Yeah, why delete my comment?

I repeat: DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS IF YOU WANT TO PLAY IT ON A WDTV BOX. IT WON'T WORK AND YOU'LL HAVE TO RESET TO FACTORY SETTINGS IF YOU WANT TO USE THE PLAYER AGAIN"
[T],insinuendo,2011-07-26T00:42Z,Get a decent player :)
,wooboo,2011-07-26T01:36Z,"The player I have plays everything h4b1t , buy a better one :)"
[T],insinuendo,2011-07-26T02:27Z,"My external players of choice...

The WD Live Hub

and (if you can afford one) the OPPO BD93 and up!"
,afghanwhig02,2011-07-26T16:10Z,"Good quality, plays fine on my WD, ""glitch"" barely even worth mentioning, DL with no worries."
,fillinthisspace,2011-07-27T07:36Z,"h4b1t,
A quick lesson for you.....
AVIs aren't designed to contain h264 video. Putting h264 in an AVI is a ""hack"". AVIs don't support AAC audio. h264 is therefore usually uploaded in an MKV or MP4 container.

You can encode 720p video using Xvid and put it in an AVI without any problem, but you won't get the same quality for a given file size. Therefore the x264 encoder is often used.

If you want an AVI, you'll probably have to download one of the 480p versions. As you're not fussed about what anyone might say about their quality/compression, leave the 720p MKVs to those who prefer them.

AVI is still the standard format for standard definition because it's the most universally supported one, but MKV/MP4 are the standard high definition formats.

I've not downloaded the momentum version, but I can vouch for the quality of this torrent. It's perfect.
