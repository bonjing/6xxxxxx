NOTES: I know this has been done already but a feel av arguably got amongst the best looking video and i know wiout doubt av got the best audio on this at the time of posting. I've worked wonders wi the audio and done a serious number on it. Its almost like good line now and a heluva lot easier to listen to.

Work done:

Video: Resized to 720 resolution and fixed the aspect at the same time. Filtered out all that noise n crap. Gave it a heavy overall sharpen. Lowered the red (cause the source is over red). Lowered contrast slightly. Rebalenced brightness so black is black. Increased saturation a notch to take the overall faded look out it.

Audio: Filtered out most of that anoying hissing and hum. Used a noisegate to reduce the echo a good bit wiout causing the "pump" effect at the same time ( the hardest thing to do wi audio ). Rebalenced the volume. Lowered the left channel a good bit then lowered both channels. Increased stereo widening. Also rebalenced using a gfx equaliser and added more bass and mid range while lowering the treble.
