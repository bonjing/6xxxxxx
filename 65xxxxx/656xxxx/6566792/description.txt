
1998 & third album by the quirky Swedish songstress. Though she's helped out Vangelis & Yello in the past, the 12 diverse cover tunes rendered on 'People Are Strange' find her going a different musical route that ends up on a bridgewith P.J. Harvey on one side and Massive Attack on the other. A mid-tempo masterpiece not to be missed by fans of either, it includes Stina's interpretations of gems by Rod Stewart, Roy Orbison, Prince, Leonard Cohen, the Doors, Tim Hardin and more! 

People Are Strange would convince anyone that this woman will never produce a bad album. She is not capable. Stina Nordenstam has taken eleven songs and completely reinvented them. She has made them her own, and in doing so has created a hauntingly beautiful album that is, by turns, spine-tingling and warm and downright scary. People Are Strange is certainly peculiar. It is warm, sad, thrilling, it is many things. And it is exceptional. (amazon.com)
