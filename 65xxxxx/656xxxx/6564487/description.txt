Plot Summary.......: "Three times Randolph Carter dreamed of the marvelous city, and three times was he snatched away while
                     still he paused on the high terrace above it." Thus begins H. P. Lovecraft's epic tale of the courageous
                     dreamer Randolph Carter and his search for the mystical sunset city by petitioning the gods of
                     Kadath. During his journey, he travels deep into the world of dream, to the edge of the world, to the
                     moon and back, and to the heights and depths of human and... inhuman experience. Written by Edward Martin
