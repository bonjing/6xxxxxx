Roseannes Nuts Mothers day episode is higher on your priority list than the new Through the Wormhole episode? WTF? I look foreward to that show like crack every week. Now I'm stuck downloading from Masterzilla, because they are the only ones with it up, and at an excruciatingly painful 10 kb/sec because nobody downloads from them. Sorry for the hate, I love what you guys do, but could you please put up the new episode already?"
