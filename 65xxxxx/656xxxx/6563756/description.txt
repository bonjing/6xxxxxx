With her exotic beauty and steamy voice, Sade couldn't help but be a star. Taking the more sensuous elements of island beats, smooth jazz, and R&B, Sade scored major hits with the continental feel of Smooth Operator and the sultry stylization of Your Love Is King. Her voice was often criticized for being thin, yet she made it work to her advantage with songs like the haunting Jezebel: Sade sounded best when she stuck to the lower register. There was a time in the mid-90s when this CD was in permanent rotation at any watering hole sophisticated and snoochy enough to charge $15 for a drink. It's not hard to understand why; Best of Sade exudes a hip, laid-back smooth jazz sensibility without ever being the least bit intrusive. It's the soundtrack to your cool life, unbeatable as musical wallpaper for yuppies.
