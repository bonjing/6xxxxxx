This is just one of the albums I bought from Amazon, it's a pop group going since early 60's and they make comical lyrics to pop songs.
For those who remember the Barron Knights, it's nostalgic trip down memory lane, with plenty of laughs along the way.  For those new to this group, well just download it and try it, you just might be pleasantly surprised.

All comments are welcome, but I do ask politely, people moderate their language please, Grandchildren read these comments as well.  Thank you.
