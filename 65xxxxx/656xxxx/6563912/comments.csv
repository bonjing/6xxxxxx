,CakeMonster,2011-07-25T13:23Z,"Not to complain, just wondering, Nromal 44 min or so episodes in 720p are 1.09 Gigs so why is this in 770mb?"
,yokbisey,2011-07-25T13:40Z,"it is complete as 45:45. not sure on the file size though, i think it is 770 mb because it's not as good as a 720p but close to that."
,CakeMonster,2011-07-25T14:02Z,"I see

Thank you for your reply :)"

quality of both video and audio is good, but not excellent for its file size. 
it also suffers from the flaw in audio as apparently other releases do as well: at about 29:50 min the sound bows out for a couple of seconds. but no dialogue is lost and it hardly decreases the almost erotic pleasure of watching this brilliant show."
,bowhan333,2011-07-30T00:32Z,"can someone PLEASE post music from ""Honey Claws""? That song Digital Animal is so stuck in my head! The rest of their music is great, too! i found them on facebook, but can't figure how to snach it from there. Please help."
