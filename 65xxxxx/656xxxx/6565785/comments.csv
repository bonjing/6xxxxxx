Also i was woundering if by any chance you are a fan of Laurel and Hardy as i am a big fan of them myself, i have most of their films and their solo's but i do have a few requests of those that i am unable to get:

should Tall Men Marry?, Scorching Sands, crazy like a fox, Wandering Papas, Mum's The Word, Mighty Like A Mouse, the bakery, love and duty, Angora love, zenobia and air raid wardens.
