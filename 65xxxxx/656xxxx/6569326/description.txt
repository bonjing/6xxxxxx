Praise be to Allah. I thank Him, seek His Help and Forgiveness. I seek refuge in Allah
from the evil of my bad deeds and myself. Whomsoever Allah guides, is truly guided,
and whomsoever Allah leaves to stray, none can guide him. I bear witness that there
is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Seal of His Prophets.
