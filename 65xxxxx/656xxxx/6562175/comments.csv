happens on pc (VLC - WMplayer) and on my Emtec mediaplayer."
,lordquad,2011-08-06T01:52Z,"00'00"" - 05'00"" 100 ms offset
05'00""-26'00"" 200 ms offset
(22'14""80-22'17""50 Jerky video)
26'00""-end 400ms offset

A positive # ms offset means that the audio is # ms after the video."
,lordquad,2011-08-06T01:59Z,"The prior post indicates the positions where the audio is out of sync and by how much in milliseconds. 00' is minutes 00"" is seconds and ""00 is in hundreds of a second.

The estimates are rough but applying these adjustments at the specified points (assuming ""00 where it is not specified) will make the syncs or at least make the out of syncs unnoticeable."
