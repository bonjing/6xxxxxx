[Triste Tropique] (1974) - 35mm - 80 min.

Fiction feature film. A galaxy of discontinuous images. With a new presentation of the conflict between the coast and the sertÃ£o, the film Triste TrÃ³pico, by Arthur Omar, proposes a criticism, full of irony and hallucination, of the anthropological discourse in the tropics. Its main character, a surprising petit bourgeois doctor, embarks on a journey that will invert the sense of Levi-Strauss demarche, as expressed in his book TristeTropique. The allegory of Cinema Novo was conceived as an unveiling, whereas the allegory of Triste TrÃ³pico is a movement towards opacity, and what poses a problem is the very act of reading. Triste TrÃ³pico is meta-cinema and, from this point of view, it is different from the forms of anti-colonialism of the 70s in Brazil. (Ismail Xavier, in the book Allegories of Underdevelopment)
