,prius4845,2012-02-09T01:40Z,Can you do a season 2 torrent whenever it comes out?
,Kali916,2012-03-15T16:03Z,Thanks for this quality is good please upload next season
,afkuser,2012-03-16T06:32Z,"Season 2 doesn't seem to be complete.  Maybe (hopefully) they canceled this show.  It really does suck compared with the (good) UK version.
Check out the torrents here:
