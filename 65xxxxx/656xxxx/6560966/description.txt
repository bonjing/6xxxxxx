Description: 
Waldemar Januszczak continues his investigation of the 
Impressionists by taking us outdoors to their most famous 
locations. Although Impressionist pictures often look 
sunny and relaxed, achieving this peaceful air was hard 
work. Trudging through fog, wind and rain, across treacherous 
coastal rocks and knee-deep snow, Waldemar shows 
how the famous spontaneity of the Impressionists is 
thoroughly misleading.
This episode visits the French riverside locations that 
Monet loved to paint, and where Renoir captured the 
bonhomie of modern life. Waldemar also introduces a 
number of technical and practical developments of the 
age which completely revolutionised Impressionist 
painting - the invention of portable easels; the use of 
hog's hair in paint brushes; as well as the introduction of 
the railway through France. And a scientific demonstration 
in a Swedish snowdrift explains just how right the 
Impressionists were to paint brightly coloured shadows in 
their winter scenes, despite being accused of 
'hallucinating' at the time.Finally, Januszczak explains 
Cezanne's part in the Impressionist story from his dark and 
challenging early work to his first rural landscapes in 
France, and then his departure from Paris and separation 
from the Impressionist gang.
