There‘s one line across the screen near the bottom that‘s out of pixelation now and again, it‘s nothing major, and it just might be my copy... 
Many Thanx to fasamoo and Anarchy for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:)"
,cassandra_cain,2011-07-24T15:09Z,I always appreciate it when rippers include subtitles in the torrent. Thank you.
,hitnrun4fun,2011-07-24T21:32Z,Kick Ass was a rip off of Defendor
,ekapan,2011-07-24T21:35Z,"awesome movie 
great rip"
,drkstar,2011-07-24T23:41Z,"@hitnrun4fun-

Are one of those idiots who will let any crap roll off of their tongue without knowing what the hell they're talking about? Kick Ass was a comic first and was published in 2008. Defendor was written in 2009. Both Defendor and this movie are almost embarrassingly bad while Kick Ass (sorry for this) kicks ass. "

,jstndrn,2011-07-25T20:36Z,"If you're going to say that this is a ripoff of Kick Ass, and then that Kick Ass is a ripoff of Defendor, then all three a ripoffs of Mystery Men."
,jstndrn,2011-07-25T20:43Z,"Though to be fair, this movie seems like a ripoff of Kickass and Defendor has always seemed to be a ripoff of Special (where a man has a mental lapse due to medication and is convinced he's a superhero). Anyway, I love all these movies, but Mystery Men was likely the first MOVIE (emphasis on movie) that was based on ordinary people trying to be superheroes."
,tixan,2011-07-25T21:38Z,"Super, Kick Ass, Green Hornet, all seems to be about the same thing and all of them are comedic."

,halfsquid,2011-07-26T21:58Z,"this movie felt like I was watching a MOCKBUSTER version of Kick Ass. I asked myself how did they lure the half man, half pig known as Kevin Bacon into their little low budget made for TV movie. 

@fasamoo  Thanks for the up!"
,jmcpdx,2011-07-26T23:41Z,halfsquid - Your comment about wondering how they got Kevin Bacon in this?  Have you seen Elephant White?  Kevin Bacon will clearly do anything.
,7r0j4n,2011-07-27T11:59Z,Kick ass sucked so bad.......but as for this movie i was attracted to it after a friend showed me the scene where that juno girl rapes dwight guy forgot their real names but good movie

,oOoVEGITAoOo,2011-07-30T19:12Z,If you thought Kick Ass was a bad movie your a tard who should watch it sober.
,HANFURRA,2011-07-31T13:42Z,"a, v: 10
m: 2, including one extra point for a couple of amusing scenes 

this movie doesn't know if it's supposed to be realistic or a crazy comedy, and shifts between the two in a way that takes the realism out of the realism and the fun out of the fun. all of which you don't notice if you're 10 years old or a retard, in that case you'll like it. "
,scottsasse,2011-08-01T08:16Z,"HANFURRA is totally right, this movie is absolutely horrible!! The idea behind it is genius. However this does not translate to the screen. I expected so much more from IFC and the actors. Perhaps they prematurely blew their wad on well known actors. Often unknown actors are ""hungry"" and delve themselves deeper into their roles thus creating brilliant characters. Hell, I could have made this movie better using only one months pay!! Trust me the only thing interesting about this film is it's poster and even that looks kind of cheep. I fully support independent and low budget cinema but this is a sad disappointment. As for those who talk trash about Kickass (which I think was like getting a much needed, very fresh breath of air) well, your small little stoner minds might just love this film!! I rate this film a generous 1 out of 10 only because of it's cool 3D like poster. As for the A/V quality, it's a 10 given the file size. Many THANKS to fasamoo for the upload and to all those who seed!! Lotta Love, DrScott"
,porkyobma,2011-08-02T03:41Z,"@ the people hating on this movie. You're probably 50 years old and still living with your mother.

This movie had great acting and was ridiculously funny, while it also demented at times. 

Screw off and don't post comments if no one cares about your opinions in real life."
,Smuggles,2011-08-03T12:15Z,"Great movie. Sad, funny, dramatic, ridiculous, very conflicting but definitely worth a watch. Thoroughly enjoyed it."
,JoeB4ever,2011-08-04T08:06Z,"By far not your average super hero movie. Same premise as kickass. It had some weird parts, but overall I loved it. It did have more potential though.

,george1052,2011-08-15T18:29Z,"Hi everyone, I want to put this movie on a disc however the audio will not transfer. This has never happened to me before. I've been seeding now for 4 days (usually like to seed for a week before I delete the movie from my hard drive). I used to wonder why some people would ask on various torrents, ""Will it play on dvd player...Will it play on PS3?"" Now I think I understand why. Does anyone have any suggestions as to why the audio will not transfer to disc? The video is fine. I'm one of those folks that like to burn the movies on discs and watch them on my 50-inch t.v. screen as opposed to being confined to a 17-inch computer monitor. Thanks in advance for any possible solutions. "

Anyway aside from that, interesting part of the movie is when 24 year old Ellen Page seducing/teasing 45 year old ugly creep to f**k her. She can't resist anymore and lol she raped him and rode on top of him screaming that she's ""c*mming"". That was awesome."
