Synopsis: The movie is entirely built upon Keve, a successful movie director. He has a conveniently located cabin in the KÃ¥seberga area on Ã–sterlen in SkÃ¥ne, a beautiful wife, Ann-Marie, and daughter, Nina. All things considered, he should be happy but instead he feels unharmonical, lonely and disoriented. As every other summer he has invited his friends to a small party. Inger and Kent, a young couple in the divoce process are also there. During the preparations for the party, Keve leaves the cabin and walks about in the nearby village. He finds a poster which announces a lecture being held this day. He knows the lecturer BjÃ¶rn briefly and decides to go listen to what he has to say. At this very lecture he finds BjÃ¶rns wife Evabritt who makes a profound impression on Keve... 

Afterword: From Widerbergs official biography it is revealed that Michelangelo Antonioni was a guest critic of the Swedish movie magazine Chaplin and remarked [on this feature] that â€œ...his film (Love 65) has life, precise characters, intensive scenes and a certain sense of humour.â€
