What if you don't meet the love of your life until you are dead?

An uptight and uninspired dentist Suzy meets the ghost of an 80s English rock star Henry Mallet, that turns her seemingly dull life upside down.

From the producers of Love My Way, this Australian supernatural drama is "a romantic look at life and love after death with a Rock 'n Roll twist." 

With Claudia Karvan, Matt King, Rodger Corser, Belinda Bromilow.
