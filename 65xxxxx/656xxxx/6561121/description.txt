David Liebman If They Only Knew (with John Scofield) [EAC>FLAC] [JAZZ] (Size: 221.71 MB)

This out of print disc has some solid performance energy with John Scofield and the nimble (yet well planted) fret action of Mr. McClure. Mr. Nussbaum can be surprisingly heavy on this recording..watch out! This is one of my favorite recordings by this power house reed man. Oh forgot to mention that Mr. Hino makes sure you remember he was on this album.

This pressing is from the Impulse catalogue, but I believe it was originally marketed on Timeless Records.

Mr. Liebman is still performing. If you like his music seek out: 1) Mosaic Select: David Liebman & Richie Beirach by Liebman and Beirach. 2) Quest II by Quest or 3) Abracadabra by Jeff Palmer, David Liebman, John Abercrombie and Adam Nussbaum. These recordings are much different from what you have here but all are worth owning. 

Remember support the artist. See them in concert and purchase their music!!!
