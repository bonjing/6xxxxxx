dedicated cultural conservative/nationalist.

Included are also demographical studies, historical statistics, forecasts and insights on various subjects related to the ongoing and future struggle of Europe. It covers most topics related to historical events and aspects of past and current 

Islamic Imperialism, which is now removed or falsified by our academia by instruction of Western Europeâ€™s cultural relativist elites (cultural relativism=cultural Marxism). 

It offers thorough analysis of Islam, which is unknown to a majority of Europeans. It documents how the political doctrines known as multiculturalism/cultural Marxism/cultural relativism was created and implemented. 

Multiculturalists/cultural Marxists usually operate under the disguise of
humanism. A majority are anti-nationalists and want to deconstruct European identity,traditions, culture and even nation states.

As we all know, the root of Europe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s problems is the lack of cultural self-confidence (nationalism). Most people are still terrified of nationalistic political doctrines thinking that if we ever embrace these principles again, new â€œHitlerâ€™sâ€ will suddenly pop up and initiate global Armageddon... Needless to say; the growing numbers of nationalists in W.Europe are systematically being ridiculed, silenced and persecuted by the current cultural
Marxist/multiculturalist political establishments. 


This has been a continuous ongoing process which started in 1945. This irrational fear of nationalistic doctrines is preventing us from stopping our own national/cultural suicide as the Islamic colonization is increasing annually. 



This book presents the only solutions to our current problems.
You cannot defeat Islamisation or halt/reverse the Islamic colonization of Western Europe without first removing the political doctrines manifested through multiculturalism/cultural Marxismâ€¦
