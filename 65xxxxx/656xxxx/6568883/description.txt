* This realease and cracks, plus activators  *

* AV calls anything, its wrong, there are    * 
* no virus in this realease                  * 
* This realeas was made with the resources   *
* available for the Dragon Age 2, so nothing *
* is cracked really, but should work         *
* if you follow the instructions             *
