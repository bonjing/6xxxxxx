A heroic crusader (Nicolas Cage - Knowing, Drive Angry) and his close ally (Ron Perlman - Hellboy, Sons of Anarchy) return home after decades of fierce fighting to find their world destroyed by the Plague.

Believing a witch to be responsible for the devastation, they are commanded by the church Cardinal (Christopher Lee - Lord of The Rings) to transport the girl to a remote monastery where monks will perform an ancient ritual to rid the land of her curse.

But they soon discover the girl's dark secret and find themselves battling a powerful and destructive force that will determine the fate of the world forever.
