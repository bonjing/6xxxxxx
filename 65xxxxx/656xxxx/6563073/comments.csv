,trick721,2011-07-25T08:09Z,Bad encode! Video skips and is low quality. Not watchable. Video won't display at all in VLC.
,TokeUp420,2011-07-25T09:01Z,"THANKYOU, I FUCKING LOVE THIS SHOW"
,kinglear2000,2011-07-25T09:03Z,"Yep, really disappointed with audio and visual, both were unacceptable. "
,Igemo75,2011-07-25T09:27Z,"Read this BEFORE you get this torrent...

,seVIIn,2011-07-25T09:57Z,"Tested in GOM player and XMBC the audio was not noticeably out of sync for me. Definitely watchable, I wouldn't say it's bad quality, but yeah, it could be better.  There are noticeable encoding artifacts.  Hoping for a FQM version maybe it will be better. Thanks EZTV."
,trick721,2011-07-25T10:32Z,Don't understand how people can watch video like this and not notice a problem. Every fourth frame is missing.
,480p,2011-07-25T15:12Z,"Folks stop complaining and try this

,benandlol,2011-07-25T18:02Z,"I watched the whole thing, there was a high pitched buzzing and the theme was choppy. It was still watchable and I was lost in the world of breaking bad. "
,Derfbro,2011-07-25T19:26Z,"In response to Onyxday's comment:
Is 15000 seeders not enough for you?  Is a 2 minute download too long for you?  How about fucking off and buying the season when it comes out, bitch!!!"
,Lonsman,2011-07-25T22:32Z,Would be great if someone could do a proper grab and release a version in sync and good quality video. I'd do it myself but some of my technology is in for repair.
[V],maximersk,2011-07-26T00:20Z,"Video quality is low than Ep 01 HDTV
S04E01 is better quality than S04E02 !!!!
What the hell is goin'on."
,Lonsman,2011-07-26T01:22Z,"Would be grateful for a quality upload!
Thank you, stranger!"
,h4b1t,2011-07-26T14:12Z,"DO NOT download this, quality terrible. Get this one instead: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6565948/Breaking_Bad_S04E02_Thirty-Eight_Snub_PROPER_HDTV_XviD-FQM_%5Beztv"
,spifkitten99,2011-07-27T08:22Z,"Really really bad encoding.

(And no, it's not my player, my codecs or computer. It's poorly encoded.)
"
,spifkitten99,2011-07-27T08:23Z,"Unwatchable.

Unsmooth video and bad quality.

Whoever encoded this, just needs to stop and give up."

,useitright,2011-08-06T11:19Z,"I got this one first because it was the first on here I think but now that I watched it I realized that it was not a very good copy.
