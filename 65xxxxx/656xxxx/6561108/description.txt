This is not your tricycle style classical offering! This recording is in print but appears to be very difficult to get at times. It is NOT Mozart (sorry not a fan.. but his Requiem, Piano Concerto No. 24 in C minor, K. 491 and Don Giovanni I do recommend).

Hugo Alfven (May 1, 1872 â€“ May 8, 1960) was a Swedish violinist and composer. I believe he also was a painter and a conductor. He composed five symphonies (all brilliant) and a number of choral compositions.

The recording label is BIS. They are an incredible label. Anything they offer will be of the highest quality. It is also an "import"....so, expect higher, than usual, prices if you purchase from their catalogue.
