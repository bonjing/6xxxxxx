,ToiletClown,2011-07-26T15:50Z,"It seems the key is dependent on the user. I haven't tested other users as I couldn't find the location where the key was stored.
Try using 'asd' as username (without quotes) and still the same key 1373-583-0-0."
,RodolfoA,2011-07-26T18:54Z,"Change the description, with asd username the game works!
Very good game, and very good work!"
