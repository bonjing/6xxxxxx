,malleryknox,2011-08-22T05:55Z,"As a recovering addict myself, I know the pull drugs and alcohol have on someone. I'm not saying that's how she died but I was always rooting for her somehow. My condolences to Miss Winehouse's family and loved ones. Godspeed Amy! I pray that you've finally found peace."
,emclis,2011-08-25T13:05Z,"RIP Amy. I was supprised when i found out she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Not because it does not fit, but because i had not heard about it until she had died. Where was the help for her! i have bipolar and was forced into hospital for much less. so tragic..."
