Movie is so lame! Not funny at all. Not even worth the five minutes to download it."
,goblix127,2011-07-30T11:08Z,movie doesn't come to dvd br till aug 9 so i doubt this is the real deal
,war59312,2011-07-31T03:49Z,"@goblix127 Yes it's real.

Why don't you try watching it first next time before spreading FUD!"
,cldrain,2011-08-01T04:02Z,"This movie is not funny, at all. Actually, it's quite disturbing.  

The quality is good as always, so if you want to waste your bandwidth, then go ahead.  "
,ej33t,2011-08-01T11:06Z,"This movie is absolutely terrible. What makes it worse is that I've been looking forward to it for months. If I'd have paid for this I'd want my money back, thankfully I didn't.

,SoMeGuY_101,2011-08-12T06:12Z,"YO i just downloaded this movie an the picture is great, but the audio wont work for me i got       K-Lite Codec 7.6.0 can someone help me ???"
,J.S.L,2011-08-13T00:48Z,"Great Qualiy!

The movie was very funny, but the plot was a little weak. However i liked it, thanks!"
,andimspent,2011-08-13T19:08Z,"This movie should not be watched sober. It's entirely intended to be watched stoned. 

Trying to empathize with the characters or criticize the plot was not really on the minds of the people involving in making this, rather it was a, ""Imagine if this-and-that happened in such-and-such fantasy situation.""

I'm not trying to justify this as a way of film-making, just saying it's one of the only rewarding ways to watch this movie."

,limited305,2011-10-14T01:23Z,"Quality is great
Movie is great

Don't think too much into it, 
and enjoy yourself.. you'll like it."
