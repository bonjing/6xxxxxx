The Younger family strives to get out of their ghetto neighborhood on the south side of Chicago. When the patriarch of the family passes away and each family member is handed a slice of the insurance payoff, their escape finally seems possible. Each has a dream, each dream costs money, and each dream has a catch that threatens to tear the family apart.
