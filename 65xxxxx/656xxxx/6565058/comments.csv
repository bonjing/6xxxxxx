,deckra,2011-09-10T02:21Z,"The issues with this book is that it makes the broad sweeping references that ""If this is happening most of the time they are lieing"". If you take the specific examples, and discount the broad generalities then it is actually rather accurate as a helpful guide, even though you'll never be able to accurately use this without using another source to get the most out of what is presented in this book."

,mdbutler,2012-05-19T11:36Z,"@Hokrollo Buddy, your credibility is drop faster than a prostitute drops to her knees in a crack house.  Pointedly, when making a categorical assertion, try to use, at least, the grammatical skills of third grade kid with a learning disability.  

""if you care read this book you will never be able to see if people are lying.""  This is called an absolute.  (absolute stupidity)  If A occurs, then B must occur.  Therefore, the sufficient condition ""if one reads the book"", requires the necessary condition ""then distinguishing truth from non-truth is NEVER possible.""  Your premise fails (shocker).  One could mistakenly distinguish truth from non-truth, and thus, your entire argument (much like your life) fails.  Logical negation maybe illustrative: if distinguishing the truth from false is Always possible, then because you don't care to read the book you will always be able to distinguish the truth from lie.  Sounds stupid, huh? It's exactly what you wrote.   

Also, Master of the obvious: thanks for clarifying that people are different.  Chew on this Einstein - does a universal truth exist among all races, ethnicity, and cultures?  NopeâŚ to further bust your weak ass logic cherry, all I need do is find one instance where slight ambiguity exists.  

While you might be a pro masturbator, you're not a master debater. "
