The Strange Case of Mr. Hyde #1-4 complete

Sometimes good police work just isnâ€™t enough, as Inspector Thomas Adye of 
Scotland Yard finds out when heâ€™s assigned to the Jack the Ripper case. 
Heâ€™ll need the guidance of imprisoned madman and amoral libertine, Dr. 
Henry Jekyll, whose mind-splitting serum Jack might be using to commit 
his bloody murders.
