,xyhu,2011-08-27T13:55Z,Its only Offline Single Player Game. Good mods. THX
,jagedge,2011-08-27T22:11Z,"The folder name in the archive has a space in the name. When you copy it into ~/Library/Application\ Support it needs to be renamed ""minecraft"", without the space in the name. The space is clearly visible if you copy the folder from the shell rather than in Finder."
,busta5000,2011-08-29T23:09Z,The game works fine but I can't seem to install mods! I want to install single player commands mod but I can't when ever I paste .class connects inside the minecraft.jar the game doesn't launch! In fact I tried lots of minecraft editions all do not work! when I try to apply this mod. So can you please test if the single player commads works and if it does tell me how because the method I'm using is not working.
,kyliandeman,2011-09-01T23:20Z,"@busta5000

i had the same problem but with another torrent try using mcpatcher

just download it and press the ''+'' button search the single player commands download and dubbel click it than press the ''patch'' button and it should work! 

oh! and make shure that the single player commands is in a .zip file in your mod folder,

you can find the mod folder in your mincraft folder

and you can compress a file into a .zip by simply opening the singleplayer commands folder and selecting everything, right click and choose the ''archive'' button, 

hope it works i am dutch so maiby i made some mistake in the english here and there let me know if it works or not!

,piccaroo,2012-01-10T04:48Z,"For those ppl who can't get this to work. You need to go back to the minecraft folder, click on the name and take out the space that's at the end. That will make you be able to play offline ^_^"
,noeldiego,2012-02-07T08:29Z,"I'd like to install yogbox on a fresh installation but seems i need to have and valid account for the ""force update"" option work. Can't you, Benskie13, provide an unmodded version?"
,JaxtaT,2012-02-21T04:33Z,"wth??? i moved everything to where it sed (i think) and all that comes up is Minecraft Launcher with minecraft news on it, and a login thing. i made an account online but this says USER NOT PREMIUM and NOT DOWNLOADED.

,JaxtaT,2012-02-21T04:37Z,oh and i don't care about playing online. i just want to play offline... what do i do???
,swirlEYEboy,2012-02-29T14:50Z,"When copying the 'minecraft ' folder, make sure to delete the (probably accidental) space at the end of the folder name. "
,Anmack,2012-03-28T23:25Z,"Deleted the space, still won't work..any other suggestions? I put the minecraft folder in App support, and the Minecraft app in applications, but it's still insisting that I can't login
Also, it says "" not downloaded""
What's going wrong?"
,Axel57,2012-05-31T08:01Z,"@Anmack  i just downloaded it and works fine for me, you have to use the login and passwrd thats already there, itll say log in fail but it will give you the option to play offline."
,nthngwrks,2012-06-05T02:52Z,"I made an account just to share this (hopefully) useful piece of info. 

I was having the same ""not downloaded"" issue as a few other commenters and it took me an embarrassing amount of time to realize I had put minecraft in the wrong App Support folder. Make sure you have it in the one under Users/{UserName}. 
The game is working great now! 

When all else fails, follow the directions. Ha!"
