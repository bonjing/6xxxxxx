Set in the near future, Shadow Ops: Red Mercury is a gritty, real-world first-person shooter (FPS) in which the player fills the combat boots of an elite Delta Force operative. When a female Russian double-agent discovers information on "Red Mercury" - a secret substance that can be used as a nuclear accelerant -- the player is hand-picked by the National Security Agency (NSA) to pursue the Red Mercury before it is used to build backpack nuclear devices and sold to terrorist organizations. Using the latest UnrealÂ® Technology from Epic Games, developer Zombie Games is creating an ultra-realistic game world spanning Middle Eastern cities and towns to the secret military bases in the frozen backcountry of Russia to other global hotspots in the Philippines, Bosnia and Western Europe.
