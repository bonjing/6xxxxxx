,mojazubarka,2011-07-26T13:37Z,"Sorry for this question, but is this your's sick joke or what. First of all you started uploading FP3 in MPEG TS format and 40MB's to go you suddenly decide to stop uploading it. Now you started uploading mkv file, which is bigger than the MPEG TS file, and 25MB to go you stop uploading file. I think this is not funny at all. :-("
