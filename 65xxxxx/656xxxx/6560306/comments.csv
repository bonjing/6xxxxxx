Original aspect-ratio: 1:85:1
This release: 4:3

Meaning: About 25% has been cut away.

Doubt it the source was DVD5 (as in legit; rental).

But good quality and viewable."
,nbrazil,2011-09-27T04:33Z,"There is not reason it couldn't have been a DVD5. Remember, this movie was over 15 years old when it likely saw release on DVD. A lot of rental DVDs were still 'fullscreen' pan and scan back then because too many people freaked out at letterboxing, even though it meant seeing the whole movie. "
