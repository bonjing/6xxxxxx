Parted Live is a small bootable GNU/Linux distribution for x86 based computers.
It enables you to use all the features of the latest versions of the GParted application.

GParted live 0.9.0-7
The underlying GNU/Linux operating system is based on the Debian Sid repository (as of 2011/Jul/28).
Bug fixed: Packages ntfs-3g and libntfs3g were downgraded to 2011.1.15AR.4-2. (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=655215).
Gdisk was updated to 0.7.2, and compiled without unicode support. Therefore no more libicu44 is included. This makes the GParted live iso file smaller by about 6 MB.
