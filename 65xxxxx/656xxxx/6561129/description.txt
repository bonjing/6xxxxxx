"You're Not Alone" by Roy Buchanan

This was Roy Buchanan's 3rd album of his Atlantic trilogy ("A Street Called Straight" the 1st and "Loading Zone" the 2nd). This was his first venture recording using a Gibson Les Paul instead of his signature wood grain Fender Telecaster. I love this recording! It was released on CD in 2002. I own a mint vinyl copy that is signed. Unfortunately, this has been out of print for sometime. It did not do great in sales and went to the waste side. This is NO reflection on the quality of music offered. This was strictly a money issue. The only way to get this, that I know of, is if someone is willing to depart with their copy or some cheap mp3 release.

Please do not support mp3 sales of albums that should be released with complete sonic integrity!

Seed this one...keep it going strong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If you like this music...explore some of his other recordings. Nothing else in his catalogue sounds like this! Unfortunately, he is no longer with us physically.

This rip was from a Japanese Import release.
