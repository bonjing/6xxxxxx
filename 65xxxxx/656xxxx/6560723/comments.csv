,hootieman,2011-07-23T22:12Z,fail I got windows 7 didn't need any of this shit to make it work. Go fuck yourself you flammer
,precup.mircea,2011-07-23T23:30Z,@hootieman: this was uploaded for people that do not know about the WA W7 fix so no need to swear. If you're aware about the issue regarding the colors displayed in WA - then you should know this helps. Thank you anyway for the useless comment.
,vedran769,2011-07-24T02:34Z,"here's a question(probably stupid)
how to copy/overwrite the WA.exe file or is there any other way to run it without cd"
,precup.mircea,2011-07-24T09:22Z,"Just drag and drop the WA.exe file into the folder that already contains the old WA.exe file (copy). Once you release the mouse, because of the fact that a file with the same name is already there, it will ask you to overwrite. That's COPY/OVERWRITE."
,precup.mircea,2011-07-24T09:24Z,My old WA.exe file is located in C:\Program Files\Worms Armageddon - New Edition\ (where I installed the game) so I copied and overwrote mine there. I hope I made myself clear :)
,vedran769,2011-07-24T14:34Z,thank you...it works now :)
,nepenthe6,2011-07-24T15:13Z,"@hootieman: ""fail""? I think you described yourself well with that word... you poor, unhappy creature. ;)

@precup.mircea: Thanks for the upload and helpful comments. Oh, and please ignore the trolls... we keep them for fun, but sometimes they just freak out. :)"
