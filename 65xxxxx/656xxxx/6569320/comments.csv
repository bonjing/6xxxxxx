,Ki-aka-Kyle,2011-08-07T01:54Z,Lol at all the fake accounts being made to try and discourage you from downloading torrents ^.^ what a shame you all say the same thing on atleast 30 different torrents ^.^ wow guess we should be asking for your accounts to be banned :)

This does not need a Password as noted. However the sound quality is extremely poor and heavily amplified. Subtitles are strictly in Dutch and has no productions original menu leading to the fact that this is a obvious botched copy.

Please do not download this torrent as you will be wasting your time. I feel more sorry for the seeders."
