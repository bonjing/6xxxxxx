Title: KICK ASS
Type: Authoring, Custom Menu, Untouched Video Stream BD50
Source: UK Blu-Ray Region B (English DTS-HD MA 5.1, English AC3 5.1,English Subtitles)
Authoring/added:
- Professionally re-synched BD Italian DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio track
- Professionally created and re-synched Italian AC3 5.1 audio track 
- Re-synched Italian subtitles (movie, commentary, signs (would be forced))
- Re-synched Polish subtitles
- Re-synched Portuguese subtitles

Notes: the Italian BluRay disc has H.264 MPEG-4 AVC Video at 24.000fps and very low
15Mbps average bitrate, which means it doesn't look good. UK BluRay release offers
24Mbps average bitrate in 23.976fps original format, which means outstanding quality.
The BluRay Italian DTS HD-MA 5.1 has been re-sampled, enhanced, re-synched and re-encoded
at maximum DTS-HD MA quality (higher bitrate DTS core too). The LFE channel was taken directly
from the English DTS-HD MA audio track because it sounds louder and better with less noise. 
The Italian AC3 5.1 was encoded from the same raw audio tracks used for DTS HD-MA 
with no quality loss. Italian subtitles, the 3rd one is most signs translations. Polish 
and Portuguese subtitles added too.
