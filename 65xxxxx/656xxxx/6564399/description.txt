Storyline: In December 2009, military virologist Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville (Will Smith), lost his wife Zoe (Salli Richardson) and daughter Marley (Willow Smith) in a helicopter accident during the chaotic quarantine of Manhattan. K.V. (Krippen Virus), a genetically-engineered variant of the measles virus meant as a cancer cure, mutates into a lethal strain and spreads throughout the world, killing 5.4 billion people (90% of humanity). In September 2012, Neville is the last healthy human in New York City. Of the 600 million survivors worldwide, only 12 million were naturally immune to the virus. The rest degenerated into hairless, aggressive beings referred to as "Darkseekers,"[4] who hunted the immune humans as prey. The "Darkseekers" are so named for hiding during daylight due to a painful intolerance to UV radiation. The infected show increased speed, agility, aggression and strength. They also have an increased metabolic rate, which consumes the infected with an overwhelming hunger, making them resort to cannibalism. Despite their primal behavior, the Darkseekers display some basic problem-solving intelligence and the capacity for organization.
