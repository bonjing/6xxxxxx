Installation:

Extract and run Halo.exe, its prebuilt as portable version. Put this version up cuz last time some noobs showed up and didn't know what the .map file was for, 2 people claimed fake and a virus, which was crap. So incorporated it into a portable version of the trial version itself. Keep in mind its only 1 level but it puts a whole new spin on the level. I find it makes the game more like Quake 3 Arena where camping doesn't pay, and anyone who take 1st place. It gets more chaotic by the second when more players jump in. This mod is the combination of 2 mods, the artwork from Warren, and the separate guns and maps mod. This is version 1.2 of this mod so far.
