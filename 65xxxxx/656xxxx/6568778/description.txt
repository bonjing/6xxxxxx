 Your hands-on guide to real-world applications of linear algebra
 Does linear algebra leave you feeling lost? No worries â€”this easy-to-follow guide explains the how and the why of solving linear algebra problems in plain English. From matrices to vector spaces to linear transformations, you'll understand the key concepts and see how they relate to everything from genetics to nutrition to spotted owl extinction.

 â€¢ Line up the basics â€” discover several different approaches to organizing numbers and equations, and solve systems of equations algebraically or with matrices
 â€¢ Relate vectors and linear transformations â€” link vectors and matrices with linear combinations and seek solutions of homogeneous systems
 â€¢ Evaluate determinants â€” see how to perform the determinant function on different sizes of matrices and take advantage of Cramer's rule
 â€¢ Hone your skills with vector spaces â€” determine the properties of vector spaces and their subspaces and see linear transformation in action
 â€¢ Tackle eigenvalues and eigenvectors â€” define and solve for eigenvalues and eigenvectors and understand how they interact with specific matrices
