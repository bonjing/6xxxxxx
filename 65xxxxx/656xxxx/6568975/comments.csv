[V],extremezone,2011-07-28T13:53Z,@roburt release date was 1 July 2011 so for a good quality encode you need to wait as usual 2-3 months
,Peskens,2011-07-28T14:51Z,"@ Extremezone,

Thanks for the Upload.

Can you upload "" Pirates 4 - Stranger Tides  & Fast&Furious 5  soon.

Or are thes not yet released on dvd/blu-ray?"
[V],extremezone,2011-07-28T15:19Z,"@Peskens as stated these movies usually takes about 3 months to appear as dvd/bluray , check imdb for releasing date and wait as we all do ;)"

Ok, but some of these movies are earlier released in the United States, then in Europe, 

But I see it when you load it up.

Thanks.. "

M-7 Not a bad movie, much better than the first for sure..Would like to see them make a 3rd and a Dawn of the Dead type thing..never can get enough of the zombie/infection movies personally//will seed for 24 hours"
,whatever89,2011-08-05T12:47Z,I don't understand why they didn't just remake the story for REC 2??? Seeing as Quarantine was a remake of REC it seems to make sense.
,fl33312,2011-08-05T22:43Z,Is this another Hindi flick?
,ilovefatgirls,2011-08-06T05:45Z,ty much bro good job as usual
,y3n007,2011-08-08T00:38Z,"I dont care what anybody says but I liked REC and Quarantine, so I hope this one is as good as the other two, story remake or not....."

This COULD have been a decent ""B"" movie but has one of the worst endings imaginable. It just cuts.
The plot is a very standard but the character development is poor & predictable.
ALL the areas where it COULD have gone were left alone. Instead it falls on ""jumping out"" scary and silence and loud noise thrills.
The quality is good - it is a movie that could have been interesting but it drops every chance it gets....(?)"
,pregnantcowlady,2011-08-08T05:29Z,thank you!
,scottsasse,2011-08-09T02:42Z,"@ DirtyMurd, Not always faster but it does engage your torrent client to a longer, more constant upload until the torrent is in a more ""healthy"" state. And good question!!"
