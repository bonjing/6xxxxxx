The third DVD from the video collection. This time with Meat Loaf's greatest TV performances. There are 24 great TV performances on this disc from several shows. From a fantastic 'Paradise by the Dashboard Light' act from the Old Grey Whistle Test from 1978 to the funny Bagel Byte song with Jimmy Fallon from 2011. It's all on this disc. The quality of the footage varies but all in all another great collection DVD.
