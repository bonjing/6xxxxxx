From Wiki:


Better Than Ezra is an American alternative rock trio based in New Orleans, Louisiana. Better Than Ezra was formed in 1988[1] by its four original members - vocalist and guitarist Kevin Griffin; Joel Rundell, the lead guitarist; bassist Tom Drummond; and drummer, Cary Bonnecaze.[1] All four members were attending Louisiana State University at the time of Better Than Ezra's formation.[1] Better Than Ezra's first public performance was at Murphy's in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, also in 1988.[2] Though many theories abound, the band refuses to disclose the origin of its name.[2] Fans of the group often refer to themselves as Ezralites.[3]

Better Than Ezra circulated a demo cassette tape later in 1988, the Chimes Street Demo. While not an official release, this demo is sought-after by the band's fans, and traded by collectors. In 1990 the band released a cassette-only album, Surprise.

Joel Rundell, the band's lead guitarist, committed suicide on August 8, 1990.[1] The remaining three members of the band took some time off to reassess its future following Rundell's death.[1] However, Griffin, Drummond and Bonnecaze reunited Better Than Ezra as a trio by the end of 1990.[1] The trio continued playing house parties and fraternity shows across southern United States during the early 1990s.

The band released its first nationally-distributed album Deluxe in 1993 on its own indie label,[4] Swell Records, which caught the attention of major record labels and radio. Better Than Ezra signed with Elektra Records in 1995.[4] Elektra Records rereleased Deluxe in 1995 and the single, "Good", reached the #1 position on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart which helped push the album to platinum record status by the end of 1995.[5]

Success came quickly to Better Than Ezra. Tom Drummond commented later in a 1998 interview with CNN, "It took us seven years to get signed, and then seven weeks to get to No. 1." when describing the overnight success of Deluxe and its single "Good".

After Deluxe's major label release, original drummer Cary Bonnecaze left the band in 1996.[1] He was replaced by drummer Travis McNabb,[1] formerly of the band Vigilantes of Love, who was tapped to play on the band's upcoming album, Friction Baby. Bonnecaze's departure set off a series of lawsuits and counter-suits between Bonnecaze and Better Than Ezra.[6] Bonnecaze, who brought his suit to the United States District Court in New Orleans, argued that the band owed him money "based on his role in fortifying the band's reputation," according to Rolling Stone.[7] He asked for approximately $1 million dollars in damages.[7] A settlement was reached between the band and Bonnecaze on August 5, 1999.[7] The exact terms of the settlement were not released at the time, though Better Than Ezra's manager John Isbell was quoted as saying that Bonnecaze received "way less" than the one million dollars he had originally requested.[7]

Better Than Ezra released their second major label album, Friction, Baby, in 1996 through Elektra Records. Friction, Baby produced the hits "Desperately Wanting" and "King of New Orleans". Their sophomore release was not as commercially successful as Deluxe, but, as of 1999, sold almost 500,000 units.[4]

The trio began work on their third major release, How Does Your Garden Grow?, soon after the end of touring for Friction, Baby. The album was recorded between mid-January and late-April at a studio in New Orleans.[8] The album was produced by record producer Malcolm Burn and released on August 25, 1998.[8] The album was described as "experimental" and a significant departure from their previous two albums.[4] Griffin described the album in 1998 as "guitar driven ... rhythmic."[8] Likewise, Tom Drummond described the band's thinking on its third major album, "We thought the third album was a very important record, because generally a band either makes or breaks on the third record. We wanted it to be a record that didn't necessarily sound like what people expected." [4] Despite the emphasis on guitar experimentation, two tracks, "One More Murder" and "Je ne m'en souviens pas" contain no guitars.[8]

The single "At the Stars" debuted, and peaked, at number 78 on the Billboard Hot 100.[4] The band was dropped by Elektra Records following the release of How Does Your Garden Grow? in 1999.[9]

Subsequent album releases from Better Than Ezra include Closer, (Beyond Records, 2001), Before the Robots, (Artemis Records, 2005) and Paper Empire.

Friction, Baby 1996


Friction, Baby is Better Than Ezra's third album. It was released on August 13, 1996. After this album was released, they took the year off in 1997 after touring.

The album's title comes from a television interview with Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones. When asked how he and Mick Jagger stayed together for so long, Keith took a long drag from his cigarette and said "friction, baby." This may also be a reference to the fact that the band had replaced its original drummer, Cary Bonnecaze, between the recording of their previous album and this one.

The album produced two hits on the Billboard modern rock charts: "King of New Orleans" and "Desperately Wanting." "Desperately Wanting" also narrowly missed the Billboard Top 40, peaking at #48. The third and fourth singles, "Long Lost" and "Normal Town," failed to chart.

How Does Your Garden Grow 1998


How Does Your Garden Grow? is a 1998 album by American alternative rock trio Better Than Ezra. It was the band's fourth album, and their second with drummer Travis Aaron McNabb. It was released on August 25, 1998 by Elektra Records.

The style and content of the album overall is oriented with the night, with the album cover carrying the subtitle "A Series of Nocturnes". Though critically acclaimed, the album was a relative failure commercially, only peaking at #128 on the Billboard charts. The first single, "One More Murder" scraped the bottom end of the Billboard Modern Rock charts, while the second single, "At the Stars," performed better, becoming a Modern Rock and Adult Top 40 hit (and later covered by Howie Day). A third single, "Like it Like That," failed to chart.

"One More Murder" was featured on two NBC dramatic series â€” Homicide: Life on the Street and Third Watch. The song was also featured in an episode of Charmed.

The album's title is most likely derived from the nursery rhyme, "Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary". "Je ne m'en souviens pas", the album's opening track, shares its title with a work by the Spanish surrealist painter Salvador DalÃ­, with lyrical reference to another painting â€” Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa â€” as well as New Orleans' Cabrini High School.

Following the release of How Does Your Garden Grow?, Elektra dropped the band.

Closer 2001


Closer is the fifth studio album by the New Orleans-based rock trio Better Than Ezra. It was released on August 7, 2001 by Beyond Records. Closer initially performed better than its predecessor, How Does Your Garden Grow?, peaking at #110 on the Billboard charts. The first single off the album, "Extra Ordinary," placed on both the Billboard Modern Rock and Adult Top 40 charts (it was the eighth and last BTE single to date to place on the Modern Rock charts). A second single, "Misunderstood," was planned, but Beyond Records declared bankruptcy before it could be released.

As of early 2007, Closer was out of print due to Beyond Records going out of business and copies were scarce, though some werestill in stock in stores. Legal problems resulting from Beyond's bankruptcy meant it would be four years before Better than Ezra's next studio album, Before the Robots. In the meantime, the band would release a live album in 2004, recorded in their hometown at the House of Blues.

In June 2009, the band announced they had acquired the rights to "Closer" and all of the master tracks recorded during the sessions for the album, and would be reissuing it via their own label on CD, The re-release was made available in October 2009 via the band's online store, sporting a bright new red cover, and two bonus tracks, "Simple Song", a long standing fan favorite, and "Screwed Up And Beautiful". Both tracks were recorded during the 2001 sessions for the album but omitted from the final record.

Before The Robots 2005


Before the Robots is the studio follow-up album to Better Than Ezra's 2001 studio release Closer and debut album on Artemis Records. It was released on April 4, 2005, internationally and a day later in North America.

The band enjoyed their biggest success since 1996's Friction, Baby on the reworked single "A Lifetime," which first appeared on 2001's Closer. The tracks "A Southern Thing" and "Our Last Night" also gained some radio airplay. Additionally, the album track "Juicy" was the featured music in promotions for the second season of the ABC series Desperate Housewives.

Prior to the album's release, the band offered to autograph all copies of the album pre-ordered through their website.

The album title reportedly came to the band's drummer Travis McNabb in a dream. He dreamt of seeing a UK buzz band called Before the Robots. The next day, he asked fellow band members if there was such a band. Upon finding out there was not, they decided to adopt the phrase for this album's title.

On January 22, 2010, American country-pop singer Taylor Swift covered "Breathless" at a performance at the Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief event, a charity telethon to benefit the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Swift has also been known to cover "Our Last Night" at many of her concerts.

It is the first album to feature new drummer Michael Jerome following the departure of former drummer Travis McNabb in February 2009 after 13 years with Better Than Ezra.

Better Than Ezra vocalist Kevin Griffin co-wrote nine of the twelve songs on Paper Empire.[1] Griffin co-wrote four songs with songwriter, busbee, who also wrote the Rascal Flatts single, Summer Nights.[1] The track, "Hey Love", was co-written by Griffin and country music songwriter, Monty Powell.[1]

"Absolutely Still", the album's first single, was co-written with Val Emmich, whose version of the song appears on the Emmich's album "Sunlight Searchparty".[1] However, Emmich departed his label, Epic Records, before "Sunlight Searchparty" was released.[1] Griffin decided that "Absolutely Still" had potential and re-recorded it with Better Than Ezra for the album.[1]

"Just One Day" and "Fit" were also co-written with singer-songwriter Jeremy Lister.[1] Lister's versions of the songs appear on his 2007 debut album, Just One Day EP, released by Warner Bros. Records. [1]
