,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-07-23T19:55Z,"Speaking about the Quran, Goethe says, ""It soon attracts, astounds, and in the end enforces our reverence... Its style, in accordance with its contents and aim is stern, grand - ever and always, truly sublime -
So, this book will go on exercising through all ages a most potent influence."""
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-07-23T19:56Z,"""The Koran (Quran) admittedly occupies an important position among the great religious books of the world. Though it is the youngest of the epoch making works belonging to this class of literature, it yields to hardly any in the wonderful effect which it has produced on large masses of men. It has created an all but new phase of human thought and a fresh type of character. It first transformed a number of heterogeneous desert tribes of the Arabian Peninsula into a nation of heroes, and then proceeded to create the vast politico-religious organizations of Muslims world wide which are one of the great forces with which Europe and the East have to reckon with today.""

[G. Maragliouth in his Introduction to J. M. Rodwells - 'The Koran"", New York - 'Everyman's Library, 1977, p VI]"
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-07-23T19:57Z,"""A work, then, which calls forth so powerful and seemingly incompatible emotions even in the distant reader - distant as to time, and still more so as mental development - a work which not only conquers the repugnance which he may begin its perusal, but changes this adverse feeling into astonishment and admiration, such a work must be a wonderful production...
indeed and a problem of the highest interest to every thoughtful observer of the destinies of mankind.""
[Dr Steingass]"
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-07-23T19:58Z,"""It is impossible that Muhammad (peace be upon him) authored the Quran. How could a man, from being illiterate, become the most important author, in terms of literary merits, in the whole of Arabic literature?

How could he then pronounce truths of a scientific nature that no other human-being could possibly have developed at that time, an all this without once making the slightest error in his pronouncement on the subject?""

[Dr. Maurice Bucaille]"
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-07-23T19:59Z,"""Here, therefore, its merits as a literary production should perhaps not be measured by some preconceived maxims of subjective and aesthetic taste, but by the effects which it produced in Muhammad's contemporaries and fellow countrymen.

If it spoke so powerfully and convincingly to the hearts of his hearers as to weld hitherto centrifugal and antagonistic elements into one compact and well organized body, animated by ideas far beyond those which had until now ruled the Arabian mind, then its eloquence was perfect, simply because it created a civilized nation out of savage tribes, and shot a fresh woof into the old warp of history""

[Dr. Steingass]"
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-07-23T20:00Z,"""In making the present attempt to improve on the performance of my predecessors, and to produce something which might be accepted as echoing however faintly the sublime rhetoric of the Arabic Koran, I have been at pain to study the intricate and richly varied rhythms which - apart from the message itself - constitute the Koran's undeniable claim to rank amongst the greatest literary masterpieces of mankind..
This very characteristic feature - 'that inimitable symphony', as the believing Pickthall described his Holy Book, 'the very sounds of which move men to tears and ecstasy' has been almost totally ignored by previous translators; it is therefore not surprising that what they have wrought sounds dull and flat indeed in comparison with the splendidly decorated original..""

[Arthur J. Arberry - ""The Koran Interpreted"", London: Oxford University Press . 1964, p. x.]"
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-07-23T20:00Z,"""A totally objective examination of it [the Quran] in the light of modern knowledge leads us to recognize the agreement between the two, as has been already noted on repeated occasions. It makes us deem it quite unthinkable for a man of Muhammad's time to have been the author of such statements, on account of the state of knowledge in his day. 
Such considerations are part of what gives the Qur'anic Revelation its unique place, and forces the impartial scientist to admit his inability to provide and explanation which calls solely upon materialistic reasoning.""

THE COW: ""And those who do not know said: ""If only God converses/speaks (to) us or a sign/verse/evidence comes to us."" Like that those from before them said alike/similar/equal (to) their saying. Their hearts/minds resembled (each other), We had clarified/explained the signs/verses/evidences to a nation being sure/certain .""
Sure, they just can't prove their imaginary god exists, but still the poor bastards have to submit and obey... to an invisible thing.
HOW VERY BACKWARD !!!!

,ImSoJaded,2011-07-24T09:31Z,"Blindness coming from ramikaz who spams the same shit is not surprising. To all others, this is what you can expect in a country that follows the true faith:
Iranian authorities have approved a law to raise the age at which girls can get married without their parents' consent to 13 from nine (!!!) and for boys to 15 from 14. That bill was vetoed by the Guardian Council, a 12-man body dominated by conservative clerics whose job it is to ensure legislation conforms to Islamic Sharia law (so that true believers may follow Muhammad's example)."

Moslem's usually put up the mask of deceiving to fool the people.Islam is one blood thirsty satanic cult with an unholy book full of satanic verses that can not tolerate the slightest criticism,they threat,bomb and kill whoever dare to speak up against them,bottom line a mafia sort of mentality.

,zalom,2011-10-21T16:28Z,"I always wanted to read the Koran. Not for religious ways, but just to know what I am talking about. 
""all books about god are bullshit"" true but still they are useful as ways to teach about morals and what is good and evil. You don't have to believe in Gods, I am as atheist as can. But I want to know about something before I have my final judgment. Thanks for the upload."

Fuck idiots who can't use common sense and science, because they are too stupid to comprehend reality. It would devastate them to see the truth, they would go crazy. So, they need to believe in a God...they're too afraid of life."
