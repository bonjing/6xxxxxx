Do NOT upload DVD images to the Movies category.
They belong in the Movies DVDR category.
We had to move all of your torrent postings into the correct category."

,washingtonn2004,2011-08-12T04:04Z,"Sorry, it was a problem here. Nothing to do with the torrent itself. I have fixed it already.

By the way, thanks for the movie."
