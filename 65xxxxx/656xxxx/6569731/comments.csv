,zaxotes,2011-07-28T21:59Z,love u! great torrents all the time! will definitely seed!
,kingalienation,2011-07-28T22:25Z,"Thank you sooo much! I love your torrents, I know they are always trustworthy. Haven't had any issues with any of them yet. I just feel bad that I'm unable to seed due to ridiculously slow internet with an upload speed of .38 kB/s. However, I'll be sure to seed as best I can, it won't be of much help though unless I do it for a month straight maybe."

  Please open the .rar file you downloaded using only WinRar, which can be downloaded from www.games4theworld.org . (If you use any other software than WinRar, like WinZip or 7-zip, the files will get messed up!)
When you've opened the file using WinRar, select ĂÂĄll the files in it and drag & drop them to a folder on your Desktop. When the extraction is done, close the .rar file and open the folder on your Desktop. 
Now, start by reading the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"" and you should be able to get the game to work yourself. Good luck!

,kissme_et,2011-07-30T00:52Z,i downloaded it but i use alcohol 52 and everytime i mount iso it doesnt work can you help me
,huldu,2011-07-31T01:12Z,"I respect your work Games4theworld i really do. However i find one thing extremely annoying with your releases: the rar.

Why not just have the .iso and compress that(not like that would be needed). It's too late now anyway. Just annoying to unrar this huge file, install the game and then delete all the files while saving the rar. Frustrating."
,crucify.,2011-07-31T04:18Z,"i tried to run th Sims3SP04 but got an error saying ""This product requires an installed copy of The Sims3. Please install The Sims3 before installing this product."" o.o"
,jbob75,2011-07-31T20:44Z,"@crucify
town life is an expansion set. you need the sims 3 base game installed before using this."
,Kasionz,2011-07-31T21:15Z,@Huldu I much prefer the .rar actually.. if you want an .iso of the [acks go download 'em from someone else!
,myfavoriteaccident,2011-08-04T04:12Z,"Hmmm. So...First of all, thank you. :) Okay, so, I've installed Town Life Stuff, and it's been working fine for a few days. Now, whenever i try to open the launcher, it force closes. I've looked in the forums and I've found nothing, but maybe I'm missing it. Any help or a push in the right direction towards solving this problem would be very much appreciated! "
,Dim.Pand,2011-08-04T08:40Z,hello there. i download it but i can not play it. before i start the set up of this expancion pack i had to update the game.then i set up and then after the update i put the crack.i did this before and everything was fine.do you have another crack fixe?
,AyresUK,2011-08-04T16:04Z,Would This Work On Mac OSX???
,Ragnilde,2011-08-04T18:12Z,Does this work when you have a legal base game?

,dont_wobble,2011-08-07T08:25Z,i have the base game installed but it still says that i need to have sims 3 installed before i can install this.....pls help?
,krazyfeline82,2011-08-07T20:43Z,"Hi,

,ArcadiusOMEN6666,2011-08-27T00:46Z,"@ krisskross1993      no you need a legit copy of the original sims 3 inorder to download  from the sims 3 official site, you must register your copy of the game during sign up... however I found a workaround to this just use a friends account on your computer and pay them back later. it downloads any thing you want to your game thinking its been registered not sure if this works with the expansions or if its been patched but its worth a try"
,ArcadiusOMEN6666,2011-08-27T00:48Z,I should also mention I haven't done this since maybe 3 weeks after the games release.
,ursumium,2011-08-29T06:21Z,"works great thanks!   this being my first sims 3 cracked stuff pack, will i be able to download and install other cracked expansions? or do i need to do something else?"
,katie_xx,2011-09-14T22:30Z,"Kris, use moreawesomethanyou.

The downloads are free there, same ones as on the sims site. 

You won't be able to download any like gothique library as I speak 9/14/2011 until a new cracked patch comes out. Sims 3 hacking is always a few steps behind the sims 3 releases, but you'll be able to get most of them. "
,katie_xx,2011-09-14T22:31Z,"Games4theworld, thanks for your contributions. Your uploads kick ass. 

Xoxo, Katie"
,fabjewlous,2011-10-30T08:20Z,"I only have the base game installed, and it's updated. Then when I install this it says that the sims 3 game needs to be updated. And someone told me before that I should never update the torrented game but it WON'T work unless I do. So I updated and now it says I need to enter a disc. Can anyone help? Or should I just buy the game?"
,Villanietti,2011-11-28T13:13Z,"mmm sorry how can i make this work on mac? I need this one to me the all fix things, a replay would me appreciated thanks!"
,dana149,2012-02-23T14:51Z,this torrent has the installer for mac but it won't open - any thoughts? sims 3 the game is designed to be multi-platform (run on Mac or PC) so this should install on mac. could it be that the installer.app is broken? 
,BriarRosethorn,2012-03-30T20:46Z,"Looks like a good torrent. :) I'm just wondering if the issues with downloading from the Store and updating the game have been fixed by this point, since EA now only applies all patches to the base game instead of the expansions/stuff packs due to all the problems people were having with the patches before that.

I would think that if you have a legal, fully updated copy of The Sims 3, you would still be able to update your game and download Store items even if you have cracked expansions/stuff packs thanks to the updates now only being applied to the base game, but admittedly, I'm no computer genius so I could very well be wrong about this."
,alfred99,2012-05-14T18:13Z,"i downloaded it and when i click the icon the welcome screen opens up with the updates welcome an dplay but when i click play an error box pops up and says ""unable to start game service instalation failure what do i do"
,alfred99,2012-05-14T18:18Z,i downloaded this expansion after i downloaded mastersuites and it downloaded perfect i think and when i click the townlife icon on my desk top it goes to the welcome screen and i click play and then an error box pops up and says unable to start game service failed and everything exits out what do i do?
