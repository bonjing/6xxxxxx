,ergoat,2011-07-23T18:03Z,What's up with all the anonymous and unawarded users posting Real Time?
,sikeorama,2011-07-23T18:26Z,"Kudos, man.  The Scene let us down yet again.  Glad you had our backs."
,sikeorama,2011-07-23T18:51Z,Dick Gillespie is a prick who needs to stop interrupting his fellow panelists.  He won't let others speak.

,metalkiwi,2011-07-24T02:02Z,"Thank you Anonymous for releasing this. As for the scene, WTF?!?! Seriously, where on earth is the 550MB version or HD one? Over here in NZ we don't get any HBO channels (assuming there is more than one channel from HBO) and watching even a normal quality release would be great!"
,BoonesFerry,2011-07-24T04:20Z,I was surprised at the video quality of this file...considering the small file size. Well done. Thank you. 
,suisenbenjo,2011-07-24T04:25Z,Thanks for coming through for us when the scene didn't. Much appreciated.
,adfs8p08,2011-07-24T06:04Z,Nick Gillespie of Reason TV was the only smart person on the panel.
