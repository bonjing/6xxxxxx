MicroProse's RollerCoaster Tycoon is a combination of two somewhat popular PC games: Coaster, an older game from Disney in which you design roller coasters, and Bullfrog's Theme Park, about the trials and tribulations of running an amusement park. Now, Chris Sawyer, the developer behind the very addictive and somewhat zany Transport Tycoon, has developed a brand-new amusement park simulation, with an emphasis on creating funky new roller coasters. Since Theme Park is pretty much the only real competition, RollerCoaster Tycoon has the potential to capture a pretty good niche market - and for the most part, it succeeds.

The premise is pretty simple: You must run a successful amusement park. RollerCoaster Tycoon offers a selection of 21 different scenarios, as well as a tutorial, for building your empire. In actuality, only five of the 21 scenarios are available at start-up - as you complete a portion of the initial scenarios more will become open to you. The scenarios typically involve either open or prebuilt amusement parks, challenging you to accomplish an objective, like achieving a certain attendance or profit goal.
