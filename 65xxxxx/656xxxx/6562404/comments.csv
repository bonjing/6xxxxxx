All basic info regarding what you publish here is missing.
Such as this is a 64bit dotnet executable, requiring a 64bit dotnet-runtime version x and most importantly wtf is the purpose of this ?"

I've been having extreme difficulties with TPB recently. Certain keywords in the description flag the torrent and I get a ban. Had 2 bans lifted already, so I'm being careful.

This is a cleaner for RemoveWAT for Windows 7. The latest edition 2.2.6 has been hi-jacked, and a majority of the copies of it out there contain a keylogger. This cleans the keylogger out of the system and if left to run will continuously check to see if the data/keylogger returns. If it does, you can clear it again while I'll probably be working on a new solution.

.NET 2.0
64 bit intended, I'll check 32 bit now.

I do wish to upload quality torrents, but with TPB giving me such hassle with easy bans and torrent removals makes it excruciatingly difficult to do so. I have somewhere around 10 1080p movies to upload but not when KeyPro is finally starting to kick up."
,YK2011,2011-07-26T15:54Z,"Right, this version of KP is NOT 32 bit capable. I don't have any pirated Win7 x86 PCs to test the app out on, so I will have to take some of my own time out to test RemoveWAT on a 32 bit machine..."

I should also note that I'm not permitted to edit torrents at this time."

leaving it completely off looked more suspicous.

Yes, edit is disabled for all (incl. staff), therefore the upload has to be prepared better - place everything in a notepad text and paste from there when filling in the fields.
Also a good idea to place some info text inside the archive (add to the bugfix list) ;)

Regarding 'RemoveWat' have a read here:

However, I tried to run WAT Cleaner and Daz's latest Loader but it's got my laptop stuck in a recovery loop. I've got a SATA-II - USB2.0 adapter so I can get my stuff no problem, but for the time being, I'm sticking to RemoveWAT and installing latest updates during Seven's setup process."
