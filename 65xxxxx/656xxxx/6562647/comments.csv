,BXM500,2011-09-26T22:37Z,Amazing documentary. Can't wait for the second part!
,treetall,2011-09-28T16:28Z,"Thank you very much... if it weren't for you, I would propably never even know about this documentary. 

Mind blowing... especially ""The Shining"" part."
,davyjones111,2011-12-14T09:27Z,"Kubrick was so far above all else film makers. And its an understatement. He was the only director who had final cut privilege, by contract; some directors says they have final cut, but they dont. He refused to edit Eyes wide shut after showing it to the executives... and died (heart attacked..?) 4 days later(!) Then Warner edited out the 20 or 25+ minutes.

I always felt there was ""Something"" more in The Shinning but i just couldnt point my finger at it. This video is an eyes-opener really.
2001 front projection screen is also quite revealing. 
Thank you for uploading Naba, i like your videos.

Im always amazed that people believe we landed/take off perfetcly 6 times on the moon, with a 64Kbytes onboard computer, while Armstrong crashed the lunar module in testing and could not even land on earth. Simply look at A11 press conference facial expressions...
Btw the recent Jaxa/Selene moon mission taking 3 weeks into lunar orbit instead of the swift nasa Apollo 3 days fiasco."
,KazzaN,2012-02-07T09:13Z,Thanks a lot for this upload. Very interesting!
,rk5711,2012-02-24T20:42Z,LOL. I guess no barrel is ever too deep.
,Resisposse,2012-03-03T18:39Z,"I would be extremely pleased if that very interesting part 2 will be uploaded also here, it's called: Beyond the Infinite - Kubrick's Odyssey II. Thank you very much for uploading this stuff here!!"
,greffvan,2012-03-06T06:45Z,"Yes please upload Part 2 when it becomes available, I've been waiting almost a year for it!"
,Resisposse,2012-04-04T15:04Z,"Part 2's been out 4 3 weeks, if somebody got this from amazon/sacredmysteries, please convert it to avi.file and upload it here. I'll seed it to the max afterwards, off course, would not want anybody to miss this."
,unchallengedor,2012-04-05T08:38Z,DO WANT part 2! somebody out there has it! please?
,username123334,2012-04-06T20:55Z,I had to order part 2. I couldn't find it anywhere online. It was only $20 and I'm sure it'll be worth every penny.
