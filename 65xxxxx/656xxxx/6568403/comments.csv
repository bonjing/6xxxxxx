[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-27T18:06Z,This is driving me nuts - Ive Upd the same torrents a dozen  times and a small fraction have actually posted.
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-07-27T18:10Z,"Yeah, I've uploaded 6-8 torrents too. But, can't seem to find them :-("
[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-27T18:26Z,I have a feeling that as soon as this is fixed about 16 posts of FP Lois 2 are gonna pop up under my name LOL
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-07-27T18:42Z,"Yeah, and another cpl of Wolverine's and Deadpool's are gonna come under mine. The problem is, removing a torrent hasn't been easy."
