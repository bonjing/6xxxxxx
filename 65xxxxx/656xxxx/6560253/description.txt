Pyongyang: A Journey in North Korea
By: Guy Delisle


In 2001, French-Canadian cartoonist Delisle traveled to North Korea on a work 
visa to supervise the animation of a childrens cartoon show for two months. 
While there, he got a rare chance to observe firsthand one of the last remaining 
totalitarian Communist societies. He also got crappy ice cream, a barrage of 
propaganda and a chance to fly paper airplanes out of his 15th-floor hotel 
window. Combining a gift for anecdote and an ear for absurd dialogue, 
His retelling of his adventures makes a gently humorous counterpoint 
to the daily news stories about the axis of evil, a Lost in Translation for 
the Communist world. Delisle shifts between accounts of his work as an animator 
and life as a visitor in a country where all foreigners take up only two floors 
of a 50-story hotel. Delisle s simple but expressive art works well with his 
account, humanizing the few North Koreans he gets to know (including 
"Comrade Guide" and "Comrade Translator"), and facilitating digressions 
into North Korean history and various bizarre happenings involving brandy 
and bear cubs. Pyongyang will appeal to multiple audiences: current events 
buffs, Persepolis fans and those who just love a good yarn.
