Magnus Ramage, Karen Shipp, "Systems Thinkers"

Systems Thinkers presents a biographical history of the field of systems thinking, by examining the life and work of thirty of its major thinkers. It discusses each thinkerâ€™s key contributions, the way this contribution was expressed in practice and the relationship between their life and ideas. This discussion is supported by an extract from the thinkerâ€™s own writing, to give a flavour of their work and to give readers a sense of which thinkers are most relevant to their own interests.

Systems thinking is necessarily interdisciplinary, so that the thinkers selected come from a wide range of areas â€“ biology, management, physiology, anthropology, chemistry, public policy, sociology and environmental studies among others. A significant aim of the book is to broaden and deepen the readerâ€™s interest in systems writers, providing an appetising â€˜tasterâ€™ for each of the 30 thinkers, so that the reader is encouraged to go on to study the published works of the thinkers themselves.
