Either/Or is the name of the third album recorded by American singer-songwriter Elliott Smith. The album was released on Kill Rock Stars on February 25, 1997 on compact disc and vinyl LP.

The title is derived from the SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard book of the same name, reflecting Smith's interest in philosophy, something he studied (among other subjects) at Hampshire College in Massachusetts. Smith stated in a few interviews that the album follows Kierkegaard's philosophy in relation to the absurdist struggle between choosing an aesthetic life and an ethical life. The online magazine pitchfork.com ranked Either/or at #46 (1999) and #59 (2003) on their "Top 100 Albums of the 90s" list. Spin magazine ranked Either/or at #48 on their list of the best albums of the last 25 years. The 1997 "Pazz and Jop" poll saw this album placed at #20 on the list of best albums of the year. Blender put the album at #36 on their list of the "Best Indie Albums Ever".
