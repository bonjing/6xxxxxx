The product is not available from the source as an MP3, because you will not get the full learning experience that was intended if you only listen to the MP3's.  

While the mp3's may save space, if you're not going to learn all that you're supposed to learn from the material, why waste your time and cheat yourself from the learning experience you could have, had you observed the producers note that they only make this available in DVD format and the reasons they provide for this, why download a less than complete educational experience.

If you're not familiar, this producer makes nearly all of their titles in two formats: CD & DVD. They make notes regarding this in their catalog as well, explaining which will be the better learning experience, if there would be a difference. 

For titles where Audio alone will not adequately convey the info, they do not offer it in Audio only format. 

Such is the case with this title... they only offer it in DVD format, as you will not get all the understanding you were intended to receive if you only listen to the audio.
