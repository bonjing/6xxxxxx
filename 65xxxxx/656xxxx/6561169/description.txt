The early career of Amy Winehouse has been marked by critical acclaim and a strong following for her music, but the troubled star has also made headlines for all the wrong reasons. This live concert recording should help fans to forget about the tabloid furor that surrounds Winehouse. The shows includes 17 tracks recorded live in London at the Shepherd's Bush Empire, and finds Winehouse in her element as she performs songs such as "Rehab," "You Know I'm No Good," and "Valerie." Also included is a 50-minute long documentary on the singer which charts her sharp rise to fame.
