Description:

Why should BBC + Prophet Muhammad = controversy?

Of course it shouldn't, but the usual suspects, including

just lately the Iranian culture minister, are already

forewarning trouble - though, predictably, without actually

seeing the film. What seems most worthy of comment is

not that a series on the man who founded Islam is being

broadcast, but rather that it's not been done before.
