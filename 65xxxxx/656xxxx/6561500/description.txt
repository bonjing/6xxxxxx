In 2001, Titiyo revitalised her career with her successful fourth studio album Come Along (released in the US in 2002), spawning the international hit single of the same name. Produced by Peter Svensson (The Cardigans) and Joakim Berg (Kent), the album and its title song made it to the top in the Swedish charts, while the single was a success in several European countries including France, Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. The second single from the album, 1989, was not nearly as successful as its predecessor but reached the top-30 of the French singles chart. (wikipedia)
