All Praise is due to Allaah, we praise Him, and seek His help and
forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allaah, Most High, from the evils of
our own selves and from our wicked deeds. Whomever Allaah
guides cannot be misguided, and whomever He leads astray cannot
be guided. I testify that there is no true God worthy of being
worshipped except Allaah, Alone, without partner or associate. I
further testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger (SAW).
May Allaahâ€™s salaah and salaam also be granted to the Prophetâ€™s
pure family and to all of his noble companions.
