Forced Entry perhaps got its earliest start as early as 1983, when Tony Benjamins and Brad Hull formed a local band called Critical Condition. The band was drumless until 1984, when they hired Colin Mattson. Critical Condition suddenly changed their name to Forced Entry in 1986.

The band first split up around 1992. They temporarily reunited in 1995 to compile the 4-song EP "The Shore", which was recorded in 1990-1991 during "As Above, So Below" sessions. They briefly reunited once again in 2002.
