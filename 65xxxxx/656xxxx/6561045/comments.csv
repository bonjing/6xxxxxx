,itsqashi,2011-08-01T01:19Z,how i can download this file.
,aficion,2011-08-03T22:52Z,"ClassZero, maybe you could answer a question...  People go through the trouble of uploading and providing torrents with no real gain for themselves.  Then a slew of others come along and criticize them for this instead of supporting them (even if they do make a mistake once in awhile).  Without these people we wouldn't be able to download any of this stuff.  Soo.... why do people like you bit the hand that feeds you?  What's with the irrational anger and aggression?  Were you never taught gratitude and understanding?  Are you bitter from a lot of childhood trauma?  Just interested :)"
