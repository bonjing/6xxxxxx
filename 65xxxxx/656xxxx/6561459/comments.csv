Dont listen to all the bulshit!!!
Just Seeeeeeed!!"
,tai69,2011-07-24T22:24Z,"lol @ Blal0ck 

Don't waste your bandwidth with this. The video is obviously a TS and the audio is mono. This isn't even close to a BDRIP. They aren't releasing the DVD and Blueray until Oct 4 but England will be getting it in August 8th. Until then all DVD and BlueRay Rips are fakes and really telesyncs."
,GhostOnes,2011-07-24T22:43Z,Please open up your bandwidth. Seeding is too slow. Thanks.
,4LoKo,2011-07-25T00:11Z,Oh fucking hell I hope this works! I forgot about this movie after it left theaters and now I want to see it for free more than ever!
,4LoKo,2011-07-25T00:14Z,Never mind.. Way to stay at 0.00% for hours going 40kb.. WTF >_>

shared files. as a first timer user (not an abuser lol) You and all the other "
[T],Pongydog,2011-07-25T13:13Z,"Video has been cropped on top and bottom, giving quite a severe final aspect ratio of 2.79:1
(when it should be 2.35:1)

Also the audio is only mono.


It's watchable, but it aint no genuine BDRip."

,L3GiTPro,2011-07-25T19:03Z,"Just for a note.

As the uploader posted in the description is, the reason why there are no hardcoded subs is because he cropped them off.  So you are missing a lot of the film.

If you don't believe me look in the description it says, ""No HARDCODED SUBS[cropped]"""
,csabaxb,2011-07-25T20:28Z,"Strange audio and video,  dark, delete and wait for a better copy, bur to uploader: good job"

,piratepobe,2011-07-26T01:39Z,"the image and sound are off. watchable, but its kinda annoying the shit out of me. def not a blu ray rip."

ROMFLMAO !!!! OMG LOL THX 4 THE LAUGH !!!
( I'm downloading anyway just to check it out. )"
,roxas_nevermore,2011-07-28T10:31Z,The video quality is darker for a brrip or even a dvdrip. The audio is bit too loud and definitely not a dvd/brrip quality. I guess this is a TS/Cam but a very good one. Thanks!
,roxas_nevermore,2011-07-28T10:34Z,"btw, out of curiosity, did you remove the bottom part of the video where a hardcoded korean subs is supposed to be?"

OMG, cropping a KOR HD is NOT a BRRIP.

,scottsasse,2011-08-01T02:36Z,"It's gotta be a pay per view internet rip or something, definitely not Blu-Ray!! And the Korean subs ARE cropped out (read the description). Better to download one with subs and ignore them. No offense but neonrainbow dropped the ball on this one. "
,joejohnson1236,2011-08-01T14:40Z,"I don't mind seeing crap quality movies on TPB, what pisses me off is when green skulls upload mislabeled crap quality movies. neonrainbow -1."
,TheSH3RIFF,2011-08-02T12:44Z,"This is such Bullshit. This ain't a BRRIP. More like a R5 actually. The Quality is very horrible. The Audio 'cracks' like a bag of popcorn. And the video is dark like a TS quality. Very not Enjoyable!

I've downloaded '700mb-BRRIP's before, and they had True Quality. This shit is Fake. I rated down."
,ashen77,2011-08-04T01:58Z,"what, the first three films weren't bad enough? 

Stop complaining about the quality. You cant make a silk purse out of a pigs ear."
,Sharak23,2011-08-04T06:04Z,"Uhh, this is NOT Blu Ray, nor is it DVD, nor is it a DVD Screener, nor is it a TV rip. 

 This is a fucking CAM. Label your torrents right. I already saw the cam and downloaded this wanting to watch the DVD release. "
,lintzpc,2011-10-17T19:40Z,"I downloaded this a while ago, and just got the chance to check it out... I'm pretty sure the cam I had downloaded was better.  I know people have already pointed out that it's NOT a BRRIP, but then there are A/V comments that say 9/9 and 10/10.  You obviously have not watched/listened to a Blu-Ray yet.  This is not even a 9/9 for a DVDRip.  The audio sucks, and the video hurts my eyes.  Sorry, try again."
