Because others say it works fine, should I be concerned about this?"
,MrVostro,2011-08-03T00:47Z,sorry for a bit of duplicate info.
,WolfPunk,2011-08-14T04:34Z,"@MrVostro.  No you should not be concerned.  But Norton and other Reputation-based antivirus
should be turned off when launching ChattChitto's releases.

Obviously only a small specialized community uses these fine 'kits', but Reputation is based on numbers.  So fuck them...  This software is Packaged inside an .exe file that is not widely used.  If you use NIS just disable antivirus for 15 minutes, not the firewall, at launch."

,johnydecali,2011-09-07T08:11Z,Uploaded with ease and works great! Thanks!!
,efeffess,2011-09-12T12:01Z,"Good upload. Unfortunately, ChattChitto, it is unclear as to why you would not only include and autoplay a tune that is unlikely to be enjoyed by most, but also password protect the archive. The password was easily cracked, mind you."
,justmealwatts,2011-09-20T00:59Z,"Thank you for this torrent. I've been using Power ISO exclusively for a while. This torrent works perfect and as for the autoplay music, I do sound for a living and I have an appreciation for your choice."
