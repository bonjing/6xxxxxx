I have a ratio of 3.317 on this now and i'm fed up of waiting i'm 94% done and getting shitty speeds, So if I get this I'll seed for a while at a good speed that you people who are now downloading from me will get it nice and quick but you have to seed!....... If we don't seed what we get then the idea of torrents are total crap!"
