When a 12-year-old Palestinian boy was killed in the West Bank city of Jenin by Israeli soldiers who mistook his toy gun for the real thing, it could have been just one more blip on the news: one more war, one more child, one more human tragedy that ripped the heart out of a family and a community, but rippled no further into the world├óΓé¼Γäós consciousness.

But something extraordinary happened that turned Ahmed Khatib├óΓé¼Γäós tragic 2005 death into a gift of hope for six Israelis whose lives were on the line: while overwhelmed with grief, Ahmed├óΓé¼Γäós parents consented to donating their son├óΓé¼Γäós organs. Suddenly, amid the violence and entrenched hatred surrounding an intractable conflict, a simple act of humanity rose above the clamor and captured worldwide attention.

Heart of Jenin tells the story of Ahmed├óΓé¼Γäós tragic death and his father Ismael Khatib├óΓé¼Γäós journey to visit three of the organ recipients two years later. One of Ahmed├óΓé¼Γäós kidneys went to an Orthodox Jewish girl and his other kidney went to a Bedouin boy. While his parents hesitated to donate Ahmed├óΓé¼Γäós heart, it now beats in the chest of a Druze girl.

├óΓé¼┼ôI see my son in these children,├óΓé¼┬¥ Khatib says.

Crossing from northern Israel to the Negev desert and ending up in Jerusalem, Khatib encounters every complexity of the conflict: deep-seated animosity, hardened judgments, and heartfelt generosity. While laying bare the deep divisions between Israelis and Palestinians, Heart of Jenin offers a rare vision of common humanity and hope.
