The Mystery of the Nevada Triangle (Ch4)

History Documentary hosted by Mark Strong, published by Channel 4 in 2010 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

In September 2007 Sir Richard Branson's friend, the record-breaking aviator Steve Fossett, disappeared on a pleasure flight. There were rumours that Fossett, who had made the first solo balloon flight around the world, was in Argentina or that he had faked his death. His loss sparked the biggest peacetime search-and-rescue operation in the history of the United States. Over the ensuing weeks, reports surfaced of hundreds - even thousands - of missing aircraft in a triangular area of the Sierra Nevada Mountains that ranges from some of the highest peaks to the lowest point - Death Valley - in the USA.
