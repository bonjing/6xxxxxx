,st33ly,2011-09-09T15:05Z,"You dont need a product key for this game.
Download the FSX Acceleration iso. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5008336.

Install it.

""you will get more planes and missions + SP1/2 is in it,  its a good addon""

In the ios file there is a folder called crack with 3 files in it. select them all and right click, and click on (COPY). Then go to: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight simulator x\ or where ever you have installed FSX in your program files and (PASTE) the files into that folder.
It will ask it you what to replace the files just click yes for them all. 

ALL DONE. start FSX"

some people sayabout other torrents only ""installs and runs well"" and no more- but they lie. the less details someone tells, the more likely he lies."

,kdon27,2012-05-30T13:00Z,FATAL ERROR DURING INSTALLATION >>SOLUTION
,kdon27,2012-05-30T13:01Z,"Fatal error with install?? Here's solution: Run msconfig. Go to the BOOT.INI tab. Click on Advanced Options. Check the box for MAXMEM. After you check MAXMEM, a window to the Left of MAXMEM will show a value, change that value to 1024. and click OK. Click OK on the bottom of the System Configuration window. You will have to reboot your computer. Try to re-install the game when the computer re-starts, you should have no problem. After the game installs, run msconfig again. Go back to the BOOT.INI tab, click Advanced Options again, and un-check the MAXMEM box. Click OK, then Apply. You will have to re-boot again."
