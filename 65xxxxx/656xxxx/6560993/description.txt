The Problem Solverz (originally titled Neon Knome) is an American animated television series created by Ben Jones, a member of the art collective Paper Rad, for Cartoon Network. The series centers on the titular Problem Solverz trio of Alfe, Roba, and Horace, as they solve and sometimes create the various problems that plague their town. After the original pilot Neon Knome was rejected by Cartoon Network's late-night programming block Adult Swim, it was picked up and re-tooled by the main network, which premiered the series on April 4, 2011.
