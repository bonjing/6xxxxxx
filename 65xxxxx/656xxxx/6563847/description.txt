Crossbow (1987) Episode 101: The Banquet (30 Aug 1987)

"Crossbow" is the story of William Tell, the 14th Century Swiss freedom fighter, a former mercenary soldier who had disavowed violence, become a blacksmith and raised a family.  Until Gessler, the cruel Austrian governor, with his force of occupying foreign troops, forced Tell to shoot an apple off his son's head.  After this, he became Gessler's implacable enemy, fighting a guerrilla war for 78 half-hour episodes of exciting adventures.  Filmed in France at authentic locations from the medieval era.

In this first episode, Tell is arrested after failing to bow before Gessler's hat, and is presented as entertainment at a banquet, where he is forced to shoot an apple off his son's head.

I produced this version by combining video from the French DVD release with audio from a VHS recording of the U.S. TV broadcast.
