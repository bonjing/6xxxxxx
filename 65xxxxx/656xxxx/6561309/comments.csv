,duranachampion,2011-07-24T18:05Z,"mkvgod
you are too good and thanks for your wonderful work. However you have not yet done two classic shows 1. Friends 2. Sopranos.
Can you do these? Also please dont compress these classics too much so that quality is not compromised too much! Thanks for your efforts once again."

,Gonewalkabout,2011-11-24T06:13Z,"Well Kokua651 never did leave a comment about the quality so I will be tautly honest and say sorry but not very good.
The compression was pushed just too far.
Pixilated and smoothed out so much it wasnâ€™t the quality you would expect from a 720p.
10 hours of HD video compressed to just 3.65 GB is asking a lot, even for the MKV format.
Having said that, for all of you with smaller HD setups or just wont to view it once, this is a great TV show â€˜a must seeâ€™.
But if youâ€™ve got something bigger like a 42â€ plasma then you might wonâ€™t to give up a little bit more of your hard drive.
With all respect to mkvGOD for all the uploads he giveâ€™th to us, AaMEN."
