[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-24T19:29Z,"Did you guys watch CBR's interview with Todd McFarlane about DC52, Digital DL's and Pirating - It was amazing. Everything he says makes me wish he was in charge of DC."
,ThankMM82,2011-07-24T21:47Z,"Thanks MM82.  Stellar comics as usual.

@MrDowntown -  That sounds really interesting, you have a link to that interview?"

And though he tends to go out in left field on some issues, he's dead on about DC's initiative."
,ThankMM82,2011-07-25T00:04Z,"Wow, great stuff.  Thanks for sharing, I only read comicvine for my comic news so I never would of seen that.  Haven't thought of his point about the new 52 before..  For the hardcore consumer I think it's cool because of all the new books and new stories, but yeah, for the casual consumer they are trying to attract I don't see it maintaining interest."
