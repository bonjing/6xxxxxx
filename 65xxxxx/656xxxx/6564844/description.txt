Despite popular misconception, illegal drugs do not have to be part of a bodybuilderâ€™s training regimen. NATURAL BODYBUILDING & FITNESS proves that drug-free doesnâ€™t mean second best. It is the voice of the drug-free fitness lifestyle, and is the first and ONLY magazine devoted to natural bodybuilders, weight lifters and iron-pumping muscle enthusiasts. Publication dates: February, May, August and November (all issues include BEST BODY MAGAZINEâ€“our special womenâ€™s fitness insert mini-magazine).
