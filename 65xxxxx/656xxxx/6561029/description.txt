Unity: Custom 3rd-Person Character and Camera System with C#

Looking to create your own 3rd-person game? One of the first things youâ€™re going to need is a solid character handling system. 3D Buzz makes that easy with our 3rd-Person Character System with C# videos. We take you through the entire creation of a customized character and camera setup. We show how to deal with camera orbiting, how to prevent the character from being occluded from the player, and how to establish an intelligent collision system with the camera to prevent scene clipping.

We start very simply, just by setting up our basic demo level. Once thatâ€™s finished, we create a very basic version of our character and camera setup, keeping things very basic. Next, we add in our occlusion and collision system to give the camera a much more sophisticated feel. Finally, we show how you can add in a custom character from Maya, complete with multiple animations.

These videos are completely free to download and stream from 3D Buzz. Below you will find links to each file, both to a direct download and into our public streaming system. Please be aware that in order to stream the videos, you will need to be logged into 3dbuzz.com. You will also need to have the most recent Flash player installed.

Note: These videos are free to download and watch. However, we do not offer the source code in text form. The code in its entirety is presented in the videos. Also, the FBX files for the demo level and for the character are not made freely available to the public, but are available to 3D Buzz Member Sponsor subscribers
