,asc11,2011-07-30T21:58Z,"Since this is your first torrent, is it possible that you are not doing what is required to make it successful?

Do you understand that you have to use a torrent program such as uTorrent, add your own torrent to its list, set the ""download location"" to the directory where the files to be shared are, and let uTorrent (or whatever your torrent program is) upload the files to other computers?

If you are having problems, please look for help at forum.suprbay.org ."
