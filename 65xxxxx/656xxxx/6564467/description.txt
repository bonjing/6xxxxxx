After the death of her father, sexy Honey West took over his
high-tech private detective firm. As tv's first title role female
Private Eye, Honey West would take on any tough case. She could
handle herself mingling with millionaires just as well as scaling
a thirty foot wall. Along with rugged Sam Bolt and her pet ocelot
Bruce, Honey West was sure to solve the case.

This short-lived series made television history by casting Anne
Francis as the first-ever woman lead private eye.
