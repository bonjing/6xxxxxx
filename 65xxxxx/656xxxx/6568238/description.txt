        If you thought puberty was hard, wait until you hit 40!

        A hilarious and heart warming coming of middle age comedy that
        follows the journey  of three normal  women who would  happily
        enjoy their forties, if only Mother Nature wasn't so cruel!

        Globe-trotting Christine  wakes up  one ordinary  day to  find
        that her biological clock has  gone off with a vengeance.  But
        for a commitment-phobe  on the wrong  side of 40,  the road to
        motherhood  is strewn  with bedlam,  calamity and  smoked out
        eggs. When she turns to her life long friends Margo and  Mikki
        for support, she finds them equally embattled; Margo zealously
        guarding  the door  to her  recently emptied  nest, and  Mikki
        frantically fighting her evil twin foes; Sagging and Drooping.

        Collectively, however, the  girls are a  farce to be  reckoned
        with, so together they take on the might of Mother Nature with
        hilarious results.
