Richard Hammond's Journey to the Centre of the Planet
Using state of the art technology, Richard Hammond's Journey to the Centre of the Planet lifts the lid on planet Earth, peeling back its layers to reveal a hugely complex machine unique in our solar system. At first glance, the surface of our planet appears solid and unchanging - but every day there are at least fifty big earthquakes and twelve powerful volcanic eruptions. Using the latest scientific information, we see what's happening beneath our feet and beneath the oceans in a way never seen before.

Along his journey, Richard takes the plunge in Iceland, travels into the abyss off the coast of California and sets eyes on bioluminescent deep sea creatures in the depths of


1)  The Centre of the Planet 
How does the Earth work? Richard Hammond goes to go to the centre of the planet to find out. Using a giant 3D virtual Earth, Richard peels back the layers and shows where volcanoes come from, why earthquakes happen and even where to find diamonds. Using stunning CGI, the latest satellite imagery and beautiful locations around the world, the story of how the Earth works has never been seen like this before. And in Richard Hammond's hands it is a story that has never told like this either!

2)  The Bottom of the Ocean 
What lies at the bottom of the oceans? What would happen if the planet lost its oceans? Richard Hammond is going to drain the oceans to find out. Hidden beneath all that water are some of the biggest natural formations on earth: The longest mountain ranges, the tallest volcanoes and the deepest canyons. Richard can reveal all this and more in a way never seen before, because he has the ultimate toy - a vast working 3D virtual Earth in a hangar.
