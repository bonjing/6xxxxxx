""WTV H.264 to TS Converter"" or ""WTV H.264 to MPEG Converter""

They require the standard activation of a name and serial number.

They can be found here -

Windows Media Center recordings are almost useless to me without converting, and those converters are the fastest by several magnitudes.

Many, many thank you's in advance."
