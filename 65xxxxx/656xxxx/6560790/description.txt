Virgin Blue, the fastest growing airline down under, started service on August 31, 2000, with a fleet of Boeing 737-400s. The company was the most successful startup airline in aviation history with a load factor of 78% after just 100 days of operations! Today the airline has 20 Boeing 737-700s and 4 Boeing 737-800s which are being delivered making its fleet one of the most modern in the world.


The program takes you on some of its major routes from Brisbane to Melbourne, to Sydney as well as to the Gold Coast and Tasmania and continues to expand with new destinations all the time.

Virgin Blue also plans routes to international destinations. Also included on the dvd is an interview with the Director of Flight Operations.
