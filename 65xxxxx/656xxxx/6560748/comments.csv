A waste of space, will not be missed."
[T],insinuendo,2011-07-23T22:27Z,Go fuck yourself :)
[T],Spikkie,2011-07-23T22:33Z,"Rest In Peace Little Poor Girl !
Your music will stay in my mind and heart forever!"

,CabosJohn,2011-07-24T01:24Z,"When Janis Joplin died people used to call her parents' home just to laugh into the phone - you know, that she had gotten what she deserved. Guess you were still alive back then grandpa. What sick MFs there are in this world to hold so little in their hearts - how could they ever even listen to music and actually feel what it's about?"
,g8aso,2011-07-24T07:52Z,"Just tried that, but I couldn't get round to it, thanks for the suggestion though......."
,Kadoma,2011-07-24T12:54Z,"Hey g8aso, who the fuck are you to be calling anyone a ""waste of space""? If you're even half as talented as Amy was, then post some links to whatever it may be that you've produced. Otherwise, as it has already been said, Go fuck yourself :) "
[T],insinuendo,2011-07-24T13:17Z,"You see...the pathetic thing about idiots like g8aso is that they simply want to piss people off. They leave rude and pointless comments and then come back to check if they got some form of response...

I think everyone here will agree...YOU'RE the waste of space."
,ljbew,2011-07-24T15:45Z,"HEY g8aso GO TRY THIS IT WILL WORK PUT GUN TO HEAD THEN PULL TRIGGER. 
RIP Amy #27Club
 ""    g8aso go to hell "
,KiwiR,2011-07-24T18:37Z,sorry to interrupt the murder of the idiot child... (g8aso)! and this is a noobish question.. but what am I supposed to do with a .flac file? can i just put it on itunes? or do I need to convert it?
,recorps1,2011-07-25T07:17Z,"@KiwiR you need to convert it to apple lossless codec for itunes play ability. 
as for this torrent, if you really like her music, buy it and show a little respect. after all, even thoguh she's dead, she sill makes money"
,KimSaysHi,2011-07-25T07:26Z,"@ g8aso - Uh, wow. Yes, Amy was incredibly talented, yes she was an alcoholic and a drug addict. No need to say she was a 'waste of space / will not be missed' because she will. But whatever, her music is still amazing. GTFO."
,tonyromano777,2011-07-25T09:25Z,"Thx for the FLAC bro ;-)

 I see some criticism here about her that suggests because someone has drug and/or alcohol problems that this somehow relegates their creativity to something like fraud.
 You have lived a sheltered life me thinks."
,P.O.N.,2011-07-25T20:33Z,"I don't know, these albums sound awful, worst than the original non-deluxe edition. And the spectrogram didn't look great."
,dove91,2011-07-25T21:44Z,thanks insinuendo not just for the cd but the tribute 
[T],insinuendo,2011-07-25T23:35Z,"FYI: Both albums got an Iron Waffle at Waffles.fm
"
,cyberstar,2011-07-26T00:42Z,"Without the addictions and the troubles in her life she wouldn't be ""Winehouse"". All the emotions and depression served as a fuel to her inspiration.
The sad part is that she lost her life for it, so her emotions were a curse just as they were a blessing.
She lost her life so we can listen to her magic music, for that she will always have my respect."
,Kadoma,2011-07-26T02:00Z,"@KiwiR You have to convert FLAC to Apple lossless (or MP3, but that's a waste), or install FLUKE if you are using MAC which runs in the background and allows you to import FLAC's. Conversion is better (FLUKE crashes for me at times or has drop outs). I use a free program called MAX which is Mac only, http://sbooth.org/Max/"
,pelayuscl,2011-07-26T02:38Z,GRACIAS...
,ccp041985,2011-07-26T14:00Z,"in fairness amy was a waste of space. a walking, talking singing advert for reasons not to do drugs.her death does not change the attitude she had.However she was an amazing tallent when on form and to say she won't be missed is just stupid.everybody makes mistakes and she is paying for hers now."
,mickeyknoxxx,2011-08-10T08:08Z,"they told her to go to rehab, she said ""no, no, no..."""
,fasteddie001,2011-08-11T07:49Z,"Why is this woman so popular? Can't sing, gurgles when lost for a tune. Can't write on her own. 
I guess it must be ""sick puppy' syndrome. Die young or suffer at your own hands and become a star! WTF, stick with the crack baby and sell some records..."
,fasteddie001,2011-09-07T10:13Z,"What is it with Amy? Couldn't write without help. Her performances (except when on form WTF does that mean) were train wrecks. Voice, well... interesting if you like weird but otherwise just plain unintelligible. Though she sold a fair few albums she was nowhere near as popular as people here are pretending. I enjoyed her backup band, they were fine musicians, a saving grace perhaps? AND STILL they download, if so popular, why so few have an official copy?"
,ZUKTOR,2011-10-10T19:02Z,Seed until ur ass bleeds if u liked Amy.
,F8AL1,2011-11-27T18:20Z,Hahaha i just saw her special guest appearance in heaven on tosh.o lol
,Wilkins_Micawber,2012-01-02T03:12Z,"Lady Gaga died? I didn't know 
"
,Poseidon_M_Hernandez,2012-01-15T22:09Z,"Of course, she dies and suddenly becomes the greatest thing since the invention of the wheel. Fuck all the assholes who criticized her every move and gossiped all kinds of trash about Amy Winehouse when she was alive. Thanks for your incredible voice, rest in peace."
