First talk about this movie, at-least say thanks to uploader.

Then demand for other movies.

,H0llyw00d7,2011-08-08T21:13Z,"Hi Can someone give me a bit of advise as new to this site. I've downloaded a few YIFY movies and can't fault them apart from the horrible subtitles. It says ""built in subs"". Is there anyway that i can download the movie without these? If not, is there a way i can check to see if they've got subs before i download? Is there a reason why YIFY has used subs - can't understand why as they spoil the movie. Any help - blonde, female in distress! "
,albokid89,2011-08-14T22:21Z,Its like all the blade movies in one!!! awesome mate +1
,azmoth2,2011-08-19T19:06Z,"Okay Hollywood blonde, most of Jify films thouh described as mp4 are in mkv container which can contain any amount of junk or useful junk like subs. Merely use  Yamb(google it) and extract files, unticking subs after adding to place files(v ideo and audio, both these will show as separate options, and reform into a mp4 container which will then play on TV via a usb flash disc if TV  has this extra port eg Philips TV.

I dont prefer mkv as a container as it has little compatibility at the moment with most hardware etc and if you play it on pc it sometimes feezes due to audio delay in container like in PowerDVD, if so use Media Player Classic which handles everything well. H264 with mp4 as container is the way to go! "
,spiker_03,2011-08-27T11:06Z,good upload thank you.. OK movie
