There has been a flood of anti piracy pricks on all torrent/P2P etc sites recently. With the lawsuit against newzbin there will be more of this coming and a possibility that more sites will befall the same fate.

This is a small list of those that are more than likeley hired by large corporations (sony etc) to ""discourage"" you from downloading illegally kietio136, leevea32, qauwua188. But this guy ""niiwea74"" takes the biscuit. Apparently scenebalance has never posted anything before??? Nor is the account a trusted one??? I quote
""weird, searching on google gives a whole bunch of posts with this same name on all kinds of torrent sites but not much else while searching imdb gets no results at all so it aint a new movie. wonder what it's meant to be, i'll certainly be curious to take a look once a trusted or vip account uploads it but i aint risking an uploader whos never posted anything before, :/""
Not only are there no REAL copys of this film out lol but the film doesn't exist LMFAO (see above quote)
So to all those wondering if this is real. YES. YES. YES. YES. ITS FUCKING REAL. IT EXISTS! lol. might not be the best quality but it fucking exists and is real. So FUCK all you FAKE BITCHES that have claimed and will claim that it is not.
P.s. The same copy and pasted comments can be found on most of the trusted uploaders files now and will spread to others. For all those that don't know a skull means its GOOD to download 99.99999999999999999999999999999% of the time. They do fuck up you know. No one is perfect. 
SHIT! I just copy and pasted. I must be working for them :P lol"

Very well said. Have noticed the little twats posting comments on trusted uploaders files, but I tend to ignore them if I know the uploader. These people can try to rubbish others names, but those that know will just ignore the idiotic comments."
