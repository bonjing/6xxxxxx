Cristolize was a band I formed back in the early 80's that has been very successful throughout the years and has taken many different roads. We've had the pleasure of playing many bars, weddings, private parties, Laconia biker weekend, etc. But with that said and done I have returned to playing solo for awhile and reconnect with my roots you tend to get a little lost now and then. All songs written and composed by Cristolize/ Rock On
