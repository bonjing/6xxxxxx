title: Megiddo - The March to Armageddon

description: Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin - all three were masons. The French revolution was the outcome of a luciferian masonic conspiracy that had been set up to get rid of a benign French king who believed in GOD. You better wake up now and repent your sins for GOD is very real. If you don't believe in GOD then you're either a demon or a victim of illuminati mind-control. Satan knows that GOD is real but he hates GOD and therefore wants to destroy your faith in GOD. This highly interesting documentary outlines the profound influence of masonry and illuminism over the evolution of human history, and it explains in detail the predictions of biblical prophecies and how many of them already have come true. If you don't know your history then you're cursed to repeat it. And true prophecies are the history of your future. Many masons are good people who have been lured first into deism, then atheism and finally satanism by their occult indoctrination. "The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy." "Turn ye, turn back from your evil ways." "What shall the end be of them that do not obey the gospel of GOD?"
