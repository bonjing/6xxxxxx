What do you mean?"
,irighterotica,2011-08-21T01:23Z,"He means just about every song is about a minute or 2 short. 

Aside from that, there's nothing wrong with the package."
,Nicky.g.5864,2011-09-04T07:26Z,ya it was the same way for a few other gorillaz discographys  the songs are always to short and there is no intro
,syadle,2011-12-02T11:16Z,Great torrent!
,Yaschiri,2012-05-06T02:43Z,"Great quality. The only issue is that the songs seem to have time cut out of the ends of them, making them shorter and also that the entire Demon Days album sounds like it's in a slightly higher pitch. I listened through a few of the songs on that album and then through some of the others, and there is a clear difference. And what's even more strange is that it's only on the Demon Days album. The rest seem to be fine.

Otherwise great download. Thanks. :3"
