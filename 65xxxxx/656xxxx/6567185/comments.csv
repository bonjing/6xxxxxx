,CHEFPUGSLY,2011-07-31T14:11Z,"yeah i know that should have been ""hear"""
,mrsjab,2011-08-01T13:49Z,"Subtitles are a fabulous way to watch the show and not wake the person sleeping next to you.  If you're a fast reader, you can turn the sound down to single digits and still hear/understand the actors because the subtitles remove all doubt as to what was said.

Often, too, subtitles have something akin to an archeological significance.  They're usually done off the script, rather than the filmed show, so occasionally you get to see where the actors-ad libbed or last-minute line changes were made.  Most screenwriters I know prefer to use subs."
