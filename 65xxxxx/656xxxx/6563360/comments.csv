,usghkh,2011-07-25T16:06Z,"excellent series & rip
what a shame, they dropped it"
,pjsmoke,2011-07-26T10:46Z,Thankee for the re-up of 107 Janynestown...
,kalbloke,2011-09-14T06:37Z,"mkvGOD Thanks for the series.
Unfortunately the  subs are of 0 kb =blanks 
Another, bigger, problem is that the Episode numbers need correcting.
All 14 are here in the usual high performance of mkvGOD, just that they need to be re-numbered.
The Titles of the episodes are all correct. So change just the Episode NUMBERS.
1=11
2=01
3=02
4=06
5=07
6=03
7=04
8=05
9=08
10=09
11=13
12=14
13=10
For a full set of the subs go to TVsubtitles.net
They are with correct Episode nos. 
So remember to first correct the Video numbering.
Cheers."
,kalbloke,2011-09-14T06:44Z,"IN ADDITION and correction to the Episode conversion nos
13=12
14=10
Cheers"

On the net a different sequence is around. Probably the BR or DVD is different."

,suresh999,2012-01-22T09:14Z,Thnq very much fr dis.. :)
,MyFootHurts,2012-03-01T13:51Z,"Why do uploaders take so much time and effort to get good quality in small sizes and then say ""Use VLC Media Player to view""? Seems like such a waste, if you're going to suggest a playback method don't suggest something that plays back at lower quality."
,Flaser,2012-04-19T23:23Z,"Frankly, I don't see the point of releases like this. The source has been compressed so much, it's no better than a DVD Rip.

At this point, image quality would actually go *up* if the video stream was downscaled to fit the bitrate."
,bktheman,2012-05-05T18:54Z,"DUHH u GOT COMPLAINS?
