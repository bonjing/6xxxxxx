Note: I am obviously not Anders. Nor do i wish to be him. I am simply making this killer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"book\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" more accessible for those who cant open .pdf files. 
In no way do i condone and agree with the killers ideas. 
I claim no ownership of any content.


The .txt file does not contain any pictures. The .doc and .docx have the pictures.

Note of distribution from Anders himself.

EDIT: added .xps format.


Distribution of the book
The content of the compendium truly belongs to everyone and is free to be distributed in
any way or form. In fact, I ask only one favour of you; I ask that you distribute this book
to everyone you know. Please do not think that others will take care of it. Sorry to be
blunt, but it does not work out that way. If we, the Western European Resistance, fail or
become apathetic, then Western Europe will fall, and your freedom and our children
freedom with itÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Âª It is essential and very important that everyone is at least presented
with the truth before our systems come crashing down within 2 to 7 decades. So again, I
humbly ask you to re-distribute the book to as many patriotic minded individuals as you
can. I am 100% certain that the distribution of this compendium to a large portion of
European patriots will contribute to ensure our victory in the end. Because within these
three books lies the tools required to win the ongoing Western European cultural war.
As already mentioned; the compendium is a compilation of works from multiple
courageous individuals throughout the world. I have spent more than three years writing
and/or compiling most of the content. None of the other authors have been asked to
participate in this project due to practical and security reasons but most of them have
made their material available for distribution. The needs of the many outweigh the needs
of the few. This is the reason why I have decided to allow the content of this
compendium to be freely redistributed and translated. Consider it my personal gift and
contribution to all Europeans. The sources are not embedded into the document for this
reason (easier to use and distribute the various articles). However, it is required that the
author(s) are credited when the material is used.
As such, the intellectual property of this compendium belongs to all Europeans across the
European world and can be distributed and translated without limitations. Efficient
distribution and circulation will be possible if those who agree with at least some of its
content, principles or ideas contribute to spread the information. If you are reading this
you will know that many people will be interested in obtaining the compendium (3
books). LetÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s use this momentum to our advantage as it will surely benefit our struggle.
IÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³m depending on you to distribute the book or some/all of its content to as many
patriotic European political activists as possible. Let them know what is going on and
what is required of each and every one of us. After all, we do not only have a right to
resist the current development, it is our duty as Europeans to prevent the annihilation of
our identities, our cultures and traditions and our nation states! Please contribute to
distribute the compendium to as many patriotic minded Europeans as humanly possible
in all 26 European countries. This is only be the beginningÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Âª!
By including the Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¼Ã´legal disclaimerÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¬Â¥ in Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¬Â¥Book 3; Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¬Â¥ will allow everyone to distribute the
content without violating any European laws. If you are still in doubt feel free to delete or
change the wording in certain chapters before distribution.
Please help to make this book available through various torrents, blogs, websites, on
Facebook, on Twitter, on forums and through other arenas. It is truly a one-of-a-kind,
unique and great tool that can and should be used by all cultural conservatives in the
decades to come.
