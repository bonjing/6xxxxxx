But to link these secret societies to that disturbed idiot in Norway is nothing but utter BS. 
But then again, you know that already, don't you?"
,tuvokk,2011-07-29T04:22Z,Now that quote about the templars (from InfiniteIndefinite) definitely sounds not bad.
,sampiero,2011-07-29T14:59Z,Many thanks.
