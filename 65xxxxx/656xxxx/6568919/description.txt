The Knights Templar & Secret Societies â€“ A Collection:


The news in the past week was dominated by the murderous crimes in Norway committed by Anders Behring Breivik â€“ a delusional fanatic who proclaims himself a â€œKnight Templarâ€, with a mission to save Norway and Europe from â€œMuslim domination.â€

The Knights Templar were the advance force in the armies of the Crusades â€“ a bloody endeavor in the history of Christianity that left trails of genocide and destruction, and resulted in the merciless killing of tens of thousands of innocent non-combatant Muslims, Jews, and even Christians (e.g. in Constantinople.)

What happened last week is just another reminder that the Crusades that started in the 11th century really did not cease, and it has been going on till now and will continue into the foreseeable future. The Templars are also active in the 21st century, often under different names and labels and within secret societies.
