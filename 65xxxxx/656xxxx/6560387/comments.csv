,Uriz3n,2011-07-24T07:40Z,"Thanks a lot. But Issues 6 and 7 are ZIP archives, meaning they should end in "".cbZ"" not "".cbR"". The way they are now, you can't open them with CDisplay.
For all having that problem (""Access Violation""-Something in CDisplay), simply rename the files to end in "".cbZ"", like ""Haunt 06.cbZ"" and ""Haunt 07.cbZ"".

Cheers"
