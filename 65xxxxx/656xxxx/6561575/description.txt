another fresh new build of vlc player 1.1.11 from today : July 24
despite final release of this version,branch developer team still continue to update this last one day after day.
Therefore this is a post update build from final version as very newest release anyway,indeed !
delivered as untouched for internal testing purpose...
i dunno why this version still continue to be updated as well as i cannot let you know its full changelog.
sorry again so.
Still as beta again so might be a little bit buggy again also.
normaly branch build is the best beta stable release of the day.
Note : to ATI/AMD users
the very latest catalyst 11.6b should normaly resolve the well known bug on vlc
player 1.1.10 and recent builds as well
i suggest you all to update to this very latest driver so.
Note :
how to install sucessfully this version of vlc :
at first,uninstall any previous version and completely delete your own settings and cache folder as well.
secondary : when you will install any new version,then proceed by the same way also :
delete all personal settings and cache folder and check while installing new version if you get a crash with cache-gen.exe
sometimes,this last one can completely crash.
This problem is normaly completely resolved anyway.
However,if you get any problem,please,post here and i will try to help you so.
Btw,update checking option does not work anymore with this kind of vlc's version
that's why i bring you every 7 days,a new build from so.
seed with me asap to the others,please,just for a moment or more.
ty for understanding
enjoy and have fun
regards
