The wall paintings of the Kassenas women in Burkina Faso, near the border with Ghana, are famous for the beauty of their patterns and the harmony of their colours. In looking at this subject, Katy Lena Ndiaye has chosen to compare and contrast tradition with modernity, seen through the intertwined portraits of three old women and their â€œgrand-daughterâ€, whom they are initiating in their ancestral art. She has made a film whose aesthetic is fully under control, a genuine portrait of an artistic community preoccupied with the issue of how to hand down traditions, of education and memory in an Africa undergoing fundamental change.
