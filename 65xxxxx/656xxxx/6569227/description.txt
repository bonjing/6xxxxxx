Product Description: The perfect sweet (or savory) for any occasion

Filled with seasonal fruit, piled high with billowy meringue, or topped with buttery streusel, pies and tarts are comforting and foolproof. In Martha Stewartâ€™s New Pies and Tarts, the editors of Martha Stewart Living include 150 recipes: Some are savory, some are sweet; some are simple enough for a weeknight, while others are fancy enough for special events. Throughout, readers will find plenty of fillings and crusts, basics, and techniques for creating flavors and textures for every tasteâ€”from down-home classics that come together easily with fresh berries and stone fruits to modern tarts layered with chocolate ganache or finished with a wine glaze. There are also individual hand pies, savory comforts like quiche and potpie, holiday-worthy desserts for nearly every  occasion, and much more.

Chapters feature pies and tarts for everyone: Classic (Lattice-Top Blueberry Pie, Pumpkin Pie), Free-form (Apricot-Pistachio Tart, Apple Butter Hand Pies), Sleek (Caramelized Lemon Tart, Chocolate Mousse Tart with Hazelnuts), Dreamy (Frozen Chocolateâ€“Peanut Butter Pie, Butterscotch Praline Cream Pie), Rustic (Cheddar-Crust Apple Pie, Blackberry Jam Tart), Layered (Rainbow Puff-Pastry Tarts, Chocolate Pear
Tart), Dainty (Roasted Fig Tartlets, Cranberry Meringue Mini Pies), Artful (Peach-Raspberry Slab Pie, Pumpkin and Ricotta Crostata), Holiday (Neapolitan Easter Pie,
Gingerbread-Raspberry Snowflake Tart), and Savory (Leek and Olive Tart, Summer Squash Lattice Tart).

As is expected from Martha Stewart, this book is at once a feast for the eyes and the palate, as well as a practical teaching tool. Each dish is accompanied by a lush, four-color photograph. Throughout the book are simple instructions for decorative crusts and finishing techniques (latticework, cutouts, classic edgings). A complete Basics section of tools, pantry staples, and dough recipes (pate brisee, cream cheese dough, press-in
cookie crusts, puff pastry), plus plenty of tips and make-ahead tricks, help readers along the way. Whether making an effortless, free-form galette or the perfect latticework
pie, bakers of all skill levels will look again and again to Martha Stewartâ€™s New Pies and Tarts.
