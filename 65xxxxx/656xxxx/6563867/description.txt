This collection of five wagons has no overall theme, and is made up of bogie wagons, a long- wheelbase 4-wheeler, a short-wheelbase 4-wheeler and a well wagon. The wagons were once a common sight on the network from the 1940s through to the 1970s and 1980s, with some types still in existence on the national network, and preserved lines.

In this pack you will find eight different types of wagon with various loads.
