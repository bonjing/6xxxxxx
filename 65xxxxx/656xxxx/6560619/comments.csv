,tobenot71,2011-07-23T22:31Z,How can this be only 400MB in size? Is this for real?
,crossx77,2011-07-24T01:31Z,"tobenot71- Its an MKV file so it will be a small file and they are usually in HD.

MKV is a genius format for Video."

,scottsasse,2011-08-01T02:27Z,"Anyone know if Korean subs are ""hardcoded"" or what?? .BONE. usually has better description on torrents."
,scottsasse,2011-08-01T04:38Z,"Ok, my bad. If you click on the screens link it clearly shows Korean subs. And all the other torrents on TPB thus far that say BRRIP are nothing but a cropped version of this version. They should all have their skulls suspended for a week and maybe then they'll pay attention to what they are really uploading in the future!! Anyhoo, many THANKS to .BONE. for another properly labeled quality torrent!! And THANKS to all who seed!!"
