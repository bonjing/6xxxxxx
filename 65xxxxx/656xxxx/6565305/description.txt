Street Show: 'The Things Between Us' is an exhibition of new work from 22 
different artists distributed solely through a USB Dead Drop installed at 540
W. 21 St. (@ Eyebeam Center for Art + Technology) in New York City. Dead Drops
(started by Aram Bartholl)  are USB flash drives installed in public locations
(buildings, train stations, museums, etc) around the world to create an
anonymous offline peer-to-peer file-sharing network. For The Things Between
Us each artist was asked to make a piece based on the idea of TRANSFER
(whatever that meant to them) that would be unique and only available through
the Dead Drop. 

The Street Show exhibition format is an experiment in the absurd pursuit of
creating  scarcity in the distribution of digital media. Visitors to the Dead
Drop are free to take a file, delete a file, take all the files and so on ad
infinitum, the future distribution of the work is uncertain once installed.
It places the power of  "ownership" of unique files in the hands of its
audience and through this, hopes to reveal something about the culture and
consumption of digital media. The work presented on the drive may end up
online, be deleted, remixed, vandalized, or perhaps even trolled, its fate is
in the hands of those who seek it. 

In the spirit of free art & technology, the initiation of Dead Drops and other 
similar projects (Speedshow / BYOB) this exhibition format is completely free
to reuse and remix by any and all.
