,kaise123,2011-07-26T02:04Z,I saw the Aether mod and it looks REALLY good. if it does not conflict i will probably release it in the next release. Also the modded version of MC works now (it seems the Mod+XP=Lag was in 1.7.2 only)
,kaise123,2011-07-26T10:20Z,"The new version with the Aether Mod will be uploaded tomorrow at sometime after 4 (Adelaide/Darwin time) It includes the Aether, and updated to the wording of the installer and the installation options.

,attackattack,2011-07-27T08:58Z,how do you scan torrents (i just startent using the pirate bay and utorrent) and how bout planes mod?

@attackattack; you can scan the .torrent (cant see the use in that) or you can download the torrent and scan that but i assure you that its clean (see the 156 seeders). I have heard of one antivirus (i think its Norton) detecting it as a virus but im not sure if that's true or not (if so its a false-positive) Good luck with it anyway"
,attackattack,2011-07-28T09:55Z,@kaise123 my dad tells me to scan them and i dont listen really so i was just wondering if it was ok or not thx

Oh, wait... your other torrent (the aether one) has just downloaded on BiTorrent (but not in uTorrent, and I put to download before the BT one)

      Bad video card drivers!      
      -----------------------      

Minecraft was unable to start because it failed to find an accelerated OpenGL mode.
This can usually be fixed by updating the video card drivers.

               what the hell is with this error???? Idk what bad video drives could be on my pc..my pc's fine...why do I keep getting this error on all torrents... kaise123 please help me out here"
,kaise123,2011-09-10T06:33Z,"@samuraijj; This allways happens if you do not have the correct video card drivers installed. You will not notice the fact they are missing but when you say 'my pc's fine' you just haven't noticed.

Go to your PC manufacturer's website and look for driver downloads in the support section and download the ones for your graphics card. No version of Minecraft id going to work until you do this. You could also try making sure you have all the latest windows updates, because they sometimes update your graphics card drivers.

If your pc is fairly old (6+ years) It may not support OpenGL and Minecraft will not work at all.

If you are having problems finding your drivers, if you could E-Mail me i could help you with finding them. Try to provide all the information you know about your PC, and at least the manufacturer and model number and the graphics card it has.

Hope this helps"
,kaise123,2011-09-10T06:40Z,"@georgemills12; The installer only works on PC, so if you are on a PC just double Click it.

@kabne12; They are enabled all the time it just depends on what you want to do, for example F is fly (E & Q = Up and Down)"
,samuraijj,2011-09-10T10:20Z,Thanks Kaise I'll see what I can do but Idk which card drives I need yet..I'll look it up for a while if I don't  find anything I'll contact you..Thanks!
,samuraijj,2011-09-10T16:28Z,I will send my pc for reinstall..now which card drives do you suggest they should include...cause I don't know squat about PCs
,samuraijj,2011-09-10T23:10Z,"I don't know how to email you through piratebay so I beg you to try and help me..Is there any way for me to update my card drives..but automaticly like an updater that will update all of them?...Because as I said before I suck ass in pc contends..I know how to work with it and manage properly though but I can't recognize certain stuff..Minecraft is one crappy graphic game..but the whole idea of ..you know ..making a lot of stuff..underground bases ,walls houses ,mines..it's kinda interesting..
Thanks for your help so far."
,kaise123,2011-09-12T05:32Z,"@samuraijj; I can't tell what card drivers you have from here because every different PC has different ones. Do you know the model name/number of your PC? if not could you at least tell me what brand it is and the operating system it is running (Windows XP, Vista, 7 etc.) and than i might be able to help you. My E-Mail Address is in the readme (kaise123@gmail.com)

Although the in-game graphics might look pretty bad, it is intentionally that way. Minecraft actually needs a fair amount of graphics power to run smoothly (but will work well on lower-end machines with graphics turned down) Because of the way it renders (with Advanced OpenGL off it is rendering millions-billions of blocks at a time)

It is much easier to help via E-Mail so if you have E-Mail than i would appreciate it if you could send me one for further help (to avoid clogging up the comments section, and so that I don't have to check this page every day

Hope you get it working soon, Kaise123
"
,samuraijj,2011-09-12T19:23Z,I don't need any further help so I'll comment...I think it's actully a problem with my opengl or something but I got it working on my laptop so I'm playing it there..but I'm full of viruses on it so I have to decrese the graphics to play smoothly...Thanks
,kaise123,2011-09-13T04:14Z,OpenGL support is part of your graphics card/drivers. You either do not have them intstalled or your actual hardware does not support it.
,kaise123,2011-09-16T11:47Z,I am going to release a Minecraft 1.8.1 torrent soon. It will not include all mods because i need to wait for them to be updated and make sure mojang do not release 1.8.2/.3 therefore rendering my effort useless.
