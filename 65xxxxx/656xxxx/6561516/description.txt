 ********************Kaise123***************************

This minecraft installer was compiled by kaise123 (Kai)
i take no credit for the loader, which was created by Anjocaido
and Minecraft itself, created by Mojang.

The mods are owned by their respective creators and i take no credit for their creation. to see the source code on open source projects google the names of the mods (listed below)

This installs minecraft into appdata placing all the shortcuts into your desktop/start menu.

For some reason on some windows XP machines the mods cause terrible lag (i believe it is due to some dependancy missing) therefore I have removed the mods on the windows xp version.

You can contact me via e-mail ~kaise123@gmail.com~ or you can ad me on MSN with the same address.
Please contact me if you have any (reasonable) requests for mods and any other additions to the release.
please email me reporting any problems, stating the torrent in the subject so i know what your on about :)

Please be patient if you are the first downloading this and seed for a while as i only have Dial-up speed internet and cannot seed at any great speed. please be considerate of that.

INSTRUCTIONS
###############

To install run the installer, it really is that simple! the installer has been tested on all (Current windows) operating systems, and it works perfectly.
The installer automatically gives you the option to install 32bit java, and if you want 64bit Java run the installer again and select it during the precess

###############
NOTES
###############

The installer will only work on one user (each user needs to install it seperately for it to work).
The mods included were not made by me, and i take no credit for their making.
If you do not want mods choose the Windows XP selection during setup.
If you are on XP you CAN use the one with mods (it may work for you, but it diddnt for me).

IT DOES NOT WORK ON OFFICIAL ONLINE SERVERS, DONT EVEN ASK!!!

However the loader alowes you to enter a name to use on an online mode=false server.

******************************MODS*****************************************
