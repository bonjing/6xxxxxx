Product Description: "Potato salad is not just a starchy buddy to your hamburger. It has a proud place in cultures around the world, from German oil-and-vinegar salads with bacon to dill-accented Scandinavian delights. And, of course, it's the all-American side dish at every Fourth of July picnic. But this great dish deserves to shine year-round. In this book are the flavors of beloved favorites, but with new twists. Other recipes bring in international touches. So, take potato salad to stardom. Go spud wild."
