,_asdf,2011-08-03T12:33Z,Stuck at 99.9% Hammer fight and game key are unfinished. oh well.
,squintina,2011-08-04T12:24Z,"boo, hammerfight was the only one i wanted and something is wrong with it. it stops at 99%."
,darkflux88,2012-06-14T18:41Z,"i just went and unzipped Hammerfight, and it unzipped without errors. maybe the torrent info is wrong?

also, you shouldn't need a game key, since these were free games. Demonoid has almost an identical torrent, except with no GAMEKEY file, so it could just be a ruse.

then again, i've not yet installed it..."
