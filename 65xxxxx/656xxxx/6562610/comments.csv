,bryn77,2011-08-12T15:14Z,"I don't know what audiguypaul was doing but in any case he is wrong.  This is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban exactly as described.  My DVD had become scratched and unplayable so me and my kids are very happy with this, especially since this has icelandic audio."
