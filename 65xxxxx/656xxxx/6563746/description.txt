About The Show (from HBOCanada.com): The six-part half-hour miniseries starring kids but aimed at adults, takes a new approach to the mafia mentality by bringing the mean streets to the schoolyard with the kids running the show. Mourners of the late, great Sopranos will meet a new kind of mob as two rival schoolyard gangs struggle for supremacy. Their world is also being captured by an unseen Documentarian, voiced by Paul Gross (one of the miniseries' executive producers), providing both "behind the scenes" footage and interviews with the kids intercut with the main drama.
