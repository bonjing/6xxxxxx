Burma Chronicles
by: Guy Delisle

In previous graphic memoirs, Delisle, a french-canadian animator, has 
documented in spare, whimsical black-and-white line drawings his visits 
to North Korea and China. Here, he turns his hand to another authoritarian 
Asian regime, Burma, where he spent a year after the 2004 tsunami with 
his wife and their infant son. Drawn with charming simplicity and brio, 
the book mixes traditional travelogue with glimmers of the unexpected, 
as when Delisle notes that in the local newspaper some articles contain 
nothing but a list of officials present at a given event, or discovers 
a lit light bulb placed in a drawer to keep paper dry during monsoon 
season. Delisle takes a whimsical approach but also logs political 
realities the increasing difficulty of getting travel permits for 
humanitarian work, the abrupt banishment of foreign videos from stores. 

This is the third in his series, the first being:
