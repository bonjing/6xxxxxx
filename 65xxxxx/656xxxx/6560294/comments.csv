Not a Dvd-rip, rather a badly cut 4:3 version. I really should have read the info first, and then looked up details about in which aspect ratio this movie was shot in, originally.

Whith this case, I put too much trust in faren73:s pink skull when downloading this fully. So in a way; my own bad. But still, trusted uploaders should not be excused for putting up ""fallable"" torrents.

From now on, I will still look to your uploads (nothing wrong with the quality), but be very aware of the details."
