,mikeonpirate,2011-07-28T23:31Z,"I really want to thank you jorrell! I work on sunday, so you save my F1 weekend over and over again!"
,catamaranman,2011-07-29T01:40Z,"@Sanyi001:  There is no problem with either file.  True 1080p video takes alot of video memory as well as processing power so, my guess is that is why you are having problems at moments where there is alot of movement during closeups.  I had the same problem until I got my new vid card.  Just to reiterate for everyone else, these files are fine.  Thanks Jorrell, you're doing the best job possible with these broadcasts!"
,catamaranman,2011-07-30T00:42Z,Ok....so there IS a little skip (less than a second) caused by poor TV signal but happens before the race during the graphic that shows the starting order.
,x87,2011-07-30T01:20Z,Thanks ever so much about this. Many of us wouldn't have a chance to watch F1's best coverage if it wasn't for your efforts!
