,Swanee1,2011-07-26T04:08Z,An IMDB reference would be good. I have no idea which movie this is.
,QborT,2011-07-26T04:18Z,"Swanee1, you are a fuckin idiot.  In the time it took you to type out that complaint you could easily have done a google search.

It is a Korean thriller.  Now go find it for yourself you lazy kunt.  :)"
,pourable,2011-07-26T04:19Z,"It might be ""The River Murders"" but I'm just guessing it's the closest thing on imdb. *shrugs*"
,pourable,2011-07-26T04:21Z,a korean movie by that title does come up on a search so maybe the ruder than rude asswipe is right
,deadamy,2011-07-26T05:26Z,"Swanee is right. if you want to post a torrent, do it properly. 
@ QborT: most people ARE ""lazy kunts"", get used to it."
,LEERV,2011-07-26T12:48Z,"Just to point out CUNT is spelt with a C not a K.
You illiterate people."
,deadamy,2011-07-26T14:35Z,"and ""spelt"" should be ""spelled"""
,QborT,2011-07-26T17:02Z,"deadamy if most people are lazy kunts, then why should scenebalance be expected to include the NFO?  I don't see you doing any uploading deadamy, so congrats on being a lazy complaining kunt aswell. ;)

Scenebalance is a fucking uploader bot, that frequently doesn't even seed their uploads.  Not having the NFO is the least of the problems.

Look kids, the rudest person is also the most helpful.  "
,deadamy,2011-07-27T19:33Z,"@ QborT: 
""uploader bot""? never heard of that! but thanx for enlightening me. i'm a bit naive: if you upload a torrent, i guess you'd want as many downloaders as possible so including imdb info seems the logical thing to do. i guess i was wrong!
and btw i've not uploaded anything (yet) since i just registered very recently and i only did that so i could post a remark. many people are strictly downloaders-only in the torrent-world (unless i'm wrong again)
but i'm not wrong about how to spell ""spelled"" ;-)
oh hell, kill 'em all and let God sort 'em out!"
