,obieone23,2011-07-24T19:31Z,"I'm only uploading DVDs that I don't see here.  So up next I'm going to try to upload Cougar, Laos, Golden Air, Air Europe 2 DVD, Air Seychelles, VG Airlines and ITVV Sabena 747-300. I also wish someone would upload the Air Canada 777-200LR vid."
,jlabossi,2011-07-25T04:04Z,Any chance you have Intersky?  I've been stuck at 95.5% for weeks on another copy.  Thanks.
,MarcW10,2011-08-26T23:07Z,"Downloading now TY. And I'm working on uploading the Air Canada 772LR program. At the moment the file is 11.6Gb, which is obviously bigger than the original DVD! Trying to shrink it to something remotely uploadable while keeping quality intact. But it's on my to do list and it'll be online soonish. If you have any of the Iberia A340 DVDs or the Air Canada 767 to offer I'd appreciate it!!"
