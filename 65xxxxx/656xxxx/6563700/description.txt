Storyline:
Frank Bannister is a psychic swindler with the perfect business partners. They work cheap... they're dedicated... and they're dead.
Possessed with a genuine ability to communicate with the dearly departed, Bannister earns a stiff living by setting up "spirit clearance" scams with his trio of ghostly cronies.
But Frank may not be the only one in the small town of Fairwater working the paranormal side of the street. A series of inexplicable deaths and
bizarre occurrences suggests the presence of a malevolent poltergeist. With the suspicious finger of a zealous FBI agent pointing directly at him,
and the woman he cares for in danger, Bannister attempts to unravel the supernatural crime spree by venturing into a realm where all fears are realized... and true evil does not die.
