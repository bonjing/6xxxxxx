This is the replacement torrent for http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6562016 I accidentally uploaded the wrong ISO. Although this one is slightly larger this is the correct ISO.

You must have at least 512MB Ram to run WINDOWS LINUX.

THIS IS NOT THE LIVE CD, BUT THE MAIN INSTALLATION DVD.

Windows Linux 2011 release, First live CD. Microsoft first every free os, and its Linux. Just download and try it. And all of those saying Microsoft wouldn't, or its fake. Try it, what have you got to lose. 

It has WINE, which is now compatible with Microsoft Office 2007/2010.

And tons of free software. This could be the one and only release. The reason there is no advertising, is that this is in BETA stages and is only, in comparison to windows, in M1 Stages.  

And I will seed 24/7 as the old torrent was wrong, I apologies for the mistake.

Steps:

1. Boot from DVD.
2. Select Installation
3. Complete the set up wizard, (Blue background with text.)
4. Finalise installation
5. Successfully installed Windows Linux

Want pictures???? Just ask and I will upload them.
