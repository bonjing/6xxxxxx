[V],_F1_,2011-07-27T08:37Z,"You always make me ashamed Sir, as your required titles never belong with me. Sorry ... But I'll search further in my old HDDs and that job is too lengthy and boring.

I was thinking why are you so much interested about the sociology of my country?"
,g8mate,2011-07-28T10:48Z,"thank you F1. You're terrific person! 
I'm trying to find this rare  book ""Janus"" by Maurice Duverger :( and can't find it anywhere. 
Please help !!  

greets"
[V],_F1_,2011-07-28T13:11Z,"Is that book in English? I have a very poor collection of non-English title.
Added to OD List. Will upload if possible ..."
,g8mate,2011-07-28T14:42Z,"I know it's on French language ""Janus: les deux faces de l'Occident"" Maurice Duverger but I figure out that in English this book is translated like ""Modern Democracies: Economic Power Versus Political Power"" ??!!  Might be that this is the same book ?? Thanks for efforts mate :D "
,g8mate,2011-07-28T14:58Z,"No, it's not the same book. That's completely other book from Maurice Duverger. I look for ""Janus"" if there's any on English :)"
,nyasangosi,2011-07-28T16:03Z,"_F1_, you the best!!! I can't believe I have this book when I need it most. Thank you!! I am from Malawi-a small poor and poorly-governed country in  the Southern Africa and I would never get the chance to read this timeless piece which will help me influence a few. "

,nyasangosi,2011-07-28T17:42Z," _F1_ , thanks and keep up the good work. I don't want to make it a habit but since you encouraged me 'to be around' I have another wish to make: ""The Meme Machine by Suzan Blackmore.""  "
[V],_F1_,2011-07-28T20:26Z,"nyasangosi, if you feel you are bugging me by making continuous request - you are TOTALLY WRONG. Requests actually encourages uploaders and an uploader feel the same excitement uploading a requested content as the requester feels after getting the same. Only - don't get disappointed if any uploader fails to keep your request as nobody has everything in this world. A true file sharer will always try to keep requests, so, don't hesitate to make another.

Here you go:

,gil_bates,2011-07-29T00:58Z,"Any chance you could upload ""The Naked Ape"" by Desmond Morris.  It came out in 1967 so I thought it would be in the public domain, but apparently the publisher has not stopped making money on it yet."
