Graham Dann, "The Sociology of Tourism - European Origins and Developments" 
Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited | ISBN: 1846639883 | Edition 2009 | PDF | 483 pages | 1.54 mb

Currently there is abundant evidence of the quasi-total domination of the sociology and anthropology of tourism by academics from the English-speaking world, a situation that appears to be aided and abetted by the publishers of books and articles in that language. This volume is the first attempt of its kind to familiarise readers in the US, UK, Australia and the English speaking regions of Africa and Asia with such evolutionary thinking. In such a manner, also, it will be possible to discern, contextualize and better appreciate the European roots of subsequent theorising in the Anglophone world, thereby enabling a more accurate assessment of its hitherto unchallenged claims to originality.
