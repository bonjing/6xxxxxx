,mbmalone,2011-07-29T01:09Z,"Wireless is now working on DELL Latitude D610 with Broadcom. I'm sure the Intel is working, too  :-). The audio doesn't work, but it's not HD audio. Audio hardly ever works on these PE's anyway. The disk is good, thank you !!!!!"
,redback38,2011-07-29T01:18Z,"@mbmalone...long way to the top huh?....another bogan aussie on TPB!(i dont feel so lonely now lol).yer i made it two disks,if you could test em,particularly the wi-fi?....its beta...but the drivers and PENetwork are there,should be cool though...my work comp has wi-fi in the box itself so works nativly....hope the drivers give you what you need for urs:-)"
,redback38,2011-07-29T01:22Z,"audio should deffs work on disk1....look in the start menu under the drivers folder(think its in conputer management?)should be realtek HDMI driver pack to install,disk 2 should be same,and the Force install should help too....ill boot em up and test it more but it should work straight off the bat...."
,mbmalone,2011-07-29T02:42Z,"I tested both disks, but some audio problems for me. It's pretty common, will probably work for some and  not for others. The wireless was tested on two notebooks. Both Broadcom & Intel 5100 worked perfectly. I will try to test the audio on another computer. It doesn't cause any issues, just can't hear anything. I was trying to get higher resolution on my notebook, but wouldn't do 1400x900 with Nvidia. 1024x768 only, for me. The builds are good, based on Win 7 SP1."
,redback38,2011-07-29T02:44Z,"yup tested disk one,audio working fine,just look in comp management in start menu,open driver folder run realtek driver install,all good:-)"
,redback38,2011-07-29T02:49Z,"and im pretty sure i left audio off disk 2....saving space and its purely for rescue/network use so audio seemed a bit bloated.....got some great new stuff in version 5(dedicated network hacking\diagnostic and password cracker extraviganza!lol)....and version 6 be a multiboot with hirens rescue disk V14,and two of the latest acronis bootable environments.....stay tuned..:-)"
,redback38,2011-07-29T02:56Z,"oh,just a footnote Nvidia graphics drivers and cards are notorious for problems in PE...youll get 1024x768 ok but nvidia drivers dont like anything higher,try right clicking Resolution changer icon(bottom right taskbar)and see if itll go higher for you,some comps will,some not,see how ya go:-)"
,mbmalone,2011-07-29T03:05Z,"I tried building these, too but mine always bugger's up. 
Are you going to use Hiren's v14 Proteus in the v5 build?

I uploaded a screenshot of v4 Disk 2 :-)

,redback38,2011-07-29T03:40Z,"@mbmalone.....yes thats the one alright!hirensV14 is an ewesome disk,for just about any system.itll be in the next version as a multiboot option:-)and yes.....building PE boot disks is a fickle business,scripting in new apps can cause a dud build sooo easy!it s aREALLY STEEP learning curve! winbuilder80 is now has some great tools in the builder that simplify multiboot options and getting the .iso onto stick and booting with minimum fuss:-)"
,mbmalone,2011-07-29T19:46Z,"Audio wasn't working for me because my notebook doesn't have Realtek High Definition Audio, it has Conexant High Definition Audio: 

Conexant High Definition SmartAudio 221

,dee_mer80,2011-07-30T02:39Z,"thanks very much, it all works for me fine..but I have to replace the wifi driver w/ Dell 1397 compatible w/ my netbook like I did on version 1....audio and video works well...but you know we are insatiable people..lol...if you can incorporate internet sharing (from wireless to LAN) which is much needed in my situation..that is if only you can...you can disregard my request, I think you've done enough for me...many thanks once again ..God Bless"
,redback38,2011-07-30T09:18Z,"ok so were all kinda happy lol!....ask and thy shall recieve.....@mbmalone?.....ill look for the conexant HD audio drivers for you......@dee_mer....wireless to LAN on its way....as usual no gurantees...buildin these things can be like runnin a tank over empty eggshells,give me a few days maybe?...who knows,iv been lucky lately.and you guys arent asking too much.....whats the point of making a product/thing if it doesnt meet the needs of the users who are most interested in it:-)"
,redback38,2011-07-30T09:44Z,"oh and all that will be version 6....version 5 will be a dedicated network and password hacking tools,sniffers,crackers,all the handy naughty stuff and the like,in the one disk .its half done so ill pump it out then do version 6 with the needed drivers/stuff asked for:-) "
,redback38,2011-07-30T10:15Z,"@mbmalone...having trouble finding ur exact driver...dig round the net and post a link to it here.if you can find it,ill get it in the build after next(itll be in version6)...:-)"
,redback38,2011-07-30T10:33Z,"@dee_mer....post a link to the EXACT driver you want(driver pack would be equally ok,ill grab it out when i get it)...same for you mbmalone...post link here and ill grab it...:-)"

,redback38,2011-07-31T13:58Z,@dee_mer......got the link ok but keep getting a fail to connect to server at dell....even tried going a few other ways but couldnt get to dell support today....will try tomorrow...either way...they will be in corporated in version 6(coming soon)...@mbmalone....your HD audio drivers are in version 5(to be released in a day or so)iv placed a shortcut to your driver install package on the desktop so you can install and test easily.thanks guys for your feedback and support:-)
,mbmalone,2011-07-31T19:21Z,"@redback38 I build a drop-in driver script that works perfectly for my audio, but piratebay won't let me post the link or something ??"
,redback38,2011-08-01T15:01Z,"@mbmalone...i have put your driver audio pack  on the desktop of version5,(just runt)but if TPB wont let you post a link?Upload it as a torrent and post the link in the comments section of the latest version(V5)and ill grab it.Drivers are a tedious when adding them into the build,need to be done one by one,so an alternate script that""just works""would be sweet:-)"
,redback38,2011-08-01T15:27Z,@dee_mur i found the requested driver 1397 compatible dell Wlan...downloading now(will be in version 6):-)
