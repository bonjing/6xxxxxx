,alannuttall,2011-08-04T10:23Z,I'm pretty sure there's no dragons which severely disappoints me and makes me hate the person who thought up this misleading title :c
,mmedic,2011-08-27T07:15Z,"""There be dragons"" is an expression.  I am disappointed in your uneducated comment... so there."
,herosandwich,2011-08-29T23:34Z,"agreed. ""there be dragons"" or ""there be lions""is what mapmakers used to write on the uncharted or unfinished portions of maps."
