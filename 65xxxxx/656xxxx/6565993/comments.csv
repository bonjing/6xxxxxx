,Ears14U,2011-09-18T17:34Z,Why download 2011 version? Have you seen 2012 version? And have you tried to download the 2011 version anymore? And finally you try and manipulate the FIREWALL in 2012 to allow your programs access and Non-access to their home sites for validation and other neat stuff. So you ask why download the 2011 version? Hmm........wow.....
