,McFly01,2011-07-25T04:00Z,"Stuck too! This is the worst thing about torrents and sites like this! To much people who just don't care! Stop smashing and grabbing!!! Start seeding instead, FFS! And jorrell0733, it wouldn't hurt if you could fix this when or if you see it happening. Thanks for the other great and successfully uploaded torrents. cya"
,mojazubarka,2011-07-25T16:32Z,"jorrell0733 is there any chance to resume uploading FP3 because missing only 20 pieces or 40MB and TS file is good as well, and i think it's faster to upload 40MB instead of uploading 1GB. PLEASE."
,Robakaizo,2011-07-26T22:31Z,"jorrell made a mistake on this upload and re-uploaded it.  Get the other, newer one."
