The Glasgow Airport Rail Link (GARL) was a proposal to directly link Glasgow Central station with Glasgow International Airport in Scotland, United Kingdom. The link was intended for completion by 2013 and would have had a service of four trains per hour running along a semi-reconstructed via Cardonald, Hillington East and Hillington West, to Paisley Gilmour Street station. It would then have branched-off onto a new purpose-built 1.2 mile (1.9 km) line taking it over the M8 motorway into the airport.

Totalize Media have created numerous add-ons for rail simulation games. GARL is their most ambitious project to date featuring the whole route covering 9km of existing track from Glasgow Central to Paisley St James and an additional 1.9km of new track between the proposed Airport Junction and Glasgow International Airport.
