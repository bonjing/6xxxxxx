,DiscGo,2011-07-25T05:12Z,"Honestly, this was my first torrent I have ever made. I couldn't find what I wanted in any other single torrent, so I made it this way to try and make it as simple as possible. 

Assuming I uploaded it correctly, it is legit. Someone please confirm that it works after you download it."
,DiscGo,2011-07-25T15:01Z,"I downloaded it myself from a different computer and everything is great, except episode 17 is in spanish. I am going to create a new upload with 17 being in english."

Downloaded within 48 hours and didn't get stuck at close to finish."
