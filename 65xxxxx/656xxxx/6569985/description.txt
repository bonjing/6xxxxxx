Martin Lawrence speaks out on racism, drugs, politics, and (most frequently) sex in this concert film that captures the comic on stage at a 1993 show in New York. Originally rated NC-17 for language by the MPAA, the harsh rating caused the film's original distributor, Miramax, to sell it to another company, Samuel Goldwyn, which released it unrated.
