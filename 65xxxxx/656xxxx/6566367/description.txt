Elliott Perkins is an electronic musician born in England but currently residing in Leipzig, Germany.

He has released two full-lengths on Morr Music. He cites Autechreâ€™s album â€œTri Repetaeâ€ as a major influence.

In school he pursued linguistics, and his moniker â€˜Phonemâ€™ is derived from the word â€œphonemeâ€, a term used to denote a group of slightly different speech sounds which are treated the same way by speakers of a particular language; it is defined by Wikipedia as â€œthe smallest segmental unit of sound employed to form meaningful contrasts between utterancesâ€.
