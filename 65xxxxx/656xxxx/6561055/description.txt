This is not the Complete Tom and Jerry Collection, as it may be missing an episode or two, but this is how the original DVDs are, so please don't go rating the torrent quality down for this reason. 

For any missing episodes please check out my other torrent below and download the missing episodes:

These DVD set costs about USD 200 as you can see in the ebay link, so please say "Thank You" when you download, also please seed as I won't be able to seed long due to internet limitations.
