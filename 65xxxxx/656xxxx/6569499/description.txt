 1. It slipped right through my hands
 2. A memory from my happier years
 3. Your love is contagious
 4. Slow suicide
 5. Between so long and goodbye
 6. Your heart is just a frigidaire
 7. Heartaches and strifes
 8. A darker side of me
 9. The world I live in
10. This is better
11. A risky lifestyle
