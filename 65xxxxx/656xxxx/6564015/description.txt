Phorum Peninsula is a fictional island located off the South Coast of England linked by a causeway and is notionally modeled on the island of Portland. The main features of the island include an American owned quarry, a thriving dock, the classic seaside town of St Bilton and many other tourist draws such as the lighthouse, causeway and fishing villages.

Project Platform was the name given to a charity event which took place in February 2010 where a 24 hour period was set aside to create a fictional yet engaging route which would be sold with all profits going to The Railway Children charity (www.railwaychildren.org.uk). Many assets were donated by the train simulation community and during the 24 hour period the majority of route building was completed.
