,hannibal1892,2011-07-25T15:25Z,"Using GOM player works but it's not the whole episode, might missing first 5 to 10 minutes because it starts weird"
,Evilution,2011-07-25T19:16Z,"This one is missing the first 8 minutes (atleast in MPC, only player that would start it even for me).

,Sushifreak,2011-07-26T01:12Z,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, danke schoen, merci beaucoup, and arigato!
Your uploads rule in so many ways... you post the real deal, no BS, no RARs w/passwords, no hidden link crap... just consistently excellent video quality w/o commercials.
You seriously rock, and I want to be one of the few to acknowledge your prowess, rather than posting BS like ""Wouldn't play, I watched it here:  www.pureBS.com.""
Furthermore, your taste in shows is impeccable, as exemplified by the fact that you post Breaking Bad and Falling Skies!
Oh, BTW, did I say Thank You?  Well, THANK YOU!  Again!  ;)"
