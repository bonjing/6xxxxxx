,hootieman,2011-07-23T22:10Z,lol was this made a while ago and they were anticipating her killing herself? Came out pretty fucking quick if ya ask me
,g8aso,2011-07-23T22:24Z,"Jumping on the bandwagon, I suppose people will be saying what a taleted singer she was and fogetting about the fact she was a drunkard and a hardcore drug user.
 A waste of space, will not be missed. "

[T],bigsimon,2011-07-24T01:18Z,"@ g8aso - you really are a sad and pathetic little man who is always fishing for attention - if you are not bitching about over people ripping MP3's in ""joint stereo"" you are now bitching about dead pop stars !!!! you really are such a spineless worm. 

Maybe you are one of these pathetic brainwashed ""scientilogist"" types who see's everyone as a SP because you are ""clear"" and in big debt for being on ""The Bridge"" for too long or some such bullshit like that !!!!

It is afact that Amy was far from perfect in her life but in the short time she was here she did something that you will never be able to do - that is create and perform musically - nuff said"
