,remedy2,2011-07-27T08:04Z,Sweet- will this work on 3.55?
,remedy2,2011-07-27T08:17Z,ok according to forums this isnt working.  there is no patch for 3.41 or 3.55 yet as it is locked to 3.6x
,remedy2,2011-07-27T08:23Z,"http://www.ps3iso.com/showthread.php?p=399513

Here is the eboot.bin for the JAP version.  If you swap this with the one in the download it will get you through the 1st level -after that it freezes.  Have to wait for a full 3.55 eboot or patch"
,Worldsocold12,2011-07-28T14:32Z,"I played the demo of this and I love it! Cant wait to play it!

And here some info on the 3.6x keys:

Could be as soon as three weeks but of course this is all speculation."
,blizuntochronic,2011-07-30T07:34Z,"Sorry but its going to be a while b4 the game is playable on 3.55. Sony has wised up and is now signing updates with the 3.6x keys, so the patches that allowed games like Infamous 2 and LA Noire to work on 3.55 are probably not going to come out.  BTW the process described in the link above has already been done by other devs with no success.  "
,jitsuin,2011-08-02T08:26Z,"i follow the ps3 hackin scene and its gonna be alot longer than 3 week but one day thjis will be playable but u will need to have a ps3 on 3.55, if not u will have to downgrade and that's a pain in the ass DX"
,jitsuin,2011-08-02T08:29Z,"you guys should prolly get the japanese version because it works on 3.55 and right now people are working on hacking the english subtitle files to work in the japanese version, its a matter of time before the japanese version will be playable with english subtitles...u get the authentic japanese audio though XD"
,FinBanan,2011-08-02T19:13Z,Hi. Are you going to upload more scene releases of games? 
,645harris,2011-08-08T07:11Z,"im new, how do you take the downloaded torrent and transfer it to your ps3?"
,majuaraan,2011-08-09T23:11Z,"wheyighte? so this group is from mars, really awesome...how do they breath there?"
,ninjanutta,2011-08-10T00:02Z,"there is a fix for this that gives full english audio and mainly english cell phone text,its on ps3 iso if your interested"
,handsomeguy,2011-08-18T22:57Z,i don t understand what i have to do with this torrent can someone explain? 
,Darkvelvet,2011-08-19T05:10Z,Still no fix for 3.55 yet?  Oh man this is really tempting but right now useless without a patch.
,SerPounceAlot,2011-08-20T02:42Z,"Just so all of you noobs know, this game will NOT work on your ps3. So no point in trying to transfer it or to waste time trying to make it work. That being said, it is still a great upload. Thanks .AkTivisT.! "
