It's as simple as it is! Two good friends sharing the same passion for Techno music started collaborating together.

These two dj's met each other in the Dutch underground house scene around the year 2000. They immediately had a huge click. 
In 2005 they started producing underground Techno and building their own repertoire combining their productions with Minimal, Techhouse and Techno influences.

In the beginning of 2010 they started their own record label called Flatlife Wired. On this label they already released several tracks and did some remixes for producers and dj's on national and international level. 
For AudioWire it is very important to make music they like and music they also can share with the rest of the world. There is nothing better than sharing your stuff with people around the globe.

At this moment AudioWire is growing each day. They are working with some well established producers on a national and international level. They will keep this doing for the love of music!
