
Stratovariusâ€™ second album since the departure of last â€œfounderâ€ Timo Tolkki, Elysium represents a creative spirit that shows they can function just fine without Madman Tolkki. Elysium is a comeback of sorts, not because the band has shifted away dramatically since the departure of Tolkki, but because it features track after track of music that isnâ€™t mediocre. Now, Iâ€™m sure that Stratovarius fans will be in up in arms over this statement, but Stratovarius has been known to release very mediocre albums mainly due to a lack of originality, or just creative songwriting within their framed style. Elysium represents a return to what made Stratovarius an innovator within the power metal genre, with grandiose solos and melodies, a soaring, epic vocal performance by Timo Kotipelto, and a particularly powerful opus known as â€œElysium.â€

In particular, the opening two songs â€œDarkest Hoursâ€ and â€œUnder Flaming Skiesâ€ are really stand out songs, the first with some really great melodies, and the second with some inclusion of groove which is completely unexpected and a welcome follow up to â€œDarkest Hours.â€ â€œInfernal Mazeâ€ is a song that is a combination of Kamelotâ€™s sultry vocal style as a lead in, which delivers us to a pleasant, Stratovarious style speedy neo-classical number that doesnâ€™t drag, or sound like a stagnant carbon copy of any number of the bandâ€™s other tunes.
