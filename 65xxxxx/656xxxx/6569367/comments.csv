I hope this includes the Taj Mahal in India and the Alhambra in Spain."

It's just that the Zionist jew controlled media doesn't want to focus on the true Islam, just their lies and hate born from jealousy and stupidity.

Thanks again, the Taj always gives me goosebumps and I plan to take my children to see it one day and I saw the Alhambra on vacation years ago and it's even more beautiful in person."
