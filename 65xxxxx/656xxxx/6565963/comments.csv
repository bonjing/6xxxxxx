,RaztaMazta,2011-07-27T03:02Z,PLease SEED Froggie...thnx.
,RWAB,2011-07-30T02:32Z,"Um this isn't 8/10 it's so blury, a good TS should be close to DVD quality.

There's a difference between CAM and TS, kids."
,jkeller80,2011-07-30T05:16Z,"The picture looks better in the sample than the screenshots but the sound is tinny and shallow. I thought TS was supposed to mean better sound???

A/6
V7
Respectively for a CAM/TS"
,defendork,2011-07-30T19:14Z,"this is a filtered cam, so still not a telesync i think
that's also why the sound isn't pure"
,myth1337,2011-08-02T06:24Z,"A-7
V-8
M-8

Someone needs to read the definitions for Cam and TS again, because this is a Cam!

A nice Cam though...."

,ashen77,2011-08-04T01:54Z,Glad to see you've finaly come out of the closet dielaughing.
,ashter87,2011-08-05T02:57Z,"only thing I'm finding similar between all of these is so far the dude dielaughing is a homo who does not realize we are not all morons :P ,,l,, sit on it punk"
,mulom,2011-08-07T20:19Z,What a bunch of american propaganda!!! I hope this latest crisis drags everyone in that country to HELL!!! Damn americans!!!
,Dhatz,2011-08-13T16:42Z,that americans are damn idiots doesnt make any other country made of less idiots.
,Mytzlplk,2011-08-27T03:01Z,Just a little swipe at the anti-America comments. We may suck but if it weren't for us you'd ALL be speaking German right now. So suck it... 
,lvl2bear,2011-08-27T17:08Z,"If it weren't for France there would be no USA, pay respects where it's due"
,surfmas,2011-08-28T22:54Z,"Im American and I agree with lvl2bear. Let'em know bear, let them know."
,defendork,2011-09-07T10:04Z,"@Mytzlplk no... the russians actually did most of the work... The pushed the Germans all the way back to their own country. The Americans pushed them a little back out of france, not in the smartest way (no disrespect because a lot of lives were lost because of a stupid coincidence) but they did it either way.
What the Americans ARE good for is being the bullies of the world, your army is worth more than your economy at this point"
,doctordave41,2011-09-19T11:14Z,"This is for all of you talking shit about Americans. Don't judge us because we have a pussy ass idiot for a president that is content with destroying our economy. The next time another country need the help of our military or our banks or aid for a disaster we should say ""piss off"". We have supported the world monetarily for the past 50 years and now we need help and this is how we get repaid. Hopefully the next generation remembers how you all put us down when the shoe back on the other foot. It makes me feel like the family members I lost fighting overseas for you ingrates was a total waste of good people, we should have let you live with the messes you made and bail your own asses out. If you hate us so, stop coming to our country and stay where you belong."

And stop asking for money, food and building materials and driving our prices up for 2nd grade shit while you get our best for free everytime mother nature screws you in the ass."
,doctordave41,2011-09-19T11:27Z,"Screw you all. If we're such a joke then stop begging us for food, money and building materials everytime you have a natural disaster. We don't beg for your help everytime a tornado or hurricane tears shit up. If it weren't for us feeding the world you'd all starve to death or die of food poisoning, you backwoods hicks. Have you ever heard of bacteria or soap and clean water. I've seen how filthy you foreign chefs can be, I won't eat their crap or punish my animals with it either. Uncivilized Creatans"
,dgezel,2011-10-05T21:51Z,I'm from Belgium and I have lots of respect for America.Go take a look in our Ardennes and you know why we should pay respect for America!!

For a cam its pretty good. Perfectly watchable, but there's an annoying fan sound throughout and occasional jumps in volume.

Thanks for the upload!"
