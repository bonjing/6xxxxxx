,smithsunknown,2011-07-24T21:15Z,does this one have the sync problem?  other downloads have a audio sync problem near the end of the movie because the original bluray had sync issues.
[T],honchorella31,2011-07-25T20:03Z,was all in sync when i watched it 
,smithsunknown,2011-07-26T01:30Z,"i currently have Saving Private Ryan 1998 BRRip H264 AAC-SecretMyth (Kingdom-Release).  near the end, the audio gets out of sync.  i read that this was due to a problem on the original bluray itself, not the source of the torrent.  it could just be the version i have.
