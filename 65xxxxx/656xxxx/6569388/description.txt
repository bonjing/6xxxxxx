I\'m not sure where I got this from, but it contains every multitrack (.mogg) found in The Beatles Rock Band. It has disc tracks + DLC (Abbey Road, Rubber Soul & Sgt. Pepper\'s). I recommend audacity to open them. I don\'t know why some files are just .ogg but I succesfully opened them in Sound Forge. Yes, I\'m also a beatlemaniac. You\'re welcome.
