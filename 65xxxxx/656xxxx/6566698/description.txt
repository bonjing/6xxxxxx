January 10, 49 B.C.: Julius Caesar crosses the Rubicon River into Rome, igniting a civil war that leads to the birth of the worldÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s greatest ancient civilization.

October 12, 1492: The Spanish explorer Christopher Columbus, weary after months at sea, finally drops anchor at the island of San Salvador and takes EuropeÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s first steps into the New World.

September 11, 2001: On a calm Tuesday morning, a series of terrorist attacks on the United States of America ignites a global war on terrorism that continues to this day.

History is made and defined by landmark events such as theseÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â¥moments that irrevocably changed the course of human civilization. While many of us are taught that anonymous social, political, and economic forces are the driving factors behind events of the past, acclaimed historian and award-winning Professor J. Rufus Fears believes that itÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s individuals, acting alone or together, who alter the course of history. These events have given us

* spiritual and political ideas,
* catastrophic battles and wars,
* scientific and technological advances,
* world leaders both influential and monstrous, and
* cultural works of unparalleled beauty.

Without them, human history as we know it today would be shockingly unfamiliar. In short, because of these events, our world would never be the same again.

Such is the approach of The World Was Never the Same: Events That Changed History, a captivating new course in which Professor FearsÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â¥a master storyteller and one of the most popular instructors on our Great Courses facultyÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â¥provides you with 36 of the most important and definitive events in the history of the world.
