Note: This plug-in is only compatible with 32-bit versions of Photoshop.

Enlarge2X is a super-resolution filter from Topaz Vivacity, an old collection of Photoshop plug-ins no longer available for sale or trial. The other filters have since been replaced by superior ones obtainable elsewhere (by legal and not-so-legal means), so I didn't bother including those.

Instructions: Copy the .dll file to Drive:\Windows\system, and place the .8bf file in *Photoshop directory*\Plug-ins\Filters. You'll find Enlarge2X under Filter > Topaz Vivacity.
