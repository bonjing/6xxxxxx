Guest Stars --- Franchot Tone and Irene Ryan


This is one of 3 public domain episodes I'll be uploading.

So the film quality is un-remastered though very watchable.

For some reason the opening themes are missing from these copies. 
The end theme is missing on two of them as well, but it's included 
with this episode from the Fifth Season.  

The 6th year was the first to also finally have new drawings 
in the opening credits to also include Frank McGrath and Terry Wilson,
who were the only actors to be with the show for the entire 8 years.

That opening can be found on You Tube if you want to see how it looks:
