In the name of Allah, Most Compassionate, Most Merciful. All praises are
due to Allah; we praise Him; we seek His help; we seek His forgiveness; and we
seek His guidance. We seek refuge in Allah from the evil in our souls and the
badness of our deeds. For whomever Allah guides, there is none to lead him
astray. And for whomever He allows to go astray, there is none to guide him. I
bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, for whom
there is no partner. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and
Messenger.
