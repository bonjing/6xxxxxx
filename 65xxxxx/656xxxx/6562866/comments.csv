,Fabrix7777,2011-07-26T04:22Z,"@ heyYou88    Why you have to ask such a stupid question? 
Mkv
* supports H.264/AVC
* B-Frame support
* supports variable audio bitrate
* supports chapters, muxed subtitles, metadata/tags and dvd-like menus
Use google next time!"
,HeyYou88,2011-07-26T05:27Z,Yet I can't play the crap on my PS3. 
,emw13bball,2011-07-26T06:24Z,"then convert it to whatever format you'd like? mkv, as Fabrix7777 points out, is much better!"
,_pekkaaaa_,2011-07-26T07:39Z,I play .mkv files with PS3 Mediaserver and it works fine.. Thanks!
,hitnrun4fun,2011-07-30T02:07Z,"IN ORDER TO PLAY .MKV ON THE PS3 YOU NEED:
""MKV2VOB""
search for it @ TPB or Google

sold my PS3 to start a revolution that will deep fry the dog and eat the mother's face of CINAVIA"
,ananas5000,2011-08-05T12:40Z,last few seconds are missing 
,mrdaan11,2011-08-30T14:29Z,Last few seconds aren't missing. Watch the episode and you'll know why it looks like something is missing. It's not the uploaders fault.
