,7vincent7black7,2011-08-28T05:53Z,"Hey this torrent works great until it suddenly self updated after I left the game the first time and tried to start playing later on. It updated supposedly up to 4.0.0 but actually updated to 4.2. All of a sudden my worldvortex account was a free trial and they didnt even give me the courtesy of asking a member via whisper, when I started my new character, because my old one and hte free server were awol, if I was starting from the beginning or what expansion I was in if not. Any ideas how to get it back to what it was before?"
