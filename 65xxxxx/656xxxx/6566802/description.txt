This time Max and Stacy look at the one in 66 Americans now classified as psychotic and the matter of 'selective default' as the over prescribed anti-psychotic medication for financial marketss. 

In the second half of the show, Max talks to Adrian Salbuchi about the similarities between the financial attack on Greece and what happened to Argentina in 2001/2002.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
