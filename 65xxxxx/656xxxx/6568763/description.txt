Art Pepper (1925â€“1982) was called the greatest alto saxophonist of the post-Charlie Parker generation. But his autobiography, Straight Life, is much more than a jazz bookâ€”it is one of the most explosive, yet one of the most lyrical, of all autobiographies. This edition is updated with an extensive afterword by Laurie Pepper covering Art Pepperâ€™s last years, and a complete and up-to-date discography by Todd Selbert
