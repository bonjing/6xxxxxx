,User897,2011-07-27T05:14Z,"Actually, the blu-ray is not available, because the person that upped doesn't know how to fucking seed.

Thanks for this in the meantime, though.  These days, there is NO REASON for splitting a movie file, so I thank you for the single file."

It somewhat follows in line with great comedic slapstick's such as Spaceballs, Taledega Nights, Year One and Tommy Boy. However it will not go down in cinematic history as a great achievement. Still it is worth watching. If you are not a fan of comedic adventure's then this is not for you. Also this was filmed using real castles with some breathtaking scenery!! You should watch the last minute of the credits for exact filming locations as I was very impressed. Here are my ratings: A=8, V=9, M=7   "

,loosenoose,2011-09-11T18:39Z,"Why is everyone bagging the movie? What were you guys expecting? A Stanley Kubrick masterpiece? It's a comedy for fuck's sake. I enjoyed it for a laugh because that's what I was watching it for.

Perfect quality by the way. I watch all of extremezone's stuff through a PS3 and I've never noticed anything wrong with them. Great work, dude. Cheers. "

 you worthless troll, go fuck yourself and the media controling families you work for."
,crystal_fan_01,2011-09-13T21:08Z,"(a) Thx, extremezone, you rock. I always choose your torrents, they're quality.

(b) people are ""bagging"" this movie because it sucks donkey balls. One of the requirements of being a ""comedy"" is that it be funny. It doesn't have any appeal to anyone with either an age or IQ over 12. Seriously, go watch the Hangover or Bridesmaids again. Even on the fourth go around, both are still better than this one.

Given its 24% approval on rottentomatoes, critics agree. Or, if you'd rather the public, given it's $26 million return on a $50 million film, everyone else agrees too. It's a waste of two hours of your life.

Not extremezone's fault though :)"

Great movie, has its funny moments. Great for people with a craving for 'weird' or abstract humor.

Great upload. Thanks ExtremeZone"
