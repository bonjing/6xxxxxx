The release of the four-disc Unreleased Art, Vol. VIâ€”Blues for the Fisherman, providing, for the first time, Pepper's complete two- night appearance at Ronnie Scott's London, June 27 and 28, 1980. The history of these recordings rates an article itself. These sides were recorded by the owners of the local Mole Jazz Record Store, who were intent on starting their own recording label with with Art Pepper performances. Pepper's contract with Galaxy records prevented this music from being released under Pepper's name and further disallowed the release of any Pepper compositions previously recorded by Galaxy. Ultimately those performances able to be released were provided under pianist Milcho Leviev's name, Blues for the Fisherman (Mole, 1980) and True Blues (Mole, 1981). Not until now has the entire two evenings' four sets of music been released, making this a most important addition to the Art Pepper discography.
Blues for the Fisherman was recorded on the final two nights of a two week stretch booked at Ronnie Scott's
