Taglines: The story begins 

Genres: Action | Adventure | Drama | Sci-Fi 

Movie Nfo - In 1962, Charles Xavier starts up a school and later a team, for humans with superhuman abilities. Among them is Erik Lensherr, his best friend... and future archenemy. 

More Nfo - Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-MEN.

I am also downloading and encoding stuff for you guys like crazy. I am constantly filling up my hard drives, and I am about have to get another 500 GBs. I am doing my best to fill everyones requests, and in the meantime, I am trying expose everyone to my personal taste in tv-shows, movies, and porn. lol.  I am also trying to widen everyones horizons / preferences and help you consider watching things that you might not have watched without someone insisting. (^_^)
