We open with Fijian minister of tourism Ashley telling us all about the "tropical paradise" the show will be filming from the rest of the way.

We begin with a rundown of our Final-3: Ben, Constantine and A.J. Ashley gives us a little background on her initial impressions, when her romantic feelings for each first sparked and we see a few important clips from their relationship on the show. We cut back to Ashley gazing out at the ocean while her voiceover talks about overnight dates and this week being the first time she gets to spend "private time with the guys . . . alone."...
