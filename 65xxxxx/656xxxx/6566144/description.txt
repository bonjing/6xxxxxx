This is the hotfix that allows Ultimate Traffic2 to run after 6/1/2011. Without this patch, you must set your computer date to a date before June 1st to see AI planes. I found this elsewhere but TPB has no active trackers posted so I un-rar\'d it and am re-posting it for those who haven\'t been able to find it.
