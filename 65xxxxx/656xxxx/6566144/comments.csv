,aarque,2011-07-27T05:10Z,"Glad it works for you and cool about the ngx, Jim. UT2 schedules are fairly cheap at approx $6 US, available from Flight1 or whoever. It doesn't seem like people share or torrent schedules and I don't really care if mine is current so long as it looks right with accurate liveries and all.
 I wouldn't mind, however, learning how to compile my own schedules. I'll even upload them here if someone teaches me..."
