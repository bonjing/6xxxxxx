My only gripe however...

Why did you feel the need to split this into 7 different parts ?? Makes viewing slightly difficult!!"
[T],bzingaz,2011-07-27T04:59Z,well i only do it because i have low bandwidth. and if it is in parts seeding becomes easy..  well i can combine it in single file too . if anybody has more opinion please suggest
