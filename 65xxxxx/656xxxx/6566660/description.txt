[This vs PortableAppz]
- this version is truly "stealth": PortableAppz's version leaves folders in 
AppData > Local and registry keys.
- this version contains "Ashampoo Burning Studio 10 Theme Pack", which adds
additional Animated DVD and Blu-ray Disc Menus, Autoplay Editor Menus, Disc 
labels, Cases and Booklets, Logos and Subtitles, and Ashampoo Burning Studio 10 
Program Skins .. all this fully implemented within the Portable/Stealth format.

* Im a fan of PortableAppz but he does not care about detail and many of his 
apps don't work correctly or leave traces behind which is the whole point of 
using Portable Apps. I wish he would spend more time testing vs. quantity.
