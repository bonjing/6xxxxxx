The remains my favorite McLaughlin album, + it's god Larry Young on organ! I remember that I had to special order this back in the day and wait a few weeks to get it. Douglas distribution wasn't very good back then.

Even though I've still got the LP and a CD copy, I think I'll download this one.

Many thanks!"
