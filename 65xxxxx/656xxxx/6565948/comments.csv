I skimmed through the beginning, middle, and end...
Audio: Not out of sync.
Video: The quality is what you would expect for 350 MB 45 min.

Thanks. "

This is the one - accept no substitutes. Well worth the wait.

Finally, a decent copy that is both watchable and doesn't mess up my hardware player.

Ive tried tweaking every other version and they all sucked. Found an MKV that looked fine until the sound went out of sync after 5 mins."
