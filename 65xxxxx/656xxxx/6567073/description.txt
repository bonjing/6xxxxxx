100 Miles from Memphis is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Sheryl
Crow. The album was written and produced by Crow, Doyle Bramhall II and Justin Stanley
and features the musicians Tommy Sims and Chris Bruce. On this album she puts aside her
country and pop-rock past in favor of a vintage Memphis-styled, soul-inspired record.
Although proficient on such instruments as bass, piano and guitar, Crow concentrates on
singing throughout the album, which features some covers, including Citizen Cope's
"Sideways" and The Jackson 5's "I Want You Back"
