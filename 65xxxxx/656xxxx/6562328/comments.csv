,axiomhell,2011-08-16T05:28Z,it says to select the file downloaded to write to imgburn. the file i got was a .rar file and is too big for my blank disc. Im a newbie ( gotta start somewhere) and was wondering what if anything am i doing wrong.

Is your disk holds less then 3.48 GB (most DVD=Rs hold 4.7 GB while CDs hold 700MB) you can add the file to a new folder, name it Windows 7 or something. Then right click the folder and choose ""add to archive"" Assuming you have WinRAR, if not, download it, it's free. 
I always set the compression method to ""best"".    Then depending on if you're using a CD or DVD disk, set the ""Split to volumes, bytes"" to either ""CD"" or ""DVD+R"" option if your DVD holds less then 3.48GB.
This will split the ISO file into multiple files which you can install to seperate disks and hopefully use in the correct order. WinRAR will lable them in order too. "
