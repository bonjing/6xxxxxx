Sounds nothing like "Midnight at the Oasis," but there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, it sounds like she's been taking voice lessons from Bonnie Raitt. Bonnie does guest vocals on one song, Huey Lewis plays *great* blues harmonica on another. Great blues guitar from Cranston Clements all the way through. Best songs are Home of the Blues, Somebody Was Watching Over Me, Can't Pin Yo' Spin On Me. Well, Well, Well and Strange and Foreign Land (both with Mavis Staples) are also standouts. If you like slow and mid-tempo swamp blues, this one won't disappoint.
