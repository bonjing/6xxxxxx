,superleech,2011-07-31T21:13Z,"This is a very good movie. I loved it. Someone described it by saying imagine if Kick-Ass and Juno had a baby, which I found accurate. Its a comedy/drama not an action movie. Here is the plot:
After his wife falls under the influence of a drug dealer, an everyday guy transforms himself into Crimson Bolt, a superhero with the best intentions, though he lacks for heroic skills."
,superleech,2011-07-31T21:14Z,Oh btw thnx BOZX.
