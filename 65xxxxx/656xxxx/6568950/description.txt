Nordenstam's voice led to early comparisons with artists such as Rickie Lee Jones and BjÃ¶rk. Her early albums, Memories of a Colour and And She Closed Her Eyes were jazz-influenced with elements of alternative rock. 1997's Dynamite began a more experimental path-most of the album was filled with distorted guitars and unusual beats. The sparse, open textures and her girlish voice create a unique northen woods atmosphere full of dark shadows and strange shapes.
