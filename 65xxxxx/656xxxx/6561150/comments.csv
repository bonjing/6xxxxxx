,RafVne2,2012-05-12T05:07Z,"Hi there. I've got Q. Is it easy enough to learn this program?And how good is it next to 3ds max or maya? 

I mean, will I need some tutorials, or is it quite intuitive?

 I jeep on relling myself that I finally have to learn one of the 3D software, but I can't make myself do it. I have tried 3ds max and maya,but didn't really get into it yet so I haven't learnt much yet...and it's been a while, so my 3d skills are close to none... ( with a  lot of trouble and effort I might be able to model maybe a lamp or so, that is it)
