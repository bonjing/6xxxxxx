Here is the most up-to-date non-beta version of Carrara x86 and x64 (as of 10-7-2010), for all available operating systems*, with additional Carrara content and x86/64 Render Nodes.

Only pick the files you need, you don't have to download all OS versions (although if you do, it will help with seeding!).

Enjoy, and make sure to seed. Without seeders, you would never have obtained this expensive software for free. Carrara is not as mainstream as some other 3D software, so updated versions are hard to obtain in full.
