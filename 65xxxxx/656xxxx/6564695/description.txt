Mock the Week is a British topical celebrity panel game hosted by Dara Ã“ Briain that launched in 2005. The game is influenced by improvised topical stand-up comedy, with several rounds requiring players to deliver answers on unexpected subjects on the spur of the moment.

It is made by independent production company Angst Productions and made its debut on BBC Two on 5 June 2005. Episodes regularly attract 3.5 million viewers.[1] Old episodes currently air on Dave, a fact that is frequently mentioned on the show.

It was created by Dan Patterson and Mark Leveson, the same people responsible for the comedy game show Whose Line Is It Anyway?[2] The show's theme music is "News of the World" by The Jam.
