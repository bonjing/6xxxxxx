,v3ct0r,2011-07-25T21:51Z,"Sorry guys, I'm re-uploading this, the Demonoid tracker isn't taking it as the primary tracker is UDP, not HTTP.

Will be up soon :)"
,v3ct0r,2011-07-25T22:00Z,"Nevermind, Demonoid is being sucky and won't upload it -.-

Enjoy!"
,v3ct0r,2011-07-27T13:51Z,"P.S - Series 10 is not yet complete as it is on a short break, there are a total of 5 eps + 2 compilation eps to be seen. I shall do a re-pack on the week of 20th October 2011.

I've also missed out S06E13 [Xmas Special] and S09E13 [Xmas Special] - both will be included in the repack. Also, a Comic Relief Special ep, which I'm finding hard to locate."
,v3ct0r,2011-07-28T14:23Z,"Damn not being able to edit the torrent details!

Note: Some compilation episodes aren't tagged as such, they are; 

S01E06 
S02E07 
S05E12 
S06E12 
S07E07 
S08E06 
S09E12 

Whether you still want to download them is up to you, they do apparently contain outtakes, haven't seen them for myself, yet."
