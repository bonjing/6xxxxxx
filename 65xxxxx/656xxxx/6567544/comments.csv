Excellent work with the Dub plugins improving the stability of the picture and reducing small particles and a little unfocus to a clean picture making the colours more alive to the viewer .

I analised the possible bitrates for doing the work and the wmv video type as the flv shows nice picture stability for not too much size and the fact of the file get some more size than 200 mb and maybe the video type maked possible after a few movies uploads below 200 mb that this file showed up in the normal and appropriate Movies Category and not the Other subsection of the Videos with the flv with less size files , so the intention is to improve in where it is possible the presented work keeping better quality as possible for lower sizes possibles , always taking in mind the picture stability to the viewer and for that is a first conversion work improving the bitrate and the quality and after that a carefull Dub plugins codification giving the most stability possible with quality to the picture and finally the appropriate not too much size conversion work with tests of course before the movie upload ...

Cheers and happy movie to all of you ."
