In the present day, scientists in the Arctic uncover a mysterious object with a red, white and blue motif.
 
In March 1942, Nazi officer Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) and his men invade a castle in TÃ¸nsberg, Norway, to steal a mysterious tesseract which Schmidt calls "the jewel of Odin's treasure room." In New York City, Brooklyn native Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is rejected for World War II military duty as 4F. Rogers' childhood friend, Sgt. James "Bucky" Barnes (Sebastian Stan), takes Rogers to the Modern Marvels of Tomorrow exhibition, where famous inventor Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) demonstrates an experimental flying car. Rogers slips into a recruitment center for another attempt at enlisting. When Barnes attempts to dissuade him, Rogers' fervent conviction about serving his country catches the ear of expatriate Bavarian scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci), who now works with the U.S. government's Strategic Scientific Reserve. He recruits Rogers to a squad of soldiers at Camp Lehigh in New York state, where, under Col. Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) and SSR officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), one will be chosen as the first in a "super-soldier" experiment. Phillips suggests Gilmore Hodge (Lex Shrapnel), but an act of self-sacrificing bravery by Rogers convinces Erskine to use him. In Europe, Schmidt and his scientist, Arnim Zola (Toby Jones) attempt to harness the power of the cube-like tesseract.
