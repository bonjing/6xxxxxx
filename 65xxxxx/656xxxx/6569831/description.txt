 Help! My House Is Falling Down is presented by Sarah Beeny. The series sees   
 Sarah offering advice on how to repair major structural faults, dealing with  
 subsidence or dealing with nasty pest infestation in different properties each
 week.                                                                         
                                                                               
 Sarah Beeny faces one of her most shocking properties to date as she tries to
 work her magic on a basement flat in Gipsy Hill, London. Owner Denis Richardson
 has been plagued by mysterious leaks that have turned his home into a swamp -
 where a permanent smell of sewage lingers and the faulty wiring is creating a
 health hazard. To make matters worse, Sarah discovers some of the internal
 load-bearing walls have been removed.
              
                                 Enjoy!
