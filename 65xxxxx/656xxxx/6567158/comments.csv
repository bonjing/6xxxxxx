,JohnShit,2011-08-22T19:28Z,"If you're reliant on ebooks to help you win arguments, you might want to make sure your argument is logically valid first - nobody should need an ebook to help them win arguments."
,ayuz,2011-09-09T23:11Z,thx m8
,dborn,2011-09-18T07:02Z,Haha. This is great. cheers mantesh

,xsimpson19x,2011-10-02T03:15Z,This one is definately a golden one....... Thanks Mantesh
,ShootToKill,2011-10-02T11:21Z,This is really stupid; just explains a few logical fallacies. You can easily look up logical fallacies on Wikipedia and gain same info.
,programa,2011-10-08T03:14Z,å¤šthere is an audiobook version of this book?
,dkforu69,2011-10-12T16:20Z,thanks
,krutok,2011-10-13T08:09Z,"@Tamarind77: ""Does this include arguing with your girlfriend or wife?""

Sorry, but these creatures are illogical by nature and won't give a crap if you, her or anyone else is logically correct or not. "
,CallMeJHWH,2011-10-14T02:19Z,"@ krutok

well put. 

I will personally use this book to strengthen my internet arguments and my Call of Duty shit talking. First on my list is the Taylor Swift section of Youtube. BooYah, bitches!"
,aerozol,2011-10-21T10:39Z,"@ krutok, It's not because they're illogical, but because they probably aren't arguing about the issue itself, but rather what it (eg your disagreeing with them) represents emotionally/ to your relationship.

That sounds stupid, but you can avoid a shit-ton of problems by realizing that being right often isn't the most important thing. It took me a long time."

,AdiNiste,2011-11-04T12:36Z,these here are some of the funniest comments I've read so far...anywhere...lol!
,Bob__Dole,2011-11-12T09:25Z,"You would only win arguments using this book's advice if you are arguing with someone who is simultaneously not using this books advice, but regardless argues like the author thinks a person would, and yet responds to arguments like the author would.

In other words, if everyone wasn't batshit crazy there would be no need to argue at all."
,4wd-gt-turbo,2011-11-27T19:44Z,If 2 people read this ebook and then proceed to have an argument will the world end???
,DoctorYou,2011-12-07T23:51Z,"@aerozol Good words of wisdom, shit happens...so do arguments, but as @aerozol said, being right is not the important thing, it is keeping the peace. To win an argument with the opposite sex is like walking into a tunnel to the point where darkness engulfs you. Confused by the illogical processes that are taking place, you suddenly you think you got it and see the light ahead of you, the smirk on your face starts to rise..............when it dawns that the light you see aint the end of the tunnel...it's an oncoming train!!  

Simply agreeing to disagree in your mind, you diffuse the argument by not entering the tunnel in the first place, but to take them down early in debate with ""I'm sorry, You right""

Be nice to the girl, girl go gagga for you ;)"
,Poseidon_M_Hernandez,2012-01-08T20:25Z,"Don't let anyone on the YouTube comments section know about this book, please."
,wontpayforit,2012-04-06T05:58Z,"If everyone reads this book, there will be no more  arguments which could possibly be won. ;)"
,mrloorus,2012-04-07T13:08Z,"this is great, dude. nice share haha"
