Develop your own counseling style using Corey's bestselling "Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy". You will see the major theories of counseling (psychoanalytic, Adlerian, existential, person-centered, Gestalt, reality, behavior, cognitive-behavior, family systems, feminist and, and postmodern approaches) as they are used in practice through a case study focused on one client, "Stan." The case of "Stan" appears in each chapter so you can see how the theory presented in that chapter informs therapeutic decision-making. "At a Glance" charts pinpoint the major differences between theories in areas such as multicultural focus, basic philosophies, and limitations.
