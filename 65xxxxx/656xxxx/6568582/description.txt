On this self-cover album, acclaimed composer Joe Hisaishi covers his own works he penned for motion picture soundtracks, TV show soundtracks and commercials by re-interpreting them on the piano. Includes the first ever piano versions of soundtrack themes for two of the most recent Hayao Miyazaki hit films, "Spirited Away," and "Princess Mononoke." Also includes his other signature works such as "Brother" (from the Takeshi Kitano film), "Quartet" (from Joe Hisaishi's own directorial debut), and "Summer" widely heard in Japan through a Toyota commercial. It's an excellent album for both newbies and hardcore fans alike since the track selection suggests Hisaishi's best-of compilation, but at the same time, these tracks are all alternate versions.
