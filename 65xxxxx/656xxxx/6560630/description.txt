    God and Satan are on a train discussing the fate of three                
    individuals. The stories of the people in question are told in a trio    
    of very strange vignettes. One involves an insane anylum with some       
    very interesting treatment plans. Another involves a 'death club'.       
    The final story shows us the adventures of a server of Satan. This is    
    a strange movie.
