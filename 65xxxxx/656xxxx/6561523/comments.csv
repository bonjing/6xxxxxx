If you want to have this in iTunes (just an example as most people do use iTunes and iPods...) you just have to feed this file to a converter (XLD is one I can recommend for Mac users) and any respactable software will do the rest for you. It will still be lossless (only using ALAC not FLAC), will be playable in iTunes and iPods and it will be AWESOME!

(some people do still think Bitrates over 320 kB/s tend to go more in the general direction of Voodoo and are only required for editing purposes.... F*** them...)"
