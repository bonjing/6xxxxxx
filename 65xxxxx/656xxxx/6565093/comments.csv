,rippervanwinkle,2011-08-11T11:54Z,"This is a fake.  It isn't ripped from a Blu-Ray (the movie has never been released on BR) or even from a DVD.  It's a cam job of a film projection but recorded with an HD cam.  Is that exclusive enough for you.  There are lots of artefacts such as scratches and foreign objects on the print which don't appear on the DVD or Blu-Ray.  Here are a couple of uncompressed screen to illustrate this:

Check out the big yellow scratches in the middle.  They don't exist on the DVD and don't appear when the movie is broadcast.  Some of the scenes in this cam rip are of *very* damaged print, rather like if it was a shitty old print being prohjected by some goons in an Indian cinema.  Weird huh?

The movie on DVD does not have hard coded subs.  This fucking idiot kamal and the fucking idiot DDR release group even watermark their lame DDR tags at random places in the movie.  Assholes.

The DDR tag is a useful way to identify a rip as one to avoid.

Another fuck up by kamal and the other incompetents at Dumbest Desi Releasers.

If you want something done to a really low standard but with maximum bragging and shameless lying then ask a desi release group, they won't let you down.
