,tobenot71,2011-07-23T22:32Z,"OK, so no good at all?"
,drive-786,2011-07-24T04:11Z,"who an where  do u get audacity,??? "
,hoebywan,2011-07-24T05:14Z,I doubt it is audacity much more likely blind ignorance.
,TheDutchJesus,2011-07-24T10:03Z,Bluray Rip..............MY ASS
,useitright,2011-07-24T12:12Z,"Even thought I am not going to download this torrent.....I was curious as to why no one has judged the quality of this.  I mean, of course, from the comments you can tell its not a blu-ray and it also seems to have hardcoded korean subtitles so it is not going to be a choice for most anyway, but for those who do choose it for what it is or has would more than likely like to know more than it is not a blu-ray........right??   Just a thought "
,TheDutchJesus,2011-07-25T09:58Z,"Maybe we can't express the way you can, we don't all come from a English speaking country.  
this is just a thought too !!"
,vasanthgb,2011-07-25T18:08Z,amen to that. 
,shasha2333,2011-07-31T04:16Z,"the dvdrip is better quality than this, this sure as hell did not use a bluray for source, it used hdrip korsubs, which would should be named sdrip korean bullshit"
