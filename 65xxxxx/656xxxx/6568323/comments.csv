,call_me_nobody,2011-07-28T20:09Z,"lol, the creators minimum donate was a cent:P

But i donated a dollar^^ and just to tell the reason i did it:

I had about a dollar left on my prepaid visa card, and why not donate the little i had left there to a game company?:P the card's expiration date was a few days from now and i just paid it to get the card out of my wallet:P"
