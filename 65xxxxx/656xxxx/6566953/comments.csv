,shelbylab,2011-07-27T05:20Z,Thank you LIG. Been waiting for this. Your the best.
,shelbylab,2011-07-31T18:23Z,Any reason movie is 1920 x 540. TV canât  put the 2 images together correctly. If I  re-encode  to 1920 x 1080 the 3d is off sync and unwatchable. Your 3D movies are usually top notch. Any chance for a new release in a TV ready resolution. It would be much appreciated. Any one else having this problem?

,je0shua,2011-09-10T04:00Z,"Looks like crossedeyes (wide Right|Left) format, not standard SBS (Full Left|Right). MPC can stretch from wide to full, but it can't replace L/R. Is there a player (like youtube player) to do that?"
,je0shua,2011-09-10T17:38Z,"...I found Stereoscopic Player to do that, I'm using 1.7.1 found on btjunkie, but it don't do subtitles. Still looking."
,bv_abhi,2011-10-11T06:02Z,This is Over/Under(O/U) rather than Side-by-Side(SBS) Try to play this in your tv setting in O/U 3d settings it will play right
,MVC78,2011-11-26T00:34Z,"It's 3D, it's was just encoded for Right/Left SBS viewing instead of the default for most TVs which is Left/Right SBS. If you have option to switch to Right/Left on your TV then do it and you'll see it's fine. Although the 3D isn't that highly defined as it is in say Avatar or Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 2"

,cllnsbtty,2011-12-17T16:53Z,"Thank you LiG, watched it, the 3d is not very good, and how do I seed a movie please :)"
