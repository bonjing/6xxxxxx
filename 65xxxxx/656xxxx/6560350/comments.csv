,momo828,2011-08-03T19:41Z,"The autorun doesn't work. When I open the auto run in powerios and click install, it gives me the error message ""***MISSING MESSAGES*** ...IDS_AUTORUN and IDS_CANT_FIND"" If I try running the setup.exe it begins the install using the wizard and works fine until 37% when it tells me that the file data2.cab is missing.  Any help?"
,need5,2011-08-04T17:33Z,well wait for some time I am searching for a solution for your problem
,Gamer12356,2011-08-08T22:06Z,"momo828, i got the same problem, but then i saw what i did wrong. i didnt mount the game. open powerios, then open the file: command and conquer generals disk 1, from where the torrent was downloaded to, and then, on powerios, in the submenu where it says ""New, Open, Save, etc."" you will see the option Mount. Click on it, and set the number of drives, at least one. Then click on it again, and then there should be a new option that says ""Mount Image to drive..."" then do what the notepad instructions tell you to do from there. then, once you are done installing this game, simply go to the submenu in powerios, click on mount, go to set number of drives, and then click disable."
