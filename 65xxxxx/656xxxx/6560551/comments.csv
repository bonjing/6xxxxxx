,cotelelus,2011-07-23T20:53Z,Low quality!
,User897,2011-07-24T00:15Z,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS!!!

This is TERRIBLE QUALITY, too dark, and NOT WORTH IT!

A=0/V=0"
,rcr29budcar,2011-07-25T08:41Z,"Actually, its the same copy as the best one that has been put up so far.  I been watching the net very close for a better copy.  This is not a better copy.  Like I said, its the only decent copy.  This is the best copy availiable on the net! Period.  It is dark in places, but the movie is good enough quality to sit and enjoy if you've not seen it. And it downloaded for me in 10 mins.  Depends on your connection and how many seeders. "
,rcr29budcar,2011-07-26T06:02Z,"Oh, and an honest rating for audio and video...
A-7
V-6.5
Just keep in mind that its a CAM. Its not gonna be in full 1080p.  People expect too much out of bootleg movies.  And like I said in my earlier post, its a very watchable copy. You won't find a better copy than this on the net anywhere right now.  This is the same one everyone else has."
,dmnrocha2,2011-08-02T08:16Z,What language is the .srt?
,dmnrocha2,2011-08-02T08:34Z,"Russian subs. Really guy?
A:5
V:4

,echo873,2011-08-04T16:19Z,"Hey dumb shits. Every time it says ""TS"" it means it's the same TeleSynced shit. Another clue being the fact that they're 1.56 GiB in size all of them.

Don't even bother trying it."
,appercept,2011-08-16T07:55Z,The subs are in BULGARIAN. Just want to make it clear :)
