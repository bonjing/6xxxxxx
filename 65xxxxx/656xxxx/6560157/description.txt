Description:Jay Rock is set to release his Strange Music debut album, Follow Me Home, and cement his place at the forefront of the New West movement. As the premiere artist with Top Dawg Entertainment, the Watts native made a name for himself through mixtapes and caught the attention of XXL Magazine (which named him one of their Top Ten Freshmen) as well as that of Tech N9ne and Strange Music. Follow Me Home features musical heavyweights like Lil Wayne, Chris Brown, Rick Ross and will.i.am. With songs like â€œHoodâ€™s Gonna Love Itâ€ and â€œAll My Lifeâ€, Jay Rock is able to convey an honest grit through an intelligent storytelling that separates Jay Rock from so many other artists. Jay Rock brings a hard-edged yet accessible sound thatâ€™s straight from the streets.
