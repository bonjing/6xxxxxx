Indeed, all praise belongs to Allah. We praise Him, seek His
Aid and His Forgiveness and we seek refuge in Allah from
the evil of ourselves and from the evil of our actions.
Whomsoever Allah guides, none can misguide; and whomsoever
Allah leaves unguided, none can guide thereafter. I
bear witness that there is no god (nothing has the right to be
worshipped) except Allah, who is alone without partners,
and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.
