ALL praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, the Most
Merciful, the Beneficent, and the Master of the Day of
Judgment. O Allah! Have Your Salat and Salam (peace) and
blessing upon Your slave and Messenger Muhammad and
upon all of his companions.

Motivational speakers  have traditionally focused in their speeches on strategies and  guidelines to achieve success in this world. While these strategies may  help produce some limited benefits in this life, they fail to consider  the life to come. As Allah, The Most High said â€œKnow that the life of  this world is but amusement and diversion and adornment and boasting to  one another and competition in increase of wealth and children â€“ like  the example of a rain whose [resulting] plant growth pleases the  tillers; then it dries and you see it turned yellow, then it becomes  [scattered] debris. And in the Hereafter is severe punishment and  forgiveness from Allah and approval. And what is the life of this world,  but a deceptive enjoyment?â€ In this audio presentation, Dr. Abu Ammenah  Bilal Phillips discusses the true meaning of success and seven of the  habits possessed by truly successful people â€“ those who, through  revelation, were promised Paradise.
7 Habits of Truly Successful  People is not only an inspiring and soul energizing program, but a  strong reminder and a road map to Islamic excellence.
