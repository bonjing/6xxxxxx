With its distinctive appearance and innovative design features, the Bulleid Light Pacific has become an instantly recognizable icon of mid-20th Century British steam.

The locomotive was designed by Oliver Bullied of the Southern Railway to the Pacific 4-6-2 configuration, and production ran from 1945 to 1951. During this time 110 examples were built and most served on routes in the south of England, including the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (SDJR), and on lines serving London and the whole of the south coast. Many were named after Royal Air Force bases and squadrons, earning them the nickname Battle of Britain class.

The most obvious innovation in the design is the air smoothing bodywork, giving the locomotive a streamlined appearance. This was designed (as well as looking smart) to enable the type to be washed quickly and easily in carriage washes along with passenger carriages, but created its own unique problems in terms of maintenance, and many examples were later rebuilt without the special bodywork. Other innovations included a chain-drive from the valve gear to the center drive axle and American-style welded plate wheels instead of spoked wheels.

The Light Pacifics continued to serve until the final days of steam in Britain, and as such became a familiar sight to rail enthusiasts and commuters alike.
