Yank Rachell  Blues Mandolin Man 
Recorded: 1986
Label: Random Chance/Blind Pig
Format: Mp3@ 320 
Time: 41:00 min.


Blues Mandolin Man puts Yank with a full band for seven of the nine tracks. The other two are acoustic numbers with Peter Rollerâ€™s guitar, Peter â€œMadcatâ€ Ruthâ€™s harmonica wizardry, and, of course, Yank doing his thing. To round out the rest of the band is Leonard Marsh, Jr. on drums and Yankâ€™s granddaughter Sheena Rachell on bass. Not too many instruments, but just enough to make it blue.
There is an amazing thing on this album: tempo. Every song keeps your foot tappinâ€™ along no matter where the tempo is. Find a picture of Sleepy John Estesâ€™ house in Brownsville, Tennessee, and you could picture this music coming off the front porch in the mid 1980s. But the bass and drums keep you movinâ€™ from song to song no matter how hot that summer got down there
This contains fine material by one of the few great mandolin bluesmen.
