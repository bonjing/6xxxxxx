,redback38,2011-07-26T17:08Z,"im mainly lookin at gettin the wireless sorted out,your specs are no better/worse than my work lappy,so if it works ok ill go ahead and do a build with the complete driver pack(latest for win7)"
,mbmalone,2011-07-27T03:50Z,"Well, it took forever to download  .... but I finally got it and booted up. There was no network support installed and I could not use the device manager to see which devices were installed. ... besides that, it looked nice. Had browsers, but couldn't surf :-("
,redback38,2011-07-27T10:49Z,"dammit,the drivers injected nicely,i checked em before i posted it,in the bottom left corner of ur desktop theres a quick launch shortcut for PENetwork(its the network manager for this system).(god please tell me i didnt forget to add it in the build!)if its there(ill boot my copy up in a min)open it and scan for devices:-)"
,redback38,2011-07-27T12:23Z,"yup,a great quality is to admit when you have made a mistake,in my haste to post this.....iv forgot to include PENetwork....(yes.....yes i feel stupid!)shit....as a tradeoff i tested the run again with it installed on a number of comps,as an apology,ill get version 4 out with the full driver pack requested...oh and btw?....it works great....wifi is here....and sorry,my bad..."
