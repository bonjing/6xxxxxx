NOTES: Sods law. I release the basic cam wi seriously reworked video n audio n imagine role out the line lol. Didnt like there new vid source one bit so a kept wi the video i encoded for the cam release. The new source may have an ever so slightly better crop but its just to dirty, distorted and off balance. Theres jst no way its ever gona look as good as this.

Work done:

Video: Work done last time. Resized down to 720x336 resolution and fixed the aspect ratio at the same time. Filtered out all that noise n crap. Gave it an overall sharpen. Lowered the red (cause the source is over red). Lowered contrast slightly. Rebalenced brightness so black is black. Increased saturation a notch to take the overall faded look out it.

Audio: Filtered out the excess static and tried to remove the pops n clicks. Had to do a big resync job as imagine have cropped several pieces from there video meaning this required some clever padding out. Sync is now perfect and the seams are hard to spot.No dialouge is lost at all.

End result on this is a very nice and watchable TS. Have fun n njoy peeps.
