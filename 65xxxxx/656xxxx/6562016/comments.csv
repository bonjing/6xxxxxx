,Spyke1999,2011-07-24T23:19Z,how do you boot this from flash drive
,Nitram1955,2011-07-24T23:25Z,"Seems to be a fake really. Booting is OK, but nothing but original OS can be loaded. No installation in menu. Using any of in help mentioned choices loads the Kernel and leaves blank black screen. Without anz further explanation as what to do - not worth to DL and seed."
,hgurden,2011-07-24T23:31Z,"1. to boot from flash frive you have to use a linux flash creator. 2. Option 1 launches the installation, after login to the live cd, you have to then launch Yast Live CD Installer"
,Nitram1955,2011-07-25T12:12Z,"Booted from CD. 
4 options shown on welcome screen. None of choices for Installation. Neither anz one mentioned in Help worked. The only running is the Memory test. Everything else results in frozen black screen and only restart is possible."
,hgurden,2011-07-25T12:41Z,"The installation is the very first option, it should go black then loads of text, then the license, the login"
,Nitram1955,2011-07-25T13:55Z,"1. DOwnloaded the ISO again
2. Burned new CD
3. Run first option
4. Shortly blicked black screen with 1 text row
5. Next 15 min. only black screen
CD ROM let open only after reboot.

Either some steps are not explained or something else does not work. 
Running Win7 Utimate."
