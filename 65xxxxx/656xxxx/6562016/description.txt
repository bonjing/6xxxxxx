Windows Linux 2011 release, First live CD. Microsoft first every free os, and its Linux. Just download and try it. And all of those saying Microsoft wouldn't, or its fake. Try it, what have you got to lose. 

It has WINE, which is now compatible with Microsoft Office 2007/2010.

And tons of free software. This could be the one and only release. The reason there is no advertising, is that this is in BETA stages and is only, in comparison to windows, in M1 Stages.
