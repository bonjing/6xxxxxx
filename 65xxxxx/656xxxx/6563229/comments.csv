,bball230,2011-07-26T03:27Z,Am i dreaming?? I was just wishing for this the other day!! WOW
,bball230,2011-07-26T03:28Z,"I take that back, It sucks this doesnt include the original game.. Do i need to download that too in order to play this?"
,shikibane,2011-07-26T04:18Z,@bball230 yeah you need to download borderlands to play this. All this disk has is 2 dlcs for borderlands it doesn't include the original game.
,shikibane,2011-07-26T04:23Z,@bball230 you can always get this torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6533008/Borderlands_DLC_DRM-Free_Xbox360 that someone else uploaded if you don't like mine i find using a disk to install dlcs is easier but if you wanna give this way a shot go ahead. 
,bball230,2011-07-26T13:32Z,"@shikibane, thanks man. I'm downloading both the original game and this now. 

But once i get this DLC put onto discs do i just install to the HDD? or do i have to put in the disc each time i want to play?

Does installing DLC like this increase chances of being detected and banned?"
,shikibane,2011-07-26T19:38Z,@bball230 Yeah you just install this to HDD you don't haveto put it in each time. And no i doubt it would increase the chance of you getting banned if anything it'd lower it. The other way of doing dlcs is more likely to get you banned than this in my opinion. If it helps i ran this through abgx here's a picture http://bayimg.com/oajAAaAdf. Oh and by the way enjoy i plan on uploading more dlc install disk like this in the future.
,bball230,2011-07-27T03:39Z,"Okay great! Are you limited to What you can upload to disc to install to 360?

Does the DLC that you upload have to be on a disc to begin with? Because if not, would it be possible to do things like Call of Duty Map Packs or various other things like that?

What other DLC were u planning on uploading?"
,shikibane,2011-07-27T05:11Z,"@bball230 What i mean by ""i plan on uploading more dlc install disk like this"" Is retail disk the type you buy in stores i can't make them although that'd be cool and im not sure what im going to upload yet i haveto get back to you on that."
