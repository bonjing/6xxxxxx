Discussion:-

Football Manager 2011 is without a doubt incredibly deep and engaging. The realistic feeling surrounding the entire game and massive amount of features makes it exciting and great fun, but at the same time it can easily make it daunting and tiresome. It sometimes seems to test your patience and endurance to a high degree, but for the right candidate this is a realistic, impressively in-depth and near masterful simulation of the role of a manager of a soccer team.

â– There is a very steep learning curve, and youâ€™ll be required to either have lots of knowledge of the sport or have the ability to learn.

 â– In the early hours of the game you can easily become overwhelmed and unsure of what to do first, and the hints and guidelines donâ€™t always help in this regard.

 â– There are often so many things to attend to that you can either end up neglecting certain aspects or losing a great many hours to the game â€“ despite it being addictive enough on its own. Furthermore, all these hours spent while tackling all of these activities in question might only progress you forward very little, but in the end this is the essence of the game.
