,bigbandbilly,2011-07-28T23:40Z,Thank You very much  welcome back .
,coolasad,2011-07-29T20:20Z,Welcome back. Pirate bay looked abandoned without you. Hope you stay here for good
,sheol99,2011-07-30T08:55Z,"Welcome Back! TPB feels different without you 20-40! While there are other small-sizers -- none have the best selection like you are.  Speaking as small bandwidth torrent player myself, you're a life saver!

(i have to live with 175-350MB jon-stewart while you're away!) "
[V],twentyforty,2011-07-30T19:35Z,"People who showed appreciation already migrated on SU, where I upload same things as I have here in past. I've lost appreciation for TPB when I was banned by Moderator speaking the truth and in language well above TPB standards.

Therefore, having been banned instead of all lunatics who pounded my torrents with up to FIVE THOUSAND minuses in ONE NIGHT and insulting me on all imaginable ways - I left - and as many know - I am man of word.

I use TPB as backup location only, and people who need all imaginable torrents but away from this cuckoo's  nest - migrated to SU already.

I would never ever come back. As much as this place is duller without my presence - here is enough lunatics who actually are happy as a pig in mud.

Who is ""clean"", feel free to find my e-mail in many Descriptions of TV packs, introduce yourself in short mail and ask for Invite."
,sheol99,2011-07-31T08:26Z,Oh well .. regarding your last comment: Good-bye then .. enjoy your life - you might need some zoloft or similar .. 
[V],twentyforty,2011-07-31T12:00Z,"You need something stronger, most definitely. That what you took before (writing your pathetic scribbling) obviously wore-out, and you responded as any insane person would do.

Enjoy the mud, tough. You are living proof why I called this place as 'cuckoo's  nest'."
,killeurkilleur,2011-07-31T18:57Z,"""I would never ever come back. As much as this place is duller without my presence""

lool...delusion of grandeur...with at least 10 big torrents sites, millions of people sharing you're the size of an ant...who cares you stopped uploading stuff to TPB ???? 

there are a bunch of friendly, mild mannered uploaders out there who create small files... you're not that unique , buddy...

 your ""friends"" give you the sense of being greater than you are.
"
,.ACHILLES,2011-08-02T20:50Z,well said killeurkilleur...awesome ..so true...big boo 2  20-40....haha...watch tv dude
,.ACHILLES,2011-08-02T20:53Z,r u a kid or what .....u should not respond to insane persons comments or anything if u r a real mature uploader :)
[V],twentyforty,2011-08-04T21:13Z,Like now? OK.
[V],twentyforty,2011-08-04T21:34Z,"@killeurkilleur: You and four-five idiots bullied me for months. I left. What else do you want?

And Yes - place is ""duller"" indeed - you are here and I am not.

About ants and perspective - get a grip. It's better to be surrounded with fewer, but good people than have company of idiots like you and creatures like illiterate moron who backed you up. (who quite regularly downloaded from me, but due to progressive nature of rabies suddenly decided to take a dump right here). 

ROFL"
,hakuna_matata,2011-08-04T22:14Z,"Why dont you duchebags go and fc$kurself. I dont know what to  say, but i wish I could shoot you idiots in the head. 

@20-40 .. just dont respond.. dogs bark man. that doesnt mean they want to drive the car."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-08-05T01:22Z,"@killeurkilleur, et al:
To repeat:  Not everyone who downloads illegal video files owns a high def television. Most still watch on the good old fashioned computer screen--or even netbook, judging from the vast numbers that have been sold over the last 2 years. None of them require 720p--many stutter from video/cpu overload--as does my November2009 netbook, and my 2003 desktop; both play 480p quality videos quite nicely, thank you--even on my new 23"" LCD screen. It is dipshits like you that cause good people to miss out on their favorite shows because the small-size encoders have ""left the building"". Aren't you proud of yourselves?"
,formerly_azrielle,2011-08-05T02:28Z,"@killeurkilleur, et al:
Or maybe an insult your ilk CAN understand--COWKILLERS.  BEEFEATERS.  HALFCASTES.  UNTOUCHABLES.  LEFT HAND EATERS."
