"Tony and Leonard vie for recognition as artists in their peaceful postapocalyptic village; Tony has never eaten a human being, while Leonard has consumed several recognized artists, critics, and historians, gaining their knowledge. When a stranger arrives in town and disrupts their dynamic equilibrium, Tony and Leonard must work together to cross America to save its endangered artistic heritage. Along the way, they encounter cannibal gangs, talking evangelical crows, secret government bases, and a little girl named Dracula."
