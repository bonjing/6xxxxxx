,hootieman,2011-07-25T02:01Z,why is the sample file 0 bytes?
,simon200,2011-07-25T02:11Z,every1 seems to be stuck on 97.4%
,Malevian,2011-07-25T02:31Z,I've got a couple minutes left on the download.  I'll post when done and let you know if legit and working.
,Malevian,2011-07-25T02:37Z,Whoever is in control of this is removing my posts.  Drops the bottom our of the seeders about 97.4-8%.  Will keep posting this message so everyone can see it.
,Malevian,2011-07-25T02:37Z,Hmm nevvermind.  Showed up now.  No seeders left after 97%.  ETA now about 2 hours.
,Malevian,2011-07-25T02:46Z,This one is junk.  Confirmed/completed downloads at this one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6562649/Captain.America.The.First.Avenger.2011.CAM.AVC-ERDNA
,Reviewer,2011-07-25T03:00Z,"@Malevian

Don't forget you showed us your limited intelligence as well.

Will post later on quality after watching."
,dirtp00r,2011-07-25T03:52Z,"Come on ""Reviewer"", don't be mean. I have had the same trouble myself and it's TPB site itself. So many are hitting your servers that comments have a lag sometimes. Also, every torrent-er is chomping at the floor to get this download. Looks like several versions of this torrent have down-loaders stuck at 97 - 98%, probably because of the leechers. Only a limited number are seeding. What really is needed is a way to block or limit download speed to those who don't seed. If anyone knows how, please post. I always seed as I download and continue to seed after finished (at full blast).
Oh yea, a big THANKS to the up loader!

,angelotero,2011-07-25T06:00Z,"Waiting to see but seems like 8 hours compared to my normal 1/2 hour to 1 hour download, anyway seed losers i seed double the file download size for everything leech. you leechers should at least make that small donation a practice."
,DonPoE,2011-07-25T06:16Z,"My God!! I've never seen such a bad seed to leech ratio ever!! I don't understand how there can be so many leechers but the seeding is so low. Most torrent download software automaticly seeds, all you have to do is leave it running for a couple hours. Is that really so hard to do???? Give back as much as you take. Thats the only way communities like this survive!!"
[T],ETC1337,2011-07-25T07:36Z,wow been stuck at 99.2 % For a long time now...this is definitely unusual and not the fault of seeders...some sort of counter measures me thinks...
,illwrath,2011-07-25T07:47Z,"There are no 'countermeasures' unless the poster put them in.

Me thinks he's just being a POS."
,illwrath,2011-07-25T07:51Z,"Take away this asshole's green skull, pronto."
,FreePir4t3,2011-07-25T07:56Z,stuck at 92.2 percent and it cant be the seeders cuz when i pause my dl the seeders shoot up to 17 but when i queue it again the seeders drop out. wtf
,FreePir4t3,2011-07-25T07:57Z,stuck at 92.2 percent and it cant be the seeders cuz when i pause my dl the seeders shoot up to 17 but when i queue it again the seeders drop out. wtf
,Luciphron_Naxtel,2011-07-25T09:50Z,WTF is this 99.2% bullshit. And why am i not seeing ne 100% complete peers?this is shit. 
,Seeder_if_you_Seed,2011-07-25T10:01Z,"To the 100%'s, you better seed now. I guess we are all stuck at 99.2 %
If this takes another day long, and yes im very patient, i'll stop this download, and call it a fake even though its not a fake, just another poster that isn't capable of seeding long enough, and/or the seeders who doesn't want or can't seed for whatever reasons they may have."
,Luciphron_Naxtel,2011-07-25T11:27Z,ditched this copy and went with .bone's almost done there will let all know how it works
,Luciphron_Naxtel,2011-07-25T11:34Z,"to all leecher's specially all the poor bastards that waited at 99.2% with me it will be much faster to download .bone's version of it. got it and works fine , still seeding and we have a large group of 100% seeders there as well.

,Luciphron_Naxtel,2011-07-25T11:42Z,"k yeah guys, to all u at 99.2% forever like i was, prob be quicker (was for me) if you go with the copy from .bone here at the bay. good copy i think and was decent download speed considering cpt. a traffic lol. Lots of 100% seeders there though, will be joining them as well. I ditched this copy."
[V],froggie100,2011-07-25T11:52Z,"someone messed with the torrent grr!!
and my server is messed up because of it "
,dazdemon,2011-07-25T13:58Z,@ froggie...dont lie..you are a noob! 
[V],froggie100,2011-07-25T16:07Z,"first mistake douch ^ 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6564249/Captain_America_The_First_Avenger_2011_CAM_XVID_AC3_-_SCR0N

working torrent stop leeching this will not get to 100% the files ont he server are gone!"
,Blackbeard42,2011-07-25T19:34Z,Froggie is legit and it isn't very fair to blame him because there are so many ppl that just DL and Ditch. Too many people don't know the golden rule of give back what you take and that is why we are all stuck at 99%. Froggie If I can get the rest of this one I wold be more than happy to seed for a few weeks and keep up the good work. I have a few from you and they have all been spot on. For those doubters take a moment to check your own stats. I sit at a constant 1.8 or better.
,illwrath,2011-07-25T22:56Z,"Sure, froggie might be legit and holy shit he spoke to criticism, but that doesn't change the face that 99% of his torrents are mis-labeled as higher quality than they really are.

To those of you who blame lack of people seeding...

Wow you're fucking ignorant as hell about how these torrents work."
,RaztaMazta,2011-07-26T18:56Z,"Hey froggie100, PLEASE SEED BRO, Im at 99.4 %, please seed... Thanx for all the good movies you upload bro."
,Andrew5k,2011-08-02T02:56Z,"I got to 100%, no sweat. Maybe it was only at the start of seeding process. Pretty good copy for a camera! A7 V7"
