Extreme Fishing with Robson Green: Series 3 World Tour
This third series of Extreme Fishing sees actor Robson Green embark on a 60,000 mile world tour in search of the planet s most incredible fishing experiences. In his most epic adventure yet, Robson s journey spans 14 countries and four continents. Along the way, he does more than just catch a lot of fish! Like never before, Robson also experiences the heart and soul of the local communities for whom fishing is not a hobby...it s survival. Amongst many things, Robson finds himself attempting to settle a score with an old nemesis in Kenya; practicing an extraordinary Octopus-fishing technique in China; dicing with death in Japan and coming face to face with the ferocious Bull Shark in Florida. Doing battle with some of the deadliest, strongest, heaviest and fastest, will he need a bigger boat?!


1)  Zimbabwe 
The actor begins his journey at Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe, where he hunts down the vundu catfish, known locally as the `steam train' because of its strength. He also examines the kapenta fishing industry, which is integral to life in the country because it provides protein for the low-income populace. In Victoria Falls, he has to prove his courage when angling for tiger fish in a deep pool called the `boiling pot', before braving the Zambezi white-water rapids

2)  Kenya 
The actor heads for the east coast of Kenya, where the Indian Ocean offers some of the best game fishing in the world. Joining a local expert, he encounters a large wahoo fish while searching for the elusive dorado, before going back to basics to learn a traditional fishing technique that consists of just lines and bare hands. Robson also visits Lake Victoria, where an unusual method is employed to catch whitebait

3)  China

At Qiando Lake he joins 100 locals in trying to land a bighead carp and samples the revered catch. More culinary experiences await as a result of Green's hunt for octopus, and he tries his hand at cormorant fishing - but has trouble restraining his bird's constant efforts to escape

4)  Sri Lanka 
The actor continues his journey in Sri Lanka, where fishing is the lifeblood of the coastal communities.
