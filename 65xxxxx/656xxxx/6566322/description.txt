Brayan's Gold is a novelette that doesn't take place in the series of The Demon Cycle, but still takes action in the same universe.

Brayanâ€™s Gold will tell the story of Arlenâ€™s first Messenger run, while he is still living in Miln and working for Cob. He is asked to carry a dangerous cargo to an isolated mine deep into the frozen mountains of Milnâ€¦ where snow demons are said to make their home.
