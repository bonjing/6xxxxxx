Largo Winch Episode 105 Sins of the Father (17 Sep 2001)

When his billionaire adoptive father is murdered, a young adventurer inherits control of the deceased man's worldwide business empire -- and his enemies.  Together with his best friend Simon Ovronnaz, the Russian computer hacker Kerensky, his father's lawyer John Sullivan, and his attractive head of security Joy Arden, Largo goes on a hunt for the international cabal responsible for his father's death, and plunges into a vortex of action and romance.  Bullets fly and heads roll in this spectacular Canadian/French action series, based on the novels and the highly successful comic book adaptations by Belgians Philippe Francq and Jean Van Hamme.

In this episode, a manufacturing facility for Group W's new microchip is blown up, and Largo must find out who is responsible.  Meanwhile, an old girlfriend shows up, claiming that her baby is Largo's child.

I produced this version by combining video from the French DVD release with audio from a VHS recording of the Canadian TV broadcast.
