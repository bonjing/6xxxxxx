                  1. TLF's release was dubbed in the Mandarin but film was              
                  originally filmed in Cantonese, our release is in its                 
                  original Cantonese. 2. TLF's release had bad colors, check            
                  the samples. We don't know what their source was but our              
                  release was from the retail hk dvd. Their release seems               
                  to lack a lot of red, making everyone look unnaturally pale           
                  and is a lot brighter causing some detail to be lost.                 
                                                                                        
                  In addition, we have the original ending that was shown               
                  in theaters in HK. TLF's was the one released in China.               
                  Apparently the studio was pressured by the Chinese                    
                  government to change the ending for the China release so              
                  that *spoiler* the bad guy doesn't get away. *end spoiler*            
                  Our ending is the original intended by the directors.
