Storyline: Every year, a bunch of grasshoppers come to the anthill and eat 
what the ants have gathered for them. The \\\\\\\"offering\\\\\\\", as the ants call the ritual, is a part of their fate. One 
day in spring, when the offering\\\\\\\'s preparation has just been finished, Flik, unliked inventor ant, accidentally 
drops the whole offered seeds into the river. The grasshoppers come and give the ants a second chance to 
collect food until fall. Flik sets off to find bugs that are willing to fight the grasshoppers (nobody expects 
him to succeed anyway) and, due to a double misinterpretation, returns with a circus crew, giving everybody 
new hope. When the misunderstanding finally gets cleared out, there is only little time left for a new plan, 
which has to work, or else...
