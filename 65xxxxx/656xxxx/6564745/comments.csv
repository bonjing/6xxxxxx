I'm now pretty sick of trying to find a decent, working copy that doesn't look and sound like crap"
,chaiyont,2011-07-26T03:03Z,"If you don't like mkv, why download it? What a whiner. Grow up!

A=10, V=9"
,bposaune,2011-07-26T09:09Z,Appreciate the reupload but still doesn't look as usual.

I know right! Your illegally trying to get something for free that you should be paying for, and all these thousands of uploaders that work 24/7 to upload the latest quality stuff for us, and they do it for free, but then they upload it all in a very popular format that 99% of people have no problem with! Its just bloody inconvenient isn't it!!

Just in case your a bigger retard than i thought, that was sarcasm!!
In other words shut up whining you ungrateful little troll and just sort your shit out, MKV plays on loads of devices and media players and its quick and easy to convert if you want to play it on something else.

**Dont lime it, dont download it, wait until christmas and buy the Blu-ray boxset for Â£40/Â£50!**

Dumb arse!!"
