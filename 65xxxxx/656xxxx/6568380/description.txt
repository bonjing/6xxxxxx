Release Description
Young-goo (Hyung-rae Sim) the son of mafia boss Don Carini (Harvey Keitel), is too foolish to be part of the mafia elite. One day, Young-goo comes to his father and is trained by Tony V (Michael Rispoli) to be his fatherâ€™s successor. A few days later, Young-goo accidentally rescues Nancy (Jocelin Donahue), the only daughter of Don Bonfante, the boss of a rival mafia family. But Vinnie (Jason Mewes), an under-boss of the Bonfante family kidnapped her and fabricates that Young-goo has taken her. Vinnieâ€™s behavior provokes an armed conflict between the two families
