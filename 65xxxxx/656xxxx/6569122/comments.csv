,giantballsack,2011-07-28T18:58Z,This is encoded from the first cam version?
,cheatsforme,2011-07-28T20:25Z,That seems to be the norm now giant so i usually wait for the R5's or unless theres a good few people saying the quality is v good for a cam (as cams have come a long way in the past 5 years :P )

,yerisan710,2011-07-28T22:56Z,"Ni Capitán América, ni misión imposible 4, ni el Gato con Botas, ni Hugo, ni Super 8, ni Tintín, en fin que ninguna de las películas producidas por la Paramount Pictures podrán ser vistas más en Venezuela.

Después de dejar a millones de fans de la saga transformers 3 sin ver la película, ahora también se suman más películas, pero el mayor desastre ha llegado cuando la productora ha emitido un comunicado en donde deja claro que ya no emitirá sus películas en el país revolucionario."
,PageEsquire,2011-07-29T03:46Z,"Can someone upload the Avengers trailer from after the credits. Please, for some reason it is being withheld from the trailer sights."
,stolen_insanity,2011-07-29T15:56Z,Goes out of sync after 29 mins.
,dielaughing,2011-08-02T08:46Z,"at the 48:00 minute mark, all of a sudden the only word i could find myself able to say is: ""GAY! GAY! GAY GAY GAY!!!!"""
,Ravensyn,2011-08-08T00:35Z,Very watchable - surprisingly good quality - keep up the good work.
,weejoe76,2011-08-11T19:16Z,"Just 40mins in and its alright!! Takes a while for the film to get going, pics a little dark here and there and the audio is spatial from time to time, no biggie!!

,SullySadface,2011-08-18T07:49Z,"@Jayzen_Freeze

No, you suck."
,Famquat,2011-08-22T05:36Z,"Autofocus is on and there is the occassional camera unfocused for a moment, it does unsync video from audio for about a minute, has a ticking noise at the beginning that either ends or I got used to it, and yet still it is very watchable.  If you don't want to wait for the DVD then this D/L is worth the time and space.

Thanks a TON Hero_No_1, great upload !!!!!!!"

,Bakaat,2011-08-27T05:33Z,"@Redemption01 -  get Peer Block. Put a shortcut into your startup folder, so you never forget to start it up manually before downloading. Your ISP should never bother you again."
