This is disc 1 (the good girl disc) of Ashlynn Brooke\'s My Plaything 2.0 interactive DVD.

The only version of this movie on TPB was in ripped AVIs, and that ruins all the fun of an interactive DVD.

It comes in ISO form, region-free, so you can either open it in a video player like VLC, mount it as an ISO and use any DVD player software, or burn it to a DVD-R and play it in another computer or DVD player. This also means it has the exact same quality as the physical disc.

Enjoy!
