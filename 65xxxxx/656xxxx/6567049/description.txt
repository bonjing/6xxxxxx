I donâ€™t think I was the only one overwhelmed by the Forgiving Iris track "Annie, Would I Lie to You" on the â€œElectronic Fieldsâ€ compilation a few years ago. I anticipated a follow-up album, which never came and realized the possibility of a one hit wonder.
But last year things started moving again for the American duo. The name change to Iris, a few demos put up on their web site and a probable official release of their material lit the hope again. Two singles were released during 1999, "Saving Time" and "Danger Is the Shame", as well as the US edition of the album. Reagan Jones and Matthew Morris have tried, and succeeded, in making a top notch synthpop production. "Disconnect" is, in a way, an Iris collection, given the tracks were written between 1994 and 1999. And it shows. Ten danceable, uptempo tracks with almost equal hit potential. The album radiates pure song strength from beginning to end and the vocals are as good as they come. No weak points to be found.
When it comes to electronic pop music, it doesnâ€™t get much better than this. Maybe "Disconnect" will even appeal to some of the synthpop sceptics too, because of the dance sound and the sing-along refrains. Either way, itâ€™s Americaâ€™s Most Wanted right now.
