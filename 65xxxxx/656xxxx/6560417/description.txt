Plot
----
After her snobby schoolmates accidentally send her into a coma, poor little Kathy has only one way to get even--with her mind. Eva, another schoolgirl, falls under the spell of Kathy's vengeful psyche, which is capable of horrible destruction using telekinesis and even killer snails to do her bidding. Soon the hallways at St. Mary's School are filled with screaming, and there's no way to escape.
