,wolfrick1,2011-07-24T00:47Z,"Fake? cause it looks fake only 571MB, looks fishy! not to mention real run time is 2hours and 5 mins"
,AriGold45,2011-07-24T01:40Z,"I'm not sure about the file size, but on CAMs the run time is routinely shorter than the time listed on IMDB.  Usually CAM's don't run all the way through til the end of the credits which would cut about ten minutes off on average."

,dinosaur58,2011-07-24T06:03Z,"Patience people, English line should be here soon. Is there a flicker like in the recent Harry Potter release? Also could someone put up screens that are larger than thumbnail?"
,craziqbn,2011-07-24T06:27Z,Its not tht bad but unfortunately my Italian is rusty...Ciao'
,violentjoe,2011-07-24T06:51Z,Quality is low but watchable and it's all in italian >< wish i would have checked before downloading. 
,dinosaur58,2011-07-24T06:56Z,"Ok, DL'd - Slight flicker, somewhat blurry, 2 chair backs in foreground, tilted ~10 dregrees from horizontal. An OK starting point for the release groups in spite of low resolution. Sorry no image hosting membership for screens.
A - italian/V6 [compared to other CAMs] Would be 6+ but for low res."
,blu3er,2011-07-24T08:54Z,this gay who the fuck put out a new movie in Italian
,Redt0rrent,2011-07-24T11:34Z,"Is in Italian because someone from US, Canada hasn't CAM-ed it yet. Thanks for your time."
,GrosShadock,2011-07-24T12:29Z,"It is in Italian because, as Madonna use to say on her t-shirts ""Italians do it better"".

Personnaly, I'm surprised Russians were not, this time, the first one to get it. What happened to you, Russian Champions of CAMs ?

Anyway, congratulation to you Italians... now the US version should arrive soon since it only need one American to record the sound in an theatre and add it on top of your video."
,ChasUGC,2011-07-24T12:41Z,"Patience my friends, remember its free. Thanks tchouseup."
