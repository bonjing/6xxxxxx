Is your life path lit by your inner candle flame, or are you stumbling along in the dark? In Dr. Wayne Dyerâ€™s new video lecture, he reminds us of what so many people easily forget in the day-to-day grind of lifeâ€”that material success isnâ€™t what weâ€™re ultimately trying to achieve, and therefore it shouldnâ€™t be our driving force. Within each of us lies success and inner peace, which can be found once we understand that a deeper, richer life experience is characterized by a burning desire, or as Dr. Dyer describes it, an â€œinner candle flame.â€ In this thought-provoking video, Dr. Dyer offers simple ways to change your lifeâ€”and your outlook on life. 

The ten principles presented here apply to people who are just beginning their journey of discovery, as well as those who have already embarked on lifeâ€™s winding path. Dr. Dyer urges us to listen with an open heart, and to apply the secrets that resonate with them and discard the rest. By doing so, weâ€™ll learn to feel the peace of God that truly defines success.
