,KiyowaraKush,2011-07-24T01:49Z,is the second screenshot spoiling something?
,soot9978,2011-07-24T04:43Z,"Try living in South Korea where you can't even watch a movie at the movie theater without hardcoded Korean subs.  I guess on the plus side, it makes the subs easier to ignore because I'm so used to them.  Thanks for the upload!"

,torrento_don,2011-07-30T09:44Z,hard coded sub = 3/4 of the movie. thanks anyway
