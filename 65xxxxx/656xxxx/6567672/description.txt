        Shot mainly using spy cameras, this film gets closer than ever
        before to the world's greatest land predator.

        Icebergcam, Blizzardcam and  Snowballcam are a  new generation
        of covert devices on a  mission to explore the Arctic  islands
        of  Svalbard in  Norway. Backed  up by  Snowcam and  Driftcam,
        these   state-of-the-art   camouflaged   cameras   reveal  the
        extraordinary curiosity and intelligence of the polar bear.

        The  cameras are  just a  breath away  when two  sets of  cubs
        emerge  from  winter  maternity dens.  They  also  capture the
        moment when  the sea-ice  breaks away  from the  island in the
        Spring.  As one  set of  mother and  cubs journey  across the
        drifting ice in search of seals, the other is marooned on  the
        island  with  very  little  food.  How  they  cope  with their
        different fates is captured in revelatory close-up detail.

        The cameras  also follow  the bears  as they  hunt seals, raid
        bird  colonies,  dive  for kelp  and  indulge  in entertaining
        courtship  rituals.  Icebergcam  even  discovers  their little
        -known social nature  as seven bears  share a washed-up  whale
        carcass.

        Often just a paw's swipe from the play-fighting and squabbling
        bears, the  spy cameras  face their  most challenging  subject
        yet. When  their curious  subjects discover  the cameras, they
        are subjected to some comical-but-destructive encounters.

        As the  film captures  its intimate  portrait of  polar bears'
        lives, it  reveals how  their intelligence  and curiosity help
        them cope in a world of shrinking ice.
