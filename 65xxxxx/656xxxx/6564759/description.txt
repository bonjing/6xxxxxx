Carlo Trigilia's book marks a major milestone in the development of economic sociology. For the first time, we have a theoretically sophisticated and lucid account of the field's evolution from 1890 to the present. Trigilia is masterful in demonstrating the theoretical and methodological continuities from Weber, Sombart, Durkheim, Polanyi, and others to the new economic sociology of the past two decades. This is a must read not only for economic sociologists but for everyone who wants to understand the history of social theory." Fred Block, University of California at Davis "With Trigilia's book, sociology has finally returned to its original territory, after it seemed to have lost it forever to economics. With impressive erudition, the author moves from the classics to the modern debate on varieties of capitalism. Wolfgang Streeck, Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies
