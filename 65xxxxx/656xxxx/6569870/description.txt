If you're a fan of Celtic music, then Heidi Talbot's voice will likely sound familiar -- she's been the lead singer for Cherish the Ladies since 2003. On her second solo album she continues exploring a number of non-folk genres, though without completely leaving the acoustic-based context in which she has done most of her previous work. Guest musicians include folk-pop legends Boo Hewerdine and Eddi Reader, as well as former Battlefield Band fiddler John McCusker and flute/whistle virtuoso Michael McGoldrick. Talbot's breathy voice is perfectly suited to quiet songs of longing like "If You Stay" and Hewerdine's "Invisible," and she long ago learned how to make sprightly trad fare like "Bedlam Boys" her own. What's more impressive is the way she's able to deliver a hymn of grizzled regret like "Time" (the Tom Waits song) with both tenderness and convincing authority. Strangely, she fails to invest "Cathedrals" with quite the same gravitas -- Jay Clifford sang it less prettily but more convincingly with Jump, Little Children. But her version is still plenty enjoyable, and if it's the weakest track on this album -- and arguably it is -- then that just goes to show what an impressive record this is. Very highly recommended.
