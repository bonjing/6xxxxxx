,mmd123,2011-08-11T01:44Z,"now I'm curious... the other torrents that I had uploaded, everyone was saying that there were no seeds, and upon reading that, I deleted all of the torrent files I had from that batch of torrents, so whether I was actually seeding or not remains to be seen... either way, I am reuploading a ""fixed"" version of all of the torrents, so whether they were downloadable or not, here is the ""fixed"" link...
