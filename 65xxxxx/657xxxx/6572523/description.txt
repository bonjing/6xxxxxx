I discovered that the only version of this program on the entire web was one huge file that was over 6 hours long that had been passed around and uploaded on every site out there.

I thought about what a pain it was going to be to try to listen to one long 6.5 hour file. What if you lost your place, or your battery died in your mp3 player, how would you ever find your place again? Plus, there were no chapter names, no way to figure out what the contents were, and so on.

So, I went through the file, separated it into individual chapter files, located where the separation was for the 3 parts that the book is divided into, named all the files wih their proper names, created all the mp3 tags, and uploaded it here for everyone on Demonoid.

Hope you all enjoy it....!

Discover How to Stop Making Excuses and Start Taking Action Now to Get Everything You Want in Lifeâ€¦ Guaranteed

Now You Can Use Simple, Proven Techniques to get whatever you want in life, Money, Success, Self-confidence, Prestige, anything is possible...

Dear successful friend,

Why is it that some people are wildly successful, while other more talented and gifted people wallow in mediocrity?

What is the real secret to being successful?

In my many speaking engagements around the world, I often begin my presentation with a simple question.

I'll ask the audience, "How many people here would like to double their income?"

As you might guess, most of them smile and raise their hands. Then I ask, "How many people here would like to lose weight? Get out of debt? Achieve financial independence?"

Once again I get a big round of smiles and eager hands go up. Then I say, "Wonderful! You all have great goals."

You all want to make more money, spend quality time with your families, be fit and achieve financial independence.

Not only do you all want the same things, but you know what it takes to achieve them. And someday you intend to do them. Someday you'll get your finances together... 

Someday you'll make more money... Someday you'll spend more time with your family... Someday you'll achieve your goals and realize your dreams... Someday!

Wake up and smell the coffee! 

You're living on Someday Isle. And what's worse is 80% of the population is living there alongside you.

Listen, this is Survivor "Real World." If you don't vote yourself off of 'Someday Isle,' you're doomed to spend the rest of your life thereâ€”because someday never comes. 

I can show you a safe way off the Someday Isle but firstâ€¦ 

But let's start at the beginningâ€¦
I'd like to share my personal story with you so you know where I'm coming from.

You see, I started off as a young man, thinking the world owed me a living.

I certainly didn't come from money. In fact, it was rarely even discussed at home because there was none.

As a result of my limited thinking, I slaved away at hard labor jobs in construction and factory work for years before I finally got it. 

Essentially, I would show up, usually late, and leave, usually early. I thought, by just showing up and punching my card, my success would be guaranteed. 

If only I could just hang in for another 30 years until retirement. Then I'd be on easy street. Talk about limiting thinkingâ€” I was the king.

Quote:
There are a thousand excuses for failure but never a good reason.

â€”Mark Twain

Boy was I wrong. It took years before I discovered how to really succeed.

One day something happened which changed my life forever. 

As I sat shivering in my tiny apartment, on a freezing cold minus 35 Degree F night, it suddenly occurred to me that "This is my life, not a dress rehearsal."

A light bulb went off in my head. I looked around at my small one room apartment and considered the fact I hadn't even graduated from high school. 

The only work I was qualified to do was manual labor.

What an eye-opening moment for me.

At that moment I knew things were going to have to change in my life, and it would be up to me.

In other words, unless I was going to change, nothing in my life ever would.

I realized over time, I could no longer blame a situation on my difficult childhood or mistakes I had made in the past. 

I was in charge. I was in the driver seat. I had to "Stop Making Excuses!"

This simple, yet shocking revelation changed my life forever. 

From that moment on, I started accepting more and more responsibility for living my life.

Instead of only doing the minimum to get by, I now accepted full responsibility for everything from my finances, my health, and especially my future.

The very next day, I marched down to the local bookstore during my lunch break, picked up a used book, and begin a lifelong practice of buying books, information ideas, and lessons that could help me.

I dedicated my life to self-improvement and continuous learning in every way possible.

And, I stopped making excuses.

Over 80% of People do this everydayâ€¦
Over time, I learned that fully 80% of the population never accepts complete responsibility for their lives. 

The consequences of this "Stinkin" thinking, however, can be disastrous. You can destroy all your hopes for success and happiness in your life.

Imagine self-sabotaging your dreams and then turning around and blaming everything around you, but yourself. Now that's foolish thinking. 

Yet this is how most people go through life. No wonder the world is messed up.

What about your family and friends? How do your constant excuses affect them?

What are you teaching your children about life?

Like I said, after studying this for years, I found 80% of people live this way.

I'm here to tell you that "It's got to stop now." And you are the only person who can stop it.

Okay so you have 2 choicesâ€¦

1. You accept the reality of this and vow to do something about it now.

OR

2. You continue on as you have, feeling sorry for yourself and acting the "poor me" victim.

You don't have to be a victim!
I've been exactly where you are and I feel your pain. 

But if you'll let me help, we can work out a happy solution for you to get on with your new successful life. 

It all ties into the release of my new book, "No Excusesâ€”21 Ways to Achieve Happiness and Successâ€¦The Power of Self-Discipline."
