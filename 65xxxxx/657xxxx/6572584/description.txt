Remember, we have uploaded these books just for you because we wish to share them. It is only right therefore, you share them with others, and the only way you can do this, is to keep SEEDING. In other words, don't stop after you have finished the download. Check and make sure your torrent program is set to continue uploading even after the downloading has been completed. A ratio of 2.0 means you are giving back twice what you have received, the book wonâ€™t die and all our efforts have not been wasted but 5.0 would be outstanding. We do our bit and you do your bit, sounds fair, doesn't it. If you are new to this and don't understand, type a message at the bottom and if I can't help, I know someone who can.
