Release Notes....: Thanks to the new rules you can enjoy a 0.08% AR error on The Soup releases as compared to old rules which forced 
                   1280x720 resolution where the AR error was 2.57%. As for the "READNFO", the ending is not cut prematurely. Joel's 
                   voice bleeds over into the next show intro, Fashion Police. If it wasn't for Joan River's ugly mug I might have 
                   considered leaving it in. All you miss is Joel saying "goodnight".
