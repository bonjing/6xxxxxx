If you don't already use ÂµTorrent, download it. http://www.utorrent.com/ 

Once installed, you will get the option to do a speed test, do the test and save the settings. 

Once you have saved them, open up 'Options' then 'Preferences'. 

On the left of the screen you will see the list of pages you can access. I have included screen prints of each of the pages you need to change. 

1 - General 
Just copy the settings you see 

2 - UI Settings 
Just copy the settings you see 

3 - Directories 
Decide where you want to store your downloads. You may want to make some new folders. Once you have done that just set those folders in the boxes you see. 

4 - Connection 
Just copy the settings you see 

5 - Bandwith 
Important - leave the upload rate in the top box, do not change it. This has been determined with the speed test. Leave the first box alone. You will see it says 300 Kb/s, that's my own settings set by my utorrent, yours will probably be different. 
The rest of the boxes you can change. You'll probably see I've set more connections than the speed test recommends, change it anyway, you can always change it back. More connections = more people to download from = faster downloads. 

6 - Bit Torrent 
Just copy the settings you see. The main one will be Protocol Encryption. Change this to 'Enabled'. 

7 - Queueing 
Just copy the settings you see. 

8 - ÂµTorrent Download Page 
As you can see, about half way down the page you will see some tabs. If you click on 'files' you can prioritise the files so they get downloaded in the order you want. If you select ""Do Not Download"" it won't download it at all. Handy if you want to start watching the tv shows whilst it downloads and if you don't want to download everything in the torrent. 


That should be everything but if you have any more questions click on this. http://www.utorrent.com/help 

Enjoy,

,memphist,2011-08-02T21:40Z,"Excellent guide and thank you - I tried these for a different reason....BUT I still have the issue!

I've moved away from uTorrent about 4 months ago as it stopped my web browers from working on my Apple Mac's and Win7 PCs.  

I now use Transmission on the Macs and TIXATI on the Win7s.  Both decent programs but I miss uTorrents features, but these clients let my web browers work.  I've tried a few other programs and they all let the web browers work.  Only uTorrent stops the browsers.  I've tested Opera, Chrome, ie, safari and Firefox.  They all stop when uTorrent startsup.  Rebuilt one Windows 7 PC and it worked for a very short while and then it started again.

Whenever uTorrent is started, my browsers will not find the web pages anymore and I get a time out or 404 error.  All other connection to the WWW worked just fine, like M$ update, VPN, email clients,etc... Just the browsers

I went to the uTorrent site and searched google only to find 1000's of other people having the same trouble.  But no answers to why this phenomena is happening.

I loved uTorrent but I can't use it since this happened, does anyone know what causes this error or know of a fix? "
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-08-03T01:20Z,"As I say, I'm no expert but I had a similar issue to that a while back. I had Peer Guardian and it was that that was causing me the problems. If it's not that it may be your IPconfig.

Under preferences you will see Advanced. Change the IPConfig one to 'false'. Try that, it worked for me. "
