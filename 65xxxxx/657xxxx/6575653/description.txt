This 2 cd limited (and numbered) edition of Kiss This is probably the best Sex Pistols product on the market. The first CD is a nearly complete chronicle of everything the Pistols recorded. It has every track that is on Never Mind the Bollocks as well as each of the four B-sides to their original singles (I Wanna Be Me, Did You No Wrong, No Fun, Satellite). Kiss This also contains several covers from their earliest days: Don't Give Me No Lip, Child and Stepping Stone. The final two songs are a great bonus: Sid Vicious' version of My Way, a brilliant/stupid, trashing/celebration of the Sinatra/Presley classic; and Silly Thing, sung by Steve Jones after Rotten had left the band. 
The second cd is Live in Trondheim, 21 July 1977, a pretty good recording of a decent performance with Sid on bass.
