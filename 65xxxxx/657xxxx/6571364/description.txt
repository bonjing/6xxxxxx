Few words..

..In the early '60s, an apprentice writer and outcast fringe poet decides to oppose everyone and everything: the Vatican, the Italian Communist Party and the cinematic status quo.Â Thus was born the first accursed hero of Italian cinema, with the abbreviated name Accatto.Â - Ie, "Accattone".Â And somehow, just like that, Pierre Paolo Pasolini bowed for the first time to the garbage bins of provincial Rome and hauled out the fever of one incorrigible little pimp.

While it may sound outrageous and unheard, the life path of Accato (Franco Citti) bears semblance to the myths of Christianity. However, you don't find kind-hearted angels living in the Slums. The world is made of two layers. In the center there are the lounges of Rome, in the margin there is hell with the little devils.Â He delves in hell then, in the style of his heroes;Â cheap, nasty, wrinkled, irregular, asymmetric, vulgar but above all else, completely true and hence sacred..
