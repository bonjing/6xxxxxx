Robot Soldiers
Do you think Iron Man is science fiction? And the ability to bound at great speeds, lift huge weights or leap tall fences are things you might read about in a superhero comic? Then prepare to be stunned in the UK premiere of Robot Solders as this programme reveals that with a little help from technology such superpowers are becoming more than just fantasy! Exoskeletons, which allow the wearer to take on the strength of a machine, have sprung from the world of science fiction and are increasingly used today. In a series of eye-popping demonstrations, this fascinating show introduces the machine that allows an average man to defeat a trained athlete in an endurance test, and the huge piloted robot used in Japan to rescue earthquake survivors. Plus, meet the exoskeleton 'hobbyist' who has been challenged to build a suit that will allow him to throw a car off a cliff, and the woman who is walking for the first time in 18 years thanks to her robotic leg supports. It's one giant leap for mankind - in some cases literally!
