Integrated Features

SlideIT successfully integrates multiple features such as sliding, tapping, predictive text, disambiguation, shortcuts and graffiti, offering the user a friendly layout and an intuitive user interface.

Keyboard skins and size

Dark? Light? Big? Small? SlideIT has many different skins with a polished, clear look at any keyboard size and resolution available for download. So everybody can choose a look and size to match their preference.
Predictive Sliding
SlideIT is the only available solution that supports predictive text suggestions while sliding. Other applications provide prediction only when tapping.

Accuracy

You donâ€™t have to be accurate â€“ Dasur's pattern recognition engine provides the precision. SlideIT has the unique ability to recognize a word even when the sliding path is highly distorted. In regular daily use, the SlideIT recognition rate remains very high, even when the user slides quickly and with low accuracy.

Fastest Learning Curve

Feedback indicates that it usually takes a few minutes to get used to the application, and within a few hours, users double and triple their writing speed.

Lightweight Application

SlideIT requires few resources on your touch screen device, using under 2 MB of memory per language (for the dictionary). Dasurâ€™s optimized engine uses minimal CPU and saves on battery power consumption.
