1. Tap the applications launcher
2. Scroll over and tap Settings
3. In the settings menu, scroll down and tap Language & keyboard
4. Tap on Input method
5. Find the name of the keyboard you want to activate, and tap on it (SlideIt)
Your new keyboard is now active! If you want to test it to make sure it is activated, just press the Search key, and your keyboard will pop up.
HOPE THAT HELPS!"

,gigabyteme,2011-08-09T05:28Z,"@Imaaqeex3 
You are supposed to install the .apk file using the application manager on the phone. copy the file into memory card where you will remember where the file is then use the application installer to search for it and install"
