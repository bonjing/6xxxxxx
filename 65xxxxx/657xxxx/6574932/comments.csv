It was okay. Nothing amazing, but if you have a spare 20 minutes there are worse things to do.

Getting it in HD is pretty much pointless though. Even though the station ident says ""G4HD"", it was either just upscaled from a standard def source during broadcast, or the video bit rate was set too low during encoding."
