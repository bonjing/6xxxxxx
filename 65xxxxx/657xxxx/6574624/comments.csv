sorry man, I've got no dvdrips you've requested, try to search them at rutracker, you'll find there all you want and even more ;)"
,nemosrings,2011-09-24T04:39Z,"Thanks danny_bull & subsequent seeders.

May I suggest in future you encode using X264. This is a much newer compressor & more efficient than XviD. XviD is 'old-hat' nowadays, excuse the pun. :D
Also, there's more up-to-date containers than AVI. AVI has not been updated in about 8 years & is no longer the best to use for the newer video formats (has some compatibility issues.) Newer container types give more options & are more compatible with today's players & formats."
