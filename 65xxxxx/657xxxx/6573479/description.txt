Although I\\\'m not the biggest Tea Party fan anymore, I thought I would share this concert DVD with everyone. I consider this to be the pinnacle era for The Tea Party (1997-2000). This rip is basically everything on the DVD in 5.1, plus an MP3 soundtrack transcoded from the stereo stream of the DVD.
