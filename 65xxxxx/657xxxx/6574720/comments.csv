,lavalamp,2011-07-31T20:21Z,Can you make a torrent for just the audio please? It's only about 120 MB so it wouldn't take anywhere near as long to download.
,jorrell0733,2011-07-31T21:08Z,"RE:lavalamp I discovred that there was a 2ms glitch in the encoded file which caused a sound drop out and the file slipped to almost 3 minutes in which is why thats where the audio fails. I would have just uploaded the sound file for the origianl torrent but when I merged this myself, it was completely out of sync. Rather than complicates things for many people who dont even know how to mux/demux video & audio I just correctly the file and have trimmed it so it now plays perfectly. This is why I hacent uploaded the file. Not to mention the demuxed file wud be Non Nero Compliant AAC Audio which wont be recognised with most software. You would need an encoded from AAC to AC3 to demux the audio first, the remux the AC3 & the H264 file. In other words, far too complicated for most people. SO ive taken the choice to upload a file that plays correctly upon download. Thanks theblacknight"
