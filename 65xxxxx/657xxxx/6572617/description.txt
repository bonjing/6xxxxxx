iGO My Way 8.4.2.139242 for Android with Israel map.

Notes:
- This version of iGO is installed and working on my Samsung Galaxy S and Samsung Galaxy SII
- The map file of israel says 2011 but i can't guarantee that.
- The cities and street names are in English.
- In my opinion it is not the best offline navigation out there but its the only one i found searching the net.
- If this version of iGO does not suit your mobile you can still use the Israel map file found in the zip file under /iGO/content/map with other versions of iGO.

Installation instruction:

- Copy the installation file iGOMyWay_8.4.2.139242.apk to you mobile and install it
- unzip the file iGO_SD_CARD.zip and copy the directory "iGO" in your mobile under /mnt/sdcard (so it will be like /mnt/sdcard/iGO)

run iGO on your mobile, after a short wizard setup it's ready to use.
    

Enjoy.
