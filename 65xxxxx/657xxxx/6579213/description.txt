               Image Line Deckadance Club Edition 1.93 + Patch (MPT)



Release date: August 02th, 2011


Deckadance is a DJ mixing application that works as a standalone program OR as a 
VSTi plugin in your favourite host. Control Deckadance using your mouse, keyboard, 
midi_controller, timecoded vinyl and or CD system. No other DJ software supports 
more control formats and is as committed to 3rd party controller support as 
Deckadance.
 
Image-Line, the company behind Deckadance, has more than 10 years experience 
developing and managing class-leading audio software such as FL Studio. During 
Deckadance's development, we didn't just bring in some  consulting DJs to tell 
our software engineers what they wanted. Deckadance was written by DJs for DJs,  
so we are confident that it will take your DJing to the next level with features 
that make total sense.  
             
Of course, if you suck as a DJ, you will still suck using Deckadance, but you 
will suck better, faster, harder and more creatively than ever before! 



Deckadance Featurelist:
----------------------- 
Mixing: 
Beat analysis, beat matching, time stretching, pitch shifting, bass x-fades, 
and user-assignable x-fade curves are all possible. Deckadance supports MP3, 
WAV and OGG formats.

MIDI control: 
Deckadance comes with pre-configured setups for working with the Vestax VCI-100, 
Behringer (BCD2000 & 3000), Allen & Heath Xone:3D, M-Audio XSession, Hercules DJ 
Console (MP3 & MK II), EKS XP10 , Kontrol-DJ. All other controllers will work in 
Generic mode or via custom links which can be made with the MIDI learn feature 
and saved for future recall.

Vinyl control: 
The following Time Code Vinyls and CDs have been certified to work with Deckadance:
Stanton FinalScratch, Serato Scratch Live, MixVibes, and msPinky. All other vinyls
and timecode CDs can be 'learnt' using the inbuilt Deckadance Time Code calibration
system.

Sampler: 
Eight integrated sampler banks can load or record 1, 2, 4 or 8 beat loops from
one of the decks (freely assignable). Samples can be triggered on-the-fly or
beat-synced with the associated deck.

ReLooping: 
The Deckadance Relooper features the ability to re-slice any beat-analyzed track
and re-arrange the beat. The Relooper includes a set of master effects for added
customization of the sound and can be used to create stutter effects, or to extend
infinite parts of a track to create unique breaks, intros or outros. The Relooper
also supports unique loop and leap features which allow the track to continue from
the point it would have reached if no loop had occurred.

VST host: 
Deckadance can host eight VST instruments or effects. These can be assigned to 
either deck, and are located in the signal path between the decks and the master
outputs. Instruments may be driven by MIDI sequences to create unique live 
sequenced tracks. Included with Deckadance are the Image-Line JuicePack effects 
including: Love Philter, Parametric EQ & EQ2, Wave Candy, Multiband Compressor, 
Delay, Delay Bank, WaveShaper, EQUO (graphic morphing EQ), Flangus, Vocoder, 
Spectroman and Stereo Enhancer plugins.

VSTi plugin: 
Deckadance can be loaded as a VST inside any VST-compliant host, such as FL Studio,
Ableton Live, Sonar or Cubase.

Playlist: 
Working with the integrated file browser, the Playlist allows sets to be arranged 
and tested before the gig, including cue points, loops and beat-markers. Complete 
with 'DJ-Style Automix' function (using Bass crossfades) even the laziest of DJs, 
or those who need to visit the bathroom, are catered for.

DMX: 
Digital Multiplex lighting control standard is a communications protocol,
similar to MIDI. However, DMX may be used to control lighting, dimmers and 
other DMX-enabled equipment such as fog-machines. The Deckadance DMX Sequencer 
is an optional module to be released soon.

Skins: 
Deckadance ships with a Dark and Light skin. The skin bitmaps are freely editable 
so users can create or customize their own. New skins will also be downloadable 
from the Deckadance website shortly.

Key DSP and Technical: 
ASIO-compliant, 64-bit DSP, pristine quality processing. Two decks loading MP3, 
WAV and OGG, aufTAKT Tempo analysis. Deckadance supports 12 freely assignable

*** When using TPB please read these important notes: 
-----------------------------------------------------

01. AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02. To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03. If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantine then look at History or something similar).

04. To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6091044/

05. Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06. Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07. Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08. Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09. Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10. Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11. In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12. In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13. Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

14. Comments are welcome, unlike ranting, trolling, whining, etc.

15. No Promises ... No Debts!

This torrent is scanned with:
1. Norton Internet Security 
2. Avira AntiVir Premium 
3. avast! Pro Antivirus
4. Kaspersky Antivirus

Also scanned with some well known antispyware, and tested in Sandboxie.
Malware detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally 
posting fake comments & files. Their meaning is just trying to spread 
confusion and to frustrate TPB and it's users. 
Less downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
