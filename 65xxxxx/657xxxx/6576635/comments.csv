,JSimani,2011-08-02T20:52Z,where do you get these applications to upload them?
,J.Money97,2011-08-02T20:57Z,where do you get these applications? I couldn't find any sort of website or anything. 
,rjc1138,2011-08-03T05:27Z,Just about every application has the Macupdate address as well as various developer sites. Some even have a direct link to the application itself for download. Just highlight an app in the list to the left and various info. pops up in the main area (to the right). There's atab for serials and a tab for product info. I can only use  Serial Seeker now (for some reason) so I've forgotten how the reader is set up exactly but if you poke around enough you'll figure it out.
,nemosrings,2011-09-30T17:48Z,"rjc1138 some of these apps, can't remember which, iserial reader or serial seeker have a time limit of use, after that you need to download a fresh updated version. It might be 12 months use-ability not sure."
,nemosrings,2011-09-30T18:00Z,"Seems the later the Serial Box version, the later the reader version it requires. This applies to both readers I think.

But, iSerial Reader does use certificates. After I installed this version, said I had 198 days of use left."
