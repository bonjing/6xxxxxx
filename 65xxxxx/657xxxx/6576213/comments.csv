,jj68,2011-08-01T17:50Z,CONNOR66 - I'd recommend you spend those hard earned money on a new keyboard instead. One with a working caps lock perhaps?

,ramikaz,2011-08-02T14:20Z,Steve Austin makes me wish for another Seagal or Van Damm movie.
,MoleUK,2011-08-03T15:35Z,"Terribly terribly bad.

Though it might win an award for the over-usage of the word fuck."
,SuperWurm,2011-08-03T19:45Z,"Nothing wrong with the quality. All looks and sounds good overhere.
And if you like a movie with big musceled men shooting at and/or shot by gangsters in nice clothes and a nice babe on both sides, and everything ends with big musceled angry men beating the hell out of eachother, than this is your movie.

But that thing where we have to geuss what's in the suitcase is not original.
And the second bad thing bout the movie is that the guy at the end of the movie, you know who's brain wasn't blown out and telling the swat team a story bout an undercover operation. That scene  wasn't neceserily. They've could also leave it out of the movie. Then the story would have been better without it. 
Anyway. For the action it's a good movie. And except for the end the story is nice for an action movie. You know, some policemen trying to get out of impossible situations."
