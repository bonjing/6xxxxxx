Great quality.

I was really back and forth about this album but it turned out to be a kick ass album. Personally, I still prefer Shogun as it gave me chills the first time I heard it and continues to do so today. However, this album was great minus a few songs.
""Forsake Not The Dream"" reminded me the most of pre-Shogun Trivium and I think that's the direction they wanted to go for this album.
Thanks for the upload! :)"
,evanm45,2011-08-03T07:46Z,This is fuckin incredible. I never thought i'd see the special edition of this album a week before the release date. Great quality. A very legit torrent. DOWNLOAD. Trivium is easily one ofthe greatest metal bands I've heard/seen in my life. Thanks a ton jimmy!

,hamlund87,2011-08-03T15:18Z,"Man, I waited on this album the whole year. 
Big thumbs up for the upload.

Audio quality is perfect, and the songs are amazing so far. I like that they implemented more clean vocals on this album, although Shogun is much better :p "
