This version does not include remote installation as stated in your description. Do you happen to have the version that includes it?

Thanks for all you do."

Yes, it's PreCracked, but to activate it you have to register it by using Name & Serial that is written in ""Instructions.txt"" notepad."

I then also realized my documents folder was gone, and I cannot locate it. I removed, as far as I can tell, the keylogger from my computer by reactivating my antivirus software, but I'm still having issues finding my Documents. Any suggestions? "
[T],CheckOutEr,2011-10-10T16:58Z,"Hi, someguy15867

I'm pretty sure that the reason why it happened is just because your Anti-Virus wasn't Disabled correctly. Just disabling Anti-Virus in it's Settings menu isn't enough. To Disable it correctly you have to follow this instructions: 1) Click ""Start"". 2) Click ""Run"". 3) Type ""msconfig"". 4) Click on ""Startup"" tab & Uncheck everything that is connected with your Anti-Virus (it disables the executable files that are turning on your Anti- Virus during Startup/Booting process). 5) Click on ""Services"" tab & do exactly the same things. 6) ReStart your PC to take Effect.  So, now the only thing I can suggest you is to let your Ant-Virus to finish all kind of Scanning & Disinfecting processes. When your Anti-Virus's Status will be ""Protected"" then it'll be possible to acess & see ""My Documents"" folder & it's contents. I hope it helps!

Best regards, CheckOutEr"

,flybers,2012-03-13T10:10Z,"This is the stupidest software I have ever seen. On installation you are asked for a password/activation word. Once installed you can press a combination of keys to activate the program whereupon you have to enter your password. Seems all well & good. Then the programs icon magically appears on the taskbar... Still good... But what really messes with my head is the fact that on installation following entering your password, a folder called named bpk is inserted in ProgramData in the root of the C: drive. By default it's hidden, but any fool who has ever heard of folder options will soon be able to see it. But here's the kicker, the real mindbender. They use the password you have entered to NAME the program files. So, not only can anyone see the installation folder, they can clearly see the so called secret password!!! No ticking of 'hide' options with the program will change this... Doh!"
