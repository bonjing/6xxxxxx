,wetmouse,2011-08-01T04:52Z,"Req: Never post ANYTHING that is requested in the comments, but especially when they just request without so much as a thanks. God I hate these people! Don't you know these people post whatever they can get their hands on and your requests are pointless and annoying?"
,wetmouse,2011-08-01T04:53Z,By the way: Thanks! It's great to have AES airport from the former Soviet Union!
,Julagis,2011-08-01T10:49Z,Seed please.
,mickyfinny,2011-08-01T14:17Z,"Cmon people,dont just hit and run.At least seed 1-1,my broadband has a limit as to how much i can seed.So if you can,try and keep this exellent  torrent alive please cos i need to move on to the next surprise:+)"
,Julagis,2011-08-01T14:46Z,Error. Could not create uninstall.
,saintamadas,2011-08-01T15:58Z,"@wetmouse i totally agreed with you. I detest people that are Oliver Twist never satisfied. Even if Mickyfinny eventually provides the request it will definitely keep coming. On the other hand, they maybe on the right track... The bottom-line is that i ll advise he should go out of his way as no man can please the world. Thanks Micky as always your efforts are highly appreciated."
,fly83,2011-08-01T18:21Z,REQ: FS2004-Aerosoft Keflavik X 
,vittupaa1980,2011-08-01T22:10Z,Y25 yeah i had it ...running fsx and Win 7...I dont know how to fix it thou. I just uninstalled this scenery. but thanx to mickyfinny for uploads anyways. 
,Romgun,2011-08-02T07:23Z,"The description says that this version for FS2004. So the trees do not display correctly and any errors are possible.  We need another version for FSX,, but it does require activation."
,vittupaa1980,2011-08-02T09:38Z,ROMGUN.... Well maybe the title should be then FSX-AES-VILNIUS INTERNATIONAL for FS2004 only. And features section also indicates that this is compatible whit fsx. 
,Jimstalk,2011-08-03T15:12Z,"thx mickyfinny

please upload FlyAthens (flytampa)"
,boeffer,2011-08-03T23:53Z,"REQ : Serial Instant Scenery 2 for FSX 

urgent please

I lost my serial

Thx zzip"
,NanainiS,2011-08-04T11:17Z,"error: could not create uninstall shortcut.
I'm using windows 7 and FSX, ho to fix that error?"
,Jimstalk,2011-08-04T15:32Z,run the prog as administrator or right click to Main FSX folder & change the security settings
,NanainiS,2011-08-04T16:30Z,"I'm getting that error when i'm installing the scenery, not when launching fsx. Full error message: Could not create uninstall shortcut: C\Users\MyName\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\The SW / Vilnius International\Uninstall The SW/Vilnius International.lnk"
,SniperBliss,2011-08-04T20:37Z,"Micky, can you get the NGX when it releases?"
,Jimstalk,2011-08-04T21:06Z,"yeah thats what i mean.Firstly try to run the executable as administrator (right click on .exe & select run as administrator).This method solves approx 60% of issues like yours.If the error occurs even after this simple fix try to change the security of your main FSX folder (right click on folder>properties>security>change and then change the rights for all users).Also try to disable your antivirus  until installation finishes bacause it may conflict with some dll's and exe's 
(i had the same problem with you some time ago and i just ran the installer as administrator amd everything worked perfect)"
,jolopy,2011-08-05T06:37Z,request pmdg 737ngx :D
,Jimstalk,2011-08-05T12:08Z,737 ngx is finally out!!Check their website
,miksz,2011-08-05T17:04Z,I have trees problem too. the easiest way is to remove vil_veg or vil_veg_lib from scenery folder. all that trees will be gone. but that's not a solution
,F.B.I,2011-08-05T20:05Z,NGX will be up tomoz!!!
,SniperBliss,2011-08-06T01:00Z,"THANK YOU SO MUCH FBI!

,F.B.I,2011-08-06T12:16Z,"Guys im having trouble cracking the activation on this one, seems pmdg has gone all out, im trying use some of the cracking tools used by previous crackers, so if anyone has any info please post, btw theres realy no point me uploading a extracted version of the .exe, as you realy need this plane to work properly. Ill keep you updated threwout the day, unless someone beats me to it"

,Jimstalk,2011-08-06T17:38Z,"@nittert

what makes you think that cracking the most anticipated and long-waited FSX projekt will be so easy and quick?"
,SniperBliss,2011-08-06T17:47Z,"Jimstalk can you do it? :(
You've uploaded some nice torrents in the past :("
,F.B.I,2011-08-06T18:26Z,"@ nittert have you got msn, could you send me the .exe so i could run both threw a hex editor please, i just need to check on a few line in the hex (cnt explain y) i dont want your passwords, you could either put the .exe up on here or send it me on my msn account."
,clintferns,2011-08-06T18:26Z,please crack it...plzzz... :D
,F.B.I,2011-08-06T18:28Z,"@Jim hey jim you are right this is very hard to crack, but nittert can help me so i can compare two .exes to see if they are different in anyway, if that is a no they are the same well i could have it up as soon as 11pm. :-)"
,F.B.I,2011-08-06T18:34Z,"I am trying, but i need another .exe so i can compare the files once they are in there RAW form!"
,F.B.I,2011-08-06T18:35Z,"@everyone, i already have one actiavted, but i have a second machine and need someone to upload just the 737ngx.exe so i can run the crack on the second machine!!"
,nittert,2011-08-06T19:06Z,"Hi F.B.I, sorry for my late response ;-) what is your msn? mail it to: gerbeny@live.com (just make that one account ;-) and i will send the exe to you :-)
Greetings Nittert"
