A lot of time and hard work went into making these DVD's. And its not nice to see them being pirated after all of what we put into making these for people. www.3runshop.com is where they are legitimately available.
Thankyou.

You can't stop people from sharing what they like, these videos are all over the web, just like everything else. You are not exclusively privileged in that sense, no one is.

Truth is, you can find most of what's in there on video streaming sites for free anyway.

If you wanted more purchases, you shouldn't charge so damn much for your DVDs. People don't have a lot of money these days, and it's not looking to get better anytime soon.

Furthermore, freerunning is an inherent, instinctive form of movement for all apes on the planet. Trying to make money from that is kind of like charging for breathing. Just plain stupid."

,misfisk,2011-11-26T11:52Z,"Actually, that's a little harsh, I apologise. Buying DVDs without knowing the content is just a thing of the past. Nowadays, you check it out first, and then, if you have the money and think it's worth it, you pay for it.

No one is trying to ruin you, but as long as there will be internet, this choice is always going to be there. Removing this particular torrent won't change anything.

Again, sorry for the rant above, I don't know why I turned into a teenager just there :P"
