Why Planes Crash: Brace for Impact
It's perhaps not the most comforting of thoughts, but flying isn't always the safest way to travel. Aircraft tumble from the skies for many reasons: extreme weather conditions, engine failure, lack of fuel, terrorist attack... And that's before we even get to structural failures, fire or human error. This series uses first-hand pilot testimony and computer-generated animations in order to examine some of the world's more dramatic aeroplane incidents, reliving the crucial moments when pilots lost control. Passengers recall life-or-death situations, while the animation aims to recreate an accurate picture of stricken planes' final moments before crashing or destruction.


Brace for Impact, investigates the moments at which some pilots must decide to put their planes down on water. There's a recreation of a routine flight from New York that had to land in the Hudson River, and actual footage of a hijacked Boeing 767 being forced into the ocean. Plus, the pilot from an incident in the Caribbean Sea in 1970 recalls how a torrential downpour forced him to divert from his destination, but then a lack of fuel meant he had to land his plane on top of 10-15ft waves (landing in the waves themselves would have caused the aircraft to break apart).
