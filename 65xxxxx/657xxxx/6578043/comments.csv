[V],nikita200,2011-08-02T14:37Z,"AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware."
,RiPPER-D,2011-08-03T19:37Z,"why do people who use crappy anti virus like AVG and AVAST always moan about viruses!

if you bothered to take the time you complain with into finding a proper anti virus you might realise its not a virus! 

of course it will say its a virus microshit pays the companys to detect it as a virus to stop piracy!

if your that bothered about downloading this version google it and download from official site and then let your crappy anti virus tell you its still a virus!

for the record i just downloaded this version and scanned it... also checked it with 7zip and its fine

scanned with ESET SMART SECURITY"
