Lots of requests for this one. The full unabbridged version of Whitley Strieber & James Kunetka\\\'s classic WWIII novel based on nuclear war with the former Soviet Union. Reads like a combination novel and historical textbook. It scared the living crap out of me when I read it back in the 80\\\'s. It remains one of my top three post-appocalyptic works of fiction (Lucifer\\\'s Hammer and Allas Babylon are the other two). 

Now for the technical stuff. This copy is from tapes that are almost 30 years old. The sound is good, unless you are used to the high quality stuff Audible puts out. Hey, its the best I could do with what I had to work with. Enjoy!
