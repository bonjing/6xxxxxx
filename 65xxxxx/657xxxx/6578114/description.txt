Documentary profile of singer Jim Morrison, who with his band the Doors made a great impression on the rock music scene of the late 1960s. With comments from other members of the group and footage of film and TV appearances.

It's a very well done and informative documentary. If you're a Doors fan, don't miss it. 

Enjoy. :>
