Portable.-A portable application (portable app), sometimes also called standalone, is a computer software program designed to run independently from an operating system. This type of application is stored on a removable storage device such as a CD, USB flash drive, flash card, or floppy disk â€“ storing its program files, configuration information and data on the storage medium alone.
Portable Windows applications

A portable application does not leave its files or settings on the host computer. Typically the application does not write to the Windows registry or store its configuration files (such as an INI file) in the user's profile; instead, it stores its configuration files in the program's directory.
Portable applications can be run on any computer system with which they are compatible but typically require a specific operating system (such as Microsoft Windows XP or above, certain version of a Linux distro, etc.)"
