[V],Horrorspoke,2011-08-01T16:06Z,"extremezone uploads scene releases guys, when they are released by the scene, he will upload them. You can get relatively accurate info on any R5 releases by searching 'Sam's Blog' on google.

^^Hangover 2 isn't due till December...... yawn"
,markdbsilva,2011-08-01T18:07Z,Post real and working. nice quality. tnx :)
,jvezirian,2011-08-01T23:16Z,"Extremezone,

You are doing a fantastic job, keep up the good, hell fantastic work. And for all the other impatient folks, if you cannot wait for a good release, why not learn to do it yourselves, instead of nagging and whining about when this release and or that release will come out."
,scottsasse,2011-08-02T03:06Z,"On a sort of unrelated subject, I wish people would STOP TROLLING and asking for crap movies like Fast Five!! When a DVD-Screener, PPV-Rip or retail is available trust me it will be immediately posted by numerous trusted up-loaders!!************************************************************************** That being said, PLEASE people comment on the movie on this page itself. Like say why it's good or sucks and is it strictly a childrens movie or will adults enjoy it as well?? Lotta Love, DrScott"
,Redt0rrent,2011-08-02T12:06Z,"I was about to upload this, haha. Nice on exremezone."

,hilbilby,2011-08-06T03:19Z,"Thanks to a few for at least commenting on the movie in question. 

Thanks also to up-loader for patience with unrelated Q's. 

From what i can gather there are a couple of versions with slight sync issues currently available. Anyone know what's the best?"

,TheRacer2000,2012-01-02T20:27Z,"Good Job Great Movie Qualities 'r uploading!!
A/V-10"
,BLOxMayheM,2012-02-09T23:05Z,"On PC itself with VLC: Works perfect.
NO SOUND when streamed to TV through DLNA though, bad luck. This barely ever happens, so it's the encoding/this torrent.

Reading the other comments I'd recommend downloading another torrent, though extremezone is and will remain an A+ uploader. Thanks mate"
