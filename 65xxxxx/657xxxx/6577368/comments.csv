,reddfraser,2011-08-07T04:51Z,"To Lowlander,
         AAAHHHH.....THE WIRE....A++, would watch it for years. Have you seen Deadwood? another A++  based on real life...the gold rush town where Wild Bill Hicocks was shot in the back. Also just devoured Justified, the new Elmore Lenard film noir series....A short spoken sheriff sent back to his Kentucy coal-mining roots.
To VTV Folks,
Is this where a poor, pitiful newbie---now with not a single real TV channel, let alone MSNBC,
Begs you to add Rachel Maddow to your library?
Been to several sites, but no luck.

Thanks again for all the great shows,
Redd of Phoenix"
