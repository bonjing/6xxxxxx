,the_media_tardis,2011-08-02T05:57Z,"eztv has changed my life man!!!....thanx guys!! U R THE BEST !!...I own all three series of BB on DVD (to support the producers) - but I always watch a show from eztv first!! 
 the problem of seeding that Bokey_Boy mentioned  is that even though there is 11000 seeders, most end up ""queued seeding"" through no real fault of their own..as they are most likely ""doing the right thing"" seeding many many shows..."
,the_media_tardis,2011-08-02T05:59Z,currently got 700kbs - v good  :)  55 - active seeds...will do the same myself for a week...
,kbowk2,2011-08-02T13:34Z,"saielkhan I used to have that issues for a while and I've known other as well and only with eztv.  No idea how or why it happens but it somehowgot working again.  

I would try updating and/or reinstalling utorrent (or whatever you using).  I think when it updated was when eztv started working again for me.

Cheers for the torrent.  I'm not going to seed cause I suck ahahahahaha.  and Australians still have stupid cap limits on data.  "
,Catastrophic_Failure,2011-08-03T02:11Z,"Thanks for another great upload. I can't stand commercials one bit, they drive me absolutely crazy so thank you eeztv, you've saved me from suicide."
