It is narrated from the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.) that a person who recites this surah will never face bad times. The person who recites it in the Isha or Tahajjud prayers always remains pure of heart and even dies while he is in a pure state.
Imam Jaâ€™far as-Sadiq (a.s.) said that a person who recites this surah properly will get a chance to meet the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.) and if he prays for something from Allah (s.w.t.) he will get it. Reciting surah al-Muzammil a hundred times on Thursday night leads to the forgiving of a hundred major sins and procures a hundred rewards. Recitation of this surah protects one from insanity and from being a slave to people.
