also, forgot to say this but I will take any game request you have. Can't say if I will upload them or not but it does give me an idea on what is needed!"
,bry68,2011-08-03T00:25Z,your pics are blocked!
,TyMod,2011-08-03T02:07Z,You have to copy and paste the pics in a new tab or window.
,SrDude,2011-08-06T16:12Z,Anybody has IS2011? Thx.
,TyMod,2011-08-07T05:03Z,"No, I looked evyerwhere and this is all I could find that had a patch or crack.  Sorry.  Maybe next year. lol"
,SrDude,2011-08-08T00:17Z,"Thx for looking, appreciated."
,TyMod,2011-08-08T01:47Z,"Your welcome man.  I think the thing is, as you can see from this torrent, almost no on uses this for some reason.  I mean hardly anyone has downloaded it.  So no one bothers to properly crack it every year."
,SrDude,2011-08-29T14:22Z,"Well, IS is a pretty got damn buggy tool and isn't very intuitive, but a it has a lot of features though. Advanced Installer is my favorite."
,TyMod,2011-08-29T22:49Z,"Yeah,  I like Clickteam Install Creator or, the best one in my opinion and fastest is Smart Install Maker.  I personally don't like InstallShield Premier.  After using it I realized it sucks balls!!! Plus, like you said its' buggy and can be confusing.  But whatever. Atleast its on here and if people want it they can get it. :)"
,Xathian,2011-11-04T06:34Z,"""After using it I realized it sucks balls""

I'd suggest learning to actually use it then, this software is the most widely used installer software in the software and games industry. I'd say it works just fine for people who can actually use it, rather than playing with the drag and drop features expecting good results."
,TyMod,2011-11-05T17:11Z,"Yeah but it sucks balls.  I code programs in Visual Studio but when I finish the program I really don't feel like having to code a installer when I could use software that makes it much easier and takes alot less time.

BTW glad it worked for you.  :)  Maybe one day people will just appreciate stuff."
,winterbone,2011-11-07T20:53Z,"I just tried silent install but only a evaluation version, hope this works just as good or better :P
Cheers to TyMod"
,winterbone,2011-11-07T21:09Z,"Worked really good, now time to learn this... Im kinda weak with learning XD"
,TyMod,2011-11-08T00:33Z,lol It's alright man.  Just look up YouTube vids and stuff.  They will tell you all you need to do.
