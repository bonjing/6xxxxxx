,bhutan_6,2011-08-02T15:20Z,Great torrents. Thanks. I have a request to everyone. Can you upload 2 rare Gamecube games (NTSC-U) Star wars rouge squadron 2: rouge leader and Prince of persia: sands of time in Piratebay. Thx in advance. Both of the games are in IGN's all time 25 best GC games list. 
,ramboryan,2011-08-02T19:41Z,"I've downloaded star wars and can upload it later but it would take you less time to get your gamecube games from. if you still want them both on here then give us a shout.

I am not uploading Gamecube ISOs at this time. There are many places on the web you can find the games you mentioned (I located them easily).

@jabwoy

Wii Game Manager or Wii Backup Manager will add the WBFS files straight to a WBFS partition, without the need to convert them back to ISO. The extension stands for Wii Backup File System, after all."
