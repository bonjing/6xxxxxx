Ever since the sexual revolution, the Danish culture has been one of the most liberal in the world, and the guys behind Klovn: The Movie, Frank Hvam and Casper Christensen, certainly demonstrate their lack of inhibition. Klovn is like Curb Your Enthusiasm plus various intoxicants, and the result is just as funny and entertaining as it is irrelevant and morally dubious. However, the latter quality is one of the great privileges and obligations of comedy, and while Christensen/Hvam may not have any agenda as such, Klovn certainly will stir up some opinions and free the viewer from the hollywoodized comedy prison of recent years. And if you're not easily exhausted by embarrassments and complications, you'll have plenty of fun all the way through.
