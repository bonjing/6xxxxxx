From writer Brian K. Vaughan (Y: THE LAST MAN, EX MACHINA, PRIDE OF BAGHDAD) comes 

this set of super-hero tales collected for the first time. Batman faces the 

ventriloquist's dummy-come-to-life known as Scarface in this exciting graphic novel. 

Things get a little strange along the way as Batman also fights the hoodlum known as 

Matches Malone -- who was seen previously as one of Batman's own aliases. Another of 

Gotham's villains, Clayface, battles Wonder Woman in a related story that features 

appearances by Batman foes Man-Bat and the Mad Hatter, with the help of the Teen 

Titans' own Donna Troy.
