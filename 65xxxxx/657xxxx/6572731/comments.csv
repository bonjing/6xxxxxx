,1seekr,2011-07-31T02:01Z,"You don't get it, ramikaz.  There is much to be admired in the natural beauty of a woman who doesn't feel the need to ""gild the lilly,"" as the saying goes, by colouring or removing hair, and sticking bits of jewelry through various parts of her body, or adorning it with tattoos, etc.

And the natural-looking smile of Katie makes her especially beautiful.  I haven't yet seen anything beyond the sample shot, but what I see in it, which our friendly greenfrog has kindly embedded into this description, makes me feel that Katie is an especially fine girl, who one would like to have as a friend.  I look forward to seeing more of her."
,1seekr,2011-07-31T02:17Z,"Now that I've seen a bit more of Katie, I feel I have to say that I don't care for the navel ornament or the makeup and eyebrow shaving.  And the flower on her backside seems unnecessary - but it's her choice, of course.

Still, I like Katie's smile.  I'd be curious to see how she develops as she gets older - maybe in another 10-15 years.  I hope that life is kind to her."
