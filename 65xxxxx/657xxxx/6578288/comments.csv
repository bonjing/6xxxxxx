,viedma,2011-08-02T17:53Z,"HOW VERY STUPID.... How about if tea cures ""some types"" of cancer? Or coffee? C´mon, smoking pot most likely CAUSES cancer. So much for the crazy ideas of deranged junkies... What a world we currently live in. Before movies like Captain America or Cowboys vs. Aliens would be strictly for children, now they are for adults as well. I wonder, have the powers that be finally succeeded in turning most people into children who are prone to believe almost anything they are told? Frightening prospect..."
,rolosdad,2011-08-02T18:32Z,"VIEDMA!! you wouldnt smoke it , you would eat it. Doubt very much if that would cause cancer. You seem to have a very negative outlook on cannabis, Guess your another fool swayed by the american propaganda machine."
,vlee1,2011-08-02T18:35Z,"So, I recommend you to watch the documentary first. I think you don't know much more then some PhD pneumologyst who had studying effects of hemp in lungs for the last 30 years.

Besides, it's not about smoking pot, but using its coupounds (notably THC and CBD1) to heal human body.

Funny that ignorancy is almost the same all over the world. Biased thoughts leaves you to nowhere."
,viedma,2011-08-02T21:09Z,"Within the realm of reality, I do eat often some raw garlic  (it has to be raw) to help prevent some cancers, like I eat plenty of fruit (fiber) to avoid trouble shitting and colon cancer, at least there seems to be some evidence for that. Otherwise next the cartels are gonna start promoting crack or heroin as cancer preventing drugs (of course, you don´t live long enough to catch it... :-)"
,vlee1,2011-08-02T21:42Z,"Okay. So continue doing that.. If it's good for you. Don't even watch the documentary. These researchers around the world may all be part of some world drug cartel, to make you smoke pot.

There are lots of scientific evidence there, that can lead you to further investigation.. But, that would require too much of you..

When you get sick, go and buy some toxin in a pharmacy next to you. Good luck."

Viedma - grow a brain."
,viedma,2011-08-02T22:48Z,Grow a what? Are you nuts... It gives you (fear of) cancer... :-)
,saintwarrior,2011-08-03T06:45Z,"with philip morris, and drug cartels around Prop 19 will never be passed... both factions would lose the business. Canada BC does about 20 Billion USD of business across the border.... imagine how much tax US could make from that. but then again we have people like veidma who have a closed mind. next he will say.. stop giving marinol to cancer patients. although i doubt he knows what marinol is. ... google is your best friend."
,vlee1,2011-08-03T18:40Z,"As I said.. Watch it, then come back and post some valid argument."
