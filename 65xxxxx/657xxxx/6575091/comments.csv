,User897,2011-08-01T02:10Z,"This is by scenebalance, so don't waste your effort.  They post torrents, then abandon them before anyone has a chance to finish downloading them."
,LukeScooto,2011-08-01T02:40Z,"Well your right about that, as i just found out. Didnt know they were famous for pulling that stunt. Not sure why they're even here then. Just to waste peoples time like they just did to me? Do you know anyone posting a decent verison of this, thats REAL?"
