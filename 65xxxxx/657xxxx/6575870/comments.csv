,bhutan_6,2011-08-02T15:18Z,Great torrents. Thanks. I have a request to everyone. Can you upload 2 rare Gamecube games (NTSC-U) Star wars rouge squadron 2: rouge leader and Prince of persia: sands of time in Piratebay. Thx in advance. Both of the games are in IGN's all time 25 best GC games list.

,notxalesoh,2011-08-22T14:01Z,hi. I am a new comer at downloading wii games and I was wondering would this game still work on my NTSC wii despite it saying PAL?

,Hansei,2011-10-27T12:48Z,I tried 248 but it never loaded for me. Maybe I need  to update my system.
