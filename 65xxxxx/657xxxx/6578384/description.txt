Here we are
this is the first build of the next version of vlc 1.1.12 from today : august 2
this kind of version is not official yet and is delivered for internal testing purpose only !
however it is not a fake as it truly comes from developer branch from videolan.org
this is the latest stable beta build from today.
Unfortunately i don't have found yet any changelog or what's new about this
new version.
As it is a beta build it can be a little bit buggy in certain cases.
May crash as well and therefore see for yourself so !
feel free to post any feedback but be constructive and not negative,please !
100 % untouched and delivered such as.Clean,serious,real,reliable and trustworthy so.
reset all cache during uninstall previous version to avoid certain problems.
Enjoy
