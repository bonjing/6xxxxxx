Lau, Bellowhead, Spiers & Boden, Angel Brothers â€“ besides being folk bands, what these rogueâ€™s gallery has in common is that theyâ€™re all signed to Derby-based folk label Navigator Records. What Navigator are into is proper, serious folk, which always runs a certain risk of coming across as excessively studious or stale. More than many of the labelâ€™s denizens, Angel Brothers explore on their self-titled album more of a world music feel, taking in some African influences as well as owing some debt to Ennio Morriconeâ€™s work in parts, as on â€œDjangoâ€™s Caravanâ€, presumably named after Corbucciâ€™s 1966 cult spaghetti western.

What makes Angel Brothers a little difficult to get into is the fact that it opens with two folk behemoths â€“ â€œTongues of Fireâ€ and â€œGhostsâ€ are well over seven and eight minutes long respectively, and their slowly unraveling appeals will frustrate and bore some listeners, but probably not the kind of listeners who have already found an appreciation for this kind of restrained, sober folk. Angel Brothers arenâ€™t flashy or absorbed by spectacle. Like Bellowhead they are content to allow songs to be dominated by delicate acoustic guitar and lengthy English fiddle passages, which on tracks like â€œEmpty Chairâ€ can lend the sound a laid-back, gentle and pastoral feel. Thereâ€™s the expected earthy sound here too â€“ indeed, testament to the recordâ€™s slightly unpolished and natural feel, the final track ends with some modest overheard dialogue â€“ â€œyeah, that was a good oneâ€.

Whilst Angel Brothers do a good job of making sure that the disparate types of roots music approached gel together into a fairly cohesive whole, itâ€™s those two longer tracks which feel like the core of the album, especially opener â€œTongues of Fireâ€. Its gradual build is admirable, creating a tense atmosphere which somehow conjures for me at least the mystique and vastness of the desert, aided by some ominous, exotic-sounding strings. Angel Brothers are a bit studious, and this does feel like a serious, considered folk record. But thatâ€™s not to say that only folk purists will enjoy it â€“ it is certainly, for example, more inviting than Jon Bodenâ€™s recent solo album, despite its instrumental nature.
