,DaemonicUV,2011-08-06T15:11Z,It's legit and definitely an awesome show! Looking forward to the next episode. :)
,Berdofblue,2011-08-06T21:42Z,"Well, I just looked at it, and I only want to know why you did multiple rar files? I'm having a bit of trouble trusting this right now, I'll comment again to say if it's legit or not."
,Berdofblue,2011-08-06T21:58Z,"Yup, it's good. I even scanned the file I got with Malware Bytes Pro (although I'm not sure how reliable it is). It was just a bit of an extra step unrarring it.

Anyway, about the show. It's gets pretty silly towards the end. Everybody seemed to forget that they weren't in any REAL danger, and they didn't really HAVE to tell the truth. It was almost as if they got some really bad actors from off the street and told them to be in this show. "
