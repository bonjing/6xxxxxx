Thank you to all the teams, scenes and other uploaders that have brought so much delightful fun into my life.
 
Please help seed when done.

As always, please be patient for the first 3-4 days after I initially upload the torrent. Thank you to all those that have helped seed my other torrents, which allows me to continue uploading new stuff. 

Mad Men Season 2:

If anyone has any requests, post below.

For more of my PS3 compatible torrents, click above, DarthPS3.

I will be uploading more 1080p PS3 and fat32 compatible movies as soon as I am finished with my Mad Men series uploads, films such as Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Kingdom of Heaven and more.		

I am trying to be more careful about checking all the files to make sure they are all there and work properly so I can eliminate the need for FIX file. Thank you for bearing with me as I learn the ropes out here. 

 
- These are all my personal files, films and television shows that I could not find (most often in high resolution) in a format that would allow me to simply pop on a external hard drive. I converted all these files, and since they are sitting there decided to share them.
 Though my torrents take a few days to download, most of the original sources that I myself downloaded took a few days.
 So, if you want to go find and download those original sources and then convert them to work on your PS3 yourself, awesome, but if you were as frustrated as I was and either don't want to convert them or don't know how, here you go.- 


Thank you's are welcome.
