I have a WD brand and it works great, just plug in any external USB drive, including thumb drives and watch!! No need to convert, but some of the MKV files done with the newer versions (After 4.0) of (MKV Merge) will have to be reloaded and re-muxed (Simply drag and drop and hit remux) to play on some Blu-Ray players and on some digital media players."

I also enjoy owning it ready to watch, especially without streaming anything. "
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-08-06T03:11Z,"If you are referring to my comment, I stream nothing. I watch directly from the USB hard drive plugged into either my B-R player or the WD Media player, or I burn as data and watch on my B-R player."
