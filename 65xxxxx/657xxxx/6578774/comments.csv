,shane_orija,2011-08-03T03:28Z,"Could anyone confirm whether this is legit? Fousseni, I tend to distrust the fearmongers who use caps."
,Fousseni,2011-08-03T04:49Z,trust me i downloaded it today Once i download and installed the game my internet connection does not worked anymore
,Urthurian,2011-08-03T06:08Z,"yet you are still online posting ""OMG dis iz virus do not download"" in all CAPS."
,outoffeelinsobad,2011-08-03T06:16Z,"Works! This game is f$*&king CRAZY! Thanks, uploader!"
,Digimaul,2011-08-03T15:47Z,"Working just fine, scanned clean AvG.  Win7 x64.

Still trying to decide if I like the game or not... "
,riplikethat,2011-08-03T15:55Z,"Game works fine. Downloaded and installed easily and there are no viruses.

Fousseni is a fucking moron whose mom was raped by Radiance members."
,shane_orija,2011-08-03T16:11Z,"Thanks, outoffeelinsobad and digimaul, for confirming its legit."
,Kjbaran,2011-08-03T16:23Z,Works for me. Win 7 x64. Avast antivirus. It comes with a crap load of .iso all the same size. I just picked one at random and mounted it like Fousseni's mom.
,Kjbaran,2011-08-03T16:32Z,Does anyone know why it comes with so many .ISO files?
,shane_orija,2011-08-03T16:52Z,"Kjbaran, haven't downloaded the game, yet, but I think all those iso files are what, together, constitute the entire setup. You may just executed the setup from a random file but the installation extracted data from all of the files."
,Digimaul,2011-08-03T19:16Z,"Kjbaran;

They're not .iso files, the are segments of a rar file. You hit extract on the main one, and it uses all of them to make one whole file from the sections."
,shane_orija,2011-08-04T17:52Z,Works fine.
