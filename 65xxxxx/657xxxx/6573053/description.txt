For those who have not heard of problogger, it is a blog obviously, but it is a really good blog that is an extremely useful resource on how to be a better blogger in so many ways, primarily it's tagline is to making money online with blog tips.


The book however is a complete resource on it's own, based on the popular problogger blog and pooled from it's many blog posts and re formatted into a readable book, with basic introductions into Darren Rowse and Chris Garrett (Who wrote the book in collaboration!) humble beginnings right through to the first steps in blogging and on to some more advanced blogging strategies to build your blogs success and get up to speed on blog marketing the right way.

First I wanted to go through the beginning of the book, because something that I find interesting is the beginnings of a story of someone who becomes successful and comes from a normal background of an every day working guy to six figure income earners later on, so the personal introduction in the blogger Darren Rowse is a valid one, to set you up for the rest of the book and to see how all of the information and tips and techniques come together from someone who has basically trial and errored their way through the blogging medium.

The areas that are covered feature heavily on "What to blog" and "How to blog" So the key areas become more focused later in the blog such as the chapter on blog writing which becomes the prominent chapter in the book and quite rightly so, because writing is the main thing that must be done on a blog so getting it right is the way to go from the very start or at least to find your own way with your blogs.

The book also goes through a simple overview of the setting up of a blog on Wordpress and it states within the book that although wordpress is the preferred blogging platform by many you don't need to feel pressured into this one alone as there are other blog mediums out there to choose from, so the main them I got from reading this book is there is no set rules on choosing the same blogging platforms as everyone else just to choose the right one that is going to suit you and your emerging blogging style.
