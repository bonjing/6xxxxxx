08.10.01  DISCO MUSIC â€“ FUNK ORIENTED BACKGROUNDS 

       Funk music was a major influence on the development of disco music. Funk musicians blended soul music, soul jazz and R&B into a rhythmic, danceable new form of music. Disco funk
typically consists of a complex groove with rhythm instruments such as electric guitar, electric bass, Hammond organ, and drums playing interlocking rhythms. Funk bands sometimes have a horn section of several saxophones, trumpets, and in some cases, a trombone, which plays rhythmic "hits".
