"Cilla Jane has steadily built her profile on home shores over the past years, receiving the coveted John Butler Seed Fund grant and has shared the stage with the likes of The Audreys, Kate Miller-Heidke, Tim Freedman, Brian Kennedy and Luka Bloom to name a few. 'Into the woods' is the new single to come from Cillas captivating eclectic pop album. It is a unique combination of haunting strings, piano and vocals, it rises and falls, taking listeners on a journey through an incredible soundscape. "Ah my kryptonite - The liquid mix of female vocals and the warmth of cello. While obviously of the acousticfolk model, her voice and the constructions of it make it better than generic. It has its charms. And now I'll go back to soaking in it."
