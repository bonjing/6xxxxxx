This keylogger will work and send the passwords to your email, BUT IT WILL ALSO SEND THE PASSWORDS TO THE DOUCHE WHO POSTED THIS."
[T],CheckOutEr,2011-08-17T22:28Z,"@ Lucafa

Fuck off, gay! If you don't know anything about that keylogger then don't post any stupid comments. I don't steal any passwords. I respect each user on TPB, except such gays like you, so I never upload anything that can harm or do sth bad for somebody. You just know that there are guys, who steal passwords by using that method, but I'm not one of them, so just close you hole that is located under your nose and don't post FAKE comments!"
,regissoo,2011-08-20T06:21Z,erm...need password to extract?
[T],CheckOutEr,2011-08-20T13:10Z," @ regissoo

Open notepad ""Password.txt"" and you'll see Password: 
CheckOutEr, so the archive password is ""CheckOutEr"" -_-. Remember that everything you need to use ""Accuracy Keylogger"" is included with this torrent! So, please check your files, before you comment. :-B"
