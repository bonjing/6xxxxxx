,BriarRosethorn,2012-03-16T22:22Z,"Maybe I'm just stupid, but this crack isn't working for me.

I've tried this same process with different torrents and get the same result every time, even when following all the instructions to the last letter.

I downloaded the trial version of PS CS5 and installed it, then downloaded the crack, extracted the main resource file to get the hosts file, then went to Windows/System32/drivers/etc and replaced the original file with the new one. I started up PS CS5 and tried all of the keys given in the read me file, but in all cases, it asks me to log in to my Adobe account, then once I do, tells me it couldn't authenticate the subscription and to close the program and try again."
