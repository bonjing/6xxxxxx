Mother fucker, you are lame, stop bashing froggie, Jesus H Fucking Christ, read the title, its a ""TS"", the movie was released July 31, (today is a whole 24 fucking hours after it was released, incase your too noobish, or too stupid to understand.) Keeping that in mind, it's a pretty damn good TS quality, but it's still TS. It's not an R5 or a DvDRip, if you're going to be that fucking anal bro, don't look at ANYTHING that says CAM or TS. This is intended for the people that just feel they ""HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW""...

Not bad for a cam, however night time scenes are almost impossible to see. A few people walk in front of the camera, (which is always a bad sign at movies). Movie is ok, not great. Jeff Bridges is a much better cowboy then Harrison Ford. The .5 is for Olivia Wilde who is probably the worlds hottest women alive, and when a better version comes out, we will be able to see her sweet ass a bit more clearly. 

Bottom Line: Jeff Bridges is the better cowboy."

,whybitch_itsfree,2011-08-05T08:32Z,"To All Whiners & Complainers:

Stop doing that annoying thing you do, and go pay for a movie, then come back and see if you appreciate that the people here that PROVIDE this service for you, actually did JUST THAT... they paid, so you wouldn't have to. Show a little respect and gratitude, or keep your negative comments to yourself. 

There was never any implied ""theater quality"". You get exactly what you've paid for (I'm not going to do the accounting on this for you)

As for you other complete tools that want to babble mindlessly over whether you should watch it on an xbox or a playstation or whatever fanboy gadget is the latest and greatest..... here is the solution you've been waiting for:

Items Required:
1 x BIG TV (42"" or better)
1 x laptop with HDMI Output
1 x HDMI cable
1 x Wireless Keyboard and Mouse
1 x shut the hell up about which setup is better to watch it on because no one here has $20,000 invested in their very own personal home theater.

I highly doubt someone who knows their Home Theater Audio gear is going to play a bunch of staticky crackly audio from a movie through their X Brand name towers, nor will they play flickery crappy video through their 72"" LED 3D TV.

They would go to the movie theater. And pay.
Full price.
and not bitch.
At all.


But then some of us would have no hobbies.

And be forced to be contributing members of the Gene Pool.

,Polymathj,2011-08-05T09:01Z,"Devils advocate here.  I happen to have a PC, 360 and a PS3 hooked up to my (42"" or bigger) tv.  My PC is a 5 year old model that hesitates when high action sequences are going on.  It's a great machine for most indie/foreign and slower films but when it comes to action.  I use one of my systems.  Because it's made to play high def video... really well.  Like, it's only function at concept was to do just that.

I upload, I seed well over 100% and, I bitch.  Because when my UL's are going out, their in a useable format by most.  MP4 or AVI in a suitable resolution.  

It's not rocket surgery, you want the most people to get the most out of your work.  Make it accessible.  Make it right.

Negative numbers will speed up the audio if it is behind, and positive numbers will sync it if the sound is happening first, then the action. I did not view  this print, but have used this methodology in the past. Generally speaking, if the audio is about a second behind the action, then -200 to -400 seems to do the trick. 60 seconds ahead seems a little much, given there are 4 pages of comments and yours is t he first with this issue. Might I suggest a new codec pack, from somewhere like cnet (download dot com, just google it) - I got my codec pack there and between that and vlc, never have a problem I can't solve on my own, beit sound, gamma lighting in dark places (which this film has many of), etc. Again, have not seen this print, but this does work.

The reality is... Its you who cant pronounce the English language correctly, and insist on drawling every single fucking word out like a slack jawed local.

Even the rich, well to do Americans cant pronounce words correctly, or speak properly.

Like... 'Know'.. Is pronounced 'no'. But an american? Pronounces it.. 'noww'. Like you add emphasis and elongate every word, like some sort of retarded plank.

I dont actually give a shit about pronunciation, but please dont believe for a second that you are getting it right over the English... Your accent deviates from how it is meant to sound, not the other way. 

If you cant understand it, then snort some coke, get your brain wired to work alittle quicker and understand words spoken at a faster pace than american drawl.

I didn't have an issue with audio sync, but if you do, most players have a remedy.

As a movie, it was OK. I am a big sci-fi fan and expect most movies to be kinda bad. I'm glad I didn't spend $10 for it in the theatre. I will watch again when a DVD rip comes out.

We pity you spastic boy

Your mum fucked your brother to make you, and your brother must have been a giant hedgehog in order for her to give birth to such a big prick like yourself.

you have officially redifined the definition of the word CUNT

now fuck off you inbred"
,thestigiam,2011-09-05T01:29Z,"oh and guys... please note that trying to offend this muppet Bantha-Poodoo with phrases like cumming on his sister or fucking his mum will not have the desired effect, he is obviously very insecure and hurt inside.. probably from the years of abuse and bullying he has been subjected to.
Im sure his sister and his mum allow him to partake in sexual activities with them as.. thats what inbred, uneducated little freaks enjoy.. so rather than making him angry you are probably spurring him on to masturbate at the sheer thought of his naked family.
Its twisted little fucks like him that grow up with no friends, no education and sick little minds that feel it is the rest of the world to blame, and do things like take a machine gun to their school to unload their hurt.

as i said before... 
Bantha-Poodoo = CUNT!!!"
,Coenhel,2011-09-05T02:10Z,"I had to break my comment cherry on this one... Bantha Poodoo is a fine example of a republican....
thanks for sharing froggie100!! you rock!"
,benenya,2011-09-05T05:01Z,"Look at all you saps responding to that dude""Bantha-Poodoo. He is probably 9 years old and getting a hard on just from the reaction he is getting from you. If he is an adult then he is more than likely getting from your reactions. Good grief, don't give him the time of day, move on, it's pathetic. "
,piizda,2011-09-06T18:35Z,is this camera rip?
,umlungu99,2011-09-06T23:33Z,"Creds to the uploader. Clearly without people like yourselves that take the time and trouble none of this would mean a damn. Pity you have to be subjected to the inane ranting of a..... ahh shit why bother, I am sure you get my sentiment.

@Dibbla: With you on the racial slurs - where is it supposed to lead I wonder. And the constant need to re-assure everyone that it is a 100% white American...? I think the word ""trash"" was omitted in error at the end of that remark."

,Vorsten,2011-09-12T01:47Z,"Gonna be honest @froggie100 this TS was unwatchable  for me. Thanks very much for the effort put to putting this up, but I would also advise people to wait for a better quality upload.

,pickle4,2011-09-14T21:37Z,"Sorry all for the moron ""realist77"" but the USA pumps out retards like this guy like British Petroleum spills oil.

He thinks greece is socialist, because it's run by German banks... Which is to say he doesn't know jack shit about anyone and has (obviously) never worked a day in his life. Guaranteed he grew up with a rich daddy and thinks he ""worked for it.""

This is why the USA is in the crapper. But entitled morons like his are thankfully a minority of our country, even if they tend to be concentrated among those with property and money."

Just saying.

""it is too big...(2.03 GB)...most movies have 600-900 MB....not the original...""

Most DVD movies are 4.7 GB or dual layer is like 8GB... Maybe the bad quality versions  you get are 600-900mb

blu rays can be 22+ GB"
,0n13L,2011-10-25T01:16Z,"@pickle4
dude you write a comment to rate the video. not to insult different countries or nationalities and what not. you know how annoying it is when someone reads the comments to find reviews on the quality and find morons like you posting stupid comments about everything other than the quality? gotta a problem with someone? take it to a blog or a forum or hell, even facebook. but leave those types of comments out of TPB. Thanks for the upload froggie :)"
