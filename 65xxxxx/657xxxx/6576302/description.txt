Having lost an election, been thrown out by their party, or retired on grounds of ill-health, what do former British prime ministers do? In the first book to look at the lives, political roles and influence of former prime ministers, Kevin Theakston offers a comprehensive analysis of all the former prime ministers from Robert Walpole in the 18th century to Tony Blair today. This lively and informative book will appeal to those interested in British history as well as in contemporary politics. "You are very ex as an ex-prime minister", it has been said. "The telephone goes and immediately you think, Oh goodness me, the United Nations is sitting", Margaret Thatcher admitted. "Then you realize that it's no longer you any more." Some former prime ministers fade into the background, but others have continued to play a significant role in politics â€“ sometimes constructively, but sometimes quite the reverse. Some enhance their reputations after they leave Number 10, but others damaged their reputations badly. This book sheds new light on the people who have held the highest office in British government.
