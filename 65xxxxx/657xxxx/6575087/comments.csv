,Torolava,2011-08-01T07:16Z,This is actually one of the best Cam grabs I've ever seen. usapeianb is a spammer. I hate that. You go to his link and it's download this and buy that. Fuck off.
,uMakeMeCry,2011-08-01T13:55Z,Links not working. Can u put those screens to other site?
,tatusan,2011-08-01T14:54Z,thanks uploader 
,JackAssin,2011-08-01T14:58Z,"How come non of these are announced as ""cam,"" lol.
Just started and I'm at a & hr. 45 min. ETA.  Well worth the wait I hope.

I can't figure how Captain America went right up on cam bootleg within 9 hours but there was the huge holdup on this fucker... oh well, like has been said many times before, ""it's free!"""
,JackAssin,2011-08-01T14:59Z,"7 hr. 45 min. ETA, that is."

,El-solo,2011-08-01T20:47Z,@bonshead.....sorry you're wrong...TS and Telesync are two different types of video...get your facts straight before you try and correct others....look it up it's not that hard.
,wenzlowsky,2011-08-01T22:23Z,excellent copy for a cam. a/v 8 good work. keep it up this way! thx for sharing.
,XxXZeroCool84,2011-08-01T22:49Z,"I just want to say, i luv you Razvanripper lol. Thanks bro. I'm downloading it now. Looking forward to Planet of the Apes! :)"
,soupcip,2011-08-01T23:41Z,"It's decent, but the dark parts (half the action scenes, half the movie really, if not more) are just plain unwatchable. Its just a dark ..uh.. screen. totally black-greyish. I feel like movie companies deliberately make movies darker and darker for a few years now, cos they know it won't transfer to a cam. "
,soupcip,2011-08-01T23:52Z,"@ el-solo ...I looked it up. Wiki clearly states that TS = telesync...or are you saying we should look better , and not trust wiki ? :P"
,soupcip,2011-08-02T00:00Z,"@ El-solo

Cam . Cam video and audio.

TS = TeleSync . Basically a cam(albeit on a tripod) with direct source audio.

TC = Telecine . Analog reel to digital format

So I looked further and everywhere it states TS = TeleSync so El-solo, I do not know what you are on about. I'd say get your facts straight :P"
,MHawk2,2011-08-02T00:53Z,"usapeianb  Seriously, this guy is a fucking idiot.  Sad his comment is the first but the most worthless."
,TorrentJezuz,2011-08-02T01:34Z,Is any uploader aware that we cant see the screens uploaded to imageshack because it sais it violates something. So why cant they upload it onto a better site where we can see the screens. Well anyway thanks razvanripper great upload.

This is a very good cam jobbie. It is just a pity half the film is made in the dark. "
,Tom_thomas,2011-08-04T23:25Z,I got a download of 45min ... maybe someone should upgrade there P.C. - and stop Bitching - it's free 
,ChasUGC,2011-08-05T06:29Z,"The Audio is horrible. But, it is somewhat watchable. The dark parts had to be over bright so it got a bleached effect. A=4, v=5"
,Sneeuwballetjes,2011-08-05T20:33Z,What a fuck movie....expected much of it and hope the sequel will be better

,blusniffer,2011-08-12T18:58Z,Cheers but poor contrast night/indoor scenes render it unwatchable and ruins the film!
,Tom_thomas,2011-08-13T06:11Z,"I got Very Bad Audio - and a consent high pitch sound , to hard for me too deal with .. Dumped it .. 12aug2011 9:11pm MST - Sorry A  one star"
