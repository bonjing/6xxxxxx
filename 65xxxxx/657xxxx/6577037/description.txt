Primal Scream's seminal album Screamadelica was released in 1991, and synthesized the
band's rock n roll roots with the dance culture of that time; for many, the album's sound and
imagery came to be regarded as quintessential symbols of the acid house era, perfectly
catching the spirit and mood of the early 90s.

Using rare archive footage and special performances, this film tells the story of
Screamadelica and its hit singles and dance anthems Loaded, Movin' On Up, Come Together
and Don't Fight It, Feel It. From the formation of the band in Glasgow to winning the first-ever
Mercury prize, the band members explain the record's inception with insights from main
producer Andrew Weatherall, Creation Records founder Alan McGee and many others
involved with or inspired by this joyful record.

Screamadelica both defines a generation and transcends its time, and is a true Classic
Album.
