             1939 - A world plagued with unrest and                  
              upheaval. Adolf Hitler's ruthless ambition             
               for German expansion in Eastern Europe is               
                becoming increasingly violent and inhuman.             
               Whereas another nation, India, struggles in          
             its fight for freedom against the British               
             as the idealistic Mahatama Gandhi continues            
           to appeal to his countrymen to adopt a stand          
            of non-violence. A stark contrast in                 
           ideologies even with an eventual common             
             opponent, Gandhi one day decides to pen a             
           letter to the German dictator... a letter he           
            hoped would persuade Hitler to change his              
            path and avoid the Second World War, avoid             
            the massive calamity that it would bring on.
