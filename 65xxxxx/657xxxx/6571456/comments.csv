You should be deleated from the site. start the petition here bayers..."
,crossfire6,2011-10-01T17:38Z,This is hard for me to believe but it is d/l now at a consistent 240-250kb.  Wonderful!  If it finishes up for me I will seed this high speed for 72 hours.
,crossfire6,2011-10-01T19:12Z,"Stopped.  Apparently done at only 86%.  If someone seeded this to 86% and then cut it off intentionally just to keep someone from completing the download, you will hopefully have your testicles chewed up with cancer cells.  This wasn't funny at all. "
,omega777,2011-10-23T18:52Z,Yes crossfire I'm stuck at 86% as well for last month - and it appears there are 17 other people still trying to complete as well - not counting those that have given up - how about re-upping it scenebalance?
,shimel,2011-10-30T09:53Z,also stuck at 86% and have been waiting for years for this upload!
,_purple_,2012-01-31T16:58Z,Dead torrent. Where is the rest 14% of the torrent?
