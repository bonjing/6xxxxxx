,Distortion311,2011-08-09T04:58Z,"Anyone know whats happening with this weeks ep? The showblog says aug 8 is supposed to be a new episode.  With an 8pm air time 11pm eastern seems a bit late. Just running behind tonight?  This is the first week it hasn't been posted when I checked the first time.  Nothing but love, I hope nothing went wrong! "
