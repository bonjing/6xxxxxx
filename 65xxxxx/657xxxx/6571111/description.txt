                           DESCRiPTiON 

 A report on the Nigerian confidence tricksters who target British women by    
 assuming fake identities on dating websites, then defrauding their victims out
 of thousands of pounds. This film hears from two victims - although for one   
 the story took a surprising turn when the man she thought was romancing her   
 confessed his true identity. A reformed scammer in Lagos also explains the    
 thinking behind the Nigerians' deceit. Part of the First Cut strand.
          
                                 Enjoy!
