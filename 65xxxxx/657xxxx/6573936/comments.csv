,Jem555ibanez,2011-10-28T16:34Z,"Hello, Why does my screen go black when i start the game up and say out of timing. I can hear the game running but have no picture. Ive messed about with resolution settings etc but still won't work. I'm running xp x64 sp2 with 256mb nvidia GeForce 7025 graphics card ,8Gb ram, 2.8Ghz processor."

,mcordell,2011-11-25T00:39Z,Great game!  Verifying that it works! Thank you uploader!
,sikkinz,2011-12-11T03:45Z,"For all the peeps having that black screen problem on Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 Platinum, try editing the Options.txt file on the following path (for Vista):

C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Atari\RCT3

Open the file using Notepad, then change the Resolution in the first line to 1024 768 or 800 600.

Save the file and now try to run the game. It should work fine.

XP Users can find the Options.txt file on the following path:

C:\Documents and Settings\\Application Data\Atari\RCT3

You may have to enable the ""Show Hidden Files and Folders"" option in Folder Options first as Application Data/AppData is a hidden folder.

Thank you CarlesNeo for this amazing upload. Thumbs Up."

,melskies,2011-12-11T20:16Z,"Easy install and works great, except the scenarios don't show up? I can only play sandbox mode. "
,davieboye,2011-12-15T01:49Z,"awesome! 10min download!
i missed this game since i broke the disc, so this is awesome!"
,Dex_Luther,2011-12-15T06:25Z,WORST GAME EVER CREATED. The download works fine. The problem is the game is a piece of shit. I remember having more fun playing the first one on windows 95 than I did struggling with the tools in this game. Paths and queses that place as single blocks instead of linking together for no apparent reason is just one example of the suck that is this game.
