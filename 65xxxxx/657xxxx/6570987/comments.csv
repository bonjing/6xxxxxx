i am big fan of aksman vinyl rips, which i see you used to upload here in torrent form.  is there anywhere else you know of that puts his releases into timely torrent form?  he puts out so much great stuff every day, but i hate dealing with 4 of 5 separate folders, having to wait to start the free downloads, etc.  torrents are so much easier.

any advice on where to look would be much appreciated!"
