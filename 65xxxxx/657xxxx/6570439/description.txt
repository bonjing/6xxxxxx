Storyline: Upon TrÃ©'s arrival, his father instructs him to rake the entire front lawn and assigns other household responsibilities, which include cleaning and maintaining their home. Furious explains that, although these tasks may seem unfair and harsh, learning responsibility will make TrÃ© a man and keep him from ending up dead or in jail. Later, during his first night living with his father, TrÃ© hears his father firing at a burglar. The police arrive more than an hour later and decide the crime is unimportant because nothing was taken and the burglar escaped unharmed.
