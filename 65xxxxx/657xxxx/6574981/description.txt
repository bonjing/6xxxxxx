                Tick Tock.
                The police are called to investigate a horrifying gun
                attack which has left a nightclub peppered with
                bullets and two victims bleeding out on the floor.
                But the shocks do not end there, as the shooters
                begin a deadly rampage through the streets of London,
                and Ronnie and Matt find themselves up against the
                clock as they desperately hunt down the
                Bonnie-and-Clyde duo responsible for the bloody
                massacre. When the violent pair are brought to trial,
                the defence barrister claims that one of the two
                suspects was more innocent victim than vicious
                killer. Aware that there are two sides to every
                story, can the team get to the bottom of the case?
