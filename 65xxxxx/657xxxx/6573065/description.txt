    Ronnie James Dio, one of heavy metal's all-time greatest singers died    
    less than a year after being diagnosed with stomach cancer. He was       
    67. With his powerful signature vocals and doom-laden lyrics, Ronnie     
    James Dio fronted several iconic bands during his career: Elf,           
    Rainbow, Black Sabbath and, of course, Dio. Possessed with one of the    
    most recognizable voices in rock music, Dio's onstage theatrics,         
    medieval themes and cool stage presence helped win the adulation of      
    generations of metal fans and musicians. This unauthorized DVD           
    contains interviews, perfomances and stories about Ronnie J.Dio.
