The Boeing (formerly McDonnell Douglas) C-17 Globemaster III is a large military transport aircraft. Developed for the United States Air Force (USAF) from the 1980s to the early 1990s by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the C-17 is used for rapid airlift of troops and cargo to main operating bases or forward operating bases throughout the world. The C-17 can also carry out tactical airlift, medical evacuation, and airdrop missions. The C-17 carries the name of two previous but unrelated, piston-engined military transport planes, the Douglas C-74 Globemaster and the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II.

In addition to the U.S. Air Force, the C-17 is operated by the Royal Air Force, Royal Australian Air Force, Canadian Forces Air Command, Qatar Emiri Air Force, United Arab Emirates Air Force, and the Heavy Airlift Wing of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Indian Air Force had ordered the C-17 but it is not yet in service.
