,bobodidley,2011-08-01T06:24Z,Well i see wetmouse  you are a fine one to talk. You downloads other people stuff! And i see you have not even as much as uploaded anything to this site. so again you are a fine one to talk. You bitch about other people requesting stuff and i see nothing from you??????and not even as much as a thanks. I was the first to upload the Area51 C-17 since it was out. So that is my 2penny's worth
,mysteryfancy,2011-08-01T10:24Z,"Mickyfinny Hello, 
I thank you for this rarity. A good C-17 Globemaster III is not easy to get. The C-17 was at Area51 me until now not known. Thanks again for this aircraft."
,Jimstalk,2011-08-01T10:28Z,"Chill out guys.In a few days all of you will post requests for the 737ngx so dont blame other ppl who really need something that they cannot afford to buy.Actually thats the point of this site.Payware is becoming freeware and to achieve this,pirates need to know what to crack."
,saintamadas,2011-08-01T11:43Z,"Thanks Mickfinny! If a tree falls in the forest and the sound aint heard in the city does it mean the tree is not down?
