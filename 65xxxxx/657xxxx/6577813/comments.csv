Slavery in the Bible



Except for murder, slavery has got to be one of the most immoral things a person can do.  
Yet slavery is rampant throughout the Bible in both the Old and New Testaments.  The Bible clearly approves of 
slavery in many passages, and it goes so far as to tell how to obtain slaves, how hard you can beat them, and 
when you can have sex with the female slaves.



Many Jews and Christians will try to ignore the moral problems of slavery by saying that these slaves were 
actually servants or indentured servants.  Many translations of the Bible use the word ""servant"", ""bondservant"", 
or ""manservant"" instead of ""slave"" to make the Bible seem less immoral than it really is.  While many slaves may 
have worked as household servants, that doesn't mean that they were not slaves who were bought, sold, and treated 
worse than livestock.

The following passage shows that slaves are clearly property to be bought and sold like livestock.



However, you may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you.  
You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land.  
You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance.  
You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way.  
(Leviticus 25:44-46 NLT)"
,zulu-1,2011-08-02T22:06Z,"
    The following passage describes how the Hebrew slaves are to be treated.

 If you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve for only six years.  Set him free in the seventh year, and he will owe 
you nothing for his freedom.  If he was single when he became your slave and then married afterward, only he will 
go free in the seventh year.  But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife will be freed with him.  
If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in 
the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master.  But the slave may plainly declare, 
'I love my master, my wife, and my children.  I would rather not go free.'  If he does this, his master must 
present him before God.  Then his master must take him to the door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl.  
After that, the slave will belong to his master forever.  (Exodus 21:2-6 NLT)

 Notice how they can get a male Hebrew slave to become a permanent slave by keeping his wife and children hostage 
until he says he wants to become a permanent slave.  What kind of family values are these?"
,zulu-1,2011-08-02T22:07Z,"The following passage describes the sickening practice of sex slavery.  How can anyone think it is moral to 
sell your own daughter as a sex slave?

When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are.  
If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again.  But he is not allowed to 
sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her.  And if the slave girl's owner 
arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter.  
If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep 
with her as his wife.  If he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave as a free woman without making any 
payment.  (Exodus 21:7-11 NLT)

So these are the Bible family values!  A man can buy as many sex slaves as he wants as long as he feeds them, 
clothes them, and screws them!"
,zulu-1,2011-08-02T22:07Z,"What does the Bible say about beating slaves?  It says you can beat both male and female slaves with a rod so 
hard that as long as they don't die right away you are cleared of any wrong doing.


When a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies under his hand, he shall be 
punished.  If, however, the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished, since the slave is his 
own property.  (Exodus 21:20-21 NAB)


You would think that Jesus and the New Testament would have a different view of slavery, but slavery is still 
approved of in the New Testament, as the following passages show.

 Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear.  Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ.  
(Ephesians 6:5 NLT)



Christians who are slaves should give their masters full respect so that the name of God and his teaching will not 
be shamed.  If your master is a Christian, that is no excuse for being disrespectful.  You should work all the 
harder because you are helping another believer by your efforts.  Teach these truths, Timothy, and encourage 
everyone to obey them.  (1 Timothy 6:1-2 NLT)


In the following parable, Jesus clearly approves of beating slaves even if they didn't know they were doing 
anything wrong.

The servant will be severely punished, for though he knew his duty, he refused to do it.  
""But people who are not aware that they are doing wrong will be punished only lightly.  
Much is required from those to whom much is given, and much more is required from those to whom much more is 
given.""  (Luke 12:47-48 NLT)"

all the holy books in/and  (ALL) religions contains what is called (Miracles)/(supernatural)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle
""A miracle is an event attributed to divine intervention. Sometimes an event is also attributed (in part) to 
a miracle worker, saint, or religious leader. A miracle is sometimes thought of as a perceptible 
interruption of the laws of nature. Others suggest that God may work with the laws of nature to 
perform what people perceive as miracles [1] Theologians say that, with divine providence, 
God regularly works through created nature yet is free to work without, above, or against it as well.[2]

A miracle is often considered a fortuitous event: compare with an Act of God.""


can any body really try to debate :-
The Bible has stories about a talking snake (Genesis 3:4-5); 
a tree bearing fruit which, when eaten, gives knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 2:17; 3:5-7);

and other people rising from the dead (e.g., I Kings 17:21-22; II Kings 4:32-35; Acts 9:37-40). 

There are also accounts of the sun standing still (Joshua 10:13); 
the parting of a sea (Exodus 14:21-22); iron floating (II Kings 6:5-6); 
the sunâ€™s shadow going back ten degrees (II Kings 20:9-11); 
a witch bringing the ghost of Samuel back from the dead (I Samuel 28:3-15); 
disembodied fingers writing on a wall (Daniel 5:5); 
a man living for three days and nights in the belly of a fish (Jonah 1:17); 
people walking on water (Matthew 14:26-29); 
a virgin impregnated by God (Matthew 1:20); 
a pool of water that can cure ailments of those who dip in it (John 5:2-4);

what about norway bombing and shooting children, Anders Behring Breivik was not muslim
what about IRA (Catholic, Protestant) ,and ETA...and many otheres all over the world,
what about Rwanda Massacres
In 1994 in the small African country of Rwanda in just a few months several hundred thousand civilians were 
butchered, apparently a conflict of the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups.
For quite some time I heard only rumors about Catholic clergy actively involved in the 1994 Rwanda massacres. 
Odd denials of involvement were printed in Catholic church journals, before even anybody had openly accused 
members of the church.
Then, 10/10/96, in the newscast of S2 Aktuell, Germany - a station not at all critical to Christianity - 
the following was stated: 


""Anglican as well as Catholic priests and nuns are suspect of having actively participated in murders. Especially the conduct of a certain Catholic priest has been occupying the public mind in Rwanda's capital Kigali for months. He was minister of the church of the Holy Family and allegedly murdered Tutsis in the most brutal manner. He is reported to have accompanied marauding Hutu militia with a gun in his cowl. In fact there has been a bloody slaughter of Tutsis seeking shelter in his parish. Even two years after the massacres many Catholics refuse to set foot on the threshold of their church, because to them the participation of a certain part of the clergy in the slaughter is well established. There is almost no church in Rwanda that has not seen refugees - women, children, old - being brutally butchered facing the crucifix.
According to eyewitnesses clergymen gave away hiding Tutsis and turned them over to the machetes of the Hutu militia.
In connection with these events again and again two Benedictine nuns are mentioned, both of whom have fled into a Belgian monastery in the meantime to avoid prosecution. According to survivors one of them called the 
Hutu killers and led them to several thousand people who had sought shelter in her monastery. By force the doomed were driven out of the churchyard and were murdered in the presence of the nun right in front of the gate. The other one is also reported to have directly cooperated with the murderers of the Hutu militia. In her case again witnesses report that she watched the slaughtering of people in cold blood and without showing response. She is even accused of having procured some petrol used by the killers to set on 
fire and burn their victims alive..."" [S2]

Second I have no problem with satirical cartoons, in fact I think they are healthy. However I do have a problem with racial slurs & the blind, ignorant hatred that they stem from. I fully support free speech, which includes racist propaganda, but I also have the right to remind you how stupid it is. 

All this energy wasted on arguing about archaic, obsolete beliefs is sad. There is so much more to life than pointless jabber about mystical beings that never existed. The world will be a much happier, saner place when everyone finally wakes up & realizes man created his gods, not the reverse. Then people all over will say something like, ""Wow that was crazy, we just wasted thousands of years fighting over nothing... Fuck it! Let's party!"""

I donÂ´t believe in any religion, but I find this one particularly backward and revolting."

ramikaz - ""queer kike"" & ""cow worshipers"" (although I kinda agree about fox news...)
viedma - ""old towel-head ass lifting worshipers"""
,markshin,2011-08-04T17:24Z,"Well, zulu-1, try to understand that the burden of proof, for the supernatural claims you believe, is on you. You need to prove the validity of the claims of your religion before any unbiased observer gives any credit to you. Citing stories of miracles - means nothing. Proving that these miracles actually happen would mean something. Ignoring the ludicrous claims of your holy books and attacking the ludicrous claims of a different religion does nothing to support your stance. Honestly, I think you're naive. You've never questioned the possibility that all you've been indoctrinated with is tall tales, fables, and hateful propaganda. When religion promotes hate, it needs to be exposed as the filth it is."
