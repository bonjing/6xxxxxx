,CrashenBurn,2011-07-30T21:53Z,Can anyone tell me how to combine subs with the movie so I can watch it properly? Thanks
,FreeFallIntoFear,2011-07-30T22:33Z,"@CrashenBurn : download the subtitle @ opensubtitlesDOTorg, extract it to the same place where you downloaded the movie, rename the subtitle file just like the movie file name, for example: if the movie file is named as ""Blitz2011-Vision.avi""
rename the srt file (subtitle) as ""Blitz2011-Vision.srt""

,pirateman2,2011-07-31T16:36Z,"Just curious, whats in it for people that upload torrents. I tried googling the subject but nothing.
I mean, sure, Piratebay make money by ads like for gambling, dick enlargement, fuck sites etcâ€¦ but whats in it for the skulls? Do they get a percentage or a piece of the action based on the number of downloads?
I donâ€™t buy in to the â€œthey just wanna shareâ€ BS. Nobody is that stupid or bored to spend hours making torrent files every day and then hosting the actual files for many gigs just to be nice.
What gives?
If uâ€™r gonna shit on me for asking, now is your chance."

great movie
mr zone you rock sir"
,BrianBrew,2011-08-02T00:33Z,"Watch it just for the scene with the hurley & for a great acting job by Considine. Statham does what he always does which is entertaining, even if it won't win him any Oscars anytime soon. Other than that it's a fairly dull action movie. Worth a watch if you've got little else to do"
,mabus666,2011-08-02T00:58Z,"jeez , this movie sucked , about halfway i deleted it

heres what the makers must have tought
badboy hardass statham + short movie title = $$$$$ much like his previous crapturds the expendables - the mechanic and death race

what bothers me most is the high imdb rating these movies get , totally insane

for me he had his top with the transporter


"
,camo12345,2011-08-02T05:26Z,"@ mabus666 

Statham has been in a lot of great movies, Crank, Snatch, Lock Stock and two smoking barrels... personally I think the majority of his movies are better than most of the action movies that come out. Maybe it's just you that doesn't like him... hence the ratings on IMDB"

Not that I'm not grateful for the uploaders efforts, but this movie is booooring..... I've downloaded a lot of bad movies and certainly like other Statham flicks, but doesn't get much more predictable than this one....bad acting, trite characters that you could care less whether they die or not, and a villain that ya just wanna turn the movie off so you don't have to see or hear him anymore...all coupled a blaring soundtrack whether there is anything going on in the scene or not..."
