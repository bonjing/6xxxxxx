Two out-of-work archaeologists in Egypt discover evidence of the burial
place of the ancient Egyptian princess Ananka.  After receiving funding
from an eccentric magician and his beautiful daughter, they set out into
the desert only to be terrorized by a sinister high priest and Kharis
the living mummy, who are the guardians of Ananka's tomb.
