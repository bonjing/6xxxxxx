The Police were an English rock band formed in London in 1977.
For the vast majority of their history, the band consisted of Sting (lead vocals, bass), Andy Summers (guitars) and Stewart Copeland (drums).
The Police became globally popular in the late 1970s and are generally regarded as one of the first New Wave groups to achieve mainstream success, playing a style of rock that was influenced by punk, reggae, and jazz.
Their 1983 album, Synchronicity, was number one on both the UK Album Chart and the US Billboard 200, and sold over 8,000,000 copies in the US.
The group disbanded in 1984, but reunited in early 2007 for a one-off world tour lasting until August 2008.
The Police have sold more than 50 million albums worldwide, and were the world's highest-earning musicians in 2008, thanks to their reunion tour.
