Afraid you'll need to be more competent if you want to keep the FBI from imprisoning your brethren.  Pictures of a help desk dude at his desk in Afghanistan..damn, the nation is really going to shit.  GIANT Fail - Total Hype.  I hope these guys are relying on more than social media to make their point. "

,skepticle,2011-08-04T01:27Z,"Remember people, the security agencies WANT a cyber ""war"". If you think for a moment that small outings of their dealings is going to make a difference to them, compared to how much they can look like the good guys when infiltrated ""criminally"", you have a lot to learn about control of mass perception. Still... lulz!"
