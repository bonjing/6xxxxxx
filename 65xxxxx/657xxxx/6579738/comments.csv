Interesting to watch how Beckel represents the 'Old School' Pre World War Two Pinko Commie/Liberal/Socialist/Progressive Democtrat party machine politic line with a straight face most of the time.  If he had a 'bama accent, I'd swear he was from Dothan, Alabama!!"

,pirateradiorocks,2011-08-03T23:25Z,"Be patient, he'll start seeding again when he can.  I'm still at 52% and we've had no power in the last 4 hours, due to storms.  Looks like most are catching up to me in the peers list at least.  You might thank skJGZV6z, only takes 5 seconds...       "
