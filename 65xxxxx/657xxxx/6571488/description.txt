Paul Simons Concert in Central Park in 1991. No Art Garfunkle this time around.  This is an awesome concert that sadly has never been released on DVD or Blu Ray. The original source was VHS, and I saved them from you tube, so dont expect awesome quality.  However, its here and complete. The first few minutes the sound is off with the video.  It straightens up after a while tho, so I havent gone thru the trouble of fixing it. Please feel free to repost, and Enjoy!
