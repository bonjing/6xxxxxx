A reluctant young hero holds the key to the future of mankind in the palm of his hand in this eye-popping, sci-fi adventure.

It's the year 3028 and the Drej, a vicious alien race, have destroyed Earth. Fifteen years later, a young man named Cale learns he possesses a genetically encoded map to the Titan, a spaceship that holds the secrets to the salvation of the human race. With the Drej in hot pursuit, Cale blasts off with the new crew of the Valkyrie in an attempt to find the Titan before the Drej destroy it... along with mankind's last chance for a home of their own.

Featuring an all-star voice cast that includes Matt Damon and Drew Barrymore and an edgy, out-of-this-world soundtrack, Titan A.E. is an intergalactic thrill ride for a new generation.
