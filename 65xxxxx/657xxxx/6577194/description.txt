"A great film. And it truly IS America.
--Adam Curry

"I was surprised by all the humor, and I loved that you guys made such hardcore, principled points without beating your audience over the head with abstruse philosophy."
-Claire Wolfe

"I'm impressed with how well you presented such a difficult synthesis of two freedom-loving cultures which often view each other as antithetical. The message of 'Live and let live' shines through in this very hip and unique video."
--Boston T. Party
