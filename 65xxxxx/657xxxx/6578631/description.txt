A quick-tempered, flamboyantly-dressed,      
retired hit-man returns to India for one     
last job. Just don't call him "Buddah"       
                                             
BBUDDAH HOGA TERRA BAAP has the 69-year-     
old Bachchan enacting the role of a defiant, 
flamboyant hitman in his inimitable style.   
With BBUDDAH HOGA TERRA BAAP, the angry      
young man of the 1970s and 1980s re-surfaces 
to re-live various roles that he enacted in  
those memorable films. This one's a masala   
film all the way. Right from a medley of     
Bachchan hits to the expertly crafted action 
sequences to the by-now-famous Bachchan      
baritone, this one has it all.
