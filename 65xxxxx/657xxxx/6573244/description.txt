Description: 
Three-part series in which art historian James Fox explores 
20th-century British art, a period he considers an extraordinary 
flowering of genius.In the decades after the Second 
World War, at a time when many had lost their faith in 
humanity, British artists turned to the great figurative 
painting tradition to address the biggest questions of all: 
what does it mean to be human and how do we create a 
more humane world? Such existential angst is captured in 
Lucien Freud's harrowing early portraits and Graham 
Sutherland's Pembrokeshire landscapes. Francis Bacon 
stared deep into his own soul to explore the human 
capacity for evil, while Richard Hamilton warned against 
the false hope of consumerism. As national pessimism 
gave way to a new optimism, David Hockney dared to 
suggest Paradise might be available to us all. But in the 
early 1970s, just as the world finally began to recognise 
the genius of Britain's painterly tradition, young artists at 
home turned against it.
