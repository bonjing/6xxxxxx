Originally on a VHS tape, the video was captured with Sony Vegas, rerendered to 16:9 ratio and the sound was enhanced using Sony Sound Forge. The irrelevent extra scenes(the non music ones) have been deleted so the show consists entirely of AC/DC music. It was recorded in France in 1980 shortly before the death of Bon Scott
