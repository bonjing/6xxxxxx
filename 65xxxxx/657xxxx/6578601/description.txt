The 60 tracks here, almost four hours of music (represent the best of hundreds of hours of taped material on an audiorecord mobile unit) that comprises a 14LP set originally recorded in 1980 and released only in Germany. The package contains a 48-page booklet with extensive liner notes and 35 photos. In 1980, two young European blues enthusiasts realized their dream by crisscrossing the American South to find and record unknown or forgotten acoustic country blues musicians in the 'field': backwoods shacks, small-town living rooms, and on rural front porches. Their two-month trip captured per-for-mances by 25 practitioners of this vanishing indigenous musical form, many of whom performed with or learned from the great pre-war blues masters. This compilation includes not only unaccompanied acoustic guitarists and piano players, but also fife-and-drum bands, one-string diddley bow twangers, broom-scrapers, jug-blowers and field hollerers.
