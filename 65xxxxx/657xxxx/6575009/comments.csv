ok my bad, i put them on a hard drive to watch through blu ray, and it through out the sync, for what ever reason E14 is the last in line, but i have to go too near the beginning to find E 15 & E16.
Again my apologies ozzman24 nice upload and thanx for this torrent, just started getting into this program.  "
