,davidmasta,2011-08-01T22:51Z,"I have seen the first 7 and this is not it. According to Wikipedia this is episode 8, and I would agree because I have seen the other 7 as I stated before.

The first magician is indeed Shawn Farquhar, as shown by the sample and the actual show."
,boris_37,2011-08-02T04:49Z,"I just thought i would add as i was bothered davidmasta never clarified.

This is episode 8 if you count the first episode (pilot) as the first episode, which the website TVRage the seeder linked DOES NOT.

It is the 8th ""show"" in the first season but NOT the 8th episode. The pilot does NOT count as the first episode.

It is a mislabel as shown and confirmed by the TVRage link they provided as well as by the first comment brokenhip."
,harvey_weinstein,2011-08-12T21:49Z,Is this the last episode in the season then? I'm not seeing a ninth.
