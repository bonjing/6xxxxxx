A bit late posted here - already a couple days old elsewhere. TPB was having problems when I posted this elsewhere. I will continue with simultaneous posts in 3 spots the future.

The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This twenty-fourth alphabetical installment is: DC from Hi-Ht

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 800-850gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.


================================
I WILL BE ON VACATION WITH FAMILY THE WEEK OF JULY 30-AUG 5.  I could do some torrents by remote access to a computer back home, but I decided I don't want to do any torrents unless I'm around to make sure everything is ok. This is my last one till about Monday Aug 8. If you are on the other side of the international date line from me, your dates will vary.

Some cover pictures for you

Today's offering: DC from H-Hh

Enjoy! 


Hi Hi Puffy Amiyumi 01-03 (2006)
     That this is what it is, do not blame me!

Hiding Place, The (Piranha Press
     Nothing to do with Corie Ten Boom - if you know that dramatic and inspirational true story of the same name.

High Moon 01-04 (zudacomics-DC Web(2007-2010)
Generally, yes I belive the moon could be described as high.

High Roads 01-06 (Cliffhanger!(2002)
Highwaymen 01-05 (WS(2007)
Highwaymen 01-05 (WS(2007)

     "O ye'll tak' the high road and I'll tak' the low road,
     An' I'll be in Scotland afore ye;
     But me and my true love will never meet again
     On the bonnie, bonnie banks O' Loch Lomond."
          That would be a more melancholy line if I had ever met my true love there. Sometimes one wonders though, as life goes on, about that "one woman" left behind - did I make the right choice all those long years ago?

History of Violence, A (Paradox(1997)
     Speaking simply, history is written (or other wise recorded) or it is not history - it's archaeology. So, strictly speaking, I have no history of violins. 

History of the DC Universe (1986)
     The most scholarly and objective history still gets revised as we learn more. But you rely on the notion that it doesn't actually change in itself. (I say you. I reserve the right to believe this happens and that I know about it. The psychiatrists call it paranoid delusions, but I know they are just part of the plot)
      Abraham Lincoln might be discovered to have faked the whole story that he wrote the Gettysburg address on the back of an envelope on the train to Gettysburg, actually merely copying down a speech written by an advisor at the White House. But we are confident the Battle of Gettysburg would not go from being a genuine historical event, to now never having existed, and everything shifted in time and space to correspond to that. Of course we would be unaware of the change. In that conceptual reality what you think happened last week, would really have happened, but that might have "not always" (there are no words for this) have been true.
     And yet that's how it is in the DC Universe - along with many other comics worlds. So this 1986 history of the DCU would be historical fiction of the "what-if" variety if it could be read by someone living in the DCU. It can all change at any moment or the next "Yet more Final than Final Crisis", "We were Just Kidding about Final, Crisis Begins Again" or "Crisis Reborn-The Next Generation"

Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, The 01-03 (1993)
Adams, Douglas - Dirk Gently 1 - Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency.pdf
Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time o - Adams, Douglas.epub
Gaiman, Neil - Don't Panic - The Official Guide to the Hitchikers' Guide to the Galaxy.pdf
     The Guide teaches you that you want to be the "guy who really knows where his towel is", the towel being the most massively useful object in the universe. They call it a towel because they don't want you to feel bad about carrying a security blanket. It's ok. It's a really, really mind bogglingly big universe. It's scary really. If all you need is a "towel" you're doing well. Even without the total perspective vortex from book five of the trilogy, it doesn't pay to think too long about how big it is and how small and insignificant you are in the grand scheme of things.
     The ebooks I include because if you like the HGuide, You should try the Dirk Gently books. It sadder than an Arcturan Mega-Donkey who just missed seeing Eccentrica Gallumbits that Adams died before it could write more great books like these.

Hitman v1 1,000,000
Hitman v1 Annual (1997)
Hitman-Lobo-That Stupid Bastich 001
Hollow Grounds, The HC (2004) (Humanoids

Hollywood Funny Folks 27-60 after Funny Folks 26(1950-1954)
    See if you put "hollywood" in front of the name, the cartoon animals are so much better. Also glamerous.

Homage Studios Swimsuit Special 001 (04-1993)
    Homage is an imprint of WildStorm which was part of Image in 1993. Plus these guys new how to draw sexy pictures. I really should find an excuse to  include my collection of "Good Girl Art" books because sex sells and I like lots of people to download these torrents. Ego boot you know.

Hopalong Cassidy and the Five Men of Evil (AC Comics
Hopalong Cassidy v1 02-85(i) (Fawcett(1946)
Hopalong Cassidy v2 086-135 after Fawcett HC 85 (1954-1958)
     Hoppalong is not a manly name. I'm not a manly man at all, and I still think this is going too far. But I guess if you are a "Hero of the Old West", a "Real Hollywood Cowboy" you can go by any name you want.

Hoppy the Marvel Bunny 01-15(i) (Fawcett(1945-1947) just 01-03
	Superman has Krypto (depending on what version of the DCU is current), Supergirl has Streaky, Captain Marvel (now Shazam!) had Hoppy. So Mary Marvel, Captain Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr. (which is really crazy when you remember the man himself was really a kid) So what else? Lets have a Marvel Bunny.

Horrorist, The 01-02-Hellblazer (Vertigo(1995-1996)
Hot Wheels 01-05 (1970-1971)
    Not the only comic based on a toy. But one of the strangest since the cars are not people and had no back story or special nature whatsoever.

Hourman 01-25 (1999-2001)
Hourman 000 Wizard Special
      Well at least the version of him that existed 10 years ago. I like the Golden Age original

House of Secrets v2 Preview ctc (1996)
        The original houses were favorites of mine from childhood. The content changed in various ways over the years, featuring originally just supernatural stories but later various heroes as well such as "Dial H for Hero" and "I, Vampire" The villain Eclipso got his start here as well.
	I shy away from all modern comics buy especially the Vertigo (uggh!Â®Â©â„¢) versions of things I read when young, and will re-read as I get to them. I just don't want that kind of take on them. I like them the way they were.

House on the Borderland H.P. Lovecraft, The (Vertigo(2000)
     I keep thinking I should read some Lovecraft. But I never have.
