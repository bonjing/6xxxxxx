,Johnny_Rook,2012-04-27T10:03Z,"I have just cracked TriDef 3D 5.2. ;)
It's not perfect yet; the driver doesn't automatically load the 3D Display (it loads the standard anaglyph) but, once inside the game, all it takes is to set display output to SBS or AB in Control Panel [press 0 (NP) to access]. Works just fine. Maybe in a future release, I'll fix it. For now, that's what you get.

Yes I did! :-D

Cracked v5.2 a few days ago and works great! I've now fixed the bug I wrote about before and now, the trial application performs as being actualy registered with no compromises at all. It even works on Google! Tested successfully on Metro 2033 DX9, DX10 and DX11; on Alice Madness Returns DX9 and on Crysis DX10: every test was flawless!
Now, I've tested it under Windows 7 x64 only so, I'm not sure it works as well in other OS. Other thing I didn't test was OpenGL games like Rage 'cause I don't own a copy but, I'm working on it.

I have one condition only to send you my work: DO NOT DISTRIBUTE IT!

Do you agree? So, where do you want me to send you the crack? "

You are fantastic !!

ps : no false virus detected ? do you think it is ok with AMD3D output  ?

Thanks a lot ! "
,Johnny_Rook,2012-04-30T13:19Z,"No, there are no viruses! I promise you that!
I have made the patch with a tool called dUP2 and it uses a version of UPX to pack the executable so it stays small for distribution. Crackers and Cracking Teams use it all the time. If your anti-virus detects my patch as potential harmful software, it's 'cause of the packer UPX and therefore a false positive. I use the ESET NOD32 AV and it doesn't detect any threats with the patch.

I'll send the cracked version in 1 hour at most from know. Please, be patient!

I tested it with ""AMD HD3D Technology (HDMI 1.4a)"" and it works fine. The games are good but, the movies are lagging. It's the AMD drivers fault, though. It also works with nVIDIA Geforce GPUs as I've tested it using an ""old"" GTX260 card.


@everyone else wanting the patch

Look, there's a reason for me to take this distribution thing so damn serious. 
I have been part of a cracking team in the past, and I'm fully aware of the implications that distributing your software and make it extremelly known brings to the table. Not only we fall under FBI's radar as the progammers change the registry rotines of their applications in regular basis. For them is a simple conditional jump change; for me, is a complete new analysis of the code to see what's changed; it's very hard work.

So, to every one wanting this: BE WARNED. 
If I found this cracked application over the Internet (and be sure I'll know if it was made using my patch), there will be no more cracking from me for any potential update of TriDef.

Just one more thing: please, don't use your personal e-mail addresses here (the ones you use every day); just create a new account for this purpose; it's free.

Please, report back to me for any doubts, bugs or thanks you may want to address me by dropping a comment here."
,zerong,2012-04-30T13:50Z,"Thanks a lot  :) ! no soucy with me , your patch will only be on my pc.  I will never distribute it !!!!

I actually use it with stereoscopic player for 3d movies mkv and it look like a dream ! !!  

Only games arent presents for the moment for me . 

Do you think your patch is ok even if my 14 days trial périod is over ?

Fantastic work really !  "
,zerong,2012-04-30T14:20Z,"Juste receive the patch ! i will test it after office !!! :)  

Great job !!! 

I read nfo , it is writed ""activate tridef"" . So if it is already activated and 14 days trial périod over, do you think it will be ok ?

GO GO to test it  lol "
,Johnny_Rook,2012-04-30T14:20Z,"Just sent it! ;)

To be honest, I use the Trial just to the end. I only carcked the thing because I'm far from testing the application as extensivelly as I want to! I needed a month to do it and then buying the software myself - as I will eventually buy, if it delivers the expectations.
If you have the money to spare, please support the developers for their hard work. If you don't have the money, well, it's up to you. At least, you have a choice, now."
,zerong,2012-04-30T14:37Z,"I test it and if it is ok with my projector and futur TV , i ll buy it ! another thing i dont like with tridef is that licence is only for one PC !!!!! i have a desktop in a room and a notebook but i cant use these with only one licence  !!!! :(

,Johnny_Rook,2012-04-30T15:23Z,"Yeah! It really, really sucks! Imagine that you setup a HTPC on your living room tomorrow; you just can't use the software there and have to move arround your desktop PC any time you want to set a 3D movie session up for your family and/or friends or you have to buy a new $50 license. Moving PCs arround often is not good for the hardware at all and it makes no sense to me in having two licenses for the same user; it is the USER that experience the software and pays for it, not the PC where it is installed.

Anyways, now, you have a choice -- so I think lol

,Johnny_Rook,2012-05-02T06:19Z,"@pwnagetool

Woah! One year! If there's anyone who deserves this is you!

The Reset doesn't work because the damn TriDef application has a very trick rotine for checking the Local Time and, extremely important, the Boot time; it uses the system file ""bootsat.dat"" and crazy functions like FileTimeToSystemTime function to do it.
Other thing difficult to do was to get access to the libraries BEFORE the games loaded but, I got lucky and found a way.

As a fellow cracker, you know how feedback is precious to narrow down problems that may occur.
Either this thing works or not, please report back to me what OS you are using. 

I hope you guys forgive me for using you as ""BetaTesters"", but the interest is mutual. :-p"
,pwnagetool,2012-05-02T08:43Z,"@Johnny_Rook

@Gastly88

Thank you for the feedback!

I tried to replicate the problem you're experiencing and I just can't! Anaglyph works fine here. 
Please, be more specific about the problem you have. What are the video formats, what hardware you use (CPU + GPU) and what OS. 

I have a problem though: @ TriDef 3D Portal we have options to open a video file or a DVD. When I press ""DVD"", Media PLayer does give me an error and shuts down. However, it did same thing during Trial period so, I'm supposing it has to do with me haven't a DVD drive installed at my PC. I ceased using one since I buy downloadable games. Do you guys have any comments on this particular issue?"
,hooknej,2012-05-04T02:35Z,"@Johnny_Rook

First off, thanks for sending the crack! I'm running Win 7 64 bit and the patches open but aren't displaying correctly. A large part of the patch is being cut off and so I don't have the option to use it. I've tried running as an administrator, troubleshooting compatibility, rebooting, etc. All the tricks I know. Do you have any ideas on how I can fix this? Thanks in advance! I really appreciate your efforts!"
,Johnny_Rook,2012-05-04T11:51Z,"@hooknej

Sorry to hear that.
I think the problem may have to do with the Windows Theme you are using 'cause it seams the patch skin I used is not being applied correctly. Change the Theme to Windows Aero Default or to Windows Basic and report your findings back to me, please.
I have two options if it still doesn't work: to change patch skin for you or to send the patched files themselves; it's a ~20MB upload/download though."
,Sparks17,2012-05-04T15:48Z,"@Johnny_Rook

Thank you so much for your version, it works wonderfully well!!! Games are amazing in 3D, but I think my PC components are getting a bit old as I can't run all my games on the highest quality settings as it becomes quite laggy. Time to save up for a GTX 680 me thinks ;)

One problem I do have though is I can't run the TriDef Media Player. It crashes every time I try to run it. However, I can watch videos by going to the Tri Def portal and selecting the video reel, that's fine. So is the Media Player something else? Or is this a known problem?"
,Johnny_Rook,2012-05-04T17:37Z,"@Sparks17

Thank you for the feedback.

I'm glad you can play your 3D games and to watch your 3D moveis, on TriDef 3D Portal only, though. I think the problem you have has to do with your specific system, software and hardware configurations.
It's odd really, 'cause the Portal opens through the Media Player executable. It was ""easy"" to crack -- I wish the drivers were that easy --, all I did was to enable the hidden ""Free"" version by editing two bytes only. If you open it on ""windowed mode"", you'll see the name ""TriDef 3D Media Player (Free)"".

P.S. I own a HD5970 myself and it performs excellent @ 720p on my 42"" TV (HDMI is limited to 720p for 60Hz gaming; @1080p, it goes down to 24Hz that I don't quite like). But, I'm saving for a ""3D Ready"" 120Hz PC monitor and I'm thinking upgrading to future HD7990 or GTX690 just because of 3D gaming @1080p, 120Hz. Yeah, if you want 3D gaming with all eye candy @1080p or above, we must pay good money for it. It's not cheap alright."
,Johnny_Rook,2012-05-04T17:46Z,"@Sparks17

Forgot to say: Try the 3dtv ""Stereoscopic Player"" for 3D movies. It's much more complete than TriDef Media Player and has more features."

Thank you for your kind words.
As for iZ3D, I was looking around and came to conclusion that it's not worthy the trouble.
1. it uses a service to run which consumes more resources than really necessary; 
2 it loads itself up with every single DirectX application you have, even if you don't use the driver;
3. iZ3D it's reported by users as ""being DEAD"". Many have moved to competition;
4. Reviews @ mtbs3d.com shows consistent results on iZ3D being the most problematic, bugged and malfunctioning of all the offers on the market. 

Even with this, I gave the application itself a look. The programmers have protected their software with a commercial packer called PC Guard. It was not very smart because PC Guard is ""easy"" to crack. The problem with iZ3D is that cracking the thing is too time consuming. Not only you have to unpack every single ""Output"" (which are a lot of DLLs), as next, you have to crack every single Output ""again"". As this software isn't the best we have available and as I already gave you a real option, I think it's not worthy. If iZ3D solves it's issues and if I have the time, maybe, just maybe, I will crack it. For the time being, No.

@hooknej
Not worthy the trouble to fix it ""just"" for you. Files themselves were already sent. Enjoy!"

Thank you for being so sympathetic.
The patch is very easy to apply. The instructions are right there. You should also read the iNFO file for detailed information.
If you are a gamer, may I suggest you to back your games' settings down a bit? In 3D the GPU is rendering like two games at once, and a HD6700 Series GPU will struggle @ 1080p.

Ps. I have tried 3dtv Stereoscopic Player 1.8.1 but it runs very slow.:( And Arcsoft TotalMedia Theatre 5 and Powerdvd 12 does not feel right in 3D, so i stopped using them.

It's done! ;-)

@ K-Launcen
The only thing I could suggest is that you play with Stereoscopic Player's primary ""Viewing Method""settings until you get the most comfortable to you. Updating the GeForce drivers is not a bad idea as well.
It's odd because the ""lag"" was an AMD Stereo Driver bug. It's fixed now.

Yeah, The GTX580 is a good card for 3D gaming and you'll not need to compromise any ""eye candy"" except for AA. At TriDef froum is recommended to turn AA completely off for gaming @1080p"

I read your posts from last year... Dude, saving just $5 a month and by now, you would have enough money aside to by the legit application! lol
TriDef 3D is reported not working properly within Windows 8 environment. The Steam launcher doesn't work and only a few non-Steam games do run in 3D. TriDef developers are addressing this issue and will release an update at some stage. Refer to TriDef 3D forums for details.
Nevertheless, I sent the patch to you. Good luck."

I'm glad it worked.
As far as DVDs are concerned, I think it is a TriDef's bug. I posted about the issue before. here, on Win7 x64, the Media Player crashes when it tries to run a DVD with or without patching. I assumed it was because me haven't a DVD drive installed but, since you experience same problem, it sounds the bug resides deep inside the code itself. Anyways, I prefer using Stereoscopic Player instead."

In my Philips 42"" HDTV, there are games where 3D is detected automatically but other games need manual 3D setting on TV. On the other hand, my ASUS 27"" PC monitor always detects TriDef 3D displays. So, it all depends on what Game/Tridef/Monitor/TV configuration you use. Refer to TriDef forums for help."

Make sure you install TriDef 3D version 5.2 (is the latest version downloadable from TriDef 3D's homepage); the patches will not work with other versions of the software. 
If you had installed the version 5.2 already, and it now says it's expired, it means it was activated more than 15 days ago. All you need to do is to apply the patches and you're done."

,soumulher,2012-05-18T17:17Z,"Good morning face. I saw that you seem to know a patch to reset the TriDef 5.2.
I've killed myself trying to reset and until now nothing.

I had formerly TriDef 4.0.2 installed. After it expired and got it.
After a time formatted the PC from scratch and recalled that program.

But I do not know how to speak my version 5.2 test period is over.
It is impossible to know the software I had installed the TriDef 3D before.
It is as if a person died, was born again and remember what it was.

The only plausible explanation I find for this is that when the TriDef was first installed, he did a fucking record in the official website of TriDef and there when I try this version he knows my period espirou query why the old record.

So crack a real help in the executable. I tried to contact the master, Skidrow but your site does not work very well. If you know it, please tell him that help us.

I used the google translator because I am Brazilian.

If you know something tell me, and thank you.

Eu não vou entrar em pormenores sobre as rotinas de código que os programadores de TriDef usam para gerar as chaves de registo da aplicação mas, posso adiantar que tens razão quando dizes que a informação está guardada nos servidores da TriDef. A única forma de ""enganar"" o servidor para não reconhecer o teu PC é mudando algum do hardware como por exemplo, o disco rígido.
A Team Skidrow está mais vocacionada para cracking de jogos. Se quiseres pedir um crack para um programa, pede-o à SnD TeaM da qual eu próprio fiz parte, à team ICU ou à TSRh TeaM, só para mencionar algumas das melhores equipas de cracking.
Quanto ao crack do TriDef, eu envio-to com todo o gosto assim que concordares com a minha única condição que é pagares 15€... ('tou a brincar).

Hi Johnny,
First of all my salute to you for the awfully nice job you have done and taking out the time to personally mail the crack to everyone who asked for it. Not a very easy thing to do I'd say.
I would just like to add a review after using the patch. 
1. The player can handle .avi files very well.
2. However the player crashes while trying to play HSBS avi files. 
3. It also crashes when trying to play .mp4 files.
4. It can't handle mkv formats.

I am also using power dvd 12. It can handle most of these formats but the  downside is that it's awfully big and takes up a lot of system resource and hangs a bit too much.

What I love about the Tridef player is that it gives a better depth than the rest of the 3d players and it doesn't hog the system.
My system is a little old though. It's a dell inspiron 1420. I have installed all the necessary codecs required to play the files.
I am wondering why the player crashes whnever I tried playing these formats..."
,Johnny_Rook,2012-05-19T01:52Z,"@digihack
First of, thank for your kind words.

TriDef Media Player isn't the best application out there for the job. TriDef is good for games -- very good sometimes -- but, that's about it; as far as video playback is concerned, there are too many issues with the software, mostly compatibility problems like the ones you're experiencing. 
So, I suggest you to use Stereoscopic Player instead. It supports every media formats I know of; as long as you have the codecs installed, it works for 3D very much like the VLC or Media Player Classic work for 2D; you can choose from the audio channels available in the movie; you can load external subtitles; etc. There's a bunch of really helpful features."

If TriDef developers don't know their application was cracked, they have no reasons to change the code's activation & registration routines so, the method I use will most probably work on new Betas and even on new final releases. However, the patches I'll send you work for version 5.2 only 'cause CRC & file size checkings were implemented.

@alkwathor
Are you a cracker? Or have you any knowledge on Assembly language and PE file format? How were you trying to crack the application? What were the problems you ran into?"

,Johnny_Rook,2012-05-26T22:39Z,"@alkwathor
TriDef Media Player registration routine is really ""easy"" to bypass. You better start with it. 
Then, move to Ignition 'cause it adds a ""valid license id"" check to the mix and finally, go for the drivers themselves 'cause they also check the license and the time passed since first activation.
You need to crack five files for this to work properly but, it's only a few bytes patch per file OR if you have the time and the expertise, there are more ""professional"" methods to do it.
Please, tell me what's that jump's address and I 'll see if you are on the right track or if you need to change your approach."

Are you asking me?? I can't give you any activation code. You would not be able to use it.
TriDef codes are personal and can only be used by the PC where the code was first activated. Is just like the serials for online multiplayer gaming: two different accounts can't share same code."

Hey johnny, your patch worked, but im dealing with one problem that's restricting me from using it. 

The problem is in the configuration for my display. The process brings me to Tridef Control Panel, but when it opens it completely fails, a process and application is opened, but opens minimized it appears, and when i click to maximize ect... it simply closes. Running as admin doesnt change the problem either. Any suggestions, I am using a Benq W710ST projector. Please HALP!"
,Johnny_Rook,2012-06-01T02:37Z,"@carnifex92
Sorry to hear that but, I feel I can't help you 'cause I don'tt use BenQ projectors -- nor any kind of projectors for that matter. I use monitors and TVs only so, I can't replicate your problem. I'm almost sure it's an TriDef application issue. 
You know, my patch was inside registration routines and serial checking only; I did not mess-up with driver itself.
Did you check if the application worked 100% in Trial, without patch?  I suggest you to go to DDD TriDef 3D forums and get some help."

iam really glad you were able to crack it. I was trying to do the same about a year but finally gave up after trashing my windows with softice. Had to format and reinstall everything. I can fully understand the hard work you have put in.

,Johnny_Rook,2012-06-01T22:56Z,"@lndi
As long as you have the software v5.2 installed, I'm pretty sure the patch will work with your registration Trial serial. Just apply the patches and you're done.

@antrim741
Feel free to analyze the patching results so you can crack it yourself next time. If the code registration routines don't change in next releases, it will be a very simple ""Search & Replace"" patterns patching procedure to do.
BTW, don't use SoftIce for this; SoftIce is used for more ""hard-cracking"", Ring0, ""virtual machines"" stuff. Ring3 Olly Debugger (OllyDbg) would be just fine. Try it."
