Atomic, the Scandinavian five-piece supergroup, play a short UK tour with saxist
Ken Vandermark's band from 16 September â€“ and if the music is anything like this
live double album, they will be must-see performances. Atomic take improv to the
outer reaches, but then pull it back with infectious swing clamour, hints of
Latin jazz or Ornette Coleman, or the Iberian shimmer of the Liberation Music
Orchestra with the late Don Cherry's trumpet bubbling through it. Driven by Paal
Nilssen-Love, a powerful free-jazz drummer, the band move from trumpeter Magnus
Broo's 1970s Miles Davis fierceness, through HÃ¥vard Wiik's cool postbop piano
solos, or flat-out free-swing with saxist Fredrik Ljungkvist playing blurty
clarinet. There are quirky minimal themes that sound like piano-tuning, blustery
free-Latin melodies, and squeaky improv that turns into circus band stomping and
frantic thrashing on the finale's Two Boxes. It's exhaustingly exhilarating, or
exhilaratingly exhausting.
