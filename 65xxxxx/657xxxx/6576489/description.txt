Heya!

I know I usually upload Hentai, but besides liking to fap, I am also a massive supporter of anti-copyright and freedom in all aspects.

This is a video about dead-drops. Dead drops are completely anonymous points where people can upload and download information. They are usually in usb flashdisks.

The point? The point can be nothing. It can also be everything. It in itself is proving that law, corporations and governments, can not stop us from being who we are. We will always find a way.

These dead drops allow us to share things with others however we please, without people tracking our internet and suing us.

Watch the video and be sure to send it around, because this online war is escalating, and awareness is what will win it on either side.

Enjoy!
