The entire philosophy supposes that all your karma determines your future reincarnation level on the Earth alone. Shouldn't the entire universe and possibly all of the infinite number of universes be figured into the karmic formula? My thinking is that the number of universes is infinite, therefore everything is, was and shall be forever. Nothing you can do that can't be done. Nothing you can sing that can't be sung. Everything has already, is now, and will be done forever. My justification for this theory is as follows. How can I imagine something greater than all reality? I am part of existence. How could I possibly imagine a greater version of reality than even God could create? I can't. I am part of all creation. If my theory is correct, universes have been created by big bangs, by infinite numbers of Gods and by random spontaneous existence. Every universe, every dimension, every thought ever thought, every single celled organism, every living planet, every God, are all part of the infinite realities known as existence. So, in theory, everything is and must be possible. This is not hard to imaging since just a short while ago magnetism and electricity wasn't known to exist. Surely there must be an infinite number of other unknown forces that would dwarf the age of electricity. The other 90 percent of my brain must contain buried treasures."
,ofr5555,2011-07-30T04:27Z,"I just watched this video. It is worded to ridicule karma and reincarnation as a silly superstition, stating that only Allah deals with your souls after death. This video also fails to take into consideration the rest of reality. It deals with a purely earthbound existence. Stating that death is final for the body but the souls is dealt with by Allah. First, the laws of thermodynamics state that mass/energy, which are interchangeable, cannot be created or destroyed. Your life force does in fact still exist after your body stops breathing. The unit particles of life that were once you likely, do in fact leech back into the garden called the Earth and are absorbed by other living organisms. not your typical reincarnation story. Who knows, perhaps your life energies are added to the collective consciousness of the Earth and it does in fact decide which path your next life takes. Myself, I believe everything is possible and also must be possible. Unless of course, creation was flawed."
,EdgarS789,2011-08-07T13:13Z,"I agree with ofr5555 in that this is just religious propaganda. However, his science is incorrect. Mass and energy cannot be created or destroyed, but ""you"" are the information encoded in your brain, and that can be easily destroyed.

There is some evidence that people sometimes do remembr past lives. Google ""Bridey Murphy."" I'm not sure this is credible but it has more authority than quoting the Koran."
