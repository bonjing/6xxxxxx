,jklolzz441,2011-09-08T01:38Z,"Hi, I found it would be better to post to a newer one of yours so you see it and respond but this is for your Premiere Pro CS4. I am having some issues with this I read the instructions and I feel stupid when you say install premiere pro I try to go to the Premiere pro install> Adobe Premiere Pro CS4> Setup and it says when I try to run it ""Setup has encountered an error and cannot continue. Contact Adobe customer support for assistance."" PLEASE help I don't know if i'm doing something wrong or what."

I am wondering if you can us get the Portrait Professional 10 at http://www.portraitprofessional.com/index.php. 
It is the best and the fastest portrait image editing program in the world. I've tested the trial version it is amazing. 

Thank you so much for your help in advance.

,stonedkia,2012-05-08T00:17Z,Not a beginner. Was just concerned as ive used his stuff in the past and never had the AV bitch at me. Also looking at a few of his other torrents I dont see anyone complaining about his other newer releases so it was possible that this one somehow got infected.
