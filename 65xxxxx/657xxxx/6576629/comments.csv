,davegurn101,2011-09-11T18:27Z,"Another great torrent! Thanks ChattChitto...

Ive done a +1 for this torrent.

For anyone having the same problem i had to start with, which is the serial not working! Its because folder lock is using the internet to find out that the serials have already been used by somebody else.

You have to find out how to block specific applications from accessing the internet with whatever firewall you are using and block folder lock from accessing the internet! I have and now its working fine with one of the provided serials.

Hint: if you cant see folder lock in the list of applications to block on your firewall. Use one of the serials and then try locking a folder, then click close and protect and then finally exit folder lock completely. Then reopen folder lock and if it says your serial is already in use then it has accessed the internet to find this out and should now show up as an application that uses the internet on your firewall."
,oglecowboy,2011-09-12T12:19Z,Yes its a duplicate comment entry--CC I know this is probably a false positive but I am unable to open this one due to norton telling me that it contains WS.Reputation.1 what ever that is can't find much on the net. Is there a work around on this? 
,oglecowboy,2011-09-12T12:26Z,CC-forget about the other comment.  I zipped it before opening it and after norton deleted the original i unzipped it and ran it with no norton interference.  Freaky
