What OS are you using?"
,jacky7028,2011-08-09T02:00Z,"Thank you, It is workable. ;-))"
,TMAR81,2011-08-11T18:37Z,This is freezing my PC i use W7 64bits. Do i need to install that Microsoft hotfix?

Read this: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976038"
,TMAR81,2011-08-12T23:16Z,I tried that but the hotfix says it can't be installed on this OS!? I do have a 64bits W7 and i did downloaded the x64 version. It seams i will have to wait till theres some 64 bits version of the Unity 3.4 torrent. :( Thanks for the help.

Perhaps going back to Unity 3.2. It works for both x86 and x64 versions:

,bob5587,2011-09-04T06:07Z,Don't listen to the idiot above me license worked fine
,NuclearICE,2011-09-06T05:03Z,"Works great, even though I barely know what I'm doing, and I'm gonna have to disconnect my internet every time I use it"
,themusicdork,2011-09-06T07:06Z,Is there any way to just patch the hosts file for this =) until then the pro's of keeping my default 3.4 installation don't outweigh the hassle of cracking it.

I don't really think that kind of comment is necessary... He was not claiming it was a fake or up-loaders fault... Simply stating he could not get it working and it may have to do with his set-up... I am sure you are a genius so maybe instead of ""Idiot"" you could say ""Did you and try this"" or in general seek to help him instead of bashing.

,Showatt,2011-10-06T19:15Z,is this pro?
