,Smuggles,2011-07-31T10:43Z,thank you :)
,balanced,2011-08-06T01:58Z,electricmaster there's nothing to thank you for.  That link is to some web page that's trying to con people into installing some proprietary client for reasons which I'm sure are more beneficial to the publishers of the client and/or site than the people who want to download.  Not only that but even if I WAS a fool I'm using Linux and a .EXE doesn't do anything for me.  Oh wait a minute - if I WAS a fool I'd be running Windows wouldn't I?
