,frddrg,2011-09-01T06:58Z,"The author of this great comic, Brandon Graham, is a super nice guy. He even went so far as to post this torrent on his own personal Twitter account:

@royalboiler I'm pro comics pirating, here's King city. http://t.co/17LSPTM

So if you enjoy this comic, please, buy the actual books and prove that """"piracy"""" is not evil."
