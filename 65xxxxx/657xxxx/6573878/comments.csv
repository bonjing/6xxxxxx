,pourable,2011-08-11T01:59Z,"When you can snatch the pebble from my hand, it will be time for you to leave. 

Your tread must be light and short, as though your path were upon rice paper.

It is said a Shaolin Priest can walk through walls, looked for; cannot be seen.

Listened for; cannot be heard.

Touched; cannot be felt.

This rice paper is the test.  Fragile as the wings of the Dragon Fly.  Clinging as the cocoon of the silk worm.

When you can walk its length and leave no trace you will have learned."
