Alas, I'm not here to comment the torrent - excuse me. Wanted instead to comment on your post in a news article that's barred from comments by now, lostinlodos.
Those claims about 3D, I'm inclined to believe in you, though I am still rather surprised that I'd not heard of it before. And if it's a troll, it's the by far the most detailed, elaborate and plausible one I've ever seen.
My posse and I never were much inclined to 3D cinema sessions but only because we're bullshitted into paying extra for the 3D, as if that really comes at a cost to them that we need pay â‚¬2 more of what would otherwise be a â‚¬5 ticket. But alas, business... so rich, yet so widely dumb. People are just too complacent and stupid themselves to give them trouble. What they oughta be doing is, I suppose, upping to 6 or 7â‚¬ a session within a movie's week of release, for instance, taking it down to the regular 5â‚¬ after that week and then shaving a â‚¬ off in each of 2 following weeks to a minimum of 3â‚¬ until the movie's taken down. Given that sessions are largely empty after the first couple of weeks, I think it'd work great for both service provider and client. Alas, only rarely do those greedy imbeciles actually turn out to be savvy.

But I digress, hugely, pardon. Point being, unconfirmed as your claims are to me, yet, I already feel less inclined to suck it up and let them rob me just so I really watch that one special flick that I'm longing to watch loudly on a big screen. A rare thing, to be sure, but one such occasion will be when the new Jurassic Park is out, provided it doesn't get too humbling reviews. I suppose I was prepared to be robbed by the 3D scheme as to not miss it, but now I'm thinking differently.
Thanks for the info, your taking the time to share it with this broad community in general shows your civility and such shares are a boon to humanity, not just the torrents on here."
