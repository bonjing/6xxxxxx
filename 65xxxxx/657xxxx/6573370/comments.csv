,10christian10,2011-08-25T20:25Z,"Dude i would rather live following the name of Jesus, the son of God [the god who created everything] than to live without it, even if it was all a fairy tale story, it be better to live a life in believe of that, rather than live one without any hope, or real love, and death. live dying to earthly things and with worries of this world, naw, im passed that, i already went through it all, and now i know how real it is! we are all being called closer to our savior he's worthy!
