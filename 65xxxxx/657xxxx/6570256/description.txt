Omega is one of the most successful Hungarian rock bands.
Formed in Budapest in September, 1962 by the winds player LÃ¡szlÃ³ BenkÅ‘ on organ and JÃ¡nos KÃ³bor as a singer and rhythm guitarist,
they initially performed covers of British and American rock songs, frequently changing the lineup of members.
In 1967 TamÃ¡s MihÃ¡ly came on bass, GÃ¡bor Presser joined on keyboards and began writing original music for the band,
contributing to the release of three LPs before leaving the band with JÃ³zsef Laux, a drummer from 1962, to form Locomotiv GT in spring 1971.
These first albums were heavily influenced by the music of The Beatles and psychedelic rock,
but they also looked forward to the band's future more hard rock, then progressive and space-rock styles.
Omega has achieved great international success through releases in multiple languages, and tours in England and Germany in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s.
Their 1969 song "GyÃ¶ngyhajÃº lÃ¡ny" became an international hit, and was later covered by Griva on a 1987 self-titled album, with the title "Devojka biserne kose",
and by Scorpions on a 1995 live release, with new lyrics and the title "White Dove"
The Hungarian title officially was translated as "Pearls In Her Hair".
