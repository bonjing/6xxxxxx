Is there a reason?"
,logolepsic,2011-08-11T01:35Z,"The reason it is not 90 minutes, is probably because this is the ""John Pinette: Still Hungry"" Comedy Central special from Friday, July 29th, without the DVD extras. The DVD that came out on August 2nd, contains the following extras: Tour of Chicago, Looking For John Pinette, Worst Snowstorm in 1,000 Years, In the Make-Up Chair, Fans, Photoshoot, Number 1 Fan. Again, this torrent is just the show without the extras."

While I agree that this is the Comedy Central broadcast version, it is by no means to full concert.

Although I havent seen the the DVD, I suspect that the DVD probably has 13 minutes of bonus footage, over and above the 77 minute concert... but either way, this is not the full concert.... short by about 25 minutes."
