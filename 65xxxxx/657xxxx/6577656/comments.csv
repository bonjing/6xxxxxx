Why do we need mkv when all the others are fine
& don't need codecs & players to play the movie.
also stop complaining about uploads. Give a simple
A & V. These guys should all be applauded for any upload no matter the guality. "

I see your point to some extent, but that is more applicable 2 or 3 years ago, not now.  It isn't like MKV is some BRAND NEW format, (actually a container). We as a people are nearing the last half of 2011, .MKV is common place now. It appears that your living in the past. It is this comment I cut and pasted below that make no sense to me (and maybe others). Here is part of your comment:

""Why do we need mkv when all the others are fine & don't need codecs & players to play the movie""

Don't need codecs or players?? How would you watch ANY movie without some kind of media player????

That is a ridiculous statement. If you don't want to deal with codices, then how do play anything??? You do understand that Xvid, Divx, .mp4, .MPEG, .flv, are types of formats and are codecs as well. There and many many others that I won't even try to name. EVERY media player I can think of has and NEEDS some kind or some number of codecs, weather they were installed later or were included as part of the media player application (for ex. QUICKTIME comes with many already as part of the app). I don't see how you are going to get around watching a .avi movie file (for example) without a media player???

Go read his comment again. He/She (no insult intended, I can't tell from a user name what sex someone is)

LASTLY, it so super simple to use a codec. If you install it into the right folder, you shouldn't ever have to mess with it again. The media player, say QUICKTIME, once you have added PARIAN for example, that is that, you never have to mess with it again.

There are always going to be new and better video formats and techniques coming out, usually the technology gets out dated every 6 to 8 months. I'd get used to codex and such unless your going to buy a new computer every year from now till the end of your life. I certainly was happy to add a codec to an existing app to keep it currant then having to upgrade the entire system or having to buy a new media player. THNAK the LORD there are free, and VERY VERY good media players like VLC available for us poor folk. 
Good luck with that line of thinking, hope it works out for ya."
