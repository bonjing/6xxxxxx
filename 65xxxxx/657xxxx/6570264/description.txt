Description:	The Italian metal band Rhapsody of Fire is definitely one of the most influential acts of the 90â€™s. With their mixture of melodic metal and elements of classical music influenced by the cinema soundtracks, the Italians created a complete new genre: The Symphonic Metal.

Guitarist Luca Turilli and keyboarder Alex Staropoli started in 1993 under the name of Thundercross, influenced by acts like Helloween, Blind Guardian, Cacophony, Yngwie Malmsteen and Crinsom Glory. With their first demo â€œLand Of Immortalsâ€ the young guys from Trieste were signed by the new label LMP Records, which was founded by the former Helloween manager Limb Schnoor who effectively established the band. The new singer Fabio Lione completed the band and just before the production of the debut they renamed the group in Rhapsody. â€œLegendary Talesâ€ with its pompous choirs and an orchestra was released in 1997. The lyrical content was based on the â€œEmerald Sword Sagaâ€, an epic fantasy tale written by Luca Turilli.

In 2006 Rhapsody was forced to rename into Rhapsody of Fire because of a copyright complaint of a same-titled US band. The following extensive world tour was a great success and the DVD â€œVisions From The Enchanted Landsâ€, released in 2007, provides into it.
