Documentary revealing what made Motown special in Britain through the lens of two decisive
moments in 1965 - the Motown Revue UK tour and the Sounds of Motown Ready Steady Go!
television special.

Arriving in London in March 1965, the Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas, Smokey
Robinson and Stevie Wonder were bussed across Britain on a tough but crucial tour.

The television special, recorded during the tour, kicked open the door, thrusting Motowns
slick routines and magical music into front rooms across the nation.
