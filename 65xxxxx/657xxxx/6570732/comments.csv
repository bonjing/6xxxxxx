BUT!

...why do you split it into 6 x parts ???? it makes no sense whatsoever! Why not just upload it as one .flv file ? The file size will be exactly the same.... it's really annoying when you're at a good point in the show and it CUTS OFF and you have to open up the next part!

Thanks... but PLEASE take this advice for next time!"
,dmizz24,2011-07-31T11:00Z,"as it is in 6 parts, you can give downloading priority to first part to watch it before the whole torrent is downloaded."
,Diazafan,2011-08-04T15:27Z,"((~REQUEST~))
NEXT TIME!
Make 2 uploads:
....you make a full .flv movie in one torrent and the 6 x parts in another...
..........Please !!!! 
;))"

heres the suggestion, add all the files on the playlist of your player in right sequence you will not get any problem after that,,
thanks for your opinion..  "
