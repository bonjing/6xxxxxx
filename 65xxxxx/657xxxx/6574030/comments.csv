,DrTheFunk,2011-08-03T04:51Z,The key generator does work.  Just type in your own name instead of the one it gives you

,Xtra-x,2011-12-24T21:53Z,"Worked flawlessly! 

Simple installation: 
Extract both .rar's 
Run SuperDuper -> Go to File -> Register
Run Keygen -> Type in a name -> Generate
Double click on the serial and paste into SD with the name.
Done.

If this product helps you as it did me, do what I did, buy it. It's great to first test out the whole product."
