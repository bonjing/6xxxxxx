         Tom and Hal are forced to deal with an unstable Weaver        
         while out on a dangerous reconnaissance mission; Pope tips    
         the odds in their favor when he finishes assembling a new     
         weapon; Anne is shocked after completing an autopsy on a

         Proper notes: P0W4failure's leet new packing tool somehow     
         created an AVI index where the keyframe references don't      
         actually point to keyframes, causing the video to have a      
         few seconds of frozen or glitchy playback if you seek in      
          the file.
