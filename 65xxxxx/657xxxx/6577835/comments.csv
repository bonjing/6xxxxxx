guy,i repeat again and again and i'm tired to repeat you the same thing :
don't try to download my torrents with your version :
BitTorrent 7.2.1
it is fully incompatible between you and i
you will never be able to download anything with this version,right ? Do you understand ?
You waste your time and freeze most of my seeds.
I cannot correctly seed in super seed mod this new torrent by your fault  !!!
certain peers cannot connecting as well by your fault again and again !
stop insisting so much then !
are you stupid or what ?
use utorrent 2.2.1 max or older version of bitComet,BitTorrent,Vuze,Azureus,ect...
your personal ip is incompatible with mine !
or you follow my tips or i will be forced to definitively ban your ip !
i cannot accepting that you continue to ruin most of my seeds,right ?
So please,for the last time : follow my tips
or switch to a  linux computer,right ?
your ip is logged and i know your external port as well as torrent client and even your isp !
all my torrents are monitoring 7 days/7 and
24 hours/24.
so stop to play this stupid game with me and be nice or should i say cooperative so !
would you like i ban you ?
No ? So act with intelligence and be cooperative !
and don't forget that :
i still keep an eye on you !
regards"

[T],Tyr3ll,2011-08-14T00:44Z,"@ us peer :
ip logged : 75.95.149.xx
BitComet 0.1.1.7 port :17557
dude,could you please switch to another torrent client ?
You are not able to down and up something anymore.You are probably in serious conflict with a japanese peer on BitComet 1.28...
You are still buggy and your client duplicate multi-connection at the same time since more than 5 days now.
Please,review your connection and settings option.You completely waste your time by insisting like that and unfortunately i well fear you will get nothing at all so.
Do act for something else so.
Thx by advance
