The New York Four [Vertigo]

By: Brian Wood, Ryan Kelly

As in Local and DMZ, indie superstar Wood shows great skill in writing 
extremely appealing and occasionally infuriating female leads. All four 
of the college freshmen at the center of this tale are well realized, 
but its shy, sheltered Riley who is the focus of this girlcentric 
offering. Rileys life is packed with drama as she meets up with her 
estranged older sister and struggles to balance school, family, and a 
mysterious new boyfriendâ€”whom she has never met but texts to the point 
of obsession. Kellys art, filled with expressive, idiosyncratic faces 
and figures, matches Woodâ€™s indie street cred with gritty depictions of 
the Lower East Side. He captures actual New York locations with nearly 
photographic accuracy, matching Woods affection for the city, itself 
made obvious by the passages of hipster, travel-guide stuff packed into 
the story. Despite a disturbingly ambiguous ending, this graphic novel 
will delight readers on the cusp of discovering their own independence.
