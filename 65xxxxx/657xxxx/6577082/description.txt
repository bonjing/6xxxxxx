Schizophrenic tramp performs outrageous acts in the streets of Salvador, and in the end tries to fulfill his ultimate dream: to fly over the city, as a superhero would.

If Friedrich Nietzsche was to become a movie maker, this is the movie he would have shot. Pasolini, Fellini, BuÃ±uel, Glauber Rocha and the Brazilian tradition of experimental Super 8 films are here condensed in a thrilling series of radically imaginative sequences describing reality as experienced by a schizophrenic bump whose trajectory runs through exposing his body, sexuality, poetry and imaginary in the streets of Salvador, in the years just after the end of military dictatorship in Brazil. A monumental and highly poetical chronicle of the body in the context of culture, power and politics in a general way.
