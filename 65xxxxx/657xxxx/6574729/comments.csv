[1 of 10 stars ] nSurreal film
19 September 2005 | by manfredvon2001 (Mexico)

I do not know how in the world I ever saw this movie. It is one of those films that is so terrible that it is funny. This is an exceptional demonstration of the worst Mexican films ever, classified as ""ficheras"" genre, which shows sexual content, and low-class sexual related jokes, along with low-quality acting.

The film has everything a movie should have! - violence, action, sex, comedy, and, yes, believe it or not, martial arts performed by Mexicans. Apparently the movie did not have any microphones, so the voices were added later, and this is the funniest part; it sounds worse than a Chinese film dubbing.

This film is obviously intended for Mexico's lowest social and educated class. It is a shame anybody tries to make money out of trash like this. If you are ever surfing your cable at 3:00 in the morning and find this movie, watch it only to make fun of it later on; it has absolutely no purpose whatsoever.
