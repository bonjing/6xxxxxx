Ubehage's EasyCopy v1.21
------------------------

Just a little update, to fix a few errors.

Fixes in this release:
- Switching between open jobs, or deleting a job, while update is in progress would cause EasyCopy to crash. This is fixed.

- Folder-sizes were not accurate on folders containing large files (>2GB). This is fixed.
