The Nightingaleâ€™s Prayer is a compelling melodrama, an important example of Egyptian cinema at the height of its popularity not only in Egypt, but also in nearby Arab countries. The story is of two young women and their mother who are banished from their idyllic, isolated village by an uncle who is shamed by his brotherâ€™s adulterous behavior. In the city, they are dispersed to various houses as servants, and one of the sisters is seduced by her bachelor employer. Fleeing to the "safe haven" offered by their uncle, they instead witness him murder the girl. Anma, left alone with her mother, blames her for trusting the uncle, and flees back to the city on her own. There, she vows revenge on the bachelor and maneuvers to work in his house. Unable to follow through with her plan to poison him, she instead seeks to torture him by making him fall in love with her, managing at the same time to instill in him a new compassion for others. This particular course of events is handled at length and with great subtlety and respect for the charactersâ€™ intelligence. Even as their love for one another becomes clear, Anma cannot forget the injustice done her sister and her masterâ€™s part in it.
