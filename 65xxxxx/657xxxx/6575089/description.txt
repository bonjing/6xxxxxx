History Ch Jurassic Fight Club Season One For over a century, historians and scientists have been piecing together a history of the prehistoric world. Jurassic Fight Club Season One! examines the ultimate fighters of this unique period - gigantic beasts that stalked the earth millions of years ago. Some of these dinosaurs were larger than seven-story buildings, and hunted their prey with strategy and cunning, transforming the prehistoric world into a battlefield. The temperature, terrain, and innate sense of the opponent's weaknesses and strengths all played a role in how each dinosaur planned his attack. Today, paleontologists are uncovering these fighting grounds and are gaining startling new insight into how maneuverability, team coordination, and striking at the exact moment meant survival. Blow by blow, each episode will dissect these battles, revealing a predatory world far more calculated - and complex - than we originally thought.
Jurassic Fight Club Season One contains 12 acclaimed documentaries on 4 DVDs

1)  Cannibal Dinosaur 
Majungatholus vs Majungatholus
Majungatholus versus Majungatholus. Scientists uncover the first authentic case of dinosaur cannibalism. Paleontologists look deep into the brain cavity to give science new insight into their behavior, then by studying the behaviors of modern animals, experts recreate a scenario of what occurred when a male Majungatholus went in search of a mate, but found a non-receptive female who was more interested in protecting her young, than mating.

2)  Gang Killers 
Deinonychus vs Tenontosaurus
The bird-like predator Deinonychus takes on the large plant-eating dinosaur called Tenontosaurus. Scientists give a never before seen look into how these animals moved, fought and behaved and recreate what happened when a pack of deadly raptors took on an adversary more than twice their own size.

3)  T Rex Hunter 
Tyrannosaurus Rex vs Nanotyrannus
Tyrannosaurus Rex was the most feared predator on earth, but to one particular dinosaur, he was prey. A discovery in Montana reveals the broken and fractured bones of a juvenile T-Rex, and the teeth of its attacker. Experts measuring the size and shape of the teeth are able to identify the attacker as Nanotyrannus. As more bones emerged, paleontologists get an unprecedented look into 65 million year old battle and help answer questions about the origin of Nanotyrannus, the "Tiny Tyrant".

4)  Deep Sea Killers 
Megalodon vs Brygmophyseter
Megalodon, a 50 foot long cousin of the modern Great White Shark battles Brygmophyseter, the "biting sperm whale", an enormous creature equipped with 44 teeth that equaled those of a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

5)  Bloodiest Battle 
Allosaurus vs Ceratosaurus
Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus go at each other at a prehistoric watering hole that became the scene of one of the bloodiest battles in paleo- history. Scientists uncover more than 15,000 bones and discover where multiple dinosaur species fought to the death under the intense heat of a Jurassic drought.

6)  Hunter Becomes Hunted 
Allosaurus vs Ceratosaurus
Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus face off. Scientists reconstruct a battle that took place between the two predators, in a fight for dominance when the hunter becomes the hunted.

7)  Ice Age Monsters 
Mega-Lion vs Short-Faced Bear
An Arctodus and American Lion fight over a kill made by the lion. The fight is not only for food, but to eliminate competition for already scarce resources, due to warming climate conditions. The Arctodus rears to scare off the lion, only to be knocked down. The lion locks its jaws on its enemy's back as the bear gets to its feet, but the Arctodus' fur and fat are too thick for the lion to cause enough damage. After shaking off the feline, the Arctodus retaliates by smashing its paw into the lion's skull then biting its underbelly, disabling the lion temporarily. The Arctodus starts to feed on the bison carcass, but the lion recovers and launches a surprise attack. It attempts to bite the windpipe of the Arctodus, but the bear's powerful paws hold off the lion and throw it away. After a few more rounds of battle, the lion finally manages to lock its jaws on the throat. However, the Arctodus rears up before the American Lion can kill it and throws the lion into the Natural Trap Cave (in Wyoming), where it dies from the fall.

8)  Raptors Last Stand 
Gastonia vs Utahraptor
Gastonia, covered in armor and spikes and built like a prehistoric tank, challenges the largest member of the raptor family ever discovered - Utahraptor. Using the latest in dinosaur technology and painstaking reconstructions of skeletal designs, experts are able to reconstruct the lives of these two ancient rivals and recreate a confrontation featuring power, stealth and secret weapons on an ancient battlefield over 120 million years ago.

9)  Largest Killers 
Utahraptor vs Tyrannosaurus Rex
Millions of years of evolution have created some of the most terrifying and monstrous dinosaurs ever imagined. Now, we get a firsthand look at some of the most deadly dinosaurs. From the man-sized Utahraptor, to the gigantic Tyrannosaurus Rex; we'll focus on their sizes, weaponry and behaviors, ultimately revealing the one killer who is responsible for more deaths than all other predators combined.

10)  River of Death 
Pachyrhinosaurus vs Albertosaurus
The pack of Albertosaurus charge at the herd of Pachyrhinosaurus. The herd stampedes towards a raging river bed and the predators corner the prey, although one breaks free. One of the Albertosaurus chases it into a clearing, and it attempts to kill the Pachyrhinosaurus, however the Pachyrhinosaurus gores the enemy in the leg, enraging it. The Albertosaurus then bites down on to its neck and flips the herbivore over and tears at its underbelly. Back at the river, the other Albertosaurus is backing the Pachyrhinosaurus herd into the river. In their panic, they drown and the Albertosaurus finds the carcasses further down river.

11)  Raptor vs T Rex 
Edmontosaurus vs Dromaeosaurus
A lonely Edmontosaurus looks for a herd to live in but instead wanders into the territory of a pack of Dromaeosaurus. The faster, smarter and deadly carnivores attack the duck-billed dinosaur and manage to bring it down, though one or two of the pack members are killed by the herbivore in the process as well. Then a Tyrannosaurus rex, attracted by all the noises, comes over and steals the dead Edmontosaurus, leaving the Dromaeosaurus pack with just the tail, which it bit off to make the corpse lighter.

12)  Armaggedon 
Scientists explain the extinction of the dinosaurs
65 million years ago, a gigantic asteroid crashes in the coast of Yucatan, Mexico. It leaves a gigantic crater and it creates a meteor shower in the process while it also makes a cloud of deadly gas spreading throughout the land. Most of the dinosaurs (usually including Tyrannosaurus rex, Majungasaurus, Albertosaurus, Nanotyrannus, Dromaeosaurus, Edmontosaurus, and Pachyrhinosaurus) had seen the impact and they attempt to run for cover, though some of them died in the series of meteors and the clouds. Soon, the dinosaurs are now extinct as a Tyrannosaurus collapses to the ground, dead, but then, this may be the time where humans and other animals replace the dinosaurs as the dominant species of Earth itself.
