A peasant couple sell all their worldly possessions so that the husband can take advantage of an overseas job offer. One month after he was supposed to have flown abroad, he turns out to have been victimized by illegal recruitment. He is deported back to the country for trumped-up robbery charges and returns home. The tragedy is bound to bring his marriage and family life to vast ruin. Written by Gil Portes
