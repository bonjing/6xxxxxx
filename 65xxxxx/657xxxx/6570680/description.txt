All these songs are free to download there, but its a confusing system. This is easier!

hello.  who are you?
my name is jonathan visger, and i create experimental pop music as absofacto.
i'm also in the band mason proper.

if you don't know where to start, i'd suggest the music page. 

can i really download all your music free?
you sure can, if you need to.  every bit of music i put out is pay-what-you-want (with few exceptions).  if you can pay something for it, it really does help me offset the expense of doing this, but if you can't, just get it anyway, enjoy it, share it with other people, and drop me a nice note sometime to brighten my day.

i make music because i love doing it.  not everyone has the disposable income to support artists they love.  i know everyone would if they could.

do you play live?
i tour with my band mason proper, but not on my own right now.  i like to put the time i would spend on double rehearsal, touring, etc. into creation of more music.

can i play your music on my radio station/blog/youtube video/etc?
go right ahead.  all i ask is that you link back to absofacto.com, let me know you used it, and i prefer that you post songs streaming instead of for direct download, so that people come download it from my site and i can feel happy.  the bandcamp players are embeddable from music.absofacto.com.  but if you can't figure it out, or just don't want to, post an mp3 and don't look back.  i'm not going to come after you, ha.
