 This English edition of a best-selling and award-winning German textbook Reaction Mechanisms: Organic Reactions Â· Stereochemistry Â· Modern Synthetic Methods is aimed at those who desire to learn organic chemistry through an approach that is facile to understand and easily committed to memory. Michael Harmata, Norman Rabjohn Distinguished Professor of Organic Chemistry (University of Missouri) surveyed the accuracy of the translation, made certain contributions, and above all adapted its rationalizations to those prevalent in the organic chemistry community in the English-speaking world. 
 Throughout the book fundamental and advanced reaction mechanisms are presented with meticulous precision. The systematic use of red "electron-pushing arrows" allows students to follow each transformation elementary step by elementary step. Mechanisms are not only presented in the traditional contexts of rate laws and substituent effects but, whenever possible, are illustrated using practical, useful and state-of-the-art reactions. The abundance of stereoselective reactions included in the treatise makes the reader familiar with key concepts of stereochemistry. 
 The fundamental topics of the book address the needs of upper-level undergraduate students, while its advanced sections are intended for graduate-level audiences. Accordingly, this book is an essential learning tool for students and a unique addition to the reference desk of practicing organic chemists, who as life-long learners desire to keep abreast of both fundamental and applied aspects of our science. In addition, it will well serve ambitious students in chemistry-related fields such as biochemistry, medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry.
