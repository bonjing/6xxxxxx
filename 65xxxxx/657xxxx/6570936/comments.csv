thanks for posting
but no way for full screen?"
,CriCriX3,2011-08-02T10:03Z,runs really choppy 
,11rcombs,2011-08-06T18:43Z,"Crackabad: It's currently forced into a window, it'd be fullscreen by default. If you really want fullscreen support, hold down Alt/Option and open the game; a Wineskin window will appear. Go to ""Screen Options"" and change ""Rootless (windowed)""  to ""Fullscreen"". You'll have to change it back to go back to windowed mode, though. Also, when in fullscreen mode, to go into pseudo-fullscreen mode (which isn't a real window, but only takes up part of the screen), press option-command-A.
CriCriX3: try adjusting the graphics settings. If that doesn't help, then it's probably just your machine not being fast enough for it, sorry!"
