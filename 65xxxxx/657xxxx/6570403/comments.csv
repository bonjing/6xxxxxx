[V],extremezone,2011-07-29T21:37Z,"@maki1999 no real/working crack is available,maybe this game will be never cracked...who knows?"
,djdj88,2011-08-05T02:42Z,"hey love your upload, Wicked quality.... just one thing, there is no sound..am i missing something? please get back, thanks :)"
,MikesUploadz,2011-08-05T06:23Z,@djdj88 Are you using Windows Media Player? That is not compatible. Download VLC player and use that. That should work.
,MikesUploadz,2011-08-05T06:29Z,Thanks. But a 480p BluRay movie? It wouldn't be bluray then would it?
,djdj88,2011-08-05T10:26Z,VLC PLAYER works. Thanks Mike
,LuigiVuoto,2011-08-08T05:23Z,"Great job, extremezone. 

IMO the third Godfather movie is highly underrated.  You have to view it through the operatic scope with which it was made.  Over the top certainly, but still, great cinema, unlike anything else."
,dixon817,2011-08-10T12:39Z,"~ hi extreme, love your work. are the subs for the italian spoken parts in Godfather part 2 hardcoded? ~"
,exarmy28,2011-08-21T14:35Z,AS THE ABOVE COMMENT HAS ALREADY MENTIONED ARE THE PARTS WITH SUBTITLES IN ENGLISH PLEASE AS THERE IS ALOT OF ITALIAN SPEAKING IN PART 2??
,danielsonn77,2011-08-30T05:00Z,NO SUBTITLES NO SUBTITLES!!!!
,danielsonn77,2011-08-30T06:22Z,"So I find some subs, like 2 hrs searching the right ones, all goes well until we get to the louis restaurant scene where pacino is talking in italian AND THE FUCKING SUBTITLES ARE NON EXISITANT!! wot's the point creating subtitles in english for the entire film then leaving them out for the italian parts???!?!?! utter insanity!! "
,bongowolf,2011-09-11T00:38Z,"CAN YOU GET THE """"THE GODFATHER EPIC"""" THAT WAS ON THE FIRST 2 MOVIES --- WHICH HAD HOURS OF EXTRA SCENES?????

THAT WOULD BE AWESOME! PLEASE PLEASE TRY TO GET """"THE GODFATHER EPIC""""!!!!!!!!!!!

YOU ARE THE BEST!"
,tasian,2011-09-14T23:02Z,"extremezone, thanks for the upload. Also i was wondering what's with all the touches in the film? What does that mean? I know that it's common coutesy to say hello, and maybe shake a hand (which i dont like vey much), whithout this you don't know attitude of interlocutor, and feel like maybe he hold a grudge which don't wanna to expose. But what with the touches all the time? Is it sign of trust? Sollozo killed L.B. while tapping his hand. I already like Italins less, not because of the mob thing, but because of cultivation of viruses. I just wanna know, may be it is realy healthy or usable."
,phoellix07,2012-02-10T21:11Z,"Thanks for the upload !

Guys just search for  The.Godfather.(Part I, II, III e.t.c. ) .BRRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON subtitles. They are a perfect match and have the Italian parts subbed. 

. Cheers!"
