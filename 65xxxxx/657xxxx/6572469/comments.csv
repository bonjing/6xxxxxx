With regard to some web browsers, e.g. the Internet Explorer or Safari, these settings have an system-wide impact. That means that perhaps other applications as well start to work again only then, when you have set back these settings. "

And no. Neither JAP, the predecessor of JonDo, nor JonDo itself contained ever a backdoor. If experts study the source code they can go and see for themselves of it.

Only the server component of the system, i.e. a mix, where you are connecting to via JAP/JonDo, contains due to legal reasons the possibility to keep connections under surveillance. But this works just in case all mix operators of a cascade are forced to. That is why JonDos recommend to choose always JonDonym services with two or three, as far as possible, international mixes and providers and no single ones, as the service ""Dresden"". Single mixes similar to classical proxies or VPN-services are kept quite easily under surveillance. "

""The popular Java Anonymous Proxy (JAP), used to anonymise one's comings and goings across the Internet, has been back-doored by court order.""

I've no idea why you are trying to spread lies here, the software was modified via a mandatory update to record all IPs connecting to a website via JAP."
