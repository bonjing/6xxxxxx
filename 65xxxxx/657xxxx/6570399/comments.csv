,para11,2011-08-05T20:34Z,"grabberone;
 you sir desrve a medal for this,, keep up the good work"
,para11,2011-08-05T20:40Z,"just in case it helps anyone else,  after copying the 'VrayBridge' folder to the cinema4d/plugins folder, now use the crack to generate a key file and make sure the key file then sits in the cinema4d folder.

'vraybridge engine' should be seen under the render settings, General menu, on the render engine list along with the normal engines.

thanks again grabberone"
,Dionision,2011-08-10T05:03Z,"the crack keeps telling me that i have a invalid key 1. what key do i copy into it 
2. is there any other way of doing this ?"
,para11,2011-08-21T19:10Z,"Dionision,

if you have not already worked it out yet, you only paste the first 11 numbers of the cd key into the keygen."

,eTiger1974,2011-08-30T03:51Z,"Need help with the keygen.

After replacing the Vraybridge folder into the plugins folder 
I put inn the serial letters from cinema 4d into the keygen and direkted to the cinema 4d folder. Was it suposed to generate a file ""VrayBridge.key""?

I dont manage it to work. Can someone help me? Step by step"
,rengelgeer,2011-09-01T21:46Z,"Nice thx :D,
Only got 1 problem though, when I render, and I interupt in by clicking in de workspace, my c4d crashes. It does it every time. :C Any solutions??"
,nuclearlion73,2011-09-13T13:13Z,"Thanks, but wo-ha-ha-haowwww does this program suck. All it does is turn the picture into an un-seeable white nothing, nomatter WHAT I put the settings on. I've tried following a couple tutorials to see if maybe it was just me. ...it wasn't. I've followed their settings, and used exact amounts and got fucking NOTHING close to what ANY of them were using.

I shall just stick to the default Global Illumination, thank God I didn't pay for this. Thanks for saving me some money, Grabber"
,odafos,2011-11-01T13:57Z,"Perfect! Thanks a lot, man!"
,odafos,2011-11-01T18:50Z,"Now, I did all you said: I got the key AND placed it in the general C4D folder and in the plugins folder. Yet, when i open C4D, no option for Vray! Am I supposed to do anything else?"
,odafos,2011-11-01T21:20Z,"Ok, I found the problem. The error message I get is WRONG KEY!!! I tried it a few times and I always get the same message. Any suggestion why?"
,odafos,2011-11-01T21:56Z,"Ok, my apologies for my last comment. I found out that I was inserting wrong serial for C4D, but now I got it right and it works! Again, many thanks grabberone!"
,rigo_rv,2012-05-10T02:51Z,"ok I found the problem, first, you do everything before the step 3, when you stay in step 3, paste the register number (copy of register in Cinema 4d), now paste in Xf-vray125.exe but when the crac.k ask you the location of the vraybrige, you need put into other folder exept Cinema 4d root, for example, i put the vrayBridge.key in my documents file and then I copy  it and paste in the  folder of  cinema 4D root, and sorry for my english, i try to explain me

Ok para los latinos, el paso 3 es incorrecto lo que yo hice fue copiar el número de seria de cinema 4d y pegarlo en el crack una vez te pregunte la dirección donde exportara el archivo vraybridge.key, ponlo en otra carpeta que no sea la de cinema 4d por ejemplo mis documentos luego te vas a  tus documentos entonces encontraras el archivo y listo cópialo y pégalo en la carpeta root de cinema 4d y disfruta vray 
Alguna duda rigo.rrv@gmail.com"
