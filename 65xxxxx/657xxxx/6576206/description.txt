Notes: Granville McGhee was Brownie McGhee's younger brother.He acquired his nickname in childhood, from the stick with which he pushed a cart carrying Brownie, at that time disabled by polio, around Kingsport, Tennessee. In 1949, J. Mayo Williams, owner of the small Harlem label, offloaded his unsold stock of Stick's 1947 recording 'Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee' to a distributor in New Orleans, where it became a local hit. Atlantic Records saw a gap in the market, and remade version reached #3 in the charts. For the rest of his recording career, McGhee tried to repeat the success of 'Drinkin' Wine' while putting its lyrics into practice.
The British Ace label - long a prime source for quality compilations - has done Brownie's little brother proud, collecting his dozen 1953-1955 jump blues sides for the King logo, many of them detailing the effects of booze. Also aboard are four country blues-styled numbers by Ralph Willis, and four more by the pseudonymous Big Tom Collins (two of them feature Brownie McGhee's vocals, the other pair Champion Jack Dupree!)
