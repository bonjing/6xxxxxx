RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Platinum Edition, wrapped in a Wineskin. Works on OSX 10.6 and 10.7. Only issue I\'ve seen is that background music doesn\'t work. I\'m working on that problem; if I find a solution, I\'ll re-upload and post a link in the comments. Unzip, runs out of the box. No installation required.
