,Armkin,2011-08-02T19:45Z,"Doesn't work for me, after I unzipped and I click on the icon, there comes a little grey box that says something about Wine, it closes and the app disappears from my dock... Help?"
,jonah_the_bear,2011-08-02T22:35Z,could some one post a working CIV V? i've downloaded a bunch and NONE of them work
,goingmad1,2011-08-03T11:28Z,Is this work under win7? I ask because none of the other versions works under it.
,goingmad1,2011-08-03T11:53Z,Fuck sorry I just spoted that this is for MAC. Stupid me...
,USSR-Hitman,2011-08-04T06:05Z,The fullscreen does not work D: can some one help me if there is way to make it work.
,jonasbro,2011-08-04T23:05Z,"not sure why, but won't work with my MBP running 10.6.8.... I downloaded and unzipped and the icon appears, blinks, then closes."
,11rcombs,2011-08-06T18:38Z,"USSR-Hitman: What version of OSX are you on?
jonasbro: have you tried on Lion?
Armkin: could we have more info about the Wine error? I might be able to help with some more info."
,USSR-Hitman,2011-08-06T22:36Z,@ 11rcombs I am using the latest version of Lion OS X which is 10.7. When I go fullscreen all I see is White on the background and the cursor of the game.
,11rcombs,2011-08-07T04:53Z,"@USSR-Hitman that's strange, I'm not experiencing that issue on my Lion machine here. Try holding down alt while starting, then going to ""Advanced"" and pressing ""test run"". Pastebin the log files, I'll see what I can do."
,banlord,2011-08-07T17:18Z,"I have the same problem that Armkin said ... 

I have Mac OS X 10.6.8 .. 

Have any solution?"
,11rcombs,2011-08-08T04:16Z,@banlord please post the error message.
,iMacintosh,2011-08-08T09:45Z,seed please!
,banlord,2011-08-08T17:14Z,@11rcombs there is no error message....
,iMacintosh,2011-08-09T13:36Z,okay so i have a problem.... i've finished downloading it and when i archive the .zip file it just makes another .zip.cpgz and if i archive that it makes a Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 (2). HELP!! i've left this on for 20 hours i cant just delete it :(
,11rcombs,2011-08-09T23:55Z,"@iMacintosh Try another unarchiver. If that doesn't work, choose ""Verify Local Data"" or something similar in your torrent client. Something was probably downloaded incorrectly."
,banlord,2011-08-10T00:09Z,There is any solution??
,firelightbaby,2011-08-10T20:06Z,"i was able to play for awhile but then this message popped up ""The program RCT3plus.exe has encountered a serious problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience. This can be caused by a problem in the program or a deficiency in Wine."" Any suggestions on what to do?"
,iMacintosh,2011-08-12T07:52Z,I've tried every unarchiver such as The unarchiver and i think something like Suffit expander. but anyways it still didnt solve anything. it would be a real pain to download it again since i dont really have internet (currently using someone elses wirelessly) and it is incredibly weak so the file took me 20 hours... it would all just end up making the big cycle with the cpgz file. any other suggestions? 
,iMacintosh,2011-08-12T08:00Z,and i've just checked the file is 990.2 Mb so everything was installed i dont see whats wrong.
,Hellodaniel123,2011-08-31T20:31Z,Very nice torrent. I havent recieved any error messages or problems and I am currently running OSX 10.6.8. The only error with the torrent is that there is no audio besides the clicking noise.
,Hellodaniel123,2011-08-31T21:00Z,Never mind the audio works :) The audio just has a few glitches
,Acee1371,2011-09-07T07:05Z,i get an error saying error 01 operation not permited
,blkbeauty901,2011-09-12T19:44Z,SEEEEEED!!!! PLZ N THANK YOU 
,lsmanutd4,2011-10-01T21:36Z,"hey does this work for mac os x lion, or is it supported by Power PC?
thanks"
,jbeez,2012-01-05T23:07Z,I wish the uploader wouldn't LIE.... THIS DOESN'T WORK ON 10.7 (Lion)... This is a PowerPC app and therefore is not supported! Waste of time. Thanks mate.
