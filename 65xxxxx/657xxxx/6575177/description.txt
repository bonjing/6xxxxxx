Description:

This greatly expanded edition of Sexual Healing examines every known sexual problem and all possible treatments, including many that are new and experimental. The book includes more than 125 exercises for specific problems â€” including premature ejaculation, female sexual arousal disorder, low sexual desire, and sexual aversion â€” as well as a new section on advanced sexual healing for physical, emotional, and spiritual problems. Written by Barbara Keesling, Ph.D., a professor, sex therapist and former surrogate partner with over 25 years experience, the book reflects the wisdom that comes from her unique perspective as a pioneer in the field of sexuality.

 

Thoroughly updated and revised with the most cutting edge information on human sexuality, this third edition of Dr. Keeslingâ€™s classic text contains 80% new material and has been expanded to 400 pages. It is more like a new book â€” and, in fact, it is the definitive book on the subject. It is both extremely comprehensive and enjoyable to read.
