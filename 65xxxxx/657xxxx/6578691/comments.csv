Heyo 

Depends on what your interested in so many different subjects in these eBooks you will have to say what you would like to know about. I.E Magick , astrology etc

@ DarthDerp

lol it would be nice but the most likely outcome if you intend on conjuring demons and your not experienced is you will become possessed. :S
So best to stay safe ;)"
,DarthDerp,2011-08-05T03:59Z,"Thanks for the torrent and the warning, CtV1, and I'll make sure my ass is covered when doing this, but if there's one thing I've learned in life is that playing it safe gets you nowhere."

""Fuck that. If I can get any of this stuff to work I'm raising hell, literally. =P ""

There is an old folk saying 
""Do not meddle in things which you don't understand, said the dragon to the man.""

I highly advise you take this under consideration. And take the whole ""ooh you might become possessed."" warning with a grain of salt. 

Some actually seek possession in an educated manner. So called white magickians cast circles of protection and call on powers they fear and distrust for aid. This is disrespectful as there is no such thing as white and black magick; only magick and what you do with it.

Just like there is no bad knowledge, only bad action. 
Nothing is forbidden, all is permitted. Be fearless but not stupid. 

However it is equally disrespectful to just start conjuring random entities willy-nilly just because you can.

Educate yourself first and know exactly who and what you invoke or you are asking for trouble.

Much Thx to Cyrus for the upload!!

Whyt he last thing I would do, short of curling up with a testy python, would be sharing this stuff with who knows who.  For research scholars like me, it saves time.  But connecting to those intent on slamming into da wall-- mucho loco.
	It stands to reason that one shields self when dealing with whatever entity is stronger than oneself.  -- unless you fall for the Euro man fallacy tha I am my brain and only what I think exists and only in my world (or the Ameican version-- If I feel it, it must be true).  Anyone that thinks magic of the Light opens up to malefic entities to gain something is foolisha nd misinformed.  --can't get blood from a stone; can't get, lets say, freedom from bondage from an entity that has no sympathy.  
Speaking of stupid.  What do you think happens after death when there are bills to pay to those strong arms that helped you with some trivial ego need?  When you have no body and no protection of ordinary life?  Will those talismans help you then?
As Torrens said in his excellent text of the OGD, of Crowley who ended up addicted, chasing youngsters who would not have him, and walking thru restaurants thinking he was practicing invisibility--  they get you by intellectual vanity. It was a big joke in 1950s BRitain among accultists.  There's Crowley.  Don't look at 'em tho.  He thinks he's invisible and gets touchy if it's plain that you see 'im. ""   Torrens also says, after possession, the lower self (instincitve, etc.) always tries to reunite with one's higher self (higher as in faster, rarefied energies-- that which seeks to create more life.)  
	The far Asians, as usual, have a better approach to all this.  --working with elementals.  -- rather than with discarnates and daemonic forces.
	Also, Crowley and others I've noticed, will deliberately misconstrue information.  Smartin the head, but something flawed there.  Something small and peevish.
Only the best teachers can use the name of a demon to break the hold of a psychological pain.  See Zelator, David Ovason-- a balanced and nuanced chronicle of western occultism.  from A. O Spare and Fulcanelli, architecture and persepctive.  There are some Gurdjieff  colors in it.  The book will stop one from wasting esteem on the likes of Leadbeater, Levi, Crowley, Duquette, and the boys.  There is a quest beyond the powers, which never give freedom, beyond new age sentiment and play, and beyond religion dogma and sterile phillosphy.  Some are more concerned with balancing the energies of the human machine and transcending that machine, with waking up.  Putting oneself under more laws, more debt, and at the  touch of barely checked critters, is a poor way of proceeding."
