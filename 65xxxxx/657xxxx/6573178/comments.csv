[T],thetorrentlord,2011-07-31T17:18Z,"Am I mistaken, but don't DVD rips belong here (http://thepiratebay.org/browse/205), not in the  Highres category ?"
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-07-31T17:21Z,"Please ignore my last comment if this is a homemade DVD of the 720p files, but it says 720x576 in your description and that is not considered Highres."
[T],Hornigold,2011-07-31T21:16Z,"You're right Torrentlord, it should be in the normal section, my misstake. I normally place all my torrents in the high res section, so it was the automatic pilot who did the trick ;) Next season is up and in the normal section: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6574797/Dark_Blue_S02_%28WEB-DL_DD5.1_NL_Subs%29_Hornigold_TBS"
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-08-02T03:13Z,"Thanks for answering, as I am no expert and wanted to be sure. I have grabbed a few of your posts in the past and they were always great quality."
