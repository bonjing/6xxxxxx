,FRO1L4NDR35,2012-04-02T18:04Z,"NO Password Required (when I extracted POP RS).
POP Revelations (NOT Rival Swords) worked nice until the Intro, where it shuts down (hard Shut Down) my PSP.
I have a PSP3000 with LCFW 6.60 ME-1.5."
,FRO1L4NDR35,2012-04-02T18:27Z,"It seems the problem in the intro was caused by applying compression ("".cso"").
after trying with the normal "".iso"" file it worked fine.
Thanks VM! Keep up the good work."
