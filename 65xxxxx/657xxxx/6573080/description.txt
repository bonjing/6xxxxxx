Plot:
Stijn and Carmen have everything: They are young, successful and wealthy. They live a perfect
life in Amsterdam and move to Amstelveen when they have a child, Luna. Then the world collapses
as Carmen is diagnosed with breast cancer. Going in and out of the hospital, first chemotherapy
and later radiation therapy, throw up, the whole cancer package is there. Stijn has trouble
dealing with it and starts living a second life. By day he's all but support to Carmen, by night
he goes out, drinks and has lots of sex with lots of woman. Carmen has always known that Stijn
is not the faithful type, but after her breast is amputated she gets less confident and finds
herself troubling over his unfaithfulness. For Stijn it has always been just sex, until he meets
Roos. During the cancer period he sees her more and more. Then a miracle, Carmen is better. She
