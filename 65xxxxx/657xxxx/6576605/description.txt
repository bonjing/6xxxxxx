Redline is the Worldâ€™s number 1 performance car tuning magazine. Redline features performance cars, aftermarket parts, tuning guides and car news.

Itâ€™s our Ford vs Vauxhall special, and the cover story sees a tuned Focus ST and Astra VXR go head-to-head at Bruntingthorpe. We also turn back the clock to pit two legends from Ford and Vauxhall against each other: The RS500 Sierra Cosworth and the incredible Lotus Carlton.
