Vegetable oils are used in various industrial applications such as emulsifiers, lubricants, plasticizers, surfactants, plastics, solvents, and resins. Research and development approaches take advantage of the natural properties of these oils. These oils have superb environmental credentials, such as being inherently biodegradable, having low ecotoxicity and low toxicity towards humans, being derived from renewable resources and contributing no volatile organic chemicals.

Recent research has focused on the development of new industrial products, including the use of vegetable oils in paint and coatings, printing inks, engine oils, and biodiesel. Industrial Uses of Vegetable Oils offers new insights into these important (and growing) products of vegetable oils, while also covering developments in biodegradable grease, vegetable oils-based polyols, and the synthesis of surfactants from vegetable oil feedstocks.
