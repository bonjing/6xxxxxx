 Set in the underbelly of Mumbai; in the       
 notorious by-lanes where 'Greed is a          
 Culture' and 'Deceit becomes a Compulsion'    
 'Bhindi Baazaar Incorporation' revolves       
 around gangs of pickpockets who consider      
 pick pocketing as an art. They use their      
 intelligence as a canvas and their            
 spontaneity as a brush to survive in this     
 dangerous lively hood. 'Bhindi Baazaar Inc.'  
 is the story of a pawn and his calculated     
 moves to reach the end of the chessboard.     
 Revolving around a crime syndicate who are    
 in the business of pickpocket, the film       
 starts with a game of chess between two       
 characters 'Shroff' and 'Darzi'. Each move    
 unfolds their story and eventually the        
 motive of their meeting. The story unravels   
 the quest of a small time pickpocket 'Fateh'  
 next in line to be a MAMU (local area-head).
