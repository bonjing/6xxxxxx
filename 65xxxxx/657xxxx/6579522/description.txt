Hennie van Greuning, Darrel Scott, Simonet Terblanche, "International Financial Reporting Standards: A Practical Guide, 6 edition" 
World Bank Publications | 2011 | ISBN: 0821384287 | 448 pages | PDF | 82,3 MB

Applying International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in a business situation can have a significant effect on the financial results and position of a division or an entire business enterprise. International Financial Reporting Standards: A Practical Guide gives private Ã‚â€“ or public-sector executives, managers, or financial analysts without a strong background in accounting the tools they need to participate in discussions and decisions on the appropriateness or application of IFRS. 

Each chapter summarizes an International Financial Reporting Standard, following a consistent structure: 

*Problems addressed by the IFRS 
*Scope of the Standard 
*Key concepts and definitions 
*Accounting treatment 
*Presentation and disclosure 
*Financial analysis and interpretation 

Many chapters of the book also contain examples that illustrate the practical application of key concepts in a particular standard. Titled International Accounting Standards: A Practical Guide in its previous two editions, the publication includes all of the standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) through 31 May 2004.
