,Jeronwong,2011-08-11T22:34Z,Why does it still say that the Winrar is an evaluation copy?
,sheepishly-Liz,2011-08-13T23:07Z,I don't have any file that says 'rarreg.key' ...

Register WinRAR! Open Folder ""WinRAR Licenses"", and you'll see 20 Different Folders, each folder is named after the license that is inside the folder, choose license name that you mostly like, open that Folder and you'll see in it ""rarreg"" file. Now follow instructions! You can find them in notepad ""Instructions"" or in my torrent Description.

@ sheepishly-Liz. 
All ""rarreg"" files are in ""WinRAR Licenses"" folder,
where every license is sorted after its name in different folder. You can see that even by clicking on Files: 25 on my torrent Summary, so I wish you not to be n00b and enjoy TPB. :)"

Also don't uncheck any files while downloading torrent files. Download all files in this torrent, so you don't make any mistakes. Good Luck!"

,piratetester,2011-09-07T09:16Z,sorry mate. every time i try to download a winrar torrent it says access is denied(i cant even start downloading!). Is this because i already have the trail of winrar? PLEASE HELP!!!

You're Welcome! :D

@ piratetester

No, trial of WinRAR cannot cause that! Maybe you haven't permissions to download it, because you Logged in as User, not as Administrator, or you have Parental Control turned on or smth like that. Sometimes Anti-Viruses/ Internet Securities doesn't let you to download file, because it contains smth that AV/IS detects as a virus, trojan, spyware etc ( on TPB it's usually false-positive), but the problem is that this ""WinRAR 4.01 x86 x64 +20 Licenses [CheckOutEr]"" Torrent doesn't contain anything that even worst AV/IS can detect as any kind of threat, because it contains only clean WinRAR setups and pregenerated registration files, so if you're Administrator then in my opinion you have previously downloaded somewhere infected WinRAR Torrent & to protect your PC from virus your AV/IS Neuthralized that threat & Automatically added it to its reports that it doesn't let you to download the same files with the same size again (that setup files could be exactly the same size as in my Torrent). To solve this problem you have to Quaratine all objects that are in your AV/IS ""Quaratine"" , scan your PC for viruses, make sure that your AV/IS Status is ""Protected"", Clear all your Reports (that's the most important part) & Download this Torrent again! I hope it helps! :)"
