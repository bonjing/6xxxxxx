I have received an incomplete episode of TAR this week. The last 10 minutes of this episode were missing.
Thankfully, after a lot of searching, I found parts of this episode on the net, so after some cutting and pasting, I managed to complete the episode, but not in the quality I would like it to be. (This is only the case for the final 10 minutes of the show)
I apologise for this and hopefully this won't happen again!
Have a great weekend!"
