,RaW-D-Coy,2011-08-01T16:35Z,"Tricked by his mother and trapped by his father, who wants him to return to being a pit bull fighting in the ring, Tommy breaks free. He beats his father to death and accidentally kills his mother, who has leapt to her husbandâ€™s defense. Tommy turns to Sam. Sam not only helps Tommy get rid of the bodies, but actually provides words of comfort â€“ and admits that heâ€™s killed two people himself (albeit not his parents).

After seeing the words â€œBaby Not Yoursâ€ scrawled on the wall in red crayon, Arlene (Carrie Preston) is convinced that the ghost of her babyâ€™s birth father Rene Lenier is haunting the house. Husband Terry (Todd Lowe) calls in the local minister, who brings along his new wife Lettie Mae (Adina Porter), mother of Tara (Rutina Wesley). They conducted a tuneful exorcism that leave Arlene and Terry feeling safer â€“ because they donâ€™t notice a matchbook that spontaneously catches fire.

After rescuing Jason (Ryan Kwanten) from bleeding to death on the side of the road, Jessica (Deborah Woll) is skittish with Hoyt (Jim Parrack), perhaps as a result of drinking Jasonâ€™s blood. Jason has a sexual dream about both Jessica and Hoyt that leaves him very disturbed.

Bill (Stephen Moyer) has broken off his sexual relationship with Portia (Courtney Ford) on learning sheâ€™s his descendant. When Portia presses the issue, going on about how incest is no longer a big deal in most states, Bill glamours her into not only being disinterested in him, but into becoming terrifying and running screaming at the sight of him (want to bet this is going to come back to bite him?).

At Sookieâ€™s house, Eric has a nightmare in which his maker Godric (Allan Hyde) tells him that he is damned and should feed on Sookie. Eric finds himself in Sookieâ€™s bedroom, but when Sookie wakes, she prevents Eric from attacking her. She comforts him, says she has always felt there is good in him, and lets him cry in her lap.

Completely unaware of Ericâ€™s current state, Lafayette (Nelsan Ellis), Jesus (Kevin Alejandro) and Tara leave Wiccan leader Marnie (Fiona Shaw) in the woods after determining sheâ€™s useless. Jesus persuades Lafayette that Jesusâ€™ powerful â€“ if disliked â€“ sorcerer grandfather in Mexico can protect them. Tara at first thinks to return to her lover in New Orleans, but since the woman has just found out that Tara has lied to her about many things (including identity), Tara instead turns to Sookie â€“ until Eric walks into the room, causing Tara to bolt.

Sookie tries to find out exactly what has happened to Eric and gets information from one of her co-workers about Marnie. Sookie poses as an innocent walk-in customer, but while Marnie is giving Sookie a reading, Sookie hears the voice of her late grandmother (Lois Smith) telling her Marnie is dangerous. Marnie hears this too and protests, but Sookie takes Grandmaâ€™s advice and runs. Eric worries that heâ€™ll harm Sookie, but Sookie asks Eric to stay with her and kisses him. Not surprisingly, Eric stays.

Ericâ€™s progeny Pam (Kristin Bauer Von Straten) is rotting after being cursed by Marnie while Marnie â€“ possessed by an ancient witch at that moment â€“ was defending herself (and Tara, Lafayette and Jesus). Pam, her face falling off in bits, wants permission from Louisianaâ€™s new vampire king Bill to kill the witch, but Bill is mindful of the command of the vampire authority that no humans be killed by vampires. Instead, Bill has his soldiers collect Marnie and put her in a cell. Marnie insists she has no memory of the spells she performed on Eric or Pam; Bill glamours Marnie and finds she is telling the truth. One of Billâ€™s sheriffs tells of a witch in 1600s Spain (from Marnieâ€™s visions, this is the woman who is helping/possessing her) who used necromancy to drag vampires within a twenty-mile radius into the sun, so they have a serious problem. In the chaos, Pam inadvertently blurts out that Marnie gave Eric amnesia â€“ after sheâ€™s previously insisted to Bill she has no idea where Eric is. Bill forces Pam to tell him that Eric is in fact at Sookieâ€™s"
,maxjahnke,2011-08-01T17:20Z,What the hell are they doing to the show? It's turning into some Vampire Diaries shit ¬¬ It's gotta gay down and get back to be the wildness it used to be.

,xxbowpkerxx,2011-08-01T21:27Z,Thanks EZTV yours amazing
,analu,2011-08-01T21:44Z,"@maxjahnke:

Well, they're not doing anything to the show - each season is (roughly) a one book adaptation of a 7 books series - the ''True Blood - Sookie Stackhouse'' series, by Charlaine Harris - so... they pretty much have to follow most of the story the writer created.

In spite of this, they have made some changings when compared with the books... some good, some not so good...

Well, I must admit that I agree with you: 
the 1st two seasons were kickass and the the last season and this one... not exactly as good... but I got the same feeling when reading the books - it feels like going down the hill, like Charlaine was too concerned about getting as many side stories and ideas going on as she could think of, which made the main stories - the really good ones and the soul of the series - less solid and a bit out of focus. :/

Anyway, thanx for  the  up, EZTV! 
Great as always! ^__^\m/

Cheers from Portugal."
