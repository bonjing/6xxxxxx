,loderunna,2011-08-10T05:44Z,Doesn't work. Slysoft have already countered the patches for this version.
,Buck_Plankchest,2011-08-19T20:50Z,"Thanks for the up - I could NOT get this MF to work (using other separate patches here on PB) except by using this pre-activated install, which worked easily and quickly.

Information screen in the program shows it as registered (as opposed to trial).

I'd suggest installing this offline, then unticking the update box in the program's information screen (that's what I did).  I don't know yet myself however if that's going to be a cure to keep it from going back to trial."
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-09-05T19:23Z,"well absolutely !
first : uninstall any previous version
delete all anyDVD key registry by regedit.exe
as well as its complete folder.
B) reboot and disconnect from internet !
C) install this new one as still offline
D)uncheck : check automaticaly new update to avoid the damn online server checker and now,
reboot again !
And normaly it should working fine
Alternative method who works fine also.
Use the soft as still offline ;)
Works perfectly for me !
Why not for you so ?
