Welcome to the magical world of Asguaard where Fairies, Dwarves and legendary creatures live together in relative peace.

Yet their future is about to be torn apart.

Somewhere, somehow, the Pandora Box has been opened. A series of devestating plagues each worse than the previous are on their way, tearing apart the lands and creatures before them. The magical inhabitants are powerless to prevent the tragedy yet there is hope.

A committee of Fairies gather at Asguaard's highest village. Their immense task is to summon a creature able to achieve miracles, a creature read about in the oldest of books, a creature that is in posession of something that the Asguaard kind can only dream of and hold in awe. The possession is a soul and the creature - a human.

Come join the fight for Asguaard, a tale of friendship, passion and heroism.
