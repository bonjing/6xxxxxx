FREE TO MOVE with the Intu-Flow Longevity System

Scott Sonnon pioneered the discipline of joint mobility in the West as a means of recovering from congenital disease, chronic pain and a host of injuries he incurred as an international martial arts champion and USA National Team Coach. His latest book, Free to Move: The Intu-Flow Longevity System, is already being called THE BIBLE OF JOINT MOBILITY. Even athletes and fitness enthusiasts suffer from injuries and joint pains! But these pains are entirely avoidable if you perform a simple routine of joint mobility exercises for several minutes each day. Free to Move teaches you the basics of this system, as well as the crucial progression you can follow to regain your full, natural range of motion. By following the plan contained in this book, you will release the abundant energy that is already within you and unlock your body's limitless healing potential. You can have the best nutrition in the world, but if you don't move each joint through its full range of motion daily those nutrients won't reach the tissues that are starved for it. Free to Move teaches you how to decompress each of the joints in order to bathe them in nutritive and lubricative synovial fluid, shipping that crucial nutrition in and waste products out. If you perform this simple program for as little as 8 minutes per day, you drink from a FOUNTAIN OF WELLNESS which extends longevity by slowing - and in some cases reversing - the typical accelerated aging process.
