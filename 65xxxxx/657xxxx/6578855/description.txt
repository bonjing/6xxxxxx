Marie recorded her fifth solo album I En Tid Som VÃ¥r at Vinden Studios, the newly built studio at her house in Djursholm, Stockholm, between February and September of 1996. The album was released in the beginning of November the same year but there was no solo tour connected with the release. The main reason for this was, of course, that Marie gave birth to her second child, Oscar Mikael Bolyos on November 26, 1996.  (mariefredriksson.net)
