,H0llyw00d7,2011-08-10T12:09Z,"Hi. New to the whole download scene. 
YIFY or perhaps someone else out there can help. Really love the work as the quality is absolutely amazing especially for the file size but would like the same choice of downloads but without subs.
Please help someone."
,albokid89,2011-08-14T22:21Z,This shit was pretty funny gotta admit haha ___+1
,lapd_cop,2011-10-17T04:23Z,"Audio-10/10

,Cobain67,2011-10-31T20:41Z,"Audio/Video  10/10

Honestly, I delete the subtitles.  I'm not old and deaf yet.  I could understand in a movie like Snatch, when you have brad pitt talking like he's an irish auctioneer, but even I could make out most of what he was saying and it's actually meant to be so you can't understand him.  That's the whole point.  Anyway, I digress.  The point is, like other people have said, IT'S FREE.  If you people want perfection, but the dvd/blu-ray and stop your complaining.  It's sad that people like this are why we are being stereotyped as a lazy country.  We think even our free, illegal stuff should be perfect.  Grow up and get out of the house."

You should just make 480p when you want small files with h264.
Still a bit better than xvid files and you can have some decent audio and bit rate.
Just my opinion no offence intended"
