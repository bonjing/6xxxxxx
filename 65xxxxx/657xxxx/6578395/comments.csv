,ChiliNoMoreX,2011-08-03T19:04Z,"yeah.. the game's pretty much bugged as all the games with a ""paradox interactive"" stamp.
but it's still a great inovative game like all paradox games.
few crashes to desktop (CTD) and some perfomance issues [specially when you're destroying buildings, framerate can go from 120fps to 3 - ati radeon 5770.] but i'm sure everything will be patched within a week"
,moa1234,2011-08-03T22:51Z,"Yea crashing for me randomly, don't see any special reason for it to crash. It starts up quick though, so I just save every 10mins or so. 

Save before you port into a town is smart. "
,Raven_11,2011-08-04T08:51Z,"Make sure you have NVidia Physx on your comp.  I actually own this game, and never had a crash yet.  "
,rocker991,2011-08-05T09:21Z,"I have NVidia Physx ,but i stil have crashas, and now???"
