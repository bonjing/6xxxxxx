,Audiioholic,2011-07-31T18:19Z,"@Anacondaz, When I try and run the crack, it says thay I need administrator privilages. I then 'run as administrator' and it gives the same message. HELP"
,wesleyroyer,2011-08-02T05:09Z,Any word on a Mac crack yet?
,wesleyroyer,2011-08-02T05:10Z,"And this crack works, no problems at all. Love the new interface."
,kilroyj,2011-08-02T19:40Z,"Thanks for good work. Seems to work for now :-)
Let's see if it stays so.

@Audiioholic:
Remember to NEVER run any patch, keygen, whatever on your live system. Have a small, isolated XP virtual machine handy where you can do the bad things and remember to rollback afterwards.

Does anyone have seen the sound samples that go with the Box - 4DVDs?"
,ducadae,2011-08-04T04:03Z,"Thanks for the upload.  The patch says it ran fine, but there is still that 30 day limit on the program.  How do I get around this?  Thanks again for the upload.  The program is great."
,ducadae,2011-08-04T04:23Z,Nevermind.  Figured it out.  Moved the files to the directory.  Thanks again.
,DMGDeed,2011-08-10T16:52Z,Any way of getting the Avid Orchestra separately? It's clearly not included with this torrent.  General MIDI does not cut it for me.  Not in the slightest.
,majorgeek95,2011-08-11T03:39Z,how do you use the crack for this?
,zoals987,2011-08-17T10:33Z,Save the patch as the SARILib.dll file (in the Sibelius 7 program folder). Seems to work now...
,ManyInterests,2011-08-18T13:27Z,"THOSE HAVING PATCHING ISSUES: 

1. Run the install setup.
2. Run the patch - The patcher notes that you must have admin privileges for the patch to be successful, it's *not* saying you *don't* have them.... 

It will then prompt you with a Windows explorer screen... go into the installed directory and identify the SARILib.dll file, click it, click ok, the patch should work.
3. Run the Sibelius.exe out of that same folder.
4. Enjoy.


If anybody figures out how to get Avid Orchestra running on this torrent, it'd be much appreciated... or getting anything better than the general midi My midi playback in Sibelius 6 was way better.


Great torrent, first one to motivate me to create a Pirate Bay account. 

Cheers."

,swmmng,2011-12-09T08:25Z,"I'm also unable to fully patch. I just get the 30-day trial message. Annoying, to say the least!"
,angelguard16,2012-01-06T19:15Z,"As stated in a previous comment
Those with 64bit versions of windows should patch SARILib.dll files in both ()>programme files and ()>programme files (x86) folders as in the start menu you can decide whether you want to open the 64 or 32 bit versions of sibelius. however, i only patched the 32bit folder so when i opened the shortcut the installer created on my desktop (64bit) it still stated i was on the 30day trial

for those trying to follow the instructions 'to-the-letter':
nothing needs extracting or copying
just run the installer, and then the patch (twice if you're 64bit)
hope this saves some time for people faffing around trying to find out where they went wrong (like i did)"
,jonathanang,2012-01-07T16:31Z,"Excellent torrent, works perfectly. Remember to patch both your x64 and normal program files if you're running 64-bit."
,Legended,2012-01-23T04:05Z,"Works 100%!!!

after installation I clicked the patch which automatically redirected me to ""C:\Program Files\Avid\Sibelius 7"" then opened ""SARILib.dll"". after that I was ready to go. Thanks for sharing. I appreciate it."

,Philarte,2012-04-04T17:08Z,"Great torrent! Thank you very much! It took me a while to figure out how the patching works but it works fine now. 

You just have to click on ""Avid_Sibelius_7_Generic_Patch.exe"" you have to find the ""SARILib.dll"" file in the ""C:Program FilesAvidSibelius 7"" and just click open. It will get patched instently. 

Thank you again Anacondaz!!!"
,Kungsbacka_40,2012-05-21T12:08Z,"My problem is I run W7 Swedish version, and the patch says I need ""Adminstrators rights"". I Have that, but in Swedish it says ""Adminstratör"".

Can this be the issue, or does anyone have another solution to my problem?

Please help me!"
,ellalacka,2012-05-30T22:53Z,"@kungsbacka_40
när du har öppnat patchen så får du leta fram en fil som heter SARILib.dll 
den finns i mappen Avid -> Sibelius7 längst ner. sen borde det funka. Lycka till!"
