Perfectly fine to watch, will be getting this when it comes to bluray, great film.

One bad thing, lip sync is slightly off, so if that annoys you, not the right one."

i mean... froggie... good job bud thanks for the upload... but honestly... it's out of most theaters i feel like there should at least be an R5 out there."

I agree totally, I mean thanks to all the uploaders really! But alot of movies that have been released later still have better versions out.. Is it something with this movie or what?"
