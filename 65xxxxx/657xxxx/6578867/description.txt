The Previously most powerful trait theory ever known to man to explain
human behaviour and motivations and inner core existentialism has
in recent years been completely re-written and misrepresented to advocate
a level of political correctness that borders on fraud, on the part
of the Personalysis Corporation (previously the now disappeared Manatec Institute
published the more reliable version and did the original research).

For example, in a bid to obfuscate what trait groupings are "rationally supreme" (blue in the original findings) are now assigned to "red" (aggressive in the original findings).

As such we can only consider their stuff now not useful - unless they
have the wisdom to put the real goods back on the shelf and stop flogging some
trash they may be trying to foist onto you instead to support a drive towards
aggressive tendency based compliance models of the stupid insane as is the 
currently political correct nightmare before us potentially.

Here is a critical review of the new obfuscated version (described as lacking
validity) by an Australian researcher along with our summary of the original work
by Dr Noland. he makes reference to the original version too - in noting
an alternate review published by others too earlier on.
