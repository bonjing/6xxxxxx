,slurpee80,2011-08-11T04:51Z,"This version seems to be narrated by Martin Ball and not Richard Hammond. Weird. Seems to be a similar script, just different narrator."

,PharmaPhamer,2011-10-20T10:40Z,Xramp I get the same thing. Anybody else or is it just our machines?
,LopendePaddo,2011-11-21T21:36Z,"@ xramp 
@pharmaphamer

the problem is the program u are using,like VLC player is awesome but the buffer isnt big enough to run 1080 p well.

try using windows media player.

there might be a way to increase buffer size in other programs but i havent looked into it yet.

good luck"

,m00se1207,2011-12-06T07:54Z,"I have to disagree with LopendePaddo I exclusively use VLC Media player and it any large 1080P movies play fine on my machine without any hiccups or problems whatsoever. I have never had a good experience with WMP unless it was the classic version, I would say your graphics cards cannot handle the detail, RAM and a graphics card update will do you good and is not extremely expensive."
