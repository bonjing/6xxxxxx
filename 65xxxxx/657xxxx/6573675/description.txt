SOURCES:
VIDEO:Thanks m8ty + Russian cam .... thanks
AUDIO:Thanks m8ty

NOTES:

Ok heres a new source of harry potter which contains english subs when needed now The source was very dark in places,but also very bright in light scenes,so needed alot of work.

Firstly we had to rotate and level the video up and then crop all unwanted borders etc....then we moved onto the brightness,contrast and colouring ...which we also tweaked.

Now like we said the bright scenes were very bright and the one @ 1hr 31mins you couldn't see anything,sofor that part we had to take the russian cam and add it into our encode....last around 5mins.

After all that it was down to syncing it and what a pita it was ...due too dark scenes and other things some parts were dam hard to sync,but i think we got most if not all of it sorted Anyway enjoy a new source folks.

GREETS:
FLAWL3SS,KINOPARK,Rx,ELEKTRI4KA,ADDiCTED,Autotron,CiNEDUB,CRYS

And to all the other p2p grps past and present 
Looking for these,syncers,cammers,audio,silver supplier.....Have anything to offer????......
