,thantos123,2011-08-01T07:39Z,"It's been a while since I watched the initial cam versions that came out, but I'm pretty sure this isn't much better in terms of video quality. This is a new source apparently, and I was hoping for a more significant improvement in quality. Audio is pretty good, though.

,spoken428,2011-08-01T08:01Z,"This is probably the best its going to get without going to the cinema. Video is very dark at most places, but you can see what is going on.  Was a great movie however ;)

,azer000,2011-08-02T20:43Z,"Why are there some distortions in the sound that weren't there in the first version? For example, after the dragon scene when Hermione says, 'Did you let him in'?"
,bladeash,2011-08-03T07:20Z,"after the dragon scene when Hermione says, 'Did you let him in'?  the movie freezes for a minute i tried with gomplayer and kmplayer and the same happens."
,azer000,2011-08-03T09:52Z,"@kingofpop : yes, you're completely right, can someone PLEASE fix the end of the audio? I just don't understand what's going on. Imagine's first version was full of cuts, but at least the audio didn't skip; this version's audio contains many errors; when Voldemort is dying, the audio stops suddenly for a second and then continues; it's not an ideal place for an audio error if you know what I mean. :D"
,lee1992,2011-08-08T20:26Z,"the full movie is 2h 10 min not including credits, nearly all the torrents i have seen so far have had between 12 and 15 minutes of the film taken out. There are some obvious cuts, the first one being when the go to speak to Griphook at around 2 minutes 20. Look for HP and the DH part 2 TS TBS its around 4.5 GB but its good quality and its the whole film"
,azer000,2011-08-09T11:25Z,"You're wrong; this movie doesn't contain any cuts at all, the previous imagine version did. 2H10 WITH CREDITS!! I saw the movie in the cinema and this version is complete."
,hu55786,2011-08-18T15:41Z,this aint worth it 2 download better 2 w8
,bobbeamer,2011-09-07T19:35Z,"it's a lot better than the original cam.. if you're desperate to watch again, before the DVDRIP watch this one.. it aint bad at all"
