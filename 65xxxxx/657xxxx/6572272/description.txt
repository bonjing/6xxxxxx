I saw that after vigorous searching for the complete discography for THAW, only the soundtrack was available. I spent all night searching for these songs for a playlist to skateboard to, and now I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m here to share it with you guys. Sorry if some songs need to be named, I downloaded them all off various sites. Have fun, and remember to seed!
