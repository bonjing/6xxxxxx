As I got my greedy little paws on a Compaq Persario 6025RSH with no Hard Drive,it was easy enough to install a drive and install Windows XP Pro -until it came to all the drivers for Ethernet,audio,video.ect.So I hunted all of them up and put the collection together.

The drivers include audio,video,yes the on-board Ethernet controller,modem and even a bios update for the beast They are all here.

Where I am constantly rebuilding older machines for the Computers For Kids project here where I live,sometimes having these drivers handy is a plus.

Please seed after downloading and put in a good word for me.I hope to earn a skull one of these centuries
