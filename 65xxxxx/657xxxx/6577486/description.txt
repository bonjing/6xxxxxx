Nowadays, there is tremendous interest in an integrated imaging approach to urogenital diseases. This interest is tightly linked to the recent technological advances in ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine. Significant improvements in image quality have brought numerous clinical and diagnostic benefits to every medical specialty.

This book is organized in nine parts and twenty-seven chapters. The first six chapters review the normal macroscopic and radiological anatomy of the urogenital system. In subsequent chapters, urogenital malformations, lithiasis, as well as infectious and neoplastic disorders of the kidneys, bladder, urinary collecting system, and male and female genitalia are extensively discussed. The pathologic, clinical, and diagnostic (instrumental and not) features of each disease are described, with particular emphasis, in neoplastic pathologies, on primitive tumors and disease relapse. The statics and dynamics of the pelvic floor are addressed as well and there is a detailed presentation of state-of-the-art interventional radiology.
