Louis Myers  Tell My Story Movinâ€™
Label Earwig 
Released: 1991
Format:Mp3@320
 

Despite the artistic success of 'I'm A Southern Man', Myers went another dozen years without finding a label interested in recording him. by the time Earwig remedied that, he had suffered a minor stroke and hadn't regained full fitness. Consequently his singing is somewhat strained and he plays guitar on only one track, but he compensates by playing lots of harmonica, rooted in style of 40-years-earlier buddies like Little Walter. Steve Freund and John Primer and Barrelhouse Chuck use their space effectively, and altogether this is a pleasing recital of oldfashioned Chicago band music.
Since a serious stroke had largely robbed Myers of his revered ability to play guitar, this effort really isn't indicative of his vast talent. But you've got to give him points for courage -- Myers summoned up the strength to play harp and sing on what would be his final release. A nice Chicago combo that included guitarists Steve Freund and John Primer undoubtedly put Myers's mind at ease. ~ Bill Dahl
