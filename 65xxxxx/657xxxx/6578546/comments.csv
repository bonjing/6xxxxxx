,PikeyBoo,2011-08-02T22:34Z,sorry for double post but damm that seems like steep requierments for what the game is in my opinion?
,Netarangi,2011-08-03T02:03Z,"Lol? How is that steep requirements? Duo core processor, 256MB vid card and 2GB ram? Computers from your local shop come with better specs than that, letalone a gaming PC (Which you should have if you're wanting to play a game)"
,the3kingdoms,2011-08-03T02:38Z,"hey extremezone, i would first like to say, I'm a big fan of the work you do and support you all the way. But I was wondering if you could try and get PC game that I seen on Steam called: Dead Horde havent seen it on here yet! And I think you would get some hits on that game. Thanks again bro...

Hello game multilingue ? thank"
,dragonzer0,2011-08-03T08:49Z," Likeadidas 
I'm running OS Windows Vista  4GB RAM Intel Pentium D 3.60 Nvidia GeForce 8600 GT 512 Sound Blaster Audigy 2 ZS on an old Dell XPS Dim 5 and it plays just fine. I don't try to tweek the game though. It probably doesn't like to be tweeked. Just leave it's default settings alone and it works. Not fast enough don't play it.
Thanks for the up."
,PikeyBoo,2011-08-03T14:01Z,"I think its steep cause its not some big free roam game with outstanding graphics its a top down mediocore graphic game that people with power horse machines seem to be getting tiny fps, take a look at the screen shots and video it looks like great fun but nothing overly special."

no way you can run those games even close to max with that config, unless maybe your screen is like 720x480, mobile graphics suck!"
,dsafjaly69,2011-08-03T17:58Z,"I cant seem to even complete the first mission, re kidnapping the Governor,  he just stands there, glitch?    Is there a special action to be performed?

Also....Managed to stop the game from crashing all the time by going to windowed mode at a much lower resolution."

,haggisofdeath,2011-08-04T18:21Z,So does the patch work or does it need a new crack?
,Ultrakonkret,2011-08-04T20:07Z,"the patch was removed from server while im was downloading it, please someone can upload it here ???"
,entloch,2011-08-04T21:05Z,"I think they deliberately left stuff out, knowing the game would be cracked quickly."
,dasnumnum,2011-08-04T21:09Z,downloaded patch at 4.3mbs from link...and earlier it was 19kbps ^^ all i can say is try again? they might of placed it on a different server?
,haggisofdeath,2011-08-04T21:09Z,"the 900mb version the game asked me to DL had slow speed-20kbs.

It failed to DL 3 times.

Now it says its 192mb? 

downloaded that one 2 times and it says ""unexpected end of archive""

Iv googled it and as far as I can see to date there is no other way to DL it.

I dont know if it even works yet cos I cant even DL it. 10MB net connection always good speeds. "
,entloch,2011-08-04T21:51Z,"I was able to download the entire patch using the link provided by Vada505.  I was then able to apply it to Skidrow's installation, and much to my surprise the game still worked (patches usually require new cracks).

Previously, I was unable to proceed past the mission where you kidnap the governor (near the beginning).  I am now able to pass that, and am currently playing successfully (no crash yet either, but I've only been playing for about 15 minutes)."
