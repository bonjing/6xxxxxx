,bryentheartist,2011-08-03T06:04Z,scenebalance always posts rars. tvteam does not.
,Funkadub,2011-08-03T06:52Z,I'd say thanks but it hasn't moved since it started... still @ 0%
,hootieman,2011-08-03T06:54Z,well Ive been trying to download this for an hour. and 0 bytes? what the fuck
,hootieman,2011-08-03T06:55Z,Ive been trying to get this for an hour and I get 0 bytes? What the fuck is going on. All my other torrents are going at 800-1meg a sec
,hootieman,2011-08-03T06:56Z,oh and one more thing why doesn't this pop up under recent? But I had to go to TV Shows to see this? Another fail.
,Funkadub,2011-08-03T06:57Z,get it from torrentday - just started the dl and its almost done
,bryentheartist,2011-08-03T07:31Z,a fake oviously. been downlaoding for 2 hrs at 0% and there are no pieces. why do idiots constantly post fake shit. us frequent users are onto you.
,Funkadub,2011-08-03T07:54Z,these guys usually post good stuff... but had to get it from somewhere else this time.
,hootieman,2011-08-03T09:55Z,"hey Bryentheartist, I know what fakes are. And this is scenebalance, Ive been downloading off them for god knows how long, and it has a green skull = trusted... so if this is a fake, its a pretty damn good one"
,hootieman,2011-08-03T10:03Z,"yea I'd go to Torrent day, but you gotta pay to get a ratio down, and even if you do pay, you still get a ratio, and what I don't get, if you don't have the means to get torrents out before anyone else does, how are you supposed to upload, its total fucking crap these days, whatever happened to good sites that are free like TPB"
,NitLions,2011-08-03T10:33Z,"I don't get it,  I've had this going for hours and its still at 0%!!! It says 6 seeds and 468 on here but leechers is really like 1,200 with 6 seeds and all 6 in swarm!! I hate that!! Just upload it for real"
,etsoxit,2011-08-03T15:47Z,SEEEEEEDD !!!!!! F... Y.. !!!!
,cassy1998,2011-08-03T17:18Z,This is (obviously) not a fake. I just started the torrent (it's now about 12 hours after it was posted) and my download is up to 2 MB/sec (and completed in about 4 minutes).
,saphio,2011-08-03T20:59Z,"no, not fake
and its fast as well!"
,moryak23,2011-08-04T06:31Z,fake!!!
,missworld,2011-08-04T13:38Z,"A 10 v 10

Don't know what you are all crying about, it's a perfect copy, downloaded in 5 mins and so what if it is a .rar. You shouldn't be on here if you don't know how to unpack it, takes about 30 seconds you dumbass.

Thanks Scenebalance :)"
,LinShark11,2011-08-07T12:51Z,"You can play rar files with vlc without unpacking, so it doesn't matter.."
