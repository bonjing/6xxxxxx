,Uriz3n,2011-07-30T07:31Z,"Thanks as always... I feel kinda greedy, but I'd have a humble request (several, actually):

First, I am looking for the works of Humberto Ramos and some of Carlos Meglia's and Francisco Herrera's work with him. 
Specifically from Ramos: Crimson, Out There, Spectacular Spiderman, Revelations;
Herrera: Kamikaze, Soulfire: New World Order, 
Meglia: Star Wars: Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika;

I'm also looking for a collected Wolverine: Enemy of the State by Millar and Romita Jr.

And, lastly, for collected story-lines in general, like X-Men Messiah Complex and the following X-Men events, Hulk (by Loeb), War of the Hulks (or was that World War Hulks?). I'd also love to get my hands on a collected one-file Freak Angels by Warren Ellis (for those who don't know that, it's a FREE weekly web-comic, check at www.freakangels.com).

Yeah, I know... Just... asking and hoping. Keep up the good work. All you guys. "
