Resurrection Volume 2 #00-13 [ONI Press]

After years of conflict, the aliens are gone and the planet is safe... or is it? 
Who ended the war? How did they do it? Where do we go from here? These are the 
questions the survivors of this decimation have to ask themselves. Resurrection 
explores both the strife and hope embodied in the last vestiges of humanity.
