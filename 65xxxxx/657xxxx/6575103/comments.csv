[T],insinuendo,2011-08-07T16:48Z,"I've seeded this 12 times over...

If peers are assholes, not my problem :)"

,CakeMonster,2011-08-19T05:43Z,"You need to seed untill there are several other people seeding, that you seeded 12 or 120 times over does not matter what matters is how many other people also start seeding"
,CakeMonster,2011-08-20T08:10Z,So are you going to seed or do I need to find another torrent to download?
