Plot:
After King Naresuan (Wanchana Sawasdee) renounced Ayutthayaâ€™s allegiance to the Burmese kingdom of Pegu and led an exodus of hostaged Siamese home, Burmese King Nanda Bayin (Jakrit Amarat) launched a series of attacks to punish the Thai kingdom as a recalcitrant vassal state. Faced with espionage and impending invasions from multiple directions, King Naresuan engages in political and military alliances and exercises his mastery of the arts of war to successfully defend his kingdomâ€™s sovereignty from foreign rule.
