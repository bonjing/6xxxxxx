uTorrent
PeerBlock
Mediacom ISP

I used to be on WOW ISP. Never a problem in years. I been on Mediacom for two months. Also I use NLUPPER002 several times before (not blaming)

I will say I was probably a bit naive opening uTorrent before getting PeerBlock open, though I did so a few seconds later. I've have my times though in the past where I noticed it wasn't on. But this my first time getting a notice."

At my new location (I moved) I am no longer using m0n0wall. I would use that to block everything incoming from my cable box, open only torrents, and block frequent things that showed up in PeerBlock."
