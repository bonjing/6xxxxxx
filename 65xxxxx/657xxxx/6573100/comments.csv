after going through your comments i would just say that you  are one  hell of a great great and great bastards ... ooopss!! sorry !!!
rather you were born to the mother who just had the intercourse with the filthiest of pigs, the rotten itichiest dogs and hungry haynas  before giving birth to you fucking retard! .... yeah you proved it just now.....
i wish i could have uttered the same foul words as you did but ....
MOSES and JESUS were the noblemen and true messengers of Allah and we as muslims love,adore and respect them... i cant dare to say such words and above all PROPHET MOHAMMAD was the LAST prophet and messenger of ALLAH....
anyways u shits cant understand all this ...."

So no, Mohammed is not the Holy Spirit like this unbeliever Mohammed boasted.

Important for you is to know that Yeshua is our creator God, our Savior and Lord. The one and only God. You will either receive Him and give you life to Him or you will burn in the lake of fire where Mohammed is going to burn too come judgement day. "
