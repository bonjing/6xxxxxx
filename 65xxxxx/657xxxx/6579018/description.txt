Description, from the Russian forums:
A new plot. [A completely new story, with nothing left in from the old plot]
The main quest is a search for your brother, a stalker in the Zone.
Lots of new characters, new monsters, weapons, and artifacts.
Three new factions: Wanderers, Peacekeepers, and Hunters.
Borov now runs the 100 Rads Bar, and the Bartender is now in Cordon.
Eventually Duty will take control of the Bar, with your help.
Several game endings. The "right" ending will be difficult to achieve.
Four new locations: Dead City, Forest, Swamp, and Peacekeeping Corps.
Transitions between levels, the "secret trails", are unstable. Most trails go one-way, and you will have to work with the quest givers to find other exits. A few "trails" are temporary, so you must complete certain quests before the transition disappears.
