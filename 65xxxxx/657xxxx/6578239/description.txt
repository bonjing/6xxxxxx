Musically, Franz Liszt (1811-1886) is one of the most written about but least understood composers of the 19th century. As for his life-Felix Mendelssohn observed that Liszt's character was ''a continual alternation between scandal and apotheosis.''

''Scandal and apotheosis''? What could that possibly mean? Join music professor Robert Greenberg for these lectures, and go on a fascinating journey in search of the truth about both. ''Franz Liszt, Both Sides Now,'' you might call it.
