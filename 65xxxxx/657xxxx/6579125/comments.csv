,BJLD213,2011-08-03T03:28Z,Oh yeah. And don't forget to seed back (at least 3 times if you like this torrent). 
[T],djjlicious,2011-08-03T03:38Z,"Well you just have to learn how to seed, don;t you!"
,kleftokotas,2011-08-03T04:35Z,I can't believe Geek squad is using this junk!
,BJLD213,2011-08-03T10:21Z,"Lol djjlicious, I seed 3 fold on most things I download. Constantly on things I upload. I put that comment because the file was new and noticed when people got 100% they weren't seeding back."
,Khunjo,2011-08-03T15:52Z,Hmmmm...thats funny Bullshitt..Iam sorry...what you are uploading ...?...lol...btw...greetings from Germany...;)
,SOLDIERX.COM,2011-08-04T06:53Z,"Would like to add that not only is this not cracked (it expires), but it phones home to Geek Squad servers.  If you're going to use it, make sure you disconnect your internet connection first.  I'm also not saying that this ISO is the real MRI 5.5.1 (I have no need to download it).  Just warning everybody that an uncracked version of 5.5.1 does phone home."
,BJLD213,2011-08-04T09:01Z,@ SOLDIERX.COM Since this version is what Geek Squad was using just a few days ago I dont see a problem with it expiring right now until a better option is made available (I'm looking at you SoldierX.com). I know you guys have the cracked version on your site for VIP members only (Where's the information insemination there :D). Or maybe someone that downloads my uncracked version can crack it. Your comment and advice are appreciated and I like your site SoldierX.com btw.
,maxstarr,2011-08-04T09:51Z,I would just like to say that when I put this on my computer it made no attempt to dial home. I monitor my  network access both ways like that.
,j0kawi1d,2011-08-04T19:31Z,Soldierx is not lying. It will phone home. Doesn't matter how much you monitor your network the gs version will phone home and once that happens bestbuys lawyers will be all over you. Trust me they don't mess around. And like Soldierx said it might not even be an untouched version. Most mri versions other than Soldierx ones have been known to carry Trojans. So be aware! This is not safe!
,tangoseal,2011-08-04T22:11Z,"Today I tried it without disconnecting internet and it told me that this version is no longer valid an to get a new one. Anyone know how to get past when it calls home to and tells you that this version is no longer good? 

Thanks."
,j0kawi1d,2011-08-04T22:59Z,There is no easy bypass. You need to crack it down to the core since Bestbuy has watermarked each and every mri cd to a specific gs precinct. Unless you can do all that I would stay away from this copy.
,ADNC,2011-08-05T18:12Z,"Worked fine yesterday when DL, now it dosen't....dead"
,j0kawi1d,2011-08-06T03:34Z,Yeah that's the expiring time bomb that comes embedded in the gs version.
,laracroftisme,2011-08-11T11:28Z,"Used to work for GS, everyone used MRI disc everywhere..never heard a word about lawyers or any of that."
,j0kawi1d,2011-08-23T20:53Z,Trust me gs knows everytime the disc gets used. A phone home function embedded into the core of the program pings back to its server and delivers ip information in order to keep the mri program from being leaked and used by unauthorized agents.
,yungn,2011-09-05T18:56Z,thx for the upload man works great. I worked @ GS for about 2 years -- just make sure ur OFFLINE-- MRI downlaods virus definitions and CALLS gs to deactivate mri prematurely. Every version of MRI expires eventually. @SoldierX care to elaborate on your alliance with GS.
,yungn,2011-09-05T18:58Z,"thx for the upload man works great. I worked @ GS for about 2 years, GS does not have enough resource to go after everyone that uses its software -- just make sure ur OFFLINE-- MRI downlaods virus definitions and CALLS gs to deactivate mri prematurely. Every version of MRI expires eventually. @SoldierX care to elaborate on your alliance with GS."
,ChiliBeef,2011-09-14T17:24Z,"Works great.  Used to work for GS a year ago; everyone who said they don't have resources to bother you are correct.  BTW, if it says ""Version Expired"", just change the date. ;)"
,devilpup,2011-10-07T06:30Z,The ping alert is kind of useless anyway.  Agents use the disks on every clients computer even if they are not checked in.  I've personally used the program 100's of times off the clock when I worked as an agent and still use the program today.  Just be careful of what you're doing when you use it.  It can be very easy to reformat your harddrive or burn out a GPU using this program.  Make friends or pay an agent for advice if you need help. 
,camster98,2011-10-19T21:25Z,Yall are all stupid as hell. First off mri is used in store and on-site repairs. So this phone home deal involving laywers going to sue you is bull. How can bestbuy know that it isent one of there agents. i dont belive every time an agent uses mri they call in and give best buy your ip. They have no idea which connection to there servers is authorized or not. Nobodys going to get sues over using mri. also i dont think geek squad gives a crap anymore since they are always leaving there cd's in the drive
,SOLDIERX.COM,2011-10-25T20:42Z,"@yungn - We do not have any alliance with geek squad.  As the only group that has ever cracked MRI, we have clearly been a thorn in their side.

@camster98 - Companies have been sued for using MRI.  If you use it from your IP once will you get sued - of course not.  You are correct that they do not call in and give IPs when they are running MRI at a client site.  The thing you are forgetting about is that if you continue to use MRI over and over from a single IP then their logging server will show an ""unusual"" amount of MRI use from your IP.  I don't know what the magic number is, but at some point they do take legal action to recoup losses.  So will you be sued if you use it to fix a few computers around the house - not likely.  Will you be sued if you use it to run a computer repair business - of course!

Contact MRI@GeekSquad.com for questions. :-P"
,MystikInc,2012-01-07T20:34Z,"I can verify that this program 'checks in' - I did some packet analysis, even pointing the FQDN to a dud IP locally, where I setup my own box and dummy HTTP server, turns out, the program tries to check in with ""ping.geeksquadcentral.com"" - the request is: GET /tracker.php?mode=ping&pname=MRI&pver=5.5.1&key=5fe7a93d6df4f26357be68565522ab3f&pingtype=1&reportmode=bool HTTP/1.1

I assume the request is the same every time, since it would only be sending a saved certificate keystring.  no idea.  either way, the EXE appears to either be signed, or encrypted somehow.  I'm going to have to do more work on it to try and figure all that out. either way, user beware."
,its_late,2012-03-14T05:59Z,"FYI, if the program expires just change your bios date a couple months ahead. and everything should work. Dont forget to change it back!"
