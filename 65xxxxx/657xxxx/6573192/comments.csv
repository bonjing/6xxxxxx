,shonangc,2012-05-20T03:41Z,"The audio is Hindi. The subtitles are .srt English.
The video is medium quality with some slight interlacing artifacts.
There is an audio delay of one-half second (500ms) at the spot I was checking. It appears to be about the same throughout . . . 
VLC Media Player is free and open source and will show the .srt subtitles.
The ""j"" and ""k"" keys alter the audio delay. Hit the keys till you get -500ms and all is fine, though I am not certain the audio does not drift. It does seem manageable . . ."
