,kewrel,2011-08-01T06:43Z,I'm seeding this on my 10/10 connection as long as necessary!
,svart.se,2011-08-02T02:10Z,WOW!  Thanks for the PS3 compatible torrent!  Much appreciated.
,kewrel,2011-08-02T06:56Z,"Season 16 is now up as well!

,Denver542,2011-08-02T09:28Z,Cant download. It says something about problems with connecting to tracker. Anyone know what to do about it?
,kewrel,2011-08-02T10:05Z,"Sounds like a network problem on your end. I would guess it has something to do with some firewall or router setting, or something else. All I know is, the tracker IS working."

,gmmaharaj,2011-08-06T22:37Z,I am also getting the same error not able to find trackers. Can you please check if something is wrong?
,kewrel,2011-08-08T13:05Z,I'm trying to tell you to add a few other trackers that I've added to my seed but this stupid comment system won't let me post those adresses :P
,kewrel,2011-08-08T13:18Z,"Try adding the trackers in this link:

Had to split the link up in 3 rows, otherwise it wouldn't let me post it :P"
,map2photo,2011-08-11T21:50Z,"AWESOME! Thank you, I love this show!"
,VORONGM,2011-08-17T14:06Z,Thanks! Seed guys!
,luminatx,2011-08-20T09:11Z,wow only 6 episodes a season? that sucks when other shitty shows get like 24 episodes.
,scothuman,2011-08-22T17:37Z,"@luminatix:  There are 2 seasons per year, and they average 8 episodes per season.  So typically you're getting 16 episodes per year.  Now, that's not 24, clearly, but it's also not as bad as you seem to think."
,coolspades2001,2011-08-24T19:42Z,"By any chance, Do u have more trackers?!? I'm only downloading at 0.5 kb/s"
,coolspades2001,2011-08-24T19:50Z,"ok, just added the trackers from that link... went up from 0.5 ---> ~20kb/s thnx, keep up the great work!!!"
,kewrel,2011-08-27T05:31Z,"Slow download speed is not a tracker problem, it's a problem with your connection. Something, hardware or software, is making it difficult for others to connect to you. Most likely some kind of firewall.

For example, if there are 1000 peers, and you're only able to connect to like 5% of them because of some firewall problem, you're far less likely to find any peers with good upload speeds."
,superdx,2011-09-15T00:21Z,Anyone notice that the audio sounds a bit muffled? It's like it's coming through a tin can
,deadalex1992,2011-09-16T21:48Z,great upload!!! thanx a lot!!!
,yotomyo,2011-09-19T05:13Z,I am only here for the first episode - with Alice Cooper 
,ebud,2011-09-30T00:05Z,"he, now it's pretty fast, though i never get higher speeds than 1Mb/s (my Internet connection is 8Mb/sDL-1Mb/sUL; capped at 50G.TOTAL)... 
what about you, other peers, still slow? Plz give feedback!
(p.s.: i fully authorised coms for my torrent client through my Firewall. Do you think that's ok to do so?... i know that since then, my speed improved greatly.)"
,ebud,2011-09-30T00:07Z,"Yo, now its pretty fast, though i never get higher speeds than 1Mb/s (my Internet connection is 8Mb/sDL - 1Mb/sUL)... 
what about you, other peers, still slow? Plz give feedback!
(p.s.: i fully authorised coms for my torrent client through my Firewall. Do you think that's ok to do so?... i know that since then, my speed improved greatly, though still lil'lower 1Mb/s.)"
,r083r73h,2011-10-02T16:03Z,"@superdx

Yup! Sound is not good. Something is wrong."
,hachibill,2011-10-08T03:32Z,"video was off, kept freezing and skipping."
,Nabbdjuret1337,2011-10-21T23:42Z,"Great torrent, love top gear! :)"
,r083r73h,2011-10-28T17:23Z,I fixed problems with the sound. It turned out that the sound on the left channel was lower than the right. Adjusted the settings in Media Player Classic. Now the audio is smooth.
,Adrastos34,2011-11-07T04:23Z,"The video is fine but the audio isn't that good. The left channel is stronger then the right or rather the right channel is muffled. There is also a slight click or tick noise that happens in the right channel. Thank you for the torrent and I appreciate your time but going to have to find another one instead. (Tried in Quicktime, VLC and Divx so I don't think the problem is on my end but if it is I am sorry and disregard what I have said)"
,Sonicblade008,2012-05-04T07:00Z,Can you please upload series 18 complete??
