I personally allowed my membership to expire because of the slow nature in which they added new content. If they rectify that aspect of the site and you're into this sort of thing then the site has the potential to be great. The animated videos of the characters are quite well rendered and aren't as generic as far as repetitive motions and expressions as you get with most other similar 3d cg animations.
