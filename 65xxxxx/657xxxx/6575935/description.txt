Praise be to Allah. We praise Him, seek His Help, and ask his Forgiveness. We seek
refuge in Allah from the evil of our souls and the evil of our deeds. Whomever Allah guides, there is no one to mislead him. And whomever He misleads, there will be no guide for him.


The Title: The Call for the Unity of Religions: A False and Dangerous Call
Format: PDF
Language: English
Formation : Dr. Saleh As-Saleh

Short Description: Dr. Saleh As-Saleh said in the beginning of the book, \"We hear nowadays a strange call by organized groups involving some Christians, Jews, and â€œMuslimâ€ intellectuals calling for â€œwihdatul adyaanâ€. They claim that these three religions stand for the same belief that there is One God and should unite in their call for the implementation of great moral values. Some of those involved call for the establishment of centers containing churches, synagogues, and masaajid side by side, and printing the Qurâ€™an, the Bible, and the Torah in one binding, etc. In the name of defending Islam against political and media distortions in the West, some organizations are compromising the basics of the Islamic creed through what is called â€œBridging the Faiths.â€ This is a very dangerous call because it mixes the truth with falsehood and thus practically implies the elimination of the truth perfected in the deen of Islam. The Christians and Jews want the Muslims to be like them. That is why they support this deceptive call for â€œunityâ€.
