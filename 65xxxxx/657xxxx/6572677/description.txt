Little Richard Black Diamond Live in Boston - 1970
Released:1998
Label: Fireball Records
Format: Mp3@320


This album represents the best audio documentation of LR's most under-reported and most amazing period in his career, with the exception of the '55 to '58 cataclysm: he made very few records from '68 to '70, his most intense "Comeback" period, when his voice was never stronger. (This was Comeback #2). Although the title says "Mad Russian" in '70, the contents are actually from that venue in 1968  & from "The Boston Tea Party" in 1970
