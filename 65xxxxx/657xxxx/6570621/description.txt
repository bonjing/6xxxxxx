Kiss of the Spider Woman (Spanish: El beso de la mujer araÃ±a) is a novel by the Argentine writer Manuel Puig. It is considered his most successful.

The novel's form is unusual in that there is no traditional narrative voice, one of the primary features of fiction. It is written in large part as dialogue, without any indication of who is speaking, except for a dash (-) to show a change of speaker. There are also parts of stream of consciousness. What is not written as dialogue or stream of consciousness is written as metafictional government documentation. The conversations between the characters, when not focused on the moment at hand, are recountings of films that Molina has seen, which act as a form of escape from their environment. Thus there are a main plot, several subplots, and five additional stories that comprise the novel.

Kiss of the Spider Woman (Portuguese: O Beijo da Mulher Aranha) is a 1985 Brazilian-American drama film. It was directed by Argentine-born Brazilian director HÃ©ctor Babenco, and adapted by Leonard Schrader from the Manuel Puig novel of the same name. William Hurt, RaÃºl JuliÃ¡, Sonia Braga, Jose Lewgoy, and Milton Goncalves star in the leading roles.
