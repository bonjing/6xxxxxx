,Erik_O,2011-10-04T20:49Z,does this work on 64-bit windows too?
,Buc28,2011-10-25T14:47Z,"When I had this cracked the first time and then tried updating, the update couldn't be applied because it couldn't find the installation directory. So I uninstalled it and tried running the new setup file, but it said my trial expired. The license must be in an invisible registry key. Does anyone know how to remove it so I can activate the trial and apply the crack again? Turning back by clock didn't work. Thanks for any help."

No, this is a 32bit application and won't install on 64 bit Windows.
Shame!"
