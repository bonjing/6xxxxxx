,y3n007,2011-08-08T00:41Z,Steve Austin movie hu? it is probably a real stinker but I am gonna give it a shot......
,thorwahl,2011-08-09T02:06Z,"It's so horribly bad the actors and anyone who was even remotely involved in the making of the movie should be crucified (tied, not nailed).
The first 5 minutes of the movie set the tone of what will be 90 minutes of utter complete horribleness. SWAT-guys carrying around memento-BB guns, taking on bad guys with beef jerky instead of the guns theyre carrying, horrible puns...... UUUUUUUUGH"
,scottsasse,2011-08-09T02:46Z,This movie is only believable because cops are really that stupid!!
,y3n007,2011-08-09T09:42Z,"and I was right, this movie is a piece of crap.....you figure at least the ex WWE dudes would be able to act, I mean they had plenty of training while in the WWE, but nope, who ever produced this piece of crap should be shot on sight......what a waste of time....but then again I had nothing else to watch so I guess it served it's purpose, kill time.......never again I will delete this crap right now before it fs up my PC......."
,thorwahl,2011-08-09T12:15Z,Its honestly kind of unbelievable that this movie is as bad as it actually is. Its like it was made by a group of 15-year olds as a school project.
