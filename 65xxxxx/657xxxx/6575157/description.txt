We can teach you everything about how to interview well. Most likely you will take our advice to heart, but you will build upon the mistakes you currently make without removing them first. The best way to optimize your interviewing abilities is to strip away everything that youâ€™re doing wrong first. Get rid of all the excess wording that you put in your stories and the unnecessary â€œLikesâ€ and â€œUmmsâ€ in your speech. Completely rebuild your interviewing from scratch, using our strategies and tips as building blocks to create the best possible interview you can give. 

The following are the 10 biggest mistakes that students and young professionals make throughout their recruitment process. Honestly critique yourself; donâ€™t just say, â€œWell thatâ€™s obvious. Thereâ€™s no way that I do that.â€ Reach out to a friend and ask her to mock interview you and give you her honest feedback. Youâ€™ll be surprised at the number of insecure or nervous things that you do while you interview that you wonâ€™t even notice until someone points them out to you. Avoid these mistakes and youâ€™ll have a huge advantage over your competition. Strip your interviewing abilities from these mistakes and youâ€™ll be able to construct the perfect interview. Enjoy!
