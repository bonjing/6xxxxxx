Frantic.1988.MULTISUB.RETAIL.DVDR.PAL-BOOMI

Storyline
A doctor and his wife go to Paris for a medical conference. While showering, his wife disappears. His lack of language, and the odd way she disappeared makes it nearly impossible for him to find any official help in his search as he enters the punk/drug culture to find out what has happened to her.
