,BioAcid,2011-07-30T06:38Z,"I couldn't see it writen in the section, however is it cut off like the other ones that had hard coded subs ?  Just wanted to ask prior to dl'ing."
,ecchiless,2011-07-30T06:55Z,"@bioacid

read again man; Uploader Note: It's pretty late to join into 1 file and make a maxspeed encode (also personal low bandwidth
at this hour) so i will go again with original scene release 2 part cd's shared via seedbox, also
pretty bad movie...this version doesn't have any foreign hardcoded subtitle or cropped areas as
hdrip versions released about 1 week ago (korean hardcoded subs or cropped parts)"

@rsl87... Try using ConvertXToDVD to burn your disc, you'll probably find that there'll be no sync problems when you come to play the movie through your PS3..."
,karlocool,2011-07-30T23:11Z,Thanks again for an other great movie :)
,Dribble21,2011-07-30T23:58Z,"Not widescreen (like the one with korean subs) 

The Pay Per View (full screen) has way more Audio parts (Is an early cut of the movie) 

After Kirsten stabs Anna Paquin she says- It's your own fault! (not in dvd version)

When Kirby, Jill & Olivia drive away from the house Olivia says: The problem with Trevor is he never quits! (not in dvd version)

Someone who can combine the audio from PPV version with the dvd version please???? "

,arielmercoledi,2011-08-01T23:04Z,"oh THANK YOU.  finally a dvd rip.  i went to scre4m on opening night in april & since then have searched literally every day for a good copy.  and it's finally here!  i can hardly believe it's real, but it is!  thank you thank you thank you.

long live black comedy slasher horror!

make sure to pay for a copy as soon as we can, without our support they might not be able to make 5cream & s6ream!"
,arielmercoledi,2011-08-02T03:21Z,thank you again!  once more.  thanks.
,tai69,2011-08-02T21:56Z,This isn't a DVD Rip people. The DVD won't be released until October 4 in America and August 8th in the UK. This is TS - it is the same crappy TS that had hard coded Korean subs - extreme zone just chopped them.

,andresparra,2011-08-03T19:56Z,I confirm audio out of sync on ps3. I'll watch it in the PC. Thanks extremezone!!!
,Sora1984,2011-08-07T04:48Z,sweet rip watched the 1st file whilst the 2nd was downloading :)
,arielmercoledi,2011-08-07T16:38Z,"@tai69

this is not a telesync.

your proof that this is a not a dvdrip seems to be ""the dvd has not come out for legal public consumption yet"" -- obviously, this does not constitute a logical citation of evidence.

by no means is this copy 10/10:a/v, but neither was the copy played in the theatre opening night in april on the ""giant screen"" (they gave us an imax theatre & just blew up the picture - you had to be a hardcore fan to find out that it was playing on a second screen & the regular one had already sold out).

& this copy is totally acceptable, compact, etc, & we can rewind when we laugh too hard to hear the next line, or when we just need to see one of the proper grindhouse slasher moments twice!

so @extremezone thank you again.  the only criticism i can offer is that i'm annoyed at the film being broken into two files.  however, i get the feeling that you have some reason, of which i'm not thinking, for doing this (i'd love if someone could explain it to me).

& at everyone else: please, please, please download & watch this amazing film.  if you're one of those who love it, show it to others & try your damnedest to show them why you / how to love it also.

and PLEASE remember to pay for a copy as soon as it is possible to do so.

with grim & bloody sincerity,
- ariel"

,nstalr2,2011-08-14T07:06Z,"I'm not quite sure why everyone complains about 2 part rips. Just create a playlist within media player and it plays seamlessly....at least for me. And if you burn it to a dvd just add both parts and voila!
Thanx extremezone!!!"
,JadeyGal,2011-08-20T18:26Z,"The reason why this movie is split into 2 files is because of scene rules nothing else. 

If you don't like having to open the other file to watch it @DirtyMurd don't download it in the first place you lazy git. Also there is better scene release from EXViD which is a BDRip just look for it on TPB (ps it's also widescreen)."
,DarkVOX,2011-08-22T04:01Z,I think the 2 file thing is kinda smart.  We can get the first part downloaded first and watch it while the second part finishes downloading.  It saves you having to wait so long to watch the entire movie.

[T],Pongydog,2011-09-17T17:52Z,"This is not in the correct widescreen ratio.

Should be in 2.35 cinemascope, but this is in 1.85 image has been cropped at the sides."
,Lassik,2011-09-30T01:08Z,"Why would splitting movies in to 2 files be a scene rule? Did a retard infiltrate the scene and start putting rules in to place. 

I'm sorry but splitting a movie in to 2 files is in no way a good idea. Bearable? Yes. Convenient and practical? Not in the slightest.

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the time and effort but when given the choice, i don't know anyone who would chose 2 files over 1. Unless they have a little retard in them as well. :-)

Thank you extremezone, love the effort and appreciate all you put out to the scene but i'll pass and go with another torrent."

,Government10,2011-10-15T06:28Z,"Easy fix to the two files being separate....

Either combine the two in a video editing software, and export them...

OR,  if you had a brain,  you could make a playlist,  and they both flow together seamlessly.  Half you kids should have learned that years ago."
,hdogg007,2011-10-17T17:20Z,+1 for audio out of sync on PS3.  
,masterchief28,2011-10-17T22:28Z,"Ok, all the people complaining about the movie being split into two parts.  The REAL reason it's done like this is so that you can fit the movie on a 700MB CD.  They've done movies like that for years.  Of course, people want higher quality movies now, so extremezone has doubled the video size, but still made it possible to fit the movie on standard sized CDs."
