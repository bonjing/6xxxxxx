Postbox, the true alternative to the native emails apps, just got a facelift and I mean a facelift.  This upgrade to version 2.5.1 is no minor tweaking here and there but more like an overhaul to its UI.

New features includes -

Fast 64-bit Support for Mac OS X â€“ On the Mac, Postbox 2.5 is now running in 64-bit mode, which translates to faster startup, snappier interface elements, and quicker message loading.

Vertical Thread Pane View â€“ Postbox now supports a double-row Vertical Thread Pane View, which makes more efficient use of widescreen displays.

- Improved Vertical view
- Improved compose window
- Inline quick reply
- Enhanced font size controls
- Improved message view
- Improved unread indicators in folder and focus pane
