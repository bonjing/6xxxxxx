First of all, I've scanned this thing before extracting and after exctracting (with Avast). There is no virus.

Unfortunately though, I can't get it to work for me. I've set my resolution to 1280X1024 as recommended. I've followed the instructions in the unl-2011.info file. When I double click on Limbo.exe and after a few seconds of the hourglass on my cursor, it does nothing.

I've extracted the files to C:\Program Files (x86)\Limbo (if that matters, which I don't think it does).

I've tried the Launcher.exe and it asks me what language but after I press ""Save and Launch"" it does the same thing, which is nothing!

Both exes run in my Task Manager under Processes for a few minutes (at about 5400k memory usage) but nothing on the Applications tab. After a few minutes it disappears from Processes.

I used this version and it showed a self renaming trojan called install.exe while running the game, killed the process and came back with install1.exe , install2.exe etc etc.

,deltix1,2011-08-11T19:38Z,"Ok done cleaning up my pc, again warning you folks the uploader probably does not know this him self, so i do not want to point any fingers to any one here.
I installed this program and all my folders where changed and showed up as shortcuts, if you look in the folder it self it starts up a cmd screen undetected links to a program in the recylcler bin (hidden) and starts up explorer with more options in there.
In short this one uses a autorun.inf file and creates a back door on your pc and i had to remove 3 programs in order to get everything working again.
Again folks i have been tackling these stupid backdoors for a couple of yours now at my work, and some one is just playing stupid here in order to make us believe this is a false possitive message, or telling you it trusted.
As a IT specialist (MCP)my self i know what the hell i'm talking about, and this is also for me the first time some one uses this trick to spead backdoors arround.
No matter what some one tels you here, all who followed up their addvice(they probably don't know it them selve) are infected.
So in short some tips here 
Check you drives including external usb drivers and sticks.
Check if you folders are not showing up as shortcuts, if it does you are infected.
Check in your task manager running processes
you have 2 explorers.exe running, you are infected.
Go to configuration folder options/view tab unmark Hide empty drives, hide extensions for... , Hide proctected oprating ... and mark show hidden files and ....
Go to you original hidden folder now called recycler bin, if i'm correct you have a (whatevername).exe in there.
This file is started up anytime you open the shortcut folders, and starts running at your task screen undetected.
check settings
In your shortcuts properties/target points to a runs cmd /s point to recycler bin exe file and opens also a sepperate explorer.exe task unseen no popups.

This bloody thing has a troyan (100%), and took 1 hour to clean up my pc and my 10 terra hd's.

What you do whith it is up to you.
I just give you advice here, and no i do not give you wrong advice here, just check what i told you and you wil be supprised
Last tup antimalware bytes can kill it for you but you have to remove the file from the hidden recycler bin by hand.

see ya and good luck
Ps don't mind the typos am in a hurry here.

,didii,2011-08-12T03:06Z,Greaaaat torrent! Everything worked fine and game was awesome!
,MrGoy,2011-08-12T21:32Z,"deltix, it is very strange. Some pp say virus, others say harmless virus and others say no virus. You are the only who reported such enormous modifications in your system. What is your operating system? Perhaps the virus was designated only to attack specific targets as Windows 7 to get the serial or other sttuf. I also think that such viruses interest the game's producers and guess what... Some false positives are also PAID positives. Think about it. If a software company pays to put its product in the black list of antivirus programs, the most part of customers, who aren't geeks, just won't get the 'alternative' (nor 'torrented') versions of the software. It is a big deal, isnt it?

See ya."

,dwatson,2011-10-21T13:49Z,"I wish people would realise that hackers started using the term ""false positive"" so that people would just download their keyloggers/spyware anyway. The amount of people who just accept the ""your anti-virus thinks is a virus because you're pirating it"" b.s. is just frightening. this is how hackers expand their botnet, on the gullibility and ignorance of other human beings."
