// A birthday!
Another comet has collided with our planet.  Unclear if it
was bigger than previous one or not, but at least  we  can
count to 4 now.

NOTES

► Our releases are always virus-free. If you think you found
something  suspicious, it's  a  problem  of  your security
software. All those  antivirus systems  will  never be too
smart, so don't complain.  And always remember that we are
not responsible for modified releases.

► We aren't stealing releases. We respect hard work of other
people and always  indicate  original authors of releases.
We have permissions to use their files.

► We are doing all this for fun  and  knowledge only. Always
remember to support the developers if you like the product
and its quality.
