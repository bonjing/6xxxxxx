Is there a reason?"
,logolepsic,2011-08-11T01:36Z,"The reason it is not 90 minutes, is probably because this is the ""John Pinette: Still Hungry"" Comedy Central special from Friday, July 29th, without the DVD extras. The DVD that came out on August 2nd, contains the following extras: Tour of Chicago, Looking For John Pinette, Worst Snowstorm in 1,000 Years, In the Make-Up Chair, Fans, Photoshoot, Number 1 Fan. Again, this torrent is just the show without the extras."
