Min bÃ¤ste vÃ¤n (My best friend) is the seventh solo album by Swedish pop singer and songwriter Marie Fredriksson, her sixth album in Swedish. On the album, Marie Fredriksson gives her own, personal interpretation of the music she grew up with during the 1960s and 1970s.

Fredriksson's comments on the album: These songs here have been my best friends during the important years of my life. When I took my old, scratched long playing records to listen them again, I noticed how great they are. Still great. I began sing songs by myself and I discovered that I longed to sing in Swedish again. The idea of making a record, where I could sing songs of old favourite like John Holm, Pugh Rogefeldt and Hoola Bandoola Band started to grow slowly. Everything had really been improvised a lot. Freedom. Especially when it concerns the song and the arrangement. It is not so polished anymore. This is what songs just need
