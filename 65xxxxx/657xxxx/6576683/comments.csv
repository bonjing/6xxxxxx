People are asking for English subs is a little confusing."
,OxideGF,2011-08-04T18:34Z,"Its English !
The subtitles are little messy at the starting but after reaching the goblin part the subtitles are OK !"
,nightgrl,2011-08-05T18:19Z,"Video quality is very good as for cam..
Thanks a great deal to the uploader.But has anyone else faced a problem in video??
i was watching it in VLC and just where harry tells hemione that Voldy knows about them destroying hecrocraxes..Film got stuck for a while 6-7 seconds..

I've also played it in mp3 but m still facing the same problem..Has anyone else faced it or its just me:-s"
,lee1992,2011-08-07T15:56Z,"this is NOT the full movie, this version is 1 hr 54 mins, the full version is 2hr 10 mins ( not including credits ) there are obvious cuts all over the film , the first is near the beginning , about 2 minutes 20 seconds, when they go to speak to the goblin. 

apart from that , everything else is good, best quality i've seen so far. A 8 V 8"

,aj_dacosta,2011-08-10T03:51Z,ok so i downloaded this and it came up as an ares file and it wont play in vlc or start downlaoding in ares?! how do i get this to play?!
,cheatsforme,2011-08-18T21:31Z,"@aj_dacosta
Ares is a torrent client so you have only downloaded the hash for the file, try utorrent it is by far the best torrent client as it uses minimal cpu but does use some ram, ares however if i remember right uses up a lot of cpu.
As for ares not downloading it i am unsure but have u tried dragging the file into the ares client window? as that was one reason i ditched Ares many years ago."
,DevRocks,2011-08-19T09:45Z,please upload in smaller size!!!!!!!!!!

,TorrentGuy96,2011-08-30T12:22Z,"Why are ALL the torrents for this movie shorter than 2:10? If the credits arent there I couldnt care less about them, but some people are saying that actual movie parts are being cut out, is this true? If so, Why?"
