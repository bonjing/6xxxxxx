,DarthBane6,2011-08-02T06:11Z,"Thanks for the TTOO torrents, I was wondering if you happened to have the first series of Dylans training back when it was under the direction of James Mogul?"
,chaostastic,2012-01-17T11:36Z,"DarthBane6, I have at least TTOO 5723 Dylan day 1 and TTOO 5724 Dylan day 2. It's not the same as what Merzedes uploaded in 2009, of which all lack seeders as of now, as they are from defunct empornium. I have some older TTOO offline so I will look for day 3 and day 4 there.
Unless someone beat me to it I will post within 48 hours. Apologies for late response."
