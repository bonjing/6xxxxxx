Anything odd, lost or f*cked up that anybody is happy to share, especially Blue Underground, Mondo Macabre, Shriek 
Show and of course, Something Weird Video. Also anything that fell foul of the 1984 U.K VRA and just vanished 
without a trace, so basically any Pre Cert stuff  :D

I'm also short of a few of the official U.K "Video Nasties". If anybody has some or a complete set and is willing 
to post a few, please get in touch  :)
