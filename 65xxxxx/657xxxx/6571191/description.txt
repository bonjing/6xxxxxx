Then during 2002, he meets with aspiring model, Radhika, who is also attracted to him, and both move-in to live together in a small apartment in Mumbai. When he gets the opportunity to settle in Sydney, Australia, he dumps her and re-locates there. Now it is 2006, and Raj has met a brilliant taxi-driver, Gayatri, who he falls in love with. The question remains, will his attraction again be temporary? And what will be the consequences if Gayatri finds out about his past?
