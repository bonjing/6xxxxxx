Cosmology has been sexy since Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman, and Stephen Hawking stormed onto the scene three decades ago, popularizing science for the masses. In The Black Hole War, Susskind plays on our insatiable appetite for the gee-whiz moment, combining lucid explanations for some complex ideas with stories that tend to confirm the eccentricities of the highly intelligent. In fact, itâ€™s the authorâ€™s knack for teaching and his conversational prose that make the book accessible and therefore appealing to a wide audience. And, of course, itâ€™s never a bad idea to drop Hawkingâ€™s name in a bookâ€™s title. â€œSusskind explains this dizzying notion about as clearly as is probably possible,â€ George Johnson writes of the authorâ€™s theoryâ€”even if, in the end, we need â€œa lot more dataâ€ (New York Times Book Review).
