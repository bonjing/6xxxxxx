It was a long time coming, but finally the crew of the Red Dwarf were reunited for what could
be the last time with Back To Earth. And it proved to be a bit of a mixed blessing..

The idea behind the show is quite ingenious. Back To Earth takes place after the supposed
season ten of Red Dwarf, and the crew find themselves thrown through a portal, whereupon
they realise that theyâ€™re all just characters from a TV show. Furthermore, theyâ€™re characters
from a TV show who are going to all buy it in the final episode. The only solution? To track
down both the actors that play them (including a trip to the Coronation Street set!), and the
creators of Red Dwarf itself.

This opens the door for plenty of postmodern gags and situations, but arguably itâ€™s only when
things get back onto a more comfortable Red Dwarf plain do things start to gel a little more.
And when it works, you canâ€™t help but enjoy the fact that the crew are back together.
