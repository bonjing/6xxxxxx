,splithorizon,2011-08-02T05:15Z,"Also made this account just to thank you mate. Thank you for putting in the time to rip and encode all the F1 races, you do an amazing job."
,gogopobric,2011-08-02T18:12Z,"Scan lines indeed! Jorrell I have enjoyed every 1080 release this year, huge thanks for the torrents; but last week's German GP and this one have encoding issues. I just compared them to earlier releases and they are the only ones with the problem. It's as if they were recorded with a 120Hz or 240Hz TV, giving it that gimmicky soap opera effect which only becomes scan lines once it's an mkv."
,squire02,2011-08-04T00:44Z,how do i get rid of those scan lines?
,bhimungas,2011-08-06T11:46Z,Great job mate! Do you have the canadian grand prix race build up and race? Thanks
