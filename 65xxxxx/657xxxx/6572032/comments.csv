,cowidster,2011-07-31T04:16Z,"Any proof comment please. Is it work? I think the serial will be blocked soon after some little time when we are online, like what was happened to my AVG TuneUp Utilities several weeks ago with serial. Now I use it with crack, not by serial."

,SacTu,2011-07-31T08:54Z,"Doesn't work for me, but maybe that's because I have 64-bit."

,Bean-Bandit,2011-08-01T09:36Z,"I had the same problem with 1 computer with Windows 7 64bit and it wouldn't allow me to install it, some error msg. But I was able to install it on a Windows XP Pro 32 bit with no problems."

,BangoSkank19,2011-09-22T16:13Z,"Works as described, valid until early 2018.

I read some comments before installing, and people were saying how none of the serials worked.  So I used the default serial that was already in place, and installed the trial, without restart.  When the updates had finished, I went to help>activate and used the second serial, THEN restarted, and everything works dandy now.

I was using avast, which I got from tpb, until it recognized itself as an illegal copy.  Don't be surprised if this happens to this and other virus programs you get from here.  

Quality torrent, ty.
