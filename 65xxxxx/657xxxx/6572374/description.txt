Nevada Triangle: Steve Fossett Mystery
When record-breaking aviator Steve Fossett failed to return from a Sunday morning pleasure flight in September 2007, he sparked the biggest peacetime search and rescue operation in the history of the United States. Over the ensuing days and weeks, reports would surface of dozens of other missing airplanes in a huge triangular area of California and Nevada. Some of the planes dated back to the early days of flight, others from the Second World War and even more were uncovered in the restricted zones within the secretive Area 51. These disappearances sparked rumours of a mysterious region, similar to the Bermuda Triangle...now we seek to uncover the truth in Nevada Triangle: Steve Fossett Mystery.
