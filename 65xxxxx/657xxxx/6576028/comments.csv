Really good movie great actors great story audios not bad its synced and you can understand everything except every once in a while theres a vibrating noise but its only for a second. Vidoes good for a cam no blur few people walking around but a little dark at times all in all pretty good cam thanks for the upload Hero_No_1"
,illwrath,2011-08-02T13:08Z,"Damn. Just like the old days, quick."

,baadawg,2011-08-02T16:17Z,Great Rip.. thanks
,spifkitten99,2011-08-02T19:04Z,"Wrong field order. If you don't know what it is, google it. The result is that when there is motion in the picture, it kind of blinks of gives a shadow, because a frame is shown before a frame that it was supposed to be shown after.

I understand why a cam would be skewed, rotated, have bad colors and contrast, be cropped, have bad audio.

But there is no excuse for bad encoding, just like there is no excuse for audio being out of sync. Audio is out of sync in some parts of this video, but so far it's not bad.

It actually looks and sounds decent, but the field order problem ruins it."
,spifkitten99,2011-08-02T19:06Z,"Forgot,

they did a good job fixing the rotation/skew and colors/contrast though.

It's watchable."
,vipernickle99,2011-08-03T04:26Z,thanks hero
,thugking8,2011-08-03T07:37Z,Yeah far better download then that bullshit Imagine posted fuckn bullshit 1kb per sec
,torrecat,2011-08-03T20:35Z,"Is it just m,  or are the cam opperators gettin more stupid, as they get older ?? I meen really uot of focus, squed, So dark yoou can see nothing but the sky if it's outsid and nothing inside but flashes of gun fire.. 
I'm not pickin on any one source. im just sayin they all need to update to an auto focus light filterring cam.  I mean WHY wast the time and critcizam to post the upload if you know it 's shit... 
Whanks for The UL unknown!! You i would expect to understand "
,chrispm84,2011-08-05T07:56Z,"@spifkitten99: A/V/M is more than suffice. No one needs to know (or really cares for that matter) that you know what ""wrong field order"" is. Remember, next time just A/V/M.

@thugking8: It's not Imagine's fault that your download was slow. It was probably too many leechers vs. seeders/peers. If that wasn't the issue, then it was most likely something on your end. Imagine's had some good uploads, but be so bitchy because one goes slow.

@Torrecat: Wow... I didn't know you were SOOO much better at it then everyone else. Let me know when you upload yours. I'm anxiously awaiting! *sarcasm*

Thanks for the up, Hero_No_1. I'm sure it'll be very watchable, as most of your ups are."
,JuiWasHere,2011-08-05T15:23Z,"To anyone who doesn't live near a cinema, these cam copies are incredibly hard to get now.  All the cinemas over here have night vision security cameras, so its not like the good old days.  Thanks to all those people who take the chance so we can watch.  (I know I'm way too chicken)"
,Xthlon,2011-08-06T10:26Z,"+1 @ chrispm84

looking forward to the dvd Rips =D"
,dawgy62,2011-08-06T15:49Z,"Gratitude to Hero No 1, critiques please you got no skulls guys.


Wont b long your skulll will be green. Thanks"
,xSumonax,2011-08-06T20:41Z,"Uuuuuu can't wait I'm so excited! :3

Thank you Mr. Hero ;3 "
,dawgy62,2011-08-08T14:23Z,"Nice work

A=6-7
V=6

Dark in places but u can adjust with VLC
Out a sync just adjust with VLC

Overall not a bad watch and thats on big screen. You can be picky if u want but thats being a prat since its out pretty early. Hero No.1 if its your work, then he needs his skull upped to the next grade.

Good job.

Again the the critics have no skulls so be polite and give the man his dues"
,nevermask7,2011-08-09T06:32Z,"Not to b*tch or anything, but this cam is terrible quality.  Audio is off-sync, and video quality is bad. Post-edited video quality is bad too, VLC Media Player can usually fix that stuff.  Can't fix this one.  Seen much better torrents/cam-vids"
,felesar2,2011-08-14T01:08Z,in VLC press the J button on your keyboard until it's about -400. That sets the audio pretty close to perfect.
,turbowang,2011-08-15T12:44Z,"Big Brother watching this torrent - even with my PeerBlock on, I got a notice of Copyright Infringement letter from Comcast..."
,foufoune23,2011-08-16T18:17Z,"V, A and M= 7 

very watchable, good work dude! Thx for the effort!

Folks, use VLC and press K not J, to get 400ms audio delay, not advance.

if you like beef and bacon, you'll like cowboys and aliens, I just miss zombies and strippers to make it perfect :))

,debedebe,2011-10-05T17:44Z,Really bad quality. The colors are so gray. I'll wait for a better version. Don't wanna ruin a movie experience.
,woldo44,2011-10-30T20:44Z,good copy hero cheers 
,oddgirl8,2011-11-06T12:14Z,I wish that dickheads pointing us to their dumb movie website would FOAD. If there was a decent copy it would be on here for download.
