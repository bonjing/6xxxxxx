,Stinky86,2011-07-30T05:21Z,Looks like this is going to be an awesome collection!  Hope it has some the books I can't find.  :)
,toabajapr,2011-07-30T06:09Z,"Man this is a very old collection!! If u don't have any ebooks, download it is a starting point, but if u do have a collection with books older than the 2004, then this one is not up to date."

Why is it always those who never contribute any torrents who always complain about everything?

If this torrent is not to your liking then upload your own!"
,k.droog,2011-08-17T09:58Z,"This has been around already as 'SF Fantasy Library'. Files date 2007, lots with headers and footers. Renaming it doesn't make it better or newer."
,TienShen,2011-08-21T12:45Z,"Massive, but its a lame many of the Rars of many authos actually have only very few of their works... SO, dont believe there are all the works if you only see the authors name... mostly. Maybe you have more luck.  BUT its  (literally) a big upload. TNKS. And YES, pick up only the files you want before start downloading"

I'm not complaining all I did was to point out that is a good for a starting ebook collection.  Because this collection has been post with differents names and no description of what it has in it.  So hey all is good if you have nothing great if u already have a collection this one is not up to date.  And I say it againg is a great starting point for a collection.  So thank you for the post!!!!! "
