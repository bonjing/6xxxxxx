Nice job joeshuit!"
,keepeas,2011-08-08T01:05Z,"Just wondering...
Is there a Hub logo watermark on these?"
,joeschuit,2011-08-08T12:04Z,"Thanks for the kind words, and yes the hub watermark is sporatic throughout the episodes.  Thank you for seeding"
,Holi,2011-09-19T01:13Z,These are only qHD (960*540) thus the smaller size... You have been warned if you care about the resolution
,beatyou,2011-10-02T00:34Z,"Holi is a retard, these episodes are 1920 x 1080
