Pretty good for a cam, but my ISP forwarded to me a 'cease and desist' letter(email) they received because of this torrent.

It doesn't mean anything will happened to you, I get those almost monthly, or that you'll even get the letter yourself. But just letting you all know. Swarm 'tapped'.

A copy of the goddam letter(without my IP):

Sound drops out a bit in a few places , but the movie: 10

Similar to No Strings Attached.

Thanks for the upload.

Peerblock! no infringements!"
