NOTES: A dirty auld pal dvd that needed loads of work. Video was grainy, blocky, dirty, faded and interlaced. Audio had a seriouse hiss and was severly dull and quiet, like an auld casset tape played through a dirty player.

Work done:

Video: Resized down to 640x480 resolution and kept the origional aspect ratio. Filtered out most of that grain n crap. Gave it an overall sharpen. Deinterlaced and boosted saturation jst a little to compensate for the overall faded look.

Audio: Decompressed the ac3 to wav. Filtered out the excess hiss. Ramped the high end up an awful lot to correct and improve. Increased bass slightly and added stereo widening. Rebalenced volume. Re-encoded back to ac3, origional settings.

End result on this is very nice.
