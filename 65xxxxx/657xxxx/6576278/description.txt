The Tages formed in Sweden in the early 60's as a skiffle group, but soon changed their sound after hearing the Mersey sound. Though their sound was very Anglo-philic, they never really made it in England (or America, of course), despite support from Ray Davies of the Kinks, and Roger Daltrey of the Who.

This collection includes material from various single releases and two albums dating from 1967-'68, and is for the most part good melodic baroque pop, similar to what groups like the Beatles, Tomorrow, and the Pretty Things were doing at the same time. Though they get pretty weird in You're too incomprehensible, essentially, this is pop music, and very pleasant pop music at that, with great vocal harmonies. Some songs use traditional rock instrumen-tation, while others rely heavily on strings, and you hear accordians and flutes here and there. Some songs display a European folk music influence. There are also a couple of '60's style soul numbers, complete with horns, that sound kind of incongruous here. Overall, I'd say this is a must for collector's of 60's psych and baroque pop. The song I'm going out, a remarkable song with an astonishingly beautiful middle eight section, almost makes it worthwhile all on its own.  (Robert Schell, Texas)
