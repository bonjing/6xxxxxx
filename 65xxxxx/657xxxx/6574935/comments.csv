,Matt90977,2011-08-02T03:03Z,from what I have been able to preview this looks like a very good rip.  great video and audio (not theatre audio like the one from dmt)  taking a long time to seed though..... wish more people would do good 1080p rips.
,Matt90977,2011-08-02T21:29Z,take it back....sound is way off in second half.  very disappointing after waiting so long to download.
