The Raspberries 1972-1972, some of the best "Power Pop" even 
made, in fact "All This And More" by The Dead Boys was actually
a Raspberries Song just re-arranged.  Oh with my Bongos_1st_CD
(Drums Along The Hudson) I encoded it with "Replay Gain" checked,
which doesn't change the file, it does make the volume lower, 
in the player but I hear it can be removed. This time I didn't
check that option, so this thing is full blast, enjoy!
Oh if you ever get the chance, check out the song "It's Cold
Outside" by The Choir, that band one of The Raspberries in it.
Now if I could just post Elton Montello, or if anyone has it,
please post it, I really love that, you know the one with "Jet
Boy, Jet Girl".  Oh yeah this is in Flac, try to seed it a bit
cause a good Raspberries torrent is hard to find. I did edit
this into individual tracks, with a cheap free editor, and did
my best, maybe it's not perfect, or not. Any complaints go ahead
I don't mind, I 'll see what I can do. 
     Oh, I read somewhere, Eric Carmen said he "Spent his 
teenage years with his head in between 2 speakers trying to
figure stuff out, even listening to stuff like "Pet Sounds"
by The Beach Boys, and paying attention to the Modulations,
(not the usual C Major, then modulation to A Minor Stuff, but
he liked the way that Brian Wilson could modulate to a distant
key, and make it back again, with it all sounding natural.
You certainly hear that sort of stuff in "Go All The Way",
something Eric Carmen said he wrote so the kids would get it,
but the "Powers That Be" wouldn't.  Still it was banned in
the U.K. I hear, but heck so were the Sex Pistols, didn't 
seem to hurt them.  Oh well, here is my "Goody Of The day"
enjoy no matter which side of The Atlantic you are on.
