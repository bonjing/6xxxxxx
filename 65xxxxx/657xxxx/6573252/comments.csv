Like froggie said in his notes there's NO glare, NO flicker and NO sync problems, can't see there been a better copy copy than this untill an R5 or DVDRip comes along. An excellent copy and is certainly worth the download...
Many Thanx to froggie100 and Hive-CM8 for the Great copy and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:)"
