,ZtorkX86,2011-08-02T23:55Z,What's the difference with this one compared to Radiance version? Is it possible this is a scenerelease? :)
,Balgias,2011-08-03T01:09Z,Anyone got this yet ? is it legit ?
,ahoi1,2011-08-03T01:19Z,"Well, that's the version from rlslog (or whatever source), so I'll go with this one."
,Fousseni,2011-08-03T03:11Z,SEEEEEEEEEEEEEED PLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
,Fousseni,2011-08-03T03:15Z,SEEEEEEEEEEEEED PLZ
,ZtorkX86,2011-08-03T04:02Z,I'm seeding at 1.2MB/sec but there are lot of laming leechers on this torrent that probably will just leave asap they are finished and not to mention n00bs with 20 kB/s trying to get it downloaded. Anyone knows how to filtrate what kind peers one is suppose distribute pieces/parts of the files in the torrent?
,AnalBeadWarrior,2011-08-03T04:28Z,Thanks soupucia!
,ZtorkX86,2011-08-03T04:36Z,Anyone tried coop or versus mode in multiplayer?
,Fousseni,2011-08-03T04:50Z,i continue upload @ 1MB 
,Fousseni,2011-08-03T04:52Z,this game is AWESOME guys trust me 
,JarateLover,2011-08-03T06:52Z,"@ZtorkX86

  Someone is a noob because they happen to have a slow download speed, and don't mind downloading for a longer period of time?  Interesting.

,GoodTunes,2011-08-03T08:35Z,"Never even heard of this game, will give it a shot."
,Newtrogic,2011-08-03T10:19Z,Though  I realize this is untrue for most cracked games I still have a question: Is it possible to play multipalyer with the cracked version of this game?
,dado81,2011-08-03T11:49Z,"C’mon f....in’ seed, you stupid f...s, I have 10 times faster upload then my download – and thanks to you cheap f...s!!! Remove your f...ing limitations from upload, a..holes!!! – This is message for the certain group of people – they’ll know."
,ahoi1,2011-08-03T12:54Z,"lol @ people annoyed by leechers.

I'm a seeder as well, uploading with 2mb all the time, but hey, if you have upload limit or just a bad connection in general, go fucking leech as much as you want, there will always be enough seeder.

though, don't go leech on early torrents, it fucks up speed pretty much with fresh torrents :D"
,scyris99,2011-08-03T14:26Z,"I cannot seem to get this to work, I am not new to installing games like this, but when I run the exe to start the game, nothing happens, it shows up in task manager then just closes, and thats about as far as I get."
,scyris99,2011-08-03T14:43Z,"Hmm my other comment seems' to have disappeared, anyway, is there anything special u need for this to work? Because when I run the .exe nothing happens and in task manager drwtsn32.exe is in there which means that the exe to start the game kinda instacrashed."
,funguseleet,2011-08-03T16:04Z,"works fine for me win 7 64 
install/ explore iso to see the tinyiso folder
 copy eye.exe to directory and the bin folder-play
  Game seems pretty cool ,plays like a really good halflife 2 mod "
,scyris99,2011-08-03T16:37Z,"funguseleet.. yeah I did that as I said in my 1st comment I am not new to doing this, but I followed the directions and it insta crashes whenever I run the .exe to start the game."
,solarsimian,2011-08-04T02:27Z,I'm having the same problem as scyris99. It instantly crashes before it can even really start.
,solarsimian,2011-08-04T02:31Z,I'm having the same problem as scyris99. The game simply won't even begin to start.
,MonFrayr,2011-08-04T04:21Z,"@ scyris99 & solarsimian

I couldn't get it to launch either. Started looking into it and my problem was the executable faulting out in steamclient.exe.

Installed steam and it started working just fine. Hope this helps

NOTE: I didn't have to run or log into steam, simply install it. "
,avatar2012,2011-08-04T05:06Z,Installed and worked fine with only the substitution of the .exe. Thanks for that all ~
,zbrnan,2011-08-04T10:18Z,"the game is awesome, and just cost 18€

buy it if you can"
,Drake616,2011-08-04T13:39Z,Is there are way to make this work in LAN?
,Milak,2011-08-04T15:05Z,Please seed!!!!
,Daimon117,2011-08-04T18:24Z,"Yea strange thing for me, game works and everything. But after a little play time, my sound went completely off. When I checked on it, I tried to turn it back up but it slowly started going down again!"
,ironmoral,2011-08-04T22:12Z,you'll add updates ?
,Illuminati_Insider,2011-08-05T01:17Z,WORSE game ever! dont play it...
,dysphunktion,2011-08-05T08:23Z,"This works great. I actually bought it this title, however. Downloaded it for a friend. For being an indie game from a lesser-known developer, it's really quite good. A very nice mix of HL2/Deus Ex here. It could use some work to flesh out a lot of bugs (lots of random crashes, never the same crash twice for me) and to help smooth over various little details. Overall a very fun game and well worth the 17 US dollars for it. "
,raiden9188,2011-08-06T03:53Z,"@Drake616 yes indeed there is its called Log Me In - Hamachi it's a lan program that allows crackers like us to get around the bull shit of gaming companys that post their shit for steam only , with a little bit of scripting you can with hamachi you'r best bet if your not a scripter iss to wait for a multiplayer crack"
,sazr,2011-08-06T16:30Z,http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6582153/E.Y.E.Divine.Cybermancy-KaOs i would recommend this one which worked for me first time. i thinks is from the same source but its 1/2 the size. 
,tuk1305,2011-08-06T16:46Z,to play via lan u need hamachi one person start server type sv_lan 0 in console second type connect xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx where x is host IP from hamachi
,Sivos,2011-08-06T19:53Z,"Works perfectly.  This game is pretty cool, but the dialogue is kind of weak.  They say things that I don't think a real person would say in the given situation.  It's kind of like they were rushing too far into the history of the game instead of letting you realize it as you progress.  I do wish it was speech dialogue instead of read though, it gets kind of boring starring at the text for a while hearing the same music over and over.  You just start to losing interest in what is being said really fast."
,brutal_product,2011-08-07T19:51Z,"Looks decent enough. Thanks for the up @soupucia! 
as far as LAN coop goes:
fuck Hamachi
use Tunngle (@goodhuck)
+1"
,JoffyJ,2011-08-08T00:50Z,"@Sivos
the game is a french translation, and is a bit patchy (i think this shows the most in the tutorial titles) but mute the sound and just play it, it is genuinly good :) plus a patch should b out in the next week or so, i,ll probably buy it to get that."
,shawn263241,2011-08-08T07:13Z,"Good game, only had like 2 crashes in two days. A few bugs I noticed pretty soon, whether the pirate's fault or the developer's: 

1) If you switch to the desktop and then back, it will take a while to get back to your game, and your pre-set actions will be reset; 
2) often, after blocking with a melee weapon, you will no longer be able to use that melee weapon, unless you switch to a different weapon and then back;
3) researching is a bit buggy - sometimes it will not launch, sometimes it won't seem to launch, but will when you look back at it, and sometimes it won't actually take your money when launching (this last bug seems to happen whenever the one just before it does). 

Other than these annoyances and some very rough parts of the game, it's very good. Torrent and installation worked fine. Melee is practically broken because of the aforementioned bug with the melee weapons. "
,Atlas91,2011-08-08T18:58Z,Does this come with the patch? A couple of days after it released the developer made a major overhaul fixing and improving a lot of things.
,bigggdan,2011-08-11T02:11Z,"anyone know where this game puts the save files, i messed up on game and killed Mentor and it saved it automatically, i looked all over even tried untinstalling but hes still dead."
,bigggdan,2011-08-11T04:34Z,"nvm on that lol im retarded, me and friends were messing around on lan mode and we killed mentor so when i went into single player i thought it had carried over lol guess thats how games supposed to start though lol."
,Turagh,2011-08-11T22:28Z,"I'm getting an error whenever I try to boot up the game.

Application Load Error 5:0000065434

Anyone know what this is and how to fix it?"
,Kasseopea,2011-08-12T21:18Z,"pile of crap, honestly. it has some nice ideas, but most stuff is just plain noobish"
,LCCastro,2011-08-13T19:27Z,@MonFrayr Thank you very much for the tip.
,relyks,2011-08-16T06:45Z,"I got the LAN play working with this.. here's how.

1. Login to Tunngle or Hamachi with your buddy(s)

2. Create a server, make sure LAN Only is set to YES

3. Press ~ to open the console, put in the following 3 commands....

(sv_lan 0, heartbeat, changelevel divine_cybermancy)

Those are 3 separate commands, don't use the parentheses,  hit enter after each command, this should reload the map after all 3.

4. You are done, but your buddy will not be able to use the standard find server interface to locate your server. They must open the console as well and type (connect xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) where the x's are your server's IP address as it shows in tunngle or hamachi. 

That's it. You may need to add this game to your firewall exceptions or turn off your firewall completely (yes, windows firewall too), as I had to do. Enjoy."
,shawn263241,2011-08-17T00:06Z,"Might I ask when you'll be cracking and releasing the 1.13 patch, my good sir?"
,rpg500e,2011-08-17T00:11Z,If anyone who is in a position to reads this; apparently they released a patch for this game. Would be nice :) thanks.
,hittinskinz,2011-08-18T15:22Z,this game is not worth bothering with until the cracked patch is done & it's no way worth buying.
,equazcio2,2011-08-22T06:40Z,This game has some issues but I can't seem to stop playing it. The cracked patch it out by the way.
,mcm1010,2011-08-23T02:57Z,"it says for me steam error application load error 50000065434

,wezaz,2012-03-11T18:36Z,i am not able to run it.. eye.exe crashes every time i click it
,tiz2,2012-03-14T22:51Z,"For LAN you need the developer console, and for me the ""~""-key was not set to open it as the default setting, but if you open the file found at this location ""x:EYEEYEcfgconfig.cfg"", and edit the line: bind ""x"" ""toggleconsole"", you can set it to what ever you want."
