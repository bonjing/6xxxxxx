I like this music very much, but don't understand any word they sing. Please give me an idea what they here are singing about. 
With best wishes from Germany. Beaujoulais"

What Would You Give To Be In My Place

What would you give to be in my place?
If  people would hate you, but admire you
What would you give?
What would you give for the big gesture,
If theyâ€™d live your instead of their own life?
What would you give?
You should be happy now that youâ€™re across the road
And that a terrific flight over the abyss separates us,
Because this is my five minutes,
And youâ€™ve got your whole life ahead of you.
What would you give to be able to
Raise your hand and have the masses follow you ?
What would you give?
Would you also, deep in your heart, cry,
Like my heart is freezing?
Would you also?
You should be happy now that youâ€™re across the road
And that a terrific flight over the abyss separates us,
Because this is my five minutes,
And youâ€™ve got your whole life ahead of you.
You should be happy now that youâ€™re across the road
And that a terrific flight over the abyss separates us,
Because this is my five minutes,
And youâ€™ve got your whole life ahead of youâ€¦"
