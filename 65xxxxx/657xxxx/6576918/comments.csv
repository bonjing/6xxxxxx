I love how you have no disregard to the uploaders of torrents as they have the data, and you don't. Go check iTunes, you'll see that the official release also has the cut on Aerophobia. It was never corrupt as it never hit the market with the full recording. Get your facts straight before you troll on people's torrents... .-."
