Muhammad's Believe It Or Else! 

Since so many Westerners have embraced Islam, it is important that they accept ALL the teaching of Islam.  To reject any aspect of Islamic teaching or law is the sin of apostasy.  And the punishment for that is severe indeed.

DID YOU KNOW?

* Satan specifically lives in your upper nose.
* Playing chess is like dyeing your hand with swine's blood.
* Infidels have 7 intestines.
* One wing of a fly has the disease, the other the cure.
* At night, the sun sleeps in a murky pond.
* All yawns are from Satan.
* A tree would cry until Muhammad hugged it.
* Muhammad's food would talk to him as he ate it.


All this and more, fully illustrated in cartoon form for easy learning.
