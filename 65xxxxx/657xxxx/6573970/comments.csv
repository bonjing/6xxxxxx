Christian Priests Convicted for Sexual Abuse:-

A regularly updated list of priests, ministers or any clergymen caught or convicted of sexually abusing children 
in some way, shape or form. Priests who have been merely accused of sex abuse are not included in this list. 
Only priests legally convicted for sexual abuse of a minor or priests caught having any kind of sexual relations 
with children are included on this list along with their crimes and why they were convicted. Catholic sex abuse is, 
unfortunately, a very common crime around the world due to the immense amount of trust placed in men of ""God"", 
so the more you can raise awareness of the reality of this danger the better. There is nothing ""okay"" about 
Christian sexual abuse, so here are Christian clergymen who have betrayed their flock and their faith.

FREQUENCY OF CHRISTIAN RITUAL ABUSE: 
The S.A.F.F. only began collecting, collating and analysing Sexual Abuse linked with ecclesiastics during 1989 
hence the sample of cases grew as our scope and ability to source them increased. The early years are therefore 
sparse but this reflects the lack of attention so far applied to them. Since 1978 we have logged over ONE HUNDRED 
convictions of Christian Ritualised Abuse. Compare these DEFINITE cases with the six uncorroborated cases promoters 
of Satanic Ritualised Abuse have unearthed over the same period and the true nature of both is immediately apparent. The average yearly level of abuse going by our 1989/90 & 91 figures can be considered representational at two dozen cases per year, a shocking figure. We did not collate cases prior to this.

The tragedy of the suffering of innocent children in this situation is too miserable to contemplate."

Rape In The Bible



    Rape is one of the most heinous crimes imaginable.  Yet few people know that the Bible often condones and even 
approves of rape.  How anyone can get their moral guidance from a book that allows rape escapes me.  
Perhaps they have been lied to about the Bible and carefully detoured around all the nasty stuff in the Bible.



    So grab your Bibles and follow along as I show you all the nasty rapes that your priests and preachers don't 
want to tell you about.  Note that in many places in the Bible there are references to ""taking a wife"".  
Don't be fooled into thinking that these were voluntary marriages.  This first quote clearly shows that murder 
and force were used to ""take"" these wives. "
,zulu-1,2011-07-31T17:13Z,"1) Murder, rape, and pillage at Jabesh-gilead  (Judges 21:10-24 NLT)



    So they sent twelve thousand warriors to Jabesh-gilead with orders to kill everyone there, including women and 
children.  ""This is what you are to do,"" they said. ""Completely destroy all the males and every woman who is not a 
virgin.""  Among the residents of Jabesh-gilead they found four hundred young virgins who had never slept with a man,
 and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.



    The Israelite assembly sent a peace delegation to the little remnant of Benjamin who were living at the rock of 
Rimmon. Then the men of Benjamin returned to their homes, and the four hundred women of Jabesh-gilead who were 
spared were given to them as wives.  But there were not enough women for all of them.  
The people felt sorry for Benjamin because the LORD had left this gap in the tribes of Israel.  
So the Israelite leaders asked, ""How can we find wives for the few who remain, since all the women of the tribe of 
Benjamin are dead?  There must be heirs for the survivors so that an entire tribe of Israel will not be lost forever.  
But we cannot give them our own daughters in marriage because we have sworn with a solemn oath that anyone who 
does this will fall under God's curse.""



    Then they thought of the annual festival of the LORD held in Shiloh, between Lebonah and Bethel, along the east 
side of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem.  They told the men of Benjamin who still needed wives, 
""Go and hide in the vineyards.  When the women of Shiloh come out for their dances, rush out from the vineyards, 
and each of you can take one of them home to be your wife!  And when their fathers and brothers come to us in 
protest, we will tell them, 'Please be understanding.  Let them have your daughters, for we didn't find enough 
wives for them when we destroyed Jabesh-gilead. And you are not guilty of breaking the vow since you did not give 
your daughters in marriage to them.'""  So the men of Benjamin did as they were told.  They kidnapped the women who 
took part in the celebration and carried them off to the land of their own inheritance.  Then they rebuilt their 
towns and lived in them.  So the assembly of Israel departed by tribes and families, and they returned to their 
own homes.



    Obviously these women were repeatedly raped.  These sick bastards killed and raped an entire town and then 
wanted more virgins, so they hid beside the road to kidnap and rape some more.  How can anyone see this as 
anything but evil?"
,zulu-1,2011-07-31T17:14Z,"2) Murder, rape and pillage of the Midianites    (Numbers 31:7-18 NLT)



    They attacked Midian just as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they killed all the men.  All five of the 
Midianite kings â€“ Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba â€“ died in the battle.  They also killed Balaam son of Beor 
with the sword.  Then the Israelite army captured the Midianite women and children and seized their cattle and 
flocks and all their wealth as plunder.  They burned all the towns and villages where the Midianites had lived.  
After they had gathered the plunder and captives, both people and animals, they brought them all to Moses and 
Eleazar the priest, and to the whole community of Israel, which was camped on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan 
River, across from Jericho. 



    Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the people went to meet them outside the camp.  
But Moses was furious with all the military commanders who had returned from the battle.  ""Why have you 
let all the women live?"" he demanded.  ""These are the very ones who followed Balaam's advice and caused the 
people of Israel to rebel against the LORD at Mount Peor.  
They are the ones who caused the plague to strike the LORD's people.  
Now kill all the boys and all the women who have slept with a man.  Only the young girls who are virgins may live; 
you may keep them for yourselves.



Clearly Moses and God approves of rape of virgins."
,zulu-1,2011-07-31T17:15Z,"4) Laws of Rape   (Deuteronomy 22:28-29 NLT)



    If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver 
to her father.  Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce 
her.



What kind of lunatic would make a rape victim marry her attacker?  Answer: God."

"
,zulu-1,2011-07-31T17:16Z,"6) David's Punishment - Polygamy, Rape, Baby Killing, and God's ""Forgiveness"" (2 Samuel 12:11-14 NAB)



    Thus says the Lord: 'I will bring evil upon you out of your own house.  I will take your wives [plural] while 
you live to see it, and will give them to your neighbor.  He shall lie with your wives in broad daylight.  
You have done this deed in secret, but I will bring it about in the presence of all Israel, and with the sun 
looking down.'

    Then David said to Nathan, ""I have sinned against the Lord.""  Nathan answered David: ""The Lord on his part has 
forgiven your sin: you shall not die.  But since you have utterly spurned the Lord by this deed, the child born to 
you must surely die.""  [The child dies seven days later.]



    This has got to be one of the sickest quotes of the Bible.  God himself brings the completely innocent rape 
victims to the rapist.  What kind of pathetic loser would do something so evil?  And then he kills a child!  This 
is sick, really sick!"
,zulu-1,2011-07-31T17:17Z,"8)  Rape and the Spoils of War (Judges 5:30 NAB)



    They must be dividing the spoils they took: there must be a damsel or two for each man, Spoils of dyed cloth as 
Sisera's spoil, an ornate shawl or two for me in the spoil.   (Judges 5:30 NAB)



9) Sex Slaves (Exodus 21:7-11 NLT)



    When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are.  
If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again.  But he is not allowed 
to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her.  And if the slave girl's owner 
arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, 
but he must treat her as his daughter.  If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce 
her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife.  If he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave 
as a free woman without making any payment.   (Exodus 21:7-11 NLT)



10) God Assists Rape and Plunder (Zechariah 14:1-2 NAB)



    Lo, a day shall come for the Lord when the spoils shall be divided in your midst.  And I will gather all the 
nations against Jerusalem for battle: the city shall be taken, houses plundered, women ravished; half of the city 
shall go into exile, but the rest of the people shall not be removed from the city.   (Zechariah 14:1-2 NAB)"

,zulu-1,2011-08-01T14:42Z,"Murder in the Bible
The act of murder is rampant in the Bible.  In much of the Bible, especially the Old Testament, there are laws that 
command that people be killed for absurd reasons such as working on the Sabbath, being gay, cursing your parents, 
or not being a virgin on your wedding night.  In addition to these crazy and immoral laws, there are plenty of 
examples of God's irrationality by his direct killing of many people for reasons that defy any rational explanation 
such as killing children who make fun of bald people, and the killing of a man who tried to keep the ark of God 
from falling during transport.  There are also countless examples of mass murders commanded by God, including the 
murder of women, infants, and children.

The following passages are a very small percentage of the total passages approving of murder in the Bible.  
They are divided here into three parts: 
1) Capital Punishment Crimes, 
2) God's Murders for Stupid Reasons, 
3) Murdering Children, and 
4) Miscellaneous Murders.  

This list is long, but it barely scratches the surface of all the murders approved of in the Bible."

When the king of Ai saw the Israelites across the valley, he and all his army hurriedly went out early the next 
morning and attacked the Israelites at a place overlooking the Jordan Valley.  But he didn't realize there was 
an ambush behind the city.  Joshua and the Israelite army fled toward the wilderness as though they were badly

and they had nowhere to go. For the Israelites who had fled in the direction of the wilderness now turned on their 
pursuers.  When Joshua and the other Israelites saw that the ambush had succeeded and that smoke was rising from 
the city, they turned and attacked the men of Ai.  Then the Israelites who were inside the city came out and 
started killing the enemy from the rear. So the men of Ai were caught in a trap, and all of them died. Not a single 
person survived or escaped.  Only the king of Ai was taken alive and brought to Joshua.

    When the Israelite army finished killing all the men outside the city, they went back and finished off everyone 
inside.  So the entire population of Ai was wiped out that day â€“ twelve thousand in all.  For Joshua kept holding 
out his spear until everyone who had lived in Ai was completely destroyed.  Only the cattle and the treasures of 
the city were not destroyed, for the Israelites kept these for themselves, as the LORD had commanded Joshua.  
So Ai became a permanent mound of ruins, desolate to this very day.  Joshua hung the king of Ai on a tree and

fire, after they had stoned them with stones.  And they raised over him a great heap of stones to this day.  
So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger: wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of 
Achor to this day.  (Joshua 7:19-26 Webster's Bible)"

While the Israelites were camped at Acacia, some of the men defiled themselves by sleeping with the local Moabite 
women.  These women invited them to attend sacrifices to their gods, and soon the Israelites were feasting with 
them and worshiping the gods of Moab.  Before long Israel was joining in the worship of Baal of Peor, causing the 
LORD's anger to blaze against his people.  The LORD issued the following command to Moses: ""Seize all the 
ringleaders and execute them before the LORD in broad daylight, so his fierce anger will turn away from the people 
of Israel.""  So Moses ordered Israel's judges to execute everyone who had joined in worshiping Baal of Peor.  Just 
then one of the Israelite men brought a Midianite woman into the camp, right before the eyes of Moses and all the 
people, as they were weeping at the entrance of the Tabernacle.  When Phinehas son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron 
the priest saw this, he jumped up and left the assembly.  Then he took a spear and rushed after the man into his 
tent. Phinehas thrust the spear all the way through the man's body and into the woman's stomach.  So the plague 
against the Israelites was stopped, but not before 24,000 people had died.  (Numbers 25:1-9 NLT)"

At the customary time for offering the evening sacrifice, Elijah the prophet walked up to the altar and prayed, 
""O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, prove today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant. 
Prove that I have done all this at your command.  O LORD, answer me! Answer me so these people will know that you, 
O LORD, are God and that you have brought them back to yourself.""  Immediately the fire of the LORD flashed down 
from heaven and burned up the young bull, the wood, the stones, and the dust.  It even licked up all the water in 
the ditch!  And when the people saw it, they fell on their faces and cried out, 
""The LORD is God!  The LORD is God!""  Then Elijah commanded, ""Seize all the prophets of Baal.  
Don't let a single one escape!""  So the people seized them all, and Elijah took them down to the Kishon Valley and 
killed them there.  (1 Kings 18:36-40 NLT)"

""Go up, my warriors, against the land of Merathaim and against the people of Pekod. Yes, march against Babylon, 
the land of rebels, a land that I will judge!  Pursue, kill, and completely destroy them, as I have commanded you,

Micah Kills a Whole Town  
Then, with Micah's idols and his priest, the men of Dan came to the town of Laish, whose people were peaceful and 
secure.  They attacked and killed all the people and burned the town to the ground.  There was no one to rescue 
the residents of the town, for they lived a great distance from Sidon and had no allies nearby.  This happened 
in the valley near Beth-rehob.Then the people of the tribe of Dan rebuilt the town and lived there.  They renamed 
the town Dan after their ancestor, Israel's son, but it had originally been called Laish.  (Judges 18:27-29 NLT)

The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a fraudulent antisemitic text purporting to describe a Jewish plan for achieving global domination. It was first published in Russia in 1903, translated into multiple languages, and disseminated internationally in the early part of the twentieth century. Henry Ford funded printing of 500,000 copies which were distributed throughout the United States in the 1920s."
