I donâ€™t know if the title "Wrath" fits but the lyrics are dark and bitter. The music though, is still smooth, melodic synthpop. This time with guitars, however, which works well some of the time. But on many tracks the guitars sadly take away the electronic precision and warm sound of the last album, that I liked so much, making "Wrath" radio pop, too streamlined for its own good.

Unfortunately, the song writing isnâ€™t quite up to par this time around either. At first listens, â€œWrathâ€ was a big disappointment, but upon repeated listening, it has grown. Especially the first half. Itâ€™s not in the same league as â€œAwakeningâ€, but itâ€™s still a good pop album, although the hits arenâ€™t as obvious. Reaganâ€™s voice is still great and fits the music perfectly, and Andrewâ€™s synthesizers are always skillfully programmed, itâ€™s just that the result is a bit â€œflatâ€. Itâ€™s also too sugary for many, I bet. But such things donâ€™t bother me.
