cause here in Holland we have to wait for those episodes at least 6 months. it doesn't go fast but that's because our internet is just crap!"
,twizted_rozes,2011-08-01T10:51Z,"At about 15:52 into the video, the audio skips. It throws the audio off for the rest of the video. Don't bother downloading. A better quality should be available soon."
,KutDing,2011-08-01T12:17Z,Puur-ownzz ben het met je eens :P
,franciee,2011-08-01T12:20Z,"Unfortunately a very lagged torrent. I didn't even get as far as 15:52 to witness the audio problem. Possibly a problem caused by the conversion software but either way, not the best of quality! "
,shameen,2011-08-01T14:56Z,"frame rate is very low, and audio desync can be fixed with VLC if you set it to about -0.5sec."
,DryYoshi,2011-08-01T15:31Z,Thanks for the episode. But I might wait for another one to subtitle it in Dutch (Nederlandse ondertitels maken is leuk :D)
,stuntz0rZ,2011-08-02T06:20Z,This is crap! the file size is very large and it's not no where near 720p HD. Audio/Video is not worth watching. wait for SURFER'S release
,nonoboo,2011-08-02T12:56Z,Is there a better version of this? It's VERY lagged.
,dragondrop,2011-08-04T16:57Z,"Yeah, framerate is bad for a file that size, and the sound is off. Not really enjoyable; gotta wait for another release."
,puur-ownzz,2011-08-06T21:04Z,"please seed this one:
