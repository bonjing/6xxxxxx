Marc Silberman, The German Wall - Fallout in Europe

When the Berlin Wall came down suddenly in 1989, it marked a rupture of global significance. Almost overnight, November 9 became one of the most significant dates in global collective memory, as well as a signal event in German national history. This book examines the consequences of the fall of the Wall: the physical barrier, its demise, and how it has been mediated in film and television; how the city and nation that had been torn asunder now struggle to reunite; how old and new minorities are being socially and politically integrated; and how a new European identity emerges in the post-Wall era.
