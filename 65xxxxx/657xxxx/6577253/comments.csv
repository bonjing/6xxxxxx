,majtophat,2011-08-06T23:56Z,"I am having a lot of problems with this:

*No Sound
*Cannot install WHS2011 connector software
*No remote desktop and when I try to install it, it says that it is already installed


But it is running blazingly fast and the memory footprint is tiny. Does anyone have a suggestion for something similar to this, but that actually works?"
