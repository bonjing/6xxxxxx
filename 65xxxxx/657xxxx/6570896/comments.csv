,tttgroup,2011-09-19T09:14Z,The real bad one sided propaganda where they are still trying to prove indirectly that the Muslims are terrorist .. That is all what they are focusing by hiding in the life of Prophet.. Shame on you BBC Shame on you who made it this way.. it could have been simpler and easy !!
