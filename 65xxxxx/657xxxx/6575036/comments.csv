,formerly_azrielle,2011-08-30T13:57Z,"The best English version--and I've downloaded several to make sure, among which are:
...playSD.ARNT.mkv (REALLY bad audio);
...TCSRES restored CAM (video is pretty good, roughly comparable to this one--what you can see of it, at any rate, as it is ""boxed in"" even on full screen; audio is probably a tad better than this one)

The superior non-boxed, widescreen video of this TS (Scenelovers) is why I recommend you ignore all the others.  That said, my ratings are as compared to your average R5 or even DVDrip:
V ~6.5
A ~5.5"
