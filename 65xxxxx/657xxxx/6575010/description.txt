use your mobile phone (android) as a remote control for your pc or laptop.

I got it from this website: http://symbianworld.org/1395-smarttouch-control-your-pc-using-your-nokia-5800-xpressmusic/

But i added 1 file: an update for python on your mobile.

install the three .sis documents on your mobile (android), 
and install smart touch on your pc/laptop.
