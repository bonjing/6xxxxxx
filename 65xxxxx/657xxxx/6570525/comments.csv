,KotsChopShop,2011-08-10T07:37Z,"ffs where's the keygen.php?

I've browsed all the folders and it's nowhere to be found"
[V],ua3,2011-08-10T16:25Z,"@ KotsChopShop

heh , it works without a keygen.php - my bad for the wrong readme , just go to http://yourdomain.com/install/index.php and installation starts."
,KotsChopShop,2011-08-10T21:34Z,"yeah, I tried that but the install errors out after like step 7 or some (for me) ..so I assumed it was that lack of keygen.php, might've been the .htaccess tho.. idk - anywayz, this is nulled so I won't get too far on any decent host - thanks anyway"

Reply Soon!!"
,snadge,2011-10-27T02:11Z,"the best free hosting I think is Awardspace as its 100% ad free with 5Gb traffic...but they suffer with latency problems half the time on the free server (it IS free) - they even give you a free subdomain to use too

if your wanting to pay for decent host then you can get 1 years hosting at HostXnow for ÂŁ49.50 with a domain name free for life (worth ÂŁ9 per year) with 3gb storage and 120Gb traffic... im using it and its brill, support is excellent if you need them too, instant 1-2-1 chat"
