Cowboy & Aliens (2006)
By: Fred Van Lente, Andrew Foley, Luciano Lima


In the Old West, settlers and Native Americans wage a bloody battle for control 
of the land. But when the Earth is threatened by conquerors from the stars, 
these sworn enemies must work together to save all humanity. Iron Man Director
John Favreau based his 2011 movie of the same title on this comic.

There was a webcomic sequel: C&A: Worlds at War, I have been unable to locate 
a copy - I will upload when/if I do.
