Fasting teaches self restraint, as well as compassion for the poor, and cleanses the body.  And I don't know a single observant Muslim that is obese, drinks alcohol, or smokes - all things that Americans are #1 in the world at."

You are an idiot! because you are spreading hate by insulting people. You even can not participate in a simple discussion."

@Rustgold
How old are you? I'm asking because by looking at your comment you seem like someone who doesn't even understand how arguments work. You quoted about fasting being prescribed upon muslims and then instead to counter that claim you give another quote that doesn't have anything to do with fasting?!?

Looking at this you seem to have problems with simple concepts as argument and counter-argument.

Secondly, yes -- war IS ALLOWED in islam, BUT ONLY AGAINST THOSE WHO ATTACKED YOU AND KILLING OF INNOCENTS IS FORBIDDEN! 
All those verses have following verses which you didn't added here. I wonder why. Maybe because they say that it's not allowed to kill innocents and not fight those that do not wish to fight you? I know those verses and you couldn't have seen one verse and failed to see the next one or two. That tells me you have a mind poisoned to attack islam with lies and distortion of truth. 

Third, war is of course allowed to muslims to defend themselves. What religion are you? Or nation? Are you saying your country doesn't have an army? That your army never killed? Most probably you belong to a religion that has it's armies spread all across the world killing innocent people as we speak. And you have a nerve to point fingers at islam? 

Islam is a greatest growing religion on Earth by converts. All these attacks against islam just make people who never heard of it to see what's it's all about. So go on ahead. With you ignorance and distortion of truth, that even a child can find out if it reads a few verses on it's own instead of finding them on pathetic hate sites, you actually are doing islam a good promotion. 

Those dumb enough to believe you aren't really wanted anyway. "

,inasense,2012-03-13T07:20Z,"I don't think Islam teaches hate, although most deaths throughout history come by way of Religion. It's ignorant assholes that turn the messages of great prophets (""messengers of g-d"") into ""we are the best"" ""everyone else lies/convert or die"" hatred mentality. I'm personally ashamed of/for people that are so ""religious"" / ""follow the word of g-d"" and still spread hatred.  Ignorant and brainwashed individuals should not mention/use religion in order to spread more hatred, particularly fools that are hypocrites and wish they enjoyed the life that many others do.   "
