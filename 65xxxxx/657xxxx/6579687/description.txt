All Praise is due to Allah and may Allah exalt the mention of
His Prophet and render him and his household, his
Companions, and those who follow their way safe from every
evil, and grant them security on the Day of Resurrection.



It is the nature of the human soul to slacken and become bored and tired of
striving, especially in the face of the temptations of life, the many pleasures
of this world, and the deception of Satan. As a result, the soul becomes
weak in performing obligatory duties and acts of worship; it gradually
becomes less affected by them and benefits less from them. It is the
wisdom and mercy of Allaah The Almighty that He has ordained for the
soul all that strengthens its weakness, sharpens its determination, and
increases its faith through the virtue He conferred on certain times and
places. The seasons of virtue, for instance, include the first ten days of
Thul-Hijjah, the 10th of Muharram, and Ramadhaan.
Fasting is a great act of worship that Allaah The Almighty made one of the
pillars of Islam and prescribed upon the Muslims â€“ not for one day or a
week, but for an entire month every year.
