,[Flux],2011-07-31T23:13Z,"God, it makes me mad when people just come up on a torrent, DL it, then don't even think about seeding it. Ungrateful is what that is.

I would seed if I could, but in Australia we get charged for uploads as basically downloads. So if I have a 100gb allowance, I download 50gb and upload 50gb then I will get my internet slowed until it resets. Mind you, the slowed speed is 6-12kb/sec."
,AndyParka,2011-08-01T17:11Z,"@sharpes123

I live in Aus too, I'm paying 80$ a month for unlimited uploads and downloads, no capping, just unlimited net. I think you need to get better net."

,Flower_Fetish,2012-02-15T07:13Z,"@w00t13
I love how you have no disregard to the uploaders of torrents as they have the data, and you don't. Go check iTunes, you'll see that the official release also has the cut on Aerophobia. Get your facts straight before you troll on people's torrents... .-."
,itsrayduh,2012-03-14T01:20Z,"I am currently downloading, and will be seeding for as long as possible, Please belive!"
