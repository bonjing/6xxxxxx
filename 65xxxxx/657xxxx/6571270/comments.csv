,themorningstar69,2011-07-30T04:12Z,"It's funny people keep arguing about this.  Both are right, depending where you look.  Originally the movies released as 4 parters and were considered a season, then this season was split into two, making this part of the 8th season.  Other sources don't count the movies and have considered all the Comedy Central episodes so far one season, making this the 20th episode of the 6th season.  Just a matter of opinion.  Thanks Arch0n, love the HD Futuramas!"

The original seasons were creative and shaped a storyline with cross-references and inside jokes. This is just cheap one-hit jokes (that aren't funny, like the simpsons)."
