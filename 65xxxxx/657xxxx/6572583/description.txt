Tears of Gaza - 2010 - DVDSCR XVID AC3 [Eng] - GCJM

===================================================

"Perhaps the ultimate anti war film " - Hollywood Reporter

A powerful and emotionally devastating record of the impact the
2008-2009 bombings of Gaza had on the civilian population.

Disturbing, powerful and emotionally devastating, Tears of Gaza
is less a conventional documentary than a record presented with
minimal gloss of the 2008 to 2009 bombing of Gaza by the Israeli
military. Photographed by several Palestinian cameramen both
during and after the offensive, this powerful film by director
Vibeke LÃ¸kkeberg focuses on the impact of the attacks on the
civilian population.
