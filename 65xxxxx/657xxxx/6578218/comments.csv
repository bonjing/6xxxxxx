Before you download any rip, evaluate yourself by checking screens & sample.
Look for if video is blurred, jerky or aspect ratio is wrong (stretched faces).
If anything is wrong or you don't feel that rip is good or up to the mark, PM the
ripper to post a better version or download any other rip.

On the whole, BBUDDAH HOGA TERRA BAAP is a must-watch for Bachchan fans. Even if you're not a fan of this iconic actor, watch it for a simple reason: They don't make them like Amitabh Bachchan anymore. A masala entertainer all the way."
