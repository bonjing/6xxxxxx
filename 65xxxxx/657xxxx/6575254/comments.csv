,drarkan,2011-08-01T06:04Z,Stop Fucking RARing up the files on all the torrents you guys do!!! Its no fucking different than just straight video format!!! see what others do? just do that its goddamn annoying thats why you guys have less seeds than eztv
,marcvit,2011-08-01T06:49Z,"I'm geting this ""no connection can be made because the target machine actively refused it""... anyone knows why?!"
,svart.se,2011-08-01T07:07Z,"no need to be snarky drakan... shit, just get VLC, it'll play straight from the RAR anyways.  I'm just stoked to have it at all.  Thanks for the upload, sceneline."
,svart.se,2011-08-01T07:27Z,"PS - please seed, folks."
,ProtoX4,2011-08-01T10:39Z,"Eh? This torrent has more seeds and fewer leeches than eztv's... lol

2 minutes to unrar and 10 seconds to delete? That's like forever to me. Not sure if it's because of a slow cpu you have or because of the SSD I have. ;)"
,tiss2,2011-08-01T15:20Z,"It could take 2 hours to unrar it, and you would still be able to see the episode before the eztv fanboys. They are so sloooooooowwwwwwwwwwwww......

sceneline rules The Bay."
