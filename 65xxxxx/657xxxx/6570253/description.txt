Nightwish is a symphonic metal band from Kitee, Finland, formed in 1996 by songwriter/keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and former vocalist Tarja Turunen. Nightwish's current line-up has five members, although Tarja has been replaced by Anette Olzon and the original bassist, Sami VÃ¤nskÃ¤, has been replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist part; previously male vocal-parts were done by Tuomas or guest singers.

Although Nightwish has been prominent in their home country since the release of their first single, â€œThe Carpenterâ€ (1997) and debut album Angels Fall First, they did not achieve worldwide fame until the release of the albums Oceanborn, Wishmaster and Century Child, which were released in 1998, 2000 and 2002 respectively. Their 2004 album, Once, which has sold more than 1 million copies, led to the broadcast of Nightwish video clips on MTV in the United States and inclusion of their music in US movie soundtracks. Their biggest US hit single, â€œWish I Had an Angelâ€ (2004), made it onto three US film soundtracks as a means to promote their North American tour. The band produced three more singles and two music videos for the album, as well as â€œSleeping Sunâ€, from the 2005 â€œbest ofâ€ compilation album, Highest Hopes, prior to vocalist Tarja Turunenâ€™s dismissal.
