,Billythebat,2011-07-30T09:35Z,"You idiots who say it has a Password are wrong, it has NONE. 

And the reason it is in RAR form is becasue it is off USEnet, that is how files are on Usenet.  

And, if you have a look at Eztv or vtv  none of these have the file for this show yet and it was near on  2 days ago this was released, scene balance is faster....infact i would not be suprised if eztv is not just repacking this for the lazy.

As for Rars, download winrar   install it, and play the file from within it or unpack it and delete the rar.   you do not have unpack each file, just unpack the first rar file in the folder with win rar and the rest will take care of itself.  

Very easy.  "
,JesusCrust,2011-07-30T11:36Z,"It is password protected!

I hardly ever log on to TPB, and it's even more uncommon that I make a comment. 

But this is the lamest shit I've seen in a very long time.
"
,homeiest,2011-07-30T14:55Z,"Dont bother the comments above! 
This one is real! 9/10"
,quabug,2011-07-30T18:16Z,"Cannot extract in linux by using unrar with pw='NONE' ...
Well, I suggest you guys download other torrent.."
,medusa07,2011-07-31T12:26Z,"What's wrong with you guys? The torrent is FINE.

I unpacked it using WinRar, and am watching it right now.

Sheesh. Some of you need to lighten up."
,ssamuel68,2011-07-31T19:52Z,What's the password for the rar????
,TinGrin87,2011-08-01T00:44Z,"first off, there is no password. 
Why rar? Because this is a scene release.

Thanks SceneBalance for the releases, even if some people can't figure it out."
,slickdipstick,2011-08-01T02:17Z,"Running Linuxmint 9, extracted just fine. Good avi file, no password needed. Thanks."
,Benishdamenish,2011-08-01T05:52Z,There is no password.. winzip can be used to extract the file. Good upload scenebalance!
,xmassacre,2011-08-02T15:20Z,very quick download. maxed out at 3.2mbps Great quality. Thanks. Will keep seeding at max speed my line will allow
,natxavier,2011-08-03T00:05Z,"To all those having issues with the file being ""password protected,"" check your .rar handling client or clean your computer - the file is good.

However, I do not see the point in submitting a torrent in .rar format.  Is it hard to extract the file or watch from within?  No.  Is it annoying?  Slightly.  The compression saves minimal disk space at best.

That being said, I got rid of cable 2 years ago, and I watch all of my TV online thanks to uploaders like this. 

Thank you, good sir."
,bigboxes1,2011-08-03T00:22Z,"Those claiming a password is required or that there is a virus are either trolling or lying.  Downloaded quickly and easily extracted with WinRAR.  However, the OP could have extracted the file themselves and then uploaded the avi file.  Whatever the case, thanks to the OP for this ep!"
,trick721,2011-08-03T21:59Z,No password needed.
,7b,2011-08-04T05:01Z,"Thanks for the upload, but uploading in .rar is fucking retarded, and makes me stop seeding the second it's finished."
,Seraphim8,2011-08-05T08:39Z,"not trying to be unappreciative, just wanted to give some advice/2cents... don't upload in rar. Just a preference, nothing more. But thanks for the upload! Great work"
,popelpost,2011-08-05T18:46Z,"this one always do ""rar"" his stuff :-("
,simon200,2011-08-05T21:53Z,"Cheers dude great UL
NO PASSWORD NEEDED!!!!!!!!!"
,MuserClair,2011-08-12T16:40Z,thanks for the ul :-)
,cz-aldaris,2011-08-24T21:21Z,"Why do you upload it in archives? Half of people will immediately delete the archives after extracting, including me. But still, thank you."
,Wrinkled,2011-08-29T02:14Z,"I don't understand the retardism that is raring video files.  For one, codecs(encoder/decoder) are fancy names for compressor and decompressor.  So you're essentially compressing a compressed file.  Secondly, you're making this much more of a process than it has to be.

Get off the drugs and learn wtf you're doing and don't just do things for the fuck of it.

PS
Combined filesize of your rars: 183, 766, 710 bytes
Filesize of AVI:183, 765, 660
You've added over 1KiB in size with rar.
Maybe if you increase compression to max(9) it might save you a few bytes.  Don't bother IT'S ALREADY COMPRESSED FAIRLY WELL!"
,Faule,2011-09-10T05:26Z,Very inconvenient and unnecessary archive/raring but don't have much choice otherwise so thanks for at least putting it up! 
,riplikethat,2011-12-03T22:03Z,"Completely shit video quality. Start doing proper rips or GTFO of the scene, idiots."
