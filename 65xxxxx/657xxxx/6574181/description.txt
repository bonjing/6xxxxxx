Motley Crue released their second Greatest Hits compilation album on November 14, 1998 and the album charted at number 20 on The Billboard 200. The compilation featured two newly recorded songs: "Enslaved" and the single "Bitter Pill" which charted at number 22 on the Mainstream rock charts. Tommy Lee recorded his drum tracks for the album's two new songs, and then started a prison sentence of five months. Additionally, a remix version of "Glitter" is included. The tour for the album began after Lee's release from prison. It would be his last with the band before his return in 2004.
