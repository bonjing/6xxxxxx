,yoyo68y,2011-08-07T05:17Z,100% legit thank you for this amazing torrent I have downloaded dragon age before on other torrents and have always had trouble with missing torrents and many other technical issues but yours has been perfect so far.

,Durhon,2011-08-19T09:11Z,"Great torrent, thanks!"
,Zeomak,2011-08-21T16:47Z,"The Installation itself works great. Strange that is doesnt ask for a serial. But it doesnt work for me. I installed it, but the game does not start from the launcher."
,jbrand2002uk,2011-08-29T19:49Z,is this the full game or just the dlc for origins ?
,Felype,2011-08-31T02:10Z,When I try to play it from the launcher it says I don't have the physxloader on my computer...
,dutchdrag0n,2011-09-02T01:49Z,"Nice work :) This works like a charm it has dragon age origins + awakening and all dlc included. 

Good work and Ty."

THANX!"

,Drunken_kb24,2011-09-28T04:27Z,"@vNa5h HEY, is there anyway to play this without PhysX? "
,cikora,2011-10-06T13:01Z,"Downloaded, installed.
Game didn't ran, because there is no ""physxloader.dll"" file. Seems like it was in the package with the game and could be installed from the disc. 
So downloaded, installed NVIDIA Physx System Software from NVIDIA official site -> http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx_9.09.0814.html and problem was resolved.
Installed Blood Dragon Armor v1.1 and this DLC became useless, because it needs account, from which this DLC was purchased."
,cikora,2011-10-06T17:56Z,"To overcome account authorization after installing Blood Dragon Armor v1.1 DLC copied ""decrypt_all.bat"" and ""dedaodrm.exe"" files from DVD 3 to Dragon Age folder and ran ""decrypt_all.bat"". Then opened ""addins.xml"" file and changed parameter in RequiresAuthorization=""1"" to ""0""."
