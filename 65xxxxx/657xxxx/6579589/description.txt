Product Description:

Spotlight on Modern Transformer Design introduces a novel approach to transformer design using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in combination with finite element method (FEM). Today, AI is widely used for modeling nonlinear and large-scale systems, especially when explicit mathematical models are difficult to obtain or completely lacking. Moreover, AI is computationally efficient in solving hard optimization problems.

Many numerical examples throughout the book illustrate the application of the techniques discussed to a variety of real-life transformer design problems, including:

â€¢ problems relating to the prediction of no-load losses;

â€¢ winding material selection;

â€¢ transformer design optimisation;

â€¢ and transformer selection.

Spotlight on Modern Transformer Design is a valuable learning tool for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, as well as researchers and power engineering professionals working in electric utilities and industries, public authorities, and design offices.
