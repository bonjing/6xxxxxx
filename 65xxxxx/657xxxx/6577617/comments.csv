,aaronp6l,2011-08-03T10:17Z,"Yo YIFY i really respect what your doing for the community.

And was wondering if you could upload the movie Havoc: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285175/
in your beastly quality.

I understand if you cant. :)"
,tony419,2011-08-03T10:34Z,"@xioaodree1111  you were right the first time, funny."
,yose1,2011-08-03T13:01Z,"I've just created an account to let you know how beautiful your rips are. I've already had access to a few of your gems and I can't believe that anyone could rip a movie with such clarity for the size of your uploads.

You Sir, are a true legend.

My only wish would be that others' actually acknowledge this man's talent and say thank you, rather than post just to request a movie.

A little appreciation goes a long way, folks.

Keep up the good work, YIFY."
,damnken,2011-08-03T13:15Z,"Great upload (as usual)
when do you think You'll be able to get The hangover 2?"
,spiker_03,2011-08-04T01:37Z,"i really enjoy yify's movies.
really really good quality and ""free""
but for some reason , ive been getting some warning from my ISP about copyright infringments of the movies i download from yify..

i don't get it, if he shares the movies here for free, why do i get those warnings for?

i'll just refrain myself from downloading anything here now. "

hey, can u please upload ""the messenger"" [2009] and ""crank 2 high voltage"" [2009] in mkv format (as there are some navigation problems for mp4 in vlc.)...thanx a lot"
,goncalo16,2011-08-06T05:55Z,"YIFY if you can, dont make releases in mkv format. use mp4 forever, if you can, because some external discs dont read mkv files, and some people like me use the external disc to see movies in TVs. i now mkv is a good format to make small releases, but, when you can, use mp4 and dont pass on 700 MB plz. sorry about my bad english :s"
