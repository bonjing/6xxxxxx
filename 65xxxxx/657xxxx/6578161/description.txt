From BBC Radio 4 Extra. Written by Lindsey Davis; Full-cast dramatisation starring Anton Lesser as Falco, with Anna Madeley as Helena Justina; Dramatised by Mary Cutler.

Falco is dispatched to one of the most hostile parts of the Empire to deliver a new standard - an iron hand - to one of the legions. Germania is cold, wet, dismal and full of dark forests inhabited by bloodthirsty barbarians, but Falco has an even bigger problem to worry about: he has forgotten Helena Justina's birthday, and she is being pursued by the Emperor's son Titus Caesar. As Falco makes his way through dangerous territory, he encounters the aftermath of a grisly crime, investigates the case of a missing legate, gets into trouble with a centurion and has a fateful encounter with a Celtic priestess and a giant bull. With the help of his travelling companions - Helena's tribune brother Justinus, redundant barber Xanthus and Helveticus - Falco must try to complete his most deadly mission yet...
