Voyage en URSS
Anthology of the Music of the Peoples of the U.S.S.R.
Volume 9 - North Caucasus/Volga-Ural

Here's volume 9 of a 10-volume set of individually packaged LPs, recorded by Melodiya and in 1985 released also on Le Chant du Monde (Mel 23257-23258, LDX 74008). Each volume features one or two sides of instrumental music from a different Soviet Socialist Republic. The recordings feature performances by both amateurs and professionals, mostly instrumental but with some vocal tracks. 

The recordings are in most cases of the highest quality: rich, detailed, clean, with nice tonal balance. The LP pressings are quite good, with minimal pressing noise and essentially no tracking distortion. Each LP includes a booklet with brief descriptions of each track, descriptions of the instruments, and pictures of some of the instruments. 

Volume 9 has instrumental music from the northern part of the Caucasus Mountains on side A and instrumental music from the region of the Volga River and Ural Mountains on side B. The high points for me are the Mari zither performances on side B. There is also a track on side A featuring a pair of duduks, and some lovely recordings of accordions from that area.

My LP copy is in excellent condition. It was transcribed to tagged 24-bit, 44.1 kHz FLAC files, using an analog rig that is near state-of-the-art. I used the mildest possible de-clicking but otherwise no noise reduction. The torrent includes a PDF file with scans of the notes in English and pictures of instruments in the booklet. 

I own 7 of 10 volumes of this set. I've already transcribed two others, and will be transcribing at least one more soon.
