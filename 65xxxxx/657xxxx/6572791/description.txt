             Jack Deebs is a cartoonist who is due to      
               be released from jail. His comic book          
               "Cool World" describes a zany world            
                populated by "doodles" (cartoon                
                characters) and "noids" (humanoids). What      
                Jack did't realize is that Cool World          
                really does exist, and a "doodle"              
                scientist has just perfected a machine         
                which links Cool World with our world.
