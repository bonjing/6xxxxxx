In this course by Professor Robert Greenberg you meet the Schumanns-brilliant, gifted, troubled, and unique in the history of music.

Robert Schumann (1810-1856) and his wife Clara Wieck Schumann (1819-1896) have earned a distinct place in the annals of Western music. As a couple with a two-career marriage-he as a pioneering critic and composer, she as one of the leading concert pianists of Europe-they were highly exceptional in their own time though they seem very contemporary in ours.
