,Cavi Mike,2011-07-30T03:35Z,rar files? Really?
,elnerico,2011-07-30T07:07Z,Why rar?
,pres82,2011-07-30T11:27Z,Doesn't work for me.  
,strathmeyer,2011-07-30T20:55Z,"scenebalance always has broken releases

Try these:

bigger - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6570631/Suits.S01E06.720p.HDTV.x264-ORENJI.mkv
smaller - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6570305/Suits_S01E06_480p_HDTV_x264-mSD"
,wasabi_in_yr_eye,2011-08-03T14:58Z,no no - it does work. if you are unrar-ing using winrar then you need to select the folder above the video file to extract... not the actaull video file. : )
,wasabi_in_yr_eye,2011-08-03T15:01Z,"A - 10
V - 10

big thanks to scenebalance for the upload. : )"
,baayama,2011-08-05T08:48Z,"works great, not sure why the rar's but anyway"
,pxpierre,2011-08-05T11:16Z,"@ strathmeyer - No need to show your ignorance for all to see on the interwebs. scenebalance has a little green skull which you don't have because you don't have any uploads.

When there are multiple small .rar files, using Winrar, unrar the one with the lowest number in the same folder as the destination (suits.s01e06.hdtv.xvid-fqm.rar) in this case and... Et Voila!

Anyway, thanks to scenebalance & seeders."
,asdfhu,2011-09-10T14:52Z,Rar torrents should be banned.
,yogibee,2011-12-23T17:12Z,Many Thanks
