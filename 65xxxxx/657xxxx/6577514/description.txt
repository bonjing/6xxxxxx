In 1981, action star Dante Varona made a daring and spectacular stunt act when he jumped at the San Juanico Bridge for a scene
in â€œHari ng Stunt.â€ Itâ€™s a make-or-break for this struggling actor whose movie career was in limbo for quite sometime and canâ€™t
seem to have a headstart. That breathtaking leap changed his fortune overnight. The movie was dubbed as â€œThe most death defying
action thriller of the year!â€ He became an instant sensation and propelled him to superstardom.
