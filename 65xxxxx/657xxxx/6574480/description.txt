 Southern Fried Chicken boss Andrew Withers visits some of the fast-food       
 franchise's UK outlets to discover why the brand's image is not living up to  
 his expectations. Spending time behind the counters of several outlets, he    
 makes shocking discoveries about the standards of the food and his employees, 
 and tries to transform the businesses from post-pub food stops into family    
 friendly restaurannts.
