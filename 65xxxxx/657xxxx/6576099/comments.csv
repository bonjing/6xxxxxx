[T],FatFreddy69,2011-08-01T15:47Z,"There are 3 Chinese audio tracks, who knows which is which please tell us.

The audio tracks were decoded with sonic then encoded with nero, so not just 2 minutes converts with some junk converter.

Trans-coding is one thing, converting an other.
Avoid converters if you want high quality (video & audio)."
