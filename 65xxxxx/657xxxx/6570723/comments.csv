[T],thetorrentlord,2011-08-16T22:20Z,"@Mr_Gamer: There are currently 15 at 99.5%. There are no other seeders as of yet. Large torrents like this that have multiple parts sometimes go slowly after the start because some are only grabbing one file to check the quality before D/Ling the whole torrent blindly. Until they are D/Ling all files it can go slower, especially if it takes them several days to check the single files and resume D/L all the rest."

,guy_wild,2011-09-26T17:27Z,"Hmph. Apparently things change. I'm stuck with one seeder at 58,7% with 80kbit xfer.

@thetorrentlord: Thank you for sharing this, I sure wished more could stay and seed it. Specially since it's such a huge download."
