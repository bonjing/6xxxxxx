I can tell you why : this is the same source as imagines release, and I've seen that one : the dark parts (spanning half the movie, especially the action scenes) are totally unwatchable, as in, you just don't see anything ;)"
,soupcip,2011-08-01T23:35Z,"I am beginning to think movie companies make movies deliberately darker and darker, cos they know it won't transfer to a cam. Kinda shitty when you think about it."
,LEERV,2011-08-02T04:05Z,"soupcip - Yeah that's right there's a conspiracy, the movie companies ARE making movies darker, soon there'll be just a dark screen. Tell you what, try opening those slits in your face, they're called EYES it really helps.....HONESTLY!!!"

,masgeo,2011-08-17T12:21Z,"Actually, the films are not darker than they used to be, but in order to save money, the majority of cinema's are running the projector bulbs at half light. It sucks. When Robert Rodriguez made Spy Kids 3D, he said he couldn't understand why people were complaining that the 3D didn't work, since at the premiere and test screenings, it was great. Then he realised that most cinemas were running it at half bulb light, which ruined the 3D. Cheapskates, eh."
