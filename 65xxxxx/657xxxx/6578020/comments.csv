My BT client (Vuze) is telling me that the first piece (out of 1316 pieces)is missing and nobody has it so this download might never get to 100%. If it gets stuck at 99.9%, use VLC to play it. VLC works on partial video files - even down to 90-95%."

I did another one and it doesn't have any problems. Download this one instead:
