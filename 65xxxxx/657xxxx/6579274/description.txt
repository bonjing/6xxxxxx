 When a new airplane that's equipped with a new computer that can fly 
 the plane on its own, is about to have its first flight. But the son 
 of the owner decides to upload more software, he doesn't bother to 
 check if there are any viruses with it. And he also invites some 
 potential investors to try it. So the plane appears to be working 
 well but suddenly it veers off course and it can't be shut down. 
 When the military learns of this and fears what if something happens 
 if it's over a populated area; decides to shoot it down along with 
 everyone on board. The man who built the computer whose wife is among 
 the passengers thinks if he can get on board he might be able to shut 
 it down and regain control of the plane. So the military using a new 
 plane gets him on board. But what he didn't know is that both pilots 
 are incapacitated so there's no one who can fly the plane.
