On a sader note, Im sure you've all read and seen that the BBC has now doubled back on their contract with FOM and has now agreed a amended 6 year contract to provide only partial coverage of the Formula 1 races from next year! They will cover 10 races including practice,Qualifying & the Race, However SKY SPORTS will now cover the entire season of 20 races including all practice, qualifying & race. God only knows which presenters will reamin with the BBC or transfer to SKY But this means I will NO LONGER be able to upload the F1 coverage from 2012 as there is no way to record from a SKY PVR HD box in HD quality, so enjoy my uploads for the remainder of the year!

,jorrell0733,2011-07-30T22:12Z,"OK To Explain. Currently I record the F1 coverage from a DVB-T2 HD card which is for Freeview & Freeview HD which the BBC is part of. Most of SKY's  channels are only available through SKY on a SKY/SKY HD PVR box which does not allow you to record other than to its internal HDD where it stores the recording in a temporary Encrypted Macrovision Conditional Access Module (like Irdeto/Viacess for Any Digital Satellite Recievers throuhghout Europe, Except SKY are the only ones who use Macrovision. This is to stop illegal copyright naturally. The only other way to record from the box is through composite video and only stereo sound to a TV card with the correct inputs which is even worse than SD quality! Secondly I will NOT be uploading the BBC coverage of the races they DO decide to cover cos whats the point in that? The BBC has surely pissed many UK F1 fans off with this deal and have left us having to pay 20-30 pounds per month just to recieve SKY SPORTS for the F1 next year, So Im damned If im gonna add to their viewing figures after this total disrespect for thier Licence FEE payers!
