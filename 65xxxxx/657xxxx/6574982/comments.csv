,Mninb,2011-08-10T21:03Z,"Pretty good quality, not HD or anything but still good. It's a great upload, I've been looking for an english dub torrent for this series for a while. Thanks zero!"
,zerocgr2,2011-08-11T16:35Z,@Mninb glad you liked it :D
,Animeman1000,2011-08-15T08:44Z,It's good. Hey how did you get them all in English? Cause they haven't even finish airing on Adult Swim in English.
,Animeman1000,2011-08-15T08:45Z,"I meant it's GREAT!! I watched just one episode Yesterday on Adult Swim, and I knew I liked it."
,zerocgr2,2011-08-15T12:41Z,@Animeman1000 lets just say.....some of us have our sources..... lol but glad you liked it
,Animeman1000,2011-08-15T15:11Z,Nice..Nice..
,Animeman1000,2011-08-23T06:19Z,"You know what I just figured out @zerocgr2. That the PlayStation Store already has all the English episodes, they have all been released on DVD, and all the English episodes are also on AniplexUS's YouTube channel (Which is where you probably got them cause of the quality.) Wow, sources huh. I'm not saying I'm mad. I'm just saying I'm slow, and that I didn't know they were already released. Adult Swim's just showing them that's all."
,zerocgr2,2011-08-23T19:55Z,"no, i didnt get them from any of those"
,zerocgr2,2011-08-23T19:56Z,and...are you trying to troll me?
