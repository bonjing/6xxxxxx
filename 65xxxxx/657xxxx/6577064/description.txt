JoomSEF is a component improving Joomla SEO (search engine optimization): rewrites Joomla URLs to be search engine friendly (SEF), helps to manage site meta tags, manages 301 redirects, allows custom 404 page, etc. Having SEF URLs means more comfort for users and better ranking with search engines. Meta tags that also play important role can be autogenerated (where supported) or entered manually (for all Joomla! URLs). JoomSEF fully supports UTF-8 and will work with non-latin URLs also. In cooperation with JoomFish, it supports URL translations and localization at multilingual sites.
