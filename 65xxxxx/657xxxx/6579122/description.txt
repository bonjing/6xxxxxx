One of the attracting and refreshing features of African cinema, which also can be extended onto most world cinema, is, that it doesnâ€™t have to make up anything, but deals with issues important to both the natives and in length of that to the nation. It may be religion, education or, as here in â€œWaiting for Happinessâ€, cultural differences. It has often been pointed out, that Iranic cinema deals with self reflection: This also is true for this particular branch of African cinema, as Sissako himself points out: "Creation is a search of oneself... And not only creation, but also all that one does."

On the edge of the desert lies a small coastal town. While it is as rural as can be, its location allows it to serve as a transit town, for those traveling to Europe. Here, Abdallah is visiting his mother become traveling to Europe. Unfamiliar with local costume and the dialect, he is a stranger in a strange land, that it self is estranged, as it on one side maintains local costumes and on the other side tries to allow progress to enter. We are constantly introduced to elements, which doesnâ€™t seem to fit in: red sneakers, television, karaoke and even something as simple as a childrenâ€™s toy, while at the same time being shown how tradition is taught from elders to the young.

Throughout â€œWaiting for Happinessâ€, Sissako sets up situations where people have to talk to each other. It is curious, that in a film almost empty of dialogue, the act of communication is one of the central themes. â€œThe intention to communicate is more important than communication itself. If somebody wants to speak to me, it means I exist in their eyes.â€ says Sissako.

Sissako made â€œWaiting for Happinessâ€ without any script and with non actors, having taken characters already existing and put into the location, also already existing. As he says: â€œIt is all there for the camera to captureâ€. For Sissako it is important that it is the images that tell the story, that with almost poetic simplicity examinants the conflict between western progress and native (Islamic) tradition â€“ with a healthy portion of self irony and humour.
