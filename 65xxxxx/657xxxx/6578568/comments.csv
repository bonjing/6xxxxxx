,btzmacin,2011-08-03T11:19Z,"this is amazing, thank you so much.

Will you be uploading 6-10 from the blu-rays/HDTV?  Right now the only 720p season besides your uploads is 10."
,rojo85,2011-08-07T05:39Z,This is an awesome release! You da man! Any chance of getting the other seasons 6-10 in this format?
