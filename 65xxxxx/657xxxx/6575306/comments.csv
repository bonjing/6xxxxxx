,wulles,2011-08-01T11:52Z,redback - Are you sure you are from this planet. Your stuff is the best I have ever seen. Thanks a lot and please continue the good work. WOW.
,redback38,2011-08-01T14:24Z,"ok...ya got me.....im from the planet krypton lol!.....if you would like to thank me?...then share this work with others who need it.....micro$oft would disagree,(doesnt fit thier business model lol)but i believe portable,modular,flexable PE computing will have a huge future if developed and widely used...share it and enjoy:-)watch out for version 6:-)"
,bert16,2011-08-01T15:36Z,This is both a boot option from your bootup drive as well as something than can be set up to boot via CD?
,redback38,2011-08-01T15:57Z,"@Bert16....yes,you can boot many different systems from the boot menu when those systems wont boot normally due to damage or corruption of the master boot record.the first option boots a windows7PE live disk,the second,Hirens rescue disk,all other options are choices/tools to boot or repair systems:-)..."
,redback38,2011-08-01T16:02Z,"@Bert16....burn it as an image with imageburn or simillar .iso burning program,then pop it in ur drive and reboot ur computer...the boot options list will come up and make ur choices from there:-)just so its clear:-)"
,mbmalone,2011-08-01T21:07Z,"Conexant HD Audio 221 works perfectly after running the installed on the desktop. Change drive C to X. Intel 5100 WiFi is not installed, bloody hell. Works if you install your own driver. Here is the 7mb driver pack from Intel. Please integrate it !! http://downloadcenter.intel.com/confirm.aspx?httpDown=http://downloadmirror.intel.com/19861/eng/ICS_Ds32.zip‚å©=eng&Dwnldid=19861"
,mbmalone,2011-08-02T01:40Z,"I made a drop-in script for Conexant HD Audio that rocks. Drop-in the script and requires nothing. Tested on a couple of computers, even enabled HD Audio on a DELL that had used standard Microsoft HD Audio or something? I can give it to you for you next build, so you don't have to place the .exe on the desktop. This will preinstall it! Where can I upload it for you? All the applications rock !!!!!!!!!!"
,redback38,2011-08-02T01:56Z,"@mbmalone....patience is a virtue my friend,iv downloaded the 7MB package and will intergrate the pack in version 6....your drivers(same ones i have just downed) were already set up to go into the build for this one,but i read ur comment and checked the disk and they have not gone in.still investigating why now,script log said no problem,so im not sure yet what happened,sorry dude,as i said before,its like driving a tank over empty egg shells!and driver integration is still a pretty new field for me...."
,redback38,2011-08-02T02:02Z,"id be happy to see the drop in script for sure,mine is an unreliable dog lol!...make a torent out of it...fill out all the stuff on the page with jibberish so noone will download it(discourages ppl from downloading it it and wasting ur bandwith,ill know what it is and thats all that matters lol).then post the link here.ill have it in a flash:-)cool?"
,mbmalone,2011-08-02T04:16Z,"These are custom scripts, so don't lose them. Adds Realtek & Conexant HD Audio during the build. Maybe more. Must be placed in [Drivers]
They are on M Fire, use ""/ ? bkctd5p3owz2ec2"" to get the file. It works sweet !!!!!"
,mbmalone,2011-08-02T04:28Z,"The driver is on m e D i {A} fire dot c o m
Also, when adding wireless drivers and such, there can be no spaces in the folder names. Hope that helps ya. Can't want for v6. "
,redback38,2011-08-02T05:11Z,"@mbmalone......link isnt working,i even went there,signed up,read up,and still couldn get it to work......email the link to this address thefuse@optusnet.com.au.....its a junk account so i dont mind ppl seein it here....but ill ba able to get it there no probs... "
,mbmalone,2011-08-02T07:38Z,"The link is good, I sent the mail. You just had to read between the lines. Piratebay wouldn't let me post the link properly. Unless it's blocked in the Outback."
,redback38,2011-08-02T09:29Z,"Na i worked it out straight away...i knew what you meant mate...got the mail and downloading it now,im doin a test build at the moment that puts yours and a few other requested drivers from other ppl in the start menu under ComputerManagement\Drivers.so you get to choose which driver packs to install(im goin for a one size fits all load up,)after booting.keeps the build modular and i can add/subtract driver packs with each build,but ill see how ur script goes,if its a beaut little drop in?,,,...ill go that way instead,and thank you for the script.:-)"
,redback38,2011-08-02T09:41Z,"i already have the realtek one,but the connexant one is awesome!....itll work great,will test it tonight:-)iv got ur intel5100 wireless driver too,its added in drivers as an installable executable for now.....but its in there....ill automate it as i clean a few bugs...."
,mbmalone,2011-08-02T14:24Z,"I made a a driver installer script for the Intel 5100 that installs the driver from a local folder that you point to. The believe WLAN pack from driverpacks.net includes it, however. I just wanted the latest driver. I can send it to  you. It works perfectly, shows up on the menu and all. You can adjust the location of the files."
,mbmalone,2011-08-02T16:04Z,"My Realtek script looks slightly better. Take a look at it in winbuilder. I want to improve it furthur and get the very latest drivers in the pack, although these work fine they are not the absolute newest from Realtek. "
,mbmalone,2011-08-03T01:32Z,"How about this mother trucker?
http://codecpack.co/download/Realtek-High-Definition-Audio-Codec-Driver.html"
,redback38,2011-08-03T07:39Z,"cool im downloading the codec pack now:-)send me anything you like,ill have a go at anything lol!and a tip you can use with scripts you want to update without totally starting again?when you first make the script?use the attachments section in the scriptmaker to encode the file when puttin it together,that way when you get a newer version?,you just go to attachments,delete the folder,make a new folder and add/encode the updated file/files,winbuilder will delete/update the script and you have a brand new version without doin it all again:-)oh and use the same email to send any links for any script/drivers/files youd like to send,ill get the links from there,and thank you:-)"
,redback38,2011-08-03T10:59Z,"@mbmalone.....just a thought....have you checked out PnPUtill All in the computer management folder in the start menu?...it searches for and installs all the drivers from the host system,its a great utility but often overlooked feature,especially when you have to go from comp to comp for repair work on different comps...:-)....thought id mention it in case it wasnt noticed:-)"
,mbmalone,2011-08-03T19:15Z,"@redback - I found a better Hiren's v14. I got off torrent site ""Hiren's BootCD v14.0 Rebuild by DLC v2.0"". I couldn't believe, the MiniXP inside Hiren's has been updated. It even supported my Intel Proset 5100 wireless. They add like 300 updated wireless drivers to it and updated the software. Use that ISO instead of generic Hiren's v14."
,redback38,2011-08-04T05:13Z,sweet dude!...ill down it and c/over the .iso to be included with version 6:-)thank you:-)
,evanlan,2011-08-05T18:52Z,"You're doing some nice work here, redback. Any chance of including DriveImage XML in your V.6 disk? Thanks!"
,mbmalone,2011-08-06T20:28Z,"Where is version 6?
Can't you see I'm dying here ????"
,redback38,2011-08-09T08:33Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6591917/Win7PE_SEVersion6_BY_Redback38 is the new version(version6)....its very different to this hacking edition,....please look out for my other WIN7 PE_SE torrents....redback38:-)"
