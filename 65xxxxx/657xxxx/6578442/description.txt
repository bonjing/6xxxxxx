Request from the spot translator.

I tried to translate missing 72 lines in the movie "Nishi Ginza Station" and 71 lines are done. One "line" left was not translatable because it was not a language. (A glass with tomato juice is broken in the scene.)

I'm a native speaker of Japanese language so I understand what the actors were speaking in the movie without hitch.
But the dialogues in this movie are based on high context culture. It was not an easy work for me to translate everything into English.

If you think my 71 lines translation help you enjoy the movie, please consider returning a favor.

I cordially request some kind souls support Japanese Red Cross Society's emergency relief program for the earthquake & tsunami that attacked Japan on March 11, 2011.

Japanese Red Cross Society's web page (English language).
