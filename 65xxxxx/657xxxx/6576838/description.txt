    Poor Mary Smith can't go night-clubbing or have any other fun because    
    any hint of scandal could damage her father's political career. She      
    decides to rebel and convinces her two maids to let her go along with    
    them on a blind date with some rodeo performers. She tells her date,     
    Stretch, that she's a parlor maid and that she left home because her     
    father beat her. The two fall in love and elope. Now Mary has a          
    double dilemma: continuing her charade with Stretch and keeping her      
    marriage a secret from her father.
