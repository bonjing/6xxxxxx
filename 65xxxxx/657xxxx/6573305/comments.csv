,Gippy3000,2011-08-01T02:51Z,"As much as I like your HD downloads they are simply too big for me. I waited 2 days for this to download before finding out there is no audio and the race is not even uploaded yet. It's impossible not to know the result unless I put a box on my head until Thursday.
Great quality, too big a file for the number of people sharing."
