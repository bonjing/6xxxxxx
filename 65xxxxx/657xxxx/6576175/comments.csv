,missJiaLi,2011-08-12T19:30Z,"Thank you thank you THANK YOUUUU for uploading such a decent quality, so quick, and most importantly AT THIS SIZE!!!!!!!!! *jumps through the screen and kisses you!!* haha


V:7.5*
A:8

*Yes, it's off center for about 10 seconds int he BEGINNING.........it's nothing.
And any camera in a theatre, is going to have a difficult time picking up dark scenes!! This is just how things are, and people who download bootleg movies, should know this.

And this camera does a pretty decent job for the dark scenes!! You don't miss anything, and for the couple of parts in the dark scenes, that you'll struggle through, you can hear everything you need to figure things out, clearly!


For a movie that was released just three weeks ago, this is an AMAZING upload! And i thank you for it! +1"
