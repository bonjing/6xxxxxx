Please Seed At 5.0 Kbps For 1 Hour / Day. And Continue For 10 Days. I Believe In Freedom. You Have 100% Freedom For ' Hit N Run '. But A Little Help To Others Makes A Big Help To Yourselves ! Why ? If I Find My Old Upload Have ' No Seed ' I Will Seed My Previous Posts, Then I Seed New Films. I Do Not Want To See My Torrents Die Before One Month. So If You Want More Movies From Me Then Seed At 5.0 Kbps For 1 Hour Only In A Day & Continue It For 7-10 Days. It Does Not Affect Your Download Speed. If You Want To Be A Good Seeder Never Finish Your Task ( Reach At Least 1.0 Ratio ) Within A Day Or Some Hours Or Even Some Minutes. You Keep That Torrent File In Your Machine & Seed It Sometimes In A Day. If You Want Numerous Number Of Bengali Films Then Please Seed & If You Do Not Have Any Type Of Sharing Mentality - ' No Problem ', You Have To Wait Long. Choice Is Yours. Thanks.. "
