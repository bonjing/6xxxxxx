Control an NPC Companion who can fight at your side, Rewritten Emissions & PSI attacks (you can become and play as a zombie), Dynamic anomalies, Variety of improved and repairable vehicles (including some with a trunk for your loot, and an APC with a working turret gun), Graphical improvements with optional hi-res textures, Rebalancing, Dynamic weather, New characters. Improved NPC AI. Some new story lines in freeplay. Stronger anomalies may kill a person or a monster and create an artifact (lure monsters to doom, for profit). Lots of little stuff like breakable light bulbs, or campfires only lit if someone is around, plus a handy configuration tool for setting game options.
