,HenkAjax,2011-08-02T19:30Z,Thank you very much for uploading the DVD+extra's.Great job!!
,HenkAjax,2011-08-03T21:15Z,Not available for downloading??  Again??
[V],rambam1776,2011-08-04T04:55Z,"I'm not sure I understand your question. Is TPB down for you, or is the torrent not downloading for you? Right now, I show 4 seeds and 34 peers."
,HenkAjax,2011-08-04T18:07Z,I don't understand why it's not downloading and comes up red in my Utorrent.All my other torrents are downloading and uploading.All my other torrents include TPB.
[V],rambam1776,2011-08-04T18:35Z,"I'd have to guess some glitch at your end. My client shows 7 seeds and 38 peers. You could try deleting the torrent and restarting the download. I don't pretend to understand the technical aspects of all this stuff, but occasionally a torrent in uTorrent gets a little squirrely."
,HenkAjax,2011-08-04T18:51Z,"Ha ha,my name is not torrentnerd (LOL).I'm trying to download it again and still                 a big no.I will try it soon from a different location and different program.Sadly enough this only happens if I want to see films like these."
