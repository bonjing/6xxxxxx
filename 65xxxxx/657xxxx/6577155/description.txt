Were it not for two Philosophical Pillars, two Readings by the young law student in the UK, we would not today know the name GANDHI.  

1. UNTO THIS LAST - is one of those two readings that profoundly shaped Gandhis lifelong view of the deadly injustice, barbarity, inhumanity, and unsustainability  rooted in western economic systems.  It gave him a vision of what humane, sustainable economics should be.

2. His other Pillar - The Kingdom of God is Within You, Leo Tolstoy [based on Tolstoys own Gospel translation from the Greek - The Gospel in Brief, Hapgood translation, this channel].
