         The fear of a previous case is putting Jane and the rest      
         of the department on edge since a pattern of child murders    
         has given authorities reason to believe that a police         
         officer's kidnapped daughter has only a small amount of       
          time left to live.

         TNT fucked up the audio for a few minutes on the original     
         broadcast leaving echoes in the dialog. This is from the      
          rerun which seems to be free of such crap.
