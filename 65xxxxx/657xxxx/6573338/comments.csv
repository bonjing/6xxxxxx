,rising4u,2011-08-03T16:42Z,doesn't  anyone has better print of Thor by now ?
,Rumour,2011-08-04T20:18Z,"Yeah it is really sad that this has been out on DVD for ages, and there are only TS copies available still. I think what happened was a whole bunch of Thor movies and games with variations of the Thor titles, all in 2011, and that has confused people. Some people have probably watched the Asylum version and thought that was the one in the cinema or something.

Wake me up when a good hi-res copy comes up will ya."
