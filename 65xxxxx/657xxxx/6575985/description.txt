        KILLER CONCERT TURNS DEADLY...

        Sydney Harbour,  Australia -  one of  the most  breathtakingly
        beautiful  places  on earth.  It's  the setting  for  the Rock
        Island Festival an annual three days of internationall  bands,
        DJ's, sunshine and good  times. Food, music, romance,  million
        -dollar views. Camping under the stars. Gorgeous young  people
        from all over the world.

        Twenty-four hours before the  festival begins, a deadly  virus
        is discovered in Sydney.  The symptoms are shocking:  death is
        swift and painful.

        State  Health Emergency  co-ordinator Jim  Quinn believes  the
        virus has found its perfect environment - on Rock Island.  Jim
        is intelligent, honest  and courageous, and  therefore totally
        out  of place  among the  appalling low-lifes  who govern  the
        State. Jim is the first to understand the threat posed by  the
        virus, and he's the  only person galvanised into  developing a
        plan of action. But in the corridors of power, he is  isolated
        and overruled. The  festival's a money  spinner for the  State
        Government  and  they're not  about  to tell  Joe  Public that
        there's a killer virus loose in their city. They'll fight  Jim
        every step of the way.

        Time is  running out.  People are  dying. Jim  battles to shut
        down  the  festival  and  enforce  quarantine.  He  knows  his
        daughter is on the island working as a police officer and then
        discovers that his son has gone there too, in secret.

        As the body  count on the  island begins to  rise, Jim becomes
        desperate. He plays dirty, calls in the Army without authority
        and teams up  with a maverick  colonel named Wilson  who knows
        how to get things done.  But can Wilson be trusted?.  Suddenly
        Sydney Harbour is a war zone and events spin out of control in
        the Panic at Rock Island.
