Information
------------------------------

Extreme Engineering unveils some of the most ambitious architectural plans of our times. Some are theoretical; others are in the works. But each of these modern marvels poses challenges that stretch the definition of what's possible. Watch as jaw-dropping computer animation and first-hand accounts from builders, designers and engineers breathe life into the most extreme construction projects ever conceived.

Head to one of the hottest regions on the planet - United Arab Emirates - for a look at the coolest engineering project yet: a ski resort in the middle of a desert. Rising from the sea of sand that surrounds the Arabian peninsula's most vibrant city, this impressive concrete structure will use 23 massive air conditioners to maintain an indoor temperature of 30 degrees Fahrenheit - in a country where the average high temperature reaches the low 100s in the summer months.

But before the five ski slopes and multiple half pipes can be opened to the public, engineers must finish installing the upper portion of the resort. With the foundation and most of the ground-level attractions complete, the goal is to raise the 4,000-ton top-level section and carefully fit it into place. Watch as workers slowly hoist the structure off the desert floor, using a complex system of steel cables - all the while monitoring the ascent for any sign of buckling or cracking in the straining steel.
