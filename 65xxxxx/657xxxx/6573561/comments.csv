Come on here! EVERYONE wants that movie, and not one single person, on any of the torrent sites, has posted a REAL version of it! They're all fakes. Then we look to you guys and other top uploaders, and your posting discovery channel stuff? No offense but we all have discovery channel, and normally i would download this, but im stopping all downloads till i find Cowboys and Aliens! Lets go meng!"
