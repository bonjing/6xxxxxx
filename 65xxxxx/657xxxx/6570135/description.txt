Born in Edmonton Alberta, Paul attended W. P. Wagner High School and is currently an Education student at the University of Alberta. Paul received his first acoustic guitar at the age of 10, but was unable to play it because it was right-handed. Frustrated, Paul did not take up the guitar again until age 12,[2] when his family purchased him a left-handed guitar. After two years of lessons, Cresey began to work on finger-picking techniques and new strumming patterns and groomed his passion for folk music. Cresey formed a two person acoustic guitar duo called The Lefties and subsequently joined a four person band called Four Leaf Clover (the name was not completely decided upon by all members). These bands performed mostly acoustic and classic rock cover songs. Creseyâ€™s first on stage performance was not a success and left him unable to perform in front of an audience for quite some time. With some gentle prodding from friends and family, Cresey was able to take to the stage once again. The first gig that really sparked his interest in performing was at a Kenilworth Junior High School talent show in front of an audience of around 500 people.
