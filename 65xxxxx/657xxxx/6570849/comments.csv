,wild321,2011-07-29T22:20Z,"now the arrogance and overweening pride personified with name PRITHWI RAJ can sit back. even the cd wouldn't give him any revenue. what hallaballoo for this mediocre film. poor plot, poor execution, but vainglorious propoganda. malayalis know the place of this idiotic prithwi raj. what can he be proud of except the fact that he is just a pin-up and no good actor with great limitations. he is all acting, not behaving. thanks again for the uploader who exels in many such.

,wild321,2011-07-31T22:46Z,"DEAR ""oo7bondoo7'
  I am no blind fan of LAL or mammooti. ONE SURE AGREES with prithwi raj that if the industry has to come up trumps, directors and writers must have more leeway and freedom, not bonded by these superstars. but dont forget the enormous contribution by LAL AND SPECIALLY MAMMOOTI the latters memorable roles in many a film have been world class. but one is so confused: Does Prithwi Raj boast of any role worthy of being carried away through generations. one suspects. but his posture in interviews is that of a guy who assumes giftedness. mate, as all know malayalam industry is a conundrum for art and artists. larger than life image of LAL and MAMMOOTI IS POKING FUN AT THEMSELVES, HIGH TIME THEY REALISED THAT. SO POOR THAT directors like RENJITH ENSLAVE ART AND BE SYCOPHANT TO THESE actor kings"
