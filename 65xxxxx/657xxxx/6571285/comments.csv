Nice try with the ps3 compatible in all your titles but it's bollox!"
,DarthPS3,2011-07-30T19:26Z,"@blusniffer
 I'm not sure why you feel the need to comment here, unless its to prove that you are an extremely moronic individual who made himself a piratebay account just so he can post annoying ass dumb-fuck comments like that. 
 I upload pre-muxed tv shows and movies, most of which are incompatible to be played on a PS3 system because they are .mkv or otherwise not capable of play. 
 So, if you could just tell me how many times your dumb shit whore-slut of a mother dropped you on your head and then stuck your head in her filthy cunt to deprive you of oxygen while shoving your dads cock up your ass, then I will know exactly how and why you are so stupid and retarded, possibly the most so of any human being I have ever met in my entire life. 
 Scum like you needs to be erased."
,blusniffer,2011-07-31T04:45Z,"Lol did i hit a nerve re-uploader?
People want pb to get movies as quick as possible for free, what they don't want is to know is the meaningless shit behind it, Whats next how many toilet breaks you had between uploading!
U can make paedophilia comments but i criticise your upload and i'm scum+ should be erased! LMAO"
,blusniffer,2011-07-31T04:52Z,"Why are you trying to delete your Battle LA torrent thats ""PS3 COMPATIBLE""?? lol

More bullshit that doesn't  play on ps3  even after i tried muxing the torrent myself.

Cue the sado-masochistic paedophilia retort!"
,DarthPS3,2011-07-31T07:36Z,"Oh my god dude, you are such a freaking loser. If you don't want the torrent don't download it, ok? "
,DarthPS3,2011-07-31T07:40Z,"And I'm trying to take down my Battle Los Angeles because it doesn't work. At least I can admit it, asshole. And so far like 400 people have downloaded my torrents. The other people that comment on my uploads seem to know what they are talking about and understand what I'm doing. 
You call me a reuploader like its an insult, if that's what I was doing I'd be proud of that too, but I dare you to find files like these anywhere else. 
To close, please go die."
,blusniffer,2011-07-31T09:03Z,"Wowee, from paedophilia to necrophilia lol
For once your right i won't be downloading any of your re-uploads. I commented about battle la not workin and got the same sobbing reply "" your talking shit it does work,try downloading a decent media player idiot ""
The only abusive posts are your own or did they come from BONE, EXTREMEZONE like the torrents! lmao"
,5amjr,2011-07-31T09:06Z,@darthps3 Y upload if ur gonna treat the D'Ls like shit?
,DarthPS3,2011-07-31T09:35Z,Why aren't you dead yet?
,DarthPS3,2011-07-31T09:40Z,"@5amjr
If people are going to shit talk my uploads I'll say what I feel. There's a reason I say not to post stupid comments, which are exactly what blusniffer is guilty of, and that's because I will abuse those stupid enough to do so. 
I use my time and bandwidth uploading this stuff, so as far as I'm concerned, his ""bollox"" is all the knowledge I need to know he's an inbred piece of shit, who most likely rapes women and donkeys alike."
,HatRacks,2011-07-31T12:35Z,Thanks for the fixed upload! And ignore the haters :)
,DarthPS3,2011-07-31T15:37Z,You are very welcome!
,5amjr,2011-08-01T10:38Z,"Fair enough, it's your upload but you wont gain respect from the PB community by replyin to shit feedback with incest put-downs and female rape jibes.
It's free so have to take the good posts with the bad.(my upload id is bricktop)"
,DarthPS3,2011-08-02T04:20Z,"I don't upload these for respect, I upload them to pay back a little of all that I have gotten myself, help a few people out and all that. 
Holy shit, your an awesome uploader! Just for that, I will take your comment more seriously, although just to defend myself, I'm from the dirty D and that's pretty much our general language around here. So if you say something that I find insulting, the general result is usually something along those lines.
...it says Darth in the name for a reason..."
,5amjr,2011-08-03T07:54Z,Where's the dirty D?
,DarthPS3,2011-08-03T18:45Z,"Lol, sorry, Detroit, Michigan. I was just hanging out with a few of my friends last night and was noticing the language we were using was almost exactly along the lines of what I wrote here. Cultural norms and whatnot I guess. I don't care, I learned my lesson, I'm just gonna post my torrents and keep to myself."
