Lenore - The Cute Little Dead Girl [SLG]
By: Roman Dirge

Take a trip into the dark, surreal world of a little dead girl with a knack 
for (often) unintentional mayhem in this gothic classic.

Lenore might only be small, but her talent for mischief â€” and occasional 
wanton destruction â€” is anything but. Featuring stories about limbless 
cannibals, clock monsters, cursed vampire dolls, taxidermied friends, 
an obssesed would-be lover and more fuzzy animal mutilations than should 
be legal, never has the term "something for everyone" seemed more sinister 
and bizarre.

A massive cult hit on both sides of the Atlantic, Lenore is one of the 
funniest, darkest, cutest, creepiest characters on the marketplace today.


Contains:
Lenore Volume 1: Issues #1 - 13
Lenore Volume 2 (ongoing): #1 - 3

To clear up any confusion; Lenore was also released in 3 Book Volumes: 
Noogies (Issues 1-4), Wedgies (Issues 5-8), and Cooties (Issues 9-12) - All
 of these issues are in this torrent. As for the fabled Issue #14, it is
Volume 2 Issue #1. I dont know how long this new run will go for or when 
new issues will be out, but Ill up them as soon I find them and link here.
- Hope that answers any questions to be posted.
