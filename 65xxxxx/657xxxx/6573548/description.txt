I found I still had the original tarballs for the icons and the "polaris" metacity theme pack. Since Mint already comes with "aurora-midnight" all you really should have to to is drop the two tarballs in the theme manager, copy the wyrdoak-green folder to your home .themes folder. then select the theme from the theme manager.

The polaris metacity theme pack comes with more than just green so that might be good if green isn't your flavor.
