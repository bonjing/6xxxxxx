All praise is due to Allah alone, Who decreed death upon every soul and is the only One Who is Eternally Everlasting; may He send salutations and exalt the mention of the seal of all Prophets and Messengers, our Prophet Mohammad, his family and all his companions and those who follow in their footsteps until the Day of Resurrection.


The Title: Your Day in Ramadan
Language: English
From issues : http://www.rasoulallah.net - Website of Rasoulullah (peace be upon him)

Short Description: This is a useful book talks about how a fasting Muslim should spend his day in Ramadan. This is regarding deeds by which he abides during his day. No doubt he should be eager to instill the good morals into himself while performing this great rite. He should not forget to ask Allah when he breaks his fasting, for Allah promised that he answers the fasting Muslimâ€™s invocation when he breaks his fast. He should remember that it is highly recommended to perform Qiyam (supererogatory prayers at night) to get his sins forgiven.
