,eye_leech,2011-08-25T18:18Z,"I find also that MP4 conversions are a bit buggy too when I load them to  my media player they tend to stop around 3 quarters of the way in every time its the weirdest thing always around 3 quarters of the way into the movie but that isnât your problem. You do great stuff always 

10/10 A & and respectable file size. Thanks for making my life that little bit better.

Will seed for a month as always."

,train_wreq,2012-03-22T04:27Z,also huge english subs across the whole movie. and its still in english.. F-
,mkyl428,2012-04-02T21:40Z,@train_wreq                                                         If you don't like the subs why don't you turn them off dummy

,michaelrwatson,2012-04-07T06:53Z," 1 2 8 0 * 688?  Please don't create video greater than 1024 x YYY, or better yet, 720xYYY. It takes way too much processor power. (and is otherwise pointless).

Btw, those having trouble w/ audio lagging out of sync: it's because your processor can't keep up. YIFY, you furked this one, ya dumbfuk."

michaelrwatson, if whatever machine you're using can't handle that, your shit is SEVERELY outdated. I have zero problems with HD rips or the .mp4 format and my PC/laptop are both about 3 years old. Both are stock, nothing custom and it wasn't personally built. Get your shit together."
,cyberzed,2012-04-12T12:55Z,"Thanks for the effort, much appreciated."
,VirtualVernon,2012-04-20T00:44Z,"If your having a problem playing the MP4, such as trying to play it with windows media player it will not work. Just open the torrent file, right click on the movie file, scroll over open with and choose QuickTime Player. The movie will open up, and start playing automatically with no problems what so ever. =P"
,VirtualVernon,2012-04-20T00:47Z,"You can not play this movie with windows media player. You have to manually open the torrent file, and right click on the movie. Then scroll over open with and choose Quicktime Player. It should automatically open the movie in Quicktime Player, then all you have to do is press play and enjoy. "
,monstero,2012-05-01T12:10Z,This rip didn't play smoothly on nVidia ION. All other YIFY rips I've tried have worked fine.
,PineappleStarz,2012-05-03T07:49Z,"thanks!! good size!
