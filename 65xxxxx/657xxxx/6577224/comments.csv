,ydurla,2011-08-02T10:00Z,"The original seeder should only limit his peer connections to 20max, that way a bigger distribution of size packets would be given to high broadband users that can speed up the transfer. The problem that's going in here, is that the original seeder (uploader) doesn't have it to that setting, therefore he is transfering at 1.5kb per second since he has over 1,000 peers trying to leech from him, and everyone else is stuck at 59.7% and going up slowly."
