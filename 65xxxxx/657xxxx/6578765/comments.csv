,keleieke,2011-08-04T05:03Z,"You should supply as a torrent containing background images (desktop wallpapers) and music used in your packages... especially this one!  There was a song around Christmas I tried to find to no avail; some are sooo good and uncommon.

Can it be assumed you recommend the programz that you provide this way?  Does this blow WinRar away good?"
[V],ChattChitto,2011-08-04T10:47Z,"@keleieke In a way what u say is correct, but its not always the case, like now this software is a little popular so i releases it, but for me WinRAR is still my favorite choice :)"
,kmcarter88,2011-08-04T21:03Z,I can't thank you enough.
,Bladderfish,2011-12-15T02:27Z,As Always... ChattChitto... provides the best!!
,Flyingbox,2011-12-16T22:27Z,I have to know what the music for this program is.
