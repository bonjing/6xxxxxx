,stonelesscutter,2011-08-06T04:05Z,"Don't listen to the guys spouting crap people I've so far watched the first 8 minutes of this and it seems to be pretty good. Ofcourse it's a cam so no dvd quality but it's really very watchable. It doesn't appear to be missing any footage either. But like I said I've only seen the first couple of minutes.
Let all the fuckers like Shoot5i burn and die!"
,Dawn262,2011-08-28T04:18Z,"Hey.  I just watched this and have to send a HUGE hug to scenebalance and all the team at scenetime,  This rocks, as do all the other stuff that has been contributed by this bunch.

  Thank You!"
,Deadspace2000,2011-08-29T11:36Z,"Umm... I dont usually say this but really a waste of time. I say ""waste of time"" because this is the same cam rip from his other torrent that which he obviously doesn't mention 'cam rip'

I wouldn't recommend downloading this unless you like or are confortable watching a cam rip.

Quality: Not watchable because I don't like cam rips.

Audio: Not sure, I stopped once I realized it was another cam rip.

This is the real Transformer 3 but it's a cam just to clarify for some people. "
