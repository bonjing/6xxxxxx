With Seeing Sociology: An Introduction, respected author and award-winning professor Joan Ferrante offers an exciting and fresh introduction to sociology in which the visual and text narratives are profoundly interwoven. Sociology's relevance to daily life is illustrated through the use of everyday images and pictures. These "SocScenes" allow students to read about and visually apply sociological concepts. The easy-to-manage, modular table of contents allows for flexibility and synthesis of information.
