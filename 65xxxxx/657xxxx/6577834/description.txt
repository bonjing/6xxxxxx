Summary: 
Loud is the fifth studio album by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna, first released on November 12, 2010 by Def Jam Recordings. The album was an altogether complete musical change from her previous release, Rated R (2009), which featured a prominently foreboding and angry tone with dark themes, with elements of hip hop, rock, and dubstep music genres. Loud focused more on up-tempo and pop related genres, ranging from dance-pop to Electro-R&B, and marks her return to her dancehall roots, which was prominent on her earlier releases Music of the Sun (2005) and A Girl like Me (2006), whilst also incorporating other genres, such as rock in "California King Bed" and reggae in the Carribean inspired "Man Down".
