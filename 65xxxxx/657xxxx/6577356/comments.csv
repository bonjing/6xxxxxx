,Ezkriel,2011-08-17T09:13Z,"I get nothing but a big grey screen when i go to watch this film, not sure why, anyone got any idea why this might be? "
,DontPissMeOff,2011-08-18T11:55Z,"When is tpb going to sort out this pseudo highres uploads issue? This movie is in wrong category. If the uploader doesn't understand the word ""highres"" HERE'S A DEFINITION from a dictionary:
1. Relating to an image that has FINE detail.
2. Of or relating to an output device that produces images that contain a large number of dots per unit of area and are therefore SHARP and DETAILED.
This film is neither fine, sharp nor detailed. Stop trashing highres category with this low quality shit."
,northeastgroova202,2011-08-20T11:44Z,@michedid kno where i can find english subtitles? cuz the link isnt for english sus
,MPAAss,2011-08-20T23:10Z,"I never understood, how can a 720p file be only 700MB?!

That's awesome. How is it done? Is getting a 4GB file better? (I'm watching from a 15-inch laptop.)"
,buetforasif,2011-08-22T00:08Z,bad audio... please upload the retail version that's just released.
,urgosol,2011-08-22T18:46Z,"1. this is a great quality rip, especially for being only 700mb. stop trashing it.
2. the .txt file included is the subtitles AND they work fine when using vlc. 
look around a little bit before posting things"
,widgetsdaddy,2011-08-23T19:54Z,Good quality EXCEPT there is a buzzing and hissing behind the sound that remains throughout all of the film.
,vinyasrao,2011-09-17T20:31Z,"Video 10/10

Movie 5/10"
,tylermayhem,2011-09-24T12:20Z,"I loved this movie. V10, A8-9 (a little background noise at first), M10.  Beautiful scenes, fights and firearms tactics: believable; and great casting: Ronan carries ball, Bana and Blanchet block: TD.

Attention Whiners:  Please stop arguing and complaining in comments.  Review, go somewhere else or go buy it.  Please, Just Shut Up.  Most of us just want to watch a movie. "
,painkilleradnan,2011-11-07T19:41Z,"A 7/10
V 9.5/10"
,dogshark,2011-12-26T04:24Z,"Um Guys. A v10 rating would indicate you are watching a cinema grade projection or blu ray.

This is a rip. if you rated it anything over 8 your lying. Please don't give misleading reviews."
,Jabnit,2012-03-04T19:46Z,"@DontPissMeOff
