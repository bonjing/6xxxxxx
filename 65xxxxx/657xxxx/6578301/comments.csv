So, if you really liked the content, consider supporting the producers and buy an original so they can continue to produce their stuff. Some have a very good quality and are quite affordable. It's a way to show our gratitude. Take it as a try before buy."

,Narok_Gull,2011-08-16T19:19Z,"Hi! It seems that some people is having problems on this torrent. I am still seeding it and I have it at 100% so, I don't know what's really faulty in it. True I've been some days off but I suppose that there must be other seeders around. Anyway, I will try to figure out how to redo the torrent and re-upload it if it's really faulty."
,Narok_Gull,2011-08-17T14:55Z,"Does anybody know how do I Edit/Delet the link to replace the torrent file? When I click on ""EDIT"" TPB answers that edit is temporarily disabled."
,Narok_Gull,2011-08-17T15:48Z,"Well, I re-up Inductions with another name. Look for my ""FDH_MKate - Indu compressed"". Now it's the original zipfile embedded in a rar fil. I don't know why but TPB was not allowing me to upload a zipfile torrent and so I had to put it into a rar file. I hope it works. Consider this one deceased and go for the other, pls."
