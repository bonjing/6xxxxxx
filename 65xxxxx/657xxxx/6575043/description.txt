Tony Stark travels to Japan to supervise the construction of an Arc Station. 
The next day, he meets the test-pilots hoping to pilot Iron Man Dio, which 
will replace Tony when he retires from being Iron Man. Tony later holds a 
public event to show off the new model. However, during the event, something 
goes wrong with the Dio and he crashes. When one of the pilots tests it later, 
he gets brainwashed and attacks the other pilots. Tony equips his classic 
Iron Man armor and manages to defeat it. However, he is attacked by a strange 
warrior named Scorpio who comes from an order called the Zodiac. 
Tony defeats him, but the Dio armor disappears.
