this new patch update will advertice you if you use blacklisted serial and won't install by this fact anyway.preserve your valid serial by using your soft by always using it offline and be sure to always close your TM server icone as well to avoid online server checker from Arcsoft.Any new patch update must absolutely be installed offline too.
Great thx to Anacondaz for his valid serial by far as well anyway :)
Please,preserve this serial as long as you can by following our tips !
thx by advance.
I repeat : all must be absolutely installed offline !
You can also block ""TM server.exe service"" by your firewall :
it will avoid you to be regulary scanned online by Arcsoft server checker to check if your serial is valid or if it has been stolen or else.(highly recommended)
GL to all so !
cheers ;)"

thank you for TotalMedia Theatre 5.1.1.114 patch updates."
,Shah_Jahan,2011-08-22T15:16Z,"I updated to version 5.1.1.114 and it still works on Windows 7 Ultimate x64, thank you Anacondaz.

First, DISCONNECT FROM INTERNET.
Install Arcsoft TotalMedia Theatre and reboot
Then install Patch and when it asks to reboot, don't reboot just yet.
Open windows 'run' command and type 'msconfig' and then click on the Startup tab and untick to disable TM Sever (this is to disable it from auto-starting everytime with Windows) and click Apply and OK
Now reboot.

It should now be running and registered ;-)

PS: I would suggest that you download and install the 114 patch since it is the latest and works."
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-08-24T11:54Z,"yeah,this is the best way,exactly to run in safe mod as still registered.excellent tips dude

,FailedSuicideAttempt-,2011-10-03T00:53Z,"Just wanted to say thank you to a cpl of you.  Anacondaz for the post; 

@Tyr3ll thanks you have been very helpful across about 5 of these threads including some you uploaded.  Pretty kewl that you linked to this thread too when Ur last one had a problem.  

@Shah_Jahan - thanks for dumbing it down to my level with your step by step.  I would have missed the msconfig stopping the auto TM server part.

People like you keep TPB great.  Note, I really would have supported Arcsoft financially but $99 bucks?!?  Even with a coupon I got from buying from them before, the best I could find was $70.  Old versions used to go on sale at N.E. for $40-$50 for the Platinum + SimHD + ... when they were seperate components in version 3.  
But $70 bucks is too much."
,jimmyjojr,2011-10-05T10:06Z,"Many thanks for this. 

Does anyone know where I can find Arcsoft's Showbiz 5? "
