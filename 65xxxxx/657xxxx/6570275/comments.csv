,skywalker993,2011-08-18T03:25Z,"When will someone put up an AVI of this episode? This is the only upload and it's in 20 pieces, not a chance."
,axsys,2011-08-19T07:34Z,Why is everyone complaining about it being it RARs? It took 2 minutes to download and 30 seconds to unrar it.
,RogerX2VectorVictor,2011-08-22T04:47Z,"First take a toke and don't choke, extract RAR/Zip file and play....wow that was easy~~~~"
,blackhawks47,2011-09-10T05:21Z,"what i don't get is since once you extract the rars, you can take the avi file out of the directory and delete everything else, so why don't they just upload that file to begin with? 

but like others have said, its not a big deal at all, thanks for upload"
