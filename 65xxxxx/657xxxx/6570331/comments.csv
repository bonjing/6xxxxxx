Your sense of smell must be messed up pretty bad.  

Scenebalance is a VIP group on piratebay.

This isn't scenebalance's first time uploading. 

Scenebalance is the group that TvTeam created when TvTeam started uploaded no-rar torrents.  Scenebalance uploads the same torrents, in rar version usually at the exact same time as TvTeam. (when in doubt about a scenebalance torrent, which is retarded to be in doubt, just see if TvTeam uploaded a similar torrent within a few minutes of scenebalance.)

Scenebalance always uploads rar files.  

They also always upload the torrents EXACTLY as the scene group distributed them, thus the mislabeled s02 ep11.

Must be your first time on TPB. Welcome to the world of P2P.  You should read some tutorials to help get you started."
