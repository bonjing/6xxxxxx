               Native Instruments Traktor Pro 2 v2.0.3 B10893 (Full)



Native Instruments Traktor Pro 2/Traktor Scratch Pro 2 v2.0.3 Build 10893 (Full)
System Requirements: Windows XP (32 Bit)/Vista (32/64 Bit)/Windows 7 (32/64 Bit)
Release date: July 2011


TRAKTOR PRO 2 is the world-renowned, rock-solid 4-deck DJ program that gets you 
mixing right away.

TRAKTOR SCRATCH PRO 2 combines the full-featured Traktor Pro software with the 
acclaimed AUDIO 10 DJ interface and a set of high-resolution time-code records 
and CDs for extremely responsive hands-on control through turntables and CD decks.

TRAKTOR SCRATCH PRO 2 lets you spin digital files on four track decks using 
super-tight vinyl and CD control. The next generation of the award-winning 
digital vinyl system is easier to use than ever.
Set it up in seconds thanks to the included TRAKTOR AUDIO 10.

The TruWave hi-res colored waveforms and new, simplified user interface give you 
a new perspective on your mix and allow for instant creativity with the Sample 
Decks, Loop Recorder and studio-quality effects. 
 
Now with TRAKTOR 2 Technology Inside, this version boasts a new interface with 
TruWave colored waveforms for a visually rich experience of your music.

Simpler than ever to use, TRAKTOR PRO 2 also sees the arrival of the new 
Sample Decks and Loop Recorder features for ultimate mix creativity. 

TRAKTOR's intelligent features now allow for even easier remixing of tracks 
on the fly.
Switch any deck to a Sample Deck and load up to four loops or one-shot samples 
each - 16 in total.

The new Loop Recorder can record loops from mixer channels, master out or audio 
interface inputs, while four much-requested new effects, including Tape Delay 
and Bouncer, round out the arsenal to more than 30 performance effects.

All crucial performance functions like cueing and looping have been revised and 
refined in Traktor Pro for fast and intuitive handling in a performance situation,
while extensive cover artwork support including the innovative "Crate Flick" 
feature allows DJs to visually browse their music library in a new and especially 
efficient way.

Advanced syncing functions in Traktor Pro give DJs more 
time to focus on the creative aspects of their performance.

Precise beat grids are now created automatically for all tracks, and the 
"Sync Lock" function makes sure that even multiple decks and tempo-synced 
effects never drift out of sync.

New "quantized navigation" also allows DJs to seamlessly jump between loops, 
cue points or any other part of a track without missing a beat, offering huge 
potential for the spontaneous rearranging of entire tracks, beatjuggling and 
similar techniques.

Traktor Pro also opens up vast new possibilities for creative sound manipulation, 
with a powerful performance effects section that is both extremely versatile and 
highly accessible.

Two separate multi-effect units offer more than twenty studio-quality algorithms, 
from a full range of standard DJ effects to a wide selection of unusual effect 
types like "Mulholland Drive", "Iceverb" and "Reverse Grain" that can easily 
add a unique sonic twist to every set.

Up to six effects can be chained and freely assigned to any number of decks 
at any time, and can be effortlessly synced to tempo in all circumstances.

To give DJs the maximum level of control over their performance, Traktor Pro 
offers state-of-the-art MIDI controller integration, and comes with mappings 
for all relevant DJ controllers on the market.

New "MIDI modifier" functionality provides even finer performance control, 
allowing for dynamic and multi-layered knob and fader assignments, on-the-fly 
adjustments of parameter resolution and much more. Furthermore, new extended 
MIDI sync features make it easy to seamlessly integrate outboard gear like 
drum machines and software sequencers into the mix.


TRAKTOR DJ programs offer total flexibility
-------------------------------------------
Use the NI TRAKTOR KONTROL X1, other manufacturers' controllers, 
or your keyboard and mouse to control the software.

You can also expand TRAKTOR with MASCHINE
This Groove Production Studio can be synced with TRAKTOR, or used as a controller.

The new Auto Detection makes connecting and disconnecting your NI 
audio interface easy - even while there are tracks playing in TRAKTOR.
Assisted by the Setup Wizard, just select your interface and it assigns 
inputs and outputs for you.

TRAKTOR PRO 2 is highly customizable with multiple, saveable layouts 
and flexible hot key selection to suit your needs.

Crate Flick cover art browsing and full iTunes and iPod integration makes 
finding the right track effortless.

TRAKTORâ€™s acclaimed sync concept ensures that your tunes beat-match perfectly 
so you can focus on the more exciting performance aspects of DJing.

TRAKTOR PRO 2's built-in mixer integrates multiple EQ and filter types, giving 
you full control of the frequency spectrum.


New Features:
-------------
Optimized user interface + TruWave
With an easy on the eye interface, including Essential View and the new TruWave 
hi-res colored waveforms, TRAKTOR software is now easier to use than ever.

* TruWave waveforms offer a whole new dimension to your mix - differentiate 
  between kicks, hi-hats and snares and anticipate your mix
* Thanks to various zoom levels, set up tighter cue points than ever before
* The overview of the whole track ("stripe") clearly displays the track's 
  arrangement with full detail
* New layouts, including Essential View for maximum ease-of-use when using 
  TRAKTOR with external mixer and controller(s)

Sample Decks
With the innovative Sample Decks containing four slots each, you can enter the 
world of live remixing and editing in ways unimaginable before.

* Grab and layer your own loops or use the included loop content. 
  Create one-shot samples or use the included DJ Craze scratch sounds
* Grab loops live out of a running deck, store your favorites in the 
  loop library, and develop your own arsenal of beats and sounds
* Layer up loops in perfect sync with the decks
* PRO versions only: Tweak the volume and filter 
  for each Sample Deck slot separately
* PRO versions only: 2 different sizes for the Sample Decks; each of the 4 decks 
  can be switched from track deck to Sample Deck and vice versa, on the fly

New Effects
TRAKTOR PRO 2 adds 4 stunning, much-requested new effects, taking the total to 32, 
all syncing to track or master tempo.

* Tape Delay, Ramp Delay, Bouncer and Auto Bouncer join the arsenal of 
  professional DJ effects, taking the potential for sound mangling to the extreme
* With a multi-channel audio interface such as the TRAKTOR AUDIO 10 you can now 
  use TRAKTOR effects as an independent send / receive effects unit

Loop Content
TRAKTOR 2 software includes amazing loops and sounds from 
in-demand sound providers for use with the new Sample Decks.

* 40 original loops and 10 full tracks drawn from Loopmasters' new 
  DJ Mixtools series, plus additional scratch sounds by DMC Champ DJ Craze
* Drum, bass, percussion and synth loop in dubstep, minimal, house, techno 
  and trance styles
* Grab loops from any playing track in seconds, and save them in the loop library

Loop Recorder
With the brand-new Loop Recorder in the PRO 2 versions of TRAKTOR, you can record 
live loops from any channel (single or multiple), the live input feeds, or the 
master output.

* Trigger the recording using a foot pedal, a DJ controller such as 
  TRAKTOR KONTROL X1 or a keyboard hot key
* Overdub on top of the running loop in real time, creating additional 
  layers and heightening dramatic FX buildups and peaks
* Works like a 5th deck.

You can transfer the layered loop into a Sample Deck slot instantly, 
freeing up the Loop Recorder for further use

*** When using TPB please read these important notes: 
-----------------------------------------------------

01. AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02. To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03. If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantine then look at History or something similar).

04. To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6091044/

05. Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06. Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07. Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08. Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09. Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10. Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11. In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12. In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13. Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

14. Comments are welcome, unlike ranting, trolling, whining, etc.

15. No Promises ... No Debts!

This torrent is scanned with:
1. Norton Internet Security 
2. Avira AntiVir Premium 
3. avast! Pro Antivirus
4. Kaspersky Antivirus

Also scanned with some well known antispyware, and tested in Sandboxie.
Malware detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally 
posting fake comments & files. Their meaning is just trying to spread 
confusion and to frustrate TPB and it's users. 
Less downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
