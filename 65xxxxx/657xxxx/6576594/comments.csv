,romantes,2011-08-03T09:49Z,"Stopped at 99,86%. I think it is a fake torrent. Some ideas?"
,zipp21,2011-08-03T11:20Z,"shaqqid why are you not seeding? Oh, I know - because you are fuc-ing  f.ggot. And for others: don't waste your time - this torrent is scam."

,bachuarg,2011-08-03T17:52Z,"I forgot... Anno 1404 is a game, not an app, so next time you upload something put it where it goes."
,shaqqid,2011-08-03T17:57Z,Don't be such a little prick about it. I'm sure you can find other ways to waste your time than playing a stupid game. 
,aficion,2011-08-03T22:56Z,Thanks for the effort Shaqqid.  Don't let the people with childish anger management issues get to you.  Everyone screws this stuff up the first couple of times!
,Spamer52,2011-11-08T21:58Z,Why is nobody seeding?
