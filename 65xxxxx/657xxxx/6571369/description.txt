[TUT]How to hack Facebook, Gmail, Yahoo, Twitter, Skype, Hotmail, Youtube Accounts 
Hello in this guide I'm going to explain how you can know another person's password for ANY account he has! This guide is working and not a scam but its for educational purposes only!

Questions:

Q: Any mail? even sites that aren't listed?
A: Yes

Q: What is a keylogger?
A: A keylogger or a keystroke logger is a hacktool used for sending all keys the user types by Mail or FTP ( File Transfer Protocol ).

Q: Will Anti-Virus block it?
A: Depends if some people upload the hacktool to online virus scanners which will make it detected! ( don't do that if you do you just ruined people's hours of programming. )
