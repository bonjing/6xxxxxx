He has earned the privilege of playing with outstanding musicians including
Sting, Chick Corea, Pat Metheny and has been recognized by Eric Clapton.
Rodrigo has impressed audiences with his outstanding ability to play different styles of music including Spanish, Latin, Brazilian, Blues, and North American. In addition to his versatility, his technical spectrum includes flat-picking, open tunings and a percussive approach to guitar techniques.
The new CD, which is arranged, performed, and produced entirely by Rodrigo, demonstrates his ability not only as a sensitive player but as a gifted composer. Caminos (Roads) delivers a remarkable display of intricate guitar techniques and complex rhythmic patters coupled with intense emotion.

My Sigmund's guitar , a nylon stringed guitar equipped with an incredible pick-ups system called B-Band , is my beauty. Custom made for me by my good friend Sigmund Johanesen, it plays beautiful, Spruce top, Yellow Cedar back and sides, Mahogany neck and Purple Heart fretboard are the woods used on this amazing instrument.
My Godin multiac, great guitar! I've had it for quiet a while ,I never get tired of it, I love the action, my friend Roger Xavier fixed the action for me, it plays amazing.
Sigmund's guitars, I call it Picnic guitar, you finish playing it and you can put your drinks on it. A beautiful stereo sounding instrument, spruce top and its oversized body on the back of it it gives you that full rich sound of an all rounded tonalities that you can feel it in your chest. I recorded most of the stringed parts of the songs in my album Caminos, so you know., this guitar is featured on tracks 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10. Enjoy the tracks.
Recording with Yamaha GC5F from Yamaha, a flamenco model limited edition that sounds like no other guitar I've heard, I have compared this guitar with some big named flamenco guitars and what can I say this guitar just sings by itself, Spruce top, yellow Cedar back and sides and very very thin, I can see my hand trough it if I put it against the light. I recorded it on tracks number 2, 4, 6, 8 and soloing on track 9.
