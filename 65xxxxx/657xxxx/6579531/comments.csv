This upload is ruined. Thanks though."

The music is insanely loud, while the voices are extremely low.

You have to turn it up real loud to be able to hear what they are saying, and then the music and sound effects will be blasting so the whole neighborhood can hear it."
,spifkitten99,2011-08-29T00:23Z,"fenque, it's NOT wrong aspect ratio."
,fenque,2011-08-29T09:27Z,"I'm sorry but the aspect ratio is wrong. It shouldn't be 16:9, but 2.35:1

From blu-ray.com:
-Aspect ratio: 2.44:1
-Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1 

From imdb.com:
-Aspect Ratio: 2.35 : 1

There seems to be a new upload with the correct aspect ratio. Check it out."
