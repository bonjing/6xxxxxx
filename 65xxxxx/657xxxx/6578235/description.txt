Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne is a role-playing game for the PlayStation 2. It is the third main game in the Megami Tensei series. Shin Megami Tensei III was released nine years after Shin Megami Tensei II, and was the first Megaten game in the series to be released into the United States using the "Megami Tensei" name. Revelations: Persona, though released in 1996 under the Megami Tensei name, is a spin-off of the primary series.

The player takes control of a half-human half-demon silent protagonist whom the player names. The protagonist is often referred to as the "Demi-fiend" (or "Hitoshura" in the original Japanese version) among fans to avoid confusion.
