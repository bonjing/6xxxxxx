All praise is due to Allah alone, Who decreed death upon every soul and is the only One Who is Eternally Everlasting; may He send salutations and exalt the mention of the seal of all Prophets and Messengers, our Prophet Mohammad, his family and all his companions and those who follow in their footsteps until the Day of Resurrection.

Language: English
Format: PDF
Formation : Muhammad Naasiruddeen al-Albaanee
Translators : Abu Maryam Ismaeel Alarcon

Short Description: A most rewarding and fulfilling part of a Muslim\'s worship are those blessed moments that he spends praying in the depth of the night, privately addressing his Great Lord, sincerely glorifying Him, humbly imploring Him - beseeching His forgiveness and asking Him for favors. The voluntary \"night prayer\", or qiyaam, is indispensable for a person\'s moral, spiritual, and physical welfare. Yet, it is greatly misunderstood and largely neglected by most Muslims
