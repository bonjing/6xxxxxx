An analyst hunched over his light table, poring over a series of aerial photographs. The date was August 30, 1962, and he worked for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Americaâ€™s primary spy organization that had come into existence in the late 1940s, during the early days of the Cold War. Since the end of World War II the United States and its Western allies had been engaged in a conflict of words, ideas, and infl uence against the Communist-led Soviet Union. With the Soviets seemingly intent on extending the infl uence and philosophy of Communism around the world, the United States was equally intent on stopping that advance. Sometimes this confl ict pitted the U.S. president directly against the Soviet premier. Sometimes agents for both governments spied on each other. Sometimes the Cold War broke out in a â€œhotâ€ war as in the military action taken during the early 1950s in Korea.
