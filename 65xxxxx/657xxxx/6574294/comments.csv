,bearskin,2011-07-31T20:39Z,Good quality and sound for a cam. A/V 7 or so
,zer0punk,2011-07-31T21:12Z,does this include the trailer after the credits?
,bearskin,2011-07-31T22:38Z,"I take back my ""review"". The video is Ok but the sound is not so good. It's viewable though.

The subtitles are horrid, looks like a chinese goldfarmer translated it via a google translator. If the translator is this bad in english i feel sorry for him. All movies he watch unsubbed must be like watching a psychedelic movie while experiencing an acid trip.

Cheers."
