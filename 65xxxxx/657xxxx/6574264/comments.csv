PS- I realised a lot of users feel that this torrent is of too big size,pls only select the application you need on your torrent client."

Simply load the torrent into your torrent client and don't tamper with the upload option, you can then seed for the torrent."
,z4uQxYa4,2011-08-20T18:01Z,"Damn dawg, 52 plus GB is a monster sized download... don't get me wrong, the program list is utterly amazing and without a doubt highly coveted stuff (I know I would love to have my system sporting all them). The only question I have is, once they are all downloaded, is each and every program useable or do you have Keygens included or serials for each one or what? If this is just what you are espousing, I am all over this like a fat-kid on a Smartie... I'll seed this until the cows come how. Just let a brotha know about the cracks, keygens and serial question. "

Rest assured that every single applications included in this collection has a working keygen (I do not include applications with cracks as cracks are easily fixed). A serial and keygen is definitely included to guarantee a running application. Glad to hear that this torrent is appreciated, but i only managed to upload 10GB+, long way to go pal.
