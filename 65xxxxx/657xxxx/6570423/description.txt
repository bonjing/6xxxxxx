  Set in the underbelly of Mumbai; in the      
  notorious by-lanes where 'Greed is a         
  Culture' and 'Deceit becomes a Compulsion'   
  'Bhindi Baazaar Incorporation' revolves      
  around gangs of pickpockets who consider     
  pick pocketing as an art. They use their     
  intelligence as a canvas and their           
  spontaneity as a brush to survive in this    
  dangerous lively hood. 'Bhindi Baazaar Inc.' 
  is the story of a pawn and his calculated    
  moves to reach the end of the chessboard.    
  Revolving around a crime syndicate who are   
  in the business of pickpocket, the film      
  starts with a game of chess between two      
  characters 'Shroff' and 'Darzi'. Each move   
  unfolds their story and eventually the       
  motive of their meeting. The story unravels  
  the quest of a small time pickpocket 'Fateh' 
  next in line to be a MAMU (local area-head).
