 The series sees different company executivesgoing undercover in their own     
 businesses to ensure that their companies are fighting fit.                   
                                                                               
 Kevin McCullough goes back to the floor at his company NPower, one of the UK's
 leading utility providers. Although the company generates up to 15 per cent of
 the nation's power at any one time, a recent survey revealed only a quarter of
 customers are satisfied. The chief operating officer spends time with the busy
 customer service team, seeing what his employees have to put up with, and how 
 he can regain the respect of both staff and consumers.
