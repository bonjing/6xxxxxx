,jbob75,2011-08-12T14:58Z,"If the serial given wouldn't work, try merging using a .REG file with the following contents:

; --------------------------------
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ImTOO\Video Converter Ultimate 6\RegInfo]
""Name""=""@ByteArray(4A656C6C79426F62)""

,CirusVirus,2011-08-31T12:13Z,"do this and it will work
OK people Very Very easy to solve the problem!!
first in program folder their is vc.exe program
on win7 create block rule for this inbound and outbound
first step done
second step is to change some reg key
open regedit and navigate to
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID\{0BB6C95A-CE6C-425a-84F2-EB211CD1A90A}]
change values for those as you can see
""440D54AA8AF58E3D""=""1A""
""580950B697F5823D87""=""194D31F5CEB1D37DD187""
""481244AA97E58A29""=""1B""
""5E0E54A082F8883F97D844""=""1B""
""5918569797E09F35""=""1A""
and delete all the other keys
start imtoo and see the unregistered is gone!!!!!!!!!!
now if you blocked the vc.exe via fire wall it cant check if the serial is ok so it will not chnage the state of the program back to unregistered
Enjoy:)"
