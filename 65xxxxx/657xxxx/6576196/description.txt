Episode: Without Warning

18 year old apprentice plumber Regan OÂ´Donoghue was walking home from a hall party when the unthinkable happened. A car came out of nowhere, veered to the right hand side of the road and mowed Regan down. The driver briefly stopped to check Regan and then sped off into the dark. Was Regan deliberately and maliciously killed? Was the driver alone? Or do another people know about the hit and run? Can the psychics bring peace to ReganÂ´s grieving family and heal the wounds of a tight-knit farming community?
