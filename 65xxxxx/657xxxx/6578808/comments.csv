you can use the program without it."
[V],nikita200,2011-08-03T07:22Z,"@ All Newbies : Keygens / Toolkits / Patches / Cracks are generally flagged as Malwares / Trojans / Virus / Spyware by almost all the Antivirus Programs, but the vast majority are False Positives ( ie harmless). So, Turnoff your Antivirus while using them OR alternatively go to the Home Site of the program you have come to TPB to download and keep your Credit Card handy and download the original software and pay for it ( through you nose or your arse - I don't care !)."
,dee_mer80,2011-08-03T08:57Z,"@ nikita200, thanks for your advice,so as for the upload..

,arigatokuzaimas,2011-09-15T16:53Z,"gauravkaushik;

as said by nikita200, you gotta turn off your AV.  some of the patch or what so ever detected as virus by the AV. they made like that so you wont dwnload it. some of 'em is false positive but some of it is damn true virus. nikita got the green skull so i believe that nikita200 wont do somethin' bad to the supporter"
,ilovemycomputer,2011-11-09T23:50Z,"Nikita or someone, can you guys help me out with this? Im trying to convert some HD tv shows (720p) on .mkv format to .avi. now, i've figured out how to convert to .avi, but the audio is not playing on the file. audio is turned on, everything is as it is when I start up except the frame size is set to 'original' and video frame rate is set to 'auto'....
my problem is the video is blotchy and the audio is not playing.... 
If you have any ideas on how to fix this just respond to this. thx"
