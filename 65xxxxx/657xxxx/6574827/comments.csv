[S],velvet.,2011-07-31T21:46Z,Why are you calling this a DVDrip in the title when it is not?
[T],horrorhound,2011-07-31T21:51Z,ts or r5?

,gazgaz,2011-08-01T12:08Z,clearly no attempted good dead goes un punished these days; thanks for upload
,rideon422,2011-08-01T19:59Z,"You guys really need to read the text above
IT SAYS:
""I have subtitled film but it is not bio or DVD quality but it is a fairly good quality!"""
,SeanCasey1014,2011-08-02T01:02Z,"@rideon422 He should have left DVDrip off the title then and how are we supposed to know what the description says, I speak armeican, learn it or get off the internet. USA USA USA!"
,TorrentJezuz,2011-08-02T01:52Z,FAKE
,selenecorvenious,2011-08-02T02:36Z,odd for someone who speaks american why cant they spell it
,jensrosk,2011-08-02T20:24Z,"The uploader's text is in Danish. He writes ""I have texted the film. It isn't cinema or DVD quality, but it's a reasonably good quality"". I suppose he's put Danish subtitles on a TS quality film he got from elsewhere."
,TorrentJezuz,2011-08-03T01:19Z,We called it FAKE because the title was mislabeled and typthe didnt respond and say its not its just mislabeled.
,SecretAgentN,2011-08-03T23:20Z,"So nice of you all to give typthe a full 8 hours to respond before you start calling him a dick and a liar. Maybe he/she was sleeping (it was nearly midnight in Denmark after all) instead of sitting by the computer waiting for comments. And if English isn't their native language, maybe it was just too much work to translate your nasty comments. Lighten up people!"
,Ginge0570,2011-08-07T19:49Z,In all fairness there are searching for a DVD rip of this film.. which will be very unlikely so soon to the release. But The Uploader should not have listed this as a DVDRIP if he dont want to face hassle. People spend lots of time and have to wait hours in some cases to get this downloaded to find out its a load of crap that shouldnt of been uploaded in the first place. So  TYPTHE stop listing things as something there not.  Thank you.

,craigtoys,2011-08-24T12:50Z,POES
,renison7,2011-09-03T01:14Z,"Its not fake its mislabelled. -1 for that, having said that i think its pretty obvious to know that there cannot be a dvdrip before an r5.

@SeanCasey1014    you can easily translate the Danish description using google if you wanted to confirm. And yes there is no such language as armeican (American) just like there no Indian, Chinese or European language. And there is no need for anyone to learn ""american"" english as the WWW is not ur personal property nor of the US and A.

Cheers everyone."
,renison7,2011-09-03T01:17Z,fyi US&A was intentional.
,ericv1984,2011-09-07T07:32Z,If any of you downloaded this and expected this copy of Harry Potter to be a DVDrip then you're as retarded as typthe.
,JohnShit,2011-09-22T22:50Z,"This isn't a DVDRip. It's either Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, or it's just a TS of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2."
,lordscripture,2011-09-24T16:22Z,"FAKE!
LIAR!
dont download this one!
it's not dvdrip LIAR!"
,john-death_screams,2011-09-24T17:21Z,Fakee
,VectusKL,2011-09-25T10:16Z,"Agreed, anyone here who thinks a DVDRIP would be out that early is a total dickwipe. seriously, you try and big yourselves up saying you've been on this site downloading for years, and you think a DVDRIP of the most anticipated, high budget, well looked after by Warner Bro.? please seriously go back inside your mothers womb. Because the world is just not ready for that type of stupidity yet. Thanks for the upload."
,Ryan1466,2011-09-27T21:17Z,Remove this torrent you fake. It is not DVD you should be banned for lying and faking 
,john-death_screams,2011-10-02T10:12Z,"Idiot! Fakee!!! When is the REAL DVDRip gonna come out, anyways? :(("
,spiritshows,2011-10-10T11:31Z,dvdrip not released yet..
,santisimog,2011-10-16T22:32Z,"fucking liar!!!!!!
hope you are a faggot!!!!"
,farahad,2011-10-20T23:53Z,"@santisimog  FYI, calling people homosexual isn't an insult. Acting like an ignorant bung-hole on the internet may be easy, but it's hardly excusable.  I wouldn't say it's excusable.  "
