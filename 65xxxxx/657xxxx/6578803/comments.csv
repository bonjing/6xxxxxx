,B00geyJ4n,2011-08-23T16:41Z,"I have yet to see if it works, but the download speed is fine, 0.5mb/s. Thanks once again for the great upload."
,B00geyJ4n,2011-08-23T20:48Z,"It worked! I beat the game in about an hour or two, it isn't really long but the boss fight is indeed satisfying. Sure as hell is better then the Meredith boss fight :p
If you tried to install this torrent and failed, it means you're doing something wrong because it works perfectly here."
,metisse.,2011-09-01T15:24Z,"Installed in about 1 sec, and as a result the DA itself works perfectly but there is no legacy content. 

(btw there was no disk1.bin in the torrent)

Using Windows 7 64."
