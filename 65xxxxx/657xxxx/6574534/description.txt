
Carol ( Sharon Cuneta ) lives in a corporate world where men are the bosses and women are given not so important positions. Yet she is idealistic enough to prove to them she has every right to be their equal. Then one broken coffee maker changes her all work and no play lifestyle. She meets Tonchi ( Gabby Concepcion ), an all-around technician. His fresh outlook and happy go lucky approach to life lure her to get closer to him and her once boring life turns to red as passion and intimate moments color it. She feels happy with Tonchi even if they are from two different worlds. But is passion enough to sustain a whirlwind relationship?
