P.G. Wodehouse - Summer Lightning audiobook in small parts
Read by Martin Jarvis

This, together with its sequel, Heavy Weather, is the finest of the Blandings stories in my view. Just have to love the characters, the sunshine, the happy resolution of conflict. Oh, and Chopin's "Minute waltz" is the perfect music to accompany this lovely story.
All I did was cut up the hour-long files into shorter bits for easier access. 64 Kbits/s, good quality.
Check out my torrent of the movie "Heavy Weather" as well.
Seed and enjoy!
