No subs included, so is it dubbed?

If anyone downloads and cares to enlighten the masses it would be greatly appreciated."
,rickk1,2011-08-01T05:19Z,very good ?s
,mausertech,2011-08-01T17:49Z,NEVER MIND THAT ABOUT NEEDING  INFORMATION.  WE ARE ALL MINDREADERS AND PSYCHICS YOU SEE. WE ARE JUST EXPECTED TO KNOW WHAT THESE THINGS ARE ABOUT. IT MAKES IT MORE FUN TO WASTE TIME DOWNLOADING GB'S OF DATA THAT MAY BE WORTHLESS. TIES UP ALL THAT UNUSED BANDWIDTH WE KEEP HEARING IS JUST SITTING THERE UNUSED.

It would have taken less time for you to go to the site and look the movie up than it did to post your worthless comment."
