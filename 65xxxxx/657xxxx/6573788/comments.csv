,Sing4me,2011-08-15T01:02Z,"I also have USB Loader GX , and this one didnt work for me either. started off good, then went to a black screen, in the left corner it read ""?something?? fortress"" Oh well, no biggie. it's the first time I have ever had a problem with any games from you. thanks anyway."
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-08-15T03:00Z,"If you ever have a problem with a game, try switching to a different Custom IOS (CIOS) as mentioned above. This title works fine on USB Loader GX.

If you still cannot get it to work after that, it will definitely work after you have installed this:

Set your base as 56 when installing."

finally it's working after hours and hours of changing settings didnt work with cios249 or any other. just about to give up cios248 and turn off ocarina off and block ios reload error 002 fix anti did the trick.. thank you for ur reply.. did u have Boot Camp Academy, i have problems playing that one too. thanx."
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-09-10T23:19Z,"@b3tito

You are correct, I will verify that it also worked for me with cIOS 248, ""block IOS reload"" ON and ""002 Fix"" ANTI. So it seems there are two ways to play it."
