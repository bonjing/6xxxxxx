,ekarth22,2011-08-01T06:27Z,"Let me share with you, the Kaspersky Key-changer macro.
no need to go offline
no need to type the registration number everytime.
just drag and drop the key files on the keychanger window and it'll do the work.

,rinku1990,2011-08-01T07:47Z,it will be work on version 2012????
,zedahm,2011-08-01T09:02Z,"I would like to inform all people here that nothing is gonna work on KIS/KAV 2012 like trial resetters.


The trial resetters will get failed after 10-20 minutes as KASPERSKY LAB has fixed all kinds of tweaks.


Unfortunately, no fix in sight yet."

Yes, it will work with 2011 as well as 2012.
Sorry, cant email you.

@zedahm
Who is speaking about trial reseter?
Torrent only contains keys.

Your crack doesn't work, but just remembering you, posting these types of messages, considered as spam."

Some are blocked, but one worked for me."
,vincebaker,2011-08-05T00:43Z,"Somebody mentioned that the trial reset will fail in 10-20 mins and there is no fix yet. Actually there's a way to go about it but the process is quite tedious. For those who are already without licence may want to try this:

1) use trial reset to obtain new trial licence

within 10 minutes:

2) delete the new trial licence and remove kaspersky from your computer

3) re-install kaspersky, reboot and activate trial licence
