The book features a self-access approach, allowing students who may not have time to attend classes to work on their own. Thereâ€™s an introduction for teachers detailing ways of using the book in a classroom and ten units covering language presentation and comprehension work, listening for understanding, listening and responding, and writing exercises using letters, faxes, and taking orders. The material is a series of realistic contexts set in a wide variety of countries with realistic recording material exposing students to the accents of different nationalities. The book also features a language syllabus based broadly on specifications of the International Certificate Conferenceâ€™s English for the Hotel and Catering industry syllabus. Finally, there is an answer key to the exercises together with tape transcripts and a separate grammar summary at the back of the book.
