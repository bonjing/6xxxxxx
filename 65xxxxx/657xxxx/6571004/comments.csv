,leerozon,2011-07-30T23:13Z,"No sound. 
Would not play sound on computer, so I converted it to AVI, still no sound. Too bad...the video quality looks amazing-but with no sound-can't watch it. "

,formerly_azrielle,2011-08-30T14:14Z,"The audio doesn't start for about a minute, which might be why people think there's no audio (and, for a TS/CAM, the audio is really quite good)...
The video is permanently ""boxed in"", so that even in FULLSCREEN mode, the video frame only occupies about 3/4 of your screen.  If (in VLC) you change the aspect ratio to 16:9 or 16:10, then toggle to fullscreen mode, you can mostly eliminate this, but it is still a pain in the ass--especially when compared to the ""non-boxed"" video of the ""TS.XviD-SceneLovers"" version (whose audio is maybe slightly inferior to this one)."
