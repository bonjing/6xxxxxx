Muhammad Ali has been called the greatest athlete of his century, but he was much more than a great boxer; he was one of the most compelling figures of his time, a leader in the civil rights movement, a fiercely principled man who nearly traded in his career rather than violate his religious beliefs, and a figure of remarkable charm and charisma in a sport hardly known for producing articulate men. Muhammad Ali: Through the Eyes of the World is a feature-length documentary which uses vintage films clips and interviews with his friends, family, and admirers to tell the full story of Ali's life and career. Celebrity interviews include James Earl Jones, Billy Crystal, Rod Steiger, and Billy Connolly.
