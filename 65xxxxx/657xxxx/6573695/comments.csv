,godswallops,2011-08-03T14:48Z,"With respect, I think something is broken.

There are NO seeds.

I can see about 60 peers in the swarm, connect to about 30 of them - all have 0.0% of the file.

Not a single byte is available.

Perhaps you could recheck or re-upload.

Thanks. :)"
,godswallops,2011-08-06T16:02Z,"Woah! ... 4 days later, there are seeds :)

Thanks; you came through.

... I will seed this for 2X what I receive :)"
