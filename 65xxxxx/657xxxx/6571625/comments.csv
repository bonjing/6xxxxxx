,achtiv1,2011-07-30T22:29Z,no way i use to watch this years ago thanks for the down load eztv
,xniggler,2011-07-31T03:16Z,awesome show!best cartoon in ages!
,KremX,2011-07-31T05:11Z,This is probably the best cartoon that i have seen in my 23 years of life. It is more of a dark fantasy genre rather than all those pointless and shallow kids cartoons on cartoon network these days. All the characters are likeable and the combat choreography is very impressive. This is more of a cartoon for adults that are still young at heart. Love it.
,neoman44,2011-07-31T08:20Z,"Awesome. I forgot to watch it when it came on, and according to the guide there isn't a repeat scheduled for a while. D/L ing now. So how does it compare to the old series so far?"
,Halizar,2011-07-31T13:19Z,Well its cool they brought it back. I was a kid when the frist one was on and did watch it so I can judge the new to the old. I must say that the new one has much better artists at work although not near Disney type work. I did enjoy seeing this as it brought me back some years but I hope they are not going to just spit out all the old episodes and have nothing original.  For the new kids watching. DONT let your mom catch you getting to (know) yourself over Cheetara haha ;p
