The next day, Thundera is attacked by Lizards who have acquired salvaged technology. It is soon discovered that 
Grune has joined the Lizards, and that Panthro is being held hostage. Lion-O comes to his father's aid, allowing 
Claudus to rescue Panthro. But Panthro murders the king, then revealing himself to be Mumm-Ra, an ancient nemesis 
of the Thundercats, in disguise. Lion-O and Tygra are captured along with Jaga and Cheetara. However, due to his 
kindess to the Lizard prisoners, Lion-O manages to escape with Tygra to mount a rescue. Mumm-Ra wants the stone 
in the sword which he claims is his, and tortures Jaga to get him to remove a curse that prevents the Sword of 
Omens from touching evil. Lion-O and Tygra rescue Jaga and Cheetara, who is now revealed to be one of Jagaâ€™s clerics, 
with Lion-O grabbing the sword to blast Mumm-Ra out into open as the rising sun's rays harm him. Forced to leave Jaga, 
who sacrifices himself to ensure their escape, Lion-O, Tygra, and Cheetara undergo a quest to find the Book of Omens.
