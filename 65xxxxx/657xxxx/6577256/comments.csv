Your previous upload of this has been deleted.


What trackers (if any) you specify in .torrent files that you upload to TPB is not relevant.
The web site automatically edits the tracker list in every .torrent file it receives to insert our choice of trackers, and to remove any trackers that we do not approve of.
Just download the .torrent file from the torrent posting page you created, and use that one to seed with instead of the original one that you uploaded."
