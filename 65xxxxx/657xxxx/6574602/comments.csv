I downloaded last one all with info that it has English subtitle. After downloading all found no nglish subtitle."
,kaminer,2011-08-02T07:57Z,"sorry to ask it this way but are you planning on seeding this anytime in the foreseeable future?

Because I would thank you for doing so but am quite doubtful you are going to do it. It's a huge file and you have to seed it for some weeks before anyone can help you seed it too."
,kaminer,2011-08-02T07:58Z,it could also be put this way: I'LL SSSEEEEEEEDDD if you start SEEEEEDDDING
,s666xxx,2011-08-03T23:08Z,"I seed it since some days with 100KB/s!
More my line isn't capable to.
And why there's no seeder shown in the stats, I don't know. There are up to 10 leechers.
It's my first try with that torrent stuff.
This torrent is the absolute first one, working, the others not working, I can't delete here :-((

Enjoy mates :-)"
,s666xxx,2011-08-03T23:10Z,"@abids: Audio german and english; 
SUBS in German and English, according CD Cover (didn't try it yet)."
,s666xxx,2011-08-03T23:40Z,"@kaminer: If you help me make it run better, I'll do. 
I try a second version without archive. Then you can select the files to load separately (and if you're clever any of you starts loading a DIFFERENT one! Makes a complete set of files much faster)."
,s666xxx,2011-08-04T00:57Z,"Ok guys, there's now there's a better one:
