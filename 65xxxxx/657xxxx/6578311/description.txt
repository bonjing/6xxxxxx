Nigel Planer narrates a documentary which traces the origins and development of British
heavy metal from its humble beginnings in the industrialised Midlands to its proud
international triumph.

In the late 60s a number of British bands were forging a new kind of sound. Known as hard
rock, it was loud, tough, energetic and sometimes dark in outlook. They didn't know it, but
Deep Purple, Uriah Heep and, most significantly, Black Sabbath were defining what first
became heavy rock and then eventually heavy metal.

Inspired by blues rock, progressive rock, classical music and high energy American rock, they
synthesised the sound that would inspire bands like Judas Priest to take metal even further
during the 70s.

By the 80s its originators had fallen foul of punk rock, creative stasis or drug and alcohol
abuse. But a new wave of British heavy metal was ready to take up the crusade. With the
success of bands like Iron Maiden, it went global.

Contributors include Lemmy, Sabbath's Tony Iommi, Ian Gillan from Deep Purple, Judas
Priest singer Rob Halford, Bruce Dickinson from Iron Maiden and Saxon's Biff Byford.
