Look whoâ€™s making dinner! Twenty-one of our favorite writers and chefs expound upon the joysâ€”and perilsâ€”of feeding their families.

Mario Bataliâ€™s kids gobble up monkfish liver and foie gras. Peter Kaminskyâ€™s youngest daughter wonâ€™t eat anything at all. Mark Bittman reveals the four stages of learning to cook. Stephen King offers tips about what to cook when you donâ€™t feel like cooking. And Jim Harrison shows how good food and wine trump expensive cars and houses.

This book celebrates those who toil behind the stove, trying to nourish and please. Their tales are accompanied by more than sixty family-tested recipes, time-saving tips, and cookbook recommendations, as well as New Yorker cartoons. Plus there are interviews with homestyle heroes from all across Americaâ€”a fireman in Brooklyn, a football coach in Atlanta, and a bond trader in Los Angeles, among others.

What emerges is a book not just about food but about our changing families. It offers a newfound community for any man who proudly dons an apron and inspiration for those who have yet to pick up the spatula.
