,badlands,2011-09-28T18:21Z,"Hardly any official Greatest hits, probably just some guys' collection of what he thinks are Coldplays greatest hits (like those Russian compilations, we all know). Some gems missing, few surprises but not a bad attempt of capturing this band. Middle of the road-collection, totally safe and no risks whatsoever. Not sure Chris Martin would agree with the choices, but still."
