,MRShanku,2011-07-30T00:48Z,"THank you

Planning to rip this torrent"
,mighty_zeus,2011-07-30T17:06Z,thank you BOZX ;-)
,rulssi,2011-07-30T18:03Z,"Awesome, i'm downloading 40kB/s and seeding 450kB/s. Enjoy.."
,lontrus,2011-07-30T20:28Z,"RESOLUTION.........: 1280x544
720p means 1280x720 not like what you have in info 
dont write torrent names with faulse info ffs retard"
,SD_rocks,2011-07-30T21:08Z,you are an asshole lontrus you know that?
,rulssi,2011-07-30T22:25Z,Video is really good but there seems to be something wrong with the audio. Tried watching this with my TV and few different video players but the speech is really quiet and all other sounds are loud. Its horrible trying to figure out some parts what people are trying to say and then suddenly music comes on loud as fuck. Going to try the 480p instead..
,brandon_monkey,2011-07-31T02:37Z,"@lontrus.... 1280*720 would be in the ratio of 16:9, since the movies is at an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 it has only 544 vertical lines of picture and black bars make up the other 176 lines of resolution. Meaning you still get the same picture quality. Just for future reference!"
,brandon_monkey,2011-07-31T02:51Z,z
,brandon_monkey,2011-07-31T02:55Z,@lontrus.. 1280*720p is movies that are filmed at a 16:9 aspect ratio. Since this movie is 2.35:1 the movie has 544 vertical lines of picture and the other 176 lines are made up of the black bars top and bottom. Which means you get 720p picture quality. Just for future reference! 
,Kadoma,2011-07-31T07:32Z,"@ brandon_monkey. Don't expect a reply from lontrus, he is scratching his head an trying to figure out the math. Someone should come out with rips aimed at people like that, ""true"" 1280x720 rips...with 176 lines of black nothing permanently encoded in. "
,abhikrit,2011-07-31T23:02Z,"@lontrus, i am just tired of seeing comments like yours & other sick fucks like you, you guys are so horrible you think that you know everything but the truth is the opposite, you guys are half witted dumb assholes. If you have so much of problem, go buy the fucking bluray disc, fucking moron. "
,HundredEyes,2011-08-01T08:44Z,"@rulssi - I had the same problem too with the audio, the voices being far too quiet to hear but the music being loud on VLC media player. I thought it was odd for a trusted host to upload a dodgy file, but it does work with the right media player. Try Divx Plus Player, the audio worked fine with that program. "
,HundredEyes,2011-08-01T08:46Z,@ rulssi - Try Divx Plus Player and the audio will work fine. 
,conoyes,2011-08-07T01:54Z,"c'mon, don't blame the uploader, just thank it for bothering so much. it there are mistakes they can be mentioned gently"

Can you reupload them on Umilk.net"
,ferrabra,2011-09-02T10:23Z,Does not look like BR...
,SamuraiC,2011-09-27T23:35Z,"@torture666killer
troll much you racist bastard? Go do that shit on youtube like everyone else and just give actual feedback under the comments section"
,Amegon,2011-10-07T16:29Z,"thanks for the upload. Well, good that most people here can think, and it truly is a bit weird with the hd things, so the connection should be
720p = HDReady = 1280x.... (depending on ratio, the 1280 is important here)
1080p = FullHD = 1920x..... (depending on ratio)

but I have to admit that it would be more easy to call it 1280p or 1920p  but well, the other numbers are the standard and look better :)"
,SwTc-klupido,2011-11-01T23:57Z,Jason Statham i love you 
,aiigghht,2012-04-27T06:47Z,"@lontrus, I hope you trolling son, coz that shit was full blown retarded. Google aspect ratio.

BOZX, always top notch!"
