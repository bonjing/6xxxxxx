Review [c/o Amazon]


For a long time everyone has been waiting for Sheryl Crow's fourth studio album. It finally
came out today [April 16], and let me tell you, it's well worth the wait.

Sheryl Crow is a prime example of something that gets better with age. And I'm not just
talking about her looks [although those ain't bad either...did you see her in Stuff?]. I'm also not
saying that her other albums weren't good, because they were more than that, but THIS
album easily outdoes any of them. There are classic slap-your-knee vibes in songs like "Soak
Up The Sun", "Diamond Road" and "Lucky Kid", as well as original and exhilarating rhythms
as those found in "Safe & Sound", "You're An Original" and "Hole In My Pocket".

But it's not only about the music on this album. Her lyrics and singing quality will keep you
interested as well. "Over You" is an interesting tune about drowning in love (if you will), while
the title track combines love yearning with love angst. "It's So Easy" is right up there with "I
Just Can't Stop Loving You", and "Weather Channel" is the kind of quirky yet cool tune you'd
expect her to end her album with.

Not a single minute will be wasted on this album. It's rock, with a little bit of other flavors of
music thrown in. What could be better?
