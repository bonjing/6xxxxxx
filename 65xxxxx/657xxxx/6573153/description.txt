"Spanish Kalle tells the story of Karl Staf, last survivor of the 400 Swedish volunteers for the People's Front in the Spanish civil war. Active in the resistance during WWII, sentenced to death for espionage by Nazi occupation forces, survived labour camp and various South American prisons. As a reporter lived in Moscow, China and Cuba, met Krustjev, Zhou Englai, Castro. Kalle is 90 years old, lives in Helsingborg at the time of the recording.

Video also features portraits of contemporary activist youth, roughly the same age as Karl Staf was when he first set out for Spain. Time is shown as elliptical, for instance as Staf's recollections of hiding from German bombers in 30's Spain segues into his recollections of hiding from American bombers in 40's Germany.

Music for the film are five re-recorded songs of the Spanish Civil War - Ay Carmela, A Las Barricadas, Himno Del Riego, Si Me Quieres Escribir, En El Plaza De Mi Pueblo.

Spanish Kalle premiered as a double projection at museu La Panera in Lleida, a city at the northern end of the old Ebro frontline where Kalle had fought 70 years before.

Posters for the video produced at the Imprenta Boqueron in Buenos Aires, series of ten. Texts taken from original propaganda posters of the Spanish Civil War."
