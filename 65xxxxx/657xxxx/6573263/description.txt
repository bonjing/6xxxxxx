On the last night of the fiscal quarter, Dennis, Shenanigan's manager, will be promoted to district manager if they have a $9000 day. To motivate the crew, he tells them the restaurant will close if they don't meet this goal. His competition is next door: Ta-Ta's, a bar with scantily clad waitresses, managed by the newly self-confident Calvin. At Ta-Ta's, it's Allison's first day; she's nervous. At Shenanigan's, Mason, a cook, is trying his best to be cool, without success.
