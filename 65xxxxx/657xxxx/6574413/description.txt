  Shirley's a middle-aged Liverpool housewife, who finds herself talking to
  the wall while she prepares her husband's chip'n'egg, wondering what 
  happened to her life. She compares scenes in her current life with what
  she used to be like and feels she's stagnated and in a rut. But when her
  best friend wins an all-expenses-paid vacation to Greece for two, Shirley
  begins to see the world, and herself, in a different light.
