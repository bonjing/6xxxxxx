Microsoft Visual Studio LightSwitch is an IDE specifically tailored for creating 
line-of-business applications built on existing .NET technologies and Microsoft 
platforms. The applications produced are architecturally 3-tier: the user 
interface runs on Microsoft Silverlight; the logic and data-access tier is built 
on WCF RIA Services and Entity Framework, hosted in ASP.NET; and the primary 
data storage supports Microsoft SQL Server Express, Microsoft SQL Server and 
Microsoft SQL Azure. LightSwitch also supports other data sources including 
Microsoft SharePoint. LightSwitch includes graphical designers for designing 
entities and entity relationships, entity queries, and UI screens. Business 
logic may be written in either Visual Basic or Visual C#. The tool can be 
installed as a stand-alone SKU or as an integrated add-in to Visual Studio 2010 
Professional and higher.[
