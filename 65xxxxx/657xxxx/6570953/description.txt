In seeing an image from the beginning of the movie, where a young boy with the
greatness of the true Irish spirit, arrives in Sweden from Finland wearing a tag
indicating he is to be found a new home, it reminded me much of such images we
have seen so much of with respect to the Italian children that made it to Ellis
Island looking for a new life altogether.

I then reflected that if only the best of Italy and the best of Sweden and all that share their wisdom could get together, we could make for a truly beautiful world once the right understanding has been achieved as to what always was of 
best merit and should be respected accordingly by all till all are as truly
most deserving as sprited equals in our midst.


God bless!
