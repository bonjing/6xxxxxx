What Laptop is the leading mobile computing magazine for laptops, netbooks and smartphones. Launched in 1999, it is the only mobile computing magazine in the UK to offer you independent reviews of the latest mobile computers on the market. We test, review and rate every laptop and netbook available in the UK using our own dedicated testing labs. Each machine is tested by dedicated mobile computing staff, we donâ€™t allow anyone but trained members of staff to test or review our laptops. In this way, you can be sure that our findings are the most thorough and independent of any magazine today.
