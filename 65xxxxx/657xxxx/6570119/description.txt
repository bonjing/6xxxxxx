This is what i have set up on my Tom Tom Go 910.  Included is the Bootloader 5.5229, Fast Activate (which patches the ttsystem file, activates the map and poi's and patches tomtom home)and the Navcore 9.056.542741.2.

I found this setup works great with no issues so far, should work with most GO's.

If you have any Questions feel free to ask :)
