I had a chuckle when I saw the first time that I welcomed you back. Just after I got banned for 2 weeks for fighting to get your original name and skull. Let me tell you it was well worth it. I would do it again in a heartbeat.
So from one babbler to another ;P) let me thank you again for all the great music and caring enough to putting ones up that you knew that I would thoroughly enjoy.
Peace, Love & Blessings

Now go and feed that damn dog! :P) "
