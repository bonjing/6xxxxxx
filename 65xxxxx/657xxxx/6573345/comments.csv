,M69W,2011-08-02T20:25Z,"i looked but didnt see em,but thanks very much. i am a huge fan of ur DL's and think you should be awarded a nice big skull.... 
Hell Even the BROWN one : p
even though i understand why its not gonna happen since ur kinda taking this pirate ship straight into OPEN waters for all to see and make it even more of a target. TPB is still an underground movement gaining steam,notice and F U to the mainstream MAN. i keep my skull in my other pants but think the MODS Should give you one, u do a hella good job imo esp for not doing it that long.  have been and will continue to be a Fan : )"
