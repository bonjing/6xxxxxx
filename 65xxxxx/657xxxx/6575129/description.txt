I didn't like the Pando downloader or the slow Fileplanet link, so I extracted the torrent (using http://torrenteditor.com ) and added a new tracker ( udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce )

Pathname is still pando due to HASH needing to remain the same (according to torrenteditor.com)

Pando downloader uses bittorrent too, but it is a bit different so I don't expect this to work too well alongside the Pando peers - but meh, worth a try.
