Plot Summary: Next in the four-part Marvel Anime project and broadcasts after 
the Iron Man anime. Wolverine is a mutant, possessing animal-keen senses, 
enhanced psychical capabilities, three retracting bone claws on each hand and a 
healing factor that allows him to recover from virtually any wound, disease or toxin at a accelerated rate

The first episode of the series brings us to a time where Logan is drawn back to Japan to rescue Mariko from her father. At this point in his history, it's 
to set up his great Japan adventure that helped truly define the character in 
the 80's where he gained his concepts of honor and family. The episode deals 
with him going into household and intending to take Mariko back but he ends up 
fighting her father with wooden swords and he's soundly defeated, not understanding what's going on and why he wasn't able to take 
down an old man.

One night in New York, Logan saves a man named Tesshin Asano who was 
being attacked by members of AIM equipped with cloaking devices and 
metal destroying weaponry. Asano tells Wolverine about the whereabouts 
of his missing love, Mariko Yashida, and the crime organization Kuzuryu, 
the leader of which is Mariko's father, Shingen. Mariko is allegedly 
arranged to be married to a man named Hideki Kurohagi in order to expand 
his operations. In order to find Mariko, who was kidnapped from New York 
a year ago, Logan flies to Tokyo and infiltrates the Yashida household, 
but is detected by Shingen. After his henchmen are defeated, Shingen 
challenges Logan to a bokken fight. Logan barely manages to withstand 
Shingen's swordsman skills, but is shot with a drugged dart by Hideki, 
before going into a rage and bringing out his claws.
