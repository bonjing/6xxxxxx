In my country there were lineups of 3 blocks to watch it, in North America they showed it in a theatre and there were four people, then 2 more arrived, 2 old ladies that got into the wrong show... Of course, no gunfights or murders or easy-to-understand plot.   
The depth of the film in many ways keeps you thinking for a long time after you watch it."
