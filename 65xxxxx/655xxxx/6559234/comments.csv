,enonumus,2012-02-08T10:57Z,"A8/V7.5 - Upload is appreciated, but the bitrate was just insanely.  650MB for a 3 hour 720P movie is just way, waaaaay too small.  Anything less than 500MB/hour with the best a/v encoding settings at 720P is going to yield poor quality, loss of detail, and usually macro blocking.  To retain most of the original detail and quality you're ideally looking at 750MB-1GB/hour @720p depending on the content of the film itself (action vs. drama, indoors vs. outdoors, fixed camera vs. lots of movement and panning etc.) and whether it's 2ch or 5.1ch audio.  I don't recommend this torrent for anyone unless you're just planning to watch it on a portable media device with a small screen.  "
