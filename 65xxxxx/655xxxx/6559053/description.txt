Ubehage's EasyCopy v1.1
-----------------------

Newest release of this smal tool for copying, backups, etc...


Changes in this release:
- Optimized Drag-n-Drop, so it won't cause Explorer to hang when you drag large folders into EasyCopy.

- Removed suddenly appearing "Error53"-message from Command Module.



I am still working on this application. It's fully functional, but not yet "perfect" the way I want it.
If you have any suggestions for extra features, or comments to existing functionality, please mail me at ubehage@gmail.com
