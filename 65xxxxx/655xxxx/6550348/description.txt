James Gang
Jesse Come Home (2004)




With the emergence of Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience during the late '60s, the path was cleared for other hard-rockin' "trios." Arguably, the finest to emerge from the subsequent American crop was the James Gang. Despite penning a few of classic rock radio's most enduring songs, the James Gang ultimately failed to deliver on their initial promise, as constant lineup juggling ultimately derailed the group.

Jesse Come Home was the James Gang's final album, and it's not to difficult to see why. Ignoring the group's continuing failure to write strong songs, the main problem of the album lies in the bland, uninspired playing of the entire group. Bob Webb may not have recaptured the power of Joe Walsh or Tommy Bolin, but that doesn't give Fox and Peters an excuse for phoning in their performances. After Jesse Come Home failed to make the charts, Fox and Peters wisely decided to call it a day, disbanding the James Gang for the last time.
