,bhutan_6,2011-08-02T15:22Z,Great torrents. Thanks. I have a request to everyone. Can you upload 2 rare Gamecube games (NTSC-U) Star wars rouge squadron 2: rouge leader and Prince of persia: sands of time in Piratebay. Thx in advance. Both of the games are in IGN's all time 25 best GC games list. 
,AllardP2.,2011-11-03T07:37Z,"Why I can only play the first 5 games? The next icons are ""transparant"" and nothing happens."
,Zstar,2012-03-29T11:20Z,well if you buy it new you get a wii motion plus controller which is the bulk of the buy
,oshua,2012-04-06T14:47Z,need help . i cant seam to get this game to load using usb loader gx or wiiflow . as soon as i hit play it trys to load but the sent me back to wii menu . iv tried changing region settings and iso setting ... what am i  missing ????? ..... a few games iv download also having the same problem it 
,oshua,2012-04-25T06:03Z,"for everyone that had troubble like myself 


1. Open USB Loader GX as usual
2. Click on the Wii Sports Resort game
3. Go to settings
4. Go to ""Game Load""
5. Scroll down to ""Alternate DOL"" and click it once
6. Go to the next option ""Select DOL Offset"" and click it
7. When it asks you if you wish to use the alternate DOL that is known to be correct, select yes
8. Go out of the settings and load the game as usual, watch the video, and you will probably be taken back to the System Menu (this is ok)
9. Go back to USB Loader GX, back to Wii Sports Resort, back to settings, and select ""Default Gamesettings""
10. It should work flawlessly now, and you will never have to go through this process again

Note: This method is very similar for other Wii Motion Plus games that require an alternate DOL initial boot-up, so simply follow the same instructions."
,oshua,2012-05-20T08:28Z,or for a better solution: install ciso249 d2x and update cfg-loader to v70 . will load all wii motion game with out fucking around with dol settings .
