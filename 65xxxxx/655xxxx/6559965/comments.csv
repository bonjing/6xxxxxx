,ffonzones,2011-07-24T23:34Z,"lately its been really getting under my skin that people just take and dont give the smallest in return....in the form of a thank you!!!! or a +1 on the uploader's file???? I'm mean you selfish people!!!!! without the kindness of these uploader's none of this would even exist...and guess what....YOU'D be paying money to get any and all of these torrents!!!!!! PLEASE a simple thanks, the file/download works great!!! so the uploader doesn't decide one day why am I doing this for not even a simple THANK YOU!!!!! register...it takes 2 seconds and it allows you to leave comments or just rate the torrent, and that means alot for all of us!!!! without comments and +1's we dont know if these torrents are even any good??? So please reconsider giving back in just the littlest way....and now I said my piece and can say Thank you sam_code4u it works as it should...only thing is it's only good for 29 days, but atleast that's a whole month of security. I appreciate it much!!!"
,donkeydick121,2011-07-25T15:20Z,"ffonezoes - I totally agree

I always leave this comment on my uploads but no-one takes any notice...

  Platform: Windows 95, 98, ME, NT4, 2000, XP, 2003, 2008, Vista and Windows 7. 

Please seed (share) these programs. Most people (just like me when I started) don't know how to do this. It simply means that when the download is complete, don't press stop or close down your program. It will then be available to anyone who wants to download it from you. Thanks."

,sam_code4u,2011-07-30T06:38Z,"@ffonzones and @donkeydick121

thanks! for your precious comments :). I totally agree. 

new keys are uploaded for those who complain. you should understand i don't have free time all the way to upload keys daily. but whenever i notice that keys are blocked i do provide the updates.

be thankful for what you are getting. "
