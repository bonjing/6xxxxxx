bro,could you please give us more information about your own configuration ?
Verify your version at first,is it well 5.1.110 ?
It seems effectively that in certain cases,last patch does not work...
I must verify again about this problem anyway.
Will up a fix if needed as well.
sorry again mate.let us know more about your problem,please !

 Edit :

If you've tested the auto refresh rate switching feature and would prefer to have it off, the hotfix below will disable it.


(http://download.arcsoft.com/downloads/digitaltheatre/arcsoft/disableautoswitch.zip)


1. Download and extract the contents of the ZIP file.

2. Copy the enclosed file into TMT's folder under \Plugins\VideoModule\PlayDVD


It should replace the existing file. Back up the file there before replacing it in case you'd like to enable auto-switching, or have an unexpected problem with it being disabled.

I suggest for those who could experiencing few problems to go directly on the following link up more to ArcSoft forum about this specific patch as well.few options might not rightly work after having installed this last one,indeed !
GL
works for me but few functions fail sometimes anyway as well...
otherwise wait for the full final release of this new
patch so.
sorry again 
for ATI users : use must use minimum catalyst 11.5 or more recent update as well.
for NVidia users it is still a little bit more confused
but suggest you to use minimum 270 driver version anyway
GL mates
regards

Does anyone know why I can not play clips from youtube. It always shows ""Unsupported file type"". It is not big deal about it, but it is annoying and can it be fixed somehow. Otherwise everything works perfectly, even I have updated to the latest directly though the programme itself."
