Daily Show is broadcast first!  They have communications between shows!  It makes no sense when you watch Colbert first!
But I'll live.  Anyways, you guys are great.  Thank you very much!"

I think the Colbert Report might have more ""pirate"" fans than the Daily Show (who I think has a slightly older audience), I always notice that there are way more people downloading Colbert than Stewart at any given time, it could just be that they were uploaded simultaneously on some tracker, and Piratebay only gets it after a certain amount of activity... Just a thought."

You should see Encyclopaedia Dramatica's article on Colbert.  It is unique for its fawning attitude."
