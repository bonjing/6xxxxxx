The Flight1 T182T....An Exhilarating Ride

The new T182T by Flight One Software takes the quality and workmanship detail of our Cessna Citation Mustang, and packs it into one of the most beloved single-engine, tricycle gear airplanes of all time. The T182T combines speed, elegance, safety, and range in an aircraft that is easy to fly, yet have the capability to perform like most twins with a maximum operating altitude of 20,000 feet while cruising up to 176 knots. Flight One Software brings this authentic T182T simulation exclusively for Microsoft Flight Simulator X users.
