,1sh1g4mi,2011-07-20T23:23Z,"I get a distorted navigation map.

It seems to also have killed my Citation Mustang installation. I guess both planes (or cracks) are not compatible at this time.
Nav-Data-Update seems strange as well it goes above 110% which makes no sense at all..."
,mickyfinny,2011-07-21T00:39Z,"@1sh1g4mi .I dont have Cessna Citation Mustang,so i suspect its a bad crack as you suggested.Sorry everyone,ill try better next time!."
,aarque,2011-07-21T01:25Z,mickyfinny where do you get these things so fast? I will try installing this bird into a dummy partition to see if I can learn more for us about this apparent incompatibility. Hate to bugger the Citation but at the same time I hardly ever fly the thing.
,suitretas,2011-07-21T01:45Z,"hey, thanks again mickyfinny.
oh well... still no wilco evolution vol.2 for fsx
it's a pity, i'm starting to think no one even bought it, and i'll never live long to try it out.

cheers"
,cozyflyer,2011-07-21T02:35Z,don't download! the patch has a virus in it
,mickyfinny,2011-07-21T12:14Z,"My E-SET NOD32 Hasnt shown any viri,or trojans and no one on the site where i got it from has either.So i can only assume its a false positive.I will delete this torrent at the end of the day,cos its not fully working.I will then upload a fully working  Milviz T-38A JetTrainer."
,shitthebomb,2011-07-21T14:57Z,"awesome! the t38 was just what i was looking for :D you rock, bro."

,mysteryfancy,2011-07-21T17:12Z,"Hello, So I got avast with no virus message.
Thank you for uploading mickifinni"
,mysteryfancy,2011-07-22T15:27Z,"Tested again. Again, no virus message. The plane works for me."
,sidewinderv2.0,2011-07-23T01:22Z,"This is a wonderful plane and a great flight model! I only wish that the MFD didn't have such a terribly distorted map. Also, is anyone having problems getting the flight plan/procedure functions to work? It just sets every waypoint's heading as 014 degrees.

Elsewise nice upload mickyfinny!"
,mysteryfancy,2011-07-25T12:42Z,"I added the NAV files with my existing Navigraph / NavData files. For me it works. I wish you, you also get the solution yet."
,N109GE,2011-07-28T14:39Z,How do you install the patch...?
,mysteryfancy,2011-07-28T18:25Z,"@N109GE

Original readme text:

1. Install Flight1_T182T
2. Copy this file ""Flight1_GarminG1000.gau.BAK "" to  x:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\Guages\""Folder
3. Apply patch.
4. Have Fun..."
,29995,2011-08-04T15:06Z,"Why can't i get the patch to work? When i click apply patch, it says file in use, maybe it's already open, close it and try again. Or something like that. What do i do to make it work?"
,N109GE,2011-08-05T14:18Z,"@mysteryfancy

Thank you for your reply, however...What I need to know is do I just ""click"" on the patch..?  When I do, I get a message saying...""don't try to find me"".  Am I doing something wrong...?   Thanks."
,mysteryfancy,2011-08-10T00:55Z,"Hi, if you've clicked on the Patch.Button should work there too. Have you tried the plane behind it? Then you can see if it worked."
,N109GE,2011-08-10T14:07Z,"@mysteryfancy,

You said: ""Hi, if you've clicked on the Patch.Button should work there too.""  NO GOOD...

""Have you tried the plane behind it?""  I AM NOT SURE WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT..   : ("
,mysteryfancy,2011-08-10T15:27Z,"@N109GE

Excuse my spelling errors. 
I mean, the airplane is after installing the patch in the Aircraft selection? This folder ""F1_T182 Skylane"" must be located in your FSX folder / SimObjects / Airplane. If so, test the F1_Cessna_T182T1. Then you'll know if it works. 

As I wrote, installation: 

1). Install Flight1_T182T.exe 
2) Copy the file ""Flight1_GarminG1000.gau.BAK"" to x: \ Program Files \ Microsoft Games \ Microsoft Flight Simulator X \ Gauges \ ""Folder 
3). Apply the patch (click on the patch.exe) 

For me it worked perfectly. 

Otherwise, I do not know how I can explain it to you. I'm sorry. "
,N109GE,2011-08-10T19:11Z,"@mysteryfancy,

All good, thanks for ALL you help.  Everything is good with the install itself.  The patch for some reason wont install.  As a matter of fact, it says... "" Don't try to find me..""  Go figure.  The plane loads great except I can't get the two screens to show anything.  I guess that is what the patch is to do.  If I can find a patch that will work, I guess I will have a ""fully"" work T182T.  Thanks again...my friend.

PS, don't worry about the spelling..  : )"
