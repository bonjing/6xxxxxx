National Geographic Megafactories: LEGO

As simple as it is successful, LEGO is without doubt one of the most popular toys of all time. This eye-opening trip to the company's high-tech factory reveals how robots and tricky test markets are behind the company's ever-popular police station set.

The name 'LEGO' is an abbreviation of the two Danish words "leg godt", meaning "play well". It's our name and it's our ideal. The LEGO Group was founded in 1932 by Ole Kirk Kristiansen. The Company has passed from father to son and is now owned by Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, a grandchild of the founder. It has come a long way over the past almost 80 years - from a small carpenter's workshop to a modern, global enterprise that is now, in terms of sales, the world's fourth-largest manufacturer of toys.
