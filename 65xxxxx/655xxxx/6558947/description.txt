        The  TARDIS  is dragged  down  to the  surface  of the  planet
        Frontios   and   apparently  destroyed   during   a  meteorite
        bombardment. The Doctor is  forced to help the  planet's human
        colonists  -  refugees  from  a  doomed  future  Earth  -  and
        eventually  discovers  that   their  problems  stem   from  an
        infestation of Tractators, burrowing insect-like creatures led
        by the intelligent Gravis.

        The Tractators  have been  using gravitational  force to cause
        regular meteorite bombardments in order to keep the  colonists
        weak so that  they can prey  on their bodies  and use them  as
        components in their mining machines.

        Turlough knows of the  creatures through a deep  seated racial
        memory  from  his own  planet.  He recalls  that  they can  be
        rendered harmless by  separating the Gravis  from the rest  of
        the colony. The  Doctor achieves this  by tricking the  Gravis
        into reassembling the TARDIS around itself.

        Season 21, Episode 3: Frontios Part 4

        The TARDIS has not  long dematerialised from Frontios  when an
        outside influence starts to affect it. The Doctor tells  Tegan
        and Turlough that something is pulling them toward the  centre
        of the universe. He does not know what it is, but  anticipates
        that they are going to find out.
