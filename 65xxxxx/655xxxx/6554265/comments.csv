,thebigboy1997,2012-02-05T12:31Z,"This works 100%, even thought I didn't do the Online Patch. Mounted both CD's with Daemon Tools , installed the game with the cd key, did cracking and it works. Game's in english, Virus-Free, easy to install. Great torrent !"
,Pak_RA-SA,2012-02-15T18:05Z,"Hey, can anyone help me? I downloaded the torrent through zbigz(kinda like torrific) and when I extract the archive it says Both the ISO's are corrupt but other people don't seem to be having this problem. Any suggestions?"
,slnhanumak,2012-03-31T05:10Z,"Working nice for me. Just mount both CD Images in to 2 Virtual CD ROMs then Install it. If latest version of NFS like Most Wanted is already installed on your PC, then you may can't install this so first backup your profile files then uninstall latest version and install this version, after completion of installation just copy replace crack file in the game path."
,CTSC,2012-04-14T18:07Z,what are the steps required to install this..? i mounted the iso's into 2 folders? ran setup.exe and it tells me to insert disk 2. what am i suppose to do then?
