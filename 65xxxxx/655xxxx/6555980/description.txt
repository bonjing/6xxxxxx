New farce, recorded live on-stage at Cumberland Players in Vineland, NJ.

Matthew Lyons has invited his family to meet his boyfriend, Jared. However, when they encounter his friend and neighbor Debbie, they assume that she is the lover he has invited them to meet, and she assumes that the favor Matt intends to ask her is not to cook dinner for everyone, but to act as his "beard" and pretend she is really his girlfriend so his parents don't find out that he's gay.

The confusion that follows contains all the elements of a traditional farce with a decidedly gay twist: slamming doors, innuendo and double entendre, romance, mistaken identities, and a climax designed to leave the audience rolling in the aisles.

Also includes a PDF copy of the original script and information on amateur performance rights.
