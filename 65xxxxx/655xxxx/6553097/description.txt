       Cyberbully follows Taylor Hillridge (Emily Osment), a teenage     
       girl who falls victim to online bullying, and the cost it takes   
        on her as well as her friends and family. Taylor is a pretty
        seventeen-year-old student dealing with her parents' recent
        divorce and painfully aware of her lower social status in high
        school. When her mom gives her a computer for her birthday,
        Taylor is excited by the prospect of going online to meet new
        friends without her mother always looking over her shoulder.
        However, Taylor soon finds herself the victim of betrayal and
        bullying while visiting a popular social website. Obsessed with
        the damaging posts, she begins to withdraw from her family and
        friends, including her life-long best friend, Samantha Caldone
        (Kay Panabaker). Tormented and afraid to face her peers at
        school, Taylor is pushed to an extreme breaking point. It is
        only after this life-changing event that Taylor learns that she
        is not alone  meeting other teens, including a classmate, who
        have had similar experiences. Taylor's mom, Kris (Kelly Rowan),
        reels from the incident and takes on the school system and state
        legislation to help prevent others from going through the same
        harrowing ordeal as her daughter.
