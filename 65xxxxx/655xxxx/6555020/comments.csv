,openair,2011-07-29T22:14Z,"This is actually broken same as the ""FLT"" version.  Save games broken until patch 0 is applied, and patch 0 sticks the pause button on as part of some copy protection."

,doomdemon,2011-08-24T13:15Z,"okay i spent the last 45 minutes searching for a working crack going to ad sites to download trying rar password breakers on said cracks, finding out all are bullshit, basically if you want to play this you have to make do without a save feature"
,marx1092,2011-08-27T08:18Z,I was wondering if someone knows how to use mp3unpack and wave_inject. I appreciate the help.

,TwojaMatka,2011-10-15T04:48Z,"For everyone who's having the pause problem, I found a way to fix it. I don't know if it'll work for you, but I swear it did for me:

Just play in campaign mode as the USSR, and it should unpause when you click the button. After you do that, exit to the main menu and start a new game. I've only played the USA campaign so far, but it works fine. You'll have to repeat the process every time you run the game, though."
