Okay, all this is is the Mac OS X Lion Retail .dmg converted to .iso to either be used by Windows users to burn to a disc etc. or to create a virtual machine on Windows. Should the latter be your aim, then there's a URL shortcut in the torrent which will direct you to a tutorial.

Cheers, and don't forget to seed.
