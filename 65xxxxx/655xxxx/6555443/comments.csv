,borijosn,2011-07-22T17:33Z,This isn't a valid ISO
,scorp123,2011-07-23T17:00Z,The *.iso file here seems to be damaged? Can't open it with any burning program :-/
,SoulUploader,2011-07-23T21:37Z,"It can't be opened because it's the Mac file system, and no .iso burner will recognise it. It's for use in Virtual environments, like Virtualbox"
,suckcock,2011-07-25T18:54Z,does this work for vmware workstation?
,DJb222,2011-07-25T19:23Z,does this work for virtual box ? :D

,ectobio,2011-08-02T22:27Z,So you have to set it up with VMWare to get it to work with Virtualbox? :/
,SoulUploader,2011-08-03T05:29Z,"@ectobio It'll work in Virtualbox, I've had confirmation on that. Not sure if it's as simple as just load the .iso or what though"

,chitowncomputerguy,2011-08-10T18:07Z,Does anybody know if this would work with mounting to a clone drive and running it that way?
,baba.b,2011-08-14T09:03Z,"THIS JUST WORKS PERFECT!

,baba.b,2011-08-14T09:05Z,"THIS IS PRESENT RETAIL FROM APP STORE!

,genius88,2011-08-20T18:07Z,"dude u rock 
frens all u need is 
1.  VMWare Workstation 
2. Mac OS X Lion VMware Files.exe
3. check out video link 

n it works perfect thnx uploader"
,turbotits,2011-08-23T04:22Z,"If you're on linux, there is an hfs+ image inside this file. You can find it's offset as follows:

Search for the hfs+ volume descriptor
> hexdump -C Lion_10.7_11a494.iso | grep ""48 2b 00 04""

The answer should be:

00009400  48 2b 00 04 80 00 08 00  48 2b 4c 78 00 00 00 00  |H+......H+Lx....|

This tells us that at hex block 0x9400 there is the beginning of an hfs+ partition. There is 1024 bits of boot code in front of this, so 0x9400 in decimal is 37,888. Subtract 1024 and you get: 36,864.

So we attach this to a loopback device:
> sudo losetup -o 36864 /dev/loop0 Lion_10.7_11a494.iso 

And now we can mount that image provided you have hfs+ support installed:
> sudo mount /dev/loop0 /mnt/OSXLion

From there you can copy all the files out and make a dvd that you can use with iBoot to create a OS X Lion hackintosh!"

,adeelboss,2012-04-22T08:01Z,"This works but only on VMWare.
the youtube link provided does not work.
"
,adeelboss,2012-04-22T08:02Z,search youtube for how to install on VMWare workstation 8
,BobbySue,2012-04-23T14:42Z,"The reason it didn't boot in a VM is because you need another iso that bypasses stuff. You cant boot it because Mac OS X will ONLY run on Apple hardware UNLESS you tweak it. Such examples include iDeneb, Hackintosh, and iPC.

Hope this helps!"
,Suomisisu,2012-05-29T18:28Z,What a bunch of retards.. not a single person to comment if it works on a PC... I'm going for the .dmg one and I'm going to use Transmac to burn it... dumbasses seriously... comment something useful you morons or shut up.
,Samirifai,2012-06-01T09:16Z,"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS IF YOU WANT TO BOOT IT ON VIRTUAL BOX
