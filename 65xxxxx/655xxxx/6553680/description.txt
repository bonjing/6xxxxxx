           Desc: Remember the good old days when anyone with a
           camera, a few thousand bucks, and more ambition than
           talent could schlep up to Bronson Canyon and quickly 
           make a cheap sci-fi/horror movie? Well, they're back!
           The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra is an affectionate, 
		   meticulous re-creation of those notoriously cheesy  
		   clunkers, as a gaggle of beloved stereotypes pursue
		   "that rarest of all elements - atmosphereum." 
		   Writer/Director Larry Blamire heads a superb cast - 
		   including Fay Masterson (Eyes Wide Shut), Andrew Parks
		   (Donnie Brasco), Brian Howe (Catch Me If You Can) and
		   Jennifer Blaire (The Majestic) - that faced a daunting
		   task: having to be brilliant and terrible at the same
		   time! It's one of the most original, clever, and 
		   hilarious comedies to come along in eons of your Earth
		   years!
