It is free to play on steam!
Steam servers are faster than torrents 99% of the case."

,KirjiroSenzuki,2011-07-22T07:24Z,"@steelsnp Some people still want the torrent because they have no item limits (but they still can't connect to servers from steam)

@sms.moosavi maybe compressed or something but I would recomment this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6449508/Team_Fortress_2_v1.1.5.2_AutoUpdate_Multilanguage_(No-Steam) then run this patch http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6552539/Team_Fortress_2_Patch_v1.1.6.4__AutoUpdate"
