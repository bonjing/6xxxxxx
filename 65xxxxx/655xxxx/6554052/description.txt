Both albums recorded from LP with AudioGrabber 1.83SE.

All album tracks have been run thru Adobe Audition's Click and Pop filter. They 

were all in Very Good condition, but did have a few clicks an pops. 

Also I added a Medium Concert Hall (Open) Reverb with Audition. Sounds much better 

after using these filters

The Edge City EP had a little more noise than the LPs
