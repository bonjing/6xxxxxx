,MistryWho,2011-07-22T01:44Z,"Great torrent. nice and easy one button instalation and it works fine. The only thing is that there is already a saved file, so before you start a new game, delete it by pressing UP+SELECT+B which i think is mapped out as UP+RSHIFT+Z. Just delete that save file first, or you wont be able to save your new game.
Thanks again!"
,RobLoc,2011-07-22T01:58Z,"What did I do wrong, unpacked/installed great, but im not seeing the roms in the folder?? i guess i should re DL..."
,MistryWho,2011-07-22T05:09Z,"when you look for the rom, the first folder ur in isnt the right one. that one is located in C:\Pokeblah instead of C:\Program Files\Pokeblah.
So make sure you redirect to the right folder and the 2 roms will be there."
,elcane,2011-07-22T09:59Z,nice but i don't understand the controls? i can't start a new game xd
[T],Hyperdrive25,2011-07-23T07:42Z,"How To Get Your First Gym Badge:
You need to defeat the Gym Leader to this. He is the strongest of the 3. He had red hair .He commands the pokemon with the incinerate ability [Fire].

Make sure you have a [Water] type Pokemon. It will be given to you for free when you talk to someone. All in all you should have at least 4
Pokemon at level 11 including the [Water] one.
After you defeat the first Pokemon the Gym Leader has, his next one uses a devastating ability called incinerate. To counter this, use the [Water] type Pokemon against him.  

Useful Tip: Keep rotating your Pokemon so that they all benefit from experience points. Try and capture as many Pokemon as you can!

Good luck on your journey! :)"

,SosinSoup,2011-08-13T21:32Z,"Oh wait, I figured out how you can save your files, instead of extracting the file in your folder, try extracting it on your desktop. That should work then."

,supergloo,2011-09-24T01:09Z,"when i try to start and new game, it just goes back to the start please help dude."
,supergloo,2011-09-24T01:45Z,"dont worry i fixed, but when playing its really slow and laggy how can i make it more smoother game play?"
[T],Hyperdrive25,2011-09-27T16:14Z,"For smoother gameplay, choose SoftRasterizer
in the Config, 3D Settings option.

The game should work even on a Pentium 4 machine, given you have 1Gb of DDR2 RAM and you have at least a 256MB Graphics card. If you have a SATA Hard Drive opposed to a IDE Hard Drive, you should have a better performance.

Computer Upgrades are cheaper now then ever before, so upgrading RAM, HD or Graphics Card is feasible. "

,Kcap2000,2011-10-10T22:53Z,"For those who cant save even after deleting the things on the battery folder, make sure you run it has admin if you aren't already."
,kerlmeister,2011-10-17T18:39Z,Does anyone know how to speed up gameplay? Like on gba emulator you can hold the space bar to accelerate gamespeed
,Jakeler,2011-11-18T05:24Z,Trying to get this to work for my girlfriend... Ive tried to save with the Emulator it self and also from the game menu. Neither workd. Ive deleted the files in the battery file. Im not sure what else to do could anyone else explain what they did? How to load the game when saved ect ect.
,DNATorrents,2011-12-27T19:44Z,Great torrent mine loads fine saves fine no problems here 
,DoingYerMom,2012-01-03T14:23Z,why is the game running in slow motion?
,XeksX,2012-01-16T10:57Z,"The quick Save State does not work for me guys, but the Save State As worked. Just save the state in the rom folder or something. Then start up the game by dragging the rom into the emulator. When it has started to boot up, just drag the save state into the window and it will load directly. And if everything is in slow motion, as Hyperdrive25 said;
