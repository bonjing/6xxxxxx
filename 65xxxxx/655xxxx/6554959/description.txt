                PokÃ©mon Black and White PC [Hyperdrive25]
                +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
PokÃ©mon Black Version and White Version (Poketto MonsutÄ Burakku Howaito, Pocket Monsters: Black & White) are role-playing games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. They are the first installments in the fifth generation of the PokÃ©mon series of role-playing games. First released in Japan on September 18, 2010, they were later released in Europe on March 4, 2011, in North America on March 6, 2011 and Australia on March 10, 2011.

Similar to previous installments of the series, the two games follow the journey of a young PokÃ©mon trainer through the region of Unova, as they train PokÃ©mon used to compete against other trainers, while thwarting the schemes of the criminal organization Team Plasma. Black and White introduce over 150 brand-new PokÃ©mon to the franchise, as well as many new features, including a seasonal cycle, fully animated PokÃ©mon sprites and triple battles. Both titles are independent of each other, but feature largely the same plot, and while both can be played separately, trading PokÃ©mon between both of the games is necessary in order to complete the games' PokÃ©dexes.

Upon their release, Black and White received mostly positive reviews; critics praised the advancements in gameplay, as well as several of the new PokÃ©mon introduced. Reviews, however, were divided on some of the character designs, and some critics felt that the games did not innovate as much as expected. Nevertheless, the games were commercial successes; prior to the games' Japanese release, Black and White sold one million consumer pre-orders and sold five million copies as of January 2011, making it one of the best selling DS games to date.

Gameplay
++++++++
PokÃ©mon Black and White are role-playing video games with adventure elements, presented in a third-person, overhead perspective. There are three basic screens: an overworld, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures their party, items, or gameplay settings. The player begins the game with a single PokÃ©mon, and is able to capture more using PokÃ© Balls.

When the player encounters a wild PokÃ©mon or is challenged by a trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen where the PokÃ©mon fight. During battle, the player may fight, use an item, switch the active PokÃ©mon, or flee (however the player is not permitted to flee a battle against another trainer). All PokÃ©mon have hit points (HP); when a PokÃ©mon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and cannot battle until it is revived. If an opposing PokÃ©mon faints, then all of the player's PokÃ©mon who participated in defeating it receive experience points. After accumulating enough experience points, it may level up. A PokÃ©mon's level affects its battle statistics, and some PokÃ©mon will evolve upon reaching a certain level threshold.

New features
++++++++++++
The graphics were further improved from previous games, and include more cutscenes. When talking to people, the dialog box has been changed to speech balloons, which appear over other characters' heads, allowing more than one character to speak at once. In addition to this aesthetic change, Japanese players will be given an option to switch to having kanji appear on screen, rather than just hiragana and katakana. During battles, the sprites of the PokÃ©mon are fully animated and the camera changes position to highlight specific parts of the battle.

In addition to the day and night cycle first introduced in the Gold and Silver games, Black and White introduces a seasonal cycle, with the seasons advancing every month, cycling every four, rather than being linked to the actual calendar. Outside areas appear differently depending on the season, such as changing of leaves in autumn or snow on the ground in winter. Certain areas are only accessible during certain seasons, and different PokÃ©mon can be found in the wild in winter where others are encountered in the other seasons. In addition to these features, the PokÃ©mon Deerling and Sawsbuck were designed to change their physical appearance along with the seasons of the game.

There are two new battle mechanics in Black and White: Triple Battles and Rotation Battles. In Triple Battles, both teams must send out three PokÃ©mon at once. The PokÃ©mon that can be targeted by any specific attack is dependent on the position of the PokÃ©mon in the line up; PokÃ©mon on the left or right sides can only target the PokÃ©mon directly opposite of them and the two PokÃ©mon in the center position on both sides, while PokÃ©mon in the center can target all PokÃ©mon in the field. Positions can be changed, but this uses up the player's turn. In Rotation Battles, both sides send out three PokÃ©mon at once, again, but instead of a three-on-three match as seen in Triple Battles, it is a one-on-one match where the PokÃ©mon in the front can be switched with either of the two other PokÃ©mon sent out without using up a turn. Depending on the game version, one of these two new battle types will be found in greater quantity than the other, with Black having more Rotation Battles than Triple Battles, and vice versa in White. Related introductions are the Combination Moves; the starter PokÃ©mon from any game can be taught one of the three moves that can be used in combination with each other to produce more powerful attacks. Another battle mechanic is found in the wild, where differently colored and styled tall grass enable Double Battles against wild PokÃ©mon.

A new PokÃ©mon capture mechanic was also introduced in these games, referred to as "phenomena" in supplementary materials. Occasionally, the player can find rustling patches of grass and rippling water. If the player enters the tile that featured the phenomenon (or uses the fishing rod on the tile), they can encounter either a rare PokÃ©mon, a PokÃ©mon more common in the other game version, or the highest evolutionary form of a PokÃ©mon that can normally be found in the area. This method is the only way to capture PokÃ©mon such as Audino, Emolga, and Alomomola. In addition to these, dust clouds in caves and the shadows of flying PokÃ©mon on certain bridges can also be entered to either find a rare item or encounter Drilbur, Excadrill, Ducklett, or Swanna, none of which can be found in the wild otherwise.

In addition to the standard battling and Gym challenges, the player can compete in PokÃ©mon Musicals, a side-game similar to the PokÃ©mon Contests of previous games; the Battle Subway, similar to the Battle Towers and Battle Frontiers of previous games; and on the Royal Unova,[Note 1] a cruise ship that the player can ride daily and fight various trainers aboard to win otherwise rare items.
