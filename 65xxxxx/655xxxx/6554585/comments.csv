[S],velvet.,2011-07-21T08:36Z,A .ts file is a poor choice for a file that you wish to share with others.
,Squeezert,2011-07-21T20:25Z,"It's just as is, straight from satellite. Anyone who wishes can always convert it to something else. i didn't want to compromise quality."
,Squeezert,2011-07-21T20:43Z,"btw, the set list is much longer. For some reason it does not show the entire text here."
,Squeezert,2011-07-21T22:58Z,At least a dozen of people have the entire file now. Why isn't anyone seeding???
,dfxsilva,2011-07-28T16:07Z,"this is it? does the concert have viva la vida? how long is this concert? 

i'm from brazil... so. excuse my poor english"
,Squeezert,2011-07-31T20:22Z,"Yes, it has viva la vida :)
The length of the performance is approx 90 minutes."
,KKOPPI,2011-08-23T19:55Z,"Takes ages to download...
But I saw the low quality version of Viva  la Vida at this concert on youtube...and I think it is one of the best performances ever recorded!"
