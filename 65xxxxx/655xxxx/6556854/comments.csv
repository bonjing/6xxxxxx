,redmanmh27,2011-08-03T17:47Z,does any one know how do i get round the cinavia protection. because im usin it on my PS3
,Delron41,2011-08-16T04:56Z,Someone please solve this Cinavia bullshit. You sceners are smart motherfuckers so what's the deal?????
,Desert_Punk_555,2011-08-23T13:23Z,"So a way around the Cinavia protection bullshit has recently come to my attention. All you need to do is go to your date settings and change your date forward to 2012. Sounds too easy but after trying pretty much everything else that has been suggested i thought wot the fuck i'll try it, and it worked for me... You'll have to do it every half hr or so but i'll take that... 

Lets hope those fucker at sony don't catch wind of this too soon or they'll prob fix it. So Mum's the word.."
