,ManLemon,2011-07-23T20:07Z,"@Elmo, your behaviour is admirable. I was just asking since it wasn't posted on TPB yet that it may have been forgotten. "

,deBeauharnais,2011-07-28T20:32Z,"I was afraid that season 4 would be crap, since it is almost totally american. And it was for episode 1 and 2.
But the 3rd episode has an excellent gay sequence and they mock religion. So it's ok. Average americans will be afraid of it. Good."
