Dr. Eric Rabkin traces the history of science fiction. Though he explains how he genre developed as a response to the new found pressures of science and technology in the Industrial Revolution, he also refers throughout the course to the roots of science fiction, including the legends of Faust and the Golem, the Greek myth of Prometheus, and Sophocles' Oedipus Rex. Mary Shelley's rankenstein introduced the world to science fiction, at the time an outgrowth of romantic and Gothic literary traditions.

Professor Rabkin introduces the writers and editors who helped to shape science fiction. The love of science associated with science fiction is evident in the works of Edgar Alan Poe, Jules Verne, and especially Isaac Asimov. Many people consider H. G. Wells the single greatest influence on the formation of science fiction. As he outlines the history of the genre, Professor Rabkin shows that the early evolution of science fiction was predominantly European but that, thanks to pulp culture and the dime novel, modern science fiction is a largely American phenomenon.
