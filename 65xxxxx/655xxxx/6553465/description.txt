Hi There,


I was digging through some tucked away items and found this audio. As I listened to Eric, It sounded like "One More Car One More Rider" - 2001 - Most of the collection appears to be there but not all,  I dunno why. The other "boo" factor is that for some reason, the audio is in mono? Info online states that there should be "Dolby 5.1" available but for some reason my CD's contain this product. I still like the collection though and thought I would post it anyway. Nice surprise with the Preston track "Will It Go Round In Circles".....
