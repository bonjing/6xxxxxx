,saequa253,2011-07-20T23:46Z,"picture and audio quality is very good, but for me the picture occasionally slows downa bit, im not sure if its the file or something in my configuration but this is the only file i have ever seen it happen. But the hardcoded subs are fuckin awful...whoever made them had zero understanding of the english language...its basically a word for word translation using google translate...90% of it makes no sense - and since you cant get rid of em, id suggest gettin another copy"
