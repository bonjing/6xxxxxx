 Manual Therapy in Children presents a comprehensive conceptual approach to the subject of manual therapy for children of different ages. This approach considers the relationship between the neuromusculoskeletal structure and function at different stages of development and places strong emphasis on the prevention of problems as the child develops as well as on their safe and effective treatment and management.
