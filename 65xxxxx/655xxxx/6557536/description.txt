Good beaches with soul-warming sun, crystal-clear waters, and fragrant sea air can be found on virtually every island of the Caribbean, with the possible exceptions of Saba (which has rocky shores) and Dominica (where the few beaches have dramatically black sands that absorb the hot sun).

Golden beaches shaded by palm trees and crystalline waters teeming with colorful tropical fish â€“ itâ€™s all just a few hoursâ€™ flight from the East Coast of the United States. Dubbed the â€œEighth Continent of the World,â€ the Caribbean islands have an amazing variety of terrain that ranges from thick rainforests to haunting volcanoes, from white- to black-sand beaches. Spicy food, spicier music, and a gentle, leisurely lifestyle draw millions of visitors each year, all of whom are searching for that perfect place in the sun.
