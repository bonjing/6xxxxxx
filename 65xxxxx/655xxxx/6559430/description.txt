Similar to the original Madagascar game, Escape 2 Africa plays out in a series of platform levels, featuring exploration, collection quests, and light combat. Players change characters to fit the challenge. Gloria can knock over enemies with her size, and she's also an excellent swimmer. Melman has special healing powers, and the ability to toss objects great distances. When there's a need for speed, Marty's the right zebra for the job, and Alex is a good choice for platform exploration, with his special ability to climb poles and vines.

New characters introduced in the sequel, such as King Julian and Moto Moto, offer their own special abilities and bonuses, and the penguins are back as well. Also like the original game, Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa features a selection of mini-games for single players or a whole family, including soccer, racing, rhythm-based dancing, and safari photography challenges. In a creative collaboration between DreamWorks and Activision, some locations have been expanded for feature in the game, including the Watering Hole, the African Savannah, the Volcano, and others.
