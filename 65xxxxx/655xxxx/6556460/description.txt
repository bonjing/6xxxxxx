The Internet has had and will continue to have a profound effect on society. 
It is hard to imagine life without such technologies as computers, cell phones, 
gaming devices, and so on. The Internet, World Wide Web, and their associated 
technologies have altered our social and personal experience of the world. In 
no other time in history have we had such access to knowledge and raw information. 
One can search the Library of Congress, the Louvre in Paris, and read online books 
and articles or watch videos from just about any country in the world. We can 
interact and chat with friends down the street, in another state, or half way around 
the globe. The world is now our neighborhood. We are a â€œwiredâ€ society who lives a 
significant amount of our life online and tethered to technology.
