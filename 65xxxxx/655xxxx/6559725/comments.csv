,braniacfive,2011-07-23T16:32Z,You probably won't believe how much I have looked forward to the last two re-seeds of these! Great work!
,braniacfive,2011-07-23T16:42Z,"Thanks for Number 9!

If you could re-seed any of the following, I'd be grateful:

* The Lucy Show (Mania) 1986--stuck at 99.7%.
* Eyeless in Gaza - 1986 - back from the rains
* A Drop In The Gray - Certain Sculptures (re-seed)
* new wave complex vol 01
* new wave complex vol 02

braniacfive, except for Eyeless in Gaza - 1986 - back from the rains which I'm seeding, these were on my old HD, I don't have the original torrents anymore."
,braniacfive,2011-07-25T14:42Z,Thanks '80s. Someone just finished up Lucy Show for me so I am seeding that one. Patience will be my virtue.

,80spreferred,2011-08-15T21:54Z,So glad you could repost this.  The 5-9 vols are 5 less I have to request or wait for again:-)  Never heard of 85% of what you have posted.  Really good music!
