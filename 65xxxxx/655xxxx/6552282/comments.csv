,jvozzy514,2011-07-20T17:09Z,definately watchable! 
,bucky19,2011-07-21T09:49Z,"I have seen it at the cinema twice, there isn't anything missing and this really isn't bad quality for a cam.  very watchable, not perfect but come on its a cam... does have subs but didn't bother me too much.  excellent size really."
,McfcDan,2011-07-21T19:12Z,"Bucky19, the two camera copies that I downloaded before I decided to go to the cinema to watch it myself are different from the actual screening. There are two noticeable parts that are missing in the cam copies and both parts are on the bridge, there could be quite possibly even more cut outs but I didnt watch closely enough to monitor each scene. 

I don't want to announce any details on here, but there are definitely two bridge parts missing."
,McfcDan,2011-07-21T19:27Z,"It appears that I was wrong lol. After checking the camera copies I noticed the two bridge scenes, no idea why I couldnt remember this when I watched the cam at first.

I apologise for wasting time, if you could, please delete my comments :)"
,nitish.90,2011-07-21T20:21Z,Guys how sound and video...
,Nve74,2011-07-22T06:36Z,"It has no sound when I open it with DivX, does anyone have any Idea on how to fix this?"
,sumfun3,2011-07-22T12:03Z,"Very fast download.  Good quality for a cam.  Very watchable.  Thank you UltraTorrents.

V7 - highlights washed out, sometimes a little rippling on screen, maybe a tiny bit cropped from original picture.
A8 - good audio, but out of sync by a couple of seconds in a few places."
,charyuop,2011-07-23T16:06Z,With bandwith cap raging around I wouldn't waste downloading 4G for a non high quality DVD rip. For a cam record this file serves the purpose.
,MoldyKittenz,2011-07-25T17:36Z,"Guys, I'd recommend seeing this in theatres. These guys deserve our money for the performance they have given us for the past 10 years."
