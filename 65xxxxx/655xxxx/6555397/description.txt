Fourth album from violin-toting pop-punk quintet follows 2004\\\'s \\\'Ocean Avenue\\\'. On this second major-label release they continue to refine their sound, adding jazzy guitars and power ballads to the mix, and, taking full advantage of their increased budget, allow violinist Sean Mackin free rein to cover the album with epic string arrangements. Includes the title-track single.
