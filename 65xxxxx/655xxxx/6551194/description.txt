HOW TO USE:
The user is presented with a high-quality 3D model of the full Muscle. The user can zoom in to any area - by tapping on it. The user can rotate, get inferior or superior views, cut away layers of muscle or label an area with a simple stroke of their finger. The user can navigate up and down within the muscle system at absolutely any angle. The user can also use the scalpel button to add or take away layers of connective tissue.

Each label has a 'i' icon where the user can access additional information for that part.

INDEX:
Select an item from the index list and the application will automatically zoom in, cut away other layers of muscle and identify that label. This function enables the application to be used as an innovative visual reference tool.

VIEWS:
Access a different view (anterior, lateral, posterior, medial, (inferior or superior when available) at anytime and in anyplace within the application using the 'Views' function.

QUIZ:
This is a unique testing function developed from user feedback. The user selects an area to be tested on and then the app randomly zooms into and labels a part that the user must identify from 6 possible multi- choice answers. For incorrect answers, immediate feedback is given
