Balls Of Fury DvD Rip

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this secret society, the competition is brutal; the stakes are high; and the balls - more often than not - are white! 

Welcome to Balls Of Fury - a film about the unsanctioned, underground, and utterly unhinged world of clandestine ping-pong tournaments. Down-and-out former professional ping-pong phenom, Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler), is sucked into this maelstrom when FBI Agent Ernie Rodriguez (Justin Lopez) recruits him for a secret mission. Randy is determined to bounce back and win, and to smoke out his father's killer - arch-fiend Feng (Christopher Walken).
