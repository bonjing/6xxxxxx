I have tried downloading another Man United game ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6549779/FULL_MATCH_New_England_Revolution_v._Manchester_United ) upped by dalpreston and currently there are 50 of us stuck at 85.7% because nobody has the full downlaod apart from him and he's not seeding, been that way for two days.

Here is a better torrent for this game:
