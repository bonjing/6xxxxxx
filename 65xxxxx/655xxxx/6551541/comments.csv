,mljucko55,2011-08-21T16:27Z,"@SAMNhaNc3

Thank you very much.

Video 10/10
Audio 10/10
Movie 10/10
Rip 10/10

Like tenkre1 wrote above me, how about doing Matrix series in 1080p. most of the versions out there are either too big or their sound is badly ripped so it's too quiet. 

so if there is such thing as a request list guess many people would like to see your rips of
Matrix Trilogy. I would add Fight Club 1080p wish too.

Thanks anyway anyhow anywhere :)"
