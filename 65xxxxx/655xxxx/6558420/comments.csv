,bhutan_6,2011-08-02T15:23Z,Great torrents. Thanks. I have a request to everyone. Can you upload 2 rare Gamecube games (NTSC-U) Star wars rouge squadron 2: rouge leader and Prince of persia: sands of time in Piratebay. Thx in advance. Both of the games are in IGN's all time 25 best GC games list.

,MrSan.,2012-06-05T18:10Z,I have a copy of this game and the disc doesn't works on my 4.0U Wii. But I don't know if the files are exactly the same of this torrent.
