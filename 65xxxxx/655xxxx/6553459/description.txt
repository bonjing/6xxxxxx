Plot    

Kyle and four friends are white suburbanites who set off for a debauched night in Las Vegas before Kyle gets married. But things go badly wrong when a prostitute is skewered on a coat hook as she entertains one of the pals, Michael. Yuppie Robert keeps his head, and goes so far as to murder a security guard who threatens to discover their little accident. The next step is to dismember and bury the bodies and then to return to LA and pretend nothing happened. Of course, guilt and nerves set in and outrageous steps are needed to keep a lid on things. But nothing -- absolutely nothing -- is going to stand between bride-to-be Laura and her trip down the aisle.
