In 1961, the Ark, a Cybertronian spacecraft carrying an invention capable of ending the war between the Autobots and Decepticons, crash lands on the far side of Earth's moon. The crash is detected on Earth by NASA, and President John F. Kennedy authorizes a mission to put a man on the moon as a cover for investigating the craft. In 1969, the crew of Apollo 11 lands on the Moon to explore the craft.

In the present, the Autobots assist the United States military in preventing conflicts around the globe. During a mission to Chernobyl to investigate suspected alien technology, Optimus Prime finds a fuel cell from the Ark, discovering it had survived its journey from Cybertron. The Autobots are attacked by Shockwave who manages to escape. After learning of the top-secret mission to the moon, the Autobots travel there to explore the Ark. There they discover a comatose Sentinel Prime â€“ former Autobot leader â€“ and his creation, The Pillars, a means of establishing a Space Bridge between two points to teleport matter. After returning to Earth, Optimus uses the energy of his Matrix of Leadership to revive Sentinel Prime."

,blusniffer,2011-07-21T22:06Z,"Globe to start with, please drop the "" I'm the expert professor + u lot are the students "" attitude which apart from being a little weird sounds like verbal diarrhoea of a man trying to sound superior in poor english!
Please remember that ur sticking a bad cam through the ancient/shit dub plugins not directing the movie!!!!!!!"
,blusniffer,2011-07-21T22:11Z,"Oh and god bless ( as you say) all the uploaders who give the community great quality movie files, i added a -1 on this torrent due to A-4,V-4.
Wait for an R5 guys!"

,cheraption,2011-07-22T19:41Z,"i downloaded today many films and if i wanna see it, theres says: i need download coralplayer !? so that mean, i cant watch these movies ??? "
,blusniffer,2011-07-22T23:37Z,"Thanks globe for your reply, had to read two or three times as you speak english like Yoda + i can tell "" Pissed and sulking you are "" about my comments! lol
I'm not a movie critic, don't want to be a movie critic, my comment was a review of your torrent quality, not the actual movie!
I've been part of the PB community for 4 years and always thank the uploader if it's watchable!"
,blusniffer,2011-07-22T23:46Z,"Just checked out 20 of your uploads and it seems i'm not the only user who has received bitchy replies when being critical of the poor quality of your torrents.
Don't expect users to kiss your ass b'cos you put someone else's cam file through a plugin and reupload it as your own kid!"
[V],globeplus,2011-07-23T08:44Z,"To blusniffer : unfornatly it is for guys like you that decide to implicate with fair nice work from the uploaders that we see less files available sometimes and it is a lie what you said about the work for this movie , the original had bass environment with particles on the background of the picture , the dub plugins corrected them , of course i pushed the bitrate to the minimum possible keeping the stability of the picture to get the size but if you pick up a normal nice converter and convert to a high-quality avi or mp4 you get a nice bitrate and the definition of the screen picture improved and still watchable as a flv anyway , this work is absolutly correct for wherever you look , give me a favour and stay away from my files now on because you are only implicating without a real valid motive giving false suspicious about honest work , please and i think you are fair enough , no matter whats going on my files stay away from them and my comments . Thank you and have a nice day ."
,blusniffer,2011-07-24T03:13Z,"Sadly on PB if you can't take the heat don't upload your files. I've lost count of the Thank you's I've given to uploaders so if you treat every bad comment as a conspiracy against you your more fucked up than i thought.
Don't panic i won't be uploading your other files as games/camera version torrents seem to be your favourite, i'll stick to quality uploaders!!"
[V],globeplus,2011-07-24T12:22Z,"To blusniffer : sorry for only now that i can answer but you are full of bullshit because you know that the work is correct for any user including slownet speed users and files worked more carefull as possible that can be useful to anyone independtly of the net speed are welcome too , you donÂ´t have the correct respect from the uploaders work no matter what you say , learn to be correct in your appreciations before start descriminating other peoples work that will be more human for you and one of this days you can get only a slow net speed and then this type of work can be your best shot to get a nice new movie or maybe you are a kind of hurry and this type of work is fine to start watching the wanted movie , who knows ? so , i donÂ´t care if you thanked other files or not , keep away from my files and comments specially with false especulative commentarys that can induce the possible users in doubts about the download and please improve yourself as a person !!!

Cheers ..."
,blusniffer,2011-07-25T01:13Z,"I'm not inducing anything, try listening to yourself! There is no conspiracy, it's a free pirate site and not even the good uploaders like extremezone/bone etc can tell someone to stay away from their files let alone an imbicile who uploads shitty cams and thinks he owns the site.lol

Upload speeds has fuck all to do with the quality of an uploaders torrent, u take a shitty cam from someone else, change the brightness,gamma etc with the poor dub plugins which u use EVERYTIME and reupload as your own then you act like a wounded diva!! LMAO"
,5amjr,2011-07-25T01:22Z,"@globeplus whats with the big paragraph replies because Downloaders are being critical of your torrent, if they don't like it, tough but i kinda agree with them, the quality is not great!
You'd get more respect if you didn't react as if the torrent was perfect and if you uploaded some Blurayrips instead of re-doing cams all the time!
Just a thought."
[V],globeplus,2011-07-25T11:25Z,"Hi everyone : the intention is more pratical movies files as possible that anyone independtly of the net speed can download in more or less time , i taked close 15 hours to get and do the work preparing this file and not uploading files and only beeing contesting the other uploaders work it is really much more pratical and users with nice net that resolves to implicate with the low lifes slow net speed are not the correct sharing spirit that wants more nice files for any possible users on the site that means with any net speed , the work of the dub plugins it is really great and i use them very well beside the necessary codification hours , the intention is to get the best work possible for lower size as possible and with that better for everyone the movie file , some respect for who have nice construtive ideas making files turning them more pratical it will be nice , not only contesting at the minimum detail and implicating no matter what , the conception and the work is correct but maybe a little understanding is welcome too ... the impression is that no matter what is no compreension at all ... good day for all of you and nice movie ...

Cheers ."
[V],globeplus,2011-07-25T11:34Z,"Hi again , ok i taked the decision that in future files i will try to improve a little bit the bitrate if possible without increasing too much the size but without exagerate anyway ...

Nice day for all of you and it is correct and ok the work on this one ."
