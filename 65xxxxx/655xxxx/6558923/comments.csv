Be assured I will seed this full force for a few days. So don't be surprised if it takes a couple hours to download, good things come to those who wait!! Love, DrScott"

,scottsasse,2011-09-12T07:35Z,"OK boys and girls today's lesson is important: Alright people I am still seeding my torrent full force!! However in the past week or so I am seeing less and less seeders and now it is down to 2 seeders, ME being one of them. To top it off I've got 12 leechers one of which is at 93.2% finished. My sincere hope is when that leecher reaches 100% in the next few minutes that he will join the seeders and seed back at least 150% of what he got. People this is what makes torrents work and gives the next guy who downloads this 3 seeders instead of 2 and so on. For those who don't know this WILL increase the torrents download speed and keep this torrent alive and healthy. If anyone does not understand this or know how to seed, then see me after class at  DrWynnScott@gmail.com  and I will be happy to answer any questions in a way that even a noobie could understand.
