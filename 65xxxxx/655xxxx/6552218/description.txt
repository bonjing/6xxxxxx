It can sometimes feel like you've run out of ideas when it comes to pasta and noodles. Once you've cooked Spaghetti Bolognese, Macaroni Cheese and Chicken Chow Mein, you can be left feeling a little uninspired. In comes Paul Gayler, who provides his personal selection of the very best, from old favourites to new, fresh ideas and not forgetting innovative baked pasta dishes that bring colour and much-needed flavour to even the most jaded of palates. A good pasta or noodle dish relies on the combination of flavours, whether in time-honoured classics Lasagne al Forno, Pasta Carbonara or new, exciting, more adventurous Tagliatelle with Creamy Brie, and Baked Smoked Haddock Pasta. Paul's collection of recipes means you need never worry about knocking up a stunning, healthy, quick meal ever again. Ranging from ragu and ravioli to wok fried noodles and Japanese style noodles, this cookbook is bound to inspire and excite every tastebud.
