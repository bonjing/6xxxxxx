After two excellent disaster flicks, The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering
Inferno, Producer/Director Irwin Allen, by now dubbed "The Master of Disaster",
came up with this massive slab of ennui based on a novel by Arthur Herzog.

A swarm of African killer bees start off the movie by killing everyone in an
army missile base, then moving on to a tiny Texas town called Maryville, then into
Houston, which gives the Army a chance to burn the city to the ground. The 
insidious insects are finally taken out by ripping off the Bert I. Gordon
giant Grasshopper epic, The Beginning of the End - an unfortunate realization
that is not helped one whit by sting victims hallucinating giant bees!

A metric ton of veteran actors can do nothing against a stultifying script and 
lackluster direction.  The special effects, at least, are very good.


starring: Michael Caine, Katherine Ross, Richard Widmark, Bradford Dillman, Richard
Chamberlain, Henry Fonda

This is not the 116 minute theatrical version, no , that would be MERCIFUL. This
is the Director's Cut, weighing in at over two and a half hours! SUFFER, HU-MANS!


enjoy ;]
