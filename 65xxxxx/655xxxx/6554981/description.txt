What is it about?

Being rebels, we walk our own righteous line - without the music industry. We are hardworking family members and quite down to earth about dreams of becoming famous rockstars. And yes, we know we\'re pro.
Our music happens the way WE want and WHEN we want.

Our Goal

ItÂ´s nothing less than distributing our music as far as possible, all over the world. If you like it - please share it. Every single one of you should help if you like the stuff. Burn it to CDs and gift it - or use places like Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, Forums, Release-Blogs, Chats etc. to make VOTJ to be something on everyoneÂ´s lips. We donÂ´t want your personal information and you donÂ´t need to register/sign up anything - we just wanna give you our music and you shall carry it out to the world.
