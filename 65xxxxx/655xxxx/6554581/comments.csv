,hootieman,2011-08-20T04:06Z,whens episode 6 coming?
,Mikeman2000,2011-09-01T05:10Z,There is no episode 6. At least there isn't one planned... Yet...

Well pleased! 

Works fine. 
The only issue i noticed occurred on Windows 7 64-bit systems (two tested) and on them both the frame rate on the in-game movie scenes began skipping/stuttering badly. Both were high-end machines: a quad core and a triple core with 4GB ram each and N-Vidia Geforce graphics cards. 
On Windows 7 32-bit systems i tried they played out smoothly as anything (and these were much lower spec machines than the 64bit ones tested and with budget 3rd-party GeForce cards.) 

Fantastic game series. Thanks again, uploader."
