,viedma,2011-07-22T20:16Z,"hamzaibrahim1983, if we were all muslims, the cloud of ignorance and backwardness that would descend over the earth would be worse than the European dark ages. You only have to read the Quran WITH OPEN EYES TO ALL THE RIDICULOUS IMAGINERY in it to realize this... The famous so- called golden age of muslims in Spain and elsewhere was the result of the rediscovery of classic greek culture and other elements brought from India and elsewhere. 
Islam is the mindless repetition of scripture and endorsing barbarous practices like sharia law. But it will never happen, of course, itÂ´s just a towel-head wet dream..."
,TylerDyrden,2011-07-23T00:32Z,"To reach that kind of hate means that wael is actually making a difference so kudos to him and others like him who have a message to spread free of hate.

Hazem, I would not waste my time in trying to develop a theological discussion with those who are ignoring the facts about the spread of Islam in the past and the present especially when their discussion involves terms like ""towel heads"" and lest we forget the lovely tags of this torrent.

Some of us have a passion about how we live our lives and learn to co-exist with those different while others rather use their time in spreading hate to fill their empty, mundane, goalless, pointless and miserable lives.

Spread what you believe in since this serves as nothing but a bona fide proof that you are jealous haters of wael and islam.  

Flame away you lovely trolls!  For once they were blind and perhaps one day they will see :)"
,sarsapil,2011-07-23T00:46Z,"Its those who spread fantasies and ignorance disguised as religion who call those who expose them as having hate in their hearts, of course, it hurts them... As you say, maybe its those who have their eyes covered by a towel who will one day drop it and see the truth and also the big imposture  that is the Quran. "

Any moron can quote a sentence out of context and twist it around!

The Bible contains hundreds of quotes (inc Jesus calling a non-jewish woman a ""dog"").

I'd call you lot a$$holes but at least that aperture in the human serves a vital purpose!!"
,emmemmess,2011-07-23T02:59Z,Well said Tyler ! ! ! ! !

On your bike buddy!!"

This condescending attitude of one who claims to be one of the true faith, but instead seems to suffer from a well-developed superiority complex speaks volumes. :)

Oh, and don't feed me the usual 'taken out of context' bullshit. The meaning of those sentences will not be affected by any word-twisting (and I'm no fan of the Bible either: if there is a God he would know how to speak to us so that his words do not require interpretation, and hefty volumes of explanatory texts).

,qwertzo99,2011-07-23T13:20Z,What a bunch of lies...
,qwertzo99,2011-07-23T13:25Z,"The verses that these people take to ""prove"" hatred of islam is just an example of how evil THEY are actually. They take one verse but leave the next where it say for example that fighting the unbelievers is only allowed if they attacked you first, what can a muslim do in war etc. None of these people who spread hate actually read a translation (or correct translation) of Qur'an but feed their hatred from some hate website that I see on the net and regularly have some joke about. I don't see what will you get with this hate talk except portray you as having nothing important to do than spread hatred."
,rajin.33,2011-07-25T16:15Z,"Rustgold, 

To point this important fact out, ""infidels"" do not refer to Christians, but to pagans and those who did not believe in god. Why? Because In islam all prophets, Moses, Jesus and Mohammad are holy and this would be senseless! Also at that time this was completely a norm, where people fought in wars for their religion to prevail. You do also remember the Crusades I hope? 
But that's back in those days and not to meant to be practiced further to this day. And only if some extremists decide to alter religion and stupidly engage in terrorist acts, then they do not represent Islam. In the same way I don't judge and label ALL Christians and the core of the religion based on the Norwegian Fundamentalist, Muslim-hating Terrorist killing 90 on Friday 22 July, nor for any other extremist christian or Jew in labeling and demonizing a whole faith! It's very easy to stick to stereotypes and follow the mass, but its a challenge to think independently and to fight irrational hate mongering stereotypes.

you have made some impartial comments on my ""save gaza"" torrent, which was initially promising in my eyes. What I would've expected of you was more than this! To seed only a torrent that promotes hatred for muslims? ESPECIALLY thru those who have no idea what the core of Islam is about, and that have taken so many lines and history OUT of Context with malevolent intentions to create hate. I thought you were an individual who thinks freely and doesn't spread hate for whole people's belief and religion.  

What I seed is, pro pacifist, and pro liberation of Gaza, and I have insisted on that multiple times. 
Why can't we all quit stereotypes and hatred, and only hate and condemn the haters !? And live together in peace? 
May there be peace in Gaza and Palestine and Israel, and may way be patient and tolerant in living together with different faiths."
,ramikaz,2011-07-31T16:36Z,"Rustgold is:

a) a kike
b) a queer
c) a cow worshiper
d) more than one of the above

and thus his hatred and jealousy of normal people is not excused, but more understandable."

,thequran,2011-09-26T05:29Z,"Approximately one-fifth of the world's population is Muslim. Estimates conclude that the number of Muslims in the world ranges between 1.2 to 1.57 billion. Muslims are the majority in 57 countries, 
By God If Muslims are as ruthless as you are hellbent on depicting then None of Non Muslims would be alive 

Just google and you will find how muslims are being slaughtered in the world Palestine,Kashmir,Bosnia,Iraq,Afghanistan

Why you are adding insult to the injury"
