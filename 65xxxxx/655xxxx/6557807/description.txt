In The Truth about Muhammad, you'll learn

â€¢ The truth about Muhammad's multiple marriages
(including one to a nine-year-old)
â€¢ How Muhammad set legal standards that nuke
it virtual!} impossible to prove rape in Islamic
countries
â€¢ How Muhammad's example justifies jihad and
terrorism
#The real "Satanic verses" incident (not the
Salman Rushdie version) that remains a scandal
to Muslims
â€¢ How Muhammad's faulty- knowledge of
