Multi-instrumentalist Roland Kirk (he added the Rahsaan in 1969) was so noted for playing a variety of instruments--often several at once--that sessions where he limits himself to one type of instrument, like this 1961 date, sound somewhat odd at first. Even while playing nothing but woodwinds, Kirk easily sidesteps the usual pitfalls of the all-woodwinds album, most often a certain limp treacliness. This is due in large part to an undeniably funky backing trio powered by the brilliant organist Jack McDuff, but Kirk's own playing is as meaty and impassioned as ever. He opens the set with whirlwind solos on "Three for Dizzy" and continues with the powerful title track and "Funk Underneath," a track showcasing bassist Joe Benjamin and drummer Arthur Taylor that forecasts the soul jazz of the late '60s. Even an utterly unironic cover of "The Skater's Waltz" escapes lightweightness.

Rahsaan Roland Kirk (1936-1977) was a blind American jazz saxophonist, perhaps best known for his ability to play more than one saxophone at once. 

Kirk was born Ronald Kirk on 7th August 1936, in Columbus, Ohio, but felt compelled by a dream to transpose two letters in his first name to make Roland. After another dream in about 1970 he added Rahsaan to his name.

His playing was generally rooted in soul jazz or hard bop, but Kirkâ€™s encyclopedic knowledge of jazz history allowed him to draw convincingly on any element of the musicâ€™s history, from ragtime to swing and free jazz. Kirk also regularly explored classical and pop music.
