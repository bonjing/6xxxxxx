,macnamo,2011-07-20T22:05Z,"this appstore version included apple id , we cannot install it from such dmg from appstore"
,nafolha,2011-07-20T22:06Z,seed pleaseee
,macnamo,2011-07-20T22:13Z,bundled with apple id
,hotrock3,2011-07-20T22:29Z,You must have a super fast connection with OP because I don't even have enough to even try to install. It appears to be the .dmg pulled from the .app file.
,happytoes,2011-07-21T00:48Z,Please seed! im only getting...okay a really really speed. 
,casperboo,2011-07-21T05:04Z,"This DMG will install with no problems if burned to a DVD or imaged to a USB Drive and used to boot the machine from.

If you try to install from the desktop itself by running the installer from within the DMG, it may warn you that you did not purchase it, but holding down the CTRL key and then clicking the install should by pass and install just fine."
,casperboo,2011-07-21T05:05Z,"I'm sorry, I believe it is the Option key and not the CTRL key you must hold down before clicking the installer."
,djmurphix,2011-07-21T06:43Z,"can i be able to update via software update, when updates become available or will it say its not activated? or need apple id to proceed? thanks "
,errorofdeath7,2011-07-21T07:49Z,"@casperboo

will i be able to do a clean install without having it ask for an apple id to proceed? The other torrents requires an apple id in order to do a clean install. the upgraded install works fine but i'd rather have a clean slate. thanks in advance :)"
,hotrock3,2011-07-21T08:51Z,"@errorofdeath7 

You can do a clean install. It won't ask for an apple id since it isn't packaged with the install app that you download from the app store. It behaved just the Snow Leopard disk. Mount click install, it does a few things, reboots finishes installing, reboots into Lion."
,hotrock3,2011-07-21T08:52Z,"@errorofdeath7 

In the case of a clean install you can format a thumb drive to be a bootable clone or burn it to a dvd."
,kdaker,2011-07-21T17:15Z,is there anyway to upgrade with this .dmg using my own apple id?? ive already purchased it from the appstore but my internet speed is very slow and the download keeps cutting... can i download this and still be legit?? 
,hotrock3,2011-07-21T22:17Z,"@kdaker 

If you have purchased it from the app store it does not matter where you download it from, you have paid for the rights to use it.

It would be like saying that because you bought a car from Ford's online store and that they have to deliver it to your house and you aren't allowed to pick it up at a local dealership."
,parth007,2011-07-23T18:58Z,can we update this from software update

,TakeNotez,2011-07-30T20:26Z,"Installed just fine, but isn't complete.  Missing basic apps and Ipad interface desktop.  Is there something more I need to do?  Does anyone else have this problem?"
