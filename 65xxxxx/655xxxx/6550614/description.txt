I posted the live show a while back but it never seemed to take off. I thought I would include an audio rip of "FRONT ROW" VHS with this repost. Some people might be interested in that one too. They are both in Flac and have Md5 & hash files also.


If your a Margaret Becker fan I think you'll enjoy. T'was before the Pop Gloss...
