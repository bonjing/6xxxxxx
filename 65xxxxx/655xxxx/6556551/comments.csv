,uggenabben,2011-07-22T10:50Z,Strange size....
,john4551,2011-07-22T11:26Z,its not a xbox or xbox 360 size file
,{HMP},2011-07-22T16:18Z,"this is a iso image from the original retail disc, i didn't invent the game, i didn't create the file size either, blame the guys who made the game !!!

this took only a few seconds to convert to iso so the file size is accurate


just before i run poweriso, the auto play poped up and it said in the d: (dvd burner) 

UDF Video

this small file size was on a DVD-R Disc

i only crack games/software i don't invent them pmsl !!!

once again........ COPIED FROM ORIGINAL RETAIL DISC (DVD-R)"
,bush82,2011-07-22T16:20Z,"THIS GAME HAS BEEN TESTED ON 4 XBOX360 MACHINES THAT "" ARE NOT FLASHED "" AND WORKS 100%

BECAUSE THIS GAME WAS COPIED FROM THE "" ORIGINAL RETAIL DVD "" IT CONTAINS THE "" ORIGINAL "" XBOX360 CODE

this alone makes me think its fake all games are copied from retail discs"
,bush82,2011-07-22T16:21Z,unless its sega rally from the marketplace
,realdealx,2011-07-22T20:19Z,got 2 be a fake ther is no xbox 360 game that size pluse thers no video file witch you need 4 the 360 2 read the disc

,mikels12,2011-07-23T16:37Z,no matter whichever way it's compressed the total size of it just doesnt make sense and even if it is a 360 it probally wouldnt be worth playing
