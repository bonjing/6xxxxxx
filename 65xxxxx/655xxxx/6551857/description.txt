The title translates as "The Little Parade," but even English-speaking filmgoers will recognize La Cumparsita as the name of a popular Tango tune. This Argentine musical biopic centers on the life of Mattos Rodriguez, composer of "Cumparsita" and generally regarded as "The Father of the Tango." Hugo del Carril, Argentina's leading singing star, plays Rodriguez with gusto, though admittedly he's a better singer than an actor. The film is lavishly produced, with entertainment value aplenty for both cosmopolitan and rural audiences. Still, Variety dismissed La Cumparsita as containing "no U.S. value." ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi
