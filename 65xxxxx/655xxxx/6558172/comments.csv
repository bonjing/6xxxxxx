,kev0188,2011-08-16T01:24Z,"Is this the ACTUAL game or just the mods and saved games? bc i dowloaded it and all i have is this autorun the says modds or completed files, if its the actual game how do i install it?"
,Thekapow,2011-08-21T18:25Z,"This download is such a waste of time, it stand clear that a lot of work have gone into this release (custom installers and so on), but it is just way to messy made, and fonts are missing in the installers.. it is not in english (the installers) but you have the choise of choosing english but this only changes about 8% of the text in the custom installers.. the time you use on figurering out how to install is very long, and i used half of that time downloading another release and install all the mods i wanted.. so go download one of the other exelent torrents out there.. but not this one.. i give this 0,5 out of 10 "
