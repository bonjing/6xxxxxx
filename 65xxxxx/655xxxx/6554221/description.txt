Why do we keep burning money to punch holes in the sky? Here's some good reasons. An ode to the people and reasons of manned space exploration. Begun in 1986, refined over 25 years, recorded in two sessions at the Challenger Seven Memorial during the last shuttle flight, edited, compiled and released on Moon Day 2011. The final version will go on an album; this is a preproduction version, complete but not the final quality. Please seed this, but more so, please share this. It is given freely because it is, I believe, a message to important not to spread.

From Shepard to last shuttle,
a true believer in The Dream.
