,Riddhiman,2011-09-20T20:11Z,"@TvTeam, Can u upload Jurassic Park (1993),laserdisc if you have it. I am dying to have JP laserdisc rip which had more picture information on all four sides of the screen than the DVD, plus as far as I remember from watching a VCD version of the LD -EXTRA SCENES than the current DVD version. Even if it doesn't have extra scenes can u please upload it. And I have the DVD version of which I am tired of, and not planning on getting the Bluray either . 

Please, please If you have it please make a rip and upload it. I have requested many others but few either have it or are simply not interested in helping. I live in India , otherwise I would have got myself an old laserdisc copy of the film and made a rip. Please help, and please reply back !

P.S: And/Or if you have JP2 as well on LD then can you upload that also. "
