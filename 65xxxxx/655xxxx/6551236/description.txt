Description

GarageBand turns your iPad into a collection of Touch Instruments and a full-featured recording studio â€” so you can make music anywhere you go. Use Multi-Touch gestures to play pianos, organs, guitars, drums, and basses on your iPad. They sound and play like their counterparts, but let you do things you could never do on a real instrument. Enjoy a full range of Smart Instruments that make you sound like a pro â€” even if youâ€™ve never played a note before. Plug an electric guitar into your iPad and play through classic amps and stompbox effects. Use the built-in microphone or a guitar to record, or capture any performance. Then mix up to eight tracks to create a song you can share.

Play your iPad like a musical instrument.
â€¢ Perform on dozens of musical instruments on the innovative Multi-Touch keyboard.
â€¢ Tap out beats from the seat of acoustic and electronic drum kits.
â€¢ Recreate legendary guitar rigs on your iPad with 9 amps and 10 stompbox effects.
â€¢ Record your voice using the built-in microphone, and apply fun sound effects.
â€¢ Use the Sampler to create an instrument from sounds you record, then play them on a keyboard.

Create a song anywhere you go.
