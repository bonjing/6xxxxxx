    Johnny Depp stars in John Waters hilarious juvenile delinquent
    musical comedy extravaganza. Wade "Cry-Baby" Walker (Depp) is
    the coolest, toughest hood in his Baltimore high school. His
    ability to shed one single tear drives all the girls wild,
    especially Allison Vernon-Williams (Amy Locane). A beautiful,
    rich "square," Allison finds herself drawn into the world of
    Cry-Baby and his "drape" pals. Soon she finds herself eagerly
    inhaling the evil influences of rockabilly music and fast cars.
    Spoofing Elvis movies and Juvenile Delinquency scare films of
    the '50s, this movie follows the adventures of Cry-Baby who,
    though he is sent to juvie, is determined to cross class
    (and taste) boundaries to get Allison back.
