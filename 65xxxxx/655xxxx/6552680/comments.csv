,ultrapulse,2012-01-18T00:26Z,"DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use KMS Activation firstly you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know if its installing Trojans or other viruses onto your system and secondly it only activates it for 180 days. Activate it permanently with a serial and by ringing Microsoft and getting the conformation ID, that way you know you are safe and secure and also you know it is permanently activated.

01. start Word.
02. If the activation window appears close it.
03. Go to menu File, Help, Change Product Code, and then enter key:
828CH-G4FPY-HMH4R-32GCK-6D9BH or 3W3MQ-H7M6X-3WYP7-TPCH6-8G8T2
04. Untick the ""Activate over internet"" box at the bottom, and click ""Next"".
05. In the window that appears click ""Install"".
06. When finished the Install process, close word an then reopen Word.
07. An activation window will appear (if not, go to menu File, Help, Activate).
08. Select the ""Phone Activation"" option, and click ""Next"".
09. Pick your country, then ring the number and follow the instructions.
10. When asked for your ID, input the code given in the Word activation window. it will say ""this product code is invalid"" and you will need to talk to the operator and give them your installation code that Microsoft gives you and they will give you an activation code in return
11. When asked which edition, choose business/volume use, used only on 1 pc.
12. A code will be given back, and enter the code into the activation box.
13. Click ""Next"", and Office will say that it's permanently activated.
14. Close Word (and any other Office 2010 application).
15. Restart Word, and go to Help to check the subscription status.

Office 2010 is now fully and permanently activated.

it is a business/volume license (you can install on multiple computers) and when you call microsoft you should have heard an automated voice saying something like ""we do not collect any personal Identifiable information about you"" so you are safe if you are worried about that.  "

The original KMS activation suite has no malware in it..
Download it from the author directly..

Activation pirated software by phoning Microsoft is the stupidest thing I've seen on the net in a long loooong time.
