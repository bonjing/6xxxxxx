,jolopy,2011-07-22T22:49Z,I keep getting a license invalid error and the front panel is non-existent. I've done all the installation correct as per the readme. Any help?
,mysteryfancy,2011-07-23T09:03Z,"@ jolopy
No, I have no problems and the aircraft was working fine.
Install the airplane into a ""working folder"" and not in the direct path of FSX, then distribute the unzipped folder manually. Maybe it works then.

@ Thank you very much, mickyfinni."

Install T-38A

Copy mvalkdj.dll to C:\Windows.

 Go to your dll.xml file located in:

C:\Windows\Users\YOUR USER NAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\FSX

- Open xml file via notepad or any editor you want.

-Add following entries:


    MilViz_T38
    False
    False
    K:\FSX\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\Gauges\MilViz_T38.gau

,piratepilot,2011-07-24T12:37Z,"@hitchup

Thanks dude however this does not work. Appreciate yours and mickfinney efforts. Its what the readme states to do as well.

My FSX dir is on ""E"" so my dll.xml path is ""E:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\Gauges\MilViz_T38.gau"". 

unless for reason it needs to be ""E:\FSX\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\Gauges\MilViz_T38.gau"" which also tried but don't see how it would see the path this way.

Im running XP 64-and tried the ""mvalkdj.dll"" in both ""WINDOWS"" root directory, and also in ""windows/system32"" folder. 

Thanks again unless you see something wrong in my dll.xml path, I'll give this one a miss."
,AlteredRealitii,2011-07-24T19:15Z,"
The very first time I installed this I had the same errors as piratepilot but I eventually got it to work. Here's what I did:

I placed the mvalkdj.dll file into both the C:\windows\system32 and C:\windows folders because I couldn't get the gauges to work when I just placed it into the system32 folder. It probably would have worked had I just placed it into the C:\windows folder and not into both at the same time. 

I created a folder on the desktop and extracted all the files for the install into that folder.

I manually placed all the files from there into there respective places in the FSX folder where they would have normally been installed to as mysteryfancy had suggested. Basically every file and folder from the extraction needs to be copied, pasted and merged into the Microsoft Flight Simulator X main folder. 

Then I located my dll.xml file at 
C:\Windows\Users\YOUR USER NAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\FSX as per the readme file states, and I added the lines to the file. Make sure that this:


    MilViz_T38
    False
    False
    K:\FSX\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\Gauges\MilViz_T38.gau


is located before this line



and change the path to exactly what your path on your computer is to point to your gauges file regardless of what drive it's on because my drive is the A drive and I got it to work.

That was all I did. I also disabled my AV during all this all the way up to till after I made sure everything was working fine. Probably another step I didn't have to take but I'm just stating exactly what I did.

I hope this works for everyone as it did with me and helps people out who are having trouble. This is a great aircraft so thank you mickyfinny for the crack and mysteryfancy for the suggestion.

,piratepilot,2011-07-25T12:00Z,"Geez fellas thanks for all the help. I'm impressed.

Any way, let me ask something @hitchup

In your screenshot of the dll.xml your path reads as follows ""K:\FSX\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\Gauges\MilViz_T38.gau"", so are you saying use this path even though my install path is in ""E""?  

I think its conflicting with another addon. Thanks again."
,mysteryfancy,2011-07-25T12:33Z,"@ AlteredRealitii

What you wrote is absolutely true!
Glad to help if I could. The plane really works very well!

@ Pirate pilot

Another little tip: If a Windows x64 system (eg WIN7 user) has the mvalkdj.dll file should follow eden also copy the folder C: / Windows/SysWOW64."

,mysteryfancy,2011-07-28T21:57Z,"So, I checked it.

The download works.
When unzipped, then yields the two folders. One is empty, for whatever reason. In the other, the exe and the crack is included.
I have unzipped with WinRAR and you can ignore the error message. I have no idea why this is so.

It would be great of course, would someone upload a working version, without the errors.

I hope I could help you with it."

,man314,2012-03-11T02:53Z,Malwarebytes anti-malware detected a trojan in one of the files in this torrent.  When I used 7-zip to upack the rar I noticed a file that needed to be put in the windows system 32 folder.  That immediately sent up a red flag so I scanned the file with malwarebytes and it immediately detected a trojan in the file.
