,LoLzAtOr,2011-10-16T20:35Z,"Any idea when the fifth book will get a pdf like the other ones?

This is the best ASOFAI torrent the quality of the first four book is perfect!

Just hope the fifth book get the same release soon :)"
,vinczemarton,2011-12-09T09:08Z,The EPUB version of the fifth book misses a whole lot of chapters! Be careful with it.
,Owen_Meany,2012-02-09T01:36Z,"in the epub of ADwD all the chapters are there but the table of contents isn't linked to all of them. ie it will say 
Owen...pg 50  Meany...pg 100
when its really
Owen...pg 50  john...pg 60 irving...pg 80 Meany...pg 100
(I made up chapter names to avoid spoilers)"
