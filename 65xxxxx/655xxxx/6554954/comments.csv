,j0nnyboy,2011-08-17T01:26Z,Thanks uploader. Good quality. Switch to track 2 for English.
,FloydO89,2011-08-18T10:50Z,Good quality but how do you switch to track 2????
,jamesclay4,2011-08-24T11:02Z,Good quality s=8 v=7 but I am also unsure how to switch to track 2 for English? The Russian voice over makes watching impossible. Would I need to download again??
,burgercito,2011-08-29T07:48Z,"@james

Just download VLC media player and switch to track 2 under the Audio menu."

Same videos but English only (Russian audio tracks removed)."
,FRivera,2011-11-04T07:21Z,Thanks man! V9 a10 Russian switches off in VLC. No watermarks.
,d3athraz0r,2011-11-27T18:38Z,"Great collection  , great quality !!!
With Vlc player go to Sound->Audio Track->Select Track 2 and Russian is gone , just like that ;)"
,nitin_sandhu,2012-04-29T00:21Z,"For non-VLC user who stream video, this is how you get rid of the track (better disable it).
