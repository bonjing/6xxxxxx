Zeke Deadwood: 

Hes tough. Hes heroic. Hes... really, really stinky. Like gag-inducing, 
birds-falling-from-the-sky stinky. Hes Zeke Deadwood, zombie lawman, and 
if youre a no-count outlaw looking to rustle up trouble, youd best be 
moving on! A villainous band of varmints has taken over a small town, and 
the townsfolks only hope is an undead loner. Can Zeke stop the drunken 
rampage of terror? Will the townsfolk even let themselves be saved by the 
undead?

Created, drawn and co-written by award artist Thomas Boatwright with Ryan

tale of Saturday matinee action with a healthy dose of B-movie horror
