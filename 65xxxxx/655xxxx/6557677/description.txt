I don't usually do single albums, but most of the torrents I found were fake or pass worded BS, so, my effort goes to save you yours. As with all my other torrents, 320, 500x500 art, proper ID3's.

I don't usually do a track listing, but, so there's no question before you click your download button.


1. "Time of My Life"
2. "When You're Young"
3. "Round and Round"
4. "Heaven"
5. "Race for the Sun"
6. "Back to Me"
7. "Every Time You Go"
8. "What's Left"
9. "On the Run"
10. "She Is Love"
11. "My Way"
12. "Believer"

    Deluxe Edition Bonus Tracks

13. "When You're Young" (Acoustic)
14. "Every Time You Go" (Acoustic)
15. "The Silence Remains"
16. "Train" (Demo)

      iTunes bonus track

17. "What's Left" (Acoustic)

Also combine with my full discog torrent (up to this point) for a truly complete 3DD.
