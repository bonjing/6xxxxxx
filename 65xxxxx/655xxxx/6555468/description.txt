Libera - Song of Life
Song Title: Song of Life
Original Release Date: 13 April 2011
Label: EMI Music Japan

Here is the digital audio of Libera's "Song of Life". This song features on Libera's Japanese only 'mini-EP' CD release (the CD has a duration of 30 minutes, contains eight tracks and "Song of Life" is the only new song).

The music was written by Japanese composer Takatsugu Muramatsu, the words written by Robert Prizeman (who also did the arrangement) and the extraordinary solo on the recorded track was performed by Ralph Skan. Four seconds into the song, you hear a few single notes on a piano and then the single ethereal voice of James Mordaunt, followed by Ralph's solo in the opening verse. Light percussion, accompaniment, and certainly not least, the other boys join right before the chorus. Three minutes and twenty two seconds of truly magnificent Angel Voices!

"We shall never be alone
as we link our hearts in one,
Joining voices from above
all in the miracle of life.
Through the ages we will grow
only time will ever know,
as our voices magnify
all in the miracle of life.
Love plays along in our lives yet to come
as we join in the song of life."

I am sharing this because:

  1. it's Libera!

  2. it's a "Japanese only 'mini-EP' CD release"
