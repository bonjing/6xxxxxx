Why mkv since it is the standard. I did not Create the files. I gathered them from different places on the net and put them into 1 folder

,AWizeGuy,2011-11-02T22:06Z,"The rookie asked, ""Why MKV files""?  Because AVI stinks as far as quality & the mkv container is very flexible, where a 400 meg mkv looks better than a 700 meg avi if done properly."
