,rsl87,2011-07-22T23:37Z,Forgot to mention that it's also cinavia protected
,brian_15,2011-07-23T09:48Z,rsl87 is Correct i downloaded this earlier and watched about 20 min on my PS3 then the cinavia protected message popped up and muted the audio.. -_- it Gets Very irritating when you start getting interested in the movie then that message pops up its Ruins my day knowing i spent my time downloading somthing that i cant even watch on my Ps3...

,DarthPS3,2011-07-23T21:17Z,"I don't get uploaders lately. If it has Cinavia you would think it would be important info to share, so many people wasting bandwidth to dl a movie they can't watch."
,DarkVOX,2011-07-24T04:49Z,"Honestly guys, just encode the movie with Handbrake.  It's a free program and it works perfectly.  I use it all the time and playback on Xbox 360 and PS3 is flawless."
,mojtabata2001,2011-07-24T09:52Z,thanks dear froggie 
,Powerslave0,2011-07-25T03:09Z,"Cinavia is what it is, and will be in all new movies, you would be wise to just assume ALL non DTS releases will have it.  

You need to have a PS3, HDMI to a DTS receiver and use DTS = NO CINAVIA.   You will get it in all other sound tracks.   When using MKV2VOB for the MKV file, the PATCHING DTS stage is what you need to see, then you will have NO CINAVIA messages.

Either get the right equipment, or DEAL with it, it's called Copy Protection for a reason."

I'm so tired of PS3 users bitching about cinavia. Get an Xbox 360 and stop being a pussy, or better yet plug your PC into your TV via a VGA or HDMI/S-Video cable like the rest of the world and use your gaming console for playing games."
,dreileon,2011-07-30T04:27Z,But this doesn't play on the xbox 360... : ( how will i be able to play this to my xbox?
,JetxBlack,2011-07-31T17:50Z,A PS3 is a copyrighted product ... ur playing copyrighted material on ur ps3 and ur sad it doesnt work all the time? and as xBSAACHRIS434x said plug ur pc in ur tv n be done with it
,TyMod,2011-08-14T18:11Z,"Quit crying about Cinavia.  If oyu had a Media PC or Xbox you wouldnt have to worry about it.  You can RIP the Cinavia protection from the movie using DVDFab.  

This tells you what the hell cinavia is: http://www.dvdfab.com/cinavia.htm

I'm sure there are other programs that will also decrypt the file for you if you don't like DVDFab or if it doesn't do what you want."

Pretty good movie. A little cheesy in some parts, but not more than I expected. Enjoyable.

As for the quality: superb. Relatively small file for the resolution. Great job."
,Basnagus,2011-08-24T21:42Z,"Hey anyone else have the problem with the framerate is states is ""FRAMERATE...: 23.976 NTSC"" but after DLed it shows framerate 1348 frames/second so is corrupted data when trying to load onto PS3???

Alright now the Cinavia Bullshit there are a few fixes/workarounds for this

1. Change the file type from MP4 to M4V
2. Change the date and time on your PS3 to a few years and months later may have to repeat this..

try them out see if it works for you #1 works for me (with another torrent Priest 2011 BRRip 720p H264-3Li)

Enjoy!  thnxs froggie"
