havent checked the duration on the scifi one but the real one is 1u 40 mins so either this is scifi or its missing some minutes"
,Wilsson002,2011-08-07T11:04Z,"Yeah, when IS the ""real deal"" going to come? WTF is happening with that production?"
,Damien74,2011-08-27T19:35Z,"Why would you keep releasing this screwed up, stupid movie over and over as the real deal?
Fucked up!
This is totally worthless and the real one is NOT finnished yet."
,DMNKLR,2011-09-18T04:53Z,"Ok, at everyone saying ""It's not the real one, it's the SyFy one"", THAT'S WHERE THEY PUT IT, morons!  Try going to the After Dark site and checking it out under ""after dark originals"", then watch the trailer.  It shows that it was aired on SyFy back on February 26th, 2011.  Geez, now quit trolling."
,Damien74,2011-09-26T02:02Z,"DMNKLR yeah.. only the SyFy one isnt called Area 51. So still not right.
But its not the the uploaders on PBs fault."
