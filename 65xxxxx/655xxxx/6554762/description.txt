These are the Revit 2012 extension tools.
If you are a subscription customer you can get these from the subscription login.
If you are not then here they are as you have paid for them anyway, Autodesk is just to lazy to build them into the current release.

THIS IS THE NEW TOOLS.

Bridges with roads and terrain

Timber with wood framing walls

Modeling with Exell based model generation, Frame Generator, Grids Generator

Miscellaneous with Elements positioning, Freeze Drawings, Compare Models, Text Generator, Content Generator, Shared Parameters converter.

I HAVE INSTALLED THESE AND THEY WORK FINE, EVEN ON THE CRACKED VERSION OF REVIT AVAILABLE ELSEWHERE ON THE PIRATE BAY.
