videos being ripped means...decreasing der quality...not just removing them completely......so must clearly mention that...videos are not included.....to make people clear....ripping dem means reducing der size...not to just completely remove dem from the game...."
[V],Subzero!,2011-07-23T22:45Z,"full rip = video's encoded to lower quality
rip       = something is RIPped. in this case the vids."
