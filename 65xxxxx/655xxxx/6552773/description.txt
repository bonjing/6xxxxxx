Issues in Economic Thought

As it is well known, the present is rooted in the past. For this reason by studying the past, we can better understand not only some basic principles of the ideas proposed by modern economics, but also some make some recommendations to meet future economic problems of society. A huge literature has been developed on the theories and approaches of the most eminent economists. However, there is not much literature analysing contributions different from English-language on several concrete topics. For this reason, this book tries to cover this gap. In this sense, three aspects are considered: the contributions of Italian authors, Smithsonian approaches on education, growth and moral aspects, and, finally, some modern contributions.
