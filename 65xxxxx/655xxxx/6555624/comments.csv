,MrFishyFace,2011-07-25T19:07Z,"@didiisbored: It DOES say TS; i.e. Telesync; i.e. A movie filmed in the cinema. Similar to a cam, but the Audio of a TS movie comes from the headphones at a drive ins, or from the output on the projector in the cinema"
,w00th00t,2011-07-29T21:49Z,LOL @didiisbored did you expect a HQ file of a movie that just last week opened?
