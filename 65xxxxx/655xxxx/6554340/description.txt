The 1 hour Beginners Workshop talks about the tools needed for wet on wet painting as well as the basics on using those
tools.  At the end he shows a painting project that HAS been seen on the TV show.

The 3 hour instructional workshop goes into more detail on hour to use the tools, create effects and correct errors.  At the end he completes a painting project, I believe that this is a new painting never seen on TV, but i am not sure.

The other 9 programs are 1 hour instructional videos, so Bob Ross goes into more detail than in the TV show.  They each are a new painting that has never been seen on the TV show.

Note:  Any errors that you see in the videos were on the DVD.  It seems that these were transferred from VHS to DVD, so they do

have a couple of issues, but they dont take away from the program.

I hope that you enjoy these videos.  Please leave a comment telling me what you favorite one is, mine is #6.
