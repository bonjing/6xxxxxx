[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-20T18:52Z,It is epicly disturbing :D
,JimmyTalent,2011-07-20T20:04Z,What is the point in uploading if you're not gonna SEED?!
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-07-20T20:26Z,"Think before you comment. There's a tracker problem, hence, we can't see any seeds. And nobody's forcing you to download anything."
[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-20T20:38Z,Thx GH - Youre right - There are more than enough seeds - We just cant see them because TPB is broken and half the day lists everything as 0/0 no matter what.

thanks for the ul :-)"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-21T04:03Z,Make sure to check out THE BOYS - this is a mini-series set within the overall storyline.
,MuserClair,2011-07-21T10:36Z,"oh, i'm completely hooked on The Boys - epic comic book series!  love the dark storylines and humour, and the visceral artwork is awesome!  i'm just hoping Ennis carries on past the 70 issue limit he mentioned in an interview a while back.  life after The Boys is not something i want to contemplate!"
,MAGIC_HATE_BALL,2011-07-22T01:58Z,The BOYS!
[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-22T04:36Z,"True I hope he keeps going. Unless he has envisioned an end the whole time that will tie up everything. I want more, but dont want one of those series that go too long and start ruining everything."
,siriusly999,2011-07-23T11:23Z,Thanks man!
