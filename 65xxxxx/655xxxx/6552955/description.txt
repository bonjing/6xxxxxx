Product Description: A culinary treasure, The Martha Stewart Living Cookbookâ€”The Original Classics became an indispensable reference when it was first published. Now, years later, comes its companion volume, The Martha Stewart Living Cookbookâ€”The New Classics, which includes an index for both volumes and collects more than 1,200 of the best-of-the-best recipes that have appeared in Martha Stewart Living magazine since 2000.

From the practical to the inspirational, from quiet suppers for two to dinner parties for ten, The Martha Stewart Living Cookbookâ€”The New Classics has options for every meal and every cook, with family-pleasing classics, new fare, and twists on both. Whether youâ€™re looking for an easy weeknight dinner such as Tuna Steaks with Mint Sauce or a sophisticated hors dâ€™oeuvre like Prosciutto Crostini and Fresh Figs with Gorgonzola or a rich dessert like the Ultimate Malted Brownie Sundae, The Martha Stewart Living Cookbookâ€”The New Classics provides excellent choices across 22 categories. In addition to recipes for all-time favorites such as Lasagne Bolognese, Chicken Soup with Dumplings, the Best Onion Rings, and Apple Pie with Cheddar Crust, you will find helpful how-to photographs that demystify preparations for piecrust, gnocchi, souffles, and more. Here, too, are cooking tips and techniques, nutritional information for healthy choices, comprehensive pantry and equipment glossaries, menu ideas, and a resource guide for finding ingredients.

With the same stunning color photography and easy-to-follow, comprehensive format that grace the pages of Martha Stewart Living and The Martha Stewart Living Cookbookâ€”The Original Classics, this new volume is a must-have reference that will become a loved and oft-used favorite of every home cook.
