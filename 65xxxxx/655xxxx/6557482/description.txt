I added ID3 tags using Sony Vegas Pro 10.0. I had the songs from a lot of different sources, so many contained advertisement from the website, or incorrect tags. 

Please note that:
- The Hardstyle remix is actually called D Mind - Blizzard, but I changed the ID3 tags so it would fit with the other torrents. 
- I do not know who exacly made track no. 6. Some say Roman, other say Afrojack... I just choosed Roman, but change the ID3 tags if you like.
- Don't complain if I didn't add your favorite remix, but just add it yourself. I cannot smell what kind of remix you like :)


If you enjoy this torrent, please consider buying the music legally.
