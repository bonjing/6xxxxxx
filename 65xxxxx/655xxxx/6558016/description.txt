JustPlanes GOL 737-700 737-800 RIP by ..::LoLa::..

DVD
GOL Transportes Aereos, launched in January 2001 as the first low-fare airline in Brazil, is the fastest growing airline in South America. GOL is also the largest operator of the Next Generation Boeing 737 in Latin America. The airline operates both the 700 and 800 version of the aircraft on routes across Brazil.


After an introduction to the company and a look "behind the scenes" we follow a crew on a 4-day trip across Brazil in the cockpit of the B737-700 including several approaches and landings at the very scenic Santos Dumont Airport located in Rio de Janeiro.

We complete the program with a day on the B737-800 from Sao Paulo to Porto Alegre with stopovers in Florianopolis.
