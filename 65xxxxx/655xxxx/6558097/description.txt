SONNY THOMPSON CAT ON THE KEYS
Label: Swingtime
Format:Mp3@320

From the album notes
Born in Chicago on 23 August 1922, Sonny studied at the Chicago Conservatory of Music.His first gigs were at the CafÃ© Society as a solo act but he has since fronted many orchestras in size from 18 men to a small combo of 5.

His first recording â€œ Long Goneâ€ was a tremendous seller and became the top instrumental of the year 1948. The mixture of  Sonnyâ€™s pianistic AND Eddie Chambleeâ€™s tenor sax work was unbeatable .

â€œLong Goneâ€ was followed by many more successful instrumentals that you can find on this record. All these fine driving drag blues place the accent on selling the beat and will make wonderful items for the dance crowd

And if you wonder who is the beautiful gal on the front cover, itâ€™s no more than  Lula Reed ,Sonnyâ€™s wife and a terrific blues singer who could hopefully be here on one of our next releases

Bandleader and pianist Sonny Thompson was among the most prolific R&B instrumentalists of the late '40s and early '50s. Thompson began recording for Sultan in 1946, then did several sessions for Miracle, King, Federal, and Deluxe, while also backing vocalist Lula Reed from 1951 to 1961. Thompson scored two number one R&B hits for Miracle in 1948: "Long Gone," Pts. 1 & 2, and "Late Freight." He landed another Top Ten and two more Top 20 singles for Miracle in 1949, and then had three Top Ten hits for King in 1952. The biggest was "I'll Drown In My Tears," which reached number five. ~ Ron Wynn, All Music Guide
