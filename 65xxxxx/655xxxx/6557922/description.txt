Chick Corea Akoustic Band Rendezvous In New York

Chick Corea reassembled his Akoustic Band as one of several units that he featured at the Blue Note in New York City over a three-week period in 2005, with all three men being very comfortable in both straight-ahead jazz and fusion, though this date focuses exclusively on the former. Bassist John Patitucci and drummer Dave Weckl have kept up their respective chops, joining the pianist for a driving interpretation of John Coltrane's "Bessie's Blues" to start things off very well. Weckl's brushes and Patitucci's spacious bassline complement the leader's elegant treatment of "Someday My Prince Will Come." Corea's explosive post-bop vehicle "Humpty Dumpty" is a gem, while his inspired landmark composition "Spain" (which evolved from JoaquÃ­n Rodrigo's Guitar Concerto) is far more abstract than usual. The camera work, audio, and editing are excellent in this concert DVD. ~ Ken Dryden, All Music Guide
