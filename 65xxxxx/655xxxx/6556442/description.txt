ALL praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, the Most

blessing upon Your slave and Messenger Muhammad and
upon all of his companions.

Short Description: For Muslims the coming of Ramadan is a source of joy and celebration; however, we celebrate in a way that may seem strange to people unfamiliar with the tenets of Islam. Ramadan is not a month of parties and socialising, it is a month of worship. To fast the month of Ramadan is one of the pillars of Islam.
