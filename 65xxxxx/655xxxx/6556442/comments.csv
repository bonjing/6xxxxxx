They dont.
u cannot comment on something that u really dont understand. You have to study Islam in order to say something about it and by study islam i mean to study the Quran and the sunnah and hadith. You just cannot make certain websites and blogs as basis of your allegation. Plus some muslims doing bad things make them bad rather then the whole Islam."

Its funny how we never see Baptist ,catholic ,Satanists or followers of thor blowing themselves and others up in the name of their god   
I guess it takes allah to inspire his followers to kill themselves "
