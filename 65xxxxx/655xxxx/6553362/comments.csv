Awesome burn, but wasn't the best movie.

Kind of funny when they shake the camera Star Trek style and half the actors fall down"
,y3n007,2011-07-22T04:36Z,This looks pretty bad.....I think I pass.....
,polzkey,2011-07-22T06:18Z, yea the movie sucked ape dick....they should skullfuck the producer who made this shite

Great rip, crap movie.

Watching this movie was kind of like watching snails race except in the movie, you are hoping that something interesting happens.  Really poor script."
,edxven,2011-07-24T11:34Z,What player should I use for this? My quality is pretty shoddy with VLC
,primalclaws1974,2011-07-26T08:11Z,"ok, not the best movie on the planet, they only had a 500,000 dollar budget, only special effect I saw was the girl walking off the cliff, and that was hilariously lame, but the plot idea was pretty ingenious, just sorta fell flat wo a good ending. If u dont expect too much, u wont be too disappointed, its worth what IMDB gave it: 4.5...but if yr bored, its prob worth a watch."

It was actually a pretty good movie, however it was very odd. If you like odd + horror movie you'd enjoy this. "
,Focus88,2011-09-17T21:07Z,Thank you.
,xenochx,2011-11-13T05:22Z,"I don't normally comment but this movie was just....  soo bad. Please don't waste your time watching. Nothing even gets explained in the end and it's just absolutely horrible all round. It doesn't explain why they walked down the road, what happened to them or what happened to the last guy. It just *SPOILER* shows him sitting in a movie theater watching his dead wives dream and him screaming and then flash and the theater is full of rotting dead people which quickly flash away. So many questions are left unanswered in this movie. Like what the music was, what was the flashing light the guy saw in the distance, what happened to the people of Friar. Just basically everything. * END SPOILER* But if you still want to watch this movie for fuck sake do NOT use headphones. I was already part deaf before but now I think I lost all hearing in my left ear. 


My rating
A: 10
V: 10
M: 2 (And that's being generous)

It really could have been so much better."

V=10
M=5(?)

The plot was good and interesting, but they could've done a better job in storytelling. If you like deep musings in which you have to actually go deeper beyond the ulterior meaning of the film then maybe you'll like this.

Great rip by the way."
