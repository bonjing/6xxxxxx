[V],Mbb15,2011-08-11T22:24Z,"I'm retired as torrent uploader BTW... Im uploading somewhere else now (mostly direct links) its more safe for me and my downloaders, search 'Mbb15 blogspot' and you will find it. I will keep my torrents on the TPB ofcourse and mayby I will do 1/2 big game uploads, but that must be along the lines of a new GTA or something. PEACE"

Download AppInstaller from ""market"".
Download this rootexplorer to your computer, then connect your phone to the computer using your USB cable.
Transfer the app (rootexplorer) to your SD card.
Disconnect your USB cable from your phone, start the AppInstaller and you will see the rootexplorer in the program....click ""Install""

DONE!"
