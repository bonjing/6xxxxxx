Why This Album Is So Great:

This is one of the best five albums of all time. It\\\'s quite a statement, I know, since your taste in music changes over time. But, \\\"Secret Samadhi\\\" just represents everything I treasure the most about music right now. Practically everything on this album is genius, and I can only say that if you do not own this album yet, GO GET IT!! Critics generally say that Live\\\'s second album \\\"Throwing Copper\\\" is their best, but \\\"Secret Samadhi\\\" is less confused and more whole. \\\"Throwing Copper\\\" is also on my top 50 list, but there is just that small difference making this album perfect. I will not mention any song in particular since they are all great. Actually, it\\\'s pretty difficult to describe an album your treasure this much. So I can only hope you feel the same way about it or are curious enough to give it a listen. I did and my taste in music was influenced by it. I guess in a way that this album can take some of the credit for me turning towards more alternative music and feeling comfortable with it.
