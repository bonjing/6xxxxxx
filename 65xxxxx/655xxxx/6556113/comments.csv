[V],DownTYU,2011-07-22T03:30Z,I was on a tour far away from internet otherwise I could've uploaded the subs two days ago.
[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-22T03:32Z,so what?! why upload this in the first place? we have a subbed version! the quality on this one is not any better...............
[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-22T03:34Z,"dupes are bad. one day you will realise, when half your torrents die."
[V],DownTYU,2011-07-22T04:11Z,"Of course dupes are bad, but this torrent is not a dupe...plus torrents die because of greedy idiots running as fast as they can with their ass on top of their head the moment download ends and not giving each other a single byte."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-22T12:49Z,"these kind of torrents die because of dupes, and this is a useless dupe. one day you will realise."
