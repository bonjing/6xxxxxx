         ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Dungeon Explorer: Warriors of Ancient Arts is a video game developed by Hudson Soft available for both the Sony PlayStation Portable and the Nintendo DS handheld game consoles.

Dungeon Explorer: Warriors of Ancient Arts is an action RPG game similar in style to Phantasy Star Online. It features wireless connectivity to allow multiple players to connect to each other. It also allows for online play using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection on the Nintendo DS.

The Sony PSP version features 3 races and 6 beginning classes that the player can select from at the beginning. After a certain point, the character has the option of changing classes while not in the dungeons, each of which retains its own rankings (Rank E all the way up to Rank S.) There are also 6 advanced classes which require a combination of two of the basic classes; one at rank B and the other at rank A. These advanced classes include the abilities of the previous two classes, plus new abilities of their own as well as unique weapons that can be wielded. All of these abilities are acquired as the characters level up their weapon ranks as well as their job ranks, and two of these can be equipped and changed on the fly.

The Nintendo DS version contains also 3 races with 3 warriors each. Once selected, players choose points they distribute on their character. The type of arts they are given is done in the Artrium in the Lost Forest.

The bulk of the storyline for the PSP version takes place in various dungeons, as the title implies. Each dungeon is unlocked after various quests are completed by acquiring "plates" and can be leveled up by inserting jewels in said plates. Each level is more challenging than the previous one and can be selected at any given time. At one point Dungeon level progression is stopped until an item called a Sirius Jewel is acquired, a reusable item that unlocks further dungeon empowerment. Specific levels have specific challenges in them, such as Level 6 of a dungeon are considered blind; without the usage of a specific item, the mini-map is blanked out with only the character icons visible.

The jewels have multiple purposes in addition to powering up dungeons, they can be consolidated, used in alchemy or installed onto weapons are armor. These jewels are elemental in nature and match each element of the dungeons, which follow a planetary theme (Neptune, Saturn, Jupiter, etc) In addition, each element has a status ailment associated with it.
