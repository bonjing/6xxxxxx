,iknouluvmi,2011-08-05T21:31Z,"I was downloading this, and it had a tojan attached to the keyjen. Luckily my scanner picked it up first and deleted it. I'm reporting this torrent."
,iknouluvmi,2011-08-06T02:13Z,"I got rid of the virus, but it still won't patch. The patch is for another version."
,LukeScooto,2011-09-06T05:07Z,"@iknouvlumi Im not trying to insult you, but for someone who has never uploaded a single thing before, you should read and learn about cracks/keygens, etc before you claim that a Trusted member is uploading virus's and trojans. Honestly, if you report this and continue to claim that theres a trojan, theres a good chance that you yourself will get banned or suspended. Please read the info part of this uplaod towards the bottom, and it will clearly tell you that some Anti-virus progams will sometimes mistakenly detect a keygen or crack as a trojan or virus, because they're an exe that is made and not originally part of the program. Dont worry, its very common, its not a trojan, and its common for newer users and torrernters like yourself to mistakenly think he was giving you a trojan. The reason that your program isnt working, is because you had your anti-virus guard on, and it mistakenly took the crack/keygen, and put it in quarentine. What you need to do, is first turn off the Guard part of your anti-virus, then go into your quarantine, and hit Restore, so it goes back to where its suppose to. Then run the keygen and follow the directions. Trust everyone else if you dont trust Anacondaz, if theres was a trojan in this program, there would be hundreds of comments saying so. As you can see, your the only one... Use your noodle my friend, your mistaken."
,fro0tlo0p,2011-09-06T09:27Z,"OK, I must be doing something wrong and no instructions came with the download. I used the patch, then I tried to use the keygen but it is asking for information I don't know where to find. Please help and thank you in advance."
,fro0tlo0p,2011-09-06T09:45Z,"I re-downloaded and Read Me file in foreign language. Need in English, please."
,hyjinx313,2011-09-09T05:45Z,"Ok so the Read me file was a bunch of gibberish so i took the time and figured a work around for this. 

First off your going to want to put the patch and key-gen into the same folder as the Exe of webcam-max  and then take your self offline from the internet.   next run the patch  then open webcam-max and click the SN at the bottom. now open the Key-gen for the Code type MSN  then copy the line just below that.  paste it in the SN on webcam-max it will give you an error click manual,  then copy the code it gives you above the ""Unlock"" key that is currently blank.     paste that code  back where u typed MSN then click Generate once more.  take the Unlock code and paste it to the Unlock section on webcam-max application then click OK.   also while offline click settings and UN-check the box for updates automatically, in the webcam max settings. 

Hope this helps!"
