A collection of *what I think are* the best podcast/interviews from The Great Seducer. The interviews were by Bobby Rio who is one of the founders of TSB Mag. TSB's goals are:

TSB connects the modern man with the lifestyle choices available to him. Todayâ€™s man enjoys the unique opportunity to dictate the terms of his own success in every aspect of his lifeâ€”from his career choice to his sex life. Anyone with a broadband Internet connection has unlimited, unrestrained access to information that was once the exclusive domain of the intellectual and financial elite. TSB acknowledges the vast, life-altering potential that harvesting this information can effectâ€”as such, TSB stands on an unshakable foundation of truth.

Anyway, the interviews are pretty solid and a bunch of them are with legit Dating Coaches (Adam Lyons, Cajun, Carlos Xuma, Thundercat, Mr. M) . I'm sorry I couldn't include more descriptions with the actual .mp3 files, but you can reference The Great Seducer to find more specifics. If you're interested in this kind of stuff though, you'll want to listen to ALL of it.
