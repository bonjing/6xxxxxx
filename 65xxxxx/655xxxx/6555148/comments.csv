,sarsapil,2011-07-21T18:08Z,"BULLSHIT !! Written by a queer, no doubt to justify himself... THE FACTS are that in many early societies homosexuality was condemned or rejected as an abnormal behaviour, which the author conveniently hides, for instance ancient Egypt  (in the Book of the Dead having sex with other men is denied as a sin) and among the Hebrews, just read the Bible... Queers are pushing things too hard and I ear with their silly gay ""pride"" events (why not ""lame pride"" or ""blind pride"" ones?) are inviting losing the rights they have earned. Discretion, prudence, not provoking the majority that detests seeing gay couples kissing, wise policy for a small minority. "

,maddogx,2011-08-18T09:30Z,fuckin gay propaganda for weird gayboys.  Those fuckin gays and lesbos should be locked together in a huge prison compound and then they might just improve themselves and become normal like everybody else.
