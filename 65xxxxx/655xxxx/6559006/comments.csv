I will seed and seed and seed; but I'll never be able to get the whole shebang.  I'm asking friends to pick the books they'd like; that'll add to the total I can UL/seed.

First there was The Pentagon Papers, then Wikileaks, then  CaptnKidd."

,UncleO,2011-07-25T08:08Z,"What I don't get is that TPB says there are at least two dozen seeders on some files of yours but uTorrent says ZERO for the most part, and that's the speed I get even when one or two seeders show up,

On the other hand - on my 150 max/rare DL speed total - I'm getting around 70 and 50 on two DLs."
,UncleO,2011-07-25T08:21Z,"Hmm. I just noticed that the 2 moving along so well (TZ) use https technology, and you have udp. Per a TZ tutorial I do not have DHT or Local peer enabled.  That a problem somehow? TZ certainly doesn't need them."

,phoneitin,2012-01-03T02:31Z,Great set of Torrents.  Just started the last one.  Still seeding all of them.
