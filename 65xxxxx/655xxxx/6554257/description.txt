Stop a scoundrel from altering history in Time Machine - Rogue Pilot, a time-traveling chase with a fun new match twist.

Ilona and her father, a professor who built a time machine, are sitting around when a thief breaks in and powers up unit. He is gone in a flash, set to travel back in time and change the world, but Ilona has other plans for him. She jumps into a second unit to stop him, and now the race is on. Can she stop the villain or will she be too late?

Jump into the chase and help Ilona stop the rogue across different epochs. Shoot to make matches of three or more like objects in 48 fast-paced levels. Use fantastic power-ups to fire away and boost the mood meter for extra points. In between levels, you can also search for scene anomalies in fun Hidden Object searches. With six extra modes, like Puzzle and Time Rush, a surprise ending, and a chance to replay the game through the eyes of the rogue, this is one adventure you can't miss.
