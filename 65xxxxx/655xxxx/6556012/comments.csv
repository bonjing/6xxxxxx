,TheNethos,2011-11-02T15:04Z,"@vivatpb5776:

There is a Windows Update (KB971033) that undoes this type of activator. Before running Windows update, look for this particular entry in the list, right-click it, and hit ""Hide update"". You should now be able to update fine without losing your activation."
