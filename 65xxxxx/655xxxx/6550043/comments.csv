,LazarusL,2011-08-04T08:44Z,"EZTV has not uploaded a new episode of this show for 3 weeks now. Posting S04E01 4 days late was uncharacteristically poor performance for them...but 3 consecutive weeks of total failure is a disgrace. Does anyone know why EZTV has stopped carrying this popular program? Or why they evade polite questions about it on their own site, deflecting them with gratuitous insults instead? How unprofessional. Way to burn a good rep, guys."
