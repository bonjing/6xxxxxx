,aajkd,2011-08-09T16:43Z,Yes
,akvik,2011-08-14T00:46Z,Thanks!
,unuser,2011-08-22T18:22Z,"Nice. Thanks!

Only one season, though (season 3, 18 episodes).

Not ""season 1-7"" as stated. 

We can hope for more uploads(?)..."
,aajkd,2011-08-23T13:58Z,"You are wrong. It is season 1- 7.

,unuser,2011-09-09T04:43Z,"You are correct. I presumed that there were more than 2 or 4 episodes per season. In US television there are typically 12 episodes per season (give or take a few).

Italians believe in quality, not quantity?!"

,goupe,2012-04-05T16:55Z,"I reorganized the contents of this torrent, since the original torrent had 18 folders with only cryptic one word titles, then some files within the folders didn't have episode numbers. So I removed all the folders and looked up episode numbers (according to IMDB, 2 were mislabeled in the original torrent).

Still, w/o the original upload above by anonymous, none of this would have been possible- and it looks like a good series.

new torrent at http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7162038"
,floder,2012-05-30T02:16Z,"This is good work, especially as the recent upload by Anon [M Es1-10] appears to be already dead! Contrary to what is said here this torrent appears to contain 18 Episodes [from the 22 made to date]. All are good quality with fairly quick down. This is a treasure and the scripts, photography and music are all a delight!!"
