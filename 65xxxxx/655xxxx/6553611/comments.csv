,triggerjerk,2011-07-22T03:43Z,"     OK, I'll thank you, mrdavers, from the bottom of my new ebook reader's electronic heart. 

     I love the HBO series and will enjoy reading thee ""real thing"", as opposed the the TV adaptation."
,CuddlyAardvark,2011-07-23T15:14Z,"Alright, this was my first time torrenting an E-Book. I almost gave you a bad review due to my to own stupidity. Once I figured out how to open them it was perfect. I have always wanted to read these books but never got around to it. Also, thanks for including the original covers. Nothing irritates more then covers that are pictures from the later movie or Tv Show. 

Awesome upload. Hands down 5 Star torrent."

Thank you!"
