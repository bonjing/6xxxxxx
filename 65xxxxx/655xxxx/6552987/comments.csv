,TyMod,2011-07-20T19:22Z,Sorry about the speed.  My internet has been screwed up lately.  SO PLEASE SEED WHEN IT FINALLY FINISHES!!!
,TyMod,2011-07-21T15:10Z,"The keygen may come up as a virus, if you don't trust it don't use it. You will have to fine your own key."
,TyMod,2011-07-21T21:02Z,"I will only seed another day.  For those who finished downloading...

SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED

So far no one will seed the game.

Dirty bastards."
,lembird94,2011-12-06T04:28Z,hey TyMod. I have a request to make of you. I have searched every torrent website around and i cannot find a torrent for Fable 2 for pc. Do you suppose you could maybe make one? 
,TyMod,2011-12-06T21:58Z,"Fable 2 was not released on PC :(  Only the first and third one.  Sorry mate.   You will have to buy it for the Xbox 360 and if you don't have a Xbox 360 then you will have to buy that too. lol

It wasn't all that great though man so you arn't missing anything."
,takashi8525,2011-12-29T20:37Z,"hey man,if this works well enough to play on my pc thani'll seed this one too"
,aodtonix,2012-04-23T15:48Z,"Damn dude, I love you. Been finding this for years. Thnks so much dude :D"
,aodtonix,2012-04-24T20:43Z,"really needs seed dude. my speed's so slow, roughly 1kb per second. damn :|"
,TyMod,2012-05-01T00:18Z,Sorry about the speeds. Im not going to reseed it simply since I seeded it a long time over the summer.
