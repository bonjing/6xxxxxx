This is the F.E.A.R Directors Cut Iso.

What I ripped to get it so small:  Just the Directors Cut videos meaning the videos that show how the game was made, a Rooster Teeth Machinima, the F.E.A.R Prequel, and a Directors Commentary.

What about the game?  The game is complete and full.  It is the UK version so if you want to update it to the most resent version (1.8), make sure you download the UK patch and not the US version.

Comment, Rate, Seed (Share), and give Request.  I\'m going to try and keep a steady flow of things coming.  I do more then just games, don\'t forget that...
