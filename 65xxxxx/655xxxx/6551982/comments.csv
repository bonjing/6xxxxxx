Don't listent to evryone, the end is the best part! Most action. Everyone just hating because it isn't your typical nicely Hollywood packaged film.  It seems that average cinema viewers aren't prepared to see the hero die at the end without reprieve. No, it isn't an accurate portrayal, but which movie is today? It's not meant to be accurate, but rather exaggerate current themes. Yes the whole terrorist thing is played out, but the acting makes you actually care about the characters, no matter how contrived the plot.  Definitely worth a watch."

nice suspense

but then it hit's you that he can't win a war fought and inflamed for profit and power unless the Guns-Oil-Drugs money making complex is destroyed first - there always will be another demoralized kid soldier to shoot you in the back"
