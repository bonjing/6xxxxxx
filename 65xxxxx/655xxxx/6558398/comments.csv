I have used it on VMware Workstation for PC, so I would of imagined that it will work on Mac version."
,Awaqward,2011-07-23T17:01Z,"Well, i downloaded this, i managed to run the setup, but it does NOT give me the option to install Windows XP? I'm currently running Windows 7 as it came pre-installed on my PC."
,anythingless,2011-07-23T19:53Z,"bro u say FRESH, CLEAN AND UNTOUCHED

really gr8 but did u do it ur self or did u get it from another source cause theres lot of xp of different sizes all claim to be UNTOUCHED some are 622mb if u know 
So Did u do it ur self 

Thanks"
,Calum44,2011-07-23T20:57Z,"@anythingless

Hi, yeah it was originaly ripped from a company CD, a friend gave it to me, also supplied with the VLK serial that they use.

The only reason this has gone upto 622 is because I slipstreamed SP3 into it, rather than upload it with SP2."
,Calum44,2011-07-23T20:58Z,"@Awaqward

Hi there, How far do you get in the installation? If you could give me some sort of clue then I may be able to help you bro."
,Awaqward,2011-07-24T18:50Z,"I start it up after mounting it with DAEMON Tools, and there is a ""Install Windows XP"" button, but it's kind of shaded. And it has no effect when i click it."
,Calum44,2011-07-24T21:22Z,"@Awaqward

Are you trying to install this when its mounted on Deamon tools?
If so, you should not do that and burn it with an ISO burner, then put the cd in the drive and boot from it."
,Calum44,2011-07-24T21:24Z,"Also it may be that you are trying to do an UPGRADE, say you have Vista or 7.
You can only upgrade if you have windows 200 or lower. either way you are best of installing via booting."
,Awaqward,2011-07-25T02:28Z,I'm trying to add Windows XP to my computer which only have Windows 7. :/ 
,Calum44,2011-07-25T17:32Z,"IN that case then you will have to do a dual boot, with 2 operating systems, I'm afraid I cannot help you with this since I only have rather basic knowledge and don't know how to get 2 operating systems on one PC."
,dee_mer80,2011-07-26T04:05Z,"awaqward,..2 OS is a bit complex..to simply do it you must first install XP by booting from CD,you have to back your data from current window...after XP is installed its easy to install window 7 on another partition.even from mounted on daemon...I tried it so I hope it can help you..goodkuck"
,DignityPT,2011-07-26T18:55Z,"I got a question here..

,etherealflame,2011-07-29T01:32Z,"Downloaded this. Went to install, but it's asking for the key. E-mailed you a little while ago, so I'm waiting for your response."
,Calum44,2011-07-29T15:43Z,"I have received and replied to all e-mails regarging the serial.

This has only been updated with SP3, though it will update fine after install.

It appears that the key did not slipstream, for that I do apologize, and will reply to all emails."
