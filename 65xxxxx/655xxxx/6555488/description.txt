This is a Blu-Ray disc rip. Trent Raznor and Atticus Ross released \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Social Network\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" soundtrack in diferent formats last year, including a version in 5.1 surround sound (loseless PCM).

It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the first that I heard of a audio only disc being released in Blu-Ray, but, if you think about it it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s the only way we should listen to Nine Inch Nails. The most impressive album of 2010, IMO.

Here you guys can read a message from the duo: http://www.nullco.com/TSN/
