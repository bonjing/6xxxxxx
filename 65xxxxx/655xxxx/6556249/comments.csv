,CaptnKidd,2011-07-22T04:26Z,"When I can edit the torrent description I will (the list is rather long of what books are in this) but for now I would like to thank the user bitchtorrent for this massive library of reference and informational material.  I began downloading as many of their books as I can in order to preserve the collection they made and tediously edited each and every book for the past 4 years. 

Not every one of them is labeled and there are many more I have yet to catalog but I'd say over 3K are cataloged completely by me using the Calibre e-library management software.

If you can help with this endeavor then I ask that you cut this up smaller for those who do not have the powerful connections that some of us have.

If you can seed, please do for as long as you can.

If you wish to give some other way, throw your money to this developer: http://calibre-ebook.com/donate

He has helped more than words can describe.

Thanks.

,RS232C,2011-07-22T06:09Z,"dude....do you realize how tedious it is perhaps to have all the books in one file which means you have to literally download the whole thing and all of them, just to possibly get 'some' you may want? each should be separate in a torrent such as this. at least thats what I think...others do think otherwise. and to have no list is just insane. I frankly think we should have 26 separate torrents perhaps one for each letter of the alphabet, which will keep them manageable maybe. kudo's for the support to the scene though of course. "
,CaptnKidd,2011-07-22T06:53Z,"Understood.

This was done to just get it out there for a few of the people that are gonna help break it up.

I understand that and promise to break it up by subject.

This is more of a ""booster pack"" for book nerds like myself that wanna do what I did.

For example, a few friends going back to SOuth Africa wanted it to then print them out and bind them in cheap binders to have something of a mini library for the people over there.  

It's mainly for people like that thus the rush and the huge torrent.

Saw the guy that uploaded the entire JSTOR Royal Society collection and said ""fuck it"" so now.....this.

Promise i'll break up the collection but for now here's a big file for the strong willed/bandwidthed :-/ "
,CaptnKidd,2011-07-22T06:55Z,"Alphabetical might be best though.

I found it was easier to keep track of what I uploaded/categorized already either by subject or publisher, but now i'm thinking alphabetical.

Thanks for the CONSTRUCTIVE criticism though, gets the brain juices flowin' :-)"

Done."

Your welcome and thanks, just keep seeding ;-)"
,CaptnKidd,2011-07-24T04:17Z,"@Rixslife

Thanks, you happen to upload those books perchance?  You see, i'm somewhat as a collector.....as you may have noticed :-)"
[V],illunatic,2011-07-24T08:19Z,"Well done on this one captnkidd!
This archive is a great torrent which speaks 'volumes' of the value of bittorrent.

,Rixslife,2011-07-25T03:19Z,"CaptnKidd: I am having bandwidth issues, should be getting increase this week. I will certainly be putting it all up as soon as I get the increase. All my collection is ePub, except some sci-fi that I haven't converted yet (which is PDF)"
,majtophat,2011-08-04T17:48Z,"W00t! Thanks CaptnKidd! I have been looking for something like this for ages! 

Seeing as there are no seeders I am going to download the parts and then seed this behemoth until kingdom come (so basically forever since I am pretty sure that that will never happen)!"
,majtophat,2011-08-04T17:49Z,"woops, forgot to add:

Rixlife: Any news on that upload of books? I am a collector as well and would love to add your 27k to my collection."
