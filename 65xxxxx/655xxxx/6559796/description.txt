The series premiered on HBO on June 5, 2005 and aired for a single season.

The show, a comedy, was shot by a two-camera crew, in the style of reality television. Viewers of The Comeback are actually watching raw footage shot for the fictional reality show within The Comeback, also called The Comeback.

The series' episode titles (excluding the pilot) begin with the main character's first name Valerie... followed the theme of the episode as the main character would have named them, e.g. Valerie Triumphs at the Upfronts.

Despite a coveted time slot after the hit series Entourage, The Comeback debuted to low ratings and a mixed critical response; despite this, it was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards including Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for Kudrow. HBO confirmed on September 21, 2005 that the series was officially canceled after only being on the air for thirteen weeks.
