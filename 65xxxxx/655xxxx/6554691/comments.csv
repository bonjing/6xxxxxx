I just wanted to say that more people need to hear this guy make a guitar sound like a jazz banjo. Most people think of a banjo and they expect to hear old time Earl Scruggs, The Beverly Hillbillys etc... Nope, sorry gang, the Banjo is capable of making almost any sound a guitar can, even heavy metal banjo has been recorded by more than a few players, with most players giving credit to a cat named ""Jammer"" for being first at modifying a bluegrass banjo to produce such a sound. - Bela needs more exposure by the people who believe banjos all sound the same, they don't."
