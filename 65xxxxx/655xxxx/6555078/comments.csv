,detong,2011-07-22T01:19Z,"hey thank you very much for this, what is the difference between 'mixed' & 'unmixed'?"
[T],-inspiron-,2011-07-22T02:06Z,"welcome all, the difference that mixed by paul and the unmixed is just the original tracks used each one not connected, i just split the continuous mix into tracks :)"

,Mika850,2011-07-22T16:28Z,"Hi! First I want to thank you for this incredible upload! This is my music!
I just wonder about track 1 of CD2 on the unmixed part. It contains 75mins and is as big as a complete CD (~180MB). What is it? It can't be what it's named ""01 Ovnimoon - Galactic Mantra (Liquid Soul Remix)"", right? On the Mixed part this track is just 2:10 and sounds quite different."
[T],-inspiron-,2011-07-22T17:35Z,"lol, actually mate, this is put by mistake, this is the continuous mixed cd 2 :D sorry about that :) really confusing it was to split them, because the tracklist i found is just for the unmixed but they are different queued in the mix so i had to rename and renumber the tracks :) sorry, i think the mixed is much better, cheers"
