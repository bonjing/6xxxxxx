UNKUTT aka Unkutta aka Kuttastic. The Kansas City, MO-born and bred rapper, producer and engineer has been bubbling in the Phoenix scene since moving here and getting serious about music.  My lifestyle before my music was just a straight hustler period. People consider hustlin  like on the block, sellin  crack. Huslin  is hustlin  period.  Unkutt has found his true passion in music, and takes his craft serious enough that he eschews the spotlight in favor of creating unique, classic music. For example he shares the mic with fellow Team GoMode MCs Fresco and former Fresh Music Feature N.A.  I want to go down as the Scottie Pippen of music,  he says before adding with a laugh,  by the way, I m unsigned, looking for employment from any label.

Until he gets that deal, Unkutt is going to stay true to the hustler s spirit that didn t leave when he started doing music. As promoter Ace Black says,  Unkutta has always been a go getter. From when I first met him in  05 sellin  his mixtapes to when I helped with his promo with his album. He was never afraid to push for himself, and he ll always have that.
