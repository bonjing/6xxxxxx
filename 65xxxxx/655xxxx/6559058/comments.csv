,vcannibal,2011-07-23T07:15Z,I cannot appear to read this file in VLC.
,mrsjab,2011-07-23T09:17Z,"Thank you so much!  I'm such a big fan of this show, and this is the only way I could watch it before the DVDs come out!  I really appreciate your sharing it."
,HideousX,2011-07-23T13:44Z,well never watching this show again that was some fucked up shit
,ezemeat,2011-07-23T16:16Z,Lol me wonders who/what Capt Jack shagged this week in that case
,kercluck,2011-07-23T17:34Z,"Err, this is not AVI. Incorrectly labeled .rar that finally unpacks to a mk4.

Jesus, why can't some people label files fucking properly?"
,chumzy,2011-07-23T22:47Z,@HideousX was it the gay sex?
,chumzy,2011-07-23T22:48Z,"Also, it was a .avi for me?  "
,HideousX,2011-07-24T01:40Z,@chumzy YES IT WAS i dont mind the fact that the cunt is gay but i dont need FAG SEX SCEENS in my Sci Fi shows 
,mizkitty,2011-07-24T03:41Z,"@HideousX I'm sure that RTD will be so upset to have lost your viewership. I don't mind the fact that you're an ignorant little wanker, but I don't need homophobic arseholes in my sci-fi fandom. Why the fuck are you watching Torchwood to being with if you're such a bigot? "
,Occam1,2011-07-24T12:15Z,"@ mizkitty - yeah, too fuckin' right!"
,biffbaffler,2011-07-24T23:25Z,"Agree with ""HideousX"" -  we don't need turd burglars in mainstream TV ""entertainment"". Homophobia is a misued term - a phobia is a fear of something & I'm certainly not fearfull of turd burglars!!"
,doodlelover,2011-07-25T03:20Z,"Thank you for the torrent! :D LOL at the anti-homosexual talk.

Some guys like other guys, and sometimes people make shows about it, get over it."
,mr_foofer,2011-07-25T16:09Z,"Well, the main character is a turd burglar because the shows creator is a turd burglar and feels the need to shove it in everyone's face.

Strange how sci-fi fans make a big stink about any kind of sexuality or romance between characters (warehouse 13, eureka, etc), but let this homo shit slide on this show.  Makes you think that sci-fi fans watch their shows in the closet.

Coming up in episode 4:
Captain Jack has a sword fight with the Anal Assassin."
,HideousX,2011-07-26T04:07Z,"Spot on biffbaffler 

@mizkitty I think u miss understand me im not homophobic im just not a fan of FAG sex and im willing to bet 99% of male Sci Fi viewrs would agree go watch queer as folk if thats your thing
and as for tourchwood missing my viewership im willing to bet im not alone many others that kind of liked the show like myself will stop watching i didn't even watch the rest of the Ep so to conclude my rant

,marvelpunk,2011-07-26T04:34Z,"To all the ignorant, complaining bigots, we'll see just how much of an impact your decision of refusing to watch future episodes of Torchwood will have on the series. Trust me, your intolerance will have no effect at all. The show will proceed to go on. 

So...y'know, shove that middle up your @ss =D "
,chronosifter,2011-07-26T11:44Z,"I was afraid this would happen when Starz took on Torchwood. Leave it to us Americans to inject sex into everything, especially if it generates controversy. Bad enough that the show was already borderline soap opera. When will they learn the difference between character development and unnecessary drama and gratuitous sex scenes."
,Cybrson,2011-07-27T03:57Z,"To all of you dumbasses who are hating on the show:

FUCK YOU, you ignorant homophobes! Torchwood was first aired on BBC, in other words, its British. When it was brought to American Television, Starz knew what they were getting into. So fuckin' what if a major character in the show Bisexual. If you really cared for Science Fiction you would over-look you hatred for something you obviously don't understand. And yes, the suffix -phobia means fear, you're all obviously afraid of seeing gay sex which means... Yes I'm afraid you are in fact, homophobes.
For example, Captain Jack is a bisexual who has a daughter and had a grandson. Gwen Cooper fucked a female alien in the British series. All the main characters got some, which makes sense. In a high stress job like that you gotta find a better way to relieve it right?
And one last thing, the show will go on. If there are people out there who love the show like I do, there is no doubt in my mind that show will continue.

P.S. The actress who plays as Gwen Cooper was in the British version of Playboy ;) THAT my friends is how famous the show was in Britain."

,stevieb,2011-07-31T17:32Z,thanx :D
,snilloc,2011-08-03T14:38Z,"Thank you very nice copy


A = 9

V = 9"
,PetterP,2011-08-04T22:01Z,"I don't like watching men have sex. That doesn't mean I'm a homophobia. It means I'm hetrosexual... Anyway, the scene really didn't bug me. What bugged me was that it was totally unnecessary, and only included because sex sells. Story goes on as usual - main character goes ""oops, I need my sex"" - story continues. I can't say I'm a big fan of the new series, a totally different show than Children of Earth. But thehell, it's good entertainment..."
,exgeek,2011-09-01T09:30Z,u rock!
