,knox666,2011-07-20T16:15Z,Hope this is real..I will confirm after download and virus scan if it is for the rest of the peeps and if it is good I will seed to the internet is a dinosaur technology. :)
,Jhowardtorrents,2011-07-20T16:52Z,Obviously this is going to take a while to download.. But if it works alright for me then i'll seed :) 
,Anon1850,2011-07-20T17:57Z,"How do you unpack it? There are .rar files, but I seem so be having problems unpacking them, because there is no ""compiled"" file to unpack once you click on one of the .rar files... "
,Anon1850,2011-07-20T18:13Z,"Ok, again (since I can't see my last comment): how do you unpack this? The file is in .rar files, but when you click on them to unpack the .bin file, well the .rar files are empty. Anyone else have this problem? Thx"
,pir8pat,2011-07-20T18:32Z,k tried to download twice. Getting a corrupt error when unzipping. Tried to use hjsplit to join the files and was able to get a bin file compiled. daemon wont read it but power iso will. So got the image up in power iso but it will not install. Me thinks the uploader may need to redo the torrent unless someone can figure out a fix. Otherwise the file looks real just broke atm.
,wamenslot,2011-07-20T21:00Z,I extracted fine with Winrar. Will test it later.
,smithyt1,2011-07-20T21:05Z,unless im being a idiot i cant get the files to extract. any help?
,Apaleytos,2011-07-20T21:26Z,"Working 100%,thnx for the game:))))
Unzip->Mount->install"
,knox666,2011-07-21T00:10Z,Thank you ErikZown I only doubted because no SKULL :) And I'm gonna keep on a seeding homies :)
,Koude,2011-07-21T01:16Z,"This has been a bit botched. Every other split-archive thing I've seen has included a .rar aswell as all the numbered files, but it isn't included here. I've tried extracting from .001 even renaming it .rar but it just fails each time."
,chris228808,2011-07-21T04:54Z,"works fine. i used 7 zip to extract, mounted image with daemon tools, installed. thanks"
,Monrroy90,2011-07-21T06:44Z,"downloaded and installed ok, but when I try to load a saved game it crashes to desktop.. anyone else with the same problem?"
,Slayerzark,2011-07-21T07:44Z,"@Monrroy90

I have the same problem. It looks that many people have this problem and the developers wrote in their forum that they are working on the problem."
,Monrroy90,2011-07-21T09:00Z,"@Slayerzark

ok mate, the last paradox games were pretty bugged, I guess this is not the exception.. hope they solve it soon.

we can't do nothing but wait for a fix :("
,Gurc,2011-07-21T13:35Z,"Crashed with me too :( 
But not many people have the same problem. Problem could be about the release that we download."
,Gurc,2011-07-21T14:23Z,"Ok, update0 released. It solved my loading game issue.

,ZvAgO,2011-07-21T18:12Z,"to join the files use http://www.hjsplit.org
click on the join button of this program and the joined file will apear in the same directory. Easy 
:)"
,Gurc,2011-07-21T19:44Z,"Just use 7-zip, a free and safe program to unzip.
Install after mounting with Daemon Tools(no-crack needs to be done)
Apply Update0.
Play."
,Wolfcry,2011-07-23T02:53Z,"I'm not new to installing, mounting, cracking... etc etc when it comes to games. But I seriously can't figure this one out?.

I can't extract the files, I can't mount it, I can't open it.

Nothing seems to work.

So could anyone be nice and explain how to do it, step-by-step?, I'm sure there are more people than me that would appreciate it.

Thanks."
,Monrroy90,2011-07-23T05:50Z,"@Wolfcry 

Here what I did:

1-Open winrar (I mean the program, not opening the downloaded files with it)

2-Got to ""Open file"" (I guess in english it says that, I'm chilean so I read ""Abrir Archivo"" here)

3-Find the folder where you've downloaded the game and select the first part, the one with 001.

4-There it should show what it's inside the entire package, it's a .cue and a .bin file.

5-Extract them as you know.

6-Another option is to rename each file with a ""part1.rar"", ""part2.rar"" and so on.. 

Remember tu update the game so you don't have troubles to save and load your progress.. 

good luck"
,HypRoN,2011-07-28T19:01Z,"Just to let everyone know, this release and all release have been nuked by the devs, those devious bastards >:)

You can save your game, you can load your game(post update), BUT, you won't be able to unpause your game after you load it! One of the best DRM strats I've seen since Fade.

There is a work though! (Everything else in this game is partially broken, why not this too :\)

To work around it, just save you game 5 or 6 times to different names, the first few you wont be able to unpause, but the others you will. Don't worry if you forget or already have a ""locked"" save game as this trick even works on those.

Happy Conquering, for Mother Russia!

Also, if anyone has used nukes in this game, what are the consequences of doing so?"
,goopd,2011-07-30T06:28Z,all u need to extract everything with out any extra steps is the program Universal extracter u just pick where to extract and it auto extracts it all with out any complications
,a1s,2011-07-31T05:44Z,Wait... can I play this game without patching? or is it broken out-of-the-box and I need to update for it to be playable/enjoyable? (i.e. Why all the fuss?)
,taurusz8,2011-08-12T18:36Z,when i load the game i can't unpause. the method that  HypRoN explained is not  work for me. Is there any other solution  to overcome it?
,Arkit123,2011-08-13T11:01Z,"@taurusz8
The thing that worked for me was going into the Registry Editor and deleting the value for the CD-key, then manually re-entering it when starting the game. Unfortunately, it only works once for every time you do it, so if you muck up and load after having already loaded, it'll be frozen ;D"
,steveas77,2011-08-21T00:50Z,"people who cant load save games CTD fully update to 7.1.1?
People who cant Unpause saved games do the following  goto the directory of save games usually this is  C:\Users\USERNAME_HERE\Documents\My Games\Supreme Ruler Cold War\Savegame
and at begining of each save game type

AutoSave-

so u have a save game file renamed to AutoSave-mysavegame.SAV

***NOTE***  USERNAME_HERE is usually the login name you start up ya comp with so replace it with that or just use win explorer to find the save games
the above has worked for me and i HOPE it works for you 
REMEMBER if this game is good for you then BUY IT!!!!    "
,tactical_idiot69,2011-08-21T12:24Z,"@stevas 77 

This didn't work, did exactly as you said. I have 7.1.1 (latest update) and nothing will take the bloody unpause off. 

What this needs is a proper crack, or a proper universal work-around.

Can anyone post a link to a solution, crack, or alternative work-around. "
,tactical_idiot69,2011-08-21T12:35Z,"I add that this needs a proper releaser such as SKIDROW, who actually releases something that actually works..."
,GoodTunes,2011-08-24T00:01Z,"If this gets a proper scene release, I will shit my pants. :)

Not gonna happen. It's not a good game, but it's the best in it's genre. Can't compete worth shit vs. the amazing Hearts of Iron series, though."
,juzz76,2011-08-27T11:35Z,love pirate bay so much can find any games I want ;)
,holyball,2011-08-31T21:48Z,Who Has The Problem With Loading Game Try This: 1.Load Your Saved Game .2Quit 3. Load Again And The First Thing You Do Is Unpause The Game. Hope This Works For You!
,taurusz8,2011-09-03T09:58Z,"I have managed to unlock my save files.
After re-installation of supreme ruler i was able to load previously locked save games. After that i didn't quit the game fearing of lock save games. But game tends to crash and that left me with useless auto-save files that wouldn't open at all, game crashes immediately after selecting them. So I installed patch 7.0.71 and loaded the game, now the save game is loading but I can not unpause. So I have saved the game as is and rein-stale supreme ruler. After the instaation i was able to open the save file and unpause the game. Hope this will help somebody"
,thaghost1,2011-09-29T01:20Z,"@ HempTeam and anyone else who is curious to know what the problem is.

Basically, You can't load a save file because it crashes the game everytime. There is a patch to fix it but it also installs some sort of anti piracy crap that doesn't allow torrented/pirated versions of the game unpause, So pretty much we're screwed till a fix comes out, Or you can leave your PC on for days straight with the game running like i do."
,Apaleytos,2011-12-22T18:52Z,"Version 7.2.1 &  7.2.2

 protection doesnt work in scenarios 

Scenario->cold war=SKIRMISH

Enjoy:)"
,Apaleytos,2011-12-22T19:38Z,"Starting a scenario as Greece(works for me) removes the games protection.

start a scenario as Greece,unpause then quit.
Play the mod(campain etc) and country of urchoise.Savegames seems to work also:)"
,SRazvan,2011-12-27T18:29Z,"it works. still has the protection but you can remove it!!!
here's how:
1) install ANY clean copy of SR:Cold War
2) apply patch 7.1.1 - download it, just google ""Supreme Ruler: Cold War v7.1.1""
3) after installing patch start a new game. save it and exit the game. when you want to play again it will be paused and stuck. but here's how you work around it. start a NEW campaign (don't save, doesn't matter the country or settings). unpause the game, then go in to the menu and load your previous save. unpause it. it works for me. i plan to buy it at my nex pay check. i really like the game and i suggest that if you really like it you buy it!"
,SRazvan,2011-12-27T18:35Z,"sorry for the double post but i just checked and the method to unpause also works with patch ""7.2.2"""
,thaghost1,2012-04-27T14:02Z,"Holy shit, That work-a-round actually works! I can't thank you guys enough for that fix, I almost bought the game because of it numerous times."
