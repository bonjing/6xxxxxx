You can find alot of them on here or use google.
I got myself Survivor Series 97 a month or so ago, pretty sure from here.

wazz000 on TPB has some torrents that have all the raw eps from 96,97,98,99 aswell as the ppv's from them years included.

How far back were you wanting?"
,dadevil666,2011-07-21T23:21Z,@Online.Pirate tryin to get from the start of it all even were it was wwwf b4 it turned into wwf then went to wwe etc 
,Online.Pirate,2011-07-23T06:18Z,"@dadevil666
It became WWE in 2002, so the previously mentioned TPB users torrents would be PPV from the WWF days. As for other years I'm yet to come across some myself."
,dadevil666,2011-07-23T18:22Z,@Online.Pirate understand that but before it even cam wwe it was was wwwf before it even came wwf back in the days look it up from at 1963 and u'll it
