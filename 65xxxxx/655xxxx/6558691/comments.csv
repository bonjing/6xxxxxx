,Legend.Cyrus,2011-07-25T02:12Z,Heya.. What do I do if when I click on the files which then brings up the launcher and it does nothing other than just bring up the launcher?
,Legend.Cyrus,2011-07-25T02:35Z,[Correction] Fuck yeah! I figured it out.The files CANNOT be in folders(which are folders inside of the Download folder under Sims 3) Problem solved!
,gabrielilla,2011-07-25T15:33Z,"Hello, I downloaded the torrent and did everything you said but the spell book doesn't work. When I click on it the options they are listed like in code way, for example (download/store/enchantment/ksnf839% *don't remember the exact words) and automatically the sim moves out of the way. Help please!"
,debugman18,2011-07-26T00:53Z,"@gab and @dja I have a working spellbook uploaded, just the july store content. Comfirmed working. And great job with the compilation g2tw."
,Teato0o,2011-07-27T18:06Z,It would have been better too keep the store updates separate instead of one zipped file to be honest. But good torrent :P
,Adryenne,2011-07-28T14:27Z,Thank you!!!
,SarahK_2009,2011-07-29T04:00Z,I seriously love you sfm. 
,Green-Banana,2011-07-30T02:19Z,"There are many reasons why an archive file is not the preferred method.  Anyways, the files seem to work fine.  The only exception is the Gothique Spellbook, which seems to be barring Sims from interacting with it.  If you know of the solution for this error, don't forget to share it with the group.  Thanks for the upload.  "
,Green-Banana,2011-07-30T02:38Z,"UPDATE.  The link the uploader advertises may have a package fix for the unsubstantial Book of Spells provided.  Rather than waiting to click around a lot of flashy text, I tracked down the thread for you:  http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t1555-lady-ravendancer-goth-s-book-o-spells-july-2011-store-update-move-character-when-use-fix

There should be a download link in the topic post we can use to fix the insufficient object.  If only the torrent description could be modified to include it...sorry to those who will have to scroll down to this post to find the solution.  "

,ninnybear,2011-08-10T20:57Z,I've been looking everywhere for both of the FutureShock sets. does this include them?
,FFrrppff,2011-08-15T21:14Z,"so many things, I think my pc will explode when I enter the game :S"
,pamellka,2011-08-19T15:26Z,Oh dear...could someone tell me where I have to put these? Is it in the downloads folder?
,call_me_nobody,2011-08-27T18:44Z,"Yes.

You put them in the downlaod folder.

But how come that this torrent takes only 2 gb when the other one i see has addons for 5gb?

Are this pack missing some stuff?"

,GI_Jhen,2011-11-02T20:57Z,"I put these store files into my downloads folder and they all work fine but now my sims are floating above their bathtubs and hot tubs??? I removed all my other mos 1 by 1 and its coming from one of these store files. Has anyone else had this problem or can anyone think of a solution?

,Casira,2012-03-10T12:21Z,"After a few hours of Installing and reinstaling this will not work for the steam version. I have followed the instructions to the letter, and they will not show up in the launcher with the latest patch if you have this through steam."
,Tsuyuki,2012-03-14T15:59Z,Is anyone still seeding this?
,MystiTsu,2012-04-04T06:19Z,"If these are sims 3 packs and I Suspect they are, are they already Decrapified.  "
