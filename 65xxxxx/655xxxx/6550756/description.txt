Left 4 Dead 2  Version 2.0.6.8  NoSteam

Pre-patched with rev-emu 

Play by running l4d2.exe
I strongly recommend changing your playername in rev.ini before playing.

Use only the server browser or the "connect" console command to play online. Do not use the other menus.


Known Issues: 
Splash screen may not display when in fullscreen mode, just wait until the game loads fully and it will display normally.

Use 7-zip to extract the archive.

Enjoy
