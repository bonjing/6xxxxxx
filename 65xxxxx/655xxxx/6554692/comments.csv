,XxM24Ty,2011-07-23T03:53Z,"We need seeders gang. I have done about all I can here, would somebody else please consider seeding these cartoons for a little while after you download the collection? Every bit helps.

Thanks."

,shmeghead,2011-08-20T06:00Z,"Hey, this seems like there are no complete seeds. I did however find I had SOME of the missing episodes (some of the ones that are remaining incomplete) so I've dragged them into my partial download so it should help a few of the episodes go to completion. These were the same files included in this stuck download so it seems to be passing the checksum. I hope this helps a little. If the original seeder doesn't re share this a couple will never finish."
,XxM24Ty,2011-08-22T09:16Z,"Thanks gang, but I am having tons of problems uploading torrents to this site. I am very sorry for wasting anybody's time, but the fact is I am having problems with almost all torrents I upload. Best to give up on this one, as others for now. I just can not figure why my torrents are not seeding, as other sites I have been to give me few problems."
