moman73 has collected more than (2600) evidence against the Bible and Christianity. almost all of which were written by Western (non-Muslimg) writers. Many of them were prominent scholars, historians, scientist, ..

Writing a 2-line hate-comments against Islam and the Qur'an is not much of an evidence.

Mrs. Green's book is a solid case against the Bible and Christianity. No where in that book you find a mentioning to the Qur'an or Islam.

If you are an Islam hater, it will be more usefull to start a similar project like moman73 did,

start collecting evidence against Islam, and share it with us."

who is this ali sina (the initials of his name in small letters the same way you wrote it) compared to the giants like: Isaac Newton, Gibbon, Charles Lea, Nitzche, Thomas Paine, Tolostoy, Ehrman, ......
who submitted their testimonies against Christianity?"

Some readers might be interested to track down a new book by the mainstream Christian theologian Miroslav Volf. The book is called Allah -- he argues fascinatingly that Christian faith is NOT incompatible with Islam. Needless to say, he is neither a Christian fundamentalist nor an atheist fundamentalist!"
