Criticism of the Bible - Collection 15 (Ethics & Morality):


One book of special interest in this collection is the one titled: " The Born Again Skeptic's Guide to the Bible", written by: Ruth Hurmence Green. The author was born and raised into a Methodist family. Late in her life she was hit with cancer. 
While recuperating from her illness, she started reading the Bible seriously.
Two years later, she wrote this book, and announced here conversion to atheism. The book contains several Chapters that discuss ethics and morality of the Bible and of Judaism and Christianity.

One tidbit about Mrs. Green: she used to believe that the great majority of the Christian community were Bible illiterates, and the best way to spread atheism was to make more people read the Bible!
