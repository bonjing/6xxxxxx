The whole idea of Dutch Treat was to give something back after I used the download-community to collect Music for my grand daughter (MP3 DB: The day before you came).

However after about 75 uploads its clear that less than 1 percent of you is willing to share (for a few hours). The first day I usually get about 30 to 40 seeds the next day its down to 4 or less.

Unexpected and very disappointing. I donâ€™t want to upload music (that took me quite a while to collect en select) to a bunch of selfish, greedy ghosts.

In exception of the Indie playlists (a new beginning that everyone should listen), I closed my outstanding torrents. This one will be my last.
