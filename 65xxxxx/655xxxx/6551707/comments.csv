,mma4me,2011-07-20T08:40Z,Thanks Nepotu. As always I'll seed as much and as long as my connection and cap allows.
[V],Nepotu,2011-07-20T11:53Z,"Thank you mma4me! You are the only one who understand why we are all here. Sometimes I think: worth it? I uploaded Moto GP and this, and with Moto GP I finished because I haven't seen one people only to seed. Then worth it? No, for sure. Also will see what I have to do with NBA Finals."
,mma4me,2011-07-20T13:52Z,"I know where you are coming from Nepotu. This is a P2P environment. IF NO ONE SHARES (SEEDS) THEN NOBODY GETS ANYTHING. 

Please people, SEED what you can, every little bit helps everyone. Think of it as returning a favour. "
