Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel became good friends after first meeting at elementary school in New York City, and grew into one of the most popular songwriting duos in the world. Though their friendship would be rocky over the intervening years, their partnership was artistically fruitful, yielding a clutch of classic albums and songs such as "Mrs. Robinson, Bridge Over Troubled Water and the Boxer".
