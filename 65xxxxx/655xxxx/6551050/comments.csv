Thank you ErikZown!!!"
,Bhiusx,2011-07-19T14:24Z,"In order to play OWB u need to install SKIDROW's Update 7 (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6532914/Fallout.New.Vegas.Update.7-SKIDROW), crack it and then copy OWB data files to your Fallout New Vegas data folder. Works flawless, thanks. ;)"
,SamuelTheDamned,2011-07-19T15:41Z,"Thanks for the up, works perfectly and downloaded in just 20 minutes.

After waiting 2 months for the release, I was frankly disappointed with the DLC (even though haven't played through yet). 

next up: Skyrim :)"

,hootieman,2011-07-19T17:16Z,Looking at the 360 now my buddy just bought this and the download is only 409.23MiB. How's this 728? this real?
,surgerygames,2011-07-20T08:39Z,"this works great. i'll seed for a bit. and before you post a comment about how it doesn't work, maybe you should read the fucking description.

,KidRapper,2011-07-20T08:48Z,Thanx bro. Downloading now.:)
,EvilAsh34,2011-07-20T08:55Z,"This absolutely works. It also doesn't need to be cracked as it's only the files for the dlc, it just needs to be copied into your NV Data directory. Just make sure you're updated to v1.4/Update 7 FIRST otherwise it *will not* work.

1. Update NV to v1.4 with update 7. Crack the game and then leave the crack alone.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6532914/Fallout.New.Vegas.Update.7-SKIDROW

2. Copy the files from this download (below) and paste/move them into your main New Vegas Data directory. 

Copy these:
OldWorldBlues - Main.bsa
OldWorldBlues - Sounds.bsa
OldWorldBlues.esm
OldWorldBlues.NAM

Paste Here: *C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Fallout New Vegas\Data\ 
*Or wherever your main data directory is.

That's it. It should run after that. If it doesn't than maybe you have a mod conflict. This is as simple as it gets."
,xxtoxicxx300,2011-07-20T08:59Z,This did not work for me i dont even get the radio signal.
,EvilAsh34,2011-07-20T09:12Z,I forgot to add that you need to activate the OldWorldBlues.esm in your game launcher otherwise it won't show up in-game.
,figyeldoda,2011-07-20T09:22Z,"Thanks for the upload. It is working just fine.

,PQuest,2011-07-21T04:00Z,"I'm having trouble. After installing BOTH the 1.4 update and OWB, I get the messages in-game that they've been loaded, yada yada yada, but now the screen fades to black every few seconds, freezing me in place and forcing me to holster my weapon, and the shouts of feral ghouls play when the screen is black. I can still start the DLC, but the fading and whatnot happens regardless, and it's just about the most annoying damn thing in the world. Can someone help?"
,OST_Oni,2011-07-21T05:24Z,"@PQuest
I was getting that with the other OWB torrent, for me it was a mod causing that to happen.  I disabled everything, and reordered my load order and it was fine, I just had to narrow it down to the one mod."
,heyman1981,2011-07-21T09:55Z,More boring DLC great
,stefanos_1,2011-07-21T16:30Z,I have the same problem as PQuest.. pls help
,ALEXCO12,2011-07-21T17:16Z,i dont see any satelite WTF? i have all DLCs and Played em all except this 1?i got my fallout.NV-       SKIDROW could it be the problem?
,Fussli,2011-07-21T20:16Z,"Okay, am I the only person who keep consistently crashing the moment he arrives to Big Mountain?

Using the command console to shut off the AI seems to disable whatever's causing the crash, but that means the DLC's pretty much unplayable.

Help? Anyone?"
,Rentonek,2011-07-21T23:12Z,Crashing at Hughs village
[V],matimike,2011-07-22T07:53Z,"works, you need to update first though, at least i did

,cyber15,2011-07-22T11:52Z,"The DLC activates fine and everything, but when I activate the satellite, the game keeps on crashing, even uninstalled all my mods, still not working, and yes, I did install Update 7 first. 
Anyone else got the same problem?"
,Rentonek,2011-07-22T12:05Z,"Ok it works now, fixed somehow maybe was some temporary issue"
,PPierce34,2011-07-23T06:01Z,Why wouldn't you just include the update that is required to play this?

I've never played Fallout New Vegas before neither Fallout New Vegas - Old World Blues before so I don't know if I've done everything right in order to play Fallout New Vegas - Old World Blues

First I've downloaded and installed the Fallout New Vegas torrent by SKIDROW

Then I've downloaded and copied the content of Fallout New Vegas - Old World Blues DLC torrent by ErikZown to my Fallout New Vegas Data folder and overwrited files

Finally I've downloaded and installed Update 7 from Fallout New Vegas Update 7 torrent by SKIDROW (I've copied to my Fallout New Vegas installation folder the crack files from this torrent and overwrited files)

The game starts and I can play it but I think it's Fallout New Vegas because I don't see Old World Blues title anywhere

Do I have to advance in the game or something in order to play Old World Blues?

Do you understand me? I want to play Fallout New Vegas - Old World Blues 

Help please

Thank you."
