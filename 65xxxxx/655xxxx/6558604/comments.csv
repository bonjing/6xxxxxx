,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-04-18T03:54Z,THIS WORKS. without virous. just extract your files out of the zipped folder. if you don't do that it will appear as fmod.ll not found. then install the trial version. then use the crack that got extracted and place it in the folder where the game got installed too. i extract by copying and pasting somewhere else lke the desktop. and i bring the crack to the desktop then cut it then drag it into the file folder
