type of game is also known as a dungeon crawler, in which the player takes 
his/her character through progressively difficult levels of a dungeon, fighting 
monsters, completing quests, collecting valuable items and gold, and improving 
the character's attributes and skills along the way. The dungeon in Fate has a 
randomized layout for each level; treasures found within each level are 
randomized, as are the number and type of monsters. Fate is rendered fully in 
3D, allowing the player to zoom in and out of the action as necessary; however, 
the camera cannot be rotated.
