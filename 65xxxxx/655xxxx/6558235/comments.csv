The typical trackers used by TPB:
udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80
udp://tracker.publicbt.com:80
udp://tracker.ccc.de:80
rarely work anymore.
This is the primary reason why many 'Bayers' report poor DL speeds.
Best to build a reliable set of trackers and open-up DHT, Peer Exchange, LDT, Proxy, NAT Port Mapping and of course Magnet.

But, this may require READING the manual of whatever client you're using. Who wants to do that?"
