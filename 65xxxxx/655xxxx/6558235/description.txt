Ubehage's EasyTools v1.20 with EasyCopy v1.0
--------------------------------------------

EasyTools is a small, fast and efficient tool. It puts an icon in the System-Tray next to the clock on your taskbar.
By clicking this icon, you get fast and easy access to some system functions:

- Wallpaper Changer; will let you select which pictures you want to use as desktop background, and change between them in specified intervals.

- Log off, Reboot, Shut down, or Stand by; all with 1 click. And with a little tweak so you can force Windows to terminate.



EasyCopy is also a small, fast and efficient tool, designed for your everyday backups, copying, moving around with files, etc...

Both tools are made to be as easy to use as possible; no manuals or help-files needed.
This version of EasyTools now also supports EasyCopy, and will provide you with quick access to your queued EasyCopy-jobs.
