,picklegerkin,2011-09-16T13:31Z,"Anybody actually got a copy of the program that works as cannot download from arcronis.

Would appreciate it as a torrent."
,Furiousone911,2011-09-17T01:37Z,Doesn't work with the version I downloaded today.  Says it's not a valid Acronis key.
,mukammalaurshaffaf,2011-09-17T14:00Z,I can understand the problem but i cannot upload the software because i am using 1Mb/s connection shared with 3 persons. Also there is problem of load shedding here. That is why i upload serials only. I will try to download the software again from acronis and comment on later.
,mukammalaurshaffaf,2011-10-05T13:22Z,"Your complaints are right and i am sorry.

When i posted the serial it was fully working with the Acronis Products. But now Acronis has blocked the serial in its new build.

So for all new comers, do not download the trial version from Acronis.

Sorry from who have already downloaded and serial is not working."

,jbruneau,2011-11-12T23:36Z,"Hi guys, anyone looking for the build needed for this key, I have uploaded it here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6814336

It took me forever to find a working copy, all of the other versions on the net basically had a failed RAR file :/!

I managed to find this copy under another name (virtualization something or other), but it works, and I tested it myself."
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-12-18T05:38Z,"See, when the guy uploaded the app, it was working. Now, it isn't. It's not his fault. That's how apps work.
Now, lay off him."
