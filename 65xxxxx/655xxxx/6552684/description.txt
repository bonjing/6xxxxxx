Machines

Be astonished as you delve into ancient worlds to find technology that was
first conceived thousands of years ago.

Discover how ancient drawings have led experts to believe the Egyptians unlocked 
the secret to flight with primitive helicopter designs... How the Chinese 
developed a 'wind car' in the 6th century AD, that could transport them over 
land at up to 30mph... and how 600-year old designs for a Batmobile-like 'rocket 
car', that appeared to be fuelled by gunpowder, were discovered in Italy.

From robots to helicopters, trains to cars and machines to cranes - these 10 
episodes of Ancient Discoveries will challenge the very foundations of 
conventional thinking about our ancestors' knowledge.
