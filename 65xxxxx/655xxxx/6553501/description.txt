Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County, often referred to as Laguna Beach,
was an MTV reality show documenting the lives of several teenagers living
in Laguna Beach, a seaside community located in Orange County, California.
It differs from the usual reality show in that it is structured as a
rather traditional narrative (more commonly seen in fictionalized
television dramas or soap operas) than a straightforward observant
documentary-style, which reality TV attempts to portray.
