,mikeddddd,2011-07-22T01:12Z,cavalencia. do i need to eliminate the drm myself or can you do that
,cavalencia,2011-07-22T03:52Z,"I already tried, it was my first time and I learned you need your Amazon or Kindle code in order to do that, that means that only the original owner can do it.  I also found that easiest way is with Calibre Plug Ins, try googling something like ""eliminate Amazon kindle drm calibre"""
,dsafjaly69,2011-07-24T14:39Z,"mikeddddd-    easiest way is to use DeDRM_Winapp_2.55,  its a python app that will strip out the DRM, but it will require your ID for the app to work.  Then you will be left with the non-drm version of the AZW file,  which you can then safely torrent."
