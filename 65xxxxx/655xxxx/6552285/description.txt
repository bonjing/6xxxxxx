This book offers relief to those tired of eating restaurant fare or expensive, overpackaged convenience foods at the end of a hard day. Bulk cooking, the practice of preparing numerous meals and freezing for later consumption, was a survival strategy the author employed after the birth of her first child. After a decade of experimentation, she shares her menu ideas, recipes, and tips for shopping and preparing these thrifty, frozen treasures that can simplify the daily meal rush. Recipes are for family favorites, but the author encourages readers to adapt their own recipes to the freezer method. Suggestions appropriate for large families and singles are included along with forms to help organize the cook. With more emphasis on frugality than Mimi Wilson and Mary Bath Lagerborg\'s Once-a-Month Cooking (Focus on the Family Pub., 1992), this will appeal to both the thrifty and the time-conscious.
