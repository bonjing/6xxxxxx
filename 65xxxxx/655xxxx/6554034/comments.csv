,kkikuta,2011-07-21T05:17Z,"sure kjdegraaf81, I suppose you would have us believe that aliens 'invented' all life on earth and then left never to return (as is brought out in the video).  Atheists really believe that?  Then who created the aliens?  And round and round we go.. idiots..."
,kjdegraaf81,2011-07-21T05:29Z,"kkikuta, we believe nothing of the sort.  Nice try."
,kkikuta,2011-07-26T19:39Z,"You need to see the movie in this torrent then, before you go bashing it.  It is mentioned more than once what some atheists believe; they're interviewed."
,kjdegraaf81,2011-07-29T00:34Z,"I did, in fact, watch this pseudo-documentary.  What makes you think I didn't?

The site I referenced earlier, http://www.expelledexposed.com/ , does a great job ripping apart the bullshit that Ben Stein shoveled in this film.

The alien business you brought up is likely in reference to a quote from Richard Dawkins that was taken wildly out of context (quote-mined).  Here is Dawkins' explanation of what he actually said:

http://richarddawkins.net/articles/2394-lying-for-jesus

Even if Dawkins believed in directed panspermia (which he doesn't), that would have precisely dick to do with (1) whether the theory of evolution provides the best known explanation of the diversity of life, (2) whether it is accepted and used by an overwhelming majority of biologists and (3) bears any responsibility for manmade atrocities.  (Free clue: ""yes"", ""yes"" and ""no"".)

Any other lame ""arguments"" you'd care to pull out of your ass?"
