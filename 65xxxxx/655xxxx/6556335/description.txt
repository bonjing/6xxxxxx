***This is a YouTube rip and therefore I have no control over the quality of the file. I do not have showtime otherwise I would rip you all an HD copy. If you have Showtime it would be greatly appreciated if you could rip an HD copy each week. In the mean time we will have to do with what we can get. If you don't like it, dont bitch. You've been warned in advance***
