,RockJaw,2011-08-02T12:17Z,THanks. There appears to be an issue with the software not accepting these registration numbers - will check back if a solution is found  -  software doawloaded from Acronis version 24/06/2011
,chilediez,2011-08-19T22:01Z,DOES NOT WORK :(
,mukammalaurshaffaf,2011-08-20T07:32Z,"It works 100%.

This serial is for ""Acronis Backup & Recovery 11 Workstation""

and not for

""Acronis Backup & Recovery 11 Advanced Workstation"""
,jp123999,2011-10-03T23:20Z,"I wish it was what you said, but I downloaded the trial version from Acronis and copied and pasted this serial and it said it was not valid. Couldn't be much simpler than that!"
,mukammalaurshaffaf,2011-10-05T13:20Z,"Your complaints are right and i am sorry.

When i posted the serial it was fully working with the Acronis Products. But now Acronis has blocked the serial in its new build.

So for all new comers, do not download the trial version from Acronis.

Sorry from who have already downloaded.

I will try to upload the whole software."
