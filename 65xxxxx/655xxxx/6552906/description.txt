There Will Be Blood
When Daniel Plainview - a ruthless oil prospector - learns of oil-rich land in California that 
can be bought cheaply, he moves his operation there and begins manipulating and exploiting the 
local landowners into selling him their property. Using his young adopted son H.W. to project 
the image of a caring family man, Plainview gains the cooperation of almost all the locals with l
ofty promises to build schools and cultivate the land to make their community flourish. Over time, 
Plainview's gradual accumulation of wealth and power causes his true self to surface, and he begins 
to slowly alienate himself from everyone in his life.
