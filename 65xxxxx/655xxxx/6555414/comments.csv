,Naturalrice,2011-07-21T22:24Z,Could you possibly list the books that are included so people can know whether it's worth downloading..?
,pulkit007,2011-07-21T22:50Z,"@Naturalrice Mate when u download the torrent it displays all the files, you can select and diselect that time. then also i will keep in mind next time when i upload other torrent.

thanks"
,Naturalrice,2011-07-21T23:09Z,"Apologies, it's just something nifty to know a head of time was all =P

How do you add these to the ipod anyways...?"
,rona-malico,2011-07-22T03:23Z,Thanks
,pulkit007,2011-07-22T04:10Z,"@Naturalrice dont apologies. we are all frnds here.
adding iBooks is similar like adding apps. just open iTunes, ""add a file to library"", open the iBook you want, it will come in another tab like ""music"" in iTunes.
:)
Happy Reading"

Not that it's a big problems, but it's simply something I want to get rid of if possible"
