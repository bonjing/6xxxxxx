Dreamerion is a gothic/dark ambient/neo-classical solo project of Jakub Ernestowicz that was formed in 2004. The main subject matter is title ghost â€“ Dreamerion, who takes and prepares children to leave this world. In the lyrics we can hear about the death of children, solitude, cry, all-embracing night and fear of death. Ghost comes only at night and he resides in Childrens Graveland. There is an eternal night and this overwhelming place is full of death.
