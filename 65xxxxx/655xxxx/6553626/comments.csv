,epochflail,2012-02-16T07:05Z,"Can someone paste the current patch set for all OSs? Anyone that got the HIB this was in would have access to the 1.0.9 rev.B patch. I can only find the official ""http://torrents.humblebundle.com"" version of the initial 1.0.7 HIB release which is unplayably crashy for me. Random crashes, often crashes moving between leaves, can't complete several missions as the game crashes on picking up the quest item, can't complete the game as I can't get to level 4, game crashes on every stairwell.

I mean when the game runs it's pretty good and damn funny, but it's got the mental stability of Charles Manson."
