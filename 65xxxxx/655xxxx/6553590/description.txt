IMPORTANT INFORMATION:

This is a High Definition video which can be burned to a standard DVD-R or DVD+R blank
disc. The resulting disc can only be played in compatible Blu-Ray devices such as a
standalone Blu-Ray player, Playstation 3, or BD-ROM drive. This cannot be played in any
DVD player, including some DVD-ROM drives, after it's been burned. However, the files can
always be dumped back onto a computer hard-drive after it's been burned with any DVD-ROM or
BD-ROM drive. For computer playback, you must have the appropriate hardware and software
applications. At a minimum, you will need a 2.0Ghz Dual Core CPU with at least 256MB of
graphics memory. There is also the option of recording to a solid-state memory card (SDHC,
Memory Stick), then played from many Blu-Ray disc players, PS3, or select Panasonic HDTV's.

PLEASE NOTE:

Your standalone Blu-Ray player must be capable of AVCHD playback. Most Blu-Ray players are
capable of doing this.

BURNING INFORMATION:

Any tool to burn a disk will do, but it must be able to burn a DVD using the UDF 2.50 file
system. The UDF 2.60 file system is also acceptable. Nero Burning ROM can do this starting
from version 7. You can also use free tools like ImgBurn, which can be downloaded from
www.imgburn.com.


Imgburn Step-By-Step Instructions:

* First, switch to "Build" mode by selecting Mode > Build from the main menu.
* For source, select the directory that contains BDMV directory.
* For target specify any name and location of your liking, this is where the disc image will
be written.
* Select Options page in the tabbed notebook on the right, specify UDF file system, revision
2.50.
* Keep "Recurse subdirectories" checked.
* Press the folder icon > disc icon button to write the image.

After this process is done, locate where you saved the image file (.iso), then burn to a
regular DVD-R or DVD+R disc. If using a standalone Blu-Ray player, make sure it will play
which ever disc (-R or +R) you are using. I recommend using a burning speed of 4x or less.

Once completed, you now have a high definition video on a regular DVD ready to be played on
your favorite Blu-Ray device.
