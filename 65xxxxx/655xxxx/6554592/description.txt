Monica Zetterlund (September 20, 1937 - May 12, 2005) was a Swedish singer and actress. In 1964 she recorded the critically acclaimed jazz album Waltz for Debby with Bill Evans, a record she herself described as the best I've done and was most proud of.

Writing for Allmusic, music critic Thom Jurek wrote of the album: The match is seemingly perfect. Evans' lyricism is well suited to a breezy, sophisticated songstress like Monica Zetterlund. There is an iciness on this recording, but it is difficult to decipher if it is in the performance or in the engineering where she seems to be way out in front of the band, when she was really in the middle of all the musicians in the studio. The Swedish version of Waltz for Debbie is a true delight because Zetterlund's voice becomes another instrument, soloing over the top of Evans' stunning selection of comping chords. In all this is an odd but special item, one that is necessary - for at least one listen - by any serious fan of the pianist and composer. (wikipedia)
