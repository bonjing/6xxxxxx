,mrhozer,2011-07-22T03:22Z,"Definitely does NOT include any subtitles, and is in Italian as specified. I can't find an English subtitle file for this movie anywhere online so far.

Quality: Not only Cam, but shaky cam sometimes.
A:5
V:5

Amazing movie, Thanks for the upload, I'll keep looking for subs."
,Danothesnitch,2011-07-25T06:31Z,"Lads probably best to either wait for a far better quality version or go watch it at the cinema. Unless its top quality it wont to the film justice.

The film itself is well worth watching"

,Blak01,2011-07-26T18:44Z,Does anyone have ANY idea as to the DVD release date? Read somewhere that it was set to be released in May - it's a couple months later and still no word. Anyone out there with the scoop?
,OrpheusDude,2011-07-31T00:54Z,"The only DVD/BluRay release date I can find on a legitimate source is German Amazon: 10 November 2011.

But go see it on a big screen before it disappears!"
