,rizi_rizi,2011-07-21T04:23Z,Does it require Apple ID during clean install?
,dojon2,2011-07-21T05:41Z,What is the build number?
,DalittleBIGmen,2011-07-21T08:00Z,"Do not get me worng! I appreciate a lot sould uploader. But since yesterday it has been a lot of version right here. 

I would suggest getting the GM or the retail version. 

GM = Lion retail version - updates. That means that if you want the retail version you need to update it and you will end up in the gm version.

Then just follow the instruccions:

I wish it will only be at much five torrents so there will more seeders and downloads will be faster.

Your call. "
,SoulUploader,2011-07-21T18:47Z,No rizi it doesn't.
,boniface,2011-07-22T03:13Z,"Fuck, just downloaded this file, it isversion 11a494 beta!!! not the Golden master which is v. 11A511 !!!"
,mensinge1984,2011-07-22T05:31Z,Calm the fuck down. One more time. Lion build version from App Store = 11A494. Thx SoulUploader
,mensinge1984,2011-07-22T05:33Z,"The installer is build 11A494, the actual OS is build 11A511 just like the GM."
,347927,2011-07-22T06:40Z,"headautomatica88 on youtube posted a video on how to make a bootable usb with this, running lion now works great"
,Xiaopangzi,2011-07-22T21:47Z,"I installed each of the four Developer Beta versions during the past several weeks, but I did a clean install today after reformatting the hard disk, installing Snow Leopard from the retail DVD, updating via Software Update, and then applying this installer copied onto a USB device (4 GB SD card was apparently to small).

Anyway, the result is that Photo Booth now has all of the effects that were not available in DB4 (11A511), and interestingly, the User Library is made invisible to users by default. I can't see a way to make it visible, so I'll try the usual apps to make system files visible. I'd like access to my Mail and iTunes folders in the User Library. Corresponding equivalent folders are also invisible on backup devices as well.

It still feels good to have a clean system, though."

,windsurfer905,2011-08-02T03:54Z,"It works perfectly and is the same version as the apple store so if it don't work for you it's a ""you"" issue not a install issue so work it out cause we can't fix stupid."
,thexonic,2011-08-04T03:19Z,It asks me to login to the account and when I do so it tells me this is not the account that has purchased it. Help plz.
,glennsafc,2011-08-04T12:33Z,"I've just completed installing this torrent and this is a honest review. Read...
Installed easily from dmg file.
Took around 20 minutes all together.
Works perfectly, all software & applications work great - some even quicker e.g. safari, photoshop...
When i visit appstore it also says installed when i click on mac lion app.
All features work 100%
Don't be scared to use this torrent, its excellent.
For my own piece of mind, i backed up my whole mac by using time machine just incase the mac lion didn't work 100%. However its 100% working and is great."
,negativethree,2011-08-08T03:56Z,If you run it directly from the desktop does the upgrade option work fine?
,Dannieloco,2011-08-12T17:26Z,^^ yes it does
,janusgate,2011-08-16T03:28Z,"ok..I am NOT new at this ,have been using software for years..but for some reason (and call me stupid if it's something simple..) but when I right click on the install package and hit show contents and go into the contents folder there is NO ""Shared support"" folder...I HAVE to be looking at something wrong, but I have ran it over in my head 50 times..someone PLEASE help!!"

cleaned installed on my dell M6500 laptop dual boot with windows 7..... works f9 "
,EsoteRIcalfreaK,2011-09-20T06:51Z,"I downloaded this and installed it on my 2008 MacBook Pro (right before Unibody), but I'm having trouble installing it on my 2008 Unibody MacBook Pro with a 500GB Momentus XT harddrive...

Long story short: when I try to boot from the DVD, the Apple logo comes on with the scroll wheel at the bottom, but after a few seconds the laptop shuts off out of nowhere. It doesn't reboot automatically. I've tried multiple times, and every single time it's the same thing. I read somewhere that it might be heating issues, but I tried many things to rule that out, and it has been ruled out as a possibility.

Does anyone know what on Earth it could be?"
,blurtixx,2011-09-25T08:45Z,"Thanks uploader! This torrent saved me when even the AppleCare reps couldn't help.

I did not need an Apple ID to install, for everyone who needs to know.

I bought an iMac that came preinstalled with Lion, and it had some screen flickering issues. I reinstalled Lion once and it didn't help. I decided to do a clean install before finally bringing in to Apple for servicing.

After I erase my HDD as per Apple's instructions for a clean install, I was going to reinstall Lion when the recovery utility prompted me 'Could not find installation information on this machine'. That leaves me with an useless iMac! My solution was to download this torrent and restore the image into an SD Card, then install Lion from there.

Really disappointed that I'm paying a premium for a Mac that is supposed to 'just work' but I have to solve problems as such. Is it so hard to provide a basic OS recovery CD with every Mac?"

,clichehandle,2011-12-02T21:51Z,There is no Shared Support folder inside Contents. Any advice?
,farley521,2011-12-06T16:16Z,"Works perfectly. Absolutely no problems. This is the real deal, folks, and this is my first comment on TPB (I registered just to offer my thanks).

I was looking for a disk (I'm running Lion 10.7.3, legit) on an early 2002 MBP, and I wanted to try Lion server (which I hear i rubbish), so I installed this in VMware. It is nice to know that if I need a clean install I have a lovely dmg thanks to SoulUploader.

Apple shit the bed with App store crap for an OS install, without also offering a CD (yeah, yeah, restore partition etc, but how ordinary folk suppsed to figure that out). I feel sorry those with new Macs."
,adonay28,2012-02-08T20:49Z,"works perfect for me, i did a clean install with no problems, thanks.."
,mistahkidd,2012-03-17T19:33Z,thanks man!
,Suomisisu,2012-05-29T18:31Z,"@EsoteRIcalfreaK Momentus XT drivers are NOT supported.. your issue is exactly what everyone else has trying to install on those drives. Bad luck.

@everyone else. Seriously guys, do you need a fucking ID that has purchased Lion already or not? I don't want to go ahead and waste DVDs and then be forced to fucking log in and prove that I have already paid for this shit... some say that it works on Non-apple PCs (but how do I know you tards didn't already buy it anyway) and some say that you need an ID that has bought it. So be fucking clear. Which one is it?"
,darshak_bhatti,2012-06-13T08:23Z,can you provide me step by step guide???...please i m using windows 7..
