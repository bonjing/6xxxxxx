Exactly what it says on the title, a bootable retail Lion .dmg file which can be burnt to a disk using Disk Utility for a clean install rather than having to install over a system using the Mac App Store .app 

Thought it'd be worth an upload since Apple are going to sell bootable USBs with Lion on for $79
