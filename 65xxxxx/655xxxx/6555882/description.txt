This program, the longest single dvd we've produced, takes you from New York's JFK Airport around the world back to JFK in the cockpit of the 747-200 and 747-400.

Pilots give you many different presentations, you will see them at work and listen to communications with ATC even witness a go-around on short final at Miami's International Airport.
