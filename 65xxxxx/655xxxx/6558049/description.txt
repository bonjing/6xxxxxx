Synopsis [?]: Let's be honest.. we all can hate on Nero for being bloated and
expensive.. but when we're honest.. we all know it provides the best platform
for burning CD, DVD, BD. For non-important items, freeware is fine... but notice
how fast the media begins to skip? that's because of the software. 

[Format Explanation]
I prefer NSIS or PAL formats myself, but with applications that require tons of
requirements, runtime registrations, runtime .dlls, etc.. it's easier to pack
with Xenocode. The reason i hate Xenocode/ThinStall is they use the registry
for it's sandbox, and creates directories for runtime files in "XSxS" directory.

Well.. this "hybrid" utilizes the best of both worlds. 

It's been created with Xenocode, but tested thoroughly for all the registry
entries, files, and directories it leaves behind, and cleaned up with an NSIS
launcher... making it truly "stealth".

i.e.
PortableAppz has a version posted but it doesn't even work. 
That's because Nero requires too many dll's and runtime files to be registered,
and all is different depending on the Operating System.

Not to mention the licensing... 

[Final Words]
I have thoroughly tested on XP, Vista, and Win7, both 32 and 64Bit to find all 
the registry entries and files left behind. 

Another benefit of packing with Xenofex is it's optimized for USB/Portable Media.
