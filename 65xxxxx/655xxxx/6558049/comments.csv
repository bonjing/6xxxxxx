,NovaThunder,2011-09-12T20:55Z,"Using this on Windows 7 64bit. It works perfectly.

Tho there is no Nero vision or anything else than Nero Burning Rom.

The program version is 10.2.11000.12.100

No need to register, no need to disconnect from the internet, no need for serial nor activation.

Be aware that you cannot make DVD-video from .avi, .mpg, .mp4 or any other types with this program.

Thanks for this release XxFukenGruvenxX. :-)"
