VLC Media Player is a long-time open-source favorite, and the latest version 
is also the first to be out of beta development. It's not the only option for 
free video playback, but it's one of the best, and the feature updates in 
version 1 make it well worth the upgrade.
Users can now get frame-by-frame advancement, granular speed controls allowing 
for on-the-fly slower or faster playback, and live recording of streaming video. The toolbars are fully customizable, so you can have only the buttons you need in the interface, there's AirTunes streaming, and there's better integration in Gtk environments. Along with the improvements, VLC continues to offer robust support for a wide range of video and audio formats, including OGG, MP2, MP3, MP4, DivX, HD codecs like AES3, Raw Dirac, and even support for playing back zipped files.
The default interface is still a stripped down player that belies VLC's 
functionality and features. Skinning can fix that quickly, but behavior can 
still be a bit unpredictable depending on the quality of the skin. VLC's 
open-source foundation and community ensures that it evolves quickly and often, 
with new features and fixes released frequently. Overall, VLC Media Player is a 
must-have application for its ability to open just about any type of video file 
you throw at it.
