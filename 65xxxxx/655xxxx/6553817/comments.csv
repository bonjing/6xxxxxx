,ripdzir,2011-07-22T20:16Z,could you upload 3 doors down's latest album time of my life in flac?
,EelsUp,2011-08-14T00:58Z,"Don't waste your time downloading unless you want to convert them afterward. Video files are great for VLC, but why in the hell would you post music files in that format? Complete fucking waste of time."
[T],solstars,2011-10-29T05:45Z,"Eelsup, WTF?  These are in FLAC format.  Free Lossless AUDIO Codec.  VLC has nothing to do with it, and it is clearly labeled as FLAC.  You should read before you download.  Thanks for the awesome up, bubanee."
