In 2011, as part of a new, long-term agreement, the complete catalogue from one of our nation's great ever bands, INXS, is proudly reissued by Universal Music Australia. The enviable body of work from one of the world's most popular bands of the past 30 years enjoys a long-overdue remaster and regeneration - a new chapter in the band's career - a band who have provided the soundtrack to all our lives. From their original formation in Australia in 1977, INXS created a body of work which has sold more than 30 million albums worldwide, including No. 1 hits in four continents, six UK Top 10 albums, five US Top 20 albums, and 33 hits in their homeland Australia. The band's most successful releases include 1987's "Kick," with global sales of 10 million,1990's "X" and 1992's "Welcome To Wherever You Are". This beautiful box set compiles the band's enviable 10-album catalogue, in a heavy card slipcase - available for a limited time only.
