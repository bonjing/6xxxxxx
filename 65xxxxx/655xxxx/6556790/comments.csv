,VORONGM,2011-07-22T15:11Z,How good is the quality of this rip ?
[T],User_01,2011-07-22T22:39Z,"And what is your scale for quality standard Your Highness, so i'll be sure you're pleased kind King?

I'm sick of this fucking idiots, morons, stupid asking people, or whatever, that they are so fucking lazy they can't even download something that's free and provided for them by someone else FREE OF ANY CHARGES. Is not like you have 100 or so choices of blu-ray rips for this copy of the movie and you want the best you can get between them. First do the not so easy job and upload something more then just a crappy software file and then ask on someone's torrent ""hey, who downloaded this, can tell me if i should botter to do it so too..."". 

Fuck you and your friends who leech but never seed. And then you also complain...""there aren't seeders enogh for me to download at the speed that i wish.."". ""Hit and run"" just a stupid and inconsiderable thing to do in the world of torrents."

[T],User_01,2011-09-10T04:01Z,"...but try to mind your language and treat people better.... ???

Yep, i guess is not enough to make the torrent available to him. Maybe i should buy the blu-ray for him, so he'll be fully satisfied (1080p etc). Are you for real?

Now, get off my back and go lecture someone else..."
