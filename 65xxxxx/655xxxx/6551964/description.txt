                           DESCRiPTiON 

 The Blue Cross animal welfare group becomes the first charity to get the      
 Undercover Boss treatment, as chief executive Kim Hamilton poses as a         
 volunteer worker, performing such tasks as cleaning kennels and helping cats  
 give birth. Her aim is to find out how tough it is for staff on the front line
 as she decides what, if anything, has to be changed.  
                        
                                 Enjoy!
