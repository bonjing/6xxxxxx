Notes: Despite the title, Bluesified is as much a gospel album as a blues album, and it shows Ernie Hawkins taking a step closer to the masterful level of blues-and-spirituals versatility set by his two main influences, Reverend Gary Davis and Blind Willie McTell. As he did on his previous two solo albums, Hawkins pays considerable homage the Davis canon here, with achingly good results on "I Belong to the Band" (sung by guest vocalist Maria Muldaur) and a 12-string rendition of "Crucifixion" into which Hawkins also weaves the melody of "Jesus Gonna Make Up My Dying Bed." But whereas 1996's Blues Advice presented Hawkins in more of a revivalist mode, Bluesified has him stretching out, experimenting with musical roots ranging from prewar jazz to country to African folk songs. In the end, Hawkins still puts on a formidable ragtime guitar clinic -- but he's obviously got a lot on his mind besides the blues.
