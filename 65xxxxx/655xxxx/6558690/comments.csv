,enonumus,2012-02-20T13:00Z,"A8/V8  720P resolution, but the quality/detail is low.  Very similar to DVD quality due to the extremely low bitrate used to meet the 700MB file size that YIFY has targeted for their torrents.  Unfortunately this is the only 720P torrent available for this movie, so there are no other options at the moment.  Thanks for the up, but after comparing to a perfect DVD-RIP, it's actually better, so this is going in the recycle bin.  "
