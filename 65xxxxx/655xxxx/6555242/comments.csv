,tymature,2012-01-06T12:53Z,"Hi,

wilsonljx is right. It does run okay if you ""doctor"" the hosts file.  You have to open the ""hosts"" file with notepad.  

Add, 

127.0.0.1 www.keywordindex.com
127.0.0.1 keywordindex.com
127.0.0.1 www.axandra.com
127.0.0.1 axandra.com

to the bottom of the ""hosts"" file above the line ""::1             localhost""

Save the file as ""hosts.txt"" to the documents folder.

Rename the ""hosts"" file in ""System32/drivers/etc/hosts"" to ""hosts-old060112"" or something like it.

Rename the new ""hosts.txt"" in the documents folder to ""hosts"".  Then copy this new ""hosts"" file to ""System32/drivers/etc/hosts"".

Run IBP Arelis.  Enter ""Cool Release"" and the code.

The problem is no updates are possible because the new ""hosts"" file stops the program from accessing the internet.

Ty"

,Shadal,2012-05-15T06:02Z,"The problem I have with all of v11 releases is while doing a search engine submission it gets to about 58% complete, then crashes the program.

v9.7.1 still seems to be the most stable - too bad ;(

,warezrus,2012-06-05T14:53Z,"It works fine.
