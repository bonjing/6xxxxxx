and no vision left to see
then man must go  
where few dare to go
beneath the imdb rating of 3.50 "

,mrmeade,2011-07-25T13:31Z,"Shit Movie, don't waste your time, poor acting"
,moncho5,2011-07-25T16:20Z,Una mala imitaci贸n de los personajes estilo Clint Eastwood.  Buena copia pero no merece la pena ni el tema ni la interpetaci贸n.

The movie is really quite bad.  Its only redeeming quality is the beautiful sceenery of the Yukon Territory.  It could be best described as government propaganda.  The upright, rightous mountie takes on a gang of dirty low-life Russians (actually Latvians) and cleans up the little village.

The acting is not just bad it is cheesey.  The story line, you can see comming from a hundred miles away."
