,Killer132,2011-07-31T22:04Z,"Hey guys, this torrent works great! One problem: the audio. I think there's a delay and so the cutscenes have no sound at times and the audio files on the pda have no sound. A fix anyone?"

CC2RLHHC3LH7BJHR 06 worked for me"
,esticazzi,2011-08-27T23:59Z,"For the resolution issue hold ""cmd ⌘""  just after heaving launched the application (before it opens): a little window appears where you can select the resolution, you can even choose some that are not available inside the game."
,esticazzi,2011-08-28T00:00Z,...and really thanks Latino001!
,Trippn740,2011-09-02T11:46Z,"might be a dumb question... but is there any way that I could use little snitch to block the cd key check but allow online play? I've noticed that if someone else using this version is on multiplayer, it won't accept the cd code... I'm pretty sure that this isn't possible, but I just wanna know for sure... lol"
,livto,2011-09-09T15:26Z,"I can't find the CD key, anyway CC2RLHHC3LH7BJHR 06 doesn't work (already in use). Can anyone help me?"
,MrMatt90,2011-09-27T16:46Z,"OKAY.
Works fine on OS X 10.7.

HOW TO SET RESOLUTION FOR ALL OF YOU HAVING TROUBLE.
Hold Command while starting the game.  This brings up a Mac Only menu which lets you set the resolution as well as OpenAL settings.

Enjoy and Peace out."
,danny_d_v,2011-10-07T21:25Z,"hey i have a problem in the game :( In the beginning after following the drone you need to enter the elevator and the next game loads. Suddenly the game goes back to the beginning and I need to do everything back over again. I've just dragged the doom launch icon to the launchpad. 
(key code is ok, using macbook pro 13inch I5 2011 model)  

many thanx for the guy or girl ho can solve this :-)"
,CEMEH4,2011-10-13T15:56Z,"Works great on 7.1, to prevent key verification add idnet.ua-corp.com to /etc/hosts like that (in terminal):

$ sudo bash -c ""echo \""127.0.0.1 idnet.ua-corp.com\"" >> /etc/hosts"""
,imgandhi,2011-11-13T19:03Z,"Great torrent, remember to be offline when you enter the cd key and block the auto verification from terminal. No multiplayer obviously."
,locus11,2011-11-22T10:09Z,"same problem as danny_d_v. The second chapter loads and then just returns to main menu. Any ideas, anyone?"
,locus11,2011-11-22T10:56Z,"You can avoid this by opening console(alt+ctrl+~) and entering ""map game/mars_city2"".This will take you to the level AFTER the mars underground map. Since,unfortunately, u can't access the mars underground map through console either. It just reverts to the main menu."
,guitarjoa,2012-01-12T00:14Z,"Good stuff, i used key CC2RLHHC3LH7BJHR 06 while disabling wifi and Cmd+Ctrl while launching to set screen resolution. Another great game i don't need bootcamp for :)"
,zntfabio,2012-01-26T14:27Z,I'm having some issues with the sound... It's intermittent. Does anyone knows how to fix it? Thanks in advance! And thanks to Latino001 for the upload!
,zntfabio,2012-01-27T15:02Z,"Well, found a way do avoid the sound issue :) Everytime I realize that sound is failing, I save the game and load it right away. It's not the best but it works. Problem now is to go from Alpha Labs 4 to Enpro Plant... It reverts to main menu everytime I try to load it :( Really sad man..."
,colick,2012-02-15T04:35Z,"Concerning the game exiting to the main menu when loading the next level; It worked for me after ejecting any mounted drives.

""You might have to disable any ""Virtual CD/DVD-drives"". The copy-protect loaders these days, actively seek out any virtual drives and refuse to continue if one is detected. This is an effort to prevent a disc image from being created, thus fooling the copy protection."""
,ticenin1,2012-02-18T19:00Z,hey what do you do when you follow the little creature to the elavatore and then goes to main enu
,PPLOHMAMA,2012-02-19T23:43Z,"1.Mounted dmg

2.Dragged ''Doom 3'' folder to applications

3.Unmounted dmg

4.When asked for cd-key i removed internet-cable and put cd-key from comments

5.Before game starts, press ''cmd âŒ˜'' button down. (can choose resolution outside game)

6.Play the game
---------------------------------------------------
I have Intel based Macbook, it works awesome but crashes in Boiler Room. (seems like graphical leak/crash, game runs but graphics gone messed up)
---------------------------------------------------"
,PPLOHMAMA,2012-02-19T23:48Z,"So i think you have to get:
Doom 3 Mac Update 1.3.1 Rev A.
-Fix a potential crash in physics (maybe that fixes the crashing that im having)

and Doom 3 Mac 1.3.1 Rev A. NoDVD/NoCD/Crack
to actually play game with new update.

ill tell you guys if it works"
,KarlMarxFIN,2012-03-16T17:58Z,Possible to use mods on this?
,de_Kuijer,2012-06-11T12:18Z,"Thank for the game!
Anyone know where the save files are at? I had to wipe my HD and forgot to back them up, so i downloaded some auto saves but can not figure out where to put them..."
