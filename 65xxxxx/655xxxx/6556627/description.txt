Gnome Runner is an arcade game for PC. Playing as a gnome, you will have to get through levels collecting treasures. Watch out for the monsters! They will prevent you from completing the task. You will be really amused with unexpectedly appearing magic mushrooms. After eating such mushrooms the monsters get the ability to run very fast, finding the shortest way to the gnome. You will need quick reflexes not to fall into the monstersâ€™ traps, and to get through levels successfully.

Brief description of the game rules:

In order to pass each level the player has to pick up all the treasures while trying to avoid collision with the monsters. With each collision the player will lose one life. Every magic mushroom brings the player additional points. The monsters can pick up such mushrooms too. In this case they will improve their abilities, running very fast and preventing the gnome from collecting the treasures. Every time the player passes a level without losing a life, he gets a silver cup. In order to get a gold cup, the player should not only pass a level and save all lives, but also pick up the necessary number of magic mushrooms.
