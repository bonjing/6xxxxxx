None of the files I will be uploading are mine, the credits go to others. 
All the files can be found on bittorrent sites. 
All have been re-encoded and cleaned up.

To everyone who don't hit and run but keep on seeding - THANKS.

This 2 disc set is compiled from 4 dvd5s which (I'm guessing) must have been 4 dvd9s originally.The original version had Portuguese menus only which have been replaced by English menus.There is no difference between the menus except the English text. 

If the subtitles appear, just turn them off. They are not burnt into the video. 

No compression to make dvd9.

D2 has 60 episodes 

Enjoy
