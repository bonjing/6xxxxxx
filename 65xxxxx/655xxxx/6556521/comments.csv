Excellent copy and after a quick review looks like a very good book.

Certainly a worthwhile book and one I think should be mandatory for all high school students, not an elective in college which many students will never take.

Just my 2 cents, but this is very useful information, lifelong information, and information that one does not learn on their own.

I think that if every high school student took this type of class they average person would not be in the debt they are.  Again, just my 2 cents for what it's worth.

The math is easy .... and I was searching for this type of book for a friends children and this is the only book of it's type I found on tbp, so again, many thanks to the uploader."

I think that if every high school student took this type of class,  THE  average person would not be in the debt THAT SO MANY are. Again, just my 2 cents for what it's worth.
