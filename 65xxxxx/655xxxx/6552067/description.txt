Folder Latch 4 gives you the ability to lock your folders! 
Such as private stuff you don't want anyone to see! Simply place files in a folder, then use this nifty little software to lock the folder with your very own password!

((When files has been locked, it will move the locked folder to Local Disc C))

Install, then simply enter the folder (where Folder Latch 4 is located after the installation) then right click and go to properties, then check "Run this program as an administrator". And you're good to go.

You can either run the software through it's ".EXE" file. Or right click on a folder you want to lock. Then look for "Lock Folder". Click on it. Then it will take you to the locking process, where you enter your password.
Easy to use!
