I have never tried to upgrade from home to xp Pro, but i have a link you can try read, http://www.mydigitallife.info/convert-and-upgrade-windows-xp-home-to-professional-without-reinstalling/ . Maybee it will help you. but if you want to secure your movies and so on, why not just copy to external or extra harddrive and make a new install of xp pro ?
