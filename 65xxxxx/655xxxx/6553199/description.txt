The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This twenty-first alphabetical installment is: Gir-Gz (Minus Green Lantern)
Green Lantern will be the next uploard.


What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 800-850gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.


================================

What shall I babble about today?
     About the "Gothamâ€¦" books below. Did you know that New York City was sometimes called "The Gotham City" long ago? (used originally by Washington Irving) Both Metropolis and Gotham City were thinly disguised versions of New York City, even including highly recognizable landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State building under different names like the city itself. So Batman and Superman clearly lived in the same place, but yet they did not.
     I don't know why they changed the name. Possibly so no smart-aleck 13 year olds could write letters correcting every detail that did not match up with the real city. That's what I would have done. (Both the renaming and the nitpicking, since I was a smart-aleck 13 year old,, and still know-it-all at times, and hate smart-aleck know it alls. 
     As my usual stream of consciousness writing style  - based on my bouncing ball "train of thought"  kicks in (great metaphor - a bouncing train), we learn that the "aleck" really is from the name "Alexander", but what little Aleck did to become synonymous with irritating know-it-alls is unknown, as is the identity of young Aleck. I presume him young not only because "Aleck" is a diminutive and the term is 19th century in origin. (When many were a bit more formal in language usage -I'm possibly making that up) But because this attitude is more common in the young. I for one have found as I have aged that I am a lot less sure I'm right about everything. I'm also a lot more willing to admit I lack sufficient data to make a conclusion. My wife, by contrast, never a know-it-all, but not a curious-about-everything-questioner like me, still shows a strong tendency to want an answer, any answer, so she'll make up a possible one and be happy with it, rather than accept the mystery -  filled away under "things I would like to know, but don't".

     Even though I don't know everything, I wish I did. Have you ever imagined what you would wish for if you had the legendary "three wishes" famed in song and story? One of mine used to be to know everything that could be learned by taking any course offered at this major university I'm associated with. This would include all possible research papers or independent study topics you might do in fulfillment of any course offering - so that's lot. 
     I like to specify my wishes in detail, hoping to avoid the legendary "Genie deliberately or accidentally misunderstands or misapplies your wish, leading to undesirable consequences" trap. This is also famed in songs and stories made up by people who want to give you a lecture about the folly of wishing instead of working, but know you  won't listen. 
     E.G. you wish for a ten million dollars and it turns out to be stolen from banks, and the FBI comes knocking at your door. The simple cash wish is hopeless in today's world anyway. If you try to deposit it in as  US Bank and probably most county's banks, the government will be notified as it is possibly drug or terrorist money. Then the tax people will also know and want their chunk, which is ok as far as it goes, but there will be all these awkward questions about where it came from from the police. I think in the US if you can't explain it it will be presumed to be "ill gotten money" and be confiscated, despite that I think this is blatantly un-constitutional. You can try to hide it in your basement, but if you spend much it may be noticed that  you are spending more than you earn and that's how they got Al Capone for tax evasion. Again with the awkward questions from the police too. So now you have to launder it. Do you know how? If you get caught, money laundering is enough for most juries I'm sure.  The Genie defense won't even get you an insanity plea. Jail plus forced psychiatrist visits.

These "golden age" comics are mostly not by DC but use characters that DC has revived to one degree or another. Some of the characters or stories are in the public domain now, so other companies are free to use them. AC Comics in particular reprinted quite a few old stories, but typically only in B&W to save costs. Also unfortunately they are not yet scanned, or perhaps the unscanned ones are stories already scanned in the original comics. That kind of cross checking is not work the effort to me.

     Yes, Guy Gardner's been a Green Lantern but remember this is alphabetical, not topical, so he goes here not in the Green Lantern post.. Besides he never deserved to be one. The ultra clean cut "man without fear"  Hal Jordan and this guy in the same pool? No no no. By the way does Hal stand for Harold? Harold is not a name associated with bravery and heroic action in US culture. It's rather a nerdy and accountant type name, but somehow Hal is OK in this case. Sorry all Harolds and accountants, I don't make the stereotypes, I just enforce them viciously. It's my job. I carry a badge.
     Guy's just about everything I hate about men in one package. You're probably thinking "I thought J13 was a man" and you'd be right. But I have never gotten along with men beyond a cordial work relationship and the like. No offense meant guys, but I just can't relate to typical guy thinking,  interests, and most importantly friendship styles. And yes you are mostly typical. Just ask your wives, girlfriends, or boyfriends. Even guys who are atypical tend to conform around other guys. 
    What friends I have had have been almost all women. This unfortunately is nearly "unpossible" in a world of jealous men, so friends are in short supply.  Fortunately I seem to be largely asocial. My long term goal as I get older is  to be that weird guy who lives in the creepy house on the hill  and never talks to anyone. All the kids in the neighborhood will be afraid of me and make up stories about me. I won't be the "keep the ball if it goes in my yard type", I'm not mean and I like kids, but I'll try to think of things to play with their minds, and their parent's minds as well. This will stamp out any social interaction except from the most aggressively friendly types. "I want to be let alone" as Greta Garbo said (not "be alone" as oft misquoted).  I'll have to be careful to maintain that balance of fear and yet actual harmlessness to avoid retaliatory strikes by the kids or even the adults. 
     I think putting a telescope in my window would be cool and creepy, but in these paranoid day neighbors will call the police and accuse me of spying on their wives and daughters. (Which leads to police stopping but for a chat) Which I totally would of course, I'm a hereto male after all. I'm talking MILFS and Jailbait (adult bodies, under age), I'm no pedo. Let any straight man who knows in his heart he would always resist watching the neighbor girl in her bikini or her Mom undressing by her window, speak now so we'll know who the liars are. I don't think my wife would go for it anyway.
