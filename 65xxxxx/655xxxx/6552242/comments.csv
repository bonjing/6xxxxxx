Learn Malayalam first, if you learn that rest al is easy."
[T],tdkdemon,2011-07-20T18:38Z,"hmmm.... Each hav unique origins..but as u may know after hindi tamil is been approved recently for its ethic values and anciet significance...So u may start with Tamil...If u know tamil well then u can learn malayalam easilly...its some wat modified from tamil..
their lots of basic books to teach each languages ...u can google `em..
i am now keen to knw bengali...but even u guys name also very long and it has first middle and last name...thn how difficult will it be to learn bengali... "
,WorldLover,2011-07-20T19:38Z,"well as for avan ivan learn tamil :D because one of the oldest languages in the world ,but if you learn telugu, its the most spoken south indian language ,because population and so on !!and yeah you can understand bit kannada if you learn telugu and you can understand bit malayalam if you learn tamil 

so your choice !and if you learn 1 south indian language you can still understand some basics like me- you- they and so on !!!!!

and yeah all except tamil have most sanskrit influence so better take telugu otherwise i would say tamil because a lot of good movies and more

and HINDI?lol i dont learn it thank god :D"
,Robin5555,2011-07-21T03:31Z,"You people are all very helpful, very useful comments, thanks to all of you. i think i should start with Tamil then Telegu. i learned Sanskrit for 3 years & hindi for 1 year in school. i want to understand d basic. try to read & write & understand movies.

@ tdkdemon

Yes, we have a long name. but most of the time you can ignore d middle part in a name. it's difficult to learn Bengali a bit. but if you understand & speak Hindi language it's very easy to learn Bengali also. many thanks again. have a nice time.."
,WorldLover,2011-07-22T00:51Z,"yeah sanskrit ok because important classic language :D
but no one needs hindi 
yeah learn tamil or telugu -your choice mate -with sanskrit you have best chances to learn telugu because big  influence "

,osthi,2012-01-10T12:40Z,NO ONE EQUAL TO TAMIL LAUNGUAGE .... FIRST LEARN TAMIL...... THEN ATOMATICALLY OTHERS COME................
,killerthriller212,2012-04-12T14:07Z,"I am sorry i believe i am a little late for the chat(language topic) I agree with others Learning Tamil will let you learn other south Indian languages easily,, but as they say languages are jealous and they rarely cooperate.. and even worse the culture and history Indian People and their language is very old and very diverse that each and every region has its own cultural and linguistic versions that are almost unique and different from one another.. so try to learn atleast Tamil and Telugu to ensure you can cope with other languages easily... All the best....    "
