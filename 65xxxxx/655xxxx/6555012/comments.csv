,marty2004,2011-07-22T03:49Z,"Petter35, i just had a quick look and no one in the usa is currently ripping letterman in HD,so i'm affraid your stuck with 480p or what ever it works out too."
,petter35,2011-07-22T13:00Z,"Most of the top talkshows like conan,leno,fallon and ferguson are up in hd. So why not letterman?
Thank you for giving me this information marty. I prefer these talkshows in hd. Conan also who is my favorite talkshow host.
So if u have the chance,please put up conan in hd.
I am off for holidays now for 2 weeks,so I hope to get conan and some of the other ones in hd when coming back.
Thanks again!"
,petter35,2011-07-22T13:21Z,"Thanks for the information marty2004. I love watching the big talksjows in HD like conan,leno,fallon,ferguson. I am sad that I don't get letterman in HD right now. I hope it may change sometimes in the near future. My favorite is Conan,so please put him up,and if in HD,for me that is the best.
Thanks again marty2004 for the time."
