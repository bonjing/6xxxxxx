,tomcat1234,2011-07-22T22:46Z,"does this version have the subtitles issue the other versions have? The extended version did not have an American/western release, so the subtitles are from the ""not-extended"" version, creating an issue with subtitles. Is that remedied in this release?"
[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-22T23:09Z,I believe it's all sorted.
,digs5446,2011-07-23T00:12Z,"no offense to the uploader, but i'd like a report from someone who actually tests the download.  i just checked out his Oldboy upload and the audio tracks and subs are not what is described and from what i can tell there is no proper DTS Korean track without some sort of superimposed commentary / translation."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-23T02:05Z,I will have a look at Oldboy sometime this weekend and replace it if it's dodgy. I'm afraid I don't have time to watch everything before uploading.
,digs5446,2011-07-23T13:36Z,"i understand completely, and don't mean to sound ungrateful.  you do a great service providing all these uploads - i just want to point out things i feel might mislead others or cause frustration, since we all know time is in short supply for many of us..."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-23T15:14Z,"I've checked OLDBOY, and there is NOTHING WONG with it. Audio #3 is the original Korean ONLY - as stated in the description - and there is also nothing wrong with the subs.

Please refrain from making false claims."
,run3,2011-07-23T18:53Z,Why not 1080p?
[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-23T20:57Z,"Many reasons. If you want 1080p, try someone else."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-23T20:58Z,...or buy the disc
,bigghands,2011-07-24T00:24Z,"Hmmm

Doesn't sound like GoodFilms is gonna get a green skull anytime soon."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-24T02:34Z,"Haha... I will never get a green skull, for reasons you know nothing of. And there is no difference between skulls anyway (apart from the captcha).

By the way, your comment makes no sense here lol."
,abhikrit,2011-07-24T13:40Z,thanks for the extended version.
,UrNotRdy,2011-07-27T05:46Z,"Most people here border on nonsensical (i.e. bitching w/o a point) instead of thanking. 

I surely don't thank god every morning but people who go through the effort of sharing something that its of profound worth. If you don't like the upload, I invite you all to go to http://lemonparty.org and have fun!"
,burak.82,2011-07-31T18:03Z,"thanks for the upload, started to download"

,gomushin,2011-08-04T21:52Z,"appreciate it, thanks :)"
,w0rtez,2011-08-08T22:45Z,@GoodFilms... just wanted to ask you if there was a problem  with this torrent or something.. i heard someone saying about subtitles problems...
,DarkAngel97,2011-08-18T16:50Z,There is no problem with the english subtitles
,Tuppy,2011-09-14T18:11Z,"*spoilers* maybe

concerning subtitles
@59:22 there does seem to be a little bit missing in the young samurais response.
Missing is: (I've fenced with real blades many times but...) 
and only ""killing a man is a first."" appears. 

Noticed in a few other parts as well.
Doesn't spoil my enjoyment of the film at all. 
I'll just find different subs. sometime in the future when I re-watch. great quality also sound and video"

,PublicSecrecy,2011-10-11T20:42Z,"This film is greatâit's a new level of discipline and poetry that is usually only found fleetingly in Takashi Miike's other 'Western' (in appeal) work. 

And of course, A+ quality video/audio, etc etc"
,kingjoser,2011-10-20T07:10Z,@UrNotRdy how would you know of a place like lemonparty.org you nasty Fuck!
,kingjoser,2011-10-20T18:36Z,"This is the correct subtitles:http://subscene.com/english/13-Assassins/subtitle-456872.aspx  Its has 1,018 lines. 15 more than the subs that come with this and its timed perfectly. Just rename the sub file exactly as the video file and put the sub file in the same folder. Tada!"
,kingjoser,2011-10-21T01:45Z,"@Tuppy You are correct. That line is in the subs that I provided the link to. Most complete, if not, Totally complete subs I've found"

Excellent torrent!

Not dubbed but has English subs which imo is better. Flick a bit long, but awesome long battle scene at the end, and I mean LONG!"
