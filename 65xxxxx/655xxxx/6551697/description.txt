    The mummy of long dormant, but powerful Caribbean voodoo priest          
    Gatanebo gets revived on a luxury South Seas ocean liner as a big        
    buff bald guy and proceeds to terrorize the passengers. Gatanebo         
    beheads several folks, occasionally reverts back to his prune-faced      
    mummified state, and falls for the ravishing Sylvia, who reminds him     
    of his old flame Kenya.
