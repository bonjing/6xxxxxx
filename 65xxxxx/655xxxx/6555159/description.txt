Assuming only background knowledge of algebra and elementary calculus, and access to a modern personal computer, Nonlinear Computer Modeling of Chemical and Biochemical Data presents the fundamental basis and procedures of data modeling by computer using nonlinear regression analysis. Bypassing the need for intermediary analytical stages, this method allows for rapid analysis of highly complex processes, thereby enabling reliable information to be extracted from raw experimental data.
