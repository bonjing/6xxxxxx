Lego Digital DesignerLego Digital Designer, or LDD, is a free computer program produced by the Lego Group as a part of Lego Design By Me. It is available for Mac and Windows platforms. The program allows users to build models using virtual Lego bricks, in a computer-aided design like manner. These can be uploaded, along with instructions and a box design, to the Lego Design By Me website, from where the models can be ordered for delivery as a real, packaged set. Users can also take "screenshots" of their models and store the models on their computer in a .LDD File

The Lego Digital Designer is considered an exemplary model of a customer toolkit that is used to facilitate user-innovation in New Product Development.


Brick Pricing

In 2009, brick prices increased considerably â€” in some cases by over 200% â€” to the dismay of many fans; shortly thereafter, however, prices were reduced, effectively decreasing the amount of the original increase.

Some fans have also complained that the prices for the bricks available through Lego Digital Design and through Lego "Pick a Brick" PAB prices do not always match, even for the same piece.
 
Features

Only a subset of the bricks made by Lego are available for use in LDD; for those bricks that are available for use with LDD at any given time, there is no guarantee that they will be available ad infinitum. The brick connection feature of LDD is unique among Lego design software applications. LDD can generate build instructions automatically.
