,need5,2011-08-09T23:57Z,"when you downloaded this torrent there were 8 files.In one of them there was something called 'speed'.In simple words that 'speed' thing is known as crack.What you have do is copy this 'speed' and go to the folder where you have installed the game paste it over there,when you click paste it would ask you to replace just replace it and finish.When you start the game it won't ask again.And for LaggerGuy try downloading a different crack from the internet and replace it and finish"
