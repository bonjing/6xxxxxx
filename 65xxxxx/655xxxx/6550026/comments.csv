,TridenTBoy,2011-08-02T04:21Z,"Horrible. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Most tracks have incorrect artist, track, or album information. You'd have to go through all 500 songs to get it right. Very annoyed that I even wasted bandwidth on this.

Bad quality"
,bushwhacker,2011-08-06T20:33Z,"This is the best compilation I've ever seen.  However some were 108db and some were as low as 87db.  You would have to keep adjusting the volume to listen to them.  I used MP3Gain (available on the internet) to smooth them all out to 90db.

Great upload!"
,bushwhacker,2011-08-06T20:57Z,Excellent compilation.  However some are 108db and some are as low as 87db.  I had to use MP3Gain (available on the iternet) to smooth them out to 90db so I didn't have to play with the volume for each track. 
,TechnoDude94,2011-08-10T13:10Z,"Does this album have cover art, titles, artists and album info?"
,daboyz1,2011-08-10T20:39Z,"Could it get any more white washed?  I know NWA and GM Flash are in there, but 50 songs by Bob Dylan & The Beatles.....REALLY?  "
