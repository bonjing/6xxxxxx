This program recycled the CG animation models from Clash of the Dinosaurs, but to cut corners, used the Parasaurolophus model for Charonosaurus and the Deinonychus model for Saurornithoides. This inevitably lead to errors in the depiction of these animals.



* Side Note - The question has arose, why am i doing webripz versions of shows. Well its because of the following. 1 MP4's are a pretty standard format now for handhelds, and both flv and mp4 are easily streamed via website, so someone out there who would like shows like these for their sites can download and re-embed easily.
