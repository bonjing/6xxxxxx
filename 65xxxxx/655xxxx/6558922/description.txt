Did you know: Unions created the middle class, made workers safer, and helped blacks?

Actually, unions didn't. Free markets created the middle class, and the AFL's president, in support a law that protected union jobs, lamented that "colored labor is being sought to demoralize wage rates."

Did you know that FDR's New Deal solved the Great Depression?

Actually, it didn't. It's uncertainty, big spending, and regulation that prolonged the Depression. FDR's Treasury Secretary, Henry Morgenthau, admitted: "We have tried spending money. We are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work."

Did you know that Herbert Hoover made the Depression worse because as president...he did nothing? The Washington Post believes that. In 2008, the paper claimed GW Bush was "today's Herbert Hoover" because of his "dogged resistance to assisting anybody."

Actually, Hoover increased spending by 53.5% during his presidency. He signed bad big-government bills like the Davis-Bacon Act and the Smoot-Hawley Tariff. He started huge public works projects like the Hoover Dam. Hoover was a big spender -- like Obama.

So much of what we think we know...is wrong.
