This is a 1998 collaboration between kid606 and Lesser; the first half is by Lesser, and the second is by kid606. If you want the track listing and stuff, the discogs page is here:

Kid606's half is pretty early material, so if you were at all interested by "Don't Sweat the Technics" (I'm seeding that right now too if you wanted it) then this would be a smart download.

Lesser's side is very good as well; this is sort of my first Lesser album, so I don't really know what to compare it to. Just trust me, it's pretty cool.
