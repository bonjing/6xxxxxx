C4E\'s iXtreme Slim LT+ 1.9 in association with Team Jungle & Team Xecuter
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

World first backups for XBOX 360 Slim, no need for expensive emulators, flash fw for free!

- For all Liteon Drive models (0272 - which is an updated 9504, 0225 & 0401)
- Support for XGD3 originals
- Optimised rootkit code, ALL timings for realtime checks are same as original firmware

We have also included all the original firmwares (OFW) - as you can see there are 2 different 
version 0225\'s too. There is a new kind of calibration data at 1FF80 that is different in 
2 occurances (so far) so if you get a PLAY DVD error then you need to redump your original 
with the new upcoming JF and let that do its magic for you. 

FYI The other variation is the factory updated version, and this difference at 1FF80 was only 
discovered in the last week so bear with us as there may be more variations out there.

You know if you have a factory upgraded version if the label says 9504 but the fw is 0225 ;)

Included OFW files explained:

1. Orig-0272.bin - 0272 (Retail 9504 flashed to new dash over XBL)
2. Orig-0225.bin - Retail 0225
3. Orig-0225u.bin - Retail 9504 flashed at factory to 0225u ... big differences in sector 1FF00 (calibration data at 1FF80)
4. Orig-0401.bin - Retail 0401

Thanks go to Team Jungle for their hard work and efforts in the development process.
Thanks as always go to Team Xecuter for their generous support to this whole project. 

Special thanks go to Foundmy.com for their help with the 0401 drives and the factory updated 0225 drives !
