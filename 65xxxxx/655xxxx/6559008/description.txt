Notes:i have had this easily 13 years now...person i traded with was from london
      and it was an actual tape trade, which is kinda rare these day's...
      but that is how i used trade even before web...good time's !
      his copy was a copy direct copy from roger...and  the best thing about this
      it's a new transfer for the web ! i have seen & heard all the other lossy
      and lossless copy's and all the same...very bad degraded quality....
      also this is getting hard to find in lossless due too mp3 clown's....
      but no worry's here i & i shall bury dem with this wicked version...
      i have not remastered nor done no cleaning fixing, zero !
      that is how good it sounds to i & i. this took while to do...
      transferring and making sure all my springs are in league ready for share *
      i have finished, hence your reading me now.
