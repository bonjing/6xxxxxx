Release Title Ironclad 2011 720p BRRip H264 AAC-GreatMagician (Kingdom-Release)
Directed By: Jonathan English
Tagline It is the year 1215 and the rebel barons of England have forced their despised King John to
put his royal seal to the Magna Carta, a noble, seminal document that upheld the rights of
free-men. Yet within months of pledging himself to the great charter, the King reneged on
his word and assembled a mercenary army on the south coast of England with the intention
of bringing the barons and the country back under his tyrannical rule. Barring his way stood
the mighty Rochester castle, a place that would become the symbol of the rebel's
momentous struggle for justice and freedom.
