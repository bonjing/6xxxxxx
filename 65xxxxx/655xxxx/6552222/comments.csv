Comeon, guys -- if it's worth your time and disk space to download, don't you think it's only right that you return the favor for the next guy down the road?  (Most especially since the file was just uploaded today.  Y'all were too lazy and selfish to even seed it for a bloody *day*?

I know I'm an old fart from the 19th century -- that's how I was raised, anyhow -- but what on earth has happened to simple manners and common courtesy?  You leechers were given the opportunity to collect a gift, and now that you've gotten yours, to hell with everyone else?  That's just pathetic.  

Since this is such a (for me, anyhow) large file, I'll seed it for a full month, rather than just my usual two weeks.

Thank you, Anonymous.  I speak 12 languages, 7 of them fluently, and have wanted to add Portuguese to the ""just starting out"" list for some time.  I really appreciate your taking the time to  offer this to us! "

We are in the same boat and it seems that we think alike....

I speak Portuguese, and my advice to you is to use Pimsleurs courses to learn new languages. The only problem with Pimsleur is that they teach Brazilian Portuguese (30 lessons) and Portugal Portuguese in only 10. In a way, these are two different languages..."

,robbiemonster,2012-04-18T12:30Z,"Well said mrsjab.

I recommend the Michel Thomas Method Tapes for learning almost any language. I like to put them on and head out for a jog, I find I run further because I'm too engrossed in learning to feel the pain! The Portuguese recordings seem to fall slightly short of the usual standards but for a minimal investment in time you'll have a basis of Portuguese to start to build on. "
