From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with author, journalist and researcher Webster Tarpley about Libya and Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi's regret over the bombing of the north African country and his desire to get out of the NATO plan to overthrow or kill Gaddafi. Tarpley is the author of Obama: The Postmodern Coup - Making of a Manchurian Candidate, 9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA and other titles. 

Alex also talks with Tony Gosling, a journalist and the man behind the website www. bilderberg.org, and James Corbett, an independent journalist who produces The Corbett Report, an online multi-media news and information source. 

Alex also covers the latest news -- including the suspicious murder of a whistleblower in the Murdoch hacking case....

Today's broadcast went five minutes into a 4th hour.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
