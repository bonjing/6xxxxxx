From the dust jacket, ""Clive Cussler's reputation as a master storyteller has been confirmed by such best-selling successes asRaise the Titanic and Night Probe. In Deep Six he has surpassed himself with a brilliant and timely novel that pits his hero, Dirk Pitt"", against the sinister and monstrous plan of a great Asian shipping family - only to find that behind it is an even deeper and more dangerous Soviet plot to turn the President of the United States to their own designs by means of mind control. Deep Six is full of action, like all Cussler's best sellers, but beyond the action is a plot so fast-paced, taut and highly charged that the reader is left breathless, whether it's at the mystery of a sunken ship with no name that unleashes a deadly tide of poison into the ocean waters, or the disappearance of the President of the United States on board his own yacht in the Potomac River, or the search for some of the most senior figures in the United States Government on board a soviet cruise ship on the high seas ...Like James Bond, Dirk Pitt is a swashbuckling adventurer, with a taste for the ladies and a way with violence - but in Deep Six, as in his other novels, Cussler has created a novel of compelling originality and rich detail that remains totally believable, with a huge cast of characters and a plot that takes the reader from the bottom of the sea to the most secret byways of power in Washington and Moscow. Deep Six is grand adventure and major fiction."""
