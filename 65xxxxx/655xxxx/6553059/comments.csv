Quality does not suffer a great deal if i compress with ripbot ! if you find original copy just check with this one ! d original print is also not up to the mark ! Bollywood / Tollywood  makings are done by poor quality camera comparing with Hollywood ! see d following pic quality ( also with compression ) :---

All depends on beta cam / high resolution cam ! if you eagerly think about quality then i would say a 700 / 1400  file also be compressed !"
