,TaxiDriverTNT,2011-07-23T16:24Z,"@Smileeeeeeee: It's not a very polite behaviour to spam on other people releases. If someone wants to download your work they'll do it anyway, you don't have to post advertisements all over the website. Btw your discography is NOT @ 320 Kbps."
,Smileeeeeeee,2011-07-29T02:52Z,"i never said it was @ 320 kbps as 192 kbps is  sufficient. and i only added a link as there are a few albums in my Discography that are not in yours

,namshub,2011-10-17T18:09Z,"I love the irony in some snippy little douchebag telling people not to 'cry like little bitches' and 'grow up' who then goes on to whine like a whipped bitch about an artist whose music he doesn't like.

Do you feel the need to make comments about every artist you don't like? Didn't mommy give you enough attention when you were shitting in diapers? Did daddy never hug you? Do you still wet the bed at night?

There's a reason why there's nobody in your army. The only whimpering little bitch is you, @myarmyofnone."
,glynpel,2011-10-24T14:29Z,Just want to thank you TaxiDriverTNT.

,herakapera,2011-12-22T20:28Z,"@myarmyofnone 

if you found a reason to hate tupac then you are one genius guy. But in the future show some respect to the dead. Hate him or love him but tupac earnt respect for life.

,iburnswishers,2012-01-23T07:12Z,"@myarmyofnone

first of all tupac was the best rapper ever. if u don't like pac then u dont like rap or your a new yorker. he wasnt just a rapper, he also wrote poetry and if u heard some of it u wouldnt know the difference from any other famous poet. hope u keep your comments online cause if u said that shit in front of the wrong mother fucker like me u might get smoked or beat to death. stay in the burbs where its safe pussy fagat!!!

Grab the studio albums from here because its better quality from the ones from my torrent, but grab the non studio releases from my torrent . thanks"
