There is a new broom at Scotland Yard: Nimrod Frost. His first "little job" for Lestrade is to investigate the reported appearance of a lion in Cornwall. Hardly a task for an Inspector. Yet even as Lestrade questions a witness a man is reported dead, horrifically mauled. Having solved that case to his own satisfaction, Lestrade returns to London and more suspicious deaths.... All old men who should have died quietly in their sleep: is there a connection? Lestrade's superiors, especially Nimrod Frost, discount his speculations and he finds himself suspended from duty, but that is a mere technicality. He moves from workhouse to royal palace, from back stage at the Lyceum to regimental dinner in his search for enlightenment.
