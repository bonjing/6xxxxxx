,HerrNiIsson,2011-07-25T19:38Z,"Thank you, but people should now that this is not a true full HD movie. Because Koyaanisqatsi has not been released in Bluray full HD yet. So this is a HDTV-rip that has been upscaled to 1080i. I'm not saying that the quality is bad, the quality is actually very good. But it is not true full HD. But even if this is not true full HD I think you should download this anyway because the quality is great. Then we can all hope that this movie gets released in true HD bluray 1080p."
,dahaunted,2011-07-26T15:30Z,"No, HDTV can be 1080i / 1080p or 720p.
It doesn't have to be upscaled. This is full HD, just not Blu-Ray source. Get your facts straight."
[T],insinuendo,2011-07-28T23:52Z,Precisely :)
,HerrNiIsson,2011-08-11T01:20Z,"@dahaunted The channel that showed this movie did upscale it to 1080p. This is 1080p, but the real movie is not 1080p. I just think that this is missleading because people think they will see Koyaanisqatsi in some kind of ""Avatar-quality"" then get disappointed when they don't."
,ethermanous,2011-09-24T17:10Z,"Hey insinuendo. Can you please upload a couple screenshots? Thanks. By the way, I never thought I'd get to see this film in a better resolution than what the DVD5 has to offer. So thank you so much!"
,kentajalli,2011-11-11T18:03Z,"Actually HerrNiIsson is more correct than all of you.
The footage, here is 1080i. but it is not standard HDV broadcast since it is 1920x1080i - HDV signals are actually 1440x1080i but the cable box - Tivo whatever, upscales them to 1920x1080i to be compatible with HD TV's.
The footage here is probably the best copy of Koya, that I have seen, but in reality it is at best a 720p copy upscaled.
HerrNiIsson is also correct that no true HD version of this movie exists , at least to the public.
I am re-encoding this copy, with noise filters and colour corrections at 720p.
when it is ready I shall upload it."

Any progress here?  We're all waiting for the improved version !
Thanks in advance"
,tommitytom,2012-02-06T21:09Z,"It is true that no HD version of this film exists - this is indeed upscaled.  Infact, this films native resolution is 4:3, so this rip is cropped, and half the picture is missing.  The best quality version of this film is available here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5256505/Koyaanisqatsi_(1982)_-_IRE_DVD_release__4_3_open_matte
and unless you are watching the 4:3 version it is DEFINITELY not watching this film how it was intended, as half the picture is missing!  For a comparison see here: http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDCompare2/koyaanisqatsi.htm"
,KKafka,2012-03-23T05:51Z,"OK, this is what you get: a 1920x1080, upscaled, cropped version of the original in 16:9 aspect ratio. The IRE version (there is a torrent here on PB) shows the full screen, as in the 1.33:1 theatrical version, at a smaller resolution (something like 720x540). Screen caps:
