Dragon Ball Z - Ultimate Battle 22

Developed by Bandai Co. - Infogrames (2003) - 2D Fighting - Rated Teen
Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Battle 22 was originally released for the PlayStation in Japan in 1995 with a European edition following two years later. The 2D fighter finally reaches the United States as the popularity of the animated show on which it's based continues to exhibit robust staying power into the early 2000s. Although the title suggests 22 playable characters, each with an arsenal of unique moves, kicks, spins, slashes, and specialties, an additional five bonus characters can be unlocked with one command, including Master Roshi, Kid Goku, Super Saiyan 3 Goku, Vegeto, and Mr. Hercule Satan.
