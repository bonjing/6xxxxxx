picture for less size possible then any user can ask : how you get the final size , what is the work ? i reduce the screen to a very 

common 320x240 that it is ok to use the fullscreen anyway and with this , less size and less time on the conversion but where i 

really get the improve of the size is on the bitrate reducing (just the bitrate) almost without any loss on the picture quality

PART 1 OF THIS COMMENT"
[V],globeplus,2011-07-19T15:04Z,"what means that with a normal nice converter the flv can be converted to a high-quality avi or mp4 for example giving to the user in not too much time the file with more quality in colors and with the clean of the picture in a nicer way than the original and getting like the more than 1 giga files that take too much time sometimes to download and almost impossible or very tough to slow net users and in the end is that the user get everything with better quality than the 1 giga files and only needs close 1 hundred mega to download ... this is pure creativity work making files , putting them more easy and pratical to the possible users ...

enjoy ...

[V],globeplus,2011-07-19T15:06Z,"MOVIE PLOT :

After giving Dobby a proper burial at Shell Cottage, Harry speaks with Griphook the Goblin about breaking into Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts bank, as Bellatrix's reaction suggested that a Horcrux may be there. Griphook agrees to take Harry, Ron, and Hermione to the vault in exchange for the goblin-made Sword of Gryffindor. Harry asks Ollivander, the wandmaker, to identify two wands they took from Malfoy Manor. Ollivander says they belonged to Bellatrix and Draco Malfoy, but Malfoy's wand has changed its allegiance to Harry.
 At Bellatrix's vault, Harry discovers the Horcrux, Helga Hufflepuff's Cup, despite curses placed on the vault contents, but Griphook takes the sword and abandons the students, as he did not agree to help them leave. The three release the dragon guardian of the vault and fly away. Harry looks into Voldemort's mind and learns that Voldemort has discovered the theft and killed many goblins in retaliation, including Griphook; the sword of Gryffindor disappeared. Voldemort keeps Naginiâ€“his snake and living Horcruxâ€“with him at all times for protection. Harry also learns there is a Horcrux at Hogwarts, in some way related to Rowena 

Ravenclaw."
