                            The Complete Series


The Shadow Line is a seven-part British television drama serial.

The series is about a murder investigated by both sides of the line â€“ cops and criminals â€“ and the opposing methods they use to solve it. But the real line is the morality within each character and how far they will go before they cross it.

Plot:

A man discovered shot to death in the back of a car is found to be Harvey Wratten, head of one of London's largest organized crime families, who had been released from jail hours earlier having received a royal pardon for undisclosed reasons. Investigating the murder is DI Jonah Gabriel, a detective in Scotland Yard's serious crimes division. Returning to work, he has no recollection of his last job which went terribly wrong as a result of a bullet lodged in his brain which killed his partner.

The death of Wratten results in one of his men, Joseph Bede being put forward reluctantly as the new boss of the drug smuggling operation. Bede sets out to find Wratten's killer whilst also trying to contact the cartel's money man, the mysterious Glickman, and has to contend with Harvey's psychotic nephew Jay.

We follow the investigations into the murder from both sides of the Shadow Line.
