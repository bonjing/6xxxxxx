    FINEST rip got bad.ivtc and stereo.for.mono ... ... our ivtc is done     
    by bobbing with srestore mode 4, and tdeint with various values ..       
    best that can get from this dvd. Normal decimate() just doesn't work.    
    And we did this only because got the disc around, and not willing to     
    pre a 70s bee-movie as dvdr...

    In the small town of Peckham, California, many men die for excessive     
    effort during sexual intercourse. When a scientist from the Brandt       
    research laboratory is found dead in a motel, the government sends       
    Agent Neil Agar (William Smith) to investigate the mysterious deaths.    
    He suspects that the deaths may be related to some experiments of Dr.    
    Susan Harris (Anitra Ford), who is researching bees in the Brandt        
    facility.
