Nice to see someone doing this size with AC3 sound. 

I am getting so tired of converting all my AAC multi-channel files so I can get multi-channel through optical to my receiver. Not to mention one more needless conversion to weaken sound quality."

,MaianMagus,2011-09-15T23:33Z,"This torrent is being watched. About a week after I downloaded it, Buckeye Express emailed me and said a complaint had been registered for downloading it. 

In my experience, Buckeye Express is the only ISP in Ohio that cares. I've had Time Warner, and never once heard anything from them for using torrents. So, if you live in NW Ohio, be careful of torrenting, or find some way to mask your identity.

Other than that, this file is absolutely perfect quality. Thanks Murdoc!"
