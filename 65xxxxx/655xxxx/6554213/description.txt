Nagoya - Day 10 2011
Welcome back Sumo fans!  After a long hiatus, we finally have Televised Coverage from NHK.  I have in this time, upgraded my PC and my ISP has also upgraded my service, which should get the seeding going great! (knock on wood, cross fingers, etc.)

Resolution:	720 x 480
Source:		Non-HD NTSC Cable source
Languages :	 Japanese and English
Processed through S-Cable and edited with Sony Vegas Pro 9.0 (once per language) and recoded to .AVI with Quick Media Converter 3.6.5  (again once per language) and finally combined with AviMux_GUI to create the dual language file.  
This process as you can guess, takes about ten hours to complete: so please be patient!  Iâ€™ll get â€˜er done!
