Sierra Nevada Mountains, 1887: William Drayton, once a crack sharpshooter 
in the Civil War, has lost his wife and home. He has ascended to the high 
country, wanting never to be heard from again. But someone is trying to 
find him -- a long-lost daughter, Elizabeth, whom Drayton thought had 
died long before. Meanwhile, banker-turned-robber baron Horace Scarsdale 
has mustered an army of cutthroats and guns for hire to help him build his 
railroad empire. When Drayton returns to civilization with his daughter 
and friends, he decided to make a stand against Scarsdale, his former 
employer. Against impossible odds, he faces down the vicious band of 
raiders that Scarsdale calls The Company Men.
