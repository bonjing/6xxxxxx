Movies HD is a movie catalog application with stunning graphics. It allows you to quickly add, find and view movies in your library (with the ability to add new movies by seeking by title using lots of data sources - so all movie details are filled in for you!). It also allows to lend movies to friends, so you can easily keep track of who you gave that copy of "Quantum of Solace" to.

Movies HD is the big brother of Movies - the ultimate iPhone/iPod Touch movies catalog.
