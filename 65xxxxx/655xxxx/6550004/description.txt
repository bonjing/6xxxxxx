What's in This Folder:

Krav Panim El Panim - KAPAP  is the Hebrew acronym for Face To Face Combat. It is the original combat system of CQB, hand-to-hand combat and self-defense, employed by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).

KAPAP fight tactics originated in the 1940's and were used by the Palmach (Jewish Strike Brigades) forces in fighting for the independence of the State of Israel. These Palmach units later formed the core of Israel's special units in the conventional military (IDF).

KAPAP ACADEMY was founded by Albert Timen who served in one of Israel's elite Counter Terror units. Due to constant reaserch in this field he and other Instructors had modified and upgraeded the system to fit legal aspects of civilian self defense, as well as becoming applicable by Law Enforcement , Military and Security operators worldwide. The Academy is based in the United States and serves as an International Instructional institute operating and represented in more than 20 countries by local Instructors certified by KAPAP ACADEMY.

KAPAP ACADEMY is staffed by former official Israeli Military and Police instructors in Counter Terror combatives (LOTAR). It is an â€œall combatâ€ system â€” a system totally dedicated to close combat and self-defense, with and without weapons. It has no sporting or competition aspect. Nor does it adhere to any classical/traditional school of thought.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.


RAPtURE (My transportation outta here).

The Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..

"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.

"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...

May Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.
