I'm new to this whole torrent thing. I'm good at downloading, but not uploading. I love your downloads, and you're one of the people that I trust downloads from. So, I was wondering if you would please help me out. I'm having an awful time getting my movies uploaded, and how do I make a ""torrent""? Please E-mail me. NaughtyGurl_1980@yahoo.com BTW! Great Movie! Great Quality! Love It Love It Love IT!!!!!!! :)"
