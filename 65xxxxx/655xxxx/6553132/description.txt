- British PM David Cameron, Media Mogul Rupert Murdoch Face U.K. Parliament on Phone Hacking Scandal

British Prime Minister David Cameron is facing questions from lawmakers today on his handling of the widening News International phone hacking scandal implicating the British police and top government officials. Cameron's appearance comes one day after an unprecedented hearing that saw media mogul Rupert Murdoch testify before British lawmakers for the first time. Murdoch expressed regret for what he called "sickening and horrible invasions" of privacy committed by his company, but refused to accept responsibility. His son, James Murdoch, and former News International executive Rebekah Brooks also testified.


- Murdoch's Denials Are Tough to Believe, Former Wall Street Journal Reporter Sarah Ellison Says

To discuss the phone hacking scandal engulfing the Rupert Murdoch media empire from Britain to the United States, we are joined by longtime journalist Sarah Ellison. She is a Vanity Fair contributing editor and author of the book, "War at the Wall Street Journal: Inside the Struggle to Control an American Business Empire," which chronicled the sweeping changes at the publication after Murdoch acquired the newspaper in 2007. Ellison spent 10 years working at the Wall Street Journal. Commenting on Murdoch denying responsibility for the scandal, Ellison says: "It is even more difficult to really believe that when you know the way that his news organizations work... There is a myth of Rupert Murdoch, that his editors know what he wants without him even having to tell him. He creates a culture where everyone is of a like mind. â€¦ It is difficult to imagine that some of the responsibility wouldn't lie [at] his feet given that it is his organization."


- Pakistani Journalist Shehrbano Taseer on Murder of Her Father, Salmann Taseer & Confronting Militancy in Pakistan

Shehrbano Taseer, a Newsweek journalist based in Pakistan, is the daughter of Salmaan Taseer, former governor of Punjab who was shot 29 times by his own bodyguard in January. Before his assassination, Taseer had became embroiled in controversy after he spoke out against the country's blasphemy law. Last November, a Pakistani Christian woman was sentenced to death after being found guilty of defaming the Prophet Muhammad. We speak with Shehrbano Taseer about her father and efforts to confront Islamist extremism throughout Pakistan. "Extremism is a mindset in Pakistan. You need to counter that mindset and provide a counter narrative. And that is not being done by America," Taseer says.
