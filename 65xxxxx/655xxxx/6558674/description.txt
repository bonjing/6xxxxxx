This is a collection of my favourite PSP Games, they are all CSOs (the smallest PSP game size possible, meaning you can get more on your memory stick) and I put them in 7zip rars to make the downloads smaller.

To play them you them you need to use 7zip or winrar to unrar them - both are free and can be found on google easily - then copy them to an ISO folder on the root of your PSPs memory stick. Of course, you will also need Custom Firmware on your PSP to play them. And away you go!.

Here is the list of games and the size of the CSOs:
Call of Duty Road to Victory 144mb
Exit 2 92.7mb
F1 2009 389mb
Fifa Street 2 219mb
Full Auto Battlelines 120mb
