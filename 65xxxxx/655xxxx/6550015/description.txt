Some Artists are a genre of their own (Steely Dan is one of them). In their honour I tried to make a kind of a musical portrait. Unfortunately these artists did proof their qualities for quite some time already and accordingly the sound quality is a bit less (but still barproof).

Sharing and seeding may help others (if you still want to help others). Enjoy and consider buying for true sound quality and support.
