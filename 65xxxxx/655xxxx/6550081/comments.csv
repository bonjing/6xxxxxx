1. Open USB Loader GX as usual
2. Click on the Wii Sports Resort game
3. Go to settings
4. Go to ""Game Load""
5. Scroll down to ""Alternate DOL"" and click it once
6. Go to the next option ""Select DOL Offset"" and click it
7. When it asks you if you wish to use the alternate DOL that is known to be correct, select yes
8. Go out of the settings and load the game as usual, watch the video, and you will probably be taken back to the System Menu (this is ok)
9. Go back to USB Loader GX, back to Wii Sports Resort, back to settings, and select ""Default Gamesettings""
10. It should work flawlessly now, and you will never have to go through this process again

Note: This method is very similar for other Wii Motion Plus games that require an alternate DOL initial boot-up, so simply follow the same instructions."
