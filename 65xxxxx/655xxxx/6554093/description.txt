Storyine: An unlucky in love girl meets the man of her dreams in a chance encounter. It doesnÃ¢Â€â„¢t take long before the couple are blissfully engaged and planning their wedding at the brideÃ¢Â€â„¢s family estate on MarthaÃ¢Â€â„¢s Vineyard. The union of the two families doesnÃ¢Â€â„¢t go quite as well as desired by the doting couple. The groomÃ¢Â€â„¢s traditional and passive-aggressive mother is resentful that this is the first time meeting the bride-to-be, and friction arises immediately between the two mothers. The obstacles presented by their very diverse families does not bode well for the bride and groom, who find themselves arguing as their wedding day quickly approaches.
