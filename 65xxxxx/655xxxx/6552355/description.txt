Director Uwe Boll set out to create a realistic and brutal film about what actually took place in the gas chambers during World War II in Auschwitz. The director was quoted as saying:Itâ€™s in the tradition of my movies Stoic, Darfur, Rampage, Tunnel Rats, Heart of Americaâ€¦it shows Auschwitz as what it was: a meat plant for humansâ€¦a death factory.
