Another couple hours job
Russian Video was very dark but also nice and had a some flickering.
Needed a complete makeover.
I had to find a base level for all scenes at daylight
I adjusted brightness,contrast,rgb and hsv 
i added a slight flicker removal and made a new project after that. Dark scenes just needed different additional tweaks so i had to cut the movie in 20 new parts and treat every part differently as needed.
Made a screenshot comparison where you can see what was changed

After i had a nice video i played a lot with that audiotrack. since there was no line around i had to work with the cam audio that was available.
Was already synced perfectly so no work was needed for that.
Cam audio had noise,hiss and sounded not that good. I Cleaned it up the usual way, but i wasnt satisfied. it got too dull and wasnt that understandable anymore. so i took a different approach which is now a lot better than the original.
Check sample.
All in all video is heaps better and looks brighter and stronger and better in colour,and you can see a lot more detail in the video without going over.
Audio is better now too, cant do more with that audiosource, still more than watchable till some better source comes around.
enjoy
