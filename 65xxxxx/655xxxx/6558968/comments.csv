I'll work up the line as long as you et al keep seeding it.

(also have to dump to dvd before next DL starts).

thanks"

,UncleO,2011-07-25T08:02Z,"When I wrote the above comment I didn't yet know that your incredible work (a team?) meant we could DL our choice of books, not the whole thing.

Not like that ""all the fiction"" guy where you have to take a whole year at minimum. (Lot's of great stuff there once you get a year; including npn-fiction.)"
,CaptnKidd,2011-07-26T06:41Z,"Heh, thanks UncleO, but no ""team"".  Just lil ol' me and about 4 years of doin 10 here, 20 there.  

However, after this the plan is to build a team.
