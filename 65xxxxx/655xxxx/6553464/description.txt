I love fellow Mizzou Tiger, Sheryl Crow. And today her concert Miles From Memphis: Live At
The Pantages Theatre .

Filmed in the Fall of 2010, the show captures the talented singer/songwriter / touring in
support of her 100 Miles From Memphis album / fronting a powerhouse 9 piece band that
swings through the best tracks from the record, and reinvigorates fan favorites with a soulful
Memphis flavor. And thereâ€™s a little Motown in the mix too, with Crowâ€™s 1994 megahit â€œAll I
Wanna Doâ€ extended with a jam on Marvin Gayeâ€™s classic â€œGot To Give It Upâ€, and a joyous
rendition of the Jackson 5's â€œI Want You Backâ€.

Opened in 1930, the Pantages Theatre is an art-deco masterpiece. Howard Hughes once
owned the venue, which hosted the Academy Awards from 1949-1959. This glamorous
Hollywood treasure provides a stunning backdrop for Crow and her band, The Thieves. â€œIt
was a very special night, playing with this incredible band in this wonderful venue, and Iâ€™m so
happy to be able to share it with all my fans around the world,â€ said Sheryl Crow.
