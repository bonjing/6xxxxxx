Zatanna #15 [DC]

Written by PAUL DINI; Art by JAMAL IGLE and JON SIBAL; Cover by ADAM HUGHES

The long-simmering rivalry between Zatanna and The Spectre ignites in this issue! 
In an infernal courtroom beneath Alcatraz Prison, the Maid of Magic is on trial 
for her life, with the vengeful Spectre determined to find her just as guilty as 
the mystic criminals she fights. Will even Zatanna's powers be enough to save her 
from God's wrath?
