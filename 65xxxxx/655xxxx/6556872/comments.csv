[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-09-06T02:58Z,that is cause u guys are joining through internet. make sure ur searching servers on lan and typing ip under lan only. not internet. LAN only lol i had same troubles when i was creating this torrent but figured it out in a few moments.
,vikkymaxx,2011-09-11T11:43Z,The game works fine....But i'm unable to play it online it says the the CD KEY & the ROE KEY is invalid....please help. Thanks
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-09-23T21:15Z,"i never said it was to be played online, only lan"
,Hollow Chest,2011-10-06T03:34Z,I can't change resolution because every time i start the game the settings are back to default. Also I can't get mods to be detected.
,Hollow Chest,2011-10-06T03:39Z,nevermind
,RebeccaTehRotten,2011-10-07T08:14Z,"Every time I'm looking for a certain thing to download, you somehow upload it the day after I was looking! I meant to post this a while ago but I didn't have an account then"

,type_trap61,2011-11-30T20:13Z,im having a little bit of a problem. i got 7-zip and extracted the doom file then clicked on the doom3.exe. after i clicked on the exe.... it brought up a blue screened box saying it couldnt be started. i added you on xfire.... now im just waiting for your respons. i have a nividia 9800 1gig card so i know thats not the problem. please contact me at jdasstraight@yahoo.com if you can. otherwise.... look on your xfire. should be a person named typetrap61
,u_k_d,2011-12-01T16:38Z,"Problem. I downloaded, extracted and ran doom3.exe, and a grey screen pops up. Everything else seems to be working fine (sound etc), but the display is completely grey. I've tried hitting Alt+Enter to use windowed mode, but the window is also grey. Any idea how to fix this?

Specs: Windows 7 x64
Intel G31/33 graphics (no dedicated graphics card, but it's supposed to support Doom3)
C2d 2.5 4GB RAM 500GB HDD."
,u_k_d,2011-12-01T16:39Z,"I have also updated my graphics and chipset drivers to the latest version, still no cookie. Anybody know how to make this work?"
,Sploder,2011-12-24T00:12Z,This version lags horribly on my computer and my HD6790 can definitely handle it. If you're using 64bit windows it'll probably be the same on yours.
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-12-24T01:00Z,"im on 64 bit windows 7 home prem, works just fine, also have 2 pc's on 32 bit xp...also works just fine on both, b4 i upload anything i do test it. must be a drivers thing, or ur card just isnt compatible with the game. not the torrent and defo not the operating system.

also keep in mind cards arent the only thing needed to be powerful enough to run a game, cpu, ram, etc. also defrag ur pc..."
,amortha,2012-01-16T09:09Z,"For my friend, the OpenCo-op lags abd glitches really bad, uses up almost all of his CPU. He changed the compatibility to XP SP3, and it worked just fine for a few days. now it doesnt work again, doing the same laggy graphical problems. PLEASE HELP!"
,planestake,2012-03-07T21:09Z,Hey thanks for a great upload. everything's running as it should except that all the lettering in the menu screens is completely blurred out and I cant read it! Anybody have a fix for this? thanks again
,Hyegun,2012-04-07T22:04Z,"When i try to play with Windows 7 on lan..how it works? both on same hamachi/doom 3 version, and seen or enter on games.. :/ any help?"
,Hyegun,2012-04-07T22:07Z,and can't see or enter on games* 
,normanmcginnisjr,2012-04-11T04:31Z,i downloaded doom 3 and redurrection of evil 1.3.1 and open coop and it tells me when i try to play it that the cfg file is missing what do i do
,normanmcginnisjr,2012-04-11T04:38Z,and it wont let me go past doom 3 exe it says the cfg file is missing can u plz tell me what to do
,akshope,2012-04-21T13:16Z,"For those who are having trouble with the blurred pixeled menu screen
its because ur graphic card is either insufficient or it set in performance mode.
i have an intel hd integrated graphic card
all i did was change its 3d settings to quality insted of performance"
