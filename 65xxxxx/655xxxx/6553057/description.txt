http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106578/

a.k.a. Class of '61 (1993)

Optional subtitles in separate idx/sub files (Work in Windows Media Player etc., see enclosed Note): 
Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish.

With very young Clive Owen, Josh Lucas, Laura Linney, Dan Futterman and Christien Anholt.

A group of West Point 1861 cadets and friends go on opposite sides after the breakout of The American Civil War. This is one of the first films by all the promising actors, and it's a scandal that it has never been released on DVD in the U.S. Only 162 people have had a chance to vote on IMDB.

This film has been on my most wanted list for years, until I recently discovered a very rare Nordic DVD edition. So I want to share it because it has not been available elsewhere. 

Original fullscreen, DVDrip XviD 2-pass 608x432, good stereo sound AC3.
Synch tested, runs well in both my standalone DivX players.

Please note that the original DVD has a slightly blurred picture, which is necessarily reflected in my rip.
