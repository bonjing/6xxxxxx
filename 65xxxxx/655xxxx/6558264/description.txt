Live in Gdansk is a live album by David Gilmour. It is a part of his On an Island project which
includes an album, tour, DVD, and live album. It was released on 22 September 2008. A
David Gilmour Signature Series Fender Stratocaster was released at the same time.

It is a recording of the final show of his On an Island tour in 2006, where he played to an
audience of 50,000 at the Gdansk Shipyard to celebrate the founding of the Solidarity trade
union.

The show featured the song A Great Day for Freedom, which appears on Pink Floyd's final
studio album The Division Bell from 1994. It was last performed by Gilmour during his semiacoustic
shows in 2002.

It's also the final Pink Floyd-related recording to feature the late Richard Wright, who died on
September 15, 2008, one week before the album's official release.
Gilmour and his band were backed by the Polish Baltic Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by
Zbigniew Preisner and Leszek Mozdzer on piano.

The album debuted at #10 on the UK Album chart and debuted at #26 on the US Billboard
album chart.
