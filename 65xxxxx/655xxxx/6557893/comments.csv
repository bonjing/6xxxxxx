,Rimwich,2011-07-23T00:10Z,So ya I did this update and now my CIV won't open. I think the last step you have is worded incorrectly cause that messed up my whole install.
,opiatius,2011-07-23T11:45Z,"lol i think he meant overwrite the original files with the files in the ""spy"" folder"
,numaru7,2011-07-23T12:18Z,"yes, you need to overwrite the files int he game folder with the ones from the SPY folder. Btw, it works fine, and i didn't use the skidrow update 7."
,NickShevy,2011-08-06T21:22Z,"I installed this update, but now when after I click on one of the launchers in the program file, it opens up the Civ window, but won't show the opening movie, and freezes up. I installed the skidrow update 7 prior to installing this one. Help?"
,Weho2,2011-08-12T21:57Z,"Hi, can you please upload and crack 1.0.1.383, pleasee :)"
,TempDude29,2011-08-24T18:52Z,"This update works great (installed update 7 first then this one), thanks!"
,zyanizzy,2011-08-25T17:12Z,"thanx, its works"
,lobo345,2011-08-29T22:13Z,Looking for 383 version too.
,aetharr,2011-08-30T17:33Z,"For some reason, this does not work on my copy of Civ V. I used SKiDROW's Original Install, then Update 1, 2, 3-5, 6 and 7 before using this one.

All that happens for me, is it plays the intro videos, then does nothing else. I wonder if the cracked exes do not work? (i did only use the DX9 one)

I did even try installing only the base game, then ONLY update 7 before this patch, and that didn't work either."
,aetharr,2011-08-30T18:00Z,"Ok, Now I have no idea what to say... On my Other computer, it works perfectly..."
,sneipen6,2011-09-10T17:15Z,"Works! Thanks allot.

Does anybody know if this is working with this DLC?

,erikieperikie,2011-10-31T17:56Z,"I haven't tried it, because I don't know what exact steps it would take me to do (and I don't want to completely reinstall CivV), but what's the difference with the following download?
