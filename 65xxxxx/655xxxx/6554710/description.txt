 After waiting for almost half a decade for Tally Hall's second LP to come out, the time has finally arrived. From the same band that has a repertoire for silly and wonky songs, comes an album that is, if nothing else, a logical succession to their freshman release Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum. From haunting melodies, to deep and thoughtful lyrical work, this album is sure to deliver a musical experience not heard in modern music. 

To start out with the art direction from Joe Hawley, the simplicity of the album's case and books supplied create a mood for your mind to be in, upon loading the album up. The opening track Never Meant To Know introduces to the core fundamentals of the band's sound, with catching melodies, finely executed harmonies, and lyrics that drive you back to listen to the song again, because they are far too catchy. 

Every song on the entire album, with perhaps the logical exception of A Lady ( which only comes in at just over a minute ), could easily be a radio single. Which goes to show the fine tuning and care taken for each individual track. Everything has it's place, and nothing is forgotten; and moreso, like any good album, the more you listen to it, the more you pick up on. 

By far and large, one of the best albums of the decade, even surpassing Tally Hall's first LP, which was not an easy feat to accomplish! So please, if you are even considering this album at all, do yourself a favor and delve into the world of the band that says they are "wonky rock" and enjoy your stay!
