        The Master arrives  on Earth at  a circus run  by a man  named
        Rossini  and  steals  a dormant  Nestene  energy  unit from  a
        museum. He reactivates it using a radio telescope and uses his
        hypnotic abilities to  take control of  a small plastics  firm
        run by the Farrel family, where he organises the production of
        deadly Auton dolls, chairs and daffodils.

        Humanoid Auton dummies distribute the daffodils - designed  to
        spray a suffocating plastic film over their victim's mouth and
        nose - by giving them away free to members of the public in  a
        fake promotional campaign.

        The Master plans  to activate the  flowers with a  signal from
        the radio telescope, which he will then use to bring the  main
        Nestene Consciousness to Earth. The Doctor manages to persuade
        the Master that the Nestenes will have no further use for  him
        once they  arrive. The  two Time  Lords then  work together to
        send the Consciousness back into space.

        Season 8, Episode 1: Terror of the Autons Part 1

        Jo Grant, having been hypnotised by the Master, tries to  open
        a metal box that has been brought into the lab at UNIT HQ. The
