How does the Earth work? Richard Hammond goes to go to the centre of the planet to find out. Using a giant 3D virtual Earth, Richard peels back the layers and shows where volcanoes come from, why earthquakes happen and even where to find diamonds.

Using stunning CGI, the latest satellite imagery and beautiful locations around the world, the story of how the Earth works has never been seen like this before. And in Richard Hammond's hands it is a story that has never told like this either!
