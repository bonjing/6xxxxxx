The Lizard (Persian: Ù…Ø§Ø±Ù…ÙˆÙ„Ú© , Marmoulak) is a 2004 Iranian comedy directed by Kamal Tabrizi.

Although a comedy, the film makes serious points about the clergy, religion, society in Iran, and life in general. Due to the film's perceived attacks towards clerics, the movie was banned from theatres in Iran after only being on screen for one month. Yet despite this short run, the film broke all Iranian movie box office records and was the top grossing Iranian movie of all time until Tahmineh Milani's 'Atash Bas (Cease-fire)'.

Plot:
Reza Marmoulak, the main character, is a petty thief known in criminal circles for his ability to scale the walls of buildings (from which he derives his name, "Marmoulak", or "lizard" in Persian). He escapes jail by posing as a mullah. When he has to stay in disguise longer than he expected, he accidentally becomes the revered leader of a small-town mosque, bringing people flooding in with his on the hoof sermons featuring sexual innuendo and references to 'brother' Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.
