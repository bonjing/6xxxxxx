,feartruth,2011-07-22T17:58Z,"Couldn't agree more with klhelst.

sweets110, if you don't have any sense, borrow some. Okay, I understand that you're desperate for some movies, but coming up with a list of movies is idiotic. Users like you are the reason that the uploaders tend not to respond to anyone (fearing that doing so would encourage people like you to come up with a heap load of requests). At times, this even leads to the uploaders ignoring to read any comment for their releases in the future forever."
,iverman,2011-07-23T01:17Z,Any comments on A & V ? 
,pxpierre,2011-07-23T05:23Z,"Thank you SaM & seeders!

What's up with all the dummys making off topic requests?

It's a thread about SaM's Stake Land torrent."

,ciroa,2011-07-24T01:31Z,"Thanks, Sam. Very good encoding. The movie is certainly, horror. A horror. Not your fault, of course, so thanks again. At least I remembered why I don't watch horror movies. So, A=10, V=10, M=0"
,deadroleguy,2011-07-24T07:16Z,requesting for shitty indian movies?
,skeelol,2011-07-24T11:17Z,"Lol @ciroa....next thing you know you'll be saying you aren't a faggot then running out and sucking a bunch of cocks.

A:10
V:9

Decent movie, not just typical end of the world slash and hack horror, actually has some substance to it.
