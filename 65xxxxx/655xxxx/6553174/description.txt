Here is a first listen of Kelly Rowlandâ€™s highly anticipated 3rd album â€œHere I Amâ€ due to be released on July 26, 2011. The album features productions by Jim Jonsin, Dr. Luke, Stargate, Ne-Yo, RedOne, David Guetta just to name a few and features Big Sean, Lil Wayne, Rico Love, David Guetta and Lil Playy. After listening to her album, I can tell you that I like it much more than BeyoncÃ©â€™s â€œ4â€³.
Highlights: â€œIâ€™m Dat Chickâ€, â€œWork It Manâ€, â€œMotivationâ€, â€œLay It On Meâ€, â€œFeelin Me Right Nowâ€, â€œTurn It Upâ€, â€œAll of the Nightâ€.
