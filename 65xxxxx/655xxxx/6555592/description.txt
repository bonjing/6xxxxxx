Introduction
=============

The Islamic Aqeedah (faith) is as essential for man as air and water.

Without this Aqeedah, he is lost and confused. Who is our Creator? What are His Names and Attributes?

Why did He create us? What is our relationship to the Creator? Who are Angels? What is their role in human life?

How should we believe in the Angels? What was the message of all the Prophet and Messengers?

What happens after death? What are the signs of the Hour? What does it mean to believe in Predestination?

Is everything including the actions of the slaves pre-decreed by Allah? Does man have freedom of choice?

Only by studying the Aqeedah based purely upon the Quran and the Sunnah can one correctly answer these

essential questions. The Prophet (sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam) said, "Knowledge is acquired by studying."

[Silsilatul-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah]
