 The surprisingly successful book Real World Java EE Patternsâ€“Rethinking Best Practices discusses the rethinking of legacy J2EE patterns. Now, Real World Java EE Night Hacksâ€“Dissecting the Business Tier walks you through the Java EE 6 best practices and patterns used to create a real world application called â€œx-ray.â€ X-ray is a high-performance blog statistics application built with nothing but vanilla Java EE 6 leveraging the synergies between the JAX-RS, EJB 3.1, JPA 2, and CDI 1.0 APIs. Topics covered include:

 A brief introduction into the core principles of Java EE 6 (EJB 3.1, CDI, JPA, JTA,Dependency Injection, Convention over Configuration, interceptors, transactions, REST) using real world code
Unit and integration testing of Java EE 6 applications using JUnit and ScalaTest
Using interceptors for performance measuring and monitoring
Creating mocks with Mockito for EJB 3.1, CDI, JPA, and JAX-RS
Developing embedded integration tests with Arquillian
Productive use of JAX-RS, Contexts and Dependency Injection, EJB 3.1, and JPA
RESTful services and REST clients with Java EE 6
Convention over Configuration with Java EE 6
Effective component configuration with CDI and Convention over Configuration
Plug-in implementation with CDI
Transactional pub/sub without JMS based on CDI and EJB 3.1
Continuous integration with Maven 3, Mercurial/Git, and Hudson/Jenkins
Implementing configurable timers and asynchronous batch processing
Eventual consistency and high-performance deferred writes with Java EE 6
Real-time client and server monitoring with JMX and REST
Functional testing with FitNesse
Performing stress and load tests
Simplest possible, but maintainable, Java EE 6 design and architecture
Real World Java EE Night Hacks â€“ Dissecting the Business Tier will benefit experienced developers and architects interested in code, not PowerPoint slides.
