"Connecting the Anthrax Attacks to September 11th"

with Dr. Graeme MacQueen.


Forewarning of the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2000 and 2001; three different approaches to understanding the anthrax attacks of 2001: structural, historical and symbolic; the lone nut theory of perpetrators; connections between the anthrax attacks and the so-called 9/11 hijackers in Florida; Operation Dark Winter; the attempt to disconnect anthrax from 9/11; Mohamed Atta asks for a loan. 





================================================

"Guns & Butter" investigates the relationships among capitalism, militarism and politics. Maintaining a radical perspective in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, "Guns & Butter: The Economics of Politics" reports on who wins and who loses when the economic resources of civil society are diverted toward global corporatization, war, and the furtherance of a national security state.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
