It workes perfect on my tomtom xl 30 series, together with the map Western_and_Central_Europe_2GB_860_3110."

You need to activate the map, in order to utilize it on your TomTom device.
Use the activation tool 'Easy Activator'. You can download it from:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5786989/Albert_s_Easy_Activator_v0.57.21

The Easy Activator takes you step-by-step through the process of activating
the map. 

For the activation process a map-specific meta code is needed.
With a text editor, for instance the Windows Editor, generate a new
file and insert the meta code into this file and save the file as 'meta.txt'.

I would recommend to make a full backup of the files on your TT device, 
before activating the map."
