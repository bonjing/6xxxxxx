Sparrow is a minimalist mail application for Mac. It was designed to keep things simple and efficient. No fancy stuff here... just your mail and nothing else.

Threads Quickly flick through threaded conversations on your mac like never before.

Not so minimalâ€¦ See your mails the way you want. Quickly glance at the preview. Read it in a new window or open the right pane to enjoy Sparrow's full potential.

Notifications Growl is integrated for notifications addicts.

Multiple Accounts Seamlessly switch between your mail accounts.

What's next? Sparrow will soon support several IMAP email providers and integrate labels for Gmail users.

New features:

* Extended Sidebar: directly access all your label & folders in the sidebar

* Send & Archive: one of the coolest Gmail feature now available for all
  IMAP accounts (Shift-Alt-D)

* Drag and Drop: select any message and simply drag and drop it to
  other apps and your desktop

* Hide sidebar: keep it minimal and hide your sidebar for a streamlined
  experience. Shit-Cmd-M or a lateral three finger swipe in the sidebar
  will do the trick.

* 'Empty trash' button

* View mail source

For Lion OS X users:

* Bounce everywhere: in the sidebar, in the message list and in the
  conversation view. Lion goodness all over!

Improvements:

* All animations have been rewritten from the ground up.

* Sidebar animations: account and category switching is faster and
  smoother

* Message list: we made the scroll more fluid and natural

* Window animations: we killed all window animations to make
  Sparrow faster and simpler

* Sidebar scrollbar: it was always possible to scroll the sidebar but we
  made this obvious by adding a scrollbar when you can actually scroll.

* Priority inbox behavior: now shows all Priority mails of the inbox
  regardless of the fact that they've been read

Compatibility:

* Omnifocus: drag a mail in the app to create a new task

* Things: drag a mail on the dock icon to create a new task

Back-end:

* Yahoo compatibility

* DAV Mail compatibility

* MBox mail compatibility 
  and of course, hundreds of small bugs have been resolved.

System Requirements: 

OS version: Mac OS X 10.5 or later
