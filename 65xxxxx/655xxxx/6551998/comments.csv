This version kind of sucks - but I'll leave it up and let you guys decide, I'm going back to version 1.2.2 until they fix this version or update it.

So it's just like downloading the official Lite version from the Mac App Store, making this torrent a bit pointless since you can download the official lite version (which is also obviously free) from the Mac App Store or the app's homepage."
