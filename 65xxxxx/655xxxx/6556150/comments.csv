V - Good

M - Considering that ""I am number two"" have been on TPB top 100 for weeks on end and currently have a IMDB rating of 6.2 I didn't exactly expect much. 20min in to the  movie all the cliches was there for epic music videoish, non-substance non-sens I did expect. However it actually delivers. The acting could have been a bit better but the story and cinematography totally makes up for it. DO WATCH!

Thanx man!"
