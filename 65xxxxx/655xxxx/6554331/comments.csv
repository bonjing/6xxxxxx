[T],gmaxwell_,2011-07-21T09:36Z,"Unfortunately this torrent file was created with a rather poor selection of trackers and pirate bay won't let me change it or upload another version.

If it's not working well for you, try the torrent at http://www.btghost.com/link/89818739/ which is the same swarm but it just has more configured trackers."
,4Anarchy,2011-07-21T14:09Z,Can someone upload this to scribd and Archive.org to make every single entry easy to find by searchengines like google ?
,lxsl,2011-07-21T15:54Z,These are the actions of a hero. I am so seeding this.
[T],torrentshredder,2011-07-21T16:16Z,"trackers doesnt matter as long you didnt create your torrent as a private torrent making it necessary to use just any kind of tracker address.

if your torrent is not private but public, then torrent software will also use decentralized means to find and share bits, aka dht networks and not just tracker network.

so how did you create your torrent?
recreate the torrent as public if you have made a mistake in the first place and re-share it.

simple as that."
[T],torrentshredder,2011-07-21T16:21Z,"update:

torrenteditor.com says your torrent is not private, so no big deal. torrent clients will find other peers themselves even with just a single tracker or all being offline.

ppl can manually add more and more trackers as they wish, but it all doesnt matter at all.

decentralized tracking is available already. you have created your torrent properly to make it as a public torrent.


never create private torrents. that doesnt make any sense at all in terms of lifetime and availability."
,4Anarchy,2011-07-21T16:22Z,"Ok, will try to upload this to Archive.org and Scribd to make it esay to find using google. Might take some months to do so with my slow home connection and using TOR (dont want to get sued by this asholes for sharing free Data)."

,sirspamlost,2011-07-21T18:10Z,"Mr. Maxwell, I applaud you.

I have often myself run into the pay walls of JSTOR, Sage, Springer and the like (most universities can not afford to subscribe to all journals).
I am therefore well acquainted with the frustration of having science made purposely inaccessible to me - science that was in many instances first paid by society and then price tagged to increase the profits of the few.

I sincerely hope that your actions, as well of those of Aaron Swartz herald the beginning of the end for the illegitimate business of exclusionary science publishing."

[T],gmaxwell_,2011-07-22T00:52Z,"4Anarchy, Indeed! And because many of the documents are old and have arcane english they don't OCR well, at least not with any of the free OCR software.

You can contribute to the effort of making the documents available by helping to solve these problems.  :)  "

,Digital_Exc,2011-07-23T19:50Z,"Although I think that data such as this should always be free to read and research, I would not go as far to say that JSTOR is abusing copyright: building and maintaining a database costs and continues to cost money. You can't blame a business for trying to earn a buck..

Comes the question: should a business like JSTOR be the custodian of such important papers? I think not. It should be maintained in a Wiki-website manor or even government subsidized way.

I applaud your efforts, now let's see if there are people willing to create a searchable website for these valuable documents."
