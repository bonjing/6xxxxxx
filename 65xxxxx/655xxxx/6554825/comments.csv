It's ""honky"" who is the butt of most of the backfiring situations, and all the others around him who just carry on being neighbours, friends or aquaintances.
At the time of the show most ""honkies"" had little social contact with the black community and ""black"" humour was of the Jim Davidson and Bernard Manning type. At least  LTN tried to show a balanced humour, even if it looks a bit strained today.

Otherwise, it was a bit naff!"
