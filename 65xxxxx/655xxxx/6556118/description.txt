Uninstall Gold 
 
Uninstall Gold is system software designed to remove remnants of unneeded programs on personal computer. Normally, Uninstall Gold scans personal computer and shows all found files, folders and registry items for users to find the desired programs to uninstall. 
Unlike other uninstall software, Uninstall Gold can remove unneeded program completely, even the remnants of folders or broken registry keys. It's more convenient, faster and secure for users to clean their computer. Still, Uninstall Gold offers some hotkeys for users to operate easily and fast. Its built-in Startup items make users know more about the programs that are automatically started by Windows.
