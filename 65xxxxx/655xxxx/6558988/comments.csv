,bongripper,2011-09-28T02:03Z,Can you post a track list? I've ripped my own versions of songs from the last 3 seasons and want to know if you have something I missed.

I'm probably way late on this and you most likely won't notice this reply, but next time don't ask for basic, obvious and rather inane details like track lists (or other similar information) until you have downloaded the .torrent file and opened it in whatever torrent client you use.  If you know anything about torrenting then you should know that file names (along with other particulars like extension types and the number of folders/files packaged inside) are made available just by opening the .torrent file via your preferred client.  And you can't make any stupid excuse like using up hard drive space because .torrent files are fucking tiny.

This type of stuff is essentially Torrenting 101... you really should know how to do it and it should be second nature.  It surprises me how dumb (or maybe, like in this case, just damn lazy) so many internet users are.  Don't expect everything to be given to you one a silver platter... especially when it would only take you a couple seconds to do it yourself.  Unless the torrent is packaged with a .rar or .zip file, asking for a list of files included is like asking someone to Google something for you.  It's fucking retarded.
