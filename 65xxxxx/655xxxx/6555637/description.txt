JustPlanes Air France A330-200 RIP by ..::LoLa::..

Air France, the world's 3rd largest airline for international passenger transport, operates a fleet of 373 aircraft to 300 destinations in more than 90 countries. The Airbus A330 is the newest addition to the fleet with 8 aircraft planned for operations around the world.

.
On this program we ferry the A330 to Chateauroux where the crew does a training flight. From the tower we observe the touch & go and go-around maneuvers before we take the aircraft back to Paris. This is followed by a transatlantic flight to Boston which features a great approach with spectacular views of Boston Logan Airport as well as the city of Boston. Also included a visit in the cabin of this brand new Airbus.
