disconnect immediately of this torrent and update to utorrent 1.8.5 ! quickly,please !
you ruin my seed !!!
you must use utorrent 1.8.0 minimum
older version than 1.7.5 does not work anymore !
due to udp tracker that your actual version cannot
work within or even recognize anyway.
too old version of utorrent are often banned by certain trackers,right ?
check your tracker list and see what's wrong with it so.
please,follow my tips,bro !
