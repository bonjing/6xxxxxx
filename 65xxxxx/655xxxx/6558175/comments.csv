,ridedawave21,2011-07-23T01:27Z,can anybody help with Cinavia copy protection that prevents streaming to PS3 please....
,YamatoCaptain,2011-07-23T05:16Z,"Sorry, if it has Cinavia, there is nothing you can do to stream it onto your ps3, unless you buy a cracked ps3."
,moribito,2011-07-23T09:29Z,"For the Cinavia issue on PS3,someone gave this workaround I haven't tested:
-settings
-sound settings
-audio output settings
-optical digital-tick all sounds
-save
-go to audio multi out and turn on"
[V],r3dcat,2011-07-23T10:22Z,"Native media player on PS3 sucks ... too many restrictions and limitations ... Jailbreak your PS3 with 3.55 CFW (I recommend KMEAW) and install and use ""Showtime"" media player -> https://github.com/andoma/showtime/downloads :)"
,CyberMouse_2011,2011-07-23T12:45Z,all you cheapskates complaining about playback on PS3 shove that PS3 up your ass and buy a DECENT DVD player with USB port you shit heads

,Kataron,2011-07-26T02:33Z,"Great quality. Movie was better than I thought it would be, but I had low expectations to begin with. At any rate, it was a pleasant surprise when the movie wasn't awful.

Thanks extremezone! Half the time I don't even bother with top 100 torrents for movies these days, I just check your recent uploads so I know I'm getting quality stuff. :)"

,KevMovieMan,2011-07-29T18:04Z,"Guys stop asking about cinavia.... if it don't play... find another route.... this is a good copy, thanks for the upload.

@2040Gamer he is far from the best around... he bites other's rips and then makes claims that they're his and his copies don't have the same problems as others which they often do. I've proved this numerous times."

,bravo2011,2011-08-18T05:16Z,"V9, A9 
And If a file has Cinavia proection then we should talk about it, like can we play this movie on a ripped disk or is streaming just affected? "
,Cerberus_NZ,2011-08-18T10:12Z,"For moribito and anyone else who hasn't tried the ps3 work-around as yet...

I'm in New Zealand and just gave it a try on our ps3 to see what happened, and sadly no go on that trick at all... it did hold out a little longer than when we tried playing the movie first time but still triggered"

,epicreaper91,2011-08-21T04:43Z,"very nice movie was very good quality. i did not try to burn it to a dvd i just stremed it from my pc to my 360, but it was very good quality copy and i will seed the hell out of this so other people can enjoy it to. thanks extremezone for the movie"
,shadownights23,2011-08-21T16:35Z,ok i got this trick for the error that comes up with this for ps3 cinavia...this only works for blue rays not stuff thats in theaters that...trust me it works for me so please leave a comment... so you can play this movie with out error for like 20 or so mins right? go to your date and time and randomly advance the day month year and time then go back and enjoy...rinse and repeat
,shadownights23,2011-08-21T16:37Z,this only works for the error that mutes the audio which usually comes on blue ray disk and shit not stuff if theaters that stop the all movie a few mins from the start... it does work so try it just advance time!!! tell me how it goes
,shadownights23,2011-08-21T16:39Z,ok i think my comments got deleted ps3 fix for cinavia blueray only!! not ts or cam!!! really easy just go to your date/time and advance it a few years it should work for awhile then do it again!!1 it works let me know
,Desert_Punk_555,2011-08-23T13:29Z,"shadownights23 has this one right... Just change the date forward a year, and repeat ever 30 mins or so... Sounds too easy but give it a try..."
,laned130,2011-08-23T18:37Z,"Seriously? The Cinavia developers were really that lazy?! You've gotta love it!

Cheers for the up."

,NOYFBDITTO,2011-09-13T19:05Z,"First off, I'm an avid expert Torrent user and while I may not leech of society without giving back like most, I am a proficient downloader.  I've NEVER EVER heard of ""Cinavia"".  I played this crappy substandard .AVI (good GOD that's a sign of why NOT to download this) using WMP and I don't have ANY codecs installed what-so-ever and it plays fine, though crappy picture and audio.  I don't use FFDShow or XVID or DIVX.

If you're not able to access this file then your system is F'ed and you need to fix it.  Cinavia or not.

And stop being putzes!"
,aquarian3,2011-09-17T13:22Z,"BRILL quality A10 V10, sound quality is absolutely fine (watched through my mainPC via HDMI cable into TV).  Thought the film was REALLY GOOD!  Love films like this anyway, full of action and good cgi.  If you like vampire movies with a blob of Mad Max & Jackie Chan thrown in, your bound to like this!"
,watbol,2011-09-27T08:53Z,"Perfect DVD quality!
Very Good, Nice 16:9-WideScreen movie.
Keep up the Good Werk¡!
