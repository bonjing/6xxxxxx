PRIEST, a post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller, is set in an alternate world -- one ravaged
by centuries of war between man and vampires. The story revolves around a legendary Warrior
Priest from the last Vampire War who now lives in obscurity among the other downtrodden human
inhabitants in walled-in dystopian cities ruled by the Church. When his niece is abducted by
a murderous pack of vampires, Priest breaks his sacred vows to venture out on a quest to find
her before they turn her into one of them. He is joined on his crusade by his niece's boyfriend,
a trigger-fingered young wasteland sheriff, and a former Warrior Priestess who possesses otherworldly
fighting skills.
