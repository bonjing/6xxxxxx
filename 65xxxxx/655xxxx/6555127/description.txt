For CAVE BABY, writing music is about the joy of stripping a song down to its rawest form until the base melody and energy are discovered, and playing thatâ€”only that.

The Toronto-based band, formed in late 2009 as a basement project originally named â€œMan Missileâ€, comprised initially of Christina Pilz (bass) and Andy Bray (guitar, vocals), after leaving their previous band (The Craft Economy). Dan Rosenthal (drums) joined the duo soon after, and the three forged what (to them at least) seems like a fairly unprecedented bondâ€”a bond strengthened by their common love of melody-driven punk rock, or just punk, or post punk, or pop punk, or... But really, they just genuinely like each other and they like playing music together, and all of this comes through in their live shows as well as their recordings.

CAVE BABYâ€™s eponymous debut release (digitally released on June 21st, 2011, with physical copies on August 6th, 2011) is a tightly wound manifestation of CAVE BABYâ€™s recording philosophy and features 7 songs delivered in just under 22 minutes. It was recorded to 1â€ tape over the course of two snowy days by Dale Morningstar (God- speed You! Black Emperor, Julie Doiron) at the Gas Station on Toronto Island, mixed by CAVE BABY, and mastered by Shawn Jurek (Oh No Forest Fires, The Wilderness of Manitoba). A 7â€ vinyl record release, entitled Moscow, will follow in October 2011, com- pleting their last remaining childhood dream.
