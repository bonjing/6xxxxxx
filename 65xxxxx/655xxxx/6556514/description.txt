About Swedish

â€¢ Swedish is an Indo-European language that belongs to the North Germanic branch of the Germanic languages, all of which derive from Old Norse.

â€¢ This course teaches rikssvenska (sometimes referred to as Standard Swedish) as spoken in and around the capital region of Stockholm.

â€¢ Swedish is spoken by approximately 10 million people, mostly in Sweden and parts of Finland.

â€¢ Norwegian and Swedish are considered mutually intelligible, with Danish also being very similar.

â€¢ The Swedish alphabet uses the 26 Latin letters, plus three additional: Ã… / Ã…, Ã„ / Ã„, and Ã– / Ã–.
