In this collection of lessons we will learn about a wide variety of useful tools and techniques for rigging a human face.

This course covers tools and techniques for rigging the human face in Maya. Throughout the course we will focus on providing animators with the control they need to create natural expressions with a control rig that computes fast. We will also creatively explore several techniques and tools that can be used to create realistic deformations. Step by step, we will construct a facial control system that is robust and animator-friendly. We will learn everything from how to create a reverse-jaw rig, rigging with curves for flexibility, how to create sticky controls, fleshy eyes, and we will also cover how to set up preset expressions for fast animation.
