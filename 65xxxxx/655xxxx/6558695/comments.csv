,DMZamora,2011-07-23T05:29Z,"@rgmontejo Don't get me wrong, but if you don't know, this is much probably not for you."
,rgmontejo,2011-07-23T08:52Z,"@DMZamora Don't get me wrong too, that's why there's tutorial, right?  It's as if you're saying school is not for people who knows nothing."

Maybe better to download Beta 3 and do a OTA download on the iPhone ? "
