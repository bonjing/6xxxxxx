        PLOT:

        A snake style expert travels the lands, imposing his mastery on
        others, until he runs into a monkey expert living on the edge of a
        small town, who defeats him soundly. The snake expert leaves vowing
        vengeance.

        A young peasant boy who is bullied by local noblemen seeks to learn
        drunken boxing from the head of a local martial arts school. The boy
        learns and eventually meets, and befriends a monkey style expert. When
        the boy beats up his previous tormentors, the nobles patriarch
        challenges his teacher, the drunken master, who defeats them.

        Embarrased, the nobles retain two hired snake style killers, one of
        whom is the expert that that was beaten by the monkey style. They kill
        everyone except the peasant boy, feeling he is too weak and unskilled
        to be worth their honour.

        The peasant combines drunken boxing with monkey style in an attempt to
        put down the snake killers.

        killing snake scene intact!
