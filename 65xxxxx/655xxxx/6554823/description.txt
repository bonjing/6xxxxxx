Brew, pour, and drink beer on your iPad. It's enormous, totally realistic, and even acts as a draught for your iPhone's iBeerâ„¢.

This hilarious visual gag takes full advantage of iPad's omnidirectional nature. There's no wrong way to hold iBeerKegâ„¢. It's a stunningly lifelike pool of beer and YOU decide where to "open" the keg to drink or pour.

Tilt for aquarium action, shake for foam and waves, play with condensation, slime and bubbles, even pretend to pour iBeer from iPad to iPhone.
