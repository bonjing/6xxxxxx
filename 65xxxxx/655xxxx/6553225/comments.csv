[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-20T17:31Z,Thanks - though the more I read the more Im dreading this relaunch
,xenoFLASH,2011-07-20T17:47Z,"me too. every decade gets a reboot now, it seems."
,MuserClair,2011-07-20T18:32Z,"thanks mirrormaster for the ul
i was going to use flashpoint/the reboot as a possible jumping on point since i'm really a marvel kinda girl..... .....not so sure, now! :-S"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-20T18:37Z,Dont give up on DC MCLair - just go back a bit. I recommend Batman titles after Bruce Wayne's Death - those are some great stories. New Flashpoint and what ive read about the relaunch especially Emo-Superman - We may ALL be Marvel guys and gals :(
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-07-20T18:56Z,Flashpoint seems to be much better than Fear Itself.
[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-20T19:11Z,Flashpoint started off rocky with the massive info-dumps. Now its actually pretty interesting. Though I do wish they took all these 3 part-ers and just stuck them into One-shots.
,plattekak,2011-07-20T20:59Z,"always was a batman kinda guy started reading marvel after flashpoint and damn i love the spider-man storylines well the first few arches after the reboot kind of suck (but that's with everyone of em right?)
i think dc's revamp is going to blow but BATMAN will hold his ground you wanna know why? because he's BATMAN"
[V],mirrormaster82,2011-07-21T02:34Z,"Yep,I agree with everyone,flashpoint is better event than fear itself,but I agree with plattekak most,not because he's batman,BUT BECAUSE HE'S GODDAMN BATMAN!!!My favorite character...:-D "
[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-21T04:37Z,Haa hAa .. my thoughts exactly (Nice All-Star reference MM82 LOL)
,MuserClair,2011-07-21T11:59Z,"ok, thanks for the advice - i'll get on it with the batman comics, and persevere with flashpoint.  got a feeling plattekak is gonna be proved right about the revamp, but hey!...i already fessed up to being a marvel kinda girl so i guess i may be biased!  in the interests of fairness i've still gotta give dc a chance as far as jumping on goes :-)"
,DarthDerp,2011-07-22T01:44Z,"Thanks for all the uploads mm82! As for the DC reboot, I'm... cautious. Some things look really good (Green Lantern, Batwoman, Suicide Squad) and some things look awful (Hipster Superman, the absence of Power Girl's boobs, Detective Comics numbering reset). I guess it could be worse - they could have given everyone an evil hammer and destroyed the Earth again."
[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-22T15:46Z,MClair: Try Batman & Robin  and Red Robin Series to start.
,MuserClair,2011-07-22T17:14Z,"thanks again for the pointers, MrD - got batman and robin post batman RIP arc, (have got batman rip and the arcs following as far as i can tell - don't know how continuity works in the dc universe.  if it's anything like the marvel uni, it can get a lil.. ..tangential....*sigh!*).  and i'm looking up red robin now! :-)

and DarthDerp, they got rid of power girl's boobs?  seems a bit harsh!  i have much to learn of the ways of dc... :-)"
,mikee189,2011-08-17T23:11Z,"Ok a bit unrelated, I'm trying to find the DC 52 series that follows Infinite Crisis because my local comic book store only had certain issues. Anyone know of a torrent that has them? "
