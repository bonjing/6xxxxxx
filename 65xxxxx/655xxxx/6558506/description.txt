Hello and thanks for downloading my torrent.

Once this torrent was created it was out of date as MS release updates constantly.
This torrent allows you to have a base to just download the small weekly updates needed to bring you up to date.

I have not included any Virus's or Trojans, I have scanned all files with F-Secure Client Security and NOD32 ESS.


I have included the following AutoPatcher elements :

- AutoPatcher for Windows Vista SP2 (x86) All Lang
- AutoPatcher for Windows XP SP3 (x86) English Lang
- AutoPatcher para Windows XP SP3 Brazil Lang
- AutoPatcher per Windows XP SP3 Italian Lang
- AutoPatcher per Windows 2000 SP4 Italian Lang

APUP was run Friday 22nd July 2011 at 15:00 GMT

The files where then compressed using 7zip.
Goto www.7-zip.org if your usual program will not open .7z files.


If you find this torrent useful please post on TPB.

I will be seeding on 100mb Dedicated Server using uTorrent 3.0 with Encryption & PeerBlock Blocklists,
so if you do not see a seed do not worry I am there!

I have split the releases into their own archives so you can download just what you want.

When you download these, un-7Zip to drive with 8GB free space, then run APUP, select relevant element
and update your version of AutoPatcher.

Please support the guys at www.PeerBlock.com, Blocking for Windows Vista/Windows 7 etc. - Great Job guys.
Then goto www.iBlockList.com and select lists.
Please consider donating to these sites to keep the projects alive.

Please seed, if a few weeks I will upload files to http://ap.snowmanuk.net for http downloads if required.

Thanks
