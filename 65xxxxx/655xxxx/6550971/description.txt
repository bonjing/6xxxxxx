Mary J Blige, Tyrese or Fantasia should cover "Harry HIPPIE" for today's generation!
This song is for the HARRY HIPPIE in all of us! We Only Have One Life to Live.. Live It To The Fullest! Live For 2morrow, But Embrace Today! @lisacarterceo, @DGMENT10

Everybody claims that they want the best things 
outta life, (ha) but not everyone, not everyone 
wanna got through the toils and strifes. 

Like this particular fella, walks around 
all day long singin' this song 
sha na lah dah dah lah dah dah dah dah 

Harry Hippie, lies asleep in the shade, 
life don't bug him cause he 
thinks he's got it made. 
He never worry about nothin' in particular 
Oooh he might even sell free press on Sunset. 

I'd like to help a man when he's down 
but I can't help him much 
when he's sleepin' on the ground. 

He's like a bottle in water 
Harry just floats through life 
Walks around all day long singin' this song 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ohhh yeah 

Mary Hippie, she's Harry's lady 
Panhandles money just to feed Harry's baby. 
She can lie down a story so incredible 
Man, you wanna help her take the food 
home and put it on the table. 

I'd like to help a man when he's down, 
but I can't help ya Harry 
if you wanna sleep on the ground. 
Sorry Harry, you're too much weight 
to carry around. 

But he still walks around all day singin' this song 
Sha dah dah dah sha nah nah nah nah nah 
nah sha lah lah lah lah dah dah dah 

Street child, street child, tell me where 
will you be goin' 
when old man winter gets his horn 
and starts blowin' 
Will you hang around LA 
or hitch a ride on a freeway 
Meet an old familiar face in a new place. 

I'd like to help a man when he's down 
But how can I help him 
if he's somewhere outta town 
Sorry Harry, think I'm gonna put you down. 
Sha dah dah dah sha dah dah dah dah 
sha lah lah lah lah dah dah dah 
Everybody help me sing this song, oh yeah, 
FADE
