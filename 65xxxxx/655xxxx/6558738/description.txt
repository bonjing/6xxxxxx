Anyone who has listened to the divine Angela play Bach will know that this album is a treat. If you don't believe me then listen to the critics:


Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. I can't say more.

'Angela Hewitt plumbs Ravel's paradoxical qualities to perfection in this superb set. This magnificent survey â€¦ a treasure trove! Angela Hewitt joins Gieseking, RogÃ©, Thibaudet and Lortie among the most distinguished if entirely different Ravel cycles on record, and easily withstands comparison in such exalted company' (Gramophone)

'Ravishingly beautiful and artistically satisfying â€¦ the whole is an offering not to be missed' (Musical Opinion)

'This newcomer from Hyperion is second to none and will now probably be a first choice for many collectors' (The Penguin Guide to Compact Discs)

'unique qualities of tone, style, and conscientious craftsmanship' (Fanfare, USA)

'Hewitt reveals textural detail rarely heard in other performances â€¦ A thought-provoking set' (Classic FM Magazine)

'Hewittâ€™s is, unlike a number of other versions of Ravelâ€™s Å“uvre, a highly worthwhile venture, full of stylish, intelligent playing' (International Record Review)

'Hewittâ€™s finest work in this collection easily ranks with the catalogâ€™s top contenders and deserves serious consideration' (ClassicsToday.com)

'Ravel trickles fluently through her fingers' (The Times)

'Delighful' (The Scotsman)

'she gets beneath the exotic surfaces of these pieces to expose their compelling musical structures' (Music Week)

'Hewittâ€™s control of tone colour is exemplary and the piano sound is warm and rounded â€¦ I recommend these discs to those wishing to acquaint themselves with some of Ravelâ€™s lesser-known piano works as well as the more popular favourites' (Pianist)

'ce quâ€™on observe dâ€™abord en Ã©coutant son intÃ©grale Ravel, câ€™est son exactitude, sa prÃ©cision, sa fidÃ©litÃ© au texte' (Le Monde de la Musique, France)

'This is revelatory playing â€¦ Hewitt is never anything other than stimulating, probing, characterful and sensitive to both the individual nuance and broader perspective of each piece' (International Piano)

'The restrained gestures, the delicate melodic ornaments, the harpsichord-like figurations, the subtle dance rhythms, the finely-balanced and beautifully engineered structures: Hewittâ€™s attention to such exquisite details is perfect' (musicweb.uk.net)

'Revelatory playing that comprehensively challenges current perceived standards of Ravel keyboard interpretation to set alongside the greatest of the past masters â€¦ a landmark set that offers unbound opportunities to learn, discover and delight in' (Piano)

'With these magnificent pieces, ranging from the well-known Gaspard de la Nuit to real curiosities, Hewitt proves her point: her colour range is vast, her touch compelling' (The Sunday Express)
