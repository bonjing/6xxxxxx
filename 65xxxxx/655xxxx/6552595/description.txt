Archive of News of the World before it closed its doors.

ABOUT:
This is a copy of *most of* the www.newsoftheworld.co.uk website. I haven't checked everything but from doing some quick exploring around the data myself, I only found a few missing pages.

This mirror was started about 2-3 days before the site went down so I can't be sure if everything made it or not, any pages you find that 404 were probably scraped after the site went down. I was also away on holidays at the time this all happened so I was unable to monitor the progress of the scrape.

This scrape was started on the morning on which the final issue of News of the World was published (Sunday the 10th of July 2011) and continued right through until the site stopped responding to requests (or something like that, I was away so I only ended up with some garbled HTTRACK output).
Uncompressed the archive contains 11.4GB of data and 184,988 files.

WHAT IS CONTAINED:
- More or less every article and associated images.
- Functional site navigation.

WHAT IS NOT CONTAINED:
- Videos.
- Anything inside a flash or java applet.
