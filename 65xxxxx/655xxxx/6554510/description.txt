DeivaThirumagal , which marks the blend of Vikram and director Vijay, is said to be a  film that's ardently moving and  enjoyable at the same time. The actor , who is known for rendering different characters on  screens, gets another fascinating  role.      Bid adieu to those movies where hero bashing goons.   Movie started to tell stories from real life experiences.    Deivathirumagal undeniably make people aware of new innovative ideas to come up with and bought in front of the silver screen.  

Story line

 Shedding light on the movie , the plot moves around a father and his daughter. Vikram  who plays the role of Krishna in the movie is a mentally challenged man. He is having a mental growth of five year  old boy who works in a chocolate factory in Ooty. His wife passed away and he is taking care of his daughter Sara.

One day the father and Daughter is detached, when his father in law take away his daughter from him. There the story takes it point.  Amala Paul plays the role of Vikramâ€™s sister in law who takes care of Sara after she had been separated from his father. Vikram  now  is in search for his daughter.    Audience are able to see entirely different  Anushka on screen. Playing the role of a lawyer  Anushka comes as a helping hand for Vikram to  get  back the custody of his daughter through court.  Santhanam comes as the junior to Anushka in  the movie.  The movie moves on with legal battles and arguments in the court.

Star Performance

 Krishna will bring applause in the career of Chiyaan Vikram, another feather cap  in Vikramâ€™s head. He  holds the scene by evoking fun.  Hardly there will be scenes where we will not turn our face from Krishna.  He is there as a five year old boy from the beginning till the end of the movie.  Young Sarah will create vibrations.  Her onscreen chemistry with Vikram has been amazing.   She will drive audience to the theatres.  Anushka in a completely different role adds  beauty to the movie .  She   is the tailored role for being an Advocate in the Movie .   Her appearance and character traits will  make people grasp that Anushka  can wear any Character. Her performance is remarkable.

Deivathirumagal Movie Review

 Mynaa fame Amala Paul needs three cheers who plays a very thorny role with a right sensitivity. Santhanam with his funny jokes makes us think and also touches the heart in emotional sequences.   Nasser playing his role prefect completes the prefect casting of Vijayâ€™s  movie that bought smile in millions.

 Technicalities

Cameraâ€™s adds beauty to the movie .  One picture reveals thousand word than a word, a special cheer for Nirav Shah who had rolled the camera  to nook and corner bought every emotions  and sensibilities in every frame. His method of soft tones adds beauty to the narration of the movie.  Giving peppy value to the lyric Na Muthukaumarâ€™s lyrics got some wonderful tones which will provide strength to the movieâ€™s script. The music adds value to the script.

  Director Vijay manages to extract the best form his characters as well as his technicians , where audience will be able to see the perfection in every touch. Adding the positive value to the movie Deivathirumagal will be the best in Vikramâ€™s career, excellent music by G V Prakash  will make people block the tickets.
 

Fianl Word:

 Film with a different script , blend of humor and emotional elements. Deivathirumagal â€“ a perfect choice  for a perfect weekend

 Rating: 4 /5
