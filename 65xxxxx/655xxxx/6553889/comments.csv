,Gusete,2011-07-21T12:33Z,Thank you for this film! Unfortunatelly I don't speak swedish. Is there anyone that can point out where to find subtitles for this film? Couldn't find any in the regular subtitles sites. Thanks

@Gusete: For Eng. subtitles; http://www.turkcealtyazi.org/sub/349437/gransen.html
When the page loaded completely, press the blue button named ""ALTYAZIYI iNDiR"" and save the sub. ((there is a rectangular blue button named ""ALTYAZIYI iNDiR"" centered on the page, right down the information box))"
