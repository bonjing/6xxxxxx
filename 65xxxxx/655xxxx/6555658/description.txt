Note: This has always been one of my favorite nihilistic suburbanite comedies since seeing it in 1996. It shocks me that it's never gotten a DVD release, especially considering how popular the director's "Dazed and Confused" is. Sadly, there's a copyright issue with the music, and the chances are pretty great that this will never make it to DVD. Up until now, the only thing I had was my hard-copy VHS, and a terrible looking VHSRiP that's been floating around the net for some years now. I discovered that it was on netflix instant streaming, in decent quality, not perfect, but much better than the VHS, and it's subsiquent rip. A quick capture, and encode, and here's a really solid(IMO) webrip of one of my favorite comedies of all time. Like I said, the quality isn't perfect, but it's definitely watchable, and much better than anything else that's been made available. Enjoy the show. :)
