HDTVRip of Bad Religion's set & interviews on Guitar Center Sessions (DirecTV) - 06/25/2011

Found a DVD of it elsewhere, and posted it here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6553801/Bad_Religion_-_Guitar_Center_Sessions_2011.06.25_DVD

Decided to make this version so it can fit on a CD. I had to deinterlace the video because the original source was...you got it - interlaced. That was the original ripper's fault, not mine. Looks a lot better now. Other than that, didn't do anything else to it. Check the info below. Enjoy!
