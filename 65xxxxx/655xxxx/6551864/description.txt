"The ability to be able to see into the body and bring the inner structure to life has a WOW factor that will appeal to anyone fascinated by the human body. As a teaching and learning aid for anatomy, it is second to none."

A detailed and interactive 3D anatomy resource aimed at both the acupuncture practitioner and student.

For the first time you can see the positions of 88 of the most commonly used acupuncture points in 3D with detailed anatomy of their needle passage, plus a further 324 named needle points that can be highlighted in their correct position.

All 3D models include all musculoskeletal and vascular anatomy with descriptive text. Anatomical alerts are provided for points where damage would be caused by incorrect direction or depth of insertion. Many 3D views are also available in cross section.

Also included are the most clinically important myofascial trigger points - and for the first time in any publication - their anatomical and clinical correspondence to acupuncture points are shown and discussed.

Further content allows you to view and compare the 14 main acupuncture meridians, with points, with 42 myofascial referred pain patterns of trigger points.
