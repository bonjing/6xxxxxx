[V],Anacondaz,2011-07-23T02:31Z,"IMPORTANT NOTES- AV Scan results of SysMech Activator v3.1.exe:
***************************************************************

1- Norton identifies Activator v3.1.exe as a possible threat:
   - Risk name: Trojan Horse
   - Risk category: Virus

2- Kaspersky identifies Activator v3.1.exe as a possible threat: 
   - Risk name: Packed.Win32.Black.a
   - Risk category: Trojan

3- Avast identifies Activator v3.1.exe as a possible threat:
   - Risk name: Win32:Trojan-gen {Other} 
   - Risk category: Virus/Worm 

4- NOD32 identifies Activator v3.1.exe as a possible threat:
   - Probably a variant of Win32/Obfuscated Trojan

5- AVG identifies Activator v3.1.exe as a possible threat: 
   - Risk name: Win32/Themida
   - Risk category: Virus


The  av scan results of Norton, Kaspersky, Avast, NOD32 and AVG 
are all false positives, caused by some used binaries and cryptors.

Also scanned with some well known antispyware, and tested in Sandboxie.
Malware detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!

So just stay cool ... or don't use this!!!

* Intimidated by the AV Scan results & scary names??? Then simply don't try this! *

,kreem,2011-07-23T09:57Z,Norton AV 2011 detected virus in the exe file.
,tommo39,2011-07-24T11:06Z,ALL COMMENTS are about VIRUS!!  what about some feed-back when you TRY to INSTALL???
,kreem,2011-07-24T22:52Z,I installed the program and it works fine - but my AV automatically deleted the assistant file as it believed it had a virus - I'm stuck with the 30 day trial. 
,Agroni38,2011-07-28T17:46Z,"Hi Anacondaz, thanks for uploading this programs, is it posible for you to upload, Bigasoft 3GP Converter, i have the old one, but i could not find the latest one anywhere, if you could then that very kind of you.

,nautica002,2011-07-30T03:40Z,"worked.took many attempts.instructions in assitant file.(fake trojan)no real viruses here.put exception in ur antivirus.run as adminstrator.i ran in safe mode to do this.suggest read assitant file first before setup.also this software comes with its own antivirus and asks you to uninstall yours or it wont install theirs.i uninstalled avg,and system mechanic antivirus wouldnt install anyway.wierd.anyway,tried license# supplied in assistant and 5 fails in a row.so i installed trial.then messed with assistant putting check marks on everything possible.reset license. tried another serial with my personal email and worked right away...while connected to internet. =D  if you cant get past trial, keep trying assistant. p.s serial maker says version8 but worked for this.ver 10.1.2 thanks anacondaz"
,Solidus-Snake,2011-08-10T11:25Z,"Great upload! Thanks for sharing!

All the instruction are in Assisant.exe, packed in assistant.rar."
,rodricks,2011-08-29T17:30Z,"Installed OK.  Performed the few functions I tried correctly, but the thing crashed constantly, at least every couple of minutes."
