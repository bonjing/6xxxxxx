,garybracket,2011-10-22T18:56Z,"@devil you have a while to go, it first starts with installing the homebrew channel on Wii. You have 4.3, so look up LetterBomb for Wii."
,Drlee.,2011-10-29T00:15Z,"Why do I always have problems with HobbitGamez?
This is the last download I shall be getting from him.

You have to convert the Iso into WBFS format, I know that, BUT I tried to open it in the Wii Game Manager and it refused to. I tried to open it in multiple other programs, and guess what? It refused. So, I put it in the WBFS USB and it opened up in the USB Loader. and USBLoaderGX. BUT, IT JUST WENT BLACK!
I tried other USB Loaders, and some other random programs I have in my Wii, and it STILL didn't work :l THANKS FOR NOTHING."

""some other random programs you have in your wii?"" Are you serious right now? ^_^ Sorry, my warranty does not cover infidels."
,fiumano-ri,2011-11-01T09:44Z,"Great game, great explanation. Thank you."
,bastard_no1,2011-11-22T00:33Z,"@ drlee check video patch is set to on so as to enable the force ntsc mode, then make sure u set block ios reload to on, "
,naturemade13,2011-12-02T19:30Z,"Just finished downloading this along with the wii sports resort, and theyre not wbfs files. It downloaded as only a normal file. On the type of file it says file instead of .wbfs. Am I supposed to do something next?"
,shrecky,2011-12-09T18:15Z,Hi just want to thank you in advance for this its downloading fast thanks again. havent tried it yet but downloaded 20 games pal and ntc and all working great thanks to my pri loader setting makes everything region free. lol. So i hope this works great like it downloads
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-12-12T03:09Z,"@naturemade13

If you check the extension of the file, it will most certainly be WBFS (assuming the download finished). Open and transfer or convert them with Wii Game Manager (read the description)."
,naturemade13,2011-12-16T03:38Z,"yea, It's not a wbfs file, only a file. I tried converting,but doesn't accept it."
,TheForces,2012-01-15T00:53Z,Just got this using ULoader from HBC! Works!! So FUN!!! Works 199%!!! HobbitGamez You ROCK every single upload of yours is awesome although the speed of the download is pretty slow... 9.5/10
,TheForces,2012-01-15T00:54Z,OMG! You guys r so Stupid! WBFS are 200X better than ISO would u like to download a 4.6GB file instead of a 2.6 GB File? Conversion using wii backup takes less than a minute going 30 MB/s ! ! !
,MacThizzle,2012-01-22T01:54Z,"I'm going to go ahead and thank you before I forget, I hear many great things about your torrents... And I know what a wbfs file is, and very greatly appreciate your work to upload that instead of an iso like ""The Forces"" had said, who wants to download twice the bandwidth for the same game?! My Mario Kart disc is on the dirty lens kick I guess, can't even get it to make a good copy! Appreciate the help in helping me retrieve my back-up! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK... 

AND TO NOOBS!!! 
Don't go and have your friends mod your wii for you then not understand why things are not working! Do a little reading, EVEN IF YOU MODDED YOUR SH_T YOURSELF!!! Google is my best friend, and surley if you are transferring games you would KNOW wbfs manager cannot manage wbfs files the way wii game manager does! YOU NEED TO TRANSFER THIS TO WBFS PARTITION WITH WII GAME MANAGER!!! OR CONVERT WBFS TO ISO WITH THAT PROGRAM AND PLACE IT ON FAT32 DRIVE!!!  

HAPPY DOWNLOADING YA'LL, AND F_CK SOPA!!!

And a shout out to Mac Tha Muthafuckin Dre R.I.P HOMIE!!!"
,The_Loko,2012-01-22T19:10Z,Works perfect in Dolphin emulator. Thanks!!
,MacThizzle,2012-02-05T14:08Z,"@HobbitGamez

GREAT WORK! Like I said in my earlier post, appreciate the WBFS! Disc wouldn't play anymore, and couldn't get a good copy from my loader do to that problem! Took my WbFs file, opened it with my game manager ***!!!(NoOb TIP) By going to open! Then going to open WbFs Files list A, then selecting the folder that houses your WbFs files! Wow, it magically appeared!!!*** Right clicked the mario kart game, and went to copy to... Then Selected my wBfS folder on my Fat 32 drive! But would have selected add files to WbFs partition if I had still had my drive formatted in such way!!! Either way, GAME WORX PERFECTLY!!!"
,willis00,2012-03-08T21:47Z,"Thanks for the torrent, but I need help

Can I load drag this WBFS file directly to my hard drive and play on the wii through wiiflow? I tried but the game comes up 10 times and when clicked restarts the wii

Do I convert this file to an .iso through Wii game manager and place of hard drive that is partitioned on FAT 32?

Do I need to convert hard drive to WBFS and place this WBFS file on it?"
,thenaughtons,2012-04-26T23:24Z,just download wii backup manager and convert to ISO if you want to burn it or load it onto HDD with wbfs manager 3.0
,j-killer,2012-04-29T06:34Z,SEEED PLEASE ?!?!
,ArmaniShowers,2012-05-01T06:05Z,"100% Awesomeness!  Thank you, Hobbit, for another great wbfs torrent."
,MrSan.,2012-06-01T02:15Z,Worked on my 4.0U Wii.
,GPFwlr,2012-06-06T08:46Z,"When i download it, it is not a wbfs file. It just says file with no extension"
