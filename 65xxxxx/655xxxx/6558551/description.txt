---------------------------------------------------      

Dungeons follows the mis-adventures of the foremost     
of all Dungeon Lords, who spends  his  time  luring      
heroes into his  labyrinthine  creations  with  the     
promise of treasure and a good fight - only  to  be     
trapped by his ingenious devices. Once they are  in      
his grasp, our Dungeon Lord  must  look  after  and     
cherish his new found prisoners until they are more     
comfortable with their  surroundings  because  come      
the "harvest", happy heroes have more precious soul      
energy  for  you  to  gleefully  extract  via  foul     
prisons or twisted torture chambers!  In  Dungeons,      
our protagonist falls  victim  to  a  devious  plot     
hatched by his vile, nasty and  thoroughly  vicious     
ex-girlfriend and finds himself at  the  bottom  of      
the underworld hierarchy and the top of the dungeon     
pile which in this world is about as bad as it  can      
get. Our Lord must have his revenge, and  make  his     
way back down the dungeon levels  to  his  rightful     
place - but first he must deal with his new bosses,     
the three despicable Dungeon Lords who stand in his     
way. At his  disposal  are  his  dim-witted  goblin     
minions who dig tunnels and build rooms to lay  out     
his lair and trap ever stronger and  braver  heroes      
who dare to  enter,  not  forgetting  to  plot  his      
revenge  against  his  ex-girlfriend  and  his  new    
bosses who think it's great fun to bombard him with     
useless  tasks.  It  goes  without  saying  that  a   
malicious and sneaky creature such as  our  Dungeon      
Lord has more than a  few  tricks  up  his  sleeve.      
Revenge will be sweet indeed.
