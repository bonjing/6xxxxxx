In his new course on The Early Middle Agesâ€”which traces a journey from Scandinavia across northern and central Europe to the farthest reaches of the Byzantine and Islamic empiresâ€”Professor Philip Daileader shares this new understanding of a world, no matter how far away and strange it may seem, that is "recognizably becoming our own."

"In countless ways, seemingly obscure events and developments from the â€˜Dark Agesâ€™ impinge on the lives of people today.

"This is true in the realm of religion, because our period saw the triumph of Christianity over paganism. â€¦ This is true in the realm of language, because every word that we speak and writeâ€”indeed, the handwriting that we use each and every dayâ€”is a product of the historical forces that we will study. â€¦ And this is true in the realm of family life, because many practices that existed in 300â€”such as polygyny, marriage within the kin group, and infanticideâ€”are illegal today and were vanishing or completely gone by the year 1000."
