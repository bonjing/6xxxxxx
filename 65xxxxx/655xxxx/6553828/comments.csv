,gouji1032,2011-07-20T23:29Z,"hey man, does it work with skidrow's update 7?"
,0-LSD-0,2011-07-20T23:42Z,"gouji1032, i'd imagine it requires that update, so yes.
My question is will this be compatible with future Skidrow updates? I've seen a lot of working releases, yet still not downloaded out of fear of bodging up my copy :("
,hootieman,2011-07-21T02:58Z,"odd the one I downloaded was 700+ megabytes, and it worked."
,OST_Oni,2011-07-21T04:36Z,"I downloaded and installed, and made sure it was enabled in the launcher, but a scene continuously plays when I load my character.  The screen blacks out and plays a sound, and right before vision returns there is a ghoul snarl. So it is either this torrent or me, dunno if it happened for anyone else."
,OST_Oni,2011-07-21T04:45Z,"Was a mod apparently, this one works and all."
,gouji1032,2011-07-21T05:44Z,"Tnx man, it works with Skidrow's update 7.

heil"
,stefanos_1,2011-07-21T14:04Z,"OST_Oni- How did you fix it, i have the same problem.."

,coryampsh,2011-07-21T16:32Z,"anybody blacking out and hearing ghoul sounds if you have the enclave commander mod you must either stop using it or do the following...

If you have Fallout Mod Manager (FOMM) you can right click the Enclave Commander esp file in the FOMM window and the use ""Open TESnip"" option, which will open up the plug-in and let you see all the data the file contains that changes/alters/adds data in the game. 
Then you go down the list to where it says ""SCPT"" (which stands for Script and any scripts that have been added/altered/changed in game are located there.) 
You click then on the little + symbol by GRUP (SCPT) and it'll open up all the data in that GRUP category. 
Any scripts you see there that do not have the name ""J3X"" you delete, because the author must have hit recompile all scripts when he modded this and marked most (if not all) scripts in-game for having been modified. 
So any script that starts as ""J3X"" stays and any script that does not have ""J3X"" is to be deleted. 
When you have deleted all the ""none-J3X"" scripts, you go to ""File"" above on the FOMM window and select ""Save"" and then save over the plugin and that's it. 
Now the only scripts left in the plugin are those for the actual Enclave Commander and that's all we want in the mod basically. 
Hope that explanation helped. "

,coryampsh,2011-07-22T01:11Z,i think the best thing to do to install this is do what i did which was make a new folder on desktop called e.g OWB and run setup with deamen tools or sumthing and set the isntall path to that folder u made and when it finishes open ur game directory got to data folder and then put whatever is in the OWB folder in there
,coryampsh,2011-07-22T01:13Z,oh and thanks alot this is a great torrent and is very amusing DLC best of them all by far 
,HideousX,2011-07-22T03:01Z,I extracted and there is no ISO to burn or mount this is fucking shit what a waste of time
,coryampsh,2011-07-23T11:00Z,@HideosX when you try to mount it in the folder u extracted too its not the normal disc image its a small file but use that and the setup.exe will open for you :)
,narcodicts,2011-07-24T02:23Z,stupid question. But where can i find the link to update to 1.4.0.525?
,Willy_B,2011-07-24T19:04Z,"Installed upd 7 and mark on ""OldWorldBlues.esm"". no radio signal! what should I do else?"
,Willy_B,2011-07-25T16:43Z,"Ok, it works good. Got signal some time later."
,sid-afc,2011-07-25T17:40Z,"I installed Old World Blues, and then update 7, and then copied skidrow-crack. Now, the launcher works but the game crashes instantly.
Anyone got a clue what went wrong?!?"
,coolgamer3545,2011-07-27T04:23Z,i have a problem i do not know how to combine rar. file with win rar. to make a iso that will actually startup if someone helps it will be greatly appreciated
,TwoCoins,2011-07-27T05:25Z,If i bought a retail copy of the game on steam can i d/l any of the torrents to the dlcs?
,TwoCoins,2011-07-31T22:47Z,"so i think the dlc work with retail version but does this patch the game to an (unofficial version)? 

if so then i won't be able to use the best mods (nvse) and project nevada"
,Atacknun,2011-08-12T19:09Z,"@TwoCoins
All the DLC's on this site will work with the steam version. But yeah, NVSE hasn't been updated yet. Freaking needs to be. I want my sprint and bullet times mods back."
,truthy,2011-08-13T18:37Z,New Vegas Script Extender (NVSE) v2 beta 9 is already out and works with update 7 Skidrow.
,odominic1988,2011-08-21T11:05Z,"OK im useless at his shit, The daemon tool doesn't identify the .iso? unless im doing something else wrong. like when i go mount and then to the .iso file, it's not there. Help is appreciated, thanks in advance."
,MisterYada,2011-08-22T10:27Z,"I've tried both this and the other OWB torrent. I can't seem to get either to work, and I've tried several tricks for each. I have the SKIDROW copy of NV with update 7 and Honest Hearts. Last attempt to put this on it somehow deleted my INI and I had to totally reinstall. Unless I'm missing some kind of trick, I think I'm stuck waiting for another SKIDROW crack."
,odominic1988,2011-08-24T23:31Z,"Nvm ignore previous comment, i got it working.

dlcs work best if ppl just bought the full game. It was $15 on steam for a week."
,JazzCorp,2011-09-18T03:17Z,Getting a error when the installer is unpacking the (OLD WORLD BLUES.esm) I mounted the .bin with magicdisc. any ideas whatâs up with that? 
,JazzCorp,2011-09-18T03:21Z,HAHA thanx piratebay as soon as i hit submit for that comment it installed properly
,TheRealEain,2011-10-23T23:39Z,"I find no .exe  file in here... I used this type of file before with another game, but there was an included .exe. In here, there's only a rar and r## files, and when i expand the rar i get a .bin and a .cue. I goggled tinyiso, got nothing but a lot of tinyiso'd games etc. Halp? "
,RbtRvltin,2012-03-03T15:41Z,"Personally, I don't have Daemon tools lite or premium, I just have VCD(Virtual Clone Drive). I just used 7-zip to extract all, hit yes to replace the bin, and mounted it w/ VCD. It ran the installation perfectly, and my game runs fine. OwO"
,Homewerk,2012-03-19T23:22Z,"I installed Skidrow's New Vegas update 7 along with Honest Hearts. They all work along with Dead Money, but when I activate Old World Blues it doesn't. 

I also downloaded Gun Runner's and Lonesome Road and neither of them work."
