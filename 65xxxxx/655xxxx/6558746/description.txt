Notes: you need your non-Unicode language set to Japanese.

Windows 7: Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Region and Language\: then "Administrative", then set "Language for non-Unicode programs" to "Japanese (Japan)", then restart your computer.
Windows XP: AppLocale should work. I don't use this OS, so give it a whirl (it should work), or upgrade to W7.

IF YOU CRASH SOMETIME EARLY IN GAME (usually after slime monster), YOUR UNICODE SETTINGS ARE BROKEN. FIX THEM BEFORE ASKING FOR SUPPORT!


Anyways, enjoy, and seed please!
