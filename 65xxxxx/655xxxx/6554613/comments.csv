,GunnzAkimbo,2011-07-23T01:37Z,"Working, and very nice apple OS.

Running on a i7-980 @ 4Ghz, but the vmware gfx emulator is a pathetic 50MB snail.

Any special vmware GFX driver around for it?"

,zenorb,2011-08-24T05:52Z,Note you may need 7-zip to extract this.  I downloaded it twice to find WinRar and Windows could not extract it as it sees it as 8000TB
,zenorb,2011-08-24T07:59Z,"On the + side Audio works for me on this one.  Other images Audio didn't work in my setup.  

On the - side itunes is expired and doesn't work.  Can't be uninstalled because it's part of OSX and can't be updated because it's verion 10.5"
