,christonian,2011-07-21T00:11Z,I cant seem to get a connection for some reason???
,christonian,2011-07-21T00:43Z,got it seemed to be something with enabling DHT but that is first time for me with Utorrent which I never had a issue with until today
,CplRowan,2011-07-21T01:09Z,Sorry might have been something on my end I was outside swimming with my kids in my pool and I walked in to my router raging and having no connectivity.
,XtraZoom,2011-07-21T04:07Z,"Maybe it is just me, but I can't save the same without crashing."
,XtraZoom,2011-07-21T04:12Z,"Ignore my previous comment, seems I cheated adding more skills instead of starting basic 7 causing it to crash when saving."
,CplRowan,2011-07-21T05:30Z,"Happy to hear you fixed it, let me know if you have any further problems, I just made it to the 3rd floor finally"
,urdethismylife,2011-07-21T20:31Z,"Working perfect thanks alot man, Will seed!

When new updates come out, do you think my saves will work with the newer versions?"
,CplRowan,2011-07-22T05:01Z,Yeah all saves from here on out should work with newer versions of the game because the community RAGED when they mentioned save game incompatibility so saves should be safe bro
,Bakum,2011-07-22T13:51Z,Thanks man! Really been waiting for the 1.03 version.
,Skeingald,2011-07-25T11:26Z,"@Cpl Rowan 
I was at their site yesterday (7/25/11 or 25/7/11 if you prefer) and the creator had a note up that said they wouldnt be able to fix the pre-1.0.3 save state issue."
,CJoker3221,2011-07-26T12:42Z,Please upload the 1.04 version please :)
,scrizt,2011-07-27T09:51Z,"Thnx CplRowan, for your upload technique! Going from 1.00 to 1.03 meant downloading just a few megabytes thnx to you not compressing unnecessary :)"
,DallonXcore,2011-08-08T03:19Z,Dude fuk you all the files went corrupt and my fukin computer went haywire! the download kept going from 99.9 to 99.8. this is is a piece a crap.
,CplRowan,2011-08-08T22:07Z,"@DallonXcore lol

,karabasan78,2011-08-13T14:01Z,"Eset found virus in ""Dungeons of Dredmor.exe"" as Kryptik.APB trojan

Anyone else found virus?"
,XtraZoom,2011-08-27T22:14Z,"karabasan78, there is no virus. I played it in my Win 7 64bit without any issues. I am running Kaspersky & Malwarebytes Anti Malware realtime with Hitman Pro on demand.

CplRowan, new 1.04 will probably be released around Sept 1st according to the game's blog. Hope to see a new copy from you soon ;)"
,Angloki,2011-09-03T03:21Z,I'm gonna buy this one - these guys deserve support - good game.
,XtraZoom,2011-09-07T08:32Z,CplRowan: THETA has released new version. Any chance you can release the new one?
,epochflail,2012-02-16T07:06Z,"Can someone paste the current patch set for all OSs? Anyone that got the HIB this was in would have access to the 1.0.9 rev.B patch. I can only find the official ""http://torrents.humblebundle.com"" version of the initial 1.0.7 HIB release which is unplayably crashy for me. Random crashes, often crashes moving between leaves, can't complete several missions as the game crashes on picking up the quest item, can't complete the game as I can't get to level 4, game crashes on every stairwell.

I mean when the game runs it's pretty good and damn funny, but it's got the mental stability of Charles Manson."
