,97adbkaj7,2011-07-20T08:00Z,"You see, the problems with rars is that people download them, unpack them right away and likely delete the rars instantly or soon after as they are only taking up space without having a purpose of their own.
Thus rars are not seeded even nearly as long and reliably as non-rared files.
So if you cared for your uploads to be seeded you would have to prefer non-rared files.
My 2 cents."
