,nacholibre4497,2011-10-12T04:17Z,@Stencoo: Wouldn't you like to correct your grammer and your spelling first? No one understands what you're saying.
,nacholibre4497,2011-10-12T04:19Z,"BTW, I'm having a problem, in the beginning of the game, after going to the Marine Command, you follow the spider-like droid, right? The you get on an elevator to leave Mars City, and loads the next level of the game. In the middle of the loading the game goes back to the main menu and I cannot go through that part, any help fixing this?"
