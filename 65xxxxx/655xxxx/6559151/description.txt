COMMENTS: Heart is in the same ranks as several other well known artists (i.e. Aerosmith, Chicago, Rush, Motley Crue and Kiss come to mind) with their "Best Of" compilations - and I have to ask how much is enough? To date I know of the following Heart compilations: "Essential Heart", "Greatest Hits: Live", "Greatest Hits 1976-83", "Greatest Hits 1985-95", "The Collection", "The Definitive Collection", "Love Songs", "Ballads & Greatest Hits". With that being said, hands down, this "Essential" collection is THE best one of the bunch. It
covers their entire career - from their debut in 1975 ("Dreamboat Annie") through 1994's live and unplugged "The Road Home". Every studio album between these dates are represented (with the exception of "Jupiter's Darling" released after the fact in 2004). All the staples are here - "Crazy On You", "Barracuda", "Magic Man", "Love Alive", "Heartless", "Straight On'", "Tell It Like It Is", "What About Love?" "Never", "These Dreams", Who Will You Run To","There's The Girl", "Alone", etc. As well as a few hidden live gems with "You're The Voice","The Road Home" and a cover of Led Zeppelin's "Rock And Roll". Heart has always sounded great
'live'... even in 2005-06 touring in the small venues... Ann's voice is still an extremely powerful instrument decades later. No compilation is perfect... if there's one out there I haven't seen it. This "Essential" collection is extremely close to being dead on accurate. I've noted only a few minor things wrong: 1. Three glaring song omissions - the live or studio version of "Mistral Wind" (the live track was on "Greatest Hits: Live" and it's a truly chilling version of the song); the title track from the album of the same name "Bebe Le Strange" or "Even It Up", and a deeper (not so glaring) track "RSVP" (from "Bad Animals"); 2.
Five songs from "Brigade" is crazy, and 3. One song from "Private Auditions" was probably one song too many (but I respect the fact that they did include something from this mess of an album). There are so many great songs on this set of discs... you will absolutely not go wrong. A great introduction for the beginners, as well as having so many wonderful songs all in one jewel case for the veteran Heart fans. Classic any way you slice it (5 stars).
