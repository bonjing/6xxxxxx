Parted Live is a small bootable GNU/Linux distribution for x86 based computers.
It enables you to use all the features of the latest versions of the GParted application.

This is GParted live 0.9.0-6.
New in this release:
The underlying GNU/Linux operating system is based on the Debian Sid repository (as of 2011/Jul/23).
New gparted 0.9.0.
Parted was rolled back to 0.2.3-7 with the patch file fix-head-size-assertion.patch from Ubuntu.
Linux kernel 2.6.39-3 is used.
Xz compression instead of gzip method was used when making squashfs and initrd. Therefore the GParted live iso or zip file is smaller by ~ 24 MB.
