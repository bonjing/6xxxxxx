[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-07-24T19:12Z,"@hostsniper 
Thanks for the grat comment :) Appreciate it!

@mgio & parth007 
Yes, updates should be no problem. 

@RWV12345  
Thanks, appreciate it!

@notadepataranta 
Thanks, great u like them :) 
You may need to reformat your hardrive like back to a backup in Snow Leopard, and then install Lion again...  Good luck :) 

@brownstem  
Actually i have never done it myself.. But yes this should be no problem. 

If you got a Mac OS installed, just download and run the DMG as easy as that.  

If NOT, you may need to burn the files on a DVD and then just install it as regular. 

Just try your way forward ;)

uumm? what u mean?

,jgm1490,2011-07-26T06:04Z,"@ Cyberpiraten 
cool torrent, this one i got it from app store, but since you seem to know lots of stuff about macs, i hope you can help me with a big problem LOTS OF US are going to have with OS X Lion. The activation blockers for Adobe products don't  seem to be working properly, so far everytime i open Ps, Ai, Ae i get a message of wrong serial in the Adobe Aplication Manager.. so far i've solved it re-entering the serials i've got from previous torrents by you, but i fear they could stop working eventually. (i checked the hosts files, and they do have the activation blocker)

-I post this here cause I think other mac users might have this issue with Lion-

Is there anything you would suggest that we can do to solve this issue? 

thankssss!"

           i am a Doctor using MacBook Pro since 1 year.Actually i stored a lot of data in Macintosh HD drive by creating a partition.But accidentally due to my lack of knowledge i deleted that partition.But after that i searched in Google and find the Remo recover pro as a best option to recover deleted partition.
http://recovermac.remosoftware.com/recover-mac-pro.html
          only pro version can recover the data.I downloaded the trial version and installed it.But it is showing all the data which i lost.But to recover that,it should be full version.I kept all my data in that partition.Can you upload that software.Please please
         Thank you very much.Waiting for your reply.This software is very nice.I think every body will gets benefited if you upload that software.I searched all over the web but not find it any where."
