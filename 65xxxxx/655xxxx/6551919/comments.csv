[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-08-11T19:50Z,"Check your settings then. If it says 75 seeds and you're connected to just one then your settings are wrong. I've done a utorrent guide, click on my username and you'll see it.  "

,MPAAss,2011-10-27T02:00Z,"Season 3, Episode 14:

The audio track is the commentary from the director, etc. Useless! Can't hear the episode. No other option in VLC. Needs a fix."
,JohnWM,2011-11-17T00:03Z,"hey guys, i am new to this but the torrent is downloading ridiculously slow on utorrent? i notice theres 105 seeders and i am uploading at 70kb/s but downloading at 0.8kb/s ??? can anyone offer any tips for speeding it up, otherwise i will be waiting till i'm 60 :~) thx in advance JOhn"
,dude8888,2011-12-03T17:14Z,"very good quality DVD rips
Best you will find online today

Only nit picking is that some of the episodes are labelled in the wrong order & the odd one has a video or audio ""glitch""

many thanks to Toilet_sniffer_V"
,xidio,2011-12-11T20:56Z,Where are the videos? I only see Extras and TSV.
,wino4life,2011-12-14T16:20Z,"So, for my boyfriend's birthday I really want to find a way to get all 9 seasons on DVD. I was wondering if you guys could think of a program that I could use that would also allow me to recreate a menu? Any info would be most beneficial :)"
,minjigga,2011-12-15T03:28Z,"These episodes are in DVD order, so watch out for that if you're importing them into something that scrapes TheTVDB for info.. they won't be in the right order"
,Sander71,2011-12-19T22:21Z,does it have subitles?
,Sander71,2011-12-19T22:25Z,dus it have subtitles?

,Exade,2011-12-26T07:22Z,"some more of you should seed, really want this, thank you for the upload."
,MeBePirating,2012-01-07T22:25Z,"@MPAAss I checked and noticed that too...that episode is unwatchable. Have not watched all episodes yet, but am midway through season 2 and it's perfect so far, thanks a bunch Toilet_sniffer_V!

@xidio make sure you looking at the seasons and not the season within the extras folder....

@wino4life Yeah, there are so many programs that are great but...making DVD's out of this wouldn't be great. For example, season 4 is 5.45 gigs, 1 gig too much for a standard dvd disk. 

My solution was to convert the files using mkv2vob (free application, no need to use piratebay for it). They come out perfect quality. Stream to my tv through PS3, done. Not to mention, the conversion only takes about 30 sec / episode. "
,peterh510,2012-01-16T15:40Z,How do I get rid of these subtitles? It's in like french or something. I deleted the subtitles in the folders and I tried to take it off with VLC but it still isn't working. Can anyone help me please?
,dagseoul,2012-01-26T08:54Z,thanks for the great upload. anyone able to seed? a little slow. thanks for the help.
,xidio,2012-02-08T15:31Z,Season 3 Ep 14 whats wit hthe idiot commentary and laughing?
,FLSBNDT,2012-02-21T02:32Z,"S01E03 is fucked.  plays full episode but has over an hour of unplayable dead space after it.

confirmed in multiple players and downloaded it 3 times now.

subtitles?  yes, but default in VLC is some weird language I don't recognize.  Just change the default to english or disable them all together."
,organicmtdew,2012-02-25T02:12Z,"Hey, I know that I'm getting this for free and contributing nothing, but whine whine whine something blah blah I'm a douche.

It *does* seem to be DLing wicked slow, tho; I'm sure it's not my settings, cos I am DLing other stuff with awesome speed, but after 6 hours I had >8megs. I'll seed, but I need to have the file first :/"

,Midorizes,2012-03-05T19:33Z,"What's the point of this torrent if I'm downloading at 4 KB/s ?
This is preposterous, outrageous and ludicrous!
I'll sue every motherfucker who seeds at the minimum..."
,Monarch125,2012-03-21T18:03Z,Can someone please seed......i have downloaded 300 Mb in 2 weeks and uploaded more than 2 gb on other hand.. we need some seeders back please
,dvorak67,2012-03-22T19:09Z,Pez Dispenser is messed up. The commentary is recorded over the top of the episode audio.
,paulct1,2012-04-05T07:57Z,"HOW DO I GET THE COMMENTARY TO WORK??

Its not in the extras folder, and I don't see a way to turn it on when I watch an episode in VLC

,Potatisen1,2012-04-06T12:42Z,Great torrent and the quality is really good as well!
,thunderlungz425,2012-04-18T19:16Z,"I am very greatful, and I will seed at least 200gigs probably alot more, but there is 735 leaches and 161 seeds, so if this is a popular torrent, demonstrated by the 735 leaches, then everyone who downloaded this before is a scumbag, douche fag, you pieces of shit better seed."
,thunderlungz425,2012-04-18T19:21Z," I'm getting 150ish kb/s, Im UPLOADING AT 500KB/S YOU FAGGOT ASSHOLES!!!"
,thunderlungz425,2012-04-18T19:23Z,oh and I have enough bandwidth to move 10MB/s 
,thunderlungz425,2012-04-18T19:41Z," To everyone downloading, do not slow down your upload speed, the problem isn't your bandwidth, the problem is there is too few people seeding and too many leaching, it's like there is 159 people throwing shit on the ground and 746 people grabbing it. if you don't slow down your UL speed then you will be speeding it up for everybody, by making it so more people are throwing shit on the ground, you follow me?"
,thunderlungz425,2012-04-18T19:43Z,"oh and 2 people stopped seeding an 11 people started leaching, this is rediculous"
,Monarch125,2012-05-05T06:46Z,after my previous post on 21/3/2012 i have only downloaded 15% in more than a month and uploaded almost thrice of it.... please people seed and share.. please for god sake share share share... stop beeing leecher..

,jerkstore,2012-05-31T04:11Z,Getting a folder of the easter eggs in full would be great too. It shows you where they all are here if you scroll down to the easter egg section http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Seinfeld_DVD_releases#Volume_8:_Season_9_.281997.E2.80.9398.29
