COMMENT: The contents of this torrent is the same as that uploaded by jklferrer in Jan 2009, so credits goes to him/her for the scans. jklferrer's torrent is of good reading quality but the book is a single 820-MB PDF file and this huge file is not bookmarked, making navigation a real PITA. This torrent is a repackage of the original to alleviate these drawbacks. The book has been broken down into 44 separate chapters (bookmarked PDF files) to reduce RAM-print (netbooks) and these chapters (files) organised in a tree structure of 3 volumes (folders) and 6 parts (subfolders). Navigation through the different chapters (files) is done using Windows Explorer (Finder in Mac OS) and within chapters (files) using bookmarks. Quick, efficient and structured. For example, if you are working on a couple of related chapters + appendices + solutions, you need to load only 40~50 MB, not the full 820 MB!

Once your download has finished, _please_ seed this torrent as often and for as long as you possibly can.
