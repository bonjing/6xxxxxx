Acoustic guitarist Mike Dowling and multi-instrumentalist Randy Sabien certainly know their way around a fretboard. This wonderful live recording [Live At the Cafe Carpe] showcases the duo's digital dexterity, their warped sense of musical humor, and a stubborn refusal to be typecast stylistically. Few acoustic duos would attempt to cover Fats Waller and the The Delmore Brothers on the same disc but Dowlng and Sabien not only do that, but throw in Ralph Stanley, Willie Dixon, and Chuck Berry for good measure. Highlights include Dowling's Hot Club of France-influenced instrumental 'Carpology', a slyly funky rendition of Dixon's 'Dead Presidents' and an athletic version of Berry's 'Jaguar and Thunderbird' that Mike turns into a singalong. Sabien proves himself to be the consummate accompanist, playing fiddle, mandolin and eight-string guitar which jells with Dowling's warm lead vocals and arsenal of guitar stylings to produce an unusually entertaining live recording.
