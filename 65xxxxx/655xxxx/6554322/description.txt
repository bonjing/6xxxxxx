Automated Ruin - Hands of the Vile (full album)

Industrial/Heavy Metal with electronic accents

**To every over-paid shit eating lawyer claiming that the production quality of music will somehow disappear if they don't sue random people into further poverty that are sharing music, this is our answer to them.  

Regardless of whether or not the styling is everyone's cup of tea, we feel the quality of our work speaks for itself.  The idea of money has nothing to do with true art and if anything, it separates those who truly believe in what they do from everyone else.

This music exists solely for the sake of existing even if only a handful of people ever get what it's about.
