,Beetlejuicexx,2011-07-24T01:09Z,"It's the Games for Windows Live EXE file. So some people may ask 'why would that work? Previously as i understand it if you install GFWL and use offline mode it works.. 

I presume it works by 'offline mode' when running THIS game, too? or have you uploaded the wrong file?"
