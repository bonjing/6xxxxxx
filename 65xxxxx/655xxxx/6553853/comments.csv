448 kbps sounds low to me or is it a typo?"
[T],insinuendo,2011-07-21T00:30Z,"It's not, unfortunately.

The North American release is scheduled for fall. "
,Hillwalker,2011-07-21T11:04Z,Does the audio have that annoying buzz of previous releases?
,mantajr,2011-07-21T19:53Z,"Hey Insinuendo,

Thx for the upload but what's the deal with the required password, man? Been filling out two of the lamest surveys and still no access :("

,miroku55,2011-07-22T01:05Z,"anyone else notice its a 10gb file? rather large for a movie, even a bluray rip. makes me wonder"
[T],insinuendo,2011-07-22T10:52Z,Yes...be suspicious of something 150 people are seeding :)
,lonet,2011-07-22T19:26Z,"still a buzz in the english audio, "
,Hillwalker,2011-07-23T10:05Z,"Thanks Insinuendo. I didn't find any buzz when listening to the English audio.

Here are english subs for the non-English speaking parts:

,FanPIX,2011-07-27T07:12Z,"but Finally I did...not worth the wait, didnt like the sound... sorry... :)"
,thewoodishard,2011-08-29T18:52Z,"The sound on this file is poor so I downloaded the audio(1.17gb) from (Hanna.2011.BluRay.1080p.AVC.DTS-HD.MA5.1-CHDBits) and used mkvmerge to add it and remove the others. The only problem is the audio is out of sync so you need to type in the box (Delay (in ms) ) 5400 which  will bring it back in line. If you have a fast download speed then I guess you would download another file, I have a slow connection so it was quicker for me to download the audio than another large file. Hope this helps somebody with slow connections. "
,thewoodishard,2011-08-30T11:31Z,ignore my comment above its still out of sync a bit
