Science Documentary hosted by Patrick Moore, published by BBC broadcasted as part of BBC The Sky at Night series in 2010 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Broadcast date: April 2010

We can never see our nearest star at night, only by day. Looking at it directly will blind us - because our nearest star is the Sun. Sir Patrick Moore is joined by the Astronomer Royal for Scotland, Professor John Brown and by Dr Chris Davis. They take us on a tour of the Sun, Earth's primary source of energy and without which life would not exist. Pete Lawrence and Paul Abel demonstrate safe ways to look at the Sun from Sir Patrick's observatory in Sussex.
