Minecraft is a game will builds by Notch (Markus Person).

 You play a man on a desert world. Cut the first tree in order to have a little rustic shelter in order to survive the zombies!
 Yes, for the night, zombies of all kinds appear out of nowhere in order to ... kill you and not destroy everything in their path!

 Take your picks, your shovels and your torches and explore randomly generated vast caverns, which will reserve more than a surprise!
 Go hunting for diamonds, kill hundreds of skeletons and construct the largest city in solo or multiplayer!

 NOTE: This game does not support the multiplayer mode. To reach the servers, you must have purchased Minecraf. Otherwise, go to the servers in the oldest version of Minecraft."
