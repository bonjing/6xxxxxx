Lewis Black, a graduate from the Yale school of drama, found success when he established an apoplectic standup persona and began talking about politics and society. Lewis Black: Black on Broadway documents his performance at the Brooks Atkinson Theater during a tour he titled "Rules of Enragement." His style will be familiar to anyone who has seen Black during his "Back in Black" segments on The Daily Show.
