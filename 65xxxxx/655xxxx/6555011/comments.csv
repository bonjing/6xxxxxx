,ady4321,2011-07-26T10:21Z,"Well we didn't do that bad. Quarter finals of the CL beating Inter Milan, knocking out AC Milan, and then getting fucking Real Madrid, hardly surprising tbh. Man.u had a fucking breeze into the final until they got a real team and then they got fucked up the arse bigtime. Arseholes didn't do shit nor did pool, granted utd won the title, shitty the f.a cup, sorry what did chÂ£l$Â£a win? nothing wern't it? we just missed out on CL again finishing 5th - yes we didn't win anything sloth11 but not many other teams did either."

I respect what u do and I am asking this just for my knowledge."

,gazzadayidd,2011-09-15T22:40Z,"thanks so much bro,as you have said we did have a quality season in 2010/11 in the CL cos lets face it we did bloo0dy well to qualify in a really exciting season, the big downer was missing out this year by virtue of a frickin bambi og !! Thats the true gulf between city and Spurs  (well up to the small matter of £150 million)spent to stay where they are now !! COYS btw i waqs at city away for that og and there was nowt in the game !!  Gutted watching the paok game tonite and our youth side !! not the same !!"
