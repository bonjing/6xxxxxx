1 obviously downloaded the torrent.
2 opened the .dmg
3 clicked on ""install mac os x lion""
4 went though all the steps and it installed no problem as if it was an upgrade.

the problem was, i wanted to do a clean install but when i tried to install it with the steps above it didnt give me options but just installed. 

now i did some research and found that if i burnt the .dmg to a disc and restarted my mac while holding the option key it would boot as if a bootable disc. so i did. and then when i did this it gave me the option to install lion clean. I went through the setup.. chose which hdd to install on but before it would start i had to enter the apple id so it can verify that i bought it. wouldnt do anything unless i put in an id. so i may just have to buy it unless someone is willing to give out an apple id that has it purchased. which wont happen. thanks if you figure something out though."

INSTALATION: After downloading the torrent, I had a file called: INSTALL MAC OS LION, I right cloked on it and chose : SHOW CONTENT, then it showed me a folder called: CONTENTS, I cliked on it and went to : SHAREDSUPPORT, I opened this folder and double clicked on: INSTALLESD.DMG, then the file was mounted on DESKTOP/shown on my desktop, then I followed the information on how to burn the DMG on USB stick. and I installed everything like a charm. After I finished installing everything, I used the time machine to restore my files and folders from a previous back up of SNOW LEOPARD. thank you for sharing."

,kumowoon,2011-07-21T12:11Z,"lol piratebay22777 i know its the same as the GM.
I checked and the retail even has the same hash code as the GM. Crazy huh?"
,bandini_11,2011-07-21T12:15Z,"This is NOT FAKE.

The build version you are downloading is older than the GoldMaster version (11A494), true. But then this retail version will update to the same build as the GM (11A511).

If you are getting errors about an incorrect Apple ID, then try this:
1. Download any free app from the Mac App Store.
2. Right-click on Lion Installer.app and open 'Contents'.
3. MAKE A BACKUP of the following:
_CodeSignature, _MASReceipt and CodeResources.
4. Replace these files with the files with the same names from your free app (from the same directory).


To install Lion, right-click on Lion Installer.app and navigate to:
Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg and mount the image, the installer is in there.


I want to reiterate that this is not fake. You can download the GM version if you want, but there is no doubt that this is the retail version.
However, as the GM is free for the developers, I doubt that Apple would have basically given them free copies of Lion.

If you are prompted to update during installation, DON'T DO IT. People have done it in the past and have had problems. You can update after installation instead.

Hope that helps :)"

So go ahead and dl this file.   I installed it on one Leopard machine, one Snow Leopard, and even a friend running  old school Panther.  You unzip, open shared support, find the DMG, then use Disk Utilities to erase your USB drive (I used a 8G size) and then restore the DMG file to the usb drive.  Once it's done, boot the machine one which you want to install, holding down the option key until you see an option to click on OS  X Lion install.  Click and you're off and running.  

If you have questions about how to install Lion from a USB drive, please search online for it.  You could install from a DVD, but it's slow and noisy, so ... try USB!  Best wishes.

Updating this with this pirated version WILL NOT VOID YOUR WARRANTY WITH MAC. 

If you go into an apple store they WILL NOT KNOW THAT YOURE RUNNING PIRATED SOFTWARE. They dont have any form of detecting it that. just install and be confident that this version is legit. 

If you're having problems installing, Read the comments in the pages before, its been brought up hundreds of times already and the solution is written there.."
,Dannieloco,2011-07-28T17:10Z,"this is a report for the tards here..


I will post again, TO THOSE WHO CAN'T LAUNCH THE APPLICATION:
1) RIGHT CLICK THE APP, CHOOSE ""SHOW PACKAGE CONTENT"".
2) UNDER THE ""PACKAGE CONTENT"" SELECT SharedResources, AND UNDER IT SHOULD BE A .DMG FILE CALLED InstallESD, ALONG WITH ANOTHER PACKAGE AS WELL.

,macLife04,2011-07-29T20:48Z,"Download Works. But.......

PROBLEM: 
1)It's a sluggish OS and has a even has a hard time working with Flash based websites.

2)Not all NEW features are adopted by third party applications. So it's really limited.

Switching between users keeps the users idle in the background to keep windows open as they were. Unfortunately, this hasn't been efficiently optimized and slows down performance.

Honestly, this OS version still needs polishing and I will install in when these issues and more are corrected, and third party applications (like Office) are up to speed on the new changes.

Switched back to Snow leopard and performance is much better.

HARDWARE:
Macbook 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
6GB DDR3 RAM
1TB HD"

,macLife04,2011-07-30T10:08Z,"@aj1991

Refer to previous post by ""Dannieloco"""
,aj1991,2011-07-30T10:25Z,"Worked perfectly. I did what a couple of people said.

1. After you download, a file will appear ""Install Mac OS X Lion"".
2. Right click the file, and click on ""Show Contents"".
3. Go inside the ""Contents"" folder, and then ""SharedSupport"".
4. Double click ""InstallESD.dmg"".
5. It will verify for a minute or two, and then the actual installation file ""Install Mac OS X Lion"" will appear in a new window. Double click that file and follow the instructions.

The uploader did a great job, but for god's sake.. write the instruction in details.


To make the app itself work, you need to repair it's permissons. 

Open ""terminal"" and type ""sudo chmod -R 770"" leave a space after ""770"" and drag the ""Install Mac OS X Lion.app"" to the terminal windows and push enter

It'll ask for your admin password, its fine type it, you won't see the password typing for security reasons

It'll take a little while to complete, but it'll open a new line when it's done
apocnova at 2011-07-21 08:46 CET:
For those of u who can't launch the installer. Right click the app, choose Show Package Content. Under SharedResources, you should see InstallESD. That's the .dmg file for the installation. If you would like a clean install, you have to either burn it to a DVD, or choose to install from a hard drive. This is the guide to extracting the .dmg onto a hard drive. http://www.liveslick.com/2007/12/28/install-leopard-with-an-external-hard-drive/
jakeconz at 2011-07-21 08:48 CET:
This version does work, I upgraded straight from the app (after repairing it's permissions) and it boots right into lion after the install. It did update the Java and all the other little fixes for other apps. 

This does allow OS Updates in the future

,floyd617,2011-07-31T02:38Z,"Guys here is the best and fastest way to do a clean install
This is what I did
1) Go to disk utility, and partition your Hard drive into 3 sections (by clicking on your hard drive on the left and selecting the 'partition tab' and then '+' icon twice so that you have 3 partitions in all)
2) your first section is your current operating system that you are using right now, your second section call it 'INSTALL DVD' (give about 10Gb to it as you will be installing iOS lion using this partition instead of an external hard drive as it is faster) and your third partition is called 'LION' 
3) after you partition into 3 sections RIGHT CLICK THE DOWNLOADED LION APP, CHOOSE ""SHOW PACKAGE CONTENT"".
4) UNDER THE ""PACKAGE CONTENT"" SELECT SharedSupport, AND UNDER IT SHOULD BE A .DMG FILE CALLED InstallESD, ALONG WITH ANOTHER PACKAGE AS WELL.
5) ""InstallESD"" IS YOUR DMG FOR INSTALLATION. drag it to the desktop
6) open disk utility again and click on your hard drive partition called 'INSTALL DVD' on the left (the 10Gb one) and click the restore tab
7.) In the â€œSourceâ€ field, select the image file (InstallESD) from your desktop 
8.) In the â€œDestinationâ€ field, drag your hard drive partition called ""INSTALL DVD"" from the Disk Utility drive list on the left onto this field. 
9) click restore ( this will take a couple of minutes)
10) Once its done, open up System Preferences
11) Click on Startup Disk and select 'INSTALL DVD' and restart your computer. ( if you don't see INSTALL DVD in your list like what happened to me, restart your computer and do step 10 again)
12) when lion operating install system starts up it will ask you what partition you want to install iOS Lion on. from the list select the drive called 'LION'

so thats the detail instruction of what I did as i saw there were people having problems, Follow it word to word and you won't go wrong
just note: in the installer after step 12) it will ask you to register. I DID NOT REGISTER (I'm not sure what happens if you click register). but once lion starts up you can do a software update

If you are happy with iOS LION then go in disk utility and delete the other 2 partitions (your old operating system and 'INSTALL DVD'), if you are unhappy start up your system with snow leopard (or whatever older operating system you may have) and then delete the 'LION'  and 'INSTALL DVD' partition in disk utility"

PROBLEM SOLVED:

I tried to boot from a 1TB hd set to MAC OS Extended and GUIO partioning, which did not work. It was not recognised as a startup disk.

I enden up burning the image it to a DVD which then worked fine.
It takes a LONG time to load, but it does the job

So once you have selected the DVD as startdisc (alt/function key @ startup), chosen Disc Utilitys to format your main drive, and then continues with the installation, I came upon a problem:
At the Apple ID step, wether I put in my apple id or not, it stopped.
This was solved pretty easy with cmd + q, and then pressing ""skip this step"".

I updated my system fully until there were no more software updates left and OSX from 10.6.7 to 10.6.8.

[ Lion REQUIRES Snow Leopard so UPDATE ur system FULLY before installing LION]

Then I turned off internet (airport, lan etc) otherwise it would checked app store for receipt.

Then I clicked on ""Install Mac OS X Lion"" (this torrent) on my desktop, followed instructions and it rebooted, upgraded and rebooted again. Showed me the reverse scrolling thingy and everything is working fine.

About This Mac says: Mac OS X Lion 10.7 (11A511) which I think is because I fully updated otherwise it would be the older (11A494 something something)

Ran software update and all I needed to install was the new iTunes v10.4

Now I will burn InstallESD.dmg on a DVD, for safekeeping, from /Install Max OS X Lion/Right Click>Show Package Contents>SharedSupport>InstallESD.dmg

after like 3 hours of troubleshooting heres what i did:

drag the files into a mac computer and right click to expand them.  go into shared resources or something and find installESD.DMG

instead of burning the disc image in mac, download an app called ""burn""  and burn it.  (the program has no progress bar but the burn takes 20 min)

after burning restart and hit the C button while its starting to boot from the new DVD.. again it takes about 30 minutes to boot from the disc"

,lambos2k,2011-09-04T20:44Z,First of all thanks for the upload! I wanted to know if anyone else is having problems with this version? One of the things is that when my apps are minimized the mission control does not recognize them as in if I minimize iTunes and use mission control the iTunes does not show up as one of the apps running I have to open from the dock. Also just purchased Parallels 7 and its showing a error box saying its corrupt? is anyone having this problem? After installing The Lion my previous partition for windows is not showing so i had to partition it again. Sorry I don't want to be an ass and not appreciate your hard work its just really frustrating. BTW I have upgraded to Lion 10.7.1 with no issues on the side note on the Parallels website one of the problem resolution is that downloading 10.7.2 version Im not sure if it is a typo but when i check for software update its not showing any new upgrades? Please if some one could help I would really appreciate it!!!
,wtfitsRICK,2011-09-05T21:59Z,"In need of some help, guys. I'm posting this from Safari, where I was told I could look for help online. The install seemed to go smoothly, but when my computer restarted, it came up with Mac OS X Utility and options to reinstall Lion, repair disk, etc. At first, I thought it wiped my drive and clean installed the operating system, but in Disk Utility under Macintosh HD, I noticed it shows the right amount of files and space left on my hard drive. When I verify the disk, it says I need to click ""Repair Disk"". Problem is, this button stays greyed out, so it isn't even an option. Right now, all I'm worried about is keeping my files (some of which aren't backed up, my mistake) without having to reformat anything. Any help? Thanks."

,feliperibeiros,2011-10-15T21:01Z,"THIS ARE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO FORMAT THEIR COMPUTER AND INSTALL THE MAC OS X LION FROM AN EXTERNAL HD.


The common instructions steps I found were:

1. After you download, a file will appear ""Install Mac OS X Lion"".
2. Right click the file, and click on ""Show Contents"".
3. Go inside the ""Contents"" folder, and then ""SharedSupport"".
4. Double click ""InstallESD.dmg"".


But when I double clicked the file InstallESD.dmg it didn't work.

Note: I was running mac OS X Snow Leopard but  I tried this same procedure in a Mac OS X Leopard and it didn't work either.

So I decided to use an empty External HD (it could be a pen drive too, but note that any file stored there will be lost).

So these are my steps:

1. After you download, a file will appear ""Install Mac OS X Lion"".
2. Right click the file, and click on ""Show Contents"".
3. Go inside the ""Contents"" folder, and then ""SharedSupport"". You are going to find a file called ""InstallESD.dmg"".
4. Open the Disk Utility (Applications > Utilities).
5. Open the Restore tab.
6. Drag the empty HD or Pen Drive to the ""Source"" field and drag the ""InstallESD.dmg"" (from the file it was downloaded) to the ""Destination"" field.
7. Press Restore.
8. After creating the disk you must go to ""System Preferences"" and select ""Startup Disk"".
9. Select you External HD or Pen Drive and hit ""Restartâ€¦""
10. Your computer is going to boot from you External HD or Pen Drive. Here you can update your old OS version or you can use the ""Disk Utility"" to format your computer HD (select your mac HD and hit Erase).
11. Now you can Install the new OS.  

I hope these infos may help someone.

Cheers guys for sharing this file!

,Faeora,2012-02-23T03:35Z,"This worked brilliantly for me. A couple notes though. First, Lion is only an option if you are running Snow Leopard I think 10.6.5 or later. the other thing is to not just run the app as it is downloaded. Secondly, when it is finished downloading right click on the .app file and select Show Package Contents from the context menu, then open the folder called Contents, then SharedSupport and you will see a .dmg file. Right click on the InstallESD.dmg file and select Open With from the context menu and use DiskImageMounter. From there it is a pretty straight forward process a Preview window will open just double click on the Install Mac OS X Lion.app within and let it run it's course, This release will allow you to ,when finished installing, install all the updates including the update from 10.7 to 10.7.3.

I was able to upgrade from OS X Leopard 10.5.8 to Snow Leopard 10.6 and run the Updates until 10.6.8 using the torrent I found and method I described here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5068890/Mac_OS_X_10.6_Snow_Leopard_%28Final_Retail%29

,man-saturday,2012-03-20T04:54Z,"@ lpknebel,
I think u need to have over 2GB of EXTERNAL space, not Internal free space (over 100 gigs as u mention). DiskImageMounter is trying to burn the install file to a pendrive or a blank dvd.
Trying pointing the Image mounter it to an 8GB formatted blank pen drive."

,bradester,2012-03-30T00:27Z,"I just get a refurbished iMac, and it came preinstalled with Snow Leopard. I just upgraded it to 10.6.8 but I want to get Lion.

I've already transfered all of my old documents onto this machine. If I download this and install will it erase my entire hard drive and install as a fresh out-of-the box instillation? Thanks."

,pxander22,2012-06-13T19:00Z,"Well, I downloaded this, and compared with my GM distro. THIS is the real thing, the build nº is 11A511, and compared to this..., seems to be OK: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1633 
Also the installation is easier and smooth than the other builds, and i forget to say that the whole OS runs much faster, nevertheless updated or installed from scratch. Many thanks to the seeders."
