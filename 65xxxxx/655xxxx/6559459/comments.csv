Reminds me of ""Catch me if you can"" except the main character is opened up more for his inadequacies and mental issues which cause him as an adult to have imaginary friends, take obscene risks, to operate as a compulsive liar and a con artist! The subs work fairly okay, could be better, but acceptable."
