Where can one find a real prince? In the royal palace, at the tournament, or maybe at a ball, but certainly not inside your own wardrobe! Yet that's exactly the place where a young girl named Blondie bumps into prince Albert. He insists that he came into her time from the past and certainly wishes to return home. Blondie and her friends, Flex and Eva, have to help the unlucky traveler. Dangers and hardships, sorcery lessons and fortuneteller's prophecies, battles against the harpies and Albert's enemies' intrigues - all this awaits the girls. Will the young sorceress be able to withstand these trials? Will be they able to open the gates into the past and bring the prince back into his time?
