How about criticizing your own books ?

Or Shakespeare's Hamlet?"

,tuvokk,2011-07-22T22:50Z,"@rasputinho are you saying that moman is a ""member of the christian community""? if that is the case then I have to apologize because then he would indeed criticize his own ""holy"" book.
But then again, when you say ""(he) should be carefull what he says"", sounds like you are threatening him? Why do you do that? Let him believe whatever nonsense he wants to believe. No need to threaten him."

Islam, Christianity and Judaism are all just very, very slight variations over the same theme and all equally inconsistent and moronic."
