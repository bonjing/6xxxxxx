,granda999,2011-07-21T15:27Z,I found a trojan on my virus scan!
,Kilzet,2011-07-21T15:41Z,"Awesome game, virus free, and works perfect. Thanks a bunch! :)"
,DMiBY,2011-07-21T15:58Z,I too found a trojan. Ran about 4 different anti-viruses and one of the files in the directory where it was installed was a trojan which takes passwords/identity details.
,ZaheBro,2011-07-21T19:10Z,"Emm... Everybody says no problems with this game, no viruses. This has no viruses for me, but whe I open my inventory the game crashes!"
,Funsom,2011-07-21T19:29Z,"Yep, trojan on here, keylogger by the look of it."
,NHProwess,2011-07-21T21:05Z,"Ok, so we have 3 people saying that it has no virus, and 3 say it has a virus.

It's probably a false positive.
And btw if this truly is a theta release then it has no virus. period."
,mewle4,2011-07-21T22:44Z,does it have virus or not
,zukke,2011-07-22T15:48Z,virus or not still great little game!
,loongear,2011-07-22T19:31Z,"I am not going to directly go blaming theta for certain but up until now each and every one of their releases turned out to contain trojans for me and this one is no different. And my kaspersky does not just flash a warning for just any cracked stuff. I never experience any shit with skidrow, reloaded or razor stuff for example but it seems plain impossible to trust theta for me now. I already swore not to touch their releases before but this was truly the last. Not trusting theta anymore."
,sputnikwood,2011-07-23T04:05Z,"I have played this for two days and now i read there are trojans in the release?  I have scanned the folder both with Avast and Malwarebytes but nothing was found.

Still, what file was scanned to be suspicious?  Is it the file named TDU500.exe?  it doesnt look like an orig game file....i placed it in the recycle bin and game still works."
,DMiBY,2011-07-23T14:02Z,"@sputnikwood Yes it was that file, I scanned it using AVG 2011 and it shown up as a keylogger/trojan. "
,mewle4,2011-07-24T10:34Z,i am downloading it can i delete the TDU500.exe
,mewle4,2011-07-24T11:06Z,i get a error on my monitor OUT OF RANGE can anybody help me?
,DMiBY,2011-07-24T16:17Z,"@randompirate Alright, thanks for that. Will install now.

@mewle4 Yes it can be deleted. And that error... hmm, try to reinstall?"
