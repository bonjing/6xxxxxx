Money uses the future in order to generate present wealth. Financial markets sell 
and buy risk, thereby binding the future. Elena Esposito explains that complex risk 
management techniques of structured finance produce new and uncontrolled risks 
because they use a simplified idea of the future, failing to account for how the 
future reacts to attempts at controlling it. During the recent financial crisis, 
the future had already been used (through securitizations, derivatives and other 
tools) to the extent that we had many futures, but no open future available.
