This is naturally a ""Portable"" and ""Stealth"" application. There's no need to ""make"" portable.

Here's how:
1. Download installer:
http://www.winaso.com/Download.asp?soft=winaso-registry-optimizer

2. Extract installer with ""Universal Extractor"".. get a stealth version from here:
http://www.portablefreeware.com/index.php?id=641#21794

3. Copy ""{app}"" to desired location, rename to your liking... that's the ""Portable"" and ""Stealth"" WinASO :)

4. Create a text file and save as ""regkey.ini"" and put in same folder as WinASO with following info:

[regkey]
400=52612124685463570063

5. To save space, you can delete ""WinASO.chm"".

6. Tested and verified.. WinASO stores it's settings in ""Application.ini"", making it ""Stealth"" and ""Portable""...

Enjoy."

so you have to use the cracked executable or block with firewall."
,whazzup3929,2011-07-29T16:57Z,herpaderp...is it really worth me deleting my old 4.5.1 winaso file to get a new one though?
