PIC links are fine, you just have to copy the link and manual open it instead of click on it...

Pretty damn awful quality, but I guess it may just do if you're really, REALLY desperate.  However, if you're physically and mentally able to wait, then I strongly suggest that you do so."

,arindammanna03,2011-07-25T03:59Z,very poor quality...
,PseudoI,2011-07-30T14:43Z,"How is this high-res?
Also, the movie is worth seeing in the cinema instead, the special effects just aren't good enough on this.

However, as people have said, if you're reeally desperate..."
,Pahapaavali,2011-08-05T00:31Z,"Highres-movies. Kinda screams ""good quality"" doesn't it? So why, even though this is 720p, it's posted under this heading? Same goes to ""highres"" cams etc. TS is TS, so I really would appreciate if these would go somewhere else than here where ppl expect good or atleast decent quality."
,echo873,2011-08-11T19:55Z,Sure it's not in the right category but what does it even matter when the whole thing obviously is not out of the films yet - meaning it will _only_ be T(ele)S(ynced).
