Kick-Ass DvD Rip

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A twisted, funny, high-octane adventure, director Matthew Vaughn brings Kick-Ass to the big screen. Kick-Ass tells the story of average teenager Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), a comic-book fanboy who decides to take his obsession as inspiration to become a real-life superhero. As any good superhero would, he chooses a new name, Kick-Ass, assembles a suit and mask to wear, and gets to work fighting crime. Thereâ€™s only one problem standing in his way: Kick-Ass has absolutely no superpowers.

His life is forever changed as he inspires a subculture of copy cats, meets up with a pair of crazed vigilantes, including an 11-year-old sword-wielding dynamo, Hit Girl (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) and her father, Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and forges a friendship with another fledgling superhero, Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). But thanks to the scheming of a local mob boss Frank Dâ€™Amico (Mark Strong), that new alliance will be put to the test.
