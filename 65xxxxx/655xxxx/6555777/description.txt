 Help! My House Is Falling Down is presented by Sarah Beeny. The series sees   
 Sarah offering advice on how to repair major structural faults, dealing with  
 subsidence or dealing with nasty pest infestation in different properties each
 week.                                                                         
                                                                               
 Sarah travels to Woolwich where she meets Christine Davis whose home of 23    
 years now has many problems and is threatening to slide away. The roof is     
 close to collapse and the electrics are in a bad way. There is also a rodent  
 infestation which has caused the home to become a health hazard.
              
                                 Enjoy!
