,blumacaw,2011-08-12T16:04Z,"thanks. would have loved a hd version, though"
[V],.Dude.,2011-08-12T16:17Z,"Hmmm,sry for that..
actually y i didnt Do an HDRip is cuz i did 2-3 hdrips and it takes about three and a half hours to encode them and the size reaches upto 900mb+
So for this i thot this rip would b perfect."
,blumacaw,2011-08-13T09:53Z,"the same movie with a bitrate of 750kbps and a 720p resolution would be about 700mb or so, to my knowledge. But, your effort is much appreciated. But don't go lower than 720 X ***. 576 X 256 doesn't look good in most of the monitors."
[V],.Dude.,2011-08-13T10:59Z,ok :)
