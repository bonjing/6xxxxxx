But a classic work from the genius Kubrick, only has about 4 BluRay sourced copies available and this is the only one with a decently small size.

My thanks (again) to murdoc for sourcing so many quality movies with great size/quality ratio, and AC3 sound ideal for HTPC hooked up with Optical/Spdif.  Perfect. Kudos."
