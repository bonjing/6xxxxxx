,ninjanutta,2011-08-10T00:00Z,this can be made about 10 gb smaller by deleting the 3d video files aswell.
,deftond,2011-08-10T01:41Z,"@ninjanutta

I dont use ps3 torrents yet but have you thought for once that people might want the 3d vide0?  what is the sense of uploading the game without it being the whole game....maybe you should get a bigger hard drive and not complain..you could be getting a 60 dollar game for free fuktard"
,ninjanutta,2011-08-11T10:42Z,"@deftond,i was just saying you prick..ive got a 3dtv and a 2tb hdd so ive got use for the full game you fukwit,it can be made smaller for people that dont have 3d..FUCKFACE.GOBSHITE CUNT"

,tjpMFface,2011-09-10T16:48Z,"so we are moding/flashing/whateve the ps3 now?  I notice the firmware is older is this for machines that can have an Os installed to it or are people spending 20-25$ a disc plus burner on blueraays (never-mind i see the milti five).

I just got a win mobile 7 phone and have been lost in it for  too long did i miss something.  If so please send me some info on it at : thadshd7@live.com
my psn is: thadrizzle2

Thanks, I love my ps3 and i love these games (best racing games ever imo)("
