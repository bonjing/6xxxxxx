the xbox 360 will not allow others to use this even if the resign it with their console ids and profile ids wont work unless u are on a jtag which isnt online. u must download the iso clean/premodded then burn to disk dual layer verbatim at 2.4x-3x also u must delete the TU that came out a couple of weeks ago then load game and re download the TU to be able to use the mods online. so u need to upload a premodded version of v1.0-1.5 EFLC ISO image not the content u took off ur usb from the xbox that wont work for anyone on a retail also u must either flash ur disc drive or do the hotswap."
