This document is a guide to the AppleScript languageâ€”its lexical conventions, syntax, keywords, and other
elements. It is intended primarily for use with AppleScript 2.0 or later and Mac OS X version 10.5 or later.
AppleScript 2.0 can use scripts developed for any version of AppleScript from 1.1 through 1.10.7, any scripting
addition created for AppleScript 1.5 or later for Mac OS X, and any scriptable application for Mac OS v7.1 or
later. A script created with AppleScript 2.0 can be used by any version of AppleScript back to version 1.1,
provided it does not use features of AppleScript, scripting additions, or scriptable applications that are
unavailable in that version.
