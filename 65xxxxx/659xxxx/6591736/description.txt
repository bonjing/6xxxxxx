This is EVERY dubstep release I have. 22 gigs worth. There may be some duplicate songs, but only because they were released multiple times in different places. 

Because it took a great deal of effort putting together this torrent in the first place, I hope you will forgive me for not organizing the files in the torrent. When you add them to iTunes (or any application that can read the id3 tags) all 2132 songs should appear in their respective albums and should be easy to sort out through there. 

As for the specific contents of the torrent, I dont have the time to type out the whole list, but it contains an (obviously) large amount of releases from all of the big names on the scene. I have (at least close to) the entire catalogue of Circus, Ultragore, Dub Police, Play Me, Play Me Too, Subhuman, Hench, Rottun, and many more. 

As for quality, 95% of this is 320kpbs. There are some that slipped by (I know Dubba Jonnys tutorials arent HQ) but I hope you can live with that. 

Enjoy =]
