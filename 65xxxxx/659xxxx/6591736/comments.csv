,killu21,2011-08-09T05:32Z,Yea seed but like holy shit where did you get all this dubstep
,mindlessmind,2011-08-09T08:15Z,"Im seeding, its huge so itll take a while no matter how fast I upload. Im taking a trip tomorrow so it might be awhile until you can finish it. 

I got this over months and months of accumulation. Im a huge dubstep fan, and follow many artists super closely, I just ended up with all of this and know that most others dont put the same time into this as I do, but wanted to spread the music as much as possible."
