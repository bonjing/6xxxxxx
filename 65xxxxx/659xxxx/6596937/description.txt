On Volume 5, recorded in Stuttgart, Germany, Art is locked in with his touring band of two years, headed by pianist, Milcho Leviev, who could be a willing partner, or a demon baiting Pepper and attempting to hog the limelight. Bassist Magnusson and drummer, Burnett, have no ego problems and provide rock steady accompaniment. After all this is Artâ€™s show, and with his health fading slowly but spirit intact and his music being his lifeline, each volume in this excursion with Art presents treats that keeps fans coming back for more
