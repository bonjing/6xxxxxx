,mmd123,2011-08-11T14:23Z,"oh of course...*nervous wreak* ooh but of course...now after I have a large mental breakdown from the number of times that technology refuses to work for me, NOW of all times, it decides to work...only after ive fucking given up...sure, why not...well i am NOT once again remaking a god damn new torrent for this pos...so if you can find it, then please download and seed it, because I'm way past done here on my end...i dont give a crap what happens from here, ive been pushed WAY past my patience level...  if you want, and you have the patience to do so, please reseed this torrent, and if you like, PLEASE REUPLOAD IT FOR ME BECAUSE IM DONE...just be sure to site my two usernames in your description...

,mmd123,2011-08-11T14:42Z,"it would appear that my issues in both utorrent and vuze stem from probably running on a raid 10, and being a 64bit os...that is the only explination i can come up with, because i tried over 50 times on each torrent to replicate the issues...and there was no definitive issue, so I'm chalking it up to be glitches based upon either my fakeraid10, or my  64bit os...  either way, they are all seeding..."
,marcoscu,2011-08-11T14:56Z,"You got there in the end...

,mmd123,2011-08-11T17:25Z,"YES...THANK YOU...that is good enough news for me...if I was actually able to get at least one of them up and working after all that hassle, then it was worth it..."
