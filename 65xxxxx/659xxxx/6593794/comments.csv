,LKingpin,2011-08-12T19:18Z,CRC check failed. Was not able to extract/install. Using the .exe. Any advice or fix?

As in the ""unl-celm.exe"" file? Honestly I havent the slightest... I've never heard of anything like that happening before. I'll try to do some research then."

Thank you for sharing, miguelsz3 =)

LKingpin, I think you'll get it proper if you download the torrent again. Maybe your file got corrupt. Re-download usually solves that problem."

Sometimes if your WinRAR it older than the version used to compress the files you get a ""CRC check failed"" error. An update of WinRAR may solve your problem."
