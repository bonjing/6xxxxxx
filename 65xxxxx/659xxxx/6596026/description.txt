Notes :   This is a cd consisting of two 1980's era vinyl bootlegs : "Elvis Presley Is Alive And Well And Singing In Las Vegas" and "Seasons Greetings From Elvis".
 
The first 18 tracks are from Elvis' Las Vegas August engagements in 1974 and 1975 , all are audience recordings with some in pretty good fidelity. 

The remainder of the cd are from a very rare 1966 radio broadcast that was issued to 100 radio stations as a reel to reel tape. After it's airing the tape was to be destroyed. 

The original vinyl release was a perfect duplicate of the RCA limited release with stunning artwork and perfect fidelity.  

With covers. Enjoy!
