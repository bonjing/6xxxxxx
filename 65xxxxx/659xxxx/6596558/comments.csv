,bigfatcoolpeople,2011-08-15T08:13Z,wait so is this a dvd rip?  or is it like a screener rip?
,jimlan99,2011-08-15T21:06Z,Somebody knows a torrent that works on PS3 (not siniva block) or whatever..
,randomuser72,2011-08-16T05:31Z,"AWESOME rip.
for everyone wondering, this is a DVD rip and it almost looks like blu ray (it makes sense since it's almost 1.5GB)
it took me about 45 mins to download this 400 kb/s
but i suggest downloading it, excellent copy :)"
,manhobrs,2011-08-16T12:57Z,"hay why is it taking so long to get dvdrips for movies these days such as Transformers 3 Dark of the Moon, fast and furious, hangover 2, thor and so on if you can do this you would be the man"

,dkent555,2011-08-19T18:07Z,"Quality is not of DVD quality, but it is decent. No problems. Thank you for this."
,oakmario,2011-08-20T05:18Z,"Does *NOT* work on PS3. Blocked by Cinavia protection after only about 5 minutes of play. This is a full stop and complete block, not just audio turning off, the playback halts.

This was after de-muxing and re-muxing the file into a .mpg so it would play on ps3. First had to use mkvToolnix to rebuild the .mkv file (no change to the inner content streams) because the container is corrupted and causes mkv2vob to crash.

After converting the .mkv to a valid .mkv with mkvToolnix, then used the new .mkv in mkv2vob and processed it into a .mpg (keeping it as H264 and AC3 audio).

Playback looks great and sounds good, but dies after 5 minutes due to Cinavia protection. Aarrrghhhhh!!!!! "
,tylerdixon31,2011-08-21T18:31Z,"@ oakmario

,zmarshall,2011-09-01T05:35Z,Got a notice from Comcast on this one.  Just a heads up to everyone.
,leeboy2496,2011-09-10T15:47Z,does this have cinivia?
,slinkymaroon,2011-09-30T06:06Z,Thanks man! Great upload.
,bigmamajay,2011-10-18T08:01Z,Cinavia only works for BluRay and cams as far as i know. I've never had a DVDRip not play on my PS3.
,bigmamajay,2011-10-18T08:06Z,Cinavia only works on BD and Cams.
,ImmortalZod,2011-10-30T10:47Z,"@ tylerdixon31
Why watch a movie on a tiny computer screen when you can use your PS3 to play it on your 42"" LCD? Way to ask a stupid question bitch."
,whall4,2011-11-02T05:29Z,The file downloaded as an MKV(movie maker) file? Can someone please tell me how to run this torrent? Thanks!
,jump454,2011-11-14T05:19Z,i created an account just to say not download this if your looking for a dvd quality. when the camera is still its ok but once they start movement it gets all blurry.
,wckddrgn,2011-11-16T16:37Z,DO NOT download..It does not work at all. Its all glitchy..cant watch it at all
[T],somespirit,2011-11-18T09:38Z," glitchy is your out of date h.264 decoder, so update it as soon as possible ......"
,omgwtfnoob,2012-01-07T07:35Z,"@whall4 vlc will play it, it will play anything."
,omgwtfnoob,2012-01-07T07:37Z,is this the actual dvdrip or is this the same r5?
,strikerace100,2012-01-21T00:49Z,"**DO NOT DOWNLOAD***
CINAVIA PROTECTED
I DOWNLOAD TO WATCH NOT REWRITE THE DAMN THING !!!!"
,Chivalry1978,2012-03-03T01:04Z,@ImmortalZod Why waste the money on a ps3 that has built in protections when you can pay 60 bucks us for a KDLINKS HD210 and a portable hard drive and plug it into your tv and watch whatever you want with no conversion or worrying about formats as it plays all including MKV.
