,dragonbandit314,2011-08-09T08:56Z,Again you have managed to post a 'New revised version'. MANY thanks. Your collection must be awesome. T
,opeles,2011-08-09T09:46Z,ok
,ikrhumba,2011-08-10T03:56Z,"Great stuff! Any chance that you could upload a higher bitrate, i.e. 320 kps? "
[V],80zforever,2011-08-10T18:27Z,"dragonbandit314, seriously I did not think people would realize there are some new stuff added cause I thought only new downloaders would get this series.

@ikrhumba, sorry dude, there's the problem of bandwidth and HD space so that's why I post them in 192. From the other hand the majority of the songs are ripped from vinyl and most of them are not of a great quality anyways. Thabks for the comment though. "
,dragonbandit314,2011-08-11T00:26Z,"80zforever, I have been collecting your 'UPS' for a while now, and yes I do notice when you make an improvement to a collection. I now have the quandry, do I keep the old one or not??? I loved the 80's and you are showing me that I know nothing!!! You are one of the reasons that I joined TPB. Just to say thankyou. T"
,z-nith,2011-08-11T05:59Z,"takes balls to request higher bitrate. i'm of the camp that the vinyl can sound better but even a 192kbps rip suffices quite well. 

and dragonbandit, if you're referring to the 'hard copies' of tracks you've upped, than YES keep the originals...digital storage is fleeting and can fail.had it happen to me. getting a solid state drive is a good bet."
[V],80zforever,2011-08-11T08:58Z,"dragonbandit314, it's totally up to you man. I have them all and will be seeding them from time to time. Thanks for your comments and interest. Much appreciated."
