[b]Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D


Sources:

Video: Russian TS
Audio: Imagines Line
Subs: rus-eng translations from Imagines Video
thx

Encode:

A bit late, but after so many requests from people who want my version, who can resist. :P
Firstly I have to say imagines version was already nice, didnt feel the need to do a version after that.
But just some things did bother me, the aspect was wrong, the audio had noise and hiss, and the eng subs over russian subs are not that great.
After a closer look at the russian video itself i didnt like the grey-black relation and the colours are mostly too low.

Work that was done:

Changed the look of the video itself to give it more life, more chroma for the colours,sharper, looks different from the others but i like it.
Right at the beginning at the introduction a guy walks through the cam, annoying, such a good video that total kills it, cutted that 10secs out together with the russian Name of the movie and replaced it with the US-Title of the Movie.
Then i cut the movie into parts, daylight, dark parts and all parts where subs where needed.
Blurred the spots with the russian subs and made english subs over it. Now you can read the subs clearly and you wont notice that there were actually subs before.
Made darker parts brighter as needed and joined all parts together.
Audio is cleaned from hiss and noise as good as possible, still slightly there, but better now.
enjoy
