[RELEASE DATE]: 2011/08/11

 
[AIR DATE....]: 2011/08/10

 
[GENRE.......]: Talk Show

 
[DESCRIPTION.]:
Now in its fourth season, The Gruen Transfer is hosted by the
inimitable Wil Anderson, who will once again pick apart the
seams of advertising with the extraordinary Russel Howcroft
and Todd Sampson, ably supported by our rotating panel of
Dan Gregory, Dee Madigan, Jeremy Nicholas, Bridget Taylor,
Jane Caro, Rowan Dean and Carolyn Miller.

Old favourite segments including The Pitch - where two
agencies compete to sell the unsellable - will return, along with
another End-Of-Show Quest. Last year we voted for The
Worst Ad Of All Time. This year, we're pushing that idea
further, hoping to identify and celebrate ... (drum roll) ... The
Worst Product Of All Time!
