Welcome to Tag Team Tuesdays. Totally non-scripted, all in front of a live audience, all broadcast live to members. Today's update is RD 2 of 4.

With Kiki Koi injured in the first round, Rain DeGrey steps out of the crowd to join The Dragons. Ultimate Surrender is a non-scripted rough sport. The choice was add Rain to the team or suspend the match. We chose to continue the show and now the Dragons have an advantage of talent.

Can The Ninja's hang on to there lead? Will Rain tip the balance of the match in the Dragons favor? Or will the Pirates reach even deeper and pull out an upset? Anything is possible.
