,kraut58,2011-08-11T22:36Z,Nothing against the uploader but in my humble opinion 'Falling Skies' is a complete waste as a series. I have really tried to get into the series but Its no longer worth the effort. Sorry!

Thanks for uping it bro."

I'm still to watch a episode :P

@DanielXP I still might try it seeing as SunDox has been kind enough to upload 1-8 in mkv

If your interested its here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6585672/Falling_Skies_Season_1_-_Episode_8_%28150MB_MKV%29"

Had some trouble playing through WiiMc, it synced out every few mins.
Works fine on VLC though"
