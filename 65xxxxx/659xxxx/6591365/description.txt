Common European Framework of Reference for Languages

Level A1 â€“ Getting started
Learn how to communicate the basics, like where you live and what your hobbies are.

Level A2 â€“ Communicating basic information
You can talk about basic topics and express your needs - like when youâ€™re shopping.

Level B1 â€“ Manage everyday situations
When traveling in Germany, you can easily deal with most situations you encounter. You can talk about your experiences and clearly state your point of view.

Level B2 â€“ Be convincing

Level C1 â€“ Communicate freely

Level C2 â€“ Express demands
