  Concert:   The show follows the pattern of the previous Vegas gig.  It was a decent concert and Elvis delivers fine renditions of America (which replaced American Trilogy as his hymn), How Great Thou Art or My Way. Also It`s Now Or Never has its charm. Pitty that he didn`t get Wooden Heart straight. 

With covers. Enjoy!
