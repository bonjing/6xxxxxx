,DontPissMeOff,2011-08-09T21:01Z,"With all due lack of respect, I would like not to thank you for uploading this 720p shit. Instead of downloading a proper 1.3GB 720p release I was foolled to download this joke. "
,white-hot,2011-08-10T01:03Z,"You, sir, are a boob! 

Bit Rate > File size

Please /wrists"
,DontPissMeOff,2011-08-10T12:56Z,"Yeah, but what's the fucking point of making 720p with low bitrate?"
,{me},2011-08-19T09:21Z,"white-hot - bit rate and file size are directly proportional.
Higher bit rate -> higher file size
Higher file size -> higher bit rate (generally speaking)
A bit rate of three quarters of a Mb is pathetic to be packaged in 720p format. Compare that to 4Mbps. https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6590732/Breaking_Bad_S04E04_Bullet_Points_720p_WEB-DL_DD5.1_H264-TB
If this file is acceptable to you, you probably aren't someone who cares about picture quality.

Thanks anyways for the upload
Happy Pirating"
