Frasier and 9/11 - Chapter 1  - "Subliminal Jokes"

This is a very short collection of clips from the Frasier show. It is the first video of a series I hope to make, on all the 9/11-related activity and other evil deeds of the Cheers/Wings/Frasier crew, especially related to the fake personas of 9/11 vicsim "David Angell", and to the more real personas of involved Hollywood actors writers and producers "in the know".

It is the first video I really put together using an appropriate software, so please forgive the numerous imperfections.
