,mrsalmon,2011-08-14T05:08Z,"Thanks for this!  Excellent burn, and some really good moments - ha hahaahaha ""ball licker"" for sure!"
,Lpspacer,2011-08-14T06:03Z,By far the worst movie I've ever seen.  Can't believe Jodie foster would demean herself with this piece of crap.  It was like watching a train wreck in very slow motion.  Deleted after tortured and think twice before watching another movie with these 2 actors. (Mel & Jodie.)  A/V 10 Movie Pure Crap.
,ashen77,2011-08-14T13:05Z,awww sams such a sad cunt. Keeps deleting comments in his/her torrents. Shabby
,chuck62,2011-08-14T19:55Z,"Great quality download but what a peice of shit. Mel, buddy get help!"
,useitright,2011-08-16T18:28Z,"This movie is a great disappointment when it comes to what Mel Gibson is actually capable of as an actor.  I really liked The Patriot, We Were Soldiers, The Lethal Weapons, Braveheart, and Forever Young.  All great movies with great acting.......and then this.  I could not make myself watch it all.  Great quality upload, but terrible movie.  Just Terrible."
,loka182,2011-08-18T12:04Z,"good rip, but wtf is up with this movie.. seriously, jodie foster produced this? "
,pssyluvr,2011-08-19T21:43Z,"Good movie. Thanks for the upload Sam. Shame the media came down so hard on Mel. He should have raped a girl or viciously tortured and murdered some animals, cause that seems to be more forgivable. "
,camo12345,2011-08-20T07:36Z,"To be fair, the movie was pretty good in my opinion. Don't listen to the losers saying it is shit. They aren't movie critics and they probably just want a movie full of sex, guns, violence and awful jokes. This movie has some funny parts to it but it is mainly a drama.

Watch it and judge for yourself, people who say its shit put other people off downloading it, if you're one of those people, then take my advice and download it and watch it yourself, you may be surprised that your taste in movies is different to people who only have half a brain."
,egent,2011-08-20T22:20Z,First thanks for the up loader (Sam) and shit on all negatives peoples and their negatives comments.
,mondocrat,2011-08-25T23:17Z,"how sad that most people allow their opinions of people to be dictated by a jewish owned media that does nothing but lie to us over & over about every important issue or event happening today. Look at their non-stop lies about Libya the past 6 months as an example. Or Iraq. 9-11, JFK, and so on. 

THe point being all that Mel ever did was criticize the elite of jewry and state facts. But in today's PC world, you aren't allowed to criticize Israel or jews. Look at Helen Thomas, RIck Sanchez, Oliver Stone, and Mel. There's 100's more I could list, including Jesus Christ himself. WHo died for criticizing jews in power. The banker bailout scam should tell you all you need to know. "
,mondocrat,2011-08-25T23:21Z," Oh BTW, the movie was excellent. It is a well scripted drama, so if you're looking for action, which is mostly what Mel has done in his career, you won't find it here. THink more Jodie Foster. Imagine Mel in a Jodie Foster drama. I'd honestly give the movie a 7 and I don't give out 10's except for 4 movies going back 80 years."
,Beach_Ape,2011-08-26T12:45Z,"@mondocrat

Thanks Mondo. This did it for me, ""Oh BTW, the movie was excellent. It is a well scripted drama, so if you're looking for action, which is mostly what Mel has done in his career, you won't find it here. THink more Jodie Foster.""

Listened to an interview on Q (CBC) and she was interviewed. She re-afirmed me as a fan because she spoke abour Mel and his troubles and commented on how, ... then corrected herself and wondered if people could departalmentailize Mel's personal life separate from his performance in this movie.

She considers it perfectly delivered by Mel. Selling it is not her problem, her art is sound."
,stzfrkx,2011-09-03T21:10Z,"a sad movie. a beautiful movie. thanks for the rip. 9/10

and..


thanks, Mel"
,maxamilliongat,2011-09-28T08:16Z,he cuts his arm off at the end of the movie trollololollolololollool
,scottsasse,2011-10-13T05:58Z,"@mondocrat, You are so wrong!! Jesus did not die criticizing the Jews, he died on a cross from being MURDERED by the Jews and still forgave them!! It was Hitler who hated the Jewish people:) "
,Heinz81,2012-06-11T04:29Z,Blu Ray rip down to 930bit rate? Why do this? Why even bother advertising it came from a blu ray?
