This is the Scenebase collection (9 August 2011). 

A collection of thousands of real C64 floppy disks for the Commodore 64 transferred to D64-diskimages. 

Browse through thousands of disks from all over the world that were in use by many Commodore 64 users.

The D64-files can be used by an emulator i.e. VICE (multiplatform, http://www.viceteam.org/)

About Scenebase:

SceneBase's C64 Collections is a central directory of collections containing archived disk and tape images. These images are most often created by reading the floppy and cassette media with original hardware and transferring the data to modern PCs via specially made cables.

At the outset let us state that we think this will have limited appeal, being most valuable to hardcore scene collectors who are researching scene history or scavenging specific kinds of releases and files for focused collections they may be putting together. But we'll try to answer the most obvious questions regarding why we're undertaking this, what our approach is, and why we think this is a valuable step in the quest for c64/scene history preservation.

Goals:
preservation
gather, track and index media image collections
availability
maintain an up to date directory of download links with stable mirrors
organization
devise a simple and concise way of referring to individual media images across all collections
produce metadata for each collection that may improve browsing, searching, and sorting
identify duplicate media images (future)
identify empty media images / corrupt transfers (future)
