Thanks a lot.Was waiting 4 it 4 a long time.

Good to see a new uploader and its gr8 that u r not doing the regular craps like others. Though its gud to do some new movies to get attention & seeds.

Hope to see many more from u. BTW I saw Chak De India on your list. Are u an Indian?"
,MRShanku,2011-08-09T06:02Z,Yes Iam an Indian...
,Kokua651,2011-08-09T06:26Z,"I wanted to make a request 4 some movies that are not available in small sizes.But before that I would like to know your preferences. 

Do u like relatively new movies ('80s,'90s,'00s) or old acclaimed movies too?
Would u upload gud Asian movies or u prefer just Hollywood movies?

Please Reply"
