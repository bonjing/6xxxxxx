NOTES:
IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........
Mr Poppers Penguins TS..........
Ok heres our second go at Poppers Penguins.......
Video was decent, slight flicker from time to time but nothing major........
Made a script to adjust the colors and darkened it a bit and ran a smoother over as it had a bit of noise so.......
Audio is LiNE we filtered synced and muxed to our encode video had several cuts where a second to 3 seconds missing so at some areas there is scene jumps
Enjoy!
