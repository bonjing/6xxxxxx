,maynblac,2011-08-12T08:55Z,seeders disappeared?
,maynblac,2011-08-12T09:14Z,"Seeding now, which I'll continue to do provided this crack actually updates and works. (which i'll check later)"
,maynblac,2011-08-12T09:19Z,scanning with avg free was clean
,maynblac,2011-08-12T09:27Z,"Okay. Game started up fine, launcher says it's 1.143, and ingame it says 1.142, but I've seen that bug reported even on legit copies, so it checks out."
,maynblac,2011-08-12T09:58Z,"one last thing and I'll stop talking to myself. the WSE loader does not seem to work with the cracked .exe, for anyone that uses it."
,BirM0n,2011-08-12T11:59Z,"Sorry about the initial break in seeding..

Thanks for the feedback maynblac.. I'm glad it works... don't know about the WSE loader (i don't even know what that is...)..

But check the forum:

Hope it helps.."
,narfdude,2011-08-19T08:57Z,"Thanks a ton for posting this, BirM0n. It works great plus it's clean. Only problem is I can't get it to work on multiplayer. It just says ""validating serial number"" for a long time, then says ""unable to connect to server""."
,BirM0n,2011-08-20T13:13Z,"@ narfdude
About the multiplayer issue.. Have you tried to download the file and instructions in this torrent:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6588970/Mount_and_Blade_-_Warband_v1.134_Working

Just download the file mb_warband_dedicated.exe and guide_MP.txt

And see if it works... It's for version 1.134 so I'm not sure..."
,narfdude,2011-08-20T22:13Z,"@Birm0n
Yeah I tried the 1.143 dedicated server file from the link in mbreg.exe which is for hosting a server and not joining one apparently. I tried it and still wasn't able to join even my own server. I'll probably just reinstall and start fresh...  If anyone has gotten it to work online, some help would be much appreciated.

Oh and the mbreg.exe file is clean; it's for registering the game to play it online."
,8ball22,2011-08-23T10:38Z,"works fine, dl speed was great 

WILL SEED"
,Kamianbu,2011-09-05T13:53Z,WSE is Warband Script Extender(or something like extending)
,Rgrzbeg,2011-10-15T06:19Z,"It was me who made and uploaded this torrent to BTJunkie (I was banned from TPB for some reason). This will be completely impossible to play multiplayer on, as I recompiled the 1.142 update with the files from the 1.143 update (basically I replaced the update files from 1.142 with 1.143), that is why it says you are playing 1.142, and is thus registering as an outdated version of Warband, even though it is actually running 1.143 through the 1.142 update."
,ladykittyn,2011-12-10T06:34Z,"Thank you SO much, I searched for hours for the proper crack to this update and you are the only one who has it, didnt look on btjunkie, I don't really trust that site. If I like this game I plan on buying it!!! It has so many cool looking mods."
,bmilos,2012-01-10T20:58Z,Has anyone found solution or crack to make work WSE (Warband Script enhancer) on cracked version of game??? Please post a link if you got something
,Thelorin,2012-01-13T11:07Z,"Could you recompile this in a way its shown as a 1.143 ? I'd be insanely thankful !
Not being able to use WSE is driving me crazy, as my favorite mods rely on it..."
,tshives26,2012-01-16T11:32Z,"M&B works fine before installing this patch. But, after I do, my game continues to crash on load. Is anyone else having this issue? Have a work around? 

PS - I am not new to this, I have done everything correctly and understand. 

Thanks for the help"
,adis74jalcin,2012-02-20T14:05Z,same problem as tshives26 please help me
,Missingbro,2012-04-02T21:10Z,"Hey asshole, if its Mount&Blade Warband, then how about you fucking tell us."
,BlackCato,2012-04-24T03:57Z,"MissingBro
Step 1 Says update with mb_warband_1100_to_1143.exe and Step 2 says replace file mb_warband.exe. Not sure where you got confused sure it didn't say it in the name but just a few seconds reading the instructions and what do you know it says warband."
