No credit to me, some random dude in BTJunkie who posted it..
The original torrent:

Works... I installed it through Crossover Games, and when I start it tells me its version 1.142 (weird..)... anyway, I have no idea if the file mbreg.exe is needed or not, or even if it is a virus. Anyone with a Windows, please let me know.

So,

Step 1 - Update to the 1.143 version using the mb_warband_upgrade_1100_to_1143.exe

Step 2 - In the game folder, replace the file mb_warband.exe with the cracked version just downloaded. Put in the game folder the mbreg.exe. As I said, i don't know if you need to run it or not..

Just try it out, but make sure to run it through your anti-virus...

have fun!
