Palast reports for BBC Television's Newsnight and The Guardian papers and has broken some of the biggest stories of recent years: the 2000 election fraud and how Bush killed off the FBI's investigation of the bin Laden family prior to the 9/11 attack.

Engaging, enlightening and always entertaining - this speech was recorded in 2003 at the Flatirons Theater in Boulder, CO and touches on various post 9/11 hot topics. An extremely important Weapon of Mass Instruction.
