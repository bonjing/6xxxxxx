,Howrenz,2011-08-21T08:11Z," ""O Mankind, keep your duty to your Lord who created you from a single soul and from it created its mate (of same kind) and from them twain has spread a multitude of men and women"" (Qur'an 4: 1)

1. The history of Muslims is rich with women of great achievements in all walks of life from as early as the seventh century (B.C.) 

2. It is impossible for anyone to justify any mistreatment of woman by any decree of rule embodied in the Islamic Law, nor could anyone dare to cancel, reduce, or distort the clear-cut legal rights of women given in Islamic Law. 

3. Throughout history, the reputation, chastity and maternal role of Muslim women were objects of admiration by impartial observers.
