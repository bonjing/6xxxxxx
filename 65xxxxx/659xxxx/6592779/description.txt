Zaki Ameen was raised a Muslim and once dedicated his life to Islam, working as an Imam. He then realised how the teachings of Muhammad and the Quran were used to deceive followers, in order to gain control, money and power.


Abu Said Al-Khudry said: 
â€œI was in the Muslim army when we attack banu Al-Mustaliq. We captured women as prisoners of war and we love to rape them. We decided to do coitus interruptus (al-azl), but we decided to ask Prophet Muhammad about it. 
He answered, â€œNo need to do coitus interruptus, because it is up to AllÃ¢h to make the women pregnant or not.â€
