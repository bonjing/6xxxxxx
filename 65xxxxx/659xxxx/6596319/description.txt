GlÃ¶s - Harmonium      

GlÃ¶s is the perfect example that doing rehearsals is old fashioned to create songs for an album. Keeley Davis (former vocalist of Engine Down and bass/synth player for Denali) and Cornbread Compton (former drummer of Engine Down) created separately 20 songs before they even saw the rehearsal room. Later they invited Maura Davis (sister of Keeley and the former front-woman of Denali) to put her beautiful vocals on the tracks.
