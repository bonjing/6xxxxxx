     From a Producer of Hero and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon comes 
     Blood: The Last Vampire, based on the cult hit anime series. Demons have
     infested Earth. And only one warrior stands between the dark and the
     light: Saya, a half-human, half-vampire samurai who preys on those who
     feast on human blood. Joining forces with the shadowy society known as
     the Council, Saya is dispatched to an American military base, where an
     intense series of swordfights leads her to the deadliest vampire of all.
     And now after 400 years, Saya's greatest hunt is about to begin.
