When you get Borrowed Power, can you make a supplemental torrent for the missing ones?"
,FluxCapacitor,2011-08-15T18:32Z,dude! demonoid had a power outage and this torrent was wiped so it's not on the trackers there anymore.  please re-up this to demonoid.  thx. :)
,ghostdog20,2011-08-16T07:26Z,"Demonoid is not letting me upload it again. 
Also, ""Eggs to Market"" just came out, so now there is three total I need:
Borrowed Power
Unto the Least Of These
Eggs to Market

When I get these I will make a new torrent. "
