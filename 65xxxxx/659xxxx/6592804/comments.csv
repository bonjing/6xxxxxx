,rolosdad,2011-08-10T14:33Z,crashes as soon as it starts..win 7 64...tried all compatabilty settings and run as admin..still no luck.:(
,Cerebral222,2011-08-10T15:13Z,"@ rolosdad, I installed this on Win 7 32 bit, then compressed it, then ran it on my other PC which is running Win 7 64 bit, had no issues; remember that this is extract & play, the DirectX must be updated individually, also, the videos in this game are WMV files, make sure your codec pack is up to date. I also ran this on a DELL GX-280 with no probs, so your looking at updating either; DirectX, Graphics card drivers, or your codec pack. Please let me know how you get on after doing this. Cheers."
,rolosdad,2011-08-10T16:02Z,"sorry mate..my pc is all up to date. never have any problems with installing and playing games. got over 200 cracked games on my HD. not blaming your upload this game just dosnt like my pc i think.:). couldnt play old GTA either. win 7 64, i5 overclocked to 3.7GHZ. 8GB DDR3, radeon 5770 OC version, Xfired. thanks anyway for upload. sure it will work fine with older pc,s"
,rolosdad,2011-08-10T16:15Z,"just tried running it with UAC and AV turned off.still no luck.freezes at press start screen. even tried setting it to run on 1 core. no luck. i really dont think its the games fault, had few issues with older games.:)"
,Cerebral222,2011-08-10T18:03Z,"This game was made in 2006 & ported to PC in 2009, it's not exactly an old game, but have you tried different Antialiasing & Bump Mapping settings which show up at the start?, I've played this on 2 fairly new PCs with Core 2 Duo & an old Dell without any issues, your problem has me scratching my head a bit, if you can figure it out please let me know as I'm curious as to what the problem might be, thanx."
,kelv1969,2011-10-29T15:46Z,doesn't run. just produces an error log. do i have to put it into a specific folder?
,Cerebral222,2011-10-30T08:32Z,"No, just extract & play. There was no CD key needed during the initial install, so no registry value is required to start the game. As you can see, this game hasn't worked on everyones PC, you'll find that's the case with most torrents, some will say the torrent is good, & some will say it's not, this game has been downloaded quite a few times, but it's only the ppl who can't get it going that I hear about with this torrent. The only thing I can advise is update your: visual basic runtime, DirectX & your graphics card drivers. Make sure your AV is not stopping it from kicking up also. Hope you get it going."
