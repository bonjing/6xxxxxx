,AndyyEcstacyy,2011-09-20T11:21Z,"thanks, but one question, any chance you can get Garret Ecstasy's new stuff up in a torrent? I like his music too. "
,naruto000,2011-09-28T00:58Z,"Great torrent, but i think there is either songs missing or album art thats missing. and there are a few albums missing every other song. so i am not sure whats wrong. but all the really good main albums are there , 1 is missing 1 song, idc its a lame song. once again Great torrent, i think its coolio"
,naruto000,2011-09-28T01:35Z,"correction, this torrent is perfect!, the reason i was missing album art and songs, is because they were not fully downloaded, everyone please force re-checks to make sure everything is downloaded, sometimes utorrent can make mistakes and not download everything, and show 100 % downloaded when its really not. i was at 97.7% thats y i was missing stuff."
