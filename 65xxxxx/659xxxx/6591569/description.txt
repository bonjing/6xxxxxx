This is a Blood On The Dance Floor discography. 

Some of it is 320 kbps or VBR. The rest is 128 constant. 

I used to have one just like this, but then All The Rage! came out, so I decided to upload a new torrent with 41,5% more BOTDF! 

So yeah. If you run into any problems, you didn't download this torrent. 

I don't do RARs of .ZIP because I don't want to deal with all that compression bullshit just to have you have to use your time to undo it.
