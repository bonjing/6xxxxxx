The only beneficial crop in non-industrial, mountainous region of Colombia is coca - therefore 70% per cent of its society is either directly or indirectly involved in production, distribution, purification or smuggling of cocaine, which makes cartel from Medelin and other mobsters be widely supported by the Colombian society. Criminals are flooding the U.S. with drugs thus earning loads of money from that business. Being fed up with that state of affairs, American government decides to get rid of drug bosses from Colombia. The war in Colombia breaks out... You are a soldier of U.S. Army Special Task Force. You have been dropped behind the enemy lines with one and only goal - to eliminate the boss of Colombian cartel.

 It was a routine operation. Colombian and American Special Forces units were destroying a cocaine plantation when a sniper's bullet killed their commanding officer. A moment later, all hell broke loose. The expedition dared to destroy cocaine fields belonging to the Benedictions cartel: the largest and most ruthless drug lord alliance in Colombia.
