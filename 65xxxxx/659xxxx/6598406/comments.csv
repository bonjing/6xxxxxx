,capri66,2011-08-12T19:56Z,Well iv just learnt after some confusion that you cant just right click on one rar file to extract them all like with avi file....you must highlight all the rar files and extract. Great game tho

You need to install the .NET Framework 4.0 and Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable.

Download them here:

Yes, sorry about that, I was a bit in a rush. Normally I repack my releases first if they are packed in a non-standard way."

 No worries mate, brilliant game makes me think before i change directiion and fall off the....ahhh thats why its called edge!  Big Thanx"
,Segab,2011-08-18T03:37Z,"Works great, but after level 45 it says: 
""Well done, you have finished the EDGE demo.""
So yeah, it's not the full game."
,jaydenbadboii,2011-08-29T00:14Z,"""_invalid_parameter_noinfo_noreturn"" after installing Visual Studio Redistributable & .NET Framework 4.0 & the .dll files - any solution?"
,ToiletClown,2011-08-30T18:34Z,"You shouldn't install the dlls seperately. What you need to do now is uninstall Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable, remove the dlls you downloaded and install Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable again."
,emash_ru,2011-09-30T21:05Z,da fuq is dis anal archivation!?
