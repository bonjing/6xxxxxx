A lot of the music from Pirates of the Caribbean Movies

I probably have some songs in the wrong folders and with the wrong titles.

I do not have the full soundtracks for the first three movies.

I do have the Disney special edition soundtrack that came with the Dead Man\'s Chest DVD.

There are some remixes and movie sound bites included.

Some of the files are .wma the majority are .mp3
