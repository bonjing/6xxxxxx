,ByrdeDragon,2011-08-12T07:48Z,I am seeding. My isp limits my up/downloading speeds. This and one other torrent I just uploaded are the only things running on my machine. Sorry for the slow speed I do not have the money to pay for a faster service. Please bear with me. It was my external harddrive that crashed. These are on my internal drive to avoid that problem.
