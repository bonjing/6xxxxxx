The Horrifying Truth is the debut offering from London based quartet, I Am Giant. Described by the band as a â€œcollection of stories, thoughts, observations and explorationâ€ The Horrifying Truth is pure, unadulterated rock, with its heart on its sleeve and an unquenchable fire in its soul. 

The London-based quartet is comprised of English vocalist Ed Martin, sticks-man Shelton Woolright (formerly of multi-platinum selling band Blindspott), bassist Paul Matthews (formerly of Auckland outfits Stylus and Tadpole) and veteran guitar-slinger Aja Timu, the last to join the IAG line-up.  â€˜And Weâ€™ll Defyâ€™ is the first single, bassist Paul Matthews explains â€˜And We\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll Defyâ€™ is a song about the human need to believe in and belong to something that can define and guide us and about how vulnerable and easily led we can become as a consequence.â€ The album also includes all three of I Am Giantâ€™s hit singles from their 2010 City Limits EP â€“ â€˜City Limitsâ€™, â€˜Neon Sunriseâ€™ and â€˜Living The Crashâ€™.
