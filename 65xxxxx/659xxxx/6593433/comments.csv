Thanks for converting to the Matroska (.mkv) format. I wish everyone converted to this format. Saving space is of importance to me and the quality is never diminished esp on BluRay copies. 
Viewed on VLC Media Player initally and Popcorn Hour C-200 Networked Media Jukebox for my TV. 
A/V - 9
M - 10"
