 Clear, concise definitions of mathematical terms are not easy to locate, and despite the seemingly close connections between math and other scientific and engineering fields, practical explanations comprehensible to those who are not primarily mathematicians are even more difficult to find. The Dictionary of Applied Mathematics for Engineers and Scientists fills that void. It contains authoritative yet accessible definitions to mathematical terms often encountered in other disciplines.
