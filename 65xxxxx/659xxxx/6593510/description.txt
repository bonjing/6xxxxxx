Enjoy 8.65 GB of SoShi goodness.


Notes:
The tracks in "2010 - Hoot EP (Japanese Release)" are in Korean.

In the "SNSD" playlist, I cut a few duplicates, as well as:

Gee (without main vocals)
Gee Rap Remix
Five versions of Sweet Delight (Jessica)
Beautiful Girls

I also highly recommend downloading the GOM Player:
