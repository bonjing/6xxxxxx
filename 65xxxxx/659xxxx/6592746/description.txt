Although nearly a gigabyte smaller than the existing Chinese 16:9 letterboxed version, and lacking English subtitles, this burn-on-demand edition (without any sort of menu) sports a 2.35:1 image which is far superior. It does have some small focus issues during reel changes, and at 2 hours 9 minutes, Sony really should have bumped it up to a DVD9.  I think the sound is also a clear improvement.

George Cukor took over as director upon the death of Charles Vidor.

Liszt (that's who this story is about) was really a man before his time. Audience members grabbing at his limbs in adoration, the eternal final concert, the stagey affectations, etc.  Favorite quote from a manager:

"We could make a fortune every time you retire."

Did G.G. Allin have such encouragement from his manager? Did he even benefit from a manager?
