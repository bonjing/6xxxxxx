BRAVO
Retrovision/Peter Vezjak, 16 mm feature length film on Laibach, Ljubljana, 1993

Similar idea to Pobeda Pod Suncem (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114176/) tailored a bit more for the western market, with the script written by the British journalist Chris Bohn.
A rock band documentary, Laibach style. The film takes you through the band\'s career from the beginning up to the Kapital project. The video features all Laibach promo videos with one exception - Across the Universe. The Let It Be album is surprisingly ignored for this film. Also features concert and television appearance clips through the years and some comments from Slavoj Zizek.
