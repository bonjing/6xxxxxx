,Kakarot69,2011-08-12T23:48Z,why has nobody uploaded the 720p rip of this yet? this is ridiculous 
,mrsjab,2011-08-13T08:14Z,"@kakarot69 - Wow.  Talk about an over-developed sense of entitlement.  If you think it's ""ridiculous"" that a 720p file isn't up yet, why don't *you* create the file and upload it for the rest of us yourself?  

TvTeam - Thank you very much for the great work you do!"
,noname408,2011-08-15T21:09Z,"@mrsjab
i think its a valid question kakarot69 is asking, why blast him? 

thanks TvTeam for the upload for sure! but i dont think you need to nerd rage over a simple question. dude, get out side and relax a little.."
,ahorwood,2011-08-19T18:16Z,"Thanks guys, again. 

I, too, would have preferred a 720p version, but I still get to see it when I want to, instead of in the middle of the night where I live. 

Merci beaucoup, TV Team."
