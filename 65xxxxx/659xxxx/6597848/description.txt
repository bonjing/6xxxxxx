The shooter market is definitely a saturated one, rife with derivative titles that 

rarely buck any trends. But every so often, a title comes along that does things a 

little bit differently. F.E.A.R. 3 is one such game. A horror and gore-inspired 
romp, 

F.E.A.R. 3 approaches the conventions of first-person shooters from a different 

perspective and successfully mixes together familiar gameplay elements with a unique 

and authentically chilling setting. F.E.A.R. 3 isn't without its problems, and these 

problems stop it from being a top echelon shooter. Still, its tendency to go off the 

beaten path is largely successful and will appeal to shooter fans and horror 

aficionados alike.


In F.E.A.R. 3, gamers are placed in the role of the genetically-enhanced Point Man, 

the protagonist from the original F.E.A.R. As you may remember from the end of 

F.E.A.R. 2, the mysterious female foil Alma forces herself upon that game's playable 

character -- Becket -- and becomes pregnant with his child. Alma is an evil psychic 

dynamo manipulated by Armacham, the same company responsible for Point Man's genetic 

enhancement, but her powers far outweigh his own. Thus, stopping Alma from having 

this kid is the name of the game in F.E.A.R. 3. Because after all, if Alma is so 

powerful, who knows what that kid is capable of?
