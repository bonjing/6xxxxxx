,RJ97,2011-08-10T13:52Z,"Hey, Thanks, Great Scenery but, i do just have one problem, there are big black X's about 100ft high above both runways and the main taxiways running alongside it, if anyone else has had this problem and has fixed it please write a comment how, thanks"
,Jimstalk,2011-08-11T09:35Z,thank you soo much!!I was wondering if you guys know a scenery addon which improves the terrain around the airport
,RJ97,2011-08-11T10:35Z,Yh thanks Y25 i'll give that a go now and if it stays like that i'll just reinstall the scenery
,vaios123,2011-08-11T19:10Z,"v1.1 update
hxxp://www.flytampa.org/dwl/FlyTampa_Athens_FSX_Update_11.exe"
,gdavej,2011-08-11T19:14Z,A word of warning... don't update the v1.0 in this torrent with the 1.1 update from FlyTqmpa website (unless of course you're into big X's splatted across the runway). The serial key in this torrent has been blacklisted in the 1.1 update.
,mickyfinny,2011-08-11T19:28Z,"For those that have these XXXXX,uninstall Athens.Re-install,go to :HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\FlyTampa\Athens\FSX or where ever flytampa is registered on your pc.Change the last number of the serial,install update and your good to go worked for me. :+)"
,mickyfinny,2011-08-11T19:32Z,"Forgot to mention,dont click on pokerface links cos his website pages contain TROJANS.Someone BAN HIM Please"
,vkk68,2011-08-11T20:45Z,Does what you enter in the 'licensed to' box matter at all? can you enter any name or has it been specifically paired with the serial number? This question is for all FT scenery. Thanks.

,flightsimmer99,2011-10-15T21:57Z,Anyway to update the v1.1 from FlyTampa? Also for some reason my norton detect this as a trojan?
