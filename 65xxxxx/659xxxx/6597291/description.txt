Baby (feat. Ludacris) Lyrics

[Justin Bieber]
Oh woooah, oh woooooah, oh wooooah, oh.
You know you love me, I know you care,
Just shout whenever and Iâ€™ll be there.
You are my love, you are my heart
and we will never ever ever be apart.
Are we an item? girl quit playing,
weâ€™re just friends, what are you saying.
Said thereâ€™s another, look right in my eyes,
my first love broke my heart for the first time.
And I was likeâ€¦

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby oooooh,
like baby, baby, baby noooooooo,
like baby, baby, baby, ooooh.
Thought youâ€™d always be mine, mine (repeat)

[Justin Beiber]
Oh, for you I would have done whatever,
and I just canâ€™t believe we aint together
and I wanna play it cool, but I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring,
And I'm in pieces,
baby fix me and you shake me tilâ€™ you wake me 

from this bad dream.
Iâ€™m going down down down down
and I just canâ€™t believe my first love wonâ€™t be 

around.
And Iâ€™m likeâ€¦

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Luda, When I was 13 I had my first love,
there was nobody that compared to my baby
and nobody came between us, no-one could ever 

come above
She had me going crazy, oh I was star-struck,

she woke me up daily, donâ€™t need no Starbucks.
She made my heart pound, I skip a beat when I see 

her in the street and
at school on the playground but I really wanna see 

her on the weekend.
She knows she got me dazing cause she was so 

amazing
and now my heart is breaking but I just keep on 

sayingâ€¦.

[Chorus]

Now Iâ€™m gone,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
now Iâ€™m all gone.
Gone, gone, gone, gone, Iâ€™m gone.
[End]
