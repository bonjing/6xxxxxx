,undeadmechanic,2012-06-05T08:39Z,"0 seeds, but roughly 20 leechers. BT reports it as 0.999 availability, so we're all missing the last 0.1%??? I'm downloading it anyways in the hopes to eventually get it all. :(

Does anyone know what file(s) are incomplete?"
,undeadmechanic,2012-06-06T05:50Z,"English, Japanese, and Swedish dubs of the films are all complete.
English and Swedish dubs of the series are complete.

As of June 5th, 2012, the missing pieces are limited to:

Japanese episodes #40 and #199

Tracks 4 and 5 from the English Lunarock soundtrack.

Tracks 15 and 16 of the ""Full Moon Collection"" album.

Tracks 4 and 6 of the ""Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Soundtrack Collection""

The remaining 6 incomplete files appear to be JPG scans of the various parts of the album art from the ""Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Soundtrack Collection""."
