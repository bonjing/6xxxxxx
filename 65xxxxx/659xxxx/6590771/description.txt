This is William P. Hoar's amazing book Architects of Conspiracy - An Intriguing History (1984) which is probably the best scholarly outline of the conspiratorial view of US history available to the public. The lust for power is not as widely understood as is the desire for fame and fortune. Perhaps some who have obtained great notoriety feel they are entitled to rule, or that control of others is the only sensation remaining in a jaded existence. Whatever the case, those afflicted with this consuming passion are responsible for most of the wars, slavery, and human misery throughout the history of the world. The subjects of this fascinating book are those who have adopted a more sophisticated approach to power than outright conquest. They employ all the techniques of intrigue, subversion, and conspiracy to manipulate authority from behind the scenes, and share the goal of a "New World Order" or a global superstate to consolidate control of humanity. It is not just some mysterious "they" but specific and often well-known individuals and organizations described in these pages. Hoar uses solid historical sources to provide an intriguing and scholarly examination of these conspirators - beginning with the French Revolution and continuing through the American Revolution, the Civil War, Reconstruction, robber barons and banking conspirators, the two World Wars ... and bringing the reader right up to the contemporary machinations of the Trilateralists. From Andrew Carnegie being raised by parents who were contemporaries of Marx and Engles, to the Kansas City Machine - mobsters who backed the young Harry Truman for congress - you will not be able to put down this book without reconsidering all you were taught in grade school. Find out just how ambitious some of your favorite historical figures were and who the ambitious personalities behind the scenes were that counselled and guided them. 360 pages. A must read for everyone.
