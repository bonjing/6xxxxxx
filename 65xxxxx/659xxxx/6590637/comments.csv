You could always rename them by removing ""Produced By...."" or ""Co-Produced By..."" 

Title near the end always gets cut off during iTunes conversion. Just copy and paste the title of a song in iTunes onto a song. "
,TonyKrew,2011-08-12T21:54Z,"titles are off, literally. who gon stop me isn't the actual song. itunes my ass"
,DontSeed,2011-08-18T07:05Z,"Yeah I could but I shouldnt have to.

Find a better version here, there's a few.

I bet all of them are better then this one by far."
