CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D


Source:
A Informante R4 DVD-R aka "The Whistleblower"
had english audio and subs on it

Encode:
to give it away in first sentence: yes english subs are hardcoded for couple foreign spoken parts ;)

Had this DVD the whole day already, got me a headstart, still dvd needed unawaited work done, it kept me busy all day long, firstly dvd was not the sharpest and had a rare interlace method, which i removed now completely in hours work.
Also there are some spoken sentences in foreign language which i noticed after my first video was already done, so i had to redo it again.
Luckily the DVD contained full english subs, but they didnt fit at all after 10 mins runtime, tried to fix that, didnt work. So i had to watch the movie and do all subs manually, removed the english spoken, just kept the foreign and had to write and retime them manually new. 
damned lot work i can tell!
Now they are hardcoded within, and you can actually enjoy the movie.


Video: 720x400 @bitrate 1800 2pass
Audio: English AC3 5.1 @448
Sample: yes included
Subs: yes english hardcoded when needed for foreign parts only[/b]
