This is the iGO Navigation system for the Android operating system, this version is the large screen version 800 x 400 Resolution, this version will fill the entire screen of your cell/mobile phone.

I did not create this, this was created by another PB user: sweix80 - so full credit goes to him.

I have just added it here to make it easier for everyone.

I tested this on my LG Optimus 3D phone running Android 2.2 which has a huge 4.3" display, this version filled the entire screen and looks and works great.

TO INSTALL
Unrar then copy the iGO folder (with contents) onto your SD card, go to Astro File Manager on your device and run the file: iGOMyWay_8.4.2.139242_JMX.apk found within the iGO folder

That's it, enjoy and share, I will seed until at least 20 others are seeding then I will stop - I think that's fair!
