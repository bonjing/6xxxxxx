,Dhirubhai2009,2011-10-28T19:47Z,There is trojan virus in the patch. Virus name - Trojan Horse Generic25.RMW. I am using AVG. 
,Dhirubhai2009,2011-10-28T19:54Z,99.99% crack files on the internet are infected. I have never came across any patch.exe file which is clean. This time I took a risk but still I got the virus.
