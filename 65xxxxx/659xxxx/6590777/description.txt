1. You may need an Administrator account to use the keymaker
   (right-click on the keymaker and choose 'Run as Administrator').

2. If the keymaker is detected/blocked by your antivirus software then 
   add it to the exclusions lists of real-time protection and auto-scan. 
   You may need to temporarily disable real-time protection and auto-scan 
   when adding the keymaker to the exclusions lists, or when using the keymaker.

3. If the keymaker is removed by your antivirus software then restore and exclude 
   it through your antivirus software (Quarantaine, History, or something similar). 

4. To manually reset the Adobe registration, search for cache.db in Windows Finder 
   and make sure to include system files. Delete all cache.db files related to 
   Adobe products (only).

5. Not tested if Acrobat X Pro 10 is updateable when using the Adobe CS5 All 
   Products Keymaker v1.10, but confirmed by some people is that updating is 
   only possible when using the Adobe CS5 Products Activator by MPT (Fixed).
