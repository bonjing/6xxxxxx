Wouldn't it be lovely, though, to see some Jap teenies looking like they were enjoying themselves, instead of screwing up their faces and whimpering like dogs left outside shops?"
,Stinger459,2011-08-22T16:13Z,That happens because more than a few of them are forced into it or down right raped. Thus the screwed up faces
,krikkitkrikkit,2011-10-09T16:55Z,"I think this is the way they believe they are supposed to behave. A rape fantasy must be very common among japanese men.. Even if they smile and laugh and joke in the beginning of a movie, they all fell they have to moan and sound like they are forced or something. It would be soooo great to see a movie where the girsl would smile a little! Allthough you can't rule out that a few are forced/coerced, I don't believe this to be a general rule. It is more to do with what they think is expected. Like American porn, where they also screw up their faces, sreaming fuck me over and over through clenched teeth. So so boring and annoying. Actually, the russians are the ones acting more natural. Neither screaming nor crying, even sometimes looking like they are having an ok time!"
