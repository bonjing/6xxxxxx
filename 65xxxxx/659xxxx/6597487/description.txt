This is my first torrent upload, and I wanted to make it a good one. I have painstakingly acquired all available Ninja Warrior episodes, all G4 episodes as well, (Japanese commentator, with English subtitles, and the only English speaking part of it is the American summaries) 

Unfortunately, I cannot/cannot be stuffed learning how to, take away the annoying ads that pop up and take a little bit of the bottom of the screen, but it doesn\'t distract too much from the actual action of the show.
