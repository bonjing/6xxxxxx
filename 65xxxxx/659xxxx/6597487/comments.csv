,mojaroar,2011-08-26T11:34Z,"cheers dude, this will also fill the gaps in my collection, still waiting for 27 though, any idea when we can expect to get it??"
,pythonimus,2011-09-08T12:47Z,"Cool Torrent.
I will seed with 620kb/s upload until 10:1."
,Hadesshade,2011-12-15T08:34Z,"Reply took a while, sorry about that, but the competition #27 was aired or took place on October 2nd, or sometime around then, but there are reports that American program that my videos are basically sourced from won't air until March 2012. When I can acquire those episodes I will post a new torrent with them all, as I have hear rumours that number 27 will be the last one."
,pirataki,2011-12-17T14:45Z,i recommend you make one torrent for each season it would be easier and you would have more seeders ;)
,Hadesshade,2012-01-07T12:43Z,"Recommendation under consideration, and possibly underway."
