I'll seed this indefinitely."
,drewb0y,2011-08-13T15:29Z,"Yeah. Believe it or not I never watched the show when it first came out and just finished watching the whole thing last week. I had to know what happened next!

Stuff like this makes you realize what utter morons the TV Execs are sometimes. Totally mindless programming can go on for 9 or 10 seasons while quality programming gets axed.

(Guess we get what we pay for)

I previously upped this on Demonoid and it only lasted a day and 30 0r 40 downloads before it got axed."
,cartman19987,2011-08-14T04:01Z,"Yeah, thanks again for the up. Also, idk if you've ever watched the show Kings, but it's also another prime example of quality programming getting the axe way before its time."
