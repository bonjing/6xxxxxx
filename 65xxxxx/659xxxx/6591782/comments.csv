[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2011-08-10T00:37Z,@funguseleet if u gonna use the direct x set up dont change destination folder if u use exe best thing to do is use winrar to extract direct x file and then run DXSETUP.exe make sure when using winrar extract direct x file to its own folder or will will have a ton of files appear in the folder u extract to simples now do it and stop the bitching please use ya brain it wont hurt you haha
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2011-08-10T00:38Z,"@Abdul-Rahman download and install ""PhysX_8.09.04_SystemSoftware"" please"

[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2011-08-10T19:50Z,if u are using 64bit then that explains it i dont test my games on a 64bit os because i dont use 64bit operating systems copy and paste the entire error report and il see if i can sort a fix out
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2011-08-10T19:52Z,get the error report from the moh console that loads when u click the exe
,funguseleet,2011-08-11T00:56Z,"the error is ""mohaa has stop working windows is searching for a solution to the problem""
 then it close's out. I search this out and it seem it is a compatibilty issue with the os, a few say to change .exe this and run mode that ..meh no biggie. thnks thou "

,smithy125,2011-08-13T03:39Z,"Great upload djDEVASTATE, im using this on Windows 7 64 bit Ultimate with no probles at all, extracted the folder and all three games work fine even on line.

People having problems with Direct x use the direct x web update here http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=35 run this program and just install simple as that updates the direct x for you"
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2011-08-17T08:25Z,@Tamarind777 theres no keylogger your anti virus software is reporting a false positive and also if there was a keylogger running while u were playing the game whats it gonna log ?????? like would you be typing passwords no you will be using your keys assigned to the game itself and a keylogger would only log that lol IM TELLING YOU NOW ITS CLEAN SO YOU HAVE EITHER MADE A MISTAKE end of
