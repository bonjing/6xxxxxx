,iasi_me,2011-08-11T18:06Z,"Working, on Snow Leopard 10.6.7   you have to wait first about 30 sec. to open but after that is working good.  thanks uploader !"
,cpearson,2011-08-13T18:02Z,"@lasselman
Do NOT OPEN IN THE DMG 
Copy it to the Desktop and Open it from there it worked for me. :D"
,fryto,2011-08-16T20:22Z,Hi. I have Mac OS X Lion and the gas does not want me to start
,MrQueenie,2011-08-16T21:41Z,"I seem to have a similar problem, everything is on the desktop, but when I click on it, the icon pops up in the dock for a second and then disappears. It also starts Wineskin, and when I click on Eurotruck again, it says something like ""Can't start, this program is already running or shutting off""?"
,ajtayjay,2011-08-22T03:56Z,"I downloaded and it and copied it to my desktop and it appears for a split secound then shuts off then get an error saying it can't read the image.
This shit does not work wineskin shit."
,poseitom,2011-08-26T13:17Z,same here- not starting up :(
,Jroentjuh_,2011-10-02T15:52Z,"It is not working!

I have a Macbook Pro running Lion.
I copied the game to my desktop and opened it, but the only thing i get is Wineskin and a black screen.
I waited for a long time, but the game won't start!

Any solutions?"
,wolski888,2011-10-15T20:05Z,"I got it to work. The game isn't that good but if anyone stills wants it then this is what I did:
After I copied the game to my computer. I right clicked it > Show Package Contents > drive_c > Program Files > Euro Truck Simulator > game.exe (NOT game_.exe)
You need an app like CrossOver to open exe files. CrossOver is available on PirateBay. When You open it, a window trying to shut down something may pop up. If it does, then cancel the shutting down. When all is well, click 'Run'. It should work."
,adidlucu,2011-11-17T08:35Z,"thanks mate, this one works well on my iMac with Lion.

starting Wineskin about 30 seconds and it works :)"
,AgentSuperball,2011-12-25T19:50Z,"initially, I dragged the app icon to my applications folder and it wouldn't start; however, dragging it to the desktop instead and opening it from there did the trick. got it working on my macbook pro w/ osx lion. sadly, it's an awful game (unless crawling down an ultra-basic representation of the M25 seems appealing to you)."
,cod4multiplayer,2011-12-31T13:54Z,"I don't know about you guys, i downloaded it, it works fine, no lagg, smoothly etc.. I am on Mac lion Early 2011 and works fine. Only the problems are when it rains, the windows becomes black.. But runs fine"
