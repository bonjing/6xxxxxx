Did the Maya really predict that the world would end in December of 2012? If not, how and why has 2012 millenarianism gained such popular appeal? In this deeply knowledgeable book, two leading historians of the Maya answer these questions in a succinct, readable, and accessible style. Matthew Restall and Amara Solari introduce, explain, and ultimately demystify the 2012 phenomenon. Firmly grounded in historical fact, while also being revelatory and myth-busting, this fascinating book will be essential reading as the countdown to December 21, 2012, begins.
