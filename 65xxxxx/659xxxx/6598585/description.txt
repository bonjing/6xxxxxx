Countdown with Keith Olbermann from Current.TV - Thursday, August 11, 2011

MISSING THE FIRST ~ONE MINUTE. The providing server was down for about the first minute. All that's missing is the introduction. I'm sending this as is, rather than waiting another three hours to *try* again. This is, after all, a news and commentary program, not a film of which Alvy Singer wouldn't want to miss the beginning! :-)

"Please watch Keith on Current if you can get the channel, harass your cable company if you cannot. Keep celebrating freedom of news."
