This is the 1993 Super Mario Bros. live action movie complete with recently released commentary created by Game Informer editors Tim Turi, Jeff Marchiafava, Bryan Vore, and Ben Reeves.


Commentary overview:
\\\"The Super Mario Bros. games have an incredibly simple plot: Mario fights goombas and turtle-looking koopas on his way to save a princess. Itâ€™s not surprising that Hollywood felt it had to elaborate on the story when it made a major motion picture out of the property back in 1993. Unfortunately, this adaptation went wildly off course. You can read all about its chaotic production process in issue 221 of Game Informer, but if youâ€™d like to watch the train wreck for yourself, youâ€™d better take it with a spoonful of sugarâ€¦or a spoonful of Game Informerâ€™s sarcastic commentary. Join Game Informer editors Tim Turi, Jeff Marchiafava, Bryan Vore, and Ben Reeves as they power through Super Mario Bros. the movie.\\\"
