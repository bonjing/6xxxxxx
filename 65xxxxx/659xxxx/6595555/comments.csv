I have a strong feeling that the acpect ratio is wrong,
I've checked out IMDB but there's no information.
If any body can tell, please let us all know."
,Vanvanero,2011-08-11T09:17Z,If you're playing this on your PC use VLC and change the aspect ratio to 2:221 and that should do the trick.
,micmac33,2011-08-11T14:06Z,"Vanvanero@
OK, thanks. I couldn't make up my mind between 2:21.1 and 2:35.1"
,nicemonkeyboy,2011-08-11T16:21Z,The correct AR is 2.35:1
,micmac33,2011-08-11T21:01Z,"OK, we have a new bidder.
I hear 2:35.1 once... twice... sold to Mr. nicemonkeyboy for a big thanks."
