Very thought provoking.

Thanks."
,xSPYDRx,2011-09-05T07:54Z,"the parts in brazil have no translation, and no subtitles.  the one part i was most interested in (since one place in brazil has a no advertising law) since this movie doesn't talk about negative nor positives of ads at all, the whole movie is just him trying to get adds for this movie."

,PrincePwn,2012-03-22T01:16Z,"The Greatest Movie Ever Torrented. And this is the best quality I have ever seen in a 1h30m video for 700MB. If you liked Supersize Me, you will love this! Kudos to everyone who helped with this torrent."
[T],Pongydog,2012-04-20T02:19Z,"Thanks, but the audio level is really low. Ended up having to rip the audio off, amplify it using Audacity and stick it back on the video to make it watchable."
