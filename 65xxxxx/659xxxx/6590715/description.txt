Found out that the BBC showed 3 episodes on the so called Family Guy Night

- 100th episode      > Comming up
- The story so far   > This one
- Creating the chaos > ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6588990/Family_Guy_BBC_Special_-_Creating_the_Chaos )

The first one is the actual episode they were planning to show, so it will generally be available on piratebay and other sources.
Finally i will also create a torrent for the 100th episode and another torrent bundling them.
So sit back, download the torrent and look at the geniusses behind this hit comedy.

Hope you enjoy
