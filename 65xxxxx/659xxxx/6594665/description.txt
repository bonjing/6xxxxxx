PRODUCT DESCRIPTION: 
Get ready to tango with RANGO, a winner with critics and audiences thatâ€™s â€œlike nothing youâ€™ve ever seen beforeâ€ (Peter Travers, Rolling Stone). Johnny Depp is spectacular as Rango, a kooky pet chameleon who gets tossed into a wild and raucous town in desperate need of a hero. Refreshingly original with eye-popping animation, RANGO is â€œloads of fun and genuinely funnyâ€ (Betsy Sharkey, Los Angeles Times). And now you can get even more RANGO on DVD including a never-before-seen ending, 10 deleted scenes, and much more.
