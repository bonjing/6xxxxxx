,rsl87,2011-08-10T18:52Z,This shouldn't be in the highres category.
,blusniffer,2011-08-13T22:32Z,"Funny how the screens are all ouside daytime shots. All of the torrents for this movie are the same, decent daytime picture but unwatchable night and indoor shots.
And there are lots of these scenes so this is just a reupload of the copy already on the list!!"

,bennjamin,2011-09-08T04:27Z,Could everyone from now on just say whether its legit or good quality. Stop trying to be witty. We don't care if you're funny.
