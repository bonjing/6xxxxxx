Multiple Warheads #1 [Oni Press]
By Brandon Graham (Writer of King City)

Wolf War 3 ended almost 50 years ago and snow has been falling on Dead City for almost as long. A war-torn wasteland that stinks of radiation dust and broken dreams, its the town Sexica and Nikoli call home. But not for long.

Theyre packing up their cyber-organic-hybrid car and hitting the road. Soon maybe all of the pain, mayhem, and space ship crashes that have plagued their lives will be reduced to nothing more than memories.

** As of now it appears only Issue #1 has been released **
