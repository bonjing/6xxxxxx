The LDS Preparedness Manual

I don't think this to be the complete, full manual, that members of LDS have. But, it's pretty darn comprehensive and chock full of useful information.

Please, help keep this seeded... for as long as possible.

Hope you find it useful - and if so - please, give it a + rating. ;)

Enjoy... Namaste
