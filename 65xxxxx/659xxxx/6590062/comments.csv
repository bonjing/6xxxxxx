,DeltaPan,2011-08-08T12:14Z,"Oi, whingeing cur!!!^^

Thought you were leaving TPB in a huff last week.

Please do, don't threaten to leave, just do it, go on, leave, now, just do it, go on!!!

We can all do without your inane comments just because MP4's don't suit you.

Tosser!!!"

,onomanunn,2011-08-08T12:20Z,thnx scene4all as usual for a gr8 torrent
,trh2086,2011-08-09T02:37Z,Seed you greedy bitches! I've been trying to download this since it was uploaded. The highest download rate I've had so far is 100 kB/s. That's much too slow for a 20 Mbps connection. Hopefully the torrent for tonight's episode of RAW won't  have so many leechers.
,DonutKing,2011-08-09T19:20Z,Thank you!!
,princeshrey,2011-08-10T09:12Z,Thanks a lot...!! Tna is far better than WWE wrt Wrestling....!!
,MrUberMex,2011-08-10T13:06Z,"remember guys (and gals) if you don't want to pocket out for a PPV buy a DVD or a hat or t-shirt, TNA/Impact Wrestling is still a very small company every dollar helps, i recommend getting Global Impact 3: TNA vs New Japan from tnaondemand.com it's only $1.99!!!!"
