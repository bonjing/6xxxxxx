subs  ; 10
movie; 10
dark parts are a little to dark so that I have to give a 7
Thanks for it anyway. Just turn of all the lights and it's watchable"
,GLOatPB,2011-09-13T17:19Z,"Very good V quality for a cam! Don't be put off by the first 3 minutes or so, when the camera yet has to adjust its angle. Audio is tops too, so big compliments to the chef!"
,GLOatPB,2011-09-14T02:04Z,"Hmm, I take that back, partly anyway. Cause there are quite a lot of dark parts in the movie and they're quite indiscernable. Pity."
,siiix,2011-09-23T17:57Z,"to many dark scenes , this is not watchable in a CAM version sorry... and audio is not good either... i dont expect to be even stereo... but it sounds like VOIP on dialup

i dont want to be mean but at best :
A:2
V:3 "
,kolin668,2011-10-01T20:21Z,cam always sucks but if you realy want to see it and you got no money for the cinema then it doesn't matter
