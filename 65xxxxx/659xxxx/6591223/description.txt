CD Rip at 320kbps including artwork.

Originally released 1989, this is the Axe Killer Reissue from 2000.

Featuring the formidable vocal talents of one Mark Free (ex King Kobra), SIGNAL's eponymous and sole album 'LOUD & CLEAR' is rightly regarded as a melodic rock/AOR classic that no self respecting fan of the genre should be without. There will, of course, be some who have never picked up this album, and so now would be the perfect opportunity for them to do so... Digitally remastered, this wonderful album - so often sitting at or close to the top of many 'all time best of...'lists - has never sounded better.
