As you may know, I (facanferff) was working in a plugin called WatchTV that would allow
you to stream live TV channels, I announced that development was cancelled due to legal
problems but now I am very happy to release the plugin, I informed since that and obtained
the information that I would not have any problem if I allow the user to use its own XMLs
files with the channels. It means who doesn't have XMLs files hosted in a website (any
website) will not enjoy the plugin since it doesn't bring you any channels, they are added by
yourself or anyone else. All the responsabilities for using an unauthorized stream are yours,
take note of that.
