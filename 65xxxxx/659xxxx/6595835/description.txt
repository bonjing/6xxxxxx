The Red Wing #2 (of 4) [IMAGE]
by Jonathan Hickman, Nick Pitarra and Rachelle Rosenberg

The Red Wing is a troop fighting as part of a Time War. Altering the enemyÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s 
past so as to defeat their present, dealing with a new way of seeing the world. 
It has parallels to the first time man took to the sky in wartime, biplanes 
giving a literal new dimension to warfare and a very new way of seeing the 
world. And so it is here, another dimension to fight in. We meet two different 
generations, the fathers and the sons, both fighting the war, in two separate 
times. We are told that there are no paradoxes and reading the book seems 
pretty simple when you work out the differences between time ships and the 
events being portrayed. And then the beard comes into play, and you realise 
there are lies being told.
