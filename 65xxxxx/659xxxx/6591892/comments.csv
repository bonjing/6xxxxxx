,bonnievilleangel,2011-08-17T00:42Z,".BONE., first let me say, you've become by far my favourite uploader!!!  I'm still new to downloading & have made some silly mistakes along the way but anything with your name on has never been a dud...  I have one dilemma tho, if anyone can help?  I use Windows Media Player to burn to disc which is fine, it works for me...except where files such as this have separate subs files.  When I burn, the movie is fine but the subs don't appear.  If I download hardcoded subbed movies, no problem but perhaps WMP can't/doesn't/won't recognise the subs files.  Any ideas please?  Thanks :-)"
