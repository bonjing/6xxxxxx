,EViLLL,2011-08-09T09:59Z,yeah saw that too... and i got a hunch i know who it is ... 
,irish62,2011-08-11T05:57Z,do they really speak english or is it dubbed?
,arcrendition2,2011-08-16T05:22Z,It says ENG DTS 5.1 so I assume that can't possible be subtitles.
,arcrendition2,2011-08-16T05:24Z,"Oh 'dubbed.""  Well, I can't be sure, google it man.  This money seems pretty weak anyway."
