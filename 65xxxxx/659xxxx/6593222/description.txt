Synopsis   [?]: If you're anal about what gets installed on your computer and
try to keep track of what is installed with software, then you will find
"Ashampoo Uninstaller 4" useful. I used to use "Total Uninstall" and it was
superior at one time, but has fallen behind further and further with each 
release, there hasn't been any major updates in years. Ashampoo has surpassed it 
with new features, improved speed, and overall quality. Ashampoo does a great
job because of it's before/after snapshots. Unlike "Total Uninstall", Ashampoo
scans your entire computer... very similar to "RegShot". Many software vendors
do a crappy job when it comes to installers... i.e. dBpoweramp. their installers
are so shitty, they had to release a separate "clean up" tool, and even that
does not completely clean your system.

* "YOUR UNINSTALLER!" sucks! stay away from that crappy software. It does no
before/after snapshots. It uses Windows' native uninstaller. A complete rip-off!
