The Drifters are a long-lived American doo-wop and R&B/soul vocal group with a peak in popularity from 1953 to 1963, though several splinter Drifters continue to perform today. They were originally formed to serve as Clyde McPhatter's (of Billy Ward & the Dominoes) backing group in 1953.

The comment field in the tag info "Lead Tenor: Clyde McPhatter 2nd Tenor: Charlie White Baritone: William Joseph Lamont Bass: Bill Brown" is taken from the CD comment. Same comment for each track.
According to Wiki there is no information available as to which members performed on which tracks. But liner notes (included) indicates differently. 
"Save The Last Dance For Me" and "I count the tears" is the same as on Ben E Kings album "The Ultimate Collection". The Ben E King album will be uploaded soon, so you can compare for yourselves.
