LOL


@Cucamonga
Thanks. Will seed..."
,GaMeR2K5,2011-08-22T18:57Z,"Yup, I surely agree with you ""ramikaz"". Daniel Craig is the worst actor as James Bond... I prefer the old movies with Sean Connery. :)

But I guess the majority likes the new movies... especially those who hasn't grown up with the older movies. "

Great torrent and videos look as good quality as they can be for their age

Unfortunately you have not included the subtitle files like you have said in your description"
,Cucamonga,2011-08-25T04:32Z,"The subtitles are in MKV file. There are no subtitles files. If you use VLC player, use B to switch audio and V to switch subtitles. If you use Media Player Classic, use A for audio and S for subtitles."
,shpirtshqipe,2011-08-26T17:18Z,"Awesome dude,

Thanks for the subtitle information ;-)

Great Torrent"
