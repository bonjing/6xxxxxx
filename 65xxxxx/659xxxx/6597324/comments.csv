,imob007,2011-08-19T11:58Z,"Hello everyone !!
Game works well but you need to adapt keyboard settings and understand xbox 360 controller to setup your keyboard.
For those that use a PS3 controller her is a merge with XBOX one
XBOX - PS3 
----------         
Y    : â–³ 
B    : ã€‡
A    : X
X    : â˜
LB   : L1
LT   : L2
RB   : R1
RT   : R2

To adapt configuration click right on FIFA11. app and take package contents.
then go to:  drive_c/program files/ea sports/fifa11/game/buttondatakeyboardmouse.ini 
ini file is locked so you need to deblock it.
After some minutes I found out that commands "" VB_AI_"" is to setup controllers in the game and ""VB_FE_"" for controllers in the menu. All info is based on classic controller setup so DONT FORGET TO SELECT THAT ONE TO HAVE SAME INFO.

old FIFA games on PC where automatically setup like this :

D : Shoot
S : Short pass
Q : Lob pass
Z : sprint

didn't remember for other controller so I chooses them :-)  

W : Player run
C : finesse shot
X : pace control

Her is my adapted file :
