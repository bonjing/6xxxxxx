[T],alexisthebest,2011-08-10T07:45Z,"You can google something like ""Install appsync without wifi""

The basic idea you'll get is to download the appsync files, plug in your ipod to your computer and use DiskAid to copy the files to their specific location in the Cydia directory and it'll work.

Again, just google and you can find youtube videos on how to do it."
