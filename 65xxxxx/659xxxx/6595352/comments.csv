,chromepony,2011-08-12T02:37Z,karaokeking123   I'm really enjoying those WW Johnstone books.  Did you see the Iris Johanson books I uploaded?  If you have any others that I don't have I'd appreciate them.  Thanks.  You are great/

I'm sure you get tons of requests each day to upload books, but I was wondering if you happen to have Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us. I have been looking for that book for over four hours straight and can't find it anywhere on the internet. If you can't do it, I understand, but if you can, you will be my hero!!!"
