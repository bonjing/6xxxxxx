,jaska94,2011-09-14T00:27Z,Fuckin hate that cam shit...i have never watched a cam movie over 5 minutes because my eyes start to water ....wtf dont upload that bullshit...i better watch my dog taking crap
,Mr.Bond88,2011-09-19T03:45Z,"For a CAM I am Impressed. 

A: 8
V: 7.8
M: 7 (still more of the original POA's storyline.. we'll see were this one goes)

Ans as far as the Uploader... it still informs us that is is a TS and I appreciate the DVDR versions because its much easier and usually shorter time (seeders depending) then encoding myself so...

Thank You NLUPPER..


the X-men up's really need the subtitles though ;-P "
,kenaiki,2011-09-20T21:15Z,"Kan aan mij liggen, maar ik vond dit echt geen goede versie. Wacht even op een betere, heb meer films van je NLUPPER002 gedownload en de rest was beter ;) thanks anyway, but I'm gonna wait for a better version. "
,Polymathj,2011-10-23T02:23Z,"NLUPPER002, I still don't understand why you put these in the DVDR category?!?  The NL stands for Netherlands I'm sure so English probably isn't you're first language.  

Well, I'll tell you.  A camrip renamed as DVD is not the same thing as DVD (RIP).  You're basically ruining this category by posting all of these - to use a literal term -  fake posts.  I can download a cam and waste my own time re-encoding it to BlueRay but it doesn't make it so.

It may be a technicality but I assure you my Netherlands friend... a DVD Rip, it ain't.

These should be going into the regular ""Movies"" category."
,hyperspeed04,2011-10-27T18:04Z,"ya seriously.. All you wankers bitching about which section these should me in.. DVDR means its READY TO BURN TO DVD.. The title tells you its a TS.. before you bitch, get your terms right. And ya some people want a burnable copy instead of encoding and converting it themselves.. these are in the proper section and NOT mislabled"
,demonoidmaster,2012-01-08T05:11Z,"@hyperspeed04

You're a fucking moron, DVDR (DVD-R) doesn't mean ""Ready to burn to DVD"" faggot, DVD-R means DVD-Recordable. As for DVD-RW means DVD-ReWritable and for DVD-R DL (DL: Double layer). Get your facts straight dumbass.


Now as for this DVD, a fucking Cam recorded video DOES NOT belong in the fucking DVD-R section, even if its converted or fixed up with a menu... this is for LEGIT DVD RELEASED RIPS ONLY. ....Fucking moron"
