From Wiki:

Depeche Mode (pronounced /dÉ¨ËˆpÉ›Êƒ/ dÉ™-PESH) are an English electronic music band formed in 1980 in Basildon, Essex. The group's original line-up consisted of Dave Gahan (lead vocals), Martin Gore (keyboards, guitar, vocals, chief songwriter after 1981), Andy Fletcher (keyboards) and Vince Clarke (keyboards, chief songwriter 1980â€“81). Vince Clarke left the band after the release of their 1981 debut album, Speak & Spell, and was replaced by Alan Wilder (keyboards, drums) with Gore taking over songwriting. Wilder left the band in 1995 and since then Gahan, Gore, and Fletcher have continued as a trio.

Depeche Mode have had forty-eight songs in the UK Singles Chart and #1 albums in UK, US and throughout Europe. According to EMI, Depeche Mode have sold over 100 million albums and singles worldwide,[1] making them the most successful electronic band in music history.[2] Q magazine calls Depeche Mode "The most popular electronic band the world has ever known".








Catching Up With 1985


Catching Up with Depeche Mode is a compilation released only in North America by British band Depeche Mode on November 11, 1985.

As the title suggests it was an attempt to let the (American) public catch up with the band's four previous LP's, by including singles and album songs. The compilation contains the band's singles not already available on the People Are People compilation, as well as the band's two most recent B-sides, "Flexible" and "Fly on the Windscreen".

The compilation is the analog to The Singles 81â†’85 which was released at the same time in Britain, which contained only the band's 7" singles to date.
