This is the first part of the mix,made 4 a cd(80) min-so if u have it in mp3 on a computer u can mix part 1&2 together
made this with lots of mindtwisting and trippy feeling in it,all songs are not orginal!
Tried to get a smooth ride with sometimes hard and annoying sounds 4 your brain,but....not tooo long =)
Want this mix 2 really get a good look into many psychadelic ways and sounds...so relax and float into your mind.
