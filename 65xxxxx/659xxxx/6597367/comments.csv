,raleigh109,2011-08-11T15:49Z,Couple of screen shots would be nice.
,mmd123,2011-08-11T17:28Z,"well seeing as someone just stated that my other torrent DID SUCCESSFULLY work, I think I could upload a few screenshots...the problem is going to be figuring out how to do so...but sure."
,mmd123,2011-08-11T18:19Z,"however, upon going to take screenshots, I just realized that I will need to warn you...I can NOT take a FEW screenshots...due to the way that I have my content organized, it will have to be MANY screenshots...but then again, the more the merrier...

ok, I am working on creating the screenshot gallery right now...so I will post the link, and the rest of the screenshots will shortly follow...

,mmd123,2011-08-11T18:37Z,"aaaand I do believe I have found why one of the sites said something about having to be removed due to a court censorship...soooooo, seeing as to why I think that happened...I'm going to be taking this torrent down now so that I can remove the legally questionable content, and then reupload the torrent once it is legal and I don't get my ass sent to jail... yea, ya gota love pictures with no age listed...for it can sometimes come back and bite you in the ass...soooo, I'm going to take the initiative to fix this before it becomes a problem..."
