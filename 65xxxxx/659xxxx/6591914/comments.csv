,n0trust,2011-08-12T08:27Z,"I wondered why your other torrent for CS5 wasn't working, and I realized that the photoshop I downloaded was CS5.1.
Thank you for this. Worked 100%"
,geoffp,2011-08-13T06:07Z,"My client reports 0 seeds and 0 peers, so can't be downloaded :-("
,geoffp,2011-08-13T07:06Z,"Okay, got it download now - and it worked, but  the program reports the serial number is wrong when trying to login or update. I fear it's going to expire after a month, regardless of the patch."

,tberk,2011-08-14T21:41Z,My 30 days ran out and this code is invalid. I followed the instructions given. 
,Squilbo,2011-08-15T03:29Z,"tberk is correct.  This doesn't work.  It gets past the code part for me, but when I put in an adobe id, it tells me that it it was unable to start my subscription.  There is no option to skip putting in an adobe id.

So once again, this doesn't work."
,evil_cookiee,2011-08-17T19:50Z,"thanks a lot! Btw if you don't want to get the popup from adobe live, just don't let adobe connect to the internet. I think you can adjust that in your antivirusscanner (;"

,pwnwolf,2011-10-24T06:10Z,"For those of you having problems with the Adobe ID, keep trying NEW serials until one is accepted AND the dialog closes. Either use a Keygen or try the ones below (the second one worked for me)

If another section pops up about wanting your Adobe ID then it's the wrong serial! 

(all credit to CooL4o7 who posted these in a comment on another crack for PS CS5) these worked for me"
,Jay1D,2011-10-30T12:59Z,"Worked great, thanks man."
,Klas-Kenny,2011-11-11T17:03Z,"It works a treat, thanks a lot!"
,clearshots,2011-11-23T18:29Z,"at first try it asked for adobe ID authentication and failed. and then the following attemps all asking for an adobe photoshop disc to be inserted in my disc drive. aren;t there any more solution for these? oh, dear...:-("
,21clg,2011-12-17T19:12Z,"@DenyGod (or anybody else)

I searched google for how to disable PS from accessing the internet for updates and lots of them suggested adding stuff to the same hosts file that your directions have us insert stuff into for the crack...

Will they conflict? will one of them cause PS on my comp to stop working free?

they say to add this to hosts file to stop internet updates:
127.0.0.1   activate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1   practivate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1   adobeereg.com
127.0.0.1   www.adobeereg.com
127.0.0.1   adobe-dns.adobe.com
127.0.0.1   adobe-dns-2.adobe.com
127.0.0.1    wip3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1    125.252.224.90
127.0.0.1    125.252.224.91

will they conflict? or does this one and YOURs do the same thing?"

,listenherenow,2011-12-23T23:44Z,"LOL!!!  HOLY SHIT!   I have been pissed ever since I got my shit upgraded to a quad core 64bit system and windows 7 becuase I had to ditch my old school photoshop and I could not figure out how to get anything decoent to work on my new system.   

  I have tried over and over.  I just found this, spent literally 8 minutes, and my shit is working perfectly with no hassels.  ( By the way all your serials are not working, i did go find my own and it's awesome)   only thing is that you have to find a serial.  i found one that worked in less than 1 minute.  with a TOTALY incorrect seial it will have a ' This is Not Valid warning""  BUT  witha serial that is used and blocked it will say it is ok - then it wont work and tells you to close and you will be prompted again - OR contact customer support "
