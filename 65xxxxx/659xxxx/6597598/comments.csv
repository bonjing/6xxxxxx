,potatoechip99,2011-08-11T16:41Z,No this is the one from Olympia in the late 80's/ early 90's.  I'm new at creating torrents and I'm having a hell of a time getting this one to seed.  I've looked at the forum and followed the instructions. 
,potatoechip99,2011-08-11T20:22Z,"Please use this torrent instead: 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6597414/Gravel_Discography 

It seems to be working.  I've tried deleting this one but it's still listed for some reason."
