Laura Wright's story began in 2005 when she won BBC Radio 2's Chorister of the Year and found herself a member of classical girl group All Angels shortly after.  She achieved great success with the vocal quartet; gaining Classical Brit Award nominations, record breaking sales, platinum status and performing in venues such as the Royal Albert Hall and the London's O2.  After three albums, Wright left the group in 2010 and has since been signed as a solo artist under Decca.  Her debut album, The Last Rose, emphasises the fusion of classical and folk music.  Vocally (and to put it simply) Wright has an incredible sound.  Trained as a choirgirl, Wright is not operatic but is not restrained by the traditional choral inflexibility; her tone is appealing and pure, her interpretation expressive and she possesses a wide range which allows for diverse material.
