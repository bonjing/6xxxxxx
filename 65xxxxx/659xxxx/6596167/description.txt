Traitors Return to Earth from Columbus, Ohio are a 4 Piece DIY Psych/Sludge/Doom metal band that play Down-Tempo psych based Sludge/Doom metal. Taking influence from Sludge/Doom/Stoner Metal Bands past and present such as Sabbath, Ramesses, Electric Wizard, YOB, EyeHateGod but bringing their own great take on the genre. Their songs are loud, angry and played to a slow sludge based mid-tempo to superb effect.

Lineup

*Scott Simmons is now a former member.

Review:
Chris superbly handles the vocals - This is old-school Sludge Metal vocals against a backdrop of great modern Stoner/Sludge metal guitar riffs with thick brutal drumming to aid the music along.

This album is simply superb from start to finish. If you are into down-tempo Sludge/Stoner Metal then you will find much to enjoy and discover here time and time again. As I have since I downloaded this brilliant album earlier this week.

Production is superb. Everything is loud and clear from start to finish. There are no flashy progressive Sludge metal riffs here. Just good old-fashioned Stoner/Doom/Sludge Metal riffs that we all know and love.

Check out tracks â€œâ€Black Mercyâ€ and â€œTime Heals No Woundsâ€. Epic tracks from a great band with a bright future.

Highly recommended.
