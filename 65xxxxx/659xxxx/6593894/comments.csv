,osku3000,2011-08-11T00:50Z,What burning software do you use to burn this? I have tried 2 allready and does not work.... :(
,T-Ron,2011-08-11T19:20Z,"Well, you would have to use one that compresses to a single disk (Toast and DVD2One), or burn on a Dual layer disk. Notice that the TS folder here is 4,91 GiB in size, wich exceeds a single layer disks space with over 500 mb."

,osku3000,2011-08-12T17:55Z,"T-ron, thanks,  but I´m not that rookie. I know this is dvd9... And have tried to burn this to DVD9. And have tried to shrink it in to DVD5. But it did not work."
,T-Ron,2011-08-14T00:53Z,"Do you mean it wouldn't burn, or do you mean that the burned disk did not work? Added empty AUDIO_TS folder? Just tryin' to get the details of it. I'll try to burn it myself and get back to ya...."
,T-Ron,2011-08-14T11:21Z,Compressed and burned just fine with DVD2One...
,Lowac,2011-08-15T11:21Z,"My DVD2One v.2 say's: unable to open vobfileset-1 in folder!
Something is wrong here, cant shrink it with DVDshrink 3.2 either."
,finjay,2011-08-15T13:14Z,VTS_01_0.VOB IS MISSING! That's why it doesn't work.
,pedro1234,2011-08-15T19:30Z,The same here: VTS_01_0.VOB IS MISSING!  
,pedro1234,2011-08-15T19:31Z,The same error here: VTS_01_0.VOB IS MISSING!
