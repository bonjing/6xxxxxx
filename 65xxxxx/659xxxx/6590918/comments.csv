,rubberboy37,2011-08-09T20:11Z,Please seed the film so that ereryone can download it and not only you. I seed my torrents for one week and than I remove them from my computer.
,seekereternal,2011-08-10T00:40Z,You're not seeding it at all... uTorrent even with all extra trackers added on shows no seeds
,rubberboy37,2011-08-12T23:39Z,There is enough to shared here but as the downloaders to share too is there no problem.
,N2U4EA,2011-08-13T01:24Z,rubberboy - u said u seed for a week. It is now 8/12 and u uploaded on the 8th (4 days). How long is a week in your country?
,rubberboy37,2011-08-13T13:56Z,"and there no seeders anymore, again. so i remove all the torrents from my computer today."
,rubberboy37,2011-08-13T17:52Z,iedereen die haalt de film binnen maar allemaal te beroerd om de film even te gaan delen? dan deel ik zelf ook niets meer.
