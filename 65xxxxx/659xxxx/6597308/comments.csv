I can start a new game, I see the load screen, but when the game itself starts I only see a black screen with some of the ""ship navigation"" things. But the rest of the screen is black. So it is kind of hard to know what you're doing when you can't see.
I tried switching the resolution and graphics settings but nothing happens. If anyone has a hint on what to do, please tell me."

,ZleepySweden,2011-08-14T11:34Z,"I get the exact same thing as Marv3lboy when trying to play. This is not a good release, sorry. "

,impulseman37,2011-08-16T02:23Z,"Its a very bad port. The game offers and update but it downloads the PC version of the update, how the heck are you supposed to patch with that. I would stay away and not waste your time."

,423132,2011-08-18T10:30Z,i found a fix and ummmmmm all you gotta do is shove a god damn remote of your butthole
,British89,2011-08-18T11:37Z,"The game runs fine untill you LAND, then all hell breaks loose as you cannot see your pirates, they are just a black smudge on the screen......

Its a shame really, I dont feel like playing this on pc :/"
,peaceman150,2011-09-02T08:18Z,"This game need CXEx Carbon engine... That means you need to install the engine.  

open the package of the application and look for the CXinstaller.

From what i know the CX is outdated, so you'll need to upgrade it.
