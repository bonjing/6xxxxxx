Storyline: In the past, the war between humans and vampires has devastated the world. The Church created an elite spiritual warrior organization, dubbed "Priests", who were capable of slaying vampires. The majority of the vampires were killed while the remainder were placed in reservations. The Church created isolated, heavily guarded cities. No longer needing the Priests' services, and fearing their own weapon, the Church disbanded them. Outside the cities humans live free from the totalitarian control of the Church.
