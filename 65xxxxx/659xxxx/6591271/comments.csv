,balanced,2011-08-09T01:10Z,Normally I seed 2:1 but for un-rarred torrents I have begun to delete them as soon as they finish downloading.  There's no need for RAR's with the torrent protocol and maybe others will follow suit until we get a group of people who always strangle these RAR'd torrents which may have been useful on USENET but are absolutely ridiculously useless and a waste of time on the torrent protocol.

I'm with you. RARed torrents get lowest seeding priority given my limited bandwidth.
And torrents which can't even be sorted alphabetically in a torrent program because the torrent name begins with something like [ www.Speed.Cd ]..... once they're downloaded I pretty much just delete them."
