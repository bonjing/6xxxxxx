The Dead Weather Live at Third Man Records

I put this together from various best possible sources over the web, and edited into this Album.  

Anyone wondering the Intro track is Captain Beefheart - Sure \'Nuff \'N Yes I Do,  The Dead Weather often play this as they are walking on stage and I thought it would be a nice addition.

Enjoy
