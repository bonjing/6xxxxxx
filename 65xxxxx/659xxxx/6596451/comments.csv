,wirama,2012-03-25T09:37Z,this is better than the zombie apocalypse genre
,Flex71,2012-04-22T19:46Z,"@wirama

Not sure what you are referring to by zombie apocalypse genre. I hope you're not talking about The Walking Dead, because that show is the best! I rank Falling Skies 2nd though. ;-)

Thanks @Konashine for the excellent torrent."
