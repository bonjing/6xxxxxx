,shesashairy,2012-01-25T01:53Z,Thank you. I will seed as long as poss once I have a copy.  After beating heroin in 99 and realising weed growth was putting hash producers of of business... so they farmed poppies and got militant around 2000 this old crusty (44 soon) chucked out booze and dairy and well a few years late meat after 17 years doh. I admit I thought you were wrong but seeing people die and hurt people or animals gets to you in the end. Wish I'd done it years ago! Plz seed
