,canmethed,2011-08-16T11:06Z,"OK, well why ain't it downloading now, I've tried several times and nothing!"
,DJfwa,2011-09-09T03:10Z,"@aldaron1: Yeh? So? Who wants to download 2gb for the eBook???

Can ANYONE please strip the ebooks out of this and create a separate torrent?
"

Are you using a ten year old torrent client, or something? Pretty much every current client lets you choose to only download specific files from a torrent. It takes all of five seconds in uTorrent to choose ""Select None"", then manually select the ebook file for download. 

I don't think that's too much of a burden, at least not in comparison to asking someone else to put up a new torrent and keep it seeded for an extended period of time."

,aldaron1,2012-03-13T19:51Z,MAVERICK900 will you be uploading the newest book in the series?
,MAVERICK900,2012-03-13T20:13Z,Yes and i will include the ebook that is if i can find it on the web
