use VLC media player (free to download from: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/  )
It can play virtually any video files."
,Brando89,2011-10-01T12:14Z,is it good movie ?
,AlyCatt,2011-10-24T07:10Z,"@Brando89: Watch it and see. The preview looked intriguing. 
@iGabriel88: If VLC doesn't work, which is should, you can also use uPlayer."
,eatmychowder,2011-10-25T01:10Z,"@iGabriel88 - Google CCCP - Combined Community Codec Pack - It has all the codex you need to play various rips within Windows Media Player. - The player is not your problem... its that you dont have the codecs you need! :)
Hope this helps!"
