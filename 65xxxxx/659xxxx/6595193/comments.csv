,GMDFUCKU,2011-08-11T03:45Z,the update gave me some bullshit region erorr
,misssnark,2011-08-11T18:00Z,There's a problem with the crack. The update installs fine but the cracked .exe is the same version as the one that was released with the previous patch.
,latl,2011-08-12T16:21Z,How do I install the update? Never dealt with this kind of file before...
,Rocky23444,2011-08-13T00:06Z,"Indeed, how do I use these kind of files? I can't open them nor mount them."
,Doctor_Whozzat,2011-08-21T01:21Z,"...Has ANYONE got this update up & running?
Because of the 5 negative comments AND the fact that the Game-Box shown is the WRONG game, I'm not so sure I wanna ruin my perfectly running ""Games for the World"" copy, that I enjoy...

++Note:  I did install this patch direct from EA, and used the same crack that came with the original torrent, and it played great..
   The problem came when I tried to save my game..  It wouldn't.
   I'm a newbie to all of this, so not knowing what else to do, I re-installed the original V-1 game.
   Maybe someone out there could explain why this didn't work for me..

  Thanx & Good-luck, everyone~"

,pkfray,2011-08-29T19:30Z,"I installed the patch and crack, the game runs OK but when I click Create Sim it never loads the sim creator and I can't use the preset sims! So the crack is bad!"
