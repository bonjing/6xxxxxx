      I write hoping you are also a big Rachel Maddow Fan.....I so miss them back to back on MSNBC.I've moved to a country place , with zero TV, and for some reason I can't get MSNBC videos to download---logo just sits there spinning slowly.I've not been able to find her show in torrents....any chance you could get it up on TPB?? Thanks so much for Keith.
