,Mentaltown72,2012-02-26T23:59Z,"Worked just fine for 2 weeks until I installed ""Norton Antivirus 360"". After that, Mastercam X4 (this app) would crash when I tried to open it. So.... I uninstalled it, then RE-INSTALLED it.  Now... I get a small window ""pop-up"" that says... 'No SIM found'"
,csa0890,2012-02-27T03:16Z,Ok hopefully someone can help me. I downloaded everything and installed both mcx4 and mu3 i then copied mastercam out of the crack folder and pasted it under C:/mcamx It keeps coming up as No sim found. Any help at all would be much appreciated. Thanks!
