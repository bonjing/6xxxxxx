More than expected

There were not too many negatives that I could find in the movie. Some slight plot holes, but the film and characters make up for it. The chemistry between Franco and Pinto is weak, thankfully Lithgow makes up for the relationship connections with Cox filling some shoes. The journey Caeser takes really connects and you feel his plight.

Albeit you know the chimps are CGI, their eyes look amazing, with depth and personality, and along with their body language and facial animations, you really do forget they are CGI. This film could just ignite a new category for awards, best CGI character actor.

There are moments that are truly gratifying, and Caeser really steals the show with his evolution through out the movie. With moments of thought, heart and action, Rise really hits the mark for the audience it's aiming for.
