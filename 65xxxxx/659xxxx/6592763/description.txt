Notes: This compilation is so vital to any Tuna fan's collection, it is understood why this disc is entitled "Classic". Amazing early acoustic material that would have never seen the light of day it wasn't for the amazing Relix label. There is a "Classic Electric" companion disc to this release and it is also essential for true fans. If you love the sound of a guitar - you MUST get turned on to Jorma sometime soon. These albums will do it.
