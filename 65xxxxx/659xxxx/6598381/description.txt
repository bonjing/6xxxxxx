Heal Your Back is a complete program for understanding the causes of lower back pain, the ways to prevent it, and the treatments to eliminate it. The book educates readers about all aspects of back pain and shows them how to create their own personalized "prescription" for alleviating the pain and preventing further back problems. While other books recommend a specific type of treatment, Heal Your Back includes exercises and nutrition advice, and information on chiropractic therapy, acupuncture, medicines, and surgery. Dr. Borenstein's self-care program allows sufferers to control their own recovery while evaluating all the possibilities for therapy.
