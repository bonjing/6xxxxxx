How do you make the point that the iPhone has changed the
world? The easy answer is â€œuse statisticsâ€â€”70 million sold,
250,000 downloadable programs on the iPhone A pp Store, 5 billion
downloadsâ€¦ Trouble is, those statistics get stale almost before youâ€™ve
finished typing them.
Maybe itâ€™s better to talk about the aftermath. How since the iPhone came
along, cell carriers (AT&T, V erizon, and so on) have opened up the calcified, conservative way they used to consider new cellphone designs. How every phone and its brother now have a touchscreen. How BlackBerry, Palm Pre, Google (Android) phones, and even Windows Mobile phones all have their own app stores. How, in essence, everybody wants to be the iPhone.
The thing is, theyâ€™ll never quite catch up, because A pple is always moving,
too. I n June 2010, for example, it introduced the fourth iPhone model,
the iPhone 4. I tâ€™s slimmer, narrower, faster, cooler-looking. I t also has a few
new features, including a screen with better contrast and four times the
sharpness, a better camera (with a flash), a second camera on the front for
making free video calls, a longer-life battery, and so on.
More importantly, thereâ€™s a new, free version of the iPhoneâ€™s software,
called iOS 4. (Why not â€œiPhone O Sâ€ anymore? Because the same operating
system runs on the iPad and the iPod Touch. I tâ€™s not just for iPhones
anymore.)
