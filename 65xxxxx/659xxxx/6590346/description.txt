another fresh new build of vlc player 1.2.0-git from today : August 8
not official yet and delivered as untouched for internal testing purpose...
Still as beta so might be a little bit buggy again also.
Note : to ATI/AMD users
the very latest catalyst 11.6b should normaly resolve the well known bug on vlc
player 1.1.10 and recent builds as well
i suggest you all to update to this very latest driver so.
Note :
how to sucessfully install this version of vlc :
at first,uninstall any previous version and completely delete your own settings and cache folder as well.
secondary : when you will install any new version,then proceed by the same way also :
delete all personal settings and cache folder and check while installing new version if you get a crash with cache-gen.exe
sometimes,this last one can completely crash.
This problem is normaly completely resolved now anyway.
However,if you get any problem,please,post here and i will try to help you so.
Btw,auto update checking option does not work anymore with this kind of vlc's version so uncheck : allow checking for VLC updates.
that's why i bring you a new build from so.
seed with me asap to the others,please,just for a moment or more.
ty for understanding
enjoy and have fun
regards
