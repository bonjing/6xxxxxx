This is a web browser designed by me to be very fast at browsing and downloading from the web. also contains other applications built in like notepad, photo viewer, GIF image viewer, mp3 player, swf player and even a text to speech convertor.

if you need any help, have ideas, improvements or if you find any errors, please email me at ben.steele33@gmail.com.

File is 18M in size.

This is my second version now called benz web browser 1.9. I have now fixed the script error problem from version 1.8 and the browser now has keyboard shortcuts.

The link below is for the older version.
