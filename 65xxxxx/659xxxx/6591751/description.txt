Game created by Aaron Bishop;

"Lords of Uberdark (tentative title) is a 3D mining & building game that I'm currently writing, much like Infiniminer and its more prominent cousins. It's still in an early stage of development (pre alpha), but already has most of the core functionality and a handful of features that set it apart -- especially smooth terrain and cartoon-style rendering. It also does nice texture blending, animated water, raytraced lighting, random terrain generation, ore veins, and a bunch of other stuff."

"Funding will help me to spend less time on work-work and more time on game-work, which will translate into a quicker release and better end product."
