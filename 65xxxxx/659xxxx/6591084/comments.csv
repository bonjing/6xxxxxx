,sweetchuk,2011-08-09T08:44Z,"@alfa57 - Currently there are over 85 peers off a single seeder - myself - and 70% of those are either not sharing with peers, or are limiting their sharing to the slowest speed.

I repeat that I will seed this non-stop for a month or so, and review participation after that time to see if it is worth continuing to support the torrent.  
I'd hoped others would be more generous with their sharing / seeding with this, but looking at their peer d/l amounts vs their share speed and there is definite room for improvement.

Hopefully as more people claim more of the torrent, the speeds will certainly improve, but for now, there's thee & me and as I have already said, I will seed this non-stop for at least a month or so. Cheers. :)"

,sweetchuk,2011-08-11T16:13Z,"Hi all,

I've ripped the Hit Single Whispering Grass from my DVD Complete Collection, and it features the Sgt Major & Lofty singing it.

The mini-torrent can be found here - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6597569

The song was a No.1 hit in 1975 believe it or not, and is nearly impossible to find. It is ripped to the best DVD quality possible, so I hope you enjoy it and please give a thought to seeding so other might enjoy it also.

Cheers :)"
