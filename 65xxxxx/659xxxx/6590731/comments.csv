[T],User_01,2011-08-08T20:39Z,"English.

""... uploading same file again for some reason""

The reason: It is the ""Enhanced Edition"", version 2.0. Can you read? 

If you already found it here, could you show me please, ... if not shut the fuck up and let others download, if you don't want to bother doing so."

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5148346/Gothic_3_With_all_updates_to_Enhanced_Edition

others I had tried were Multi5 but default to Italian. and yes Loser_01, little fuck, i know it's the ""enhanced edition"". same as the others.

remembered this game as being pretty good but even if it is Enhanced it looks and plays like shit nowadays. things've definitely changed in the last 5 yrs."
[T],User_01,2011-08-08T22:37Z,"""Loser_01""???

You are clearly a very NOOB person when it comes to the Gothic game series.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_(series)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_3:_Forsaken_Gods

THIS IS 
!!GOTHIC 3 !FORSAKEN GODS! ENHANCED EDITION!! (a.k.a Version 2.0) which was realeased in March 2011 by Mad Vulture Games
(the parch version 2.0)

Now, BIGGER FUCK go to your cave from where you came from and, like i said SHUT THE FUCK UP if you don't know what you're talking about.

AGAIN (maybe is hard to understand for a -1 fuck like you):
1. Gothic 1
2. Gothic 2
2,2 Gothic 2 Night of the Raven
3. Gothic 3
3.1 Gothic 3 Enhanced Edition (your links)
3.2 Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods - 2008
3.3 Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods - 2011 Enhanced Edition (2.0)
4. Gothic 4
4.1 Gothic 4 Fall of Setariff

I don't even understand why an idiot like you is interested in a game like this. Go play CS with your other ""pals"".

Who's the loser now?"
[T],User_01,2011-08-09T12:11Z,"... thought so ... (what?! no snappy response)

Now that the ""Stupid Goblin"" is back in his cave, for others, that wish  to make themselves look idiotic like him, i just wanna quote the ""smart ones"": [FIRST] ""Make yourself useful morra!"", and then post unecessary comments.

Peace."
,enterthehole,2011-08-09T19:58Z,"Thanks for the upload. Works great on win7 64 bit, and after an hour or so gameplay, no bugs ! :)"
[T],User_01,2011-08-10T00:18Z,"You're welcome. But the best ""thanks"" is seeding (at least 1.5 ratio), so others can enjoy what you are thankful for. That's what torrents are all about. Here at piratebay no one is forced to seed with completing a requested ratio or so (there are other sites for that). It's just common sense. Either you are grateful and pass forward, what you've liked, or just hit and run. But, i guess, that's just my opinion and it doesn't have to be for others as well."
,Doomext,2011-08-12T07:39Z,"I seed 100%, No more, No less."
,Doomext,2011-08-12T07:44Z,Wait a minute... 8m piece size? TELL ME HOW YOU ACHIEVED THIS FEAT!
[T],User_01,2011-08-12T14:31Z,"Using uTorrent 3.0 to create the torrents, nothing special.

Like i've said, it's up to you how much you want to seed. It's not for me, since i already have the ""file"". (Logic)."
,zops031,2011-09-16T22:14Z,"i now downloading the game pls more seeds
i love this site but im registered today and how i give seeds for this game(if I may add seeds?????)"
[T],User_01,2011-09-17T14:48Z,"seeder = 1 who has downloaded the ""file"" - 100%
leecher = 1 who is still downloading

to seed = leave the torrent open after has finished downloading (100%)
to seed from another location (other computer) = copy the downloaded file to that computer, download the torrent from this site (or others), open it in the torrent client and specify the exact location where the file is; itâll check and then seed (the copied file must be the ones specified in the torrent = matching)"
,ljubec,2011-09-19T15:32Z,do u need crack for this or something like that??And tell me did they make better combat moves than gothic 3...:)
[T],User_01,2011-09-19T18:49Z,"1.unrar
2.mount image
3.install
4.update to v2.0
5.PLAY
I suppose they are pretty clear and simple instructions. But, to answer your question, No.

In my opinion even with the patch is still below Gothic 3 Enhanced Edition. This game (Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods) was doomed form the start. This happens when you are doing things in rush, just to capitalized on something that started beautiful, then gone downhill. Gothic 1&2 still the best."
,ljubec,2011-09-20T13:54Z,"yea...Gothic was my first rpg game... I played it long time ago...I was fascinated cuz u could do anything u want...after that I fell in love with Gothic and rpg games...I played Gothic 1-3 and I can say the best part is 2,than 1,than 3,I haven't played 4 cuz my PC is crap...xD...Thx for upload btw..:)"
[T],User_01,2011-09-20T16:39Z,"If liked Gothic games, then you could also try Risen (if you never heard of it). It got something from Gothic games.

,Salve92,2011-09-20T23:13Z,"I'm pretty new to the whole Gothic thing. Is this Gothic 3 with the extras, or is it just the add-on?"
[T],User_01,2011-09-20T23:39Z,"Gothic 3
Gothic 3 Enhanced Edition

Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods (2008)
Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods Enhanced Edition (2011)

Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods/Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods Enhanced Edition (with patch version 2.0) - is a standalone (doesn't need Gothic 3/Gothic 3 Enhanced Edition installed) expansion pack (adds continuity to the story of Gothic 3/Gothic 3 Enhanced Edition)

For Gothic 3 Enhanced Edition (with all the patches) look at post #2"
,Salve92,2011-09-21T23:33Z,"OK, one more question. Do I need to unrar all the folders, or is just one fine?"
,darkdodge,2011-10-21T18:14Z,"Good job User_01, don't pay attention to these idiots here. I've already finished Gothic 3 for a few times and been waiting for this since it was announced.
Vanilla FG was really bad. I hope it is playable now..."
