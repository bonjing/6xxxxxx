,tpbl,2011-08-09T19:25Z,"iMzdl uploaded it on 29th jul 11
along with iCloud beta 5"
,cromwelld,2011-08-10T06:33Z,"@tpbl...  This version (11C35) was just released.  The version released prior, although 10.7.2, was a different build."
,pryingeyes,2011-08-10T08:50Z,"It's important to note what this is, and what it is not.  This is an updated dev release, but not a true, mass-released update to Lion Specifically, this includes updates to Cloud, and to Safari giving it access to cloud. It does NOT include any updates to Lion beyond that; that is, it does not address the relatively few and minor fixes that clearly need to be addressed, and that surely will be in general release 10.7.1. So -- if you want to play with Cloud, on a dev level, then DL this. Otherwise, wait for the mass release of 10.7.1 for general fixes and improvements to 10.7. It is possible, though not likely, that installing this update will prevent installation of 10.7.1 when it is released."
,mrulrich,2011-08-10T12:52Z,"pryingeyes: According to a bunch of forum posts it also fixes the video-freeze issue in 10.7(.0) even though apple haven't admitted it.

I know it did for me atleast."
,mariuspmg,2011-08-11T11:57Z,doesn't work on 10.7.2 (11C26)
,cromwelld,2011-08-11T12:53Z,"@mariuspmg ...  Sure it does, you just need the reversioner package..."
,cromwelld,2011-08-11T13:07Z,"Reversioner package here
http://www.freakgeeks.com/2011/13147/apple-releases-mac-os-x-lion-10-7-2-build-11c35-direct-link/"
,cromwelld,2011-08-11T13:12Z,Verified reinstaller package downloaded from above link and 11c35.  Both installed and work correctly.
,mariuspmg,2011-08-12T07:46Z,@cromwelld: thanks!

,brovius,2011-08-17T09:19Z,"I hope installing this on top of 10.7.1 public release will work.
*crosses fingers

Will post if anything new"
,cameronmalek,2011-08-17T16:50Z,Can anyone upload 10.7.2 build 11C37? What about iCloud beta 7?
