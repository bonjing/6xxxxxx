Considered to be the most daring and honest film adaptation of any of Miller's works, Thorsen's 'Quiet Days In Clichy' is a provocative and graphic exploration of sexual liberation, inventively and innovatively directed on location in Paris. Highlighting the film's beautiful monochrome visuals (Paris has rarely been shot with such affection) is a soundtrack of suitably ribald songs by the legendary Country Joe McDonald.

Adapted by Danish filmmaker Jens JÃ¸rgen Thorsen from Tropic Of Cancer author Henry Miller's equally controversial book, 'Quiet Days In Clichy' charts the decadent, erotic Parisian odyssey of two hedonistic bohemians Joey (Paul Valjean) and Carl (Wayne Rodda). Penniless but hopeful, struggling writer Joey and his roommate Carl spend their days and nights trawling the clubs, cafes and streets of Paris pursuing the carnal charms of the city. Their endeavours result in a series of wild orgies and outrageous erotic adventures with an endless parade of wanton women, including a stoned neighbour, various prostitutes, a teenage runaway nymphomaniac and a beautiful but reluctant Scandinavian.
