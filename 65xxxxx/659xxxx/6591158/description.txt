This is a collection of 330 photos from World War 2 of British, American, German, and Russian military troops and equipment (almost all are from the European Theater of Operations). Includes Navy, Army, and Air Force pictures. I tried to get a good variety of equipment and locations. None of the photos are graphic in nature. I gathered them from the internet over the course of several months. This group of photos was my desktop slideshow for several months, and I enjoyed them enough that I wanted to share them.
