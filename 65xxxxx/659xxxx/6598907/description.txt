Six years of footage of moot, from the awkward weeaboo we saw in 2005 to the Canvas-obsessed normalfag we see today. This collection covers everything from the 4chan Otakon Panels to SXSW 2011 to the Time 100 (aka the good, the bad and the ugly). This random assortment of primary sources is probably the closest we're probably ever going to come to a moot documentary. You should really read the text file in the torrent for more detailed information.

If a significant amount of new material arises, then this torrent will be updated and marked with an appropriate version number. This includes moot making more media appearances, moot or other mods holding an official 4chan panel ever again or higher-quality of existing events footage appearing.
