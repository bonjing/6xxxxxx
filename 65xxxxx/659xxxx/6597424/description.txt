Eight of these 24 tracks come from an April 1966 session and were originally released on LP (on Arhoolie); the other 16 are previously unissued, five of them sourced from April 1966, the rest from 1960. It's entirely typical of Mance Lipscomb's output: versatile, relaxed, and samey-sounding acoustic blues with some prominent ragtime and folk influences. The 1960 material doesn't boast fidelity as strong as the 1966 takes (though it's certainly adequate), and has more of a down-home flavor; the 1966 tracks sound more innocuous and front-porch-relaxed by contrast.
