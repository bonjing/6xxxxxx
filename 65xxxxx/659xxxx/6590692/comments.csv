Thanks!"

,Aciaeiig,2011-08-13T15:34Z,Works like a charm! And there is even the plugins ive looked for! Thanks man!
,Selkati,2011-10-28T23:13Z,"Torrent loaded very fast.

My firewall asked if I should let it connect to the internet. Since many programs do this to verify authenticity, I didn't know what to do and ended up giving it a go.

If anything goes wrong, I'll post back here (or maybe someone else will post before I do)"
