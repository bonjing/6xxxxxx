This is Anton Chaitkin\'s shocking book Treason in America - From Aaron Burr to Averell Harriman (1984) which explains in detail how British financial institutions, funded an American aristocracy in the early 1800\'s. This British-American aristocracy along with European intelligence services did what the British military could not: return America to the British-European circle of influence. Chaitkin grabs the Eastern Establishment by the tail, and uncovers the real basis for its \"tradition\" - the murderous, thieving tradition that has characterized oligarchical families from Rome to Britain. Everything evil in America, from Aaron Burr to Henry Kissinger, is a product of America\'s oligarchical \"first families.\" Treason in America discusses some of the American presidents that were either murdered or died under highly suspicious circumstances while in office. During this same time span how many English, French or German heads of state have met the same fate? In this respect sitting American presidents have been treated no better than any other colonial puppet. It\'s all about a European ruling elite that has never abandoned the feudal way of life. The enslavement of the many by the few, politically and economically, is not a new age concept. When you read this fascinating book you will join a small fraternity of folks who are armed with a fresh point of view, one far different from what is taught in America\'s schools and universities. The material presented comes from the public record, but here it is excavated and arranged to reveal a pattern of treachery lurking beneath the surface of familiar historical events. 345 pages, few pictures. A must read for everyone.
