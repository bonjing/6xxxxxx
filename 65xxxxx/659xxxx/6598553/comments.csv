[V],Anacondaz,2011-08-14T08:28Z,block the application from going online
,kimage93,2011-08-14T11:10Z,"Hi evryone,
i block the software with little snitch,
but after few minutes, propresenter ask me
my User pw (the password you have with your account in mac os X). even if i deny authorisation
Pro presenter tells me that it has detected an illegal serial number, and it shut down.

Any solutions ?

Thanks"
[V],Anacondaz,2011-08-19T03:35Z,"  Use our keymaker to register the application.                                                                                               â–“â–ˆ
  You have to block the application from phoning home with firewall or Little Snitch.                                           â–“â–ˆ

  If you got ""-"" in the ID code field(you can see the ID code in       
  ""Menu > Registration..."" after registered with the license key       
  first, aka you don't have to worry about ID code if you are          
  trying to get a ProPresenter 4 license), just try to use another     
  SN and it will be fixed. If you are a hackintosh user, you may       
  get wrong length of your ID code, there's no fix to that, you        
  have to fix your machine serial number before you can use the        
  module license key. If you still get timebomb, that means te name    
  you use is in the bloacklist or the version you use banned the       
  new prefix(PRL41).                                                   

  Accepted name characters: A~Z, a~z, ""-"", ""_"", ""\"", ""&"", ""."", "",""    
  and space. must have at least 5 characters that's between A to z.   "
,kimage93,2011-08-20T14:20Z,"You mean that the number generated by the keygen is wrong ? it's in the blocklist of the software editor ? i don't really understand, i use little snitch and the firewall to block everything.
even offline, computer not connected to internet there's still the same problem.
the problem is in the dmg of propresenter inside the torrent ?

Thanks 4 ur answer.

ciao"
,Karbona,2011-08-29T10:43Z,I have the same problem. I think that this is connected with the updating of the Lion
,craig907,2012-02-15T20:38Z,"I keep running into the same issue. Little Snitch is running and ProPres will begin, but 10 seconds in it will ask for MacOSX admin password and again 5 seconds later followed by ""An illegal registration code was detected. ProPresenter will now shut down."" 

Thoughts?"
,teckkk,2012-02-19T06:02Z,"Damn... :( it works when you use ""demo"" and then register, after some tries, it does not close, and you can work, but if you close the program you have to do it all over again :(:("
,Jafooli,2012-03-28T21:21Z,Ahh is there a Windows version please?
