CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D

Source: DVDScr DVD-R

Encode:

here is my approach on that dvd. a bit late but i have to work during the week and i cant do all at once :P
The DVD itself had a weird interlace, and two watermarks, also it was very dark and the aspect is wrong in some places. The Audio is wav-track inside and was too loud on various places which caused audio to overload.
All in all a good version to start but needed a lot of work to do.
Firstly i had to remove that interlace.
Tried two methods- the first leaves the video a lot sharper but lots of interlaced frames were left and were annoying during watching, so i used the secure method which removes it for good, looks better this way.
fixed the ar slightly to find a good middleway on all parts.
Now to the watermarks, the H.Stern watermark on the right upper corner was easy to blur, hardly visible now.
The bottom company logo filled the whole screen, leaving it there was annoying, blurring it completely looks terrible.
Since the logo is right at the bottom i decided to slighlty crop a couple lines and just blurr the rest that was reaching out.
Seems like the best possible solution for that problem.
For the darkness i made a complete new project to bring hsv back to standard levels. 
looks perfect now on all scenes at daylight and helped a lot for darker scenes too.Still the last part around the alien and the ship needs additional work so i cut it in parts and worked on that part again to maximize quality.
Audio needed cleaning for all kind of noise and overloading, fixed that too.
Finally everything is in place and will definately do till the retail
