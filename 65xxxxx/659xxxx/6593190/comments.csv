,kian89,2011-08-09T18:42Z,so albert are you going to do small m4v rips in future ??
,albert2172,2011-08-09T19:27Z,"I am going to do both 

Handheld and HD encodes. 

I need your help to seed though as my computer is encoding and seeding at the same time. I dont have money for a seedbox so all i use is my computer.

Be patient and seed please. Help My PC out :)

,kian89,2011-08-09T21:21Z,"I'll Seed man
you just bring on the new stuff and classics as well
also try to do TV shows.
i'll spread the word
and i'll seed your stuff, i have connection with unlimited usage,seeding is no problem for me .
you just start the thing..
Ceers to thhe new beginnings ."
,albert2172,2011-08-10T01:01Z,"Thanks :) Im seeing how things are going to work and i already have some uploads penning after there are enough seeds. But also need time and download speed to get new stuff for you guys.

Enjoy. 

Please comment on quality so I can know if every upload is of great quality as HR."
,kian89,2011-08-10T09:42Z,"Oh and one more thing , i dont know about 720ps, but please try to encode (PiZ) m4vs in smallest file size as possible. HR's encodes were a lil larger.
smaller file size makes it easier to download and upload as well"
,mallickabbas,2011-08-10T16:30Z,@ albert2172 plz plz do Game of Thrones handheld version from the highres version uploaded by HR.
,ScubaSteve5678,2011-08-10T22:42Z,"@albert 
if you want to help me on how to encode I will gladly help you with the process I can do a bit of seeding as well"
,albert2172,2011-08-10T23:30Z,"@ScubaSteve5678 

Its not hard to encode. Just getting new material and at the same time uploading will mean that you guys will get really slow download speed. What I really lack of is a seedbox.

At the moment  i am downloading and im going to upload new encodes by tomorrow for sure but see i still need for there to be enough seeders or else its a dead torrent. 

enjoy upload for now m8."
,kian89,2011-08-11T16:17Z,ha ha this torrent is off of ur plate now.. bring on some new stuf man .. ive got my eyes on you...
,ScubaSteve5678,2011-08-12T04:08Z,"Albert
Any chance at all we can get a Hi res copy of anchorman i think many people will agree with me that it is probably one of the funnier movies I've been waiting forever for someone to do a copy of this if you can I will seed it and other movies for a long time
Thanks"
