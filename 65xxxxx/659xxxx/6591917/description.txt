hi,welcome to version 6 of my Win7PE_SE project!!This version is is the most functional PE(preinstalled environment)live system that i could build,The.iso is huge by live disc standards so you will need at least 1GB ram MINIMUM!!4Gb ram ir recommended.just burn the iso to disk using imageburn or simillar and boot it!will run from a properly forrmatted usb stick for totally portable windows7:-)boot ant host system,or boot this one and browse the host system without traces or need for logon password etc.comes with all apps needed for everyday tasks such as utorrent3.0,peerblock,firefox8,IE8,Avs Video converter,truecrypt7.0.,java 1.6.0.10,2005/2008 runtimese/auslogic disk defrager,DeepBurner,has a windows startup recovery,and a host of windows features including ISCsI initatior,Remote desktop connection,and i even threw a few games in for the challenge of it lol!
    Drivers!
Driver integration has been challenging,choosing driverpacks and trying to balance widespread functionally for maximum ammount of computers,against keeping the size of the build down....has been difficult,all you need to know is that if you look in the Drivers Folder in the start menu(there are two)you will find driver install packs to run (realtekHDMI,Dell lan/Wlan\Wireless,IntelWireless\Connexant,and many others)the utilities named PnPUtil net,and PnPUtil full,will scan and load all drivers from the host comps systems,so mostly thats all youll need:-)I chose the install pack option for the sake of making future builds more modular and easy to leave in/out Driver packs as necessary,ant to keep the initial boot up time as short as possible.If you have any requests for specific drivers for the next version?....post them here...enjoy and please whine\comment\congratulate\ask questions\rant like a nut....i enjoy the feedback and suggestions.....redback38:-)......oh and please seed!
