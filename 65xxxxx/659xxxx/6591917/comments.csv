That way you don't have to add driver packs and can keep the disc to under 700Megs - not all systems have DVD drives or can boot from USB (like the ancient creaking CPUs they have at my work place).

Just a thought.  Thanks for your efforts, BTW.  Innovation is always a good thing. :-)"
,dee_mer80,2011-08-09T06:53Z,"thanks for inserting my Dell drivers...downloading now and will seed
when finished!...can 1 gig ram will work with this?"
,redback38,2011-08-09T07:00Z,"once again your levity carries weight,....the PnPutil section does grab all local drivers,but takes a few minuites to do it,(more setup time)but most of requested drivers are for various wi-fi devices,not all are included in the win7 seven packs,so i dropped a bunch in,but ill keep that in mind @DearthBubba....ill TRY to knock one out under 700 MB for you my friend,:-))thank you:-) "
,redback38,2011-08-09T07:03Z,"@Dee_mer....one gig is the limit i could push it to on a virtual machine.....not making any promises lol....might fly for ya....might not...its 60mb under the threshold so let me know.....im currently working on getting a simillar system under 700 mb,squeeze........squeeze.....squeeze....."
,mbmalone,2011-08-09T18:56Z,I have been waiting so .... long for this. Downloading now. I don't think the others know how hard it is to build one of these that work properly ...........  thank you redback38
,DarthBubba,2011-08-10T04:14Z,"redback38 said:""most of requested drivers are for various wi-fi devices,not all are included in the win7 seven packs""

Aren't they already on the system HD?  PnPutil would find them, wouldn't it?

Anyway, I look forward to your next version(s)!

Best - DB"
,redback38,2011-08-10T06:34Z,"@darthBubba.....PnPutil should pick up all the drivers you need.....HOWEVER......MbMalones intel5100 wlan driver doesnt come with the win7 package,neither does wlan drivers for dell1397 compatible series,or most broadcom wlan drivers either dont get picked up,or arent installed with a win7 install.and some ppl running this on an xp host system will find the host drivers are not compatible because this release is built from a windows7 sp1 disk and the waik3.0.so iv thrown in a few wlan packs and some realtek HDMI drivers for audio to get HD audio up and running for users running this on top of xp hosts...and yes i should tell ppl to find thier own driver packs and have them on a usb stick along with this .iso so they can install them for thier own use,....but im just an old softie that likes to please..."
,redback38,2011-08-10T07:02Z,"oh and darthBubba?.....version 7 will be well under 700 MB,so all those""creaking,ancient,CPUs,that dont have DvD drives,or USB booting""can have a system that will run on minimum ram,driver packs will NOT be included in the boot.wim,but placed on the disk instead,saves .wim size,and boot time,thus ppl can choose different individual packs off the disc to get thier exact requirements met for thier individual hosts if the host doesnt have the drivers needed for the extra goodies(wi-fi devices mostly) to run....:-)that way,requested drivers can be added or left out by myself with minimum fuss for me during the build...."
,mbmalone,2011-08-10T23:35Z,"The build is working fine, but missing audio on the two dells I tried it on. I think they use intel audio, not sure? Optiplex 745 and D610. I haven't tired it on my HP yet, but I know the HP drive you have included works in the PE, if you install it to X instead of C. Wireless is working .... with my 2 driver pack dropins, I have audio working on all 3 computers. I can send you a link with my latest 2 drop-in drivers. I think the standard audio plugin and directx is required. I updated them recently. I can send."
,redback38,2011-08-11T01:28Z,"by all means send em to my email:-) im having great trouble getting directx 11 or 10 to play ball at the moment,it goes in the build easy as,but i wanted to get MAME32(ClassicArcadeGames from the 80s)but keep getting a direct draw error,tried crazy taxi too,same problem.tried reinstalling or updating directx,other gpu drivers,nothing seems to work,im thinking its a lack of available memory,im new to tinkering with directx so its a steep learning curve,send em anyway,ill see if directx will work with em,if they slip in ok?they will appear in version 7:-)and thank you:-)"
,mbmalone,2011-08-11T01:46Z,"I figured out how to add wireless drivers to Hiren's bootcd, easy!  Download Win XP x86 WAN/LAN drivers from driverpacks.net or wherever to your harddrive. Extract them, you know. Boot with Hiren's and you will see a couple of .uha files LAN/WAN made by Hiren. Copy them over to your harddrive and extract them out. Hiren has already included the utility he used, so the files are associated with it already. Just click on them and choose to extract them with the utility. Use the same utility to repack them. I mean, you need to have just the two archives and keep the names the same. When that's done, boot back into winblows and use UltraISO to inject these two files on top of the two smaller ones that Hiren included, replacing them. Same file names, same location !!!  Burn the ISO and when you start PENetwork the drivers will all unpack and start automatically, as if they were originally included by Hiren. Yes, the driver search will search all the subdirectories and it works !!!!"
,redback38,2011-08-11T10:23Z,"@mbmalone....awesome shit man....im heartily impressed,im pretty flat out,but when i get a moment ill have a bash at it....im about to sort out a multiboot setup,with a bunch of different rescue packages(acronis2011,hirens14,one of my pe frankensteins,and possibly DaRT65 as well....so thatll come handy thanks:-)!!!"
,mbmalone,2011-08-13T08:00Z,"Williams Arcade Classics, can you get that on the PE for when I'm fighting spyware and the scan is running ............  Defender !!!"
,redback38,2011-08-13T17:31Z,realy? williams?....cool ill give that a try too!...id like to add some classics to the new version:-)
,redback38,2011-08-13T17:50Z,bloody hell....cant find a copy of williams arcade classics...Mbmalone?...do you know where i can find a copy?....
,mbmalone,2011-08-13T19:04Z,"Your PE changed my PC clock to the Outback timezone or something? I think there is a script to keep the local timezone so it doesn't happen. I'm sure you were not affected. Golden Outback, WTH? I will try to find the greatest arcade game collection of all time. It's DOS, can you make it work? "

,mbmalone,2011-08-13T19:39Z,"@redback38
The classics are like the ""the precious"". Very difficult to find. If you follow this post, you can obtain a windows ISO through these links. http://snesorama.us/board/showthread.php?t=40691"
,redback38,2011-08-14T07:59Z,"awesome much appreciated!....i have a script that gives 16 bit DOS support to the build so im hopin i can get it goin,direct draw errors are very very common when dealing in graphics,mainly through lack of available ram to run graphics cards needed...thank you also for the links....im starting version in a few days,im on halidays in europe at mo but will have LOTS of time on the way home for some mile high scripting lol!..:-)"
