,rusho606,2011-08-11T10:35Z,Thanks for the UL pal..btw do any of U intend to upload ultimate spider-man 161/162?
,plattekak,2011-08-11T13:23Z,sure when i get my hands on it i'll try and bring it out ;)
,plattekak,2011-08-11T13:30Z,rush606 it seems to be that marvel will not be pushing 162/161 they seemed to have merged it in the fallot series (reffering to fallout 1 and 4)

,MuserClair,2011-08-12T02:22Z,"alt dl for this comic here...

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6596498/Ultimate_Fallout__5

it's a folder of jpegs, but renumber the jpegs so they display in correct page number order, save in a rar, and then open the rar with cdisplay, and it's all good :-)

And thanks again anyway for the ul, plattetak :-)"
,blakiki,2011-08-16T05:18Z,can some one please seed?
,Tinny_pb,2011-08-20T14:25Z,"No, it seems no-one can. Try this torrent instead:
https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6616534/ULTIMATE_FALLOUT___01-06_%28_COMPLETE_%29"
,Tinny_pb,2011-08-20T14:27Z,"I take that back... the torrent I linked above is one RAR, not 6 separate files. So if you only want #5, look elsewhere."
