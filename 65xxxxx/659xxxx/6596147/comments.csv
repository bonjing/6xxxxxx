 Success Is Certain!!!"
,Sepideh,2011-09-19T16:39Z,First of all the album title is Success Is Certain. Not Royce.Da.5'9-Success.Is.Certain-(Deluxe.Edition)-2011-[NoFS]. Secondly it's Fast Lane. Not Fastlane. And that song shouldn't even be on this album (unless it's a deluxe thing)! And if we would care who produced the song we would just look it up on Wikipedia or something!
,ADNC,2011-09-23T20:10Z,@Sepideh...wow does being a dick pay well?  who the fuck care the amount of information the uploaded gives you should be kissing his stones for the UL in the first place....
,Sepideh,2011-09-26T21:36Z,"@ADNC Yes, you're right. I had a bad day and was just annoyed by everything. I'm sorry for that. All cred to the uploader."
