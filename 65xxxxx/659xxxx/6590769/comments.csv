Goes in & out of focus throughout movie however it is in frame and the audio is synced well with the video. If you're determined to see this movie, then it's watchable. If not, it would be best to wait for a better release. Your call."
,ThatOneGirl2,2011-08-08T17:12Z,Thank you for this..but I have one question. Why is sample2regcam a much better quality then the actual movie or sample1?
,ThatOneGirl2,2011-08-08T17:19Z,Nevermind It is the same quality as the actual movie. Sorry about that.
,EiNST3iN,2011-08-08T21:08Z,".BONE. You are amazing bro! You don't get enough thanks on here for everything you do. Anytime I am looking for a movie or anything I look for your name first. Your work is always the best it can possibly be. I don't care what anyone says, you are by far one of the best providers here on TPB. You deserve a GOLDEN skull and crossbones.

THANK YOU!!!!"
,bryentheartist,2011-08-08T22:43Z,thanks baby

,vsjane,2011-08-09T13:55Z,"Thanks. Very appreciative, and not just for the dl but for making me aware that I really need glasses. Couldn't get my eyes to focus! Going to get my ears checked, too; kept hearing candy paper being crinkled. Again, thanks a million. "

,SoxPatsFanInKC,2011-08-11T14:43Z,Got about 10 minutes in and decided I couldn't keep watchin. Goes completely out of focus for minutes at a time. A-7 V-2
,InstantStarFan7,2011-08-12T03:03Z,"First of all, THANK YOU SO MUCH Bone for the upload. I really appreciate all the hard work you put into releasing movies for all of us! :) 

Second, I saw the movie in the theater and loved it, but wanted to see it again, so tried this copy out. It is very bad quality however, so I would recommend waiting for a better copy, unless you really want to see it now. The video is barely watchable to me and kind of makes me dizzy. Your call though :) 

Even though I don't like the quality, I want to see again, thank you Bone! Your awesome! :)"
,BadboyJay55,2011-08-12T03:10Z,"Fucking Jane, stop spamming!"
,Hajeil,2011-08-12T08:56Z,@jane.mccarthy45 No kidding! Stop posting your feeds and links on others torrents. That's bullshit! Especially when you just trying to drive traffic to a site that want to make money. And when the link is to a steaming feed of the same damn copy of the movie!
,zx3fred,2011-08-13T05:03Z,"Horrible focus issues, and noise from movement/candy wrapper = no entertainment. Sorry Bone, I've seen a lot of good stuff from you, but not this one."
,scottsasse,2011-08-13T23:58Z,People please turn off auto-focus when making a cam!!! It only makes a TS worse!!
,skydiver8,2011-08-14T05:24Z,"Thanks been waiting for this, Bone you tha man!"
,pregnantcowlady,2011-08-14T07:42Z,thanks a lot!
,joo-loved-it,2011-08-14T10:39Z,"@pregnantcowlady really?........i mean really?
pregnantcowlady..........unless you intend on changing your name within the next nine months, you're kind of implying that you're always pregnant which....erm.... doesn't  look good for you"

,jenalexjdad,2011-09-09T19:27Z,NOT a very good copy.  Camera constantly going in and out of focus is very distracting.
,sexybac,2011-09-10T07:29Z,"I appreciate the effort, but I really couldn't watch this.  Bone, you have great stuff - but this is definitely not one of your best.  It WAS the first one out there though.        A-4 V-3"
,zeromaker,2011-09-14T22:13Z,"OMG This is an embarrasment , and from a trusted uploader ..... 
Its the WORST upload ive EVER seen .... theres not one moment that the film is in focus . this is worse than the Fast & Furious 5 film that had half the screen missing ... at least you could see what was going on .... oh man , 

THIS IS A WASTE OF Bandwidth do not D/L this film you will be sorry ..... "
,cb1215,2011-09-17T21:15Z,"not watchable.

i know it's just a cam, and it's better to wait for dvdrip, but even for a cam, this is bad quality. i dl cams all the time and can put up with crap quality, but i couldn't even get 10 minutes into this one before turning it off."
,alarik_2,2011-09-24T01:14Z,"Why would someone make a cam recording out of focus? 
This seems like a good movie but the cam recording is not. It constantly goes out of focus. Download the film and you'll see what I mean.
Sorry Bone but this is a crap upload."
,advocate70,2011-09-25T07:16Z,"I like and watch a lot of CAM movies, but I couldn't have the constant losing focus and refocusing."
,sharealike54,2011-09-26T03:01Z,In and out of focus so much I got whiplash.  Unwatchable.
,rhyrhyrhy,2011-09-26T14:24Z,"havent dwnloaded yet but i already got dizzy, all those commenters whining had me out of focus"
,erio6,2011-10-05T05:03Z,very very bad quality
,erio6,2011-10-05T05:04Z,very very bad quality....
,oitj,2011-10-06T11:41Z,"V = 2/10
A = 5/10

Keeping in mind this is a cam, the audio is all good, some popcorn noises at the beginning, but nothing major.
Video goes in and out of focus for most of the movie, extreamly annoying, even for a cam I was expenting more, I normally dont have a problem watching cam versions of films but I suggest not downloading this copy, no offence to the uploader."
