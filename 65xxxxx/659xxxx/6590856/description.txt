Harry Forster Chapin (December 7, 1942 â€“ July 16, 1981) was an American singer-songwriter best known in particular for his folk rock songs including "Taxi", "W*O*L*D", and the number-one hit "Cat's in the Cradle". Chapin was also a dedicated humanitarian who fought to end world hunger; his work was a key player in the creation of the Presidential Commission on World Hunger in 1977. In 1987, Chapin was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his humanitarian work.



Heads & Tales is the first studio album by the American singer/songwriter Harry Chapin, released in 1972 (see 1972 in music). The album contains Chapin's early signature song "Taxi."

Early LP pressings of Heads & Tales featured a die-cut front cover with a square hole in it, allowing the "cover" photo of Chapin (which is actually on an enclosed poster/lyric sheet) to be seen through the hole, creating a three-dimensional effect.

Despite its length of nearly seven minutes, which made the song unwieldy for AM radio airplay, "Taxi" was released uncut as a 45 RPM single, and charted at #24 on the Billboard Hot 100.
