This is the North America (Canada, USA) DVD disk from my Prius. This is an ISO rip, so I'm not too sure if it's as simple as rip and burn. 

I do know since it's a DVD-DL you should use Verbatim discs, but YMMV. 

Relevant info copied from the front of the disc:

U92 D

86271-73012
464210-1741
DATA ver.10.1


Good luck?
