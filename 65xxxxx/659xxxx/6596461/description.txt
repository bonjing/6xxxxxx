After a few searches I finally  came across this  copy of mtg dotp2012 that suits my playing needs. id did not rip this myself. I am just sharing this to people that had issues like me w/ game saves when attempting to play the game unlocked. 


I have not played mtg for close to 12 years. this game reminded me of portal (aka magic for beginners) so the extra challenge of unlocking the decks and learning the new card abilities is well appreciated. 


- this is not like skidrows release that has all the decks unlocked.

- no more fidling w/ steam to play w/ decks unlocked.

- no save issues.

- just extract and install. NO CRACK NEEDED.


how to extract

1)extract "MTG Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 SE.part1" first

2)winrar will prompt you that it needs file "MTG Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 SE.part2_2" just click browse, seclect file and ok.

3) do the same w/ part 3.

4) install .exe and viola.


5) password included inside foder.
