NOTE TO GROUPS WHO ENCODE MDVDR/DVDR to XViD or x264 for MV section            
or otherwise:                                                                  
                                                                               
There are NO groups that have PERMISSION to take our rips, as of now           
(16 October 2009) we do our own encodes for MV/XViD sections (and have         
been for a while now). Some groups USED TO HAVE permission, but DO NOT         
anymore.
