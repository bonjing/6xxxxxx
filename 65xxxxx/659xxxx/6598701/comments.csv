,philteeth,2011-08-12T15:01Z,why is this not a batman movie?
,iamsiaho,2011-08-12T18:45Z,"this should not have anyone rate it a minus. it is a movie, it did come out this year, and it is called ""the dark knight""
the batman movie of the same name came out in 2009, not 2011. that should be your first hint.


however, to scenebalance, if you can't post a disclaimer stating that this isn't the batman movie, you could at least post an IMDB link for folks. just saying."
