I restarted in safe mode and went to play Coffin again (I thought that was that was the problem) and it blue screened again. There is a virus in there. Don't download it. "
,deathgaze88,2012-01-13T23:05Z,sorry to say i downlaoded it works fine :P lol no viruses iv scanned it with 3 different scanners not one virus and plus he was running it from a Linux system they can't get viruses just like mac window's is really the only one that can get viruses cause they don't make viruses for mac or linux so its something with your computer surely cause my friends downloaded this its fine not one prob so stop blacking his name and just fix your pc 
,deathgaze88,2012-01-13T23:07Z,"on top of that no one else got this ""virus"" of your's so yeah i'm done lol"
,c_robes97,2012-01-17T15:42Z,linux and macs are just as vonerable to viruses as windows is the thing is that windows is default on alot of computers so people dont waste time making viruses for linux or mac only windows cuz its more popular
