Hey!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These torrents were NOT put out by Mike. I am just a fan. Putting together these torrents is something that I have been meaning to do for a while, and I thought this might be an appropriate time, since at the moment there is some drama going on the Red Bar world, and I would imagine there won't be any shows or updates for a while.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  At the moment, there are FOUR seperate torrents. They are as follows:

THE RED BAR RADIO TIME MACHINE TORRENT - 2009
THE RED BAR RADIO TIME MACHINE TORRENT - 2008
THE RED BAR RADIO TIME MACHINE TORRENT - 2007
THE BEST OF RED BAR RADIO TORRENT

  The contents of the torrents are as follows:

All of the "TIME MACHINE" torrents combined contain EVERY show spanning from 05-01-2009 back to 04-02-2007. For reference, at the time these torrents were made, 05-01-2009 is where the podcast feed on iTunes stops, and 04-02-2007 is as far back as I have at the moment. I split them into chunks so that people will be more likely to only download what they need. I also want to make a torrent of any shows I can find that PREDATE 04-02-2007. If you have any, PLEASE email oldepisodes@gmail.com and let me know! I don't have any, and I don't know anyone who has any.

The "BEST OF" torrent contains 53 of my favorite Red Bar shows. I added numbers to the beginning of their filenames so taht if you are viewing them in a file browser, they will be in order. It also included a playlist file for your convenience (.m3u).

If you have any episodes of Red Bar that PREDATE 04-02-2007 (April 2, 2007), please email oldepisodes@gmail.com - I am trying to put together a torrent of episodes that predate that time. You know, shows from the Biggs & Kyle days, and when Panama Black, Ron, and Dani were around. I am not including the "first episodes" of Red Bar, because they are Barmy content. Someone out there has to have some, so spread the word!

Enjoy!
