Poor old Robinson who is boring at home with a terrible mother-in-law and an annoying housewife, and at work too. One day, he decides to retire from urban life with 3 very nice girls on an island. But beware of the awful cannibals !!!!

French starlet Anne Libert is playing one of the nude girl on the Robinson Island (she was in a lot of Franco movies at this time), and Howard Vernon is playing a not so very frightening cannibal, saying word like "Agagagag" & "hououou". A lot of silly fun to be had. The monkey was hilarious.
