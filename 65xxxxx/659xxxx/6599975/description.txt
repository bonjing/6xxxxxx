If I haven't already pushed your buttons, then this one is going to take you over the edge. This shoot is a total departure from anything you've ever seen. Imagine with me for a moment if I challenged your manhood in such a way that your ego was slowly peeled away and all that was left was a memory of what used to be and in place was a perfect little sissy slut ready to serve anyone and everybody on a whim. I skillfully and erotically do this to Will, a rough and tough guy from New Jersey. He walks in as Will and leaves as Ginger. In between, what transpires is a humiliating yet arousing transformation into the world of feminization and sissification filled with OTK spanking in panties, silky sensual stockings, erotic humiliation, messy cummy panties, heavy strap-on ass pounding and one man's journey in true devotion, willing to please his domme in ANYTHING and I mean ANYTHING she desires.
