,hauntnut,2011-08-10T20:22Z,"Good audio and video quality, the only downside is the lack of English subtitles for the non-English dialogue, and there's quite a bit of it throughout the movie, enough to miss out on possibly important plot points."
,picturedude,2011-08-10T20:44Z,"I agree, English subs are a must.
All I can find on the net are Brazillian subs."
,JhonDoexx,2011-08-10T21:02Z,"Grrr, watched film 1/4 way through, then decided it NEEDED English subs, however as stated above can only find dam Brazillian & couple of Spanish !!! grrr."
,zombazco,2011-08-10T22:20Z,"Guys its very simple, what I did was take the Brazilian subs and copy and paste in parts of 530 lines at a time into Google translate, then combined the english translation into a notepad document.  This is the only tricky part, when you put it into google translate the format changes a bit, you notice that the arrows above the text changes from having two dashes in front to having one in front.  What you do is go to the first line and then and an extra dash.  This will enable you to open the notepad doc. in Subtitleworkshop or some other kind of subtitle program.   All you have to do then is save the new subtitle as "".srt"" in subtitleworkshop and voila you have a working subtitle made from different language origins."
,hauntnut,2011-08-10T22:52Z,"How can I post a link to the English subs on here? I keep trying to, but I keep getting a ""database error"" message when trying to post."
,hauntnut,2011-08-10T22:57Z,"If anyone is looking for English subs for the non-English dialogue, they have been uploaded to Podnapisi dot net; just use ""Whistleblower"" for the search, and the one with my username (hauntnut) is the one you're looking for. "
,hauntnut,2011-08-10T23:21Z,"Here are the subtitles for the non-English speaking parts.

,michaelrwatson,2011-08-12T10:16Z,"Hey ""Hero_No_1"", are you bilingual or are you a moron for not including English subs for all the foreign parts..?

Me thinks the latter."
,PokerPimp,2011-08-12T13:17Z,Are you guys serious for yelling at this man for not including subs? Its probably a dvd from another region and didnt have the subs because they speak the language.... they probably had english subs for the whole movie but that would have been pointless...

NO CAPTIONS and the best parts need them!  There is another version 1.7gb file size on here I found that DOES have captions.

Search the info it tells you there are SUBs on it when you find it.

,rmac1,2011-08-13T02:30Z,"Zionist Propaganda.... ?!  I haven't seen the movie but, it's about an American of Slavic origin uncovering the child sex-slave trade and human trafficking occurring in Bosnia under the UN's watch.  Call me silly, but, that doesn't seem to qualify as propaganda for a damn thing besides morality.  "
,orgnlchc,2011-08-13T22:29Z,"The movie was great (Weisz was superb) in portraying the atrocities of the people who have sworn to protect the innocent. 

I read on wiki that Kathryn Bolkovac has written a book named ""The Whistleblower"" and would love to get my hands on the raw story but google doesn't come up with anything except a possibility of buying one (not possible atm). 
Anyone have it? Please let me know @ originalchc@gmail.com if you have it or if u upload it. Thanks!"
,ashen77,2011-08-13T23:10Z,"I dont think fightthenwofuckers knows what the words zionist or propaganda actually means, Thick wanker.

Good movie, though it does make me ashamed of being a human being. And there are people out there that believe in a higher power. lmfao. If I was a god, I'd wipe us out in an instant.

9 all round in A/V"
,sosalmiemer,2011-08-14T12:47Z,"Hi All,

Free subtitle translater... JUBLER. This is the best software I have found, and it's freeware.

Just google and download it and translate the subs to whatever languages available. I use it for the Thai misus all the time.

Save as .srt format and use UTF-8 as the code. Takes 30sec's to translate and save.

Regards;
Sosal"
,sosalmiemer,2011-08-14T12:50Z,"Download a program called JUBLER for subtitle translation. Free software, translates like a charm.

Just google it and download"
,LarryInColumbus,2011-08-18T06:35Z,"Propganda?   LOL

This is a real story and the name of the company is Dyncorp.  They held congessional hearings and Dyncorp promissed that it will never happen again.  So now, they kill whistlerblowers and it cannot happen again."
,Phatfish,2011-08-19T20:01Z,"A/V - Fine

M - Objectively speaking,  the movie isn't very good. Pretty fucking crap even. Bad script, bad acting, slow even boring at times and the misandry angle is just a bit over the top.

I don't know much about what actually happened but I get the impression is was pretty fucking bad and this was a lost chance of awareness as it's very hard do take it serious.

,altonina,2011-08-20T13:38Z,"A collaborative work indeed! My thanks to Hero_No_1 & Scene Lovers for putting the Eng vers. out so fast, & to haunted for the subs on non-English parts. PEOPLE NEED TO SEE THIS, especially the Eng w sub version I now have, thanks to you folks."
