 Biswambhar Roy is a zamindar and the last       
 of his kind. With the title, he has none of     
 the perquisites, inheriting diminishing lands   
 that are being eroded by the neighbouring       
 river. But he must maintain the lifestyle of    
 his heritage. This ostentation is most apparent 
 in the grandest room of his mansion, the music  
 room. Here he inports the finest musicians and  
 dancers to perform, and invites the area's most 
 important commoners. His wife's entreaties to   
 control spending are ignored, and the puberty   
 party he throws for his son bring him down to   
 the last few sacks of family jewels. Then, struc
 by tragedy, he locks the music room and slips   
 into lethargy - until a final grand soiree      
 consumes the last of his funds.
