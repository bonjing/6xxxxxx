,AlfNader,2011-09-09T20:17Z,"The jackass that encoded this decided to hardcode the letters DDR into the picture for 10 seconds a little past the 16 minute mark. Thanks for letting me know not to ever download anything from DDR again. Thank god almost all other release groups have the decency not to burn their goddamn names into the picture.

Fuck you very much DDR"

Unfortunately the idiots in the release group DDR do at least one crass, ignorant and ugly thing to every movie they release.  Usually they also manage to fuck up the cropping, the AR, the audio sync and the subtitles.  When you see a DDR tag you know it's going to be a disappointment."
