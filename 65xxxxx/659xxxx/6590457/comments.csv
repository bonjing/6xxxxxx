,gaaraisgod,2011-08-12T16:20Z,"I can see two subtitles files: ING and PBTR but I haveno idea which language they are. I'm thinking ING meant ENG?

Would be really cool if someone could clarify..."
,gaaraisgod,2011-08-22T19:33Z,"Well, I was right. The files named ""Space.Battleship.Yamato.Resurrection.2009.JAP.DVDRip.XviD-AXiNE.CD1 ING.srt"" and ""Space.Battleship.Yamato.Resurrection.2009.JAP.DVDRip.XviD-AXiNE.CD2 ING.srt"" are English subtitles. The other two files are Portuguese subtitles."
