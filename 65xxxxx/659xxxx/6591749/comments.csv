It is a .ts file, which should work with whichever media player you use.

The episode is edited, but it has Cartoon Network commercials after the episode is over. The audio is in sync, but the video, though watchable, is a bit choppy (but that could be due to a codec error).

Get this if you can't wait for a downsized version."
