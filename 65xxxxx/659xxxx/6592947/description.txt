	Changes:

*Patched the game to newest 1.16.1 patch.
*Removed Razors crack
*Changed default maps to iCCup ones.
*Converted game to NOCD version using bulk CD-key
(game uses cd-key that only works for the game itself, but not battle.net)

	How to install:

1.Unpack game anywhere you want.
2.Launch the game (NECESARY ! In this step game launcher creates register entry about instalation location, cdkey, games version ect. ALL THAT INFO IS NEEDED FOR NEXT STEP)
3.Launch iccup_reg.exe
4.Install iCCup launcher.

That's all, your Game is iCCup friendly. All you have to do now is register and start playing.
