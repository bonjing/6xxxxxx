,Atomic_T,2011-08-12T03:16Z,Now ive connected to one seed a bunch of peers but i am only getting a 1.1kbs download speed
,DarthPS3,2011-08-12T07:00Z,"Here's my tip. Let it sit for about one week, probably less but I like to be like Chief Engineer Scotty and overshoot my estimates. It takes me about 3-5 days to upload my torrents, unfortunately, and this one I've uploaded 5.99 gigabyte of so far, mostly because at the moment I foolishly decided to upload three new torrents at once. However, the bright side is its only a week, after the initial seeding week the speeds pick up by a bunch and everyone is happy.

On that note, I really appreciate all those that help to seed these files after I do the initial seeding, as I say, its what let's me keep uploading new stuff. "
,Harathos,2011-08-17T03:50Z,"Hey, I downloaded all your torrents for the BSG seasons and seeded them for a bit, but this download seems to have a problem. I completed the download and only The Plan will play, the rest say theres a problem and wont open on windows media player. If you might know what i did wrong or whats up i would love to know :) "
,Akeryll,2011-08-17T17:09Z,"It happens the same to me, I've tried downloading different codec packs, none has worked U___U"
,kanak33,2011-08-21T16:46Z,"Hello, all your torrents have been great, tahnk you! but aparently there is a problem with this one as no file seem complete, they won't open in vlc or wmp... are you going to upload a new one or shall we find something else ?"
,DarthPS3,2011-08-26T18:03Z,"I've been moving for a week and a half cross US territory, so sorry I haven't responded until now. I will work out what is wrong with this file and let everyone know. Sorry for the inconvenience, but I'm glad people are finding the files useful. And being polite. That matters most of all, at least I think!"
,DarthPS3,2011-08-26T21:08Z,"To begin with, I never got to fully upload this before I moved...I was almost there, at 18 gig. So, should be done today. "
,jstew1,2011-09-05T22:35Z,"hi, cant get this to work either, i downloaded this and the complete collection and season 4 is broke in both torrents, any idea when u might get the chance to upload a fixed version? p.s. thanks for the upload!"
,DarthPS3,2011-09-09T09:19Z,"Thanks everyone for being so patient and understanding. These BSG Season 4 uploads are totally not working for reasons on my part. I am in the process of fixing it now. I am sorry for all the bandwidth you may have wasted trying to get these files already, but I will have a torrent up that WILL work on your PS3 in the same pretty damn decent hi-def that the rest have been. "
,jrb2,2011-09-27T21:50Z,"it seems most of the videos have a missing codec, i am only to play episodes 11, 16, and The Plan :("
,iOsiris,2011-09-29T07:14Z,"This version doesn't work, use this one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6671330/Battlestar_Galactica_Season_4_Complete_-720p-_%5BPS3Compatible%5D"
