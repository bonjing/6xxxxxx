                Flynn, A-Rab and Barry are three British chancers,
                fresh out of uni and determined to have one last
                summer of irresponsibility before they face the real
                world. For reasons best know to Flynn, they've
                blagged themselves jobs at Beaver Falls, an elite
                American summer camp for the ridiculously beautiful
                teenage offspring of California's rich and powerful.
                In episode three, it's Parents' Day - a chance for
                the folks to visit their precious kids and for Bobby
                and Pam to tap them for donations. Our boys might
                think this equals a day off, but when Rick Jnr's
                estranged father, golfing legend - and Barry's hero -
                Rick Traviata shows up, a reluctant Flynn finds
                himself in the middle of a family feud. Meanwhile,
                A-Rab has girl trouble. He's struggling to manage the
                aftermath of his first one-night stand, while trying
                to handle Rachael and her first encounter with
                tequila.

                Encoded at crf 21 because this series is less
                compressible than most scripted series. It would go
                over 5000 kbit/s on crf 19.
