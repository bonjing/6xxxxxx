TV-movie from 1979. A young woman begins to have visions during which time around her stops and she sees horrific events that are taking place elsewhere. In her visions she keeps seeing a bald man. Her doctor can't figure out what is happening, but a government agent who hears about her visions tries to help her, as he is investigating a plane crash that appears to involve the bald man she keeps seeing.

This is a rip from the Dutch ex-rental vhs (with burbned in subs), so don't expect any miracles regarding image quality. 

I've uploaded this because the movie is very hard to get hold of. As far as I know, it hasn''t been released on DVD anywhere. Some people might want to see it again (http://weblogs.nrc.nl/filmvragen/2006/09/01/vrouw-ei-terrorist/comment-page-1/#comment-1470).

Enjoy.
