Release Notes....: Last week futoncritic changed all the season and episode numbering for the last 39 episodes that had been pred as
                   season 3. This is probably because a season 3 dvd set was released by history channel. And of course, history
                   channel's website still says Pawn Stars is in season 2 which is ridiculous. I'm just going with futoncritic and no,
                   I'm not going to dirfix the last 39 episodes.
