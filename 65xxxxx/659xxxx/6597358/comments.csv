,DarthBubba,2011-08-13T03:25Z,"Vista?  Hrrgghh!  You made me throw up into my mouth a little!

A complete waste of your time and talent.

You owe me a beer to get that awful Vista taste out of my mouth!   Hrrrracckkk, ptthewww..."
,redback38,2011-08-13T11:11Z,"@wulles?.....i dug this old build out of my work stock from a while back,i popped in the disc,and the files listed in the torrent folder are as they appeared on the disk.the disc boots for me no problem,so i packaged it up in the folder called VistaPE1.you can try making an iso of the files but i tried that and it didnt boot so i uploaded it as is,.you may also try formatting either the disc(live file system format)or properly formatting a USB and copy the CONTENTS of the the VistaPE1 folder to the stick...hope that helps....:-)"
,redback38,2011-08-13T11:21Z,"@DarthBubba.....?....vista is such a loved and revered opperating system,made by some very educated and talented people who put thier best efforts into making a system for ppl to stare at,open mouthed at the wonder of the realization of Bill Gates dream......it is such a pity that the best efforts of thousands of those learnered people resulted in the dismal,hard to watch,road accident horrificy,disaster of a magnitude that left us stunned,open mouthed,staring at Bill Gates nightmare,and wondering.....WTF do we do with the shining turd,that is Vista!?.......well....i dont complain...i do what i can to make the useless usefull,so i made this PE disc to fix a poor ol vista install when the poor disabled thing falls over.......and i still owe you a beer....:-) "

I admire your giving nature - but helping people polish that turd does not make it any less a turd.  Be a saint and direct them to one of the fine installation disc images of Win 7 or Win XP SP3 available here and at other fine Warez emporiums.

You can just file-attach it to an e-mail, or include it in your next Win 7 release.

Cheers!"
,redback38,2011-08-14T08:23Z,"yes for shame upon me and the IT world in general that vista wasnt shot like a sick dog,as would be deemed completly natural....i spread the word daily that turds smell bad....even more if you encourage them to go on smelling:-)and there just isnt enough polish in the world to change that fact....i deflect all but the most die hard fans of bill gates idea of the future,toward the better alternative....i only hope that one day my children forget the name vista,but remember the lesson of new not always being better....and your beer will appear on the desktop of version 7.....:-)might even make a little .gif of it being drunk,as my way of apology for encouraging vista users,not to move on....."
,DarthBubba,2011-08-14T18:49Z,"Nevertheless, your giving, and forgiving (in the case of Vista), nature is greatly appreciated here.  I personally appreciate your finely developed caustic wit given the historical context here (Vista, the latter-day Windows ME).  Let us no longer tarry here; methinks the horse is dead enough from our severe beatings.

Cheers!"
