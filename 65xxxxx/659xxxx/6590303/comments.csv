,SYNAESTHE5IA,2011-08-13T04:47Z,"Same question as the above poster: Does this profile work on the current dashboard, 2.0.13599.0?"
,SYNAESTHE5IA,2011-08-15T07:08Z,"I downloaded just the profile to see if that worked before downloading the game, and it wouldn't log in to XBL, unlike previous modded profiles I've tried (before the dashboard update). If the profile can't log in, that means the game can't be played on your actual profile either, so save your bandwidth as this torrent is useless."
