"Whispering Grass (Don't Tell The Trees)" is a popular song written by Fred Fisher and his daughter Doris Fisher. The song was first recorded by Erskine Hawkins & His Orchestra in 1940. The Ink Spots also recorded it the same year.

Whispering Grass was a 1975 UK number-one single by Windsor Davies and Don Estelle. Davies (Sgt Major Williams) and Estelle (Gunner 'Lofty' Sugden) were actors in the successful sitcom It Ain't Half Hot Mum. 

It was number one in the British singles chart for three weeks from 7 June 1975.

This extremely rare music video featuring both actors was ripped from the DVD Complete Collection, and features English subtitles for the hard of hearing to enjoy as well.
