Don't suppose you could put the HD-Audio as a separate DTSHD file ?"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-08-11T16:13Z,"Lol, 3.5 GB for audio, are you kidding? 
You didn't mean it, did you?
Do you really think DTS-HD Master Audio of this movie would sound any better? 
If it was Transformers, Avatar etc movies, would indeed if you can hear over 20 KHz and you have the right equipment (forget the pc-s sound card)...
Can you can hear the difference between a flac and mp3 320 KB/s?
My older brother used to be a snob collecting only flac music and looking me down for collecting mp3 320 KB/s...
until I took him to the technical university to make a few sound hearing tests. There he felt completely, he couldn't hear anything over 17 KHz and couldn't tell which is wav and which mp3 320 KB/s. LOL
My 768 KB/s DTS-s are good enough for most of us.
If you want the DTS-HD MA go ahead
download this: The Name of the Rose 1986 Blu-ray EUR AVC DTS-HD MA - HDT

or rent or buy the BD.
Let me know about the difference of sounds, I'm dying for curiosity.
By the way I can hear till 19 KHz & I do care for quality. God bless Surcode and DTS 768KB/s."
,Gacy4Gein,2011-08-11T17:47Z,"Yes, I did.

No onboard sound card is going to get uncompressed HDAudio, you have to have it over the HDMI cable into a DTSHD/TrueHD amp and some good speakers.

All I was after was a file less than 9Gb in total, with great video quality (try getting a 'perfect' TV or monitor), with the ability to have lossless sound.

Is it really 3.5Gb ?

Dark Knight, for example, was only 2.28Gb for the uncompressed TrueHD file at 3Mbps."
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-08-11T18:48Z,"I have ""Leon: The Professional (1994)"" prepared for upload but I'm struggling with it's audio.
It has DTS MA 96 KHz, size=5.41 GB!
I didn't find yet a way to trans-code it to a reasonable size. The 96 KHz is such a pain in the arse and I'm so pissed."
,Gacy4Gein,2011-08-11T19:12Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6595993/Leon.The.Professional.1994.EXTENDED.1080p.BluRay.x264-fZ

Not sure if you have the same length video as this 'extended' version, but it does mention it has DTS-HA MA at 48kHz. Not sure about the bitrate, but it should be (roughly) half of your current size.

99% of the 96kHz+ BluRays seem to be Music Discs, like NiN, Celine (kill me now) Dion, and such."

,VicVega,2011-08-22T01:34Z,"I agree that wasting gigs on top-notch audio is a waste. Even 754kbps standard DTS is far better than the version of DTS that plays in theaters, and I doubt most moviegoers can tell the difference between DTS, SDDS or DD in a theater.

But what I can't understand is the need for people to invent some strange new non-standard 900p resolution. I'd rather you do like the release groups and either do a 720p at 4.7GB or 1080p at 8.5GB. It's impossible to motivate how that makes less sense than inventing an arbitrary new in-between resolution that no TV or projector manufacturer will ever treat as an industry standard."
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-08-26T22:07Z,"""new non-standard 900p resolution""? LOL

Why don't you write to the manufacturers of 900p laptops/graphic cards? Tell them that you're so damned smart and you know 900p is a wrong resolution because you decided it.

I rip the BD-s with inferior image quality to 900p because it will be smaller in size and it will look exactly like a 1080p on a big full HD tv.

If you don't believe it go ahead and watch a BD with poorer image q and also the 900p rip encoded with very high settings.

Also many people don't have a 1080p TV but still higher resolution then 720p.

Google for 1600 x 900 & 1440 x 900.

Also many pc-s unable to play 1080p will easily play my 900p rips and get slightly superior image then a 720p rip."
