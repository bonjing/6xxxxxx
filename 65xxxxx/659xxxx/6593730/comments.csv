,Realuploads,2011-08-10T22:43Z,"You have to copy IntelligentShutdown.exe and then paste to C:\Program files\IntelligentShutdown and then use the new IntelligentShutdown.exe. I dont get the trial thing you are talking about. I have just tried to install it.

,Realuploads,2011-08-10T23:26Z,"Okay iam running xp. When you copy / paste to folder, are you then overwriting the the old .exe file ? You can try to remove the old instead off overwriting and then put the cracked version in. Hope it will work for you.
