These are the materials/sounds/models/textures/maps for different Source Engine games.

This pack is designed for extracting to the Garrysmod folder, so you don't miss these textures ingame (if you miss them, you get large red error text everywhere).

Only CS:S stuff is needed for most gamemodes (in particular, TTT gamemode only requires CS:S materials for most maps).

The full Garrysmod game is NOT attached with this. This is just materials the game requires, not the full game.

Extract rar(s) to C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/YOUR-USERNAME/garrysmod/garrysmod/ (yes, two garrysmods. They go in the same folder as the other materials/maps/etc folders).

Comments or questions? Please post on this page.

PS: If you still get error boxes after installing this, then either you installed it incorrectly, or it's a custom material that the server owner needs to send you.
