Title: FROZEN (aka THE THAW)
Type: FullDisc, Re-Authoring BD25
Source: Germany Blu-Ray Region B (German DTS HD-MA,English DTS-HD MA, German Subtitles)
Re-Authoring/added:
- Professionally reconstructed and re-synched upsampled Italian DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio track
- Re-synched Italian subtitles


Note: the official Italian DVD edition has a 2.0 audio track. The Italian DTS-HD MA 5.1 track 
included in this release has been professionally reconstructed from that 2.0 track and it 
sounds quite good, check it. The LFE channel was taken untouched from the English audio track 
to ensure better results.
