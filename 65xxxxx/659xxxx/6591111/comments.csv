did something go wrong?  i use intel mac 2 core duo end 2009 10.6.8
thank you very much in advance nice torrent "
,BirM0n,2011-08-10T23:38Z,"The only time it told me that it couldn't find the installer, I hadn't selected the correct bottle. You have to install the update in the same bottle as the initial install. Just to check, have you done that? If so, might be a problem with the installer, and I need to make a new torrent...

Don't forget to replace the original with the cracked version. Go to Manage Bottle -> Advanced -> Open C: in Finder -> Go to the game folder, and replace the file. After that, you should be able to play!"
,nikitriki,2011-08-11T00:01Z,"ok  thank you dude  everything works fine, i installed in a new bottle before ,believing i was installing in the same bottle , so now i installed in the same bottle  hehe

,Diplex,2011-08-23T21:30Z,can you play with out fixing the mouse problem (aka)after the 8th step is it very important or not?
,Diplex,2011-08-23T21:32Z,Will seed if works
,BirM0n,2011-08-24T01:13Z,"@Diplex
Yeah, I've played without the mouse fix, and it's very very hard... Not the campaign map, that's ok, but in battle.. And from start to end you have to fight battles, so, sorry, but otherwise you'll miss out on the game..."
,Diplex,2011-08-24T07:11Z,"step 3 did not work for me i had to go to configure and install new software

,PlyrSlyr33,2012-01-04T22:22Z,When i do the Programs for Crossover it says no software installed but it won't let me add anymore
,PlyrSlyr33,2012-01-04T22:45Z,okay got the last one but what do i do when choosing the folder i tried choosing the one it came up with but that took it to the normal game thing; then i tried it browsing and selecting one but i can't get to the update but i don't even know where to find it TL:DR don't know which folder to select 
,Shad0wminded,2012-06-05T16:28Z,"I have an issue. After ive copied the crossover files and mounted the IOS up to the end of step 2, i try to open crossover games from my app folder. It gives me the usual warnings about how its from the net and do i really want to open it. I say yes, and every dam time i try to open it it immediately closes. :/"
