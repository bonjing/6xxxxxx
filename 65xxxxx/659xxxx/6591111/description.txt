So, first thing, this is not an app, or dmg, which you can just move to your applications folder and play... There's a lot to be done before, and it's the ONLY way I have found to properly play this game on my mac!

None of this is my doing. Everything except for the final instructions were downloaded from somewhere else, and the tricks to make it work are around in forums... So, thank them, not me!


I have a MacBook Pro 13", Spring 2010 model:
2.4 PCU
4 GB Ram
GeForce 320M

and so far, from a few hours play, and with good graphic settings, everything seems to play well! No lags, no long waits, no bugs (except one small - related to a MouseWarpOverride), but trust me, it's no big thing...

Make sure to follow the instructions (Instructions.pdf) with caution and time, and you'll be fine!!

Any questions, I'll make sure to answer as best and as soon as I can!


Have fun!
