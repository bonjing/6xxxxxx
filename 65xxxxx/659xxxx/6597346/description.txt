In order for a society to function and maintain its Irish spirit, it must
be cnstituted of those that are not alien to it. Otherwise understanding and 
sensibility become lost in the translation and in the unwillingness and 
inability to remain fair enough and sane enough for that matter as to do 
justice in equitable enough fashion.

The British gal in this movie goes to some lengths to obtain employment for
those with "false papers" in her area. When the employer she has them engaged
to then goes finally "under" without being able to pay the workers in question, 
she becomes a target instead and is physically beaten by thugs that dont seem
to know her from any other form of street thug as it were - when clearly only
alien minds could be so insane. same for those that feed on such images as 
movies should never be made this way by civilized peoples without the greatest
show of indignation.


By the way, the gang of thieves that storms into her apartment at the movie 
ending dont end up hurting her beyond seeing her tied to the chair and
terrorized as she is - so no need to lose your sanity over it altogether as I
am willing to tell you so. (Could have been worse given the poor movie plot
in what is respect for our gals lives - truly!).
