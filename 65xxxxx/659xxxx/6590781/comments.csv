,bhutan_6,2011-08-09T08:26Z,Great torrents. Thanks. I have a request to everyone. Can you upload 2 rare Gamecube games (NTSC-U) Star wars rouge squadron 2: rouge leader and Prince of persia: sands of time in Piratebay. Thx in advance. Both of the games are in IGN's all time 25 best GC games list.

,IdahoChang,2011-08-16T06:10Z,"I know this is a noob question, but can someone point me at some info to make this work - do I have to mod my Wii or something?"
,xlos_crudos4x,2011-08-25T05:42Z,@Idahochang...No offense but DUR!. You can either install a mod chip on to your wii so you can download and burn games onto a disc. or soft mod your wii to play either back up discs or play directyl from the usbs in the back. I had some one do the soft mod for me for $10. There are tutorials on how to do it on youtube..I could have risked doing it myself.but instead I payed some one from craigslist..(yeah CRAIGSLIST) for 10 dollars...Now I can play through the usbs in the back of the wii. Im using an external hard drive to store the games.

,loneZX,2011-10-28T18:17Z,@zswede you can try using WBFS manager but first you need to format your hard drive with that.
