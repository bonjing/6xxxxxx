Demanufacture is the second full length studio
album by Fear Factory. This is the band's first
album with their classic line-up adding new
bassist Christian Olde Wolbers. Many regard it
as the band's best album and a heavy metal
classic.

The opening sample for "Pisschrist" and "Zero Signal"
are both taken from "Terminator 2:Judgment Day".

The album was recorded at Bearsville Studios in
rural New York. Also in residence at the studio
was Bon Jovi, recording their album These Days.
Fear Factory were in the studio next door and
one of Bon Jovi's engineers asked them to turn
the sound down, as it was bleeding into Bon Jovi's
recording sessions. LOL!!
