 Peter Andre: Here 2 Help sees Peter Andre offering a helping hand to different
 members of the public.                                                        
                                                                               
 The singer heads to the Isle of Wight to help at Ryde Inshore Rescue, an
 independent lifeboat station staffed by volunteers. His challenge is to fix up
 their dilapidated building and he is soon bargaining with local builders for
 materials. Peter also takes part in a fire drill and visits a residential care
 home.  
                                    
                                 Enjoy!
