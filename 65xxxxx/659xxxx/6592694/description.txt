BBC Horizon 2011 Do You See What I See HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

Horizon reveals a surprising truth about how we all see the world. You may think a rose is red, the sky is blue and the grass is green, but it now seems that the colours one sees may not always be the same as the colours seen by someone else. Your age, sex and even mood can affect how you experience colours. Scientists have unlocked the hidden power that colours can have over your life - how red can make you a winner, how blue makes time speed up, and more.
