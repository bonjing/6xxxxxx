Synopsis   [?]: If you're like me and anal about your music files being truly
                "Lossless", then you'll find Audition extremely useful. I use
                Audition to visually inspect suspicious audio files. As we're
                aware of, many uploaders burn MP3 to CD then rip as FLAC 
                (lossless). This should never be done, but there are lamers out
                there who are "Cred" whores. You can use Audition to help with
                verification.

                Of course, Audition is more than a spectral analysis tool. It's
                a professional grade audio/video production suite that can      
                handle a wide range of audio production tasks ranging from      
                recording, mixing, and sound restoration.
