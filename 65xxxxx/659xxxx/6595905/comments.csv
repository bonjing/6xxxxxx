,globalpuffer,2011-08-19T13:10Z,"Ok, I don't mean to be rude, this is a real question here, but you talk about ""lamers"" and ""cred whores"" and I admit, those people exist and the do exactly what you claim they do and they do it for the reasons you claim as well... but if you NEED Adobe Audition to tell the difference, they WHY THE F@#$ do you want lossless audio in the first place???    Isn't that as absurd as the lamer posting the fake lossless file in the first place?  The truth is, you cant tell a 128 bit MP3 from a studio digital master by listening to it, but you sure as hell can fit a lot more of the former on your harddrive.  :)  Lossless audio is a major waste of bandwidth, time and gigabytes.  I have read the audiophile rebuttals, (you know, that hi-fi speakers respond differently and what not), but I have not heard it.  And your comment about confirming the lossless aspect proves it, In my humble opinion.  And please, I am not flaming you here.  I would really like a serious answer if you are willing.  "

You can show proof of it using Audition. If you can't hear the difference between a 128 kbps mp3 and 192 kbps mp3, you need to get your hearing checked. Now, whether anyone's ears can hear the difference between 320k mp3 and FLAC, that's a topic for debate..."
,KingKarat,2011-10-13T16:58Z,How do I change the language? I'm starting to get really confused. Thanks.
,raiderette,2011-10-19T05:44Z,"PERFECT! Thank you SO much! All the other ones on here are junk! 

BTW if anyone on here has this error come up: ""The sample rates of the audio input and output devices do not match"" 
there is a video on youtube on how to fix it"

You said you can't hear the difference between a 128kbps mp3 and a master - man this is serious - because the difference is quite large and can normally be spotted using even a cheap headphone by a simple layman.

Please try getting a relatively cheap $15 Sennheiser HD180 or an HD201, and then please check one of your favourite songs at both 128kbps and master. (Remember to let the headphone run for about 100hrs after buying it. Its requires that burning in!)

Hope this helps. :-)............

And regarding, why use audition - you can see the difference visually as a waveform. Its just to confirm your suspicion, where you hear a flac, but you feel that there is something missing/wrong."
,carblueberry,2011-12-13T11:21Z,"BIG PROBLEM:

I have the Adobe CS5 master suite and AcrobatX installed.

After running this Portable Audition, the complete master suite + AcrobatX has stopped working.

Thankfully Dreamweaver still works BUT it completely wiped out all my preferences and almost a 100 snippets that I had created over 1 yr.

I have lost alteast 100hrs of my time. :-(............

Please XxFukenGruvenxX, could you please fix this problem, and could you please explain why this is happening.

I assume this portable thing has edited some of the core files of Adobe in the C drive. Do you know what is happening?"
