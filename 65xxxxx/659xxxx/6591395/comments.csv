,G33KFactor9,2011-08-12T09:29Z,"PPVrip's are somewhere between a TS and an R5 (oops now somebody is gonna start asking bout R5's) in quality. Some end up being fair enough to enjoy, but usually it's littered with pops n crackles and artifacts in the video. -Incidentally- WHY are there so many posts of the same video of the same source, slightly altered by some Gunther in mommy's basement whom thinks he knows what he's doing by running a few filters and a gamma bump, so he/she can post a ""Better"" concoction, when it's really just a polished turd! Now I will certainly not bitch about free shit, ""Don't get me Wrong"" but somebody has too much idle time!    "
