Accused is a British television anthology series. Written and created by Jimmy McGovern, it stars Christopher Eccleston, Benjamin Smith, Juliet Stevenson, Andy Serkis, Marc Warren and Naomie Harris as the accused in each episode. Filming for the series took place around Manchester between May and August 2010 and began airing on BBC One on 15 November 2010. The series was a RSJ Films production for the BBC.

The series follows previous drama series by McGovern, including anthology series The Street and Moving On. Each of the six dramas follow a different character as they await their verdict in court, and tells the story behind how they find themselves accused. A second series of four episodes has been commissioned for broadcast sometime in 2012.
