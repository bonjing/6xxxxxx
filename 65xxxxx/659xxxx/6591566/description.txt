    Most famous for his alter-ego, the ostentatious, androgynous "Ziggy      
    Stardust", Bowie has continually reinvented his music and image. He      
    has had numerous top ten hits in the US & UK, most notably China         
    Girl, Space Oddity, Under Pressure and more. Told through archive        
    interviews (originally thought lost) and rare and unseen footage,        
    this DVD is a worthy addition to any Bowie collection. Items             
    genuinely unseen and never before appeared on DVD including film from    
    the ITN archive. Includes lost and now restored TV interviews from       
    the past and rare film of the singer talking about his career.
