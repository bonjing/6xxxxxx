Hi,

I think you mean the .rar files. It's a compression format like .zip. You can open them with the downloadable software winrar. Download and install it. Be sure to open the .rar (not .r00, .r01, r02 etc...) and extract the video file wherever you like. "
,mgbuesi,2011-08-09T06:30Z,Perfect as always from eztv.  I LOVE what you bring man.  I registered just so I could say that.
[T],MelloYello,2011-08-09T09:48Z,"@Tom_thomas- What are u talking about???????
EZTV never uploads RAR files.  This is an AVI file.  Did you even download it?? You say u can wait for eztv to post??? This is eztv dumbass.  Another troll with a retarded copy and paste statement I guess. "
