Law Of The Order was the major label debut for Shark Island, coming after the release of S'cool Buss, and was supposed to push the band into superstardom. However, even with killer tracks such as Paris Calling, Somebody's Falling and Spellbound the album went largely unnoticed. Even great ballads like Bad For Each Other and Why Should I Believe, as well as a cover of Fleetwood Mac's The Chain, didn't help.
It's really a mystery as to why Shark Island didn't make it big, cause Richard Black is an excellent singer with a good vocal range and sounded spectacular on this disc. The playing of the other band members is also tight throughout the album, and Shark Island was considered the next big thing to come out of Los Angeles. The band should have been huge, but it just was not to be--but Law Of The Order still receives two thumbs up!
