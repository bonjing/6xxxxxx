,xhizors,2011-08-13T09:10Z,"oops my bad! i didn't know how they aired this show. usually when episodes are A and B, it's one after another. So, 303B will be on August 15th! "
,dwashok,2011-08-14T07:29Z,"I know this is an MKV file and divx player should be able to play it but it won't. I'm pretty sure I have all the latest codecs, could someone help me please? Uptokes for everyone!"
,dwashok,2011-08-15T11:09Z,I'm going to try vlc really quick
,dwashok,2011-08-15T11:16Z,hrmmmm vlc works but not divx player INTERESTING
,shimigami777,2011-08-15T11:52Z,"Sorry you're having trouble man. I would have suggested vlc too. Since I got it, I've never had a single problem with video file types."
,Veksler66,2011-10-12T12:09Z,"Don't just try VLC,it kinda won't work sometimes. Try Miro. It's awesome, it's ALL IN ONE. You can get pirate bay in it, download on it, and play music,videos,etc. and it plays any video,music,picture format."
