,MrGoy,2011-08-16T09:08Z,Works perfectly. Make sure you have the latest DirectX drivers installed. I have steam installed and I''m not sure if this is imperative.

,miguelsz3,2011-09-01T13:53Z,"@Squeazer
I might have messed up the instructions... At step 4 try to extract only 1 rar file instead of selecting them all."
,bhadkow,2011-12-05T16:50Z,"follow the instructions,works fine, need latest directx distribution and steam installed.  cheers \m/"
