I was surfing through web searching for C All-in-One Desk Reference for Dummies e-book, but i couldn't find a single place to download it free. Then I had to do some blah blah with amazon.com and i bought it. Well, just paying about 2.26% of the product ;)
Then I thought i should share it with you, but you know, the kindle edition is not a pdf, so when converting it, the converter left an ugly so called water mark in it
