You can better waiting."
,Georgina_Tee,2011-08-10T18:22Z,"7/10 for both audio and picture.

Pretty decent considering its still in theatres "
,Georgina_Tee,2011-08-11T00:03Z,This is actually 6/7  out of 10 a couple of seconds where it freezes or audio cuts out but barely makes a difference. Great film shed a tear at the end. I think its a cam cannot really tell either just looks like an old old film video quality watchable
