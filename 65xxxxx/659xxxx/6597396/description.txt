While growing up in the Great Depression era, Johnny Cash takes an interest in music and eventually moves out of his Arkansas

Vivian. When they got married, they settled in Tennessee and with a daughter, he supported the family by being a salesman. 
He discovers a man who can pursue his dreams and ends up getting a record with the boys. Shortly after that, he was on a 
short tour, promoting his songs, and meets the already famous and beautiful June Carter. Then as they get on the long-term 
tours with June, the boys, and Jerry Lee Lewis, they have this unspoken relationship that grows. But when June leaves the 
tour because of his behavior, he was a drug addict. His marriage was also falling apart, and when he sees June years later at an awards show, he forces June to tour with them again...

*I don't take requests because I don't have time and everyone will fill the comment section with them instead of commenting about quality and other tehnical specs of the movies or say thanks.Thank you for understanding!
*For best performance I suggest you use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback
*These movies were made especially for PC and they don't play on a PS3.If you want to re-encode for PS3 or test for other devices be my guests.
*I'll ask everybody to stop with the "it doesn't work","it's out of sync" comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine.
