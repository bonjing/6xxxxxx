,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-08-25T00:41Z,not a good upload - file size too big considering vid quality is meh and there isnt even 6 channel sound due to AC3. I wish secretmyth would just get this one up :)
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-12-16T03:39Z,"@xxxchromaticxxx:

It's 2hours 33mins movie length !!

It can't be done at this quality for less then about 2,6-2.8 Gb !!

I'm sure this is just the right size for the best quality considering that the ripper's choice was AC3 640 kbps for  a crystal sound [a lot of good music !!]

Thanks kriss_kringle !!"

In order to retain 90-95% of the original detail, using the best encoders and optimal settings, you're looking at an average file size of about 1GB per hour for a 1280x528 movie, and about 1.2GB/hour for full 1280x720.  The numbers can vary a little depending on the content (action, camera pans, forest/water scenes etc.), but those are very close approximations.

CODYBOSS1969 is correct.  This movie is about 2.5 hours, and since it has a 2.40 aspect ratio (1280x528), it should be about 2.5-2.6GB to closely resemble the original blu-ray.  I don't understand people that are ripping all these sub-1GB 720p movies, epsecially the 500-700G files.  Why bother ripping HD resolution if the quality is going to be so bad that a DVD of the same file size would look better?"
