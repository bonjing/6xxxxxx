IDEAL
Series 7

Written by Graham Duff

\\\"An impressive 7th series.\\\"
-The Independant on Sunday

Johnny Vegas returns as Moz in a brand new series of the seriously twisted comedy
dope opera IDEAL. With Ghest stars Janeane Garofalo (West Wing), Kara Tointon
(EastEnders), Rula Lenska (Coronation Street) and rock legend Paul Weller.

When Moz\\\'s finances hit rock bottom, he reluctantly returns to hash dealing.
However, Nicki - the ex who lives next door - is already running her own dealing
business. Soon, a price war kicks off, with each desperately undercutting the other.
Meanwhile, across the landing, the beautiful Carmel and big gay brian set up a very
special brothel.

Psycho Paul\\\'s gang comes under threat from a gang of deadly gingers, whilst
pretentious synth-pop duo Silicone velets finally split - with surprising consequences.
Then, Tilly mistakes some kid\\\'s paintings for outsider artworks by Moz and starts
organising an exhibition. Could love, fame and fortune be just around the corner?
Or will the Red Mist descend and destroy everything?

Always evolving, yet instantly recognisable, IDEAL mixes dark comedy with tension,
thrills, counter cultural satire, hallucinogenic visuals and the coolest music on TV.

\\\"Can leap from straight drama to surrealism to full-blown
musical and back again.\\\"
