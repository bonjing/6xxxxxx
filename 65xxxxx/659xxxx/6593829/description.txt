This is insanity. This video would tend to send newcomers running to the other fellowship if it didn't turn them away from recovery altogether. The participants are from the directlyresponsible crowd yet the new audio only file links to the website controlled now by the planning group. Directlyresponsible doesn't seem capable of grasping that they destroyed the USFA movement.

_redacted_ ummmm, well I am 100% in favor of talking about the absolute importance of anonymity while doing an interview about NA on youtube. I must be too new to get it.

_redacted_ OK, I have thought it over and I do apologize for my sarcasm. I seldom post here or on the other sites. I will share that in my life when barriers continually are placed in the way of something I am trying to do I need to surrender that my wish is not God's will or God would remove the barriers.

_redacted_ The video is so absurd that it begs for sarcastic commentary. No apology necessary as far as I am concerned.
What I know is it took up 9+ minutes of my life that will never be returned.

_redacted_ You have the wrong people, they were all about re-writing the traditions, I guess in their version of the traditions, publicity in the Bill Wilson style is a good thing. Well, I'm off to bed. this is for the birds what I've read so far.

_redacted_ They are all about the Traditions as they apply to those not in agreement with their beliefs.

_redacted_ Just saying crazy is as crazy does.For the life of me I cannot understand what the heck they were thinking by posting this.I have always been taught we went to carry a clear message and to tell the truth as quickley and as simple as possiable. I have a question, why would anyone with a loved one in active addiction suggest that suffering person go get well with a fellowship with these beliefs. KRAZY

_redacted_ I don't think anyone not in the fellowship will really understand what is being talked about in this video. As far as the rest of us go, we'll just have to decide whether this guy is the Moses that he thinks he is, or more like the Charlie Sheen that he actually is. Hopefully he doesn't fool too many people. That is what is actually tearing our fellowship apart.

_redacted_ I only placed it on here so you can be aware of what is being sent out. It is odd that it became "private" after such a short time.

_redacted_ Yeah, I watched it before it was made private, I just thought it was ironic that they recanted after having gone forward with such a thing. Maybe there is hope.

_redacted_ These people seem incapable of grasping that there is anyone not tripping over themselves to agree with them. I'm sure the uploader with his "anarchist" views posted the video without permission and was aghast when he saw some negative comments left, then quickly changed the video from "unlisted" to "private". I downloaded the file in anticipation of that and will upload it when I get back home tomorrow or Monday. Anybody up for doing some video editing? Wait...can't really improve on that performance. Bet I go to hell for that.
