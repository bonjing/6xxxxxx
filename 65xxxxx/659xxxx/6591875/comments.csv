Sorry... But the problem is that running the software leaves a few processes open after closing it down which creates problems with other software.

Better is to download the latest trial software from http://www.presentation-3d.com/products/animation-3d.html and then do a torrent search for the latest keygen for Animation Maker 11.09 (the latest release from Aurora) and use that to register the software. Unfortunately that torrent is not on TPB yet.

Works like a charm as long as you close your firewall for Animation Maker to call home."

Had to Cntrl Alt Delete to close it down, but still no mouse function, had to restart PC through taskmanager. Tried it twice with same result. First time I had that experience in 15 years of PC use. My opinion: This torrent is CRAP, but the software itself is good...if I can find it. Make your own decision but I wouldn't download this torrent."
