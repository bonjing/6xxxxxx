If you watched TV...this show makes it seem like anyone with no experience can just go out in the wild and make a killing in the Gold industry.

Gold Rush: Alaska is another one of those "reality" shows which follows a group of wanna be miners who are all affected by the latest recession, and have collectively decided to risk it all and go all the way to Alaska to strike it rich by doing something that has a success rate lower than landing on the Moon. Gold Mining.

It's understandable that people who are in desperate situations would resort to anything to make it when the economy is down... But for our main protagonists The Hoffmans to give up a airplane business and spend over $100,000 everything they have on a long shot doesn't seem to be a good idea.

Adding to the chaos, is the idea that they can just drag their families and children up to the wild wilderness where Grizzly Bears are known for eating people. Especially when Todd Hoffman's daughter nearly dies from a seizure over 1,000 miles away from a hospital. What seems to be the worst is the unrealistic timetable they expect to find gold. When other miners have spent more money and years of searching with no success, they think they can get gold in less than three months. And then there is of course the fighting. Todd shows himself more of a Bully than a true leader.

Not only that, but the added "mistakes" made by our "working-class-heroes" every week makes you wonder if we're going to see one of them get killed on Television. Their lack of experience shows in the dangerous crazy things they do. Their decision making defies logic.

It makes you really wonder what is real in this show, and what is done for the cameras. Still, final verdict is out. But mostly people are watching this to see if anyone dies. Then the ratings will go up.
