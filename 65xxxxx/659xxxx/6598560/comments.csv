,Ravaner,2011-08-12T12:15Z,Why would you play a game that's already been completed? Seems to defeat the point of playing a game to me.

There are many who still learns from the saved game and if they dont make it themselves they can play the game with upgraded powers if they want with saved games.

Its just if u dont want to play the whole game again but want to relive it.
