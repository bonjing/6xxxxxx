The story has completed fully. 

I have done almost all the missions.

I saved files for various missions.

In my house at Oros you will find almost all weapons,clothing and other valuables 

in the chests and cupboards. Also i have houses at other places too.

Many spells of magic has been created and if u want them to work really easy just 

increase the cards in them to maximum. My favourite spell was jump as i did it on 

me and my horse and i can reach any place.    


 




Be sure to create backup before doing any replacement.
