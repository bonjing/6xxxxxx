,Klipnotica,2011-08-10T19:49Z,"RAR is awsome, usually makes the downloads faster as far as i can tell. please seed"
,nomer8,2011-08-11T18:16Z,"faster? intresting.. always think that i'm limit only my internet speed.
and if i want seed, i must store rar. but when i extract files, i dont need rar anymore.. so, dont wonder, when speed is so low.."
