I'd never heard of Taco Bell before I saw Demolition Man, but I pretty much grasped straight away that it was a restaurant franchise... why on earth they changed it to Pizza Hut for the European release I'll never know!

Some people might find the dubbing hilarious, but I love Demolition Man, and think it's a great movie, please, please bring back Taco Bell.

This is exactly the same Pizza Hut version as the earlier BOZX KiNGS release:
