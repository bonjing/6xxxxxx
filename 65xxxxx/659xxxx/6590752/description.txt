Notes
I tried to cut out as much of the annoying concert presenters as possible without losing any of the performance. Thus the many fades out and in. These were also commercial breaks for this televised special. I split the major interview segments into separate tracks for those that just want to enjoy the show. This is NOT the entire 1-hour concert, just what was televised. The real set list looks like this:

Born This Way
Just Dance
Poker Face
Telephone
Alejandro
YoÃ¼ and I
Hair
Bad Romance
The Edge of Glory
Encore: Judas

Hopefully, the three missing tracks will turn up soon! 


And, as always, TRADE FREELY AND NEVER SELL!!!
