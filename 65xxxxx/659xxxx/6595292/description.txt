Description of the Game :
"The racing is fast, satisfying, and chaotic. Ultimately, THQâ€™s hybrid pricing hinders the package more than it helps it, and players are forced to play the same tracks all too often. If youâ€™re a fan of the series or just want a good racing game and donâ€™t mind downloading the rest of the content at a later date, be sure to check out MX vs. ATV: Alive."
