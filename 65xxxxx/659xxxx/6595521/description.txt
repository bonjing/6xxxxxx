The Hour is a 2011 BBC six-part television drama series, written by Abi Morgan and starring Ben Whishaw, Dominic West, Romola Garai and Anna Chancellor. It is set on a British topical news programme in 1956, at the time of the Suez Crisis. It premiered on BBC Two on 19 July 2011.

With a highly competitive, sharp-witted and passionate love triangle at the heart of the series, it's through the lives of enigmatic Bel and her rivals, Freddie and Hector, that viewers will witness the decade on the threshold of change ï¿½â‚¬â€œ from the ruthless sexual politics behind the polite social faÃ§ade of the Fifties to the revelations that redefined the world for a new generation. Over the six episodes, the interplay and intense ambitions between our rising news team play out against the backdrop of a mysterious murder and Freddie's controversial and dangerous investigation (BBC).
[edit] Characters

Ben Whishaw plays Freddie Lyon, a brilliant and outspoken journalist, whose passion endlessly lands him in trouble. Getting to the truth of a story can be a dangerous and risky business, and it's Bel, his contemporary and best friend, who is always there to bail him out. For Freddie, Bel is so much more as well ï¿½â‚¬â€œ if only he were brave enough to tell her.

Romola Garai plays Bel Rowley, spirited and ambitious, and facing the most exciting and daunting challenge of her life ï¿½â‚¬â€œ running The Hour. Can her passion for the truth survive the political pressure the job will bring ï¿½â‚¬â€œ and will her friendship with Freddie survive her undeniable attraction to front man Hector?.

Dominic West plays Hector Madden, charming, charismatic ï¿½â‚¬â€œ a man whose upbringing and education have instilled in him a sense of entitlement, and whose glamorous young wife has the family connections to get him the job as front man on The Hour. But beneath the confident faÃ§ade Hector has a lot to prove. Bel provides the challenge ï¿½â‚¬â€œ and the spark.
