         Ongoing flirtations on the part of Deena and Pauly may        
         escalate into a physical relationship between the two         
         roommates; Snooki is propositioned by Mike to improve upon    
          their bond; Ron and Sammi find it difficult to be friends.

         MTV is now airing this show fully upconverted on the          
         HD channel instead of Windowboxed as was done in the          
         past. However, it is still clearly not full HD, instead       
         being roughly the same as Fox widescreen (Hell's Kitchen      
          and such). Accordingly, we will continue to tag as WS.PDTV.
