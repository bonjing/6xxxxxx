Two Dogs Software TaskSurfer v1.1.11 MacOSX Incl Keymaker-CORE

Full-power task management doesnâ€™t mean hard-to-use
TaskSurfer gives you all of the tools you need to manage things the way you want. Stick things in folders, use contexts to decide where and when to work on stuff, or tag it with a location and let your Mac sort it out for you. Go crazy with tags and use the Tag Browser to keep it sane. Because TaskSurfer is written on top of core Mac OS X technologies, youâ€™ll be up and running right out of the box.

Cloud Syncing
If weâ€™re going to spend time in front of a computer, weâ€™d rather spend it in front of our Macs. But thatâ€™s not always possible, and thatâ€™s why TaskSurfer synchronizes your tasks to Toodledo, the web-based task management service. If you donâ€™t get to use a Mac at work or on the road, you can access your tasks from any web browser.

No lock-in
Many popular iPhone and iPad task management applications sync with Toodledo (including Two Dogsâ€™ own forthcoming iPhone/iPad apps), so youâ€™re not locked into someone elseâ€™s idea of what mobile task management should be.

Full of Snow Leopard goodness
TaskSurfer takes advantage of the good things in Mac OS X Snow Leopard, like 64-bit processing to use all the power of your Mac, and Core Location so that your Mac knows where you are.

*** When using TPB please read these important notes: 
-----------------------------------------------------

01. AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02. To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03. If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantine then look at History or something similar).

04. To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:

    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6487418

05. Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06. Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07. Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08. Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09. Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10. Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11. In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12. In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13. Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

14. Comments are welcome, unlike ranting, trolling, whining, etc.

15. No Promises ... No Debts!

To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally 
posting fake comments & files. Their meaning is just trying to spread 
confusion and to frustrate TPB and it's users. 
Less downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
