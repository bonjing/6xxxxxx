Thanks for uploading these Aciaeiig! Hope you upload the rest of the seasons you have soon :)"
,Bodhi2010,2012-05-21T03:10Z,"i got seasons 4-9 in HDTV 720p but i can`t see them cause they are too big
every episode is around 850MB 

if you want them then give me access to a seedbox so i can put them there slowly (one season/week)

you can contact me on bvlist.com (shoutbox) or email me at Bodhi2010@ymail.com"
