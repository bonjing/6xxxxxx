Marine and her friends have only six days left to find the four remaining warriors and make it to the showdown in Mystrock! With such tight schedules and dramatic events piling up, Marineâ€™s nerves really are pulled in every direction and exhaustion is just around the corner.
But Jeanne, the tiny fairy, is back! And this alone weights a lot in the balance.
