Enjoy The Game!

The object of the game is to combine three or more stones of the same color diagonally, horizontally or vertically.

Pieces fall from above (a bit like in tetris). Each piece is composed of a certain number of pre-colombian styled stone heads of a certain color. You can rotate the pieces and change their color arrangement too. Then you have it fall down where you want to make a match.

There are two play modes: Adventure or Arcade. I seem to remember that in Adventure mode you have a fixed time limit and a number of stones to break (by matching them), while in Arcade you have one challenge per level. For example, you must reach a certain amount of combinations (sometimes specific combos) to get to the next level.
