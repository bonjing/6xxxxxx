Mark Savage from BBC Music described the song as a funky, loping guitar groove for to a night out on the town, which Rihanna dedicated to "all the semi-alcoholics in the world".[10] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy praised the use of interpolating Lavigne's song, calling it "unbelievably catchy", as well as commenting that it will be a success in bars and clubs, due to the references of alcohol and going out of a weekend in the lyrics.[12] Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush also commended the song and it's musical style, saying "The song is infused with the tropical, island groove that she has explored on â€˜Loudâ€™ and which harks back to her upbringing in Barbados."[13] Sciarretto also noted that the song would be very popular in bars and clubs because of the lyrical content.[13] Bill Lamb from About.com stated that "rocking bar singalong 'Cheers (Drink To That)' intriguingly blends Rihanna's occasional robotic style with the voices of the crowd in addictive repetition
