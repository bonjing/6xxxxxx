Description of the Game :
Man vs. Wild is a video game inspired by the Man vs. Wild survival television series. In it, the player takes on the role of host Bear Grylls to survive the hardships of various environments. The game features five different areas to survive: the Rockies, the Everglades, the Sahara, a deserted jungle island, and Patagonia. Developers Scientifically Proven and F84 Games say that real geo-mapping terrain data has been used to create the environments. Stages begin with clips from the show in which Bear describes the dangers present in the area and then parachutes out of a helicopter. The essential goal is to make it from this initial drop zone to a final extraction point.
