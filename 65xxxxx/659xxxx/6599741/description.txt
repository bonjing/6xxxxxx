From School Library Journal:
YA-An attractive, oversized, well-illustrated introduction to a wide variety of written scripts used from Roman times to modern days. The detailed, practical instructions for 26 styles focus on step-by-step, clear visuals, as well as on the proper equipment-brushes, pens, pencils, paper, and ink. A brief history with examples from calligraphic masters introduces each style, making this book not only a practical working manual, but also a useful resource for art history classes.

Review:
The skills and techniques of calligraphy are explained in a fine guide which details key elements of letter writing and uses clear examples to guide beginners. Lettering examples are done in different hues of color, which can emphasize textures and stylistic contrasts. One of the best beginner's guides available. -- Midwest Book Review
