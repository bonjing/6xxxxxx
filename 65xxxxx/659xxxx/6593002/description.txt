How come you press harder on a remote control when you know the battery is dead? so you better seed to get speed ;)

well this was a load of work, kept me busy for days. The cam itself had a lot of problems.
Firstly the Movie had 3 different stages of brightness gamma problems. The aspect is wrong, the light exposure is wrong, the colours are off. Needed a complete makeover.
Had to cut it in 3 parts and do every part differently as needed, fixed the aspect, the brightness, tried to give the video more life. black is black again, removed the 40 sec company logo at the beginning which shaked a lot.
got very nice in the end.

Audio 

Imagines Audio was good, still had some noise and hiss problems throughout, some really annoying ticking noise was in the second half of the movie. took hours to fix that. also some audio turbolence at 1h6m where you could hardly understand what was said for 30 secs is now nearly gone. removed the hiss the noise and brought some life back into the line.
fixed some sync issues along.
its now really watchable and will do till some screener comes along.
enjoy

ps: i heard the end is missing, well wouldnt call that missing, what is missing is him saying the word "you" and the rolling endcredits
doesnt bother me ;)
