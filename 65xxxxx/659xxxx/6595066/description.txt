FLCL (ãƒ•ãƒªã‚¯ãƒª Furi Kuri?, pronounced in English as Fooly Cooly) is an original video animation series written by YÅji Enokido, directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki and produced by the FLCL Production Committee, which included Gainax, Production I.G, and Starchild Records.

FLCL follows Naota Nandaba, a twelve-year-old boy living in the fictional Japanese suburb of Mabase, and his interactions with Haruko Haruhara, who arrives in the quiet suburb, drawn by the industrial town houses and the Medical Mechanica building.

The English adaptation of the series was first licensed by Synch-Point and Geneon Entertainment, which released the DVDs and soundtrack respectively, but then went out of print in 2006. In January 2010, however, Funimation Entertainment announced that they would be re-releasing the series on DVD and releasing for the first time on Blu-ray.[1] In addition, the series aired on TV in America on Cartoon Network\'s Adult Swim several times. The series is also avaliable via Netflix, Hulu, iTunes, and on Funimation Entertainment\'s website.
