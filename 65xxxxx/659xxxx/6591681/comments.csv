,fuzz407,2011-09-14T22:40Z,DONT download. I have been watching plenty of films from here fine and this is one of the first that doesn't work right. The audio is FUCKED
[T],drock232,2011-11-18T12:54Z,Sorry fellas I was using newer version of this ripping product and it rubbish I'm working on re-encoding.

Movie itself looks rubbish too unless you like watching 2 people floating around for an hour with no sharks to be seen."
