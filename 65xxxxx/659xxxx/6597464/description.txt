Happy Holidays With Bing And Frank (1957)

This is amazing -what a find! Nancy Sinatra found this FULL COLOR episode from Frank Sinatra\\\'s 1957 television series, and it\\\'s simply a wonderful treat. Frank invites Bing Crosby over to his house for Christmas Eve and the two sing all the great holiday songs.

What a retro-christmas gift! 15 songs in all, the entire DVD is about 90 minutes with extras. Of course it closes with Bing singing WHITE CHRISTMAS and Frank joining in - it\\\'s like a re-teaming from the film HIGH SOCIETY, they look and act about the same.

This 30-minute show was released on DVD on October 7, 2003 as \\\"Happy Holidays With Bing and Frank\\\". As an extra, the DVD includes an approximately 45 minute question and answer session with daughters Nancy Sinatra and Tina Sinatra after a special public screening of the long unseen show in Los Angeles in 2003.
