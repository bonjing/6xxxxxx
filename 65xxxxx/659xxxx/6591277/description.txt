                Intent.
                Ronnie and Matt are stumped when they investigate the
                murders of David and Elaine Lerner, who were stabbed
                to death as they slept. The Lerners seemed to have
                been universally loved, and there is not a single
                lead which points to grievances against them - were
                they really the intended victims? As crown
                prosecutors Jake Thorne and Alesha Phillips try to
                navigate a case in which the suspect has no apparent
                motive or intent to commit the crime, can they make a
                murder charge stick? Meanwhile, Jake's old mentor
                Margaret Rumsfield argues that the accused should
                only face manslaughter charges.
