[M],Agricola,2011-08-12T02:08Z,"It isnt breaking any rules stevo, hes told you it has a password"
[S],velvet.,2011-08-12T02:10Z,"If you created a torrent that you just wanted to share with a few friends, why didn't you simply email the .torrent file to them, instead of posting it here on a public site for tens of millions of people to see?"
[V],cristo,2011-11-21T23:22Z,Files of this size are to big to e-mail you need to use a free app like Pando which allows up to 1GB for free
