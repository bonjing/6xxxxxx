,VicVega,2011-08-11T17:26Z,"For some reason, playing this takes more CPU than usual. TrueHD track sounds crap. Tried on 3 different players and on 2 computers. I'm going to try https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4879784/Naked_Weapon_2002_Blu-ray_720p_x264_DD51-MySiLU instead."
,peekowang,2011-08-14T03:20Z,there's something fishy with that link from Vic Vega..... it pops up in a new window and there's a red line thru the https: part in the address bar in google chrome... 
,slipper92,2011-08-14T09:29Z,"well yeah,

truehd audio can't sound like crap"
,siddshak,2011-08-18T14:09Z,plz seed...download is very slow.
,VicVega,2011-08-19T05:51Z,"@peekowang There's nothing fishy with the link, the red stuff is normal behavior; your browser is warning you that the site's certificate is verified by an untrusted authority. That's completely normal. Accept the certificate and you're on your way. If you don't like it, replace HTTPS with HTTP instead. But I highly recommend using HTTPS where available. The more awareness you have about security the better.

Oh and by the way that torrent worked better for me. Movie is crap of course, but the chick is hot.

Link without certificate:

[V],ExtraTorrentRG,2011-10-16T16:17Z,"The audio is perfect, i don't know about MySilu release, but this audio and is much better than that.If anyone gets problem, it is probably the PC or audio device."
,tpbuser8,2011-12-04T06:02Z,Tried to play with MPC on my PC and having problem with the audio (video is 10/10).  Audio is there but sounded tinny and attenuated.  Is it bec. I'm trying to play 7.1 audio on a stereo PC?  Anyone having the same problem or is able to get play it w/o problem?  My other .mkv movies play fine with no audio problem.  Thanks in advance for any help.
[V],ExtraTorrentRG,2011-12-29T18:50Z,May be the o/p is not supported in your PC.In any case i tested this in ASUS M4A89GTD PRO motherboard supporting Dolby audio and 7.1 ch sound and it works alright.
