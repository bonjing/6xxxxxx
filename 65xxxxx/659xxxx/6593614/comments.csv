What do you think of this? I personally think it's bullshit to create a reversed placebo effect, or he just talks about converted stuff. This is original and the same files as the bought ones right?

(Yes, piracy is a problem for us just as it is the music industry. Many of the free doses offered through torrents are fake. Users could potentially download them and not achieve the correct effects. I-Doser is the only authorized dealer of our products. If you have obtained them through any other site, donâ€™t expect the same level of results, if any.)"

I don't understand, why 3 times in a row the same?"

Please, type in plane English, I can't grasp a word!

Are you writing actually in Chinese?"
,FyxYt,2011-08-15T05:27Z,"There is an application available for Linux called Freedoser. I have a link to a simple-enough installation guide here:

http://www.khattam.info/play-i-doser-drg-files-in-linux-with-freedoser-2009-04-26.html

It's free, just like it should be.

By the way, I-dose guy, perhaps if you had some freebies, then maybe  we all wouldn't have to resort to using intelligence to get these. College is too expensive for this."

""system.windows.documents.run is not visual or visual3d""

,lolsack,2011-10-21T20:32Z,I'll try and track down some working ones then.
,Ido5e,2012-01-28T06:36Z,I'm pretty sure that the website to convert drg to sbg isnt up.Also could you possibly get Heaven's Door and Satan's Jackhammer as they are two new premium doses
,xSKENTONx,2012-01-29T05:49Z,"AcidQH.drg size not a original.

128KB size are original paid."
,dark_illusions,2012-02-18T05:40Z,"easy way for this to work without all the hasstle less u want it in mp3 or whatever for portable.

inside this file theres a exe called IDoserPremiumSetup.exe just install that and no need to convert anything install that then take the dose files and add them to your dose files folder in my documents (you will find like 5 others or 6 drg files in the folder where they go) and just copy all the files into there from the download and open the program and works fine"
