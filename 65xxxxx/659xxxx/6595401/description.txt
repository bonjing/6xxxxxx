REALLY BIG SKY! A super fast, twin analogue shooter for the modern age!

Way over in the big void of space live some aliens. They coveted [your planet] and would do anything to live there themselves. So what\\\\\\\'s [your planet] to do? Yeah, blast through them all! Face off against waves of enemies, bosses, big laser planets, blackholes, wormholes, giant lasers, planets and asteroids across 7 game modes!

Everything is procedurally generated from the way YOU play the game, from attack patterns, strength of bosses and enemies, pacing between waves, generosity of bonuses... etc!

Features a comprehensive statistics system to let you hone your mad laser skills!
