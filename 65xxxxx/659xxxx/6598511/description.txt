This is a look at American personality types and American culture
broadly speaking. Great blondes!

The problem with the mindset most seen in this movie is that negativity is the
order of the day along with extremist views that lack adequate foundation in 
humanistic wisdom, a tendency to over-assert nonetheless, an inability to deal 
with issues with intelligent articulation based fully on real feelings and 
thoughts that are of Euro-Humanist origin in what we consider the best quality
of engagement etc. There is much mean spirited banter and little of real 
intelligence in what is said. Belittling others unfairly, calling down women
insanely (and men too) who arent made of the same stuff as the arrogant Bush
personality types shown for all to see in what is superficial levels of brain engagement with reality of how they come across. Somewhat like a "My dinner 
with andre" New York style Part II. Lots of wicked like personality fixation
in the genre of scripting.

Nonetheless, it has its moments and I do love the Christianly spirit of the 
blonde gals in the movie as none have achieved the reputation they have in 
California of being the best of such Irish spitited beauty outside of Australia -
although Im quickly homesick to be back there or in Germany or France equally
or Italy even especially too!
