Well then you have made something wrong.
I have deleted iphlpapi.dll and double clicked aoe3y.exe and game ran without problem.
Also I tried other expansion and original version and all was fine."

,Aeochlon,2011-10-30T11:28Z,I can't find the flt-aoey BIN File!
,marcus.ei,2011-11-02T05:59Z,Daemon tools cant find a single file to mount.. the flt-aoe file spoken of in the setup instructions seems to be missing? 
,10001101,2011-12-12T00:17Z,"Easy to install and works on Win7SP1/64bit(Without compatibility mode), using common computer sense.  Three times: Setup then find patch(WarChiefs patch is hidden a bit compared to the others).  Then copy and replace the game executables with those that don't have CD checks.

The only error is the packaging and the readme.  For some reason an unneeded ISO is included and multiple cracked EXEs of each version are included.  Daemon tools is not needed and there is no need to mount anything.  Also Win7/64bit users need not copy the IPHLPAPI.DLL to begin with in the one crack folder."
