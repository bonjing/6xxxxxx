Quote:
This new series is ripped right out of the real-life drama unfolding on the Mexico-Arizona border! FEEDING GROUND reaches a large and diverse audience no matter your personal point of view on the issue. In this factious story, a famine caused by Blackwell Industries drives Diego Busqueda, a noble â€œcoyote,â€ to lead a band of Mexican border crossers across the unforgiving Devilâ€™s Highway, a desert cursed with blistering days and deadly nights. Back home, Diegoâ€™s daughter Flaca discovers that something hungrier prowls the factory fields. Stalked and persecuted, can the Busqueda family maintain their dreams of immigration or will the horrors of the desert tear them apart?


Note that in theme of cross border relations that the issues were pulished as english/spanish flipbooks, both languages were included in the files
