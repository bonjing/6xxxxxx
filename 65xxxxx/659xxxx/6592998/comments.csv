Looking at the size of this file, is this the entire country of Canada?  I'm suprised at how small this is."
,Ipmark,2011-08-10T08:24Z,"This map cover the entire country of Canada.
The map is small because in Canada there are few roads.
However, this map is larger than the previous release of 15MB."
,shrifty,2011-08-12T03:57Z,I just got back from Toronto and Kitchner and was able to update the maps while I was up there.  Works great!

,Ipmark,2011-09-13T12:47Z,"How to see this map on the PC:

Download Basecamp from Garmin website, it's an update but if you haven't a previous version already installed on the PC, simply decompress the executable with Winrar in a temporary folder and launch BCMAIN.msi, then overwrite the original Basecamp.exe with the patched one (search TPB for Basecamp v3.2.2 Patched exe).

Download Gmaptool (free, search the web, latest version is the v0.6.0b) and install in the PC.

With Gmaptool load a map (gmapsupp.img) goto to Options > Flag Advanced Options; goto Join section, set Output File (ex.gmapsup2.img), Mapset (click on Info button to see the original one, however you can change it as you want), flag Version in header > set Ms to 0 (zero), click on Join selected.

Copy the modified map on a pendrive (Garmin folder)

Start Basecamp, it wil recognize the pendrive with the map, select the map.

Enjoy !! "
