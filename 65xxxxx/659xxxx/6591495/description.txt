Celebration Collectors Edition is exactly what it is, This four-disc edition is not official.
It includes everything from Madonna's back catalog, maybe I've forgotten something but let me know so I can correct it. All songs that are not on the official release is on this ... plus some more:) Disk 5.6 & 7 will feature a collection of remixes, radio edits, etc. ...
