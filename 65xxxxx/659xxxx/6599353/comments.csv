,Fangular,2011-10-22T12:02Z,"Hi EvilCloudStrife - I was wondering if you would maybe come to the rescue of Project Runway fans yet again and upload the most recent episode? (It's S09E13 - 'Finale: Part One'. It screened last Thursday night in the US but *none* of the three regular PR uploaders have made it available.. I don't understand *why* they would upload a whole season *except* for the last two episodes.. but that's what they seem to be doing. So if yoy get this message, and you don't mind receiving requests, is there any chance that you could come to the rescue once again?

Cheers,
Fangular"
