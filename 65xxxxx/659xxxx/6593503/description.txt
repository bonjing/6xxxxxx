AN INTRODUCTION TO â€œCINICO TVâ€

Cinico TV was a television series broadcast during the late 80s and early 90s on RAI3, traditionally known as the â€œcultural channelâ€; in those years RAI3 was the most open and innovative channel on Italian television. It was a revolutionary series which dropped out of nowhere into the tranquil Italian television landscape like a UFO: an object rained down from nothing, never before witnessed, unidentifiable. The series consisted of short sketches, each one lasting only a few minutes. The creators were Daniele CiprÃ¬ and Franco Maresco, both in their thirties and from Palermo. They shot on a very low budget; they were directors, writers, scenographers and directors of photography. Their set: the deserted outskirt of a Palermo, which portrayed not just itself but also acted as a metaphor of the world. Before the lens various characters â€“ stationary or warily moving about â€“ became the protagonists of the series through their dialogue with a mysterious and imperious off-scene voice. These characters are loaded with devastating tragicomic humanity; characters, at best borderline, more often than not beyond the normality of everyday life. It was the distorted world of the elderly cyclist Francesco Tirone, the flautulist Paviglianiti, the aphasic Miranda in his white underwear and Pietro Giordano, who, with unflinching seriousness, assumed the thankless role of sewer rat, serial rapist, human excrement lying in a ditchâ€¦ The refined black and white cinematography, the Sicilian sky filled with clouds, deeply contrast the wearied bodies and the sub-human squalor. The tone of the series was one of dark, exhilarating, metaphysical comedy. As a programme it was either loved or hated, it had the ability to elicit feelings of repulsion just as it was able to stimulate intellectual debate on: trash culture, the aesthetics of ugly, post-modernism, the post-historic world and the end of humanity. An enthusiastic critique foud shades of Beckett and Pasolini. Over the years the popularity and singular acuteness of the series have ensured its cult status.
