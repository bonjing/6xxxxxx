This is John Williams conducting the \\\'Star Wars\\\' music under the eye of George Lucas....only with a special, hand-picked orchestra, the Skywalker Symphony.

It\\\'s a great album from 1991, a little gem tucked away from the lean \\\'Star Wars\\\' years between the OT and the PT (or the special editions, at least).   Don\\\'t know why it\\\'s been forgotten, because the music has never sounded better, in my opinion.
