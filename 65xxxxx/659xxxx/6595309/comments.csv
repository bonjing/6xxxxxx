Its blocky, blurred because of very low bitrate. Don't take this offensive, this is just my feedback. And the sample has some other language only. No English Audio in the sample file."
[V],.Dude.,2011-08-10T16:55Z,"Yup the sample only has the hindi audio,But in the movie its dual.
N yup i had to lower the bitrate just to compress it to a small size.
Actually,u would get that bitrate prints already uploaded for bout 600-650 mb file size."
[V],.Dude.,2011-08-10T17:04Z,"Gimme a few days,il upload the hustler!"
,blumacaw,2011-08-11T10:17Z,"600 - 650mb will be the ideal size, cos nowadays 80% of people have LCD monitors not less than 20"" so its is better to have a better bitrate."
