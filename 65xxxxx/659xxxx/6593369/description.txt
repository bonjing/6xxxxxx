The Magic School Bus

"Take chances, make mistakes, get messy!"
An animated Edutainment Show which ran on PBS in The Nineties. It was adapted from a series of picture books written by Joanna Cole and illustrated by Bruce Degen, but who remembers that? (Well, Reading Rainbow viewers might.) It was later made into a set of computer games, as well. The series follows an eccentric/insane schoolteacher as she takes her elementary school class on very exotic field trips which teach scientific topics. These adventures are made possible by (you guessed it) a magical school bus. (And Viewers Like You, of course.) The show's Wacky Homeroom consisted of:
Ms. Valerie Frizzle: Inexplicably Awesome. A Crazy Awesome Great Gazoo class teacher.
Arnold Perlstein: The Butt Monkey (possibly making him The Woobie), practices Informed Judaism, occasionally played as The So-Called Coward; his cousin Janet is an Insufferable Genius Drop-In Character who shows up about once a season
Wanda Li: The Genki Girl and the Tsundere
Carlos Ramon: The Plucky Comic Relief and Pungeon Master; also a Weekend Inventor in earlier episodes
Phoebe Terese: Naive Everygirl and aspiring Friend to All Living Things, started off in the books as a NaÃ¯ve Newcomer
Tim: The Generic Guy (He could perhaps have been an Author Avatar)
Dorothy Ann ("D.A."): The Smart Girl in a Magic Skirt
Ralphie Tennelli: The Agent Mulder and an early form of Deadpan Snarker, constant victim of the First Name Ultimatum ("Ralphie...!") and Tough Room.
Keesha Franklin: The Agent Scully (though the existence of a magical bus doesn't seem to faze her)
Liz: Ms. Frizzle's sentient pet lizard. Liz can't talk, but that doesn't stop her from being able to drive the bus and such (which must be difficult considering that her legs aren't long enough to reach the pedals).
It's also worth noting that the show was popular enough to go into syndication, which is VERY rare for a PBS show
