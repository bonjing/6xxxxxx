The heroically bequiffed Welshman, runner-up in 2007â€™s UK X Factor TV talent contest, follows his 2009 release O Fortuna with this third album. Whereas during his tenure with Sony the classically-trained baritoneâ€™s output was largely restricted to the classical crossover genre, here he is given free rein to let rip on a wide selection of pop- and show-oriented material, including a cover of the Annie Lennox classic â€œNo More â€˜I Love Youâ€™sâ€.
