"Pilot" 	



The episode starts as a crowd of fans trying to get into The Amanda Show, and Penelope Taynt, who is a 12-year-old Amanda fanatic and puts the word "please" at the end of almost every sentence, would do anything to meet Amanda. Meanwhile, Amanda makes her entrance by a helicopter. But when the pilot falls asleep, Amanda has to jump out of the plane and lands on the set. Kenan Thompson and Josh Server (who have worked with Amanda from All That), deliver Amanda a pizza and wish her luck on her new show. Then, The Amanda Show starts its first sketch with Judge Trudy, who favors the children and gives out ridiculous sentences to adults. Then we meet The Klutzes, a family whose members always break things and say "Not a problem".
