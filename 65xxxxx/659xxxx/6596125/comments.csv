,Daker9,2011-08-13T01:26Z,For some reason this stalls and pixels like it is corrupt ...too bad but be forewarned
,meothui,2011-08-13T10:01Z,All UK movies are sucks big time. Why the f those englishman keep lying that they're any good?
,euphoria4949,2011-08-13T13:45Z,"@meothui

I'M SURE THIS MOVIE ISN'T AS BAD AS YOUR GRAMMAR!! 

Before you ""Try"" to slag off a country that gave you everything you have today, including the language you obviously can't speak and seem to be struggling with, maybe you should consider getting an education first so you don't embarrass yourself any more than you already have!
Oh, and yes I am assuming you're American! Not sure what gave it away, maybe it was your need to voice an idiotic opinion that no one cares about or your hunger to shit on everyone because of your delusions of grandeur!

Have a nice day :)"
,SergeantSpoon,2011-08-13T18:26Z,"Lovely little movie, quality is good. :)"
,HUman_Shield,2011-08-13T21:47Z,Reading all of the comments above I thought this to be a good movie. Boy was I wrong. It was witty but boring. Wasted 90 minutes of my life.
,felix_703,2011-08-13T22:30Z,"great film
quality is very good
seriously this is a very good movie
I actually enjoy it more when I'm drunk, don't ask me but I recommend to try it that way ;)"
,cookesrc,2011-08-14T03:55Z,"@ euphoria4949

Most Americans speak english, sounds like eurotrash to me"
,euphoria4949,2011-08-14T08:54Z,"@cookesrc

That's laughable! Trust me Americans do NOT speak English!"
,infected_scarz,2011-08-14T15:27Z,"@cookesrc
LOL! I bet most most of those 'eurotrash' people are way smarter than the average hamburger eating hillbilly American... By the way; all movies made in the UK are far better than those fake American movies."
,SpiritSoul1977,2011-08-14T20:01Z,"People, let's try to bear in mind, that like everything else, movies are a subjective thing.

What appeals to one, will not appeal to another. That does not reflect either way, on the content. But it shows, that what one person finds to be ""good"", and another ""bad"", differs in varying degrees.

I personally LOVE this film. But that's me. I'm sure that not everyone will feel the same way.

To summarize, you too will LOVE this film, IF
1)You like dark comedies and/or British films
2)Liked the following movies : The Royal Tenenbaums, Rushmore, The Darjeeling Limited.

ps. Watch the trailer on youtube, BEFORE you download a film. The trailer will give you some idea as to whether you're likely to like the film or not.

Now...let's everyone hug, and make up~ :)"
,cookesrc,2011-08-15T05:46Z,"@ euphoria4949

Can you not tell the difference between poor grammar and English as a second language?

I'm eating a burger right now, picturing myself having rough sex with your queen."
,Delron41,2011-08-16T04:53Z,Fucking classic British humor. Laughed my ass off. Thanks for the upload!
,PandaBearUK,2011-08-16T17:42Z,"Ok so i dont often log in and comment but i just want to say Thanks! A10 V10

-To the haters please dont bother posting your reviews. Most of us a, dont give a shit what you think and b, already know what we are looking for. As @spiritsoul1977 says ""youtube the trailer first""."
,HDfreak,2011-08-18T12:19Z,thanks ! :)
,tymac9889,2011-08-20T04:26Z,"LOL fake American movies? I its not a live footage of the actual event then wouldn't all movies be ""Fake""? Last time I checked people in the UK eat hamburgers too..... but the fact is there are stupid people everywhere, oh and remember what happened about 200 years ago??? People from UK sailed to America so other than our governemt the teaching and knowledge is all the same... the persons ability to retain is another matter."
,snilloc,2011-08-22T09:18Z,"@ cookesrc......

""I'm eating a burger right now, picturing myself having rough sex with your queen.""

,Libava,2011-08-27T06:08Z,"Dudes, worldwide movie watching experience tells me most of British movies are different from Holli-woody ones... Humor is often sarcastic & witty which by definition characterizes more educated people rather that troglodytes & coach potatoes ;~)
... therefore I'm going to download it and will express my final marks after all ... Cheerios!="
,buleaaah,2011-09-05T13:01Z,"I don't care where the movie come from i just care the plot, and i love british movie their movie kinda natural.
@ cookesrc 
fu*k your own grandma"
,skiordie188,2011-11-23T06:12Z,"Well, this commenting has become so festive that I decided I must partake.  Remember when Americans spread democracy all over the world?  And when Hitler was planning on taking over the world America came to the UK's aid?  Remember in 2010 when the US put 698 billion dollars into their military and the UK put 57 billion?  Remember Steve Jobs and Bill Gates (both Americans), the guys who gave us the ability to comment on websites? HOWEVER, Emma Watson is from the UK so in the end I would say that America and UK are essentially parallels"
,Libava,2012-01-03T21:10Z,"... finally got back here... watched the Movie & I liked it... it's different... and yes, has that sarcastic British humor... it's somewhat sad & sweet ... it refines your ability to Feel those things that define a Human being... ya know ;~)

=Happy New Year to all & G*d Bless!="
