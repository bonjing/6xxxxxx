Plot
When he learns that his mother is on the verge of deserting his father for a
dance instructor, young Welsh teen Oliver (Craig Roberts) resolves to do whatever
it takes to save his parents' marriage before the end of summer. Meanwhile, the
offbeat lad also schemes to seduce pushy pyromaniac Jordana (Yasmin Paige) with
nothing but the power of his mind. Richard Ayoade directs this quirky coming-of-age
comedy based on a novel by Joe Dunthorne.

A comedy that doesn't let principles stand in the way of progress.
