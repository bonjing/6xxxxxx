[T],n2kmaster,2011-08-08T21:15Z,"cuz i webripped these and that was all that was there, if its such a problem, then don't download. Love it when a so called ""submitter"" with 2 versions of coolio gangsta paradise, miz theme song(not even remixed, should look up my version of the miz's song) and a single track from WWE the music vol 8, bitch about incomplete torrents, at least mine was labeled as such. 4 torrents and i'm supposed to care about your opinion? I'll care when you upload like 208 torrents like i have...."
[T],n2kmaster,2011-08-09T17:24Z,"Everytime i throw up a torrent theres some pud like him bitching about something even tho its completely free. That wasnt a question, it was an insult. If it was complete i wouldve posted it was a complete torrent. Not my fault 1/2 the idiots on here wont seed and cant read a description"
