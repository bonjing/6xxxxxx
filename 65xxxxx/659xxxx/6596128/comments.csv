,eioous,2011-08-12T18:07Z,Can I get some Instruction on how to burn this to DVD. Its my first time downloading this type of file. Thanks
,joluboga,2011-08-12T22:33Z,"I just made a tutorial with pictures for you, but it seems that piratebay doesn't let me post the link =("
,bboy307,2011-08-13T02:16Z,Can u make this without rar files please.
,joluboga,2011-08-13T07:02Z,There are no rar files in this torrent. These are DVD Files.
,bboy307,2011-08-13T08:19Z,K thanks
,joluboga,2011-08-13T15:51Z,"If someone needs a nice tutorial with pictures, on how to burn these files to DVD and watch them on your TV, just send me an e-mail to joluboga@hotmail.com"
,jljar5,2011-08-18T07:25Z,"I don't think you have seeders anymore, I'm getting around 5-10 kb/s all day  :(  If it ever downloads the whole 24 gig at that rate I will definitely seed!"
,joluboga,2011-08-20T03:29Z,"There are hundreds of seeders as we speak. The slow speed is because there are also hundreds of leechers trying to download.

But don't worry, you'll download the whole thing eventually =)"
,MidniteHoney,2011-08-21T16:30Z,"Please seed. Even I do seed, it says that it would take more than 2 years to download. It sucks. :("
,joluboga,2011-08-21T18:46Z,"@Agentbay: thank you for your kind words, although the original uploader is TheVideoMaster, from Demonoid =)

@MidniteHoney: just like Agentbay already explained in its post, this isn't a case of seeders not doing their job, the slow speeds are because there's A LOT of people downloading from those seeders and there's not enough bandwith for everybody.

I can assure you that you'll get the DVDs eventually, just leave the torrent open and please, keep seeding what you've already downloaded."
,kateyaya,2011-08-26T17:27Z,"thank you joluboga. for those that are wondering how to burn to dvd. its pretty easy. i dled nero(the trial) for all except for exhilarate and concert go to nero smartstart, click on red button, and go to nero express add the folder and burn, and i believe for exhilarate and concert use nero recode and burn onto the dvdr "

,MIABABY24,2011-10-04T05:10Z,"OMG!!! Thank you so much This is freakin awesome. I dounloaded just the activate dvd to see how it would work it was perfect. It has the menu options as well. So now im downloading all the rest. For the program guide i went on ebay and bought the program guide it cost $5, and that includes shipping, and It was in my mailbox in a couple days. So now I have the program guide. I figured since Joluboga was a saint and shared these dvd's with me
 I can spend $5 on a program guide. THANX!!!"
,dragon934,2011-10-16T19:39Z,"I unzipped this but couldn't find the Zumba Sticks anywhere. Did I do something wrong?

Seriously though thanks for a great upload"
,newby7,2011-10-20T19:41Z,Isn't the problem that most of the seeders have their computers off? that's why it's downloading at 5 kb/s. It' been days and I've got about 70% finally. Will definitely seed! Thanks!
,AmericanSceneQueen,2011-11-04T22:23Z,Could anybody tell me how to burn these to a DVD and have it work? I cant even open them in my computer and when I burned the files to a DVDR It wouldn't play in any player I tried:( It would be nice some quick written instructions..

,nicole06,2012-01-19T22:23Z,This didn't work for me at all... maybe because I have yet to figure out how to burn it to DVD & have it actually play. I have a Macbook Pro & the solution provided didn't work at all for me... tried the DVD Shrink as well :(
,boom7877,2012-01-24T11:39Z,I dont understand why you would put your email address on here to provide help and never reply to the emails!!!!!!
,pirateb87,2012-02-10T05:00Z,Use vlc media player go to file and select open folder etc or to burn it use convert to x and select an already converted project etc
,Zacke91,2012-02-15T01:25Z,"Guys, am I the only one that doesnt have any sound when I play the Video_TS files???

,israel24,2012-03-11T05:32Z,"THANK U JOLUBOFA, great torrent!  Perfect!  I'm a newbie and I got it!  Although, it did take time to DL, and discover how to burn correctly, but it was worth it!  Let me spare you the headache, so just follow these steps to burn on DVD w/ menu:  
1. DL this torrent (b patient).
2. DL AVS DVD Copy and follow there instructions ( http://www.gromkov.com/faq/faq2004-0026.html , thanks marig789).
Easy as that!  BTW, I have DivX, WinDVD creator, and Windows DVD maker and none could do what AVS DVD Copy did.  "

,ddelerium,2012-04-07T03:46Z,"You need a password to open this file. I think this is a scam because if you read the text, it leads you to a link where you are required to answer a survey, tons and tons of questions. There is no password provided. What is the password? Why won't anyone post it here? "
