Here is Heather Graham from the movie The Hangover. She is in a nice strapless little black dress and stiletto heels. She is promoting "Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer" on the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. Yes, I yanked your chain a bit. This is not about The Hangover. But late night talk shows are never about the crappy movies the stars are shilling. It's about high heels and satin.

Bonus points if you remember her as Annie in season 2 of Twin Peaks!
