,kedawa,2011-08-15T09:49Z,I had to change Audio Device to Mono and crank the volume in order to get proper sound.
,AndroidLove,2011-08-15T12:40Z,"Didn't know where else to post this but seeing that this is one of the most seeded and ONLY animated show on the first page of the list - what's happened to all the other animated shows? There was a time when sorting by seeds would show Family Guy, South Park, Simpsons, etc show up in the first page.
What other new animated shows are people watching and which ones are worth it?
All of a sudden looks like there's a dearth of animated content!! Please say it isn't so!!!"
