,aeuinz,2011-08-15T07:10Z,"Hi thx, it works great again! I say again, cause i had the previous version , 6 7 build 7 posted by you too. But... they proposed the update, i said yes, and then, the message ""wrong serial"" appeared and it was over... My question is, as it seems this software has often new updates, how to keep it update and well cracked like it is?? Cause i suppose, as it's exactly the same method, the same message will appear again at the next update... "

,lolfailnope,2011-08-17T06:10Z,"can someone get me like a prepatched exe or something? the patch always says ""Access Failed: Make sure Internet Download Manager (IDMan.exe) is NOT running!"", even when I run it as admin."
,lolfailnope,2011-08-17T06:19Z,"nvm... found a different patch. weird, these patches have always worked before."
,lolfailnope,2011-08-17T06:26Z,"actually, nvm again. that patch doesn't work either. this patch acutally worked once, and when it did, it got me the same alert im getting now. it can't open the internet socket. my firewall isnt blocking it. HELP 
I LOVE THIS DOWNLOAD MANAGER!!!"
,lolfailnope,2011-08-17T06:37Z,"nvm AGAIN. Sorry, i got it to work now. "
