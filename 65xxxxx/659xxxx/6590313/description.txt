Robert Johnson meets the devil down at the crossroads, Muddy Waters meets Little Walter on a street corner in Chicago; the Blues is lousy with chance meetings that have led to greatness. Not so with Mikey Jr. and Matt Daniels who met while auditioning for So You Think You Can Dance. After many lengthy and sometimes heated discussions during the Lambada phase they finally decided to start a duet when they discovered that they both had a â€œlikingâ€ for the smell of bacon. Now, by day, they can be found in orange jumpsuits performing their court appointed public service along the highways of the Philadelphia region and, by night, in every smoky dive that will have them. Mikey and Matt, a legend that will last a lunchtime!
