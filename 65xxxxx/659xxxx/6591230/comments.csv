[T],n2kmaster,2011-08-09T15:39Z,"Thanks, found these on a MU forum posting, had all 5 seasons there, i converted them to mp4 one to make it a smaller download, and 2 if someone wants to put them up on a website they are already in a streaming format for fast watching. I was a fan of this spiderman myself, never liked any the newer ones either since this one and i remember actually following the storylines in this. Yes this is one the Madam Web, has the Carnage/Venom story and everything. Best variation cartoon i thought ever of spiderman"
