You made the mistake of making your first post at the forum a reference to a direct download site.. if you were a veteran member filling a request that would have been allowed but SuprBay is the support forum for a bittorrent site (TPB), not a direct download site. They get ""Spammers"" doing the same thing every day.
Luckily I happened to grab the url's before they deleted your post... enjoy  =)"
