,Jaw5,2011-09-30T06:09Z,Maybe you whiners should learn to read error messages. Output folders have character limits. This torrent extracts just fine.

works just fine"

,ronniebt,2011-10-11T04:19Z,its asking me for a serial number or the free trial! what should i do? pleasee helpp
,FaythsDenyle,2011-10-12T00:23Z,For those who are having trouble extracting the .rar files. You need to change the name of the main folder to something like Sony Vegas 11 or something similar. The name of the main file is what is preventing the extracting of the .rar files. Then you have to select all and then extract.
,FaythsDenyle,2011-10-12T00:24Z,Great torrent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,NLC713,2011-10-17T13:12Z,Worked Great! Many Thanks webchella!

,d0000h,2011-11-25T04:50Z,"Note: (I'm using Win7) I installed crack and it asked for serial when I ran the program, so I installed crack again, this time using a right click and ""Run as Administrator"". Then it worked."
,alexsgocart,2011-11-30T03:35Z,"Works Perfect! Installed and Patched in under 5 minutes and fired right up with no issues. Excellent Download. Only question I have is, is this safe to update?"
,firestrike3000,2011-12-09T03:41Z,Help. Im having the same problem with the .rar files. When extracting it says that there is a missing file even though i selected all of the files...
,SeanMandrake,2011-12-27T15:40Z,"Works A1 (DVD studio not tested). Patcher is poorly made and detects as hacktool etc but it's safe and left nothing on my system (Malwarebytes, Adaware system scan after install was clean.)

In use patcher has to be shown where the install directory is and wants to patch 3 files. The first is for the Movie studio, the second the DVD studio and the third for the audio suite (not in this download). Skip the ones that are not installed."
,rocker101,2012-06-03T21:47Z,what is the dam serial number ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
,moarhats,2012-06-09T01:20Z,Works perfectly. Just run the file as admin and follow the instructions! THANK YOU!
