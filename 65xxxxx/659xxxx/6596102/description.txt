You're no idiot, of course. You host the most fabulous dinner parties and select just the right wines. But when it comes time to play some bridge, you feel like hiding away in the kitchen. Don't spend the evening washing dishes! This book will help you learn the rules of the game in friendly, easy-to-swallow bites. You'll learn how to deal and play a "rubber"(that's bridge-talk for a game), how to keep score, and even how to deal with less-than perfect partners! In this Complete Idiot's Guide
