,Bakum,2011-08-10T01:30Z,"Hey, thanks for the upload bro, think you could explain how to replace the old terraria with this one without deleting the worlds or the characters? thanks in advance."
,miguelsz3,2011-08-10T01:37Z,"@Bakum 

Your worlds/characters are kept in a different place from where you have your game installed. You can just replace the contents of your terraria folder with the 1.0.6 ones.

By defualt my worlds/characters are kept in

Documents\My Games\Terraria"
,rando606,2011-08-10T01:41Z,"@Bakum simply copy all your charecter and world files into a new folder, install the new version, put them back in the player and worlds folder."

,miguelsz3,2011-08-12T00:02Z,"@b_almeida

Its probably a terraria issue... Anywho can you tell me if you get any error? It'd be incredibly useful."
,hagamablabla,2011-08-13T06:14Z,I know this isn't due to the torrent (because it works) but my Terraria is lagging terribly. Is it possibly because I edited the health to 100000?
,miguelsz3,2011-08-13T09:30Z,Hrmmm... Possibly. Of course im not much of a modder so the inner workings of terraria is unknown to me... You can try to run it at a higher priority in task manager?
,Bakum,2011-08-17T21:53Z,Think you can upload 1.0.6.1? Thanks for the upload!
,miguelsz3,2011-08-17T23:40Z,Im uploading it now.
