,GAMETIME72,2011-09-07T15:34Z,"just wanted to add to 1st comment that this program not only does not have the desire to phone home and installs with the default to never update so no need to block and very noob friendly (although blocked and killed update out of habbit and experience, lol) it is absolutely the FULLL version does darn near as much as cs5.5 with the right click menu on top of the upper menus ....THNX AGAIN CHECKOUTER will be dumping o'slow adobe and to e1 using vlc try this (just my opinion but best audio/video player app ) http://thepiratebay.org/search/media%20center%2016/0/99/300"
[T],CheckOutEr,2011-09-07T16:48Z,"@ GAMETIME72

Thanks, mate! In my opinion the best media player is Daum PotPlayer, it's kmplayer author's new project that is same as kmplayer, but it's kept up to date, the only problem: it's in korean language, so just Google to find english versions of it. Offical website:

And yes, that's 4 you:

Enjoy! :P"

[T],CheckOutEr,2011-10-10T17:18Z,"Hi, GAMETIME72

I have currently installed Daum Potplayer 32bit on my PC, so 32bit of it is existing. I can suggest you Revo Uninstaller or Total Uninstaller to Safely Remove all kind of programs. After the programs uninstaller has finished these programs are scanning for leftover files, folders & registry items & deleting them if you agree to do that.


Best regards, CheckOutEr"
