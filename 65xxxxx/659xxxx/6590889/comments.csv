,thefan23,2011-08-10T05:02Z,Quality sure looks good on this! No pixelations that i saw.
,makoy32000,2011-08-10T10:25Z,Great quality! Hope you can upload Thor!
,panicattackuk,2011-08-12T14:09Z,"Thanks again Albert! Quality was great, audio a little quiet but nothing turning it up a few notches can't fix.
Sorry to start straight in with the requests, but any chance you could do the current seasons of Breaking Bad and/or Weeds for handheld? Addicted to both now, but can't encode em myself because computer is too slow"
