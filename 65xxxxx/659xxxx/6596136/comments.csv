,papettpb,2011-08-14T14:10Z,Done indeed! Just finished downloading. Thanks heaps - you are the BEST!!!
,papettpb,2011-08-15T12:11Z,"Hi Pukje, just a thought (although I am almost certain you know): by starting your titles with a bracket, e.g.: {repost ..., or [BBC..., your uploads do now show in a title search; that is to say: your Dalziel and Pascoe don't show when one searches for Dalziel and Pascoe. I think otherwise there would be many more seeders/leechers. (Hope you don't mind).  "
,papettpb,2011-08-16T10:05Z,"Hi Pukje, sorry to pester you. Could you please reseed/repost: ""[BBC21] ..."" and ""[BBC22] ... "". Seeders have all gone. Many Leechers hoping to finish. Thank you!!"

,papettpb,2011-08-20T05:38Z,"Hi Pukje, again I apologize - suddenly there were seeders again for [BBC21...] and [BBC22...] - all finished now and seeding. THANK YOU!!! "
