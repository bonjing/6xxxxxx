,jersson,2011-08-09T13:16Z,I thought Real Player was a freeware ?
,termi599,2011-08-09T13:17Z,"No man.... sorry just enjoy this one... realplayer really knows how to stop users frrom copying their new versions.. i have searched the whole web and the only thing close enough to the original is that 
:D"

,jersson,2011-08-09T14:07Z,Does it have a vers number or is it just Plus ?
,termi599,2011-08-09T14:37Z,just plus
,jersson,2011-08-10T15:44Z,Yeah it seems to work just fine although Real says it's an old vers when I uninstalled my previous Free Real Player vers. Maybee this one is better than the free vers ?
,Blondeheks,2011-08-13T09:26Z,"Hello termi599


I have RealPlayer sp now he's just gone up perfeckt. 
Was just one problem with all the cracks to be replaced because I have Windows 7 as a system. 
I was also a mistake to send real that I not done so. 
To be a question about logging in RealPlayer sp can do just to get the program legally. 
Would you like to inform me. 
It should translate everything I can barely speak english sorry.

It works. Although I was hoping it to be Realplayer Plus, nevermind it is still good."
,splitendz,2011-09-22T18:25Z,"Thanks for this, much appreciated.

It works. Although I was hoping it to be Realplayer Plus, as at first i didn't know there was a Realplayer (SP) Plus... nevermind it is still good."
,Mariachei,2011-10-30T22:30Z,"Wait I'm confused by all the comments. 
Is this the current version of RealPlayer Plus or just a copy of the Freeware version I can already download from there site?"
