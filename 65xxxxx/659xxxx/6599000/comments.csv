without question, my favorites here are Femme Fatale, King, Sneakyville, Fade, Only In the Night. These are the 1s i've on wax.

To me, Secession is one of those groups who has quality material throiughout their catalog...I adore 'Magician' era and then they kept going 'til the end of the eighties Great stuff. "
