80s bands that I believed deserved far more recognition. Anyhow I am re-posting this series for those who are new to TPB or missed them when they were first posted. If the mainstream music is all you know about the 80s, then get ready for a bit of revelation. Some highlights on this mix are Section 25\'s \"Looking from a Hilltop\", Ghost Dance\'s \"When I Call\" and the spooky and chilling \"Sneakyville\" by Secession which is about Charles Manson and theï»¿ Manson Family murders.
