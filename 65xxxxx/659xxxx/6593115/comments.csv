,RVDDP2501,2011-08-25T19:39Z,"A quick note to the uploader, the audio in Scream 2 slowly goes out of sync and from 01:38:17 to 01:38:22, the video stammers before returning to normal, is it possible to reupload a corrected version please?"
,vivatpb5776,2011-09-09T05:48Z,Only downloaded Scream 4. I was very impressed with the opening sequence. The audio and video quality are excellent. +1 for true 720p screen resolution. Thank you uploader.
,The-Blob,2011-10-05T03:15Z,"I agree with RVDDP2501, the video stutters at around 01:38:17 but for me the audio did not sync back up. So the last 30 minutes or so of the film was about 2-3 seconds out of sync. If you play it in VLC Media Player it is more noticeable to see the stutter.

I do not know about all the other videos as I have not yet watched them.

The resolution is really good, but the audio sync issue is annoying. But regardless, thank you to the original uploader for these films"
