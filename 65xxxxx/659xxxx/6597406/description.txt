Hi,

If you are interested in the History of Rock and Roll this is a useful document.

It is a kind of continuing Musical documentary (3 days) of the Rock and Roll history and sound awful. I tried to complete the document as good as possible (Info, labels and order) and fixed it where necessary. In short too much work to get lost on my PC only.

So, do not download this 4.5 GB for the music but for its historical value.
And if you do, please help seeding.
