if you do, can you please up the New england patriots for me, thanks"
[V],phatwarez,2011-08-11T18:42Z,Probably not unless I have a reliable source.
[V],RR-NE,2011-08-11T18:57Z,"Well I would really appreciate if you would.

TYT keeps disabling my accounts :("
[V],phatwarez,2011-08-11T20:00Z,"Yup same, it's not worth the effort to keep an account there. Unless I find another source of consistent NFL games, I can only record what's locally shown.

We should make a thread in suprbay about this, TPB comments isn't an efficient way to discuss."
