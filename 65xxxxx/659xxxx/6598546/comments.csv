,clonies,2011-08-13T15:52Z,Her blog? What's special about it? Blogs are just a page with the writer's opinions. Who cares? But thanks for the game.
,justnzgrl23,2011-08-13T21:54Z,Always love downloading from Wendy...I know the files are safe and I wont be dealing with a crashed computer due to viruses...Thanks a bunch!
,MiriamX,2011-08-16T18:27Z,"@ clonies - her blog is not a blog as such - she has all the new games there. Not to speak of her forum, which unfortunately doesn't seem to accept any new members. She's got all the games."

Have uninstalled it and reinstalled. Got the same problem. Has anybody else had this problem because Wendy's games are generally spot on?"
