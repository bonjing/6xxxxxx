,patsy79,2011-08-12T20:26Z,"Another great torrent. 
Some people read to educate themselves and broaden their mind. Others believe they know it all and just spew vitriol and hatred. Eventually these people usually get over their sexual and psychological problems and become really nice people :)"
,patsy79,2011-08-13T00:30Z,"moman73 made a torrent available to download. Either download or don't. Simple.
Of course your 'religion' would never be involved with abuse of young, unprotected and vulnerable human beings? "
,hijaz79,2011-08-13T12:00Z,"This series about ""criticism of the Bible"" included more than 260 titles. Almost all of it were writtem by Western (non-Muslim) writers.

It seem that some who contribute their comments here do not bother to read any of these books. They have already made up their minds!"
,hijaz79,2011-08-13T12:14Z,"Rustgold:
Fanaticism exists in all religions. But, based on the actions of few fanatics, you cannot generalize and assert that a particular religion supports the actions of these fanatics.

The issue of this series is the corruptions and forgeries in the Bible. It seems that you are unable to respond to the huge evidence collected by biblical research (done by Westerners) and you are trying to divert our attentiion to other issues.

,ramikaz,2011-08-13T12:28Z,Rustgold is a hateful fanatic and has demonstrated his stupidity and hate OVER and OVER.  That imbecile is to be ignored.
,patsy79,2011-08-13T18:00Z,"Quote Rustgold : ""I'm not religious""
I myself am an Atheist although as an unthinking child was inculcated with Christianity and would certainly never say something like, and I quote ""Christianity has many faults, but at least we don't see them...."" blah blah blah.
In a very short paragraph you deny religion and then attach yourself to Christianity. Why don't you just be honest? It's obvious where you are coming from. Your form of fundamentalism is just as hateful as any other. Why don't you open your mind as much as your mouth?"

Your use of the word ''garbage'' to describe Quran reflects a disturbed personality and a stinking soul.

Let me tell what is garbage.

garbage is:
to claim that God sanctioned in war the killing of women, infants, sucklings, animals. [1 Samuel 15:2-3]

to claim that God will punish the children to the third and forth generation for the sins of their parents. [Exodus 20:5]

to claim that God got tired and needed rest. [Exodus 31:17]

to claim that God discriminates against the handicapped. [Leviticus 21:18-21, 23]

to claim that God has prejudice against the illegitimately born and their descendants to the tenth generation. [Deut. 23:2]

The story that Prophet Noah planted a vineyard, made wine, and got falling-down drunk. And then cursed his youngest son, Ham, because he looked at his nakedness, proclaiming that Hamâ€™s descendants (the Canaanites) will be slaves to his brothersâ€™ descendants. [Genesis 11]

The story that Prophet Lot's two daughters had sex with their father while he was drunk, got pregnant, and gave birth to sons: Moab, who becomes the patriarch of the Moabites; and Ben- Ammi, the patriarch of the Ammonites. [Genesis 19]

The story that Prophet Jacob, with the help of his mother, ripped off his older twin, Esau, and tricked his father Isaac to give him the blessing instead of to his brother. [Genesis 27]

The story that Prophet David committed adultery with Bathsheba, impregnated her, and conspired to get her husband, Uriah, to be killed in a battle so that he can marry the woman. [2 Samuel 11]

And the story of Amnon, Absalom, and Tamar, the two sons and daughter of David, and the stories of Dinah, Reuben, Onan, ..etc, etc, etc.

,noor21424,2011-08-15T10:28Z,"There is no way you can put the Quran in same group with the Bible.
Biblical scholars have written hundreds of books and research papers to show corruptions and forgeries in the Bible. You need only to read some of the books in this series of uploads. The Quran is clean from all these corruptions.

Those who attack the Quran are dirven by bias and prejiduce and the propaganda against Islam. They never bother themselves to read the Quran.
