Ok guys and gals, this is my first torrent, got tired of being a perpetual leecher, so here's my first contribution. All of these compressed files are freely available from the GPO's site, individually...I've personally downloaded each of them, and compiled them into a folder...hope this works...please, any and all feedback welcome and appreciated! 

I'm a bit of a legal freak, always looking up shit for my own and others purposes, I got tired of waiting on cornell's and duke's and other university sites, and the GPO's database is a pain in the ass to search...so I downloaded all of these for my own uses, and now, I'm sharing the collection with you all! Hope someone finds it helpful/useful! If this one works, I'll seed it until the code changes or gets added onto, then I'll remake the file... Once I know I 'know' what I'm doing, and can figure out how to add trackers from other sites and whatnot, I'll begin to share more of my collection with you all! PLEASE LEAVE ME SOME FEEDBACK! FIRST TORRENT! Thanks all!
