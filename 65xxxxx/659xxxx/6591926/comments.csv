Dr. Jonathan Seward (Alberto Dalbes) notices the bite marks on the neck of a pretty young victim (Anne Libert), realizing that itâ€™s the work of the undead Count Dracula (Howard Vernon). Seward visits Castle Dracula, drives a stake in the vampire's sleeping heart, and he perishes as a dried up bat lanced by a pin. Soon after, Dr. Frankenstein (Dennis Price) and his aptly named hunchback assistant Morpho (Luis Barboo) come to town and revive the Frankenstein Monster (Fernando Bilbao) in Draculaâ€™s castle. The Monster is then let loose to kidnap a cabaret singer (Josyane Gibert) so Frankenstein can utilize her blood to revive Drac (a real bat is bathed in a glass jar of bubbling red stuff). Under Frankensteinâ€™s control, Dracula puts the bite on a few more victims in what is the mad doctorâ€™s ultimate plan to create an army of otherworld beings that will be at his beckoning call.
