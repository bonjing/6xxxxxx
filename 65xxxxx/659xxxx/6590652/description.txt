Hej,

It was impossible to find a working level 1-3 swedish Rosetta Stone for Mac so I went and bought an actual pirated copy. <3 China. My girlfriend is using the program (installed using the files in this torrent) right now, so it definitely works.


Just follow these very simple instructions if you're unsure how to install it:
1. First double-click and install this Rosetta Stone Version 3.4.5 Mac

2. Double-click and run the three .dcr-files so that it looks like you have three CDs inserted into your computer

3. Copy or move the mdm.dat from the Crack folder to
/Applications/Rosetta Stone Version 3.app/Contents/Resources, overwriting
the existing file.
(You can do this in the Finder by right- or option-clicking on the Rosetta
Stone Version 3 application and selecting Open Package Contents, and
going to the Contents and then the Resources folder.)


Enjoy!
Sven
