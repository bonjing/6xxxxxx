                           DESCRiPTiON 

 The series sees different company executivesgoing undercover in their own     
 businesses to ensure that their companies are fighting fit.                   
                                                                               
 Poundworld director Martyn Birks becomes a member of the shop-floor staff at 
 one of his own discount stores. The Wakefield-founded retail chain went through
 a period of expansion during the credit crunch, as cash-strapped customers
 flocked to branches in an effort to save money. However, the popularity surge
 left many employees overwhelmed, causing them to look for work elsewhere. Last
 in the series.
