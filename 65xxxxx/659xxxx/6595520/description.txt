Notes:   The sound quality is excellent ! It could had been an excellent CD 5 - 6 years ago but now hardly essential. 
I also find very strange the producer would mention on the back cover that " Night Rider " take 1 never said to exist until now since it was released in 1990 on the BMG three CD set "Collectors Gold" !
These outtakes are released on several releases...but definitive not in this quality ! 

With covers. Enjoy!
