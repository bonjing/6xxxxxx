,Bobby12364,2011-08-10T23:18Z,"Hi for me the game works, the only problem i have is that the game finds 'a critical error, and has to shut down'... This comes always after about half an hour of playing, when i restart the game it runs fine again for half an hour

Can someone help me??
Thx"

,TechnoGeekOfficial,2011-08-11T12:38Z,same problem as everyone else
,Bobby12364,2011-08-11T13:22Z,"I just copied the file from the dmg you doxnloaded in my application folder, i opened the program and it worked... I still run the latest version of snow leopard. 
Only have problems after playing for a half hour"
,yllop,2011-08-11T14:01Z,I'm running Lion on a 2.26ghz Macbook pro. Maybe it doesn't run in Lion but still has crashing problems in Snow Leopard. Pretty useless either way.
,Mr_L_,2011-08-11T19:50Z,"Ok because it doesn't work in Lion, I started looking around and found this:

I updated the game with newer engine or something, it starts but then it says program error. Anybody can help??"
,yllop,2011-08-11T21:28Z,Can't get it working with the link provided above. Not even sure what I'm doing. Get's very confusing on there step by step. Just deleting everything to do with this torrent as it seems the CXZ is redundant now and won't run on lion ever.

,BAAZMichel,2011-08-19T15:56Z,"Its the same as Euro truck simulator, you can play for a half hour, then you get a error. But you can play it for a half hour again, if you restart the game"
,readered,2011-08-21T00:12Z,"works fine with the cxz diamond from the torrent, up until you are nearing the end of your first delivery, then it crashes and an error message comes up on screen. The program then quits, uf you could get this fixed, the simulator would be excellent"
