Unless you're a Hayao Miyazaki or Takeshi Kitano fan, the name Joe Hisaishi is probably not very familiar to you. But since I first heard his work in 1996, I've called him my favourite film composer ever, over even visionaries like Thomas Newman, Joseph Koo, Randy Edelman, Ennio Morricone, Goblin, and Nino Rota.

Hisaishi's score for Laputa: Castle in the Sky is his best. Part of the magic of Hisaishi is that he draws from several rich wells of influence and blends them in his own unique way. His background in New Age music (which informed his score for Nausicaa: Warriors of the Wind) probably explains his impeccable craftsmanship, his sonic clarity, and his studio wizardry (he plays many if not all of the instruments on his works). On the other hand, he also has a classical composer's sophistication, a superb pop producer's ear for arrangement (not just the tired strings-and-symphonic-percussion of most Hollywood scores), and an ace songwriter's talent for coming up with hooks; his compositions are as catchy as any radio hit you can think of. Add that to his awareness of Japanese music both past and present, a flavour unlike any other, and you have an absolutely brilliant mix.
