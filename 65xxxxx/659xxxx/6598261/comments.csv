turbine84, your source
( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5340858/ )
shows English subs. But above, the Texted language(s) shows German. Is this an error?"
,turbine84,2011-08-12T20:00Z,"Guys, you are going to have to excuse me. I thought I embedded the torrents in the MKV but i didnt. Damn! As i also understand french I payed no attention.
The subtitles from 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5340858/ should do perfectly. Just download this file and the subtitles file from the other torrent. Then rename the SRT file to match the name of this video file. 
That should do the trick.

And now i dont know what language the subtitles were originally in.... dammit!

Well, we learn from mistakes."
,turbine84,2011-08-13T02:07Z,"Now i know why i thought that the subtitles were in german. When the name of a place is displayed it comes up in german. You will understand when you watch the movie.

It went better than expected. Torrent completely seeded. 

Audio = French
Video = HD
Subtitles = download subtitles from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5340858/ 
Just the .srt file."
