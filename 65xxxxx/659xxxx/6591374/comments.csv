,whitachen,2011-08-29T02:56Z,"Hi, I've tried copy and paste the modified dll file to Dvdfab 8QT folder as you instructed. But it doesn't seem to work, still says that I am a trial user. Any idea? Same thing happened when I tried with recent earlier versions. patch didn't seem to work. Please advise. Thank you!"
[V],Slickinator,2011-09-01T18:15Z,you have too make sure you have the program totally off and then copy and paste and or use patch try running the patch in the main directory also... and if something comes up also say allow for changes ...also see if disabling your antivirus temporarly helps also it may be blocking part of it
