Very important! First go to ""menu""- ""settings""- ""applications"" and then select ""Unknown sources""

Then copy .apk file from pc to phone using usb cable and go to ""menu"", ""application (folder)"". The phone will scan for any .apk files. Once the search is complete u will see all files there. Select what u want to install and u r done."
