STOP THE B.S. !!"
,Bak4mHell,2011-10-21T13:02Z,"@nutella59 :- you zionist puppet, Jerusalem is mentioned several times in Quran and Ahadiths. Go check it out. In Qur'aan, Jerusalem is not mentioned by the name Jerusalem but rather mentioned as ""holy land"", But in Hadiths , its mentioned by both names."
