If you are developing applications for the Mac, or are hoping to do so, this book is just the resource you need.
Does it cover everything you will ever want to know about programming for the Mac? Of course it doesn't.
But it does cover probably 80% of what you need to know. You can find the remaining 20%, the 20% that is
unique to you, in Apple's online documentation.
This book, then, acts as a foundation. It covers the Objective-C language and the major design patterns of
Cocoa. It will also get you started with the three most commonly used developer tools: Xcode, Interface
Builder, and Instruments. After reading this book, you will be able to understand and utilize Apple's online
documentation.
There is a lot of code in this book. Through that code, I will introduce you to the idioms of the Cocoa
community. My hope is that by presenting exemplary code, I can help you to become not just a Cocoa
developer, but a stylish Cocoa developer.
This third edition includes technologies introduced in Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5. These include Xcode 3,
Objective-C 2, Core Data, the garbage collector, and CoreAnimation.
