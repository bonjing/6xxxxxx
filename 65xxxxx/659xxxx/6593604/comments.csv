,bswordpb,2011-08-09T23:13Z,Thanks :)
,Protoz,2011-08-09T23:18Z,Can someone run this through that site that uses multiple virus scans.
,starfire20,2011-08-09T23:19Z,"virus alert, kaspersky erased the terraria exe as soon as it dled all the way
trojan.win32.chifrax.a"
,Thunder1909,2011-08-09T23:30Z,"Downloaded in 2 seconds, installed in 1. Works perfectly, thanks!"
,Thunder1909,2011-08-09T23:32Z,"And FFS for all the idiots who are using AVG or another crappy antivirus software, stop using this website get out. There is no virus. "
[T],alexisthebest,2011-08-09T23:38Z,"All of THETA's releases come up as false positives.
They're clean."
,scyris99,2011-08-10T01:19Z,"Whats coming up as a virus is the packager Theta uses, its a false positive, the AV's that report it as a virus usually are trying to stop piracy by tricking people into thinking files like this are a threat. I've never gotten a Virus from a Theta release. Plus I doubt someone with a Skull on TPB would upload virus filled files, would be a one way ticket to losing said skull and getting a ban most likely. Avast is a fairly good AV, and it doesn't detect it as a virus. Besides most big name Anti-virus programs make up false positives at random just so that you think its doing something. I wouldn't say it'd be too much fo a stretch to say that the AV companies themselves release half the viruses out there."

You whom speak the Truth shall by now be my god. Amen"
,FernFrond,2011-08-10T04:58Z,THANKS! Been looking forward to this update for a while! Works fine
,lostlegends,2011-08-10T23:07Z,"Thanks, clean and works fine, didnt need .net framework but did need XNA framework. Personaly I think its just a cheap minecraft ripoff and comepletly boring, but still appreciate the upload."
,matelian,2011-08-11T01:50Z,"never had a virus in THETA releases before (Limbo, Super Meat Boy), but it sad to say this one is a first.

Trojan.ADH"
[T],alexisthebest,2011-08-11T04:17Z,"@matelian
Last time i checked, false positives dont count as viruses. So it's still not a first.

And most of the Super Meat Boy releases are uploaded by me, and they were all false positives. So you cant say you've never had this issue with THETA releases."
,miniman5454,2011-08-12T05:48Z,@ scyris99 i couldnt agree with you more
,eman12100,2011-08-13T02:48Z,"Okay so. . . I put it into Utorrent it said it removed a trojan so i was like, ""cool story bra"", then, when i went to download this, it won't do anything."
,VigossXP,2011-08-13T14:11Z,^install .NET framework and XNA bro 
,Aidanferg97,2011-08-15T23:51Z,"mine just says problem encountered send error report?
 what shall i do? "
,ez100,2011-08-16T08:28Z,can this be played in multi player? if so how?
,FernFrond,2011-08-17T06:35Z,"@ez100, yes you can with hamachi. You can Dl hamachi from this site too. FInd out the server hosts IP and connect to it. First you have to join their hamachi server using their username and pass to connect to their hamachi server. Then both of u have to keep hamachi running and just join. Make sure both of you have firewall turned off and most recent versions of hamachi. You can go to a menu in it to check for latest version. If one of you has firewall or non-updated version, then it won't work. I think you can play with regular servers too"
,genericusername01,2011-08-17T22:00Z,"So this torrent downloaded and installed no problemo, and i ignored avg's attempts to tell me it was a virus. But i click the terraria.exe file and... nothing happens. I already have the latest .net framework, i even re-downloaded and repaired it. I tried running it as an administrator, changing the compatibility settings, nothing. I kept the task manager open, and no new processes came up when i tried to run it. What the heck? ):"
,GKill,2011-08-27T05:02Z,"haven't used torrents in awhile, do i need steam to run this?"
,Inconspicularity,2011-09-02T14:54Z,Where can I find the download for the non-dev XNA?
,Yogi4sasuke,2012-04-06T09:18Z,hey im using magic iso maker and i cant seem to get this to work..any suggestions?
