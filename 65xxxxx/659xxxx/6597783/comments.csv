I don't know if you will read this.
First I'd like to thank you for all your rips, it's great music you have there.
I'd like to do some myself and have a few questions about the whole FLAC processing.
I don't know any way to send private messages here so maybe you can write me : laptopcats@gmail.com

Thanks,
Miko "
