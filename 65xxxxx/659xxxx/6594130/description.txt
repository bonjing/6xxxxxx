                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Hugh's Fish Fight sees Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall finding out more about the 
 world's diminishing fish stocks and he attempts to understand what is         
 happening to the British fishing industry.                                    
                                                                               
 Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall presents an update on his campaign to change      
 commercial fishing laws in a bid to reduce the amount of fish discarded in the
 seas. He details the Government's study into a possible ban on fishermen      
 throwing back dead fish when they have reached their EU quota, and discusses  
 the European Commission's proposals for a new policy. He also highlights the  
 pressure generated across Europe for better fishing practices, and the        
 response by major brands and retailers to change their methods of acquiring   
 tuna.                                                                         
                                 Enjoy!
