Information
------------------------------

Every summer in Scotland, the sound of bagpipes along with the pounding of drums signify the gathering of the clans to participate in the Highland Games. In Lonach, there is the "March of the Clansmen" where men and women in full highland dress parade through the countryside. The quaint town of Braemar hosts the Queen of England and the 'heavies'. These are the men who toss the Caber, hurl the hammer and throw the stone put while wearing the traditional kilt. Grand historical castles, the northern town of Cullen, a whiskey distillery and the culinary delights of Edinburgh complete this program about the Scottish pride.
