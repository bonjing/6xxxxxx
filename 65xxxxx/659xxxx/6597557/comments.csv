,kotaroizumaki,2011-09-01T08:31Z,"ajay1992,
all keygens have that trojan false positive. when you need to use it is temperarily disable your antivirus and run the keygen as administrator, then once you installed it you can scan your computer."
,richardallen,2011-09-16T16:43Z,The activator supplied with this is for System Mechanic 8 and doesn't work with System Mechanic 10.

,Nocturnalis,2011-10-16T16:19Z,The Assistant file contains the Obfuscator.xx trojan. That is NOT a goddamned FALSE POSITIVE.
,iamokaw,2011-10-24T17:21Z,"I've been doing this since the 90's, I know as well as anyone that keygens and cracks tend to flag with false positives. It's just part of the game But 34/43 on VT, multiple reports of obfuscator (a rather nasty trojan), and VT community comments saying it infected their system seems like more than a false positive."

,glassware,2012-02-13T11:40Z,"im having trouble with the activator it says ""couldnt access windows registry"" any suggestions?"
,DKetch88,2012-02-23T04:44Z,"if having trouble with the activator saying ""couldnt access windows registry"" You need to Right Click on the Activator file and run it as the Adminastrator. make sure you have the file extracted frist.
