├óΓé¼┼ôWhat Prison Will Teach You About Getting Too Good With Women... And How To Avoid The Hidden Traps├óΓé¼┬¥

After doing a stretch in "the clink" ... I learned a valuable lesson the hard way -- being the jerk who gets all the women just isn't worth all the trouble!

Let me clear something up right now...

I'm not what you'd call a "career criminal." I'm just an average guy who had the misfortune of meeting the wrong woman. My situation could happen to any man. Even you. I'll elaborate on this as we go...

I'll be honest with you: I was an unrepentant womanizer at one point in my life. And for that, I paid a price that could have been avoided if I'd only known then what I know now.

They say that when you go to prison, it's hard to find anyone inside who isn't innocent. It's kind of funny, actually. Some people can never admit they're guilty... even if they were caught red-handed!

Nevertheless, I won't say I didn't play my part in the whole fiasco.

I did 2 years in prison that could have been avoided if I'd known there are certain women who are self-destructive and hell-bent on taking down as many victims with them as they can.

And there are also women who seem somewhat normal one minute... then turn into spiteful, revenge-filled beasts who want to make you pay for every sin every guy before you did to them.

To add insult to injury, the laws are so stacked in their favor that once an accusation is made, the system takes over... and she can't even reverse her position if she has a change of heart.
