,snogroove,2011-08-31T20:08Z,It's just an excerpt with sales pitch. Avoid til real copy available.
,waxlrose,2011-09-03T22:22Z,It's not a sales pitch... this is the real book. You must not be able to read.
,snogroove,2011-09-09T12:45Z,"Hi SHILL! Funny, the people who've published my articles in peer-reviewed journals seem to think I can read. 

To those about to waste their time downloading an admittedly interesting SALES PITCH, look at the size: 383K? 

And it's a BOOK? "
,flipflops,2012-01-09T02:32Z,"so in this 41 page document, it says the number one SCREAMING RED FLAG for coming disaster with a woman is on page 120...if this is the full book, waxlrose, where is page 120? Did you even look at this or are you working for the writer?"
,waxlrose,2012-03-06T01:03Z,"Shill? What is this? A debate about vaccines? Anyways, everyone knows that the whole ""peer reviewed"" thing is a scam."
