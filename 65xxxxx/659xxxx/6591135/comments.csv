There was one trial mission where wind direction fuked up your fridge launchers and you had such limited ammo to get rid of citadel. Then there was the one where you had to shoot bazooka forwards and have it richocet off the water and hit an island(Maybe this was worms 3d) and another mission where you had to girder up all your weakest links and destroy and entire city of teams inside, which was so dam hard"
