,dlectro,2011-08-15T21:24Z,What's the point in posting low resolution screenshots? How am i supposed to see the quality from those?

I upload to about 15 diff. sites and some don't handle thumbs and some don't do the full image at 1920. so i had to make an in-between. no one should ever judge a moving image from a still pic anyways. try downloading just the sample that's way we put them in there. "

not 1080 ??"

we crop out the Black Bars on top and bottom. so that all the encoding is done on the picture and not wasted on the bars."
