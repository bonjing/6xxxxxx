A 19-year-old girl prepares to become a suicide bomber in Times Square. She speaks with a nondescript American accent, and it\\\'s impossible to pinpoint her ethnicity. We never learn why she made her decision -- she has made it already. We don\\\'t know whom she represents, what she believes in - we only know she believes it absolutely.
