,thedertyone,2011-10-01T17:48Z,@hitnrun4fun what the fuck were you doing here?? You were obviously looking for a free way to get the cd! You wanna hate for seeding and yet I bet you still downloaded it..quit dick riding 
,hitnrun4fun,2011-10-06T02:11Z,"hmmm i bet they dont call you the dirtyone for nuthin huh? prefer the mud road to the pink one ill bet

i was looking for some of mad's indepent releases that were free, and yes i bought this cd on itunes for a whopping $5.99. almost broke the bank with that one. ive bought ever CD since Bad Dreams because Swollen is independent and produces their own stuff. you are literally stealing from mad, prev, and rob. `love signing burned cd`s at autograph sessions`what do you think he was talking about in Heavy Thinkers"
,jesse2825,2011-10-12T00:57Z,"If you knew anything about these guys, you would know that they really could give a shit less whether or not you illegally download or legitimately pay for their shit.  Believe me.  Madchild himself said this.  So I suggest you take the fuckin huge object stuck in your ass and remove it carefully or else you might die from horrible causes prematurely.  Idiot.  "
,kevin_wolf,2012-03-28T06:07Z,"truly mad child doesnt give a fuck no more, but rob and them still do, mad child pretty much left the group. yeah i do know a bit cause i got homies who keep me posted on them, plus i get there (swollen members) music for free too"
