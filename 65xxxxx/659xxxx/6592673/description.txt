In 90 minutes of madness, 32-year-old Anders Behring Breivik killed 69 young people.

The film pieces together Breivikâ€™s day of terror hour by hour, from the time of the bomb he set off in Oslo, to the cold blooded shooting of defenceless youngsters on the remote island beauty spot of UtÃ¸ya.

Who is this man, and what made him act?

This film examines the criminal mind and motives of one of the worldâ€™s worst killers, offering psychological analysis, as the day of the massacre unfolds.

We examine his motives, analyse his likely psychological journey through the planning stages and over the course of the day itself and ask what drove him to plan and carry out this massacre. Was he a terrorist as he claimed, a madman, or was he indeed both?

The film will have first-hand accounts from eyewitnesses and survivors who have not spoken on camera before. Including:

- taxi driver Arild Tangen who was the last man to speak to Breivik before his attack;

- survivor Adrian Pracon who was shot in the shoulder and tried to swim away from the island. He pleaded with Breivik to spare him;

- BjÃ¸rn Kasper Ilaug who rescued some of the kids whilst the shooting was happening by pulling bodies on to his boat;

- and Brede Joherraaten â€“ Camp owner, was there and recovered bodies and saved swimmers.

The killerâ€™s action are analysed by a host of experts, including: renowned criminologist Professor David Wilson; Katherine Newman from Princeton university who is one of worldâ€™s the top experts on spree shootings; Matthew Goodman, the leading authority on British and European right wing terror groups; and terror and weapons expert Charles Shoebridge.

And foremost, above all, is the memory of those who died. What were the warning signs? What could have been done? By investigating this appalling crime, there is the hope that an atrocity like this can never happen again.
