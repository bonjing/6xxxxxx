Weâ€™ve both been Apple fans for most of our lives. Shannon fondly recalls early games played on the Apple II and that first Macintosh, which really turned his school newspaper around. Christopher turned his own fandom into a real business with his first entrepreneurial venture, Dreams of the Phoenix, a Mac software company.
Thus, we both had high hopes when we heard rumors of an upcoming iPhone.
After the doldrums of the 1990s, Apple was on an upswing, and we were thrilled. Weâ€™d already seen how the Apple Airport had revolutionized local area network access and how the Apple iPod had removed the once ubiquitous Sony Walkman from the audio landscape with one fell swoop. We hoped that the iPhone would do the same for the cell phone industry.
It was Christopher who stood in line on that late June afternoon in 2007, purchasing one of the 270,000 iPhones sold in those first 30 hours. Despite being a lifelong techie, Shannon had never owned a cell phone before the iPhone, but he got his on June 29 too, and since then itâ€™s been his constant companion. (Heâ€™s still more likely to look up a map while on a long bike ride than he is to make a call, but thatâ€™s part of the beauty of the deviceâ€”itâ€™s many things for many different people.) Weâ€™re programmers, so after we had our iPhones in hand, the next step was to program for them. We both came into this world of iPhone programming through the web.
