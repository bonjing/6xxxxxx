Reposts needed: ""{Repost}[BBC06...]"" and possibly ""[BBC21...]"" & : ""[BBC22...]"" if no seeders are coming back. Also, ""[BBC30...] is VERY slow. Your help and patience is highly appreciated - your offer to repost is exceptionally kind! THANK YOU!
N.B.: If necessary I will later leave comments here if further reposts may be needed. Please check back from time to time, thank you. (I am seeding ALL your D&P discs)."
