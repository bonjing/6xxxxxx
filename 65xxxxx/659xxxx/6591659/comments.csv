,jurjenb,2011-08-19T17:41Z,"Used it for some testing and it works!

Thanks for a good upload!"
,umim,2011-08-20T17:47Z,Why in the hell it's split to 29 rar's ??????? What kind of derail mind did that?
,artichok,2011-08-24T17:30Z,This is a Fosi release - why's he not being credited by the uploader?
,RafVne2,2011-10-24T21:26Z,"Well... if this is a Fosi release, then I'm glad already, because now I know this program is going to be awesome. When Fosi releses it, that means the software is quite good, and their keygens always work as they supposed to.
The only ting is... why oh, why they always compressing .RAR's into another set of RAR's, and even one more set of RAR's "
,Clunk47,2011-11-09T17:14Z,"@umim - Why you bitchin' about it being split? It's free! Are you too lazy to extract or what? Anyway, thx much to FOSI for the release, and Carter67 for the Upload! Excellent Application!!!"

,pripoi1,2012-02-12T13:06Z,"My AV programs didn't find any problem, BUT, be careful -- all I did was have it create a partition out of free space, but the damn thing changed a bunch of other drive letters and even 'removed' the drive letter from a partition (on a different drive!) so it disappeared!"
