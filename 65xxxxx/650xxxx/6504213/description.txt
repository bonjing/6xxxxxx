In this briefing pack Thy Kingdom Come, Chuck Missler gives insight into the questions, Are you ready? Do you understand? Does your behavior now matter later?

"Thy Kingdom come...." (Matt 6:10) is part of the "Lord's Prayer" and yet few Christians have any idea what it is really about.

Gabriel promised Mary that Jesus would sit upon the Throne of David. Has this happened yet? Is there a relationship between the Millennium and the Davidic Kingdom.
