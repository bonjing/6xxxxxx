Irish comedian Brendan O'Carroll stars as Agnes Brown in Mrs. Brown's Boys. 
Ireland's funniest and proudest mother, Agnes Brown, is a foul-mouthed Dublin 
matriarch who interferes in the lives of her children and friends.

The theatre show Mrs. Brown's Boys has been a sell-out success for 
a number of years in Eire and the north of Britain, and this series,
 specially written by Brendan for the BBC, is jam-packed with all the laughs,
 surprises and drama of Mrs Brown on stage. Prepare for a riot of bad behaviour
 as Agnes offers help and advice to her family and friends.
