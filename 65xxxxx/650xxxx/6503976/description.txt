They Sold Their Souls For Rock 'N' Roll 1 - 4 (DivX)

Is it true that Satan is the master musician working behind the popular music scene and influencing our youth?

Fasten your seat belts as you go on an eye-popping ride upon the roller coaster of Rock, and find out how Rockâ€™s most popular artists have Sold Their Souls for Rock and Roll. In this mind-blowing exposÃ© Pastor Joe Schimmel reveals just how Satan has been effectively using popular music to undermine Godâ€™s plan for the family and ultimately heralding the coming of the Antichrist and his kingdom on earth.

This full-length video series contains 10 hours of eye-popping, rare, and some never before seen footage that will leave you picking your jaw up off the ground, as you see hundreds of artists (most of whom are not covered in the abbreviated 3-hour version) being used by Satan to destroy many lives. Come behind the scenes with us as we expose the deceptive agendas of many of yesterday and todayâ€™s secular artists, such as: Elvis, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, U2, Creed, Madonna, Britney Spears, DMX, Tupac, Tori Amos, and many more. 

It's time to remove the blinders - guard yourself and those you love from one of Satanâ€™s most powerful tools!

Hosted and narrated by Pastor Joseph Schimmel.
