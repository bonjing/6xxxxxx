[T],fredyr,2011-06-28T17:57Z,"m8 you are unfair to other uploaders, i'm sorry to say that. A dupe is the exact same torrent of the same movie and i'd never do that. IMO there's nothing wrong with different encodes of the same movie. Just because you indexed the CHD print it doesn't mean DIFFERENT encodes from amiable or wiki or esir shouldn't be indexed. Now...about that ""i saw the devil"" torrent. Don't you think you should delete your print since it only has 2channel AC3 audio, unnecessary russian audio streams and the wrong DAR flag with the black borders?"

And more torrents better option...There could be an CHD fan or an AMIABLE fan out there"

,ofpirate,2011-06-28T19:44Z,"afraid I have to agree with fredyr & downtyu on this one - options are infinitely better.. 

part of what makes this so much fun for some of us is constantly being on the lookout for opportunities to upgrade titles in our library - although I don't see myself replacing the CHD print with the AMIABLE print... if there was a WIKI or DON print, I probably would..

on a side-note, i'd like to thank each of you (and the entire community) for your ongoing efforts.. personally, my life has truly been enriched

sharing is caring - it would be a mistake to ever let politics get in the way of this!"
[V],GoodFilms,2011-06-29T01:14Z,you guys are clueless.
[V],GoodFilms,2011-06-29T01:19Z,"It is counterproductive to upload EXTREMELY SIMILAR torrents, especially when they are large files (like most HD torrents). It's that simple and any argument against that comes some from someone who just isn't experienced enough to realise.

The 3 most experienced HD uploaders (aoloffline, bozx and myself) are all against dupes because we have seen what they do.

End of."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-06-29T01:20Z,and I'm not a dick. I just wish it didn't take people so looonngg to realise the truth. takes some people years...
[V],GoodFilms,2011-06-29T01:32Z,"It's great to have new people on the scene, honestly. It gives the rest of us less to do. But we ought to all work together, rather than against one another.

Otherwise good torrents die."
