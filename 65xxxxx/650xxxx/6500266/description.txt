                Up, Horny, Down.
                British Comedy Award winner Kayvan Novak, Rhys Thomas
                and Richard Madden star in a six-part comedy series
                from Brian Fillis, inspired by Tom Reynolds' book
                Blood, Sweat and Tea. To the outside world Stuart,
                Ashley and Rachid look like angels of mercy; to their
                colleagues, they're a trio of pedantic know-alls; and
                to the career alcoholics and late-night revellers on
                the swarming streets of Leeds, they're nothing more
                than glorified taxi drivers with one drop-off point -
                Accident and Emergency. In the opening episode, the
                team attend a major road traffic collision where
                Stuart takes the radical decision to give an
                open-heart massage to jump-start a woman's heart.
                Back at A&E the lads feel the effects of the shock
                and adrenaline and are forced to see the hospital
                counsellor.
