,chrispinto,2011-07-02T00:03Z,Nope no joy with the piratebay tracker at all :(
,mike19601,2011-07-02T00:03Z,what is the difference between DP 4 and this one?
,chrispinto,2011-07-02T00:03Z,"I can confirm it's a true GM, I know the source from which this is coming from, which in turn comes directly from an Apple Mac OS Dev account. 100% legit."

,ahheck01,2011-07-02T00:07Z,"Dling now, then will seed after install.  Thanks for the torrent.  Heh, download is varying from 50KB/s to 600KB/s.  Everyone seed please!"

,bella92108,2011-07-02T00:12Z,"Thanks Chris! One more question, have they announced the process to install on a MB Air that doesn't have a disk drive? Will this install from within 10.6.8 as an on-top install, or how does it work since normally one boots to the CD or included OSX Flash Drive?"
,ClarkCable,2011-07-02T00:24Z,"What I have read on this one is that its missing some parts, it lacks the intro movie, etc, so it's not golden master, that it sent to store,, or am i wrong??"
,chrispinto,2011-07-02T00:43Z,"This is the GM Master as taken directly from the Apple Dev Centre. It is ""as is"" release, the same version expected to be put on the App Store in the next week or two.

As for installing, you need to have Snow Leopard installed to be able to install this. a .dmg or .app file will be inside the zip once downloaded. :)"
,ahheck01,2011-07-02T00:43Z,"@mike19601  The changes will be continuously updated as they are discovered here:  http://itsalltech.com/2011/07/01/apple-releases-mac-os-x-lion-gold-master-seed-to-developers/

So far there isn't much that's noticeable."
,packy17,2011-07-02T00:56Z,"@ClarkCable

I think both DP3 and 4 lacked the movie, and Lion isn't being sold in stores, it's digital only. The movie might pop in the Mac App Store version, but perhaps the GM is set to off by default because they know devs have installed multiple versions of 10.7 already. I'm not even going to try to download this yet tho, tracker connection is being refused and not enough seeders. I'll wait."

,ahheck01,2011-07-02T02:10Z,"LOL.  This isn't fake.  Check out the track record of iMZDL.  Perfect track record.  He gets these downloads directly from his own developer account.  This is 100% legit.  The reason there are so few seeders is because you can't be a seeder until you finish downloading it, which takes time when it starts with one person.  Have patience, but don't complain if you're not going to seed yourself."

,tomshe,2011-07-02T03:23Z,"I hope you guys realise how retarded you are being, the seeders/leechers aren't everything..  The thousand or so people leeching are also seeding the parts of the file that they have, so you can get pretty good speed, I'm personally getting 8.6mb/s download speed, so should be done in 5 minutes.. I'm seeding it at 5mb/s too.. so look at the bigger picture, not just the seeder/leecher ratio."

Dear fellow Pirate. Please do post if the file you downloaded is the genuine one.
Because, I have a monthly 10GB cap, and I have just entered the plan. If I'll be downloading this file, and of course uploading it, half of it will be used up, as I keep 100:90 as DL and UL speed ratios.

Anyone with the completed copy, Please do tell that the ZIP file has no passwords, or is not Fake.

I respect iMZDL graciously for their work, but it's internet. I have fallen a few times for fake downloads and can't spend my monthly quota.

It is a request. Please do cooperate/post if you can.

You can also Google for the iCloud 3 beta direct download from iMZDL that works with this latest 10.7 release. With that said, Lion is simply amazing.

Hey radioactive76.

Why don't u learn to behave?

The question was aimed at all those with complete copies to let others know that the zip is fine and the copy is working.

What I said about fake torrents wasn't bitching, you verbal diarrhoea personified.

Understand that many others interested in this piece are also keen to know if all the seeders got it working and in fact the zip is not corrupt or fake.

Many times the uploader (usually 'NOT' the original receiver) of the ""stuff"", doesn't have a clue if the ZIP/RAR is a-ok or not. He/She isn't to blame, u jackass!!!

I checked on scene / releases it hasn't popped up there yet. Hence, wished if what here is true.

Guess, this thing ping-pong abusiveness could have been avoided if you just wouldn't waste time flaming posts, demeaning others and do something productive like those who genuinely commented after my question and Thereby, helped others in taking it and furthermore uploading/sharing it.

Someone should send you to a correctional facility. Maybe even create a charitable trust ""JUST TO KEEP YOU THERE""!!!

,Axial,2011-07-02T21:03Z,"I definitely agree Apple could have probably done better; much better. Unfortunately I wasn't so lucky with some of my tweaks not playing nicely with Lion [geektool in particular]. Also memory consumption went up by an entire gigabyte and the boot times put on an average of 30+ seconds. The 'Mission Control' feature (Spaces Replacement) is a far cry from using Hyperspaces (which is not and will not be compatible with 10.7). 

This upload is worth a 10 just for the sheer fact that I didn't have to pay for this heap of disappointment. I rate Lion as it stands at a 5 from my last 24 hours of usage. Kudo's to the uploader, and I recommend you doing a carbon copy of your original 10.6.8 in case you're not convinced like myself."

,tezgno,2011-07-03T02:00Z,"@ImperialX, @bryanlanning, and @Stoneage11, there is no need to ""upgrade"" to the mac app store version as this IS the Mac App Store version. Apple decided to release the GM (Golden Master... AKA Final Version) to the developers ahead of time. This file was downloaded through the Mac App Store and is the same exact file that you would get if and when you purchase Lion from the Mac App Store. You do not need a dev account to install this as this is the actual final version. Apple is just continuing their tradition of releasing the final versions of their software (they do this often with IOS) about a week or two before they release that same software to the public. They probably do this as a ""thank you."" "

,tezgno,2011-07-03T15:28Z,"@ImperialX, yes you would be able to update to any future point revisions for Lion via software update as normal. In fact, if Apple discovers any bugs between the GM and the public release (the very rare GM2) you would be able to pull those fixes as well. Basically, it's no different than downloading a RTM disc from Apple, sans the fact that this update will be distributed digitally (and, thus, technically will not be an RTM since no disc production is going to happen)."

,nonukez,2011-07-03T22:21Z,"Great torrent!! Thank you so much!
Couple of things...
Some people seem to be having trouble unzipping the zip file. These are the type of people who should not be installing this.
Loving the new gestures, and I can imagine that a desktop user would feel somewhat crippled using Lion unless they had a multitouch device.
Also for those who autohide the dock it feels like the dock comes up a split second faster.
I know a lot of people bitch about the fact that dashboard is a separate space: you can adjust that in mission control preferences.
One huge problem I find though is that spaces can't be organized manually... and since fullscreen apps are now in separate spaces you may have to go through 5-6 different spaces to get to the one you want (if your using gestures). 
All in all a great upgrade, can't wait to see future updates."

First of all thank you for sharing this. :)
I have a question. I downloaded, unzipped, run the installation wizard, selected ""Macintosh HD"" and after 30 minutes everything is ok now. But it upgraded from 10.6.8. My files/apps are all there.
What am I supposed to do if I want to perform a clean install?
Thank you for your time."

and my Adobe CS5 master collection

Have since managed to get them both working fine.

I did one full seed but my acct has restrictions on how much I can download/ upload each month.

That said, YouTube is now working. In relation with the comment above, I restarted my MB, and can now play YouTube videos. Everything else seems to work fine (as of now).

In a MBP 2009, the install worked great, it's like an update, it keeps your apps and files without any change.

I've been using it for a week, and i doubt it that this could make it as the final release on thursday, 'cause it's buggy, i've had problems with latest versions of acrobat, photoshop, premiere, word, and finder.... yes, finder.

If this becomes the final release to be on sale, a pretty big update will follow soon.

The sad thing is, it's not that cool this lion thing, anyway, try it for yourself

About the scrolling, if you have in ipad or iphone, it feels more natural this new reversed way on lion, ...and you're gonna get used to it in a couple days, so, it's better."
