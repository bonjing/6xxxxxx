This CD includes two practices of Yoga Nidra - one for focusing your mind and energy, and one for complete rest at the end of a busy day. The gentle guiding voice of Devamani with music accompaniment guides you into a blissfully relaxed state.

Track 01

Designed to take the edge of stress! This practice is ideal when you need an energy boost. It helps centre the mind and concentrate efforts.

Track 02

Leave work behind and unwind! An aid to sleep and a stepping stone from the work mind set to the leisure mind set.
