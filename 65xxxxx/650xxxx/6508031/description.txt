[b]Thx Hive


CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D


Sources:
Video: Russian Relizlab
Audio: Imagines Line
thx

Encode:
The Russian Video was already nice to begin with.
The first 14 mins had a border above and below, and the aspect is slightly off throughout
switching constantly.
Since 95% of the movie looks better in 720x288 i decided to use that resolution.
I fixed the first 14 mins in aspect too, so no eggheads in that part like on imagines version.
I made a screenshot comparison between imagine and my version:

first screen is in that 14 min part range, the others afterwards.
Imagines video looks a bit sharper but the video is now not that milky and grainy as on imagines version.
I already did 30% more sharpness, that has to be enough, or it gets worse

Video needed sharpening, some correction of the perspective since it looks a bit skewed in the lower right
corner and a bit colouring.
Had a lot to fix on the audio part too, hiss and noise was present,which wasnt easy to get rid off.
Needed additional finetuning but after 3 tries its a lot better now without going over. check samples
Had to resync back the audio to my video, which didnt fit on various spots.

Btw: i have to say imagines avi was sync throughout, good job.[/b]
