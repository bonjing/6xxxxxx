,tysoNg,2011-06-29T02:54Z,I was there Saturday! Was so epic. Wish I could have gone all 3 days.
,elovee,2011-06-29T03:35Z,YOU ARE SO AWESOME. I will seed for weeks!!!!!!!
,majorionic,2011-06-29T11:31Z,these tracks are all transcoded from lossy sources to be 192kbps. this makes them sound bad. right now the original satellite radio rips that can be found elsewhere with noticeably higher audio quality. 
,feedmeh8,2011-06-29T11:33Z,"Thanks a lot for all the work you do in getting these torrents uploaded! You make it possible for me to experience events like this torrent that I would not be able to otherwise. I have awesome new music every week because of you. Events like this one and ASOT 500, that you uploaded make me feel like I am there. I can not find the words to thank you enough for everything you are doing. Long live DjLellone !"

The Source is SiriusXM Electric Area and the bit rate is 192k  (original sirius premium bit rate stream)

Best Regards"
[T],DjLellone,2011-06-29T13:34Z,P.S. Sound is NOT CONVERTED from lossy but maybe you speak without having heard it
