
Although John Wayne isn't seen on camera, that's 
definitely his voice heard at the end.
Wayne was listed in the end credits as "Michael Morris". 
His real name was Marion Michael Morrison.

This was the last time that Ward Bond worked 
with Ford and Wayne, 30 years after "The Big Trail".
Major Adams got to wear a different outfit in 
"The Colter Craven Story", but was in his regular clothes next episode.

Guest Stars --- John Carradine, Ken Curtis, Paul Birch,
and John Wayne (in the shadows...) as General Sherman.
