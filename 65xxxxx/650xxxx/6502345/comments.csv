,CockRobinson,2011-06-29T00:42Z,"Nick, as usual, you rock the Casbah. HUGE favour: can you let us know which of the two classes we should watch first in future (If you know)? I watched round 4's 250 class first and they SPOILED the 450 results half way through. BASTARDS."
,ninjakecil,2011-06-29T02:24Z,"Finally....thank you slicknick!
Been monitoring TPB for a couple of days to your upload. Great works.
Cheers from Indonesia!

@CockRobinson:
It should be 250 first and then 450.
And yes, they spoiled the result with the round 4.
Shame on them!"

,coryktm450,2011-06-29T03:32Z,"Thanks Nick!

Actually, the 450 race is always before the 250 race as part of the new format for 2011. Apparently the 250 class wanted the track to be rougher so they now run after the 450's. It's the opposite for supercross though."

,peronet666,2011-06-29T17:06Z,Thanx you ar the best
,ninjakecil,2011-07-01T14:51Z,"@coryktm450, thanks for letting us know that.

Next time I'll be watching the 450 first. Seems like watching the 250 first always spoiled the results."
