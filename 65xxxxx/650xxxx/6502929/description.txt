The crime-gone-bad thriller is a staple of the crime genre. Na Hong-jinâ€™s The Yellow Sea, a South Korean box-office hit making its North American debut at SIFF 2011, runs with the concept in a jittery thriller of a desperate taxi driver in Yanji (an autonomous region in Northern China dominated by ethnic Koreans) hired to kill a man in South Korea. Gu-nam (Ha Jung-woo) is Joseonjok, a Chinese citizen of Korean ancestry living in the impoverished region across the border. His wife hasnâ€™t contacted him since she left to work in Korea six months ago, heâ€™s deep in debt to the gangsters who smuggled her across the channel (the Yellow Sea of the title) and heâ€™s losing whatever he makes gambling at Mahjong. So a local crime boss, Myung (Kim Yun-seok), makes him an offer: wipe his debt clean in exchange for a simple murder.
