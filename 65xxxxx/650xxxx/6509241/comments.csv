You are obviously quite new to using the bit torrent protocol.

It is not necessary to specify any trackers in the torrent files you upload to The Pirate Bay.
The appropriate tracker entries are inserted into the torrent files automatically after they are uploaded.

In addition, the entire idea of using trackers is basically obsolete, now that all the modern bit torrent clients are DHT enabled.

Keep in mind that a tracker works the same way a telephone book does, it just lets you look up numbers.
Having a lot of telephone books won't make anyone you reach on the phone talk any faster."

Really not usable"
