        Release Notes:

        I can almost see it, that dream I'm dreaming but,
        there's a voice inside my head saying, you'll never reach it.
        Every step I'm taking, every move I make feels
        lost with no direction, my faith is shaking,
        But I, I gotta keep trying.
        I gotta keep my head held high

        There's always gonna be another mountain.
        I'm always gonna wanna make it move.
        Always gonna be an uphill battle
        And sometimes I'm gonna have to lose.
        It ain't about how fast I get there,
        Ain't about whats waiting on the other side.
        It's the climb.

        The struggles I'm facing,
        The chances I'm taking,
        Sometimes might knock me down
        But no I'm not breaking.
        I may not know it
        But these are the moments that
        I'm gonna remember most,
        Yeah, just gotta keep going.
        And I, I got be strong.

        Gotta keep on pushing on, cuz

        There's always gonna be another mountain.
        I'm always gonna wanna make it move.
        Always gonna be an uphill battle.
        Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose.
        Ain't about how fast I get there,
        Ain't about whats waitin on the other side.
        Its the climb.

        Keep on moving,
        Keep climbing,
        Keep the faith, babe.
        It's all about,
        It's all about the climb.
        Keep the faith.
        keep your faith
