,EastLink,2012-04-01T00:07Z,Thank you for this. All the other toby mac downloads have very low bitrates such as 92kbps (really?) but this one is very good quality.
,amayzer,2012-06-11T19:51Z,Does anyone anywhere plan on uploading a lossless TobyMac discography? I'm currently downloading another TobyMac discography in FLAC (not showing up on PirateBay) but it is incomplete. HELP!
