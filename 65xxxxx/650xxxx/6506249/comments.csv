Although you probably couldn't tell if you played through a PC speaker.  Thanks for the upload!"

I deliberately converted this from the iTunes .mp4 version into the 128 kbps .mp3 version to keep the download SMALL and QUICK.
But, if anybody wants this EP in higher kbps or in FLAC format, please let me know, and I'll upload it for you! :)"
,leader288,2011-09-20T15:34Z,kimeesteres! I would like a FLAC of this album please!
,Royalwitcheeez,2011-09-24T07:06Z,"It's 3 songs...how big can the file be? lol
Appreciate the up but I'd take 320kbps...

Space and speed are no longer an issue as in years past.

Again, thx for the up."
