         Gathered one summer in a beautiful shoreline     
         town, three generations are drawn together by    
         their patriarch. With endearing moments of       
         humor and uplifting spirit, Harvest is a         
         portrait of a family awkwardly yet delicately    
         hanging on to what was, what now is, and to      
         one another.
