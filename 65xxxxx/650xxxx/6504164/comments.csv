,pfcforever,2011-08-03T02:09Z,Full hd must be 1080p.
,khaj_vah,2011-08-16T17:54Z,"i usually dont comment on torrents but i must say THIS IS 1080p

,edalbkrad,2011-09-10T16:35Z,"fake, its not full HD.
Full HD is 1920x1080 not 1920x800 lol"
[T],murdoc47,2011-09-12T18:22Z,"my god people, add the black bars into the equasion. it's 2.35 : 1, if it was 1920x1080, it would be stretched, now wouldn't it?"
,jeaner28,2011-10-18T20:30Z,"i just made an account because i think this is just hilarious, murdoc is uploading multiple full hd movies and getting no love because he didnt include the blank spots above and below what you actually want to see. i found this out in about 5 seconds through the magic of google! thanks murdoc keep up the good work"
,jeaner28,2011-10-20T07:06Z,just downloaded the trilogy from murdoc and the resolution was fine but the movies barely even work. find another source...
