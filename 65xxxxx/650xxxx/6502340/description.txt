Associative Digital Network Theory is intended for researchers at industrial laboratories, teachers and students at technical universities, in electrical engineering, computer science and applied mathematics departments, interested in new developments of modeling and designing digital networks (DN: state machines, sequential and combinational logic) in general, as a combined math/engineering discipline. As background an undergraduate level of modern applied algebra (Birkhoff-Bartee: Modern Applied Algebra - 1970, and Hartmanis-Stearns: Algebraic Structure of Sequential Machines - 1970) will suffice.
