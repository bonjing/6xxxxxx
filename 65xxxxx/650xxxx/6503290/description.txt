Elementary Feedback Stabilization of the Linear Reaction-Convection-Diffusion Equation and the Wave Equation
Springer; 1st Edition | December 17, 2009 | ISBN-10: 3642046126 | 296 pages | PDF | 2.92 MB

This book addresses the feedback stabilization of the linear reaction-convection-diffusion equation and the linear wave equation. Both interior and boundary control problems are discussed. Methods employed to handle the problems include the eigenfunction expansion, integral transform, perturbed energy method, and optimal control technique. These powerful methods are frequently used for solving control problems of partial differential equations. Unlike the existing advanced control theory books written in an abstract setting, this book presents control theory by means of concrete examples. Therefore, this book is easy to read. Once readers learn about the ideas and methods from these concrete control examples, they can apply them to solve other control problems of partial differential equations.
