Ripped from the new live stream from Glenn Beck's web site. I have edited out the  
music played during the commercial breaks.

Notes: Doc Thompson in for Beck.  On the 29th Glenn & crew said they were on vacation next week.  I haven't decided yet if I will be uploading yet - stay tuned!

On another note, today marks the end of six solid months of capturing, editing and uploading Glenn Beck's webcast of his Radio show.  I hope you've enjoyed it!  To all those that have said "thanks" in all of the various posts you are very welcome.  Thanks for all those that continue to seed after downloading!
