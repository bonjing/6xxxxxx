From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with Becky Aker, a freelance writer from New York who writes for The New American. On Tuesday, Becky wrote about the TSA accosting a 95 year old woman who suffers from leukemia, forcing her to remove an adult diaper at a Florida airport. 

Alex also covers the latest on Obama's illegal wars in the Middle East, South Asia, northern Africa, waged without congressional consultation or formal declarations of war.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:
sebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
