i tested the ZWT version floating around the net, and noticed the ReadMe and License was from the previous build.

It looked suspicious... it looked like someone used Restorator and changed the build number to the new version... But i don't think ZWT did it.. it was posted at websites with old ZWT keygen and .nfo.

Thanks for this."
