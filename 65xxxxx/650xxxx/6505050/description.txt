 Album Info..: 
 
 Prior to Nick of Time, Bonnie Raitt had been a reliable cult artist, delivering a 
 string of solid records that were moderate successes and usually musically 
 satisfying. From her 1971 debut through 1982's Green Light, she had a solid streak, 
 but 1986's Nine Lives snapped it, falling far short of her usual potential. 
 Therefore, it shouldn't have been a surprise when Raitt decided to craft its 
 follow-up as a major comeback, collaborating with producer Don Was on Nick of Time. 
 At the time, the pairing seemed a little odd, since he was primarily known for the 
 weird hipster funk of Was (Not Was) and the B-52's' quirky eponymous debut, but the 
 match turned out to be inspired. Was used Raitt's classic early-'70s records as a 
 blueprint, choosing to update the sound with a smooth, professional production and a 
 batch of excellent contemporary songs. In this context, Raitt flourishes; she never 
 rocks too hard, but there is grit to her singing and playing, even when the surfaces 
 are clean and inviting. And while she only has two original songs here, Nick of Time 
 plays like autobiography, which is a testament to the power of the songs, 
 performances, and productions. It was a great comeback album that made for a great 
 story, but the record never would have been a blockbuster success if it wasn't for 
 the music, which is among the finest Raitt ever made. She must have realized this, 
 since Nick of Time served as the blueprint for the majority of her '90s albums. --
