                Wild at Heart.
                Comedy. Liam finds out that Chloe's got a fake ID and
                plans to go to a flash party. He sets off with Tommy
                to find her, only to discover she's been one step
                ahead of him all along. Meanwhile, Caroline is fed up
                with Jim's bad behaviour whenever he visits the hotel
                where he works. When an opportunity for revenge
                presents itself, she starts to concoct a plan.
