I was overjoyed when I saw you upload the first one, then equally so when you kept up with the update that fast. :)  Thanks again."
,boondocksaint78,2011-07-02T07:19Z,"Agreed, thanks for both uploads. It would be nice to have the Greydog stuff cracked as well as Wolverine, and Strategic Designs ones as well. Believe me if I knew how to do it I would."
,Aerohip,2011-07-02T23:32Z,Help....how do I do this. I have the exe file on Vuze..how do I overwrite the exe file?
,frosticle,2011-07-03T04:30Z,"Aerohip,

The instructions are included in it, but, here is what you should do:

Update your game or install the full updated version, then copy the cracked exe file over to the directory where you installed the game, which should be something like program files/out of the park developments/ootp baseball 2012"

,frosticle,2011-07-05T06:45Z,"It took me two tries to get it to work. The first time of trying to license it didn't work, so I closed it and reopened, then tried again.

Make sure you follow the instructions too. If you don't copy over the cracked exe, it won't license."
