Use MPC    http://cccp-project.net/ to be able to automatically recognize & play the external Audio tracks
or mux the Audio in MKV with  mkvmerge 
http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKVtoolnix if you wish to use other player.

Media Player Classic Home Cinema should be able to play this without having to install any codic pack, though.

Just unzip and run. Nothing to install."

Anyway, it is a good good movie, thanks again !"
