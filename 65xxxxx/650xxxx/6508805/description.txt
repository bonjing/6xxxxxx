              Plot.................: E.F. Bloodworth has returned to his home - a forgotten
 corner of Tennessee - after forty years of roaming. The wife he walked out on has withered
 and faded, his three sons are grown and angry. Warren is a womanizing alcoholic, Boyd is
 driven by jealousy to hunt down his wife and her lover, and Brady puts hexes on his enemies
 from his mamma's porch. Only Fleming, the old man's grandson, treats him with the respect
 his age commands, and sees past all the hatred to realize the way it can poison a man's
 soul. It is ultimately the love of Raven Lee, a sloe-eyed beauty from another town, that
 gives Fleming the courage to reject this family curse.
