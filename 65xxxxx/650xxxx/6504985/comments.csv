,delphin73,2011-07-03T20:39Z,Može li pomoć prijatelja? Da li postoji video zapis Solgder of fortune od Deep Purple-a? Nisam uspeo da nađem na net-u. Veliki pozdrav i zahvalnost za tvoje upload-ove.
[T],zlatkopupovac,2011-07-03T23:20Z,"Nazalost do sada nigde nisam naisao na taj video tako da ga nemam u svojoj kolekciji.
""Soldier of Fortune"" uz  ""When A Blind Man Cries"" je i meni jedna od njihovih najdrazih songova."

Mozda ce biti zadovoljavajuca alternativa :

WHITESNAKE (David Coverdale)  -  Soldier Of Fortune  (unplugged)‏

Part 302"

Hi Zlatko, 
As I mentioned by your conversation in the comments, you must be a Croatian or close to Croatia located person. Nice - you're welcome ...
To the subject: I once had a Croatian girl friend (about 1975) who loved the music from a famous Croatian group: Bijelo Dugme ... and the best and most popular song I remember was Kad bi bio bijelo dugme ... do you have a video from this pretty nice song from 1974 ? Would be real great !
Hope to be able to help you once, too. 
Beujoulais"
