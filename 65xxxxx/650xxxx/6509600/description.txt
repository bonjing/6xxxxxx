Time Frequency Signal Analysis and Processing covers fundamental concepts, principles and techniques, treatment of specialised and advanced topics, methods and applications, including results of recent research.
This book deals with the modern methodologies, key techniques and concepts that form the core of new technologies used in IT, multimedia, telecommunications as well as most fields of engineering, science and technology. It focuses on advanced techniques and methods that allow a refined extraction and processing of information, allowing efficient and effective decision making that would not be possible with classical techniques. The Author, fellow of IEEE for Pioneering contributions to time-frequency analysis and signal processing education, is an expert in the field, having written over 300 papers on the subject over a period pf 25 years.
This is a REAL book, not a mere collection of specialised papers, making it essential reading for researchers and practitioners in the field of signal processing.
