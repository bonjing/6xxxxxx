                           DESCRiPTiON 

 An investigation into counterfeit pound coins, some of which are given to     
 customers in high-street banks, with a look at the work of authorities trying 
 to track down those responsible. Plus, how a woman was misled into buying a   
 sick puppy with forged pedigree documentation, and a fake vet who used an     
 imitation degree certificate to go into business. 
                            
                                 Enjoy!
