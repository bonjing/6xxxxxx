Document's series of "complete recorded works in chronological order" has resulted not only in all of the performances being reissued of major pre-war blues performers, but the work of quite a few minor personalities too. Ed Bell, a singer/guitarist from Atlanta, lived until 1966 but made all of his recordings during 1927 and 1929-1930. One of his best sessions was cut one day in September 1927, a solo date resulting in four memorable lowdown blues.

Otherwise, Bell is heard as "Sluefoot Joe," "Barefoot Bill From Alabama," and on two vocal-guitar duets with Pillie Bolling. In addition, this CD has Bolling's only other recordings, two solo numbers from 1930. A collector's item of its kind, this disc will be enjoyed by fans of early country blues.
