In this essential new text, Rickards and Clark encourage students and practitioners alike to delve deeper into leadership complexities and to discover what's new and important by testing and re-drawing their leadership 'maps': their aspirations of leadership.

This exciting text reviews issues such as transactional leadership, transformational leadership, 5th level leadership, servant leadership, and the management of ethical dilemmas, and in illustrating the confusions and contradictions of leadership, it develops an approach that will prove invaluable. Important issues covered include:

* trust based leadership
* social identity explanations of leadership
* distributed leadership
* 'tipping point' theory of transformational change.
