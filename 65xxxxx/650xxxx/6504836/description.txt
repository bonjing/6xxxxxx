Release info:

In keeping with our pursuit of new and exciting music we've decided to put out a release on the tech side of the electronic spectrum, trusting his ears for the genre we called upon our Danish friend Moses a.k.a Muggi Dane to put together a compilation for us.

The result is V.A. 'Tech Tales', the first release of what we expect will be an ongoing series of releases. The compilation features a diverse array of layered, laid back and funky tracks that complement each other nicely. Expect to be captivated the whole way through. Tech Tales is certainly a release that will make you bump, grind and get your groove on!
