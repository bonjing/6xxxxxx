and if necessary i will up another version
sorry again for this inconvenience

I just download the official release from the DVDFab fab website and use the same patch that worked for the last 10+ releases."
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-07-02T09:36Z,"yeah Chaos1972 that's true also,i agree !
btw,in one of my computer,the BBB archieve is corrupted and on the others : not !
strange,anyway !
dll will work with many versions,indeed !
but sometimes,we are lazy or noob also...
don't forget that as well.

@ Tyr3ll and CHAOS1972 - I still do not understand how you get the patch to work? Can you download DvdFab to a folder on your desktop and then replace the patch or do you have to download DvdFab to you program files? It was much easier when there was a key!"
