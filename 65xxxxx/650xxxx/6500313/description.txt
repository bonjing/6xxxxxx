This is a full resolution, high profile x264 DVD rip of Sliders - Season 2 (of 5).  These files may be a little large for some.  But if you aren't worried about space, and want a higher quality, to output to a t.v. or such, then this is for you.  I've previewed the episodes and they look and sound great on a 50 inch LCD/surround sound system.
