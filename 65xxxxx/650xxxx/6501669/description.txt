Marcus Miller â€“ The international jazz superstar whose work has defined and redefined the sound of modern jazz - from his groundbreaking production and multi-instrumental work in the 80â€™s with Miles Davis on TUTU, to his 2001 Grammy winning best seller M2.
Michel Petrucciani â€“ The legendary pianist who touched the world with his very small body and his tremendous sound and aura. Heâ€™s made dozens of classic recordings solo and with the likes of Wayne Shorter, Stephane Grappelli, Roy Haynes, and Steve Gadd.
Kenny Garrett â€“ The Miles Davis alum who went on to become one of the best loved and best selling saxists of our time.
Bireli Lagrene â€“ The prodigy who stunned the world as a pre-teen his brilliant Django Reinhardt-inspired gypsy guitar playing and then later with his boundary pushing fusion work with Jaco Pastorious. Lenny White â€“ A drummer with so many classic credits, from Miles Davisâ€™ "Bitches Brew, Chick Coreaâ€™s "Return To Forever" recordings, "Jaco Pastorius," as well as modern masterpieces by Marcus Miller, Rachael Z and Michel Petrucciani.

On July 7th 1994, Michel Petrucciani hosted the second ever "Dreyfus Night" â€“ a special concert in Paris meant to showcase the wonderful array of musicians associated with Francis Dreyfus and his new label. The night before the "Dreyfus Night," Francis Dreyfus attended a concert of Marcus Miller with Kenny Garrett. The two enthusiastically welcomed Francisâ€™ invitation to his special concert, and this historical quintet was born. The line-up was never to be repeated â€“ this was truly a once in a lifetime meeting of some of the most important figures in recent jazz history: Marcus Miller, Michel Petrucciani, Kenny Garrett, Bireli Lagrene, and Lenny White. Together they shocked and delighted a very lucky Parisian audience with a crackling set of funky jazz â€“ a "Massey Hall" for the modern era!
