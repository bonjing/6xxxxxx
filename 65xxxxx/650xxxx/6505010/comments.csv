A/10 
V/10 
Plot: This dinosaur adventure is aimed at younger viewers, the storyline approach appears to be borrowed from Disney, like the kind of films I remember seeing in my own youth where a cat, a (insert animal of choice) and a goat would team up to trek across America in order to find a previous owner who has moved house and reluctantly sold them to a cruel new owner.... or something like that. This time the narration focuses on Scar the vegetarian dinosaur who treks across what is now America but in those days wasnâ€˜t. Meanwhile Patch the carnivorous dinosaur - a less appealing Velociraptor lookalike - stays where he is and learns how to survive in the Arctic winters. (Narrated by Stephen Fry)
