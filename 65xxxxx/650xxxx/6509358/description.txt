Enclosed in this archive lies some of the lulziest products developed and released by some of the lulziest fellows and shipmates we've come to know. Lulzsec. In this archive, you will find their many adventures including the Infaragard leak, the PBS defacing, and the final booty dropping on their farewell day. May we remember forever those shipmates who bravely fought tyranny, not for fame, or money, or power, but simply for the lulz.
