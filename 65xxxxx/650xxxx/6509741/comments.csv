,tyecita,2011-07-29T02:33Z,@tropicool48 I mentioned that the quality of the video is low. But don't fuss I have a great quality coming out today so be on the look out for your son. I actually am finishing edit/converting all of season 1 so those that were low quality will be coming out soon. Please seed and thank you for your comment unfortunately I don't receive any. Kinda is a downer after so much work and my own money is put forth in putting out these videos for the masses.
