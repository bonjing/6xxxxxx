Encoder's notes: 

The video source frame rate was 14.434 and variable, so I had to use a pre-encoding filter to convert to constant 25 fps. 

Other than that, work included cropping of the black bars, strong deblocking, dehaloing, and stabilization; motion compensation, and mild denoising and sharpening. 

Obviously, there is still a jerky motion effect that cannot be fully corrected due to the low frame rate in the source. See screenshots comparison and check the video sample included in the folder.
