Pipeline Welding Handbook | PDF | 1.30 MB

Every day countless kilometres of steel pipelines are installed worldwide for the most varied civil and industrial uses. They form real networks comparable to a system of road networks, which, although not so obvious, are definitely much more intricate and carry fluids that have become essential for us.
To comply with technical specifications and fulfil the necessary safety requisites, special materials and welding processes which have evolved with the sector have been developed in recent years. The main welding process used to install the pipelines is manual welding with coated electrode, which, thanks to its ease and versatility, is still the one most used. However, to limit costs and increase welding productivity, particularly on long routes, various constructors have adopted the semi-automatic or completely automatic welding process with solid wire or wire flux coated with gaseous protection. This handbook describes both methods. Ample space has been dedicated, in particular, to manual welding, with particular reference to the operative practice and quality assessment, due to its considerable use still today, but not neglecting more modern and productive methods which will be increasingly used in future.
The presumption of this work is to be able to satisfy the most demanding technician and welder, but, in particular, to supply each user with useful information and a solid operative basis, as regards the processes and filler materials and the welding equipment.
