Like someone else said, there are also a few minutes missing at the beginning. Since it switches to a different language, I wonder if their theatrical release was a little different than the US release. The first scene in the US releases shows a closeup of his gfs ass in panties as she walks to the bed and there is some dialogue between them."

The new girl is hotter than Fox, but her acting is questionable...I dont see why they couldnt just use a beautiful women who isnt a model, but an actual actress?
Also, I thought the new girls character was a bit more submissive to Sam than a women actually would be in reality.

man, look at all the hater comments. okay, where to start??? the whole point of pirating is to check if a movie is even worth paying to see it. if this seems like it'll be worth paying 15 dollars to see it, i'll stop it 10 minutes in and go buy a movie ticket. 


that's exactly what i did with robin hood, and i'm so glad i downloaded it, because i wouldn't have ever chanced it without seeing the rip first.


lastly, when you're rating a cam rip, you're not supposed to rate it based on a fugging bluray rip, you fagbags; you rate it based on the best cam rip that you can imagine you fugging turd thieves.

For a screen. It would be A:3, V:4 otherwise.

The sound is lacking in bass and switches to Russian briefly several times. There are three missing segments, I am unsure of length, but that does take away from the movie experience. Overall I rate this movie a 3, it is just the same Michael Bay thing with a typical story line.  Too much slow motion and the new girl is a very terrible actress. For the sake of wanting to watch cool explosions, this screen doesn't do it justice, but if you can't afford the theaters, then this is the best for now. And thank you uploader for providing this.

Like alot of people are saying, you can hear the people in the threatre, sometimes louder than the movie.  
The movie audio isn't that great but it's good enough to watch

The movie has some scenes missing.  Looks like he edited out where the camera falls or has something blocking it.  In one instance there is something blocking the lens.

The movie overall was boring in the beginning but got better towards the end.  This movie would have been better if Megan Fox was in it.  The new girl can't act worth a shit.

For that I give the movie a 5.  It's not worth an admission to the theater."

,rosserm,2011-07-11T08:40Z,"OK FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT COMMENTS SAYING THIS AND THAT, ILL STRAIGHTEN IT ALL OUT:
1. My personal A/V rating is(0 is blank screen and 10 is DVD quality) 6/8. Great video quality, however the audio rises and lowers a couple times throughout and you can hear someone coughing and someone messing with the cam. Not complaining though.

2. There is what im assuming is about a 20 minute gap missing in the final hour, doesn't seem to mess with the overall story, but it is missing. This DL is 132 minutes while the imdb.com/ runtime is 154.

3. Overall I CANNOT complain about this torrent. Amazing video and great audio. Sure there are some blips here and there, but this is free...if you want to complain that bad, go spend 10 bucks to see it in a cinema.

Great Upload!!! Thanx and seeding as long as I can."
,Saiji,2011-07-11T11:14Z,"Based on the reviews I've seen, 20 mins missing from the end might be to the films benefit! Still giving it a miss though, not wasting any more bandwidth on Michael Bays military recruitment videos."
,rosserm,2011-07-12T04:43Z,I correct my previous comment. This torrent is missing the FIRST 20 minutes. Sorry about that.

,jhargramdevil,2011-07-23T19:12Z,"I JUST DON'T KNOW WHETHER ANYBODY OF YOU HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN THIS PARTICULAR MOVIE (TORRENT) BEFORE COMMENTING???

THIS TORRENT DOES NOT CONTAIN THE FIRST 12.50 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE. THE MOVIE OF THIS TORRENT IS OF 131.35 MINUTES. THE ACTUAL MOVIE IS OF 157 MINUTES. HOW CAN MORE THAN 12000 PERSONS DOWNLOADED WITHOUT POINTING THAT OUT HERE???

REGARDING QUALITY:

A: 4
v:5.5    

(RATING TAKING AS AXXO TORRENTS A 10, V10)

SEVERAL TIMES THE HALL SOUND IS AUDIBLE. MY PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION IS DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS. THERE ARE BETTER TORRENTS (OF COURSE CAM ONLY) AVAILABLE IN TPB.

Any hints tips etc will be greatly appreciated...."
,Sneaky_B,2011-08-09T22:20Z,"uTorrent  for the torrents, in my opinion. Limewire had a court injunction slapped on them so they are no more.
