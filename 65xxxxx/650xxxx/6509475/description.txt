The Review:

Triple threat writer/director/actor Adam Deacon stars as 
K (real name Kenneth), a wannabe MC who disastrously turns 
to dealing weed after his family loses nearly all their possessions 
to bailiffs. He and his equally hopeless crew get into all kinds of 
scrapes with the local criminals. Oh, and it's a comedy. Hopelessly 
broad and almost continually annoying, it's a film that it's hard to 
imagine even the target audience warming to. It's really just a torrent 
of age-old gags and clumsy, pointless situations dressed up with street 
slang. At least they didn't appear to have wasted much money on this, 
which is one of the few plus points.

Also, they can't spell Another. Morons.

Utter shit.

The Preamble:

Meet Kenneth. He thinks he's got the moves. He thinks 
he's got swagger. He thinks he can spit bars. But in reality, 
he's a wasteman!

With the bailiffs banging on the door, parents screaming in 
his ear, and finding no luck with the ladies, he needs to fix 
up, and fast. When our boy starts selling weed to get himself 
out of trouble, local badman Tyrone is vex, opening up a world 
of hurt for Kenneth and his misfit crew. But he ain't gonna go 
down without a fight. It s time for him to get rich, or cry trying!

From the mind of Adam Deacon comes the UK's first hilarious 
urban comedy, with a BIG cast including Femi Oyeniran, Jaime 
Winstone, Ollie Barbieri, Richard Blackwood & Ashley Walters, 
and featuring hot tunes from Tinie Tempah, Boy Better Know, Wiley 
and Dizzee Rascal. This ain't just any hood, it's Anuvahood!
