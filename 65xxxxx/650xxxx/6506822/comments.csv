[V],globeplus,2011-07-01T13:26Z,"HI ! Enjoy this nice argument epic TV Series in 9 episodes with this file , the audio is in english with portuguese subtitles .

The quality to watch is ok to a normal player with flash or maybe a real appropriate flash player and everyone can probably already have a nice prefered converter , what i mean is that the final size obtained it was about the restrainged of the bitrate getting stable picture but with poor bitrate , with a nice converter , the conversion to a nice high quality avi or mp4 it is possible , changing the not too much bitrate available for the moment to avery acceptable 1000 or more from the bitrate getting a more clean and stable picture , the picture on the episodes still enjoyable and watchable like this thanks to the good quality from the originals , with a conversion to a better bitrate it will be like a 5 gb file or something with all the episodes from this TV serie .

My compliments to all the net limitated users with this carefull and nice appropriate work , giving the possibility for not too much time or size get a nice TV serie .

I wish the best to all of you and please keep the good sharing spirit no matter is the net speed , we are all users after all ... Thank you . "
