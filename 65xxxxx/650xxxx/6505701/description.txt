Release Notes:

Uncut, May 2011
Inventive, playful and utterly engrossing, Celebration Florida has much to revel
in. ****

"Celebration, Florida" is The Felice Brothers' fourth LP. Recorded in the
gymnasium and theatre of Beacon, NY's old high school, the band explore a
multitude of sounds and instrumentation throughout the expansive album. It's
inspired, imaginative, heady, menacing, passionate, and rollicking. Most
importantly, it's as steadfastly authentic as ever, expanding upon the dark,
woozy undercurrent of ramshackle barroom blues, vaudevillian atmospherics, and
surreal storytelling of their previous albums
