For those who are a little twisted inside, Naughty Bear is PERFECT. Youâ€™re â€œNaughtyâ€ the bear, who is always excluded from the parties and such on â€œPerfection Islandâ€. They make you angry with their exclusion, so you get to â€œpunishâ€ the other bears. In the first case, youâ€™re upset you didnâ€™t get invited to Daddleâ€™s birthday party. You can sneak around the island (which is in 3 parts) or you can run around and simply cause mayhem. But! If you run around, you could get hurt. Cake can only raise your health so much.


The Gold Edition of Naughty Bear is out right now for PS3 and 360. The new cover for the Gold Edition is just priceless and alone makes it a game you need to add to your gaming collection.
