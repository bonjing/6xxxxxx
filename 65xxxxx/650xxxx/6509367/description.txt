Included chapters cover reaction propulsion systems and real gas effects.
Written and organized in a manner that makes it accessible for self learning.
From the Back Cover
The primary aspects of gas dynamics, meticulously covered and easy to understand

Fundamentals of Gas Dynamics provides the essential applications and problem-solving techniques used in gas dynamics. Written in an accessible but rigorous style, this book includes all the equations, tables, and charts necessary to approach the problems and exercises in each chapter. Temperature-entropy diagrams and the role of entropy are highlighted throughout to make this elusive property more understandable and useful.

New to this Second Edition is a chapter covering real gas behavior. The information in this chapter provides a valuable bridge between the conventional types of lower-temperature applications and propulsion applications, both covered elsewhere in this book. Included in this new chapter on real gas behavior is a simplified technique for solving problems where the ratio of the heat capacities varies appreciably, as well as discussions and examples comparing this technique to more exact methods.
