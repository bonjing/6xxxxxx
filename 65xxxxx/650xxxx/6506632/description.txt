On the occasion of Gisbert Hasenjaeger's 60-th birthday an informal symposium on set theory and model theory was held at Bonn from I.-3. of June 1979. The papers published in these proceedings are all dedicated to Professor Hasenjaeger. Since the meeting took place some of the papers have been revised and extended. All of the contributors to this volume are former students or co-workers of Professor Hasenjaeger.
