After their debut album Pablo Honey, Radiohead returned in 1995 with the highly-anticipated The Bends. I truly believe that if it wasn't for their sophomore album, Radiohead could quite easily have slipped off into obscurity to join a long line of other bands who were so promising. However, that didn't happen because the world caught onto The Bends and rightly hailed it as one of the best albums of the 90s. I don't consider this Radiohead's best album. Nor do I consider it a monumental masterpiece. It is a great rock album though.
