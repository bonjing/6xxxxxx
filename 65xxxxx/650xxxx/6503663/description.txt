Programming Sudoku by Wei-Meng Lee

Programming Sudoku provides you with great approaches to building and solving Sudoku
puzzles. Using logical deduction and analysis, youâ€™ll learn how to get a computer to solve these puzzles for you. You will learn the various techniques that you can deploy to solve a puzzle, ranging from basic techniques such as Column, Row, and Minigrid Elimination, to the more advanced triplets identification technique. And if all logical techniques fail, bruteforce elimination will kick into action and solve the puzzle by making some educated guesses. In addition to solving Sudoku puzzles, you will also learn the techniques for programmatically generating Sudoku puzzles of varying levels of difficulty.
