,vilham11,2011-07-07T01:59Z,"@Bennemann

Ohh, so I will just extract them all to a folder on my desktop or something, and it will put them all into the right folder ect, then I just need to install? Ohh jeez thanks so much, makes so much more sense now:)"

,asmojuice,2011-07-15T11:03Z,"is the whole game? or do i need to download something first before installing this?

guys, not everyone is a genius..."
,Fenr1r,2011-07-18T19:14Z,"Worked for me in Win7 (64-bit)

What I did was:
1. Install from the SKIDROW ISO.
2. Install the three additional components at the end of game install.
3. Copy-paste ALL cracks from ISO to game directory.
[checked if the game worked and it worked]
4. Run the Update.
5. Copy-paste the cracked files again from the update's crack folder [except steamclient.dll] to the game directory.
And it worked like a charm.

Thank you uploader for sharing! :)"
,OrrsomeJake,2011-07-31T16:21Z,"i did exactly what you said to make it work tried again and again even watched a video how to do it and it dident work,
i really want this game so ill try a lower update or something  "

,sdnl1j2,2011-09-05T06:16Z,"for anyone that having ''Magicka has stopped working'' error message upon starting to fix this you will need to download and install Microsoft XNA Framework Redistributable 

here: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=15163


also make sure you have the latest directx version if you don't have it download from here:

,MatressGiant,2011-09-20T01:52Z,"So ya, this is a terrible torrent that is missing MANY files. Yes, you can download them from ftp://84.22.139.7/GAMES_3/Magicka/* but seriously..."
,MatressGiant,2011-09-20T02:07Z,"I think it's adorable that my last comment got removed. In order to make this special little torrent work, you will have to go to ftp://84.22.139.7/GAMES_3/Magicka/Content/Levels/ and copy every file that you don't have to your corresponding folder. We're talking over 20 files I've had to DL so far. This torrent should really be removed/replaced."
,MatressGiant,2011-09-20T20:49Z,"Final comment on this torrent, I promise. I finally got this POS to work. What you have to do is load up Filezilla, go to the ftp listed, and copy the entire Magicka folder to the directory your game is located. Make sure to tell it to skip files you already have, not overwrite, etc."
,Momen92,2011-09-24T05:27Z,"I wrote a poem on how many problems i had ..
i got all problems in the book .
and tried everything ,, then i realized, umm this isn't the full game. 
so i downloaded the full game ..
had the same problems .. then i realized after installing the first game it wasn't installing the three things that i checked it was only installing the directx and the framework.. so maybe thats the problem ?"

,moizem,2011-11-19T07:31Z,@SKIDROW why do u have to put it in rars? 
,sun83kim,2011-12-04T05:35Z,"Works perfectly

For the dumbasses out there, this is NOT THE FULL GAME but an update to the full game. 

Its obvious to most but there are few dumbasses when I read the posts above.

I have Windows XP sp3, E8500 with GeForce 9500GT and it runs smooth.

I downloaded skidrow release of the game here

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6127579/Magicka-SKIDROW

then downloaded this update 24 and both worked flawlessly.

No problem at all."
,IGreyKnightI,2011-12-21T23:31Z,Online? Yes? No?
,ez100,2012-01-02T14:07Z,HOW THE FUCK DO U PLAY THIS ON LINE? I HAVE GOOGLED MY ASS OFF NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW
,The1Gambler,2012-01-29T17:20Z,"Since i cba to get anything through steam i couldnt play this game lan or online.
After a bit of googling i finally got it to work.

Wat u need:
Magicka - Skidrow
Magicka - Skidrow update 24
Smartsteam -(a real bitch to find the true file is 40mb plus)
Steam - (make a new account so ur real one doesnt get banned)
Tunngle - Similar to Hamachi but only program i got it to word with.

How to put this all together:
1: Install Steam (real one)
2: Install Magicka skidrow into your steam folder (:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Magicka  is the usual path) DO NOT COPY THE CRACK
3: Run the skidrow update 24 [DO NOT COPY THE CRACK]
4: Install Tunngle and get a account
5: Copy the smartsteam files into your steam folder (overwrite when prompted). [im not sure if normal steam still works then!!!! so carefull]

Now your all set to play!.
1: Start Tunngle and go to the magicka network
[Search networks for magicka and dubbel klik]
2: Start Smartsteam (make sure normal steam isnt running)
3: Launch magicka from the steam window.
(Klik play when it whines about watever and Ignore when windows whines).
4: Host a game with play online And let your friends join.
4.1: Join a game with online play. Klik the button join IP.
You use the ip from tunngle. its bottem left in your tunggle window.  [7.**.**.*** Somthing] similar.

Now you can play :).
Though smartsteam is a real bitch to find.
Version 1.4.x "
,Spinfx,2012-04-06T06:01Z,"While this works great (in combination with the Skidrow release), there's apparently a ""large tech update"" which supposedly came out in November. That's like 5 months ago. Would be nice to have it..."
