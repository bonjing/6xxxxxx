Shallow Foundations: Bearing Capacity and Settlement 2nd Edition by Braja M. Das
Product Description
Considered the standard engineering reference on shallow foundations, this edition strengthens that position. Completely reworked and written by one of the top men in the field, it covers all the latest developments and approaches. Equally valuable to researchers and designers as it is to engineering students, this resource updates data and provides revised theories on the ultimate and allowable bearing capacities of shallow foundations. It adds refinements to a number of unique circumstances such as foundations on soil with geogrid reinforcement as well as bearing capacity relationships for shallow foundations subjected to eccentric and inclined loads. It also covers advances in reinforcement materials.
