,wulwa,2011-08-04T07:42Z,"I downloaded it in six hours and deleted the complete bunch in next five minutes till I realized that dubbing in English is so misleading and didnt have the choice to change the audio to original swede, not that I understand Swedish well but that ways English subs would not be difficult to read, which are not as pathetic as some idiot American speaking weird. That stupid American style of English dubbing majorly spoiled the whole feel and hence I deleted the entire 12.9 fucking GB in five minutes with no hesitation. I'm sure many would get pissed by my comment, specially those who hate reading subtitles (in other words some American idiots), so balls to them, who the fuck cares if they see my point or not. I just wanted to see these movies and I'll download those with the authentic vocals. NOT THIS DUMBASS 'American' DUB.

No grudges against TvTeam or the original poster (whoever they are). I appreciate the effort. But guys you could have bothered to add Swedish audio along."

,fillinthisspace,2012-01-02T04:23Z,"I wonder how having an English audio track is misleading? ""English [DUBB]"" is specified for each one and it's also in the torrent title. No other language for an audio track is listed."
,.Leto.,2012-03-04T03:04Z,"too bad, I would have downloaded this if it was the original swedish version.
really dumb thing to do btw, a second audio track woudn't have taken that much space."
