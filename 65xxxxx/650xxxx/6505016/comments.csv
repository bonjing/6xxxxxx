The NFO states that you got to have that! all tough I never see that it logs in as other games does."
,babakratni,2011-06-30T16:26Z,Ok have to tell you street fighter is way easier to play on a keyboard rather than a controller.most of the ultra combos are down right down right either F or V.in between you will be hitting super moves also.Need more detail just tell me i will comment once more.
,um4d,2011-06-30T17:09Z,"wow, Yun is overpowered :(

this game needs some serious update ... to much rushed to let it out as it is to slow even in menu moving"
,lontrus,2011-06-30T18:20Z,"to slow game in menu and crashes after first loading to the game

,CptGio,2011-06-30T19:35Z,"My anti-virus is not the issue, it doesn't see neither of the files as a threat. It could be the crack. Since most release teams are always in a hurry to release games before the rest, they might have missed something."
,hickups,2011-06-30T19:42Z,something is clearly wrong with the crack or the game itself as it seems to only accept input if a recognised peripheral such as a controller or gamepad is attached hopefully there will be a fix for it soon such a let down really
,ai2006,2011-06-30T19:43Z,"The sad truth right now is that this runs a lot worse than SF4 on a weak computer, the keyboard issue is big, too.

Apart from that, there's something really wrong with the crack. When I play the game with the nerfed cast using the normal exe, the game runs butter smooth and it seems the GFWL layer opens up aswell. When I use the cracked files, it's unplayable all of a sudden with the game running terrible while the benchmarks still states my fps is over a 100."

,shippoukitsune,2011-07-01T19:02Z,"I seem to have some disturbing news for the keyboard issue problem. Right now I have 2 desktop and 2 laptops with me and I've been trying everything. The conclusion is, only certain keyboards could be used when playing this damn game. So far, I've tested with a Razer keyboard and it works perfectly. When used with Logitech G110 keyboard it's not responsive at all. Neither my default dell/asus keyboards from my laptop works either. How do I confirm it's certain keyboard that works? The answer is simple. I plugged out my razer from the desktop, attach it to my Dell laptop, start SSF4 and as expected, the game works by using the razer keyboard. While playing half way, I tried to use my default laptop keyboards and it's still not responsive at all. Something weird is going on with the game as this is not Skidrow's fault. Even when playing without crack, the keyboard input problem it's still there. Hope my investigation helps some of you out there :)"

Connect your controller before launch game; Go to OPTIONS in game, press Enter on keyboard. Highlight BUTTON CONFIG and press Enter. In BUTTON CONFIG you should see the controls and it should say KEYBOARD 1 at the top. Press the Left or Right Keys on the keyboard to see available devices; you should see KEYBOARD 2 at the top and hopefully USB Gamepad. Use the Up and Down keys on the keyboard to highlight an action then press Enter. It will prompt you to press the Key/Button you want; for example if you press Enter on UP/UP then press up on your PS2 Gamepad, you should see Y Axis Up replace NONE. 
If this does not help then you should try Control Panel to see if your PC recognise your gamepad. I use Windows 7 so when I go Devices and Printers I see USB Gamepad."

I'm also using PS2 Gamepad with USB converter), but i'm experiencing many problems. At first the game pad wouldn't work at all, contrary to the previous Street Fighter IV, where it worked perfectly. Then I tryed using my xbox 360 controller emlator, which works perfectly for Resident Evil 5 and many other games. What happens now is the strangest shit: the game pad works perfectly in versus and training mode, but when I get to arcade mode, every time I press start to pause the game, the game understands that this start button was pressed on a 2nd controller, therefore taking me to the character select screen and prompting me to select a character for me to fight myself. After that I got the ""Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition Keyboard Hotfix.rar"" but I just didn't understand how to use it. Would you help me please? Thanks in advance."

I had just written a big comment explaining thoroughly my problems with my PS2 Gamepad (using PS2 to USB converter), but somehow it got erased. My gamepad has worked with the previous Street Fighter IV but isn't working with this one. Then I used a xbox 360 controller emulator which has worked perfectly in many other games. But in the case of this one, it only works in versus and training mode. When I play arcade mode and try to pause the game with the start button, it understands that the start was pressed on a 2nd contrller and takes me to the select character screen again. I didn't understand how to use the hotfix, am I supposed to use it with any other files? Should I just unrar them in the game directory? Thanks in advance"
,CptGio,2011-07-03T00:58Z,"@direbane

I presume you are using xinput or some other xbox360 game-pad emulator. I had the same problem you had, in order to ""cleanse"" the game form your non emulated game-pad settings (not the xinput), you have to uninstall the game completely only leaving the xinput files on the games directory. Then reinstall the game, apply the crack as usual and it should stop recognizing your emulated game-pad as player 1 & 2 simultaneously. 
It worked like a charm for me."
,CptGio,2011-07-03T01:04Z,"@direbane

By the way, you dont need the ""hotfix"". You´re better off configuring your own game pad with ""x360ce.exe"" contained in a file called ""Xinputemu 3.1.rar""(which can be downloaded from ze internetz).  Make sure you unpack ""Xinputemu 3.1.rar"" into the games directory, make configure your game-pad and you´re set. You won't even need a keyboard after it's done. "
,direbane,2011-07-03T01:22Z,"@Cptgio 
OK, I'll try that right now and come back with the results"
,CptGio,2011-07-03T01:52Z,"@direbane

Hmm, I figured that the game will work on versus, challenge and training modes. FYI Im playing with my Hori Wireless Fighting Stick 3.
But then all the sudden it fucks up on arcade mode. At the beginning the POV stick didn't work though the buttons did. 
Plus it reacted on my start button as a second player entering the fight. Then after the fix my character doesn't move and the only thing working is the start button that calls in for player 2. 
So my theory is still a major FLOP. 
Now on the other hand, I can play the game with no issues whatsoever with my wired Soulcalibur II arcade stick. 
I hope you got it working or at least learned something useful out of my posts."
,direbane,2011-07-03T02:21Z,"@Cptgio 
The 2nd instalation was to no avail, the controls were still messed up. And on top of that, it raised another issue: full screen won't work, would you know how to fix it ?.
Strange thing is: when I first installed the game yesterday, the install menu was in English. Today the menu was a little different, with the nvidia logo and in Portuguese. I'm supposed to install the game from setup.exe or game.exe ?

I'll try a 3rd instalation.

POST BY FREQMAN

Unzip that file and copy those two files into the game folder - not the USER folder.

Then, edit the x360kb.ini file to read like this:

[Options]
UseInitBeep=1
Log=0
BackgroundMode=1
PadCount=1

[PAD1]
A=Z
B=X
X=A
Y=S
Left Shoulder=F
Left Trigger=V
Right Shoulder=D
Right Trigger=C
D-Pad Up=Up
D-Pad Down=Down
D-Pad Left=Left
D-Pad Right=Right
Start=O
Back=P

O and P and Z and X are the most important keys to navigate menus and dialogs.

I flipped the original file values so that all the PUNCH commands are on the same row:

A S D F

and all the KICK commands are on the same row of the keyboard as well:

Z X C V

Z and X serve double duty.  One function in the game play and another in the menus.

That did it for me.  Best of luck."

Install the game from the setup.exe just to be on the safe side. Also make sure to have removed all the crap from the capcom folder inside the documents folder before you reinstall it. You probably have noticed that you can choose the language of the game in the setup menu.

tried wireless keyboard as well as my old ps2 keyboard but no joy :-((( "
,markkamphorst,2011-07-03T12:35Z,"i got 1 gamepad or player working (my Logitich Rumblepad 2) but is there a way to play with 2 players or gamepad? Maybe by changing that x360kb keyboard fix?

I want to kick my brothers assss... :p

apart from that the game runs perfect now."
,markkamphorst,2011-07-03T12:44Z,Is there a way to play this game with 2 players with the same keyboard? Now only player 1 is recognized with the keyboard fix...
,direbane,2011-07-03T14:01Z,"@CptGio

Sure, during my 3rd instalation I proceeded just like you mentioned above. Arcade mode is still not working, but if I REALLY want to play it, I can just plug my x 360 controller. I've tested it and I know it works fine, I just don't like it for fighting games. Next week I'll try new things with my legitimate copy. I'll also try to get ahold of a wired arcade stick.

,matelian,2011-07-03T20:17Z,"PERFECT !!

first off the game ran like CRAP on default settings, but some one said to turn of Vsync and make frame rate fixed. this option did help a bit the game started to feel fast but not that smooth even i was doing an average of 149 fps in the benchmark.
but what i did to make it very very smooth with ZERO slow downs is to make vsync off and make the fps fixed and FORCE vsync on from the Nvidia control panel, and here we are 69 fps with very smooth and fast game play of glorious SSFIV:AE :D  "

Anyway just in case someone didn't know this, actually there's an update made by Skidrow it's called:

Super.Street.Fighter.IV.Arcade.Edition.Update.1-SKIDROW (about 130++ MB)

With that new update you don't need to use crack anymore (despite it's included) because the new update allows you to use all characters from the start (see capcom website for the complete changelog). All you have to do is just create an offline profile and make sure to block it from accessing the net or else you will be asked to insert the CD KEY

As a side note, there's also a costume switcher tool to switch all chars into their alternate costumes (you can do this manually, or with a help from that tool) :)"

Not having any troubles so far, though at the start i had some problems in regards to the keyboard not working, but i fixed it by downloading a patch for it from another torrent.

4: go to program files and find the ""capcom"" folder the game is in there
5: open the Skidrow folder that you got from winrar and open it
6: cut everything in it and past it in the Street fighter IV folder it will ask you if you want to overwrite or replace do that
