This book is a systematical introduction to the development of simulation models and the implementation and evaluation of simulation experiments with Plant Simulation. "Manufacturing Simulation with Plant Simulation and SimTalk" is aimed at all users of Plant Simulation looking for an easy entry into the program. A particular focus is on the introduction into the simulation flow language SimTalk and its use in various areas of the simulation. In over 100 examples the author shows, how the modules for simulation models combined, and how to deal with SimTalk complex control and analysis tasks. The contents of the book ranges from the description of the basic functions of the material flow components to demanding topics such as the realization of a database connection using the ODBC interface or the exchange of data with Microsoft Excel on DDE.
