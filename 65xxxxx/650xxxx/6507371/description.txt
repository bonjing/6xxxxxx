                           DESCRiPTiON 

 In the concluding part of the documentary, former soldier Ed Stafford and 
 his Peruvian pal Cho have reached Tabatinga, near where the borders of Peru,
 Brazil and Colombia meet. As they head due east toward Manaus, the state 
 capital of Amazonas, they battle bugs, caimans, dehydration and mental 
 fatigue - and a wrong turn proves costly while trying to make it to the 
 river mouth.
                                             
                                 Enjoy!
