Pretty Little Liars  S02E03

My Name Is Trouble

As Aria, Emily, Hanna and Spencer try to keep their distance from each other, each girl looks to distractions to help fulfill the "separate time" request from their parents. Aria channels her inner artist and signs up for a pottery class at Hollis College. Not only does the class qualify as "separate time," but it also gives her an excuse to see Ezra on campus, so there are benefits on both sides -- that is until she finds out Jenna is also taking the class. Emily stays focused on her swimming career and how that could help her stay in Rosewood. When she doesn't get the solid commitment from Danby University, Emily comes up with a way to fudge things to convince her mom to stay. Feeling like the only one who doesn't have a hobby, Hanna turns to Lucas to see if she can join the yearbook staff to fill her time. But with Lucas still hurting from their last encounter, Hanna's new hobby might be trying to make amends. Meanwhile, Spencer notches up her suspicions about what is going on in the DiLaurentis house now that Jason has moved back in. And with Melissa sneaking around and getting mysterious text messages, Spencer wonders what her sister has to do with what is going on next door.
