      British artist and cultural historian David Ellis first came   
      to Lithuania almost twenty years ago. Driven by a curiosity    
      about post-Soviet culture, he has continued to visit           
      frequently over the years. In this film, Ellis travels         
      through Lithuania's towns, meeting people and discussing how   
       twenty years of independence reflect on their lives.
