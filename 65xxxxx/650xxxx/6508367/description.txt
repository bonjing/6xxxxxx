TROUBLESHOOT
If you are having trouble installing a patch (eg. Blizzard Updater won't launch or open), open the Terminal and type the following commands (ENTER/RETURN after every line):

cd path/to/wowpatchesfolder/
find . -type d -exec chmod 777 {} \;
find . -type f -exec chmod 777 {} \;

Now try install again, this should work. 

Please help to seed.

Hope you enjoy! :)
