,stalker2755,2011-07-05T19:09Z,"The subs are incomplete. Any idx must be accompanied by a sub file. The idx is just a time stamp to file pointer and the sub has the actual bitmaps that make up the subtitle.

Thank you, TvTeam! F'ing lamers. Either post shit properly or don't post at all!"
,Parad0x1,2011-07-05T22:46Z,Anyone know where I can find decent English subtitles for this?
