[T],murdoc47,2011-07-03T09:12Z,adjust your settings in the front speaker. it sounds fine on my end. or just scroll up :D
,jeffdmg,2011-07-15T23:21Z,"Not work for me, I tested the VLC, MPC and DivX player, the Mac and the PC did not work. When I started I could watch the download finished but when I could not open the file. "
[T],murdoc47,2011-07-16T09:16Z,"needs matroska pack maybe? i don't know, maybe your pc is slow. remember, this is 1080p. i won't know until you provide some detailed info. what does it do when you open the file?"
,jeffdmg,2011-07-17T14:55Z,"When I open the vlc the window is only open and is no picture and no sound, and time is at 0:00, I think the file is not an issue I think is perhaps the bittorent software (Transmission) that I should use that have corrupted the file, I'll download it again. Thnx for the upload!"

,yacovm888,2012-01-02T23:32Z,movie does not move stays still both in windows media and DivX Plus Player any suggestions?
,yacovm888,2012-01-02T23:36Z,"maybe cause i don;t have 1920x800, 1080p fullHD?"
,yacovm888,2012-01-02T23:38Z,maybe cause i don't have Inception 1080p FullHD
[T],murdoc47,2012-01-03T11:42Z,"maybe your processor is not strong enough to decode such a big bitrate. i tried it on smaller screens and fullhd works, if the processor is dual core or better. try installing codecs, or simply try VLC player. if none of these work, the problem is with your PC. waiting to hear back. thanks!"
