[T],insinuendo,2011-07-03T18:59Z,Most people who can afford a TB at 50 bucks.
,DailyBoost,2011-07-12T19:34Z,"Dude, you're amazing! Excellent audio and video quality. Huge file, but that doesn't bother me now I know there is almost no quality loss.."
[T],insinuendo,2011-07-12T22:00Z,"There is NO loss of quality with Remuxes.

It's basically the original blu-ray video and HD audio joined together in a .mkv container.

You're welcome."

Still looks better though, which is making me torn over whether or not I should download it. Movies like this really get my geek juices flowing. Such stellar animation!

I'm currently on a 37inch 1080p Samsung LCD, using Zoomplayer, Reclock, and sharpness enhancements using the Nvidia control panel and also the edge enhancement in the LCD itself. For what it's worth, people who don't use enhancements like these, I highly doubt they will see any difference whatsoever."
