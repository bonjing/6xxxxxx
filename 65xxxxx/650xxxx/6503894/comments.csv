,salpern,2011-09-27T18:01Z,Installed and got message that it expires in two days!  Now what?
,AlienHand,2011-10-01T12:15Z,Expires on 30th September 2011. Need new key or crack. Anyone?
,dudsy,2011-10-02T02:12Z,"Yeah i have the same problem. Cant even install older version cause its hiding my registration details somewhere in the registry, not under firetrust or mailwasher. Anyone know where it would be?"
,salpern,2011-10-02T19:21Z,"The keys are [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Firetrust\MailWasherPro]

""w5m""=""5gOOYFCKIm+d8cn9Db/HvvEFGtoFb/fvU02stRnML+7p1lm+URgo+MNgUJlLwz4vGEb+WPS5aR4Qy/hInCUIzA==""

 and [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Firetrust\MailWasherPro]

""w5m""=""5gOOYFCKIm+d8cn9Db/HvvEFGtoFb/fvU02stRnML+7p1lm+URgo+MNgUJlLwz4vGEb+WPS5aR4Qy/hInCUIzA==""
Be careful not to delete the Wow6432N folder!"
,AlienHand,2011-10-03T23:01Z,@ salpern: What to do with your info? This just removes the key from reg. Not fix Mailwasher (or did I miss something here?)
,dudsy,2011-10-04T12:32Z,Wouldn't a registry search find those entries? Anyway it seems to working now after i blocked web access to mailwasherpro app
,AlienHand,2011-10-04T17:03Z,@dudsy: Haha .. you are absolutely right. I blocked 2 x mailwasherpro app in my firewall - and now it works !! .. LOL
,Lasaruz,2011-10-21T12:01Z,Thank You!
,jrnojuan,2012-03-23T16:57Z,"Works great, but I don't speak Pirate:(
