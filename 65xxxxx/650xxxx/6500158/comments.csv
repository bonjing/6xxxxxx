,press2010,2011-06-28T17:36Z,Thanks for Ally Walker. Will you continue to seed this for at least a few days. TIA.
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-06-28T20:45Z,"@press2010: Not a problem as I seed most of my torrents for several months at least, just not at full B/W after a seed ratio of 10:1. Requests are always welcome, as I have a huge collection of interviews from most of the BIG name talk shows, including the musical performances and MP3's also. "
,press2010,2011-06-28T23:15Z,Thanks. The reason I asked was that at the time I wrote this there were only two seeders and now there appears to be only one. I guess not everyone is crushing on Miss Walker like I am : )
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-06-28T23:55Z,That's why I posted it. Loved her in the Profiler.
