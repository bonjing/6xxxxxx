,gtiger5,2011-06-30T18:13Z,"@kinhmike
No 7 and 8 are not together. The second half of 7 is the atlanta auditions from week 4."
,cassy1998,2011-06-30T19:46Z,"Episode 8 hasn't been released yet by any scene group (check at orlydb). Americans can view the episode on hulu and other sites. Maybe a non scene group will post a webrip or else we'll have to wait for one of the scene groups like FQM, 2HD etc to get it released (probably within the next 24 or 48 hours)."
,tigersgym,2011-06-30T19:56Z,"guys its just the sample avi thats incomplete , the actual episode inside the folder is done 100% , go ahead and watch the show even if the torrent client say 99%"
