,irrad,2011-06-30T02:52Z,"Wow, this movie is the definition of crap. Porn actors have more talent, better scripts and classier effects! 
This comes close to porn though, except without the sex, which is the only reason for watching porn. 
Points for creativity though, using stok footage for everything except dialouge is pure brilliance."

The cover of this (and probably also the story but I haven't seen the movie) is an obvious ripoff of The Day After Tomorrow.
