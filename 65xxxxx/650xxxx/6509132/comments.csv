,tajnost,2011-08-03T09:21Z,WARNING this is not version 1.2.1 as described in torrent info. I followed your silly instructions downloading the latest demo and everything and i end up with the old version .. i hate this false advertising !
,EdmAddict,2011-09-09T09:01Z,What version is it then?
,whynow1,2011-12-11T09:05Z,"This was a great torrent, easy to follow instructions, and best of all, it works like a charm (so far at least). one thing was that when i typed in the second thing he has you type in, it said it wasnt there, but i just went to it manually and it was fine, so be aware of that."
