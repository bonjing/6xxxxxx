In geometrical optics, light propagation is analyzed in terms of light rays which define the path of propagation of light energy in the limit of the optical wavelength tending to zero. All of geometric optics can be derived from Fermat's principle which is an extremum principle. The counterpart in classical mechanics is of course Hamilton's principle. There is a very close analogy between mechanics of particles and optics of light rays.
