During installation it gives an error refering to missing disc-link. Pressing ignore completes the installation, but when trying to run the actual game it gives the same message again - ""disc cannot be found"". Have used both original and cracked file.

I have not tried burning it on a disc, but rather used disc-mounters. Maybe it works if its burned. "
