Also gotta agree with the other comment on the stupidity of torrenting a bunch of rar files, especially on such a small video upload."

It's completely unnecessary! If you don't understand it already: The file is already as compressed as it can get and the torrent technology already makes sure to split the download into way smaller parts and from a lot of people, hence the name ""Torrent""."
