You should use ""quality"" encoding mode which will create variable bitrate for the video. 1st pass will not be needed. Audio to AAC or AC3 at 640kbps would be fine. 

The whole point here is we're not trying to sacrifice too much quality for the smallest file size possible. So 1080p and 720p should be about 5GB and 3GB respectively. The audio will come out about 500MB with 5.1 channel. DTS would be about 1.5GB and nobody can tell the different anyway. So stick with AAC or AC3. You'll be looking splendid with those settings above. Good luck."
