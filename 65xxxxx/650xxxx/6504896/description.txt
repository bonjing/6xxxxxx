 Exploring how some of the world's most famous hotels, including the Savoy,
 the Ritz and the Dorchester, became internationally renowned as the epitome of
 luxurious living, and the ways in which they have adapted to the needs of new
 generations of wealthy clients. The film examines the origins of the prestigious
 establishments, and offers an insight into the methods they employ to live up to
 the standards of the most exacting customers. Narrated by Fenella Fielding.
