This book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Theorem Proving in Higher Order Logics, TPHOLs '97, held in Murray Hill, NJ, USA, in August 1997. The volume presents 19 carefully revised full papers selected from 32 submissions during a thorough reviewing process. The papers cover work related to all aspects of theorem proving in higher order logics, particularly based on secure mechanization of those logics; the theorem proving systems addressed include Coq, HOL, Isabelle, LEGO, and PVS.
