1971 - Stormcock

If you like Progressive Folk (esp. Jethro Tull) you shouldn't miss this album. Released in 1971 it obviously has been a big inspiration for Ian Anderson resp. Tull's "Thick as a Brick" that came out one year later. Roy Harper has earned great reputation among rock bands like Led Zeppelin ("Hats Off to Roy Harper") or Pink Floyd who let him do the lead vocals on "Have a Cigar".
