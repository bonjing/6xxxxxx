""I've been working on these songs for a while, the first intent was to compile 
enough to make an album. Life happens and instead I decided to release it as 
a mix-tape. There are a few songs already on the internet anyway, so I figure 
I'd just release the full thing. Hope y'all enjoy the music""...
