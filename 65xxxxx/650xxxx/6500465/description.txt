This a compressed version of DVD 1 of the following permaculture design course on tpb. Thank you very much to the original uploader. 

if others could compress a dvd each then we could make the whole course available in a much more compact form.

i strongly endorse his comments 
i.e. \"You can buy the original DVD series on: www.tagari.com
Please consider doing this since you will be supporting permaculture with it. If you cant afford it then please see if you can somehow otherwise contribute in time or money to permaculture initiatives. Or start a permaculture initiative in your area. \"\"

This video is compressed from 4gb to 620mb.  i would welcome any suggestions for improvement.  this is first time i have compressed anything.  the settings i used were  xvid 326 kbps and 23.976 fps for video and mp3 48 kbps for audio with volumescale boosted to 9.

this was done in linux using dvdrip ( it is also possible to do it with transmageddon or arista). on windows, i understand video transcoding software includes virtualdub or super..

this includes only titles 1-3 since there was a problem compressing 4-6. however the omitted titles are tiny and contain no substantive farming information.
