Do you have any kind of subtitles for this? I would like to translate the series into spanish but it's really a lot of work and having the timings would be great!"

,nvcupload,2011-12-26T20:12Z,"There seems to be a compressed version of the whole set, a little over 7 gigs total. I haven't watched all the videos, but the quality is good enough for me, and it looks like everything is there...

It's not on TPB, but you can do a general internet search for ""Permaculture Design Certificate Course torrent"" to find it. Maybe someone could repost the torrent on TPB? "
