Plot:
Director Na Hong-jin (The Chaser) teams up again with award-winning actors Kim Yun-seok and Ha Jung-woo for his ambitious sophomore feature, which brings the grim action all the way from Yanbian, the Korean-populated region in Northeast China bordering North Korea, to Seoul and Busan. "The Yellow Sea" packs a hard punch with its thrilling car chases and gritty violence, but it's above all the powerful performances of the two leading actors that make the film a compelling and exhilarating watch. Ha won Best Actor at the 5th Asian Film Awards for his turn as a desperate man on the run in a foreign land.

Gu-nam (Ha), a taxi driver in Yanbian, is knee deep in gambling debt, and he hasn't heard from his wife since she left for South Korea half a year ago. To clear his debt and find his wife, he reluctantly takes a job to assassinate a businessman in South Korea. When the hit job goes wrong, Gu-nam suddenly finds himself the target of the police, the mafia, and the very man who hired him, brutal assassin Myun-ga (Kim).
