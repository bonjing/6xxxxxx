V-Ray 2.00.03 2012 32 bit added by request.

I havent tried the 32 bit version can someone confirm that is working please....

Same old rant I'm the unique seeder so please seed to get this up and running.

I assume Copy & paste vray2012.dlll & cgauth.dll into your 3ds Max root directory e.g.C:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max 2012 (or where ever you have it installed)
Copy & paste cgauth.dll into C:\Program Files\Chaos Group\V-Ray\RT\bin

You guys can help each other with this one if my instructions dont work, I'm not installing the 32 bit version to see where you went wrong.... otherwise enjoy.
