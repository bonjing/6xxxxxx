Recently announced as the #1 church songwriter (CCLI), Worship Leader/Songwriter Paul Baloche is a driving force in todayâ€™s worship movement. â€œRather than viewing my songwriting as a private conversation between me and God,â€ Paul says, â€œI began writing based on the needs that I saw around me. After four years of leading worship (in my home church), I feel like it has helped ground me in reality, something that only comes when youâ€™re plugged into a local body. I need to be asking, â€˜Where are we as a fellowship? What should we be asking God? Because one of my jobs as a worship pastor is to put words in the mouths of the people I serve â€“ words that are pleasing to God and that help them connect their hearts to His.â€ This is how Paulâ€™s latest worship album came to life.

With his new release, Offering of Worship, Paul Baloche has reached new heights in worship. Recorded live at Regent University â€œI decided that we needed songs that talk about bringing as much of yourself as you can to God in worship,â€ Paul says, â€œwe need to come to him with an offering â€“ and do it honestly.â€
