,bugmeless,2011-07-07T22:23Z,"I remember around 5 years ago there were two DCP packs each week, one with the early scans and one at the weekend to catch everything else.  I expect these guys are now simply waiting until Wednesday to catch the entire week in one go.  Good job too given they regularly weigh in at 3GB+ (I remember when the two packs were 300+600MB).

I too am worried that this week's pack is now 36 hours overdue.  I do hope nothing bad has happened to the shipmates."
