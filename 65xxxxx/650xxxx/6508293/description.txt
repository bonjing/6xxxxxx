Mediafour XPlay 3.5.4

XPlay expands what you can do with any iPod, including the iPhone and touch, and a Windows computer. From copying music off your iPod to copying photos on, XPlay fills in the holes giving you more power to manage your music, photos and more.

XPlay 3 has always given you direct access to your iPod, meaning when you plug in your iPod it is listed as a drive on your system. Now that power is added for iPhone and iPod touch users. There is no application, no middle man to get in the way. Simply click on your iPod and start organizing.

XPlay also believes in cross-platform harmony. XPlay includes MacDrive technology enabling you to use both Mac and Windows formatted iPods with any XP or Vista computer. You also get management options. While XPlay is the perfect complement to iTunes, XPlay also makes it possible to use your iPod with Windows Media Player or Vista Media Center.

XPlay 2 is packed full of new features that makes using your iPod with Windows even better. And with the powerful XPlay drag-and-drop interface, you'll be transferring music to and from the iPod quicker and easier than ever.

Not only is XPlay 2 much faster than the original XPlay, it has improved support for international characters, displays album art, supports play counts, and has a greatly-enhanced interface under Windows XP. XPlay 2 also adds compatibility with Audible files, AAC files, and even automatic WMA-to-MP3 conversion (requires any Windows Media Player-compatible MP3 creation pack).
