Sid Meier's Civilization

Civilization is a turn-based single-player strategy game. The player takes on the role of the ruler of a civilization, starting with only one settler unit, and attempts to build an empire in competition with between two and six other civilizations.

This is the 1991 game that started it all. Still one of the greatest games of all time. As simple as it is it is still addicting.
