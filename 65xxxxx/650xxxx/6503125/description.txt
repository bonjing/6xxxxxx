Need for Speed: Most Wanted (commonly abbreviated to as NFS: MW) is a racing video game, developed by EA Black Box game's street racing-oriented game play, with certain (but not all) customization options from the Need for Speed: Underground series. The game is succeeded by Need for Speed: Carbon, which serves as a sequel to Most Wanted, and later Need for Speed: World, which features both the cities of Rockport and Palmont, making that game a successor to both Most Wanted and Carbon. Most Wanted was a commercial success; it sold nearly 6 million copies worldwide.
