,KP1990,2011-07-03T05:53Z,"Looks pretty good for a cam rip and the sound isn't awful but about an hour in it suddenly jumps ahead about 10 minutes at a really good part. So....where is that 10 minutes? :( Also doesn't appear to be long enough, the movie is about 2.5 hours, this is only 2 hrs 10 minutes."
