,Crunox,2011-06-29T18:45Z,There are lots of no lifers here. But I assure you the FTM exe in this torrent is real...
,wowwars,2011-06-29T19:05Z,Thanks the other torrents were protected by a password...
,wowwars,2011-06-29T19:09Z,I only used the FTM download not the rest i already dled the HOI3 Gold. just installed it in it and worked.
,Mars66,2011-06-29T19:27Z,"Another confirmation here. Also downloaded only the FTM file, cause I already have the rest. Cheers Mate"
,rob90991,2011-06-29T19:45Z,"Works great, well done.
Just make sure to have the Visual C++ 2010 (x86) installed even if you have a x64 system! otherwise you will get an error message."
,Crunox,2011-06-29T20:05Z,"You're righ rob90991, I forgot to mention that in the instructions."
,Pontaz9414,2011-06-29T21:04Z,"I have a little problem. I have HoI3 and SF installed, it works perfectly but when I install For the Motherland and i try to run the game, it crashes before the loading screen. I tried rebooting the computer, updating the DX running the game as administrator, but it always crashes. Any ideas how to fix it?"
,Crunox,2011-06-29T21:42Z,"You should reinstal hoi3+sf+FTM, because there is a problem with the map cache folder."
,Pontaz9414,2011-06-29T22:01Z,"I've already reinstalled the game about 5 times, I even tried installing HOI3 Gold first and installing For the Motherland there, but it still doesn't work"
,MichaelKnight_83,2011-06-30T01:02Z,Nice torrent. Download and now seed =)
,dampinack,2011-06-30T03:26Z,"Hello, Thanks a lot!, For running in Windows 7, just run as Administrator and that's all!"
,R4ptor,2011-06-30T09:54Z,"hi Crunox , thank you very much for this :)
for those who have problems with errors when launching a game. download Hearts of iron GOLD and install it , your problems are solved then :)"
,lecknas,2011-06-30T21:39Z,@Pontaz Download Ccleaner and run it to erase hidden files after you've uninstalled the games. Sometimes hidden files stay and don't get replaced with a reinstall. I had that problem with a Total War game which Ccleaner solved.

,fredrikomatt,2011-07-02T11:44Z,"I got a problem: when I try to start the game after installing Visual C++ 2010 (x86) and all the HoI 3-program files an error occur saying: it is impossible to start the program because the file D3dx9_40.dll is missing on the computer.

Any ideas?"
,Khalev,2011-07-02T19:34Z,"Thanks, working 100%"
,Pimpel332,2011-07-05T19:55Z,"For The Motherland doesn't work! I don't known why... first i have problems with .dll file, so i completed the missing files and starts... then no any messages, just crashes."
,Pontaz9414,2011-07-07T15:29Z,"Hi
I tried everything I could, but it's still not working. I might have an idea what's causing the problem. I looked into the map/cache/quad_textures folder and the quad_texture_24.dds file is missing. Could someone send it for me in an e-mail to pontazaza@citromail.hu ? I really appreciate the help thx"
,Weho2,2011-07-07T23:22Z,"thanks for uplaoding. i havent seen any dodgy shit fro mthis yet, all i downlaoed was the motherland"
,Pontaz9414,2011-07-12T22:24Z,"YES! I managed to fix it.... well kinda. If somebody has the same problem, I don't know what I did exactly, but it was something like this: install HOI3 SF with dies irae götterdamnerung, update it to 2.04 then install with FTM and when the patch comes out on july 15th, it should work. I can only run it with DiG, so I get a lot of weird errors what makes the game unplayable, but as I said, the new patch will make FTM and DiG compatible."
,godfathr123,2011-07-15T22:08Z,every time i try to run it i keep  getting the error message MSVCP100.dll can someone help?
,columbusbobby23,2011-07-19T13:02Z,"UF6 Is Right, I Had The Same Error Message After Installing Motherland, But After I installed Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package, It Started Right Up And Works Perfectly. Thanx UF6!!  :)"
,godfathr123,2011-07-20T22:13Z,every time i try the download UF6 recomends it says the server connection is reset....cmon all i want to do is play the f-ing game ='(
,okokrs,2011-07-25T09:51Z,"I'm trying to apply the latest official patch on FTM from this release. However, the patch installer doesn't recognise the game, and I'm guessing that's because this is the Steam version? 

So, I'm hoping that someone can put up the latest patch in some version compatible with this upload, or upload FTM in a non-steam version so that we can use the regular Paradox patch files."
,okokrs,2011-07-25T09:55Z,"Also, thanks a lot for this torrent! I own a lot of Paradox games, but because of their reputation for buggy releases, I sometimes prefer to try them out for free in their release state and buying them later if they get patched properly. I'd like to urge others to buy their games if you like them, since PI isn't a large developer but still support their games very well and communicate with gamers. You can often find older PI games at very good prices at www.gamersgate.com."
,fidels,2011-07-30T00:49Z,Great mate!  . . .worked after i installed the the redist c++ thing . . should have mentioned that in the instruction though 
,Crunox,2011-07-31T03:58Z,"@ fidels

yes I know. But I got knowledge about the problem after I posted the torrent.

Btw: I found a link to a forum where you can download the hoi3 and other paradox mods without registering on the paradox forum.

,BChedda,2012-05-13T23:39Z,"The download and install was fine, I'm just confused about the launcher. There's two of them in the install directory and they both open up HoI3:For the Motherland (at least that's what it says at the main menu). Does it merge the three games into HoI3:For the Motherland, or is there supposed to be launcher for each individual game."
,waging_war,2012-06-03T06:44Z,"Everything installed but when i launch the game it says, ""MSVCP100.dll"" What's up with that? "
