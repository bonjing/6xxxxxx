Constantine M. Dafermos, "Hyperbolic Conservation Laws in Continuum Physics"
Spr ger | 2009 | ISBN: 3642040470 | 710 pages | PDF | 4,4 MB

This is a masterly exposition and an encyclopedic presentation of the theory of hyperbolic conservation laws. It illustrates the essential role of continuum thermodynamics in providing motivation and direction for the development of the mathematical theory while also serving as the principal source of applications. The reader is expected to have a certain mathematical sophistication and to be familiar with (at least) the rudiments of analysis and the qualitative theory of partial differential equations, whereas prior exposure to continuum physics is not required.
New to the 3rd edition is an account of the early history of the subject, spanning the period between 1800 to 1957. Also new is a chapter recounting the recent solution of open problems of long standing in classical aerodynamics. Furthermore, the presentation of a number of topics in the previous edition has been revised and brought up to date, and the collection of applications has been substantially enriched. The bibliography, also expanded and updated, now comprises over fifteen hundred titles.
