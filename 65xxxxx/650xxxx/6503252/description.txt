Quote:
Vertigo's short-lived ongoing Horror anthology. Mean of comics top names have contributed to this series. Each issue traditionally contained three short stories that normally seemed unrelated outside the fact they were Horror themed.


Features all sorts of the sub-sets of horror including si-fi, supernatural and just plain human horror (including a rather disturbing fairy tail retelling of foot-binding).

Of course it features many bizarre things like the first issue published in 1999 mentions a gulf war 2. Who would have thought of that....*cough*.
