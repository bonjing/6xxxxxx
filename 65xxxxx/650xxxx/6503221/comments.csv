,PhreakU,2011-10-17T21:33Z,"How can you claim that these episodes are UNCENSORED ?

FYI for everyone: They are CENSORED for Comedy Central broadcasting. You will only find 'fully' UNCENSORED versions on a DVD release or possibly on a network without censorship.

For example: The words Ass, Shit & Crap are uncensored; while the word Fuck will always be 'bleeped'.  Like when Cartman wants his mom to fuck him in the BestBuy.

Therefor, this motherfucker is CENSORED."

You my friend are a fuckwit, please watch something before you decide to voice your shit knowledge on a subject. 

I'm about 9 minutes through the first episode and I've heard Cartman say ""fuck"" atleast 12 times."
,N3tw0rkbomb3r,2011-11-06T22:44Z,Just got done watching all the episodes. Definitely UNCENSORED! Cartman drops the eff bomb more times then I have ever heard just in the first episode alone. Lol. PhreakU is a dumb ass. Don't listen to him.
