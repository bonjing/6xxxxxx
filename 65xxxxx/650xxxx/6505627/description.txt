Synopsis: One day, a body turns up with a tarot card on him. He is the one who got off scot-free from a rape and murder charge due to lack of evidence. What's worse is that the footage of his murder is aired on the Internet. A serial killer, who punishes the powerful with the law in their favor, warns the police that he would continue his job of putting away those above the law. The police set up a special investigation team to catch this serial killer led by Chief Kim. Team members, Detective Bong, Detective Kang and Detective Pyo do everything to nail the killer. Although hot-blooded Detective Bong and cool-headed Detective Pyo can hardly join forces, they take one step at a time and get closer to the perpetrator. However, the killer watches their moves and acts ahead of them. Soon, the special team finds out that the killer is involved with the ring called Ilsim that brings those who evade the law to justice.
Whilst having murderers and rapists and general scum of society in this movie, I found this film brilliant and so funny in the form of kim won hee's crazy wardrobe and presence,Bit different from what i UL but this is entertaining shit,Not 2 be taken serious.
