,cassy1998,2011-06-30T19:48Z,"Episode 8 hasn't been released yet by any scene group (check at orlydb). Americans can view the episode on hulu and other sites. Maybe a non scene group will post a webrip or else we'll have to wait for one of the scene groups like FQM, 2HD etc to get it released (probably within the next 24 or 48 hours)."
