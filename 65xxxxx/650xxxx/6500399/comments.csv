,Galxra,2011-07-02T18:39Z,"If you kids are smart and absolutely want the 320kbps songs you copy each of the artists names and search after it on tbp till you find the 320kbps version.

Thanks torrentcentral for this epic music torrent!"

,BoMcM,2011-07-30T15:37Z,anyone who wants the continuous mix just create an .m3u file of the album it doesn't take up much space it is basically a playlist works great.
,gunnerzz,2011-08-04T18:24Z,These aren't the right songs... They are different to the ones listed.
,Duhya2,2011-08-09T06:06Z,"Good DL, though i don't like the non wub songs that much."

,faketpb9,2012-01-11T06:58Z,"this is the kind off dubstep i'd expect to hear in dutch elevators.
It had some cool tracks in it tho, but they where'nt really aggressive enugh."

You can download the whole EP for FREE."
,memo_juentes,2012-02-20T23:46Z,"The torrent itself is good but the album is not so good. I guess i was just expecting the songs to be more aggressive and most of them dont even climax. 

I feel like this could be a good album to listen while high but not for training, which is what i was looking for in the first place."
,R_7,2012-02-28T23:30Z,"Quite good torrent - 2,2 MB/s down :) Will add some UL speed too :)"
