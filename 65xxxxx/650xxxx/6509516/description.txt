
Earl Jones was an actual "rocket scientist" who had worked as part of the "Minuteman Missile Program".  After his retirement, he became a very passionate student of history, but.., not of the "politically correct" versions we've all been taught by the "controlled media" !

Earl Jones (now deceased) was from Deming, New Mexico and wrote a monthly publication called "The Intelligence Newsletter" which was part of his ministry by the name of "The Christian Crusade for Truth".

This is a 2-part lecture that was given at one of pastor Peter J Peters church-retreat gatherings.  It's a GREAT historical analysis of "Our People" (including our "warts" and all) from the days of Babylon, to the signing of the "Magna-Carte", and then to the present.., with a special emphasis on the history leading up to.., AND after World War II.

Even for those of you, who consider yourself to be a "truth junkie" of revisionist history.., will learn MUCH from this presentation !!!

This audio file is 96 minutes in length (lecture 1 & 2 combined) and has a quality of a 9 (recorded in 64bps).

At only 45 Mb.., it's more than worth your time to download and listen to.., especially if you've enjoyed any of my other "Borzoi" uploads...

As always.., please share here.., there.., or however you can.., in order to possibly help those who are asleep.., but who just may.., wish to be  AWAKENED  !!!

"He Who Wins the War.., ALSO Writes the History"

AND...

"The Truth shall make you Free.., but at first.., it'll make you Damn Mad" !!!
