               **********************************************
Ten years after tracking down serial killer Jame Gumb, FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) is unjustly blamed for a bungled drug raid. Starling and her connection to Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) come to the attention of Lecter's only surviving victim, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), a wealthy child molester whom Lecter left horribly disfigured and paralyzed after having been assigned as Verger's court-appointed therapist.

Verger uses his immense wealth and political influence to have Starling reassigned to Lecter's case and meets with her in his mansion. Verger is pursuing an elaborate scheme to capture, torture, and kill Lecter, and hopes Starling's involvement will draw him out....
