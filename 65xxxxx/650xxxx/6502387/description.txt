::Plot::
In the 1960s,[8] a 20-year-old woman[8] nicknamed \"Babydoll\" (Emily Browning), is institutionalized by her abusive stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) at the Lennox House for the Mentally Insane in Brattleboro, Vermont after she is blamed for the death of her younger sister. Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), one of the asylum\'s orderlies, is bribed by Babydoll\'s stepfather into forging the signature of the asylum\'s psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized, so she can neither inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister\'s death, nor reclaim her recently deceased mother\'s fortune. As Babydoll enters the institution, she takes note of several items that would be integral if she were to attempt an escape.
