         Will (Josh Hopkins), a charming 35-year-old      
         Philadelphia ad man, heads to Lebanon, Pa. to    
         bury his recently deceased father. He forms an   
         unexpected friendship with CJ (Rachel Kitson),   
         his bright, newly pregnant 17-year-old cousin.   
         As Will becomes interested in CJ's married       
         teacher (Samantha Mathis) and CJ confronts her   
         conflicted father, both struggle with            
         formidable decisions about the path their        
         lives will take. Can we vault our differences    
         and meet in the middle? This bittersweet comic   
         drama tenderly explores the cultural divide in   
         America through the lives of one extended        
         family.
