What a pity! Isn't there any knowledge anymore?"
,Lurch69,2011-07-01T15:00Z,"That's odd, because there are no historical records of this alleged Jesus. Bible tales, yes; no historical  corroboration. So Mohammad existed, but not Jesus. And you believe in the fantasy. That's funny."

,schmonuel,2011-07-01T22:10Z,Jesus does not believe in file sharing
,oneness4all,2011-07-02T00:19Z,"Jesus believes in sharing.
File sharing is just the latest version of it.
Why so many like to react without even bother to download the book and to read it.
When it's not your thing just move on and respect others to believe whatever the like."

,10christian10,2011-08-25T20:45Z,"LOOK I believe in God [the creator of everything, including us] When i was a child i thought, knew, and felt there was a higher power, and I felt the presence of god, now i come to know that Jesus was the son of god, God sent him here on earth so that we could have Life abundantly, Everything that happens god uses, Jesus said, if the world hates you, keep in mind that they hated me first. I mean they crucified him, and God resurrected him, we go through the same process in our lives, We die in our sins, than god shows himself to us, and we give him glory, because he send his spirit to us, and woke us up while we were dead in sin, now that's worth living for, no one is perfect, Jesus was perfect and they killed him, so we're gonna fall short, but it doesn't matter because god is alive inside of us and we can do everything through Jesus Christ who gives us strength without him we can do nothing. Jesus answered, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."
