----------------------------------------------------
Summary People v. Gator
 
In a satire of erotic anthologies like Red Shoe Diaries, Phil reads a letter from Reducto detailing 

his affair with Norlissa, the curvaceous ex-girlfriend of Black Vulcan. She is possessed of 

enormous buttocks, and when Reducto finds himself unwilling to shrink it, he falls into a state of 

existential angst. Meanwhile, Birdman is made a bounty hunter so he can apprehend and represent 

Wally Gator, a volatile redneck. Reducto progressively enlarges Norlissa's butt as they draw closer 

together. It is revealed that Reducto is a virgin, though he is broken of it by Norlissa during an 

awkward love scene. They are eventually confronted by Black Vulcan the morning after and engage in 

a threesome relationship. The Wally Gator case draws to a close with Wally being found guilty of 

poaching manatees, and he is sentenced to mud-wrestle Harvey, an Abraham Lincoln impersonator and 

two bikini models, while Phil plays the bongos at a Cha-cha club. Plaintiff USA

22 Harvey's Civvy Richard Ferguson-Hull July 31, 2005 
------------------------------------------------------- 
Summary Murro v. Birdman
 
In the opening, Murro the Maurader is fighting Birdman and Avenger. They defeat him, and fly away, 

not realizing that he has been paralyzed from the waist down. 
Decades later, Murro sues Birdman. Birdman needs a good lawyer, but somehow ends up with Potamus, 

who is more interested in making out with the female staff than working on Birdman's case.

In court, Murro's lawyer Shado uses his "brain-thievery" to influence the jury. His villainous 

witnesses testify that Birdman had no reason to attack them; Shado also uses his brain-thievery to 

prevent Potamus from cross-examining them.

Shado contends that his brain-thievery is fundamentally different from Mentok's "mind-taking", 

however the two get into frequent one-up-manship contests over their skills. Finally Mentok, tiring 

of the upstart Shado, delves into his mind and takes away an important fact: Shado failed to 

respond to a discovery motion filed by Potamus.

Mentok hypnotises Potamus to ask Shado "did you get that thing I sent you?". When Shado answers 

that he did, and failed to respond, Mentok declares a mistrial. Plaintiff Murro the Marauder 

Representative- Shado the Brain Thief 
Defendant- Harvey Birdman 
Representative- Peter Potamus 
Judge- Mentok the Mindtaker 
Description- The plaintiff is suing the defendant for physical and emotional damages resulting from 

an attack.

judge declares a mistrial.

23 X Gets the Crest Richard Ferguson-Hull August 7, 2005  
------------------------------------------------------- 
Summary Hoop 'n' Holler v. Rabbit
 
X wins Birdman's Crest in a game of what appears to be poker, although Peanut claims it's gin 

rummy. He cannot collect his million dollar commission, however, as F.E.A.R. moved its headquarters 

and left no forwarding address. 
Meanwhile, Birdman falls deeper and deeper into defeatism. He takes on Ricochet Rabbit's case 

against the town of Hoop'n'Holler after Ricochet destroyed half the town on one of his hyperactive 

outbursts. The town wants Ricochet's badge and Harvey agrees to help. The case goes badly, with 

Harvey's self-esteem at a low ebb and Ricochet Rabbit destroying half the courtroom, with Reducto 

accounting for most of the other half trying to shrink him. Mentok rules that Ricochet Rabbit has 

ADD, ADHD and OPP (which stands for "Other People's Problems", and is not a disease), and court-

orders Ricochet to be medicated with rabbit Ritalin.

The Crest takes over X's mind, causing him to become a hero. In the end, Harvey tricks X into 

returning his Crest by trading him a shinier (but useless) one. Plaintiff Town of Hoop 'n' Holler 

Representative- Myron Reducto 
Defendant- Ricochet Rabbit 
Representative- Harvey Birdman 
Judge Mentok- the Mindtaker 
Description- The plaintiff is suing the defendant for property damage.

to defend Morrocco Mole, who has been detained as a terrorist for two years after being discovered 

in the Middle East. While defending Morrocco, Harvey also has to deal with being bothered by 

Birdgirl, who has a striking resemblance to Judy Sebben. Birdgirl in turn has to fend off the 

advances of Phil, who continually sexually harasses her, oblivious to her true identity. Harvey 

also has to go to a hospital because Ernie Devlin seeks a will.

25 Turner Classic Birdman Richard Ferguson-Hull August 21, 2005
-------------------------------------------------------   
Summary N/A 

A frame episode for the short "Busy Day for Birdman". Although made in 2005, the short purports to 

be from 1967, and features many of the modern show's characters in their original incarnations, 

albeit with modern ironic overtones. Under orders from Falcon Seven, Birdman spends the day foiling 

the plots of numerous supervillains, including Reducto, Vulturo, Mentok, and X the Eliminator. At 

the end of the day, exhausted, Birdman resolves to quit being a superhero and take up a normal job 

(which involves Phil Ken Sebben constantly ordering him around). 
Notes:

Though the short is supposed to be from 1967, it includes a reference to Star Wars Episode IV: A 

New Hope, released a full decade later. 
The short was introduced by Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies.

26 Beyond the Valley of the Dinosaurs Richard Ferguson-Hull August 28, 2005 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Summary Tana v. Gokk
 
Harvey is invited by Potamus to relax in his new hot tub, wearing a pink shower terry that Potamus 

has told him to put on. Potamus instructs Harvey to "hit the jets" on the tub and when Harvey does 

so he is enveloped in a blue light and sucked into the swirling waters of the tub. Potamus follows 

Harvey, trying to retrieve his hoagie. Harvey and Potomus rematerialize in what appears to be the 

Stone Age. Harvey attempts to call Peanut (who seems to be hosting a Lamaze class in Potomus' 

office) but can't get a clear enough signal on his mobile phone. Harvey is caught by a group of 

neanderthal cave men who believe he's the "pink manbird" (because he's still wearing the shower 

terry) their oracle had foretold would bring them pestilence and drought. When Potomus appears they 

mistake him for their pink hippo helmet-wearing God, which Potomus gladly embraces. 
Phil manages to find out about the portal in the hot tub and brings Peanut, Avenger, and a Star 

Trek character parody to the past. Phil takes advantage of the limitless resources and lack of 

economy to start up several business ventures including theme parks and dinosaur hunting. 

Meanwhile, Harvey serves council to a cave woman who wants to leave her husband for another (exact 

duplicate-looking) cave man, while Potomus serves as judge. Harvey convinces Potomus not to 

sacrifice the woman (as the other cave men demand) but to give her and her husband marriage 

counseling - Phil tries to volunteer for it but Harvey decides to do it himself. Phil eventually 

angers the cave men and Potomus is discovered to be a sham so they all rush back to the watery 

portal but realize a little too late that the neanderthals and their dinosaurs followed them to the 

present. They all laugh and the Star Trek parody gets eaten by a T-Rex.

Notes:
The title of this episode is a cross between Beyond the Valley of the Dolls and Valley of the 

Dinosaurs.

27 Evolutionary War Richard Ferguson-Hull September 4, 2005  
------------------------------------------------------------
Summary Captain Caveman v. School Board
 
The school that Cavey Junior is attending refuses to teach evolution, claiming that it is just a 

myth, so his father (Captain Caveman) takes legal action, through Harvey Birdman. Peanut is sent to 

help prove evolution, but ends up spending all his time at a local strip club. Harvey has an 

identity crisis when Reducto asks him where a half man, half bird fits into the process of 

evolution, which involves him bursting into a Disney style song. 
The next day at court, Mentok messes with a chiseler who tries to put up a stone tablet of the Ten 

Commandments in front of the courthouse, and Peanut tells Harvey to call Magilla Gorilla to the 

stand to prove evolution (a talking ape) but the jury is unsatisfied. When Cavey Junior takes the 

stand he points out that he read the evolution chapter, not because he wanted to learn and expand 

his mind, but because the chapter was required for the "federally mandated no child left behind 

test" necessary to move onto the next grade. Mentok declares, after pranking the courtroom, that 

the school can teach whatever they want, and that Cavey Junior is merely a theory, not a real 

child.

Worth mentioning that over the course of the episode, Phil was battling the cave men and dinosaurs 

who were still roaming the streets from the previous episode. He joins Harvey at the end and gets 

himself a drink from a vending machine (with a frozen Flintstone family inside).

Notes:
The episode title is a play on "Evolution" and the "Revolutionary War". 

 Plaintiff- Captain Caveman 
Representative- Harvey Birdman 
Defendant- School Board 
Representative- Myron Reducto 
Judge- Mentok the Mindtaker 
Description- Civil Rights; Captain Caveman sues for the right of his son's education.

 Summary Peebles Pet Shop v. Peoples Animal Freedom Front
 
Magilla Gorilla gets freed from Mr. Peebles' pet shop by the People's Animals Freedom Front. Mr. 

Peebles comes to Harvey Birdman to get Magilla back. Also, Phil Ken Sebben takes Peter Potamus (and 

his three nephews Stuey, Fuey and Spuey; see Huey, Dewey, and Louie) along for an employee retreat, 

where Peter Potamus spends most of his time choking on a plastic beer can holder and Phil randomly 

blows stuff up and doesn't pay attention to Peter Potamus at all. Members of the People's Animals 

Freedom Front attack Harvey's office because they don't approve of him "owning" Avenger. 

Eventually, PAFF get sick of Magilla Gorilla's puns and they abandon him in a forest. In court (in 

front of an off-screen judge) Harvey tries to defend himself and Mr. Peabody against accusations of 

animal abuse but the radical activists will not be swayed. Eventually Avenger finds and brings back 

Magilla who wants to go back to living with Mr. Peebles.

29 Return of Birdgirl Richard Ferguson-Hull September 18, 2005
-----------------------------------------------------------------  
Summary People v. Bannon & Quest
 
Birdgirl brings to Harvey's attention a case where Dr. Quest and Race Bannon want to have a legal 

gay marriage to protect the boys. At the office, Birdgirl continues to be hit on by Phil and she 

reluctantly goes on a date with him lest he figure out she's actually his daughter. Mentok informs 

Harvey and his clients that he doesn't have the authority to try the case; they must argue it 

before the Justices League â€“ a group of seven robed super-judges (a humorous reference to both the 

Supreme Court of the United States and the Justice League). Birdgirl assist Harvey with the case in 

between forced dates with Phil and eventually Phil proposes to her, much to Birdgirl's horror. Phil 

condemns the idea of marriage between Dr. Quest and Race and out of her Birdgirl costume, Judy 

tries to keep her father from going through with the marriage by claiming Birdgirl is interested in 

Birdman. There's a quick fight and an injured Harvey Birdman goes before the Justices to hear the 

verdict... which never comes because they're called to action via telecommunicator. Afterward, 

Birdman interrupts the Sebben wedding and finally tells Phil that Birdgirl is his daughter but Phil 

still doesn't believe him. He does however call off the wedding when he inadvertently falls for 

Judy's Aunt Phyllis (a blonde busty woman with the exact same face, including mustache and eye-

patch, as Phil.) Plaintiff Race Bannon & Benton Quest

31 Sebben and Sebben Employee Orientation Richard Ferguson-Hull October 16, 2005  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary N/A 

The episode is presented as an orientation film for new Sebben & Sebben employees. 
Much of the time is spent on Phil's youth, where he is pictured as constantly engaging in 

activities hazardous to his left eye (though he doesn't actually lose it until he becomes an office 

worker).

Various characters in the series perform their typical activities: Peter Potamus demonstrates the 

firm's incredibly complicated system for "sending things"; Peanut demonstrates unethical behavior; 

Elliott the Deadly Duplicator provides employees with two of everything, except for staplers (an 

oversight).

Birdman himself appears only as a supporting player in a few scenes.

Notes:
The episode seems to be a spoof of the Orientation given to new employees of Ted Turner, as 

suggested in the voice commentary for "Blackwatch Plaid". 
Throughout the episode, random scenes from an infomercial for a juicer appear. 
Based on Phil Ken Sebben's dialogue, the video (or at least one scene of it) was filmed in the year 

1985

32 Identity Theft Richard Ferguson-Hull October 23, 2005
---------------------------------------------------------  
Summary Clam Head v. Tinker
 
Chemical Castration (nÃ© Yakky Doodle; see "Gone Efficien...t" above) wants his old name back, which 

requires photocopying paper work. So Harvey Birdman goes to Duplication Services but he unwittingly 

insults the employee by getting his name wrong (mispronouncing "Elliott" as "Eliot" ("ee-lee-

ought")). Despite the fact the name was spelled wrongly on his name tag, Elliott swears revenge and 

starts creating "copies" of Harvey. These copies are not photocopies but rather whole humans, 

apparently clones, that share Harvey's personality and knowledge. Unfortunately they get along, so 

he starts copying Phil Ken Sebben, who starts hunting Birdmans to thin the herds. Elliott then 

loses all control and make copies of everyone. Elliott only stops when he runs out of toner; the 

copies are subsequently shredded. 
Notes:

The whole episode itself is a satire of how many classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons are rip-offs of one 

another (ex. Scooby-Doo, Jabberjaw, and Speed Buggy are all mystery-solving cartoons involving 

objects/animals as focal characters who can talk, and how certain members of each mystery solving 

team look like each other, like Shaggy, Clamhead, and Mr. Tinker) and how animation styles done by 

different people looked very different (ex. different looking Ranger Smiths on Yogi Bear). 
Sebben's final words before he is put through the shredder are a parody of the last words of Roy 

Batty, a character played by Rutger Hauer in the 1982 film Blade Runner.

Representative- Harvey Birdman
