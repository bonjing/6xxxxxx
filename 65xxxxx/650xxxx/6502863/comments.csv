,LukeScooto,2011-07-19T05:36Z,"FYI, almost ALL of the ""trusted"", ""VIP"", and ""helper"" icons are faked. I see complete newjacks with totally bogus movies that dont come out for another 6 months with 11,000 leechers and 8,000 seeders, 10 minutes after they post it. Then they post 15 more movies just like it with the exact same amount of leechers and seeders. Put it this way, the trusted/helpers/vip's, can NOT be trusted any longer as most are fake.
Your a fool if you trust anyone on a P2P site anyways."
