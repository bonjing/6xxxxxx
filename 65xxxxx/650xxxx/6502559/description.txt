Altern 8: Profile

Altern-8 is an Early UK Rave music duo band featuring Mark Archer and Chris Peat. They were one of the UK rave
bands of the late 1980s and early 1990s whose trademark was loud electronic tracks with a heavy bass line.
Altern-8's members wore facemasks and chemical warfare suits. The band was signed to Network Records
based in Stratford House, Birmingham, England.

Altern-8 was formed in Stafford in 1990, as a side project to the already successful Nexus 21
(a name chosen because of its "futuristic House sound), when both members were 21. From the outset the
band's objective was to develop their style which was heavily influenced by the musical elements of other
Detroit House music artists Derrick May, Juan Atkins and Kevin Saunderson, as well as the Chicago sound
of Phuture and early electronic heroes Kraftwerk.

Altern-8 tunes changed the world of Rave music, influencing many artists, with their mixture of the sounds
of the Roland TB-303, 808 and 909 with breakbeats and familiar samples. At the time in the UK, outdoor
rave events were legal, and Altern-8 had a reputation for turning up to play at major unofficial events.
They helped to define harder House tracks relying more heavily on bass and volume. The use of more
bass and eclectic noises gradually evolved Altern-8's music away from the earlier House music style.
The duo, dressed in chemical warfare suits and dancing "like electrified monkeys",
took part in a large number of live performances.

Notable Altern-8 tracks include "Activ-8", "E-vapor-8", "Frequency", "Brutal-8-E", "Armageddon", "Move my body",
"Hypnotic St-8" and "Infiltrate 202". The band produced an album on the Network Records label in 1992
called Full On... Mask Hysteria. However when Rave music went out of fashion they started to get involved in the
evolution of Dance music, an off-shoot of Rave music. In 1992, Peat entered as a candidate for the Stafford constituency
in the General Election representing the Hardcore (Altern8-ive) party. He polled 158 votes and finished in fourth place.
In 1993, Archer began producing as Slo Moshun with Danny Taurus, responsible for Bells of N.Y., and Xen Mantra.

Altern-8's somewhat surreal image made for dramatic photographs and videos, but the same PR that helped to sell
their music was eventually used against the rave movement, as the UK tabloid press published stories about the
dangers of ecstasy, illegal raves and their impact on the countryside, resulting in the Criminal Justice and Public Order



Album Reviews (c/o www.discog.com)

An absolute masterclass in old school breaks, sampling and down right funky hardcore.
These guys set the bar not only for their tunes but for their amazing live show. I had the the pleasure and
the privilege of seeing them perform this entire album in Orlando Fl in 1992. Stunning.
This record is a must have for anyone that considers themselves old school.
The top tracks on this release are:
Infiltrate 202
E-Vapor-8 with it's infectious female vocal
Hypnotic ST-8
Brutal-8-E

Great to see this available as an official reissue, as it had become rather expensive to get
hold of, and with extra trax too. But true collectors need not fear, the original pressing remains the real thing,
as it is disappointing to find this reissue dogged by a common mastering fault in this "every man and his dog
can master using PC / mac / media player / itunes" age. Every track is separated by a 2 second gap,
and given that many of the tracks run together with effects, crowd noise etc, this spoils the flow of the
album when on continuous play.

Like the first reviewer i have just managed to get a mint copy for a reasonable price.
This album holds its price more consistently than any other rave album-Compilation. That tells you
some think.All the tracks our brilliant rave stompers recieving massive play at large scale raves.If your
into your old skool you will no that altern 8 appeared on "top of the pops" sporting there whacky image.
They got the camera man to zoom in on the "vicks vapour rub".A nudge'nudge wink'wink to the ravers.
which completly by passed the bbc sensors ! Because they just did not get it.I think this album is excellant
but the prodigy's experience expanded version is just a little bit better sounding thats my personal opinion
thats not to say this is any less of an album.You will notice there tracks appeared in most compilations this
shows how popular they were. Even thou some of the tunes have a commercial feel to them they have
aged extremely well.I play the cd all the time my favorites our "Move My Body"and infiltrate 202
