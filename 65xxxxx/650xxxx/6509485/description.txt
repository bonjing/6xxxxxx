Flatt & Scruggs - 1948-1959
4 CD SET (Bear Family Records)

The 5-star reviews for this set showed that Flatt & Scruggs are far from forgotten 25 years after they split up. Here we have their complete Mercury recordings as well as the Columbia recordings from 1950-1959. Of course, this set includes the original version of Foggy Mountain Breakdown, but it's no exaggeration to say that every one of the 112 tracks is a gem. Titles include Roll In My Sweet Baby's Arms, Jimmie Brown The Newsboy, Tis Sweet To Be Remembered, Earl's Breakdown, Flint Hill Special, Dim Lights Thick Smoke, Foggy Mountain Chimes, and Six White Horses. Bluegrass music comes no purer or finer.
