,WoWx3,2011-09-29T16:48Z,"Rätt ok release. Det är som dom säger ovan, bra kvalité med tanke på hur den spelades av.

Språk - Engelska

Men det var inte helt oväntat eftersom det inte finns några svenska releaser från bio duken. Tror inte att scenen släpper inhemska kopior.

Kommer köpa den när den kommer på Blu-Ray.
Tack för den reklamfria förhandstitten :)"
,Adoek,2011-10-05T01:19Z,I wish you stupid spamming fucks would stay on moovieliek or what the fuck ever it is you stream from and quite fucking wasting comments.

Get the fuck of The Bay and spam on Twitter or FaceBook and let pirates be pirates. Fucking lame ass faggish gutter sluts. I can't express how annoying you fuckers are.

,scubasafaris,2011-10-28T03:06Z,"URGENT~! Hey >BONE> - I am running Peer Block. now as  I am in from Fiji seeing friends and received as notice from their cable provider warning of copyright laws. I mean you can copy using a DVD burner or VHS or thru your computer to enjoy later  or again as you wish but can't download to watch? Is there another way to safely download and upload (seed) without the worry of BOG BROTHER tracking my content download and uploads? Anyone, please advise. Glad I am going back to paradise in two weeks...shiiiit, maybe they will be laying for me at the airport to get all my flash drives and portable hard drives. Sorta worried. Ok, lemme know out there waz up on these concerns. I don't want a drone to target me before I get outa here!"
