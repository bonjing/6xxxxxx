Shaun Cromwell is one of who-knows-how-many hundreds of acoustic folk-singer-songwriters on the scene. But his new CD Folk-Worn Prose shows that the form still has endless possibilities. Rather than letting the scaled-back instrumentation be a limitation, Cromwell invokes a variety of influences from old-timey country to ragtime to more contemporary. He's a great writer. His compositions are outwardly simple in sound but hold a good deal of musical and lyrical sophistication. He's got a very appealing musical persona, and he's a tasteful guitarist, joined by a variable small group of like-minded players.
