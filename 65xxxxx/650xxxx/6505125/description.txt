Plot
This gory, gleefully over-the-top revenge fantasy stars Rutger Hauer as the Hobo, a bum who
rolls into town hoping to start over, only to find his adopted city saturated in violence
and ruled by a vicious crime lord known as the Drake (Brian Downey). The Hobo's answer? Pick
up his handy pump-action scattergun and start laying waste to crooks, corrupt cops and every
other lowlife who crosses his path.

Delivering justice, one shell at a time...
