But you pretty much get a good impression of what's happening still.. Just watch it and see what happens.. ;-)

..and the slow download speed of the last 70%?
Be patient and blame my ISP.. LOL.."

That is strange. There are plenty seeds, even a seedbox in there somewhere, and it's uploading like mad..

Sure your ISP doesn't.. ..or that you've got the right trackers, DHT and PeerExchange?

If all that checks out on your end; try adding this tracker to your list:

http://www.blazefire.org/announce.php

It's a members only site, a community first and most with torrents as a way to borrow and lend/ make backups, but they track this torrent.

Hope that works out. :-)"

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6770177/

It is suitable for hearing impaired people too, since the whole movie is subbed into English. :-)"
