I've just got to watch this obliviant pop-sage. The one and only who hasn't got a shed of arrogance whatsoever; but just humbly know's all (which we dont). 

What would we, us ignorant mortals, do without Lawrence Leungs huge life-experience, encyclopedian knowledge, honesty, modesty, warm empathy and least, but not last; his outstanding intelligence? 

Leung is a genuine rolemodel for our youth, if any, and his clear mind and analytic skills are obviously superceeding anyones. - It is a clear must to see him again - to see Mr. Leung getting yet another self-satisfying kick out of his fatique mind and soulless smirky ridicule of others and their beliefs - with his bravado pseudo-scientific viola! approach.
