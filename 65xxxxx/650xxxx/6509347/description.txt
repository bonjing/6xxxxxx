Basic Manufacturing, Third Edition by Roger Timings 
Book Description
A core text for Vocational GCSE in Manufacturing and Intermediate GNVQ.
Basic Manufacturing has already established itself as a core text for manufacturing courses in Further Education. The new edition has been revised to be fully in line with the new Vocational GCSE in Manufacturing from Edexcel, covering the three compulsory units of this scheme, and will continue to act as a core text for Intermediate GNVQ. Coverage of the two schemes is combined throughout the text, yet each chapter clearly illustrates which sections map to which units within the two scheme specifications.
