    The Legion to Ensure Total Harmony and Law (L.E.T.H.A.L.), is            
    tracking a criminal mastermind known only as The Warrior. While          
    investigating his combination diamond smuggling/art theft/porn           
    production industry, the agents discover that he has cracked their       
    secret database and has stolen the files on all of their agents. With    
    the help of their martial arts intructor Fu, agents Tiger, Willow and    
    Cobra take on the case while also taking every opportunity to remove     
    their bikini tops.
