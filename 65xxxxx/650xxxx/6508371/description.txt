Beginning and Advanced Unix Shell Scripting video training courses.  Several hours of video instruction along with practice worksheets for learning to write shell scripts to use on Unix and Linux servers.  This covers the fundamentals from the very beginning up to intermediate level of scripting, although the author says it's advanced.  I think it compares different shells and most of it applies to all the popular shells. This is for you Angela, and anyone who wants to learn a valuable IT skill.
