             Set in the underbelly of Mumbai; in the                 
           notorious by-lanes where 'Greed is a                  
                 Culture' and 'Deceit becomes a Compulsion'             
              'Bhindi Baazaar Incorporation' revolves                
               around gangs of pickpockets who consider              
                pick pocketing as an art. They use their               
                 intelligence as a canvas and their                    
                spontaneity as a brush to survive in this           
              dangerous lively hood. 'Bhindi Baazaar Inc.'           
              is the story of a pawn and his calculated             
            moves to reach the end of the chessboard.            
             Revolving around a crime syndicate who are          
            in the business of pickpocket, the film            
              starts with a game of chess between two              
            characters 'Shroff' and 'Darzi'. Each move            
             unfolds their story and eventually the                
             motive of their meeting. The story unravels           
             the quest of a small time pickpocket 'Fateh'           
               next in line to be a MAMU (local area-head).
