,sarsapil,2011-06-29T17:57Z,"Sorry, fellas, here I must disagree... They are only preventing people from flooding the US with unwanted immigration. Mexico and other countries have to clean up their act, the US doesn't have to solve the world's problems and then become chaos to please economic and other refugees. It's in fact AN INVASION and has to be dealt with that way. Besides most of those don't even want to become Americans, they even refuse to learn and speak English, the country's language. You're endangering the lives and privacy of people who are just doing their jobs. Shame on you."

Lulz, confirmed for racist, nationalist, fascist neo-nazi.
Seriously, guys, I hope you don't buy into that sort of bullshit. The things that Arizona cops do are inexcusable, and this is simply showing all of them (yes, the good ones as well, although we know there aren't many of those, especially in Arizona) that they cannot get away with their wrongdoing forever. Perhaps it will actually make a difference. At this point, who knows what it will do... Although we do know that it will at least send a message."
,Assault591,2011-06-29T19:21Z,"If you are worried about getting caught use these programs anytime you download a torrent
PeerBlock
ProXPN -Free account will work
Hotspot Shield

Give you a little added layer of protection the last two are proxies that you run through to download, it changes your ip, and peerblock blocks connections from certain IPs sometimes you have to allow permanently for a few so you can surf the we, and gain access to sites."

I don't know where you come from, but if anybody should shut the f**k up about illegal immigration it is the US who raped the lands and bodies of the natives.

@AntiSecurity
Good work. Although even some ""good guys"" get in the crossfire here, as u mentioned yourself. Oh well, I guess you gotta take the bitter with the sweet. :P I pray for all good guys who got into this and lol at the ones who's got it coming to them."
,sarsapil,2011-06-30T00:40Z,"@Leftbloody

The natives took over the land from others who were there first and the first from the animals who lived there. Europeans took over from the natives, that is the way the world works, whether we like or not, but every country also has a right to protect its borders or face economic chaos. The natives defended their patch of land against all comers (Europeans), so what the US are doing now, the natives also tried to do (and failed). Use your brain and reason, not slogans created by those who want to get in no matter how and if they screw up the country they're invading with their illegal immigration."

You really believe that manifest destiny shit, don't you!

The difference between illegal and immoral?

Compare the legality of crossing a border to find a job and earn a living and the morality of mass slaughter and the plundering of an entire continent.

The difference is stark, is it not.

When it is perpetrated by the lawmaker, anything goes, so long as the lawmaker is white.

I'm sick of the whiney fucking Yanks and there phoney John Wayne macho injured puppy fucking poor fucking me schizoid stuff yourself with McFat don't let the 'llegals git nun identity fucking crisis consuming half the world's resources in one fucking fried breakfast whilst fucking the other half of the planet to feed its multiple fucking dependencies.

AMERICA

And I think I speak for one or two others..."

,sarsapil,2011-06-30T09:03Z,"In the US people live well because of the hard work, integrity, accountability, etc. of its people and institutions. Mexico and other countries could also feed its millions if they fought the corruption, laziness, ignorance, etc. of its governments and people, it isn't fair the US have to feed them and give them jobs taking them away from their own people. No way, Jose, let them sort out their own problems and leave us alone."
,flamesong,2011-06-30T11:39Z,"@sarsapil:

Your last comment is a joke!

The US was founded on genocide and built on corruption. It has apolitical system which masquerades as democracy - a two party oligarchy - and it consume many times more per capita than any other nation.

Don't moralise when your feet are in the swamp."
,iluvtofu,2011-06-30T16:13Z,@flamesong I never thought of it that way!  Thanks for pointing it out :)
,sarsapil,2011-06-30T19:01Z,"@flamesong

Look, I don't deny what you say, no country is 100% free of corruption but if you talk of genocide, it was present in all peoples or you think natives didn't massacre and enslave one another? Just read unbiased history. What I mean is that the US has achieved a high standard of living mostly through hard work and efficiency, inventions, etc., there is no reason to dump all that because other countries don't want to clean up their act. I am left also, but not a fanatic, I don't just repeat what some people scream at demonstrations, I try to think for myself and give credit where it is due. Believe me, you'll be better off that way."
