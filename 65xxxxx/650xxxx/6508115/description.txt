This is LAST EXILE, the renowned steampunk/adventure/scifi anime.

Due to the lack of torrent versions of Last Exile for convenient storage on a single DVD, I personally converted these episodes from the "KAA" torrent release. All 26 episodes are around 170 mb, crisp in High Quality MP4 format and WILL fit onto a single DVD. The dub is original japanese with english subs hardcoded. Go elsewhere for the english dub. 

I have many custom 1DVD convertions of classic animes to share if this torrent goes well. Feel free to comment.

KEEP THE SEEDING ALIVE.

PLOT: In a world that looks like the 19th century with anti-gravity devices, Claus and Lavie are pilot and co-pilot of a Vanship and act as couriers. They become involved with a mysterious mission after rescuing a little girl from a strange star-shaped killing machine. Not willing to let the girl die, they complete the mission by delivering her to the legendary mercenary ship Sylvana, only to become part of the crew as fighter pilots.

Enjoy.
