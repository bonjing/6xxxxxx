I did not know this until like, 10 minutes ago when I went to watch it. So, if you've already downloaded this, you need to also download ""The End of Time"" Parts 1 and 2.

I'm also not seeding this anymore because it royally messes with my internet connection, and I start school on Monday, so I can't have pages not loading because of seeding this."
