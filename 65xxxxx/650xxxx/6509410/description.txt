Coronary artery disease is the most commonly encountered problem in adult cardiology in the world. Echocardiography is the most commonly used imaging modality encountered in cardiology practice in the world. Even though there are many Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) reference books and echocardiography reference books, there is no single practical book so far in the literature with focus on the combined topics. The authors believe that this will be the first book to provide information on how echocardiography can be used in, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of ACS.
