,Mamoon69,2011-07-02T14:30Z,Grainy (lots of dots)... with a movie of this size 5GB it should be much clearer video. It dows not deserve to be 5GB. Thanks for the uploader but no thanks I'm not going for it.

you do realize that the grainy look often is a conscious style by the director/cinematographer/photographer and not necessarily having something to do with ""bad quality""? an example is aronofsky in his movies ""the wrestler"" and ""black swan"" in FULLD BD (untouched). grainy as hell."
