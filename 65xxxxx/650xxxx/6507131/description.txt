This book is a bridge between two distinct cultures; that of IT professionals responsible for building systems that prevent cybercrime, and law enforcement officials responsible for investigating and prosecuting those crimes. It introduces IT professionals to the highly structured world of law enforcement, where rules of evidence must be followed closely and crime scenes must not be contaminated. It provides law enforcement officers with an understanding of the technical aspects of cybercrime and of how technology can be used to help solve crimes that have been committed.
