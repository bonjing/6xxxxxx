I have installed the x86 Reg file into the registry but it still remains a 14-day trial when I run it :("
,freedomdwarf,2011-08-04T00:42Z,"PS: I'm talking about the ""Readme!!!.txt"" file.

Mine just has this (which is rubbish for me) -
1. Óñòàíàâëèâàåì ïðîãðàììó.
2. Çàïóñêàåì ôàéë ðååñòðà - First - Import Reg.reg
3. Êîïèðóåì ôàéë cr-dvd61.exe â ïàïêó ñ ïðîãðàììîé, çàïóñêàì... ââîäèì e-mail è íàæèìàåì Install License.

I guess the cr-dvd61.exe has something to do with the license but seeing as I can't make any sense of the text file I'm no better off!"
,freedomdwarf,2011-08-04T00:52Z,"Ok... So I tried to run the crack program...
It came up with some info which looked ok (my PC name) so I pressed the 'Install License' button - it says the licensed was installed.

When I run DVDInfoPro again it comes up with a messages saying ""CRC Checksum Error. The program has been compromised and will not continue"" and then it craps out!  :(

So I tried the crack program again and put in my REAL email address and installed the license == it worked!!!

I'm putting this info in the comments so other people know what to do to get this running properly  :D

Cheers!!"
