This book provides an analysis of how to countermine insurgency and the elements that might hinder its defeat. Inspired by his military experiences as a French military officer and attach in China, Greece, Southeast Asia, and Algeria, the author realized the need for a compass in the suppression of insurgency, and he set out to define the laws of counterinsurgency warfare, to deduce from them its principles, and to outline the corresponding strategy and tactics. Written in 1964, the book in its new printing is as relevant now as it was forty years ago. Counterinsurgency Warfare provides the template for the defeat of today's insurgents and terrorists.
