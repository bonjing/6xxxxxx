I can't give you exact audio quality being has I stopped watching as soon as I found out it was cam.

Don't believe me? Download it yourself. What I recommend so you dont waste time is just start download wait until you reach 1% and then find the  location of the video and watch, so being has only 1% is downloaded you will only be able to watch about a minute or so but that'll be enough to realize it's a cam.

So bottom line is this isn't fake, it's defenitely Transformer 3 but it's a cam. "
