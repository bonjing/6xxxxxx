Intraperitoneal chemotherapy is increasingly being used as first-line treatment for ovarian cancer. Nevertheless, it is difficult for the oncologist to find a definitive text that documents both the fundamental methods required to optimize therapy and the up-to-date results of phase I, II, and III clinical trials. With this in mind, the editors of Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy have assembled a team of highly experienced clinicians and researchers to cover every aspect of the subject. The topics addressed include treatment principles, patient, drug, and catheter selection, administration guidelines, the role of hyperthermia, supportive care requirements, novel drugs, and the most recent results of clinical trials. This book will be an invaluable source of information for both practicing clinical oncologists and oncologists in training.
