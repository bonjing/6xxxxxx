Why do some people have such a hard time working these rather elementary things out? "
[T],artpepper,2011-06-28T23:13Z,"@TheBoyka, why aren't you putting up ANY files? Fucking parasite."
[T],artpepper,2011-06-28T23:15Z,"@imjustwow, and why aren't you uploading anything? EXPLAIN...."
,imjustwow,2011-06-29T20:36Z,@artpepper...talking about working out elementary things? circlensess has upped this in 2008 and it still has 200+ healthy seeds....why would someone re-upload it? that was my questions....and don't worry abt me uploading...worry abt picking one of those ebooks u upload...will give u some brain cells before acting as someone's dumb ass-licker!!
