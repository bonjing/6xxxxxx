,DalittleBIGmen,2011-07-01T18:41Z,"Hi there,

I am mexican and I go to the US for business. The migra always stop me because I look just like a drug dealer(my bad). Good car, bling clothes, mexican looking and with money. So they always stop me for ""rutine"". They have open and destroy my car looking for drugs. They always say it was broken before they entered. It has been several times. 

Then they put me a ticket, for what?, they say because I was speeding or I did not make a stop. That are all bullshit. They make  make me walk all over the city to get into an atm or to change my pesos to dollars. I ask for ride cuz I have health issues and I can not walk for long periods of time. They say they do not care.

Thanks AntiSecurity.

I will download and seed so other people can see what this officer are up to with racism."

You won't be able to flash all your stylish stuff but you'll avoid the hassle. By the way, write me up for a couple of ounces of coke, unless it's too small potatoes for you. What wet blankets those pesky migra pigs, how about the 'freedom' to deal dope? They don't respect anything..."

,JohnShit,2011-07-01T22:49Z,"> we want a world free from police, prisons and politicians altogether.

Well, while I support what you're doing, that is simply ridiculous. Politicians, maybe, but police and prisons are needed - society wouldn't work without them. Police brutality, and corruption, on the other hand, SHOULD be eradicated. "
