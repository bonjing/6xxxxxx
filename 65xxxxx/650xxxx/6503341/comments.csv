,ladderman22,2011-06-30T01:54Z,You ever noticed how TheGabber is just a copycat - he copies what he writes three times every time he posts!
,tflagger997,2012-03-19T04:37Z,"No you dicks.  The comment system on TPB has been broken for years.  You can write, hit submit and it can take 1 second to an hour if it appears at all.  Since you do not know until someone tells you, people assume it was not transmitted and resend.  

They are not the same groups, they just copy from one release source and take the credit without checking the quality, or the information they post about it."
