,Glassgun,2011-06-28T11:57Z,If the torrent is too big for you to download contact me on youtube(ace1122tw) and I will see what I can do about getting some cds your way.
,qwertzo99,2011-06-28T14:55Z,Good torrent but putting it in a single huge chunk isn't good. By giving leechers choice what to download you could have more seeders. Peace!
,Glassgun,2011-06-28T15:40Z,Thanks I may do that in the future but I do not have the time right now.
,MadJack42,2011-06-28T15:45Z,"i have to say with the bandwidth speed i have,this will take a couple days to download.I would prefer mabye 1-2 gig chunks"
,w4r3zh4ck,2011-06-28T17:53Z,"Wooooohoooooooooooo!!!!! Keep seeding man, may God bless you!!!!!!!"
,Glassgun,2011-06-28T22:09Z,I am going to do this in smaller chunks. If you want me to contact you when I have it all set up. send me a message at my youtube account. should be up in the next few days.
