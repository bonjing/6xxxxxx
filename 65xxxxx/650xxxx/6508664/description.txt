IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Hangover 2 V2

Ok here we go with our second version of hangover 2 and what a nightmare it was,but all good in the
end so we think anyways lol.
Right first of the main body of the video is from a nice 720p cam and was dam good but had some
camera movement and missing a few minutes between change overs.
Now for those minutes, we replaced them with V1, about 14 minutes in total.
Right work done ....well firstly we needed to cut the 720p several pieces and rotate,crop and resize each part
differently aswell as the normal contrast,brightness,sharpness etc....
But by doing this the AR was off on some parts and bang on with others,so we've gone with a AR which is pretty
decent for all parts, but at times may be a bit stretched/smooshed but nothing major and doesnt last long.....
figured it was best to over crop a few seconds than have the picture shift from camera movement, 
although there is some movement but not as much as there would have been..........
Also after doing that we then needed to cut V1 video for the missing scenes and redo them to match the same
AR and video stats as the rest so we could append them together.....
So, from start to about 6 minutes 45 seconds then again from 56:16 to 1.02.29 all from V1...... 
Audio is some sweet LiNE which we synced filtered and remuxed to our encode :P

Anyway have to say it came out dam nice considering the source so enjoy this one funny as fook film  :)
