Details

These authentic chakra meditations develop inner security, joy, contentment, power, compassion, wisdom and higher purpose.

The 7 chakras are psychic energy centers located in the spine. Chakra meditation is a form of concentration meditation (dharana). Concentration focuses our energy, mind and awareness onto a symbol. The symbol becomes charged with energy and meaning and is brought to life within us.

By learning to feel, visualize and balance the chakras, and all the powerful elemental forces contained within them, we awaken a potent inner power (shakti) and lift ourselves to a higher plane of consciousness.

Chakra meditations are used in the pursuit of higher consciousness and spiritual realization. These meditations increase our sense of connection to the universal. From this higher level of perception we feel more connected to a higher purpose that gives our life greater meaning and resonance. Physical and psychological health is a side-effect of these wonderful meditation techniques.
