Gameplay

Four rare resources obtainable in all previous instalments will be replaced by blue crystals which came from dragon blood. Roughly 50% of units present in the game will be new introductions to the series, including the Radiant Glories of Haven, the Fate Spinners of Necropolis and the Breeders of Inferno.[1][4][5] Multiplayer will be present.



Plot

Heroes VI is a prequel to the main campaigns of Heroes of Might and Magic V, taking place four centuries earlier in the world of Ashan. A legendary Archangel general, revived hundreds of years after perishing during the Elder Wars, plots to recover his powers and take control of Ashan while battling a supposed Demon invasion, but is impeded by the Griffin dynasty. The campaign protagonists of the five factions are members of the Griffin family, the children of Duke Slava.[4][5] A hero named Sveltana has been prominently featured in screenshots to date.[6] The campaigns can be played in any order, and are interconnected.
