 WHATTA PIECE OF CRAP!

 SCREW u ubi I wouldnt play this if u payed me"
,Progeusz,2011-06-28T23:25Z,"Works great, thank you! Still, you need a key to beta. At least it's fast and steady download, not like these shitty Ubisoft servers."

,Kodenamezeus,2011-06-29T02:26Z,"The torrent works, thou that beta is almost nigh playable. As soon as the map loads I can't see anything, I have like polygons and stuff flying around and can't even see where I click.

Maybe it's a great game, but I'll have to wait until the final release to judge. I'm not playing this."
,elturbo9077,2011-06-29T03:09Z,"@ for all

this is a beta version that ubisoft gave out on june 27 2011 for 1000 people which means 1000 keys / logins i don't recommend downloading this unless if there is a crack for it wait maybe wait for a ali213 release of this witch should in include a crack

IF THIS HAS A CRACK OR SOME ONE HAS FOUND A WAY TO PASS THE LOG IN SCEEN PLEASE REPLY TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT"
,Kodenamezeus,2011-06-29T05:28Z,"@elturbo9077: there won't be any crack for the login. In order to login you need to have a valid Uplay account with a valid beta key (that cost like 50 bucks if you preorder the game anyway).

The only playable thing there without login are multiplayer maps, thou you can't multi them either. So it's solo the other was around.

BTW if you think that once the game comes out you'll play it just like that, well my friend, you're wrong, because everything required a connection nowadays, plus you'll need valid credentials to play campaigns. Of course at some point local geniuses will come out with a way to hack that too, but I mean... for 50 bucks... if you d/l it you probably already pay the same for your internet, right? So, y'know... why bother."
,Progeusz,2011-06-29T12:38Z,"""for 1000 people"" No.
Biggest game magazine in Poland got 2000 keys for their users. Another site about games got 5000 of them. I suppose there should be ~100 000 free beta keys somewhere there in the Internet (probably not anymore...)."

Anyone know what it means ? And/or can help me ?"
,loadstone007,2011-07-04T21:44Z,"Unpack the game using WinRAR. Install the game by running 'setup'. Go to the crack dir you downloaded, and then copy those files to the installed game dir on your computer (Program files\Ubisoft)."
,Cwebb12345,2011-07-05T04:05Z,There are no instructions to install and crack it properly but once you figure it out you can run the game and play it.

Yes, I know that part, but after the install is finished, that error message comes up and the install cancels "
,ponywa,2011-07-05T05:58Z,"It's working beautifuly
1. download; 2. unzip the first file (will unzip everything); 3. run setup from unzipped files; 4. it installs normally; 5.  copy crack to game directory and replace; 6. play
You probably can't play single player or online, but custom games are available and those are probably the core of the game, for me at least"
,Iberianw,2011-07-05T07:31Z,"It works fine, except for one thing - my game crashes every time at the 5th day of the second week in a custom game... Anyone has this problem, or is it just me?"

,Harribel,2011-07-06T19:08Z,Works fine but like @ Iberianw The game crashes at the 5th day at second week in-game. Just freezes and CAmpain doesnt work either. Bad crack. And when also trying to update to 1.2 the crack that followes does not work you need this one.

Hell no. The campaign is the core of the game, for everyone. No point in playing it if you can't play single-player."

Campaign doesn't work and the custom game always crashes at 5th day.

But the game itself is fantastic, I'm gonna definitely buy it.
