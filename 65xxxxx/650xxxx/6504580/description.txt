Greatest Hits is a compilation album by the British rock group Queen. When released in November 1981, the record consisted of Queen's best-selling singles since their first chart appearance in 1974 with "Seven Seas of Rhye," until their most recent album at the time, The Game. There was no universal track listing or cover art for the album, and each territory's tracks were dependent on what singles had been released there and which were successful. In some countries "Under Pressure" was included, which had been released as a single earlier in the year.
