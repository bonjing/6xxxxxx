,Argael,2011-06-28T21:54Z,Thank you!
,DarthPS3,2011-06-28T22:14Z,"You are very, very welcome. It is my absolute pleasure. "
,DarthPS3,2011-06-29T01:56Z,"I'm glad so many people are finding this file, but please, please, don't hit and run, I am not a super-seeder or group, seed some back so I can upload more goodies. "
,DarthPS3,2011-06-30T06:23Z,"Season 2 of BSG:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6505479/Battlestar_Galactica_Season_2_Complete_720p_[PS3_Compatible]_720"
,vereor247,2011-07-07T06:08Z,"Note:  These are slightly smaller than the standard 1.09 gig files for 720p HD files.

Ran the files through mediainfo and these are HD as in the resolution is 1280x720 and audio is at 384 bbps.

However, the average bitrate is 1.8 mbps, the standard download for 42 minute videos is ~ 1 mbps.  For the larger files such as 1.09 gigs it is around 3 mbps.  

Bitrate is correlated with video quality.  As a reference a DVD is 5-8 mbps.  Most streaming sources are between 2-4 mbps.

  I am not trying to bash darth, but you should be aware that smaller file size does not mean better.  Thank you for these Darth and I will seed."
,DarthPS3,2011-07-08T06:06Z,"I don't know too much about what you just said, but I do know that getting these to play on the PS3 was a bitch, and it could be it lost something in the process, otherwise the native file that I used must not have been 720p. 
Either way, I'll definitely try to be precise with the resolutions from now on. 
Oh, and thank you for helping to seed!
That kind of burst my bubble though. Can I ask if you checked the series itself or the mini-series?"
,DarthPS3,2011-07-26T20:49Z,"I've sat down and watched these since, definitely not perfect, but I will continue to seed since its the best I have for right now."
,Flagellum82_Dei,2012-05-17T16:10Z,"very nice upload , i've seen some episodes in BR and it's almost no difference (audio including) between your up. Very nice job !"
,Dionzone,2012-05-29T09:10Z,I dont have enough broadband right now but I will definately seed ya later :D
