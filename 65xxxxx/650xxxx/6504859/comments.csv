,sage1210,2011-07-01T18:27Z,"Game work perfect with the frame rate higher than 120 in brechmark and even set all graphics to maximum it still work great in real playing. 

*Whatever in real playing you have to turn on vsync feature or face the game that fast as light speed

However i not understand why they put the game pad config look like hiding (you have to press left or right arrow in keyboard config page until it show up).

my pc: cpu amd x4 3ghz +ram 4gb +ati r5850 run on win7 64bit  "
