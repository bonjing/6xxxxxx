
Chuck Missler - What is Truth (DivX)


How do we know what is really true?

How do we know that the Bible is true?

How sure can we be?

We live in a skeptical environment, where even the very existence of truth is questioned. Lately, the Bible - and even the Lord Jesus himself - has been under attack.

Join Chuck Missler as he examines the boundaries of our reality, explores ways to qualify sources of information, offers advice on testing hypothesis, and reveals the source of Ultimate Truth.
