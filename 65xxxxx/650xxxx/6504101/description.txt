
The Rape Of Europe (DivX)

The whole question of the European Union is creating much interest and debate in England and worldwide, which leads David Hathaway to ask why this pressure has come at this time in the 21st century to create a European Empire, which has never existed previously?

Of course that does not mean it should not exist, but David Hathaway asks what is the reason behind it? Is there some hidden purpose in creating it?

Watch the live evidence to prove the fulfillment of Bible prophecy. The Tower of Babel rebuilt in Europe â€“ the Woman on the Beast (Rev 17) in Europe â€“ the last empire of Daniel's vision â€“ the seat of Satan and the Gate to Hell in Berlin.

The narrator, David Hathaway, takes us through a terrifying, but sadly true, history.

He explains how:

1: Babylon's tower is rebuilt in the EU, and how the Biblical prophecy of Daniel through the interpretation of a dream king Nebuchadnezzar had, refers to Rome, which has been risen again to form the EU, the feet of part iron, part clay.

2: Who is the woman riding the Beast in Revelation 17, and who is the beast she's riding?

3: The shocking truth about how Satan has been governing Europe since "the throne of Satan" from Pergamon (Rev. 2:13: "I know your works, and where you dwell, where Satan's throne is.", literally was rebuilt in Berlin.
