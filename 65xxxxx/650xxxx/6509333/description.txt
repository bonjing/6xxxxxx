Chew #27

â€œ Space Cakes â€ Part Two
Delivered from the future! We jump ahead and show you exactly where Tony Chu is nine issues and two story arcs from now. Yes, CHEW presents its version of â€œ One Year Later. â€ A brilliant jumping on-point, or a pathetic cry for attention? You decide! 
Also: Those frickinâ€™ chogs return!

Note: After Chew #18, the story then leaps to Chew #27 showing the reader events taking place a year later.
