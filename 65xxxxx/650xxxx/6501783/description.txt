This book is above my skill level, but sharing is caring, so you deserve another +1.
I'd appreciate a good geomety book at first/second year university level, if you have one.

// So, here it is. I can remember I have a springer one which I'm searchin' in my collection. I'll post that 2 if I can find. If you need a specific book, name it; I'll try 2 post that 2 //
