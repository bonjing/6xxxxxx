,bigtdp,2011-07-18T17:25Z,"Thanks or the awesome torrents @Railgamelover !

I'm not sure where I need to install the Portsmouth Route to - there are 2 folders:

I guess 00000015-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 goes in /Content/Routes

but where does the GuildfordDistrict folder go? 

thanks,

xTx"
,bigtdp,2011-07-18T19:56Z,"Re: my last comment

Got it working by putting the GuildfordDistrict folder in Assets/RSC/

,Exagerative,2011-09-20T20:04Z,what addons are in this?!
,Mentalpen,2011-10-08T15:46Z,"*******WARNING*********

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS RUBBISH!!!!!

90% DO NOT WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Most files are missing and although they install they will not run as assets or contents are missing!!!!!

they load but will not run due to ""consist builder can't load rail vehicle""

pointless, Pointless, POINTLESS!!!!!!

you have been warned."
,Railgamelover,2011-10-08T19:02Z,"@Mentalpen: Ever think of it, that it could be your own fault?
For me it was working fine, and for many other people to..."
,Mentalpen,2011-10-09T22:56Z,"@Railgamer,

yes i did think that but i have very carefully added these one by one and even re installed after a full delete.

Like i say they load i will give you that BUT rail vehicles are missing.

so either they are not in the correct folders and are there for i am not placing them in the correct folders or they are missing.

90% say ""consist builder can't load rail vehicle XXX""

and there for the scenario will not run or if played on free play will load but not play due to the vehicle missing.

i have looked for the missing vehicle but it does not give specific files just for example class 37 br or what ever and yes they appear to be there and have been placed in the correct folder as came with the package but still gives the error.

for example, when attempting the AP19 Edinburgh to Glasgow Scenario Pack (Modern) it gives errors relating to gner + 158's stock.

i'm not knocking the efforts, just doesn't work imo

even most the rwp's don't work again they load but give class & rolling stock missing errors"
,Mentalpen,2011-10-10T10:12Z,"Railgamer

i am not the only one with the issue??

and yes i have download all the extra content as detailed in the text file.

see the last comment on

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6066198/Railworks_Add-ons_2011"
,Railgamelover,2011-10-10T17:26Z,"Mentalpen, of course you're not the only one with problems.
I've heard some people with problems, and much people without any problems.
Which version of RailWorks you'r using?
All add-ons in this pack are tested by me on RailWorks v117.3 and works fine.
It's possible that it don't work on RailWorks 3, I havn't test that jet."
,Mentalpen,2011-10-10T21:23Z,"I'm using train simulator 3 v6.7c which may be the issue then.

However according to the site they are all compatible.

Like i say ALL the scenario's load but are missing rail vehicles.

can you tell me which the vehicle files extensions are please?

bin, GeoPcDx or dcsv files.

i'll mess with file paths and rename and then include them in the files."
,Railgamelover,2011-10-11T22:02Z,"RailWorks 3 could be the problem, I even had problems with ""old"" legal add-ons on RW 3.
bin = Information files (name, weight, accelerating)
GeoPcDx = modelling files
dcsv = additional files (numbers and so on)
So you have to change the bin files, or wait for RW 3 compatible add-ons."
