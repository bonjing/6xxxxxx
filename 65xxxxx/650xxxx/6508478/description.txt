RailWorks add-ons - Part-3!

Here the thirt edition of the RailWorks Add-on pack, 20 more RailWorks Add-ons and easy to install, no password protected *.rar 
files or something else. All Add-ons are tested by me personally with RailWorks2 v117.3a and works great! If you want to 
download RailWorks, I advise you to download the "RailWorks.2-SKIDROW" torrent here on the TPB which is version v114.0b and 
update it with the upgrade in this torrent, that works fine for me. 
It's possible that the files also works with an older version of RailWorks or even with RailSimulator, but I hasnâ€™t test that 
so I can't guarantee anything.
Some of these Add-ons works also on a legal version of RailWorks, but please note that every time Steam updates RailWorks, the
Assets that comes with RailWorks will be overwritten, so most of RSDL Add-ons don't work on legal versions! 
Have fun with it!

How to install?
At first extract the *.rar file with WinRar or something else, then there are two options:
-   *.rar file contains a *.rwp file; Install this using the Package Manager in Railworks by pressing "Install" in the "Package
    Manager" tab and select the extracted *.rwp file, RailWorks will install the Assets now, if ask, overwrite existing Assets.
-   *.rar file contains "Assets" and/or "Content" and/or some other folders; copy the folders to the main folder of RailWorks
    for example "C:\Program Files\RailSimulator.com\RailWorks 2", if ask overwrite existing folders and files.
Now you can use the installed Add-on in RailWorks, sometimes it's needed that you delete all "Blueprint.pak" files in the 
subfolders of the "Assets" directory to show up the installed Add-ons!

Note: With some files there is an Readme.txt enclosed, please read that file carefully for installation instructions!

Notes:
"Railworks 2 v117.3a.rar" updates EVERY version of RailWorks to version 117.3!
