[T],whodathoughtit,2011-07-01T14:35Z,"great work PrimE

100% works

Fast speed as well, about 0.5 of a second lol

my computer just had sex with your file and had lots of babies"
,mostwanted187,2011-07-02T10:56Z,"i think everyones activation number is different. thats why this activation method will keep on working. 

great work, your da man with da master plan!!"
,godswallops,2011-07-02T15:42Z,"Worked like a charm, and the robot on the other end of the phone line was polite and patient :)

However, I don't think posting activation codes will achieve anything as I expect that they will all be different. I know that kid9164's code (above) didn't work for me & my activation code from MS was completely different.

Perhaps the uploader could confirm this.


Thanks!"

[T],L3G3ND,2011-07-03T05:35Z,"@ Razanaga,
I dont know who is ""chess000master"" and i am happy to tell you that 'this activation isnt purely mine' because i find this trick on google videos which was in japanese. I did a simple change that i had added MAK key to it in place of KMS. There isnt a topic of giving the credits. If I had uploaded yous torrent i will 100 percent give the credit to you.
Now it is enough to prove that it isnt a CRAP of a ""chess000master""."

to you kids that are scared to call up m$ b/c you don't want to talk to some ""bitch"", relax...  it's an automated system.  you don't talk to anyone with a pulse.  it worked perfectly.

if your really nerved up out about it, dial *67 before you call, it will block your phone number when you dial.  it's a basic block, i'm sure they could get your number if they really wanted to, but do you think they give a shit about you?  it would cost more to get your info worked out and prosecute you that it's worth to them.  piracy is a line item in their budget.

thats because the autokms by EZ is seem to be a virus but it is noting.


And all peers.

The included MAK key is overloaded hence been expired so telephone conversation will not work further else some countries. You can save your old key of telephone conv it will work always.

And you can still use it using EZ Activator.

And i will upload a new version with new key very soon."

3. Click on ""Licence Backup""

4. Uncheck ""Save Keys"" and Check ""Reinstall Keys""

5. In the typing bar of ""Backup name"" type: prime

7. Let it do it's thing until it says ""Activation was successful""

8. Now close your antivirus, firewall etc.

9. Click on ""EZ-Activator"", on the ""Main"" selection

10. Go to ""Word"" or ""Excel"" and select ""File"", then go to ""Help"", you will see that ""Activation was successful"" - 
    If not ""Reboot"", and there you go, your application is now ACTIVATED!

11. You can UPDATE all the programs with windows update just like a normal copy of Office 2010

12. Bonus: If you want to prove yourself that this doesn't have any GRACE PERIODS, then install VAMT 2.0 ""Volume Activation Management Tool
    You will see at least 2 licenced programs that should be Windows XP or Vista or 7 and Office. You will notice Office does not have any Expiration Date set

,goosegoose35,2011-09-24T20:05Z,"followed kund 84 and I still have a 180 day grace....

Anyone know if there any new keys we can use by telephone?"
,Malasky,2011-09-24T20:43Z,"Prime. You goddamned hero!! Works brilliantly. Just followed kund84's instructions. Didn't close antivirus (AVG), but turned firewall off. AVG flags activator as a threat, (well, it would, wouldn't it?) but just ignored it, and selected Allow. Re-booted, and all is well. Scanned system with Malwarebytes, and AVG, and all is well. Thanks guys. No more annoying red bars or reminders."

Apart from the 2 false positives AutoKMS.exe and KMSEmulator.exe.
Thanks again, man. Quality up."

,maliusmaximus,2011-10-16T16:11Z,"Phone activation does not work. Perhaps the saved keys in the activator have been tagged by Microsoft, thus the phone activation code provided has also been tagged. Tried 5 times, the phone activation code generated by the key/s provided/overwritten by this activator definitely does not work.
For reference the phone activation code begins with 017345 and ends with 128706"

After reading the numbers to the automated system, it said my copy could not be confirmed and was transferred to a live rep. He asked for the first five numbers and then transferred me back to the automated system to get my confirmation numbers. Took literally 1 minute to get it activated. Amazing! "

,Iakoul,2012-01-06T04:54Z,"Not sure if I'm supposed to say or do this....but....

Just type it in....once you get the error and it transfers you don't just HANG UP. Wait and be just be polite to whoever answers. Tell them what they ask (should be the first and last group of numbers) and they will redirect you to the automatic activation again and the activation process should work without much hassle.

I don't know how long this can go on, but you guys can try it for now if all else fails. I did and it worked."
,onyxchen,2012-01-09T19:10Z,"Nice :) love the fact that microsoft gave me the key lol

,rw6,2012-02-06T03:20Z,"Tried to activate, the automated system failed to give me an installation ID, so I was transferred to a customer representative. They are now asking for everything. They asked for my name, where I bought it, if it was the first time I activated it. I answered I got it from a computer store and it was the first time. Then they asked me for the ID and told me to go to the place where I bought it, since it's been activated lots of times and this version of Office isn't available at stores. What should I do?"

i used once on the telephone and the machine started giving me back the reply until box C when i accidently hang up the phone, when i call again do it it could not accept the instalaltion id :( so I AM BEGGING is there a way to change it, other than formating the pc?  thank you "

I had a KMS craked Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 on Windows 7 64-bit that started saying it was not valid after a recent update. I used the free Windows Autoruns to search and disable all KMS instances, rebooted and followed your instructions. Called M$, talked with a human and it's now activated. I updated Office to SP1 and all is well w/o uninstalling, reinstalling, etc. THANKS!"

,bob12970,2012-03-01T07:56Z,I do not think it is necessary to call the bitch on the phone just use EZ Activator.

and no need to call that bitch........"
