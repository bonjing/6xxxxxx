,davisd,2011-06-30T09:09Z,"Hey, thanks for this upload.  But can you up the quality?  All the previous ones were great, but this was a bit too pixelated.  Thanks again!"
,davisd,2011-06-30T09:09Z,*Up the quality in future uploads

I am reposting these torrents from demonoid for those that want them.
I am not the one doing the recording and encoding."
,benhenry6969,2011-06-30T17:53Z,"@skepticink I really, really appreciate you posting these as quickly as you are.  I used to watch the next day podcasts of these when he was on MSNBC. Now that he's on Current, they're not doing that.  I just wanted to give you positive feedback that your work is appreciated.  I'm not familiar with demonoid - is it better for me to get them from there?

Thanks again"

Demonoid is a semi-private torrent index.
Sometimes it's invite only, sometimes it's open for registration.
It makes little difference where you download from.
I'll try to keep posting them here."
