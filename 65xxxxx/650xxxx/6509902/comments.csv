Be done with it already.  "
,general.p,2011-07-12T06:21Z,"1) I still donâ€™t understand why some people comment when they have no idea what the fuck theyâ€˜re talking about THERE ARE NO RAR FILES IN THIS TORRENT!!!!!
2) ALL!!  Sound and video formats are already compressed and in a container so they donâ€™t really compress further..
3) Most releases are released on News Servers where the â€œsceneâ€ started many years ago before torrents existed, thatâ€™s why theyâ€™re in multiple RAR or other format pieces.
4) Stop being a whiny bitch and appreciate the work these people do for you for FREE!!!! And realise that not everything is catered to your whiny bitch needs no matter how self important you feel you are....

Thanks to Momentum and TvTeam for continued great releases, some of us do appreciate the work."
