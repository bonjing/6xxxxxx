,PaceyPimps,2011-09-14T19:20Z,What are you guys complaining about Ares works perfect and it is free now for OS X Lion there is no good program. Limewire Pirate still works but no users anymore and Frostwire 5 suck 4.21.8 is the best but will not wok in LION but still there are better results in Ares
