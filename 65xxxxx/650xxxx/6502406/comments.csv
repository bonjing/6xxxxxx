,Micah71381,2011-07-31T03:47Z,"Wow, nice quality.  What is this PDF sourced from?  The quality seems too high to be a custom scan job and the publisher doesn't have a PDF version out yet.

The bookmarks are just top level bookmarks without names (just chapter numbers) and the book has not been OCRed (meaning you can't highlight/copy text).  The image quality is superb though."
,djh101,2011-08-04T02:43Z,"Mastering Chemistry comes with an e-book.  It is in Flash, but the pages can be printed individually to .pdf files."
,djh101,2011-08-04T02:47Z,"The pages print as images, though, so there is no text highlighting and you don't get all the nifty features available in the Mastering Chemistry edition (for instance, entries in the index are clickable links that will take you to their page of origin)."
