Photographer Raj Bedi meets with attractive Radha, both fall in love, and get married. Shortly after the marriage, Raj has an accident and is hospitalized. He does recover, but has no sensation in his legs and must be confined to a wheelchair. The cost of his treatment, in addition to the loss of his job, leads Radha to take up employment as a Governess to a small child, the only daughter of wealthy industrialist, Ashok Mehra. Raj is quite happy at this arrangement and looks forward to his treatment locally, and subsequently abroad. What he does not know that Ashok's deceased wife resembles Radha, that his daughter, Mini, thinks that Mom has finally returned home; and that this was prime reason that Radha was ever hired by Mehra and his associates. Will Radha take to the comfortable life as the wealthy Mrs. Mehra, in addition to getting a cute little daughter for her own self?
