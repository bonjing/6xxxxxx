Starred Review. Bestseller Coel's descriptive artistry, as shown in her 11th whodunit (after 2004's Wife of Moon), surely makes her the James Lee Burke of Native American mystery writers. Readers will be immediately entrenched in the solid reality of the Wind River Reservation and Father John O'Malley's alarm on receiving a cryptic voice-mail message that leads him to a century-old battlefield and three newly slain Shoshones. Could these be revenge killings for the bloody battle that took place between the now co-existing Arapahos and Shoshones? When a client of Arapaho attorney Vicky Holden, Frankie Montana, is accused of the murders, Vicky's law partner and lover, Adam Lone Eagle, urges her to pass Montana to the attractive new lawyer in town. Past experience sets off her warning bells, and Vicky begins to wonder about Adam's interest in the beautiful blond newcomer.
