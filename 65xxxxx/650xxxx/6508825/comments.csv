,Rod321,2011-09-06T00:37Z,"This download is no good. 
The picture is mostly a black screen with short displays of a movie.
The language is not English"
,Rod321,2011-09-07T04:00Z,"Hi sunDox,
I had better add some more as the previous message that I left is seriously unfair & lacks detail - my apologies to you sunDox.
The movie will not play with VLC or Windows Media on my computer & this is a first for me. HOWEVER it plays fine on the 50inch Plasma via the media center & quality is good. So I converted it to AVI with AVS but lost the subs. Thus I will be content to watch it on the TV & not set it up to be used on a computer.

A - 9/10
V - 9/10
Sync - 10/10
It is good quality."
,albokid89,2011-11-04T04:13Z,"is the movie any funny guys, worth it? I'm sure quality is excellent  lol"
,AxOpLiX,2011-11-13T11:41Z,"Quality's fine, don't know what the hype's all about!"
