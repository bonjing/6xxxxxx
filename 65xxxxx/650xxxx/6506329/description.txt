The sub-idx files from the DVD wasnt read-able well enough by the 
subrip program to create an SRT for you as we would have liked
to for Spanish in this case (only English French and Spanish were included)
- we do have English and French however SRTs for you from other sources
In addition we have close captioned srt subtitles for English too
extracted from the DVD itself by other means.

You could create your own language versions quickly enough
using the English templates provided as a starting point.

with thanks for your seed!
