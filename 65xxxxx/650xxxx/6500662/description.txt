Led Zeppelin concert in Tucson, Arizona on June 28th, 1972.

Sourced from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3984034 by TimD54 - I added descriptive filenames and metadata, and left the audio itself unchanged.

Tim apparently sourced this show from the master cassette (as opposed to previous circulating versions with some generational loss). He also mastered it a but.
