Note: this is a collection of marvel comics of the ultimate universe, not the ultimate collection of marvel comics in general. The name of the entire series can get kind of confusing in conversations.

To all you fans of ultimate marvel; this contains everything up to june 21st. Read it, enjoy it.
To all those who never heard of ultimate marvel: Check it out. Start by reading ultimate spider-man, the first 24 issues of ultimate x-men or the ultimates v1 and v2. Spider-man and the ultimates are concidered among the best of marvel comics.

These are not my scans, so full respect to the original scanners. Though the older issues of ultimate x-men really need some better scans. Which is weird, since they are the only legally and commercially scanned ones.
