I decided to upload my Stone Roses collection after I noticed that there was no decent discographies on TPB.

These songs were all ripped from genuine discs I bought while growing up in the late 80s and 90s.

There are no rubbish compilation albums here, only genuine Roses releases, with genuine Squire artwork also included. The only exception to this is the compilation of early work which became known as Garage Flower. Band members have renounced that work as insignificant, but I have included it anyway.

I have also included the live performance at Glasgow Green from 1990, which is regarded as being one of the best ever Roses gigs.
