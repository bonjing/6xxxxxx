,G.i.a.n.t,2011-07-01T23:05Z,does this have the first 10 mins ? 
,gussers3,2011-07-02T00:15Z,Just scanned through it and all looks good. Very good for an early cam.
,xentryx,2011-07-02T00:27Z,"V - 7.5 (cam standards)
A - 5

Plenty watchable if you don't mind the sound. You may wanna wait and let CM8 get hold of it. "
,gussers3,2011-07-02T00:28Z,Haven't seen the movie but this doesn't start with any moon sequence if that's what's missing
,D3V1S1,2011-07-02T03:47Z,missing the first 13 min of the movie

A/6 
V/7
Decent picture for a CAM, the audio has some background noises and is a bit tinny and echoic in parts, but overall the movie is watchable and is the best CAM copy that Iâve seen so far... 
Many Thanx to WBZ for the decent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:)
