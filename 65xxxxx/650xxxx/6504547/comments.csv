,illwrath,2011-07-01T11:03Z,"How do these shitty straight-to-video atrocities keep cracking the top 100 list?

There's some serious chicanery going on to manipulate your stats."
,Frice,2011-07-02T07:42Z,"Gotta agree, this movie was complete garbage, even for someone that is a slut for zombie flicks, this one SUCKS.

The scene where they run through the woods randomly shooting at zombies they could just run past was the worst.

I'd have rather watched Age of the Dragon, at least then I would be expecting a shit sandwhich."
,dubblue,2011-07-02T12:00Z,thanks
,JohnyMoronic,2011-07-02T19:10Z,Not too bad for a zombie flick.  Who could escape from zombies able to move at the speed of a sick tortoise.
,antropophagus77,2011-08-05T17:11Z,"Thanks for sharing this movie. I cant wait to watch that one. I bought the 1st when it got out and I'm pretty curious about this one.

Cheers to you, man."
