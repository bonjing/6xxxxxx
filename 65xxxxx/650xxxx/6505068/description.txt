I took the audio from a shitty quality english dub.
Remastered it and adjusted the timing using Audacity.
Then I muxed it in with the HD version released by Eclipse Fansubs using mkvtoolnix/MKVExtractGUI.
Checksums generated using pure-sfv v0.3.
Now we have a dual audio, awesome quality, english dub that doesn't suck.

I'm going to try to release 5 every week.
