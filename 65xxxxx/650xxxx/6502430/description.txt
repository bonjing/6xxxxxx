Storyline:
Set against the futuristic landscape of a totalitarian Britain, the movie tells the story of a mildmannered
young woman named Evey who is rescued from a life-and-death situation by a
man known only as â€œVâ€ â€“ a striking figure in a black cloak and a high-peaked hat under which
he wears a curious mask. Incomparably charismatic and ferociously skilled in the art of
combat and deception, V ignites a revolution when he urges his fellow citizens to rise up
against tyranny and oppression.
