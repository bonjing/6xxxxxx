[a day before the 400th Guy Fawkes Night], but was delayed; it opened on March 17, 2006.
Reviews were mixed, but the worldwide box office earnings were over $132 million. Alan
Moore, having been disappointed with the film adaptations of two of his other graphic novels,
From Hell and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, refused to view the film and
subsequently distanced himself from it.

The film had been seen by many political groups as an allegory of oppression by government.
Libertarians used it as a statement against government intervention into the lives of the
citizens. Anarchists used it to propagate anarchism. Activists belonging to the group
Anonymous use the same Guy Fawkes mask popularized by the film when they appear in
public at numerous high-profile events, emulating one of its key scenes later on...
