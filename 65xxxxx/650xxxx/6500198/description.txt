                           DESCRiPTiON 

 The Universe The Top Gear presenter embarks on a typically light-hearted journey of 
 discovery across the universe, in an attempt to answer some of the questions that
 have often puzzled him about the cosmos, such as where did it all begin?, how do
 stars work? and what is Madonna doing in space? With the help of snazzy graphics
 and a bit of science, James will get to the bottom of everything from white dwarfs
 to black holes, helping viewers understand their place within the grand scheme of
 things.
                         
                                 Enjoy!
