- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -
Existing at the point where metal collides with all other genres, 
Iwrestledabearonce are an example of the bold experimentation that has been 
keeping metal fresh and exciting. In 2007 the group released its bedroom-recorded 
self-titled EP. After extensive touring, Iwrestledabearonce signed with Century 
Media and released their debut full-length, It's All Happening, in 2009.
