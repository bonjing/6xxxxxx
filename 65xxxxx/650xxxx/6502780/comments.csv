[V],Horrorspoke,2011-08-12T10:28Z,"Yeah nice on the early upload, but the tracklist is wrong I'm afraid.... I've uploaded a 320kbs version of the correct tracklist if anyone wants to update :)

,baluna9,2011-08-14T19:12Z,"I checked out a few numbers and ik looked all O.K.
BUT all the way to the bottom is 1 song that almost made me puke.
That's the only reason why I think it's bad
sorry dude"
[V],Horrorspoke,2011-08-15T20:37Z,"Why would everyone download the wrong tracklist? THIS IS NOT NOW 79!!!!!!

It was a predicted version - not the real CD - the CD is completely different to this..... What is wrong with you people?!?!?!??!?!"
,mwaxx,2011-09-10T21:48Z,"admittedly, i should've read the comments before downloading, but you should be banned from all future uploads. its not even a case of hating on the uploader before anyone starts this. all the ID3 tags are completely bullshit so if you open this in itunes it will ruin your library (if its tidy, anyway)
state it! state that its a predicted tracklist and state that the ID3 tags are all bullshit! i've seen some bad uploaders on here but you top the lot."
,mwaxx,2011-09-10T21:49Z,"actually, i should take that back, i've downloaded other albums from this guy in the past and they were sound. but this is fucking terrible"
