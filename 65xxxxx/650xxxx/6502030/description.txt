Compression mini tutorial:

1. get SUPER (it's freeware and can convert everything to everything)

2. modify settings like this (what I use, could be not so efficient):
 2.1 codec H264
 2.2 set video width X 288 (width/288 must be equal to originalWidth/originalHeight)
 2.3 set video bitrate somewhere between 240-270. I set it 240. I didn't go lower.
 2.4 set audio: mp3, audio bitrate 56kbs, sample rate 22050Hz. But lately I've increased to 64kbs and 44100hz.

3. Hit the button
You should get videos somewhere around 60-90 mb.

4. create a torrent, then upload to tpb
