David Bazan - Fewer Moving Parts (2006)(FLAC)










David Bazan (born January 1976) is an indie rock singer-songwriter from Seattle, Washington. Bazan (pronounced "buh-zahn") was the lead singer and creative force behind the now-defunct band Pedro the Lion and was the lead singer of Headphones, a band he formed out of his interest in synthesizers. In early 2006, he began performing and recording under his own name.

Fewer Moving Parts is David Bazan's debut EP, released in limited quantities on June 13, 2006. It was re-released on 22 May 2007 on Barsuk Records.

The EP was considered a stopgap release to tide fans over until his full-length solo debut. While officially an EP, Fewer Moving Parts is longer â€” in total tracks or in runtime â€” than some albums.

The EP features five songs in two forms: first with full instrumentation, then stripped-down acoustic. In its first incarnation, "Backwoods Nation" was a Pedro the Lion b-side, featured on the 2002 Jade Tree compilation Location is Everything, Volume 1. "Cold Beer and Cigarettes", originally known by its alternate title, "The Devil is Beating His Wife", came to light as a 2005 Pedro the Lion demo recording. It was originally slated to be on their now abandoned fifth full-length album, but was re-recorded for Fewer Moving Parts.
