Nico was one of the most fascinating women of the 1960s pop-art revolution. Born Christa Paffgen in Berlin in 1938, she embarked on a modelling career early on and later worked with people like Fellini. She travelled between Europe and the United States pursuing both acting and singing careers. Having gotten to know people like Alain Delon and Bob Dylan, it wasn't long before she also met Andy Warhol. Her singing career replaced modelling when she joined the Velvet Underground. Nico's iconic-stature was secured. Carried away into a destructive and crazed universe of music and heroin, the mystery surrounding her life grew... Her death in 1988 made her immortal. This film brings you her the way she was and the way she appeared. Nico, as pop icon.
