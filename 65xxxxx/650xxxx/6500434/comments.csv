Basically I did not get good leechers when I uploaded old bengali films,they just ' hit and run ', they do not have any sharing mentality. But when i up some 'NEWLY' released bengali films I always get good leechers,so if i got busy seeding my old uploads how I upload some new stuffs ???
I have full collection of Satyajit Ray's films & all Feluda series, also total TV-rip. I can up these also in small sizes.
But I only get unlimited connection for 6 hours in a day with 50-70 kbps bandwidth.so it's a tough job you may notice.
I do not want to see my torrents die shortly. I uploaded ' Pratham Pratisruti (1971) ' previously, it's an awesome classic up you know, but it has few,very few seeds.so when I'm noticed to others & get a healthy leechers I'll upload some vintage,national award winner,rare bengali films,because i have a gigantic collection of good bengali films..
so until that day please wait. thanks my friend.. "
