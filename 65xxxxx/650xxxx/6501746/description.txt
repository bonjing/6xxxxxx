SERENITY - The Other Half
SERENITY - Downtime

These are two eight-page web-comics that are part of the official Firefly/Serenity canon - Joss Whedon is credited as co-writer on both.  The Other Half was originally on MySpace and Downtime was originally on USAToday.   Here, they're converted into .PNGs (just eight each).

I think that they're pretty good, and the art in The Other Half is great.

Hope you enjoy.
