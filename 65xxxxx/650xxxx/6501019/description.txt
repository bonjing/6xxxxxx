Vinux is a remastered version of the Ubuntu Linux Distribution optimised for visually impaired users. It provides a screen-reader, full-screen magnification and support for Braille displays out of the box! It can be run from a Live CD without making any changes to your hard drive. If you like it you can install it to a USB pendrive or to your hard drive either alongside Windows using the Virtual Version, or as a complete replacement for windows.  To find out more about the various versions of Vinux, please click on the relevant links. 
We also have a wiki for many helpful articles, a support group you can join, and a Vinux blog.  These also can be accessed from the menus displayed.  We hope you enjoy your visit!
