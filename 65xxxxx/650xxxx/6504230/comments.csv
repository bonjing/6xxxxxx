,knighthawk3759,2011-07-19T12:02Z,torrent is broken files are empty and wil not download past 99.2%
,freedomdwarf,2011-10-07T12:39Z,"For the sake of a few small ads in a chat window, why even risk this sort of torrent?
Trillian is *FREE* from the official developers - nothing is restricted any more.
Latest build is v5.1 build 11 so this one (or the patch) may not even work for FaceBook, G+ or Skype as they have changed the connection.
And unless you buy a Pro license and opt for the cloud sync your info is NOT stored on their servers! The Ads have been greatly reduced too.
Audio/Video/cam doesn't work on most mediums tho so don't be fooled with false claims."
