THE CONFIDENT STUDENT, Seventh Edition, provides practical and immediately applicable skills and critical-thinking strategies by emphasizing self-discovery, self-management, and self-assessment, with an underlying theme of helping first-year students to be more confident in their approach to learning. THE CONFIDENT STUDENT's core values of individual responsibility and confidence through accomplishment remain at its forefront by showing students they can succeed by applying themselves. The seventh edition pays particular attention to today's student diversity, not only in their backgrounds but also in the ways they learn. Some learn best by reading, some are more visually oriented, and some learn best through practice and assessment. The conversational writing style coupled with the variety of strategies and exercises enhances the journey students take to becoming more successful in college and life.
