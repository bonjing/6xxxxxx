Bob Dylan back in my hometown Bergen, at what must be Europes worst sounding arena.
Bob was in an excellent mood, joking around with Donnie, while Charlie Sexton (and I still don't understand how he got his gig in Dylans band back) spent most of the concert tuning his guitars, and changing them between every song. Charlie, just get ONE that works, and stick with it - they all sounded the same tonight anyway.
It kept raining most of the show, which turned out to be a good thing, as checking levels are a lot easier under a rain-poncho, and a big Norwegian rain-hat makes a great microphone-rack.
Anyway, another great show from Bob, though not in my personal-attendance top five. Bob was great, the band was not all that inspired tonight - and they kept looking like they were dead scared of fucking something up.
I kept having to duck down, as two security-dudes kept running back and forth in front of me, scanning the crowd. Hopefully it won't be to noticeable.

Suzanne Vega did a good job as suppport-act, didn't get her set on tape unfortunately.

I did tape this as 24bit, and could seed that as 24bit in a few days if there's interest.

In close vicinity (as always): One Loudclapper. Three drunken housewives. One drunk dude in a cowboyhat, talking to his friends all the time.
Still turned out quite listenable.
