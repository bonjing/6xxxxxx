,marioxb,2011-08-18T15:36Z,Ok so the reason I downloaded this is because I don't have a Blu Ray player. I want to burn it to a DVD. SD quality is good enough for me. How can I convert this to DVD format? It also skips when I use VLC to play it.

,Jaxx89,2011-09-17T23:29Z,Too grainy...but thanks for the Extended cut upload
,RedPlanetEarth,2011-09-18T20:25Z,Just wondering...how can this be the Extended Cut when it's only 2h 07m? iMDB shows 2h 27m for the Extended Cut and so does my personal retailers...and so does the back cover of the extended movie...
,RedPlanetEarth,2011-09-18T20:34Z,WOW was that a fail of intelligence or what? Please ignore my comment above and sorry for fillin the field.
,BRAZILINDIA,2011-09-24T19:02Z,the movie itself is boring as heck. corny. guess making the girls in short minis  would help..lame... guess the oversexed teens would like it LOL
