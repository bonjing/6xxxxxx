Super Street Fighter IV (ã‚¹ãƒ¼ãƒ‘ãƒ¼ã‚¹ãƒˆãƒªãƒ¼ãƒˆãƒ•ã‚¡ã‚¤ã‚¿ãƒ¼ IV SÅ«pÄ SutorÄ«to FaitÄ FÅ?) is a 2010 fighting game produced by Capcom. It is an updated version of Street Fighter IV and has been said to mark the definitive end of the Street Fighter IV series.[3] Having been deemed as too large an update to be deployed as DLC, the game was made into a standalone title, but given a lower price than that of a full retail game.[4] It was released on April 27, 2010 in North America, April 28, 2010 in Japan, and April 30, 2010 in Europe for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[5] Super Street Fighter IV was released as one of the launch titles for the Nintendo 3DS, with 3D functionality, on February 26, 2011 in Japan.[6] As of March 2011, the game has sold 1.6 million units worldwide,[7] while Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition has shipped an additional 1 million copies as of April 2011.
