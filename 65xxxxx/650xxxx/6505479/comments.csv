,DarthPS3,2011-06-30T07:37Z,"There may be an extra episode 10, an MKV file, if it is there, de-select it in the download or delete it. "
,DarthPS3,2011-06-30T20:41Z,"I know this says there's no seeder, but I am here, its just an issue with the torrent. The torrent will stop downloading at 94% because I removed the extra file. ETA is about 24-48 hours for full up."
,erroneus,2011-07-02T15:48Z,"If you have all but the errant file, someone should create a new torrent."
,DarthPS3,2011-07-03T02:42Z,If they want? This is the complete file.

,danibo77,2011-07-14T11:11Z,"I usually download series like these in 3-4 hours. This one is going on it's 4th day !!! Was stuck on 85 %. 

Now, thanks to reading about the double (missing file), I deselected it and went up to 92%. But still 0-1 seeders.. crazy!"
,DarthPS3,2011-07-14T19:12Z,"Yes, sorry about the mix-up, I will re-upload this torrent at some point soon so there isn't the confusion. ARGH"

,andychad,2011-11-22T06:05Z,"The two files (ep 9 & 10) surrounding the MKV file are not finishing downloading. I'm left at 99.99% on one and 99.56% on the other. Can anyone who has those two files please, please seed?"
,DruM5,2012-02-05T07:48Z,"Any recent updates. As of now I have 16.89 of the 16.9 GBs, or 99.5%. At first I deselected the MKV file for Ep. 10, then I noticed the TS file for both Ep. 10 and 9 were stalling. Has anything been figured out?"
,DruM5,2012-02-07T05:28Z,Nobody? 
,DruM5,2012-02-28T23:58Z,"Dead. Don't bother. Couple files not fixed yet, no reply from the uploader. Few seeders. Fucked. "
