The video was obviously compressed too much from the BD...It was DVD quality but you could tell the compression was too much especially in darker areas of the movie where the blacks were not consistent and seemed blotchy.  
The compression could have been raised to a 750-800 Mb AVI and it would have made a world of difference without compromising d/l time."
[V],hiest,2011-07-10T18:48Z,"@ Bugsy_B

I am sure you can show me a better copy of movie in this size, but i bet that the file format will be mp4 or mkv.

I challenge you m8,
if you show me a better quality video in this size in avi format, then i will quit uploading my encodes in TPB."
[V],hiest,2011-07-11T01:55Z,"btw, its just a friendly challenge lol :)"
