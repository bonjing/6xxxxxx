,Hanks49,2011-06-29T02:49Z,"thanks for the post.

just a head up, this seems to be from a disc release in the incorrect aspect ratio. it wasn't shot as a 16:9 movie...proper release is due out later this year."
,amatosg,2011-07-05T02:51Z,worst movie ever...save some time watching something else
,Pap45murF,2011-07-05T08:44Z,"This is probably one of the Top 5 worst movies I've ever seen.  It's plot is a complete ripoff of a better movie.  And the last 30 minutes look like they were done in a hurry with a budget of 50 bucks.  

But thanks for the upload."

,wolftone1916,2011-08-25T23:04Z,How about everyone shut the fuck up about the content of the movie and just talk about the quality of the download itself. This site isn't a fucking movie review site. People don't come here to hear how great of a plot a movie has...
,Idubthe,2011-09-30T04:43Z,Who cares about the movie!?  Most men watch Amber Heard movies on very low volume anyway.
,ebbs123,2011-11-04T23:41Z,Downloaded ok and played on laptop but when burned to disk several times there was no volume hummmmmmmmm.
