ALL praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, the Most
Merciful, the Beneficent, and the Master of the Day of
Judgment. O Allah! Have Your Salat and Salam (peace) and
blessing upon Your slave and Messenger Muhammad and
upon all of his companions.




Have you ever tried in a moment of serenity to say sincerely, â€˜I love you, my Lord?â€™ Have you ever uttered it from the bottom of your heart? . Claims like these are very easy to make, but the real question is: do the words truly spring from the bottom of your heart? Do you love Allah The Almighty wholeheartedly? Do you love Him in such a way that your love preoccupies you from anything other than Him?
