If you dont believe in your Creator at all so How did you born? Have you ever thought about your Birth?? What was you?? Where were you a few hundred years ago?? And where will you be after you died?? Have you ever give it thought that How this universe came into existence?"

Thank You Brother for the good work. just keep it up and never let your hopes down by the bad words these people say. ALLAH is with you and He is enough for you, for me and for everyone."

I'm happy that you're happy that you have a god that makes you happy.

Just one thing, would you please mind NOT killing anybody who is not as happy as you are.

Oops!, nearly forgot, would you also please mind leaving the little girls alone until they are old enough.

There!, now we can ALL be happy!
