But, this is not a good converter.
Because the converting process takes too much time."
,bryguy450,2011-07-14T22:22Z,"Torrent works perfectly, install the software, once installed open folder where you saved the software, rename the imfc0.dll file that is currently residing in the folder to something else. Copy and paste the the new imfc0.dll file that came with the torrent into the folder. I moved the renamed file out just to prevent confusion. The finish the registration and it works perfectly!"

,Tatletz,2011-08-09T08:41Z,"Thank you for the upload rahulro! Works fine, just disconnect from the internet and install it following the instructions, then block it with your firewall and only then go online."
,dorsman,2011-08-10T08:36Z,"works perfectly I dont know what those other people are talking about.  I left my internet connected and everything.

,GSN023,2011-08-21T19:36Z,"There is no need for the crack.

If you're experiencing failed to register or could not connect to network, all you need to do is the following:

1. Delete this registry key:

HKCU\Software\Classes\Wow6432Node\CLSID\{1F7B5093-119B-4c50-B705-658A231CEC4B}

2. Find a valid serial, there's plenty of them.

3. Disconnect from the network and block Xilisoft via a firewall.

4. Input a serial along with anyname.

5. Turn of automatic updates."
,mo63090,2011-08-23T22:40Z,"This was a great and easy torrent! just open, install. After the install is complete close. Then open programs>xilisoft>mfc0.dll(delete file) and replace with the copy supplied. Then close all of the windows open. Start Xilisoft and put in what ever you want for the name and the serial.  And there you go!"
,calvin21,2011-09-22T03:53Z,"You don't have to copy the crack file!
installation for win XP (100% working)

Look for the key: {1F7B5093-119B-4c50-B705-658A231CEC4B}
Delete this key.
