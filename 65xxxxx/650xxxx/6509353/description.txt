Understanding Structural Engineering: From Theory to Practice by Wai-Fah Chen &  Salah El-Din E. El-Metwally

Product Description
In our world of seemingly unlimited computing, numerous analytical approaches to the estimation of stress, strain, and displacementâ€”including analytical, numerical, physical, and analog techniquesâ€”have greatly advanced the practice of engineering. Combining theory and experimentation, computer simulation has emerged as a third path for engineering design and performance evaluation. As a result, structural engineers working in the practical world of engineering must apply and, ideally, thrive on these idealizations of science-based theories.

Analyzing the major achievements in the field, Understanding Structural Engineering demonstrates how to bring science to engineering design. This book illustrates:
Key conceptual breakthroughs in structural engineering in the twentieth century
The science of structural engineering from basic mechanics and computing to the ultimate process of engineering design
How engineers implement theory to practice through idealizations and simplifications
Current and future trends in structural engineering

Developments and advancements in structural engineering hinge on a few key breakthroughs in concepts, simplifications and idealizations. Simplification, inherent in the art of structural engineering, is a key theme throughout this book. But the authors go further. Their clear explanations of the role and impact of new, science-based developments shows you how to put them into practice.
