,xhizors,2011-07-01T11:55Z,"other than that, thank you very much. incredibly fast  download, and quality as expected!"
,castiboy,2011-07-01T18:58Z,"there's no point in having 20MB parts for this... for starters, there's no compression, so no space gain. But mainly, it's a waste of time for everyone which could have easily been avoided, and had no reason to be in the first place.

It's not like we're downloading an 8 GB movie from free direct DL sites."
,gnawingonfoot,2011-07-01T23:59Z,"Thanks for the release!  For anybody wondering, there is no pw on the rar, and the torrent is fine.  I always get suspcious when I see things unnecessarily chopped up into .rar files.  Also, 7zip is free and open source and works much better for linux users, so if you have a legit reason for chopping up the file, please consider dumping WinRAR and  switching to 7zip in the future."
,DDJC_WPRG,2011-07-02T13:26Z,"@xhizors, @castiboy - why don't the both of you shut your fucking mouths and either download it or find something better to do with your time, like going back to fucking your dog some more!
Keep up the stupid bullshit petty bitch ass pussy comments and I will rape your computer via your mac address! Believe that!"
