How come you press harder on a remote control when you know the battery is dead? so you better seed to get speed ;)

[b]Thx Hive


CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D


Sources:
Video: Russian Relizlab
Audio: Imagines Line
thx

Encode:
The Russian video was already nice, just played with rgb and black base,
bit sharpness. Looks very good even on big tvs.
Audio was hell to clean, sounded like recorded in an empty cinema, echo
and voices not centered, fixed that, also removed noise, hiss, and cleared
the voices. Resynched Audio to my new video and fixed all 15 oos spots.
Audio is heaps better now. You will hear the difference. 
Video is also a lot better than Imagine in fast action scenes. You will
see the difference. Included 2 samples, quality and racing, so that you
can see what you get. Enjoy!

Video: 720x304 @bitrate 2000 2pass
Audio: English AC3 2.0 Stereo
Sample: yes 2 included, quality and racing[/b]
