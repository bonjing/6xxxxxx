,abernick00,2011-08-19T15:19Z,"papillon07,    yes, it IS possible!   i have an external HD with 1,000 GB of PS3 games on it, it is plugged into my 2nd usb port, and they run GREAT!    it took me awhile to sort it all out, but they are still selling ps3's with 3.55 firmware on them at Best Buy here where i live.... just make sure it is the ""Call of Duty: Black Ops"" special pack system & it will come with 3.55 so you can do the Softmod and make this possible....  you can learn all you need to know at www.ps3iso.com....   good luck!"
