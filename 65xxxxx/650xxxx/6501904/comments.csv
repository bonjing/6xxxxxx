that way you can watch the episodes in order 1-52. I dislike myself when I see episodes in the 20's and 30's being done and I can't watch until the first 5 or 10 episodes are downloaded.
so put high priority on the first episodes and less priority on the last episodes."
,rogantu,2011-06-29T12:11Z,"Torrent uploaded 28th June/Juni 2011 so if you are downloading it close to that date there might be 0 or 1 seeders. I am not having my pc on at night and then you may have to wait 4-12 hours before it starts to download.

also after you have downloade please do not delete the torrent from ur utorrent or bittorrent list.
if you leave it in the list you will help others download faster when your utorrent or bittorrent is running."
,rogantu,2011-06-29T15:06Z,"looks like you have to watch episode 52 here
http://www.animecrunch.com/medabots-episode-52-final/"
,rogantu,2011-06-29T15:08Z,the reason is the episode 52 I downloaded for this torrent did not work and I forgot to find a new one before I made it
,ComGam,2011-06-29T19:21Z,I suggest if you really wanna watch this go to bakabt.com it's private tracker that does alot of anime.
,rogantu,2011-07-01T11:59Z,"I used watchanimeon, but they seem to have 5 min previews now instead of full episodes."
,oktsme88,2011-07-14T22:14Z,Missing episode 21. Why?
,rogantu,2011-08-20T21:59Z,"FUUU there was another episode missing?
oh well whater, 50/52 is not bad, I didn't even notice 21 being gone. I just played 15-30 in 1 day and watched it, didn't look like anything missed...
my fault, sorry if anyone cared about that episode."
,Xarra,2011-08-22T03:02Z,Thanks! Downloads fine for me. I loved this show as a kid.
