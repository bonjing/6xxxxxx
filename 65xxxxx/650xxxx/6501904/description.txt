ALL 52 episodes of Medabots in high quality.
Note: this is not HD, it is better than average however, if HD is 10/10 I give this quality 7/10.

All episodes work and the quality is nice, perfect if ur rewatching the show like I did.

On a side note a few episodes seem to have a bit different audio than the rest, but after 5 minutes of watching you don't notice it.
Kinda hard to explain, but I might be the only one noticing it because of my awesome ears.
