[T],murdoc47,2011-06-29T19:17Z,as soon as possible!
[V],DownTYU,2011-06-29T20:21Z,"One suggestion---Increase RE frames and concentrate into deblocking a bit more and it will be cool.

I've downloaded 5 of ur ups and 4 of them are good.
Cheers"
,muLineZu,2011-06-29T21:07Z,"21 uploads between 16:10 to 18:13, and all big ones (not like to fit on cd...) !? Man I envy you, what band length you have... Beside the quantity, it seems that you've focused on quality movies also, at least this one's one of my all time favorites. The encoding quality is on my taste (but as you can see, you can't satisfy all of us...). Keep them coming mate, thanks for the great job!"
[T],murdoc47,2011-06-29T22:51Z,"@ DownTYU:
i don't understand deblocking. if you'd care to explain.
@ muLineZu:
i'm uploading 21 movies at this time because i've been lazy to upload them once i encoded them, so they've stacked up.. it will take some time to upload them all, my bandwidth is about 2-3 MB/s upload. i only choose good movies, i don't waste time with the rest. classics are my domain, but new ones can be classics sometime. some like them, some don't. i rarely care about opinions. but i appreciate yours. thanks"

,FRivera,2012-03-12T17:50Z,"Sorry if off-topic, but I can't find a definitive answer on Google:

Since my pc monitor is a 5 year old 19"" Samsung with max res of 1280x1024, it means it's pointless for me to get 1080p videos because they'll be downscaled anyway, right?"
[T],murdoc47,2012-03-24T20:14Z,"yes, that is correct. but it doesnt matter as long as the quality is good."
,3atwa,2012-04-14T11:10Z,"hi @murdoc47 
ur amazing i saw ur LOrd of rings 1080p rip u save our POOR bandwidth man god bless u and go forward "
[T],murdoc47,2012-04-16T16:26Z,i never ripped the LOTR
,ADCC,2012-05-28T21:11Z,"Perfect rip, A/V/M = 10/10/10. Really good quality, for such a long film (3hrs). Of course the movie itself is very old, so don't expect crystal clear picture. But the rip is perfect. I loved this movie when I first saw it. I'm so happy to finally have it in HD. Thank you so much murdoc47. "
,ADCC,2012-05-28T21:45Z,"Oh, and btw, you wrote ""i only choose good movies, i don't waste time with the rest. classics are my domain, but new ones can be classics sometime."" I think this is the right way to do it. You have my 100% support and appreciation. It is somewhat surprising that the new crap, e.g. Transformers, has so many rips, yet some classics don't even have one decent HD (under 5gb) rip. I highly recommend (and humbly ask) that you make rips of the following classics: LOTR 1&2&3 (since they are so long, you could even sacrifice up to 8gb per each: if any movie has good graphics, then it's this one), The Shawshank Redemption, Schindlers List, The Usual Suspects, Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind, Jaws, Legend (1985), Atlantis: The Lost Empire, Requiem for a Dream, The Pianist, La vita Ă¨ bella, Lawrence of Arabia, The Silence of the Lambs,... Also, I'd like to suggest that you skip the films for which there already is a good uploaded copy (eg. Inception, Saving Private Ryan, Fight Club, King Kong, Avatar, etc). There are other uploaders that also do a very good job, e.g. FASM, PeN, KiNGDOM, etc, but they don't upload the older or more rare movies. I'd very much like to hear on what you think of my suggestion. Kind and thankful regards."
[T],murdoc47,2012-06-09T23:52Z,"thanks for the appreciation and long post. here is my reply:
sorry, but i will not rip LOTR, i just don't like the trilogy. please don't hate me for it.
shawshank, usual suspects and some others you've mentioned have good rips, others like schindler (sadly) have no blu-ray release yet, la vita e bella and silence of the lambs are ripped by me (hannibal lecter is a legend!) so look more carefully in my list. some of the others i haven't seen (yet!). also, download mkv rips when choosing other rippers. kingdom rips mp4 which i dont really like (some color distorsion or i dunno..)
subscribe because i am uploading some old classics i forgot to upload months back (spoiler: the thing, citizen kane etc.)
as per your request i will try to do my best!
have fun watching these great films!"
,coldengrey,2012-06-14T22:10Z,"Can this be burned on a dvdr and keep full  resolution? Can a dvd player play 1080p video?

Will the mkv format have to obviously be converted to ???Mpg2 is that the ONLY video format dvd players can read from a dvdr?

I know these are silly questions, I'm trying to burn dvd's for father's day gifts.

Checked out videohelp website, but nothing is dead on and don't know how this videos variables will effect playability on dvd player.

Thanks..."
