thank you in advance"

what device are you using that has cinavia detection... if you are using a ps3. there is a bypass for the cinavia.. to do this you must change your audio settings to multi output. and make sure that you are using optical out as the main one (you dont actually have to have anything in the optical output. just select it.) and because its multi output sound.. it can NOT track cinavia throught the optical port.. i have no idea why.. but it works."
