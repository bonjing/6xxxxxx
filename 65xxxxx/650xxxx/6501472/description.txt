The definitive guide to the disassembly line
The Disassembly Line: Balancing and Modeling provides in-depth information on this complex process essential to remanufacturing, recycling, and environmentally conscious manufacturing. This pioneering work offers efficient techniques required to solve problems involving the number of workstations required and the disassembly sequencing of end-of-life products on the disassembly line.
In this book, the disassembly line balancing problem (DLBP) is described, defined mathematically, and illustrated by case studies. Combinatorial optimization methodologies are presented as solutions to the DLBP.
Coverage includes:
Graphical representations of products to be disassembled
Computational complexity of combinatorial problems
Description of the disassembly line and the mathematical model
Computational complexity of the DLBP
Combinatorial optimization searches
Experimental instances
Analytical methodologies
Exhaustive search
