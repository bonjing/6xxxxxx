100 PC Errors Solved | PDF | 164 pages | 5 MB
In an ideal world, computers would never crash and programs would never run into problems. Or at least, if those things did occur, your PC would notify you about any
glitches in a way that let you quickly patch things up and continue working. Uh, time to wake up. PCs run into problems all the time, and they typically respond by sending you a message that is either indecipherable or too vague to be of any use. In this issue we translate those arcane computing error messages into plain English, and we point out potential solutions to the problem. Use this issue as a handy reference for
whenever you encounter PC errors.
