,D.u.b.i.o.u.s,2012-05-30T06:55Z,"This is a rip of the unrated extended cut Blu-ray. However; you won't actually notice a difference from what you may have seen in the cinema, etc. Because the extras come in the form of bonus content which is separate from the main feature. The quality of the rip is excellent, and, imo, the movie is superb."
,BaneSerbia,2012-06-15T23:37Z,Top quality! Thanks a lot!
