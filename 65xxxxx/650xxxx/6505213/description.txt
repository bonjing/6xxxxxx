Quote:
The Red Scorpion gang has terrorized the countryside for months, and its members have been the culprits behind many of Usagiâ€™s recent adventures. In this issue, Usagi finally faces the Red Scorpion himself! But defeating both the Scorpion and the mercenaries at his side may be too much even for the rabbit ronin.
