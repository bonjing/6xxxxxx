
The four-man heavy metal combo from Germany named Running Wild was formed in the mid-'70s by vocalist and guitarist Rolf Kasparak -- the only continuing member of the group -- plus guitarist Preacher, bassist Stephan and drummer Hasche. The group cut their first demos in 1982 and signed to Noise Records for debut album Gates of Purgatory. A support slot for MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e in 1986 gave Running Wild a leg up on other European metal bands, and they toured America soon after. The 1987 album Under Jolly Roger broke the group with metal audiences across the world, employing an outlandish pirate image in keeping with the title. Lineup changes continued, but the band soldiered on, recording regularly through the mid-'90s despite changing attitudes in the music world which pushed heavy metal underground again during that period.

German power metallers Running Wild played their farewell show at the 2009 edition of Wacken Open Air festival, which was held July 30 - August 1, 2009 in Wacken, Germany. The band's July 30, 2009 "best-of" performance was filmed and recorded for an upcoming DVD and CD.

"The Final Jolly Roger" will released on June 24 via Golden Core/Zyx and will be made available as a double CD, separate DVD or a special "deluxe" three-disc box set comprised of the other two formats packaged together. (http://www.metalrage.com/links/368/click.html).
