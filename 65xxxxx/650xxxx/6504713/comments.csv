LAST TIME I INSTALLED WINDOWS 7 ULTIMATE and TRIED TO ACTIVATE IT USING LOADER 1.6.9 by Daz, I ENCOUNTER A PROBLEM WHEN IT RESTARTED. IT DID NOT BOOT UP. THE OS GOT CORRUPTED. SO SAD!

IS IT THE BIOS? OR THE LOADER HAS PROBLEM? THANKS"
,DoEds07,2011-07-17T03:53Z,"It's not working for me.
I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit (6.1 Build 7601).

This is what i've done.

1. Ran the application and clicked ""Uninstall"" button.
2. Restarted PC.
3. Ran the application and clicked ""Install"" button.
- Not working. So i tried another time.
1. Ran the application and clicked ""Uninstall"" button.
2. Restarted PC.

Good luck.

@DoEds07
Go to:
http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate
And validate your copy after installing the loader.
Good luck."
,Etrnl,2011-12-01T07:30Z,"After activating Windows 7 Ultimate with vers 2.0.4 it ran ok for about 3 days. Then after the Windows update file KB971033 got installed, my OS is now being flagged as  not genuine. I tried uninstalling and re-installing as suggested in your Read me file, but  activation doesnt work anymore :(
What should I do?"
