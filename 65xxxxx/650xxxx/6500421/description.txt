srry about slow upload speed

I've tested single player (very rare crashes) and multiplayer (works with lan not sure about online)

apparently I found out that single player can run without steam being on (haven't confirmed)

1.download steam from the website if you don't already have it

2.extract the archive (using 7z or the newer version of Winrar)

3.if you don't already have smart steam install just copy everything in the extracted folder (steamapps and the smart steam files)

if you have smart steam then just copy the steamapps

4.paste it into your steam folder (default C:\Program Files\Steam)

5.open smart steam and play using smart steam (open the game in smart steam)

note: if you played already there may be a chance that you will lose your save (I used this on my brother's computer and he didn't lose his save)

Note2: the first time you play expect the game to crash (as in don't be suprized) 

Note3: I've had rare cases where the game crashed not during the first run, don't worry just open the game again

credit to the people who made the two cracks that I used 
and to the person who hosted the SteamCracked-P2P version of the game
