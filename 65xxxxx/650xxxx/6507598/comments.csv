Seriously Thank You for the Current TV Program ""Olberman"".

I have a request of...everyone..but obviously of ANYONE with Access to ""Current TV"":

""VANGUARD"".

Please..Please..Please..Puh-Lease.

Especially the ""Oxycontin Express"" and all its ""Follow-Ups"" and ""Sub-Programs"".

REALLY Interesting and Surprisingly well done. I was in a Bar when one episode was on..I do not have cable..and so Cannot see the rest of this ""Series"" on the New Drug Pipelines out of Florida and..it looks..GREAT!

Also..this is a Straight-Up ""Torrent Challenge"" I have Been Unable to find..ANY..Torrents of this Series ""Vanguard"". They simply don't exist.

If I had Access to cable? They WOULD Exist. But..sigh..I do not.

So..Please..Anyone Out There..""Vanguard"".

Please and Thank you in Advance.

(Of course if someone has a link to a torrent I have missed in my many searches? Please Post The Link and thank you for that as well.)"
