Cam Design Handbook: Dynamics and Accuracy by Harold Rothbart

Product Description
The cam, used to translate rotary motion into linear motion, is an integral part of many classes of machines, such as printing presses, textile machinery, gear-cutting machines, and screw machines. Emphasizing computer-aided design and manufacturing techniques, as well as sophisticated numerical control methods, this handbook allows engineers and technicians to utilize cutting edge design tools. It will decrease time spent on the drawing board and increase productivity and machine accuracy.

* Cam design, manufacture, and dynamics of cams
* The latest computer-aided design and manufacturing techniques
* New cam mechanisms including robotic and prosthetic applications (20040601)
