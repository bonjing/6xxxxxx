,Whobuysgames,2011-06-29T21:11Z,"nevermind, forgot to through the .DLLs in, works now :D"
,Whobuysgames,2011-06-29T21:21Z,"but still cannot play, the single player mission buttons remained greyed out"
,shana00,2011-06-30T07:21Z,"No need for DLL-s, just follow instructions, press X when connecting to conflux"

,Antiga,2011-07-02T01:45Z,"This does not work. The new Might & Magic Heroes VI â Internal Private Closed Beta.exe results in black screen, just like uncracked version."
,me_pirate,2011-07-02T12:43Z,"hi,
thank you for the provided link to the game, i would like to learn about the way to build a crack for games and soft, etc, but i dont know from where to start, so is there somebody that can help me to give me the name of some books or internet links, or something else from where to begin^???"

Yes, you can search a book in library, it's called '' The Book Of Crack """
,facess,2011-07-02T22:12Z,Doesn't work for me either. Black Screen only.

hey guys, do i necessarely need to be connected to the internet to launch the game??"
,loadstone007,2011-07-04T13:06Z,Doesn't work. I get a black screen and see the Heroes cursor. Nothing else.
,Cwebb12345,2011-07-04T17:34Z,"@loadstone007 You need to install the ubisoft game loader, it should be in the setup directory you downloaded."
,loadstone007,2011-07-04T21:15Z,^ What are you talking about? You mean the game launcher? The nfo didn't mention any of this. Can you please post a step by step instructions how to run the game with this crack? Thnx
,loadstone007,2011-07-04T21:18Z,"^ The game launcher was installed when I first installed the game. In this crack I just need to update twice the game, overwrite some files and it should work. But it doesn't.

If you know how to make it work, please post step by step instructions. It will really help.

Thanks"
,Cwebb12345,2011-07-04T23:26Z,"@Loadstone007
I uninstalled the game and the ubisoft game launcher and reinstalled both when I got the same problem as you. After that I followed the instructions in readme and it all worked. If you get it working can you tell me if you can access conflux?"
,loadstone007,2011-07-05T08:42Z,"I got it to work by re-using the old crack that came with the original game release. The game runs, but it seems to crash really fast while playing.
I'll try your method and let you know if it worked."
,loadstone007,2011-07-05T09:29Z,"Ok, now I got it to work with this crack. Here's how:
1. Install the game using the original release, but DO NOT use the crack supplied in that release.
2. Run twice the 'gu.exe' file to update the game to 1.02. The game will try to start after each update. Don't worry when it fails.
3. Copy the files supplied in this 1.2 crack release to the proper dirs (it will overwrite existing files).
4. Run the game via the Heroes VI file (not the game launcher). It will ask for Ubisoft user and password. Enter them, or create one if you don't have it.
5. After successful login, the game will ask for beta serial number. Just write a few letters (I wrote 'dsfsdf'), and continue. It will switch to a different screen.
6. Click 'Play'. When the game loads, it will try to connect to Conflux. Just click the 'X' at the top right.

* Note that the game tends to crash. A lot."

,vitiss,2011-07-11T12:40Z,"i got this problem - when pressing the game .exe, this windows shows up, with the picture like ""i'm loading, you bitch"" and immediately stops. my Windows7 says that the programm was stopped blablabla. what i can do?"
,BlaZe4323,2011-07-16T23:20Z,THERE IS NO CRACK WORKING for this beta version
,apocolyps6,2011-07-27T06:46Z,"I did everthing, nit the single player campaign does not work, and i do not know how to start a skirmish. It wont let me crearte a ""main hero"" or anything"
,elenabaju,2011-07-28T13:19Z,NOT WORKING!!! PLS HELP
,wizyy,2011-07-30T04:55Z,"Following loadstone007 and Anand_C_S instructions, I was able to start single player campaign. I updated game twice, and it patched without any error messages. I'm halfway through first scenario in tutorial campaign, and the game didn't crash even once.
Only serious glitch is that when you alt+tab out and back into the game, game seem to be working, but there is only black screen on my AMD radeon card, so ""end process"" was needed."
,zior,2011-08-17T09:01Z,"Hi
The crack is working allright but in the game there are some strange things - like you can only play multiplayer with Heaven, Necropolis and Sanctuary. No way of playing for Inferno or the Horde.
Is it normal? Or is it some way to fix it?"
,alex_costin89,2011-08-21T00:15Z,"IF U GET the error message saying you need to verify your connection when clicking gu.exe, you have to go to C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc and delete or cut the ""hosts"" file"
,tonsky,2011-09-03T20:04Z,"This thing worked for me, but you should update (gu.exe) non-cracked game, just after normal installer. Also I could run homm.exe only from administrator. But it works (and craches sometimes)."
