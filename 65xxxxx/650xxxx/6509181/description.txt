	Release Notes
	who the fuck uses cds anymore ? so we have provided a merge device we quickly made
	for the people who can spend that extra 50p on blank dvds all you have to do is unrar the release
	from 2 folders and put them into the same folder as the exe file and it will merge it into 1 release(rawnitro-rio-xvid-merged).
