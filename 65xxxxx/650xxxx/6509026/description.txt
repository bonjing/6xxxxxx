    When her wild younger sister Ashley, who suffers from bipolar            
    disorder and drug addiction, goes missing, Libba Phillips pours all      
    her time and energy into finding Ashley and bringing her home. As the    
    years go by, Libba refuses to give up hope, and, at the expense of       
    her marriage and career, Libba finds her calling in life: creating a     
    much-needed resource center for other families whose missing loved       
    ones have fallen through the cracks.
