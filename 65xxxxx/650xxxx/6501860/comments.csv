,offlabeluse2,2011-12-02T16:07Z,??? What is this ???
,offlabeluse2,2011-12-06T18:42Z,"Doesn't work, zip file brings up 'Error: Access Denied"" on BitComet, uTorrent, etc etc etc, even with A/V temporarily disabled."
,chaioth,2011-12-09T10:27Z,Works perfectly fine for me! Don't trust people who down on torrents like this-- they could be working for sketchy organizations. It's a library of interesting content.
,chaioth,2011-12-09T10:28Z,It is also courteous to seed and share with other parties of interested peeps.
,Ahofmann,2012-01-05T16:21Z,"Tried it, didn't work.

I'm with offlabeluse2...spent a good couple of days downloading this poorly seeded piece of shit...for nothing. Nada. Zilch. Nothing.

Thanks 'Anonymous' for posting this floater.

Given that there's no description of the files contained within...and that anyone can publicly DL the information (of their choice!) from erowid, etc, I see no reason to seed a non-functioning, shittily constructed torrent, just because I was stupid enough to fall for it.

Esp if it's some simplistic honey pot from the DEA or whatever. I mean, what's the point?

Go ahead and waste your bandwidth...like it matters one way or the other?"
,Ahofmann,2012-01-05T16:22Z,"Zip file. Doesn't unpack.

Garbage."
,sunflowereyes,2012-01-12T15:37Z,Works for me. Use 7-zip.
,sunflowereyes,2012-01-13T06:10Z,please seed!
