 Ben is outraged by the introduction of timecards at work, so he takes a stand 
 by forming a union - but his boss Mr Griffith responds by making him a tempting
 offer. Susan prepares for her audition to become a children's TV presenter but
 is surprised to discover her main rival is Janey.

  to tennis.
