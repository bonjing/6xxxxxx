,weclipse,2012-06-02T20:34Z,"How to install on Mac:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Download ""Wineskin Winery"" to create Wine wrappers

2. Open ""rct3p-rld.7z.001"" in BetterZip or similar Zipping program (Do NOT use Archive Utility!)

3. Mount ""rct3p-rld .iso"" using standard Disk Image Mounter

4. Create a wrapper in Wineskin

5. Install the ""Gecko"" Package, this allows HTML embedding inside your application.

Note: All wrappers are created in ""/Users//Applications/Wineskin""

6. Open your wrapper, select ""Advanced"" when window appears

7. Go to your wrapper, right-click it, choose ""Show Package Contents"", go to the alias names ""drive_c"", in there, go to ""Program Files"", in the rct.iso, drag ""Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 Platinum"" folder to the ""Program Files"" folder inside your wrapper.

8. In the windows that appears, under ""Windows EXE"", click browse, and inside the ""drive_c"" folder, navigate to ""Program Files/Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 Platinum"", and choose ""RCT3plus.exe"".

9. If you want to, you can have the RCT3 Panda icon for your wrapper, just find an image and convert it to "".icns"".

10. Just close the ""Wineskin Advanced"" window and your done! Double click your wrapper and now you can play Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 Platinum on Mac! :D

Note: You first need to install an engine in Wineskin before using, just click the ""+"" and choose one you want, I recommend ""WS9Wine1.5.5"" or ""WS8WineCX11.0.0""

Have fun!

,weclipse,2012-06-02T20:36Z,"Whoops, made a mistake in my previous comment:

The location of wrappers is:

""/Users/(Your Username)/Applications/Wineskin"""
,freakyferret,2012-06-13T09:27Z,"Great upload, fast too.
One problem though, I'm doing the tutorials and I got to the fireworks part and when I have to open the mix master display there's nothing in it. I can't finish this tutorial. Any ideas?"
