dospiedras1973, has released a method he has been working on for 2 months to downgrade 265mb NAND PS3s,
aka Phat PS3's from firmware 3.6x. His method requires fancy flashing,
and the use of the Infectus mod chip for PS3â€¦so it requires soldering skills and is no â€œeasy featâ€.
This also fixes the Waninkoko brick that many people had issues with a while back.


PS3's compatible with this method (thanks pdnked)
Fat PS3:
CECH = 256MB
CECHB = 256MB
CECHC = 256MB
CECH = 256MB
CECHG = 256MB


            !!! Warning !!!

         It`s on your own risk
