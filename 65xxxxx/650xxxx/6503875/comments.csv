,ILoveTsundere,2011-06-30T00:54Z,Reported for not vidya
,hasser_,2011-07-01T18:19Z,"Ignore the dummy ""ILoveTsundere"" above me, spouting old memes. Thanks for the upload, works great. BTW, don't use appLocale, it doesn't work properly on Windows 7. Just set non-unicode to Japanese, and reboot, and it should work."
,NeutralGold,2011-07-02T07:08Z,"applocale works fine on win7, you just have to disable UAC to get it installed and make sure it runs with Admin rights.. :P"

,azek95,2011-07-05T09:41Z,"Looks good.
Definitely vidya."
,SmileSeal,2011-07-07T20:24Z,"Thank you.
This game' more fun than I expected
Monster Lord's so hot ^_^"
,sloppies1,2011-07-09T22:10Z,"Eh too bad I got pretty far into it, game crashed and upon restart all the save files were gone. Great game though."
,Firengun,2011-07-10T01:59Z,"I've got a little problem, the game always crashes at the same spot where i'm fighting the first monster or ""slime girl""
Anyone got anything?"
[V],harry711,2011-07-10T02:28Z,"@Firengun: Yes. Properly follow the instructions in the README, and it will work fine. That error happens when your system isn't setup properly for the game."
,Skykingryu,2011-07-10T08:40Z,The game keeps crashing when the godess talks to me before the first fight can anyone help me?
,Atlantique1,2011-07-10T11:05Z,You need to actually follow the instructions. I'm already at the end of the 75% english patch.
,Skykingryu,2011-07-11T00:12Z,i did follow them it still does it but i suppose ill try again
,Atlantique1,2011-07-11T06:25Z,You have to change your non-Unicode to Japanese. Then it will work.
,Nuclearmy,2011-07-12T03:03Z,"When i downloaded this game i counted on some random mindless hentai. But it turned out that i tought wrong, it's far better! I recommend it ^^

Granberia ftw!"
,sloppies1,2011-07-13T19:30Z,"Actually just follow the read-me and you won't cratch. Just got to the end of this one's english patch, very very nice :)"
,Sothe,2011-07-14T13:42Z,Confirmed for /d/ game of the month.
[V],harry711,2011-07-23T00:30Z,"100% translation released. Repacked with the full translation stuff:
