The game is ~50% translated to English, and nearing completion in hopefully a few weeks. It's quite a long game, so you will be able to play for several hours before you get anything untranslated. Even then it's just a simple Hentai game, so you can make most of the story up!

Notes: you need your non-Unicode language set to Japanese.

Windows 7: Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Region and Language\: then "Administrative", then set "Language for non-Unicode programs" to "Japanese (Japan)", then restart your computer.
Windows XP: AppLocale should work. I don't use this OS, so give it a whirl (it should work), or upgrade to W7.



Anyways, enjoy, and seed please!
