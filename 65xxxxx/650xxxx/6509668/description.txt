No other Mississippi Bluesman wore more musical hats than the late Guitar and Keyboard Legend Mel Brown (1939-2009). In a career that spanned 55 years, Mel recorded with T-Bone Walker, B.B. King, Bobby Blue Bland, John Lee Hooker, Snooky Pryor, Billy Boy Arnold, Johnny Otis, Lightning Hopkins, Albert Collins, as well as with Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson in Nashville, plus Bobby Darin, Bill Cosby and Sonny & Cher in Hollywood. His 5 Solo LPâ€™s recorded for ABC Impulse/Bluesway between 1967 â€“ 72, are now prized collectorâ€™s items, and his Electro-Fi Records debut "Neck Bones & Caviar" won the prestigious 2000 W.C. Handy Award as "Blues Comeback Album of the Year". 
"Love, Lost and Found" is Mel Brownâ€™s Final Studio Recording completed shortly before his passing in 2009, with unreleased tracks from Special Guests: SNOOKY PRYOR, SAM MYERS, MISS ANGEL and ENRICO CRIVELLARO, itâ€™s nothing less than the stellar last chapter in the Musical Legacy of a man LIVING BLUES Magazine described as â€œ One of the Finest Electric Blues Guitarists in the Worldâ€.
