In November 1977, after completing a 6 month world tour, Rory Gallagher and his band flew straight from their last show in Japan to San Francisco to begin working on a new album, with famed American producer Elliot Mazer (Neil Young â€“ 'Harvest', Janis Joplin â€“ 'Cheap Thrills', The Band â€“ 'The Last Waltz'). Mazer recalls that the sessions grew â€œtenseâ€, as Gallagher wasnâ€™t happy with the mixing process, describing them as â€œtoo complicatedâ€, and by the end of January 1978 he shelved the whole record and broke up his band of the past 5 years.

Fast forward to 2010 and Roryâ€™s brother and manager, DÐ±nal, allowed his son & Roryâ€™s nephew, Daniel, to recover the album from the Gallagher archive and begin the process of mixing it with his engineer. Rory said in 1992 he hoped the album would surface one day but only if it were remixed and now we finally get to hear this never before issued studio album from a key period of Gallagherâ€™s career, an album that would have been released between â€˜Calling Cardâ€™ and â€˜Photo Finishâ€™. This is truly a â€˜Holy Grailâ€™ release for Roryâ€™s fans.

CD 2 is also another fabulous discovery, a blistering live album taken from four nights at The Old Waldorf, San Francisco December 1979. In the audience Van Morrison, on stage Rory Gallagher (guitar/vocals), Gerry McAvoy (bass) and Ted McKenna (drums).

Daniel Gallagher chose to add the live side to highlight why Rory chose to shelve the studio album and reduce his band back down to a three piece. As Rory often said he wanted to get back to â€˜meat and potatoes rock & rollâ€™.
