 From the moment Parliament s P-Funk Wants To Get Funked 
 Up erupts over the opening of YOUNG SOUL REBELS, we     
 know we re in for a wild ride. The changes keep coming  
 as an interracial sex act in the bushes turns into a    
 murder, setting off a police investigation and waves of 
 controversy in London s black community. The year is    
 1977, and while some people are busy getting ready to   
 celebrate Queen Elizabeth s Silver Jubilee, others have 
 more important things on their minds. Punks and Teds,   
 National Front and Natty Dreads are fighting in the     
 streets, and the authorities seem more interested in    
 harassing the victim s friends than in solving the      
 crime. A riveting look at the forces of race, class and 
 sex that reshaped the U.K. just before the Thatcher     
 years, Isaac Julien s breakthrough film, which won the  
 1991 Critics Week Prize at Cannes, is as exciting as    
 ever today. Directed by Isaac Julien and starring       
 Valentine Nonyela, Mo Sesay, Dorian Healy, Frances      
 Barber, Sophie Okonedo.
