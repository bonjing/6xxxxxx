As it was exactly the same .avi, I have copied and pasted to this file and changed the name to accept it. So now we have 98.6% of this torrent. The only thing I couldnt get was the sample. So when you download this, you wont get any more than the 98.6% unless someone comes back and seeds for us. But you will get the complete movie .avi, just not the sample."
