thx for ur support and help bro, much appreciated :)

@Supcena
:D

@BSB
I'm trying to provide good quality movies in least possible size, though hi-bitrate increases the quality and size, lol
For some xtra ordinary movies, I'm doing 720p, too, hope you fine :)
thx

@agent
Currently I'm working on some requests, I'll try to do them, coz Ran didn't get many hits, 
I'm okay for a dead commercial movie torrent, but it makes me sad when these kinda classics become dead torrents, :(

@sawjuk & vishu
Will try mate :)"

,sinner77,2011-06-29T16:53Z,"@Backstreetboy

Hv 2 disagree mate.It is the  size which separates Stylish frm other uploaders.....n the qlty is also very gud.
So i think there is no need currently to increase the size of his rips"

,agent000,2011-06-29T19:39Z,"@StyLishSaLH

i think u noticed that Bedevilled is a recent one (2010)... no small file available... not even 1GB :("
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-06-30T06:20Z,"@agent
all are with hardcoded subs, I dont prefer doing them, I'll try anyways :)"
,agent000,2011-06-30T15:25Z,"@StyLishSaLH

i know... but its Korean anyway... hardcoded won't be a problem at all... :)"

,ramalan,2011-07-03T05:04Z,"Unfortunately, very pixelated as soon as there is movement. But that's no wonder at such filesize."

,phobiafd,2011-07-07T18:55Z,"Thanks so much for all of your great torrents! I really appreciate it!

If you have time could you upload Season Of The Witch 2011"
,honestpirate,2011-07-08T04:12Z,"V=10
A=10 
great quality!"
,dragonballz,2011-07-23T16:22Z,"@Stylishslash: Thanks for small sizes and please do not listen to BSB. We are on 128kbps and we do NOT want movies bigger than 400mb. However if you can reduce the size to 300-350mb range it may be better.

@BSB: We disagree with you. We do not want 500mb movies. We want 300mb movies. OK."
