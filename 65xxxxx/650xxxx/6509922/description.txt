Video : Relizlab v1 & v2 ...............Thanks

Audio : SpankMySeedBox ...................Thanks m8



Only reason for the readnfo is to state that joined the v1 & v2 to add the missing minutes so its complete

Resized and filtered the 1st 13mins but never did a great deal with v2 just a few touches then joined the 2 then the damn thing went outta sync by 700ms so had to bring it back and thats about it was it worth it no but someone might want this while we wait for better



Enjoy
