,XLantzX,2011-07-04T18:06Z,So I just have to drag this into my minecraft folder?
,miguelsz3,2011-07-04T18:31Z,............No? You drag it into your minecraft.jar using winrar. Did you even read the instructions?!?
,koopatroopa_15,2011-07-04T18:49Z,"This actually works quite well (^_^)

It is important that you don't use winrar,winzip,7zip etc etc to actually EXTRACT the minecraft.jar file. Just use them to OPEN it. From that window you can delete the ""META-INF"" folder. Then just copy the Vu.class file to the open window. Works perfect thanks so much !"
,RewindFishwalk,2011-07-06T14:37Z,Works 100%

,afonsanho,2011-09-04T01:10Z,does it work with mods?
,miguelsz3,2011-09-04T18:54Z,"@afonsanho
It should... I've installed Bunches of mods and as far as I know none have ever conflicted with ""Vu.class""."
