- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

Here's the third full length from this great pop rock band. When I got their
last one, judging by the look of these guys I thought it'd be shit, but it
turned out to be insanely catchy. This one is crack for the ears as well, so
pick it up for your gf when it's really for you.
