,viruselworm,2011-07-02T18:59Z,"Hello, I have a few questions before downloading and installing this version of Windows:

1. Does this torrent work?
2. Is it virus free?
3. Do I need internet access for Windows to activate? (I am asking this because I am planning to install it on a machine which is not connected to the internet)
4. Where can I get an activator from if the program cannot activate by itself?"
