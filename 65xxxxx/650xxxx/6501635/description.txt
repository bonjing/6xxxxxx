This is BERSERK, the one and only cult fantasy/drama/horror anime, 
based on the celebrated original manga by Kentarou Miura.

Due to the lack of torrent versions of Berserk for convenient storage on a single DVD, I personally converted these episodes from the "a4e" torrent release. All 25 episodes are around 170 mb in High Quality MP4 format and WILL fit onto a single DVD. The dub is original japanese with english subs hardcoded. Go elsewhere for the english dub. 

I have many custom 1DVD convertions of classic animes to share if this torrent goes well. Feel free to comment.

KEEP THE SEEDING ALIVE.
