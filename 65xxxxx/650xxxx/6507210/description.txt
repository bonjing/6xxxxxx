After the relatively anonymous album \"On Through the Night\" and \"High \'n\' Dry\" was released in what would be the big breakthrough for Def Leppard - \"Pyromania\". The album set a standard for how a lot of melodic hard rock would have come. Producer Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, polished sound and vocal harmonies are layered over the sharp guitars and intense drums. The incredible success of the album was the band on the bed in total. \"Pyromania\" remains a very rich album influences.
