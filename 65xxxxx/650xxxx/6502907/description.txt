                              The Complete Season 5


When strange anomalies in time start to appear all over England, Professor Cutter and his team have to help track down and capture all sorts of dangerous prehistoric creatures from Earth's distant past.

Series 4 begins (introduced by a webisode prologue) with Lester now reporting to an industrialist, and with a new team leader, Matt Anderson. Abby and Connor return and have to win back their places on the team.

Series 5 picks it up right where series 4 left us. The plot around Matt, Philip (the industrialist) and their role in the â€œbeginning of the endâ€ evolves into the main arc of the show.

The series gets better and better IMHO â€“ I really hope thereâ€™ll be a series 6!
