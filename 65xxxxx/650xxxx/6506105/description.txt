Fucked Up, ett av vÃ¥r tids mest vitala punkband, Ã¤r inte rÃ¤dda fÃ¶r nya utmaningar. Bandet fÃ¶ljer upp sin Polaris-vinnande genombrottsskiva The Chemistry of Common Life med tredje albumet David Comes To Life - en rockopera som flÃ¤tar samman bandets fÃ¶rkÃ¤rlek till brittisk indiepop och energiska riff och kanaliserar energin frÃ¥n sÃ¥vÃ¤l Angus Young, Pete Townshend och Noel Gallagher till Bob Stinson och Lyle Preslar.
