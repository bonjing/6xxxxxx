â€¢ During installation, Data Packages should be installed in these directories, if they install to any other location by default. target folder for local data packages can be changed in the installation wizard manually

â€¢ Software downgrade with Tucson system is only possible for BB 5.0 products supporting the Data Package 2 concept.

â€¢ If you install old DCT-4 data packages, Flash Update Package File installation path may be wrong. This is caused by very old DCT-4 data packages which contain Flash Update Package and overwrite current information during installation. If you experience problems when updating FPS-x prommers, please check that Phoenix â€œPrommer maintenanceâ€ is loo"
