A quick-tempered, flamboyantly-dressed,     
retired hit-man returns to India for one    
last job. Just don't call him "Buddah"      
                                            
BBUDDAH HOGA TERRA BAAP has the 69-year-    
old Bachchan enacting the role of a defiant,
flamboyant hitman in his inimitable style.  
With BBUDDAH HOGA TERRA BAAP, the angry     
young man of the 1970s and 1980s re-surfaces
to re-live various roles that he enacted in 
those memorable films. This one's a masala  
film all the way. Right from a medley of    
Bachchan hits to the expertly crafted action
sequences to the by-now-famous Bachchan     
baritone, this one has it all.
