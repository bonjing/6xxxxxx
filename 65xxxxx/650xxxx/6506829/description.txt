My Mother Diana (Documentary)

My Mother Diana looks at how Princess Diana's life and her relationship with the House of Windsor, the media and the public have shaped her eldest son, Prince William. When a 20-year-old Lady Diana Spencer married Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, their wedding at St Paul's was watched by billions; it was the last great royal wedding to galvanise the British public.
