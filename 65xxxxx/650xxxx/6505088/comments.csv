All seasons + extras DVDRip. This is being uploaded from a 1 Gig Broadband connection. You will get priority on the files once you have uploaded the previous piece so increase your upload rate and this will fly.

Enjoy

[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-07-03T22:24Z,Don't know. Download subs from your usual places and change the file name to match the episode name.

,Wetmouse2,2011-10-30T06:43Z,"""After Stargate Atlantis was canceled, the show's co-creators began working on the already conceptualized Stargate Universe which the network had approved to have a bigger budget, be less mythology dependent, and have more focus on character development.""

That's just a fancy way of saying SciFi wanted Stargate Galactica. Be careful what you ask for, you might just alienate fans of the most successful SciFi show of all time and create an unwatchable and soon-to-be-canceled show."
