Synopsis

The Weight Of Chains presents a Canadian perspective[citation needed] on Western involvement in the division of the ethnic groups within Yugoslavia and argues that the war was forced from outside, while regular people wanted peace. However, according to the author of the film, extreme fractions on all sides, fuelled by their foreign mentors, outvoiced the moderates and even ten years after the last conflict the hatred remains and people continue spreading myths of what really happened in the 1990s.

This film also presents positive stories from the war â€“ people helping each other regardless of their ethnic background, stories of bravery and self-sacrifice. Archival footage was provided by Radio Television Serbia.
