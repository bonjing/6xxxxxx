Distributed with every copy of Python, the standard library contains hundreds of
modules that provide tools for interacting with the operating system, interpreter, and
Internet. All of them are tested and ready to be used to jump start the development of
your applications. This book presents selected examples demonstrating how to use the
most commonly used features of the modules that give Python its â€œbatteries includedâ€
slogan, taken from the popular Python Module of the Week (PyMOTW) blog series.
