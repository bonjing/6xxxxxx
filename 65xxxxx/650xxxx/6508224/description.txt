IMDB Info

Kenneth (who likes to call himself Kay) begins to realise he's just another
wannabe bad boy... even less than a loser in fact. After quitting his job at
Laimsbury's, Kay vows to become a respected gangster... or cry trying.
A pulls-no-punches, coming-of-age story, centering on one directionless hopeless
"shotter", who finds his true worth in the face of urban adversity.
