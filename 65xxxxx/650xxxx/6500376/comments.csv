Nice design, I guess, but I found it very confusing, EXTREMELY SLOW - 10 min a gigabyte or something, ERROR PRONE - it lost one of my folders - Gone - ERASED.  AND, being from the USB Secure folks, my guess is they'd have busted the license - ""trial expired"" ""uninstall.""  

STORAGECRYPT, here on PirateBay - AWESOME.  As fast as USB Secure, as simple, as easy...  STORAGECRYPT STORAGECRYPT...!!!

If I find problems, I'll let you know."
