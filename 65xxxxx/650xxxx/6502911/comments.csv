,mat459,2011-07-18T21:19Z,"Video is nice and bright. Not too dark like other TS movies. Looks like it was shot  from the far right side of the theater though. The audio is terribly out of sync and gets worse throughout the movie. Not a true TS copy, but 1 of the better copies on TPB right now. 

Video: 7/10
Audio: 2/10"
,mat459,2011-07-18T21:19Z,^ these ratings are compared to other TS movies.
