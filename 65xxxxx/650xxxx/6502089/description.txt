Counter-Strike: Source by Valve Cyber CafÃ© Program.

Counter-Strike: Source (officially abbreviated CSS is an FPS video game developed by Valve Cyber CafÃ© Program.
It is a complete remake of Counter-Strike using the Source game engine. As in the original,
 Counter-Strike: Source pits a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists
in a series of rounds. Each round is won either by completing an objective
 (such as detonating a bomb or rescuing hostages) or by eliminating all membersof the opposing team.

Gameplay

Counter-Strike: Source is a remake of Counter-Strike, and consequently retains its team-based
 objective-oriented first-person shooter style gameplay. 
The aim of playing a map is to accomplish a map's objective. 
There are many types of objectives that a map can have, but the ultimate goal of the game 
is to win more rounds than the opposing team, which is accomplished 
by fulfilling the map's winning conditions. Some winning conditions include 
defusing a bomb, rescuing all the hostages, or killing all the members of the opposing team. 
When playing on a server without respawns, if players are killed, they do not respawn until the next round, 
unlike in many other first-person shooter games, where players respawn instantly or after a short delay. 
Moving and shooting also differs noticeably from many other first-person shooters. 
Shooting while moving dramatically decreases accuracy, and holding the trigger down to continuously 
shoot will generally produce severe push-back. This can be difficult for beginning players 
to compensate for because the player's crosshair does not correspond with where the bullets actually 
hit during continuous fire, so beginning players may aim too high during automatic fire. 
The amount of damage done by a hit varies dramatically depending upon the body part the bullet hits, 
with great emphasis on hitting the enemy's head, which is almost invariably lethal.
