This is clean Pech. No Virus, Worms and other sheet in it.

Remember this: A  PATCH CAN'T BE LARGER THAN 60 MB IN SIZE!
IF IT'S LARGER THAN 60MB SIZE, THAN IT'S FULL WHITH MALWARE.
There are other Patch's OF 100mb size AND MORE THINK ABOUT THAT.

I will  upload next patch when Valve release new update.

Leave some post."
