Here are three resources on the topic of Buddhism and ecology.

"Buddhism as Ecology" is a 25-minute audio by the Rev. Don Castro of the Buddhist Churches of America (Jodo Shinshu tradition). It can be found on the Internet as a strange, rather distracting video. I find this audio-only version easier to deal with,

Green Dharma is a PDF from www.traditionalyogastudies.com, full of useful information and ideas. It is not the book of the same title that I knew back in the seventies. I can find no evidence now that that the earlier book ever existed.

Mountain Silence, issue 8, is a PDF magazine dedicated to "Buddhist perspectives on ecology."
