,blkhu,2011-07-21T09:34Z,I have to complain that I believe 3.4mbps bitrate wouldn't have only 4GB.
[T],murdoc47,2011-07-22T11:53Z,that's only the video. the audio at 640 kbps adds up to dvd size
,ozzman39,2011-09-03T21:56Z,is this the skynet edition or original ? i cant find the original anywhere 
,ozzman39,2011-09-03T22:08Z,is this the standard edition or the Skynet edition i cant find the standard anywhere 
[T],murdoc47,2011-09-04T20:21Z,"this is the director's cut, which is like the original, but with a few added scenes which explain some of the backgrounds. it has the same night driving ending like the original cut, unlike the skynet edition, which has the alternate ""no machine war"" ending. after having watched the original like 10 times and this one (again, dir. cut) about 2 times, i think you should give the director's cut a chance. like alien 2.. (same dir)"
,ozzman39,2011-09-04T23:03Z,thanks for the reply :) iv have both versions on DVD i just prefer the original cut 
[T],murdoc47,2011-09-05T07:51Z,i don't think you'll find it in a 1080p rip. but let me know if you do
