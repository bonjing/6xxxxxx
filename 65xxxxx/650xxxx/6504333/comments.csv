[S],velvet.,2011-06-29T18:42Z,"We do not have a black skull category for user accounts.
If you don't want your Trusted uploader status (pink skull), just say so, and we'll remove it."
[T],murdoc47,2011-06-29T19:13Z,"green works fine as well. but i already thanked you for the skull, so don't remove it (unless you want to change it)."
