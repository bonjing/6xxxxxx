I assume that if you are Tweeting updates about the seed/leech numbers you might be reading the comments on here.

I'm just a bit curious to know why you are publishing lists of ordinary people's usernames and passwords. I can't see how that tallies with the mission objective. You might argue that it isn't your intention to be popular but why piss individuals off needlessly. I thought the targets were supposed to be korporate kriminals. If you just want to flex your pecs with your hacking skills, why not redact the passwords, at least, thus demonstrating your power and humility in a oner.

And if you would like to pull a real crowd pleaser, why not do something which no government seems capable of doing and turn over the cunts who fill our mailboxes with shit every day? Or are the media rumours that some of you operate spam botnets are true?

I'm sure you don't do requests but there are plenty of targets which would delight the downtrodden masses."
