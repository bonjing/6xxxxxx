,Darkdragontc,2011-07-02T22:47Z,"It works, thank you!"
,hershe,2011-07-03T01:28Z,You're welcome. I got it from a nice Lad on What.cd. I requested it with a 10gb upload bounty. Totally worth it.

,Tenao,2011-07-14T21:42Z,"The damn Key number is invaild

,Ex0duS_5150,2011-08-04T21:29Z,"you guys that say it works, please come back in a month or 2 and let us know if its still working... the reset execute is very interesting though. lol "
,EviLH4cKz,2011-08-30T19:49Z,Thanks it works!
,stevenozzy,2011-09-02T00:50Z,"Instructions:
1: Download
2: Run ""sambc-fb.exe""
(Note: If you don't know what ""x64"" means in the name of ""sambc-fb-x64.exe"", you can completely ignore that file, because it doesn't pertain to you (most likely))
3: Click ""Next"", then ""I Agree"".
4: On the current page, there should be three check boxes. Just make sure that the first and the third check boxes are checked, the second one is up to you, since it just adds a shortcut on the desktop.
5: Continue on with installation process as required by installer (Just keep clicking next, etc.)
6: Run SAM Broadcaster for the first time.
7: Navigate to the top of SAM, then click on File -> Config
8: Locate ""Registration Key"" on the left side of the Configuration window that you should now have open, then click it.
9: Open the ""Serial.txt"" which came with this download, and copy the given serial into the field on the ""Registration Key"" menu.
(Note: the serial key looks similar to this:
VVVVV-WWWWW-XXXXX-YYYYY-ZZZZZ)
10: Click ""OK"" near the bottom of the Configuration window, then exit SAM Broadcaster.
11: Assuming SAM is now entirely closed out of, run the ""samreset.exe"" included in this download. It should finish just as soon as it opens. Click ""OK"" on that, and you're all set.

Hope this helps, I'm sure any questions you may have can be answered by posting a comment here and awaiting a fellow pirate.

And to the submitter, it may be a good idea to resubmit this torrent using the .torrent file generated by TPB, in order to include information about the download (and possible the above instructions, if you'd like)."
,hershe,2011-09-09T01:09Z,I'm glad y'all like this- my stream is available at: https://sites.google.com/site/sternerville/
,Ex0duS_5150,2011-09-09T05:09Z,so this is still working for you guys? it doesn't deactivate? im scared to use this because the last updated sam from 4.2.2 I tried deactivated it self and it takes me like almost 2 hours to load my music..
,meatieSwe,2011-09-10T04:44Z,"Dude. Awesomeness. I set the system clock forward 2 months, and of course activation expired. I ran samreset.exe and it WORKS AGAIN!
Thank you, I have been waiting YEARS for this.
Samreset also works for v4.9.1. Get the trial downloads directly from spacial.com"
,meatieSwe,2011-09-10T04:45Z,Let me add that it's highly likely samreset also works for v4.3.x to v4.8.x. It resets the activation timer.
,zanrac,2011-09-20T11:04Z,"Work perfectly with 4.9.1 (except for activation - but i guess that's not really necessary...)

Anyway, thanks x1000 !"
,bhama,2011-09-24T09:30Z,"Try as I might, following stevenozzy's instructio0ns I can't get it to make a peep. will NOT work - keeps saying I have to register my station. I used an older version with no problems. Guess I have to go back to it."
,bhama,2011-09-26T06:17Z,"AH, My Stupid.. must remember to config output. Great program. many Thanks"
,pratisme,2011-09-26T21:22Z,"Guys need help please. I can't connect to shoutcast server. Encoder settings are o.k. but when I start them they just trying to connect and sometimes I get error ""connection closed gracefully"" . I reinstalled 4.2 version and everything works fine.
Really confused.
I run Win7 x64"
,pratisme,2011-09-26T22:05Z,EDIT: My mistake. I checked shoutcast v2 instead shoutcast v1. Now works fine ;)
,wakokonuts,2011-10-02T18:59Z,"You're awesome! By the way, you can update this and the reset works. XD"
,TheRadioDoctor,2011-10-22T12:35Z,"I installed 4.9 over my existing 4.2 and it works.
After the installation had finished, upon running sam I got the expired-error. I closed all that and used samreset, after which sam started in trial mode. Then I opened Config, entered the serial and now it is unlimited :)"
,daNZXT,2011-11-24T00:22Z,Fantastic Thank you :)
