,stthedevil007,2011-07-04T17:19Z,Can you upload prince of persia and devil may cry 3dude?if they wont come in a dvd could u upload POPTT separately?thanks man
,shikibane,2011-07-04T19:08Z,@stthedevil007 yeah no problem i'll do my best to get it to work hopefully these 2 games work together on 1 dvd. I'll have it uploaded by tomorrow at the latest after i get down testing it. You said you wanted prince of persia the first 1 right and devil may cry 3?
,shikibane,2011-07-04T19:36Z,@stthedevil007 Or did you want prince of persia 3 the two thrones and devil may cry 3 i think that's what you meant.
,stthedevil007,2011-07-05T12:31Z,yeah i meant two thrones.....an ure torrents are great man..thanks
,shikibane,2011-07-05T22:12Z,@stthedevil007 hey man i tried to put dmc3 &poptt together but the iso came out too big like 5.24 gb it'll work if you have a dual layer dvd i was able to shrink poptt but dmc3 doesn't wanna shrink can you think of any other game you might want with poptt instead of dmc3. im going to keep trying but so far it doesn't look good.
,stthedevil007,2011-07-06T12:58Z,no problem.....cud u try castlevania curse of darkness and POPTT?

There you go oh one more thing you might want to test this using usbadvance or ps2loader etc.. i have already and the theres only one thing wrong part of the beginning cutscene on prince of persia is cut out like about 35 seconds or so but besides that both games play fine. I uploaded prince of persia separately here

if you just want that instead."

,robert22221,2011-08-30T12:34Z,I burn this on dvd and is something wrong. When I click x on game shows only black screen.  I use ESR. Can you help me?
,peodfil,2012-06-03T19:16Z,Hi. So...do I need a dual layer DVD or a simple one does it? I want this game pack so freaking hard. Thx 4 the answer
,shikibane,2012-06-16T21:17Z,@peodfil sorry for the late response i haven't been on lately you just burn it to a regular dvd you dont need a dual layer oh and dont forget to esr patch it if thats what you use.
