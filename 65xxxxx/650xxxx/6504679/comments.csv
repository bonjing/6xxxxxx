,muppetpoo,2012-04-30T19:16Z,"The chapters are a jumbled mess compared to the last two books you put up.  It literally took me an hour to put them in the correct order and I am still not completely sure they are in correct order.  There are three with the same file number and ts impossible to really tell which actually comes first.  I was very disappointed seeing how well the first two books were added.  I do, however, want to add that despite my complaints, I know that it is still free so these complaints are more to draw attention to them and not to necessarily bit**.  Thanks for the upload and I hope the next one is a little easier to apply to my device."
,Akercoke,2012-05-19T21:17Z,"I haven't downloaded so I can't comment on the quality but I do have a couple of things to say about the uploader's description...

""...As Martin's richly imagined world slides closer to its 10-year winter..."" Winter was declared in the previous book; the world isn't sliding closer to it but sliding further into it.

""In the north, King Joffrey of House Lannister sits uneasily on the Iron Throne."" No, he doesn't.  Well, everybody sit's uneasily in the iron throne; it was designed so whoever sat upon it could never sit at ease, but it's on the southern end of the continent.

""With the aid of a peasant wench, Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer, escapes from jail in Riverrun."" I have no problems calling the castle dungeon's a jail, but Brienne was a high born lady whom Jaime called ""wench"" in an effort to goad her and perhaps even provoke her into a fight.  She didn't so much help him but was sent to guard him so that he might be given back to his family in an exchange of hostages; him for the daughters of Brienne's liege lady.

""...Jaime goes to the other youthful ruler, Robb Stark, to secure the release of Joffrey's prisoners...""  No, Robb was mainly based in Riverrun.  He left Rob and was heading south to his nephew; Kind Joffrey.

""Meanwhile, in the south, Queen Daenarys tries to assert her claim to the various thrones with an army of eunuchs..."" I haven't finished reading it but Dany hadn't landed in Westeros at all, yet, though she was in the process of trying to secure an army of eunuchs... IN THE EAST.  I suppose it could be that does get to Westeros and, when she does, she arrives much further south than King's Landing."
,Arriay,2012-06-06T07:08Z,"The chapters are a bit confusing at first, since there's a couple with two files for one chapter (like Chapter 14). On these, it looks like they were split up because the chapters are long, but they're marked 1st and 2nd half, so listen to them in that order.

@Akercoke: Not to nitpick, but winter has not been declared, autumn has. They specifically discuss praying for a long autumn so they can get a few more harvests in to have enough food for winter. Also, I think that description was copied and pasted from the official one printed on the book/audiobook box, so don't be too harsh on the UL.

Though, he could have changed ""The complexity of characters such as Daenarys, Arya and the Kingslayer will keep READERS TURNING EVEN THE VAST NUMBER OF PAGES contained in this volume"" to ""listeners listening to the close to 40 hours*"". ;P

*I've not downloaded the entire thing, but based on the length of the book and comparing it to the last two, that's probably close."
