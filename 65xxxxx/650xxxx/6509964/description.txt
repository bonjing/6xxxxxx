[Uploader comment: For those in the USA, enjoy your 4th-of-July weekend.

The news is showing me that Minnesota's budget deals all fell through and the state government is officially shut down this weekend. If you're traveling through that state this weekend, take time to plan ahead (or be sure to bring along something in which you can pee!)...all the public highway rest areas are shut down. Also, my hat's off to the very many vacationers and weekenders whose plans are now set askew with all the Minnesota state parks and campgrounds also being closed. See revealed the subtle yet crucial nature of the term "public." Anyone misled into thinking that the term meant "owned by the public", "for the use of the public", now sees that it really means, "owned by the government, in spite of the public, for use by the public, as it suits that government, incidentally." Well fortunately for some this weekend on Minnesota's 10,000 amazing lakes, there are still private resort destinations OPEN and READY to serve your desire for fun, at a fair price.]
