Plant the seed in our homeland, boys. Let it grow where all can see.
Feed it with our devotion, boys. Call it the Liberty Tree.
Save it from the storm, boys. Water down its roots with tea!
And the sun will always shine on the oleâ€™ Liberty Tree.
March along with the piper, boys. We were born forever free!
Letâ€™s go pay the piper, boys, beneath the Liberty Tree.
Pay the price theyâ€™re asking, boys. Always pay the tyrantâ€™s fee!
Never give up the struggle, boys. Fight for the Liberty Tree.
Stand for the rights of man, boys. Stand against all tyranny!
Hang the lamps of freedom, boys, high on the Liberty Tree.
Nâ€™ it will grow as we grow, boys. It will be as strong as we!
We must cling to our faith, boys- faith in the Liberty Tree.
Itâ€™s a tall old Tree, And a strong old Tree,
And we are the Sons, Yes, we are the Sons
The Sons of Liberty!

Remember, on Independence Day, read the Declaration of Independence out loud, see if there are some grievances listed that sound all too familiar these days!

Keep ripping and I'll keep seeding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
