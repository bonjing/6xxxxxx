        Not every idea is a winner!

        In an attempt to reinvent his career, actor Dax Shepard  makes
        a  rash decision  to abandon  comedy in  pursuit of  his true
        dream: to become an internationally-renown martial arts star.

        Without any formal martial arts training, nor adequate funding
        for his "blockbuster" action movie, Dax (from 'When in  Rome')
        enlists the help of his buddies, including producer Nate Tuck,
        Tom  Arnold  (from  True  Lies'),  Bradley  Cooper  (from 'The
        Hangover'),   David  Koechner   (from  'Anchorman'),   Michael
        Rosenbaun  (from  TV's 'Smallville'),  and  Jon Favreau  (from
        'Iron Man' I and II).

        Together,  they  fight  to realise  Dax's  true  passion while
        facing rejection  at every  turn. Their  bizarre path  becomes
        increasingly nonsensical and  destructive, all at  the expense
        and exploitation of Dax's relationships.
