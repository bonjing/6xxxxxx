,poolpee,2011-06-28T08:53Z,What's with the cannabis and crossbones NFO nonsense? Are you like 12 years old? It was cool in 1986. 
,kt1307,2011-07-09T06:11Z,@poolpee: really! haven't you seen Pirates of the Carribean? Don't you watch the news? How about poolpee: is that a cool name or just your real one coz if so your comment would make sense...

,XPirata,2011-08-11T09:22Z,"Great crack!
Thanks!"
,vimes1981,2011-08-29T22:59Z,"The crack works
Each time it asks you to search for a file there is a name for which module it is looking for (illustrator, soundbooth or whatever) you can just skip to the one you need
Just select the file crack is looking for
For me it worked fine with photoshop that just expired so thanks to the uploader"
