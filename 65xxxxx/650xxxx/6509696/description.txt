We bring you once more the best of movies from Sweden - Oxen (1991) 
The Ox from writer/Director Sven Nykvist. We have an xvid version also
posted with lovely century gothic Irish green hard coded English subtitles 

Oxen was the deserving winner of The Academy Award in 1991 for best picture 
(non USA, Foreign movie classification)

This is a movie about Greatness of the Irish spirit and its capacity to 
endure stupid cruelty as is sometimes the state of affairs in the world.
Remember the potato famine in Ireland too?

Latin: Nescit plebs jejuna timere 
"a starving populace knows nothing of fear"

BTW We bought the DVD from ebay recently for this torrent posting
and it came in a lovely DVD jacket and slip-case decorative box
in presentation style. It was also quite reasonably priced 
and quickly shipped - please purchase a copy if you can afford to - 
its mainly Hollywood that has all the money they need, have been an abusive
monopoly in respect of pricing and availability of formats, language and
subtitles options and even in respect of their agenda to destroy the 
Irish spirit with third world multicultural nonsense being mainly what
they now spew out - expecting us to pay with overpriced older DVDs such as
the Sound of Music - even after they've raked in a billion with no concern
for our kids that are without the means to afford it in all too many cases in truth!

By the way, an important torrent to the community such as this, should be 
retainable at the option of thepiratebay in an anonymous account or abandoned
postings account should it ever be deleted by the uploader - if it is deemed
to be the right thing to do in a particular case of a torrent or batch
of torrents even  - that way, a torrent with a seeds doesnt 
just diappear overnight as all have invested in making it happen here.
Some have reasons for deleting a torrent from their portfolio without
objecting to it being retained elsewhere in the system here.
