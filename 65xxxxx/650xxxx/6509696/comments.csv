thanks for mentioning it. I missed it when you posted it.

do u have any other hard subbed movies? "
[T],moviesbyrizzo,2011-07-02T15:30Z,"We do have Victor Victoria versions posted with the same style of subs - however they are
to be improved upon soon based on our most recent posting of the 2GB version (similar quality).
Thank you for your comment - we also plan to bring you Et Dukkenjem this way as it remains the most favorite of my movies of Europe - where the best of movie ideas originate universally. (Beau Pere will soon come in better bitrates too this way)"
[T],moviesbyrizzo,2011-08-19T16:15Z,use magnet link above to download this torrent - due to a techie glutch - merci
[T],moviesbyrizzo,2011-11-29T00:19Z,Kindly note that the english srt was saved as unicode srt format by the subrip program - instantly convert to utf-8 using the free subtitles editor program if need be. (or ansi format if you prefer) - sorry about that - we also have the english srt available separately if you wish
