This movie was hard to locate as it is named "Nora" rather than 
"A Dolls House" in the ebay listings and on the DVD

Great performance by Edward Fox

A Doll's House is the brilliant work of Henrik Ibsen of Norway
It is about the fundamantal differences in people in respect of how
we are made to differently see all matters across the board and most 
certainly on such issues as morality and genuine human ideas of true
love and care rather than legalistic semantic notions of perfunctory
adequacy instead.

The very best rendition of this great work is the Norwegian production
Et Dukkehjem - currently only available in the boxed set Ibsen pÃ¥ TV
from Norway http://nrkbutikken.no/produktsok/results/et%20dukkehjem
(We've spend years looking for it and are purchasing this set to bring
you a better version of this movie in respect of video res and audio
bitrate too from what we have offered before.

The fact is that it is the very poorest tactical procedure you could
employ, to instead make use of the likes of Claire Bloom (in the Anthony
Hopkins version of A Dolls House production for instance)and even Jane
Fonda's to some extent although not nearly as close in the imagination
a degree of error as it were.

The actual tale is told best in the production of A Dolls House
(Et Dukkehjem) The truly beautiful Ms. Lise Fjeldstad shows us
just what a shock it is for the real Irish spirit to be treated to such
alien notions of better ideas of so-called moral goodness in contrast
to her own instincts as a competent human being.


All other renditions that have since been produced seek to obfuscate
this fact by using actors that bring the character of Torvals and Nora
much too closer together for there to remain an adequate understanding
of the contrast needed instead to adequately tell what the message of 
this Play is truly all about meant to be at the core.
