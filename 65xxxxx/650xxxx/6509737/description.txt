Another really fucking gangster mix set by DJ Shox!!

For the love of me I cannot find distrobution other than torrents. I upload my shit to places like soundcloud but TORRENTING GIVES ME THE BEST DISTRIBUTION BY FAR!!!






FUCK THE RECORDING INDUSTRY

As an artist I dont give a fuck if I don't make a dime off of my hard work. What really matters to me is that people enjoy what I make and that they get to listen to it DRM free. 100% free infact! 

What is even more important to me is that no faggot recording industry lawyers make any money off of me either.
