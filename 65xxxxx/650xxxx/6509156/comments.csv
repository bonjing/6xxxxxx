,brianxxx,2011-07-02T17:03Z,"Thanks!

What is really fucked up about this update is that it is all the same kinds of updates they did for the last one - FEAR 2. They make the game, sell it then create a patch for shit they already knew was going to be an issue. 
I mean what fucking developer these days does not know about
""- Support for wider than 16x9 aspect ratio displays has been added to 
  support users with non-standard display devices and spanned 
  multi-monitor displays like AMD Eyefinity and NVIDIA Surround.""

I mean really? This is why this franchise has been dying a slow death...all the original people behind it (MONOLITH) are gone and the typical cookie cutter methods are being used now.

Pisses me off."
,kimoalexandru,2011-07-03T10:44Z,this game is very hard !!!!!!!!! i m talking serious.

Works with this update
Tested =)"
,Towel3,2011-07-05T15:19Z,"Patch installed fine, but on my system it made everything extremely blurry. Nothing in the new config file seemed to fix this. 

Most likely its my system and not skidrow or the devs fault since I'm running this on a 9300m gs. 

So I reinstalled with out the patch, and just used the no motion blur or dof patch easily found here on pb, and everything is very clear and sharp again, even at my low res of 1056x660. 

So if your suffering from excessive blur after the patch, you may want to try the other homebrew one instead. "
