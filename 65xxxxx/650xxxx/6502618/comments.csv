,pteacup,2011-08-28T06:12Z,Thanks for this. It's a bit annoying that nothing is numbered when dropped into a music player (meaning I have to do it manually because I'm a bit ocd about my music collection) but it's a minor inconvenience. 
,macman700,2011-09-16T01:46Z,"omg, thank you so much, seeding all the way.  hey, do you think you could upload Highway 61 revisited by bob dylan? many thx, cheers."
,megahurts_gr,2012-03-21T11:06Z,"Strangely enough, there is an ""Ultimate Collection"" of Bob Dylan that you can buy at the stores, but there appears to be no such record as ""The Ultimate Best Of"" Bob Dylan. The ""folder.jpg"" included within the torrent is *not* the cover of any CD. The torrent contains some duplicate songs. In a few words, this is a composition by a fan, disguised (by the title) as a product. I'd be willing to bet that it is as remastered as I am albino."
