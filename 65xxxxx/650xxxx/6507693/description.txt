Quote:
In 1981, a young Frank Miller took the reins of a second-class superhero, Daredevil, and turned the comics world on its ear with a dynamic, cinematic storytelling style, complicated characters, and unusual (for the time) devices such as first-person narrative. Daredevil Visionaries: Frank Miller, Vol. 2 covers issues 168-182, when Miller took over the writing (he had already been doing the pencils; Klaus Janson did the inks) and pitted DD against Spider-Man's archrival the Kingpin, super assassin Bullseye, the ninja group the Hand, and a brand-new character, Elektra, a bounty hunter/assassin who also happened to be Matt Murdock's former lover. Issue 181, the showdown between Bullseye and Elektra, is still one of the most memorable single issues in comics.


Quote:
Daredevil found new life under the pen and pencil of Frank Miller, and his vision of the Man Without Fear is highlighted in this third volume, collecting the complete run. In this collection, Daredevil once more takes on New York City's criminal underworld, angered over the prevalence of drugs in the schools. Along the way, he has to first compete against and then fight the Punisher, who has a deadlier method for dealing with pushers.

Daredevil also finds himself foiling the Kingpin of crime's latest machinations while precariously handling a crumbling relationship with Heather Glenn.

When the dangerous Hand return from Japan, Daredevil needs help but his last ally against them, Elektra, is dead. Coming to his aid is the Black Widow, an old lover, who only further complicates Daredevil's emotions.
