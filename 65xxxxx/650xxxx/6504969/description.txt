 Oh noes! We pred a BDRip 45 mins after some random group did the 720p! We must
have stolen theirs and encoded to xvid during that time! You know, because as a
9 year old release group we are prone to doing that sort of thing... but hey if
you can't win a race legitimately there's probably some lame reason that it is
properable right? Why don't you go back to doing lame wmv rips, who downloads that
shit anyways?... =x

What a colossal fucking waste of my time, oh how the scene has gone downhill these
days...
