Every version of this movie we have offered up on a torrent these past years
has come from a PAL DVD folder we initially downloaded that was multi-sub and multi-Euro language. Alas - it was never widescreen as we couldnt find a PAL offering of a DVD to purchase in this better format of the movie.

We just today received in the mail a Region 4 Version sent from Australia
brand new and sealed. It contains not only the widescreen version of the PAL 
movie offering, it also has all the subtitles we hoped for in the main
in addition to what we already have for you to fit the PAL version.

The moral of this great movie is that Ms. Julie Andrews or whatever her
names may be - I refer to gals of the truest Irish spirit - are always to
be afforded the best meal in the house - on the house - or
on a tab - whatever- as long as we dont ask them to do anything a nice gal
shouldnt be asked to do eh!
