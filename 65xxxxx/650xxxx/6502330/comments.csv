[T],moviesbyrizzo,2011-06-28T22:07Z,"Note: the DVD jacket specifically states 16:9 widescreen on this disc we made this DivX from using DivX author. That said, it appears similar in widescreen orientation just as our previous 1GB DivX from PAL folder convert - sorry for any confusion at this point - with thanks! This should tide you over till we have a 4GB 720p perhaps through HDTV or whatever! (and beyond) Thanks again!"
