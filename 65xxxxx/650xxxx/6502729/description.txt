                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Hayley Taylor's campaign to get the unemployed back to work comes to an end in
 Southend-on-Sea. There, she lends a hand to a group of unemployed women who have
 been hit by the recession, in an area that has seen the number of people claiming
 out-of-work benefit almost double in five years. Last in the series.
                         
                                 Enjoy!
