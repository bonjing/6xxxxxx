Many Thanx to the .BONE. for a decent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:)"
,ff5llc,2011-07-02T06:19Z,This is an indie funded film. Please speak kindly on it. Made with blood sweat and tears. No studio money here. Thanks for your thoughts. 
,Just_Another_Peer,2011-09-02T08:28Z,"Well, I guess I'll try it but it isn't looking good for this copy either seeing it is the exact same size as one of the other 4 copies I have downloaded. They have all had LOUD AUDIO, like it was ran through a guitar amp before the encoding process."
,Just_Another_Peer,2011-09-02T19:02Z,Yep. Same as the others. NUKED
,cat_jimbo,2011-09-06T12:50Z,"Awful film, but thanks for the upload.

Audio wasn't too great on this. "
