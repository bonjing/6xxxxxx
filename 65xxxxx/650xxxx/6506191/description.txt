Shakespeare's plays are thought-provoking and complex texts that explore the human themes of romance, deceit, tragedy, comedy and revenge. The activity guides are designed by teachers for teachers to help students navigate the complexity. Each guide contains a total of 30 activities divided into six sections of four activities and one review. At the end of each guide is a final test, a variety of culminating activities, and an answer key.
