plot

 In October 1988, teenager Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) has been seeing a psychiatrist because of his troubled history. Donnie sleepwalks, and he has visions of Frank (James Duval), a menacing, demonic-looking rabbit.
On October 2, Frank draws Donnie out of his room to tell him, in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds, the world will end. While Donnie is outside, a jet engine crashes through his bedroom. The next morning, Dr. Fisher (Arthur Taxier) and Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze), a motivational speaker, find Donnie sleeping on a golf course. Donnie returns home to find police and firemen. No one knows where the jet engine has come from, since there were no planes flying in the vicinity, and no airline reported losing an engine.
