,molly_dog,2012-03-14T01:40Z,"So far, I have tried every possible way I know about using a crack to activate software and none have worked.

Maybe I'm missing something? Could you please be a little more specific about at what point I should run your crack? 

I've so far tried before I run the software, at the Product Key/Purchase/Trial window, when the app is running. I've run your crack both in and out of the install directory. Nothing works.

A little help would really be appreciated! I lost all my web site files in a hard drive crash and the online backup I used is, in theory, trying to recover my backup that would not restore. 

I'm going to have to manually re-create over 50 web pages. If I have to do that, I'd rather create them with a newer copy of Magix/Xara software since less than a week after I bought Xara Xtreme Pro, they released Web Designer. Call me greedy but I feel they owe me!
