Stored deep within the bowels of a South Dakota warehouse is a treasure trove of supernatural objects collected 
by the U.S. government. It's the job of Secret Service agents Myka Bering (Joanne Kelly) and Peter Lattimer 
(Eddie McClintock) to find those that have gone missing. Sharing a common goal but wildly varying work styles, 
the agents must find a way to work together to diffuse the power of these objects and bring them back to safety.
