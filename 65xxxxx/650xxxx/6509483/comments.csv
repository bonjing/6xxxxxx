no seeds?  PREVENT this problem for YEARS with USENET

...............




posting to usenet would be VERY AWESOME

Posting to usenet is as easy as posting a torrent, but original seeder ONLY needs to expend upload bandwidth ONCE

This would make debates ddos-free and available for at least 1000 days!


astraweb $96/yr for actual-unlimited includes SSL

no link: DEATH to affiliate url spammers

Alternatively buy usenet in blocks (not unlimited), where blocks of data never expire and for some are more affordable.


CAPpers or anyone who has downloaded:

media consumers who HATE paying to watch commercials:

pay for the content with your tv subscription, but ditch the commercials via usenet!
