 Set in the underbelly of Mumbai; in the     
 notorious by-lanes where 'Greed is a        
 Culture' and 'Deceit becomes a Compulsion'  
 'Bhindi Baazaar Incorporation' revolves     
 around gangs of pickpockets who consider    
 pick pocketing as an art. They use their    
 intelligence as a canvas and their          
 spontaneity as a brush to survive in this   
 dangerous lively hood. 'Bhindi Baazaar Inc.'
 is the story of a pawn and his calculated   
 moves to reach the end of the chessboard.   
 Revolving around a crime syndicate who are  
 in the business of pickpocket, the film     
 starts with a game of chess between two     
 characters 'Shroff' and 'Darzi'. Each move  
 unfolds their story and eventually the      
 motive of their meeting. The story unravels 
 the quest of a small time pickpocket 'Fateh'
 next in line to be a MAMU (local area-head).
