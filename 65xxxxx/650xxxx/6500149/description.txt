570 Star Trek eBooks complete with covers and metadata and sorted loosely into publishing order within their series. Most were converted from lit files with some pdf and txt conversions as well so the quality isn't always very high.

I did NOT include the books written by Shatner as he always seems to be in his own little world of Trek.

Keep in mind many of these have NEVER been released as ebooks so it's not likely you'll find them in beautiful condition. However, if you do and you send me a link I will happily rerelease the torrent in the future with the latest books and the higher quality versions supplied.

Thanks to all the people who took the time typing and scanning the older books in so the rest of us could enjoy them electronically!

Don't forget to seed!
