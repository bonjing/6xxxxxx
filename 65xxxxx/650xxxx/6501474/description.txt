***My first ever torrent upload here at ThePirateBay***

Searching for a high-quality rip of the soundtrack to the underrated videogame of 2003, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Amplitude\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", on PlayStation 2, was impossible until I came across a site where anyone who has the game can rip the songs from the game themselves with ease.

Luckily I still have the game and managed to rip copies of the songs from the files in the game and convert them.

These tracks are encoded from WAV into iTunes Plus format (m4a 256kbps VBR) with proper tags taken from the game manual itself (title, artist, year, copyright, etc).

Hopefully this gets spread around enough where there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s more than just the 128 - 256kpbs MP3 rip floating around.

Enjoy!
