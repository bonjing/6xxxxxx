This unique book provides concepts and background necessary to understand and build algorithms for computing the elementary functionsâ€”sine, cosine, tangent, exponentials, and logarithms. The author presents and structures the algorithms, hardware-oriented as well as software-oriented, and also discusses issues related to accurate floating-point implementation.
