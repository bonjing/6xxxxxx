Most topics dealt with here deal with complex analysis of both one and several complex variables. Several contributions come from elasticity theory. Areas covered include the theory of p-adic analysis, mappings of bounded mean oscillations, quasiconformal mappings of Klein surfaces, complex dynamics of inverse functions of rational or transcendental entire functions, the nonlinear Riemann-Hilbert problem for analytic functions with nonsmooth target manifolds, the Carleman-Bers-Vekua system, the logarithmic derivative of meromorphic functions, G-lines, computing the number of points in an arbitrary finite semi-algebraic subset, linear differential operators, explicit solution of first and second order systems in bounded domains degenerating at the boundary, the Cauchy-Pompeiu representation in L2 space, strongly singular operators of Calderon-Zygmund type, quadrature solutions to initial and boundary-value problems, the Dirichlet problem, operator theory, tomography, elastic displacements and stresses, quantum chaos, and periodic wavelets.
