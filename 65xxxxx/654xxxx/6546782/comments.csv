Anyways, has anyone found an English dubbed version for ""Trigun - Badlands Rumble""?"
,TheMadHat,2011-08-21T04:43Z,@jacksonds sorry bro they havent finished doing the english voice over yet wait awhile longer. I mean trigun the series came out around 2000 in japan but didnt come out in english until 2003
,tiltswitch,2011-09-18T19:01Z,yeh thats the imdb bullshit....read the nfo at the top it says spoken lang ...japanese...text lang...english
,OMGnix,2011-09-30T01:31Z,..seriously?english dubs are horrible >.>
,lorileisiren,2011-10-09T05:45Z,"theres dubbed out now, but nobody uploaded yet.... stinks cuz i prefer subbtitles but need dubbed when i am at work, bcause i cant look at screen the whole time :("
,Tarson,2011-10-09T17:08Z,"The english dubbed has not been released yet...  nor is there any information as to when it will.

All versions for sale at the moment are English Subs only."
,tiltswitch,2011-10-11T17:59Z,there is no dub of this yet and no doubt wont b for some time....anime should really be watched with original audio and subtitles...i too was just a dub follower but slowly converted to subs...once u get used to it u wont be botherd one way or the other
,Demon_Gate,2011-10-21T17:02Z,"to all the people who are saying english dubbs sucks are haters. I love both japanese and English dubs. NOTHING IS WRONG and my 4 year old friends daughter and my 6 year old brother can't read that fast yet so how the fuck you think they feel if im watching something that they love but not understand? it's not just for you, dumbasses. It's for everyone. >_> Hmph"

It was good to see some new Trigun after so many years. Animation is done by the studio that did the original so looks just how I remember. The animation quality is top-notch. Not the greatest story but still funny with some decent Vash action and even Wolfwood. "
