,Cheks1,2011-07-18T01:56Z,quick question...why does this start at day 3??? Where's the first 2 days? Cheers! 
,RedRaw1,2011-07-18T13:18Z,@cheks1 ... Because there are 4 x day 1's and 2 x day 2's. The poker only get interesting on day 3.
,Cheks1,2011-07-19T02:13Z,"@RedRaw1 - yer but a lot of big names were eliminated on those 1st couple days, and was just wondering if they'll eventually release the videos 4 it like they have the past 30 years lol!"
,DiemerR1,2011-07-20T12:43Z,I agree with Checks1...Anyone who has an answer on his question? Grtz

,DiemerR1,2011-07-21T19:18Z,So day one should be online on july 27 i guess...Thanks
,Cheks1,2011-07-22T03:58Z,"cheers @samtheman66 - the site says: ""The 2011 World Series of Poker presented by Jack Linkâs Beef Jerky Tuesday night telecasts with McEachern and Norman Chad will begin July 26 on ESPN for 16 consecutive weeks leading up to the November Nine final table on Nov. 8."" - so have to wait a few more days i guess...at least they're still gonna show it :)"
,stephen6789,2011-07-23T13:45Z,NO CAMS!  Not showing the hole cards makes for a pretty boring tournament.  Isn't that what makes TV poker a spectator sport?
,FlashGorgon,2011-07-27T06:53Z,No hole cards makes it feel like being at the table for us real poker players...it's kinda like a free WSOP boot camp.
,Cheks1,2011-08-01T02:12Z,"there's still no torrent anywhere for the standard footage we used to get, or the 1's with norman chad as commentator or the 1st 2 days? Anyone know why? The site listed above said it should've started 26/07/2011!"
