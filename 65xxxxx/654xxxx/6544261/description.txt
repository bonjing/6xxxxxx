PapugLinux-11.1 is available for download, this is a major release in term of package update.
We choose to focus our additions on development tools for this version. The great Python language comes in 2 versions (2.7 and 3.1) and we also include Subversion and the very popular Git as version control systems. This could make PapugLinux a great bundle to start to learn Python or symply browse the open-source projects all over the world.
The live running-mode uses new tools and another compression format, this results in more content in a smaller size.
The desktop image credit goes to Flavio Takemoto from Brasil, this artist has a great portfolio of artwork.
Kindest regards,
