Oh and I Googled .dmg and now understand that it's basically an ISO image but why in 4 years have I never heard of it? Is it taken from a mac?"
,TaiTheGuy,2011-09-09T05:51Z,"Sweet, didn't take too long, all things considered.
.avi's Opened fine with PowerISO on my PC.
Thanks a bunch, my Son's enjoying the 1st few episodes now. Plus I still like this show. & his Mom's watchin' it right now with him (which she NEVER does)!"

Most importantly, why drop it all into a DMG file? Why not just torrent the AVIs so I could have previewed one or pick and choose the episodes I want?"
,Lucky13s,2012-04-01T19:52Z,"Good stuff. My son will love this, because I loved it as a kid.

Were only 22/21 so were young parents, so its hard finding something to plop our child infront of, I'm sure magic school bus will glue him to the TV for a couple hours every day which gives us time to clean up the house without him undo-ing everything."
