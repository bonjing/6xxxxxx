,swazibuddy,2011-07-18T11:03Z,"EZTV, you rock, great work!

THIS SHOW IS SHIT.... christian propaganda at it's worst.... "
,TuckerT,2011-07-18T12:54Z,"I disagree with swazibuddy on the first count of his statement about the show being shit. It is somewhat entertaining and has good special effects for a tv show if nothing else.
However i completely agree that it is christian propaganda of the highest order. In fact sickeningly so. I'd go screaming to the aliens for shelter from the cult like humans who believe like in the crusade days, every act they commit is in the name of god. More right wing evangelical bullshit."
,dfro,2011-07-18T16:26Z,just shut the fuck up and watch the show. thanks eztv
,thedeathlessprince,2011-07-18T18:05Z,"Although it does have some religious themes (the whole we've all lost our faith coss of the human genocide and the whole humanities being annihilated but I still kept my faith thing) I wouldn't say it's religious... and who cares?

Good show, enough action, plot without thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat many holes in it.
It's nice to see new sci-fi action... there's fuck all good action series anymore.

Also Thanks eztv, I get a lot of your stuff."
,juniorvelox,2011-07-18T18:39Z,vlw eztv vcs sì°½o the best.
,suesg1,2011-07-18T20:21Z,thank you ez : )
,Torolava,2011-07-19T00:49Z,"There's one very Christian character and a bit of prayer stuff but I'm not seeing the the Christian propaganda conspiracy. It's no Walking Dead as far as characters go, but it's reasonably fun and there is some good discovery."
,ElRuibioGuerito,2011-07-19T01:25Z,Thanks Mate!!
,mrorbear,2011-07-19T01:27Z,"Thank you as always!  One thing, it would be helpful to have the air date in the description so one doesn't end up downloading already seen episodes. Thanks again!"
,mrorbear,2011-07-19T01:29Z,"Um, ""Swazibuddy"" et al....this show is produced by Steven Spielberg, who is a JEW and is not about to put ""christian propaganda"" on the air."
,rasmusew,2011-07-19T02:17Z,Thank you very much ;)
,swazibuddy,2011-07-19T09:32Z,"I am aware who produced it, still doesn't change the fact that it is full of soppy christian sentiment... and if you know anything about anything, it is shitty propaganda.... I don't expect everyone to recognise this, after all, genius is only 2% of the population."
,hurka79,2011-07-19T09:34Z,Max. thanks from Hungary!
,illafame,2011-07-19T11:12Z,"how is this christian propaganda...   do u see these guys going to church..  or constantly praying for them to leave or help.. no        i hate how every1 leaves comments saying bullshit!   thanks for the up/l eztv, your a champ!   we only got the 3rd episode about to show here tomorrow and if it wasnt for u i wouldnt be on the 6th! hahaha    keep em cumin bud!"
,illafame,2011-07-19T11:18Z,"oh and swazibuddy, ur talking shit about how bad this show is..  yet i garuntee u downloaded it still, and ur making dumb coments..     u musnt fit in the 2% genius section lmao    .   mrorbear is spot on!        dude nearly every movie or series made out there has a msg in it, and so does this 1.   did ur genius brain figure that 1 out too...  maybe ur genius brain should fuck off and go do a math quiz or something!   u dont have to go round telling people what u think of it.."
,illafame,2011-07-19T11:26Z,"swazibuddy, if u think this show is so shit y are u on here downloading it and leaving comments saying thanks!   if ur such a genius go fuck off and make your own series and beat this 1... . u talk shit"
,richie231186,2011-07-19T12:06Z,EZTV rocks! thanks guys
,aname333,2011-07-19T16:11Z,"thanks.


not propaganda. gunporn"
,winzentween,2011-07-20T10:03Z,this show is weak at best and has a strong religious under current but overall its just stupid...so many holes
,Maddist,2011-07-20T22:49Z,"i think the show drags on abit n i dont care about the religous shit, i just wanna see more action not talking."
,pollenhead,2011-07-21T01:22Z,"look,for anyone that has problems with dl speed,try keeping your torrent program open,and then disconnect your sever as quick as possible,and then connect quickly,and the speed,should increase to full cap,try this several times if need be,it should increase after 5 min.i have mobile broadband,and they try to block torrent dl's but i manage to DL falling skies in 30-35 min's !!"
,xaocam,2011-07-21T10:34Z,"Being a sci fi nut I have to watch it but I agree, there seems to be a constant infiltration of christian propaganda coming out of North American tv shows, does drive me nutty but I've learnt to switch off and treat it as it is, just fantasy, lol, learn that and you get a giggle, all that christian propaganda deserves lol. Thanks EZTV"
,xaocam,2011-07-21T10:37Z,"p.s., why is it that the humans can have quite a large settlement within a stones throw of the aliens?"
,max_headroom2011,2011-07-22T00:22Z,"Thank  Q  to eztv.... King of TV Shows
excellent download :) "
,velcroman0001,2011-07-22T03:21Z,"Hey swazibuddy: What do you mean Christian properganda?  I thought the show had an underlying theme on how to cook rock lobsters!
Idiot! The site is for down loading files and commenting on the quality of the file, not for moronic invective about the movie/show within the file.  You should post your drivel on IMBD or Wiki"
,Calamakuya,2011-07-22T07:39Z,"Just an innocent question...  You think an alien race would travel 40 light years to enslave teens (Biological Labor) to pick up tiny pieces of scrap metal?

Ah..! and not to mention the abusively imposed christian propaganda."
,Calamakuya,2011-07-22T07:42Z,"Well, I guess the christian thingy also can pass as SciFi as well anyway."
,dekiai,2011-07-22T10:26Z,"One annoyance after another : --) 

Blablabla annoying bad guys take X as hostage and demand Y in exchange.. and waste a few episodes in the process.

Looks like this is the end of this series for me.

I AM DISAPPOINT."
,Chance1963,2011-07-23T08:07Z,"I rely on comments mostly for quality and speed. I don't read them to listen to some moron with an axe to grind over whether or not they like the show or whether or not they have some grudge against Christianity. As for ""propaganda"", I doubt if anyone would either be convinced or dissuaged over religious ideology based on escapist SciFi. Expression of faith is not a crime, and it seems to be in the show just to reflect that humans do in fact sometimes draw on their faith during times of destruction, disaster, loss, etc. If someone is that offended by the mere reference of Christianity, than I, even as a liberal would have to consider them a bigot with issues. If you don't like the show don't watch it. To most, it's just escapism. There's not a lot of Scifi on right now, and the episodes have some sort of appeal even if it's not Battlestar Galactica. Again, if you don't like it, just shut up and go away! How hard is that? "
,Chance1963,2011-07-23T08:24Z,Oh I forgot. I actually just registered to thank eztv for all of the excellent work. Sorry I hit a speedbump of some stupid people. THANKS EZTV!
,Psycho0124,2011-07-23T17:19Z,"Good quality, thanks for the up eztv!

I am getting a little peeved with all the christian undertones in the show. I don't mind christian folks, as long as they're behaving themselves but I do expect them to pray in private as their book instructs them. (Matthew 6:5 - 7, Matthew 26:36, Mark 1:35, Mark 6:46, Luke 5:16, Luke 9:18, and Luke 22:45). Seeing it on my tv screen, for my children to see, is offensive and inappropriate (despite what some self-professed liberal know-it-all may suggest I should find appropriate or not).

,3rdAdam,2011-07-25T11:25Z,"so many people who are against mans religion are so blinded by their Hate of it that just hearing the word ""god"" or ""faith"" is deemed religious.   


And no i am not in support of mans religion, no way at all."
,3rdAdam,2011-07-26T13:23Z,""" Seeing it on my tv screen, for my children to see, is offensive and inappropriate""

Watching a show about aliens kidnapping children, murder, stealing, swearing, kids using guns to kill is ok for your children to watch, but showing someone who has faith everything will be ok is to far?  your kids are going to be messed up with priorities like that. 

A movie, TV series which is made to try and  covertly put their religious message across (scientology, christianity, evolution... etc) is wrong."
,pourable,2011-07-30T10:34Z,If a show like this last longer than a season unlike Firefly I will puke once again
