His Near Death Experience makes him see white light in some people and to hear Electronic Voice Phenomena, i.e., manifestations of voices of ghosts or spirits through static on electronic devices. Sooner he discovers that the white light means that the person is going to die, and Abe saves three lives including his nurse Sherry Clarke.
