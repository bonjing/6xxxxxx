,Lyxnman,2011-07-16T20:16Z,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWW I want to give this to Linkara to be reviewed on Atop the 4th wall
,BatDinger,2011-07-16T23:04Z,"Mr DT with the great ups once again.

p.s. I got some new trades that i cannot find on TPB. before I scan and bend em all up, do you have the following in your digital collection?
JSA - Black Adam and Isis TPB
52: The Companion TPB"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-16T23:42Z,@BD - Surprisingly I was unable to find either online - So it would be a great service if you scanned and ULed them. Take care not to bend em too much :)
,BatDinger,2011-07-16T23:59Z,"Will start with 52 companion. further research shows that JSA adam & isis just collects JSA 23-28, which is already available"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-17T00:36Z,"Ha Ha - Thanks to all the people willing to seed something with Hitler in the title.

@BD - Thanks for being a scanner :D"
