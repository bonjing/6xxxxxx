,RobinHood79,2011-07-17T21:59Z,"Well, the format it was in was all jumbled. I put it in Excel so it would keep the information in columns. Plus, you can filter and search much more easily. As for viewing it, Excel format is easily read by Google Documents if you don't have Excel. Just go to the Google search page and click on the ""more"" tab or go to docs.google.com."
