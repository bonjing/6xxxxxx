This is a little different from the rest because it allows the saving of the image as png,jpeg and more, so that it can be edited more by other programmes.

The only problem with it is that it cannot do the curved text around the disc,
but overall it's not bad.

No serial is required even though one is supplied, just click on the icon.

If you know of a programme that can export as jpeg etc and do curved text, please post here for all to try.
