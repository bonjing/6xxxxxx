A little technical info (beside 1080p and x264) won't hurt..."

Pisses me off!"
,figglegiggle69,2011-07-16T17:18Z,@bluesniffer right click > open new tab. that works w/o copy and paste

,maaadal,2011-07-17T22:19Z,"This encode does not appear to be DXVA-compatible (hardware acceleration). I can't get my video-card to hardware-decode video stream, so my CPU is maxed-out at 100%. I don't have this problem with most H264/AVC1 videos.


Just a suggestion SAM:
 Select DXVA-compatible in your encoder settings"
