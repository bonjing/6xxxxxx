An Epic Battle Comes to Life!
Cosmic Conflict: Origin of Evil is a powerful, eye-opening documentary that focuses on the great controversy that began when Lucifer rebelled in heaven. It traces the transformation of a perfect angel into Satan, the creation of a beautiful new world, and the fall of man in Eden.
Most important, it clearly explains how evil invaded a world made by a loving God, who wanted nothing more than peace and happiness for all His creation. Do you want to understand where evil came from and why God let it happen â€” then this movie is for you!
