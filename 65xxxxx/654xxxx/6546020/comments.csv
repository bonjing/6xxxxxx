A/10
V/10
NO audio sync problems with this copy, the running time is 1:00:29 but there doesn't seem to be anything missing, unless there was extras on the original DVD release... Looks good to me, but I haven't seen the original, so I can't 100 percent say that it's perfect...
Many Thanx to .BONE. for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a super quick download...:)"
[V],.BONE.,2011-07-17T13:35Z,the NeDiVx has same runtime it just says 69mins in the notes
