"There is a prophecy that speaks of the Phoenix Rising. It's said that the Phoenix will rise from within Mother Earth and it will be a time of healing and unity for all of humanity.

FEENIX (a.k.a. Shawn Bernard) has risen from the ashes of a world that had nothing 

but darkness. Now his music speaks to all of humanity. FEENIX is about inspiration, motivation, believing in yourself and giving back to the community."
