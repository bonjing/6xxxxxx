A Garbage track called â€œWitness to Your Loveâ€ was released on a charity, â€œlimited 

availability,â€ compilation in the USA. The release was available from Urban 

Outfitters from Wednesday, October 15, 2008, to Thursday, January 31, 2009, and went 

on radio in the US on October 17.

Saw that this wasn't on TPB so I decided to upload it.This is Garbage's latest track.

Still waiting and hoping that they'll record new album...
