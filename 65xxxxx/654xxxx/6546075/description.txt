Richard Mathesons - I Am Legend [IDW]

A devastating epidemic breaks out all over the world. The infected transform 
into vampire like creatures that must sleep during the day and roam the earth 
at night. One lone human survivor, Robert Neville, must live a life of stark 
loneliness during the day, and absolute peril at night.

Adapted by Steve Niles and Elman Brown and originally published in 1991 by 
Eclipse Comics, it was later collected into a trade paperback by IDW Publishing.

*** This is NOT based on the Will Smith Movie. This is an adapatation of the 
original Book by Richard Matheson which is amazing and even though he called
his creatures 'vampires' and they had vampiric tendancies and weaknesses, Matheson
and his book I Am Legend are generally credited with being the first true Zombie
story. Note that besides the characters name, The Will Smith movie had almost
nothing to do with this book it was based on. This is one of my favorite books
and this comic adapation is excellent. ***
