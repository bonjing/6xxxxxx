Is It Real: Russian Bigfoot
Does a man from the Paleolithic still walk this planet? In Mongolia and Russia, rumors about hairy, ape-like creatures swirl the remote mountains. It's known as the "Almas" and many say it could be a relic Neanderthal. We join a cryptozoological creature seeker trying to find evidence of the creature's existence in Mongolia; a Russian hominologist who claims to have evidence - skulls and hair samples -- which may prove the wildman's existence -- and a team of scientists in New York with access to the ultimate key, Neanderthal. Could some Neanderthals still live and breathe today?
