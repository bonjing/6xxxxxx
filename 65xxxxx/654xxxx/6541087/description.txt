RASL (ongoing) #1 - 11


RASL is an independently published black and white comic book series, written 
and drawn by Bone creator Jeff Smith. The series showed Smith's "dark side", 
as it was much more mature than his previous works. The series originally ran 
with 3 issues a year with repeated delays, but has now been changed to a 
bimonthly schedule. The series follows the art thief RASL, who jumps to 
parallel universes in attempts to steal parallel paintings, but soon runs 
into dangerous scenarios as he is pursued by the government.

RASL is written and drawn as a sci-fi noir. It draws influences from real life 
events, people and places in addition to Southwestern Native American culture 
and hardboiled crime fiction. The art style is high contrast black and white 
and is notably more detailed and "human" than Smith's previous work, Bone. 
The story follows a central story, but is narrated extensively through RASL's 
thoughts. Smith also utilizes flashbacks to tell the story of RASL's past.
