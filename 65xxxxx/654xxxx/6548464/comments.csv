Not that I am not grateful for the downloads, I wish we could go back to the old mkv files.   That said, I convert them and stream them which works but takes more time."
,homericICON,2011-07-19T15:21Z,"Beautiful upload, but there is something ""hinky"" in the AC3 5.1 soundtrack. It won't play properly in Jet Audio w/AC3 Filtre & Jet Audio says I don't have the proper codec, which is false. It won't stream into my LG BD590C Network Blu-Ray Player. The file does play well though with Media Player Classic & the Divx Player. The Video though is just awesome."
,Rift-Nightblade,2011-07-19T15:29Z,"To anyone interested, you may need to remove the header compression from the .mkv file to stream the file across your network via Allshare.  
A simple Google search will point you in the right direction. Thanks to suprbay forums for helping me figure out how to do this. "
,Rift-Nightblade,2011-07-20T20:49Z,"Scratch header compression, it's the audio track sampling frequency.... it is set to 0 on this and all recent downloads from Immerse....  It needs to be set to 48kHz....  follow this link for info: http://forum1.netgear.com/showpost.php?s=b743a30f20d9643b19f24323e58b8286&p=357731&postcount=28"
