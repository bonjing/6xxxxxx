,redback38,2011-07-21T03:25Z,"sounds like you have just enough ram to get it up and running,but not run anything,the boot wim is HUGE by boot disk standards!this live system is ok for my comp,but its specs are pretty good.should run ok on 4GB ram without too much problem.though iv seen it crash lesser comps.im thinking about making a series of smaller,more task focused systems(network hacking tools on one disk,disk image packages and the like on others0just to keep the recource comittments down to a handleable level and the boot wim would suit more comps in general,being smaller,less ran needed....in a few days ill be releasing a network hacker live disk,ill keep it small so ppl wont have any ram trouble....stay tuned and thank you:-)"
,redback38,2011-07-23T11:46Z,"stonie tonie:ill have a look at including Acronis Rescue Media 2011 to the iso,im in the process of adding the latest Hirens Rescue disk,looks successful so far,though at this stage i might simply make the 3 of them in a multiboot package to keep the ram problem at bay.....if you would like to try the mulitbooting of ur favourite .isos all on the one stick?....try the latest Neosmart Easy BCD....youll find i very easy to sort the boot editing issues.it has a great utility called ireboot too....very usefull when running it in PE to reboot into other .isos on the stick.also Winbuilder 80 has a great script to make a bootable win7/linux/Acronis/win XP PE/ USB....:-)check my ouher torrents too.....ill get back to you on the Acronis thing in a little while:-)"
