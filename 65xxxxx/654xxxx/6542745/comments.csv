[V],GunningHawk90,2011-07-16T07:16Z,"I wanted to seed, but for some reason I just couldn't connect. I'll be seeding the whole day today."
,shamelesspunk247,2011-07-18T23:57Z,any chance you could upload the complete dark tower comic series?
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-07-19T08:11Z,"Since, I don't follow this series, I really don't know the chronology. But, mirrormaster82's uploaded quite a few of them."
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-07-19T08:12Z,"If, its not complete, tell me the exact names of the story arcs and I'll try to upload as many as I can."
,unnim2,2011-07-30T06:22Z,thanks very much. Mirrormaster82 has almost all of them. except for this one. and Sheemies tale. could you please upload that? thanks again.
,unnim2,2011-07-30T06:32Z,very strange. shows 7 seeders but no download happening. :-(
,unnim2,2011-07-30T06:44Z,"oops.. just read this on wiki... ""Sheemie's Tale, a one-shot that's meant to serve as an interlude between The Journey Begins and The Little Sisters of Eluria, was originally scheduled for publication in November 2010, then postponed to January 26, 2011, and has since been indefinitely put on hiatus"".
