Release Title: The Sum of All Fears 2002 720p BRRip H264 AAC-GreatMagician (Kingdom-Release)
Directed By: Phil Alden Robinson
Tagline: When the president of Russia suddenly dies, a man whose politics are virtually
unknown succeeds him. The change in political leaders sparks paranoia among
American CIA officials, so CIA director Bill Cabot recruits a young analyst to
supply insight and advice on the situation. Then the unthinkable happens: a nuclear
bomb explodes in a U.S. city, and America is quick to blame the Russians.
