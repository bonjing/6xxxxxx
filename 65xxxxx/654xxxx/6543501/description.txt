This little gem is out of print, and is extremely rare and hard to find. It used to be an annual staple that my family played every Christmastime growing up. This is the unabridged original story of the Nutcracker, by E.T.A. Hoffman, read brilliantly by Christopher Plummer, with music from the ballet of the same name by Tchaikovsky, as performed by the Philharmonia Orchestra, conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas. It was originally released in 1985, and is currently out of print on both audio cassette and CD. This past Christmas, I found the original audio cassettes in a box, and decided to transfer them digitally. The recording is split into 6 AAC audio tracks (from 3 audio cassettes, 2 sides on each). Enjoy! I hope it brings you and your family as much joy as it has brought mine over the years. 


Enjoy and Seed!!
