Recently described as a rising star of the Derbyshire music scene, following his BBC Young Folk Award nomination. David is already impressing with his pure, passionate, folk-inspired singing and guitar playing.
There Are Birds in my Garden is the second album release from David Gibb, BBC Young Folk Award nominee (2011). The album features an array of tradtional and self-penned songs which have a refreshing and contemporary twist, aided by his very talented band, The Pony Club, who consist of Elly Lucas on fiddle, Julian Butt on accordion, Ben Dew on percussion and Sam Jordan on bass. A number of guest artists/musicians also step in to help out including BBC Young Folk Award Finalist Lucy Ward who features on Gospel of the Sun which was recorded live.

David Gibb kicks the album off with the retelling of the tradtional folk song â€˜A Begging I Will Go.â€™ A poignant look back at his early days when the pay was not exactly generous which required some quick thinking and opportunistic busking to cover petrol and food expenses. They are thankfully doing a lot better today.

There Are Birds in my Garden is more weighted on the self-penned side although other favourite traditional folk songs such as Green Grows the Laurel and a very old English round Summer is a Cumen also feature. The balance between the two works well as David has a natural songwriting ability and weaves songs together from past memories or snippets of history with remarkable ease for a twenty year old. Whether they be about that journey from childhood to adulthood (Annie Rose and Alfie) or the arrogance of youth (This Young Boy) they are both captivating and entertaining.

His inventiveness is something which shines throughout the album, not just in the contemporary folk musical arrangements but also in how some of the songs have evolved which give an insight into his storytelling talents which won him the title of Young Story Teller Of The Year following a national competition organised by The Tradtional Arts Team. 

Invention is balanced with inquistiveness and humour on Two Dead Boys, a song he recalled singing after school. After some research he found the song had a lot of extra verses and variationsâ€¦he opted for the â€œdaftestâ€ one! David admits to having an obsessions with â€œall things kids TVâ€ which he pays homage to on Rag Tag and Bobintail, as well as childrens books on Annie Rose and Alfie. 

Whilst many of the songs are light-hearted there are the more serious reflections. The very moving and beautiful song Jack McGee on which he wanted to â€œtry and create a sense of the peoplesâ€™ inability to understand what the soldiers in the trenches had gone through.â€

David Gibb has all the signs of someone who is going to be big on the folk music scene. His songs and musical arrangements are original and cleverly constructed, he will definately capture the hearts of many out there, both young and old. There Are Birds in my Garden set out to convey the infectious energy of his live performances, it doesnâ€™t fail. He is definately a name to watch out for on the folk circuit and beyond, donâ€™t miss him!
