This is the PAL to Xvid version that we found on the net and bring to you as-is
We added several subtitles that we fixed to fit the format of a split 
file movie (Movie is in two equal part avi files - as thats how we found them)

Subtitles for Polish, Spanish, Russian and an English template too is
included for whatevr othe rlanguage conversion needs you might have.
We could only at this point find the ones included here for you initially.


This is a movie which has remained with me for years since I first enjoyed
it at a small Toronto movie theater back in 1988 when it was released.

There is great charm to Paris in the 20s - multiculturalism is unheard of
although there is a "new kid in town with money toburn" played by John Lone
with an intense effect on the woman of Italy (lovely Ms. Linda Fiorentino) 
that he is teamed with in sexual engagement - although in a completely misfitted
situation to what is the alternative offered by the character of Artist/ Art forger Keith Carradine in the movie as he comes to save the day, as a man with
a much lighter touch on the senses I submit entirely with sincerety too.

Wallace Shawn (My Dinner with Andre) describes (boxer) Lone's character as 
"trying to buy his way into (Parisian) cluture"

Its a nice movie to have and with great romantic passion on the part
of Ms. Fiorentino that seeks to be given justice as her sort rarely
has found in human history - Im sorry to say - yet she has survived
and in fine spirits indeed - to be the real thing too - equally - and
oerhaps even as she takes turns on the stage while deferring ultimately
to those that survived more able to continue into an eternity this way 
such as those that have the Melanie Griffith secret of success in maintaing
a clearly most vibrant spirit.
