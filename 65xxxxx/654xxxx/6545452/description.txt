 Presenting a comprehensive overview of the design automation algorithms, tools, and methodologies used to design integrated circuits, the Electronic Design Automation for Integrated Circuits Handbook is available in two volumes. The first volume, EDA for IC System Design, Verification, and Testing, thoroughly examines system-level design, microarchitectural design, logical verification, and testing. Chapters contributed by leading experts authoritatively discuss processor modeling and design tools, using performance metrics to select microprocessor cores for IC designs, design and verification languages, digital simulation, hardware acceleration and emulation, and much more.
