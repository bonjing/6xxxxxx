It's a Marketing strategy I think.

throw out a good product or an item to pull in more customers - then throw out another good product to keep them happy and to bring more.

*shrug* I like Ella anyway."
,captainkhaos1966,2011-07-15T07:10Z,"Thanks WMI. Well she didn't follow Virginia's example but pic 064, if you don't think what I am thinking you must be dead. Looks like she knows what to do with her beautiful mouth :) "
,Sumiha,2011-07-15T07:58Z,"Like I said on Virginia's posting keep your expectations low. And why ask Ella to act as if she's below 10 years old in this set?

+ to WMI but not to FG.

,slee2099,2011-07-15T23:47Z,I'm more excited by next weeks update
,Rigel71,2011-07-16T03:33Z,"Thanks as always WMI.

Can someone post Ella set #190? That's the old FF series. Thanks!"
,shdwolf1,2011-07-16T05:25Z,"Time will tell if Virginia's last set was a turning point, or a lone tease followed by more dept store poses. Looks like someone at FG's trying to prolong the mystery, but I think they're just losing the interest of the majority. To be fair, these 3 will always have a fan base, but that won't mean much if they can't get more paying members interested. Too much out there to play puritan forever; fans will eventually go elsewhere...
As always WMI, thx for your hard work, it is appreciated..."
,jfk213,2011-07-17T21:47Z,Where can i find something a little more hardcore ?
