,Garandir,2011-07-24T06:08Z,I'm really not quite sure why this torrent has been given 4 negative quality votes. It's LAME CBR @ 320kbps.

This is the exact copy of your upload:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6566033

Uploaded 8 days after you.
Seed is just double of ur one.
Quality hits: Just 4 times better than this one.

Now just go and do exactly what you did to me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

@ all downloaders:

This is a very good copy and personally checked by me. So please don't trust the negative quality hits. Download this stuff and encourage this new uploader.

His attitude is not related to his upload's quality. So: a (+1) quality hit from me. Cheers."
