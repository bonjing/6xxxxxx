    A Caucasian youth lives with his African-American grandparents,          
    forced to endure the problems of being someone not fully part of         
    either culture. The youth learns that his mother is a prostitute, and    
    he is the result of an encounter between her and one of her Caucasian    
    clients. The boy also finds out that he is staying with his              
    grandparents because his mother doesn't want him since in her            
    business there is no place for raising children.
