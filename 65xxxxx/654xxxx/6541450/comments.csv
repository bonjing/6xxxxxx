,CplRowan,2011-07-15T08:28Z,Sorry the instructions were from my previous compressed version that went bolo on me so I had to extract it to get it to upload properly (i'm new to uploading) and don't worry I test everything and install before uploading I am a fair captain of the seas and I hate fucking viruses! hemp I will see what I can do for you bro

,Ingrimm,2011-07-15T19:24Z,thanks alot for uploading
,EpixWin,2011-07-15T21:03Z,It seems like I'm unable to save.
,lunarman,2011-07-16T03:14Z,is there a way to change the resolution on the game cause when i try to change it. that game automatically becomes unresponsive each time.
,CplRowan,2011-07-16T04:29Z,"Save by hitting escape and selecting save and continue, im not sure if there is a autosave feature and you should be able to change the resolution when you launch the game if im not mistaken"
,mofmanstu,2011-07-16T05:19Z,The res change issues is actually an issue with the game itself.
,Rayan1337,2011-07-17T01:42Z,"Smooth torrent,didn't require extracting for me."
,kaliver,2011-07-17T02:39Z,the game release itself does have some bugs so if you run into any problems it's very likely the game and not the uploader at fault. thought i'd throw that out there before someone pitches a fit.
,EpixWin,2011-07-17T22:16Z,After quite a lot of raging and mess ups. I found out that it's quite impossible to actually beat this game unless you cheat.
,Digger77,2011-07-18T07:14Z,what vX.X version is this one? the newest with bug fixes or older?
,CplRowan,2011-07-18T18:10Z,"This is the original, I am working on getting the patched version"
,Airwalker486,2011-07-19T15:12Z,"Thanx for the upload! Been waiting for this one :p
But could you  store the files in one folder? It confused me at first xd great upload though, keep up the work!"
,CplRowan,2011-07-20T07:07Z,"Yeah sorry, this was my first upload next one will be cleaner"
,Bakum,2011-07-20T21:23Z,"Thanks a bunch man, I'm loving this game.

Hope you can get the patched version soon!"
,CplRowan,2011-07-20T22:48Z,"Here is a link to a patched version I am going to be uploading it soon also if you guys want me to

,CplRowan,2011-07-20T23:04Z,"AV went crazy on that download so im going to work on my own download, most likely false but I dont like taking chances, 1.03 will be up in about ten minutes"

Thank you for great release/upload and thank you for seeding at such an high speed"
,epochflail,2012-02-16T07:04Z,"Can someone paste the current patch set for all OSs? Anyone that got the HIB this was in would have access to the 1.0.9 rev.B patch. I can only find the official ""http://torrents.humblebundle.com"" version of the initial 1.0.7 HIB release which is unplayably crashy for me. Random crashes, often crashes moving between leaves, can't complete several missions as the game crashes on picking up the quest item, can't complete the game as I can't get to level 4, game crashes on every stairwell.

I mean when the game runs it's pretty good and damn funny, but it's got the mental stability of Charles Manson."
,jebusfuss,2012-03-20T02:16Z,whats with the 4001 files?
