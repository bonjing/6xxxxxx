Michael Hordern reads MR James
The Complete Argo Collection

In the 1980s, a series of four double audio cassette collections were released by
Argo Records featuring, in total, nineteen unabridged MR James stories narrated by Michael Hordern.
These are my preferred readings of MR James. It's just a shame there are so few stories in total.

The 4 collections were titled:-
Ghost Stories (1982)
More Ghost Stories (1984)
A Warning to the Curious and other Ghost Stories (1985)
Number 13 and other Ghost Stories (1988)

Ghost Stories 1982
The Ash Tree
Rats
A School Story
The Haunted Dolls' House
The Diary of Mr Poynter

More Ghost Stories 1984
There was a man dwelt by a Churchyard
Lost Hearts
Oh, Whistle, and I'll come to you, my lad
The Mezzotint
Casting the Runes

A Warning to the Curious and other Ghost Stories 1985
Stories I have tried to write
The Uncommon Prayer-book
A Warning to the Curious
A Neighbour's Landmark
The Rose Garden

Number 13 and other Ghost Stories 1988
Count Magnus
Canon Alberics Scrap-book
The Stalls of Barchester
Number 13

All files are 128 kbps stereo except the third collection from 1985 which is 48 kbps mono.
There's one exception in the 1985 set. That is for the story A Warning to the Curious itself which I
ripped from the BFI DVD of the BBC TV version of the story from 1972 where it's included as an extra.
It's in stereo at 128 kbps.


Enjoy and Seed!!
