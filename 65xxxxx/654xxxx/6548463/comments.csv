, Oh, and most importantly, enjoy!"
,KWAME-FLIP,2011-07-23T15:05Z,"Stuck at 98.1% along with a lot of others, can you seed it to 100%?"
,jkushka,2011-07-24T20:33Z,"The first 4 episodes are bugged.

File size "
,DarthPS3,2011-07-26T20:45Z,"Re-seeding my torrents, starting now. I'm not going to be responding directly to comments anymore, but if you leave any issues you have in the torrent's comments, you can be assured that I do check them all regularly, and will continue to post and seed torrents. 

If the first few don't work on this when I check 'em, I will post a FIX torrent before moving on to the next season. "

,Toniknak,2011-09-07T00:40Z,"Just to reiterate jkushka's comment, the first four (well, five actually) episodes are screwed - check the file sizes.

Suggest you download this torrent instead and use MKV2VOB to remux them into an mpg container:

,DarthPS3,2011-09-11T04:29Z,"I checked those episodes on my PS3, so I uploaded the files that needed fixing on it. If we are still having issues with the rest I can definitely up a fix. Long Live Mad Men, I hope it comes back next summer."
,DarthPS3,2011-09-11T04:35Z,"Ah, the fixed episodes were supposed to go into the FIX torrent that is 3-4, so I'll do one with 1-2 and 5."
,moto.,2012-02-11T02:03Z,"episode 1,2,3,4,5 is bugged, episode 6 is from s03... If you have those episodes, please make a new torrent. I really want to see this =)"
