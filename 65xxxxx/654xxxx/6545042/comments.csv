,EricRoyz,2011-07-21T11:33Z,"Rocking Torrent,
Thanks Rjaa;"
,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-07-22T12:18Z,"RELEASE IS DODGY
1) File size is smaller than previous GP versions, not normal
2) The printing has issues, Part of the end of each line is cutoff, and there is at least a 5 second delay for printing. This was NOT evident in previous versions.

BE WARNED"

good luck"
,plujfaf,2011-07-26T01:23Z,"yet another torrent without an explanitory comment, i suppose its my duty.

this torrent works fine.
to install:
1. download the torrent to find the "".rar"" file, extract this file using extraction software e.g. winrar
2. open the ""setup"" file and follow it like normal until it asks you for a username and ID, where you shall type anything you want, as many letters as can fit 
3. click OFFLINE activation
4. when it asks you for the serial number just use the same username/id (i cant remember which one it asked for) as you did before, put this in the KEYGEN
5. copy and paste into the installation prompt
and it should work."

,KopsY,2011-08-29T02:36Z,"I installed it, I registered with the keygen but when I open a GP file..e.g from Ultimate Guitar it doesn't sound..plus when I open GP 6 and start composing it doesn't sound again..It says I need soundbanks and suggests me to open the updater..but when I open the updater it can't log me in..So in a few words..NO SOUND IN GUITAR PRO 6...help..!!"
,Guitarlst,2011-08-29T20:36Z,"My virusprogram F-Secure found during downloading this virus (and deleted virus ofcourse right away) . But this has virus inside, beware."
,diogotome,2011-09-01T16:25Z,"I am having the same problem as KopsY, sound doesnt work! Help anyone? thanks"
,wesman2232,2011-09-01T22:39Z,Is this 6.0.9 or 6.0.7?
,pobeydood,2011-09-02T04:30Z,"For some reason the ""Offline Activation"" button is greyed out for me."
,Akaforty163,2011-09-15T15:27Z,"Great torrent!
6.0.1 was crashing alot on some notes, this one works so far. I scanned this file with up to date Eset (15/9/2011) and nothing came out, it's clean."
,hotgp,2011-09-25T06:41Z,"somehow the keygen is not getting executed on my computer, so can someone paste an activation key using their keygen

,corai12,2012-01-13T12:52Z,In the user name just put anything and the offline button should appear!
,Volcanthegreat,2012-03-05T06:16Z,"Works awesome! Way better than guitar pro 5.2! But downloading the soundbank is a pain! 1.7gb just for sound?

Downloading guitar pro 6 indivitually would be best. Then you can chose the kind of guitar sounds you'd like with your guitar pro!"
,Fawers,2012-03-07T20:30Z,"So this version comes not with RSE?
GREAT. I never use it. It slows my computer down. Thank you.
MIDI + Soundfonts > RSE"
