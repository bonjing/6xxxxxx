,Steveatron,2011-07-18T15:14Z,Do not download...Immerse's coding makes the file crash at certain point. wait for another upload or dw the non 720p...Otherwise it's a waste
[T],bobnjeff,2011-07-18T15:51Z,that happened a couple weeks ago that's to bad
,peervdb,2011-07-18T17:41Z,"Never had this problem, works fine..."
,RaW-D-Coy,2011-07-18T18:06Z,"eztv pleas make the pain stopp, let DIMENSION do a nise codec on the 720p  PLEASE. it works great with vlc but i like to use windows media player cuz its aloot sharper than VLC ...."
,mrdoubleb,2011-07-18T19:07Z,"IMMERSE is using a new encoder which inaccurately sets the audio sampling rate at ""0"" instead of ""48,000 Hz"" in the file properties. This crashes some SW and many (all?) HW decoders, like standalone players, TVs, etc.

I found a workaround at this thread:

,LanMax,2011-07-18T22:22Z,I will let you guys know how this goes. I've been viewing this guy's videos and have not experienced issues. 
,manwich49,2011-07-18T23:09Z,"mrdoubleb is correct, I get a 403 on his link though. If you can't see it here's another link that tells you how to fix: http://forum1.netgear.com/showpost.php?s=b743a30f20d9643b19f24323e58b8286&p=357731&postcount=28"

,teabare,2011-07-19T02:43Z,Thank you!
,LanMax,2011-07-19T07:00Z,"UPDATE::----

This works just fine just as every other previous files. Stop complaining. If you can't make it work, then you should not be here."
,2toast,2011-07-19T09:44Z,Works fine for me using VLC.
,Rift-Nightblade,2011-07-20T20:05Z,"@mrdoubleb:
You sir, are a genius. I have spent days trying to re-code-remux, clear header compression etc... I followd the instructions, made a batch file and set the freq. as you said, and all my files from Immerse now work!!!! I can stream them over to my Samsung Blu-ray....  
To the people playing this on your computer using VLC... this will not affect you."
,ahorwood,2011-07-22T16:56Z,Thanks again. I love your stuff.
,e-Marc,2011-07-26T21:44Z,"My ASUS O!Play says ""invalid file"" and my Notebook's VLC-Player just gets stuck before it even gets going. Can't play it, unfortunately!"
,illusion121,2011-08-01T03:35Z,Does not play audio on my LG BD670 3D bluray player!
,ssasu,2011-08-02T01:18Z,Do not download! It doesnt work on many players!
,ssasu,2011-08-02T04:00Z,I changed my mind - after repair its goood.
