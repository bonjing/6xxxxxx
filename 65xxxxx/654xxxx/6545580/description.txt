 Concert:  A special Mother`s Day show. Perhaps the best concert of this Tahoe gig. Elvis is in an exzellent mood and gives all he was able to, vocally and physically. 
Very interesting setlist with highlights like My Way, It`s Over, Release Me or the very rare Faded Love ! 


With covers. Enjoy!
