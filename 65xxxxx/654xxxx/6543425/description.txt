  London-based Kanav Chhadha is pressured      
  by his parents to marry Amritsar-based       
  Ashmeet Kaur, the non-graduate daughter      
  of Sujan Singh, a childhood friend of        
  Kanav's dad. The engagement takes place      
  in the Soni Darbar, and the families,        
  together with friends, board three train     
  coaches - duly decorated for the occasion    
  - to travel to Mumbai for a five-star        
  wedding and reception. The couple have a     
  room to themselves and decide to share       
  their feelings while the rest of their       
  respective families and friends sing and     
  dance. Kanav finds out that she is in        
  love with Kuljit Singh, a Gurdwara singer,   
  but her parents do not approve of him as he  
  is not wealthy, sophisticated, and does not  
  even know how to wear a Pagdi properly, while
  he confides that he is not yet ready for     
  marriage. Hilarious chaos results when the   
  duo decide to make their incompatibility     
  known to their respective parents.
