,MAD100007,2011-07-15T09:46Z,"Black Ops is done, you can find it here:

,MAD100007,2011-07-20T09:56Z,"This doesn't work for me anymore. I don't know if it's me or the new microsoft update. The profile used to start-up the game is banned from XBL, it was already banned while I uploaded, but there was a way to login on XBL with banned accounts. New update fucked that..."
,FoxyBoy,2011-07-21T01:55Z,"It did the same to me today, MAD...
It's not letting me launch MW2, but will still let me sign into the account..."
,Super_Ali_Baba,2011-07-21T19:02Z,the DLCs work but not the GoD
,MAD100007,2011-07-27T19:58Z,"@FoxyBoy,

You can sign-in but not on xbl, you need to be signed-in on xbl... DLCs work."
,MAD100007,2011-08-05T10:26Z,"There's a new way to get around the new update:

1. press guide button ...sign in to modded profile ...as soon as the profile picture stats to show up press guide button again to sign in successfully..

2. start the game.. it will tell u to sign it with the profile that has bought the game...

3. IMPORTANT********

select sign in..

but don't select profile..

instead press Y to create new profile.

4. now press guide button again. the pop up window be gone..

5. now press guide button again and sign out of modded profile and sign in to ur own profile....



Thanks to Suvomania "

Cheers for the up matey i'm gettin there ;)"
,MAD100007,2011-08-08T14:08Z,"yes, apply the update. The start-up account needs to be online on XBL, do the tip I said before you avoid the XBL ban."

,brstarks,2011-08-28T05:20Z,"wow nevermind sorry guys its still works it just took a while to understand because of this new update. you seriously need to press the xbox button at the right time to successfully go online, it took a while but i finally got it. no one fucked it up. it still works."
,spartan1195,2011-08-28T22:42Z,"yeah Brandon, had the same issue. Once you have the Xbox button timing down, you get it everytime lol. "
,SouryDiesel,2011-09-02T04:10Z,I don't understand. I have tried everything multiple times and I have read every single word on this page. I get Modern Warfare 2 can't launch 99% of and one time my screen went completely black and I had to restart my xbox. Anyone have any ideas?
,spartan1195,2011-09-05T21:24Z,"just a quick word of caution using non jtags, there LOTS of people getting banned accounts because of these. Use at your own risk ;)"
,deedone22,2011-09-07T15:44Z,ik the way how to log in to banned accounts to do u must press the guide button at right time before its says that u been banned and if done right u should be log in to that account and be online but when u try mw2 it ask to log in to account that has this game purchase press Y then the guide button  then u can log off that account then on to ur account if u want to play add me deedone22
