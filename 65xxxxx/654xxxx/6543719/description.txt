Nuer Journeys, Nuer Lives: Sudanese Refugees in Minnesota 
(Part of the New Immigrants Series)

Jon D. Holtzman (Author), Nancy Foner (Author)

This book examines contemporary migration to the United States through a surprising and compelling case study the Nuer of Sudan, whose traditional life represents one of the most important case studies in the history of anthropology. In understanding the experiences of the Nuer, readers will not only gain insights into the world of the refugee problem and the role of immigration in the Unites States, they will also learn about the features of Nuer life which are considered a standard part of the anthropology curriculum. The book juxtaposes elements of Nuer culture which are well-known within anthropology and featured in most anthropology textbooks with new developments arising from the immigration of many other Nuer to the U.S. in the 1990s as refugees from civil war in southern Sudan. Consequently, this book will fit well within existing anthropology curricula, while providing an important update on descriptions of traditional life. In addition to fascinating vignettes and case studies, this book provides an opportunity to examine issues of current importance within anthropology, such as social change, transnationalism, displacement, and diaspora in a way which is easy to understand and through a familiar example. For anyone interested in cultural anthropology, race, and ethnicity.
