God of War is an action adventure video game for the PlayStation 2 first released by Sony Computer Entertainment's Santa Monica division in March 2005. It was the first game to be released in the God of War franchise.
Loosely based on Greek mythology, the game focuses on protagonist Kratos and forms part of a saga (chronologically the second chapter in the God of War series) with vengeance as a central theme.
Kratos must stop the God of War, Ares, from destroying the city of Athens by finding the fabled Pandora's Box.
