HEART STILL BEATING isn't Roxy in prime form, but it is a good representation of their later work and it covers one song not represented anywhere else (Neil Young's Like a Hurricane). Clearly this tour was a compromise between their solo work and group compositions. Ferry is in fine form and the band's playing is impeccable. Manzanera rips off some fiery solos. Fans of the late period wistful Roxy Music will like this disc: this is not the fire-breathing live band of the early-to-mid-period, but a subdued mature version.
