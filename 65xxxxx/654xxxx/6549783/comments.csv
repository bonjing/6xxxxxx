,eamo12345,2011-08-03T16:46Z,Sorry I'm a noob. What do I do with the 9 parts? When I try and sync to iTunes individually it says they are invalid. My iPhone is jailbroken btw.
,sm1nvv,2011-08-12T21:25Z,You must extract them before you can use the program.
,hummad21,2011-09-25T23:51Z,"Guys, Im hving some prob here.
I extracted using WinRar. It gave me 9 files in total of 200 MB each. Now, when extracting they r all same names. I have iPhone 3GS. I dont have any TomTom app installed previously and installing 1st time.
I extracted Part01 n put it in itunes library and then tried synching to my iphone. It gave me error after reaching 50% installation. And it does the same with all other parts. I have tried Part 1 to 4. Same results. Please help."
