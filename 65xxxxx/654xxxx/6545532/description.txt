Renewal Coaching: Sustainable Change for Individuals and Organizations


It is a well-accepted fact that failure to engage in sustainable change can be deadly for both individuals and organizations.?But why then is change so hard? The enormous wealth of change literature currently available is largely focused on satisfaction, efficiency, and effectiveness.?While these are worthy goals, they remain insufficient. In order to help individuals, teams, and complex organizations create and sustain change some-thing different is needed. Renewal Coaching offers a research-based, sustainable approach to individual and organizational improvement that involves a disciplined and collaborative sequence of information, experimentation, feedback, and support.
