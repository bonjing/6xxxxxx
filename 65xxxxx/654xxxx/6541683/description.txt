 On June 28 through July 1 of 2006, a NATO Advanced Research Workshop was held in Kyiv, Ukraine. This workshop brought the top researchers in Fuzzy GIS together, both from NATO countries as well as partner countries. The workshop focused on how uncertainty and fuzziness can be better modelled and implemented in Geographic Information Science to help decision makers make more informed choices, especially as they pertain to environmental security and protection.
