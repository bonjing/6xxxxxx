,mutabah,2011-07-16T14:57Z,"@ferdie82x From watching the first chunk, it seems to be the second episode, It's hard to tell if you are implying that this is the first."

[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2011-07-16T18:17Z,"its episode 2 as stated
airs on bbc next friday "
,iesbenji1,2011-07-17T13:12Z,"brilliant thanks, V10-A10
the only thing that bugs me is, torchwood is made by the BBC, so why does america get it one week before us?
thanks for the upload anyway"
,Midna_,2011-07-18T11:14Z,"This series is being funded by the American network it's being shown on, Starz or something? That's why it's being shown there a week earlier.

The thing that *I* find odd, is that here in Australia we get it a day after America. I think it's on pay TV or Digital, neither of which I have, so I have to download it."
,ripper30,2011-07-19T01:33Z,"THIS IS EPISODE 2. AND ITS MADE IN AMERICA BY STARZ, A PRIMIUM CHANNEL LIKE HBO, SHOWTIME.AND IT DOES COST EXTRA TO GET STARZ, HBO ,SHOWTIME, THE MOVIE CHANNEL. SO THX 4 THE UPLOAD, MUCH THX WHALE..."
