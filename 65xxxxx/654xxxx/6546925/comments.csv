[T],Zeberzee,2011-07-17T15:31Z,@reichert....look at my info.... thats the 4GB bluray i used to make this 700mb file...thats how BRRip's are made...we take  a 4GB or higher file and make smaller files..its not rocket science....we already know bluray files are better quality than brrips.... i felt i had to explain that because you sound like an idiot....now piss off and dont come to my comments again

 ""Zeberzee"" is known for foul & uncontrolled language usage...

But then it's always difficulty to understand how very simple mind work. 

Just look how many (little) seeder this torren has...

I rest my case.

not everyone can download big sized files...So here are the small ones.
I don't want to argue with a fool like you and I don't intend to explain anything to you.

One suggestion..""Get your shit straight ASAP"""
