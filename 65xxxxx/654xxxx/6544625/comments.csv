I would say watch the sample. Everybody has another opinion about quality ;)
Personally I think it is watchable and I normally watch 720p+ versions. But I will still wait for better quality

Sorry for my spelling"
,karatekid11,2011-07-17T00:44Z,"thanks dude, i already watched it. and like you said before, its watchable copy... waiting also for better quality:)"
,h3ld3r_kid,2011-07-18T02:10Z,A and V? anyone see it?
,LozRiva,2011-07-18T17:36Z,"a/9 v6-7 watchable and sound good. if you aren't in too much of a rush o watch i would wait for a dvd-rip copy or similar. i will be downloading again when a better format is released i think. nut for now this is good considering when film was released and looks centered on screen also...
thank-you to uploader"
