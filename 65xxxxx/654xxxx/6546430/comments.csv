,Hellboy86,2011-07-21T12:18Z,"I'm still stuck at 31.4%... Conker76, could you please seed just for a little longer, so that we can get a couple of seeders?

Once i finish downloading, i'll seed for a few days, no problem. But for that, i need to complete it..."
,Conker76,2011-07-21T13:06Z,"yea will do, im sorry i live in australia and we have shit house net over here so for the house hold to get good internet i can only download and seed at night. sorry again guys!"
,Hellboy86,2011-07-21T21:10Z,"Conker76, thank you very much. I'll wait to download from you whenever you can seed, then.

I'll seed to keep it alive after downloading.
I just hope others do it too, instead of doing the usual ""hit & run""..."
