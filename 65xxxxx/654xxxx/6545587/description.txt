Pokemon: The First movie. Best enjoyed while high. Both English and Japanese audio, and likewise for subtitles. Be a snob, use the subs.


In event of sugar poisoning, administer Rule 34.

This is the original cut, not the wimp-out US release that cuts the dark bits out. Enjoy child-death and find the real reason for Mewtwo's angstyness.
