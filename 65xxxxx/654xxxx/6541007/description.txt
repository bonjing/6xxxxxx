"Go ahead and upload it, it's not like anyone's going to buy it anyways" - Wareya, artist of the album

this copy was downloaded right from the bandcamp site 
http://wareya.bandcamp.com/album/into-the-dark
"In White" previously appeared on a Futures Passed album so it is downloadable there for free
"Megaroide" is directly inspired by another song so it's also downloadable there for free
apparently
I highly recommend you buy this album, it's really cheap and very unique

The author is very clearly to me a genius and is desolate and poor, you should definitely support him and buy the album, especially since it costs of an elementary school kid's lunch money

so as far as the story goes, i'm going to make a lot of assumptions here
the author said it was a concept album about heroism, and had a story, so I'm going to assume there's a main character
now just from the flow of the album I can tell that it's all from the protagonist's point of view

The introduction shows off a couple of the things that keep showing up in the album's composition: melodies with genius usage of tension, arpeggios with harmonics not in that chord, and impossible chord progressions that pull through by abusing dissonance. i could also assume that it makes an emotional base for the beginning of the next song, where i assume something bad happened to the main character
Light in the Dark is, by its name, about hope in desperation
Herever is a chord progression with no melody or anything, as an arpeggio. it's just uplifting so that means they got out of whatever was bad for them, we can assume that they have some connection to something because the name is a portamenteau of "here" and "ever"
Outside is very happy and has segments where the treble and melody/bass split apart in how it feels so that the bass and melody feel relieved and serene where the treble feels high and eurphoric
In White is a christmas song, and at one point the author had lyrics (though it's an instrumental song, so they must have just been there for completion's sake) in the description for it on his soundcloud, which said "Between these golden arches, I see need, in white" which gave the song both its name and its concept - it's about helping something needy
Lights of Time is very slow and solemn, and has the melody that  shows up later in Come Back Alive, which makes me think that the song is about getting the power to do something heroic
Duty is self-explanatory
Come Back Alive is ridiculous. Wareya called it "the herocore anthem", and that herocore was a joke genre made to mock certain kinds of fake chiptunes. the song is extremely heroic and extremely trancey, the most repetitive thing on the entire album, in a good way
Realization progresses from a small bit of an almost metallic intro into something I could almost call "8-bit screamo" though it of course isn't because this isn't a real chipmusic album and because there's no voice. it's obviously extremely tense and stressed, so that with the title makes it very fitting where it is
Submerge myself has a chord progression on an octatonic scale, and it is such a sad song. Basically I take it as the main character realizing they have to end something about themselves to do what's right
Megaroide is "a song about personal identity", to quote wareya
The Death of Phamson E. Chord is described by its title
Lullaby feels very peaceful and "the bad isn't really bad"-like. a fitting end for a heroic death of one kind or another.

so the protagonist ended themselves to do save what they lived for or identified with, basically

the entire album was composed in a tool called Musagi: http://www.drpetter.se/project_musagi.html
