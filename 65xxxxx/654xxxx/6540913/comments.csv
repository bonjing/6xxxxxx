,undefined36,2011-10-07T23:25Z,"You are all very welcome... just as a note... if you wanna edit the names of the books for you e-readers use CALIBRE. the default system i used for naming the books might not be what ya want and or come up funny looking.
just wanted to give you guys a heads up on that.. thanks"
