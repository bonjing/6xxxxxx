 While created primarily for language teachers, this encyclopedia is helpful to anyone interested in language. Entries from just a few lines or up to 3000 words range from acculturation and bilingual education to interpreting and total physical response (a language teaching method). The varying writing styles of contributors offer diversity and international scope. Many entries end with references and further reading lists. Readers who wish to know about a particular language issue may look in the thematic list of contents for the headword, go straight to the alphabetically arranged entries, or check the index. Editor Byram (modern languages, Univ. of Durham, UK) has expertise in this area, having authored Teaching and Assessing Intercultural Communicative Competence and Language Learning in Intercultural Perspective. Recommended for teacher college collections and for academic and public libraries serving language teachers and educators.
