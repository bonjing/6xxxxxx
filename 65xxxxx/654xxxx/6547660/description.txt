++How to Play Power Hour++

Grab some friends, some beer, this movie, and a shot glass for each person playing. Fill your shot glass with beer and prepare to play. A unique intro is played at the start of each clip, along with the clip number to let you know to drink your shot glass. After drinking, refill the shot glass as you watch the clip. Repeat this process for the entire video.

By the end, you should have drank between 5 to 7 beers depending how full you fill your shot glass. Further details are available in the "directions" part at the beginning of the video.

Happy drinking, and please spread the word!
