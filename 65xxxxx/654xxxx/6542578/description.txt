As a result of higher frequencies and increased user mobility, researchers and systems designers are shifting their focus from time-invariant models to channels that vary within a block. This book explains the latest theoretical advances and practical methods to give an understanding of rapidly time varying channels, together with performance trade-offs and potential performance gains, providing the expertise to develop future wireless systems technology.

As well as an overview of the issues of developing wireless systems using time-varying channels, the book gives extensive coverage to methods for estimating and equalizing rapidly time-varying channels, including a discussion of training data optimization, as well as providing models and transceiver methods for time-varying ultra-wideband channels.*
