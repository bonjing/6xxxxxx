,rosyjo11,2011-07-19T10:59Z,"thanks for the upload BONE.  Average quality, I guess slightly above average quality for a cam. Bit of a shame if this is your first viewing of the movie though. Seriously, dont deny yourself the opportunit of seeing this on the big screen, especially in 3D. After seeing it then watching this download it came off as pretty poor but still good to have and watch until a better one comes out later on. "
,takeaimnfire,2011-07-20T11:39Z,"These are not missing ten minutes.  It's only the credits, and the very beginning where it re-shows the final scene from part 1.  People keep complaining about missing time, but those are the only missing parts.  I've seen it in the theaters.  Previews started at 6:50pm, ended 7:05pm.  I was in the parking lot at 9:03pm.  The part everyone complaining about being missing is just the end scene from part 1.  Just had to post this, because I've seen people complaining on just about every post of this movie.  Oh, and the ""I'm alive"" from the goblin is cut too for some reason.  You're not missing anything.  The quality is also pretty decent for being out the day the movie came out.  I'm sure in time someone will have a nice HD cam rip when there's less people in the theaters.

Thanks to all the uploaders for these.  They did an awesome job with this one, and I had to watch it again. "
,oglecowboy,2011-07-20T19:20Z,Assuming this is the same as the Feel Fr one u uploaded: Here's the full scoop: There's only one minor skip in the beginning nothing crucial probably only a minute skip. Audio is out of sync in places but ok in the rest of the movie. Bone you did a good job on this one. I downloaded burned and watched. Like I said only one minor skip in the beginning. No end credits. So if u hear something different about this download don't believe it. Will seed max for the next 24 hours.
