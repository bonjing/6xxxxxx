another fresh new build from today of vlc 1.1.11 : July 15
still as beta stage but quite stable version from today anyway.
not official yet !
as usual,please enable,check and make a clean complete cache folder and preference as selection
when you will install this new version.
Note :
Japanese peeers are disallowed to use utorrent v3 for this torrent as all any slow peers,otherwise you get nothing or fail to download or finishing-completing this one.Or they absolutely must disable DNA acceleration on setting option menu for best chance to download and decrease any possible traffic congestion as well.And if you freeze,don't insisting too much !
review and see what's wrong with you first anyway.
Algerian,Thaiwan,African and Chinese connection might be also concerned as well.
Please,guys,respect my seed and don't freeze and ruin it so.
Otherwise use older version of utorrent from 1.8.5 from 2.2.1 max !
1.8.5 should probably give you some best results i guess.
to all :
On a torrent,if you see that you give too fast up speed,please,slow down it to help the other peers also.
slow connection peers must absolutely give their max up speed to get a real chance to connect on torrent download.
you can also try to adjust,set and jungle between high,normal and low priority
to help you connecting as well.A reset peer connection can also help a bit sometimes.
Best is to set your up and down speed to : 0 (unlimited)
make a speed test to find best value for your own internet connection if needed.
Enjoy and remember :
always give a suffisant up speed and this,every time you go on torrent.
a large list of trackers is joined to this torrent for best speed quality.
Ty for understanding
Enjoy
