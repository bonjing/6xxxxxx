Founded overnight by monkeys with typewriters, Washed Up Scenesters

are yet another group of amateurists copycats who merely poses to

look good while getting our uberly huge cocks sucked by the ladies.



Having no clue what our purpose is (nor why we are doing it...

nor how!) we are speeding ahead full throttle in the (c) jihad.
