The Big Valley
Green Acres
Lost in Space
The Wild Wild West
The F.B.I

and, my favorite from that year...
""Run For Your Life"" with Ben Gazarra

Holy Smokes, with so much good stuff on TV, it's no wonder I flunked out of college and got drafted."

attempt at a request. ;)

I didn't see Honey West when it originally aired
'cause I was just a wee bit too young back then.
I don't even recall it in reruns in the US during the late sixties or seventies. I only first
discovered it in reruns in Europe twenty years ago.

Anyway...I don't have those other series, but if
you're interested and have the time, bandwidth, and inclination, there are torrents here for seasons 1-3 of both Green Acres and Lost in Space. Happy downloading! :)"
