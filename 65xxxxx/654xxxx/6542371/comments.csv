,tannerman,2011-07-15T20:31Z,"WARNING: this one has cuts all over it.
first cut i noticed was arround the 2 min mark when the goblin should reply something like ""i'm alive""
but it just skips that. god knows what else been cut.

with all those cuts this movie is not complete.
all releases are 1h 57 min, while it should be 2h 10 min (excluding the credits) "
