Use FileMakerÂ® technologies to create powerful mobile data apps for iPhoneÂ®, iPodÂ® touch, and iPadâ„¢

Appleâ€™s FileMaker technologies make it easy to create powerful, data-driven apps for iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, and any mobile deviceâ€™s web browser. In this book, leading FileMaker and iOS expert Jesse Feiler teaches you all the skills and techniques youâ€™ll need, whether youâ€™re a developer, knowledge worker, or manager.

Feiler thoroughly reviews each strategy for delivering mobile data using FileMaker Pro, FileMaker Server, FileMaker Go, and Bento. Youâ€™ll learn how mobile data-driven apps are different from traditional desktop-driven apps, and how to create highly usable interfaces for them.
