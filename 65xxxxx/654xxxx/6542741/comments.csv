first cut i noticed was arround the 2 min mark when the goblin should reply something like ""i'm alive""
but it just skips that. god knows what else been cut.

with all those cuts this movie is not complete. "

,azer000,2011-07-15T18:59Z,"Why the hell do you all keep uploading the same stupid version? The audio is English, but there are 25 cuts in this video, in Imagines version, and in every bloody version on this site; just stop uploading until you've got the complete one, for God's sake..."
,theeGRated,2011-07-16T02:05Z,STOP POSTING TO GO TO OTHER SITES! they all have surveys
,dinosaur58,2011-07-16T06:10Z,"Quite noticeable flicker compared to other CAM/TS out in the last 6 months, eg Transformers, X-Men, Pirates of the Caribbean, or Thor. This was present in the Russian source CAM so nothing to be done until a new source becomes available. Otherwise picture quality is average to good compared the the above. The audio is good Line, but off sync for a few minutes around 48min. Don't know about the cuts [haven't seen it in theaters]. Overall decent. 
Thank You .Bone. for the upload - HUGE demand for this one."
,ThaiDennis,2011-07-16T06:10Z,On the run time: Cams and TS' are normally always shorter because they don't show the end credits. This is because the audience will stand up as soon as the credits start. A movie like this has a lot of credits.
,abmot,2011-07-30T20:35Z,i m waitng to watch the muveee..
