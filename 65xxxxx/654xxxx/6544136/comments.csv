Couldnt find what's wrong with the game itself....

So far its far better than any crappy self-claimed GOTY JRPGs i played.. better action, better voice acting, better and original upgrade system, great, great soundtrack.. "
,Ellipsis5,2012-01-29T02:10Z,"This game is one of the best I've ever played, as a critic described it ""a gem among rpg games"".

The only complaints I actually have about the game are:
- While travelling from place to place, it can get pretty boring. It annoyed me a lot.
^This gets less annoying later in the game when you get to use boats to travel, but by that time you:

- Don't get many new spots and the biggest reason to travel are side quests(which I liked, because depending on what you choose to do, you get different rewards).

- Also the weapon selections was something I didn't like much. Like, I think they really added that, because from there on, the game just gets boring and the biggest part to play are the side quests or you could collect stuff for the weapons, but some items are rare to find and you already killed the monsters wielding them, making it frustrating to think you just needed one small thing for something irrelevant as a weapon upgrade. 

BUT

- The storyline alone is good enough to ignore those parts. 
- The game has very creative/artsy parts(like, there's a part where you enter a forest and instead of voices, you start to get text and slowly the screen fades to black leaving nothing but pure poetry).
- The surroundings are limited, but beautiful and creative, like a city that basically is a reverse pyramid carved into the ground. 
- You get to ride a boar :D
- It contains a huge mystery. Like:
  - At the forest I mentioned before, the guy says ""I remember you from somewhere"", but the game doesn't explain from where.
  - The game plays in a fantasy medieval/historical world, yet gives leads to a modern world.
  - A secret lab in a historical-looking mansion containing a highly advanced military science lab?

So yeah, great game, buy it if you want to take a break from your standard action games and want to play trough/hear/read/see an epic story."

That being a floating book shouting, ""Speak the truth, hussy!"" and then being told to shut up by the other characters. I recommend it to everyone. It's probably on youtube somewhere. I recorded it on my phone. Can I upload a voice recording with no video? "
