Forest were a late 60â€™s minstrel/medieval type of folk-prog trio in the style of The Incredible String Band, Fairport Convention and Dr. Strangely Strange. They released a couple of albums with dark but subtle acid lyrics, incorporating pipes, harmonium, harpsichord, mandolin, 12-string guitar and percussion to their sound. Their music doesnâ€™t have the electricity normally associated with rock, yet it canâ€™t be described as straight folk either, the lyrics being rather strange and the bandâ€™s approach being far too eclectic â€“ thus their inclusion here.

Full Circle has both brutal and beautiful elements, and the raw acoustic tunes create weird and very enchanting music. There are much medieval influences here, but the overall aesthetics are not luckily very idealized or fantasy related, but sincere and realistic, filled with mystery, misery and violence.
