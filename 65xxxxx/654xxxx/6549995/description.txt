O.A.R.
Of A Revolution
Risen (2001)





O.A.R. (an acronym for the band's full moniker, Of a Revolution) transformed themselves from local Ohio State University bandmates to Billboard chartbusters over the course of a long, varied career. First, two of the band's demo recordings were hawked on university campuses. Then, news spread about the band's roots rock and reggae-inflected songs, which owed much to the jam band genre. Before long, O.A.R.'s website had turned into a highly-trafficked internet destination, and the group gradually left the college scene for the bright lights of national stardom.
