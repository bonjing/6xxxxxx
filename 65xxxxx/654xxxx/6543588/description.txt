Formed from the ashes of now defunct melodic death-metal band Light This City, Heartsounds consists of founding members Laura Nichol (guitars/vocals) and Ben Murray (guitars/vocals) who after growing tired of banging heads decided to return to their true love...punk rock.

Until We Surrender is a heart-pounding throwback to 90â€™s punk era, focused on the faster and more technical aspects of its style with elements of pop-punk and indie sensibilities all mixed in together. Murray and Nicholâ€™s back and forth vocals complement each other immensely, while their warm rhythmic riffs intertwine for a fresh take on the classic punk sound. Murray putâ€™s it best in his lyric â€œIâ€™ve found my true calling, and itâ€™s never sounded so fucking good.â€ - Epitaph Records
