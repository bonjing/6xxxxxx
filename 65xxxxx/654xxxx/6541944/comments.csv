,batguan0,2011-07-15T22:31Z,"Speaking of americans in Paris, any chance youd fancy doing 'The Dreamers' (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309987/)? Was released on blu-ray a couple of weeks ago and as far as i know there are no rips smaller than 6GB available yet.

Either way, thanks for another great upload. :)"

,batguan0,2011-07-18T02:37Z,"You must have seen some rated version of it. :P Not humanly possible to dislike a fully frontal Eva Green. ;)

Have also been hoping to find smaller rips of 'Belle de Jour' and 'Man on the Moon'. Feel free to consider ripping them if they're more in your taste. :)"
