Sublime With Rome
Yours Truly (2011)




After their lead singer/guitarist Bradley Nowell's death brought an end to the group Sublime, surviving members Eric Wilson (bass) and Bud Gaugh (drums) formed the Long Beach Dub All-Stars before returning to the Sublime catalog in 2009 with the group Sublime with Rome. The â€œRomeâ€ is Rome Ramirez, a singer/guitarist the band first played some gigs with in 2009 as Sublime. They became Sublime with Rome a year later for a cross-country tour of America. In 2011, Fueled By Raman released the group's first album, Yours Truly.
