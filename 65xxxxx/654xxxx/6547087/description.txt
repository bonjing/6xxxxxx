    Oliver is in trouble. He's been caught embezzling money from his         
    father's company, and unless he can pay back the $250,000 he took        
    (which he can't), he will be fired from his job, arrested and            
    probably sent to jail. Meanwhile, his rich wife has not only refused     
    to bail him out of this mess, she's planning to divorce him.             
    Desperate, Oliver thinks up a way out. He takes out an insurance         
    policy on his wife with him as the beneficiary, then hires a hit man     
    to kill her. The only problem is that because the doctor who             
    performed the examination is an incompetent fraud, the insurance         
    policy is invalid. Desperate to call off the hit, Oliver tracks down     
    the hit man, only to find that he's subcontracted the killing to         
    another hit man. Tracking down that killer reveals that he, too, has     
    hired it out to a third person, and so on, and so on. Just how many      
    people are trying to kill Oliver's wife?
