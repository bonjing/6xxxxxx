,El-solo,2011-07-16T16:49Z,all you gotta do is read the description 
,theghostofelkins,2011-07-16T19:57Z,John12321 get off...you have posted the same thing on numerous Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Movies. Quit spamming 
,lord.thom,2011-07-16T20:41Z,"Decent quality, but the sound and audio get a little out of sync at times -- easily fixable with a bit of audio delay though.

Also, there are occasional subtitles (such as when voldemort is speaking in parseltongue) written in Russian!

Definitely watchable though. Good upload."
,beckaboo7,2011-07-16T23:31Z,Yea...too bad this doesn't work.
,lord.thom,2011-07-17T02:53Z,"It does work?!

I bet you're just using windows media player and haven't downloaded any codecs, right?

Either download the right codec to play this file type, or (better still) download VLC media player and never use that Microsoft rubbish again!"

,blakieee,2011-08-03T00:31Z,the video won't play on my divx player what should I do? it starts after a while but all I hear is the background and I don't see an image.
,mckilla26,2011-08-13T13:27Z,use kmplayer even better than vlc in my opinion :)
,OttifantSir2,2011-08-14T14:17Z,"mckilla: Could be that kmplayer is better than VLC for you. Doesn't have the same following, and it's a bit harder to find on Windows- and Mac-machines than Linux-machines. But for anyone wondering: MPlayer is probably just as good as VLC, it's just that VLC is better known, and IMO has a better interface"
