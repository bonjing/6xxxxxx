The critical reading section on standardized tests, especially the SAT 1 exam, is often cited as a trouble section for even the best test-takers. Examinees get test-targeted reading comprehension practice questions to score better with LearningExpress' series, Skill Builder in Focus. This specialized drill book provides the focused practice necessary for test-taking success. Plus, all answers are explained, using terms that clarify context, main ideas, themes, and critical thinking skills for effective studying and positive reinforcement. Almost every standardized test in verbal skills, including civil service exams, contains reading comprehension questions. Each practice consists of several passages followed by questions and answer explanations.
