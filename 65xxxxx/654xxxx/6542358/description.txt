The big four of thrash metal together in one festival. The Big Four, as it is called, consists of Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax. It was a long soap opera of which I speak for a long time, but last year finally began to festivals around the world with Metallica headlining and within the tour to promote his latest album, World Magnetic Tour
