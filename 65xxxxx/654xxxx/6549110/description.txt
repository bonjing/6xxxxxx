Jose Montserrate Feliciano GarcÃ­a (born September 10, 1945) is a Puerto Rican singer,
virtuoso guitarist and composer, known for many international hits including the 1970 holiday
single "Feliz Navidad".

In 1963, after some live performances in pubs and clubs around the USA and Canada,
especially in Greenwich Village in New York City, and Vancouver, BC, where he played at the
same time as Bob Dylan and Joan Baez, he was signed at RCA Victor. In 1964, he released
his first single "Everybody Do the Click" (which become a hit in Philippines, at nr2 and stayed
for 14 weeks in TopTen Hit parade) Later, in 1965 and 1966, he also released his first albums
The Voice and Guitar of Jose Feliciano and A Bag Full of Soul, two folk-pop-soul albums that
showcased his talent on radio across the USA, where he was described as a "10 finger
wizard". He also was invited to the Newport Jazz festival in 1964.

In 1966, he went to Mar del Plata, Argentina, to perform at the Festival de Mar del Plata.
There, he impressed RCA Victor officials who told him to stay there to record an album in
Spanish. They were not sure what they wanted to record, but Feliciano suggested they record
bolero music. The result was two smash hits with the singles "Poquita Fe" ("Little Faith",
a.k.a. "Sin Fe", or "Without Faith") a song written by fellow Puerto Rican Bobby CapÃ³, and
"Usted" (the formal way to say "you" in Spanish)

A year later, Feliciano was due to perform in the United Kingdom, but the authorities would
not allow his guide dog into the country unless it was in quarantine for six months. The
stringent quarantine measures of those days were intended to prevent the spread of rabies.
Feliciano later wrote a song entitled "No Dogs Allowed", which told the story of his first visit to
London.
