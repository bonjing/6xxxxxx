    At a Catholic public school, Benjamin Stanfield is tired of being the    
    teacher's pet and decides to play a practical joke on his form master    
    Father Goddard. In confession, Stanfield tells Goddard that he has       
    accidentally murdered his friend Blakey and buried him in the forest.    
    When Goddard investigates the matter, he finds a buried scarecrow.       
    Goddard is outraged, but, due to the seal of confession, he knows he     
    cannot expel Stanfield. Shortly after, Stanfield once again enters       
    the confession booth, telling Goddard that what before was a             
    practical joke, he has now made happen. In disbelief, Goddard once       
    again goes to the forest to investigate the matter. This time, he        
    discovers Blakey's dead body. The plot soon thickens as Stanfield's      
    fellow student Arthur Dyson mysteriously disappears...
