,udnes,2011-07-17T20:31Z,I know. I have some problems with drleting and seeding torrents. Sorry :(
,Wulf579,2011-07-18T06:07Z,"Doesn't do any good whatsoever to have the software if you have to not let it update. OVER HALF of the tools provided will NOT work because you have to block them from being able to update themselves. Need a better way (Key Generator, etc.) that will register the software without having to block its Internet access before it will be of any use. "

This torrent is without a seeder! I apologize for this. I’ve had some trouble with my accounts. I’m going to fix it and post real torrents with seeders! Once again, srry. – Udnes.
