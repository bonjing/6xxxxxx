AC / DC - Let There Be Rock (Limited Collectors Edition) (2011)


The only movie powered by AC/DC. This legendary concert film, covering a 1979 Paris concert during the Australian heavy metal band's "Highway To Hell" tour showcases the power and precision that the quintet bring to vicious rockers like "Whole Lotta Rosie" and "Let There Be Rock."
Pixieish lead guitarist Angus Young, attired in his trademark school-boy's uniform, takes center stage with his energetic antics and frenetic solos, while the rest of the band crank out their minimalist boogie with quiet determination.
Especially AC/DC's flamboyant lead singer Bon Scott, who died two months after this filmed concert.

All songs composed by Angus Young, Malcolm Young and Bon Scott.
