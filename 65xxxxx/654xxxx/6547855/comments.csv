,zigs6,2011-07-31T00:02Z,"Please seed again.... Im on day 3 and i've been stuck at 62% for two of them. Great quality, thank you."
,DarthPS3,2011-07-31T23:07Z,"I usually never stop seeding my torrents, however I recently got a new desktop and lost the torrent for this one in the process. I do apologize, because that means I will have to create a new torrent.
 My advice would be to salvage what you can from what you have been downloaded before. In about 3-4 days I will upload the new torrent. 
 I would also erase this one at that time, but the delete tool on piratebay has not been operating for some time now. 
 Again, apologies to those that this frustrates. "
,DarthPS3,2011-07-31T23:09Z,"Although I will say that my new desktop is a good thing for all of us, as it gives me a single stable location to work out of rather than the three laptop juggling act that it was before. 
Goddamn I love my PS3. "
,HatRacks,2011-08-01T15:49Z,Thanks for the heads up :)
,DarthPS3,2011-08-09T04:48Z,I'll be re-seeding this just as soon as Lost Season 1 finishes uploading. 
,DarthPS3,2011-08-12T07:04Z,"Reseed of this torrent.
