Fallen Angels [1995]
Directed by Wong Kar-Wai

This is a re-encode.  The source audio was originally a DTS 5.1 channel Track.  It has been mixed down to 2.0 stereo with Handbrake.  Not sure how well that worked.  The resolution of the source file was 1280x704.  I cropped both sides equally.  The resolution is now 1252x704.  It is a 16:9 aspect ratio.
