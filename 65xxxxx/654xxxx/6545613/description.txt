Tree Crops: A Permanent Agriculture by J. Russell Smith is the classic work on tree crops. First published in 1929, this highly readable blueprint for the development of high-yield tree crops proves that vast, untapped food sources can be harvested from common species of North American trees.

Smith's philosophy is based on the idea that agriculture must be "adapted to physical conditions," that "farming should fit the land." He observed worldwide the catastrophe of hill agriculture whose one-time cycle he described so accurately as "forest -- field -- plow -- desert."

Wendell Berry, one of our most important ecological voices, has written a compelling introduction on the need for utilizing these still-revolutionary ideas, for Smith's plans were never adopted to the degree he wished. And the potential for erosion control, increasing human and animal food supply, and diversifying our ecosystem remains as great a challenge as it was when Tree Crops was first published more than fifty years ago.

-- "Tree Crops made so much sense to me that I have never been the same since... As my work took me all over the world, everywhere I could see it, thanks to Russell Smith: Agriculture in mountainous, rocky, or dry regions is a disaster, but trees are salvation." -- E. F. Schumacher

-- "Here is one of the most important books of our time. It relates ecology, national economics and human welfare in a way that is fascinating for anyone interested in the basic problems of the nations ... Also, a very practical and profitable investment." -- Louis Bromfield
