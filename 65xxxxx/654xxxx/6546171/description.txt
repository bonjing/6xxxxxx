Air Canada brings you the 1st program on the B777-300ER and also a rare opportunity to go along on a roundtrip over the Pacific Ocean as we fly nonstop from Toronto to Tokyo Narita Airport and back.
Our crew goes through all the flight preparations, briefings, checklists and take their time presenting the 777-300 cockpit in detail. They also go over how Trans Pacific routes operate, where suitable diversion airports are located, the flight bag that Air Canada equips its 777 with, the Date Line and much more. As a bonus the program continues with a Trans Atlantic flight from Toronto to Frankfurt.
