,domidomidomidom,2011-09-09T23:36Z,Need help for installing it. I don't get it...
,digimike50,2011-09-27T13:10Z,Many thanks works perfectly for me. (W7 Ult 64)
,MisterBigg,2011-10-05T11:10Z,"Works great, installed as expected.  Key worked.  It asked me to update when I first installed and I said ""no"" just in case.

For recording video from the screen, it needs to install an addon, this works just fine.

Hulu recording worked great!

Norton 360 (2011) scanned clean.

THANKS A TON!"

I don't know if they are tracking in any way but it concerns me."

,JamsBand,2012-05-10T04:57Z,"Toxin07 you sound a bit clueless talking about invasion of privacy. If you knew anything about the current laws around the world there is NO more privacy and in the interest of nailing pirates companies take the law to the limit and scared judges do take heed to things like for ex. where I live the US Constitution. Btw Im a defense attorney and I see people everyday that find out the hard way they dont have the rights they think they do.
People around the world stand up for your rights."
