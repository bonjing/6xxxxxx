From Wiki:


Black Francis (born Charles Michael Kittridge Thompson IV on April 6, 1965) is an American singer, songwriter and guitarist.[1] He is best known as the frontman of the influential alternative rock band Pixies, with whom he performs under the stage name Black Francis.[3] Following the band's breakup in 1993, he embarked on a solo career under the name Frank Black. After releasing two albums with 4AD, he left the label and formed a backing band, Frank Black and the Catholics. He reformed the Pixies in 2004 and continues to release solo records and tour as a solo artist,[4] having re-adopted his current stage name in 2007.

His vocal style has varied from a screaming, yowling delivery as lead vocalist of the Pixies to a more measured and melodical style in his solo career.[5] His cryptic lyrics mostly explore unconventional subjects, such as surrealism, incest and Biblical violence, along with science fiction and surf culture.[6] His use of atypical meter signatures, loud-quiet dynamics and distinct preference for live-to-two-track recording in his career as a solo artist give him a distinct style within alternative rock.[7]

As frontman of the Pixies, his songs (such as "Where Is My Mind?" and "Debaser") received praise and citations from contemporaries, including Radiohead's Thom Yorke and Nirvana's Kurt Cobain. Cobain once said that "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was his attempt at trying to "rip off the Pixies".[8] However, in his solo work and records with the Catholics, he received fewer popular and critical accolades. 




Frank Black 1993

Frank Black is the first solo album from the American alternative rock musician Frank Black. The album was recorded in 1992 and released on 9 March 1993 via 4AD, after the breakup of the Pixies. The album was similar in style, both musically and lyrically, to the Pixies' last album Trompe le Monde. Frank Black was characterized by a focus on UFOs and science fiction, although he explored other eclectic subjects, such as in "I Heard Ramona Sing", a song about the Ramones, which also appears on the Scott Pilgrim vs. the World Soundtrack. Two singles from the album - "Los Angeles" and "Hang on to Your Ego" - were released in 1993. "Los Angeles" is featured on the game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland

Teenager Of The Year 1994

Released in 1994, Teenager of the Year was Frank Blackâ€™s second solo album, produced by Eric Drew Feldman.

Frank Black & The Catholics 1998

Frank Black and the Catholics was the eponymous debut album from Frank Black and the Catholics. The backing group on this album performed on Black's previous album, The Cult of Ray, but the group name was first adopted on this release. The album was recorded live to two-track tape over the course of two days in 1997, but a protracted dispute with Black's label American Recordings [1], reportedly over the "raw" sound of the recordings [2], delayed its release for 18 months. The album was released in June 1998 in the MP3 format on GoodNoise.com (precursor to eMusic) and was the first album by a major artist to be commercially released on the Internet. The album was then released in the fall of 1998 by SpinART records in the US. During the interim, Lyle Workman left the group and was replaced by Rich Gilbert, and Black prepared the follow-up, "Pistolero". The track listing is notable for having been sequenced in alphabetical order.

Dog In The Sand 2001


Dog in the Sand, Frank Black's third album with backing group the Catholics was released by the Cooking Vinyl record label in 2001, and was produced by Nick Vincent. The album was generally met with favorable reviews.

The album was initially released by the What Are Records? label in 2001, and was reissued by SpinART in 2003.

His first original solo work since 1996's The Cult of Ray, Honeycomb was recorded in Nashville, and features notable local session musicians, such as Steve Cropper and ex-Presley guitarist Reggie Young. Frank Black had discussed making a Black on Blonde record for about ten years with producer Jon Tiven, where he would travel to Nashville (like Dylan with Blonde on Blonde) and record with local musicians. In 2005, Black eventually found the time to record such an album. He went to Nashville and met with musicians whom Tiven had selected for the record.

Bluefinger 2007

Bluefinger is an album by Black Francis[11] (aka Frank Black). The album was released on 11 September 2007 in the United States and Europe. The project was revealed via several cryptic posts by Black on his unofficial website,[12], which were confirmed as accurate when the album leaked to file-sharing services earlier in the year. All of the songs on the album reference Dutch musician and artist Herman Brood, some directly and some indirectly. In addition, "You Can't Break a Heart and Have It" is a Brood cover. The title of the album, Bluefinger, is also a direct reference to the birthplace of Brood, who was born in the Dutch city of Zwolle, of which the citizens are colloquially known as Blauwvingers (Bluefingers). The song "Threshold Apprehension" was #90 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007.[13]

"You Can't Break a Heart and Have It" was included in the soundtrack for Forgetting Sarah Marshall.

In 2010, Bluefinger was adapted into a play/rock opera, in collaboration with Jason Nodler, for Houston's acclaimed Catastrophic Theatre

The Golem 2010 (Rock Songs Version)


The Golem is a soundtrack written and performed by Black Francis at the 2008 San Francisco International Film Festival for the 1920 film The Golem: How He Came into the World. The soundtrack was released in 2010 as a 5-disc set. Only 500 copies were made, and was released exclusively for purchase from Blackfrancis.net. The set included 2 CDs containing the studio recordings, 2 CDs containing the original 2008 live performance at San Francisco International Film Festival, a DVD of The Golem: How He Came into the World with the soundtrack synced to the film, and a book containing chord charts by Nick Vicent and lyrics by Black Francis for The Golem. Each of the 500 copies were signed by Black Francis, and each were wrapped in brown paper and sealed with a "Black Francis" marked wax stamp. A "rock songs" version, according to Francis, is in the works for a more commercial release. However, this version is said to contain only the substantial songs, leaving out the reprises and themes that were included with the disc set. No additional information has been given about the release date for this version.
