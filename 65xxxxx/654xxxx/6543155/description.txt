This is Book 1 in the Kane Chronicles by bestselling author Rick Riordan (who also wrote the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series), titled The Red Pyramid. The folder contains the book in several different formats: ePub, lit, lrf, mobi, pdb, pdf, rtf, and plain txt. I assume they are all identical as far as content goes but haven't checked.

I couldn't find this book anywhere here on TPB, so I did a quick internet search and found this whole thing on ebook3000.com. I haven't checked any of them for errors or spelling or anything else, but a quick glance shows that they look fine. I'm only going to be using the pdf one, so when I finish it I'll post a comment with my findings for that one. If you'll be using one of the other formats and want to post any comments about it, that'd be great. 

Enjoy another ebook upload from me, I hope you enjoy it! :)
