,fasurvivor,2011-07-18T03:48Z,"thanks for this

would you please tell me the resolution of transformers 2007 which you have prepared for up. Is it either 1920x1080 or 1920x800

please reply"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-07-18T13:16Z,"All 3 movies were shot in 2:40 AR so 1920 x 800, because we don't want the black bars which take about 15% in size.

If your you ask weather my Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen Blu-ray is IMAX Edition, no, it isn't.

If you look at bluray.com (link below) you see that only partially is full screen (16/9 AR), and those full screen scenes have about 15% cropped from the sides. I don't think is so cool to see a movie with AR changing (between 2:40 & 16/9), I prefer one AR through the whole film.

My trilogy will have Eng & Fra, Ger, Hun, Ita, Rus, Spa audios (demuxed) with multisubs and obviously 1920 x 800 (with black bars removed).

I converted one of your 1080p to 720p using your recommended setting with handbrake but media info of both files were different, don`t know why?
see for yourself and get me a suggestion

[T],FatFreddy69,2011-07-19T17:12Z,"@fasurvivor
good job, lol tesa 64 ;-), it took forever.
 Is it about 45 % smaller in size then the source? It looks good, doesn't it? How long did it take? What processor you got?
Media info doesn't show always the right infos, try a different version too, also try with MPC/proprieties/media info, see what shows there. 
Look at a dark scene (on big screen) if it's darker then the source (which I doubt), if it is make it at 3000KB/s.
I don't understand why it shows in yours bitrate=10000. B-frames you can make it 7, it might be slightly better. I never made BRRip 1080 to 720p, maybe it shows a bit different infos then when a BD to 1080p BDRip. I don't know. Don't paste in the future the whole alot, just the enc setingst.  cheers fasurvivor"
,fasurvivor,2011-07-20T07:36Z,"thanks for your reply

2.93C2D/4GB DDR2/59 min/2D 4H
the result is as same as the source I think which is fantastic(best 720p I have ever seen)
but the problem is High@L4.0
why mine is L3.2
can you set it to L4.0(is there any option in handbrake) and which version of handbrake do you use?"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-07-20T10:25Z,"That's just a profile name, it shouldn't bother you. One can have a High 4.1 profile with horrible low settings and result. I don't know where or how you can set it but  Encoding Settings matter only.. I use 2 versions, the newest 0.9.5 and svn3154 (20100307) which is my favorite. faster under the same settings.
I run two rips at one time ( 16 GB ram, 4 x 2GHz). When install the second program name the install-folder (in C:) Handbrake2. cheers"
