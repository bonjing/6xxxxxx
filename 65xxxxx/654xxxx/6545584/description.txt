Aravind Adigaâ€™s first novel since his Man Booker Prizeâ€“winning best seller The White Tiger (â€œAmazing . . . One of the most powerful books Iâ€™ve read in decadesâ€ â€”Deirdre Donahue, USA Today): a stunning, darkly comic story of greed and murder that lays bare the teeming metropolis of Mumbai.

Real estate developer Dharmen Shahâ€™s offer to buy out the residents of Vishram Societyâ€”a formerly respectable, now crumbling apartment complex that abuts the infamous Dharavi slumsâ€”is more than generous. But one man stands in the way of Shahâ€™s luxury high- rise: Masterji, a retired schoolteacher who will not leave his home in Vishramâ€™s Tower A. Shah is a dangerous man to refuse, but as the demolition deadline looms, Masterjiâ€™s neighborsâ€”friends who have become enemies, acquaintances turned co- conspiratorsâ€”may stop at nothing to score their payday.

An electrifying, suspense-filled story of money and power, luxury and deprivation, peopled by brilliantly drawn, unforgettable characters, Last Man in Tower exposes the hearts and minds of the everymen and women of a great, booming cityâ€”ordinary people pushed to their limits in a place that knows none.
