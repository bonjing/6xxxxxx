,vaikou15,2011-07-18T00:35Z,Why bother uploading when the quality is this bad. I don't see how people can watch a movie is this format =P
,saequa253,2011-07-18T09:17Z,fake?
,nYxx07,2011-07-19T00:23Z,"Honestly if you guys don´t know how to look a movie you shouldn´t download shit.
Because it´s NO fake it works totally fine with VLC and it´s the full movie.

So before you cry ""fake"" better know what you do ;P."

DespuÃ©s de dejar a millones de fans de la saga transformers 3 sin ver la pelÃ­cula, ahora tambiÃ©n se suman mÃ¡s pelÃ­culas, pero el mayor desastre ha llegado cuando la productora ha emitido un comunicado en donde deja claro que ya no emitirÃ¡ sus pelÃ­culas en el paÃ­s revolucionario."
