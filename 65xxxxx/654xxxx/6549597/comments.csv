------------------------------------

Important changes for packagers:
 * The default builds now assume that the operating system uses UTF-8 for
   its file systems and files content (except the Windows port). If this is
   not acceptable, pass --enable-non-utf8 to the configure script.

   variable. The --plugin-path command line option was removed.

   configure script if you use OSSv4 or really want to use OSS emulation.
