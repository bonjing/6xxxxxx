another fresh new build of vlc player 1.2.0-git Twoflower from today : july 18
reset all preference from your setting option as well as you cache folder before installing any new version ! 
uncheck : check new update at the end of your installation as this one no longer
works for this kind of version anyway.
I will up a new build in 7 days.
this will permit you to give a try and test between several build to come.
slow peers : stop to use this bullshit of utorrent v 3 and use instead utorrent 1.8.5 that should give you real better results.(1.8.1 and 1.8.2 are ok also)
Japanese peers must absolutely follow this tips or use only bitTorrent v 6 or 6.1 or 6.2 who should run better for you in such case.
any feedback will still be welcome,indeed !

Enjoy
regards
