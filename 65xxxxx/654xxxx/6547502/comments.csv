,RobTortureWright,2011-08-27T14:27Z,"Watched a few episodes on tv and really didnt like it, i think they should have left it after 5 amazing seasons but anyway GREAT quality and small file size is perfect for me."
,Ham933,2011-08-28T09:38Z,"I can't thank you enough for this one, I've been holding off because almost 8 GB is too much for a season of a TV show imo."

,metalheadben,2011-10-17T17:03Z,Why is it not working? Windows Media Player says 'Windows Media Player encountered a problem while playing the file.' And VLC Player won't play it either.
,DickDickstein,2011-10-28T20:56Z,"Hey guys...Episode one is corrupted. All the others are fine. Just skip Episode 1 and download this one from EZTV. It's 350 MB, but it's the fastest one I found:
