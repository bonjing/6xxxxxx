,Mercyflush64,2011-07-15T02:18Z,"Thanks a ton for all of these. I know the hard work that went in to all of these packages. To answer some of your remarks, I don't think kids collect comics like they did 20 years ago when they were hot items. I stopped back then and can't believe the prices today. I was on hold at several comic for an average of 40 titles a month with some ""speculations"" so I would order 5 of those. I would be spending several hundred dollars per month now. It just isn't worth it to have those physical copies that I miss holding in my hands. 

With all of the scanners and uploaders hard work I do get to share a lot of my past enjoyment with my 5 yr. old son as I read stories to him and he can see the artwork that often gets hidden from the public in this medium. 

You may be crazy, but I thank the insanity."

I might keep it just to force child support on the guy in prison; insult to injury and all that.  Can't be anything much worse than being forced to take it in the ass while pressing license plates to support a kid you accidentally made and got jailed over.  I might do that.  Probably not though.  I enjoyed your rant."
