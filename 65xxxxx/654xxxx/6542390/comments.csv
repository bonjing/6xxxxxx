first cut i noticed was arround the 2 min mark when the goblin should reply something like ""i'm alive""
but it just skips that. god knows what else been cut.
since ive seen the film i just wanted to warn ppl.

with all those cuts this movie is not complete. 

probably why it's 1h 58 min aswell, and not 2h 10 min."

It is watchable, a little dark in the dark scenes, but its still considered watchable. Audio is good for camera."

No scenes are missing but quite a few random frames and shots are missing, totalling about 3 minutes of footage. Tannerman is such a total dickhead he couldn't even work this out. 

PLUS this file is better to watch than Warner Bros last minute 3D attempt to make even more money.

Great Movie! It is a Cam for those who are still asking and dont read many comments! But for it being a cam, it is very watchable... There is 3 maybe 4 parts that seem to skip, but it seems all the movie is indeed there. 

About half way through, the Audio seems to jump ahead when one of these skips seems to happen, it roughly lasts for 15 mins, but its not to much of a bother, maybe a second off, then it fixes itself. 

Overall a good copy, very watchable and a overall amazing ending to the franchise! "

What would really be valuable is if they note things such as sync issues or that its overly dark in some parts, that sorta comment is helpful. Rating audio and video is kinda pointless."
,harvengure,2011-08-30T03:44Z,"@Bantha-Poodoo: Firstly please do not post a comment if you're not going to post something constructive.  We see too much of that here as it is.  Secondly, please go look up what a TS or telesync is as I get the impression you do not actually know.

As for everyone else, please disregard the above comment.  Given the number of comments and peers that this is a fairly safe bet to be the actual film.  As for quality, I'll take a look and come back and let you all know."
,harvengure,2011-08-30T04:34Z,"For a TS this is not that bad.  The quality is what one should expect, comparable to though slightly less then VHS quality.

There is a visible scanning effect through the film caused by refresh rate differences in the cam and the screen itself.

Visible visual noise and video artifacts throughout but for the most part it does not make the file any less watchable.  Though on a couple of very short scenes this give it a sort of 'painted' look like a water colour.

There is also something of a spottiness to the video where its a bit blurrier then the rest of the screen but with the visual noise and artifacts its hardly noticeable.

The subtitles for the scenes where someone is speaking Parseltongue appear to be Russian.

The audio is actually quite good and in sync.

For a TS this is a good file overall I think and has garnered needless complaints from people who simply like to complain though I do suggest a slight increase to gamma and slight decrease to contrast.

Overall rating compared to DVD: A/9 V/6
Watchable if you can not wait for DVD quality."

Watchable with a few very minor (you may not even notice some of them) problems - color and contrast are both a bit off (too bright in some places, too dark in others), video is *very* slightly zoomed in so a bit of the screen is cropped.  The first few minutes of capture are a bit shaky but the rest of the movie is fine. There are a few parts where the audio and video aren't synced (no more than 5-10 seconds at a time, and not more than four times that I noticed), and the subtitles for one scene (Voldemort talking to Nagini) are in Russian.  I'm being extremely critical here, though;  audio is excellent and this is overall a decent capture.  Video isn't perfect but definitely watchable.  One of the better cams I've seen.  

This torrent is worth downloading."
