Slipknot Live at Sonisphere UK Knebworth Park. This has been ripped from youtube and the 7parts edited together and then converted to mkv. The resolution is 720 but has lost a bit of a quality but is still very watchable. This was a gig that you had to be there to believe. And if you missed it you will love this as it will give you a glimps of one of the great gigs slipknot have every preformed live
