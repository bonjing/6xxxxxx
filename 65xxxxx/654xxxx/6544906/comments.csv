But thanks a lot.
Probably the best one around the size (3-4GB)"

It's watchable, if you just want to catch up. Not at all acceptable if you're looking to burn. If you can handle 5 Video or are running low on storage space...I recommend it. I didn't want to trash 24 G's on something I was going to watch and delete, so I gave it a shot. 

It's doable. Clean and complete. No major problems. Everyone should have VLC anyway. So...yeah. Your choice.

Thanks for the upload Zoids. You've provided me with 20 hours of mindless entertainment during what's turning out to be a really terrible month for me. I appreciate it, man. Rock out with your cock out."
