Driver Genius, provided by Driver-Soft Inc., is PC driver update software that can perform complete driver scans, and it also provides instant updates. This driver updater software has a feature called LiveUpdate, which is a functionality offered by few providers. This service can synchronize your computer with real-time driver updates.

When we ran our test scans Driver Genius found the missing and outdated drivers we were looking to find. It also discovered that we had one driver that was not valid for our Windows 7 32-bit operating system. This driver software offers over 30,000 OEM (original equipment manufacturer) and WHQL (Windows Hardware Quality Labs) drivers.

However, we did run into a few issues. First, they did not answer two of our email queries. Secondly, though they provide email addresses, they do not provide any other kind of contact information or company location information on their website. When we did a URL lookup we found that the site registrants are located in China. That by itself is not an issue; many great software companies are located across the planet. But we would like to see them publish phone numbers and company information so that potential customers will feel more comfortable purchasing with them. We looked into company information since their interface is similar to another driver update application to attempt to discover the original creators of the software. From what we can tell, Driver Genius utilizes software similar to another, but draws on a different database and offers their own support options
