    Three bumbling criminals have been trying to get their hands on the      
    computerized control system of Mr. Twister, a talking monster truck      
    with a mind of its own. Our three hilarious hoodlums have tried one      
    scheme after another, only to be foiled and embarrassed by Mr.           
    Twister. Our trio decides to take one last shot at the truck, this
