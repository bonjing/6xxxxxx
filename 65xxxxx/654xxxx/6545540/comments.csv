i wanted to play battle for middle earth 2 online but gamespy didnt support any longer so i was pissed off, but than i saw a comment about gameranger and i went to test it.

Now i can go online without any difficulties, all i have to do is close FIREFOX, open port 16000 (port forward) and make sure my firewall allows the connection.

it's awsome and very stable :)
So try it out."
