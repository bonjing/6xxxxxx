,stathistrex,2011-07-15T18:30Z,The quality of video is bullshit.
,harrybish,2011-07-16T14:23Z,"this took 20 mins to download, i'd say quality is about 7/10, a little dark and grainy but perfectly watchable. its fine, stop whinging."
,harrybish,2011-07-16T14:29Z,"on the other hand, completely unwatchable on usb dvd players / ps3 / xbox. i've only got this to work on VLC player on my computer."
,Trickee,2011-07-17T18:00Z,"The international version is not 1h7m anyway, unless there is more than one international version."
