Made a script to resize and sharpen.........
Adjusted the rgb as the colors seemed off 
and made a bit darker as it 
brought the color out better
Audio is from the NeDivx release ""

If it's a DVDRip, why fuck with it?"
,geoffp,2011-07-18T08:13Z,Is this a DVDRip? Lots of video information and comments about it being corrected usually means a crappy camera job
