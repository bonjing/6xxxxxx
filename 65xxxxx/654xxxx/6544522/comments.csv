,scottsasse,2011-07-19T05:58Z,"@ PunkPoetryCorner, I had NO problems with sync, however I was looking forward to this movie but was real disappointed:(:(:( It had it's moments but they were far and few in between!! To top it off the lead character's acting was bad and he seemed at times to be reading his lines way to fast for a drama(maybe that's what you thought were sync problems??) ............................................................................................................................................Anyway, the A=6, V=9, M=4 [WTF was Ben Stiller thinking]??  "

,jozsefas,2011-08-19T11:55Z,"As others have said, it was out of sync a bit towards the end. I also experienced some choppiness at the beginning although maybe that's a problem on my end since no one else mentioned it. Thank you for the upload! I enjoyed the flick."
,cinto,2011-09-04T23:57Z,unbearably out of synch towards the end.
