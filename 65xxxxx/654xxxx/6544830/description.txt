    Five doctors go on vacation deep in the Canadian wilderness. After       
    all but one pair of the party's shoes disappear, the remaining shoed     
    camper decides to hike out and go look for help. Soon after he           
    leaves, however, his four companions realizes that something is very     
    wrong when someone leaves a decapitated deer head just outside their     
    camp. Even though they still don't have their shoes, they decide to      
    follow their friend's trail out of the woods, but their path is          
    blocked by someone who doesn't want to see them leave the forest         
    alive.
