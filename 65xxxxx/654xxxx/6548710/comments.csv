,Elaine1951,2012-02-12T09:16Z,"I can watch your movies once I download them to my laptop, but when I copy them via DivX to a Dvd and then try to watch them on my dvd player, I get the message 'Video codec not supported' Can you help me, as I have no idea which Video Codec I need to download. Thanks for the movies. They are clear and have good sound!
Regards. Elaine "
,dvdriprocketmail,2012-03-21T12:02Z,"@Elaine1951 Download ""DivX Plus Converter"" or ""DivX Author"" if you want to convert .mp4 videos to .divx file that should play on your DVD player.  That's what I use to convert videos to play on my Philips DVD Player.  Search YouTube if you want them for free."
