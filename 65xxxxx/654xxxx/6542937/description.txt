Ok what is?

Halo Demo is kinda cool to kill the time and save the headache and hassles of actually finding someone online to play with. This is a modded map replacement for the Blood Gulch map.

What is changed?

Everything. Guns shoot differently and are more high powered. Sniper rifles have rapid fire. Rockets if you sight the person, they heat seek. Warthogs can be driven from the gunner seat and also shoot at the same times. Cliffs are available. Shees no longer have any sort of advantage so the shee noobs can go to hell. The little purple bikes (don't laugh i make games not play them) are in there as well so theres an unavailable new vehicle to play with now. There are portals EVERYWHERE and are the key to this map. Basically changes it to more of a Quake 3 Arena feel where its more chaotic, body parts flying everywhere, and no one has a distinct advantage. 1/2 the people who join leave due to intimidation, most will bug you relentless for a copy of it.

How do I install it?
Wherever you installed your copy of halo to, theres a map folder. Extract this rar to that maps folder and enjoy. Plays via lan, hamachi, etc however you choose to play with your friends. Its compatible with the current version of Halo Demo, not sure about previous versions.
