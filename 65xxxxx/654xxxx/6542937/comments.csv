,hootieman,2011-07-15T20:39Z,FAG. How can this be a 4meg halo game? You fucking retarded go shoot yourself in the face. That way the world has 1 less dumbass to deal with
,Aygan,2011-07-15T21:19Z,"A FAKE. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.

Contains a virus"
[T],n2kmaster,2011-07-15T23:09Z,"virus eh? Its a .map file AVG scans perfectly clean, its not a GAME ITS A MOD. Learn to read idiots.

AVG Readout:
""Scan """"Shell extension scan"""" completed.""
""No infection was found during this scan""

NOW how bout YOU go shoot yourself in the face for not reading a description, nor having a descent antivirus to tell you it's not a fake nor a virus. Its a .map file, zipped to rar, no password, a mod for Halo 1 Demo. Get it now retards?"
[T],n2kmaster,2011-07-15T23:10Z,ANNNNNNNNNND how bout you SUBMIT something other than a crappy misinformed opinion for a change?
[T],n2kmaster,2011-07-15T23:33Z,"by the way to those who can't figure out if its legit or not, take a look at it like this, them 2 idiots have never uploaded a torrent at all, and can't read a description, I've uploaded close to 200 torrents and never had a complaint of a virus in any of my stuff. You can choose who to believe."
