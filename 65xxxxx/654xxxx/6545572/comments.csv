,kurtly,2011-08-11T09:57Z,Hey HR. Your ups are the best. Period. If you dont have it i dont download it. Quick question - is there a way to only search your ups rather than going through page by page of your ups
[V],HolyRoses,2011-08-19T22:19Z,perhaps a custom google search.
,pbu26jj,2011-09-21T18:33Z,"I have a Popcorn Hour A110.  Any idea why Source Code doesn't play, but other uploads of m4v files by HR will play?  Your Highness plays just fine.  Does it have to do with subtitles being present?"
