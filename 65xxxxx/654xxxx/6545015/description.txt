Age of Empires III is mostly set in the New World during the colonial era, between circa 1492 and 1850. In the style of previous games of the series, the game requires the player to develop a European, Asian or North American nation's colony from a basic settlement to an empire, progressing through "Ages"â€”stages of technological developmentâ€”and destroying the enemy's colony. There are two main branches to gameplay: the economy, characterized by the collection of resources, and production of civilian unitsâ€”which usually gather resources; and the military which involves the production of military units, and the conflicts between armies of rival teams or factions.
