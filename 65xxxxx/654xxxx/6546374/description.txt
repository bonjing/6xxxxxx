Epic NYC Performance by Ronnie James Dio, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Vinny Appice Captured for a Trio of Releases Including Double CD, DVD and Deluxe CD/DVD Collection


Fans lucky enough to score tickets to Heaven And Hellï¿½s Radio City Music Hall performance on March 30ï¿½the concert sold out in a matter of minutesï¿½were fortunate witnesses to the glorious return of Ronnie James Dio, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Vinny Appice. Onstage in the U.S. for the first time in 15 years, the group let loose an onslaught of iconic metal spotlighting Dioï¿½s memorable tenure with Black Sabbath. Every bone-crushing riff and thunderous howl from the evening is relived with a trio of releases available in August 2007.

ï¿½Live From Radio City Music Hallï¿½ captures the band bashing its way through some of the Dio eraï¿½s best including ï¿½Mob Rules,ï¿½ ï¿½Die Young,ï¿½ ï¿½Neon Knights,ï¿½ ï¿½Children Of The Seaï¿½ and an epic 15-minute-plus version of ï¿½Heaven And Hell.ï¿½ The quartet also performed a pair of new songsï¿½the hit single ï¿½The Devil Criedï¿½ and ï¿½Shadow Of The Wind.ï¿½ Both songs debuted earlier this year on Black Sabbath: The Dio Years (Rhino/Warner Bros. Records), the first comprehensive introduction to the Dio eraï¿½s legacy. The DVD will include a tour documentary and other bonus footage.

Reuniting vocal maestro Dio, guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Vinny Appice onstage for the first time in fifteen years, the 2007 Heaven And Hell Live tour is making up for lost time with the sheer pageantry and thunderous roar of the quartet's performances. If you weren't lucky enough to be one of the about 6,000 fans to catch their March 30, 2007 date at NYC's Radio City Music Hall - the last date of the first North American leg of the tour, which sold out in minutes - experience it via Rhino's concert DVD with 5.1 Surround Sound, capturing every metallic flourish, bone-crushing riff and thunderous howl. If you were there, now you can relive it for eternity, along with a tour documentary and other bonus footage.
