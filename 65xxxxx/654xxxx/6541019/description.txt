 As a Sikh man with a full beard and turban,  
 AMRIT SINGH is often the target of racial    
 profiling. But when he sees his dreams of    
 becoming Chief of Surgery at a state-of-the  
 -art transplant center dwindle because of    
 his appearance, Amrit goes against a         
 tradition he's maintained his whole life and 
 cuts his hair. Hiding this decision from his 
 girlfriend and family in Toronto is only the 
 start of a series of compromises Amrit finds 
 himself making as he deals with hospital     
 politics and health care injustices. When his
 compromises result in the death of a patient,
 Amrit begins to reexamine the value of the   
 religious traditions he'd turned his back on.
