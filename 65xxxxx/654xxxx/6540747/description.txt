Storyline:

As Sauron launches the final stages of his conquest of Middle-earth, Gandalf the Wizard, and
Theoden King of Rohan rally their forces to help defend Gondor's capital Minas Tirith from the
looming threat. Aragorn finally claims the throne of Gondor and summons an army of ghosts
to help him defeat Sauron. Ultimately, even with full strength of arms, they realise they cannot
win; so it comes down to the Hobbits, Frodo and Sam, to bear the burden of the Ring and
deal with the treachery of Gollum. After a long journey they finally arrive in the dangerous
lands of Mordor, seeking to destroy the One Ring in the place it was created, the volcanic
fires of Mount Doom.

Released on 17 December 2003, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King received
rave reviews and became one of the greatest critical and box-office successes of all time,
becoming the highest grossing film from New Line Cinema, as well as the biggest financial
success for Time Warner in general. Notably, it won all eleven Academy Awards for which it
was nominated, an Oscar record (tying with Ben-Hur and Titanic). It also won the Academy
Award for Best Picture, the first time a fantasy film has done so.

Review [c/o amazon]


The Return of the King, the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious
conclusion. The trilogy could never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to
Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it
is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as
Frodo and Sam continue their mission to Mordor to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring.
While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn, endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith
with the allegiance of Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf, Frodo and Sam must survive the schizoid
deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy
Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation. Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and
Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic
sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions
of fellow hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure that The
Return of the King maintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship and remains faithful
to Tolkien's overall vision. By ending the LOTR trilogy with noble integrity and faith in the
power of imaginative storytelling, The Return of the King, like its predecessors, will stand as
an adventure for the ages. -- Jeff Shannon and David Horiuchi
