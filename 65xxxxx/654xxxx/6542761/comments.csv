If time travel ever becomes possible in my lifetime, I will travel back in time to yesterday and tell the world that time travel is possible.

Since that didn't happen, time travel must not be possible in my lifetime.

Either that, or I forgot about this comment by the time it was possible. ;)"

In a sense you, by the act of going back in time, have created a new universe.

Therefore it would be impossible to for you to return to the yesterday of this universe.

In any event if it were in fact possible to alter the time events of this universe the Department of Temporal Investigations of the future would probably prevent you from doing so."
