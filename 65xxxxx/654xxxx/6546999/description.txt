Trucker 2 lets you once again sit behind the  wheel      
of a truck and race on  American  highways.  Player      
can choose order of his missions. There are  nearly      
60 of them. You can buy one of 5  different  trucks      
which can be upgraded and modified in your  garage.      
Road's  surroundings  are  destructible,  and   the      
damage is visible on cars. Damage also affects  car      
handling.
