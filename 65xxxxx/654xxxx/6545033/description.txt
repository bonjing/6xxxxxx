The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) allows information to be
exchanged between a web server and a web browser. C# allows you to
program HTTP directly. HTTP programming allows you to create programs
that access the web much like a human user would. These programs, which
are called bots, can collect information or automate common web
programming tasks. This book presents a collection of very reusable
recipes for C# bot programming.
