Description......: Award-winning Tattoo Artist Lisa Fasulo runs a hands-on and unconventional tattoo school in upstate NY where students 
		   from all walks of life learn how to tattoo in just two weeks. These rookie students are seeking to change their lives 
		   through tattooing. With just two intense weeks under Lisa's instruction, they will get the experience tattooing on 
		   body after body with artwork of varying levels of difficulty.

		   Rookie students, models risking their skin to first time body artists, a rebellious instructor and unconventional 
	   	   training...who will bear the drama of competition and survive?

Release Notes....: Although there are no dates set for a full season of this show it is very reminiscent of a TLC pilot. In the event
		   that this were to turn into an actual series, I thought it best to tag as a pilot episode -- S01E00.
