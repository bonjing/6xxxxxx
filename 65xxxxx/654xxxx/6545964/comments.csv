,justregged,2011-07-18T21:43Z,Hey good man I thought u ignored my request. Now hopefully someone will re-encode them to a size I can manage. Thanks really appreciate it.
,wrkingclass_hero,2011-07-27T08:36Z,Great quality.  Do you have the other Blu-ray releases as well?
,inkyon,2011-08-01T09:11Z,Excellent work and any chance that other seasons will be available from you?
,inkyon,2011-08-03T07:53Z,"seriously, this show is so iconic and I am extremely surprised that there isn't any torrents for the rest of the seasons from the blu ray source. Anybody who know or have the blu ray seasons torrent, please find a link to post for me or upload it all here on the piratebay. That would be awesome if it occurs. Great work, again. "
,ztiberiusd,2011-08-16T22:35Z,Hey i know this sounds like a noobish question but I'm new to downloading stuff with 2 audios. How do you make it so it just plays the original english audio and not the russian dub? Cheers

[V],meech,2012-02-08T17:12Z,"Great stuff.  Thanks for this.  I didn't know that it was available in bluray.  Great quality, great t.v.  They don't make it like they used to.  Just wish there was more.

Yes, the dual language takes some extra space.  But we'll take it as we can get it. The russian over-enlish audio track is only 192kbps-2 channel, so it's not really taking a whole lot of extra space.

There's two audio tracks.  The first default track is Russian voice over English.  It's like hearing an echo in a foreign language.  The second track is pure English...interestingly a very high bitrate (640kbps) for 2 channel audio.

You should be able to choose which track you want in any popular video player.  If you're using ps3mediaserver, you have to use the transcode folder to force the english-only track.  Or if you use mkvmerge, you can remove the extra audio track altogether so you don't have to mess with any of that..although that would be more time consuming."
,NIGHTKILLER05,2012-05-02T08:14Z,THANKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! can you upload the rest of the seasons please please please ??????????
