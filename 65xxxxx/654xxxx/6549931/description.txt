Ubehage's EasyTools v1.11
-------------------------

Sorry for the n00bish bug in the previous release! :)



This is a small collection of useful tools for Windows:

- Wallpaper Changer; lets you select pictures to use as desktop wallpaper, and change between them at specified intervals.
- Log Off, Reboot or Shut Down; with a little tweak so you can force Windows to terminate.
- Change Screen Resolution; not as easy as it could be. But with a variety of choices.


Have fun!
