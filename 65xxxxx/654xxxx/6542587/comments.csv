,tannerman,2011-07-15T20:27Z,"this one has cuts all over it.
first cut i noticed was arround the 2 min mark when the goblin should reply something like ""i'm alive""
but it just skips that. god knows what else been cut.

with all those cuts this movie is not complete.
all releases are 1h 57 min, while it should be 2h 10 min (excluding the credits) "
,JuggaloLash,2011-07-15T21:45Z,tannerman needs to stfu
,tannerman,2011-07-15T21:56Z,"JuggaloLash
I'm just telling ppl the truth. why would anyone want to see a movie that is missing 20 scenes, 10 minutes? this is the last movie, if you want to see it like this, then fine. you should stfu btw"
,hugted,2011-07-16T00:16Z,@tannerman - We all know by now most of the torrents now are repackages of the same file so their all missing some scenes ok. So you don't need to copy paste the same message. 
,tannerman,2011-07-16T02:48Z,so many clueless ppl. its sad
,cigaretteburns,2011-07-16T16:08Z,"Tannerman - I am getting REALLY sick of your pointless and incorrect comments on all these HP7 files. This file is 1'56"" and yes the film running time in cinemas is 2'10"". However, the end credits are 11 minutes long so in total only about 2-3 minutes from the film are missing. No ""scenes"" are missing but yes some frames are missing from some shots. Tannerman, please get your facts right before posting shite. "
,tannerman,2011-07-17T01:39Z,"cigarreteburns, you're spreading lies on all hp7 torrents now. there are 5 minutes of vital scenes missing, i know which ones.

just do us a favour and leave this site, you leeching troll. we dont want ppl spreading lies here."
