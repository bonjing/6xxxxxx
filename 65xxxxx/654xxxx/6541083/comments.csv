,derda2,2011-07-16T18:59Z,works fine? has IE9? Cause i need to test a site with IE9 and cannot install SP1 on Vista...
,organshifter,2011-07-16T21:48Z,"morrig,

Would the torrent that you linked to happen to be Build 7955 and not 7995?"
,grant523,2011-07-17T02:33Z,"I saw people asking about this on youtube, on the video that is linked in the torrent, but you didn't say anything. The same thing is happening to me. I power it on, vmware loads, and then it says ""windows is loading files"". The progress bar fills up twice, then it goes back to vmware loading and then it keeps doing the same thing over and over. Help please!"
,TheWierd86,2011-07-18T14:31Z,"Thank you mate, looking forward to reviewing it and comparing the versions as new ones comes out."
,bbzlov,2011-07-19T16:37Z,Will be reviewing with a few screenshots when I'm done :D
,RishiKhetan,2011-07-21T07:52Z,hey grant523....i do agree with you...the same thing is happening to me.....what to do now....Help!!!!!
,makenshifox,2011-07-24T12:28Z,How do you disable debug mode in vmware? I have tried renaming vmware-vmx-debug.exe and vmware-remotemks-debug.exe but I still get the message that it is running in debug mode when it starts.
,moditgrandslak,2011-07-24T22:00Z,Same problem here... always reboots...
,ahvid_30,2011-07-30T20:32Z,It's a fake it's a windows 7!!!
,ossisfleeting,2011-08-15T09:59Z,I can't believe all these people are downloading this crap. This is a total farce.
,amathaka,2011-08-28T13:36Z,"Big fan of your Mac vmware uploads, but disappointed here: this is a beta of WINDOWS 7.
Uncool, man :("
,46399,2011-09-01T04:19Z,"Pre activated Windows 8 -> http://www.filestube.com/aFVgEHoDhCyiQOx5LjmysH/W8-M3-7989-Pre-Active.html

Haven't tried it yet. "
,erdodo9,2011-09-30T22:16Z,"Full SHIT what you provided here. Apart the VMware software this upload is useless.

THIS IS a VMware image of WINDOWS 7.

I hope the uploader burns in hell for his crap torrent.

So I did it myself. Check it out pirates. The real thang: https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6712750"
,SoulUploader,2011-10-01T09:33Z,*sigh* This is the Windows 8 pre-release as it was leaked 4 months back or whenever it was. They add features onto their latest system gradually before they put it all together. You should understand what you're downloading before you start calling it fake.
