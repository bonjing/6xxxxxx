A few of you may have heard of the recent leak of Windows 8 (at the stage it's at now), but fewer have actually used it. Well now I've made a VMware Image for you all to try without having to install it on a PC. There hasn't been a huge UI overhaul, but there are new features, so don't go expecting a completely different look just yet. There's a shortcut to take you to a tutorial of how to setup the VM if you're unsure, and the correct VMware to run the image is provided. Mac VMware is also included for those Mac users, enjoy!
