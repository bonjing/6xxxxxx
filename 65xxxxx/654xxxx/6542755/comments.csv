This one is not Cinavia Protected and I was able to stream to my Samsung TV and my PS3.

,shaqadelic,2011-07-17T23:48Z,Is Cinavia protected.  :-(   
,blusniffer,2011-07-20T22:04Z,"@twitchedout any file can be streamed to the ps3 from a pc/laptop and work, it's when u try to actually insert + play a pirate copy on the ps3 that the cinavia copyright stops the playback or audio.
My only prob with ps3 media server is that my playback jumps too much to watch a movie wirelessly! :("

i have had several Cinavia protected files  that  stop when streamed to the PS3 
so its not just on the ones  you insert + play"
,Chadly,2011-07-31T03:04Z,"I just got a ps3 a lil while ago and it seems to me that all cam versions of movies I try and stream to the ps3 are blocked. So im thinking its gonna be the same with all cam version files. Sucks but meh, its free so what are u gonna do? I can handle watching what movies I cant wait for, on a 21"" comp screen.... Thanks for the up Bone :)"
