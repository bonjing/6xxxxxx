Then the perspective drawing features in Illustrator CS5 are introduced, beginning with working in Perspective View, followed by lessons in drawing and creating and transforming shapes in perspective. More advanced topics like moving objects in 3D and working with text and symbols are covered next, and finally the authors walk the reader through the construction of a simple scene.
