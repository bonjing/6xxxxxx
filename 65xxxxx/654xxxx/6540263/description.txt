Between the 9th and 7th century BC, Assyrian warrior kings created a great empire in the Middle East. They were helped by their battalions of charioteers - the first that the world had seen. In the 21st century, a carriage-maker, a horse trainer and historians â€“ using only a few existing wall reliefs as guides - try to figure out how the chariots were made.
