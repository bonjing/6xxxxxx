,manibro,2012-06-13T04:15Z,"Guys this link solved my problem, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9960227/error-in-setup-xcode-4-2-1 for me it was certificate release data problem. As the uploader uploaded in 2011 the certificate expired in 2012, you need to set  your date to 1 Aug 2011 and try to install again, hope it works.  "
