,rahsoft,2011-07-16T17:06Z,"good luck with seeding this
however I going to pass on this because I don't think downloading a 1gb rar is such a good idea.
You would have been  better perhaps breaking it into smaller parts that would allow people to download just a small part to try out

,JoeEDangerously,2011-07-17T01:32Z,"Well, I thought I did separate the strip and the 35 issues. They should be in two separate folders. If this is not the case, please PM me on how to do it. However, I think most everyone who wants this wants all of it. But I will see if I can't split it. There are a lot of substantially larger torrents out there, so I really don't think a 1gb file is a lot to DL at once. Traffic is extremely high typically, so I know a lot of people want this. I had it decompressed so you wouldn't have to use RAR or Zip, but that one was 1.15, so I figured to get it out as efficiently as possible, I'd compress it. If you'd prefer the original, I'll put that back up too."
