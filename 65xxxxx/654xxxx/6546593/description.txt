The 7th Edition of our award-winning B-25J Mitchell has had a major rework.  First of all, both the FSX and FS9 installers will automatically detect your particular Flightsim path, even if it\\\'s one of those Win7/Vista 64 bit non-standard paths.  Of course, for the first time, this also means no more messing about with upgrades, patches and fixes to get the B-25 up and running in FSX.

But that is just the beginning of the new goodies.. He He Have fun Guys....
