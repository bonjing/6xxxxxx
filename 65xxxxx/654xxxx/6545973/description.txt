For the participants of the 2011 Joroinen Triathlon, Finland here are some quality photos of the race. In no special order, mostly of the 90km cycling leg, unsorted and un-edited. Sorry for some of the out of focus shots, the few that there might be... Nonetheless, a great day, take what you want and delete what you don\'t! Thanks for the wonderful day!
