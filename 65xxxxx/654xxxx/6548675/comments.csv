Windows 7 and wista kinds with all  of trouble many things are not compatible.Many people complain about them,but the game has very good graphics in   does not ask for any CD .With the exception of ISO trash but it is not download here them need crack and pathc and no added,  dont added  the stupid uploader and can not be installed.This is a ready-packed programm this includes everything ,do not touch them.Follow the instructions, a better RE2 is not going to find anywhere this is perfect full game+good graphics+instructions.Ready-packaged ready-installed you will get a full game only to be set and ready. Ready packed full game  for installation does not require.Works perfectly the game on windows xp.But if you think look around you'll see that this is the best Resident evil 2 all the internet and I am sure."
