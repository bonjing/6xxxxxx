Your previous upload of this has been deleted."
,KingBooob,2011-07-16T20:25Z,"Velvet: Yeah i tryed to delete it but it didnt work.
Something wrong with the tpb i think, also have HTTP Error on most of my TPB torrents.

Downloaders: I should now be seeding to you. I will have it online till the last day of this world.
Speed is not a problem, any problem with the torrent?
Please comment!

Thank you!"

,AFCRyan,2011-07-17T20:05Z,"More than happy to seed when complete, but since you said 'speed is not a problem' when it clearly is - i'm getting varied speeds of 70KBPS, dropping to 7-8KBPS ...

I'm hanging on in there though; mainly because I like my music in 320KBPS ;) "
,AFCRyan,2011-07-17T20:23Z,"After I posted the speeds really picked up, ignore my first comment! 

Great torrent KingBooob, +1"
