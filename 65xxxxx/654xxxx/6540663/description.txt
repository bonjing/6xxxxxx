 Animal cell technology is a growing discipline of cell biology which aims not only to understand structures, functions and behaviors of differentiated animal cells, but also to ascertain their abilities to be used for industrial and medical purposes. The goal of animal cell technology includes the clonal expansion of differentiated cells, the optimization of their culture conditions, modulation of their ability to produce proteins of medical and pharmaceutical importantance, and the application of animal cells to gene therapy, artificial organs and the production of functional foods. This volume gives the readers a complete review of the present state-of-the-art and will be useful for those working in either academic environments or in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors, particularly cell biologists, biochemists, molecular biologists, immunologists, biochemical engineers and all other disciplines related to animal cell culture.
