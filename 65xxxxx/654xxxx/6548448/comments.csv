,anzypanzy,2011-07-19T02:59Z,"Don't know if its something perhaps you're doing but event though they are RARfiles, video works fine for me. A/10 V/10"
,dinkmtz,2011-07-19T07:50Z,"When opened, VLC player asks to repair file. When it does the video is only about a minute and a half."
,eagletaz,2011-07-19T08:45Z,"that's what i get every time with this person, only a minute of it. I have tried all the time with this person and fail everytime. I am waiting for T.v team they never let me down always get the whole movie each time...."

,eagletaz,2011-07-20T07:22Z,Don't get shotime....dickhead
,eagletaz,2011-07-20T07:28Z,"I know when the episode is airing but some ppl don't have pay t.v to be able to watch it, that is why we download off here. So before you start calling ppl idiots, take a good look at yourself dickhead."
,dinkmtz,2011-07-20T12:01Z,"Negatiiv92, thanks for the comments. I hadn't laugh so hard in a while."
,Negatiiv92,2011-07-20T16:52Z,"I live in norway, so i don't either have showtime.. I mean, don't get tricked by the rar files, they're out long before the episode is airing. Check that, before you download an unaired show... God damn.."
,eagletaz,2011-07-20T23:19Z,This is all new to alot of ppl who download off here including myself. This is why we look at the comments and then go from there if we download or not. We don't need to be told that we are idiots because you know what you are doing and we don't. We look for advise so that we don't get caught next time. So negatiiv92 next time someone writes something give them the help they need minus the idiot comment you gave.
,countrygrlkc,2011-07-25T17:42Z,Do you have episode 8 yet? I heard it was good! Cant wait! You are usually the first to post and I just want to say that I always appreciate your uploads! Thanks scenebalance! And as long as you have RAR...it always opens the files with no issues at all...perfect copy every time.
