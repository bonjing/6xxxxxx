,ghandi253,2011-07-18T07:10Z,"To be honest, I have only been using it a couple of days. However, the main program I have used in the past was SoThink DVD Maker, but it took at least 1 1/2 hours to make a DVD. This program does it in about 30 minutes, and that's on the same computer with the same burner. The only difference is the software. I would assume that if your burner is slow with this program that it is probably slow with most burning programs. That means 1 of 2 things: 

1. Your drivers for your optic drive are corrupted. I would recommend installing the newest drivers from the manufacturer.

2. The registry from your optic drive are corrupted and you need to delete the upper and lower filters in the registry.

But, I could be wrong. Please, let me know what your situation is and I will do my best to get you going at your best. If you wish, email me at ghandi253@gmail.com and I will be able to help you better, or you can continue to reply here on TPB. I check it everyday."
