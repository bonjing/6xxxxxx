,jaded3825,2011-08-03T00:55Z,"i should clarify, the movie is not in english, it is dubbed in a foriegn language."
,Mutegrill,2011-08-05T12:56Z,"It's Portuguese. Imagine being the guy having to dub into their language, trying to make as good a job as Adrian Brody. Pretty futile! That is why language dubs are so retartaning. Much like the the people in the countries where dubbing is still requested:

""Mummy, give me the pacifier NOW!""

By the way; I hate when samples does not reveal any conversational audio..."
