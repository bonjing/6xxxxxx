The Beast is a 1996 made for TV movie starring William Petersen, Karen Sillas and Charles Martin Smith. The movie is based on the 1991 novel Beast by Jaws author Peter Benchley. The film is about a giant squid that attacks and kills several people when its food supply becomes scarce and its offspring is killed. It was filmed primarily in New South Wales, Australia.

Plot
----
The film begins when a couple disappear while having a romantic night out on a yacht near the Pacific Northwest resort community, Grave's Point. The next day, local fisherman Whip Dalton (William Petersen) finds the empty lifeboat from the missing yacht and finds a large claw stuck into the boat. Whip sends the claw to a university to be analyzed and it ends up in the hands of marine biologist Dr. Herbert Talley (Ronald Guttman), who comes to Graveâ€™s Point claiming it is from the tentacle of a Giant squid. The island harbor master Schuyler Graves (Charles Martin Smith) tries to hire Whip to kill the squid, but he refuses, so Graves sends out Lucas Coven (Larry Drake) instead. Coven succeeds in slaying the squid and the carcass is promptly sold by Graves to Sea Land Texas owner Osborne Manning (Denis Arndt).

Dr. Talley then organizes a submersible expedition to explore the squidâ€™s habitat. But after analyzing the carcass of the dead squid, the scientists determine it is just a baby. The information comes too late and the huge adult squid attacks the submersible and everyone on board is killed. Whip then agrees to go out and hunt the giant squid but only if he can use his boat and Graves goes with him. He is also accompanied by coast guard officer, Lt. Kathryn Marcus (Karen Sillas), Dr. Talley, and Manning. They plan to snare the squid, reel it in, and shoot it multiple times with darts full of cyanide. The plan succeeds and the squid appears dead. But when the shipâ€™s engine breaks down, Manning reveals that he filled the darts with tranquilizer instead of cyanide so he could take the squid alive back to Sea Land. Whip tries to cut the squid loose, but it wakes up and attacks the ship. Talley, Graves, and Manning are killed. A coast guard helicopter arrives in time to pick up Kathryn and Whip. As he boards the chopper, Whip fends the squid off with an axe, chopping open several extra fuel drums and having Kathryn use a flare gun to light his boat on fire, causing an explosion that finally incinerates and kills the giant squid. The helicopter flies them back to the shore where they reunite with Whip's daughter Dana (Missy Crider).


Review By Your Friendly Neighborhood Hyperdrive25
..................................................
The first time I saw a giant squid, it was in Walt Disney's 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea based on Jules Verne's classic, starring legends Kirk Douglas and James Mason. The second time I saw one, it was in this film. The film is very entertaining and worth watching again and again. I think it is because mankind is fascinated by these strange, mysterious creatures that existed even before man walked the earth. 

This is also the second Peter Benchley film I saw, after Steven Speilberg's Jaws 
which also features that legendary Great White Shark. 

This film also stars my favorite actor William Petersen(Manhunter) who I admire very much. Also Larry Drake(Darkman) makes a welcome appearance in this one.

I hope you thoroughly enjoy this film, and share the film with those who do not haven't seen it. Remember to backup the film on CD/DVD as well.
