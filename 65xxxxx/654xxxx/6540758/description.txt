The two concepts at the centre of this book: Europe, and the Second World War, are constantly changing in public perception. Now that â€˜Europeâ€™ is an even more contested idea than ever, this volume informs the current discourse on European identity by analysing Europeâ€™s reaction to the tragedy, heroism and disgrace of the Second World War.

â€œThe question of how to define European identity remains fiercely contested in contemporary politics and scholarship. This fascinating collection of essays explores how the lacerating experience of the Second World War impacted on thinking about the meaning of Europe, in ways that still resonate today.â€ â€“Patrick Finney, Aberystwyth University
