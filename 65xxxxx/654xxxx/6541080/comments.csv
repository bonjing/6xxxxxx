,L0uzii,2011-07-15T01:42Z,also the extra songs are 320 kbps.. not 192 kbps. I'm sorry.
,L0uzii,2011-07-15T01:45Z,and the size is 130.2 MB -.- I was in abit of a hurry
,Manderp,2011-07-15T13:34Z,"Thank you!
Any chance of better versions of 16, 17 & 19?
Make up is Escape The Fate's unreleased song.."
,L0uzii,2011-07-15T15:07Z,those 3 songs weren't recorded in a studio.. one of them is even recorded from jail so i dont think i can get them in better quality
