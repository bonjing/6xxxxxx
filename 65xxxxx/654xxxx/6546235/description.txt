The screen zoom feature in Lion features a picture-in-picture view, allowing you to see the zoomed area in a separate window while keeping the rest of the screen at its native size. Choose to have the window follow the cursor, or keep the window in one place to show only areas you navigate.

International braille tables
Lion includes built-in support for more than 80 new braille tables supporting a wide range of languages.

Braille verbosity settings
You can now specify the default verbosity level (amount of information you want to receive) for use with a refreshable braille display. And you can specify verbosity levels for specific controls, such as applications, checkboxes, and Dock items, as well as headings, images, and links.

High-resolution cursor
In Lion, the cursor is crisp and sharp at larger sizes.

Improved drag and drop

VoiceOver activities
With VoiceOver activities, you can create groups of preferences for specific uses. For example, you can create an activity to use a certain voice and faster speaking rate when youâ€™re shopping online catalogs. Create a second activity to use a different voice and slower speaking rate when youâ€™re reading online newspapers. You can switch activities manually or have VoiceOver switch automatically based on the applications you use.

No setup or configuration
AirDrop doesnâ€™t require setup or special settings.

No network required
AirDrop uses Peer-to-Peer Wi-Fi between participating Mac computers and doesnâ€™t require a wireless network infrastructure or base station.

Automatic discovery
OS X Lion automatically discovers other Mac computers nearby that are using AirDrop. They appear in the Finder, and AirDrop displays the usersâ€™ contact photos.

Drag-and-drop file sharing
To share a file, simply drag it onto a personâ€™s contact photo. Your Mac verifies that you want to send the file, then sends a request to the recipient. When the request is accepted, the file transfers to the personâ€™s Downloads folder.

Secure file transfer
Files are encrypted using TLS for secure transfer.

Firewall protection
AirDrop creates a firewall between you and the person you are sharing a file with, preventing anyone from accessing your computer over that connection.

AirDrop visibility
When you close the Finder window or click outside AirDrop, your Mac is no longer visible to other users.

	Auto Save
Saves as you go
Apps developed with Auto Save can automatically save changes to your document as you work, freeing you from manual saving and from the worry that youâ€™ll lose your valuable work if the app quits. And because Auto Save saves all changes in the background, you can work without the distraction of pauses or progress bars.

Saves in place
Auto Save in Lion adds the changes directly into the file so thereâ€™s only one copy of the document on your Mac.

Revert to last saved version
Apps with Auto Save enabled let you easily undo recent changes. Choose Revert from the center of the title bar, and your document reverts to its state when you last opened it.

Duplicate a document
Duplicate creates a copy of a document and places it next to the original, so you can start fresh using the original as a template.


Lock documents
You can lock a document at any time to prevent inadvertent changes. Two weeks after the last edit, Lion automatically locks the document for you. When you try to make a change, Lion alerts you and asks if you want to unlock or duplicate the file.

	Finder
All My Files
Instantly view all the files on your Mac in a single window in the Finder. All My Files gathers all your files â€” no matter where theyâ€™re located â€” and displays them in an organized view. Itâ€™s smart about what it collects, showing only files you commonly open, such as documents, images, and videos, while leaving out system files.

Sort files
A new button in the Finder toolbar lets you sort files by category, making it easier to find what youâ€™re looking for. Sort files by kind, application, date modified, date added, or size.

Gesture navigation
In icon view, files in each group are displayed in rows of icons, so you can swipe through them quickly using your Multi-Touch trackpad or Magic Mouse.

Search suggestions
As you type in the search field, the Finder dynamically suggests the most relevant matches based on the contents of your Mac. It searches for items such as file type, download source, sender, and label.

Search tokens
Building on the power of search suggestions, the Finder in OS X Lion includes tokens â€” a smart new way to filter your searches. When you select a suggestion, a token is created. Instantly your search is filtered, and you see only the files that meet those criteria. You can change the scope of the token by clicking the arrow. If you want to narrow your search even more, you can use multiple tokens together. For example, to find all the Keynote presentations sent by Chris, enter â€œKeynoteâ€ and â€œChrisâ€ in the search field. This creates two tokens, so the Finder displays only presentations from Chris.

Merge folders
When you try to combine two folders with the same name, the Finder now offers to merge them into a single folder.


Group as folder
Instantly create a folder from selected files by choosing the â€œgroup as folderâ€ item from the contextual menu.

Drag files
When you drag multiple files from one location to another, they flock together. An indicator also appears next to the cursor, telling you how many files youâ€™re moving.

Keep both files
When you attempt to add a file to a folder that contains a file of the same name, the Finder now offers to keep both files, appending the word â€œcopyâ€ to the name of the new file.

Lion lets you choose a clean start, so you return to a fresh desktop after you restart your Mac.

	Safari
Full-screen Safari
Take Safari full screen and experience your favorite websites on a grander scale. Itâ€™s perfect for viewing more of your Gmail inbox, Facebook newsfeed, or Twitter trends.

Tap to zoom
Double-tap to have Safari quickly zoom in on a column of text or an image. The text and graphics scale up smoothly, and text remains razor sharp. Double-tap again to return to the original size.


Pinch to zoom
Pinch to zoom in and out on text and graphics more precisely.

Swipe to navigate
You can navigate through the pages of a website using gestures. Swipe left and the next page slides smoothly into view. Swipe right to go back.

Reading List
Reading List lets you save web pages to read when you have time.

Private AutoFill
Safari lets you fill out forms quickly while keeping your personal information private. Safari keeps your information private until you choose to send it by detecting web forms and presenting you with a drop-down field, letting you choose to AutoFill the form with information from your Address Book. No information is added to web forms until you choose to use AutoFill.

New process architecture
Web browsing is now more stable and responsive because one process handles web content, while another handles interactions with the browser interface. That means an unresponsive web process wonâ€™t affect the browser, so you can keep browsing without restarting Safari.

Improved graphics performance
Web pages that use the HTML5 Canvas element can tap into the graphics processing unit on your Mac to display graphics and animations. With improved hardware acceleration for Canvas, games and interactive web applications render faster and smoother in the browser.

Downloads list
When you download files in Safari, an arrow appears to the right of the Smart Search Field to show you the progress of your download. Click the arrow to see downloads. You can also clear downloads from the list or view them in the Finder.

Drag-and-drop downloads
You can drag downloaded files from the Downloads list to your desktop for easy organization.

Find option
When you use Find in Safari, you can choose to search for text that either contains or starts with the text you type in the search field. Click the magnifying glass to switch between the two options.

Full-screen web pages
With the new Full Screen JavaScript API, developers can create immersive web experiences without the need for a plug-in.

Media caching
Safari can store audio and video data for web applications that use the HTML5 application cache, allowing for offline media playback and better media performance over a slow Internet connection.

Privacy pane
A new Privacy pane in Safari preferences gives you more information about and control over your online privacy. You can clear website data, customize cookie settings, and decide whether websites can request your location information.

View website data
Now you can see a list of all the websites that have stored data on your computer, what theyâ€™ve stored, and where theyâ€™ve stored it.

Remove all website data
Safari makes it simple to clear the information websites can use to track you online. In the Privacy pane, click Remove All Website Data and then confirm. Safari removes cookies and Flash plug-in data, as well as information from databases, local storage, and the application cache. You can also clear data on a site-by-site basis.


Auto setup for Gmail and Yahoo!
in Mail

When you first log in to your Google, Yahoo!, or AOL accounts in Safari, youâ€™ll have the option to use them with Mail, iCal, Address Book, iChat, and other applications on your Mac.

Sandboxing
All the websites and applications you use in Safari are sandboxed, so they donâ€™t have access to information on your system. If a website contains malicious code intended to capture personal data or tamper with your computer, sandboxing provides a built-in blocker that restricts the code from doing harm.

MathML support
Support for MathML allows web pages to display mathematical notations.

WOFF support
Support for the Web Open Font Format (WOFF) gives web designers and developers the ability to use a wider range of fonts on websites.

CSS3 auto-hyphenation
Support for CSS3 auto-hyphenation allows developers to provide better reading experiences and text layouts.

CSS3 vertical text
Support for CSS3 vertical text allows for top-to-bottom text layouts in web pages. This enables greater customization of websites in languages that use vertical text, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.

CSS3 text emphasis
With the text emphasis property, web pages can display emphasis marks in East Asian text.

Custom content in extensions
Safari now allows extensions to show custom HTML content in a borderless window from the extensionâ€™s toolbar, or when you click an icon in the extensionâ€™s toolbar.

	Screen Sharing
Per-user screen sharing
You can remotely log in to a Mac with any user account on that computer and control it, without interrupting someone else who might be using the computer under a different login.

Go full screen
Take the screen-sharing application full screen in Lion so you can observe and control a remote Mac using the entire screen. It feels as if you are sitting right in front of the other Mac.

Use Apple ID to authenticate
You can now use an Apple ID to authenticate with another Mac running OS X Lion to start a screen-sharing session. This is perfect for giving others access to your Mac without creating separate user accounts. Simply add their Apple IDs to the list of authorized users, and they can log in with their credentials.

Observe Only mode
The new Observe Only mode lets you watch a remote computer without controlling the mouse or trackpad movements.

New screen-sharing toolbar
Screen sharing includes a new toolbar that provides access to useful tools and settings such as screen resolution, Clipboard access, and screen capture.

	Security
Enhanced runtime protection
Address space layout randomization (ASLR) has been improved for all applications. It is now available for 32-bit apps (as are heap memory protections), making 64-bit and 32-bit applications more resistant to attack.

Application sandboxing
Sandboxing protects the system by limiting the kinds of operations an application can perform, such as opening documents or accessing the network. Sandboxing makes it more difficult for a security threat to take advantage of an issue in a specific application to affect the greater system.

Drag and drop from Spotlight menu
Now you can drag items from the Spotlight menu, which makes it quick and convenient to send a document via email or AirDrop.

Search Wikipedia
When you choose Search Wikipedia from the Spotlight menu, the Dictionary application opens and displays the Wikipedia entry for the term.

	System

Windows migration

	Time Machine
Local snapshots
OS X Lion lets you take the Time Machine experience with you when youâ€™re away from your Time Capsule or backup drive. Time Machine keeps a spare copy of the files you create, modify, or delete right on your Mac. Now if you accidentally delete a file while on the road, you can recover it from a local copy.

Combined timeline
When you connect your Mac to your Time Machine backup drive or Time Capsule, Time Machine automatically displays everything you did while you were away with your existing Time Machine backups. So when you enter the Time Machine interface, it will look like you never left your Mac.

	Versions

Records the history of a document
OS X Lion can keep an ongoing record of your document as it evolves. Lion records snapshots of your document as you make changes or reach important milestones.

Automatic versions
Each time you open a document, Lion automatically saves the current version. It also saves a new version every hour while you work, building a history of the document as you go.

Manual versions
You can manually create a version of a document at any time by choosing â€œSave a Versionâ€ from the File menu.

Efficient storage
Lion saves only the information that has changed since the last version, making efficient use of space on your hard drive. And it manages the version history of a document, keeping hourly versions for a day, daily versions for a month, and weekly versions for all previous months.

Browse versions
Lion makes it easy to browse previous versions. Using an interface similar to that of Time Machine, you can browse the version history of a document to see how it looked at any time. A timeline shows all the versions that exist for the document. To view a previous version, simply click a specific date.

Side-by-side comparison
When youâ€™re browsing versions, a side-by-side comparison feature allows you to see the current state of a document next to the previous one, so you can easily note the differences.

Built into Lion
The Xsan file system is built into OS X Lion, allowing any Mac with appropriate connectivity to access an Xsan volume.

Case insensitivity option
For improved performance and simplicity, you can now create case-insensitive Xsan volumes. These volumes act like traditional HFS+ volumes and do not distinguish between uppercase and lowercase characters in filenames.

New preference pane
A new Xsan pane in System Preferences makes it easier to manage, mount, and unmount Xsan volumes.


Industry-standard multipathing
Lion supports the Asymmetric Logical Unit Access (ALUA) standard for multipathing and failover. This allows Xsan to be used with a variety of Fibre Channel RAID storage arrays.
