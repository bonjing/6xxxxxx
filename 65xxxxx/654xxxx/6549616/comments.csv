,Stonerage,2011-07-19T12:13Z,"Average Download Speed: 5.1mb/s
Peaked at 8mb/s.

The movie plays perfectly fine, nice work on encoding the subtitles.

For a TS Release I would give this a
V:7
A:9
It is a bit dark at some scenes.
The Audio is exceptional for being a TS Release.


Remember, It is a TS Release, do not expect perfect quality. In my opinion, fully watchable.

Cheers for a great upload."

,Tiroloco,2011-07-26T14:55Z,"dont even bother in answering to those guys man, they seem not to have a life and use their time to be messing with others
we have a lot of that in here, people that tries to send trash to other uploads u can guess the purpose, dunno the objective though, they seem retards to me, same old story, some seem to be in a war to control uploads, again retards, u win that by uploading good things, not bashing on others
the release is good for a TS"
,Spluringen,2011-07-27T00:05Z,"Varför skriver alla kommentarer på engelska, när det är svensk textning på filmen? :P"
,lou357,2011-08-08T02:31Z,"A: 8
V: 7
Good quality, sound gets softer about a third thru the movie then comes back to normal."
,LionSword,2011-08-13T11:30Z,Bland det sämsta i textning jag någonsin varit med om. Ska man behöva teaterkikare när man sitter hemma framför tv:n???
