,waldner1,2011-07-14T23:40Z,Fake?
,piratjenka,2011-07-14T23:58Z,why is there verified version out yet? =/
,rmctmrx6,2011-07-15T00:42Z,"you're welcome everyone!

I assure you that it's for real.  I may not have a skull but I don't upload fakes.  It's not my cap but I checked it out first, plays fine.

Damages moved over to DirecTV for this season and one more.  I guess the scene groups are a little slow getting this going.  It is the summer after all."

,burt2010,2011-07-15T04:59Z,"Brilliant!
This show was just too smart for most people. If you didn't watch it from the first episode you were lost for the rest of the season. 
Many thanks for this!!!"

,Fangular,2011-07-28T10:34Z,"Thanks for this rmctmrx6 (a name that's harder to type than one might think!).. are you going to upload any of the rest of the episodes? I'm sure I'm speaking for hundreds of others when I say it'd be greatly appreciated if you did! (I love this file size too, btw, so thanks also for keeping it small and manageable.)"
