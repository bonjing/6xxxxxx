,Dadoggy03,2011-07-17T03:09Z,"Wow, Already! Thanks a lot. Nice d/l speed too. "
,Rawlikesushi,2011-07-21T03:03Z,"fArGo1911,
 I just want to say thank you for the up and the time you put into it. You are a true knight."
,Reviewer,2011-07-22T22:32Z,"I made the mistake of reading the entire wikipedia page on the book series, and completely spoiled books 2-4 for myself. So now I will skip ahead and read this one, thanks uploader.

,MTWitherspoon,2011-07-25T06:49Z,"You, sir, are a god and, after getting through one and a half chunks of that other version, I shall sing your praises for a thousand years."
,Scribblur,2011-07-30T22:24Z,"We have finally found Azor Ahai come again, and the name of our champion is fArGo1911. Bow down before the great one and cast aside your false heroes and gods, there is only one god of the chapterized audio book torrents, and there is only one thing we say to this god....thank you "

But I got really sad in heart when I hear Roy Dotrice. He is so bad and he is the hole reason for me to skip one audiobook in the series so far. I had the luck to have the Roy Avers version of the first two books. I really love him. And when Roy Dotrice came in my headphones I just could not get through the prologue. What a crap. He sounds the age of Aeamos Targarayan in all chars... so bad I could not understand to let him in again. John Lee was far from perfect but it was listenable which Dotrice surely is not.

On a scale 1 to 10.
Roy Avers 9p
John Lee  6p
Roy Dotrice .... zero."
,Polar0id,2011-09-12T07:50Z,"Normally I don't write posts on TPB, I think it's because of general laziness. Also I like to make the least possible plause of connection I can have to making downloads and seeds, since I live in Nanny-State Australia. Getting that out of the way, though.

I really have too say, fArgo1911, I have to take off my half-helm to you for making this torrent. Not only is it beyond obvious doubt very high quality (I couldn't imagine the amount of time gone into making this), you also included these GRRM groupie loving maps and family trees. I have to admit, I'm a very big fan of these books, and though I have downloaded all of these audiobooks (side note: FUCK JOHN LEE, THE BASTARD SOUNDS THE SAME FOR EVERY CHARACTER AND RUINED THE BOOK) this was the highest quality by far. I am even going to buy the books just to support GRRM, but I would much rather download this torrent than get a stupid 40 pack of CD's any day. 

So on that note: THANK YOU. If I were your kindergarten teacher, I'd give you not one, but two giant gold stars on the blackboard. (the chocolate prize for good behaviour would have been yours, buddy).

Now, the next topic of discussion: The book. 
Whilst I think book numbers 1-3 were better reading (less characters and more story - IE less fucking around), I am happy to say that I am still absolutely hooked like a meth addict on this fabulous story. GRRM is such a cock-tease, isn't he? You read 450 pages of building up, then the last 50 pages are a boom that ends on an unanswered question.

So, for any of you that actually read my post and aren't sure whether or not to start reading the series - READ IT, it's better than sex. If you are still not sure, then watch the HBO series first. If you do not get hooked on that wonderful translation for the eyes, then you are probably less intelligent than a guy who doesn't even have the capacity to realise he's dribbling. 

And for the avid fans, I pose you this question: Do you think a dragon is 'wargable'? Pretty sure Bran is going to Boss A Dragon (BAD, for badass, because he's even too badass for legs) in the next book (or maybe after). 

So, without further adue, here are my ratings:

Book awesomeness: 8.9  (in comparison to his other books, it's better than a feast for crows which gets a 7.5 from me)
Quality of audiobook: 10 (thank you, again)
Roy Dotrice voice sexiness: 10
If you actually read my post you also get a gold star from me, for your patience. 

valar morghulis to you all.

,Bruseb,2011-10-25T14:59Z,Roy Dotrice for president!
,niklycra,2011-10-25T23:51Z,Roy Dotrice destroys an otherwise excellent book. What a shame!
,orangeboy7000,2011-11-04T01:47Z,Roy Dotrice is okay 60% of the time. The problem is that when he reads male characters that are supposed to be in their teens or even early 20's they always sound like gruff 40 year-old's.
,bondjing,2012-03-04T15:09Z,"One of the best torrents ever!

Crazy amount of work went into this torrent

BIG UP TO fArGo!!"
,beluuuuu,2012-04-11T12:10Z,Thank you
,Kiriyama87,2012-05-12T14:10Z,"Big thanks for this. I was reading it as an e-book, leading to headaches after sitting and starting at black text on white background on my computer for hours on end.

I guess the reader is okay. Only problem I have with him, is he sometimes forget to switch tone in his voice when switching between characters.

Anyway, I can tell alot of work has been going into this, so big props to you!"
