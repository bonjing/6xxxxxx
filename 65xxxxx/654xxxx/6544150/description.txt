 Suburbia has twisted the American dream into a nightmare. The United States now has the most rapes, assaults, murders, and serial killings per capita, by a wide margin, than any other first-world nation. Itâ€™s a Sprawl World After All is the first book to link Americaâ€™s increase in violence and the corresponding breakdown in society with the post-World War II development of suburban sprawl.
 Without small towns to bring people together, the unplanned growth of sprawl has left Americans isolated, alienated, and afraid of the strangers that surround them. Suburbia has substituted cars for conversation, malls for main streets, and the artificial community of television for authentic social interaction.
