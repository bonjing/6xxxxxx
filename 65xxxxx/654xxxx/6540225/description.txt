Part 2. Fireship
In 674 AD the gates of Constantinople were under attack from the massed armies of the emerging Islamic world. It seemed as if the most prestigious city in Christendom was about to fall to the infidels, but then Constantinople unleashed a secret, new and highly powerful weapon: the fireship. Now two teams of specialists are aiming to recreate the fireship. It had on board two formidable weapons: a catapult and a flame-thrower. In France, one team re-build the catapult, with its complicated firing mechanisms; in the UK another team develop the pump system used to project the blazing oil. When the two teams meet up in a Maltese harbour to test out their work, results are, initially at least, somewhat mixed.
