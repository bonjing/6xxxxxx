Indeed, from what I've read on the official Miracle Day site, this season was (almost) entirely funded by an American network. I for one am very happy that it got picked up by them so we actually get new episodes.

@eztv: Thank you for your fantastic uploads. I'm a big fan!"

,Mr.Todger,2011-07-20T21:12Z,"Just to let you know that i'm glad this as come back.
And that the USA have donated towards it as it is a good show and BBC tend to be Dickheads when knowing about good shows. 
Just letting you know that i'm from UK and we pay a tv license fee for everything that is shown in this country nothing is free on tv for us.
