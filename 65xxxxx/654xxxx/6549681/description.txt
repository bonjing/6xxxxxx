A whole lot of people downloaded my first version of a discography of the masters of metal, but I've completely redone it with enlarged artworks, CDM's, 7"s and more.. I'm sure Blackie would scream at you to go buy the CD's yourself, so think of this as merely a preview and a window on some of those extremely rare releases that you'll never get unless you fork out too much money on eBay, which Blackie also doesn't like one bit!
