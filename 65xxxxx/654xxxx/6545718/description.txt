Torchwood S04E02 HDTV XviD-LOL [ICM369]

Miracle Day â€“ Rendition

Original Airdate: July 21st, 2011 (July 15th, 2011 In USA)

The second episode of the new season of Torchwood slows down a little,
but still hands the viewer a lot to digest. 

Rex, who at the end of episode one had announced that he was extraditing 
the team to America, is being railroaded by a colleague and former lover,
Lyn (played with effective evilness by Dichen Lachman), who is taking over 
the arrest. 

Rhys and Anwen are sent back home as Jack and Gwen are loaded on a plane for 
the states most of their time is spent on the flight, but even on a plane, a 
lot can happen.

Esther is suddenly making unwanted waves as she is trying to get more involved 
with the Torchwood investigation. 

Her inquiries and interest are catching the eye of someone that doesnâ€™t want 
Torchwood to come out of this alive. 

However, the reasons for that are still a mystery. Â»
