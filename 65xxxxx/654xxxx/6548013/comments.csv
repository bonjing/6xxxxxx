,-Revy-,2011-07-18T03:29Z,"Is this the unrated director's cut? I saw the pic but it's not in the title or description so...

If it's not, anyone got a link to it?"
,downaccs,2011-07-22T12:28Z,is the subtitle being hardcoded?
,thorborn,2011-08-10T15:47Z,"length is same as unrated dir cut so I assume it is that version, and subtitles are not hardcoded."
