,Neverb0rn,2011-09-24T06:14Z,Thanks for the awesome UL Joekkerr. for all who are wondering this game works fine. No crack or patch needed to play sp mode. to play mp u have to have a key. and as for the guy who was asking do you have to unrar all files.. this couldnt be simpler. u just double click the joekkerr app and it extracts for you. game works just fine. awesome game too. you do need a decent system and vid card to play though. Again thanks!
