 SmartKom is a multimodal dialog system that combines speech, gesture, and facial expressions for input and output. Understanding of spontaneous speech is combined with video-based recognition of natural gestures. SmartKom features the situated understanding of possibly imprecise, ambiguous, or incomplete multimodal input and the generation of coordinated, cohesive, and coherent multimodal presentations. SmartKom represents, reasons about, and exploits models of the user, the domain, the task, the context, and the media itself. One of the major scientific goals of SmartKom is to explore and design new computational methods for the seamless integration and mutual disambiguation of multimodal input and output on semantic and pragmatic levels.
