,tannerman,2011-07-15T15:17Z,"this one has cuts all over it.
first cut i noticed was arround the 2 min mark when the goblin should reply something like ""i'm alive""
but it just skips that. god knows what else been cut.

with all those cuts this movie is not complete. "
,kellyangel,2011-07-15T15:49Z,I see you what you mean tannerman it is full of cuts and it would be very disappointing for any one who hasn't seen the film in the cinema as hey wont follow it very well. 
,bonvodka,2011-07-15T16:00Z,why just say thanks instead of complaining.. its free and we're not gonna spend a liitle dime if we download this.. go watch in this in cinema..
,kellyangel,2011-07-15T16:05Z,@bonvodka...I did go and see it in the cinema and just FYI it wasn't a complaint it was simply an observation. 
,raider56,2011-07-15T16:50Z,"@ bonvodka. The only one complaining here is you as far I can see!

@ tannerman. Thanks for the heads up! Now I can make a choise if it's worth it.

And thanks to TvTeam for all the great work you are doing."

,theeGRated,2011-07-16T02:00Z,"ivana2123 fucking surveys dude, nobody wants to check that shit out"
,Magickallife,2011-07-16T03:21Z,"tannerman you posted the same thing on every harry potter part 2 link there is, i think you are full of crap and should just die......"
,billygoat71,2011-07-16T04:49Z,A-8 V-6 It does skip a few scenes. audio goes out of sync but comes right back. You can follow entire movie. If u cant wait this is worth the DL.
,billygoat71,2011-07-16T04:51Z,"Bye the way , the movie is really good."
,Tom_thomas,2011-07-16T08:00Z,"Tannerman ,,,,,, If you don't like the work that TvTeam did , Go to the Movie's and pay your $15.00 .......  Thank's TvTeam ...."
,Green-Banana,2011-07-16T11:33Z,"""Free"" doesn't negate the lack of validity caused by an incomplete file.  ""Free"" does not mean we should betray our integrity.  "
,gauge1971,2011-07-16T12:30Z,"it clearly states in the file information that there are a few seconds missing here and there and there is a scene jump so anyone who dwnlds knows wot they are gettin. 

Why tannerman feels the need to point this out & why green banana questions the credibility of the uploader is beyond me!!!  

Cant you guys read!! TPB doesnt need fools like you on it & those of us that can read appreciate the effort TvTeam & imagine."
,xnakz,2011-07-16T16:33Z,"Qualitys not too bad, its still pretty good and the audio is out of sync near the middle of the movie, probably gonna go watch this tomorrow in cinemas thanks"
,potlum,2011-07-16T21:24Z,Tannerman is a bot. Quit your bitching. Everybody hates a whiner!
,tannerman,2011-07-17T01:42Z,"potlum, fuck you. just leave, fucking troll.

warning. there are 5 (THATS RIGTH. FIVE) minutes of important scenes missing that might ruin the film expereince. i know which scneses because ive seen it at the cinema twice already."
