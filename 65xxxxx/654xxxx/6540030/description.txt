This 15-song set includes more classic doo-wop by talented pros. They open with a harmonic variation of \"Good Ol\' A cappella,\" and along the way there are classic interpretations of \"Morse Code Of Love,\"bad boy song \"The Wanderer,\" and \"What\'s Your Name.\"We really liked how \"La Bamba\" makes a seamless medley with \"Twist and Shout\" - great! And there\'s a hidden track at the end: a contemporary rendition of \"Fly Like An Eagle.\" Great singing on great tunes! (40:16 1998)
