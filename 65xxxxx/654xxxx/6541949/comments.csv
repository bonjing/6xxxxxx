,MAD100007,2011-07-15T09:44Z,Press my name of all my uploads and find MW2 No J-Tag...
,MAD100007,2011-07-15T09:46Z,FOR all my uploads*
,MAD100007,2011-07-16T16:57Z,no J-Tag doesn't work anymore.
,MAD100007,2011-07-16T23:11Z,"Nvm, still works..."
,K1l3rL3x,2011-07-17T01:11Z,Does this really work?
,JSpringer,2011-07-17T01:37Z,is there any way you could do Halo Reach?
,HKw00t,2011-07-17T03:56Z,This is 100% legit if you follow the directions exactly. Ive tested MW2 and Im sure this one will work. Downloading will be done in under an hour
,HKw00t,2011-07-17T04:52Z,Black Ops is legit as well. Nicely done by Bigcmty91. 
,MAD100007,2011-07-17T11:57Z,I'll have a look if I can re-upload Halo Reach. The black ops files cost me 3 days to download from fileserv. Because of that I made this torrent for you guys...
,bball230,2011-07-18T21:38Z,"To anyone who is doing this i would be very careful playing online, especially because you console is not stealthed. 

But still props to MAD100007"
,slayernl,2011-07-19T00:14Z,ey mad100007 can you upload cod waw usb ? and maybe the dlc's for it keep up the good work
,slayernl,2011-07-19T00:18Z,"jow mad10007

,MAD100007,2011-07-20T09:54Z,"This doesn't work for me anymore. I don't know if it's me or the new microsoft update. The profile used to start-up the game is banned from XBL, it was already banned while I uploaded, but there was a way to login on XBL with banned accounts. New update fucked that..."
,2yaaung,2011-07-21T23:41Z,does usb mean that external hard drives will work?
,elkco,2011-07-22T15:37Z,sup will this still work offline 
,MAD100007,2011-07-24T11:24Z,"@2yaaung, yes

@elkco, no. You need XBL to start the game.
"
,leone86,2011-07-25T09:47Z,Sorry but it dont work 
,MAD100007,2011-08-05T10:26Z,"There's a new way to get around the new update:

1. press guide button ...sign in to modded profile ...as soon as the profile picture stats to show up press guide button again to sign in successfully..

2. start the game.. it will tell u to sign it with the profile that has bought the game...

3. IMPORTANT********

select sign in..

but don't select profile..

instead press Y to create new profile.

4. now press guide button again. the pop up window be gone..

5. now press guide button again and sign out of modded profile and sign in to ur own profile....



Thanks to Suvomania"

,MetallicAfan107,2011-08-08T07:59Z,"I've downloaded this torrent and said the file was corrupted, so i redownloaded and says it again. I could inject the profile the first time but not B-OPS. Second time i couldn't inject profile or B-OPS. any help here i'll try it again."
,MAD100007,2011-08-08T14:24Z,"@MetallicAfan107,

Be sure you don't drag 'n drop a folder, but a file in the folders.."
,MetallicAfan107,2011-08-09T04:28Z,I did. i followed the instructions to a T. It worked perfectly fine with COD MW2.
,MetallicAfan107,2011-08-09T08:36Z,Everytime i try to inject the black ops game onto my usb its gets about 90% done and says the files corrupt... :( enjoying MW2 for now but its one of my least favorite call of dutys. oh well can't complain what i didn't pay for. although i actually own both games my disc drive is broken and i gots no money.
,Eddd6969,2011-08-10T04:21Z,"hey mad for me it all it says is ""cant not launch call of duty black ops""  what should i do man???"
,MetallicAfan107,2011-08-10T08:31Z,"Sorry mad. all seem well now. I didn't do anything differently this time, 3rd time i redownloaded and injected. except i inject the game first instead of the profile. Well thanks for both Call of duty games."
,logans123,2011-08-15T09:42Z,Hey MAD100007 i did the thing to my usb (8gb) but the files that it put on my usb were like 7gb so now it wont fit... any suggestions?
,JTsimon,2011-08-17T08:01Z,could u please help it wont launch D:
,MW2crazyOWEN,2011-08-18T08:22Z,Can You Do It With Silver Membership?
,spartan1195,2011-08-22T15:43Z,"@MW2crazyOWEN
yep, log in using the profile supplied, then log out and back in with your silver membership account. Works fine (that what I use)"
,Tony10o,2011-08-28T22:05Z,It says the account is banned and the game says cant start call of duty
,spartan1195,2011-08-28T22:43Z,@Tony10o you need to press the XBOX button just as the profile starts to bypass the ban ;)

,spartan1195,2011-09-05T21:23Z,"just a quick word of caution using non jtags, there LOTS of people getting banned accounts because of these. Use at your own risk ;)"
,KorgFal,2011-09-06T09:50Z,"Ok, quick question.  If I DON'T happen to have an 8gb USB fob, is it possible to run or transfer this file to the 360 over my network or possibly Windows Media Center for instance? Only curious, as I haven't used my 360 online all that much, so I don't know how it behaves on the network...I just see it as listed if I view network on Win 7.  Thanks in advance."
,NewblettLOLZxD,2011-09-14T05:54Z,"Does Anyone Know If There Is A Download EXACTLY LIKE THE CONTENTS OF THIS ONE, except for Dead Rising 2... i tried looking but can find nothing :( please help, and if nothing else, the owner of this torrent, could you make a 360 dead rising 2 torrent with contents like this, place on usb use modded profile, all that jazz ?
