,pirate_teaddy_bear,2011-07-18T04:30Z,"@jester647
another way to express you gratitude would be to keep on seeding"
,xway,2011-07-18T04:33Z,next one plzs
,Jester647,2011-07-18T18:31Z,"Hi everybody. I am not a cop. I am just an ordinary guy. I just wanna help those who are very generous in sharing what they have. Donating is not an obligation.

Anyway, just forget what i said.  "
,fredfan,2011-07-18T19:28Z,"@Jester647:  Yes, public praise and lots of seeding are the best repayments.  If you have excess funds, you can do even better than helping one guy out:  Get a tax deduction even, by donating to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).  It's a legitimate approach to the issues like this that make ""criminals"" of people who create virtual libraries  and need to remind media companies of pre-existing rights that may interfere with their abilities to creatively extend their own profits."

,Blackhaze84,2011-07-19T03:20Z,Hello I was wondering how to get the file onto a DVD.  Do I need to burn it with a program like Nero? Any sort of help would be greatly appreciated!

,mrsjab,2011-07-20T15:14Z,"Seedkey, thank you so much!  It's often so difficult for me to find English subs attached, which I need for various reasons, and I'm actually learning a fair amount of Spanish from turning on the Spanish subs, too!  Thanks again, so much.

@Jester647, what FredFan suggested was a great idea.  The EFF not only lobbies and pursues court challenges on our behalf, they also help fight for us on many additional privacy issues.  If you have some spare cash, it really is an excellent organization to whom to donate.  Their admin:action ratio is pretty good, too, especially for a political NPO."

,Jester647,2011-07-21T14:33Z,"Hi guys. It is me again. I used to be a big fan of djfred and hjsn1. We used to communicate thru his website torrentbucket.com.  I really do not know why their group suddenly disappear.  I really thought that it was due to financial reason.  Here in our country, it is very expensive to buy a new dvd.  I belong to a 3rd world country. I used to make torrents but it was so shameful because all i got was insults from downloaders because my upload speed is only 50kb max.  I cannot afford to subscribe to a higher speed.  So i came up with an idea to support seedkey.  I know you will laugh of how much i can give but it is a start. 

Let us face it, most of the dvdr uploaders aren't using english subtitles. Most are using NL subs.  Seedkey constantly provides movie that fits to my language. 

So seedkey, thanks very very much! I really hope you stay at piratebay.

Thanks everybody! Have a pleasant day."

Thank you."
