Some Artists are a genre of their own. Sting is one of them and a bit more. He performed with several artists and it's a nice experience to hear some of them gathered in an album. The sound quality may be a bit less but is still barproof.

Sharing and seeding may help others. Enjoy and consider buying for true sound quality and support.
