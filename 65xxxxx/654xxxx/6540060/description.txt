2011 release, a collaboration between Irish Pop star and Boyzone member Ronan Keating and legendary composer Burt Bacharach. A long time fan of Burt's staggering back catalog, Ronan is thrilled to be working with one of his all-time musical heroes on this very special collaboration. The Irish superstar first contacted Burt last year; he was ecstatic when the iconic composer and producer agreed for them to work together. Backed by a full orchestra, the result was a spectacular album recorded by the duo earlier this year. All the tracks featured are classics composed by Burt over the course of his impressive 50 year career and include instantly recognizable hits such as Walk On By, The Look Of Love, What The World Needs Now Is Love and I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself. All the tracks were recorded live with a full orchestra, ensuring that the grandeur and stature of these timeless classics was captured and conserved.  (amazon.com)
