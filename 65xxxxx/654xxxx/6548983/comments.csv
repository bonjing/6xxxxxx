you are a illiterate in the field of Islam, so better you shut up because an illiterate person should not speak out in front of educated people."
,abdul33,2011-07-20T23:33Z,"@kimm_23f: No brother one cant say just Muhammad but need to add salutation Peace Be Upon Him(PBUH) every time whenever one says his name or hear his name or whenever indicating him.
One cant even just say any Prophet's name without giving salutation 'peace be upon him'. One cant say just Jesus, Moses, David, Noah, Abraham but need to add salutation after the name 'peace be upon him'.
Peace Be Upon Them All
As Quran says in the verse 33:56.....
""Allah and His Angels send blessings on the Prophet: O ye that believe! Send ye blessings on him, and salute him with all respect."" 

Allah and His angels honor and bless the holy Prophet as the greatest of men. We are asked to honor and bless him all the more because he took upon himself to suffer the sorrows and afflictions of this life in order to guide us to Allah's Mercy and the highest inner Life."
