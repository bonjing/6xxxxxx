,halsingen,2011-07-17T23:38Z,"I'm stuck at 93,5% too :-( Where are the seeders?"
,aftac,2011-07-18T13:01Z,"Is this torrent defective? I occasionally see a seed available, but no one appears to be attaching or receiving anything."
,halsingen,2011-07-19T07:11Z,"@ aftac 
I can see one seeder available too, but everybody seems to be stuck at 93,5%. I love Freedom Watch, but unfortunately it isn't available on television here in Sweden, so I would be very grateful if I could get this show downloaded. Please seed! :-)"
,halsingen,2011-07-20T07:02Z,"Awesome, at last I got the whole thing downloaded :-) Now I will seed like crazy!"
