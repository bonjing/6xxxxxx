Organizations increasingly recognize the urgent importance of effective, cohesive, and efficient security incident response. The speed and effectiveness with which a company can respond to incidents has a direct impact on how devastating an incident is on the companyâ€™s operations and finances. However, few have an experienced, mature incident response (IR) team. Many companies have no IR teams at all; others need help with improving current practices. In this book, leading Cisco incident response expert Damir Rajnovi?c presents start-to-finish guidance for creating and operating effective IR teams and responding to incidents to lessen their impact significantly.

Drawing on his extensive experience identifying and resolving Cisco product security vulnerabilities, the author also covers the entire process of correcting product security vulnerabilities and notifying customers. Throughout, he shows how to build the links across participants and processes that are crucial to an effective and timely response. This book is an indispensable resource for every professional and leader who must maintain the integrity of network operations and productsâ€”from network and security administrators to software engineers, and from product architects to senior security executives.
