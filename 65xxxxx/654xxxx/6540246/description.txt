Part 3. Submarine
In September 1776 a unique event marked the start of a whole new field of warfare: the world's first submarine attack. Designed to place a mine on the hull of a British warship in New York harbour, the submarine would be unrecognisable today. Made of wood, it was shaped like two turtle shells stuck together. So unlikely was its design that many doubt it ever existed. In order to test whether it could have ever achieved its mission, a group of amateur submarine enthusiasts attempt to rebuild the turtle using only the materials and tools available to its original designer.
