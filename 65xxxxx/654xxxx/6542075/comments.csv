,warloot24k,2011-07-30T01:27Z,"klsdfj:

How to install:

First you will need a program called iso.  Get it here in piratebay.  After installing it, you need to install jeppview 3.5 program.  Then, you will need to mount the 2 cds that you will download here, download first cycle 0901 so that the you can activate jeppview 3.5 with the old codes, R00D-KCAB, ( that is romeo-zero-zero-delta ).  Then, after installing 0901, download the latest cycle and just get the code for worldwide. Mount it also and instll."
