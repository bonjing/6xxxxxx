Movie - Mistery / Thriller

Jason meets Penelope at a dinner with mutual friends at his home. Everything begins here. Everything will keep starting from here. They go out, they get to know each other, and at some point Penelope moves in. He can share everything with her. Even that childhood game of trying to control his dreams. Until one morning, when Jason wakes up to find that Penelope has disappeared. He doesnâ€™t know where she has gone, or why she left. He canâ€™t remember what has happened. Are his chronic headaches to blame, or a secret that reaches out from the past and pulls him further and further away from reality? Jason has to find a way to get his memory and his life back. But something keeps getting in the way. Is it the childhood game that has returned? Is it some sort of psychological disorder that threatens him? Or perhaps an inexplicable natural phenomenon, a time warp that pulls him in, deeper and deeper?
