Matter of fact, when I try to rename or move this file, my memory rises from 20% to 98% (gradually) and hogs the system (CPU remains idle @ 1-2%), hard drive constantly reads (DiskMon reports rapid reading, no writing), and I can't even query the properties of this file without it doing the same. Had to delete it, unfortunately."

So, uninstalling DivX doesn't ""fix"" this issue (since I do require DivX for conversions) but it is a workaround for now."
