,tannerman,2011-07-15T20:27Z,"this one has cuts all over it.
first cut i noticed was arround the 2 min mark when the goblin should reply something like ""i'm alive""
but it just skips that. god knows what else been cut.

with all those cuts this movie is not complete.
all releases are 1h 57 min, while it should be 2h 10 min (excluding the credits) "
,Bynx,2011-07-15T22:43Z,Id like to know why Bone has uploaded so many copies and they are all different sizes.
,NanoMan_777,2011-07-16T05:25Z,Thank you for your efforts they are appreciated
,Tom_thomas,2011-07-16T07:51Z,"Thank you - It may have a few cut's , but it is still good for an on line Movie ... For those that are complaning , go to the Theater  and pay your $15.00 .  Good work BONE ..."
,Skibo12,2011-07-16T07:57Z,"bad form Bone, shame on you for this release -this is a copy of another release ...."
,IsoSucks,2011-07-16T15:58Z,"to all you nOObies on this site ,bone is not the group leader .
this torrent came from another site and was uploaded here by bone , that's all ,nothing to cry about but every thing to say thanks for ,"
,IsoSucks,2011-07-16T16:07Z,"@tannerman
you should change that name to spam bot , why , on every torrent you have posted the same thing saying the same thing , all in all you have not downloaded this and are just spamming your way around the net . this must be the 15th torrent you have spammed ,( do you also sell your spam in can's ?)
I thank bone for uploading this to here so we all can download it for free , thnx bone for posting an (IMAGiNE group) release "
,cigaretteburns,2011-07-16T16:10Z,"Tannerman - I am getting REALLY sick of your pointless and incorrect comments on all these HP7 files. This file is 1'56"" and yes the film running time in cinemas is 2'10"". However, the end credits are 11 minutes long so in total only about 2-3 minutes from the film are missing. No ""scenes"" are missing but yes some frames are missing from some shots. Tannerman, please get your facts right before posting shite."
,potlum,2011-07-16T21:12Z,"Tannerman, quit bitching. Bone takes time out of his day to upload shit so u can see it for free. You should be licking Bone's taint hole. Also, dumb is not spelled dumn. Who's the dumb one now?"
,tannerman,2011-07-17T01:36Z,"wow. you guys are just trolls.

the fact that you guys are going mad over someone that is telling ppl what they wanna hear is absurb.

ive actually had more people thanking me for telling them of all the missing minutes in these releases. but there seems to be a few (probably the same guy with multiple accounts here on tpb) that seems to be slandering and humilating me)

just fuck off, IsoSucks, and cigarreteburns.
trolls are not welcome on this site, please just do us a favour and leave"
,delipasa,2011-07-17T12:28Z,"this sample is correct but movie is not!! this is turkish film which name is ""eyvah eyvah 2"" "
,Mordor64,2011-07-17T17:50Z,"I just went to the theater to watch the movie, the cuts that are in this ""russian"" version did not detract from the whole experience (unlike the first versions of Transformers 3).  They are small bits at a time and all the main parts are there.  You really don't even notice that anything is missing (except for the first cut with the goblin).

I want to thank you .BONE. for posting this here!

Quality: There is a little bit of flicker and it is dark at times, but it is watchable (for a CAM).  The few subtitles are in Russian, wish there were English subtitles...

For all you losers out there, when you write  a comment, tell it like it is.  Do NOT tell us what you want us to do!  I can make up my own damn mind - thank you very much!"

""For all you losers out there, when you write a comment, tell it like it is. Do NOT tell us what you want us to do!""

Translation: ""Dear people, do this - do not do this... like I just did.""

Aren't you telling us exactly what you want us to do there? Google the word ""irony"" - maybe have someone explain the whole pot-calling-the-kettle-black thing..? 
Just saying.

Cheers"
,nawitch,2011-07-19T04:42Z,"Too all you whinny Noob's, instead of posting your trivial BS, or false claims of fakes , why don't you just bend over, stick you hand up your ass, and pull your head out of it, that would be far more entertaining to those of us who use this service, than your trivial rantings of immaturity ..

,GraphicalHD,2011-08-15T00:41Z,"Downloaded it, expected good quality for a 1.75gb film, I was disappointed, although I can't expect alot since the film hasn't been released yet.
