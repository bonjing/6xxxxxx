,tmk75,2011-07-23T00:19Z,"I'm sorry I'm being a hater here, but when I see such blatant disregard when claiming to having made a translation, I go like ""WOW"". Once again, wow, the translation seriously sucks, the Swedish subtitle translation look like taken directly from Google Translate, and sometimes the translated words are just plain dumb. What were you thinking? If you can't do a proper translation, then just skip it. I mean, please!"
