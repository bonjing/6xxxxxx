First off yes it's legit, just multipart video in a race to beat out Rudos, TV-Team and a bunch of others to get the first copy up. Don't care what the quality is, webripz aint supposed to be the best copy and i pulled them off streaming websites. Just had to put this out cuz like the best match of the years in here :P and thats it for spoilers.
