Release Title: Primal Fear 1996 1080p BDRip H264 AC3-GreatMagician (Kingdom-Release)
Directed By: Gregory Hoblit
Tagline: An arrogant, high-powered attorney takes on the case of a poor altar boy found running
away from the scene of the grisly murder of the bishop who has taken him in. The case
gets a lot more complex when the accused reveals that there may or may not have been
a 3rd person in the room. The intensity builds when a surprise twist alters everyone's
perception of the crime and what happens next...
