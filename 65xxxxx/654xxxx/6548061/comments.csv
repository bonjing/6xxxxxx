,Breemanssam,2011-07-18T11:41Z,What's that subtitle shit? It's REALLY annoying!
,dlectro,2011-07-18T12:30Z,"@Breemanssam
There are non-native viewers.
And i don't see why subs annoy you, they can easily be disabled."

I agree - sub-titles are very annoying. At least they are mentioned in the description of this version of the torrent. Presumably they are there for the 0.5% of the population who are deaf."
,Johnny24071982,2011-07-18T21:10Z,"QUALITY IS GOOD, BUT IT HAS MOMENTS OF STUTTERING AND EVENTUALLY STOPS JUST BEFORE THEY DO THE NEWS, VERY IRRITATING. RATHER GO FOR EZTV'S VERSION MORE RELIABLE THAN THIS FAGGOT'S VERSION!!!!!!"

In the world there are 300-400 million people speaking english as first language. Maybe some of the other 6,5 BILLION find the subtitles helpful. So don't be an idiot about it..."
,dlectro,2011-07-19T10:34Z,"@F110
Not hard-coded subs, so what are you clamoring about?"
,donDjango,2011-07-19T15:39Z,@peekowang What ads? lulz..
,RareNinja,2011-07-23T11:23Z,"vlc is saying subs are off but are still on, wm player, bsplayer, nero player all say the same as well......  which means hardcoded"
,johnnyq007,2011-08-02T11:01Z,Can you make a crack por Pro Cycling Manager 2011 please?
