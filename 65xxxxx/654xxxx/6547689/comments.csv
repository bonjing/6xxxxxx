it's a bit boring but nothing beats the feeling of getting one of those giant trains moving"

Do you mean it looks fake? This is an OSX version that I wrapped up in a Wineskin. It runs well on 10.6, with minimal graphical issues. It's the latest version. Don't try to run it on a Windows machine; that would work, but it would be a pain. There are other torrents for that."
,jonah_the_bear,2011-07-25T12:02Z,im just asking for a newer train sim one that looks abit better then this 2001 version perhaps 'trainz'?
