,aarque,2011-07-16T15:19Z,"Nice, but it is possible to install all the Blueprint sceneries - and any .msi - into x64 operating systems using command prompt (the ""run"" program). This was copied from one of the hits of a quick search:

'Nevermind I managed to install the file using the command prompt (elevated).

Funny thing was it would only install when using the /qb command, but at
least I got it installed.

If anyone else is having this problem, then I'll tell you what I did.

1. ran Command Prompt as administrator
2. changed the directory it was looking at to where the msi file was. eg:
""cd /Users/blah/Desktop""
3. ran msiexec. eg: ""msiexec i\ someprogram.msi \qb""
4. wait.

That was it.'

Even if you don't want to seed your torrent, just leave it up so everyone can see this trick."
,thesaguaro1,2011-07-16T18:37Z,How do you extract the .msi file from the .exe file?

,aarque,2011-07-16T22:58Z,thesaguaro is too stupid to be allowed to fly. Try actually reading other comments before you post a question that was answered before you asked!
,thesaguaro1,2011-07-17T17:22Z,"Well, immature 12 year old, show me where any comments discussed the use of an .exe file rather than a .msi file."
,aarque,2011-07-18T14:24Z,"Well immature 40 year old, there are no comments that discuss exe's, there are no exe's to be extracted! You do know that ""exe"" stands for ""executable"" while ""msi"" stands for ""Microsoft self-installer,"" correct? If you don't use Win7 or Vista, you don't even need to be here.
Are you one of those whining ""feed me"" leechers that never uploads everything, never learns anything and expects to be hand fed.

All jocaruci has done - at his own expense and effort - is to perform the extraction that the .msi would have done. It is still up to the user to drop the files within the proper hierarchy of the FSX installation. Even a 12 year old could do it, but I'm guessing you can't.
 Here is your clue: Google."
