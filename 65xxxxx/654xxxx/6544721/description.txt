Booker T. Jones

The Memphis-born Booker T. Jones was honored with induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and a Grammy lifetime achievement award for his genre-defining Hammond B-3 organ work with the renowned Stax Records group Booker T and the MGs alongside guitarist Steve Cropper, bassist Donald â€œDuckâ€ Dun and Al Jackson Jr. His new solo album, The Road from Memphis, which was released in May on Anti- Records, features cameos by Lou Reed, My Morning Jacketâ€™s Jim James and Sharon Jones. The L.A. Times said, â€œJones makes a quietly convincing case that when it comes to soul music, all roads do seem to lead to Memphis.â€ Booker T., who has collaborated with a whoâ€™s-who of popular music greats, including Ray Charles, Otis Redding, Bill Withers, Rufus Thomas, Carla Thomas, Neil Young, Stephen Stills and Willie Nelson, among many others, had a blast playing with Daryl on the show.

â€œOne of the nicest things about performing on Live from Daryl's House is that Daryl has surrounded himself with musicians who can 'hear,â€™â€ enthused Booker T. â€œThat is, each one has talent to the extent of being capable of performing as a soloist on his own, not needing to be told the proper notes to sing or play.â€
