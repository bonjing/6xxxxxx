Notes:
This is the complete concert with all between-song talking included. It's NOT just about the music, folks. Her message is also important and should be disseminated widely.
After watching this show, I stand by my conviction that Gaga is the Alice Cooper of the 2010's. Rock 'n' roll is rock 'n' roll, but SPECTACLE is SPECTACLE. Alice understood this perfectly and Lady Gaga does, too.


And, as always, TRADE FREELY AND NEVER SELL!!!
