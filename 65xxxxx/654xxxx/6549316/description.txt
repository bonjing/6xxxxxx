    When a publicity stunt of two models on a boat goes horribly wrong       
    and the two get lost in a fog. They end up on a creaky floating tomb     
    of the blind dead. That's right, these sea going Templars make short     
    work of the Supermodels and move along. The head of the modeling         
    agency and a group of employees start looking for the babes and too      
    meet the Templars Pirates. But can they escape the fate of the models    
    or will they too succumb to the monsters of the deep?
