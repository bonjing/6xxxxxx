Synopsis   [?]: MixMeister software isn't quite like anything else on the market. 
It's designed for people who care enough about their music to refine a mix until 
itâ€™s perfect, rather than throw everything together on the fly and hope that it 
sounds OK. You won't be limited by on-screen simulations of turntables or CD 
players, either -- you can "tweak" any part of your mix creation in a timeline 
instead. When you've got the mix just the way you want it, you can play it, burn
it to CD, stream it over the Web, or reshape it in real-time for live 
performances.

[Optional]
GEAR Driver: used for CD burning capabilities. There are much better 
alternatives that are free & stealth like "ImgBurn". But if you insist, GEAR
is included as a separate install.

[Note]
Kaspersky Anti-Virus falsely identifies as "Keylogger" because MixMeister
uses hotkeys.
