,senseinai,2011-07-17T20:10Z,"I might be missing something here ... comes with a serial number, but that has to be validated online???"
,bikervet,2011-07-17T23:44Z,"I also can't use the serial, as it keeps asking me to register online."
[V],polisdavid,2011-07-18T03:54Z,Use the Sn to unlock the product - if it asks you to register then say no - and close the window

,zogulusnig,2011-07-24T01:40Z,"When you input the serial provided, it checks against the Panic servers and returns a ""pirated serial number"" warning.

If you block this attempt using Little Snitch, the product just fails to register and remains permanently in ""trial"" mode.

So, basically, unless you have some other instructions or trick up your sleeve, this torrent is no more useful than downloading the trial of this app from Panic itself (actually, that would be better, as the latest version is 4.1.7).

This torrent does NOT allow the app to be ""unlocked"" in any fashion.  Thanks for the share, but I can get my trials directly from the developer.

At the same time, I would LOVE it if you had the aforementioned trick up your sleeve, and would share that here. ;)"
