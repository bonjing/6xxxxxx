I almost would forget that Helena Espvall is from Swedish origin, something this release suddenly brings to focus. 

It is as if she readapts and retains her roots for it with a Swedish traditional folk song based album with some additional, mostly totally instrumental improvisations, in cooperation with Masaki Batoh, who in his turn is more known for his long time participation in the most important Japanese and mostly folkpsych band Ghost, besides he also had some solo release(s). 

As a duo now, they succeed very well to bring forward the magic of Swedish folk songs, better than I have heard in a very long time, even when remembering some of the better Swedish 60s/70s folk items, which often keep the traditions a bit too limited in expressive range, something which does not happen here. And this expression includes even the older medieval flavours. It is very much done with an acid folk strength. 

Instruments like cello, acoustic and electric guitars but also santur, tympani, and lesser known string instruments reveals the magic in the songs, beside Helenaâ€™s sweet singing fits with this approach very beautifully. Also Masaki Batoh sings twice, and in duet. 

The last track, the longest improvisation, includes also more percussive instruments and features a few other members from Ghost.
