Witch Hunter's Bible
The spellbinding special, Witch Hunter's Bible exposes how our ancestors used a detailed instruction manual to find, and dispose of, suspected witches. The Malleus Maleficarum, also known as the Hammer of Witches, dramatically influenced the public's view of witchcraft. Written back in 1486, this infamous medieval guidebook added intellectual and religious weight to the argument that witches were real and should be put to death. Delving into the eerie, ancient world of witch-hunting, for the first time, an international team of scholars and investigators takes an in-depth look at this terrifying book, to reveal the shocking methods once used in an attempt to rid society of a perceived threat. No stone is left unturned as we set out to unveil the outrageous truth behind one of the most infamous publications ever written.
