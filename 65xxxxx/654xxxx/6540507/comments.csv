,banikan,2011-07-21T01:10Z,"if this serial should expire, is there anyway to ""crack"" Little Snitch so it still works? Perhaps preventing one of the Little Snitch files from getting a internet connection using Little Snitch? I don't know."

1st serial works fine , for the moment.

Thank you"
,liger87,2011-08-02T11:55Z,FYI Little Snitch 2.4.0 has known issues with Lion that could cause a kernel panic. Little Snitch 2.4.1 addresses Lion compatibility issues but cannot find it on any torrent site.
,sabdi,2011-08-06T18:04Z,can sm1 plz tell if this passes th 3 day test? :////
,_frosty,2011-08-07T10:26Z,"if you had a working copy b4 lion, download upgrade from LS site and update.  should work flawlessly and won't even ask for new password.  Keeping in mind that you previously had a working copy with valid serial. enjoy."
,dogmaster88,2011-08-10T06:49Z,"@nobody2007 the Serial # expired in 3 days....

""http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5131516/Little_Snitch_2.2_[Don__t_Expire]""... have made it past 4 days mark without expiry notice."
,mkram0,2011-09-05T12:05Z,"To block Little Snitch from connecting, I suggest blocking it at your DNS provider.. I Use OpenDNS. Just hoping it will pass the 3 days without telling me it is invalid."
