Team Fortress 2 is a free-to-play team-based first-person shooter multiplayer video game developed by Valve Corporation. A sequel to the original mod Team Fortress based on the Quake engine, it was first released as part of the video game compilation The Orange Box on October 10, 2007 for Windows and the Xbox 360. 

Like its predecessors, Team Fortress 2 is focused around two opposing teams competing for a principal objective.
