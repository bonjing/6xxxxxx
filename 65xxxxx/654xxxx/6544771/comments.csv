,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-07-17T09:44Z,Psycho could you PLEASE re-upload Walk the line in mp4 format and a smaller file size (around 3 gig)? You'd be my hero :)
,jaded3825,2011-07-20T16:27Z,"i have burned it to dvd....good a/v quality. looking forward to your future releases. any idea when you will release ""district 9"" and ""the jacket""? thx again."
,The-Blob,2011-08-02T02:27Z,"EXCELLENT quality! The sound is great too, although it was really quiet. I played it on several computers and the audio was a bit too quiet. But other then that, GREAT release, probably one of the best.

Oh and the download speed was fast too. Thanks man :)"
,PsychoLogic,2011-08-02T12:18Z,"If the audio is too quiet try using a player which will boost or normalize it. It's the original level DTS transcoded to AC3 in this release. Playing it through my AV receiver at ~ -40dB is quite loud :)

xxxchromaticxxx, I've tried converting a couple of my releases to .mp4 but the muxer hates me. If you want .mp4 releases in good quality my advice is to learn MeGUI and transcode from BluRay releases (pretty much what I do for these). I really don't have the time or bandwidth to be doing two releases."
