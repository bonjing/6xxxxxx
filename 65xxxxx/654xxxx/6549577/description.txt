I have to say this is one of the stronger movies of the franchise - true, it's no great work of art, but then it shows that Pokemon can keep churning these out without the quality diminishing.

Plus, Lucario is hot. This film makes furrys.


Japanese or English audio, soft subs in English plus a couple of other languages. Good quality, for a non-HD movie.
