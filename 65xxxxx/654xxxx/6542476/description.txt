This torrent contains character themes from Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition

ripped from game files; remastered and encoded with Sony Vegas 10 in WMA 10 Pro

format; settings used: VBR Quality 98, 44kHz, 5.1 channel 16bit (~480kbps);

This does NOT sound good on stereo speaker setup, it\'s remastered specifically for

5,1 sound systems (works ok with 4ch too); I did not include stage themes simply

because they were not recorded in surround




Ripped and remastered by Soda-88
