                Motoring show. Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and
                James May attempt to make train travel cheaper,
                faster and more interesting by replacing the
                conventional carriages and locomotive with a series
                of caravans attached to a specially modified car.
                Also in this show, Jeremy is out on the track
                comparing the ripsnorting Jaguar XKR-S to the
                recently updated Nissan GT-R, while British comedy
                legend Rowan Atkinson is the star in the Reasonably
                Priced Car.
