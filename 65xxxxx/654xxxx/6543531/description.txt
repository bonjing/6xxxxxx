At the riverside of Rio Tiete, in SÃ£o Paulo, prostitutes, a pimp, a retarded man, a handicap, people in the margin of the society live their hopeless lives waiting for the boat of hell.

Ozualdo Ribeiro Candeias was a Brazilian director with a humble origin and great identification with the excluded of the society. His debut behind the camera was with this movie, worshiped by students and professionals of cinema due to the unique cinematographic aesthetic. This film was produced in a period of the wave of the Brazilian "Cinema Novo", and Candeias made a revolutionary timeless story without chronology, full of ellipsis, very few dialogs and bizarre characters and situations, as a form of art and not political instrument. Although being original, I personally found "A Margem" pointless, weird and boring.
