Aright, here you go! CosplayDeviants.com's content ripped and organized, enjoy!

I'm sorry about the set titles, they don't specify which series and characters each set is based on, and I can't recognise the majority of them. The titles they use in lieu of something meaningful might give some indication of the content (trainer == pokemon, flower girl == final fantasy 7, for example), also check out the girls.jpg and guys.jpg files, as they contain their respective sets' thumbnails.

Oh, by the way, if you are feeling generous and want to contribute something back, I will gladly accept donations in BitCoin form, I will use donations to continue the subscription and to rip any new sets. Send BitCoins to: 1F7hBLSR5zNMQETS9nnZhJyzML9y3WYhhw
