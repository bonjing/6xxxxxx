,RileyFinn,2011-07-17T08:52Z,I'll download this and give feedback for other users. I know a lot of people want this movie.
,RileyFinn,2011-07-17T11:16Z,"Review: The image quality is rather good, although my knowledge of these things are limited, I would say this is excellent compared to other movies that just look horrible. The sound is clear too, so well done. However, it's run time is 1hour 56 minutes, when its suppose to be 2hours and 10 mins minus the credits. So guys, to let you know some parts have been cut. TBH Im only watching it because im impatient, I will eventually go to the theatres anyway and watch it in full. Overall, very good. Downloaded quite fast aswell, I'll seed for a while :)"
,ChasUGC,2011-07-17T12:49Z,"@RileyFinn-Thanks for the info
@ExtraTorrentRG-Thanks for the continued torrent support."
,rcr29budcar,2011-07-17T14:10Z,"Thanx Riley, good honest review. Appreciated very much."
,calicojax,2011-07-17T15:21Z,"why is it that all of the versions of this movie are at 1:56 to 1:58? like could whoever was filming it, just not sit through the extra ten minutes or something?? ive been dying to see this movie, and im broke soooo i guess im gonna watch it and pretend there arent missing parts least until something full comes out. "
,ky100,2011-07-17T15:25Z,can anyone please tell me the a/v and does this one flash like all the others 
,spen007,2011-07-17T16:10Z,Thank you!
,frailwordscollapse,2011-07-17T17:15Z,"lol I can't wait for the next hour of this movie to come up, in other words 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 3'"
,doctorsgirl,2011-07-17T22:04Z,"I don't know why everyone's complaining about the length being only 1:56/1:58; of the versions I've downloaded, the only things missing at that length are the recap before the WB logo flythrough and the end credits, so NBD. I was at the midnight showing, and I haven't noticed any scenes missing, even with all the supposed ""cuts"". If it's really bugging you, then go see it in the theaters. If not, then this should tide you over until the DVD comes out. Happy watching!"
,xkdira,2011-07-17T23:15Z,im downloading now. gonna watch in theaters again and again but need something to watch while in line...
,gazza2009,2011-07-18T00:19Z,so harry potter gets the most powerfull wand in the world which could make him invincible.... and what does he do..... snaps it in half asap and throws it away?  what a twat!

,elanciano,2011-07-18T00:47Z,"@gazza2009 
thanks for spoiling it for me"
,dawgy62,2011-07-18T03:57Z,"Quality people!!!
come on
V=?
A=?"
,wayneking,2011-07-18T07:27Z,"an OK cam, especially considering how new the film is.

Video is about average for a cam, sound is beter than average.  A couple of very minor sync' issues at points in the movie, but these really are minor and will not bother anyone looking to watch a cam version on thhe weekend of inital release.  It's a fast DL too.

Thanks very much to the uploader."
,potraider420,2011-07-18T11:30Z,Cinivia protected!! not for ps3 users
,wimpieman,2011-07-18T14:43Z,"its a very watcheble cam

a 7(for a cam)
v 9"
,WhiskeyKid,2011-07-18T18:10Z,"No dice on my audio.  Tried several players to no avail.  Video's OK for cam, but until I figure out this audio situation the torrent's unusable.  =("
,corndog123,2011-07-19T00:41Z,"it's watchable, the sound is ok, looks like the same copy as the 1.4 gb file, there are a few cuts in it but it looks like they had audio sync problems that were edited out hence the cuts, overall if you really like the series and want quality then wait but if you just want to see the flick and don't have a gf or kids to take to the cinema then this is for you!!"
,zethaaron,2011-07-19T04:16Z,"@calicojax that's the length of the movie, it's only 2:10 including credits, trust me i was at the first showing in my city. :p"
,zethaaron,2011-07-19T04:23Z,"Also, of any copies ive son on TPB there is some cuts, but its little things like when they say to the goblin how are you, and he says im alive, the im alive isn't in the copies ive seen, all in all its like 2-4 minutes cut out, if you have OCD like me, wait. :P if not, trust me its not 10 minutes cut, 5 at most, i saw it in theatres "
,ChasUGC,2011-07-19T13:22Z,"This upload was very watchful. Very easy to follow. A=6+,V=6. The story is absolutely ""brilliant"", and a beautiful ending to a awesome series. I can't wait for the DVD version just to watch it again. Heck, I may even buy the series."
,SigPwnUuuu,2011-07-19T16:07Z,Are their any subs for this?
,ChasUGC,2011-07-20T07:22Z,"There is a site for subtitles. I've searched  for  subtitles in google, and downloaded the  referencing torrent and add the subtitle file to the  torrent download and burn it. It has worked everytime for me. Good Luck."
,moviemansteve,2011-07-20T15:25Z,is there a copy i can get thats not cinevia protected so i can watch it on my p.s. 3??
,hpfan1,2011-07-20T20:46Z,A&V's?? someone! running time as well
,hpfan1,2011-07-20T20:47Z,"oh shit, saw the running time everybody! just give me a proper A&V"
,hpfan1,2011-07-20T20:48Z,BTW can someone do a HD-camed film?
,dj-test,2011-07-20T21:53Z,"Running time 1:56:50

I don't think anything is cut, because there's easily 14 mins of credits.

V7/A9 (for a cam or TS or whatever this is). It's definitely watchable, even the very dark scenes are watchable."
,horror7,2011-07-20T22:19Z,Very good torrent and good movie! I'll b seeding for a week! 
,dawgy62,2011-07-21T05:48Z,"A=8
V=6-7     Only coz its early and not bad if you want a cheap o watch(meaning you cant wait). If you have VLC just muck around with contrast and brightness. Still I saw it in theater and well worth it. Best one out of the lot in my opinion.

As to our Russian friends which do most of the work when it comes to early release-cams and TS please keep it up guys. It is appreciated"
,dawgy62,2011-07-21T05:54Z,"One more thing, I have seen the movie and anything that was cut out of it does not affect the story. Nothing missing but credits as far as I can see. Nice work ExtraTorrentRG your skull is well deserved"
,firefly2002,2011-07-21T16:28Z,Great quality... probably the best I've ever seen from a cam. I'm impressed and grateful! =)
,sakechan4ya,2011-07-22T23:44Z,Thanks very watchable cam...I attended the midnight showing as well and the quality for this is pretty good! I'm just dl to watch it till I have the funds to see it again with other friends! thanks will seed! 
,vipernickle99,2011-07-23T04:49Z,thanks for the upload
,CDLX5342,2011-07-23T12:38Z,"cool mate, thanks VM! would have been nice to see the quality with a preview clip before downloading, but Im going to trust the good reviews and hope for the best! :P thanks again bud"
,htcpD,2011-07-30T14:44Z,The torrent is very good for a cam (a=9 v=8) but in my opinion the movie was just terrible... Thanks anyway.
,Henry1996,2011-07-31T06:28Z,what can u play it on i tried windows media player and a couple others but they didnt work??
,tiger_o,2011-08-02T08:37Z,@Henry1996: Try VLC....
,spen_66,2011-08-02T11:37Z,"Ya its very nice link. Working 100%. while cming to quality
A - 7
V- 5-6 Its worth downloading. Nice torrent. Tks for this nice upload. Keep up gud work....!!!!! "
,SmileFIN,2011-08-03T02:13Z,pls seed
,SmileFIN,2011-08-03T16:08Z,"ty, audio bit laggy but otherwise good and very watchable. movie itself is good too ^^"
,RaiBok,2011-08-14T01:03Z,"Nope, there are def some cuts. For example in the room with the elf in the beginning, harry potter just suddenly appears at the window? and the dragon-scene is longer. i have seen the movie at theaters btw.
oh and, A/V are VERY good for being a cam. worth watching if you are poor and can't go to the theaters. although i recommend going to the theaters!"
,Diazafan,2011-08-19T00:45Z,THIS IS OF A TERRIBLE QUALITY AND IS COMPLETELY UNWATCHABLE. DON'T WASTE YOUR BANDWIDTH OR YOUR TIME
,windsorighteous,2011-09-01T04:28Z,"awsome quality, thanks man.
if i put my bandwith allocation on high, does that help with seeding too? like would other people be able to download it faster or somthing? "
,2dlamb,2011-09-01T19:47Z,"thanks. downloading and will compare to the ""Unknown"" upload"
,2dlamb,2011-09-01T20:52Z,the two versions are very similar if not exactly the same recording. just a heads up
,Tetriana,2011-09-09T19:21Z,"This was fine until I got to around the 49 minute mark where the audio goes out of sync.

Don't waste your time. :("
,colonelgork,2011-09-20T21:58Z,"This is being monitored by Warner Brothers. I just got an email from Cox that I was gonna get raped by WB if I didn't cut the shit. If you don't have PeerBlock running, I recommend that you PAUSE your activities and GET IT INSTALLED NOW."
,sylviamahmoud,2011-09-21T13:06Z,the quality is cam rip the sound is not bad. watchable but not DVD. but thanks.
,lacus.pril,2011-10-11T03:17Z,when you will upload the dvdrip?t.y.
