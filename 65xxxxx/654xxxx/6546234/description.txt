When his billionaire adoptive father is murdered, a young adventurer inherits control of the deceased man's worldwide business empire -- and his enemies.  Together with his best friend Simon Ovronnaz, the Russian computer hacker Kerensky, his father's lawyer John Sullivan, and his attractive head of security Joy Arden, Largo goes on a hunt for the international cabal responsible for his father's death, and plunges into a vortex of action and romance.  Bullets fly and heads roll in this spectacular Canadian/French action series, based on the novels and the highly successful comic book adaptations by Belgians Philippe Francq and Jean Van Hamme.

In this episode, while Largo is entertaining a pretty lawyer late at night, the Group W Building is invaded by a Latin American guerrilla leader and his men, accusing Largo of financing the corrupt government of his country.  A "Die Hard" scenario ensues, but there are twists.
