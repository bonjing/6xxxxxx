WindDisk is a disk mounter, which mounts ISO, IMG, DMG, and others with a right click and a select.

How to use:
Open:
Install for XP.bat if you are on XP
Install for Vista and 7.bat if you are on Windows Vista or 7

The temp-files.vbs, it executes a script to install the program, so its not a virus.

It says it detects as a virus in some programs as Hosts, Trojan.Win32.Qhost!IK, Trojan.Win32.Qhost, but its not, 

IT IS NOT A VIRUS

Thanks.
I Hope I provide a Virus-free solution to Mounting Disk Images.
