,Sladen88,2011-07-30T02:16Z,"Hey Tunt3maton, do you have to have an actual radio with dongle to use the 360 controller or can you just use the 360 controller without having an actual radio with dongle. I really wanna start flying but i only have the 360 controller and keep getting the usb not detected message. I did everything to the letter.PLLLSS HELP :/"
,Sladen88,2011-07-30T02:52Z,"Also, im using a wireless controller with receiver. not sure if that makes a difference "
,arisarts,2011-09-25T21:01Z,"It works if you add a simple PC joystick.

The problem is that I can not make it work with the interlink Usb controller (Realflight)

Can someone help?

Thanks"
,jp1357,2011-10-21T00:32Z,"Works fantastic with an additional usb joystick
Thanks mate"
,RodWall5,2011-11-17T23:03Z,"I was having the same problem as you, usb device not connected.

Just run the 'launcher.exe' in compatibility mode for Windows XP SP3. It has worked for me.

Windows 7 Ultimate 64bits"
,algarci052,2011-12-10T18:18Z,"Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!!!!!!! Works perfect!!! I thought I will never have this simulator until I found this fantastic website :-D This is the best airplane rc simulator, I love it. Thank you lots of times!!! :-D"
,algarci052,2011-12-11T01:55Z,"Since I installed this simulator yesterday, I advised that I can't upgrade beyond 3.0p version and cannot download new rc models like cessna 182 either. However, today I discovered by chance the solution to this problem at least in windows vista O.S.: You have to execute the simulator with administrator privileges. Try it! If you execute this as a administrator you will be able to update the simulator and download new rc models. Thanks & Greetings!!!"

,needa,2012-03-25T09:11Z,"this torrent works great. i have installed it on two xp machines and one win7x64 and using the fs-ct6b 6ch  transmitter. 

i am however... getting no sound out of either xp machine. anyone know whats wrong?

for those that have not done any homework yet... you need ppjoy to use your transmitter or xbox controller. to install ppjpoy on win 7 machine.... you must go into settings and turn off (down) cert signing or whatever its called. google it. you will also need t6sim if you are using a 6ch tx. the instructions on the whole process is in the read me of t6sim. games (right side)>tools>input devices>joystick.

,marcelommt,2012-04-01T01:56Z,"Man, I owe you a beer! Realy realy thank you!!!! My Dynam usb control works just perfect. You are the guy..."
,piwikiwi,2012-04-10T19:32Z,"This is THE simulator for everyone that doesn't want to buy an expensive controller OR a cable for their regular transmitter. 

This is SO much nicer than RealFlight 4.5 and works great on win7 with a cheapo ESky USB controller.

Thanks, man!"
,piwikiwi,2012-04-11T20:00Z,"@ Tunt3Maton:
How do you stop the update BEFORE it gets to 3.0s?

I believe it downloads all updates if you let it update."
,piwikiwi,2012-04-11T20:09Z,"Answering my own question: update from the Phoenix website, the updates are selectable seperately :-)"
,piratebayfan22,2012-06-03T00:24Z,"My instructions for Xbox 360 Wireless Instructions for Windows 7: 

Unplug all other Joysticks first to make selecting the Xbox 360 Controller easier. 

Click Windows Button: Devices and Printers
Right Click Xbox 360 Wireless Controller Icon
Select Game Controller Settings
Click Advanced Button
Advance Settings Popup Window will be 
""Select Device you want to use with older programs"" 
Choose ""Controller (Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows)"" 
Click Ok

Open Phoenix Installation folder, be sure launcher.exe and phnxdll.dll are there. 
Open Launcher.exe
Select the only joystick entry
Click Run Phoenix

The Xbox 360 mapping profile that is included with this torrent sucks. 
(Click System Menu Option) Select Setup New Transmitter
Go through the setup procedures
After that got to ""Your Controls"" still in the system menu option. 
Create New
The way I have mine setup, which is very much the same as my DX5e. 
Engine: Controller Channel 2
(Check Invert Box, Choose Curve, and then flatten the line to the middle line, and then it will spike. This makes it so left stick at neutral throttle is idle.)
Elevator: Channel 6
Aileron: Channel 4
Rudder: Channel 1
(This config, makes transition to a RF RC fixed wing controller very easy).
