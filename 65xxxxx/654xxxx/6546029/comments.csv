,L3GiTPro,2011-07-17T20:51Z,"@rza3rdwrld

When someone puts 720p in the title, it means that the source was 720p.  I could of made it become 1280x720 if I wanted to include the black bars on the bottom and top but that is just stupid.  Just think of it this way.  People put BluRay in the title but when you download it, it is not BluRay, it was just what the source was.  The same goes for the Resolution.  What you think 536p is, it is still HD, it is just not the 16:9 Aspect Ratio."

,L3GiTPro,2011-07-20T10:58Z,"@megaterrythomas Take it easy.  I don't want anything like that posted on my torrents.  There is really no official size for HD.  If there was then what would 4K be called?  Uber HD?  I just told rza3rdwrld that this is HD, but not 720p and that the source was 720p.

People learn new things everyday and you can't get mad at them if they are wrong about something.  It is not their fault."

,osman2510,2011-07-20T15:28Z," wtf i am sick of those comments
its maybe not hd, but its at least dvd hq, however its a great quality, and it is not ts or cam"
,L3GiTPro,2011-07-20T19:06Z,"No problem.  Glad you like it.  And this is HD.  It is from an HD Source.  It is just compressed really well with good settings.  Like you see in most other releases they use a bitrate which is used for a specific size that they want, and most people will always go for bigger files because they think that it is better quality but when they do, depending on what their raterole is, in high motion scenes that bitrate will still be used cause lower quality for that part.  I use a method that targets a certain quality so it uses the needed bitrate for specific scenes.  For low motion scenes such as just talking and stuff like that, the bitrate will be low.  But in high motion scenes such as explosions and stuff, there would be a higher bitrate.  You can tell if you look at the specs of this video that I posted in the description.  The regular bitrate was 2487Kbps and the max was 15.9Mbps."
,mokupuni,2011-07-21T09:46Z,Thank you so much L3GiT! Excellent share. 
,L3GiTPro,2011-07-21T22:16Z,No Problem.
,Muianescu,2011-07-22T18:04Z,"Thanks for the upload perfect quality and for those not believing what the nature of HD is: High definiton, not important the resolution in pixel measurement both vertical and horizontal, more important is the resolution as for the printer, the number of pixels used to create an image. You can have an image 1920x1080 far worse than one at 1280x720 or 560, etc. And with the oustanding quality of the latest digital cameras using for recording those movies, it is more important a good codec that the final ratio in inches, cm, or pixels!"
