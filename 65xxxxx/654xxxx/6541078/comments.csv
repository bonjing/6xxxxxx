Still i appreciate the upload."
,ninjanutta,2011-07-15T11:33Z,"alien breed and serious sam 1/2 are not free,they are drm free"
,DeMoGoGoN,2011-07-15T13:05Z,"As stated by ninjanutta, SS, and Alien Breed, are from a games disk.  Worms is also not an original free one.

The reason I posted these here, is because not all of them are still available as free downloads."
,HKw00t,2011-07-17T04:01Z,"""Could this get you banned?"" is the only question here."
,DeMoGoGoN,2011-07-18T17:45Z,"As the games are either free, or DRM free, its unlikely you will get banned.

However, I will point out that by using ANY copied software, there is always a slight risk.

I havent been banned, and Ive been using them for over a month."
,maciel666,2011-07-28T18:37Z,Some of these games are trial
