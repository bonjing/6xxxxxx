,Pljesnivi,2011-08-12T09:38Z,Doesn't work for me :(
,Pljesnivi,2011-08-12T10:40Z,"I made it work. This is what i did.

I have Steam installed an my PC, so there i found demo of the game and installed it. During isntalation it instaled the newest Directx, Microsoft .NET Framework and another Miscrosoft XNS Framework (dunno if its XNS - something like that).
After that the Steam Demo didn't work, but the full torrent version did :). So the game probably needs this Frameworks to run or something like that. :)

Love the game!!!"
