                               The Complete Series


Chaos is an American television series for the CBS network.

Threats to national security are investigated by a group of rogue CIA spies in the division of Clandestine Homeland Administration and Oversight Services (CHAOS), also trying to keep their jobs from being eliminated due to budget cuts. New agent Rick Martinez (Freddy Rodriguez) joins the team as an in-house mole for CIA National Clandestine Service Director H.J. Higgins (Kurtwood Smith). However, Martinez is quickly found out by the ODS (Office of Disruptive Services) team, who "turn" him for their own use.
