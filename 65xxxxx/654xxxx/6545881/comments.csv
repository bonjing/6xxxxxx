"

,jjaworsk,2011-07-22T05:45Z,"@vanimox the spammer

If you follow the link, you HAVE TO GET a  MegaLoad Premium Account, perhaps giving vanimox a spammer bonus.

Far cheaper to get direct from Apple than paying this spammer."
,phlacke,2011-07-24T19:24Z,"$29 is damn cheap. I've put it before it was released, and I have to install pirate copy because there is no way to buy here in my country. No AppStore, no Apple store, just some resellers that they burn the dvd and give it to you. If you can, its worth to buy it. "
,phlacke,2011-07-25T15:15Z,I recommend this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6553120/Mac_OS_X_Lion_%28Mac_App_Store%29
