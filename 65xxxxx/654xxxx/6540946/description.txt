One of the greatest myths ever told in Caribbean historiography is that the indigenous peoples who encountered a very lost Christopher Columbus are â€œextinct.â€

This book debunks that myth through the uncovering of historical, ethnographical, and census data. The author reveals extensive narratives of JÐ½baro Indian resistance and cultural continuity on the island of BorikÐ¹n.

Since the epistemological boundaries of the early history and literature had been written through colonial eyes, key fallacies have been passed down for centuries. Many stories have been kept within family histories having gone â€œundergroundâ€ as the result of an abusive past. Whole communities of JÐ½baro people survive today.
