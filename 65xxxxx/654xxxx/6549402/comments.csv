,ConeBone,2011-07-18T23:10Z,"Thanks WDM.. I'm a regular on your site, but ever since u added a ""log in"" to get into the vault, I cannot get in! I am logged in on the forums/main website.. but my log in doesn't work when trying to enter the vault.. kinda disappointing, i've been going there for a long time. But thanks for the up, as always.. glad I can at least get it here."
,EDfromRED,2011-07-19T00:51Z,"Hey WDM, I used to love your site too, but login attempts bring up a ""Redskunk"" notice. What is that? How no idea how I got it, how do I get it removed?
Thanks, Ed,"

[V],wushdishmeen,2011-07-20T08:43Z,"Guys... read the directions.   The vault is for WDM members only so if you were using it as a non-member because someone shared the direct link with you then you weren't supposed to have access in the first place.

You must login to the WDM forum with your username/password (NOT YOUR EMAIL) in order for your vault account to be created automatically.   Even though the WDM forum accepts email address as your username you cannot do this when doing the instructions for the vault."
