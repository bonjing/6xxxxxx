,mister_yuck,2012-02-16T10:26Z,"Its sad she went out like she did...but she knew what she was doing. She'd been at it for a long time. As incredible a talent as she was, i'm surprised she lasted as long as she did. She was just doing what she did, but I do think its pretty morbid how we as a culture and the music industry in particular are just shamelessly enabling people that are clearly on a direct path to destruction, and just suck the life/energy/talent right out and chew up and spit out whatever might or might not have survived.
its pretty gross. She was gonna do what she wanted to do, but having the history of addiction she did, it's crazy to me that the people around her were letting her drink and take pills ect like that. people really seem to vastly underestimate how dangerous mixing alcohol and certain pills can be. They said she was drinking at the hotel bar at 10am. A day of drinking and a couple benzos and you nod off in the bathtub and never wake up. pharmaceuticals kill more ppl in a year than dope and coke combined. heathe ledger. elvis. michael jackson. farah fawcett. marilyn monroe. Its a fu**ing sad thing. Being super famous and talented is a sketchy career choice these days. "
