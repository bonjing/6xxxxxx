,hootieman,2011-07-15T20:36Z,still missing minutes?
[V],.BONE.,2011-07-15T20:43Z,"Source:Garri Potter i dari smerti 2chast 2011 CAMRip/IMAGINE Thanks!
imagine rencode so yes"
,tannerman,2011-07-15T21:05Z,why the fuck is BONE uploading the same shit over and over. THIS IS THE SAME RELEASE THAT HAS OVER 20 CUTS (10 MIN CUT) WHY IS THIS UPLOADER UPLOADGING RENAMED SHIT? IS BONE A BOT?!
,tannerman,2011-07-15T21:08Z,someone should report bone to the forum. i know he's a good uploader but even VIP members should not upload duplicated shit.
,Asuimp,2011-07-15T21:13Z,"Thanks! Can we get the english audio track only? (In a separate file)
I've dowloaded exactly the same video 2 times already."
,ncbeaches,2011-07-15T21:15Z,Tanner- The real question is....why are YOU taking it upon yourself to comment on every torrent of this movie...from this user and every other? 
,tannerman,2011-07-15T21:44Z,"ncbeaches@
im just warning ppl that wants to see the complete film. this master piece shouldn't be seen if nearly 10 minutes has been cut.

im posting this on every torrent because every torrent is the same. somehow just renames it and bone chooses to upload it again. this is clearly a bot"
,scotia3712,2011-07-15T21:56Z,"Bone has lost all credibility in the last 24 hours at some desperate attempt to be first.
Sad"
[V],.BONE.,2011-07-15T22:34Z,reporting me 4 uploading 2 much hahaha...
,KawiZX14,2011-07-15T22:42Z,"Registered an account just to say FUCK you tannerman, and keep up the good work BONE!!"
[V],.BONE.,2011-07-15T22:45Z,go the fucking cinema if u want 2 see the full movie and stop complaining about something your getting 4 free just be thankfull us uploaders and release groups are here so u can download PS the full movie will be here very soon just have some patients it only came out the 15th (2day) ffs...
,doude422,2011-07-15T23:07Z,@tannerman your lucky he even posted this the movie has been out for like a couple hours. BONE is a amazing uploader he uploads like every hour so if you want to see the full movie wait like a couple of days or heres a idea GO TO THE THEATRES 
,Asuimp,2011-07-15T23:48Z,@.BONE. Can we get the english audio track only? (In a separate file)
,tmpa2step,2011-07-16T00:07Z,"To everyone complaining about the missing minutes, this does NOT include the end credits which on part 1 were 11 minutes, so this version is only missing less than 3 minutes of the movie.  The 20 cuts are just a few seconds each."
,BluePhazeBullies,2011-07-16T00:09Z,You are the BEST!!! THANKS!!!!!
,BluePhazeBullies,2011-07-16T00:25Z,Your The BEST!!!! THANKS!!!!!
,hoborgs,2011-07-16T00:28Z,"Thank you tannerman. Still waiting for a full version. How was Star Wars Episode II released in full way before it was released in theaters, yet we can't even get a decent telesync for the last chapter of Harry Potter?"
,hoborgs,2011-07-16T00:29Z,Episode III*
,hoborgs,2011-07-16T00:32Z,"@tmpa2step

Does it affect conversation at all?"
,tannerman,2011-07-16T00:55Z,"wow, bone, you really are dumn.
how do you think i know what scenes are missing.

i did see this at the cinema as early as july 12. 
my point is. don't see this epic movie when all the conversations has been cut. you wont understand squat."
,tannerman,2011-07-16T00:57Z,"tmpa2step@
you're obviosly clueless. the film itself (EXCLUDING the credits (NOT INCLUDING the credits) 
is suppost to be 2h 10 min. the credits is obviosly + 10 or 15 minutes. there are a few minutes cut exactly, just the first scene in the 2 minute mark, thats 1 minute cut atleast.
"
[T],n2kmaster,2011-07-16T01:14Z,so is it english or the russian version?
,dicilio,2011-07-16T01:31Z,"@Tannerman

The TOTAL runtime is 130mins... as in this is including the credits. Its exactly the same for every other movie out there. example... Quantum of Solace.. Total Runtime.. 106mins..... My copy.... 1.46:13........ and thats all the way through the credits until the MGM lion roars.. "
,ky100,2011-07-16T02:44Z,cheers BONE why the fuck are you all complainig its fucking free you are all bag rats cheers bone

,jthomas312,2011-07-16T07:20Z,Could u guys stop talking shit and rate the A: and V:?
,sayanshaka,2011-07-16T11:18Z,"Warning, this torrent has been rated by Tannerman and Moody's and it's junk they say, so please believe, your money, our pockets."
,Theflipeffect,2011-07-16T11:39Z,"I will be the FIRST to tell you about the A/V. 

Audio - 7
Video - 6-7 (Great for a cam)

This is the full movie, credits are not included. 
Cheers for the upload mate!"
,no1derwhy,2011-07-16T12:59Z,about tannerman its cool to try to tell peop that parts of the vid r missing but bone is awesome w/ all the up loads and hard work he does for all. i would like to teach this freedom of using TPB to my kids of 11 yrs but the assholes that leave innappropriate shit fuck it up. too bad. thanks for the info and thank bone for all the great work
,flashhhh,2011-07-16T13:18Z,"@tannerman : keep whining u fuckin pece of shit, get a life and stop complaining. those realease grps who dont have accounts on tpb , for thm uploaders like bone and many other guys upload on thr behalf. so shut ur fuckin mouth and the get the fuck outta here.
@ Bone : thx a lot,,,,keep em comin, !!!"
,zethaaron,2011-07-16T13:53Z,"@ Tannerman I saw this movie at 12:01 AM July 15 (the Release date in canada, oh and I'm in the earliest time zone in canada), I was among the first 150 or so people in my city to see the movie and the 2 hours and 10 minutes IS including the movie, it started at 12:01 and was over at like 1:53 or 2 or so, so please, you're pissing a lot of people off just forget it what does it really matter? I don't have to download to know just from the time that this is the full movie, and if not is only missing like 2 or 3 minutes so please, whether you're right or not (and I'm pretty sure you're not) just stop arguing it, it makes it all worse for you, and for everyone else"
,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-07-16T14:21Z,"English, 5 quality of audio/video, mp4, real. Kthxbai"
,tannerman,2011-07-16T14:24Z,"the 5 minutes that are cut here are still vital scenes. if you wanna get angry cuz im telling ppl it isnt the complete film, then be my guest."
,IsoSucks,2011-07-16T15:51Z,"@tannerman
thought i would join in on this 
the fact that groups upload them don't mean bone did ,
bone seems to be the best and well is not the group leader , so if you are going to give abuse give it to your mother for giving birth to you !tannerman! 
I for one would put a vote to having you banned from using this site if i could , ip ban the sh!t out of him .
Who's with me on this one +1 if you are 
Unlike him and most of you i am going to wait for a better copy ( due in the next week or so )
if you can't wait that long download this or STFU"
,BigLes1875,2011-07-16T17:00Z,its a free movie who the fuck cares so much about 10 mins? if your that gay for potter go to the fuckin cinema and beat one off to the missing parts!
,BigLes1875,2011-07-16T17:02Z,wtf..
,pieguy321,2011-07-16T17:14Z,"@tannerman

just go to the movie theater if u want to watch the entire thing stop hating on people who upload them "

,tawneerae,2011-07-17T02:57Z,thank u ur amazing love all ur dwnlds
,MessApril,2011-07-17T03:45Z,Is this one better than UnKnOwN's UL?
,Theduke228,2011-07-17T06:24Z,"Let's get things straight.  I saw this in 3D the day it came out in theaters and it was awesome.  This is just a recorded copy which, while greatly appreciated, is imperfect.  However, im not like tannerman who is complaining about a couple minutes cut out from 2-3 second hiccups because its RECORDED and its to be expected!  If people want to see the full movie, let them go out to see it for themselves while its in theaters, or wait 3-4 months for the DVD/Blu-ray release that'll appear.  Don't be whining because of a few minor imperfections in a recording that someone took the risk of making.  

That being said, this is great quality.  Thanks .BONE.!"
,Kole97,2011-07-17T12:20Z,"@Theduke228 haha nicely said....n ""tannerman"" he sounds retarded . "
,no1derwhy,2011-07-17T14:59Z,Just watched it awesome! for a cam a: 9 V:10 for a cam excellent work thanks bone u r 2 cool thanks for the hard work keep it up
,oglecowboy,2011-07-17T17:53Z,"Here's the full scoop: There's only one minor skip in the beginning nothing crucial probably only a minute skip.  Audio is out of sync in places but ok in the rest of the movie.  Bone you did a good job on this one.  I downloaded burned and watched. Like I said only one minor skip in the beginning.  No end credits.  So if u hear something different about this download don't believe it.  Will seed max for the next 24 hours.

A-7
V-6"
,Therrito,2011-07-22T01:21Z,"@Bone thanx for the up! :-)
@IsoSucks +1
@tannerman STFU bitch"
,Therrito,2011-07-22T03:54Z,"Taking into consideration that this is a cam I would say its a good video.
Good work Bone.
