Some Artists are a genre of their own (Sting is one of them). In their honour I tried to make a kind of a musical portrait. Unfortunately these artists did proof their qualities for quite some time already and accordingly the sound quality is a bit less (but still barproof).

Sharing and seeding may help others. Enjoy and consider buying for true sound quality and support.
