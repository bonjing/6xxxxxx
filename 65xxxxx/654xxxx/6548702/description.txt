Summary:
A heavy-horned afrobeat influence countered with a textural blanket of electronica, this album showcases the talents and strengths of the cast of characters that drummer and producer Dave Watts has assembled. Keyboardist Joey Porter lays down the funk under the coursing melodies of saxophonist Dominic Lalli in pure Motet fashion, with the ever-driving beats of Watts' masterful rhythmic production pushing the music through sonic peaks and valleys that tantalize and invigorate listeners. If you've loved The Motet for years or are just tuning in, listen up. You won't be disappointed.
