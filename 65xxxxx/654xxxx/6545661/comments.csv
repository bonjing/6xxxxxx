Edit: Is the one third size right for this year?"
,tavery80,2011-07-17T05:16Z,"chuck: 2010 is from different sources, already in PDF form.  So they may have been optimized better for size vs. quality than the converted C2C drive scans."
,tavery80,2011-07-17T05:28Z,"chuck: Upon closer examination, the 2010 PDFs are from digital originals, not scanned pages from the print magazines.  There is no evidence of a dot pattern from four-color printing.

Also, compare the quality of the pages from 12/09 to any month of '10 - the difference is eye-popping.  Bondi really screwed up on '09."

,ys68,2011-08-13T15:02Z,"Tavery80, many people have thanked you for this wonderful job and i want to do the same. In my years in torrent and p2p subculture, itÂ´s one of the best contributions iÂ´ve seen. I read Playboy for the articles, i watch Playboy for the women. It is an important piece in 20th century culture. In your comments i feel you strongly committed to quality and beautifully attached to the principles of sharing. Thanks again."
