How come you press harder on a remote control when you know the battery is dead? so you better seed to get speed ;)

Another 8h job!
TS/Cam Video was very nice, just needed a lot of work 
Firstly i had to remove the black borders, than removing the interlace, video needed skewing to get straight, adjusting brightness/gamma to get the black colour right,rgb, sharpening,denoise,chroma and hsv
i used full video resolution, unlike the others, by fixing the skew  i fixed the aspect too
Had to cut the Movie in parts and tweaked parts at daylight and nightscenes differently, as needed.

Audio needed magic too, fixed left channel, removed the cam audio feeling inside the track. cleared the voices. removed the hiss and noise and did a total restoration to get a line feeling.
Could nearly pass as a line now, if that kiddie laughing wouldnt be heard now and again.
Since it isnt a line but sounds almost like one, i tagged the file  still cam and "Cleaned" just to let you know the audio is cleaned now.
watch and hear samples
enjoy
