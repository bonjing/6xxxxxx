Regarding CRC errors while unpacking.

Open ""air-vib.rar"" in WinRAR.

Go to ""Tools"" and chose ""Repair Archive"".

When done, you'll get a new file ""rebuilt.air-vib.rar"".
Rename it and let it replace the original ""air-vib.rar"".

Now you may unpack the archive correctly.

You'll now get the ISO, as well as the CRACK directory and BASiS_1.1_update.

The latter two directories will be missing unless you have repaired the archive.

Read the .nfo carefully.

Install:
1) Unrar and mount or burn and use serial:
84237-44598-70174-04089-87803
2) PC: use precracked BASiS Installer.exe from
Crack/PC dir to install (NOT the install from DVD)
3) MAC : use BASiS Installer.app from DVD and
replace cracked files from Crack/MAC dir
4) After installation apply files from
Updates dir to your BASiS Library
5) Enjoy this fine Team AiRISO release !!!

Run ""BASiS.Setup.exe"" from the Crack directory.

Use a modern day AiR release of Kontakt (like v.4.1.1).

Hope this helps."
