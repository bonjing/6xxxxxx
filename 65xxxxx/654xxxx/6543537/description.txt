David Rogers was a doctor, handsome, charming and rich. He lived the lifestyle of a consultant â€“ expensive clothes, top restaurants, exclusive clubs â€“ until someone killed him in the hallway of his lovely million-plus London house. Was he killed for passion, professional jealousy, or plain old money? Bill Slider and his firm are thrown into the mystery, but they soon discover that nothing is as it seems, for though Davidâ€™s girlfriends are plenty, none of them can tell Slider anything about where he worked or exactly what it was he did . . .

* A new Bill Slider investigation is always cause for rejoicing...
