From humble beginnings, on the banks of the Fitzroy River in Rockhampton, folk inspired pop outfit, Busby Marou is making a serious impact on the Australian stage!
Since recording their debut EP (The Blue Road) with Australian singer/song writing icon, Pete Murray and acclaimed producer Anthony Lycenko, at Peteâ€™s home studio in late 2007, Thomas Busby, Jeremy Marou and their band have come a long way!
In 2009, Busby Marou was one of five successful applicants for â€˜Breakthroughâ€™ â€“ A Federal Government initiative supporting emerging indigenous contemporary musicians. The award assisted in the production of the bandâ€™s debut self titled album. Last year Busby Marou won the Deadly Award for â€˜Most Promising New Talent in Musicâ€™ and a Q Song award for their song â€œPaint My Cup.â€ 
In late 2010, the boys were approached by former Managing Director of EMI, John Oâ€™Donnell, to feature as the only unsigned act (together with Australia and New Zealandâ€™s most successful male artists) on the â€˜He Will Have His Way â€“ Finn Brothers Tribute Albumâ€™. The album went â€˜Goldâ€™ within a month of release and Busby Marouâ€™s version of the Crowded House classic â€˜Better Be Home Soonâ€™ was spun on radio playlists across Australia and New Zealand and has been nominated.
The Album is currently being rotated on radio playlists across Australia and the first single â€˜Biding My Timeâ€™ has recently been added to the Triple J playlist. The duo and band have shared the stage with the likes of Powderfinger, Pete Murray,The Panics, Archie Roach and many more. 
Jeremy Marou, a proud Torres Strait Islander has a unique and rare musical talent. He excels on just about every instrument he touches including ukulele, bass, drums and piano, however, it is his natural ability on the guitar that makes you stop and listen. His experience with traditional Murray Island song and dance as a child shines though his melodies. 
This combined with Thomas Busbyâ€™s distinctly Australian way of sharing stories has developed into a unique Australian song writing flavour with cracking harmonies, breathtaking musicianship and a natural feel for each others guitars!!
