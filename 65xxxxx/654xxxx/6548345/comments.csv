,badfox88,2011-07-18T17:34Z,Just wasted the whole day downloading this. It's glitchy as fuck. Don't bother with it.
,herjabram,2011-07-18T22:17Z,"got it within 3 hours, but it has several flaws where the image freezes and sound stops; a pity 'cause I'm used to great uploads from scene4all;
will try another download..."

,shiningwiz,2011-07-21T19:59Z,"Awful quality. Just pure shit. It skips around a lot and freezes a lot in several (crucial) moments. Waste of fucking time.

Go with something else like KYR, people. Stop seeding this shit."
