,blabbity,2011-08-02T00:35Z,"Played around with it, multiple virus scans, nmapped in a virtual machine - looks pretty clean.

Seems to be a pretty nice version. Not for me, for a friend who's pc is crap, so I can't go more into depth.

Basically, thanks for the upload and the updated version!"
,4bucher,2011-08-04T17:24Z,"hi
just tried and very happy with performance. Thanks!
Can anybody help me with one thing that I didn't find how to manage: Ctrl+Alt+del or Ctrl+Alt+ins opens a Windows Task Manager. I'd like to disable this key sequences at all cause when in VMWare Ctrl+Alt+Ins opens TaskMgr that is annoying."
