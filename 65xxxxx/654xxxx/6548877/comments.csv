,numaru7,2011-07-20T20:43Z,wouldn't you need 1 0 1 332 for this? ...because update 7 from skidrow is 1 0 1 167 or smth like that...
,Gensako,2011-07-21T23:12Z,no you just need skidrow update 7 cause 1 0 1 348 is just a hotfix of 1 0 1 332.
,Nagakaze,2011-07-22T15:07Z,Does this work with the 1.0.1.217 Quality Edition?

,endemoniada,2011-08-27T06:50Z,"On the Steam page it says there was an update released on Aug 11, 2011 so is this not the latest version ?"
,DelaBoucle,2011-08-27T07:04Z,"No, that would be 383 some of us are patiently waiting for. This is however the latest one that has been cracked as of yet"
,Arcilte,2011-08-27T21:23Z,This update is great don't get me wrong. It would just be nice to get the new update with Korea and the Greek wonders.
,molderfox,2011-09-16T15:54Z,Korea DLC ? is it cracked yet? 
,erikieperikie,2011-10-31T17:55Z,"This one works great!

I haven't tried it, because I don't know what exact steps it would take me to do (and I don't want to completely reinstall CivV), but what's the difference with the following download? http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6557893/Sid.Meiers.Civilization.V.Update.8-SPY"
,numaru7,2011-11-04T12:48Z,the Civ 5 Update 8 SPY is the version: 1.0.1.348 and that is the one i have installed - still waiting for the next cracked version :)
,popswala,2011-12-03T23:09Z,"My CivV doesn't work anymore. It did before I tried updating. Somehow I'm missing a file When I try running it "" zlib1.dll "" Any idea where I can find it to put back? I searched everywhere."
