This is a patch for NFS: High Stakes that allows it to be played on Windows Vista x86 and x64. I suspect it will also work for Windows 7, but I haven't tested it. 

PLEASE NOTE: This is not a full game. You have to have Need for Speed High Stakes already installed on your computer, this should  just let you play it on Vista (and maybe 7) if you were having problems with it before. 

I can't remember where I found this at, but I've used it successfully for years on Vista Home Premium. There is an instructions txt file included from the person who created this, it's super easy to use. 

Enjoy one of the best NFS games ever, now working on Vista!
