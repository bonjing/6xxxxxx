In a developing series of shows focusing on the individual candidates for the 2012 election, as he did previously for Ron Paul and Gary Johnson, John Stossel tonight invites Republican candidate Herman Cain on the show for the full hour (with the usual debate against fake-President Obama), and takes audience questions.

Other commitments on my time can precipitate a couple of days' delay, but I thought I would mention just to be helpful:
If TPB is down, or it's upload is down, you can try checking etorrents.org for new posts. Any posts made there will be made here on TPB after an outage (I interact via SSL only, which was down earlier this week increasing my typical delay).
