,tannerman,2011-07-15T20:28Z,"WARNING: this one has cuts all over it.
first cut i noticed was arround the 2 min mark when the goblin should reply something like ""i'm alive""
but it just skips that. god knows what else been cut.

with all those cuts this movie is not complete.

you are unwanted here.  its old seeing your stupid ""warining"" post over and over again. And Bone has NOT lost any credibility.  Anyone with a brain knows that the first weekend a movie comes out there will be flaws, and who cares if Bone uploads the movie 100 more times today, how does that hurt his credibility?  you are a douche bag. No one cares. everyone has seen your post over and over. thank you for the warining. you can stop now. we all know. you are not helping anyone. actually, your being a troll. and i'm feeding you with this post. i should know better. anyway, i'm done now.  "
,tannerman,2011-07-16T02:46Z,"rcr29budcar, just stfu. all im doing is telling ppl that if they truely want to see this film they should wait untill its 100 % complete.
if you want to see the film with cuts, then be my guest.
there's no reason to get your rage out on me, obviosly there must be something wrong with you if you get mad at this."
,rcr29budcar,2011-07-16T10:38Z,"Something is wrong with me. U putting this up on one or two torrents is fine, but u puttin it up on every single one! Also, its free you idiot! Its also whats called a bootleg a.k.a. pirated, so they will never be great quality and sometimes bits and pieces missing.  You r not helping. The truth is that everyone here know what to expect from bootlegs, u obviously do not!  Seeing you complaining on every page I go to is really annying, not only to me, but to most other regular users here! And you bashing the uploaders is something else wrong with me! The people who use their time to do something for others r appreciated by the regular, normal users of pirate bay! Bone, scenebalance, and all the rest r great uploaders! I been getting movies from them for a long time now and never had any complaints! THIS IS THE ONLY VERSION OUT AND WE ALL KNOW IT! U R NOT HELPING! Post your bullshit once or even twice, but going to every page and seeing you complain about a free pirated movie and bash the uploaders, who really do a great job, pisses me the hell off! We get it! Its incomplete! DON'T WATCH IT! GO BACK TO THE CINEMA! GET THA FUCK OUTTA HERE! YOU ARE AN IGNORANT BASTARD! So yeah, I do have somethin wrong with me, and thats pretty much it you douche!"
,rcr29budcar,2011-07-16T10:40Z,So stop trying to act innocent like your doing a community service! Your slandering the names of uploaders that the majority really appreciate!  And your annoying the majority by posting it on every page on the goddamn net! WE GET IT! U SUCK! STOP!
,Green-Banana,2011-07-16T11:30Z,"Chill out with the flame war, guys.  It's an abuse of VIP or Trusted status to deliver an incomplete torrent, so if they cut out stuff it's still not proper.  You should remember the old days when people had stronger commitment to this sort of thing; the UK's had a whole extra week to share this on the net.  "
,tannerman,2011-07-16T11:44Z,"rcr29budcar@ just stfu or leave this site, YOU LEECHING TROLL. don't feed him because he will reply to everything that he thinks is wrong.
he's obvisoly just a 12 year old prick that has found someone to pick on.

Again, don't see this film as it is missing frankly about 5 minutes (not 10), but five.
I'm sure there will be a repack in the next few days. And rcr29budcar, if you still gonna defend a release that is missing so many vital scenes, go fuck yourself. "
,rcr29budcar,2011-07-16T19:18Z,"tannerman, you suck!  from the looks of it on other pages, allot more people feel like me than u realized.  you suck. this is how it has been the first week of the release of most movies for the past couple years.  i've never seen you post here until this movie comes out. how long you been a member, a week? you've officially worn out your welcome.  well, i think i'm done with this trash, looks like there r a people on some other torrent pages to take my place! later tannerman, you dick, have fun pissing off the regulars."
[V],Murlok,2011-07-16T20:52Z,"its obvious we not need the movie the comments are a lot of more fun. :D About VIP rules well ? iTS A SCENE RELEASE SO ITS UP TO THEM!
I only upload. But remember a lot of people will read you comments so behave!"
,tannerman,2011-07-17T01:32Z,"rcr29budcar@ plz just die, leeching TROLL.

the fact that you went mad on someone that was trying to help is absurb. ive actually had ppl thanking me for telling them about the cuts. you should have done the same, but instead you slandered and humilated me which lead to a big fight. 

just do us a favour,  throw in that the towel and leave this site for good. or atleast stop what you're doing"
