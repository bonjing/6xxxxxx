,kiyoshi67,2011-09-08T00:49Z,"Installed perfectly for me, on Vista x64. Did the full instructions, including the reboot after install, before moving the cracked exe and running the .reg file.
Thanks Win4Max!

I hate that Vista (and later) doesn't seem to have the wav/what u hear etc settings anymore. All the free recorders that used to let me go program to program don't work without these settings. Total Recorder, as always, works just fine still.  Even better, it doesn't even require you to install the ""play through totalrecorder"" drivers like I had to back in the XP says."
,rimbim,2011-09-17T09:44Z,Followed the instructions. Installed with no problem onto Win 7 Prof 64 bit. Splendid - most obliged!
,tennisbgc,2011-09-29T04:02Z,"didnt work, the registration got shaded out but I still get that static noise every minute."
,ksol1460,2011-10-02T22:18Z,"I followed the directions, and it seemed to accept the registration -- but the white noise is still being inserted into my recordings. Maybe you should look into this."
,charlene17,2011-10-28T21:37Z,"In Options/Recording Source And Parameters, you have to let the audio recording source to be software : if you you select sound board with one devices that white noise/hiss will hit you again."
,Sputz67,2011-11-23T11:16Z,Instructions are confusing. You have to replace the installed .exe with the one in the Crack folder & yes it does work in Windows7
,Darkalus,2012-01-12T06:30Z,"Hmm, I too get the white noise on my Window 7 despite cracking it and choosing audio source as 'software'."
,operator1101,2012-01-18T03:00Z,"Followed the directions exactly from this torrent and the same package from a private tracker with crystal clear directions. 
Unfortunately, I still get a blast of static after a few seconds of recorded audio.
Installed, rebooted, verified drivers installed correctly, copied crack and added reg, selected 'Software' as recording source. No dice. :("
,thecynic,2012-03-01T18:14Z,"Installs perefct on Window 7 SP1. Just follow the instruction in the README file.

Many thanks to the uploader :)"
,tavery80a,2012-04-05T09:09Z,"Installed fine in Win7 HP, crack shows registered ok BUT...still generates white noise occasionally.

For recording internet streams, I had far better results with Replay AV8, with this torrent:

It's not the latest and greatest, but it installed perfectly in Win7, better sound quality than TR and nice flexibility."
