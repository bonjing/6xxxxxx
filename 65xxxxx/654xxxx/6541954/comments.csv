,richardpa,2011-07-15T11:21Z,"Got to agree with benjilatino comments the movie seems to repeat itself, it's pretty bad at the beginning (first 4 mins) and then the audio goes out of sync for about 30 mins and there's still the odd lag here and there...:("
[V],extremezone,2011-07-15T12:28Z,"sorry mates if it's nuked for repeat itself and out of sync wait for another release to be available and i will uploaded , not my fauld i checked sample and was ok but original encoder should pay more attention before spreading a release"
