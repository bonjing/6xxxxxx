It hacks and harvests your email address (even though you don't use it when entering the serial) and then you get nasty emails about copyright violation etc. Firewall makes no difference. Just google acetools.biz if you don't believe. Many people just pay up (59.95) because of these bullying tactics but just ignore them, or report them to the relevant body in your country. What they do is illegal."
