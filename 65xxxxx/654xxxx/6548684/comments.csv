,niktreuq,2011-07-18T20:31Z,"This is the incomplete version, but the quality looks good."
,rcr29budcar,2011-07-18T21:13Z,"The quality doesn't look that much better from the ones I downloaded 2 days ago.  And it is the version with a few parts missing.  I read the book, and from what I can tell from the book and not seeing this in cinemas, you can still watch this copy, with parts missing, and enjoy it.  It doesn't take away from the story much at all.  "
,rcr29budcar,2011-07-19T01:55Z,"john12321,  shut the hell up!   You been spamming on every page!  If it were true, whatever, but its a damn lie! You cannot watch this movie in better quality anywhere on the web!  You've posted this lie so much that everyone knows! And most people know you're full of crap! Uhh, i looked up Harry Potter Koochie Koo and found this in better.......SHUT THE HELL UP!"
,Shinobi360,2011-07-19T03:05Z,"God Bless you RCR, please somebody get this guy off TPB he is ruining the content on this site, people like us rely on the comments to see if the movie has good a/v and if its worth the upload. To all the people that do the tedious uploads and legwork thank you, to John please Sir Go Slap Your Dick Against a Cactus, douche"
