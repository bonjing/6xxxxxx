PLEASE GO TO: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6554692/The_Jetsons For The Exact Same Download (If 0 seeders is shown there still might very well be a seeder not showing up)

I am unsure, but this torrent was made using a short lived version of uTorrent (about 2 day lifespan)- The NEW Torrent was made using the latest uTorrent which came out about 3 days after the previous. Many bugs have already been found to be fixed.

So please go here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6554692/The_Jetsons for The Jetsons.

Peace."
