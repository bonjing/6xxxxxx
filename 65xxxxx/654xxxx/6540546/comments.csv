,soulja50,2011-07-26T09:51Z,Ignore that last comment. I commented on the wrong torrent.
,cythonic,2011-08-09T09:46Z,Works great. Not a great game tho
,54257,2011-08-30T05:46Z,"Ignore Mr. ""This game sucks"". Anyone having issues with the gameplay, simply click on ""juiced2config.exe"" in the game folder, and turn off music. Most of the music is terrible anyway, and keeping it on actually destroys the physics of the game making driving almost impossible. 
I've played this game since it came it and still love it. Thanks for the torrent!"

There is a folder named ""Crack"" in the directory where the DVD file is located e.g. ""G:""(Virtual drive). Copy the file named ""j2launcher"" and paste it to where you installed Juiced 2. e.g. C:\\Program files x86\THQ. Then play the game. "
