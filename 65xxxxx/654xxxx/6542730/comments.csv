,sac0o01,2011-08-09T10:53Z,"If you run the installer from the disk you will have trouble running this game on Win 7.  If you just want the multiplayer part of this try this one:  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6590799/Soldier_Of_Fortune_II_-_Double_Helix_GOLD 

It is just a copy of a working install directory, drag it from the zip to where you want it and run.  Works fine on W7"

,dmmm123,2012-05-26T17:15Z,"I'm having a problem with installing the game on Windows 7 x32.
When I mount the MDS file, and the menu screen for the game pops up, where it says 'Play', 'Install', 'Extras', etc., I press Install, and a splash image shows up with the SoF:Platinum logo, and in the bottom right corner, a small setup window with a loading bar pops up. When the bar reaches 100%, the window and the image stay on my screen for about a minute or two, and then just disappear. Crash. The only 
processes that still remain in Task Manager are '_ISDel.exe' and '_INS5576._MP'. I tried running '_ISDel.exe' directly from the 'Setup' folder on the disk, I tried setting the autorun launcher, the Setup launcher, and '_ISDel.exe' to the WinXP Service Pack 3 and 2 compatibility, I tried ticking off all other options like setting the resolution to 640x480, and that desktop composition option, but it still does the same thing. It hangs and then crashes to desktop.
I can't even install the game. I've tried downloading from other torrents, but they're all the same image, so I'm still having the same problem.
Can anybody help me? I really want to play this game.

@sac0o01 I need a working install directory for Soldier of Fortune 1, not 2, so I'm sorry, but your link is not helpful to me. I already installed SoF 2 Double Helix Gold Edition, and got it working without any problems."
