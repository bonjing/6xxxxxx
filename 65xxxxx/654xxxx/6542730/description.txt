AN IMPORTANT NOTE ON THE PARENTAL LOCK FEATURE:-

 The parental lock option allows adults to adjust the violence level in 
 Soldier of Fortune and eliminate some content that parents might deem 
 inappropriate for their children. Adult users have the option to set a 
 password in the game interface and adjust the content to their liking. 
 Once the password is set, the settings will remain until the password is 
 correctly entered again. Parents should keep their Parental Lock password
 out of the reach of children!
