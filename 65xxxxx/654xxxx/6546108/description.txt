A group of animal rights activists - Jade, Tim, Fix and the hacker Izzy - invades the complex of Chapel Pritchard to liberate subjects, with the support of the daughter of Dr. Woods, Ali, and her boyfriend and security guard Chris. Dr. Woods is in charge of an unsuccessful experiment for the cure of cancer in the facility, and when they use his access card., the security system is activated. They try to escape using an elevator to the underground laboratory, and when the guards trap them, Izzy opens all the doors of the compound trying to provide a escape route for the group.
