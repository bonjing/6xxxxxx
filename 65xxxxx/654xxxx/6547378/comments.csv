,GrandmasterJay,2011-07-19T03:11Z,"Idiots are so quick to say its fake. Download first, then you can comment!!! Then SEED!!!"
,vibhuvw,2011-07-20T10:47Z,Ok this is not a fake torrent. U need 3d Tv or player to watch this - Just a warning for the noobs.. and Yes video and audio is dvd type. just that not able to do wide screen(might be somethng which i dont know) .. dont hesitate to download this 3d version of Xmen 3d first class :)
,DJMpyrat,2011-07-20T20:55Z,It's Real
,shelbylab,2011-07-22T04:48Z,Yes it's real. Nice try. Audio out of sync.
,rophiroth,2011-07-22T06:59Z,And which player works?
,savasfazer,2011-07-22T08:11Z,"Suckssssssssss.............
A : 5
V : 3
Couldnt watch it....my eyes hurt....!!!"
,witchmaster,2011-07-22T16:59Z,"thanks!
works great on my 3d tv."
,CA2ONT3,2011-07-26T04:08Z,you need an adapted 3D player and 3D screen to be able to watch 3D movies. I had the same problem downloading Tron Legacy 3D digital and after trying to find how to play it on my iMac i found out u needed 3D gadgets to c it...
,fatbeer,2011-07-27T09:03Z,"Don't expect much from this. Source does NOT seem to be HD/blu-ray, but rather it is upscaled video/DVD. Artifacts galore, out of sync for the most part and stereo sound. Stereoscopic but the left hand side image top 5-10% constantly distorts/bent (looks like an analog video tape distortion). Thanks to the uploader, but best to wait for a proper me thinks."
,l2torrent,2011-08-01T17:43Z,"@deecee32: Even if you did manage to find someone's real IP, and not a Bouncer (such as TOR/SeedBox/etc), please educate those of us who are not in the service of any government and/or military, how do you extrapolate (without said official granted access) that IP to home address? ;P
Just asking."
,scratchos13,2011-08-02T06:19Z,"prett dodge its like some one had a good 2d copy of this and converted it to 3d, its just not proper 3d its like when i convert 2d picture into 3d on 3d tv and its blury most of the time at the very top of the screen and the audio is out of sink, id wait for the real 3d blu ray to come out but if your itching to watch in 3d wait this will ruin it for you.
A:2 out of sinc
V:3.5 good but sometimes blurry 
M:6"
,wilsonamon,2011-08-02T17:01Z,"hey deecee32, can you invite me to 3dtorrents.org?"
,kris812,2011-08-03T07:15Z,"Don't download.. Other SBS stuff works great, this one looks like donkey crap.. No offense to the ripper but it: looks like a cam (dont know how you pulled that off); audio sync issues and was only 1.0 sound, lol; left eye has lots of flicker; eye's don't line up correctly.. Need I say more.. Thanks again for the efforts and yes its real and is SBS 3D but again, looks like donkey.. "
,raissinhaah,2011-08-13T05:32Z,"Does anyone know what kind of 3D Glass i need to watch this movie? Is the simple one (Red and Blue Lens) or the one that polarizes the image?
And do i need the 3D Television or can i see the movie on my Led TV? Thank u a Lot..."
,CDLX5342,2011-08-13T17:34Z,"It is SBS so you will need a 3DTV or stereoscopic player. You will need active shutter glasses to be able to effectively watch this. Im gonna give it a try, and hopefully the more positive comments are the accurate ones! cheers uploader"
,cheatsforme,2011-08-13T22:02Z,"Nice effort, the audio is only slightly out of sync and the right side is perfect but the left side is distorted which ruins the movie unfortunately."
,ilang16,2011-09-04T06:58Z,"TO ANYONE ABOUT TO DOWNLOAD THIS, GO TO GOOGLE AND TYPE 'X-MEN FIRST CLASS 3D'
The first thing you will see is the producers talking about how this movie will NOT be in 3d.  This is a fake.  best case scenario, its computer generated 3d (think clash of the titans remake, only probably worse) other scenarios include, viruses, trojans, spyware, etc.  LEAVE THIS ALONE, HAPPY DOWNLOADING :)"

,VisciusK,2011-12-13T18:40Z,"Damn, this is not 3d, FAKE, wasted time"
,Bulldog2429,2012-04-04T10:26Z,"@ilang16
You can get video converters that can convert ANY 2D movie/video into 3D, so it is very much possible that this torrent has been converted from 2D to 3D.
Don't be so quick to judge in the future."
