,tannerman,2011-07-15T13:51Z,"why would we wanna watch out for a cut?
imagine dosn't seem to speak english very good.

you don't watch out for a cut."
,AriGold45,2011-07-15T17:34Z,"Don't be stupid, he's saying watch out for the scene that skips, b/c it might surprise you.  God knows if he doesn't say something beforehand about it, everyone will come on here and bitch that it skipped.

Why are you bein a dick to someone who uploads movies that everyone wants to see?  It's not the correction, it's the way you say it, you're just bein an asshole."
,tannerman,2011-07-15T20:31Z,"arigold, you are one stupid fuck. im just warning ppl who want to see the complete film,
stfu and listen."
,AriGold45,2011-07-16T08:10Z,"Your message doesn't say anything about warning people, it just says that Imagine can't speak english. I dont' get it. 

Besides, if you had bothered to watch the movie, you'd see that the skipped parts don't take anything away from the film... Only 1-2 seconds are cut out anyway.  Part of the reason this runtime is shorter is because the credits are cut out, which cuts out at least 10 minutes. Stupid fuck"
,tannerman,2011-07-16T11:51Z,"AriGold45 @ wow you really are a dumb troll.
i saw this film as early as july 12 th, i know that this release and every other is missing some VITAL scenes. and i'm sure what you're telling are lies, because you haven't seen the film, you're just relying on something someone else has said.

just go away you troll. "
,AriGold45,2011-07-25T03:45Z,"I saw the film, ass. Please tell me what ""vital"" scenes are missing.  And please explain how you were warning people, i still don't have that cleared up in my mind. 

Your original post makes it sound like one sarcastic prick, not some hero telling everyone that this isn't a complete copy.

BTW: This is a pretty good copy of the film.  I saw it in IMAX 3D and it was one of the rare movies I consider worth the money.  Considering how long the movie has been out, this is a fine version to watch if you don't have money to go to the theater"
