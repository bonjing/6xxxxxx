For this Documentary Ismael RodrÃ­guez just show scenes of his films as director and didn't use others which he had the same rights for being producer in association with his brothers, so we watch during the film scenes of Pedro Infante's funeral mixed with Rodriguez-Infante movies and the silent reactions of the artistic environment in these shook, narrated it by Arturo de Cordova,who never share with Infante a scene in a movie, however both appear in Reportaje(1950,Emilio Fernandez).

Rodriguez avoid to show the audience private matters about Infante's life contrary to what Miguel Zacarias did in La Vida de Pedro Infante(1963), instead of that, Rodriguez present with some sketches the ambitious project he had with Infante, Museo de Cera (Wax Museum) which would have been a very interesting movie that would show one more time the magnitude of this actor,and the most interesting thing of all: a brief interview with Infante in a TV show in a kind of homage to Ismael Rodriguez, first time that many people saw Pedro Infante talking out of a movie, so had been passed six years after Infante's dead and the audience didn't finished yet to forget his greatest Idol and however to be a documentary this film had an acceptable success in box office as was usual in the better times of this important duet for the Mexican Films: Rodriguez-Infante
