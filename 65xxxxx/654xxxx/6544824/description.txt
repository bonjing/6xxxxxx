Hailed as one of the most erotic and provocative vampire films ever made, Joseph Sarnoâ€™s VAMPIRE ECSTASY pulsates with an arousing sensuality and blood-chilling horror that has never been equaled.

VAMPIRE ECSTASY a.k.a. VEIL OF BLOOD (1974) stars MARIE FORSA Directed by Joe Sarno Nestled in the mountains of present day Germany, a grim and secluded castle stands - the haunted legacy of the beautiful medieval vampire Baroness Varga. Put to death for her ravenous hunger for female bodies and blood, the Baroness uttered a curse that she would one day return to forever satisfy her unnatural lust...and that day has finally come! Four women have gathered at the castle unaware that its darkly seductive housekeeper is a satanic high priestess presiding over a coven of delectable servants, each night performing wild orgiastic rituals and sensual lesbian acts to keep the Baronessâ€™ profane spirit alive. As the women are drawn deeper into the ultra erotic nightmare - succumbing to torrid and evil fantasies of the flesh - it will be the most uninhibited among them who shall serve as the vessel into which the Baroness passes...to continue her evil reign of terror.
