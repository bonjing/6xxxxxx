I'm downloading al versions, great.
But can you help seeding for version 2, 4, 5 and 6?
They come in very slow, I'll help seeding when they are in!"

I had a HD issue 2 weeks ago, so I`m affraid number 2, 4 and 5 wont seed. I remade that torrent, so I hope it works. Number 6 should seed, cuz that 1 is in the seedbox ( reseeded it ).

I suggest to join me at Facebook, like many other people have. In that way you stay up to date about my releases and you can pre-listen the episodes over there.

I dont come often to tpb to read comments, because I rarely get comments here at tpb. There is only 1 place I read the comments and that is at extratorrent dot com.

Facebook: Headdock Trance


Let me know if you have the episodes you want at Facebook. If not, we will find a way to get you those episodes.

Cheers!"
