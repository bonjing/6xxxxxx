,rcr29budcar,2011-07-16T19:20Z,"yeah BONE, don't do something crazy like that, you might get in trouble. lol

Thanks guy, I appreciate what you and the others do. Thanks."
,t2BeDLaM,2011-07-16T19:21Z,lol u poor guy!
,scotia3712,2011-07-16T19:30Z,"Ill Leave it , just like 99% of people out there. Like I said, Bone losing cred like Mad. Keep uploading unfinished garbage on the biggest movie of the year. Someone better than you is going to do it right and all you have done is wasted peoples time, BW, and ruined your cred.

Bone so pathetically desperate to get out the movie of the year is willing to upload garbage to do it, and doesnt see the problem with it.
And his retort will be my upload count, as if I didnt create a new name to point out his transparency"

,rcr29budcar,2011-07-16T20:46Z,"john12321:

I searched for ""harry-pothead-dickido"" and enjoyed better quality there.

We definately don't need/want your dumb ass lying spam anywhere on the bay!"
,vsjane,2011-07-16T21:33Z,"I've been searching for Scotia3712 uploads and guess what - pathetically, he has none!"
,qa1234,2011-07-16T22:19Z,"scotia3712 How long you been crying about this torrent, all yesterday and today and all next week i reckon. You got serious lonely issues. Buy a frickin cat you lil pussy!!! Who cares how many of the same torrents he puts up dipshit. You really must think bone is deleting minutes to piss you off. So take ur tattletall, baby, good for nothing, lonely fuckface ass home to mommy, BITCH"
,Sandy2332,2011-07-17T01:48Z,"To scotia3712,

Bone warned you that there are missing parts and what do you do???

You whine about it, you egghead, get a life, its FREE, get over your sorry ass and don't download it, but stop whining across the board, you dipstick!!!"
,Timothious,2011-07-17T04:28Z,"I never did quite understand ho people get pissed off over something that's free. Especially when they haven't ULed anything. I thank u and all the others who take the time to do this for other people. :"")"
,Bynx,2011-07-17T06:28Z,"Speaking for myself, downloads arent free. I pay about a buck a gig to download and while Im downloading someone is uploading and I pay for that too. Nothing is free. So if someone takes the time to upload files, one should expect they will be as good as they can be without virus etc. Being clear up front if there are problems with the file at least gives people the choice to download or not."
,Sandy2332,2011-07-17T07:06Z,"Bynx,

So let me get this straight, you want to count your ""Tangible Expenses"" as costing you when you are downloading a movie that you didn't need to pay for to see.

If the only reason you got an internet is so that you can download FREE items, then I agree with you, you got screwed BIG TIME!!! Maybe its time to re-consider your options!"
,Sandy2332,2011-07-17T10:10Z,"Downloaded it and watched it...

Simply ♥♥♥♥ it!!!

Many Thanks to BONE and all the seeders."
,Kole97,2011-07-17T12:15Z,@Bone no on'es gonna report anything ...it's just people are too curious to see the most Awaited movie of the year !!

,charlik,2011-07-17T22:35Z,"Look you know what I don't give a fig about the file size. You want perfect go pay the money and see it in the theatre. But I do have an issue with  the fact that folks aren't being up front that it is missing part of the movie. Put it in the title, put it in the info. Whatever but just be upfront about it. "
,Feetback,2011-07-18T02:31Z,"A-*******/V******* - Thank You! very much ** ""Bone""  **  i must Say's ..... You re The Best Uploaded around .....  very much Appreciate for your Excellent Good Work for all Current up to Date Flicks .... you re the very few by far  :) "
