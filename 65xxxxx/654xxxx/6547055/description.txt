Im happy to say that Michael Caine has always been perhaps my most favorite
of the British actors, followed closely by Sir Anthony Hopkins in fact.

With corporate ambitions to climb as high as possible up that ladder, 
Michael Caine's character in this movie picture gets drwan into a game
of serial murder - beginning with the realization that his wife must be a 
"witch" for being able to say "I forgive you for being a failure" as he sets
upon his course of revenge and mayhem generally speaking on his determined 
course of action to remain virile in the corporate world in which he seeks
to be the dominant player at his company, in any event - one way or another,
come what may! Elizabeth McGovern plays a vulnurable and quite lovely pawn
to Caine's aspirations and desires - in the plot overall.
