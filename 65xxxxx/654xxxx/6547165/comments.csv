People were nice enough to share it with you, you share it with the next person.  This is how Torrent works.

(I say this because I've been Uploading to almost 1,000% and yet there are no new Seeders.)"
,enonumus,2012-02-20T00:19Z,"Bruno212 is correct, the color and detail is very, very poor.  Definitely appears to be a VHS rip.  There are definitely much higher quality torrents for this movie (the 1.2GB version is excellent), but if you want to see the extended version you may have to settle for this one.  The upload is appreciated regardless, but I deleted it.  (Slow download btw)"
