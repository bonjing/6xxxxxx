sorry to ask a seemingly stupid question, but i see the link to add the english subs, however i have no idea how to do this! i clicked the link, downloaded then what...? 

thanks in advance for any help!!!!!"
,ttschuit,2011-08-09T23:30Z,"@montmarte

Download the subs. Get VLC player. Right mouse click on the screen when the video is playing. Video ---> Subtitles ---> Browse. Tick it and it's there. YW"
,kaonashii,2011-08-11T10:26Z,"thanks for the upload.

@montmarte = download the subtitles (.idx, .srt or whatever it is), and put the file in the same folder as the movie.  then make sure the movie and the subtitles have exactly the same name (apart from the .avi, the filetype)...  then do as ttschuit said an use VLC player, and the options like he/she said.  enjoy"

,NickD76,2012-01-12T16:32Z,"Sorry for my agressive tone, but anyone who suggests hardcoding subtitles on any movie is a retard racist idiot... As if the whole world speaks only one language and this language has to be hardcoded for everyone! 

Although I am not a native English speaker, I can speak and read English rather well, but what about cases of people who only speak their native (non english) languages? Then they have to use external subtitles, which will be mixed up with the hardcoded ones and the release will be useless for them. 

Again my apologies."
