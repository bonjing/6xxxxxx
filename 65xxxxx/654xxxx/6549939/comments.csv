But seriously, good resource on how to treat common (and not so common) skin problems, if you can get the pharmaceuticals over the counter.


And on a more ""home remedy"" note, for the readers that can not buy any meds without bribing a doctor: some simple fungal skin infections can be effectively treated by applying apple vinegar a few times a day, for a few days to a week. If it doesn't improve in a few days, go see a doctor. "
