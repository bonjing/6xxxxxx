"The guy that I think has done more for blues than most people, which is why we called him the Godfather, was Muddy Waters. So when Muddy Waters went to Chicago, Chicago opened its arms and let him in. Then a lot of the young people, and especially young white people, started to listen to Muddy Waters. Muddy Waters is the guy to me who did it. Muddy Waters. Before him you had Big Bill Broonzy. But Muddy Waters. There is nobody who'd done more for the blues as a whole than Muddy Waters. Muddy had his style. Regardless to what jazz did, regardless to what country or anything else, Muddy had his style and he stayed with it. And it still stands today with most of us as a guideline for playing real, true blues." B.B. King
