,rambambula,2011-07-30T17:51Z,Skimmed through it quickly.. Looks good. A&V: 8 Movie: don't know yet.
,snowbirds,2011-08-08T06:24Z,"Rarely is government propaganda so obvious.  This movie must have been funded entirely by the US military.  There really isn't much of a movie here.  It's mainly a message. 

Here is the message: we should trust the leader who has gotten a bunch of people killed and who may get us killed.  If we doubt this leader, it is because we lack faith.  The leader is an honorable person who is doing his best for us.

This message is for US military men who are dying for no good reason, to boost their morale.  This message is for the American voter who sees that all our political leaders are full of shit.  In both cases this movie tells us to ignore our feelings of concern, and to follow our leaders blindly..."

,Steelnation36,2011-08-15T08:53Z,"snowbirds... what the hell are you talking about? yea its about following the leader that made mistakes in the past. but govt propaganda??? thats a big stretch. you one of those that only sees the evil in the govt. Its more about a guy fighting through past mistakes and redeeming himself. 

It clearly shows how upset he is over his past and his mistakes and at times he feels he didnt deserve to survive. Historical fact is great leaders made mistakes. Look at Gen Lee from the confederacy... made probably the most costly mistake in warfare in terms of loss of human life at gettysburg but hes still one of the greatest generals of all time"
,Steelnation36,2011-08-15T08:55Z,....btw i saw your comment when i DL so i actually went into the movie expecting it to be govt propaganda and even with that in my head still didnt see ANY govt or military propaganda. 
,kreem,2011-08-29T17:25Z,@Snowbirds - shut the fuck up. What would you know about honour? Have YOU ever been in the service? I highly doubt it.
,thejoker8692,2011-08-29T20:39Z,"@ snowbirds stfu moron. A.) No one made you watch it. B.) No one is asking you to live in the U.S. C.) Unless you're serving and have been in an engagement, you don't know wtf you're talking about. So stfu, download it, watch it, and save the anti-military bullshit for someone who cares. Thanks for the download vladtepe3176"
