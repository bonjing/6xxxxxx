Guest Star Virginia Grey ( in two roles as Beth and Rainey )

This well-done love story was also the last with Major Adams, 
because Ward Bond died during a break in production.
Typical of that era in American TV, what happened 
to the Major was never explained!

The next two episodes still had his picture in the 
opening credits, although NBC aired those and others 
that year out of order.

I purposely uploaded them in a more practical order, 
and you'll soon see why.
