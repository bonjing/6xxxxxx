Fifteen years ago, Ben Walker (Sorbo) made a decision to leave his college sweetheart Wendy (Swanson), and ultimately his faith, in order to pursue a lucrative business opportunity. Now on the verge of marriage to an equally materialistic fiance, he is visited by an angelic mechanic (Ratzenberger) who tells him that he needs to see what his life would have been like had he followed Gods calling. Suddenly, Ben finds himself married to Wendy with two daughters, including a rebellious teen (Ryan), getting ready for church on a Sunday morning, where hes scheduled to give his first sermon as the new pastor.

If Ben wants to get back to his old life, he must first learn to appreciate the value of faith and family, and perhaps rediscover the love of his life. In the tradition of Its a Wonderful Life and The Family Man, What If tells the story of a man whose glimpse into what hes missing reminds him of what he truly wants.
