,davylols,2011-07-18T08:19Z,"dazedkiwigirl:

This has almost 10,000 seeders right now. You can try figuring out how to configure your trackers correctly, or you can continue to sound like a dumb cunt, but I thought I'd point out that you come across as an ungrateful bitch when you act like the world somehow owes it to you to serve you up with free videos.

in short: get out"

,catfly,2011-07-18T10:54Z,"davylols, you're some dick aren't you? i bet you just picked on dazedkiwigirl cos she is obviously female, and wrote a polite message. While on the other hand there's a tons of fuckwads writing idiotic abusive shit about seeding the 1 hour old file who you DON'T abuse. Face it, you have a tiny cock. You hate women. And guess what, with an fucked up attitude like that you will never get laid. And hey - you blame the gals for that i bet."
,bipolarx,2011-07-18T11:12Z,"I have tried all the torrents for this, but it won't download. Has something happened? HBO on their cases? As this happened last week also."

How do you configure your trackers? I'm relatively new to this. I'm seeding the file at 4 times the rate it's downloading.

Any help is appreciated."

,sixty4bit,2011-07-18T21:25Z,excellent quick upload many thanks. keeping my girlfriend happy i've been seeding this since last night at 11pm. enjoy!
,mimmsey,2011-07-18T23:02Z,"I can not get the sound to work either. Just that much of a ""dumb cunt"" I suppose.

Tried couple of different players, vlc, divxplus etc. The mixing seems to be messed up with only music to be heard, no talking, apart from when someone screans with a high frequency.

The link that was posted with a workaround gives 301. Unfortunately I know fuck all about audio... Played around with the audio settings within the players, but to no avail.

Weird, more than 40k seeders, what am I missing everyone else is getting?"
,-Eris-,2011-07-19T00:03Z,"I want to thank you guys in advance once more for always uploading the best videos with the best quality, and I don't want you to misunderstand me but, I don't get a reading on active seeders, the torrent  is given as disconnected. Can you guys help out? thanks! ^_^"
,bronzx,2011-07-19T00:12Z,I love how people beg for seeders when files have only been up for less than an hour. Thats why I wait a day or 2 then seed for a week...

,gpurple,2011-07-19T10:25Z,i love you.
,dazedkiwigirl,2011-07-19T11:08Z,"davylols:
I love how you go from 0-UGLY in less than 60 seconds.
If your dick was as big as your mouth maybe you wouldn't be such a he man woman hater.
I have my stuff configured properly so I really don't know what the problem is.
Next time confront me properly before jumping on me like the asshole that you are.
Thank you very much."

,mmedic,2011-07-30T19:11Z,"@ everyone who thinks i.told.u is real....

these DMCA notices are false, and if someone were actually get banned or have action taken for downloading a torrent without subpoena and court involvement, ur the one that gets paid in the end.  No result has ever occurred from these 'notices' it is a scare tactic.  "
