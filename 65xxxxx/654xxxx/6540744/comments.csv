from W4B site:

Born: 1984 Height: 161 cm Measures: 89-63-88 Country: Poland 

You have seen this beautiful model naked. You fell in love with her perfect body. But you would like to know more about herâ€¦ Well, we in W4B can make your wish come true! Just read what she tells about herself!

Born in 1984 in Bialystok, in Poland, I first caught the eye of a photographer when I was 16 years of old, whilst participating in a family party.

He took some photos of me and, having enjoyed every minute of it, it inspired me to become a model. From then on, it became my way of life! I soon started entering as many modeling projects as possibleâ€¦

One of my first main achievements in modeling happened at aged 19 when I took part in Polish Playboyâ€™s Fotoerotica contest and together with the photographer won second prize and get published in Playboy for the first time.

Soon after that, people connected with modeling business increased their interests in me and I started getting more and more new interesting assignments in Poland and abroad. Work offers began flooding in and it wasnâ€™t long before I was starring in various catalogues, calendars, adverts and magazines.

At 23 I went to Prague, Czech Republic, where I had shooting with Milan Hladil for the front cover of Playboy main issue released in December 2007, which I feel is like winning a trophy saying youâ€™re good at what you do.

After that I headed to London where I met Playboyâ€™s photographer Byron Newman, who photographed me for the Playboyâ€™s Vixens magazine which was released in February 2008. Iâ€™ve recently been in Czech and Bulgarian Maxim, French Newlook and Playboyâ€™s Vixens issue Jul/Aug 2008 again. I also appeared in Hungarian Playboy issue Jun 2008 and German Coupe magazine issue Mar 2007 and Jul 2005.

I really do enjoy modeling, Iâ€™m very good at posing and expressions. Aside from my work for Playboy and other well known magazines I also work for various lingerie and swimsuits companies, appear in music video clips, calendars, adverts and interviews in USA, England, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Poland all in the past few years.

Iâ€™ve always wanted to travel the world and meet new interesting people. My two favorite countries that I have visited so far are England and Portugal, where I worked on some very interesting projects, which were really fun and a great experience for me.

Iâ€™m a very friendly, open-minded and a little bit dotty person, I love challenges, nature, wildlife and the great outdoors. My favorite foods are Thai cuisine, chips and chocolate ice-creams, my favorite drinks are Mojito and Caipirinha.

I like sensation and adventure films, and books, I also love rock music â€“ thatâ€™s me for now, Marta Zawadzka.
