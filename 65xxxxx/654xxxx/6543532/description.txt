Foundation Design: Principles and Practices 2nd Edition by Donald P. Coduto
Product Description
Using a design-oriented approach that addresses geotechnical, structural, and construction aspects of foundation engineering, this book explores practical methods of designing structural foundations, while emphasizing and explaining how and why foundations behave the way they do. It explains the theories and experimental data behind the design procedures, and how to apply this information to real-world problems. Covers general principles (performance requirements, soil mechanics, site exploration and characterization); shallow foundations (bearing capacity, settlement, spread footings -- geotechnical design, spread footings -- structural design, mats); deep foundations (axial load capacity -- full-scale load tests, static methods, dynamic methods; lateral load capacity; structural design); special topics (foundations on weak and compressible soils, foundation on expansive soils, foundations on collapsible soils); and earth retaining structures (lateral earth pressures, cantilever retaining walls, sheet pile walls, soldier pile walls, internally stabilized earth retaining structures). For geotechnical engineers, soils engineers, structural engineers, and foundation engineers.
