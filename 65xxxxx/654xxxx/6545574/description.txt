Amazingly, this is in 720p - and it looks good! I can only attribute such a tiny filesize to the inherent compressibility of animation, and most espicially of cheap animation. Which this is. The cheaper the animation, the better it compresses, and you don't get much cheaper than this.

Contains Robin Williams rapping. Exercise caution when listening.
