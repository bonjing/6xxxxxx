,tannerman,2011-07-15T21:32Z,"missing 10 minutes, 20 scenes cut.
this is not the complete movie

runtime 1h 57 min
real runtime (excluding the credits) 2h 10 min"
,tannerman,2011-07-15T21:33Z,"WARNING: this one has cuts all over it.
first cut i noticed was arround the 2 min mark when the goblin should reply something like ""i'm alive""
but it just skips that. god knows what else been cut.

with all those cuts this movie is not complete.
all releases are 1h 57 min, while it should be 2h 10 min (excluding the credits) "

,hadza2390,2011-07-15T22:39Z,"so tannerman, in these busy times i didnt follow up, u are saying there are some missing scenes ? How many ? and missing 10 minutes credit ?"
,tannerman,2011-07-15T23:05Z,"read my earlier post. i wrote that the movie should be 2h 10 min, excluding  the credits. excluding and including are two different words - look them up.

i also told you one scene that was cut. i've seen more cuts. the cuts seem to be pretty obvious as the conversations gets ruined in the film."
,rcr29budcar,2011-07-16T00:51Z,"tannerman, instead of complaining why don't you upload a ""masterpiece"" copy of this so called ""masterpiece"" for us, you douche bag.  This is the same as every other torrent for every single other movie released this summer. They start out bad and get better a couple weeks later. Thanks for the warning, but we don't need it you fucking idiot!  You are a bot, i mean troll. Like i said in an earlier post, I shouldn't feed you, but i can't help myself. Sometimes people are so ignorant that I can't stand it. U R NOT HELPING ANYONE!!! SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!! The people who have been here for more than a week don't care, you are a thorn in the side of humanity! GO AWAY YOU TROLL!"
,rcr29budcar,2011-07-16T00:58Z,"tannerman

,tannerman,2011-07-16T02:52Z,"rcr29budcar@
