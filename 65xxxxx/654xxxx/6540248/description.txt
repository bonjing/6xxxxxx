Mortal Kombat: Legacy is an American web series anthology that debuted on Machinima.com's YouTube channel on April 11, 2011. The show is an adaptation of the fictional universe of the Mortal Kombat video game franchise. The show's premise originated with director Kevin Tancharoen's short film entitled Mortal Kombat: Rebirth, portraying the original game's story in a realistic way, a concept he eventually submitted to Warner Bros. seeking the green-light for production on a re-imagined Mortal Kombat film. Warner Bros. declined to back the film, despite the attention and positive fan reception, but Tancharoen did receive the go-ahead to shoot the web series.

Mortal Kombat: Legacy takes place before the events of the first tournament and tells the background stories of several characters from the franchise, culminating in their reasons for participating in the upcoming tenth Mortal Kombat tournament, on which the first game was based. The series is a non-linear anthology, with each episode independent of the rest, and devoted to the story of a specific character or characters.
