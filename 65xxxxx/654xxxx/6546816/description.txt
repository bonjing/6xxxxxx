Obtained from some guy on Freenet. Seems to work fine. And it's a very, very, very good game. Dreamfall was a bit of a let down, but The Longest Journey has to be one of the master-works of the adventure genre.

I'm not even going to try to summarise the plot here. Suffice to say that if you like adventure games, or just enjoy seeing an absorbing story in a compelling fantasy world, this is a must-play.
