,Comrade71,2011-07-22T20:11Z,"I have always respected the time and effort people take to upload TV shows, movies, sporting events and I still do respect them of course.
I have to say this is the slowest torrent I've downloaded in 4 years though, I notice that there are 50 other people like me stuck on or around 85.6%. I have to ask, why upload the torrent and then not even allow at least a few people to complete the download so they can seed? As far as I can see nobody has the full download, aside from dalpreston who originally upped it.  That's annoying, sorry but it is."

The other Man United game has been seeded correctly and there is no problem with that one."
,mastrotheoris,2011-07-22T20:13Z,you know that i only need half an hour or less to complete the download and the original uploader doesnt even give us that
