,D-Raven,2011-08-27T14:41Z,"im having serious graphincal problems with the game.
i just get blue pixels blockign the veiw the whole time.
ive got a Intel quad-core sytem with ati HD 5830 card.
please help!! always wanted to play it."
,Cerebral222,2011-08-29T09:11Z,"@D-Raven, You seem to have the right hardware, the only thing I can think of is video codecs, you may need to tweak the codec bundle so that the game renders properly. K-lite mega pack is what I use & I have no issues, I use a simple 1Gig GeForce 210 graphics card with 2.66 core 2 duo & ran the game on several PCs, hope you can fix the issue, as it's a good game, Cheers."

,Cerebral222,2011-10-21T13:48Z,"@ ggf162, read the instructions above, if you try to launch it with the RUNTIME32.exe it won't work, launch the game with the Runtime.exe, I've noted this in a file titled README 2 START.
Game will kick over."
,kdawg1488,2011-12-09T03:51Z,"Everything works fine except that I'm getting a delayed/buggy keystroke issue - I press a button and it takes half a second for the game to respond, and if I hold down a key the action does not stop when I want it to. This basically stops me from playing the game, unfortunately. The mouse appears to be working properly - can change to first person view without a problem unless the previous action issued by a keystroke is still going, i.e. it works fine unless inhibited by the buggy keystrokes.

,girtas_123,2012-04-10T22:10Z,"Anyone experiencing graphics-related issues should create a shortcut to RUNTIME32.exe and add CONFIG to the end of the shortcut's target line like this:
""C:GamesOmikron The Nomad SoulRUNTIME32.EXE"" CONFIG
Then that shortcut will open up a menu to select a video driver and display resolution. Also, Nomad Soul wouldn't start correctly until I set Compatibility to Windows 98 for Runtime.exe (My system is Windows 7 64bit). Hope this helps somebody :)"
,tpb3571,2012-04-11T06:16Z,it keeps asking me to put in a CD.  I used the patched exe and used another from gamecopyworld too.  wat gives?  i'm on win 7 64 bit.  ran exe in compat mode and still nothing
,Razamea,2012-05-10T00:56Z,"Hey guys can't solve the graphics problem through anything, anybody with the same problem ? Cheers "
