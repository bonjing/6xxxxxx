Can you tell what the differences are? 
Thank you"
,LBtrw,2011-07-24T00:04Z,I see this torrent has the Office 2010 Toolkit included. Can anyone confirm this activation method working as of recently? I'll make a post when I'm done installing.
,LBtrw,2011-07-24T00:47Z,"Alrighty, here is how it went!

-Disconnect Internet
-Mount ISO
 =Install Successful
-Run Office Toolkit 2010
 =Choose EZ Activator
 ==Success 100% Activated!
-Unmount ISO
-Reconnect Internet
 =Win.


INFO:
Don't know why MusicProAppz didn't label the torrent name with a x64. Yes, this is the 64bit version with SP1. It works fine.
--------------------------------------------
Malware Byte is saying the KMS Service is a theat. It also shows the Office Tool Kit as a hack tool but that is fine. I had no problems with this torrent aside from the KMS Service. Maybe someone can confirm the service is not a threat? 

Good luck!"

,featureza,2011-09-13T04:59Z,How do you start the EZ Activator?
,Vicar in a Tutu,2011-09-25T17:34Z,"If Office has to 'Configure' every time you run it, do this:

Start > Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt (right-click and 'Run as administrator')

Copy and paste the following line:
secedit /configure /cfg %windir%\inf\defltbase.inf /db defltbase.sdb /verbose

Close and reboot PC."
,tp3366,2011-09-25T17:44Z,Is this ISO untouched ?
