Thanx mate. i'm a huge fan. I was just wondering if the source is Scorp's from 300mbunited cuz i already downloaded his TLOR movies. PLS lemme know ASAP"
,agent000,2011-07-24T12:52Z,"@Pan43bros

just download & install the latest version of VLC Player..."
,agent000,2011-07-24T12:55Z,"@shawnrhbk

look at the description... 
the source is...
The Lord of the Rings Trilogy EXTENDED 720p BRRip, [A Release-Lounge H264]"
,Pan43bros,2011-07-24T13:23Z,"@agent000 The Two Towers and Return of the King both play just fine
Fellowship wont start :)"
,agent000,2011-07-24T14:46Z,"@Pan43bros

hmm... well i downloaded it... all of them work fine... i use the latest version of Media Player Classic... btw i just finished watching Fellowship of the Ring :)"
,deBeauharnais,2011-07-26T21:15Z,"Thanks, but... The sound is a horrible shame... 40kbps is not enough at all.
Most movies have 500kbps, and sometimes 1,5Mbps.
So the music and the sound of battle will be awful. White noise, saturation. A shame for this kind of great movie with epic music. If you don't believe me, download the sample and check it.

Video: 7 (for a compressed 720p)
Audio: 3
Movie: 10"
,sundarcse,2011-07-27T05:35Z,"thanks man
great quality

,Pan43bros,2011-07-29T21:32Z,yea man the sound has problems but cheers to the uploader 
,sundarcse,2011-07-30T06:05Z,"deBeauharnais, go and buy bluray"

Audio could have been @ 128kbps.
Sample video has better quality than the the Movie!!!!!"
,critic89,2011-08-08T03:49Z,"@all..i guess StyLishSaLH wil not mind it

video - 7
sound - 5
video is somewhat boxxy and pixilated, even when not in full screen.
sound has some fuzz to it"
,BlacKRaiN_666,2012-03-14T19:44Z,"Accept the opinion of whatever review you choose and download or don't, but for 3 very long movies @ high resolution at under 3 GB, you probably won't find a better quality rip of it."
