Every action in SQL Server â€“ queries, updates, whatever â€“ leaves a set of tiny footprints; SQL Server records all that valuable data and makes it visible through Dynamic Management Views, or DMVs. A DBA or developer can use this incredibly detailed information to significantly improve the performance of queries and better understand whatâ€™s really going on inside a SQL Server system."
