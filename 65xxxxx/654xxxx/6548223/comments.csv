,GYMMY,2011-07-18T04:25Z,need a password to open?
,xenoFLASH,2011-07-18T06:00Z,no password
,mortis9,2011-07-18T07:15Z,There is no need to use .rar for a video.  I think most of us are reluctant to trust torrents that unnecessarily compress and split files.  
,tiss2,2011-07-18T23:21Z,Why do trur Blood files always show up as Invalid file on my PlayonHD?? This does not happen to any other show and I'm getting a bit sick of it. Why don't they just upload normal files?
,mortis9,2011-07-19T01:02Z,I don't care who (claims to have) posted the torrent.  There is no need to employ .rar or .zip for a single video file.  It's shady and that's all there is to it.
,infermon,2011-07-19T10:34Z,It's not 6 channel. It's 2. Never found a 5.1 track for any true bloods this season.
,dacarlo,2011-07-27T11:15Z,"@mortis9 They're released in the original format they came from (The Scene). If you don't like it, wait for one of the other releases that someone unrars from this one and then posts here.

@tiss2 If you paid for your player then I feel sorry for you. Go grab VLC or Media Player Classic. Either will play anything. Neither cost anything."
