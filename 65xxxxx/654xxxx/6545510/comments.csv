,NL_MOVIE_CATCHER,2011-07-16T18:37Z,what did telesync mean?
,hootieman,2011-07-16T19:17Z,"better than Cam is what TS is, and still missing scenes"
,El-solo,2011-07-16T22:33Z,"No, actually TS is transport screen which is completely different from telesync"
,El-solo,2011-07-16T22:34Z,Telesync means its actually a bootleg recording....transport screen or (TS) means its higher quality than a CAM.  So don't expect any better quality than a CAM with telesync being that they are virtually the same thing
,takeaimnfire,2011-07-20T11:49Z,"Dude, the only missing scene is Voldemort grabbing the Elder wand.  Which is the end of the first part.  No need to show it, and the goblin saying ""I'm alive."".  Got cut somehow too.  It's not missing any actual scenes at all besides the replay of Voldemort before the WB logo.  Not a big deal for a free download the day after the movie was out.  Plus the only reason it's probably even missing that is because the way the movie starts in the theaters after the previews.  It just jumps to Voldemort in the tomb without warning."
