NOTE: Yes, I know, another zip program - what makes this one unique is that archives are created for either MAC or PC platform, so if you only want MAC users to be able to open the archive you can select the MAC option.  Fortunately for MAC users, it can also read the PC zip files.

Longer Description:

YemuZip is an easy-to-use app for making zip files. Just drag, drop, name your zip file and you're done.

Mac OS X's built-in compress function makes zip files that contains Mac specific information that, when extracted on a PC, looks like garbage. YemuZip lets you choose between a PC-friendly format and a Mac format that preserve all the Mac-specific metadata.

YemuZip remembers your recently chosen destination folders. This allows you to quickly output the zip file to your iDisk or Dropbox, for example. YemuZip can also place the resulting zip file directly in an email.

System Requirements:

Intel Mac X.5 or better
