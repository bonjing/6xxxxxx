The Encore Westerns collection of WAGON TRAIN cuts short with 
the 24th episode of the 4th Season "The Nancy Palmer Story".  
They went back to Season 1 again last Friday, because that's 
where that syndication package ends.  

The next episode after that "The Christopher Hale Story" 
is the one in which John McIntire became the new wagonmaster, 
where Lee Marvin guest starred. Unfortunately that's the first 
episode that nobody seems to have. 

This and the next 4 episodes that I previously skipped posting, 
are because they have John in the opening credits. 
He isn't in any of these though.

We'll just have to wait till the Season 4 DVD set comes out 
to see the last 14 episodes of that year.


Guest Stars --- Ernest Borgnine and Edward Binns
