,gdtweeker,2011-09-03T05:10Z,Assassin's creed works fine on my kyocera Echo(android 2.3.4). i wish it would work in dual screen mode but single screen is fine. i also tried modern combat and splinter cell but they didn't work. i'll try the other ones later and write back. That just shows people that some games will work on other devices than the Samsung GT-i9100 Galaxy S II.
,gdtweeker,2011-09-03T06:25Z,brothers in arms also works on the kyocera echo(android 2.3.4). sherkkart does not.

,Attictron,2011-09-13T04:18Z,"It seems a lot of people are having trouble or dont know how to install these. 

1)First download ES File explorer from the Android market place.

2) Go into Settings > Applications and check Unknown Sources.

3) Open up ES File Explorer and navigate to the folder where you loaded the games and install.

This is method allows you to install any apk that is not from the market. Most games work great on my Motorola Triumph."
,kbowk2,2011-09-17T08:57Z,Cheers Attictron that info will be helpful.  I have a new Acer tablet and S2 Galaxy and I'm cheap.
,loveinthespace,2011-09-29T22:41Z,Thanks .BONE. for the games. Totally appreciated.

,qpr10,2011-10-25T17:07Z,"This looks very dodgy to me, the permissions dont match up with the same games on the marketplace, all the ones I looked at have permission to send and receive text messages so Id avoid installing them."

,ChrisM47,2011-12-19T05:10Z,Not that I'm not grateful for your uploads BONE I just don't get why they ask for those kind of permissions seems fishy no?
,changeHD,2011-12-27T06:05Z,"People, you can alter the permissions of the apk file if you use Root Explorer or something similar. You have to move the apk to your systems\app folder and enable Read/Write options. Long press on the apk and choose ""permissions"". I do it all the time on my tablet."
,thiagotnn,2012-01-03T15:39Z,@changeHD How i can change the apk. permissions in my Galaxy SII??

,.scotty.,2012-06-01T14:14Z,"Thanks for the upload people regarding huge extra downloads after install, come on you expect a game of quality to be only say 8mb. Its needs the extra data this is what makes the game so gooood. Dont worry about the permissions either because they are all the same as the apo stor."
,Normm,2012-06-03T11:09Z,I wouldn't install the majority of these APKs if you piad me. They are obviously dodgie as they need permission to send SMS. Why? The Apps in the Play Store DO NOT require this permission to send SMSs so you'd have to be an idiot to install these. .scotty. seems to be one of these...
,Normm,2012-06-03T11:10Z,I wouldn't install the majority of these APKs if you paid me. They are obviously dodgie as they need permission to send SMS. Why? The Apps in the Play Store DO NOT require this permission to send SMSs so you'd have to be an idiot to install these. .scotty. seems to be one of these...
,Normm,2012-06-03T11:12Z,Yout an idiot .scotty.. None of these apps should need permission to send SMS messages. Obviously all have hidden nasties.
