,mxfanboy,2011-07-17T17:05Z,"My mistake, i was encoding the 450 moto while recording the 250. Looks like my computer is not fast enough.
It should affect the first half of the 250 moto only. The rest of it is the web quality offerded by allisport."

,micklemack,2011-07-18T11:03Z,"Thanks for uploading Gr8t to complement the work of Slicknick!
Thanks for spliting up the files, as my downloads from thirdworld country mean I can just download the 450's - single 2gb file would like take 6 days wrather than 3!"

Keep up the good work."
,micklemack,2011-07-25T08:20Z,"I changed the file name to .mp4 before would play. When play it would stutter.
This was the 450 didn't download 250 which you mention stutter should effect half of it.
I have not had this problem with slicknick, perhaps it is the way it is encoded??"
