Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Global History - Volume I 

The most widely read history of art in the English language for more than 80 years, Gardner has built its stellar reputation on the inclusion of the most significant images and monuments, discussions of these images in their full historical and cultural context, reproductions of unsurpassed quality, scholarship that is up-to-date and deep, and more help for students and instructors than any other survey text. The 13th Edition adds to this heritage with new images and new full-color reconstructions, as well as a unique "scale" feature that helps students visualize the size of each work.
