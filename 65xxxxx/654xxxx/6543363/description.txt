     A memorably bizarre screen version of Lewis Carroll's novel     
     'Alice in Wonderland', mixing one live actor (Alice) with a     
     huge variety of sinister animated puppets, ranging from the     
     complex (the White Rabbit) to the incredibly simple (the        
     Caterpillar, consisting of a sock, a couple of glass eyes and   
     a pair of false teeth). The original story is followed          
     reasonably faithfully, though those familiar with this          
     director's other films won't be the least bit surprised by the  
     numerous digressions into Svankmajer territory, living slabs    
     of meat and all. As the opening narration says, it's a film     
     made for children... perhaps?
