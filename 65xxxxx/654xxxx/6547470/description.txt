Ubehage's EasyCopy (Beta)
-------------------------

Here comes a new application in the EasyTools-series: EasyCopy!

This application is designed to make it easy to handle your everyday backups, moving around with files, etc..

These features already exist. Why would I make an application just for that ?
This application is designed for planning also.
You can make plans for all the operations you wish to perform, and start them on your command.

Bleah... I suck at describing stuff! :)
See for yourself, screenshots below.
