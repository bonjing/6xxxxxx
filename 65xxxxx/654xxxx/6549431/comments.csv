,PESSO114,2011-07-19T09:32Z,does it contain all the aircrafts? and is it better then adobe ai traffic?
,aarque,2011-07-19T15:49Z,"hahahahaha - too funny. Normally I would flame ""freeware!"" but in light of the recent UT2 lock-up - until we get our hands on hotfix 2.09 - this and MyTraffic appear to be the only viable alternatives. Plus credit should be given for the effort of the compilation. Not pirated, but potentially a Pirate Bay exclusive."

,SQ328,2011-07-27T07:14Z,"WoAI is good but not complete. There are several airlines they are not allowed to do, such as BMI and FlyBE. A good complete alternative is  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5133129/FS2004-Morten__s_AI_Traffic_2.2"
