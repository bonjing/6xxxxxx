,emolund,2011-07-16T09:41Z,This is the same GM wich has been posted here several times before. As Apple has announced some bugfixes before the final release there is no need to download this.
,emolund,2011-07-16T09:49Z,"And besides that. Who wants to download a version wich is customized by you?
I would not."
,ClassZero,2011-07-16T18:22Z,"Dupe and useless. Keep your custom trash.

I am waiting for the REAL GM 2
"
,mnfesq,2011-07-16T18:49Z,The real GM2?  I don't think there will be any more GM versions.  The real deal is due to come out any day.  What customizations did you make to this?  Did you make it installable on MBR partitions?  Did you add an Extra folder with kexts for OSx86?  You set yourself up for criticism by not explaining what you did.

Some kind of java problem. "
,RyMikel,2011-07-16T21:44Z,"I didn't customize the GM, the GM is untouched. The same OS I've been running since it was released. I just customized the look of the dmg. Also, they won't be releasing ANOTHER GM, as Apple doesn't do stupid things like that. This is the final version, just originally released for devs."
,ClassZero,2011-07-17T03:34Z,Do your homework mnfesq before you speak. http://www.lovefortech.com/2011/07/15/mac-os-x-lion-delayed/
,mnfesq,2011-07-17T21:03Z,"Good read, ClassZero.  I was wondering what caused the delay in its release.  I'm not sure, though, whether Apple will release the rumored GM2 or just fix the bug and release the final version since it is already mid-July.  I highly doubt Apple will push the release of the final version into August."
