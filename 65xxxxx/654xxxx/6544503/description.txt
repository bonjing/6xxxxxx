Subscribe to me on youtube(RyMikelPro) , this is my customized dmg of mac os x 10.7. If you need any help with installation, as I said, I am on youtube and i have uploaded videos of using this. Take note that this is a GM, but a GM is the same as the final version, just for devs. So, no you don't need to install this then go and buy the $30 application on the 26th. Just install this and that's it!
