Will Stockdale is a country bumpkin drafted into the Air Force and too dumb to realize he's driving everyone around him crazy -- no one more than Sgt. King.

I didn't rip this film but downloaded it from Rapidshare. It wasn't easy to find this film so I thought I'd share.

I don't have any details on video or audio codecs or other specs. The quality is decent for the file size and it plays perfectly.
