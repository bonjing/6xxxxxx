Up All Night" was the first song Blink-182 wrote and recorded after their reunion in February 2009. The song was planned for release as a single in July 2009, but withheld because the band felt it was not complete. On July 12, 2011, the band announced the song would premiere on July 15. On July 14, Mark Hoppus announced it would premiere later that day.

It's the first song by the group since their 2005 song "Not Now".
