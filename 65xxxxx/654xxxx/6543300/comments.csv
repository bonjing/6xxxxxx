,Musikal_Enigmatic,2011-07-25T00:39Z,Fuck I'm gonna learn Russian to tell ppl to seed
,Zombeye6,2011-07-29T21:29Z,"In the PDF after install, I'm on page 14 of 43 (adding a language)  I followed all the steps exactly, but I don't get step 15, when I click on add a language it just asks me to insert the language cd, and I can't get past that.  Any suggestions?"
,AGISCI,2011-07-30T06:12Z,You need to mount the .iso language file for it to be seen by the rosetta stone program. I included a software called pismo that can do this. Or you can use your own.
,ryuu1209,2011-08-03T08:00Z,"When I get past a certain point in the language lessons, the program won't let me continue without an activation code. Suggestions?"
,AGISCI,2011-08-03T22:12Z,"Did you copy the crack into the program folder? If you forgot to do that, it will only be a demo. You have to copy the crack to unlock the whole language."
,charb1616,2011-08-04T07:16Z,"I noticed you tagged this with ""mac,"" does it work for Mac?"
,charb1616,2011-08-04T07:21Z,"I just downloaded this for mac but the install file opens in textedit.  I'm a newbie at this, can you please help."
,ryuu1209,2011-08-04T08:46Z,I thought I did but I guess I'll just have to redownload and try again just to be sure. Thanks much. Aside from this problem the torrent works perfectly for both mac and pc in case anyone was wondering.
,charb1616,2011-08-04T09:21Z,"Never mind, my computer was being completely retarded."
,illbcnul8r,2011-08-04T15:22Z,This has a virus.  Windows defender will find it.  Found it unlocking Dutch level 3 but may be in more than one file.
,D3DLYA1M,2011-08-06T21:14Z,"Im having problems installing the language packet. I mounted it to a virutal drive but the rosetta stone program freezes (Not Responding) i've let it stay there for about 5 minutes and nothing. I close out of rosetta stone and I get a pop up ""My Flash Application is not responding"" with 2 options to close or to wait. what should I do?"
,AGISCI,2011-08-06T23:44Z,"illbcnul8r, if you read the rosetta stone official website, they state that mcaffe and a few other antiviruses give false positives to certain languages. So either you can trust the offical rosetta stone website and make an exception in your anti virus software, or you can be sceptical and don't use it. The choice will be up to you.

I had my antivirus(trend micro) say the same to me. I had to put an exception to take care of it just like the rosetta stone website told me to."
,lolita12,2011-08-07T15:56Z,hi guys- I am very new to this and I'm not at all sure how to get this file to work- if someone could explain how to use this torrent I would greatly appreciate it! thanks :)
,Moridigh,2011-08-08T10:29Z,I'll post once I get it my 'review' like if it works and all that cause theres ALOT of question comments x)...
,wellwet,2011-08-08T11:16Z,Looking for Russian L4-L5 :( 
,Moridigh,2011-08-08T15:34Z,Thank you it works great...  Just gotta the instructions closely other wise its not different from ANY other Cracked program. 
,zalor,2011-08-11T15:38Z,"Yeah, Im getting the problem at the language install too. I tried to rename the image ""Spanish (Latin America) - Level 1"" but it wouldnt let me save the iso. . . so I saved as a dif iso with name that the actual iso file is called and it still wouldnt install. I dont know whats going wrong, i know i cracked it correctly... any suggestions AGISCI?"
,sunshineb13,2011-08-11T20:00Z,does anyone have the RS thai v3? i have rs 3.4.7 and i can't seem to find one compatible. can someone msg me and help me get it?
,AGISCI,2011-08-11T20:50Z,You do not need to rename or modify the .iso to get this to work. You need to mount the language. You can either use the software I included to do so or your own software. If you look in the installation folder for windows there is a file that shows how to install the program as well as the langauges.
,cyprus666,2011-08-13T18:00Z,"I miss 
English 4 and 5 ....
Greek 4 and 5 ....
maybee you can updated? Thanks "
,cyprus666,2011-08-13T18:03Z,I mean English (british) 4 and 5
,cyprus666,2011-08-13T18:08Z,I miss English (british) 4 and 5  and Greek 4 and 5 maybee you can it updated?
,AGISCI,2011-08-14T19:59Z,That was a typo the greek 4 and 5 and british 4 and 5 do not exist. However I could not edit the torrent to fix the typo. The pirate bay would not allow me to.
,cyprus666,2011-08-14T21:50Z,Thanks a lot... your Progamm works very well. You give the best instruction. Thanks for your work.
,ektopac,2011-08-16T02:52Z,"i mounted the language with the program you included but when i open rosetta stone i click add language, then continue and it says it cant find the language cd. i followed all your instructions correctly and copied the crack and everything but it just wont add the level. whats going wrong? i mounted it right."
,Drums_Sax_N_Violins,2011-08-16T09:06Z,"well done AGISCI !
you are a credit to the world pal !"
,bhawkbly,2011-08-18T14:22Z,"Following the instructions listed, i get all language packs set that i wanted to, but when i d/c from internet and hit continue, it just keeps searching for updates, even when i hit cancel, any help?"
,lilrhyser,2011-08-22T23:01Z,"Hi, does this contain audio files i can stick on my ipod? Thankyou"
,AGISCI,2011-08-23T16:19Z,"No, it does not include audio files for the ipod or other mp3 players."
,thelung,2011-08-27T06:46Z,"ektopac, I'm assuming that you are running windows 7?  If so, it is actually your operating system.  You will need to either reinstall your windows 7 and reinstall rosetta stone before you chew up your OS with bloatware, or install windows xp and use rosetta stone with that.  XP is a much more solid platform (as solid as windows can get, at least).  If not windows 7, I have no advice to offer."
,bwv565,2011-08-30T18:02Z,tnx a lot!!!
,Kartos,2011-09-02T16:16Z,"I can't install on my windows 7 prof, please help...!"
,tripp2776,2011-09-03T03:39Z,"I do not want to make a mistake so I will ask ahead of time, Is it ok to load more than 1 language and lesson at a time or will it mess it up like some of the other cracks? Thanks for the upload!"
,JumboJim18,2011-09-08T23:10Z,"I am also unable to install this, on Windows 7. Unknown whether this is through my own stupidity or an actual computer error. Tried both the Program Installer and Updater."
,JumboJim18,2011-09-08T23:11Z,"I am also unable to install this, on Windows 7. Unknown whether this is through my own stupidity or an actual computer error. Tried both the Program Installer and Updater. An error occurs before installation finishes."
,JumboJim18,2011-09-08T23:34Z,"Everytime I install this, (using the Program Installer) the installation fails, and has to roll back the operation. Not sure why. I'm using Windows 7. The compatibility is set to Windows XP and is unable to be changed. Just wondering what's up."
,Kartos,2011-09-09T15:22Z,"Work with windows 7 XP Mode, but i don't want to come back to windows XP. Can someone give me a solution?"
,BigMan1972,2011-09-14T03:51Z,"First, thanks for the upload. Secondly,if you could recopy the original disc for JP lvl 1 because when i try to install it the program crashes and I'm forced to restart my computer. This happens on win vista and XP. Every other language Ive installed (French 1-5,German1-5,russian1-3,korean1-3,chinese1-3,and Japanese 2&3)works properly and hasn't had any issues so far. If someone has a fix for this instead, use that. Thanks in advance.

P.S.  Ive used other JP lvl 1s to no avail

TL;dr - thanks. Also, JP lvl1 doesn't install. Any ideas"
,BigMan1972,2011-09-20T05:00Z,"Ughhh..... This is what I get for having a friend type up a comment for me. THE ERRORS...

Anyway, what was meant to be said was ""Secondly, if you could, please recopy the original disc for JP lvl 1 and upload it because..."" and ""If someone has a fix for this, I'll use that instead.""

In addition, I also need to correct myself because I did look again on my Rosetta Stone and found out that I didn't install German 1-5 yet, but I also have the same problem with Germans 3 & 4. Again, if someone could tell me what's wrong and has a remedy that can help me fix it, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks in advance."
,roflman1,2011-09-30T06:47Z,"I love this! I'm seeding right now and have uploaded 25 gigs. This is probably my favorite torrent. I'm halfway through disk 1 of Spanish. All I had to do was mount and install the installation CD, mount each level I wanted to install, then click them from the menu in the program. THANK YOU!!! You've done the world a great favor."
,cabot97,2011-09-30T19:12Z,"Exxcellent Torrent !! Everything works GREAT ! I mounted the ISO's with both UltraISO and Daemon Tools and they all worked flawlessly. Anybody who 'can't' get this working should 'read' the instructions; its all there in black and white. If you know how to use Daemon tools or UltraISO, this should work !"
,DarkMessiahFIN,2011-10-10T17:39Z,"Hi. I have a problem with this on Win7. I installed the program (in XP mode) nd crack just as instructed, and everything works fine, languages install nicely etc. and I get trough the  update search and ""never update""-choise, but after that, the screen is blank, I don't get to make profile or anything. How can I get this to work?"
,Adrianperu,2011-10-23T01:01Z,Agisci you are an amazing guy. Even an idiot proof help file and mounter. Great torrent and it works really well. Downloaded clean and have seeded 1.5G so far Muchas Gracias.
,keepulookin,2011-10-30T05:38Z,"everything was fine until i got to page 14. instead of getting a window asking to add a language level, i get an error: 
2125 
Database is out of date and could not be updated. Please contact Customer Support. See your Quick Start card or visit www.RosettaStone.com/Support for contact information. Exit the Application. 

trying to figure out what i did wrong, but re-did it twice with this same result. "
,keepulookin,2011-10-30T05:48Z,nm...must have been one of those freak things. clicked on the shortcut a 4th time and got it to go. thanks agisci!
,buba077,2011-11-13T08:19Z,This is the perfect torrent that I've ever shot down. You accept my most genuine thanks !!!!!
,kyle315beans,2011-11-18T00:46Z,i must be an idiot because i cant figure out how to load the language. i have windows 7 and i cant figure it out. any help?
,newton8573,2011-12-12T08:29Z,"31 gig gee
Lets hope this one works

Does anyone have Rosetta Stone Version 4 TOTALe ?
It was released September 14, 2010. Can somebody please crack it already ?

Must be some skilled cracker out there that can."
,coolerpc,2012-02-11T20:46Z,"Oh God, Thank YOU VERY VERY MUCH!"
,AdamantiumAngel,2012-03-05T07:05Z,"Very nice, looks good.. Gotta lie low on the torrenting for a while though."
,amayzer,2012-04-24T15:37Z,"I have NOT downloaded this torrent so I can't speak to the errors you are getting. Here are solutions to common problems:

Windows 7 installation errors: Right-click on the installer and change the compatibility mode to Windows 2003 Server (Service Pack 1).

Error 2123: Run Rosetta Stone as Administrator for the first time.

Error 2125 - database out of date: Go to C:ProgramDataRosetta Stone and rename tracking.db3 but do not delete.

CD mounting errors: Plug a USB thumb drive into your computer. Erase it fully, then copy the full contents of the language CD you want to install to the USB drive. When Rosetta Stone asks to put CD in drive, just click Continue.

Other errors: Read the directions again. If you can't follow the directions, give up and buy Rosetta Stone."
,keibafan,2012-05-11T03:08Z,You've included 1 to 5 for some languages - bravo!
,kamo11kamo,2012-05-24T14:26Z,Please why you did not upload Kurdish Language???? really all Kurdish people waiting that from you Dear... Thanks for read and hope to care about that if you have time... Thanks.
