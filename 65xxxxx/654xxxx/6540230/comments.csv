,dkhere,2011-07-15T03:45Z,Ok... Thanks for the movie...
,8feet,2011-08-14T18:08Z,The audio is off (delayed) on Conan the Barbarian when watched in VLC and Quicktime.
,bikerbish,2011-08-18T09:49Z,"Just downloaded, (very quick, thanks to seeders), can't find any faults, either on my computer using VLC, or on our 50"" LED TV

THANKS ILPruny"
,cironde,2011-08-23T22:05Z,"i'm not saying that the uploader is to blame or anything, but i just received an email from my isp passing on an email from NBC stating copyright infringement for this title. fortunately  i was just warned to delete the file and stop downloading copyrighted material.  just fair warning that this MAY be a watched torrent."
,Gipson,2011-08-25T11:03Z,AWESOME! watched these on TV the other day and still loved em. i think the new reboot movie will be good but it can't in any way triumph the classics!
,H4LFB4CKS,2011-08-28T09:57Z,Hey cironde - GO FUCK YOURSELF!!!
,bigdrago,2011-09-04T12:35Z,Why not upload it in 1080p? Most people have 1080p :)
,joker71172,2011-09-06T18:57Z,"10A/10V on my 47""Philips....no problems,thanx ILPruny!"
,Ki1l4U,2011-09-19T05:15Z,"Thanks for the tip cironde, wtf is wrong with you H4LFB4CKS?"
,Arch4ng3l,2011-09-20T18:26Z,"cironde: This is normal, it has nothing to do with the torrent itself, it's just company hired to watch copyright issues and all that shit, so they monitor torrents, save IPs from seeder/leecher lists and send emails to owner ISPs , but that is pretty much all they can do, send silly letters."
,majalogan,2011-09-23T01:50Z,"WARNING: unsynched first movie, didnt watch the second, using VLC

and yeah cironde stop scuttling like a bitch"
,bragazar1710,2011-11-17T14:24Z,thanks.
,PauloFran,2012-05-06T00:06Z,"Video quality is reasonable. It could be better.
Thank you anyway for the uploads."
