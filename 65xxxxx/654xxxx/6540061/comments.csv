,MrHulkkis,2011-07-14T18:13Z,some seeds would be nice :d
[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-14T18:35Z,"@MrH:
Unfortunately the majority of people who DL do NOT seed back, and it takes TPB a while to register those who do. Seeder/Leecher #'s are often inaccurate."

[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-14T20:11Z,"This is the other one and it is well seeded [ignore TPB #'s]:
