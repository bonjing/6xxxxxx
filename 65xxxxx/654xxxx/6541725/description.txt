 The future of the World Wide Web depended on its ability to understand and automatically process content to enable computers and people to work in cooperation. New advanced techniques and intelligent approaches are required more than ever to transform the Web into a universal reasoning and semantic-driven computing machine.
 The Web intelligence discipline attempts to deal with this challenge by exploits information technologies and artificial intelligence approaches to design next generation of web-empowered systems and services. The â€˜Emergent Web Intelligence: Advanced Semantic Technologies" book provides valuable references and cuttingâ€“edge technologies for: undergraduate and postgraduate students who are studying Web Intelligence and Semantic Web courses, developers who need to design innovative approaches by applying different emergent semantic techniques to real-world problems, researchers who seek to understand the state of the art and foresee future research strategies in Web Intelligence and Semantic Web.
 The book is organized in self-contained chapters to provide greatest reading flexibility.
