        A  thrill-seeking hunter  (Brian Brown  - Risk  and Cocktail)
        brings  his son  Harry along  on an  expedition to  capture a
        grizzly  bear. With  Indian tracker  (Tom Jackson  - Medicine
        River) and  jaded hunting  colleague played  by Oliver  Tobias
        (Breeders and The Brycreem Boys) in tow, it isn't long  before
        they seize a pair of  cubs. Upon finding her kids  tied-up and
        caged, the mother bear in turn abducts young Harry.

        While the hunting party conducts their search, the boy manages
        to forge a trusting alliance with the beast. However, it isn't
        long before they're  discovered, and a  musunderstanding leads
        to a  brutal battle.  When father  and son  rally to  help the
        bear, they discover how much they really care for each other.
