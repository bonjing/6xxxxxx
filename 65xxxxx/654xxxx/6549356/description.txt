The Austin garage soul band has a few tricks up its sleeve

It would be easy for Black Joe Lewis to allow himself to become a novelty.

The fact is, in a decade dominated by effects and autotune, a rough-and-tumble bluesman who howls away and plays three chords is a rarity. Itâ€™s why terms like â€œretroâ€ and â€œthrowbackâ€ got tossed around when Lewis and his group, the Honeybears, burst onto the scene in 2009 with Tell â€™Em What Your Name Is!. But Lewis has always been more than a one-trick pony, and itâ€™s never been more apparent than on his sophomore album, Scandalous.

Sure, heâ€™s got the hard-living, woman-chasing schtick down pat: On â€œMustang Ranchâ€ he recounts the time he visited a brothel and paid $20 to get his (ahem) â€œham glazed.â€ â€œBooty Cityâ€ is a rollicking good time, and letâ€™s just say â€œBlack Snakeâ€ is not about a reptile. But if you listen closely, youâ€™ll hear funky background vocals, tales of true heartbreak and even a love song amidst all the scandal.

The group manages to blend its influences so effectively that songs with full horn sections somehow sound stripped-down, and itâ€™s clear that Scandalous is a stronger record than Tell â€™Em. Lewis, who didnâ€™t pick up a guitar until age 20, demonstrates his growing musical prowess, the Honeybears sound tighter, and perhaps most importantly, the album never falls victim to gimmicks. Scandalous isnâ€™t a throwback, itâ€™s a throw forward.
