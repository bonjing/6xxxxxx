Compact Modeling: Principles, Techniques and Applications

 Most of the recent texts on compact modeling are limited to a particular class of semiconductor devices and do not provide comprehensive coverage of the field. Having a single comprehensive reference for the compact models of most commonly used semiconductor devices (both active and passive) represents a significant advantage for the reader. Indeed, several kinds of semiconductor devices are routinely encountered in a single IC design or in a single modeling support group.
