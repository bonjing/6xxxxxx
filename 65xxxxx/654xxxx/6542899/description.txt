From Publishers Weekly Genre-bending anthologists Kelly and Kessel (Rewired) select a wide range of post-1970 stories by authors who occupy the nebulous land between literary and genre. Offerings like Margaret Atwoodâ€™s Homelanding, a vignette about alien life, and Steven Millhauserâ€™s The Wizard of West Orange, which conclusively demonstrates that any story centering around a new science is science fiction, make it clear that nongenre authors have been writing stories that appropriate many genre tropes. But while the title will attract genre fans, li-fi readers who might otherwise be drawn in by T.C. Boyle and Don DeLillo may well be put off by the Tachyon imprint and the words science fiction, undermining the editorsâ€™ assertion that the walls that separate the mainstream from science fiction are, in fact, crumbling.
