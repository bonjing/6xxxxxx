The first thing that must be said is that this is not the original Alice in Wonderland. Honestly, anybody who thinks it is... They said it in the very first commercials that this was \"different\" so from the get go you shouldn\'t expect Carrol\'s book.

This is a completely different take on Wonderland and Looking Glass - and it\'s good! It presents us with a headstrong and kind of reckless Alice who is capable of taking care of herself. And Hatter is just awesome, he really is. The Queen makes me want to punchasize her face (which is a good thing, it means Bates played her role well) and the White Knight... Ah, what can I say about the White Knight besides, \"Most awesome old guy ever?\" Some people have complained about the CGI but honestly... I expected it from Sci-fi (or Syfy, whatever). But that doesn\'t stop this from being a good miniseries. It was well acted, well written, and fun! I must reiterate: This wasn\'t meant to be the children\'s story, it was meant to be a different take on the story and aim it towards a different audience! A good miniseries and well worth watching if you can accept that this really is \"a different kind of Alice.\"
