You are forcing the staff to move all of them when you do that.

Music torrents should be uploaded to the Audio Music category, unless you have been dumb enough to include a TXT file in the torrent, in which case they should be uploaded to the Audio Other category."

I guess there's something of wrong on TPB uploading because when i try to upload in Audio Other category TPB does me the same error ever.

Best Regards"
