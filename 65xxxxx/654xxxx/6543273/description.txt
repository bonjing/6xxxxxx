Butterfly Suicide was born out of a melding of musical projects in Columbus, OH. Eliot Hosenfeld, co-owner of Moo Pigface Recording Studios, was looking for a timid, haunting female voice to sing on a few made for movie tunes. Sarah, the experienced front woman of Sarah Hadeka Band, was looking for a guitar player to perform covers on the local scene, then transition to original tunes as the band grew in popularity.

Upon looking for their ideal counterpart, they stumbled upon each other. However, upon meeting, Eliot heard Sarah's powerful voice and Sarah was certain that Eliot wasn't going to play covers. Yet, just the initial meeting produced some exciting new concepts. From there, Butterfly Suicide was born. The two compliment each other perfectly in both sound and creativity whilst utilizing their many combined years of musical success.
