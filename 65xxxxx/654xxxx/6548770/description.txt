Enjoy The Game!

Crazy Chicken Soccer is two sports games in one! In Moor Kick, choose a team from among 11 nations that youâ€™ve always wanted to play. Sweep away the competition, one person at a time. Power Goal lets you demonstrate your skill at the bicycle kick. While managers kick balls from all angles imaginable, you remain completely cool: judge the angle, jump to the ideal height at just the right moment â€“ and SCORE! Prove your worth by scoring an elusive double goal. Play Crazy Chicken Soccer with the whole family!
