,snakeFisher,2011-09-07T15:21Z,Is there anyway to change the default language to English? I've tried going into File>Options and going to Language (Idioma in God damn Spanish) and setting everything I can see to 'Inglese' but it still won't work. My default language is English on the computer as well!
,norge75,2011-09-13T05:41Z,I just downloaded this Office program and it seems to work. I used only the product key. Should I also install the second key?
,ultrapulse,2012-01-02T00:37Z,"Donâ€™t use KMS Activation firstly you donâ€™t know if its installing Trojans or other viruses onto your system and secondly it only activates it for 180 days. Activate it permanently with a serial and by ringing Microsoft and getting the conformation ID, that way you know you are safe and secure and also you know it is permanently activated.

01. start Word.
02. If the activation window appears close it.
03. Go to menu File, Help, Change Product Code, and then enter key:
828CH-G4FPY-HMH4R-32GCK-6D9BH or 3W3MQ-H7M6X-3WYP7-TPCH6-8G8T2
04. Untick the ""Activate over internet"" box at the bottom, and click ""Next"".
05. In the window that appears click ""Install"".
06. When finished the Install process, close word an then reopen Word.
07. An activation window will appear (if not, go to menu File, Help, Activate).
08. Select the ""Phone Activation"" option, and click ""Next"".
09. Pick your country, then ring the number and follow the instructions.
10. When asked for your ID, input the code given in the Word activation window. 
11. When asked which edition, choose business/volume use, used only on 1 pc.
12. A code will be given back, and enter the code into the activation box.
13. Click ""Next"", and Office will say that it's permanently activated.
14. Close Word (and any other Office 2010 application).
15. Restart Word, and go to Help to check the subscription status.

Office 2010 is now fully and permanently activated."
