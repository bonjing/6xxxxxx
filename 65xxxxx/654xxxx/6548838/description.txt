In Slumberfish your goal is to guide a red ball to itâ€™s goal using the sleeping sea creatures around it! Clicking a jellyfish will wake it up and cause it to jump upward, knocking the ball upward as well. Clicking an orange fish will wake it up and make it dash forward, knocking the ball to the right. Green fish knock the ball to the left, starfish can throw the ball in any direction depending on their color, etc. As the levels get more advanced, puzzles make use of whirlpools, ocean currents, seahorses, turtles and pufferfish!
