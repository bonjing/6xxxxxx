Tyler Florence (The Great Food Truck Race) divides the nine finalists into three groups of three, challenging them to create and brand a unique menu for a lunch truck and sell their product to consumers. 

They must film an advertising spot promoting their truck and then serve mobile meals to viewers they inspired. 

Viewers can only visit the truck whose advertisement they liked best, so contestants have to put their best foot forward to stand out to consumers. 

Which team will master the art of selling and outshine all the other competitors?
