,Prospector99,2011-08-19T23:53Z,"I have a question.
I am downloading this over 500 kB/s.
So I set my upload to unlimeted to help seed.
But I am only uploading about 30 kB/s.

With so many leechers why am I not uploading faster ? I have an extreamly high internet speed package.

Thanks for the upload DownTYU I will do my best to help seed it..."
,7r0j4n,2011-08-20T03:02Z,"@Prospector99 set your upload speed based on your max upload speed limit by your isp,  setting unlimited will cause it to choke and speeds decrease."
,luminatx,2011-08-20T09:24Z,"Downloading now, hopefully legit, I've been waiting patiently for this blu-ray to come out as I haven't seen the movie yet, and didn't want to ruin the move by watching a cam or ts."

Only thing is I spent 20 min trying to get it to play Audio 2 (english) instead of the russian dub.
I had to download VLC, cause even WMP with k-lite, It only showed Audio 1.

,terryhenry,2011-08-21T22:34Z,is there any actually any English audio on this torrent???? as I cannot access an English option on the russian dub.

,terryhenry,2011-08-21T22:43Z,apologies all didn't mean to Spam - just my opera browser not updating correctly
,mike_1337,2011-08-21T23:04Z,"if you just did read
luminatx has the answer...

oh and it's not your browser to blame (though you should use a decent browser)"
,Cennation,2011-08-21T23:19Z,this is not in English language why? it says Spken language english
,Ihatetpblogin,2011-08-21T23:48Z,"@ JUSTIN182

Thanks man.  Muxed those subs from that link in, dropped all the Russian audio and sub streams.

Perfect file now, that plays English subs on my PS3, only during non-English parts.


"
,Ihatetpblogin,2011-08-21T23:58Z,"For those having audio issues.

A simple solution is to use MKVmerge to drop the Russian audio and subtitle streams, and remux the file so it only has the English audio and subtitles.

Takes about 10-12 minutes.  "
,Ihatetpblogin,2011-08-22T00:14Z,"To add to my last post.

DON'T OVERWRITE THE ORIGINAL FILE UNLESS YOU ARE DONE RE-SEEDING BACK !!!

If you overwrite, you will mess it up for sharing with others.  Write ANOTHER copy, then view that one.....again, unless you are done seeding."
,fantomscribla,2011-08-22T03:04Z,"Audio - 10

,kimma20,2011-08-22T14:01Z,v10 a10 nice rip. thx
,mrkvis,2011-08-22T21:01Z,"this torrent is fucking useless ! :(
typical russian work!

fot those experiencing problems with ENG Dub. It is there!
1,DOWNLOAD GOMplayer, start the movie...it will start with russian lang. as default..
2,left right click and select Audio-English
3,select subs- Eng

the worst thing in this torrent, and thats why ist useless, is audio doesnt fit to video!!!
you can set it in gom player, BUT it keeps changing  all the time!!!! so do not download this shit!!!
however, quality is great, but audio gliches and timimg makes it unworthy of 10GB torrent!

hands off!"
,mike_1337,2011-08-23T01:16Z,"mrkvis your comment is so fucking useless
you should get a tv that fits with your stereo that fits with your pc that fits with your speakers that fits with your player that fits with your brains

again here's the deal; get VLC software (or a DECENT hardware multimedia player) play file, set audio stream 2, set audio device s/pdif (dont bother watching this without a DECENT home theatre setup) otherwise set subtitle track 2

kthxbye


btw thnx again to the uploader! ran the movie 3 times heheh and i'll stop seeding now uploaded 60 times the whole goddamn thing

,Guidelinez,2011-08-23T22:21Z,"Great quality! Thanks! But on certain points there is a bit of lag/frame drop. It's not much, but it's a pity and a bit annoying."
,lingnanxiong,2011-08-24T09:49Z,"@Ihatetpblogin

Really sorry, didn't know what was going through my mind to say that.. I should have just said extended scene.. :X

Umm I'm not real good at all this but I'll just state my opinion, movie's real good but those who can't watch it with English Audio and Subtitle, use ""VLC  "

Lol go buy the movie you fools we need idiots like you to input into the movie industry so people like me who worked this shit out in 6th grade can keep pirating movies. Ty."
,Zeptinune,2011-09-10T20:08Z,"@Guidelinez

10k bitrate noob, maybe it's your single cored piece of shit laptop..? Movie played fine for me without a skip. Get a new computer maybe?

Loving how 'mike_1337' is owning these noobs. Listen to what the man says, rather than being a fucking N00B, do a fucking google morons and write in your question. Rather than spamming up the comments on a PERFECTLY GOOD torrent."
