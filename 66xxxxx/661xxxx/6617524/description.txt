Encoders Note: 
The video i just run a few filters through it came out pretty sweet, we worked our magic to get you the best audio too, we got the original cam audio from erdna, had to convert fps of the audio from ntsc to pal to match the r5, then had to make a few edits to help keep sync perfect, filtered hiss from this and lowered the volume, then rebalanced the eq, used a piece of audio from an encode did of the russian audio to patch gaps at the start of the cam track, then coverted it all to mono L and R channels of the same sample rate as the russian audio. At this point take note the russian dvd audio's channel order is wrong. C is fr and vice versa so had to correct the channel order, cleaned faint hints of russian from the rear surround channels then replaced the FL and FR channels with the channels from the cleaned, synced and fixed cam audio, then encoded this to aften ac3 to give full multichannel audio with a combination of studio and cam audio. Dont be fooled by all this. The end result is an excellent high quality file. The carlsberg of all jobs lol. Enjoy another fine kingdom release.
