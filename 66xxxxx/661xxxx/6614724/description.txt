The PC version has been found to be missing lighting effects.

As can be clearly seen, in the PC version the fireballs do not create any lighting effects on Ryu\\\\\\\'s body.

Vanilla SF4 did not have this issue, however Capcom made a mistake porting SSF4AE to PC and missed some files the game needs.

The issue is not just with Ryu either, All lighting effects for all characters have this issue and the download at the bottom of this post fixes the issue.

Here, if you look carefully you can see the light reflecting off Juri\\\\\\\'s pants as well as Ken\\\\\\\'s legs in particular
