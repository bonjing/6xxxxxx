Downloads Flash Video

Videobox allows you to quickly and easily download Flash video from most all of the popular video sites on the internet. Videobox will convert the video into a native Quicktime format so it's ready to view on your Mac, iPod, iPhone or iTunes.

What's New in 3.7:

* [FIX] "Convert All" could sometimes crash the application. Fixed.

* [FIX] Under some circumstances, added clips would play in the background. Fixed.

*NOTE: Unzip the lick4.zip file. Drop one of the talf files onto the Videobox window. It will register with one of the accounts. This is not cracked and is bundled with 4 working licenses you drag onto the application.

Make sure to block the application from calling home to avoid the license being revoked. Use Little Snitch to block the application from calling home to blog.bookworm.nu but allow all other connections out.

System Requirements: Intel Mac OS X.5.8+
