P.S. The installation is now going straight to the image, anyone can record on DVD.

Whereas previously there were previous versions use AltiumUninstaller.exe, just might have to hand delete the file C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Local\Altium\ AltiumInstaller.ini - in Win7, in WinXP you must remove the same file AltiumInstaller.ini, location of a similar, but for XP - a descent can not remember, use the search file. If AltiumInstaller.ini not to remove, then reinstall to begin with the former place.
