,longword,2011-08-17T13:16Z,"The version in the software says 10.391.22084, I noticed it first when I installed it myself.

The interesting thing in this release is though, the license file editor/decrypter, altium_d.exe to edit license.

In order to use the supplied license, you have to replace dxp.exe in install directory with the one in the crack folder. And, in win7, you have to be administrator, not only have administrator rights to get things working. Just to save you some rants here..."

The libraries alone in this release (you have to copy them yourself, you only get the standard set when installing, not the extra ones of the 107 directories containing LOTS of extra). The description is a bit weird, but it's written by a Japanese guy..."

,longword,2011-09-18T01:39Z,"A bit of warning. There's a eastern european release called Altium.Designer.10.589.22577 Toolkits loose. It doesn't contain the proper software nor MD5 sums of release of the archives. It's up to you if you want to find it. Just informing you that this can be a try of somebody to gain control of your computer (as always, to spam you with sex, viagra, drugs, and investments in Nigerian oil)"
