 This STUDY SMART reference guide series, designed for students from junior high school through lifelong learning programs, teaches skills for research and note-taking, presents strategies for test-taking and studying, provides exercises to improve spelling, grammar, and vocabulary, and reveals secrets for putting these skills together in great essays.

It provides techniques and exercises for brainstorming, choosing the right approach, working with an unknown or boring assigned topic, overcoming writer's block, and selecting the best point of view.

 Why do so many students draw a blank when they're assigned to write a paper? Even crack grammarians and master spellers have trouble deciding where to begin, how much to say, and how to say it. What many students never really learn is the art of working with ideas-developing them, honing them, and transforming them into words. Secrets to Writing Great Papers fills this gap by helping the student get past the difficult beginnings of putting ideas on paper.

 Concise and readable, Secrets to Writing Great Papers deals specifically with ideas and how to work with them once you've done your preliminary thinking. This guide provides techniques and exercises for brainstorming, choosing the right approach, working with an unknown or boring assigned topic, incorporating subtopics, and working with length requirements.

An appendix presents a sample essay, a sample bibliography, and a research paper that follow the most recent and approved MLA style of documentation. Two methods are shown, one giving MLA parenthetical citations, the other employing an endnote style. MLA guidelines that cover citations for electronic sources are also given.
