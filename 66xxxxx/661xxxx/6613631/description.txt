It's Back! New chapters, examples, and insights; all infused with the timeless concepts and theories that have helped RF engineers for the past 25 years!

RF circuit design is now more important than ever as we find ourselves in an increasingly wireless world. Radio is the backbone of today's wireless industry with protocols such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, WiMax, and ZigBee. Most, if not all, mobile devices have an RF component and this book tells the reader how to design and integrate that component in a very practical fashion. This book has been updated to include today's integrated circuit (IC) and system-level design issues as well as keeping its classic "wire lead" material.

Design Concepts and Tools Include

.The Basics: Wires, Resistors, Capacitors, Inductors
.Resonant Circuits: Resonance, Insertion Loss
.Filter Design: High-pass, Bandpass, Band-rejection
.Impedance Matching: The L Network, Smith Charts, Software Design Tools
.Transistors: Materials, Y Parameters, S Parameters
.Small Signal RF Amplifier: Transistor Biasing, Y Parameters, S Parameters
.RF Power Amplifiers: Automatic Shutdown Circuitry , Broadband Transformers, Practical Winding Hints
.RF Front-End: Architectures, Software-Defined Radios, ADC's Effects
.RF Design Tools: Languages, Flow, Modeling
