Their fate began to change as a huge stone descended from the sky; this stone was known as the Metin stone. The Metin stone began transforming animals into monsters, its very presence creating deadly diseases that spread around the world. Innocent people suffered as those who were slain by these beasts or choked to death by disease later rose again as undead. The undead caused chaos and destruction in their wake with seemingly endless numbers. Their tireless existence appeared as if this problem was not going to go away. Eventually the single empire collapsed and became three different kingdoms, all fighting for their own survival. To this very day, they still treat each other as enemies. 

 The falling of the Metin Stone was just the begining of what was yet to come. Smaller stones continued to fall from time to time, and all three Kingdoms lived in fear. None would dare approach the Metin Stones because the most terrifying creatures roam around here. Recently, it was discovered that the power of the Metin Stone was growing and people felt that it was consuming energy from the world.

 It is believed that these incidents caused the Dragon God to appear on the continent and people hoped that he would restore their lands to a peaceful state again.

 Become an ally of the Dragon God, use your power to defeat the Metin Stone and reunite the three kingdoms.
