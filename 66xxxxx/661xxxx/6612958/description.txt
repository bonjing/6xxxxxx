How come you press harder on a remote control when you know the battery is dead? so you better seed to get speed ;)

        Seed back for speed

[color=RED][b]Work Done[/b][/color]

Ok here i go with my version of Final Destination 5. Now i know there is like 50 of these out
there already but everyone has got their taste so here is mines. Befor you start asking yes
is a encode from the same source files IMAGINE did theirs. A tad bit over croped at the top
not at the bottom. I went to see this movie and believe you aint missing much at the top all
the action centers in the middle and its all there. I for one don't care since the quality 
is outstanding. Now onto the work done,  Not much done since like i said quality is superb
just adjusted gamma, red, black, and a bit of contrast finally sharpened it. NOw the audio 
was not the greatest it had some distortion hiss and to much bass tried and corrected those
best as i could and it sounded a bit better well to me it does maybe not to others. I WANT
TO THANK IMAGINE FOR THE SOURCE FILES AND AUDIO. THANKS GUYS MUCH APPRECITED. Hope you all
enjoy from your friendly neighboorhood encoder BDK.
