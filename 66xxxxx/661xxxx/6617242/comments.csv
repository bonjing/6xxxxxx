Thanks"
,Sukrbit,2011-08-22T14:39Z,"First of all: Thanks for a great port, been looking for this a long time.

There are a few minor issues though: after the rather simple and straightforward process of unpacking and installing I find that the game runs EXTREMELY slow. (The first five ticks took me close to 8 minutes). 

Secondly: a number of subscreens occasionally fail to highlight, leaving me with no choice but to quit and restart. This is especially annoying when the city build screen does not function properly, and cannot be exited. 

Otherwise: keep them brilliant uploads coming."

,brukerdose,2011-08-22T18:20Z,"Thank you for your feedback people. I haven't ported any windows games before, so I can't know how they'll actually perform on the different configurations people are running.

It would be great if you could include your machine specs so that it's clear to people what hardware is needed to get the games running properly.

As for the game not even starting, it's really impossible for me to know what's wrong unfortunately. If more people could include the nitty gritty details when something's wrong we may be able to find out."

,sakimonk,2011-09-12T20:13Z,"For some reason when I am trying to change a city's production, I am unable to exit that window about 90% of the time, forcing me to close down the game entirely and re-open at the last save point.  Same problem after I have saved a game, the ""game saved successfully"" window comes up, then I can't close it, so I have to re-open."

Any chance you could do Airport Inc. (Airport Tycoon) by Take 2 Interactive ... such an awesome game and havnt been able to find a mac version yet. Would love if you could do a version of this."
