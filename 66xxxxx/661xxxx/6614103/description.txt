About the Game
One of the main routes of the old Great Western Railway, the Bristol â€“ Exeter line is 85 miles long and dates back to the 1840s. Currently the principal operator on the route is First Great Western, with high-speed trains providing fast services from London through to the West Country and multiple units handling local stopping services. This expansion pack recreates this wonderful line from Bristol Temple Meads to Exeter St Thomas, with all 12 stations in between plus all the cuttings, hills and valleys which make this such a scenic route. With a choice of free-roams and scheduled scenarios, there is plenty to keep you occupied throughout this beautifully-detailed expansion pack.
