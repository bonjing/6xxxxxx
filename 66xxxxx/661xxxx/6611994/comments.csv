,kamshufna,2011-08-18T07:12Z,THANKS TvTeam.
,feartruth,2011-08-18T09:05Z,"TVTeam,

Thanks for taking time and giving us the right description. In the ""corrected"" description, you've mentioned ""Subs: En"". If that means English subtitles, how to play the movie with them? I know of subtitles in the form of .idx + .sub files (or .srt format), but here I can see only .idx files and no .sub file in the list of files for the movie.

Hope you'll reply. TIA."

,newmouse,2011-08-18T16:22Z,"Sample looks good..perhaps a little (very little) to dark.
@@@@
I usually get a 700MB Avi version but this is a 2 hour 15 mins film & putting that into 700MB will lose a lot of quality @@@"
