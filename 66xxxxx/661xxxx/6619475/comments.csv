,joelseph25,2011-08-29T21:29Z,"@bkkmonger Open the movie up with VLC Media Player, when the movie starts click on audio at the top of the screen and then select the second available audio track"
,farahad,2011-08-30T03:48Z,"Seems to be a dvdrip?  Not the best quality, but I hate cams and this is ok.  Two audio tracks, so don't flip when it comes up as something else.  English seemed to be a little out of sync at one point, but  fixed itself promptly.  

V: 8.5-9
A: 9

Reminds me of those 800meg flicks I used to download in the good ole' days.  

A solid upload for those looking for an actual dvdrip of this movie so early on.  I think this is the first one up.  

Much appreciated.  "
,funkular88,2011-10-09T03:59Z,"This is a CAM. In the early seconds of the spanish audio track you can here people coughing in the cinema. The english audio track is much better. The video is pretty good for a cam. In the dark scenes, bright lights create blue streaks and halos.

V:7
A:7 (english)"
