Does Your Brain Need Beefing Up?

The human brain is one of the most complex organisms known. When working at optimum levels, it can process loads of data as quickly as a computer. Although a computerâ€™s hard drive can ultimately store much more data, our brains can store â€œdataâ€ in ways that a computer never couldâ€” instantly recalling how crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e smells, feels, and tastes when this dessert is mentioned. Unfortunately the brain doesnâ€™t always remain working at optimum levels . . . unless you work on it!

More and more, scientific evidence is proving that our minds donâ€™t have to deteriorate as they age. There are preventive measures we can take that will significantly increase the probability of staying mentally and physically fit throughout our lives. This is good news of course, because mental fitness and agility translate to an enhanced quality of life. Physical exercise, good nutrition, social connection with others, and mental stimulation all play important roles in ensuring that our brains remain sharp and agile at
any age.

Scientists the world over have been doing research for decades on how some people can stay â€œwith itâ€ while others cannot. The Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, demonstrated recently that older adults could improve their cognitive abilities with proper training and that some of these gains could be maintained several years later. In this experiment conducted by a number of researchers, more than 2,800 adults aged 65 to 94 received training in memory, reasoning, or processing speed. After
about ten hours of training, each group improved significantly in the area in which they were trained. Even five years later subjects maintained many of their improvements.
