Add the inclosed package called "No CD" or follow the later Nraas link to get your own version.  The CFG file is also included in this torrent, or you can download the one from the above link.

Use this link to explain how to bypass the launcher. Please not keep the most current shortcut (at this point "Town Life"), of wht you installed just to launch the launcher. This allows you to update and add exchange content or even store bought content.
