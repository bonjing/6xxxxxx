,mainachan,2011-08-18T08:05Z,"Lol, this allows you to update and add content, even store bought.

What is better, moving cracks around or just playing? To use the mod is the same steps to add content.  Crack or not if you want to add content, this simple thing allows you to ignore cracks and not change anything as new packs come out, even if you download them here.

feel free to take the extra steps to swap out cracks when updates come, I mean if the extra mouse clicks makes you fell better........."
