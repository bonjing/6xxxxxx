,TheSilverKing,2011-10-11T06:08Z,hrrrd108 if you go to barnes and noble .com the audio MP3 says it is narrated by James Marsters. If anyone has this version please upload.

,TrainwreckPorcelain2,2011-10-21T03:45Z,This is missing Disc 9. 
,goingawol,2011-11-07T03:14Z,"Sadly, Marsters said he was unable to do the narration for this one, so Glover took over duties on it. The Amazon credit is a mistake. "
,Lachisus,2011-11-23T06:58Z,The file naming and organization on this torrent is fucked. It will literally take you less time to go download another one than it will to try and figure out how the hell this person named their files.
