,Oyarsa-Q,2012-04-26T09:31Z,"just shared the best version of Aelita available, better image than this Ruscico edition which has very high contrast. Oyarsa-Q edition is taken from the French Bach DVD which has better grayscale detail and a new Philip Glass soundtrack. With new English intertitles and subtitles in eight languages.
