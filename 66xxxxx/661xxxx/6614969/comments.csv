,wtfjbl,2011-09-11T19:32Z,"I was about to thank you, but the quality is very poor. It's the same DL I got a few months a go. meh... season 8 especially has very appalling quality.

don't re-upload other rips if you have nothing better to provide."
,junzmyfav,2011-09-18T01:50Z,"@wtfjbl

shut the fuck up faggot. it's not the same torrent. idiot."
,junzmyfav,2011-09-18T01:51Z,"And quality is decent. maybe on your 15"" crt with windows 2000 and a 16mb video card it doesn't look to good though."
,duranachampion,2011-09-18T12:50Z,"season 1-7 are excellent quality dvdrips. just excellent. subtitles are available on tvsubs.
DONOT downlaod seasons 8 and 9. They are very poor quality tvrips. subs are also not available.

,junzmyfav,2012-05-01T09:53Z,"i'm going to remove this torrent soon since a much better 720P one is up. (after i confirm it's quality is better than this one, i will delete this torrent)"
,Chrimbo,2012-05-25T14:59Z,"One little request: when you upload the 720p version, would you consider changing your naming conventions ever so slightly so that the episode numbers refer to their places in the individual seasons rather than the whole show? Eg Season 2/006 - The Ex-Girlfriend - [DVD].mkv would become Season 2/01 - The Ex-Girlfriend.mkv"
