Alrighty, then.  Burned and confirmed."
,redback38,2011-08-19T08:40Z,"i punched this one out just for you:-)it hasnt got the regular drivers packs or java,but is an awesome rescue disk,just the explorer shell and working good apps,pnputil runs auto at startup so will install devices without prompts....hope it wows em:-)enjoy....in leiu of that beer lol!:-)"
,mbmalone,2011-08-19T22:04Z,"I got my copy, working fine over here. Every time you upload one, it's like a little Christmas :-) I see applications I haven't seen and get to try them out to see if I like them or not. "

Is there an easy way to integrate this apps on piratebay. They all work fine in PE and registered. Search for ""Portable by speedzodiac"" Check it, lot of seeds because the guy is the shitz, no virus."
,redback38,2011-08-20T05:17Z,"@mbmalone.....will check it out tonight,thank you very much:-)hope you liked the wallpaper lol.iv uploaded 3 versions in the last two days,check em out:-)"
,atlanticjack,2011-08-20T11:17Z,"Thanks for this, very impressive, I've been using Linux based rescue disks & AVs in the past and this is the first Windows based rescue disk that I've tried and it was an excellent user experience.
ClamWin picked up several trojans which were buried deep in email archives and some spyware in other programs which Kaspersky Rescue Disk and DrWeb bootable had both missed."
,mbmalone,2011-08-20T17:43Z,"@redback38: The wallpaper was great winblowsux ha..ha.. I also went to microsnot to see if I could install one of their free themes in the PE, online. It installed fine, but didn't seem to do anything but change the wallpaper. I thought that was cool, then my wallpaper changed again from the installed them. I don't think I ever had automatically changing wallpaper in a Win7 PE. You could add some msnot themes files to the startmenu and click and they should work the same. I just say because I thought it was cooool. Love your Win7PE, working great over here. Keep improving, don't care how big it gets. Working on my drop-in drivers again, I made menu changes and took a snapshot so you could see."
,bhsx,2011-08-20T17:57Z,"OK, first off, you are putting together some fine material here.  I use these on USB stick.  I use YUMI from pendrivelinux and select the win7/vista installer iso and it works just fine.  I always have a linux rescue, win7pe and HBCD on a 4gb stick and use portableapps and/or pstart on the same stick.  Can do some incredible system/data rescue with it.

I'd like to make a request, if I may.  I'd love a large rescue version, large mostly due to drivers.  I love that you put ghostcast server on v4; but it doesn't work correctly.  If you could include a working ghostcast and ghost 32 on a PE with loads of drivers (personally, I need one with all Dell drivers, including cutting-edge new drivers, which is a pain :), I'd love you long time.
Also, I think it'd be cool to put the HBCD menu/scripts/apps in one too.  The way I use it on USB it's easy to just launch the HBCD stuff from any PE, but I don't think it'd be ""bad"" to redistribute HBCD stuff, since he's ""illegally"" distributing XP isos anyway.  
HBCD is dead, long live RBBCD! 
Rock on sir."

,redback38,2011-08-21T01:32Z,"well i must say im floored to know how much of a fan base im getting here,currently the list of requests for different apps/drivers is mounting fast,to this end,i will include pretty much ALL driver packs ON THE ROOT OF THE DISK,being about the only way i can satisfy the burgeoning need for loads of drivers.the plan is to put em in the root of the cd and include a copy of DPINSTin each pack to handle auto install,(looks like ill be hunting driver packs for a few days lol)....@bhsx?.....ill take a look at the ghost32,server,and ghostcast and see what i can do to get it working properly,the script i use isnt my creation so it might take a little time if i gotta redo from scratch....also Hirens version 14 will be in the next version both as a boot option and also as an option in the start menu,all these things will need testing so ill do em,then let the IT world test em and complain\report back:-)@mbmalone?....themes?...totally unnecessessary!.....but id never let that stop me lol!....of course all of this will make the total package fuggin huge,but! the booting size of the  .iso will be small enough to still be useable.winbuilder80 has limitations,im finding that boot.wims over 1.2 gigs often result in BSOD errors for no apparent or varying reasons ,so look for the driver packs in the ROOT OF THE CD,from here on in(Version7).16bit DOS support will be a regular inclusion from here on in too,so will the dosbox games suite(you need somethin to do whilst you do AV scans lol)and yes HBCD does redistribute XP isos illegally,so technically,me using it is illegal too....but fuck em all....were at the piratebay here.....no borders,no rules,if microsuck or hiren want to track me down?...go ahead,i use TOR to log in here,so let em go find the ip i use in bumfuck Thailand,ill sit here in my bunker and laugh my guts out:-)Version 7 will be out in a few days with requested inclusions/changes:-)"
,redback38,2011-08-21T01:39Z,@mbmalone....yes....yes he did....never been offered sexual favours before.....
,mbmalone,2011-08-21T02:27Z,"@redback38 Are you using Dosbox ThinApp? Hiren's is easy to include, tested that plenty. Even on the startmenu."
,redback38,2011-08-21T03:27Z,"im actually using a dosbox front end i found on the net,comes with version 74 already in it.its easy to use and add games in a flash that  the end user just has to click on to start(no dosbox experience or config required).itll do for now,im looking at driver pack options this week,though the more i look at it,finding an easy drivers solution for everybody and all boxes is dam near impossible!(the disk would end up being 8GB if i included EVERY concievable win7 driver for all models and makes)so....im thinkin of simply doing driver install packs for all wlan,lan,audio,mass storage,and a few misc packs and let ppl find their own for chipsets and graphics cards etc(iv gotta draw a line somewhere,the total upload package would simply be waaaay to big)pleasing everybody is an impossible task lol!.....iv got hold of a slew of new apps/hack tools and password crackers(thanks to your links)so version 7 is about to be built after i test em all.:-) stay tuned!"
,mbmalone,2011-08-21T04:32Z,"@redback38 screw the video and chipset driver packs. If the drivers are not included in Win7 they require a reboot, so include original drivers only in the driver script, from boot. If your chipset is not already supported by Win7, u're screwed anyway. driverpack chipset drivers are a mess what what I hear, anyway. Wlan & Mass storage are absolute must. Audio probably never work without the drop-in driver packs. I've got two of them working fine. Need to send  you an update. My Win7PE works once in a blue moon, got something screwing it up but once in a while it works. Yours always works."

I like this guy's scripts, they all work. Google ""The WetHat Lab site contains some of the results of my hobby software"""

I hope these games only require simple keyboard strokes, because ""The Man"" ain't gonna like seeing me fighting his spyware with my gamepad plugged in, lol  !!!!!!!!!!  Robotron: 2084 maybe could fool him .............

Can you WMware Thinstall Williams Arcade Classics? http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N4D8QM7KL._SL500_AA300_.jpg"
,redback38,2011-08-22T01:28Z,"the dos games suite requires only keyboard strokes and is set up to do just that.simply run the dos games icon on the desktop and double click the game on the list that comes up.:-)id didnt thin app the williams stuff because this way i can add games to the suite and update the script with new games with very little work:-)iv got ALL of wet hats scripts,they all work great but you gotta check em out to make sure whether they vista or win7 before adding to the build.and yes i agree about chipset and video drivers,iv got wlan/lan/mass storage now going onto the cd root instead of full intergration(saves space in the boot wim)so ppl can choose thier own driver packs off the disk and just hit DPInst.exe to auto install em for thier exact brand of wifi.current dell drivers come intergrated for lan/wlan/and audio(most requested).......as for thin apping the williams games?......ill skip it for now cause iv got em working as is,im focusing on the drivers stuff for now,latest problem?....getting winbuilder to make shortcuts to desktop when the drivers are put in the cd root instead of in the boot wim,for some reason it just wont do it!...grrr.....ah well.....back to the help manual lol"
,mbmalone,2011-08-23T01:05Z,"@redback38: I don't have any problems with wethat scripts, any of them that I've tried. I love his Java 1.6.xx script. I am using it without issue with the latest Java 1.7. I only changed the directory on the PC where it looks for the Java from the 1.6 to the 1.7 directory. The script ran fine and verified online that Java 1.7 was installed in Opera. Only issue I had was some of the scripts were not level 5, Application level. Some are Level=3 or Level=4, whatever. He tells you if they need to go in components or tweaks, instead of level=5 Apps. Once I got the 2 or 3 that I had incorrectly placed in Level 5, everything started working great !!! I also use his templates :-)"
,mbmalone,2011-08-23T01:11Z,"@redback. Gonna send you some drivers if you have time to include them in Version 7. You don't have to do anything, just drop them all the the drivers folder, no configuring neccessary. They were putting some trash in the root of the CD and I couldn't easily find the audio install in the menu. etc. Overwrite any files in your folder with these. You will like it."
