,tapja91,2011-08-20T01:32Z,i have a game launcher error ... how to fix it
,elturbo9077,2011-08-20T07:04Z,"@all

uninstall the ubisoft game launcher and becuase it has cracked files and then install the game with the launcher that it has and it should work"
,enciem,2011-08-20T12:48Z,"Thanks man, works good for me.  Didn't need to uninstall the original ubigame launcher thing, just hit cancel when it asked for a serial"
,SoMBiE,2011-08-20T22:17Z,"Thanks for uploading this fix, but it doesn't work for me. I get the same tiny blank window with 'ok' button"
,SoMBiE,2011-08-21T00:20Z,"I installed from ISO and used (somebodies) crack and it worked on my ACER laptop, it works... Maybe it has something to do with 64bit OS maybe."

,DragonXG,2011-08-23T13:07Z,"After trying the SkidRow (and the Offline fix) and the Kaos releases, FD still didn't work.
Running From_Dust.exe just got a small blank dialog.
I found a way to generate the UbisoftGameLauncher command line parameters, and using the Orbit folder was able to get into the Launcher, use any code, but when clicked Play, FD crashed.
Look in the launcher Logs, use a Base64 converter for the path and put it together in a BAT.
I found FD looking for the UGL in D:\, regardless of the registry saying otherwise.
The solution... I put the FD folder onto a blank USB drive and the 'contents' of the Orbit folder into the root of the same drive.
Sorry, I cannot remember where I got the UGL.exe that accepts any code, but it wasnt from KaOs or the SkidRow cracks. I tried many combos, so am not sure what came from where.
From_Dust.exe then worked, started the Launcher, which accepted any code, and Play ran the game.
Oh... another thing, I also use a Mimo 7"" USB LCD, managed by DisplayFusion.
The game wont run with the second 'monitor' on. Dungeons (Kalypso Media) has the same problem.
Hope this helps all those not able to play. Good luck. "

,geralt.x,2011-08-23T21:23Z," blank window with 'ok' button problem
this helped me:
1. uninstall game and delete all in folder when was installed , uninstall ubisoft game launcher and delete all in this folder (c:\program files\Ubisoft) 
2. download and install game (Skidrow)
3. download Offline fix
4. copy only -From_dust.exe- from Offline fix to the game installation
5. copy all from Orbit folder to  C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\ 
6. play the game"

,felix_703,2011-09-11T22:29Z,Problem solved! I'd just had to press cancel :))
,cpas,2011-09-25T20:38Z,"Enfin un crack qui fonctionne, ĂŠvidemment c'est un Skidrow"
