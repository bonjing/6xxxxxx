,saw089,2011-08-21T11:20Z,Any thoughts about the game? :)
,Avalier,2011-08-21T16:46Z,"The game is fantastic in my opinion, the only downside is mouse control, its a bit jerky. X360 controller for Windows solves the problem. The system requirements shouldnt be a problem either, i can run it on a mid range laptop."
