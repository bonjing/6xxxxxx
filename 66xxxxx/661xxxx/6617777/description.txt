Storyline: Many years ago, Yan Chixia aspired to become an excellent demon hunter, so he chose Black Hill as his place of training and fulfilling his dream. At that time, Yan was still young, and in the old Black Hill lived several demons and spirits who have existed even longer than the hill itself. Although these creatures lead a simple and primitive lifestyle, they are enshrouded in a strong aura of death and killing.
