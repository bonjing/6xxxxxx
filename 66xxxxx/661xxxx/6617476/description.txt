A Guide to Garden Birds

As part of the BBCâ€™s SPRINGWATCH event, Brett Westwood presents a practical, informative and entertaining guide to help you identify the birds in your garden at this time of year.

The trio of Brett Westwood, Stephen Moss and Chris Watson in search of the various garden birds. 

Recorded on location in the Somerset Levels, in the garden of keen birdwatcher, writer and broadcaster Stephen Moss, A Guide to Garden Birds is a helpful, practical guide to help you sort out your Blue tits from your Great Tits and your hedge sparrows from your tree sparrows. Packed with useful information and helpful tips, the series will appeal to both the complete novice, and the experienced birdwatcher who simply wants to know more about the birds in their garden. 

Joining Brett and Stephen is wildlife sound recordist, Chris Watson armed with an array of microphones to allow Brett, Stephen and listeners to eavesdrop on the songs, calls and alarm cries of the birds in the Somerset garden.

Each week, the series focuses on a different group of birds, namely Thrushes, Titmice, Finches, â€œWoodland Visitorsâ€ and House Guests. Not only does the series provide useful information on how to identify the various Springâ€“time visitors, but also discusses the behaviour of these birds, and includes tips on how to encourage more birds into your garden.
