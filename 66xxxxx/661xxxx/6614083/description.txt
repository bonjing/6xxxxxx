About the Game
Lets step back to a simpler time in the United States of America and travel to the eastern seaboard and then northeast to the state of Maine. Even in Maine we will keep heading north until we reach the central northernmost part of Maine to just south of the Canadian border. We arrive at two towns separated by 19 miles of track, Fort Kent and Eagle Lake. This is where All Aboards newest installment of the railroading experience begins.
