Please seed for a bit to get this thing spread. I won't always have my computer on, so I need others to help me.

Thanks for all the seeders currently sharing this - you guys rock!"

However is it just me or does anyone else get annoying horizontal lines every few seconds? I think its an interlacing issue? This happens both when I burn it onto a disc and also when I watch it through my media player. If so is it possible to rip it again without interlacing?

Cheers!"

But it doesn't seem like much of an issue when I plug it into my 23"" LED Screen TV, but it might be a bigger issue for big TV's (not sure). Even I haven't watched the entire series but thought it would be good to upload anyways.

Even if I had the series with me on hard copy, I don't know of any other way to do it than when I used Handbrake.

If anyone else has it and would like to rip it on their own, go ahead and put a link for a better quality.  Otherwise, enjoy!"
