(A scathing rebuke of classic Indian culture by an movie Indian producer)

Salaam Bombay (1988) is a wake-up call to the harsh realities on the ground 
in respect of cultural make-up of life in India at the present time.

It would be insane to consider integrating what is shown in this movie with any 
respect of European civilization as a compatible or remotely possibly 
co-existent model in any regard whatsoever.

To each his own as they say, and that is most certainly the case here.

This is from a PAL DVD9 that contained the original Hindi language audio along
with a French audio track as well. It also contained French subtitles only.

We bring it to you in DivX at full 720 X 576 resolution at 900k video bitrate
included is a full 192k audio track in the original language only.
Subtitles were converted from the disc - which included only the French
and we found English sub on the net which were the right fit luckily 
First line in subtitles begins at 1min 10 seconds in case you are looking for matching subs - the ones that start at 1:14 or 1:22 did not fit I'm sad to say.

We cannot allow ourselves the possibility that any in our midst envision
what is shown in this movie as something we want to become equal to in any
notions of propriety whatsoever. The "monkey dance" done by Steve Balmer at Microsoft on one occasion is shown equally by a neanderthal genius in this
movie who takes it upon himself to swing a belt buckle at at boy carrying some
tea to see if this would entertain the visiting gal (from Australia?) no thanks!
(to this brand of entertainment genius and social modelling insanity!) Amen
