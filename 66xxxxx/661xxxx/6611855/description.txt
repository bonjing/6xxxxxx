Many films never get the attention they truly deserve and in retrospect Sidney Lumetâ€™s Deathtrap seems to be such an example. There is nothing spectacular about the film, no real blockbuster star power and nothing controversial. Although Michael Caine can certainly rank as a star in his own right at least in my personal book, Christopher Reeve unfortunately never managed to break away from his popcorn â€œSupermanâ€ image during his acting career. â€œDeathtrapâ€™sâ€ real strength lies in the story, the well thought-out cat-and-mouse story that keeps the viewer constantly guessing and climaxes in a insidious plot twist.

Staged and presented almost like a theater play itself, director Sidney Lumetâ€™s film adaptation of Deathtrap is a wicked cat-and-mouse movie, and no matter what you think you know, the film will constantly prove you wrong. Nothing, absolutely nothing is the way it seems and every time the story will take one of its wild twists you will be either completely fixated on the screen, mesmerized by what just happened, or you will slap your forehead in exultation about the events. Either way, you will experience a film that is fresh, entirely unpredictable and funny at the same time. Many times this movie has reminded me of â€œDirty Rotten Scoundrelsâ€ in its nature, its wickedness and its cleverly written, oftentimes unexpectedly dead-on dialogues. The film starts out a bit slow and is overly dialogue-laden in the beginning. Once you pass the 25-minute mark however it picks up speed considerably as the plot takes its first wild turns and hardly leaves the viewer enough time to recuperate from one twist to another.

The kissing scene between Sidney and Clifford is not in the original play. In his book The Celluloid Closet, gay film historian Vito Russo reports Reeve as saying that the kiss was booed by preview audiences in Denver, Colorado and estimating that a Time magazine report on the incident (which spoiled a key plot element) cost the film $10 million in ticket sales.
