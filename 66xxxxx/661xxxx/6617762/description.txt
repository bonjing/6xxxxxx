thx

Cam Info:
Beside the big borders, the cam itself doesnt have much colour, too much brighteness,contrast and gamma.
Also the angle is oblique, making faces not that straight looking.
the whole movie feels like glaring, but that helps the dark scenes.
The last scenes around the kitchen was still very dark.

Work done:
well that was a bunch of work. took me more than 10h.
firstly i removed the very shaking 10 seconds, cant be fixed and no need for them.
cropped the borders,and fixed the aspect and the skewed video.
But the most complex thing was to fix the video. I tried to bring the colours back into life and restored the video quality so that the glareeffect isnt that much visible.
Since not all parts at daylight were the same and the dark scenes needed complete different settings i had to cut the movie again in lots of pieces to treat every piece differently as needed.
looks a lot better now

Audio was also not that easy to fix, the line had a constant noise in the background, which is very annoying. Removed all that hiss,noise and made the voices better understandable. 

All in all very watchable now
enjoy
