However, the exercises in some sections are "graded" according to difficulty - with easier tests being followed by more difficult ones. Thus, it is my belief that intermediate students too can very much benefit from its contents! The book has also to some extent been arranged thematically, and has exercises that are interrelated. Additionally, there is towards the back of the book a vocabulary game. Hence, teachers should also find this work very useful - especially in the classroom... Students preparing for such exams as FCE, CAE, CPE and similar will find this publication immensly useful.
