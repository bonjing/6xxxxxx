    It all began in 1987 with a revolutionary arcade shooter called 
    R-Type. Now the classic shooter is back for a final appearance with 
    new features and the same exciting, revolutionary gameplay that 
    started it all. Use the unique Force System to power-up your ship 
    as you choose and send it into battle against the evil Bydo. With 
    over 100 ships to choose from and an almost unlimited amount of 
    customization options, R-Type Final is the definitive shooter on 
    the PlayStation 2.
