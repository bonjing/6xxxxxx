    Peter Brown and Ahna Capri star as wildlife photographers, exploring     
    the Amazon jungle. The two shutterbugs run afoul of homicidal hunter     
    William Smith. In Most Dangerous Game fashion, the villain gives         
    Brown and Capri a head start, then begins hunting them down like wild    
    animals. The title is something of a giveaway: it's a safe bet that      
    somebody's body will be picked clean by those omniverous Amazon          
    piranhas. Filmed on location, Piranha Piranha received plenty of TV      
    play after Jaws opened the floodgates of "death from the deep"
