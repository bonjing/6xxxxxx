        Murder is on the menu

        John Taylor (Clayne Crawford) has just robbed a bank. So  far,
        he's  planned  and executed  the  job perfectly,  but  now the
        robbery is suddenly all over the news and he's been identified
        as the  perp. Injured  and with  his getaway  car known to the
        cops, John's got a big problem - he's got to ditch the vehicle
        and get off the streets pronto.

        Warwick  Wilson  (David  Hyde  Pierce)  is  in  the  middle of
        preparing a dinner party he is hosting that evening, when  his
        intercom  buzzes. The  am on  the intercom  screen introduces
        himself  as John,  a friend  of a  friend, and  in need  of a
        favour.

        But John's just conned his way  into the wrong home, and to  a
        dinner party where the tables will be turned.
