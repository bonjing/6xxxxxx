Sexual Abuse in Christian Homes and Churches - Collections 1, 2 & 3 (reload):


This is a re-upload of some books and reports that were uploaded more than 2 year ago. It includes titles that were originally part of the following uploads:

   -  Sexual Abuse of Nuns in Convents and Nunneries
   -  Sexual Abuse of Minors and Pedophilia by Priests and Clergymen
   -  Sex Solicitation in Auricular Confession - A Collection


The titles of the books and reports in this reload were modified so as to conform with the format of the titles in the later uploads, and to show year of publication.
