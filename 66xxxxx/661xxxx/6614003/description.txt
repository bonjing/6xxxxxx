About the Game
The Hatchet Hill branch line was subject to Beechings axe in 1970, with no other choice Mendip Aggregates Ltd purchased the line from British Railways in order to maintain their vital rail link with mainline network in order to continue their supply and demand of ballast from Hatch Hill Quarry. Mendip Aggregates Ltd also purchased two of the Class 04 shunting locomotives that had been slated for the cutters torch which then replaced their tired stock of shunting steam locomotives.
