The James Koetting Ghana Field Recordings collection presents a vibrant mix of
traditional and popular music recorded at a broad range of locations and events
in Ghana during the 1970s by ethnomusicologist James Koetting. Students and
researchers can hear online the complete archive of Koetting\'s field tapes â€”
142 audio reel tapes â€” of musical performances from arts festivals, traditional
ceremonies and events, stage concerts, church services, and less formal
gatherings and sessions throughout Ghana.

As one of the largest collections of field recordings from Ghana, this digital
collection includes recorded interviews, musical demonstrations, field
notebooks, photographs, commentary, and other original source material
surrounding Koetting\'s research. The collection highlights his extensive work
with Kasena musicians in Accra (Nima) and in the Kasena region near the
country\'s border with Burkina Faso and also documents Akan, Ewe, Ga, Dagomba,
and other musical types and activities of the time. Koetting served on the
Brown University Music faculty from 1975 until his death in 1984.

This project is supported, in part, by the Scott Chanchien Memorial Library 
Fund.
