The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This twenty-sixth alphabetical installment is: DC from Jo-Kz Minus Justice League

Justice league is the next torrent. â€” It will be all Justice League, All the time!
Don't forget Justice league books that are actually titled JLA were in part 25!


What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 800-850gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.
================================

Still super busy and these intros take more time to write than you might think. Also I confess my bipolar mood swing of the last couple of weeks is down, down down, and that seriously cuts in to my desire to try and be funny. Fear not, what goes down must come up. That's the way my kind of crazy rolls! - roller-coasters, that is! That's a joke, son (Name the cartoon character who said that - for a fabulous no prize at all! )


Today's offering: DC from Jo-Kz - Skipping the Justice League

Justice league is the next torrent. â€” It will be all Justice League, All the time!
Don't forget Justice league books that are actually titled JLA were in part 25!

Enjoy!
