Fraps software was designed to be a universal Windows application
that can be used with games using DirectX or OpenGL graphic
technology. In its current form Fraps performs many tasks and can
best be described as:

Benchmarking Software - Show how many Frames Per Second (FPS) you
are getting in a corner of your screen. Perform custom benchmarks
and measure the frame rate between any two points. Save the
statistics out to disk and use them for your own reviews and
applications.

Screen Capture Software - Take a screenshot with the press of a
key! There's no need to paste into a paint program every time you
want a new shot. Your screen captures are automatically named and
timestamped.

Realtime Video Capture Software - Have you ever wanted to record
video while playing your favourite game? Come join the Machinima
revolution! Throw away the VCR, forget about using a DV cam, game
recording has never been this easy! Fraps can capture audio and
video up to 2560x1600 on dual-core CPUs (1152x864 single-core) at
up to 100 frames per second!
