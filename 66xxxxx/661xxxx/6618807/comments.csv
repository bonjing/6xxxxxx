[T],trialNerror,2011-08-21T08:27Z,"I seed at almost 300 kb/s upload speed on a good day.  On average anywhere from 200 - 250.

Your 3 kb/s download speed is not my fault.  Blame those that think by limiting their upload speed makes their download faster.  That is not true.  They are only hindering the sharing process."
[T],trialNerror,2011-08-21T09:00Z,"I've noticed the past couple of XviD's from me have had audio split across interleaves rather than aligned like they use to be. That may be an issue for SOME players.

AVIMux is a small portable app less than 1MB that can fix this.  

http://www.videohelp.com/tools/AVIMux_GUI

Drag & drop the .avi file into the top half; highlight it by clicking on the video name, then click the ""generate data"" button in the middle, and finally the Start button on the lower right corner.  Designate the file name and location and click OK.

Only takes a few seconds to process into a new video file with audio aligned on interleaves.

My lazy ass should have done that before making the torrent.  Oops.  I will from now on if I notice any new vids with audio being split across interleaves."

You wouldn't get half this stuff on pirate bay if it wasn't for trialNerror, sure others upload stuff like Ghost hunters, but trialNerror uploads stuff that slips past other uploaders attention."
