The editors of this monumental undertaking have commissioned more than 200 articles to thoroughly describe topics relating to forensic science. Practically every specialty associated with forensic science is considered, including the chemical and biological examination of physical evidence, medico-legal topics, photography, crime scene analysis, ethics, and quality assurance. That the contributors are specialists from 22 countries dramatically demonstrates the international standardization that permeates the forensic sciences. The editors have taken care that the contributions are consistent in style and reading level, and that duplication of subjects is minimal. For most topics, a single article suffices, but some forensic subjects are sufficiently detailed to require several articles; for example, anthropology is covered by 13 articles spanning nearly 100 pages. Each article is cross-referenced to other articles closely related in subject matter . . . it will be essential for professionals, attorneys, and students who need accurate, detailed accounts of forensic topics. General readers, attorneys, laboratories, legal firms, and all library collections.
--CHOICE, September 2001
"...Many of the articles are very sophisticated and some are a bit more like easy reading, making this set useful for both a researcher and a general browser. However, it is apparent that the focus of this work is on explanation, application, and implication. These are not merely definitions of concepts or methods, but indications of the history and development pertinent to each topic as well as the use of this information within the legal system and the implications of this knowledge...The Encyclopedia of Forensic Sciences contains information of interest and use for the professional forensic scientist as well as anyone interested in crime scene investigation and the application of scientific method to matters of the law...The Encyclopedia of Forensic Sciences would be a useful addition to any public, academic, or legal collection."
--E-STREAMS, Electronic Reviews of Science & Technology References
"...A need has long been felt by almost everyone working in the field for an authoritative reference text where [s]he could find everything; something like 'Encyclopedia Britannica of Forensic Science.' The current encyclopedia,
written by 186 contributors, and spanning 3 volumes admirably fulfills this need...The value of the encyclopedia? Quite simply and plainly put - 'Extremely valuable.' This encyclopedia would be useful to researchers, students, professors - indeed everyone who is connected with forensic science in any way. In this reviewer's opinion, this encyclopedia should adorn the bookshelves of every person connected with forensic science. Highly recommended reading."
--INTERNET JOURNAL OF FORENSIC MEDICINE
"...The Encyclopedia expoldes the myth that American books are too general and don't go enough into detail...Almost every chapter has a textbook quality about it...Most admirable is that the historical background is not forgotten...There is no doubt at all as to the quality, comprehensiveness and expert knowledge... There is also a free password-protected online version available, which can be used by several seats in an institute...All of this, together with the excellent combination of forensic science with scientific criminal science and added to the consistent readability, comprehensive nature and international focus are major plus points...This work should become one of the regularly-consulted reference works of the new generation of forensic-criminal scientists."
--RECHTSMEDIZIN (German forensics journal)
"At long last, there is a single comprehensive reference work to address over 200 of the most common areas and applications of forensic science."
