Fran Drescher\'s new comedy - Season 1, Episodes 1 through 10

	A woman named Fran is married to a guy named Peter. After eighteen years of marriage, he rolls over in bed one night and tells her, â€œIâ€™m gay.â€ The woman is played by Fran Drescher, whose ex-husband, Peter Marc Jacobson, did pretty much the same thing. Now heâ€™s producing her new TV Land show, Happily Divorced, which explores what happens after a woman gets this sort of unexpected information, especially when the â€œafterâ€ is during a recession, when neither of the principals can afford to get a new place. John Michael Higgins â€” the sometimes-singing scene stealer from such films as Best in Show, The Break-Up, and Yes Man â€” gives a subdued performance as a man whoâ€™s just figured out heâ€™s gay.

This show has been renewed for a second season.  This package includes the first ten episodes.
