This Feel good Drama come Comedy Film from the British Broadcasting Corporation and the UK National Film council was supported by a UK National Lottery Grant and is the inspirational TRUE STORY of Rita Oâ€™Grady â€“ a Feisty factory worker who took on the biggest corporation in the World at that time â€“ Ford Motors.   What started here as a minor dispute over sexual discrimination & pay takes them on a journey that leads to a NATIONAL uprising amongst the women workers of 60â€™s Britain that changed the course of history and led to equal pay for female workers right round the World.

It is clear from this film that the UK, that is Great Britain, still has a dammed fine film industry.

Features in the closing credits are some original TV and news reel footage of the day.   WELL DONE LADIES of 1960â€™s Britain.   I am proud of you all!   The film has A GREAT 60â€™s MUSIC sound track as well as loads of memorabilia all through this excellent production.

For all in North America let me explain that Dagenham is to the UK as Detroit was to the USA.   Both are now sadly a pale shadow of their former self.   If you loved Julie Roberts in â€˜Erin Brockovitchâ€™ YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS.
