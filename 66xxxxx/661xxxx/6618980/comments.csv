,cakittyluvr,2011-08-24T06:36Z,"Thanks BOZX for uploading this and the rest of the fine work you do!
But....was wondering if anybody else has a problem with this file.
I keeps freezing on me 8 seconds into the Universal logo, and it doesn't seem to matter which player I use.
Tried copying it over a different drive, but that didn't make any difference either...."

,cakittyluvr,2011-08-25T23:38Z,"@maggot  Well....that might work....if I was on a PC.......
Mac user here
Have tried VLC, and BlrRay Player.
Usually if VLC can't play it properly, it means the file is corrupt."
