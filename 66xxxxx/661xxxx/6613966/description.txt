Colliding Continents - What created the land we see today?
Powerful forces deep below the Earth surface are propelling the continents on a restless journey across the face of the globe. They will rip vast landmasses apart and send them smashing into one another, to reshape our world. Oceans will disappear; mountains will crumble, and rise again. And where great cities once stood there will be little more than fossils. We investigate the forces that drive this dynamic process to discover what created the land we see today. And what the future holds for us, on the incredible voyage of our ever-changing continents. What we are observing at the moment is only a snap shot of the global cycle that the Earth has been undergoing for the last 4.5 billion years and will continue to undergo even if we are not around any more. We look into the future to see what the world map will look like in 250 million years time.
