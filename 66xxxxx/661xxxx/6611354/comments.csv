If you're young, have never seen the original, and like movies without a coherent plot(other than ""OH IT'S A VAMPIRE!"" you will probably like this movie. On the other hand if you've seen the original and are a little older, you will see this for what it is. A TERRIBLE remake of a classic 80's vampire horror film(with a bit of comedy) with terrible CGI vampire mouths molded after ONE scene in the original in which Jerry Dandrige smiled in his makeup. 

How do I know these things? I've seen the screener in town on August 4th. It's popcorn movie trash. A TERRIBLE remake of a great classic movie in my honest heartfelt opinion.

The choice is yours of course. It's nice to have trailers uploaded here to have a bit of forwarning on a wider audience, so thanks for the upload proffcom. "
