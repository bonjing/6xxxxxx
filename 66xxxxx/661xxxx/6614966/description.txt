iCloud is so much more than a hard drive in the sky. Itâ€™s the effortless way to access just about everything on all your devices. iCloud stores your content so itâ€™s always accessible from your iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, Mac, or PC.* It gives you instant access to your music, apps, latest photos, and more. And it keeps your email, contacts, and calendars up to date across all your devices. No syncing required. No management required.
