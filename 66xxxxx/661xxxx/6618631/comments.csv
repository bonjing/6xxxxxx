,Ritzbitts,2011-08-23T04:27Z,Garbage! The movie is corrupted less than halfway through and the quality is terrible. Don't waste your time.
[T],oddeven,2011-08-23T12:48Z,"Could you be more specific - or could somebody else chime in?  Maybe tell me where the corruption starts, since I skipped around to numerous parts of ""the middle"" and found nothing strange. I just rechecked the file and I see no corruption, and if you're wondering about not getting high quality video, think about when this was filmed (originally)!"
,DasKrieg,2011-08-24T06:46Z,"Extras do not work, and the sound is glitchy. Video skips. Downloaded twice and tried playing on 3 computers :-("
[T],oddeven,2011-08-24T10:58Z,"I have checked my files on both Arcsoft TotalMedia Theatre and VLC and I see on corruption anywhere, and the extras all work, no problem.  Although I can't guarantee 100% that what you are getting should work, I have never run into such a problem. A corrupted torrent file - still I've never experienced such a thing.

I watched a couple segments of a couple minutes each (specifically the Hindenburg disaster) and saw no errors.

I did manage to get them to play improperly by running the film on both programs at the same time, otherwise they run perfectly.

I have uploaded hundreds of torrents here, and more elsewhere and never had a similar problem."

[T],oddeven,2011-09-03T08:08Z,"OK, I have done a hash re-check using the original files (the ones I checked that work fine and the same ones you should have gotten) and it works 100%.  That would seem to eliminate any possibility for a corrupted torrent file.

Again more details about your problems (programs used, burned disc or media player, etc.), and I will try to discover (as I have already done) where the problem lies, if there truly is one.

It would be nice to hear from somebody who has a reputation to stand on, as it seems the three commenters here have committed next to nothing to this site - no offence there, but trolls do exist."
[T],oddeven,2011-09-08T12:07Z,"same set of complaints, same complainers, here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5623735/

even the same dates.  Now, who do I believe?

barely a trace of comments elsewhere..."
,berserkergreenl,2011-10-16T04:39Z,"Downloading... I will post later if it's good, I've downloaded the AI version, very nice material."
,yamilak45,2011-12-06T02:57Z,"Very good compilation, the bad quality of some is not their fault, it's old footage.... But seed it better, PLEASE, it took me A WEEK !!!"
[T],oddeven,2011-12-07T16:59Z,"Seed it better? Who are you directing that at? Part (if not all) of piracy is sharing. You don't really expect the uploader to come to your rescue no matter what.  A week, that's nothing! Have you shared anything here lately?"
