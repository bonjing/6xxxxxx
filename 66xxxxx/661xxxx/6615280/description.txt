Orbx - FTX: NA Gold USA Central Rocky Mountains 
http://fullterrain.com/product_nacrm.html

FTX Central Rocky Mountains (CRM) is the first of a series of US Interior West regions extending the ORBX NA BLUE regions to the east and south. CRM is a vast region covering parts of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming with key cities including Yakima, Boise, Idaho Falls, Helena, Billings, and Jackson. You will experience varied and beautiful landscapes with custom seasonal ground textures based on current aerial photograps taken over the region. Spectacular locations, such as the Columbia Plateau, Hells Canyon, Craters of the Moon National Monument, the Salmon River and Sawtooth Mountains, the Montana Prairies, and Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, all are depicted in great detail.

 Just like with the NA BLUE series we've given every single of the ~450 airports and airstrips in the region an upgrade with more accurate placements of runways and taxiways as well as buildings, hangars, and objects. Additionally, every single square mile of land class is hand placed and all major roads, rivers lakes, powerlines, wind farms, and vertical obstructions are included for accurate VFR flying. Last but not least all ground textures are hand-annotated with our custom autogen objects.
