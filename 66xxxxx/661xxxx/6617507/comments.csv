,voongnz,2011-08-21T05:52Z,"hi, do you want all of Conan's Tonight shows?"
,peterk711,2011-08-21T10:54Z,"Maybe external HDD would be safer for long term storage and backup. They are so cheap now.

I have been watching Conan just a couple of years but I wish there was a way to see the older shows too. Most of the torrents are dead now. 

Thanks for these torrents!"
