,Jahorse,2011-08-23T17:52Z,"I'd recommend grabbing it from who you know will have a legit release. ie. bubanee.
99% of the time you find a release that comes out before the album release claiming to be 320k it has usually been upscaled to that bitrate and is not true 320k which means bigger files and same, if not worse, quality"
