[@] ATTENTION  [@]
 #FALSE POSITIVE#
Winject.exe is classified as:

Trojan, Dropper, Delpha.ae or Artemis etc etc, in fact, AVG deletes Winject.exe immediately, 

 You can ignore either ignore the warnings and turn off your AV or just not use this hack, that simple. 


AGAIN:
Please do not upload either files to any online scanner sites that examine them. If they reverse engineer either exploits, the lifetime of the hack will be reduced greatly.
