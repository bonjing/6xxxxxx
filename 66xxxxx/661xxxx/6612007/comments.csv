This is the fixed torrent of the second half of the second leg of the spanish supercup 2011. Be patient, my upload speed is quite low. Please help me seeding this as long as you can. This match deserves it. :-)Thanks"
[T],Shepard76,2011-08-18T03:17Z,The second half is larger in size because at least 20 minutes or more are added at the end of the match.
,caprikornius,2011-08-18T20:07Z,"is there any action in those 20 min or more, or it´s just celebration??"
[T],Shepard76,2011-08-18T22:19Z,I can't explain it... that would spoil the end :-)
,caprikornius,2011-08-19T01:36Z,"well, with that, you already told me there´s more football in there. Otherwise you would´ve just said that it´s just celebration. but it´s ok. thank ya buddy!!!"
,caprikornius,2011-08-21T18:32Z,"hey shepard, can you upload tennis matches. The USA open is next on, for instance. Only the best matches. what do you think??"
,caprikornius,2011-08-22T20:40Z,"hey, are you planning to upload the Europe supercup? would be awesome!!"
,nahuelcut,2011-08-23T16:05Z,"Very good quality, I love it !! keep up the good work lad..."
[T],Shepard76,2012-04-21T00:12Z,Quality in Tv3 broadcast now is even better 1920 x 1080. Sorry for the upload speed though. I know size is absurdly huge but I think keeping this matches in HD is priceless.
