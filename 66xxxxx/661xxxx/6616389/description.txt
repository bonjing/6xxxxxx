OBSERVE: There is no proff that this works (So far) i havent been able to get it working. but i did menage to come a bit further. So if we Smash ower heads together we can make it work. 


::::Stuff You Need:::::

*Winrar
*A Brain
*Steam (Installed)
*And a computer that supports magic 2012.


::::How to install::::: -(What i know so far)-

Inside the Rar there are 2 folders and a crack (NCF Files,SmartSteam,and Magic_2012.exe)

Step 1: Move the Magic_2012.exe into your magic 2012 folder.

Step 2: If you copy all the stuff inside the folder called \"SmartSteam\" directly into your Steamfolder (Make shure Steam arent on wile you do this) and start the smartsteam.exe steam will start and you will have most of the steamgames. But you cannot download anything so dont bother..

Step 3: So there are some files i have no ide what to do with and some people say that made the game work but not how they did. So i hope we can help each other.
