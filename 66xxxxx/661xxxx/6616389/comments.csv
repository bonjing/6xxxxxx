,Dahaca,2011-09-21T01:31Z,"I have found some instructions for this fix i hope they help.

#1 If you already had the game installed some place other than your steam/steamapps folder, then uninstall your game.

#2 Install the game into your steam/steamapps folder.

#3 Place the .exe crack file from the M-MP.rar file into your â€˜magic the gathering dotp 2012â€² folder.

#4 Extract the .NCF files (NOT THE FOLDER CONTAINING THE FILES, but the actual files themselves) into your steam/steamapps folder.

#5 Extract the Smartsteam files into your STEAM folder
#6 Launch SmartSteam.exe and logon.

#7 After login, click on â€œLibraryâ€ (Itâ€™s towards the top of the steam application)

#8 Make sure the list of games being shown is under â€œInstalledâ€ (It defaults to â€œAll Gamesâ€, simply click on that and make sure it lists â€œInstalledâ€)

#9 Launch the game and play. If the game doesnâ€™t launch, go back into steam and click â€œAdd a gameâ€, and add the game manually (even if it was already on the list)"
