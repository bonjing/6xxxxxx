Volume I spans a period of approximately 375 years, from the origins of the Roman coinage in the Republican period down to the violent end of the second Imperial dynasty, the Flavian, in AD 96. There are listings of almost 3,000 coin types including a complete type catalogue of the Republican series and an expanded representation of the Imperial types (each with its place of mintage and precise date).
