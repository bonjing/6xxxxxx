The album 'Not the 9 o'clock News' [1980. Mono Record #REB 400]

This torrent contains two files. Side 1 complete and Side 2 complete. They are recorded as they were meant to be heard with no gaps between tracks, indeed the tracks are often super-imposed over each other.

This show was a satirical look at current events and brings back memories of how we felt about world leaders of the time [and how we even laughed at Mrs Thatcher for a while]. With Rowan Atkinson, Griff Rhys Jones, Mel Smith, Pamela Stevenson.

Recorded using Audacity from an Amstrad Studio 100 by Machloop.
