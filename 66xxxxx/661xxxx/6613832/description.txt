Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains (1981) 
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082639/

The story behind Ladies and Gentleman, The Fabulous Stains is a messy and complicated one. It was riddled with production problems, an editing process that took over a year to complete, and after all was said and done, Paramount Studios decided to shelf the film for over 20 years. Director Lou Adler, who was best known for his work in the music industry (he was the manager of many classic acts, including The Mamas & The Papas and Carole King), had directed one other film before The Fabulous Stains: the Cheech & Chong classic Up In Smoke (1978). Adler at least had a wealth of talent involved, including Academy Award Winner screenwriter Nancy Dowd, 15 year old actor Diane Lane as the lead (coming off her very first movie, A Little Romance (1979), and real-life punk rock musicians from current acts such as The Sex Pistols , The Tubes, and The Clash. Dowd, who had previously won an Academy Award for penning the Hal Ashby-directed Vietnam veteran saga Coming Home (1978), had been inspired by punk rock band The Ramones to write ...The Fabulous Stains. She hired punk rock columnist Caroline Coon, who had done much of the initial writing about the UK punk scene years in previous years to lend her expertise to the costumes and make up on the film.

When it seemed like everything was in place, shooting began and things started coming apart at the seams. Dowd and Adler reportedly did not see eye to eye, with Dowd claiming she felt pushed out of the production by virtually everyone. She even claimed that she was groped by one of the cameramen. Dowd eventually took her name off the film completely and used a pseudonym instead. Adler also took over a year to edit the film after shooting wrapped up, allegedly changing the ending several times. Once Ladies and Gentleman, The Fabulous Stains was completed, it was previewed at a few test screenings and the response was so poor that Paramount decided not to release it at all. Many of the cast and crew hadnâ€™t even seen the film in its entirety after it was completed. 

Despite the unevenness of the pacing at times and the occasional gaps in plot (perhaps due to the lengthy editing process), Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains still manages to be very entertaining. The topics of media-created fame, gimmick over true talent, and the sexualization of young female musicians are all touched on in the film and the movie is also a great glimpse into the early 80â€™s punk scene. Itâ€™s amazing that Adler managed to score members of The Clash and The Sex Pistols while they were still in their heyday. Fee Waybill gives a memorable performance as the washed up Lou Corpse; itâ€™s a shame he wasnâ€™t able to make more films. The real treat however is 15-year old Diane Lane as the tough acting, rebellious Corrine â€œThird Degreeâ€ Burns. Fans of Lane will definitely be able to see her emerging talent as an actress of great promise in this film.
