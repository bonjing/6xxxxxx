The Book

HE is Dexter Mayhew, tall, dark and (she canâ€™t deny it) handsome, largely naked and somehow in her single bed in her tiny room on the very last day of four years of education. SHE is Emma Morley, bottled red hair, wilfully badly dressed, all principles and no action. And very, very surprised to find herself kissing Dexter Mayhew. A simple one night stand, at the dawn of the rest of their lives? Or are Dex and Em living proof that â€“ despite an unlikely beginning â€“ men and women really can be just good friends?
