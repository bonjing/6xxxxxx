1 - Why are all 5832 pages of this six volume set in one single PDF file?

2 - How can it all fit into a mere 88.66 MiB?"
,morrig,2011-08-21T14:51Z," bookworm 1960-It's to do with ,the amount of text and whether there is many pictures and crucially the quality of both .
 I have a 880 page pdf from 13Mb's,which is even more pages per Mb's.
