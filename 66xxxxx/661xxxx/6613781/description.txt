     2011 release, the third album from the British Indie/Guitar outfit.
     The album (partly recorded in Los Angeles and in Cherry Lips studios)
     has been co-produced by frontman, Richard Archer, with the help of
     some highly-praised names: Stuart Price (Killers, Madonna), Grey
     Kurstin (Lily Allen) and Alan Moulder (Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Killers). The
     first single from the four piece, 'Good For Nothing' is a true
     statement of intent; an anthemic rebel-rousing call to arms that
     signals the start of a new phase for the band. Produced by frontman
     Richard Archer, the single has already received a mass of support
     from radio with Zane Lowe naming it his Hottest Record In The World
     Right Now and also playing it during his stint covering for Chris
     Moyles. More Radio 1 support has come from Fearne Cotton and XFM have
     also added to their daytime playlist with DJ Steve Harris naming it
     his Single of the Week.
