SEE YA!!!"
,karriban,2011-08-18T19:50Z,"To anyone having constant crashing problems. If you actually followed the installation instructions from ANY of these torrents correctly, you shouldn't have a problem running this. Only a few obvious reasons why it wouldn't work

1. You fucked up somewhere while installing. 

2. Your computer has a virus or multiple viruses causing your computers functionality to spin down the shitter.

3. You may not be running as administrator or haven't allowed the program access through your firewall. This may not cause a crash but it can stop the game.

4. Your rig sucks and can't handle the game. Which is very likely as most people on torrents don't know shit about their hardware.

If you suspect the fourth one might be your problem, here's a way to check. Find out the minimum system requirements for the game. take note of them/ copy paste them somewhere for quick reference or whatever you like. Then press the start menu button and type ""dxdiag"" in the search bar. It'll bring up a window with all sorts of information on your system. Including processor, ram, os, gpu, and much more. Once there compare your notes to your system specs and determine if your rig can handle this game. If it doesn't, have fun buying a new one."

,cassandra_cain,2011-08-18T22:43Z,"This is apparently an awful PC port (not the cracker's problem) and people have had reports of crashing at certain point and not being able to progress beyond that. Steam are now offering refunds. 

I expect that Ubisoft will paper over the cracks at some point, so those of you with crashing problems may have to wait for an official fix."
,dsafjaly69,2011-08-18T23:19Z,"This release works,  thanks.  The game itself however, not so much.  I would suggest reading this. 
http://www.platformnation.com/2011/08/17/pc-port-of-from-dust-is-a-technical-mess/

I played for about an hour without any crashes, but man this is a mess, the controls are wild and there is a nearly total lack of performance customization, other than resolution.  In short, I give this release a 10/10,  but Ubi's port of this game a 3/10."
,Hogzor,2011-08-18T23:49Z,"Worst release ever.

people if you are having issues with it patching I suggest you wait for a better release.

11. When the game asks you for a serial, enter any number you like----bullshit; if entering any number I like would work then it should of worked.

FYI been pirating for years and I've always had issues with your cryptic ways of explaining your installs but this is alittle fucking ridiculous.
Much respect extremezone but I think its finally time you guys actually inspect what you are pushing down the pipe. Cuz half of your shit I truly don't believe you do, you take whats most popular and push it through; now this may not be the case but damn sure feels like it specially with this up."
,is2,2011-08-19T07:15Z,"Nice game! It also works on my setup, hasn't crashed once yet.

When you have patched the game and applied crack and are now looking some ubisoft window which wants username and password, click register and make an account. After you've cleared that click play and it asks for a serial. There you can enter whateva you want, like 111111111111111 as an example. 

About the hosts file, I think it can be put back after the install."
,is2,2011-08-19T07:19Z,"Oh, and i ran everything as admin, didn't have to move the hosts file and don't have uplay for any other game."
,is2,2011-08-19T07:33Z,"And remember to do this at the ubisoft window before clicking play, I did it from old memory, but it was in the crack only torrents instruction. It is found under the settings option in uplay window.

,karriban,2011-08-19T17:09Z,"I love how people complain about the game crashing or having bad controls, and then blame it on Ubisoft. 

The game runs fine, and the controls are actually very fluid on a keyboard and mouse setup. I seriously question the coordination of anyone who can't easily play this game.

and if you keep getting crashes, learn to install correctly or upgrade your rig."
,karriban,2011-08-19T17:21Z,"^^
to backup my last comment.

I'm actually running this game at 60+ fps constantly and having absolutely NO problems with controls. This is on a machine that would actually be considered fairly dated by now.

------------------------------------------------
System Specs:

Intel Core2 Quad Q6600 2.4 ghz (Mid grade quad core)

2x Nvidia Geforce 9400 GT 2287 MB (on an SLI config, GeForce 9 series is kinda old)

3 Gigs of RAM (system was originally designed for xp)

And Vista Home Premium os

The game runs flawlessly on my machine."

,Lucky13s,2011-08-19T22:03Z,"Once again, noobs with no computer skills fail at life and rage about it here.

Posting updated instructions...

PLEASE REPOST THIS EVERY PAGE!!

-----------------------


1. Mount iso file and run the setup.exe
2. Choose your language and follow the instructions on screen
3. Close the Ubisoft website that will open when you are done installing the game
4. Go to the your gamefolder and run From_Dust.exe
5. If it shows the game is updating go to step 8, if you get an error message go to step 6
6. Go to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc and move your Hosts file somewhere else
7. Go to your game folder and run From_Dust.exe again, it will now show you the game is patching
8. When the game is done patching close the window
9. Go to CRACKONLY folder and move UbisoftGameLauncher.exe to C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher
10. Run From_Dust.exe as the administrator (right click the file, properties, run as admin) and create a UPlay account
11. When the game asks you for a serial, enter any number you like
12. Got to the Uplay settings, DISABLE GAME SYNCING
13. Move your Hosts file back

Its not working cause you keep trying to sync to ubisoft with each launch, so it boots you out. DISABLET HE SYNC AND THE GAME RUNS.

For the idiots complaining about the crashing, ummm... you're using a crack, cracks are buggy, the retail game crashes 99% less than a cracked game."

,karriban,2011-08-19T22:34Z,"@is2: there is no fps cap at 30, and your retarded for thinking that. 30 fps would be skippy as hell to look at. hell even the pre-release videos were higher than 30 fps."

,Crunox,2011-08-19T22:52Z,"well the game has good graphics, but it gets boring after a while. all you do is modify the land and drown a few villagers to get some action...

heck, I even dropped lava on their village because their is no action at all! I thought this game was about creating a world so that your village can develop into a more advanced tribe or something.... like black and white 2.

This is definatly not a game for me and i'm not going to buy it.

just my 2 cents.."
,is2,2011-08-19T23:11Z,"If u dont believe me it is capped, use fraps and see for yourself. Or check the fps cap thread at Ubi forums."

,EvilCorporateWhore,2011-08-20T02:25Z,"@ Crunox

Kinda agree, although i'm still having fun playing it. I was hoping it would be a bit more like Civilization in the sense that the people become more advanced as you build up their land.

But i guess in it's defense, they probably didn't want to just make another Civ game, and it does indeed have it's own charms. I will keep playing and see if anything changes after i finish the first set of worlds... at least i'm hoping there's another set, i'd be pissed if that was the end of the game, lol.

,redrumpanda,2011-08-20T13:04Z,I also noticed the crack is smaller than the actual ubisoft gamelauncher which when you copy into that file doesn't copy over it you have to pysically delete the other file. Maybe that's why the crack isn't working?

I'll also state for the record that had this just used Steam for DRM, I would have bought it. But a constant check to Ubisoft's unreliable service is unacceptable. Get it through your head Ubisoft: Gamers will never support any online DRM community other than Steam. Accept it, or get the fuck out of the PC gaming market."
,azervayne,2011-08-21T03:14Z,"I feel I must warn the community that this game is terrible!

Immediately after posting the above comment I restarted the game (since I alt-tabbed) and started a game.

You cannot customize any graphical settings other than the resolution.

There are jaggies everywhere! No antialiasing on a PC game makes it unplayable. This isn't 2002 for god's sake, Ubisoft.

Zero ability to customize any graphical options - zero. Therefore, the game looks like shit: the texture is low, scene resolution is washed out, the color pallette is a weak mix of earth tones (somewhat understandable), but their hue is incorrect so it looks wrong).

There is no variety in the villagers, there's one body model for males and females and one type of clothing. When they run from far away all their legs are moving exactly the same (only one run animation and all in perfect sync - fucking lazy and ridiculous) destroying any sense of realism.

I could go on, but suffice it to say that I am REALLY happy I did not waste $15 on this obviously very poorly ported game.

I seriously pity console gamers that find these types of graphics acceptable. I realize graphics aren't everything (I still play AOE2, Rise of Nations, and ancient Source games), but console textures, no antialiasing features, and zero configuration just plain sucks.

In other words, this game isn't worth buying - it isn't even worth your bandwidth to pirate."
,xxhukkoxx,2011-08-21T07:37Z,"Worked perfectly. Although I will add that the crack needs to go to the C: Drive no matter where you install it to.

So you must exit that windows pressing ctrl + alt +del and then log in again and in options find the option to uncheck save syn. This way the game loaded the saved games fine.

,DragonXG,2011-08-23T12:59Z,"After trying the SkidRow (and the Offline fix) and the Kaos releases, FD still didn't work.
Running From_Dust.exe just got a small blank dialog.
I found a way to generate the UbisoftGameLauncher command line parameters, and using the Orbit folder was able to get into the Launcher, use any code, but when clicked Play, FD crashed.
Look in the launcher Logs, use a Base64 converter for the path and put it together in a BAT.
I found FD looking for the UGL in D:\, regardless of the registry saying otherwise.
The solution... I put the FD folder onto a blank USB drive and the 'contents' of the Orbit folder into the root of the same drive.
Sorry, I cannot remember where I got the UGL.exe that accepts any code, but it wasnt from KaOs or the SkidRow cracks. I tried many combos, so am not sure what came from where.
From_Dust.exe then worked, started the Launcher, which accepted any code, and Play ran the game.
Oh... another thing, I also use a Mimo 7"" USB LCD, managed by DisplayFusion.
The game wont run with the second 'monitor' on. Dungeons (Kalypso Media) has the same problem.
Hope this helps all those not able to play. Good luck."

This guy's just a moron, who only knows how to whine.
Seriously, he's whining about how PC games (notably Ubisoft's) suck, because of their DRM, while he's also whining that Console games suck, because of their graphics.
Yet here he is, pirating a PC game and giving publishers more reasons to sully our PCs with DRM.

,JMC17,2011-09-15T12:42Z,"Moving your host file for the installation should not have any bad effect unless you're currently blocking an IP. It's mostly because some people might have already modified it for another Ubisoft game and therefore blocking the authorization server.

Another way of doing this without modifying your host file is sniffing the packets using a program like Wireshark and block the found IP using another program like Peerblock.
Or just use Peerblock if you already know the IP to block. Because some games does the server check during the installation and others every time you start the game, it's interesting to use something else than the Host file, especially if you own a real copy of another game from the same company."

At first it was always crashing but i got the fix.
What you should do if the games crash by saying awaiting connexion or something like that:
So you follow the steps but when you have to update the game you MUST run the from dust shortcut, which is in the Start menu, as ADMINISTRATOR !
It will then check for the updates and install them and you will even have to restart you computer.
After that just copy your crack file in Ubisoft Game Launcher.
Then when you run the game you should hurry to press play because The launcher will crash but not the game :).
