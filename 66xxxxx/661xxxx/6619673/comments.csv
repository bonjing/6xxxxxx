Inside the Discus X folder you have a readme. It installs like most aerosoft products. Discus K does not ask any question to install.
@pmdgcrackwork
stop advertising for acessa.me. If you have something interesting to share, put it on TPB."
,rra137,2011-08-21T23:32Z,"For cumulus there is a Readme inside the folder.
You need to right click and run as administrator.
Install first the main program 'CumulusX.1.8.1' then the patch 'CumulusX.1.8.1-patch'"
