,Annyan,2011-08-18T15:04Z,"Works 100%, Thanks a lot!

Clearing up some things I had trouble with:
To update the game and Ubisoft Launcher, you have to go into 
C:>Program Files>Ubisoft>From Dust>support>GameUpdater>gu.eve

Also, open From_Dust.exe with admin. "

I've got the same issue.
here is the solution:
1. Download qtwebkit4.dll here:
http://www.down-dll.com/index.php?file-download=qtwebkit4.dll
2. extract it in your c:\windows\system32 folder
3. Run it again.

,thcfreak666,2011-09-18T19:50Z,"Don´t work more then one DLL is missing, seems to be a Fake."
,thcfreak666,2011-09-18T19:55Z,@ donßt lying pleas. Auftewr Cracking it doesn´t work !! Fake 2
,thcfreak666,2011-09-18T20:00Z,This is Fake. Crack is not Working please delete those Bullshit !
,h0bd0b1in,2011-10-09T04:35Z,The crack is working. Don't replace the UbisoftGameLauncher.exe in the From Dust directory. There is another one under Program Files\Ubisoft that you need to replace instead.
,jowjowjow,2011-10-09T14:32Z,FAKE - don't even try.... 
,maul485,2011-10-17T21:00Z,followed the directions to the letter and u no what? it worked. not fake. Shouting FAKE doesn't justify the fact that you don't know how to read and follow directions.
