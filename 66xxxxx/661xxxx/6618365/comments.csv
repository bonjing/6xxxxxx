,Nidf,2011-08-23T10:47Z,How I install it? I don't have coverage code.
,Nidf,2011-08-23T11:39Z,"New problem. CD #2 not find the jeppview folder, and I don't know where the folder, too."
,jcpilot,2011-08-23T20:37Z,"Jeppview was working fine before installing this update, afterwards, Jeppview is deactivated and the R00D-KCAB site code no longer works. Ideas?"
,flyingluc,2011-08-23T22:58Z,"I had some trouble after installing this update. this worked fine with me; I put the Jeppview program cd into my computer and choose the option "" repair my installation "" and then reinstalled the last update and it worked fine again. It's my solution, i don't want to take any responsibilities  if it put you in more trouble."

,wookie78,2011-08-26T18:08Z,"Guys, it is the first time I downloaded this soft-how can I make it working?I installaed it on my computer (disk 1) no desktop icon was created, no new shortcuts in the windows menu.Do I need additional software to run it?
Thanks "
,wookie78,2011-08-27T10:45Z,How to change site code so that site key will work with it?
,Nidf,2011-08-27T12:48Z,"wookie78, How did you install it?"
,warloot24k,2011-08-27T13:22Z,Great
,warloot24k,2011-08-27T13:32Z,"This is for you guys who are having a hard time installing jeppview:

1.  Install jeppview program 3.5
2.  Install cycle 01-2009 disk 1
         (If you don't have this cycle, you can         download it here in piratebay)
Full Worldwide : 207HF34080
VFR Europe    :  207HE34083
* The purpose of installing this update is for the site code to work (R00D-KCAB)
* Jeppview will ask for it after installing the cycle

3.  After installing the cycle and registered it..... you can now install the latest cycle.

Hope you guys understand this."
,wookie78,2011-08-27T17:57Z,"Nidf, I found somewhere on piratebay jeppview application (it was in one pack with 901 updates) I have installed it and then installed 1117 update and as I read this was my bad - I should've installed 901 update first to have 1117 update working. I haven't tried installing 901 first yet - I hope this sequence will work. Thanks warloot24k for your help"
,wookie78,2011-08-27T22:06Z,"Nidf, I've installed jeppview exactly the way warloot24k advised to and it works :) now I have to figure it out why I can't print charts to pdf files, but I guess it is more related to my pc configuration than to jeppview itself."
