I see no other notes of thanks although there is plenty interest, by the looks of this torrent's participation. Here is my personal note of thanks for your efforts on doing a bang up job of this great music. THANKS AGAIN"

,mkhoz,2011-09-02T11:55Z,"Thanks for this, trying to download it for my dad. Keep getting errors that stop it downloading. the only way i can get it to resume is to delete the 2 gig file ~uTorrentPartFile_31B2C4E10 [which is not any of the selected albums [or parts there of]. This has happened a whole bunch of times, and my % downloaded has actually gone backwards a few times. any ideas why? or what i can do to fix this?"
