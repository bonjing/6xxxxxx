SmartOS: The Complete Modern Operating System

SmartOS incorporates the four most revolutionary OS technologies of the past decade â€” Zones, ZFS, DTrace and KVM â€” into a single operating system, providing an arbitrarily observable, highly multi-tenant environment built on a reliable, enterprise-grade storage stack. With the introduction of KVM in SmartOS, you no longer have to give up the power of an enterprise-grade operating system in order to run legacy applications and stacks.
SmartOS turns any server into a highly efficient hosting platform for multi-tenant, machine-to-machine, or storage applications. SmartOS offers unique, innovative tools for application developers, service providers and data center operators â€“ tuned and hardened for modern datacenter deployment.
