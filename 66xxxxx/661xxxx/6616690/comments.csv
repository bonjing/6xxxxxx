First!  :)"
,Serraphin,2011-08-20T09:50Z,"VTV, thanks so much. a/v/m= 9/9/1000. Such an awesome show. Taped partly in San Pedro Port of LA. It's right by my appartment, like 2000 feet. Coincidentaly, dexter was filmed in my appartment and building. I love this town. Guy who wrote fight club, chuck palch(chnuk?) wrote about the area I live in too. So cool to pick up a book cause you love it and discover they are talking about where you grew up... even if it was about some homeless guy getting tied to a bench and burned alive... yeahh... anyway. Good work, and thank you. Go Torchwood and captin jack, and go San Pedro!"

Cheers VTV. Been checking tpb every few hours for this, especially after last week's dramatic final scene! Plus it's on here a few days b4 it airs in UK."
,machloop,2011-08-20T15:34Z,"San Pedro may be nice, I;m sure it has a better climate than Splot but it doesn't have a monopoly on spare drunks on park benches and Torchwood out of Cardiff is just wrong.
If the Yanks can't watch the real Torchwood then so be it but get the crew back to the UK quick !  Queen Victoria must be spinning if she can see this.

 to the OP - thanks for the upload.

,jvezirian,2011-08-21T03:57Z,Series probably would still be in the UK if the stiff Brits wanted to take a crowbar to their wallets and pay for the show.
,Occam1,2011-08-21T04:42Z,"@jvezirian
So let me get this straight - because a lot of this current series is set in the U.S, you think it's because the Brits didn't want to pay for it?  It's a BBC show!  The only reason they've done this is to make it a more ""available"" show to many Americans, who seem incapable of understanding dialogue unless it's got an American twang to it."
,efeffess,2011-08-21T10:56Z,"VTV - always anticipated, never disappointed. Thanks for the upload!"
,Popplewick,2011-08-21T17:04Z,"@Occam1

Actually the BBC cancelled Torchwood and wasn't going to do it anymore. They have done this with several shows, especially the more expensive ones to produce ever since the government told them they needed to start to turn a profit. So your statement of them moving it to the U.S. simply to make it more available to the American public who can't understand accents, is absolute rubbish. Torchwood would be dead if the American production companies hadn't taken an interest in it. You can also read several interviews with the BBC and John Barrowman about the move, so get educated and stop spouting trash."
,zanelee,2011-08-22T00:42Z,"Not written a comment yet, so let this be my first.  Thank you for the torrent first of all!

Torchwood was shelved by the BBC due to its cost, unfortunately the BBC will not share cost with its programmes in the UK with one of our commercial channels, however BBC Worldwide can, as long as it is not a British Commercial Channel.  Hence Starz becoming involved.

TBH I really don't care about the politics, the show is awesome!"
,nakedrobz,2011-08-23T04:10Z,"Torchwood would have been blindsided by Sherlock in my opinion, but it does irritate me that it's gone so American. I do, however appreciate lines like ""If you're the best England has to offer, god help you.” ...... “I'm Welsh.” *Facepunch* because it breaks the stereotype that we Brits have that Americans don't know fuck all about anything except America."
,TheSecretUchiha,2011-08-26T18:37Z,"I hope you will upload episode 8 today,if not today atleast tomorow,but i saw that someone already posted in on youtube.No torrents though..."
,spifkitten99,2011-08-27T01:43Z,"This is episode 6, not 7."
,noobsybot,2011-08-27T06:25Z,"""WARNING!!! MAY INVOKE THOUGHTS""

Thank you for the up VTV...I now wish I hadn't watched it. I know in real life Capt Jack loves the cock & if that's his thing more power to him (I don't wanna see it) I am a smooth pimp daddy who LOVES the pussy, but I'm losing interest fast in Queer as Folk meets Torchwood!!! Sorry but if I was into gay porn I'd be downloading it! I do not think Torchwood will last much longer...I'm American and I fucking HATE the way they are fucking up this show! Really a damn shame they steal from the U.K. then fuck it up really bad...Being Human enough said!!! I liked the original MUCH better this drawn out piece of shit it blows! I mean pick up the pace already...HEY ya jackhole it is time for a new plot! Hope they don't intend to keep this shit up! Grrr Take the show back to Cardiff for fuck sake!!! Thank you BBC for some pretty cool shows but God Damn it STOP letting them ruin the show state side!!!
Thanks for letting me rant for a little bit!
Peace out homeboys!!!

Long Live Pirate Bay!!!"
,MaskWhoRU,2011-09-04T19:36Z,thanks VTV! wish this wonderful show wasn't given to americans...(((
