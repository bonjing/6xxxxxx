,useitright,2011-08-18T16:57Z,"These people complaining about speeds are probably starting the download, waiting 10 seconds, and then writing a comment about seeds.  It takes time to acquire seeds so try waiting about ten minutes and then if it is still shit speeds then you can complain.  I am currently running at around 300 kB/s and it will be done in about an hour.  Remember patience is a virtue!  Thank you extremezone for another great upload.  I have always said and will always say that you are the best.  Keep up the good work."

 The audio required some fine tuning in order to hear what was being said clearly through my speakers (it would get drown out by music and bass), usually it doesn't need any altering.

Granted, it was not the best of the series it didn't even feature the same director. And half of the original cast also did not return. Blackbeard's character was awesome, however his first mate (Penelope Cruz) was dreadfully miss-cast and some of the story got really choppy. I have also never heard that any of my leaders think that Africa and Europe are the same country or continent for that matter.

All that i have to say is, now this is to those who think that they hate the US, China equals bad. The reason i am saying this is because they are the one nation that rivals our own. We give them free rice to establish a sort of unspoken treaty, means we aren't enemy's unless the rice disappears. This being said, If the US burns so does the entire world, because the only threat is China. (China + War = Atomic = War + US)World. Yes maybe America causes problems for other countries, but did you ever stop and think, In the US the Politicians have control not the People as all of you believe. Democracy is just the cover word for Capitalism. So stop and think, you getting irate at the America Citizen for something they most likely don't know about themselves.

,Pirate_P,2011-10-23T18:04Z,"MisterYamamoto your comments are retarded. America has the best economy even now simply because we have more freedom. Oh wait, yes... I have your TV and computer I took from your house. Yeah that must be it. NOT! 

Do we have some stupid people in the USA? Sure we have a few. And your comments are proof you have stupid people in your country as well. ;-) 

MisterYamamoto, when you see a fat man standing beside a thin one do you come to the conclusion that the fat man got that way by taking advantage of the thin one?

Yes Mr Yamamoto America is so bad millions come to live here. Mr Yamamoto can you please tell me what utopia you live in. Are people yearning to get in or out of your country? Perhaps you should fight for freedom where you live... or just come here to follow your dreams. :-) 

The USA is the only country deliberately founded on good ideas. OK you were not born in America, but I suggest you get here as fast as you can so you can find out what it is about.

""America is a nation with many flaws, but hopes so vast that only the cowardly would refuse to acknowledge them.""  ~James Michener"
,Pirate_P,2011-10-23T19:04Z,"MisterYamamoto FYI I ride my bicycle to work for health and we grow most of our own vegetables. We eat healthy which includes fruits, vegetables, hamburgers, pizza and any other food people eat around the world. Whatever you eat can be found in any city in the USA. We can do this because we are free as in ""freedom"". 

MisterYamamoto as a citizen of the USA you would be a sovereign citizen aka citizen king. It means you would have rights the Government cannot take away without due process. Here in the USA we create wealth and opportunity. If you work hard here be assured you will be allowed to keep the fruits of your labor. We do not guarantee equality, only equal opportunity to follow your dreams. 

To be a citizen you do not need to be born into any particular race. The citizens are a diverse people, many came here by choice. You do not need to be born here to become a citizen of the USA. The USA is a constitutional republic. A pure Democracy is nothing more than mob rule with no provisions for the rights of the individual. Our Founding Fathers saw this as one of the worst forms of government and in their wisdom provided a framework to secure the rights of the individual, ie., a Constitution and a Bill of Rights with separation of powers subject to Judicial Review which is the ""Rule of Law""Â we live under. A constitutional republic is designed so that ""no person or group [can] rise to absolute power."" Still our government is trying hard to take our freedoms and is why we must fight for our freedoms every day. 

Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same. ~Ronald Reagan"
,wilks130177,2011-10-23T20:30Z,"Sorry Guys new to this, however I had to write a comment to MisterYamamoto?? Before you begin to slag off our allies we have had in all major conflicts in the last 73 years, let me remind you of a small word called gramma !!!! This is the study of words and their component parts combing to form sentences. It uses structural relationships in language or in a language, sometimes including pronunciation, meaning, and linguistic history, ( something you have no knowledge off), in short get a grip wank splatt!!"

,hachiko00,2011-10-28T14:05Z,"Fuck you Pirate_P

As someone that lived in your shithole of a country, YES, it is shit. Maybe you should actually LEAVE IT and see another country before mouthing off. 

Many countries have the same or MORE freedoms than your country. Northern European countries not only have more freedoms, but they also have lower heath costs and less teen pregnancies because they don't teach ridiculous bible belt birth control. 

I got news for you, people are not running to your country. They are running from it. 

You keep railing on some sense of freedom. You are just another fucking Republican retard. Growing your own vegetables because you are fre...are you a fucking retard? YES, you are. This only shows just how fucking ignorant and myopic you are...typical ""Merican."" 

Do you even know the limitations of so called freedom in your country? I think not. The Patriot Act in and of itself treats all of you as criminals until proven innocent. Body scanners at airports, photographers beaten for taking pic of buildings, or even worse a kid and deemed ""child molester."" haha idiots

Your country was founded on good ideas? hahahah The ideas are NOT American and came from the other* countries out there that continue to enjoy far more freedoms than you. Your contry built itself on the DEATHS of native Indians, slave labor and Chinese migrants. So please go fuck yourself and your white horse. 

Your country denies evolution
Your country is 70% overweight if not more
Your country believe in a sky god and denies science
Your country KILLED more innocent civilians in Iraq than Saddam ever did
Your country is a FUCKING JOKE"
,worthlesz,2011-10-29T23:56Z,"""Your Contry denies evolution...""
Really? How? Because I for one have never seen that as the case.

""Overweight""
Using a scale that is inherently flawed. The scale becomes broken for any person over 5'8"" automatically placing them in overweight or obese category. Micheal Jordon at the hieght of his career was at a 35 on the scale (30 is the start of obesity).

""Sky God yadda yadda"" 
A Sky god, like the egyptian god Ra (sun) or the greek gods of any of the other gods out there found in every ancient civilization of the world. As to denying science, as one of the foremost countries in science, that is a invalid statement. Not to mention have you actually read origin of the species of any of the great scientific works from history. They are all praising a god for his magnificence in the creations of these amazing systems.

""Killing Innocents""
Im not over there, can't say anything on this topic. Hey, you aren't either, so you really shouldn't speak about it at all. I can say millions of US tax payer dollars have been spent in infrastructure being built since the Arab, Europe and Asian countries since World War 2, after we finished a war that the rest of the world started.

""Fucking Joke""
This one i don't even under stand. What about us makes us a joke. Sure, we have entertainment and comedians, but that is what happens when you have a country that worked its ass of for 150 years (we have had a few years off time and again)

And about your comment about Freedoms. You really have no idea what your talking about. Beaten up for taking pictures of building. I would rather have that then in some Arab areas, where you flash a camera, and the guards just shoot you."

,AntiLeacher,2011-10-30T02:19Z,"hachiko00, shutup and enjoy the torrent that came from our country. god damn. some people are so f*ing stupid. Yeah Americans are overweight, doesnt mean we're fat. It means we weigh more than you. And alot of that is because we actually work out in something called ""gyms"". Its a new term for you, ik, enjoy the torrent or the fuck off the pirate bay"

,XRoTtEnX,2011-11-23T05:47Z,"Enough with your fucking absurd argument about how much you think other countries suck. 
People just suck, as is evident from the foreigner nonsensically bashing on america. Arguing with them is futile, they're obviously an idiot.

Just shrug it off, and save comments for remarking on the torrent quality and such, which I will do after it downloads.
