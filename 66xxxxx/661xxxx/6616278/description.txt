From the Infowars web site ::

On this Friday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex welcomes retired NYPD officer Frank Serpico to discuss police corruption and the drug war. Serpico's experiences as a police officer were dramatized in the 1973 film Serpico, which starred Al Pacino in the lead role. 

Alex also welcomes Richard Reeves in studio to talk about Ron Paul's presidential campaign and how you can get involved with local issues in your community. 

Regular Friday guest Bob Chapman also makes an appearance to discuss gold hitting new all time records as the stock market plunges and the economy continues to decline. 

In a full 4th hour overDrive Alex and Richard Reeves talk with Robert Morrow (Ron Paul supporter and Perry critic), who has run an ad asking "Have you ever had sex with Rick Perry" seeking strippers/escorts/"hotties" or gay men who've had sexual encounters with Perry and are willing to help expose Perry's hypocrisy.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
