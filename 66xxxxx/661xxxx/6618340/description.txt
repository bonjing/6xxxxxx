THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR

THIS IS AVATAR 3D IN ONE PIECE. 


I INCLUDED SAMPLES OF THE 1 PART VERSION AND THE 3 PART VERSION SO YOU CAN DECIDE IF THE DIFFERENCE IN VIDEO QUALITY IS WORTH THE FILE SIZE STORAGE..I THINK IT IS BUT SOME PEOPLE DON'T CARE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, THEY JUST WANT AVATAR...


THIS WILL WORK ON ANY 3D TV, PERIOD.  HOW??..  CUZ I'M THAT GOOD.





FOR ANYONE WHO COMPLAINS ABOUT THE VIDEO QUALITY JUST UNDERSTAND THIS:
    YOU CAN ONLY HAVE FILE SIZES OF 4Gb AND UNDER.  WHICH LEAVES PEOPLE LIKE ME
    AND YOU STUCK BETWEEN UNDERSTANDING WHY FAT32 WAS THEIR DISK FORMAT CHOICE AND
    ALSO WHY WAS THE EVO 3D RELEASED WITH ONLY AN 8G CARD....I DID MY BEST BELIEVE 
    ME I WENT THROUGH ABOUT A DOZEN CONVERTING PROGRAMS EACH WITH THEIR OWN PRO'S
    AND CON'S... BUT HERE YOU HAVE IT---AVATAR 3D IN ONE PIECE WITHOUT THE CREDITS




THIS IS THE BEST AVATAR CAN BE VIEWED ON THE EVO 3D IF ITS NOT SPLIT INTO PIECES.
