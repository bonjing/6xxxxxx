,Alosia,2011-08-22T17:02Z,"they made a change to this version than in the original release. the edited out that ""sex"" controversial bit that happens about 52 minutes into the movie. instead of leaving it the way it was and going into the next scene right at the cue with the music, the had it fade into the next scene. it feels a little weird now because the scene doesnt change with the music, and because it isnt truly the original theatrical release anymore. im a little upset that disney did this. they should have made the bluray exactly the same as the original theatrical release.

Within the first few seconds of the movie, the following appears, ""RIPPER~BONIIN"". Not sure why the uploader chose to slap his or her verbiage on the movie but it does not take away from the overall movie. 

As to the previous poster's comment about the edited scene, here is more information. According to this website...

http://www.lionking.org/misc/SexSighting/

...the original movie has a hidden image of the word ""sex"" as Simba flops down at the end of a grassy cliff. My opinion, this is much ado about nothing. The word is not visible and this issue only came about because of the conspiracy theorists who love to stir up trouble.

In this version, the scene is still there but, as Alosia mentioned, the scene fades out as Simba flops on the grassy edge. No need  to make more of this than there needs to be...it's a non-issue.

Excellent work uploader. Thank you."
