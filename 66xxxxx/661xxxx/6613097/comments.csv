,richardpa,2011-08-18T20:30Z,"Nice PPVRip and a steady download...
A/8
V/8
Decent rip for a PPV, picture quality is pretty good and the audio keeps in sync and sounds like line audio to me (There's no background noise or muffled audience sounds like there is with CAM/TS audio) I don't think the source is an R6 DVD copy though...
Many Thanx to Hero_No_1 and CHOiCE for the decent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:)"
