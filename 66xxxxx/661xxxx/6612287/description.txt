SOCIOLOGY: THE ESSENTIALS, Sixth Edition, uses the theme of debunking myths to look behind the facades of everyday life; challenge ready-made, common-sense assumptions; and help students develop critical thinking skills and better understand how society is constructed and sustained. This thorough but streamlined text provides exceptional coverage of diversity, including social factors such as age, religion, sexual orientation, and region of residence, in addition to race, ethnicity, class, and gender. The text employs a reader-friendly presentation and very manageable structure, even while maintaining a strong focus on sociology concepts, methods, and research. The new edition includes coverage of the latest research and current trends and themes.
