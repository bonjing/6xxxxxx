NBA Rules History (X):
----------------------

Take a look back at some of the rules changes that have taken place over the years.
(Changes/clarifications implemented prior to season, except where noted) 
-------
1966-67
-------
- The team foul limit is reduced to five per quarter. In the last two minutes of any period, a team is allowed only one foul before the penalty, even if it hadnâ€™t used up its allotment.
- The following language was added to the Zone Defense Rule: "After the offensive team has advanced the ball to its front court, a defensive player may not station himself in the key area longer than three seconds if it is apparent he is making no effort to play an opponent. The three second count starts when the offensive team is in clear control in the front court."
