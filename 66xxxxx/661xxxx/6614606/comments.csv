,jamesav21,2011-08-19T21:10Z,the framerate changes dramatically playing via WD TV Live. re-encoding as of this moment to see if it changes anything.
,SuperArmy,2011-08-19T22:54Z,"how the fuck is 1280x544   720p ???
"
,gask8,2011-08-20T00:17Z,"  awesome, i was waiting a good quality release for a long time. 
   Thanx "
,nephmalkus,2011-08-20T01:43Z,"@ Superarmy.

544 + black bars (because it isn't 16:9) = 720

Thus, 720p.

Media players automatically add the bars, there is no need for them to be included in the actual video."
,master2pc,2011-08-20T01:48Z,seeeeeeeeeeeedddddddddddddddddd
,Xenn99,2011-08-20T02:07Z,"@Superarmy,

this problem can only be written towards the producer of the movie, 
who was too lazy to fix a decent dvd format and instead just used the cinema widescreen :P

(in other words, the original bluray has this format too)"
,AidyD,2011-08-20T04:34Z,"If you want smaller file sizes and quicker downloads then gtfo out the high res section dumbasses...

3 gigs is actually kind of small for a HD rip too.

Anyway thx uploader appreciated"
,Diumelia,2011-08-20T12:59Z,Very nice quality! Thank you very much!

,l3ZoOoZl,2011-08-22T08:54Z,too slow !!
,MacTee,2011-08-22T22:33Z,"Why do some people ALWAYS gotta bitch about the speed.  Its a new fukkin torrent, of coarse the speed will fluctuate madly until the ratio is seeders > leechers.  Calm down and just let it download.  I'm sure you can find something else to do besides watch it download in utorrent and complain about it in the comments."
,pvt.db,2011-08-23T09:09Z,so damn slow!!!
,jawelch2,2011-08-23T21:49Z,Anyone getting the AC3 audio error

ThankYou UPLOADER!"
