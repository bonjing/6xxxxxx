Lee Strobel - The Ambition (Audio Book)


A corrupt judge in a mob murder case. A disillusioned pastor, hungry for power. A cynical reporter, sniffing or a scandal. A gambling addict whose secret tape threatens the lives of everyone who hears it. New York Times bestselling author Lee Strobel weaves these edgy characters into an intricate thriller set in a gleaming, suburban megachurch, a big-city newspaper struggling for survival, and the shadowy corridors of political intrigue. The unexpected climax is as gripping as the contract killing that punctuates the opening scene.

Length: 8hrs 28 min
