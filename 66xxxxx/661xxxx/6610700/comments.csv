[T],insinuendo,2011-08-17T23:12Z,When it becomes available
,An9ryN00b,2011-08-19T04:04Z,"Great Quality, but the letters DDR are hard coded for about 10 seconds during the entrance song (53 seconds in)."
,securitybi,2011-08-24T20:05Z,"Why? Dear God Why?

Why would anyone take a classic movie and superimpose ""DDR"" over it?

Yes. I get that your proud of your nickname. And I do appreciate you taking the time and bandwith to upload the movie. But please do us all a favor: Don't molest the movie you're uploading with this garbage.

May we please just have the movie in its entirety WITHOUT any additional graphics or superimposed text on it.

Is this a sign of things to come? Are uploaders going to start adding watermarks and logos to the films they upload? Sheesh! I thought it was bad enough to watch TV with all the CRAP they place over the movie...and NOW uploaders are doing it?!?

I'm deleting this ruined piece of crap right now! What a waste of bandwith.

P.S. In the future, if you ARE going to upload movies that have your nickname superimposed on them -- PLEASE LET US ALL KNOW!

Many of us film purists WON'T BOTHER to waste our time downloading it and will instead wait for an UN-MOLESTED version of the movies we love.

(I wish I would have waited a little longer to download. Then I would have seen An9ryN00b's comment!)"
,suiggy,2011-08-25T11:08Z,AMEN to what securitybi said.

[T],insinuendo,2011-08-25T19:04Z,"Scene releases and better P2P group releases will follow shortly...For now this is the best encode...

Enjoy a little molestation meanwhile :)"
,squee666,2011-08-26T13:32Z,"May i say this release isnt worth it.
Cudos for the upload but cmon
Hardcoding a logo
and 15mb/s Bitrate for a 1 hour 30min animated films from the 90's.
Seriously though even avatar 1080p has a 8mb/s bitrate this is just basically a waste of space. clearly this can be half the size with no losses."
,Zernat,2011-08-26T23:17Z,Could someone upload screen from this move with this DDR?
,kennedyb4,2011-10-28T18:37Z,"Hardcoding aside,the size of the torrent is not useful. It cannot be burned to disc without re-encoding.

Its only 1.5 hours and 7.95 gigs would have been adequate quality.

Try using 2 pass encodes to hit your size more accurately and leave the hard coding off.

Thanks all the same though."
,bobdevis,2012-03-01T08:16Z,"Haha logo for 10 secs.. 
securitybi your seriously overreacting.

anyway 10Gigs is  maybe a little too much. Animated content like this can be MUCH smaller. Tip: encoder to a certain Quality (CRF) and let the encoder decide how big the movie becomes. Add a nice 5.1 AAC 384Kbps audio track or so. For the real quality psychotics theres always the 40GB BluRay image..."
