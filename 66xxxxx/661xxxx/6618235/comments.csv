,Mr.Lucifero,2011-12-16T17:27Z,"Nice copy of this terrific & under-rated Cagney outing!!!....It took me 2 weeks to download this flick!!! That's what happens when there's only one seeder....Anyway, it was well worth it because there are only 3 torrents of this film on TPB and this is the only working one....One is dead & the other one stops downloading at 99.8%...Which believe it or not, actually affect the overall viewing pleasure.....Soooo, if you're gonna download this film....Please, please, please make sure you seed for AT LEAST the same amount of time that it took you to download it (More would be better)....This is too good of a film to let this torrent die and besides, in my opinion, no torrent should ever die....There's no need so stop being so selfish, will ya??? Afterall, it doesn't cost you anything extra to seed!!! I, myself, will be seeding till the end of the year and BTW, just so you know, currently there's 2 seeders as of December 16/2011....Anyway, here's my rating for this film....V/M=8/8.5....Essentially, DVD like quality...BTW, I don't rate the audio unless it is extremely bad.....And thank you to TvTeam for uploading this terrific movie.... 8)"
