And what about

The Last Train to Dachau by Robert B. Niklewicz

That's all thanks!!"
,GreyHeckler,2011-09-03T19:32Z,Something wrong with the timing on this rip. Mp3 track sounds normal but 1 sec of play takes an actual realworld 8secs so the graphics are continuously slipping out of sync. MRH82 plays fine along with all other mp3+cdg. Can someone else test to confirm?

Not up to karaokeking123 usual standard"
,GreyHeckler,2011-09-25T09:20Z,Karaokeking123 - PLEASE can you you re-rip this release and hopefully solve the bitrate and timing issues. Many thanks.
