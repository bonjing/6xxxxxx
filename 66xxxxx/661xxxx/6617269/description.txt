After the success of Â« Utopies Â» and Â« Baldamore Â» (50 000 albums sold) and
having been awarded the prestigious prize â€˜Victoires de la Musique Jazzâ€™ in
2008, Hadouk Trio is back with a new album, taking us a step further towards and
into an ethereal world.

Following in the footsteps of Hermann Melville and Saint Exupery, Hadouk give us
escapism. Welcome aboard Air Hadouk! Fly â€˜Aerozenâ€™ on a hedonistic
interplanetary flight to emerging destinations.

The line of sight: the horizon where external influences and intimacy meet, and
from which point the continents redraw themselves exploring the beginning of new
instrumental metamorphoses.

Thus the khen, the Laotian mouth organ, is wrapped in electrical energy, the
hang, a mix between a steel drum and a gamelan, enters into the world of
chromaticism; the doudouk steps into of the shoes of jazz, le hajouj, a bass
originally from the desert made from camels skin becomes a piccolo, heightening
the tone; the appearance of the bahu flute, with its free Chinese reed, creates
a wave of movement. Aiming at the azure, Hadouk purifies the lines, becoming
lighter and rising up into the atmosphere. Swings and loops, high voltage
rhythms and gliding harmonies, our 3 co-pilots opt for free style. But they also
know how to help you land gently with no turbulence. Enjoy your flight!
