More than a dozen nations tried to warn U.S. authorities that the country was about to be attacked, as documented in my book The Terror Conspiracy. Incredibly, such warnings came from members of the Taliban in Afghanistan and even from Fidel Castro in Cuba.

Then there is the issue of war game exercises being conducted on the morning of the attacks. The fact of these exercises was initially denied and accused of being an Internet rumor. But, more than a year after 9/11, National Security Council counter-terrorism chief Richard A. Clarke acknowledged these exercises, which may have played an important role in confusing the U.S. defense systemsâ€™ response. In his book Against All Enemies, Clarke stated that when he first contacted the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Richard Meyers, to see if any interceptors had been launched, Meyers responded, â€œWeâ€™re in the middle of â€˜Vigilant Warrior,â€™ a NORAD [North American Aerospace Defense Command] exercise â€¦â€ When Lt. Col. Dawne Deskins, a NORAD airborne control and warning officer, received word regarding the hijackings, she immediately thought, â€œIt must be part of the exercise.â€

Army Sgt. Lauro â€œLJâ€ Chevez, who participated in the war games exercises as a member of the U.S. Central Command headquarters staff in Florida, said this was the first military exercise that he had ever participated in that was classified â€œTop Secret.â€ Chevez dropped several bombshells in his account of that dayâ€”he noted that Vice President Dick Cheney had become the first civilian to take command of NORAD only weeks before 9/11; that the war game exercises included a scenario in which a hijacked commercial airliner was crashed into one of the World Trade Center towers (â€œWhat are the odds this could happen for real?â€ Chevez quoted staffers as asking); that false images called â€œinputsâ€ representing several hijacked aircraft were placed on radar screens creating confusion over what was real; and that a superior officer said that Cheney had issued a â€œstand downâ€ order to jet interceptors.
