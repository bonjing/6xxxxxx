,Nash6989,2011-09-08T09:45Z,they really need to make a sequel to this movie.. i fucking love zombie movies. its just sad that 9 out of 10 of them fucking suck donkey balls. this one though.. FUCKING AWESOME! i actually after watching this i had a similar but very vivid dream about this movie.. fucking scary shit.. i woke up and actully thought the world was ending. thats how fucking real it was.. i recommend taking some melatonin sleep aid. watch this and then go to bed. maybe we will share the same dream

Did you take too much Ambien, stay awake and post retarded comments all night in a half asleep stupor? And the world really is coming to an end, that wasn't just in your dream!!!"
,scottsasse,2011-09-13T04:46Z,"Just finished watching this movie and it was pretty good, maybe a 7 out of 10. Only reason I rated at 7 was because the music was really awesome. Without the music it would have been maybe a high 4 or low 5.Video quality was a 9. Audio was a little hard to understand in a few scenes so I rate it at 6. Still a very good rip considering the small file size. Good job .BONE. and THANKS again!!! I will add a plus 1 quality rating to this torrent despite the audio issue..................................................................................It would be so awesome if someone out there could upload the soundtrack from this movie, preferably in FLAC. If anyone knows where I can get it please let me know at  drwynnscott@gmail.com  And I must say thanks to all you seeders out there. Lightning fast download!! Anyhoo, Peace & Love People, DrScott"
