,eyeshield.21,2011-08-23T01:34Z,"Never complain about your releases' quality so far.

But I think it will be interesting if you re-create the 4 previous versions, YIFY. So we could have a harmonious collection.

Just my opinion. Hope you will read this comment.

Btw, can't wait for your website. :D"
,albokid89,2011-08-23T06:29Z,"ayo YIFY welcome back first of all man you were gone for a bit. The site kicks ass mate! This movie is by far like the best upload youve done ma man it has everything from action to comedy to a bit of drama etc. It is epic! +1 i didnt see any problems with video/audio i guess the negative motherfuckers  dont know hoe to appreciate the free things in life! Anyways great job, keep action and comedy alive and do more movies like such!

p.s. if you could do the whole collection of this in one would be amazing.

Thanks, a lot!

There is a time difference between the soundtrack

match with the lips movement..
I must say this to avoid this problem in the future
as u can

Thank u very much"
