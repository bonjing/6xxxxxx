,shane2724,2011-08-22T08:37Z,how do i install this game. seems very confusing. pls help
,ToiletClown,2011-08-22T21:18Z,Have you read the instructions?
,Rullstolen95,2011-09-01T21:45Z,"I've downloaded it and everything, but I can't find a file to mount"
,Micktory,2011-09-02T01:41Z,"read everything, installed and blocked before running, when i put in serial it asks for a email and password even tho it's blocked, fyi very experienced with torrents and cracks, not an r-tard."
,cheesedelux,2011-09-03T16:06Z,"In case it isn't clear (Which it isn't entirely if you haven't come across this kind of download before) you have to open one of the .[number] files with winrar and extract, it will extract all of the numbered files and give you an .iso to mount."
,rinshun,2011-10-07T04:26Z,"If the game opens a launcher asking for email and password close it.

You will need to disconnect from internet then start the game again. 

You are able to reconnect to the internet after the game started, but you will need to disconnect every time you double click the .exe to run the game."
