Apple doesn't consider this a problem, as they have discontinued support through Apple Care for wi-fi and Airport related problems. Stick with the Gold Master of Lion, or Snow Leopard. Look into this in the Apple forums and you will see what I mean.

No disrespect to ArtieChoke, good work and all that shite, but this will fuck up your Airport. "
