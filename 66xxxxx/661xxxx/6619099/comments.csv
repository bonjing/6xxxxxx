,saraslave,2012-02-19T11:07Z,"amouly, there are seven different official cuts of this film, and they are all of interest to fans of this film as this film has a very interesting history. Getting some of these cuts in a higher quality version is very rare. Kudos to the uploader for uploading this. It's nice to have a 1.3x gig version of the international theatrical cut. This is my favorite version anyway. Lots of different cuts of this film, see the wiki article here:

There are also some very interesting fan cuts of note which are worth viewing and of interest."
