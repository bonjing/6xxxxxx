,kronflux,2012-05-05T14:17Z,"To anyone who thinks this is a Trojan or Virus of some kind: The reason is because the installer is a custom one by ""TEAM ASSiGN"" which gets flagged by any crappy antivirus.

Seriously.. Use ESET Smart Security 5 or ESET NOD32 Antivirus 5.. >,>
On top of that, the pink little skull beside the user's name? indicates they are Trusted. People don't get trusted by uploading viruses. idiots."
