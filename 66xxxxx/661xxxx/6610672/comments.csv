,Exeleration-G,2011-08-17T18:49Z,"This is strange. At the moment, the seed has downloaded 100% (which you would expect). The peers however, all show a download ratio of 27%. It looks like the seed tries to send all peers the same pieces of information (if the full package would be A untill M, the seed is now sending part A first, then part B, then part C...). It'd be better if the seed could send part A to one peer, B to another, C to another, so that the peers could download from each other as well. Is the seed aware of this?"
