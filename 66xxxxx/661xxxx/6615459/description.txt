Scientific American (informally abbreviated SciAm) is a popular science magazine. It is notable for its long history of presenting science monthly to an educated but not necessarily scientific public, through its careful attention to the clarity of its text and perhaps especially the quality of its specially commissioned color graphics. Einstein is among the many famous scientists who have contributed articles in the past 150 years.
