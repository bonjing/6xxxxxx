This is a collection of all the chocolate frog cards from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets video game, along with the text from the back of each card.

There are no pictures for the reverse side. In the game, the front side is shown on one side of a journal, and the text is shown on the other side.

These are NOT the chocolate frog cards from Honeydukes at the Harry Potter theme park.

Enjoy!
