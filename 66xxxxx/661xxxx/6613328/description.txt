Salix is a linux distribution based on Slackware that is simple, fast and easy to use. Salix is also fully backwards compatible with Slackware, so Slackware users can benefit from Salix repositories, which they can use as an 'extra' quality source of software for their favorite distribution. Like a bonsai, Salix is small, light and the product of infinite care.
