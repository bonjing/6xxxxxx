Quite a nice song from "Return Of The King" (1980) which has achieved kind of a cult status. World Without Sundays made a cover for "Ringers: Lord Of The Fans" (2005)

As there wasn't a simple MP3 download to be found anywhere I've made one. As I hate it if everything is not properly tagged or has no album art I've supplied those to the best of my abilities.
