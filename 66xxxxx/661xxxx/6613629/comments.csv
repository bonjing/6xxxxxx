,abhikrit,2011-08-18T22:54Z,i will agree with holyroses
,drsimcox,2011-08-19T01:50Z,Brilliant! I've wanted this for months! and in my favourite video file format :D
,ZR145,2011-08-19T08:51Z,It says bluray why would anyone ask about the quality? Pretty obvious.
,Vegasbob,2011-08-20T12:15Z,Does the sound just suddenly click a bit and fade out to nothing at about 43:10 for anyone else? 
,Vegasbob,2011-08-20T12:19Z,After testing i've seen that for some reason something encoded or corrupted in the file triggers a sound fade out on GOM player at right about the 43:00 mark. If I restart the movie and start past this point it is fine though. 
,dkent555,2011-08-20T20:06Z,"Excellent quality, fast download. Thanks."
,SlimShadyBama,2011-08-23T13:29Z,"I really liked this movie, Ithought this might be will farrell's best role to date a very poignant and moving.  i'm not a w.f. fanboy usually ever...great quality upload, and a damn fine film i.m.h.o.

p.s. if you are perfect in a perfect life you may not enjoy this film....to the rest of us- enjoy!"
