Englands Worst Ever Football Team

History Documentary hosted by Dean Lennox Kelly, published by BBC in 2010 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

A quest to reveal the worst England team of all time. Through a mix of archive footage and talking heads, including Neil 'Razor' Ruddock and Mark Lawrenson, the show is a light-hearted yet somewhat heated debate over who should win a place on the shamed team. No-one is safe, as the criteria is not just based on blunders on the pitch but also dodgy haircuts and misdemeanours that occurred in nightclubs and recording studios.
