,jesterc,2011-08-21T16:50Z,"I have downloaded alot from Charlesfire a load of stuff and never had any problems, I downloaded the movie and it may be a bit dark but it is what it says it is I ran it with media player classic and it works fine maybe get off your ass and update some codecs or something as for charles he is a life saver as I am from a country that internet is insanely expensive and we are years behind on series and with his small downloads I get to keep up. so if you dont like his downloads dont down load them. I do have a request for you charlesfire Dr who starts friday can you maybe shrink that too lol im a huge fan"
,jesterc,2011-08-21T16:51Z,it does work update your codecs maybe and charles thanks mamn appricate the small downloads can you maybe add dr who to your list it starts again next week
