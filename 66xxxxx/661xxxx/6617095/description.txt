[Notes]

Tripper, the fifth Fruit Bats full-length, was recorded at WACS Studio in
Los Angeles with Thom Monahan. For the first week of recording, Fruit Bats
leader Eric D. Johnson brought in a full band to capture some of the live
excitement of 2009's The Ruminant Band. However, having recently worked
alone on soundtracks for an extended period, Johnson knew that he wanted
Tripper to be more of a solitary pursuit than his previous album. The
resulting album, a bittersweet meditation on hitting the road, leaving the
familiar behind and reinventing yourself, is a reinvention itself.
