 He knows everything about nothing... and       
 he's on a mission to destroy himself! He is    
 Chatur Singh 2 Star, an infamous member of     
 the Mumbai Police Department who, in his       
 career, has been most successful at botching   
 up cases and making a fool of himself. In      
 spite of being a disgrace to the team, Chatur  
 Singh has just been handed the biggest case    
 in the department's history and of course,     
 this is the perfect chance for him to prove    
 everyone why he is the best officer they have. 
 Chatur Singh takes off on the secret mission   
 to South Africa and he immediately ensures     
 that there is trouble for all, because he is   
 the biggest trouble of all! His antics are     
 hazardous to health and definitely likely to   
 cause serious injury; he is absolutely         
 clueless and yet he keeps stumbling on all
