,soldier8707,2011-10-11T21:00Z,what program should i get to read the files this is my first time on here
,Snowmobiler624,2011-10-18T06:08Z,"First thanks for the upload :)
Second thanks for seeding guys I will return the favor!
And third @soldier8707 they are rar files which are like the mac version of vip so if you have a mac UnRarX is a great free program to uncompress if on windows I don't know of an exact program but I'm sure you can google rar converter for windows and find a free one. 
Cheers "
