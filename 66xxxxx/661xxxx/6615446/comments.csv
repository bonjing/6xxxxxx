As the saying goes, Be careful what you wish for."
,karly_w,2011-08-20T00:23Z,"ojmccon, same disclaimer for the files I put up a couple of days ago. Thanks in advance for these. Would love to know where they come from, but I guess I'll be surprised. In my opinion, the impotence ones are the most dangerous, including ""soft"" by Mind Mistress... but the ones aimed at changing sexual preference are surprisingly effective as well."
,ojmccon,2011-08-20T09:51Z,"Karla, you're welcome and I agree with your opinions. Caveat emptor, I suppose.

After downloading, right-click on each file. Select Properties and then the Details tab. There you will find additional information."
