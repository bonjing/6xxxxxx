,jeannibordelli,2011-08-27T19:39Z,"hello,

For which Garmin-devices or series can this map be used?
Could you give me some device numbers? Thanks in advance!
"
,Ipmark,2011-08-28T09:58Z,"The map works on all Nuvis, GPS phone with MobileXT and Garmin devices that support NT technology.

Junction view and 3D buildings are supported by a large number of models, most recent.

Take a look at Garmin site for the full lists of features."
,watervansaustralia,2011-08-28T13:13Z,"Hey there Ipmark
I am new here, I have installed BitTorrent Miro & IliVid I have registered here at TPB & still saying 10061 connection refused. I have dissabled firewalls & antivirus so what else can I do or have I done all the wrong stuff as I still can't download any of your files.... Please help n tell me how to get connected I been trying for days . cheers tony"
,Ipmark,2011-08-28T14:53Z,"I can not understand what could be your problem.
Maybe your DSL provider blocked in some way your Bittorrent?
Try using utorrent instead of Bittorrent and check whether other users in your area have the same problem.
I see that many Australian users are downloading my files, so I think that this is not a widespread problem."
,Ipmark,2011-08-28T14:56Z,Have you this problem only with MY torrents or with ALL torrents ?
,revvv01,2011-09-02T14:48Z,"I am going crazy. It says status not lockable. I put the .gmap folder in C:\ProgramData\GARMIN\Maps.
Than what I do with gmapsupp.img, jvc and gmap3d.img? Can you help me step by step?"
,Ipmark,2011-09-03T15:19Z,"In MapSource you need to crop (""map tool"") the map you want and send it to the nuvi (""send to device"").
Junction view and 3D Buildings files works only on models that support these functions.
Check the specs of your Nuvi."
,revvv01,2011-09-07T09:22Z,"the problem is I cant import the maps on mapsource. http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/43/mapsource.jpg/
It say the map is unlockable. "
,Ipmark,2011-09-07T10:13Z,"In Mapsource, click on View > Switch to product > City Navigator Australia & New Zealand NT 2012.20"

,Dewy1098,2011-09-26T00:04Z,"Some help please:
I am using Windows 7 but can't find a folder in the C drive named ProgramData. 
I do have a folder called Program Files, is this the same area to put the GARMIN folder into?"
,Dewy1098,2011-09-26T00:20Z,"Some help please:
I am using Windows 7, but I can't find a folder on the C drive called ProgramData, when I try to create a folder the system tells me that there is already a folder by that name but I cannot see it. What version of Mapsource are you using also?
Thanks in advance."
,Ipmark,2011-09-26T01:11Z,"ProgramData is an hidden folder.

,shrink3677,2011-11-02T04:43Z,Nuvigar read what Ipmark has written earlier about using mapsource - should make it clear for you
,hobbyfarmer,2011-12-13T06:45Z,"Hmm never easy.
Downloaded no probs.
Loading up on mapsource problem.
The file downloads in a zip RAR extension.
This needs to be unzip?
Once unzip it creates folders and many files.
Do all folders and files go into the map directory?
Mapsource does not recognise the file type?
Any assistance appreciated.
Thanks"
,SerLeo,2012-01-30T12:58Z,"What have to do with files D3299010A.JCV, gmap3d.img? Last is for device? "
,knibblerdax,2012-02-26T07:49Z,"Works great, thanks! 
Only thing is that if you check for map updates on Garmin website and go to 'Device Content' it says its the ""City Navigator Australia & New Zealand NT 2011.10, Deluxe JV, All Regions, April 10"" ""Download expires Jul 11, 2011.""
So NOT the 2012.20. 
Still a great update though!"
,wakkaflakka,2012-04-09T00:20Z,"Can someone PLEASE help me out? I have BaseCamp on my Mac and I don't know how to get these map updates onto BaseCamp and then onto my actual GPS (Garmin nuvi 265W). 
BaseCamp won't let me import these files onto it. Someone PLEASE help!?"
