 Friends and colleagues share their memories of the much-loved comedian,       
 revealing his private life was often as chaotic as his stage act - but far    
 less amusing. Cooper carved a career out of appearing to be an incompetent    
 magician and endeared himself to millions, but the darker side of his         
 personality led him into alcohol addiction. Narrated by Daniel Abineri.
       
                                 Enjoy!
