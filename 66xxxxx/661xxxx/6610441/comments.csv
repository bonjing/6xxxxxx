In VLC (1.1.4) at various times the video becomes completely pixelated (e.g. at 24:48). In Totem (2.32) this does not happen but there is almost all the time a green line visible on the top of the video. 

Overall quality of the audio/video is good, though it does come at a price (1.2GB for 1:39)."
