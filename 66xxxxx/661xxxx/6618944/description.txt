Here is a studio mix I made. I put a lot of love and frustration into this mix. I wanted to do more then just bang together tracks that are hot in the streets. 15 locals are already doing that, so I tried to tell a story and give out some blueprints for those who choose to listen. Itâ€™s a dirty mix, so be prepared to be offended and confused. Next mix will be weirder and more on the downtempo side.  Iâ€™ve been having problems with tracks and uploading this, so bear with me. Here's a taste of what to expect.
