Audio was all right, but you can heat the clicking of the projector. Wasn't annoying, just sounded like crickets softly in the back ground.
The video was what is expected of a theater screen copy.
Good movies though. First half seemed like the same old Final Destination movies. Then they added a twist, a reasonable twist to the old story.
Worth the watch, and a definite keeper for FD fans."

,jheypogi,2011-08-18T17:46Z,"THE ENDING-

Two weeks later, they got on an airplane but that airplane was gonnaďťż crash and that airplane was FLIGHT 180 so this happened in 2000 and it all goes back to the start. EPIC!"
