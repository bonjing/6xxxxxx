,LukeScooto,2011-09-06T04:23Z,"You two are SUPER NEWBS, big time. Go learn about keygens and cracks before you say theres a virus in these. You should hear how stupid you sound when you say it.  Read and teach yourself how your antivirus program thinks the exe is a virus, but its not, its the keygen/crack that makes the pirated software work. Fools, no offense."
