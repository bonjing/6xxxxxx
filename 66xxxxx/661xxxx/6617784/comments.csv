Your character will have a permanent pirate hat."
[V],tinyz,2011-08-21T12:19Z,No Time To Pirate!
,uberknight72,2011-08-23T03:18Z,"The pirated version of the game a buggy as hell, and everyone is pirate themed, which I have a feeling is intended.  Its not the uploaders fault, its the developers, very smart developers.  The game itself is a really fun and entertaining game, just do the developers a favor and buy it simply because they took the time to make the real version un-piratable.  I give them props and worthy of me buying their game just for that.  buying it right now. :)"
,Alenthas,2011-09-03T02:06Z,"I wish I could buy this but I dont have a credit card. If they do ""call to buy"" service I would buy it."
,c46,2011-09-03T07:47Z,It's pretty clear that this was uploaded by the devs.
,MonchoXX,2011-09-03T14:42Z,"Developer: tinyBuild
Uploader: tinyz (first upload)
Game: buggy and pirate hat on character

Developers uploading fuck*d up games FTW"
,tjexp,2011-09-04T02:16Z,i'll be buying this game :)
[V],tinyz,2011-09-04T09:03Z,Why on earth would a developer mess with the pirates?!
,luis1994,2011-09-08T15:44Z,"YES, PLZ!!! I WAN'T TO PLAY THIS GAME!!!"
,luis1994,2011-09-08T15:45Z,Download this game!! But it doesn't make sense at all! You've been warned!
[V],tinyz,2011-09-09T12:22Z,"Seriously, there's a guy complaining about the bugs in this version :D

,zarathustra2k1,2011-09-11T06:59Z,"http://torrentfreak.com/indie-game-devs-post-pirated-game-on-the-pirate-bay-110909/

Released by the game devs themselves! Good on 'em - I hope it _increases_ sales in the long run.

,dioxholster,2011-09-11T15:35Z,awkward! 
,Stendoras,2011-09-12T00:41Z,I ain't gonna download dis Sh*t! fuck you tinyz
,sshalafi,2011-09-13T12:53Z,"As far as I know, this build is probably worse than the original, since it's uploaded by the developers themselves, and you don't have an option to turn it into a 1:1 copy of the retail version.

So, good try tinyz, but we like to get what money would get us, not what the devs want us to get for free.

Just wait for the retail version to get uploaded."
,anonhito,2011-09-14T16:21Z,Does this version work in Linux?
,Bahash99,2011-09-15T05:54Z,"If this is buggy it isn't because the developers uploaded a buggy version its because they made a buggy game.
Anyway, even free I am not interested enough to download and try the game. It is a very interesting marketing ploy by the developer though. A couple small developers have gone on record stating piracy improved sales of their games."

,Sonrah,2011-09-20T08:00Z,"Are you guys seriously complaining because an indie dev is kind enough to offer his game (buggy or not)? Oh my... 

Anyway, thank you very much, as usual, I will try the game and may buy or not depending on my liking of it.

cheers!"
,Anonchan,2011-10-27T11:24Z,TotalBiscuit Mailbox 26/10/11 brought me here - made an account just to say whichever one of you came up with the idea of releasing a crippleware version (with pirate hats no less!) in 2011 deserves a high five and a beer.
