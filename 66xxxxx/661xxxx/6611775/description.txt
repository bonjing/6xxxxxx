Just a note - Track 14 from the album Anything Goes has a minute of some skipping. The disc was quite scuffed and I almost didn't put it in this torrent but since its difficult to find any C+C Music Factory in FLAC I decided to leave it in the torrent. If anyone has this album and can do a error free rip please do make available! Also any other C+C. Thanks!

From Wiki:


C+C Music Factory is a dance-pop and hip hop group formed in 1989 and broke in 1996 of David Cole's death. They reformed in 2001 to resume making music for Cole and making him proud that they were able to resume their career. In 2011, C & C Music Factory has reformed with legendary producer Eric Kupper stepping in to replace Cole. Their first release, "Rain" featuring Scarlett Santana will be released in August of 2011.

C+C Music Factory earned a total of 35 music industry awards worldwide, including five Billboard Awards, five American Music Awards, and two MTV Video Music Awards. After Cole died in January 1995, his production partner ClivillÃ©s continued to use the C+C name alone.

Gonna Make You Sweat 1990 (12" Maxi)


"Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)" was C+C Music Factory's first hit. It was released in late 1990 in many countries and achieved a great success in U.S., Austria, Germany and Switzerland where it reached number one on the charts.

The rap was performed by Freedom Williams and the vocal "Everybody Dance Now" by disco/house music artist Martha Wash.

The official music video features Zelma Davis lip-synching to the actual Martha Wash vocal parts.

Wash, perturbed by the fact that her image had been labeled "unmarketable" due to her girth, successfully sued to receive proper credit (and royalties). Wash's courtroom efforts spurred legislation making vocal credits mandatory on CDs and music videos.

It ranked #36 on "VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 90s".

1.	"Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)" (the slammin' vocal club mix) â€“ 6:50
