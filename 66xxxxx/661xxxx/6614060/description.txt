About the Game
The InterCity-Express, or ICE, was introduced by Deutsche Bahn in 1991 to run high-speed passenger services across a broad network linking such German cities as Frankfurt, Mannheim, Hamburg and Dusseldorf. With a top speed of 186mph (300kph), the ICE was a huge leap forward for passengers with journey times being reduced significantly. With 14 cars per set, these 410-metre long trains have been produced in 5 different versions since their introduction, with the later ICE â€“T and ICE-TD featuring tilting technology for faster cornering. However, the original ICE-1 sets have now been refurbished to include more refined interior fittings and electric power sockets for the passengers. All are air-conditioned and include special on-board boosters to improve mobile/cell phone reception while traveling.

The ICE for RailWorks 2, developed by German Railroads, recreates the original ICE-1 series of trains introduced in 1991 and includes accurate controls (including automatic drive and brake system), passenger view, moveable cab blinds and 5 scenarios including a tutorial.
