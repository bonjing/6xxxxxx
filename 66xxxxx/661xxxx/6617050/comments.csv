,noobsybot,2011-08-27T06:17Z,"eztv you are fucking awesome! Thank you for the up...I now wish I hadn't watched it. I know in real life Capt Jack loves the cock & if that's his thing more power to him! I, however am a smooth pimp daddy who LOVES the pussy, but is losing interest fast in Queer as Folk meets Torchwood!!! Sorry but if I was into gay porn I'd be downloading it! I do not think Torchwood will last much longer...I'm American and I fucking HATE the way they are fucking up this show! I liked the original MUCH better this drawn out shit blows! I mean pick up the pace already time for a new plot! Hope they don't intend to keep this shit up! Grrr Take the show back to Cardiff for fuck sake!!! 
Thanks for letting me rant! Peace out homeboy!"

Torchwood's only gotten better from what I've seen. The first two series were all right, but I find I hadn't had the interest to watch them as often as Children Of Earth, which threw more fear into me than any slasher movie.

Miracle Day is turning out to be disgusting: letting a convicted pedophilic murderer live, destroying a doctor who's trying to help humanity.. I mean, if Davies is holding back, I'd love to see him write a horror flick. Damn.

I watch this on my computer, so I let the sex scenes, gay or otherwise, play out while messing around with stuff in another window. I'm not offended by gay sex - I just don't bother with porn.

Never been into spectator sports, honestly."
