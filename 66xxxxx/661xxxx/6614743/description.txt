"A man whose guitar playing leaves you gasping, whose voice can turn from a gentle whisper to window-rattling bellow, whose songwriting ability seems boundless and whose interpretations of other peopleâ€™s material always brings an individual twist, Roy is deservedly gaining greater recognition with appearances at Festivals throughout the UK and gigs in Europe." ~Digital Blues

For the record (no pun intended) Royâ€™s first recorded output was in 1980 with the NWoBHM band Warrior. This was a 10 inch vinyl single that seemed a good idea at the time but wouldnâ€™t fit into any jukeboxes so had a limited appeal. He stems from what became known as the Thames Delta blues scene during the Seventies. Scores of fine blues outfits spilled out from the area at that time â€“ Mickey Juppâ€™s Legend, Dr Feelgood, The Kursaal Flyers, Eddie and the Hot Rods etc. So now Roy plays mainly solo in clubs and around the festival circuit across the UK. Like others before him heâ€™s stretching out and probing into areas where blues and British folk tradition meet, increasingly playing established, highly rated acoustic gigs and festivals in an attempt to prove his worth in a genre where songs demand a meaningful lyric.
