Edit function doesn't work......"
,TERRAOperative,2011-08-17T13:53Z,"Oh, just a small note:
The censored contents of the box early into episode 1 are *not* what you think... :)

According to Mat Currie from Madman, here is the real explanation:

""Madman didnâ€™t blur/pixel out the contents of the box in episode 1. It was done originally on the Japanese version. The contents of the box is meant to be a secret alien device that humans are not supposed to see! So they (as a joke) pixelated it out as humans would be watching it. I still reckon itâ€™s a box of sex toys Ms Kazami owns, but the Aussie censors had nothing to do with it.""


Sorry, but she's most probably not as kinky as you think. (but we can dream.... ;) )"
