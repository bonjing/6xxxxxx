Intructor's solution manual for "Mechanics of Materials, 7th Edition" by J. M. Gere and B. J. Goodno (c2009). A single small bookmarked PDF file (25 MB) with table of contents. 7-Zip archive (lossless compression reducing data transfer by ~40%).

Comment: If you won't mind a little digital haze around some images (non native PDF & scans; text not affected), this file is ~4 times smaller than the one already available.

Once your download has finished, _please_ seed this torrent as often and for as long as you possibly can.
