Excellent film adaptation of William Shakespeare's immortal work, staged by Franco Zeffirelli, has entered a golden collection of world cinema through careful attitude to the material Scriptwriters plays and stellar duo of Elizabeth Taylor (Katharina) and Richard Burton (Petruchio), a game which has become the embodiment of poetry and humor of the great writer on the movie screen. In the Soviet box office film was stunning and for many years did not go to the cinema. "The Taming of the Shrew" offers an interesting situation for Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor daunting. Writers have done a neat job, including their dialogue without much damage to the memory of the great Bard. Two stars have done a lot of noise, playing their roles with raw meat and genuine fun. Burton plays, as they say, more than life, with lots of jokes, where it is allowed by the script. Taylor is prone to excessive "landing" of the role early in the film, and then switches to a more reserved attitude, but rather tartly. But whatever it was, see how it tame - a real pleasure. Comedy is supported by a witty wedding ceremony.
