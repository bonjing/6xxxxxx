This the FULL SET from Glastonbury 2011 - a show the band described as their best over gig. The full set has not been broadcast complete, this is edited together (almost) seamlessly from two different broadcasts.


Setlist:
	1.	The Birds *â€¨
	2.	The Bones of You â€¨
	3.	Mirrorball â€¨
	4.	Neat Little Rows â€¨
	5.	Grounds for Divorce â€¨
	6.	The Loneliness of a Tower Crane Driver â€¨
	7.	Lippy Kids *â€¨
	8.	Weather to Fly * â€¨
	9.	Open Arms *â€¨
	10.	One Day Like This *


Songs marked * are from the BBC Four recording, with slight artefacts on the picture, due to a bad DVD recording. Audio is unaffected.

The other songs are from the BBC Three live broadcast and so contain the between-song banter!
