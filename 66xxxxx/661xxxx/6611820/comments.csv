Terraria.v1.0.6.1.cracked-THETA [ALEX].rar you just extract to get the game folder. This is the THETA release but is just pre installed and then put into a rar. This was to show that THETA releases are clean, the installer's just show up as false positives.

t-terra8.rar is the original release that has the installer which some people think is a virus but isnt.

Both copies work, just wanted to give an option to those who think THETA release arent clean or have problems with their antivirus."
[T],alexisthebest,2011-08-17T23:37Z,"Also forgot to show the VirusTotal reports

This is the game with the THETA installer

This is the game once i used the installer and just put the game folder into a rar

Again, the installer is what shows up as a virus but the release is perfectly clean."
,DreamPhreak,2011-08-18T00:49Z,"People's AV software keeps going haywire because the people are probably using crappy software. 

They should probably get one of the best softwares, according to many comparison websites. The best is Avira, F-Secure, and Avast. http://www.av-comparatives.org/en/comparativesreviews/summary-reports

F AVG :)"

Report from anubis, especially for guys with paranoid AV. As you can see, the only suspicious in this file is that it is detected by AV - not any forbidden activity, not network using, not hidden windows, nothing in autorun, no parts of program left after exit. And also, it's Theta - they have good reputation and are not going to accidentally lose it by putting malware into releases."
,GKill,2011-08-27T04:43Z,"I havnt torrented anything in a long time, do i need steam to run this game?"

,AdamB1924,2011-09-16T17:32Z,"Are you that dumb? Look at what he wrote.. Scanners and firewalls will block the install exe, but it's a false positive. Do you really think Alex would get a Trusted skull for uploading vira? Pull yourself together man. Geesus!"
,Saru,2011-09-17T02:59Z,"Can anyone help me? It says ""Former volume not mounted."""
,Saru,2011-09-17T03:15Z,"Ok well I got it to download, But when i try to open terraria it says ""The application failed to initalize properly"""
,Dirtsk8r,2011-09-17T05:49Z,"Trojan.ADH. Dont download this, I trusted that it was false like people were saying but a few days after and my computer was totally screwed up and was freezing so I reformatted my computer still trusting this thinking something went wrong with my computer and it was its fault so I downloaded it again and once more it kept asking to delete the trojans but I ignored them and once again I had to reformat m computer. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!"

,MatressGiant,2011-10-21T01:21Z,"Broken. Tried both ways with AV disabled whole time. Got ""this program encountered an error and needs to close"" on both. Using Windows 7 64-Bit."
,MatressGiant,2011-10-21T01:25Z,"Downloading this fixed it for me:
Microsoft XNA Framework Redistributable 4

,T3MUL3NT,2011-10-22T13:18Z,"First, for anyone with issues with the game crashing. You need to have Microsoft .Net Framework 4.0 as well as Microsoft XNA Framework 4.0. Hope this helps. 

Second, the AV complaints are getting a little old. This is TPB, alex is a trusted uploader, and alex also pointed out that AV's will read this as a false positive. If you don't know what any of that means, I think you may be in the wrong corner of the internet."
