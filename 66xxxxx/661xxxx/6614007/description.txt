John Wayne Cleaver is dangerous, and he knows it.

Heâ€™s spent his life doing his best not to live up to his potential.

Heâ€™s obsessed with serial killers, but really doesnâ€™t want to become one. So for his own sake, and the safety of those around him, he lives by rigid rules heâ€™s written for himself, practicing normal life as if it were a private religion that could save him from damnation.

Dead bodies are normal to John. He likes them, actually. They donâ€™t demand or expect the empathy heâ€™s unable to offer. Perhaps thatâ€™s what gives him the objectivity to recognize that thereâ€™s something different about the body the police have just found behind the Wash-n-Dry Laundromat---and to appreciate what that difference means.

Now, for the first time, John has to confront a danger outside himself, a threat he canâ€™t control, a menace to everything and everyone he would love, if only he could.

Dan Wellsâ€™s debut novel is the first volume of a trilogy that will keep you awake and then haunt your dreams.
