Plot: Four war-veterans, from different sides, step onto a boat at the mouth of the Kwando river, deep within the African interior. They are on a journey back to the battlefield, the site of the last â€œgreatâ€ battle of the Cold War â€“ its inconclusive and a very secret Armageddon, where they as youngsters, once tried to kill each other. But now, twenty years later, theyâ€™ve come together as former enemies, a new unit of disparate souls joined together not only by the common haunting of war trauma, but also by their need to understand, to reconcile, to forgive.
