,Kazae_The_Wolf,2011-08-20T22:13Z,Ok....this is my second torrent upload but it may as well be my first. NOTE: I AM seeding. Created and uploaded torrent file from bitlord 1.1 but it's still not showing any seeders here even though it should say it has at least one. Working on it now. (First time uploading I had the same problem and never figured it out...so any helpful suggestions would be appreciated.)
[V],DownTYU,2011-08-21T05:30Z,Download utorrent (and stop using shitty torrent clients)...Put the file to your download folder...Start the torrent in utorrent...Point it to the file and then seeding will start after a checking. 
,Obama_bin_Laden,2011-08-22T03:55Z,Um....dude?
,Kazae_The_Wolf,2011-08-22T05:54Z,@DownTYU Thx for the info....I'm getting on it now. My connection is a bit slow and inconsistant since I can only use sat uplink here in the boonies. Sry it took me so long to respond though...had a family emergency. Working on the torrent now.
,Kazae_The_Wolf,2011-08-22T06:27Z,"hmmmm...just got uTorrent....shows that I'm seeding and it seems ppl are dling and yet tpb isn't picking up that I'm seeding :/ 

....Well now....this is a rather curious predicament I've got here.....hmmmm >.>"
,Kazae_The_Wolf,2011-08-22T07:38Z,"and so it finally shows seeders....YaY!!!
\,,/_ (>."
,Kazae_The_Wolf,2011-08-22T16:36Z,"sry for the 2-hour delay...got back to find no connection on my modem....had to reset it :(

Anyway, it should be back up and seeding...although rather slowly :/

Plz try to be patient with my connection. (I need to move to somewhere that has DSL access or something -.-)"
,Kazae_The_Wolf,2011-08-23T02:39Z,"once someone has the complete file and is seeding at a reasonable rate, please let me know. (My sat uplink consists of my Droid X tethered using free tethering hack...3g sux for this kinda stuff, really)"
,Kazae_The_Wolf,2011-08-24T16:01Z,well hell....just recieved the gingerbread 4.5.588 ota release from verizon and it keep seems it will kill my root access and my tethering if I allow it to install. Excuse me for a couple of hours while I fix this and then I will be back to seeding as best as I can.
,Kazae_The_Wolf,2011-08-24T20:49Z,now that that's done with and I've once more gotten it rooted.....back to seeding :)
,marrynik30,2011-08-25T00:36Z,Seed please
,Kazae_The_Wolf,2011-08-25T08:16Z,seeding....damn this slow ass 3g...damn verizon -.-
,Kazae_The_Wolf,2011-08-27T04:15Z,I think I'm gonna switch to sprint and get a evo 4g....mmmm....4g =F
,Kazae_The_Wolf,2011-08-28T17:47Z,please post your phone model and confirm working (or not and I'll try to fix the problem) in the comments. Thank you.
,ten20life,2011-08-30T19:21Z,"Installed Spider Man and Modern Combat... Both start to load, then I receive error message saying ""Not Original Game"".  Im using an unrooted Droid Incredible."
,ryanhirsch,2011-08-31T16:32Z,"Using an unrooted Sony Ericsson Xperia Play and none of these files work. All either require additional downloads which crash while dl'ing, or they say they aren't the orginal. The same thing as ten20life :("
,Kazae_The_Wolf,2011-09-01T19:48Z,"@ten20life

Did you find the modern combat and spiderman folders and transfer them to your gameloft/games folder?

@ryanhirsch
They should work. the only way that I can think of that they wouldn't is if the device wasn't HD compatible.

@everyone Please be sure to list your android OS version along with any problems or ""working"" confirmations and any hacks/mods specific to your OS (root and roms). This will help me to determine the issue and thus try to resolve it.

As far as it stating that it isn't the orriginal file, all files are orriginal files downloaded directly from gameloft. I know because I paid for them.

TO ALL CRACKERS/MODDERS FOR GAMELOFT HD GAMES FOR ANDROID: If you feel that you can use/crack these files/apk's.....please do so and notify me in my comments here. I will collaborate by supplying more apps/games to do so with."
,Kazae_The_Wolf,2011-09-01T19:53Z,P.S. I will modify the torrent with updated files as soon as I can. I will have to find a free hotspot to update the game files so that I can do so since my home net connection is run directly from my droid x. There aren't any hotspots that are very close to me so it may take a little time.
,ten20life,2011-09-02T07:04Z,"I installed all the folders exactly the way they were packaged.  I downloaded Gameloft's Asphalt 5 from a different torrent and it installed perfectly.  Even downloaded the additional 100mb, no hiccups... No idea what's going on....  Would love to get these working... Waiting for some other's input's."
,Kazae_The_Wolf,2011-09-06T03:14Z,"Seems these will only work on the Droid x...maybe the rest of the Droid series phones too. If anyone gets them working on something else, please list the model of the phone and OS version. I recently got access to the EVO 3D and it wouldn't work on it either. Again I give a call to any Android game crackers to crack these games so that they will work with other phones. As of now the EVO 3D and the Droid X are the only 2 phones I have access to. Thank you to anyone who can/will do this."
,Jammi2076,2011-09-14T10:13Z,List of The Games please?

,srinumad,2011-11-29T17:07Z,thanks man
,blackfirebr,2012-01-30T04:01Z,"The games worked just fine here (Galaxy S I9000B). It's amazing, is the first collection of HD games that I download that actually works without having to download.

I only recommend the creator of the torrent  to explain better how to install the games. I ended up discovering by myself, but I bet many people don't. So, here a quick tip for those who are having the message to ""Download Aditional Content"":

1st: Use the program called ""GLZip"" that is located at the folder ""gameloft game soul"" to unzip the "".zip"" files like Asphalt6 and FastFive.

2nd: Copy the .apk file of the game to your phone and let the game start the download, and then stop.

3rd: Connect your phone to your PC again and now copy the extracted files to the folder ""gameloft/games/(nameofthegame)"" note that must be some overwrites over there.

The other tipe of files ""not .zip"", you just unrar them to the correct folder, this could be 3 different folders:

F:\data\data\
F:\Android\data
F:\gameloft\games

If you installed any game and the game tells you have to download it again, you must have copied the files to the wrong folder, try another one (os the 3 above).

Hope it helps someone and I hope you understand what I'm saying xD

See ya!"
,JinPT,2012-01-31T15:05Z,"Will this finally work on devices not officially supported? My gameloft games are refusing to download, they won't let me decide if I want to test the game on my device for myself, ridiculous. Image PC gaming was imposing restrictions like that: ""Oh, I see you have that 3 year old ATI card we didn't remember to test with our game, YOU CAN'T TRY IT, UNINSTALL"""
,damienrayne,2012-02-04T00:44Z,why i cannot unzip the file? it seems like broken.
,damienrayne,2012-02-05T10:54Z,wow! this really work! thanks Kazae. Thanks all
,rohit9d,2012-04-06T06:52Z,after installing .when i run the game it asks for internet connection to register your copy of moder combat 2 hd and similarly for other games.please help
,tunatuna,2012-05-08T20:19Z,I have an HTC flyer running gingerbread and none of these work. First if I try to run the apk from the sd card it gets prompted to download the whole game via wife. What's the point of having the files already copied on your sd card if the apk won't use those files? Then I tried the workaround suggested by blackfirebr and also no success. The video pre-game runs but then crashes back to the os. Can't believe how lame this is.  Maybe someone should modify the apk so it searches the sd card for install not the wifi download method. ANyone with a HTC Flyer get this to work?
