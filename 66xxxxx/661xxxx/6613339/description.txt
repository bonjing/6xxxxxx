Sexual Abuse in Christian Homes and Churches - Collection 7:

We have 22 titles in this upload. An important book in this collection is the one titled: "Sex, Priests, and Secret Codes; the Catholics Church's 2000-year Paper Trail of Sexual Abuse", by: Doyle, Sipe and Wall. 
In this book the authors expose a documented history of sexual abuse of minors and adults by Catholic clergy that continued without interruption from the post-Apostolic era to the present. Most of the evidence is in the form of the church's own legal documents and authoritative pronouncements that reveal consistent pattern of non-celibate behavior by significant numbers of priests.

The collection also includes several official reports about sexual abuse in the US Armed Forces, US Air Force Academy, and within the Federal Law Enforcement Agencies.
