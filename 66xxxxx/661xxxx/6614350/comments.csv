,steelllynx,2011-10-10T04:03Z,"USA, I love it and hate it.  Love the torrents, especially.  If this game is half as good as the trailers make it look, you can count on at least a 10:1 ratio from my seed.

What's with the abgx, I've never needed to use it.  I got a 360 with a bad laser and all I had to do was clean the lens with a Q-Tip and 91% isopropyl alcohol and flashed LT+ 1.61 (if i recall correctly) and burned about 25 games so far.  The only one that didn't work that should have was Castlevania...

The PAL version didn't work either but it wasn't region free and that is to be expected.

I'll comment when I burn it."
,steelllynx,2011-10-10T04:10Z,"Now that I think about it more, my LT+ might be version 1.1"
,steelllynx,2011-10-12T01:45Z,"Works great.  I'm using some firmware, I think LT+ 1.6 or 1.61, definitely older than 1.91.  I just downloaded, burned, and played.  Memorex burned at 6x OK (8x failed write at about 40% through when I tried it.)  I will be seeding for a while."
