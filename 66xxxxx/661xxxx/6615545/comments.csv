[V],DibyaTPB,2011-08-20T19:31Z,"Lol, The Providers sucks most of the times. You need to pay huge for a good and descent connection, a better idea, put it on your client, shut down the speakers and monitor, let your pc sleep for a few days :P"

,sarathkmr,2011-08-21T10:17Z,Nice Man! I Wrote the comment about speed and there came the response. Downloaded very quickly +1.
,zamzaa,2011-08-21T13:17Z,"Slow download, but when im done ill be seeding."
,VicVega,2011-08-21T20:05Z,"@Anoopy Because the movie is presented in a 2.35:1 (Panavision) aspect ratio. 544 plus the black bars on top and bottom, equals 720. There's no need for the encoder to put the black bars into the file, since the player adds them automatically upon playback."
,Nilias2,2011-08-22T11:49Z,Don`t download this! Very bad seed!!!

,daynight7,2011-09-13T14:48Z,if you have 16:9 monitor and want to fit the screen use VLC and set Aspect Ratio to 16:9.  
,amartya61,2011-09-21T17:47Z,ThnXXx ..awesome upload.. movie is great indeed
,shipz2640,2011-10-05T05:06Z,"I was hoping this would be 1080p since it's a Blu-Ray rip, but I'll settle for 720p.

One thing I don't understand is why they put letterboxes at the top and bottom of the movie. I could see this 10 years ago when we didn't have widescreen televisions, but now it makes the movie look ridiculous with these boxes on a widescreen device.

Anywho, thanks for the upload."
,Painweaver,2011-10-14T18:12Z,I want to let the copyright holders for this movie to know a homeless man just illegally obtained a copy of this movie out of my garbage without yours or my consent. We should both get about 1/2 a million $ due to the damages he has done to the movie industry and to my reputation for allow this to happen on my property.
