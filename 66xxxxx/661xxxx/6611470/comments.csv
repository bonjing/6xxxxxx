,josh0223,2011-10-18T02:27Z,"I was looking for a doc that I saw a while back about psychotropic drugs. I couldn't remember if it was Making a Killing or Marketing of Madness. So thanks, Paul, for the upload. It has made my search much easier. Both are on Youtube so I assume this torrent is legal (I like that. It makes me feel safe :)
DL speed sucks, so I'll seed as much as I can"
