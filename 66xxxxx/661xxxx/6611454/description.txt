[PS3] 3.70 Downgrade for Fat-Slim NOR Models Teensy++ or ProgSkeet

Dospiedras has released the tutorial a lot of us have been waiting for, 3.70 Downgrade
for Fat/Slim NOR PS3 consoles, meaning this tutorial is for all those out there with later
models that use 16mb NOR Flash. This tutorial can be followed with either the Teensy++, or
the ProgSkeet.

Use extreme caution when attempting this and be prepared to solder your console. Also,
make sure you know for certain, that your model did not come with 3.56+ firmware stock.
