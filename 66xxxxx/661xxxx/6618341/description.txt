Incorporating a number of the authorâ€™s recent ideas and examples, Dynamic Programming: Foundations and Principles, Second Edition presents a comprehensive and rigorous treatment of dynamic programming. The author emphasizes the crucial role that modeling plays in understanding this area. He also shows how Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is an excellent example of a dynamic programming algorithm, despite the impression given by the computer science literature.

New to the Second Edition

    * Expanded discussions of sequential decision models and the role of the state variable in modeling
    * A new chapter on forward dynamic programming models
    * A new chapter on the Push method that gives a dynamic programming perspective on Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for the shortest path problem
    * A new appendix on the Corridor method

Taking into account recent developments in dynamic programming, this edition continues to provide a systematic, formal outline of Bellmanâ€™s approach to dynamic programming. It looks at dynamic programming as a problem-solving methodology, identifying its constituent components and explaining its theoretical basis for tackling problems.
