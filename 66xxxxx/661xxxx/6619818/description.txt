Containing numerous contemporary images by leading photographers, this indispensable manual concerning wedding portraits explains posing fundamentals as well as how to create a flattering, feature-specific photographâ€”one that focuses on the head, shoulders, arms, legs, or torsoâ€”in different levels of close-ups, from head-shots to full-lengths. Since posing is the second most challenging aspect of photography and with the added complications of a weddingâ€”from the bride's personal style to her figure and gownâ€”it can be very easy for a photographer to make a wrong turn. This perceptive reference provides the perfect place to turn when in need of quick posing strategies and fresh ideas.
