One of the most successful musicians and flamboyant showmen of all time, Elton John has
won a multitude of awards from Brits, Grammys, Golden Globes to Oscars. For this special
event two pianos took centre stage. One for Elton, and the other, for an artist who inspired
Elton as a young musician; singer songwriter Leon Russell.

Leon has written classic songs such as This Masquerade and Delta Lady, as well as working
with legends of popular music like The Beach Boys, Marvin Gaye, Frank Sinatra and The
Rolling Stones. Russell and Elton first worked together and toured the US in the early 1970s,
but lost touch for many years. Then last November Elton, Leon, Bernie Taupin and producer
T Bone Burnett started collaborating in an L.A. studio on a new album, The Union. Making the
new record, Elton told Mojo magazine in August, "made me fall in love with a guy I fell in love
with years ago,all over again".

As well as looking back at his roots, Elton's looked ahead by bringing on board two exciting
new names, Plan B and Rumer to perform alongside him. The show was broadcast live on
BBC Radio 2 at 20:00 and then shown on BBC Two on Saturday 30 October, together with
an exclusive documentary about his music and life.

An inspiring and emotional demonstration of poignant songwriting performed at its best.
