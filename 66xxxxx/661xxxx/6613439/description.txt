hi and welcom to version6.7 of my Win7PE_SE project,in a return to the more serious side of rata rescue,this live(preinstalled environment) boot disc is loaded with data rescue/file recovery/Master boot record fixes/and repair tools.its comparitivly small size allows for older computers that have limited ram and recources to run my  PE program,even on computers with only a cd drive,you can boot the system in to ram,then remove the disk to use the cd tray for transferring data,or loading more applications..iv retained the explorer shell,and it supports 16bit applications and programs,and has may apps and updatable antivirus too.burn it to cd as an image with imageburn,audio is not supported in this issue(saving space)neither will be some wireless devices,although there is a utility that autoruns and loads the hosts devices and drivers on startup.....this disc is pureley for rescue work,so space on the disc has been allocated for apps only..no frills,no bullshit,just good solid boot disk to fix pretty much any broken install or hdd crash...please browse my other torrents under redback38 here at the pirate bay for the many and varied flavours of different PE windows live disks.there are sizes and styles to suit almost any user that requires mobile,live,boot disk recovery suites and opperating systems.please seed and leave feedback/questions/complaints....this disc is dedicated to DarthBubba who requested that i build one of my creations that would run on creaky old boxes with very limited recources...and i also owe him a beer!:-)enjoy........ps no spyware or viruses....
