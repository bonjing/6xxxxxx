,wave_snow,2011-12-05T05:40Z,"to make a NY hip hop album w/ classic artists ""screwed"" is idiotic--this DL is a waste unless you like sippin sizurp like the south homies"
,OpuSMonk,2011-12-12T19:46Z,"Thanks for the Rip. As for ^ . Do you think maybe it is Screwed for a reason?. This is a torrent site right? Unscrew it, and if you don't know how to do that, go out and buy it homie. Or you can pay me a fraction of the cost and I will ""Un-screw it"" for you. Let me know."
