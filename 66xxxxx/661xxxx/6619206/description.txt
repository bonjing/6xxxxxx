Get Scared is a screamo/emo rock band from Layton, Utah, United States of America. They kinda sound like a harder version of Black Veil Brides, with more screaming mixed in than they have. 

Not much else here to say. I'm pretty sure everything in this is VBR, nothing study. 

Have fun with this. It's a pretty good torrent. I don't believe I included the covers with this, but you can easily get them from iTunes and Windows Media Player will download it automatically for you. 

If you don't trust this torrent, you're distrust is in the wrong place. I have a pink skull which means I am trusted for a reason.
