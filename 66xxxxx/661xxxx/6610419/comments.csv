,80sforeternity,2011-09-08T13:05Z,"Dear 80zforever, I use ThePirateBay for many years. The reason I registered yesterday is to come in contact with you mate. As you can see from my chosen name, I too love the 80s. I enjow (as a true hetero) extremely sensual spiritual rides into other dimensions as soon as I discovered your 53 volumes. I now know I am officialy am peeking into heaven. I would like to come in contact with you in order to:

- help you publish this stuff
- upload one gigantic 53 volume set perhaps better than each volume separate?
- why are many albums reuploaded? better sound quality?
- i am a true high fidelity audio freak my music setip cost xxxx$ so I was wondering mate, could you / we offer a 320 kbit version of all this creations?

I enjoyed listening to 80s music now more than 15 years. I was only used to the known stuff ( duran duran, aha, talk talk, and other well known new wave bands) 

Since I discovered your compilations I must say I truly  can hear these bands have spent much less effort in marketing themselves, and instead spent that time, love and dedication to make music, share their message, love and caring with the world. 

That to me is the job Angles have.

These are not bands, these are Angles you are hearing! Once you listen couple of sounds in any of your volumes, you can hear it. They don't play for money. 

This distinguishes the today's bands with the bands you have shared with us. I really wanna help in any way I can. I am by the way a young architect from The Netherlands. wish to hear from you about uploading one huge file and or uploading 320K versions MP3. Cheers mate!"
