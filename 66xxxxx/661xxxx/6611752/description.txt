Tom Green
Udderbelly's Pasture Edinburgh Festival
Monday 8th August 2011

Audience recording


This recording is not perfect, but very listenable if your a fan.

The venue was essentially a big tent with an upside down inflatable cow on top of it!
However, there was only a tarpaulin sheet separating the theatre from a huge busy bar area right next to it, so I had to substantially boost the volume so that you can hear Tom properly. This means the recording occasionally distorts when the audience claps or cheers loudly and you can hear the bar noise in the background. I also had a last minute microphone malfunction so had to resort to using the internal speakers of my gadget.

Overall though, the recording scrubs up not too badly, so if you can live with the faults, it's still well worth a listen.


Also includes a newspaper review and a ticket pic.
