i was wondering could you do an up to date collection of robert kirkman's invincible?
i'm struggling to find a massive chunk of the series.
thanks!"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-08T23:06Z,I have been scouring the nets and DC's page and I cannot find out definitively whether or not Zatanna will continue after the reboot or if this is the last issue - If so my hate for the DC relaunch will know no bounds >:(
