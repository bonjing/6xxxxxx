 At Inspirtech we understand that learning a new software package can be an        
 overwhelming task.  Often times, it is difficult to even know where to begin.     
 So, we have put together a structured course that guides users through the        
 learning process.  Inspirtech sets itself apart from the competition with a       
 unique and highly effective holistic approach to teaching.  Lessons are filled    
 with engaging examples and exercises that are just enough to inspire confidence,  
 yet not too much to confuse and frustrate the learner.  Upon completion of the    
 course, learners will be prepared to challenge the CSWA exam. Training features   
 SolidWorks intigration to give users access to all of the videos from the inside  
 of SolidWorks Software.
