,AardvarkFirefly,2011-10-10T03:33Z,"Thanks for the up!  I have a problem, though, that when I try and open up the lessons from within SW, it will not recognize the executable that I placed in the Video directory from the SolidSquad kit.  This is stated in an error message that has the direct path and executable name in it, so can't figure out how to make it work right.   Any suggestions?"
,Autarchus,2012-01-10T04:52Z,"These vids are excellent for learning the program. Don't be stupid like me, though - you need SW 2011 or later for this to be of use. The example files won't work if you have 2010 or before. "

Please explain!!"
,ranjiet,2012-01-29T03:49Z,"The video tutorials work great, but when I click on the review exercises, I get an error message ""The licence file cannot be opened"". Not a big deal, but if someone knows how to correct this problem, the help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"
