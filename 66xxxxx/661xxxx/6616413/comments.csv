,elturbo9077,2011-08-21T04:17Z,"@all

for all those people who have problems the crack does not need the ubisoft launcher to be installed if you think that the crack goes where the ubisoft launcher is installed u  totally fucking wrong the crack goes where the game is installed and when running a  splash screen log in appears then the game starts 

and the crack in this game does not work it makes the game crash  instead download the crack fix

,jthm420,2011-08-25T01:10Z,"@ all the idiots that say ubisoft drm can't be cracked, it's been cracked forever retards, any newer ubi games use it, follow the damn instructions and move the one file in the orbit folder to main install folder and it wrks perfectly fine, if you're having trouble, buy a decent computer :]

PS. THIS ^ is how a comment is supposed to be, especially if you're whining the game(or torrent) isn't working for some reason or another, ESPECIALLY if it's 'laggy' or 'slow' or w/e. (there's only one reason to not post your specs..think about it)
If it's really that much of a hassle, type your specs down in notepad or w/e text program you're using, and save it in your docs or somewhere easy to access, then copy and paste it. There is no excuse for laziness ;]"
,despun,2011-08-25T02:58Z,"Thank you extremezone. 
I don't understand how people have problems with this....
I open the file using winrar, extract the SKIDROW folder to a newly created folder. 
Then run the setup file using a temporary folder (winrar offers to create the temp folder). 
Wait for the game to start installing and when it has, copy the contents of the SKIDROW folder to the games installation folder.
When it asks to copy and replace I select yes.
Game loads and runs first time.

This is the same method I have used for every game from extremezone, it always works and never a problem. 

Again extremezone, thank you!"

,DeJohnnie,2011-08-25T16:19Z,"Hii =) I've had some issues starting this game and by trying a few things I got it to work.
[W7ultimate x64 | AMDx2 5600+ | Ati R HD 2600XT]
First of all > After a proper install the game wouldn't start @ all, just... nothing. I've seen a few with the same problem, so try this...
> After 'copying all files to'... open the orbit-folder and locate the ""ubiorbitapi_r2.dll"" and delete it...

The thing is, I accidently saw that the .dll is in the main folder and in the orbit folder... and thought, maybe the game will not respond bcos of the double .dll... deleted the 1 in the orbit folder and launched (AdminLaunch) and it worked! =)

Don't know why or w/e, but it worked for me and maybe for those with the same problem.

Now playing 1st level and my RT-button (Logitech ChillStream) isn't responding @ all =O wtH..?
I checked the Gamepad-Bindings-Thingy in W7 and all the buttons respond, aswell in-game...

Any1 with a clue, pls comment xD I cannot play without the RT!

And let us know if any solutions provided are helpfull in any way =D

Thnx"
,radioactivemart,2011-08-25T19:26Z,"i have found the solution for crash !!!!!!

From Dust was easier than this. But i suppose it did take Skidrow a whole year to finally crack the bitch."

,Starscream79,2011-08-29T15:41Z,"ok after trying everything said in previous posts i still got either blank error box or cant load ubi launcher. then i found a solution. 
1. uninstall previous ubisoft launcher(add/remove programs in the control panel)
2. click start-run type regedit. there search the word ubisoft and delete anything u find of ubisoft
3. install the game(dont crack it)
4. launch the game and let it update.
5. create a copy of the origional shaun white skateboarding.exe and put in somwhere u remember(backup folder)
6. download the Shaun.White.Skateboarding.Offline.Fix-SKIDROW listed in previous comments.
7. unpack it and copy the the content to the main game install folder of the game and overwrite.
8. copy everything the orbit folder in the crack u just downloaded into the ubisoft game launcer folder. (on xp its usually located in C:\Programfiles\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher)
9. copy the origional exe  file you created a backup of back to the game install folder.
10. play the game finally!"

i got error,,,:/"
,cracing,2011-09-27T05:56Z,"@Starscream79

Your solution works great. Confirmed!

Here is any easy guide to get it working:

1. Install the game.
2. DON""T CRACK THE GAME, that means no copying of skidrow cracked files to game installation folder.
3. Run the game and let it update everything. Allow it on firewall if necessary.
4. It will download about 70mb data.
5. When finished, you will get ubisoft login window. Just close it.
6. Go to C:\Program Files\Ubisoft and backup the folder called Ubisoft Game Launcher for future requirements.
7. Copy all the files and folders from orbit (in skidrow crack) to this Ubisoft Game Launcher and replace. (Not the backup'ed one)
8. Leave other cracked files (outside orbit). Don't copy those two files to game installation folder.
9. Also leave the backup of Ubisoft Game Launcher folder as is, as you may need in future.
10. Now run the game and you will successfully bypass the login window.

Enjoy it!"
