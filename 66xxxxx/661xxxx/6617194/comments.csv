,ocyrus70,2011-09-03T14:27Z,"shabcabc, do nothing but uninstall the software most internet security's have a max number of times you can install about 6 for symantec. try escan on here looks good to use and a really nice interface plus a full year's key without a hack. still think symantec and eset for what they do and not being to nonintrusive are well ahead of the game!!.."
