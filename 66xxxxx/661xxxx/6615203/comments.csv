,sdfef,2011-08-29T15:25Z,sorry for suggesting to copy and paste...i never thought it will come as a hyperlink...simply click it....
,sdfef,2011-08-29T15:28Z,"it is so strange that when i copy and paste d links in web browser,it opens the snapshot of d movie..but when i click the links it gets me nothing.....so its better to copy nd paste d links individually...."
