Allmusic Review:
10 Great Songs spotlights Duran Duran's '80s radio hits including "Rio," "Hungry Like the Wolf," "The Reflex," and "Girls on Film." While this budget set isn't bad for casual listeners, the better compilation pick is Greatest [Deluxe Edition], which digs deeper into the band's catalog and includes a DVD highlighting the videos of these tracks.
