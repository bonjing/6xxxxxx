,vernernet,2011-08-25T04:04Z,Sad to see the negitive remarks about the film itself.....I'm a real movie buff and I thought this was some of Will Ferrells best stuff. I highly recommend this movie.

,coomer1,2011-08-28T02:03Z,Cool Thanks just wondering if you could get Another Earth on here wanting to see that movie so bad!
,stevemonk,2011-08-29T12:54Z,"The short story it's based off of is by Raymond Carver, who does a lot of autobiographical stuff about isolation, drinking, and codependency.  I don't want to pigeonhole the film but if you're gonna like it more if you're an alcoholic :("

,jameskrueger3rd,2011-09-02T04:48Z,"Perfect AV. Thanks EZ

Movie is slow. It could be interesting to watch but absolutely NOTHING happens in the end. Wasted time IMO

,relpze,2011-09-02T17:11Z,"an alright movie, i really wish there wouldve been something at the end with that high school friend of his"
,r0bbinh00d,2011-09-05T04:24Z,"Excellent Audio / Video but the movie is absolute garbage.  Will Ferrell is expected to be funny.  This is totally opposite. But, every awesome actor/comedian should be given a mulligan. "
,Ville530,2011-09-16T23:36Z,"Great quality!! Could you please get ""Laugh at my Pain""?"
,lenindve,2011-09-20T04:27Z,Great Quality. Thanks for the upload!!!

,mask.of.sanity,2011-10-29T02:35Z,Torrents are great. This is all great. We're all great. You're mom's great.
,jlukens,2012-01-28T03:32Z,"Wow...so many negative comments here.  It was a fantastic movie!  I think that a lot of the kiddies who didn't like it can't relate because they haven't yet been kicked in the throat by life.  Then again, it's hard to get kicked in the throat when you're living in mommy's basement playing WoW and Internet-Tough-Guy each and every day."
