,Mythrrinthael,2011-08-18T13:40Z,"ATTENTION PIRATES:
If this game insta-crashes on startup, google xnafx31_redist.msi
and install it. YES, it is a Japanese Microsoft XNA Framework Redistributable 3.1. NO, I don't know why this works. It just did. You could have known this too, if you read through the comments on the original Bastion THETA torrent page"
