Please name properly. It's a required thing for uploading.

To downloaders (a tip):
Click the no. '51' beside 'Files' field. You'll have the complete file list."
,chromepony,2011-08-21T16:48Z,"F1, didn't you read my comment?  I said I screwed up in the title, it was a mistake.  Check my other posts by clicking on my name (Chromepony) and see that I know  how to post torrents.  Everyone is entitled to ONE mistake, I think!!!!"
[V],_F1_,2011-08-21T23:50Z,"Cool friend, I missed that comment. That was not shown to me when I was posting the comment (you know - typical TPB comment delay!!!). I'm sure you are a very good uploader. I have all good feelings for you.

OK, my mistake. Sorry. Happy now?"
[V],_F1_,2011-08-21T23:58Z,"Edit:
There was enough time gap, but I really didn't see it.

And Mr_Dawg, we are all friends here. And we share our mistakes between us. chromepony made a mistake on title, I made a mistake on commenting, chromepony again made a mistake by re-upping it leaving the previous post alive (thus splitting the life of the torrent into two).

Man makes mistakes and thats the fact. Sorry chromepony, once again."
