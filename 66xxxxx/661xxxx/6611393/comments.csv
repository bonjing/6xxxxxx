Ay, ye see at top left quarter of page, there are 'Type', 'Files' 'Size' and 'Info' beneath torrent title banner.

Well Info is the IMDB link ye have commented, that link is also in description.

Nice of ye and all that, but SAFCukO09 already provided that link in the appropriate place provided on the upload torrent page, so it is right there as 'Info' and capital letters saying IMDB.

Just thought i'd point that out, being as you've decided to post the link like it isn't already provided on page, twice, as maybe ye don't look and realise.

Some uploaders bother, some don't, if they do, why post the link again?

If ye see that 'Info' hyperlink to IMDB on the top left quarter of torrent pages, where an IMDB link is supposed to be, there's little point in posting it again.

Not that posting again does any harm, just pointing out it's already there on page, if ye look.

Peace. : )"
