NOTE: If your not an expert in Photoshop but want to get quick manipulations to individual photos, the this application is for you.  It provides hundreds of presets (and you can save your own), that allow you to manipulate an image in ways that would be hard to figure out in photoshop (or take a lot of steps to achieve) . Remember to save a preset if you like the effect because you can only work on one image at a time.

PhotoStyler is the easiest way to style your digital photos with your Mac. This simple, fast and accurate native solution combines the powers of Appleâ€™s core technologies with the flexibility and efficiency of proprietary application-specific modules. PhotoStyler supports all image formats that are supported by MacOS including RAW images, it uses your GPU to process the photos wherever possible, and it turns photo styling work into fun. Once youâ€™ve used PhotoStyler to style your first photo youâ€™ll appreciate the speed with which youâ€™re able to achieve results youâ€™ll love.
