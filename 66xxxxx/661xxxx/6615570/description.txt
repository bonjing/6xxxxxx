Lucid Puppy is our 'flavour' or edition of Puppy Linux that is built from Ubuntu binary packages, hence has compatibility with, and access to, the vast Ubuntu package repositories.
Coordinator 'playdayz' (Larry Short) has made this short announcement:

Lucid Puppy 5.2.8 is the fastest and friendliest Lucid yet. It is the fastest because it is the first Lucid to use the C and ffmpeg libraries optimized for i686 computers rather than the older i386 computers. Lucid 5.2.8 has also received a thorough going-over under the hood. There is new and updated firmware and drivers for many devices, courtesy of forum member tempestuous, and the hardware detection and configuration routines have been extensively tested and enhanced by forum member rerwin. The overall look and feel has been influenced by experiments forum member pemasu, to make the user interface fun for Linux newbies and experienced users alike.
