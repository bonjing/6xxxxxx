,OmniNegro,2011-08-21T17:22Z,"Look at the files. It seems self explanatory. It is something similar to a collectors edition.
(I am not downloading this personally. I do not know if they are good or fakes.)"
,elessarGObonzo,2011-08-21T18:00Z,"so, no extra game content, DLCs? even English?"
,mwalsher,2011-10-13T06:34Z,"It’s not self-explanatory at all. There is no official “Fantasy Edition”, so this is a fan-made compilation. Also, the file sizes are not consistent with other releases. Plus, the description is incomplete. Finally, the graphic is not in English, so it is not clear if the game is or not."
