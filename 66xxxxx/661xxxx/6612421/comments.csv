,grace1,2011-08-18T20:25Z,"i didn't instert the desk, but i did the disk"
,grace1,2011-08-18T20:27Z,"ok, just re-read your info.  i'm to dl RS first. i will try that. gracias"
,grace1,2011-08-18T21:00Z,"not working downloaded RS and it says ""the language CD was not found to install.  i have the disk i burned inserted. any suggestions?"
[T],FatFreddy76,2011-08-19T04:29Z,"@grace1, Burn each level to one disk. Then open Rosetta Stone and insert the disk shortly after. Click add language, and then install the disk. Sorry for any misunderstandings. I'm testing it now."
[T],FatFreddy76,2011-08-19T04:47Z,"I have just tested it, and It works. I burned the files onto a disk of appropriate size and opened Rosetta Stone. Then, I inserted the disk and waited a few seconds and waited to add language or you can click the second button at the top right and click Add or Remove Languages. Select add language, enter disk and click continue. Windows 7 x64 Tested."
,grace1,2011-08-19T05:18Z,"sorry still not working, let me go over the steps ive done. dl spanish(la), unzipped 1st level, saved it to a disk, ejected disk, opened RS that I dl from you, insterted disk, waited a few seconds, click ""add a lanugage level, it ask me to insert the lanugage disk into the cdrom drive (which i already did), click continue, it gives me the error message ""the lanugage cd was not found to install. please make sure your cd is in the drive"" then it ask me to try again, but get the same results everytime. any idea?  thanks"
[T],FatFreddy76,2011-08-19T06:14Z,"@grace1, You do not unzip the .iso, you insert a blank disk, then use any mounter/burner like PowerISO and burn it to a disk. PowerIso: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5842489
Hope this helps."

,Pasta1nc,2011-09-27T14:52Z,Thanks! Works perfectly! I used MagicISO and MagicDisc instead of burning it on to a CD. Follwed your directions and it works great. I'm a total noob at this (first time using a torrent) and I'm stoked to start using this program.
,swtsev,2011-10-02T07:31Z,Hello everyone this is my first download and i am totally confused. I downloaded the torrent and saved each file to a disk. I used power iso and now when i put the cd in it shows data document languages and speech. How do i add a language? it says go into rs and then insert language. I don't have a rs to go into without inserting a language. please help... I really want to learn how to access these lessons. thanks!!!!

,briaxlord,2011-12-10T17:42Z,"Ok, I mounted the image in Daemon tools and then it opened it like it was a folder? Where do i click open Rosetta Stone? I'm confused."
,TH3_R3AL_KR33PA,2011-12-30T04:37Z,"for those having problems you need Rosetta Stone first in which you can download here http://thepiratebay.ee/torrent/3852202/The_Rosetta_Stone_Application_%28Version_3%29
Second install Rosetta Stone
Third then use ultra iso, magic iso, or daemon tools to mount cds to install into Rosetta Stone."
,psuman,2012-01-12T11:44Z,"Need the activation code, please. Thanks."
,dzipalo,2012-01-21T23:41Z,"dude, thnx for the upload, but where do I find te activation key?"
,RedditMachine,2012-06-06T18:11Z,"For all those who are confused:

Just use PowerIso to mount each Spanish level to an unused drive, open the Rosetta Stone program and search for the language level.  It will find the language level and install it, adding the program data into a folder named content.  Then just unmount the Spanish level, mount the next level, and repeat.  "
