Product Description:

"Although I never physically fit in . . . being the sole tall, awkward African American among a sea of beautiful blonde, blue-eyed Swedes, it was my home. When I tasted the first potato of the summer, just dug out of the ground, or when I picked the first ripe cloudberry and popped it in my mouth, or when I took in the scent of seawater and we grilled salmon just off the boat, it didn't matter what I looked like - I was Swedish. I was home, and I did belong." -Helene Henderson Drawing on her fondest childhood memories, Helene Henderson offers welcome insight into the treasures of Swedish cooking. From the potato, a Swedish staple, to dessert, the start of Swedish cuisine, The Swedish Table contains more than 125 recipes, including Yellow Pea Soup with Bacon (Artsoppa), Lentil Salad with Radishes (Linssallad), Aquavit and Dill Marinated Salmon (Gravlax), Swedish Meatballs with Gravy (Kottbullar), and the country's traditional pastry, Bulla. Encompassing both traditional Swedish dishes and modern, updated recipes, Henderson combines the ingredients and scents from the past with the produce and flavor of today. The Swedish Table includes an extensive guide to Swedish traditions and celebrations, the foods that accompany them, and a color gallery of photos. With this complete collection of elegant yet easy-to-follow recipes, Henderson takes us on an enticing tour through the magic of the forest, the lakes, and the farms of the Swedish countryside.
