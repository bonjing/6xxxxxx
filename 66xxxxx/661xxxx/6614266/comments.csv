Funny how she bitched and whined on Celebrity Rehab about having to do porn for a living and how horrible it is to have to do it.

Yet, she never once said should would settle for a more normal lifestyle and give up something in exchange for a normal job or career or having to actual work for a living. 

In other words, in her mind, porn is so horrible but not bad enough to give up those fat, easy paychecks she claims she gets.

You kind of feel sorry for her on CR but she has no clue about reality and funny enough...STILL doesn't get why her previous crime/scandal is such a big deal - YOU walked up to Mary Jo Buttafuocco and SHOT HER IN THE FACE at point blank range, idiot! DUH!!!!!"
