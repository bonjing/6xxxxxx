Product Description: The celebration of Japanâ€™s vegan and vegetarian traditions begins with kanshaâ€”appreciationâ€”an expression of gratitude for natureâ€™s gifts and the efforts and ingenuity of those who transform natureâ€™s bounty into marvelous food. The spirit of kansha, deeply rooted in Buddhist philosophy and practice, encourages all cooks to prepare nutritionally sound and aesthetically satisfying meals that avoid waste, conserve energy, and preserve our natural resources.

In these pages, with kansha as credo, Japan culinary authority Elizabeth Andoh offers more than 100 carefully crafted vegan recipes. She has culled classics from shojin ryori, or Buddhist temple cuisine (Creamy Sesame Pudding, Glazed Eel Look-Alike); gathered essentials of macrobiotic cooking (Toasted Hand-Pressed Brown Rice with Hijiki, Robust Miso); selected dishes rooted in history (Skillet-Scrambled Tofu with Leafy Greens, Pungent Pickles); and included inventive modern fare (Eggplant Sushi, Tofu-Tofu Burgers).

Andoh invites you to practice kansha in your own cooking, and she delights in demonstrating how â€œnothing goes to waste in the kansha kitchen.â€ In one especially satisfying example, she transforms each part of a single daikonâ€”from the tapered tip to the tuft of greens, including the peels that most cooks would simply compostâ€”into an array of wholesome, flavorful dishes.

Decades of living immersed in Japanese culture and years of culinary training have given Andoh a unique platform from which to teach. She shares her deep knowledge of the cuisine in the two-part A Guide to the Kansha Kitchen. In the first section, she explains basic cutting techniques, cooking methods, and equipment that will help you enhance flavor, eliminate waste, and speed meal preparation. In the second, Andoh demystifies ingredients that are staples in Japanese pantries, but may be new to you; they will boost your kitchen repertoireâ€”vegan or omnivoreâ€”to new heights.
