,spifkitten99,2011-08-19T12:09Z,"The quality is as to be expected from a 175 meg, 21 min video.

It's definitely not 10, as some retards rate everything as long as it's watchable. But it's as good as usual."
,spifkitten99,2011-08-19T12:11Z,"The quality is as you can expect from a 175 meg, 21 min video. No complaints.

But stop rating it 10. It's definitely not a 10."
,spunkedunken,2011-08-19T14:20Z,"Don't complain about people rating max, no need to be a jerk. If it's good then rate it high. Eztv always delivers good torrents."
,tpbmuststay,2011-08-19T14:54Z,10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Seems to me that you forgot to realize that people which vote are giving away THEIRS opinion.

Your opinion is lower than 10? Fine, then vote, like everyone else?"

,mcgillj,2011-08-20T03:47Z,"well.. for the resolution and size.. it IS usually, I can't speak for this particular episode a TEN.. There is a different scale if we are talking about HI DEF.. then you have to break that down into 720.. or 1080... 

So.. for its CURRENT weightclass, to put a term to it.. this is a perfect copy.."
,godswallops,2011-08-20T14:18Z,"two minute d/l, 10/10 quality... doesn't get better than this!

Thanks :)"

,patddfan,2011-08-21T11:10Z,"the last few times I've noticed that these are 480i not 720p, so it always gets stretched out every time I play it with quicktime!"

,Joey_the_Lemur,2011-08-24T00:25Z,"For the life of me, I just don't understand why Comedy Central doesn't stream Futurama episodes on their site like they do with other shows (i.e., Daily Show & Colbert). Meh, who needs 'em when we can d/l 'em here? As for the resolution, no it ain't a 10. But am I complaining? Hell no! They're good enough quality for me and they d/l fast. Thanks, eztv!"
