Plot:
Comet is a super-smart chimp who dreams of blasting off into outer space and visiting Planet Malgor, but no one at Mission Control will take him seriously. Then, when he least expects it, a fantastic accident happens and Comet finds himself rocketing through space on his own. Meanwhile, Mission Control needs Comet to return to Earth to save the planet from the evil dictator Zartog. If Comet accomplishes this mission, he'll go from being the guy no one believed in...to the ultimate Space Chimp!
