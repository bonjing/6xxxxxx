In addition, in your previous torrent you discribed the resolution; in this one, on the other hand, you didn´t. What does that mean??  "
[T],Shepard76,2011-08-18T02:02Z,"The resolution is 1440 x 1080 as the first half caprikornius. This second half have two mp4 files (one of 2,5 gb and the another one of 500 mb) . The smaller file is the continuation of the larger file. That happened to me while recording because the aver tv tuner have some kind of limit size. sorry for that issue. Ill try to fix this in future uploadings. Anyway no minutes were lost in the process."
