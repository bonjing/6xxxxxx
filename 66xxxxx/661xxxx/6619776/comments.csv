,maggotXD,2011-08-23T07:33Z,Y does it ask to enter a correct CD when u press Play??
,mevidek,2011-08-23T10:53Z,"Are you trying to play both of the games, or just Age of Kings?"
,maggotXD,2011-08-23T14:03Z,just age of kings its asking for correct cd n shit
,maggotXD,2011-08-23T14:04Z,"just age of kings, any idea how to get past the cd thing?"
,mevidek,2011-08-23T15:50Z,"I need a bit more information than just age of kings n shit. I'll check it out, but it'd help if you could tell me a bit more about your problem."
,mevidek,2011-08-23T15:56Z,"go to http://m0002.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_age_of_empires_2.shtml and download the NOCD Crack. It should work. However failing that, look online for a different crack."
,mevidek,2011-08-25T12:14Z,I'm guessing it works for you then...?
,Bhuber,2011-08-25T21:00Z,The link did not work for me it is still asking for the cd
,mevidek,2011-08-26T13:14Z,Then search for other nocd cracks on the net. There're bound to be loads.
,illegaal,2011-08-28T17:36Z,"lol im noobie.
i downloaded it but how i open the file. it says it needs a program to open. with wich program i need to open it?"
,mevidek,2011-08-29T00:54Z,"Use a program such as Virtual Clone Drive, PowerISO, Magic Iso or Daemon Tools. That's to mount the file, basically it's like putting a disc into a computer. I personally use Virtual Clone Drive, although it's up to you which you use. Then follow the instructions :D"
,illegaal,2011-08-29T08:05Z,i will take your advise then
,illegaal,2011-08-29T08:24Z,if i say play it dont start. it says cannot start aoe2
,illegaal,2011-08-29T08:43Z,now i have the cd problem. can it help if i set it on a cd?
,mevidek,2011-08-29T14:22Z,"Maybe, but have you already installed it?

If so, try to use the NOCD Crack, or put it on a disc.
If not, Install it, or put it on a disc and install it. If then it still doesn't work, use the NOCD Crack."
,tjofl0jt,2011-08-31T18:21Z,"Hey guys, it wont install for me. Freezes at 51%, at one of the ttl files, or whatever they are called. I'm using Windows 7."
,mevidek,2011-09-05T00:36Z,"Then I'm not sure whether it'll work for Windows 7. I'd check around on the net. I have Vista, and it works fine for me. Hope that helps :)"
,brasmor,2011-09-13T01:20Z,it doesnt work for win 7?
,scouser87,2011-09-17T16:49Z,When I select 'Typical' install it wont go past 4% and when I choose 'Full' it crashes at 51% any ideas anyone?

,sjac89,2011-10-16T18:03Z,"scouser87 is right it doesn't work, It crashes at 51% on the setup.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4071194/Age_of_Empires_2___conquers

This one works."
,mevidek,2011-10-30T23:02Z,"Sorry it didn't work - it did for me :/

No need to get so aggressive... Although it did make me laugh to read some of the idiotic comments people made (*ahem*tigerm3*ahem*)"
,P0pe0nD0pe,2012-02-26T06:55Z,"You retard, mevidek. If there's a program that you need a CD for, and you want to upload it to the glorious internet, THEN UPLOAD A CRACK TOO. I'm not surprised that you messed it up by the appearance of your name.."
,Iggy13,2012-05-25T21:18Z,"You guys are idiots. mevidek is not the official Microsoft distributor of this game. If you can't crack a game or at least download a crack somewhere else, then just buy the game at the nearest store or on Microsoft's site. I am pretty sure you won't have trouble with cracks or similar stuff. Idiots."
