,filevans,2012-01-20T01:32Z,is this the original U.S. theatrical version from 1982 with all the deckard narration in? thanks
,filevans,2012-01-21T21:37Z,"for all those who want the original US theatrical version this is not it, this is the director's cut released in 1992/93

basically no torrent actually exists with the original theatrical that i've found, they are all mislabelled, and are mostly the international cut or the director's cut

i'm going to try and track it down and upload it for everyone"
