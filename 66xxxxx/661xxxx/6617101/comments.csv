,Shadow Master,2011-08-20T13:59Z,"Working great, thanks."
,kashwak,2011-08-20T14:00Z,"My bad, SharpOnScreen"
,bert16,2011-08-22T06:00Z,"I don't understand something. Is this release 5.0.0.34 or is it an upgrade from 34 to 35? The title of your post says 35, but your comment specifically states 34. BTW, I already have 34 and it works great."
,SantaNFPS,2011-09-01T19:13Z,Anyone know where can I find a just the server check crack? I don't mind the ads but storing your information on their site is wrong.
,freedomdwarf,2011-10-07T12:33Z,"For the sake of a few small ads in a chat window, why even risk this sort of torrent?
Trillian is *FREE* from the official developers - nothing is restricted any more.
Latest build is v5.1 build 11 so this one (or the patch) may not even work for FaceBook, G+ or Skype as they have changed the connection.
And unless you buy a Pro license and opt for the cloud sync your info is NOT stored on their servers!"
,Shadow Master,2011-10-10T16:24Z,"Uh... yeah... because this is so risky. Anyway, I was wondering why no one has uploaded any of the new 5.1 series. The 5.0 series was uploaded either the day each one was released or the next day. Those ads are pretty annoying."
