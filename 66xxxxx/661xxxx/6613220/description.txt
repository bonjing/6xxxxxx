stantly building and developing stamina and endurance, it is critical to not overlook the importance of lortifylng one's body with the nutrients needed for optimum joint wellness. Common "wear and tear" can be minimized with proper sup- plementation. Glucosamine, in combination with other sup- portive ingredients in this formula, nourish one's body so it can repair itself and return its joints to proper health. While many drugs are used to light against joint discomfort, they regrettably only target the symptoms and do very little to address the actual problem. Glucosamine, on the other hand, is a natural aminomonosaccaride found in high concentrated amounts in healthy joints, connective tissues, and cartilage. As a result, this formula is the better long-term choice for healthy joints. (Take 3 capsules after each workout.)

This unique formula is a synergistic blend of MSM, Chondroitin, and other beneficial herbs, which provide the building blocks for the body to repair its joints. MSM assists the body in healing and repairing many of its tissues, especially those at risk of repeated damage. Chondroitin is a major con- stituent found in cartilage that helps form holes within the matrix of one's joints, which the body fills with water, creating a spongy shock absorber for the joints. (Take 2 capsules after each workout.)
