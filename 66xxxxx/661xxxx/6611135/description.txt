First ogff, Id like to say: If you don't trust this torrent, then get it off their official website [link below]. I downloaded their latest torrent [currently v0.75] and uploaded it here to spread the word of this new game and hopefully find some people to play with.

Now let me give you MY description of the game so far. Bear in mind the game is subject to change and I have [at this moment] only gotten to level 32/80.

Forsaken World at first glance seems like a shameless World of Warcraft rip, but dont let that deceive you into ignoring [or loving?] it. They have a dungeon party queue system, a main quest line that you follow [as I see] throughout the whole game. A reputation system for certain factions, racial and reputation mounts, elite monsters, a job system [Alchemist, Botanist, Miner, Fisherman, Weaponsmith, ect.], and a nice variety of classes. 
This game isnt as grindy as I expected. Basically you just follow the starting quests you see around you until you get to the main city [Freedom Harbor] and then there is a guy [Henry] there that gives you a repeatable quest 20 times a day. This consists of running around the harbor learning more about the game. these quests are simple and the obvious point is to help acquaint you better with the world around you. THESE DO GET OLD, BUT THEY ARE QUICK [most of them]!
If youre looking for an easy game to play for 15min-1hr at a time, then this is for you because you can further your character easily in that time. This is also suitable for more hardcore players [such as myself] who dont mind dedicating 2-6 hours daily to furthering the development of my character.

I hope you enjoy the torrent! I GUARANTEE IT CLEAN AND IT IS CHECKED BY THEIR SERVERS NOT MINE! I WILL UPDATE AS THEY DO!
