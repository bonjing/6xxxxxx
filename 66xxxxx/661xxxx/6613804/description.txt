Robert Allen Palmer (19 January 1949 â€“ 26 September 2003), born in Batley, Yorkshire, was
a Grammy Award-winning English singer-songwriter. He was known for his distinctive voice
and the eclectic mix of musical styles on his albums, combining soul, jazz, rock, pop, reggae
and blues. He found success both in his solo career and in the supergroup Power Station,
and had Top 10 songs in both the US and the UK.

His iconic music videos by Terence Donovan for the hits "Simply Irresistible" and "Addicted to
Love", featured identically dressed dancing women with pale faces, dark eye makeup and
bright red lipstick, which resembled the women in the art of Patrick Nagel, an artist popular in
the 1980s. Sharp-suited, his involvement in the music industry commenced in the 1960s,
covered five decades and included a spell with Vinegar Joe..
