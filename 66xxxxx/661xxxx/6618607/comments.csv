The audio is just regular 5.1 DTS, not the better quality HDMA as the anthology movies are supposed to have, also the various files have been encoded to mkv with different versions of mkvmerge. Why would anyone ripping the dvd's from one source use different versions of the mkv encoder to make this collection?
I think that these files were just collected from different sources and loaded together to *appear* as the anthology."
