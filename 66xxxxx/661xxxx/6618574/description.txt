A Documentary looking at the life, temperament, character and career of chef Gordon Ramsay.

It shows how he went from trainee footballer at Glasgow Rangers (where his career was cut short by injury) to catering college, to protege of Marco Pierre White, to head chef at Aubergine by the age of 26.

But it was television that made him famous. As his temper ignited in front of the cameras, he became known to the public more for his four-letter words than his four-course menus.

There is, apparently, one surefire way of making Ramsay lose his rag. And that is to call him a "celebrity chef "!!!
