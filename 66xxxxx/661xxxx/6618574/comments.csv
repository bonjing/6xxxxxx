That would surely make him ""lose his rag"" (a tough-guy chef... FFS... eyeroll)!

And it would also be ""The Truth About Gordon Ramsay""!

Perfecto!"

,kockunge,2011-08-21T10:00Z,"i think i agree with tony bourdain who kind of says about Ramsay: (paraphrasing)...I dont like hells kitchen, but i like kitchen nightmares. Thats the real Gordon. 

HeĂÂ´s being accused of being a bully and a chauvinist. But i dont know the guy so i dont really care cause i dont really know. All celebrities are sort of ""cartoons characters"" to me. There not real, to my life - just on a screen. So personally i dont care what he REALLY is like REALLY, its not important to ME. :) But i think you can be a bastard AND a nice guy.

And also, controversy sells!
