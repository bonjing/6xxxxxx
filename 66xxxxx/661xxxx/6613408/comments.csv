Great album & quality .mp3 @ 320kbps.
Track 11 is only 128kbps but I'm not sure if it's part of the album. Maybe just an added demo.
Cheers jcrunch!"
,jcrunch,2011-08-19T12:11Z,"Thanks FootyFan4Eva for the scans â I love music but I'm not an audiophile, per se, so I wasn't sure how to go about that.
And you're correct, Track 11 is the demo version of an iTunes Australia exclusive (and I ain't in Australia). Imho, the mixing is nearly identical to the official version, except for perhaps the quality, as you duly noted. Thanks again, and enjoy the Aussie electro goodness~"
