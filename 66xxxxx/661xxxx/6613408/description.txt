Pnau is an Australian dance music duo originating from Sydney, Australia. The duo consists of musicians Nick Littlemore (vocals, production) and Peter Mayes (guitar, production). The pair have achieved multiple successes throughout their career with their award-winning debut album Sambanova, their universally acclaimed 2008 release Pnau, their breakthrough side-project Empire of the Sun, and their multiple chart-topping singles. Pnau is also recognized for their heavily publicized apprenticeship under musician Elton John, who signed the duo after listening to their record Pnau. A number of projects featuring Elton\'s involvement with the band are currently in development, such as Pnau\'s new album Soft Universe and an album featuring Pnau recreations of Elton John\'s hits.

In an interview with The Music Network, Nick stated that Pnau\'s next album, entitled Soft Universe, is coming out very soon and described it as a very \"emotional\" album, after the recent break up with his girlfriend. Littlemore sings all the vocals on the album and has co-written tracks with Elton John, fellow Aussie artist Martin Craft and producer Mark Saunders. A preview of the first single \"The Truth\" was posted online on December 15.
