The ever-popular 80s music series makes its long-awaited return with arguably the most dominant music culture of the decade â€“ Alternative. With 3CDs of the anthemic, the classic and the iconic, 12"/80s Alternative focuses on New Wave, Goth, Indie-Guitar and Industrial genres, blending big hitters with era-defining underground club tracks.
Opening the collection is probably the most timeless, iconic and biggest selling 12" of the 80s, New Order's "Blue Monday (1982 12" Version)". Then there are anthems and classic cuts from Bauhaus, Killing Joke, Sisters Of Mercy, The Mission, Spear Of Destiny, the Kevorkian mix of The Cure's "Hot Hot Hot!!!", Siouxsie & The Banshees, plus superlative extended mixes of Simple Minds, Big Country, Echo & The Bunnymen, Visage, Cabaret Voltaire and Propaganda.
Also included are the lesser-compiled tracks and mixes from Soft Cell, Tears For Fears, Frankie Goes To Hollywood's ("Welcome to the Pleasuredome" (An Alternative To Reality Mix)), the Gary Langan mix of Scritti Politti's "Absolute" and the rare, original Steve Nye 12" remix of "Nightporter" by Japan.
