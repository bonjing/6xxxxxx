  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  You play Adam Jensen, an ex-SWAT specialist who's been handpicked to 
  oversee the defensive needs of one of America's most experimental 
  biotechnology firms. Your job is to safeguard company secrets, but when a 
  black ops team breaks in and kills the very scientists you were hired to 
  protect, everything you thought you knew about your job changes
  
  Badly wounded during the attack, you have no choice but to become 
  mechanically augmented and you soon find yourself chasing down leads all 
  over the world, never knowing who you can trust. At a time when scientific 
  advancements are turning athletes, soldiers and spies into super enhanced 
  beings, someone is working very hard to ensure mankind's evolution follows 
  a particular path.
  
  You need to discover where that path lies. Because when all is said and 
  done, the decisions you take, and the choices you make, will be the only 
  things that can change it.
  
  
  
     
       A divided near-future: discover a time of great technological 
  advancement, but also a time of chaos and conspiracy. Mechanical 
  augmentations of the human body have divided society between those who can 
  afford them, and those who can't. Opposing forces conspire from the shadow 
  to control the destiny of mankind: a human revolution is coming.
  
     
       A perfect mix of action and role-play: the game uniquely combines 
  action-packed close-quarter takedowns with intense shooting, offering a 
  vast array of character augmentations and upgrades for the many weapons at 
  your disposal. Unlock new abilities and increase your stealth, social, 
  hacking or combat skills: the game rewards all styles of play and 
  approaches. Determine how you want your character to evolve, based on how 
  you want to play the game.
  
     
       Choices and consequences: shoot your way through your enemies, sneak 
  up behind them without being traced, hack systems to retrieve crucial 
  information, or use your social skills to extract information from key 
  characters - there are always choices, multiple approaches, multiple paths 
  and multiple tools at your disposal. Choose your playing style and face the 
  consequences of your actions: you decide how the story unfolds.
