,Demoa,2011-08-17T23:59Z,I never asked for this...
,ninjanutta,2011-08-18T00:43Z,have you got the pc version yet?
,Sickatriz,2011-08-18T01:29Z,"No the PC version will likely be leaked a day or 2 before release and won't be cracked till after release. 

Kinda ironic that developers flee from PC due to piracy yet the console version is always leaked weeks before release. Sucks for us PC eyecandy whores."

Seed?, Why, its a question of egoism, why the fuck should i seed for you guys when you cant do the same for us.

Its better to skip this shit and get our asses over to places that really matters.

,Asahireven,2011-08-20T11:49Z,"@bush82   Every other game has worked so far, just not this one. Guess I'll try a re-burn! 

Procedure that has worked every time:
Run game through abgx --> ImgBurn --> Play

My only problem so far has been my DL-DVD burner. It's a Samsung SE-S084 (stand alone slim) And EVERY SINGLE TIME it gives me 3x writing speed (or more) instead of 2,4x .. fuckes up way to many discs.. haven't found a solution yet."
