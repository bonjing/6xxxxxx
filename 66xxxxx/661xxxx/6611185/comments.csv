...
It's getting a little irritating that way tbh.  I may stop reading if this trend keeps up.  Still, thx for the ul."
,elrobolobo,2011-08-19T05:48Z,oh shit i'm so pumped to read this
,stijr,2011-08-19T11:05Z,genuine torrent. Thanks!
,shonuffx,2011-08-20T01:15Z,"Thanks a lot, man! What don't you like about TWD right now, dargonhuman? I think it's still great. They could switch to bi-weekly again for a while to speed stuff up..."
,kimjongwil,2011-08-20T09:57Z,i didn't like the last miniseries of them being stuck in the walled neighbourhood - it's really starting to get stale for me too. loved it up to this point.
,kimjongwil,2011-08-20T10:03Z,"just read it. yup. stale. i think they're running out of ideas cuz it's back to the same old ""splinter group"" formula."
,pow.r.pop,2011-08-20T14:51Z,"Thank the Nordic Gods of Comic books for torrents....

Because this story is becoming shit.

I heard someone say that it has become the SMURF Village and he's right.

No Action, more of a cheezy soap opera and NO ZOMBIES !

NO Danger 

No suspense

No plot development 

Nothing exciting 

And the Artwork has slowly been going downhill for a long time.

Can't they get a better artist by now?

They got a Number 1 show, why make the comic SHIT !?

I'm glad it's available in a torrent, because I can't bring myself to pay for another issue until it becomes the comic I fell in love with to begin with........That's right, It's not a divorce , just a trial separation. "
,here-am-i,2011-08-29T19:52Z,Thank U!
,kencle,2011-08-30T02:55Z,Thank you very much.
,dmangus2013,2011-09-04T02:17Z,"You guys are ignorant.  They can't have constant zombie mayhem it would get alot staler than it is, as you think I don't,  It has to have other points to build the characters and establish shit first. They just got done with the wall falling and carl getting shot.  Give Kirkman and Adlard a break. Damn."
,Death2Dipshits,2011-09-05T02:22Z,"@pow.r.pop
No Action? your a fucking moron.
No Danger? Its ALWAYS THERE, FUCKING MORON.
No Suspense? THERE SURROUNDED BY ZOMBIES THAT NEVER STOP YOU STUPID FUCKING MORON!!
No Plot Development? THAT'S WHAT A STORY IS AND THIS IS A STORY YOU STUPID FUCK!
& Nothing exciting, Kid JUST got shot in the fucking head how many issues ago..? Seriously if all your going to do is bitch with COMPLETELY BULLSHIT reasons, fucking kill yourself, or come up with real reasons. I'm glad you don't like it cause you need to stop reading, do you not understand what a fucking fan is? EVERYONE besides a fucking moron (YOU) who does not understand what a zombie story IS. That's right SHUT THE FUCK UP."
,creep2maniac,2011-09-05T03:19Z,"this is becoming lame, sort of a writers block. powpop seems right, were excited for the new issue but then disappointed when we read the contents and sketches are not good too."
,pow.r.pop,2011-09-06T19:59Z,"@Death2Dipshits

Dude. Chill the fuck out.

Yes I know what a Fan is. 

I also know what a stupid brainless Fanboy Fucktard is.

As I said, it used to be a good comic.

But nothing is happening right now. And you have  to agree that the artwork is going downhill, right?

Don't be blind dude.

Read your comment. You didn't make any points and you didn't impress anyone.

You just made yourself look like a stupid jackass.

UNLESS !! ?

Hey,..!.....Are you the writer ??!"
,Death2Dipshits,2011-09-07T03:43Z,"@pow.r.pop
 Go watch a zombie flick if you want constant death, dipshit. This is what the book has always fucking been, just because they aren't on the road being attacked non-stop does not mean it's bad.
And no, you only know what a TROLL is, no fucking idea what story is about. No ones looking to impress anyone here besides you kiddo, fucking moron you are, Don't be blind? Don't cloud your judgement with idiocy, seems too late though. Might as well kill yourself, or i don't know get a fucking life that involves not trolling to make yourself feel better, get another book, and/or get your first pussy.  "
,pow.r.pop,2011-09-08T03:15Z,Hahaha
,pow.r.pop,2011-09-08T03:17Z,"Dude, I've been reading the comic from the beginning. This is the most boring part of the series yet. 
Fact: Did you know that swearing a lot makes you look like a grade A moron ?
Fact: The way you construct you sentences exposes you age and/or intelligence somewhere between 8 and 13 years old.
That brings me to my next fact.
Fact : I've gotten more Real Pussy than you you have even  jerked off to in your pathetic Kiddy Porn stash. Loser"
,pow.r.pop,2011-09-08T03:18Z,"Fact :Your tough words mean nothing in the internet so shut the hell up fag.
Fact: You are fuming with anger and I am laughing my ass off at you."
,pow.r.pop,2011-09-08T03:58Z,LOSER
,drunkjoker333,2011-09-10T18:46Z,"Idc what anyone thinks, it's a hell of a comic and we could only be lucky if the series follow half of the comic but I doubt it since the first season went off track towards the end, but none the less both are fucking great"
,bettylynn,2011-09-15T17:29Z," thanks ! i love the series ,,,, where is issue 89 ? "
,theKAR,2011-09-19T11:02Z,"pow.r.pow You are seriously trolling and the ""facts"" you had put just make you seem less intelligent than Death2Dipshits. For example "" Fact: Did you know that swearing a lot makes you look like a grade A moron ?"" this is not a fact but an opinion much like almost every other ""fact"" you have entered. On the story though, I believe the drawing quality has been nearly the same since the 2nd writer started, but it doesn't really matter. I actually enjoy the new arc, its like the prison arc but seems more secure from humans but less from the zombies, so a bit of a re-do but it still changes it up a bit. Now that something has happened to his last family member I believe the most recent events could change much more drastically considering the last time something happened to his family he was escaping the prison after a group was invading. We'll have to see but I think it might go back to its traveling roots quite soon."
,pow.r.pop,2011-09-23T23:16Z,"@theKAR

If it ain't a fact then fuck you too !

I'm no troll. 

Your opinion means nothing too. Get your butt-cheeks ready for another shitty smurf village adventure in the next comic....coming soon !

If they get back on the road, I will be really happy. I need more than this bullshit from my REAL LIFE !...I don't escape to be BORED out of mu skull !

And I am bored"
,dreetn3,2011-09-27T22:51Z,"damn, these comics used to be fucking awesome. these last series in the walled village bore the living hell out of me though. hope things get more exciting again because this sucks big time!
but can't complain, these downloads are free at least, imagine paying for this kind of crap, so thanks for the up"
,No99,2011-10-14T01:24Z,"This is actually pretty good, i agree and ONLY AGREE that yes it seems like it is getting a bit uninteresting BUT if you give it a little faith it'll definitely be worth the wait :)"
