[V],wushdishmeen,2011-08-24T11:17Z,Howard is on vacation until August 29th.   They are re-airing Dracula Gottfried Meets The Wack Pack special from 2008.   There will be no new torrents until they return live!
,jumpbreaker,2011-08-27T14:09Z,Howard won't be back live next week. They'll be airing the new The Wack Pack Strikes Back special the whole week. The Monday after that they will air The Music of Howard Stern so he will be back on live on Tuesday September the 6th for a 3-day week.
[V],wushdishmeen,2011-08-30T01:01Z,Yea I'm aware of this now...  they didn't announce it at the point of writing that.
