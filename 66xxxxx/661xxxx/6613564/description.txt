The TV series \\\"The Press\\\", is a fast paced crime series that takes place on a tabloid newspaper in Reykjavik.

The six-episode series revolve around the main character LARA, who is a single mom in her thirties. She is hired as a new reporter on the tabloid newspaper in the beginning of the first episode. Also introduced in the beginning is the disappearance of the engineer MANI. At first, his disappearance looks like a foul play and perhaps a murder. However, no body is found.

Each 45 minute episode also presents individual cases that are solved at the end of the episode.

The show focuses on presenting modern Icelandic reality, and the role of the tabloid newspaper reflecting the society. The six episodes are standalone but the show has been developed as a returnable series. The show is shot handheld which gives it more intimacy with its audience as well as the fast pace that was mentioned before. We feel we\\\'re a part of this world we\\\'ve been introduced into with suspense, drama and in the end LARA finds out what really went wrong.
