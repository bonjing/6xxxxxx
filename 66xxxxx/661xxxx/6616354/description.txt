This is to cover requests from various people.  These are for most part exclusive release at demonoid.  When you go to the "other" sites, check posting time and you will see they bagged them from here.
These are complete as to content.  [color=red]For DS4 installers [b]metadata[/b] is not included![/color]
So don't whine about "missing" files.  If you want to run Content Management and broadcast to certain people what you have on your system, get those from somewhere else.
