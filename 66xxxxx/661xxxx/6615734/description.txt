Welcome to Tag Team Tuesdays. Totally non-scripted, all in front of a live audience, all broadcast live to members. Today's update is RD 3 of 4.

An amazing finish to one of the toughest most brutal tag teams matches to date. It all came down to the end the last seconds, The Dragons are behind, the tags are used up. Dragonlilly reaches deep down and powers out a win. The crowd goes batshit insane. Don't miss this great conclusion to a soon to be classic tag team match up!
