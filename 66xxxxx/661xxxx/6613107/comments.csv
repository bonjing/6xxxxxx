[T],trialNerror,2011-08-20T17:05Z,"That's correct; my own rips.  You're welcome.

For those that are unaware, this is the ""Summer Finale"" episode to make room for the return of the original Ghost Hunters on Aug. 24th.

I'm also stoked for the return of Fact or Faked, Destination Truth, and SyFy's new series Paranormal Witness.  

Also, Ghost Adventures returns for the PREMIERE of season 5 (S05E01... jerks) next month, too.  

Should be an entertaining Fall Season!"
