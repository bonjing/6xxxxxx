The most dangerous thing is to be alive
 America has fallen. A vampiric scourge sweeps the nation, turning brother on brother and parent on child as the blood-hungry beasts take deeper and deeper hold upon the land. It's hard for the survivors to know whether to be more afraid of the creatures themselves or the violent religious groups that have sprung up in response, but there is clearly only one choice: fight or die.
 Connor Paolo (Gossip Girl) stars as Martin, a young man traveling with only his taciturn mentor - a hardened fighter known simply as Mister - as protection against this blasted earth in search of the rumoured safe haven of New Eden. Winner of the Midnight Madness Award at the Toronto International Film Festival and hailed as "the American horror film of the year" (Todd Brown, TwitchFilm.com), Stake Land establishes director Jim Mickle as a leader in the new generation of horror.
