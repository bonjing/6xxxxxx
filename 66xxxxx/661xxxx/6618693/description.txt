This is Microsoft Foxpro 2.6 (SPANISH LANGUAGE VERSION) for MS Windows
- as found on the net, then patched to work with XP in addition to win98. 
Haven't tried it on any other Windows versions It is also the minimum install
- all extras are omitted such as code samples and help files etc

You could change the world worth this if you just get to learn some
dBase commands and programming language skills


Buena Suerte!
