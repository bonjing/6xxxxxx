,JayW93,2011-08-26T17:48Z,"A few friends of mine had AntiVirus notifications when downloading this. They turned out to be nothing. File's clean, program works amazingly well, and i'm really happy with the uploader. You can even host your own multiplayer server!!!"
,JustPosting,2011-08-27T17:21Z,Wow.... i Got a trojan. At least my firewall stopped it... Asshole...
,miguelsz3,2011-08-27T19:01Z,"@JustPosting

,RORLVR1,2011-08-28T05:47Z,"I thought it looked a little suspicious, and Trend Micro gave me an alert, but it's an installer exe not just game files. Clean, Good."
,jimmy1up,2011-08-29T15:05Z,if some idiot like JustPosting is scared of trojans pirate kasperspy internet security 2012 and use the safe-run folder :P
,ashleycole12345,2011-08-30T19:29Z,"Thanks man, I always look for your releases, you provide great quality torrents and I have not had a fault with ANY of them as of yet. Keep it up!"
,Gunzoid,2011-09-01T09:49Z,"yes... The Terraria!
this game looks really fun, thank miguelsz3"
,afonsanho,2011-09-04T00:52Z,you provided a great torrent once more...
,ncc46537,2011-09-08T02:14Z,"Once more, fine upload.
Y'know, it's funny...
I came across a torrent for something I really wanted once, but every single comment said that it was infected.
Many high-level uploaders even said it was.
So, I downloaded it anyway...
Turns out their anti-virus programs kept picking up a text file with 'malicious code' in it."
,regen2100,2011-09-15T23:48Z,"If it works (which im sure it probably does)
I'll help seed"
,Cloid1337,2011-09-25T03:36Z,Thanks! Worked Nicely :D

,len8946,2011-10-02T06:17Z,"My scanner tells me that this contains a trogan, and the scan results you posted say the same thing. You guys insist that this torrent is clean, who do I trust? :S"
,miguelsz3,2011-10-02T12:41Z,"@len8946
Trust Thy Heart Young One. (-_-)b"

,LuN4t1C,2011-11-03T18:55Z,"Thanks for this great torrent, don't mind the people who don't understand anything of torrent and trojan horses and virusses. Please keep uploading these amazing torrents and just ignore those few people!"
,LuN4t1C,2011-11-03T19:05Z,"There is something peculiar going on; according to the multi-scanner results, F-Secure shouldn't report any false-positives, but my F-Secure found a trojan.   Be careful download this, but it's probably a false positive"
,miguelsz3,2011-11-06T00:37Z,"@LuN4t1C 
The multiscanner results were updated...
F-Secure now shows a result. =/"
,Darklordof,2011-11-06T08:55Z,Thanks
