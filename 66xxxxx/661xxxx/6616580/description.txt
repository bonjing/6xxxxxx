Circus Ponies NoteBook is the revolutionary award-winning application that helps Mac users manage all those bits of information that lack a good home: web clippings, notes, even the e-mails, diagrams and documents of a project. Create Notebooks, with sections and subsections, to hold it all. Add text, drag in files, \"clip\" web pages and other content. Annotate your information with diagrams and sketches, highlighting and keywords, even voice recordings. Find anything instantly with NoteBook\'s patented Multidex. Then convert it all to PDF, or publish directly to your MobileMe account or FTP server. Access your Notebooks on the go with the iPad version of NoteBook.
