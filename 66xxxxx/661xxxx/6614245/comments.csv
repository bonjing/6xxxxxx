,doude422,2011-08-19T02:57Z,love you
,jcbycroft,2011-08-19T03:33Z,"Man, I suggested you to all those FXG lovers when they bailed and the second I did you totally stepped up your game even more. I've supported your work since the beginning man. Thanks for all the new ups, and not making me out to be a liar."
,jcbycroft,2011-08-19T03:34Z,"I will literally war with you for the next five years. Seriously. I'm not joking. I mean literally every day when you log on you will see me building an army and attacking you. Until every resource is returned to me. So I hope you are prepared to deal with that. I've been here several years now. I'm in the top 100 on almost every single stat. I have nothing better to do then mess with you. I asked you to donate. You did not even reply nor did you donate. Another player on the same island asked the same of you. You did not comply. You come to this island with no intentions of helping, but max out your workers. How is that fair to us I ask you. Then you respond with a rookie coward move and ask your alliance to rescue you? For what? From not donating? So like I said, literally every day you will see my name in your military advisor until each and every resource is returned to me. Enjoy the rest of your game."

00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,308
Easy, friends.

2
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,768
She's with me.

3
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,820
Time for bed little one.

4
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,488
Can l bring him?

5
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,700
Of course.

6
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,723
Excuse me, sorry.

7
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,017
Does he know?

8
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,911
l'm taking the GT40.

9
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,669
This car suits me better.

10
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,396
lt's okay...we're all going to the same place.

11
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,272
We'll get the car there.

12
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,653
Go after the girl!

13
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,613
Hurry up!

14
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:23,370
The American fugitives killed three
DEA agents during a train robbery...

15
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:26,414
...Police warn they are armed and
extremely dangerous.

16
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:30,418
Anyone with information should contact law
enforcement immediately...

17
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,685
l apologize for the interruption.

18
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,938
Senor Reyes, may l speak with you?

19
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,399
We've found them.

20
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:12,662
Go that way!

21
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,539
The other two went over the wall!

22
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:05,707
l told you the skinny chick had balls.

23
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:08,210
Looks like she started the party without us.

24
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:14,341
What's this guy saying?

25
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,927
Ugly is still ugly in Spanish or in English.

26
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,019
Nobody move!

27
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:55,974
Explain.

28
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,310
They invaded the Leblon house.

29
00:48:58,686 --> 00:48:59,978
Who invaded?

30
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,480
The men from the train.

31
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,949
How much did they take?

32
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:15,076
They didn't take anything.

33
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:18,705
They burned it!

34
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,624
They burned my money?

35
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,793
Yes. And said there's more coming.

36
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:32,927
Okay...

37
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:43,563
Then this...

38
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,900
...is what we're going to do.

39
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:55,075
Clean the houses.

40
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:59,371
l want that money under lock and key...

41
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,082
...within an hour.

42
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:04,417
Understand?

43
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,254
Understood.

44
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:27,310
Looks like this is going to be
a shorter trip than l thought...

45
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:06,242
Everything okay?

46
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:07,327
Everything is okay.

47
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:10,079
Who is this Hobbs?
This Federal Agent running around town?

48
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,497
Some American cowboy.

49
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,082
He's handled.

50
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:14,918
He killed sixteen of our men.

51
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:16,878
Handle him better.

52
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:22,467
Look... He requested a rookie patrol oĂÂ¤icer
as his assistant.

53
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:26,179
They won't be a problem.

54
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:57,001
-lt's all here?
-Yes.

55
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:00,254
What about Toretto and O'Conner?
Where are they?

56
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:01,714
Nothing yet.

57
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,550
But l have all our officers searching.

58
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,552
Not good enough.

59
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:08,805
Put a price on their heads.

60
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:10,390
High enough...

61
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,101
...to get every pair of eyes in the city
searching for them.

62
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,962
Two to one says you blow the wrong pipe.

63
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,507

You need to learn to relax, loco.

67
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:37,758
You better hurry up,
we got less than a minute.

68
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:43,723
Why do you always set the timer so short?

69
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:09,707
l hope you know where you're going.

70
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:28,517
...a police station.

71
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:42,365
You used too much explosive! Again.

72
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,201
Too much, too little...

73
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,702
lt's all the same.

74
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:52,166
That's some Buddha shit you learned
from a book in the prison library, isn't it?

75
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:55,086
And what you're doing there on the wall...

76
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,963
You got that from the same book, huh?

77
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:23,150
Damn, bro...

78
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:54,306
Dominic Toretto's ride in my garage.

79
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:59,937
Now that... will be a nice trophy.

80
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:03,895
l know she's here!

81
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:07,899

Go! Go! Go!

83

Yo, you burned it!

84
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:07,125
Yeah, but your mom is the worst cook
in the world.

85
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:30,255
See?

86

l called in every cop on our payroll.

87

We're covered.

88
01:39:39,557 --> 01:39:41,016
We've got every entrance covered
with weapons teams.

89
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:43,852
God Himself couldn't get at your money
if He wanted to.

90

God isn't my worry.

91
01:41:00,805 --> 01:41:02,264
What's happening?

92
01:41:02,348 --> 01:41:03,724
They're taking the vault!

93

-What?
-The vault!

100

They have no way out.

101

Hey, what is he doing?

102
01:49:29,813 --> 01:49:30,980
We've got him!

103
01:49:47,831 --> 01:49:49,082
Close down the bridge!

105
01:50:36,839 --> 01:50:37,922

After creating the text file  just simply rename it with a .srt file extension.

eg. FastFive.txt  to FastFive.srt

If you are going to convert to .vob (dvd format) then make sure the sub file is the same name as the .avi file
E.g. FastFive.avi  and FastFive.srt

If using vso's convertxtodvd then just drop both files into the box and convert.

@pankusvx------if you look at the first page of comments you will see that the most great and wonderful extremezone has made the subtitles for this one himself and all you have to do to make them work is to copy and paste them in a text document and then rename the text document to a .srt file.  It is really simple, all you have to do is copy, paste, save as fastfive.srt and then, i dont know how you have things organized but, I moved mine to my subtitles folder which is very easy to access during movie in vlc media player by going to video options and then subtitles track and then all you have to do is to be able to find where you saved the fastfive.srt file and double click it and voila....it works like a charm .....  as for making them yourself for other movies it is exactly the same principle you just have to know at what times the subtitles need to come up EXACTLY and then you can revert to the great extremezones subtitles and do exactly as he has done.  Im sure the hard part is finding exactly what is said after the movie has just come up.  I would hate to have to watch it all and then try to translate it for myself.  I am sure that would be quite difficult.  What with literal translations and what not.  Once again....I cannot thank you enough exremezone..... YOUR THE MAN"

Make sure you have decent settings before complaining about download speeds. The ratio of seeders to leechers is far and above amazing on this torrent and nobody should be complaining about it.

Do some Google searches for information on how to increase torrent speeds. A really good subject to look into is the torrent connections limit. In addition to bandwidth caps, the number of connections you are using per torrent, and globally, can make a huge impact on your download and upload speeds.

Also remember that sometimes you just have to wait a little while to get your chance."

,Commlink,2011-08-22T12:48Z,"@ut_bhai and others needing to know how to get subtitles setup using KMPlayer....

Open Notepad, copy and past the subtitles, extremezone posted, into notepad. Remove any text that isn't part of the subtitles (ex: extremezone at xxxx) if you copied it all at once instead of post by post.

Go to save your file, type in any name for the subs with .srt on the end as the file extension. Set to UTF-8 and make sure All Files is selected in the pulldown so it saves with .srt instead of saving as .srt.txt.

Move the sub file you created to the folder if you want (easier to keep things organized, for me at least). Open up the movie in KMPlayer and press ALT+O (the letter, not the number zero). Navigate to the location of your subtitle file and select to open it.

After that, just press ALT+X. Text should show up on the screen saying Subtitle: Show (or Hide) and you should be all set.

Regarding the movie;

A/V: 10/10 - Great quality for a DVD rip.
M: Everyone will have their own opinions. For me, it was fun to watch, a bit ridiculous at time (especially some of the dialogue), definitely not something I feel is a great sequel for the series, but it was still enjoyable and no worse than a couple of the others. Looking forward to see what they do for the next and whether or not Michelle Rodriguez will actually be back."
