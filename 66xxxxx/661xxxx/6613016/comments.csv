Probably your rips are ok for the size but every time you claim ""Best Quality"" you are talking total crap.  Best quality is the original untouched stream.  Next is high bitrate, unscaled video with untouched audio.  Next is scaled high bitrate video that has benefited from minimal denoise and unsharp filters and has untouched or high bitrate transcoded audio. 

Your rips are not even on the same scale. Best Quality in no way equates to ""massive denoising+oversharpening+low-bitrate"".

Present your rips as what they are, instead of something they cannot be."

,muLineZu,2011-08-19T02:51Z,"Not ""Best Quality""? There's another release (CHD) of Brazil on TPB that's over 15GB, if this one's not good enough for you. I don't get it: all the fuss for a tag! Most of us would like to download the blu-rays demuxed (20-50 GB/movie) but as in all things in life, must keep a balance between physical space on hdds, time required for a download, and so on... so we'll have to settle for 1.5-3.0 GB/movie, if we wish to keep an acceptable ratio quality/quantity. There are some VIP guys here on TPB, that rip blu-rays @ 720p at 400-700MB / movie, and have more than 1000 seeders...
My point: there's something for everyone; take what you like and ignore what you're not interested in. To be critic just for the sake of it, isn't constructive.
Thanks murdoc47! I loved this film when I have first seen it - and the are more than 20 years since then - and I still want to see it again now."
[T],murdoc47,2011-08-19T07:59Z,"thanks muLineZu, for saying exactly what i was thinking! i'm just tired of arguing over nonsense. enjoy the movie!"
,CosmAvngr,2011-08-25T00:44Z,"Unlike complainers. I actually DL'd and checked this out. The quality is very good. 

Murdoc is doing a great job with his releases, 2-3GB 720p releases are ideal for many people.  

Plus he uses AC3 sound, where most 2-3GB releases use AAC (needing a conversion step to play on SPDIF receivers).

Plus he is doing lots of great classic movies, not the 200th version of the latest Fast and Furious.

Thanks again murdoc."
[T],solstars,2012-01-08T00:14Z,Yeah  definitely THANK YOU!  I was about to encode this one myself and found your post.  I too am sick and tired of people bitching about the FREE movies they get here.  There are a lot of ungrateful leeching bastards on this site who have no idea what it really takes to get these movies to a point where they can download them.
