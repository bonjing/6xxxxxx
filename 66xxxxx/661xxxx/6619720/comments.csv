""..I don`t think it deserves to be uploaded...""

Re: Non-sense. These movies are much better then you think; interesting story, inventive costumes & witty humor (some dubs are in some parts even better, funnier then the original English), I haven't felt bored for one second watching them.
If you think your opinion/critic is worthwhile take it to imdb because I don't think pirates give a damn about your likes/dislikes."
,Night_89,2011-08-24T02:35Z,"Del Torro's imagination is a beautiful thing. He has created some of the most fascinating creatures that traditional Hollywood doesn't have the guts or inclination to ever assemble.
Hellboy is no exception and it has a great dark comic book atmosphere.
Too bad that the story and most of the characters don't really work out the way they're supposed to.

So,
""Visually it's outstanding, Mentally it's mediocre,"" or, ""Quite stylish but somewhat disappointing movie"""
,Night_89,2011-08-24T02:37Z,"But Thanks to you
Lovers would download them and haters would not,
there is nothing to be worried"

Thanks!"
,vladoneTC,2011-09-18T07:23Z,"very bad bluray decoding/encoding.... I try to reencode to .avi some of your releases and get many errors (audio delay, a/v not in sync, video can't be demuxed/decoded, reencode takes to much time for a 7 GiB filesize.1080p.) And that's happend ONLY at your releases."
