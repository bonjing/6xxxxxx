Hackers have uncovered the dark side of cryptographyâ€”that device developed to defeat Trojan horses, viruses, password theft, and other cyber-crime. Itâ€™s called cryptovirology, the art of turning the very methods designed to protect your data into a means of subverting it. In this fascinating, disturbing volume, the experts who first identified cryptovirology show you exactly what youâ€™re up against and how to fight back.

They will take you inside the brilliant and devious mind of a hackerâ€”as much an addict as the vacant-eyed denizen of the crackhouseâ€”so you can feel the rush and recognize your opponentâ€™s power. Then, they will arm you for the counterattack.

This book reads like a futuristic fantasy, but be assured, the threat is ominously real. Vigilance is essential, now.
