The inside story of Hawkwind, one of Britain's wildest acid rock bands. Emerging from
the Ladbroke Grove underground at the end of the 60s, the band trailed radicalism and
counter-culture in their wake, and have been a direct influence on punk, metal, dance
and rave. Includes interviews with some of the band's enduring legends, including
bassist Lemmy, writer Michael Moorcock, founder members Terry Ollis, Nik Turner and
Mick Slattery, and former managers Doug Smith and Jeff Dexter.
