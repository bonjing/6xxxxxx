    "The Phantom Creeps" was Universal's 44th sound-era serial (between      
    "The Oregon Trail" and "The Green Hornet") and was re-issued to          
    theaters in 1949 by Commonwealth Pictures Corporation, a distribution    
    set-up handling primarily Universal re-issues. Commonwealth had no       
    hand at all in the production of this serial (as incorrectly shown on    
    site) as they were a distribution company only. Some sources             
    mistakenly identify them as the serial producer because all of the       
    1949 re-issue prints (and the 16mm prints sold to television circa       
    1952) show "Commonwealth Pictures Corp. Presents" above the              
    title.There is a whole lot of difference between "presenting" and        
    "producing", a fact that some sources appear to not know or don't        
    care. The serial is of interest to some collectors as it re-unites       
    Bela Lugosi and Edwin Stanley from 1931's "Dracula", and the             
    crater-discovery of the meteorite fragment by Zorka in the serial is     
    stock footage from Universal's 1936 "The Invisible Ray." The stock       
    footage of an explosion and avalanche used in Chapter 11 comes from      
    Universal's 1934 serial, "The Vanishing Shadow." Plot finds eccentric    
    scientist Dr. Alex Zorka carrying on various experiments in his          
    secret laboratory with the aid of his assistant Monk. Zorka has          
    invented many strange weapons of warfare, including a devisualizer       
    belt which renders him invisible; a terrifying, eight-foot tall robot    
    (played by stuntman Edwin "Bud" Wolfe and not circus giant Bud           
    Wolff), and he also has a deadly meteorite fragment (which he found      
    in a 1936 movie with Boris Karloff) from which he extracts an element    
    which can induce suspended animation in an entire army. Foreign          
    spies, operating under the guise of a foreign language school (great     
    cover), are trying to buy or (mostly) steal the meteorite element,       
    while his former partner, Dr. Fred Mallory, miffed that Zorka will       
    not turn his inventions over to the U.S. Government, blows the           
    whistle on him to Captain Bob West of the Military Intelligence          
    Department. Tired of answering the door and saying no to the spies       
    and the government, Zorka moves his lab and when his beloved wife is     
    killed, Zorka, puttering around for his own amusement up to this         
    point, gets hacked off as only Lugosi can, swears eternal vengeance      
    against society, and decides to use his inventions to make himself       
    world dictator. And would have if not for his assistant Monk, an         
    escaped convict virtually enslaved by Zorka, who is cowardly,            
    treacherous and totally incompetent, and whose accidental or             
    deliberate interference with Zorka's efforts repeatedly frustrates       
    his master's grand schemes.
