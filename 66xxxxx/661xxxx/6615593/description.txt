Release Notes:

You could be forgiven for missing Fionn ReganÂ’s third long-player in the release
schedules. Unlike his previous set, 2010Â’s The Shadow of an Empire, this arrives
with relatively little fanfare, a result of the Bray-born singerÂ’s retreat from
the mainstream five years on from his Mercury-nominated debut, The End of
History. Said disc was an understated delight, but its follow-up favoured
amplification over introspection, and its troubled gestation produced an
underwhelming collection. But 100 Acres of Sycamore finds Regan returning to the
acoustic prettiness of his first album, embellishments restricted to gently
swelling strings rather than distracting bombast.

ReganÂ’s focus has shifted Â– where he previously looked out onto the world from a
lofty position in the indie-folk world, today heÂ’s back in the margins that once
held him so dearly. And heÂ’s comfortable here, operating at a commercial level
below that of fellow Mercury nominee (and Brit-winner) Laura Marling, and thus
able to write without the pressure that those in the spotlight have to endure.
100 Acres of Sycamore is an unhurried set that makes its point lightly, without
bluster. Recorded overseas, in a Spanish villa owned by the actress Anna Friel,
itÂ’s full of a wistfulness that perhaps wouldnÂ’t have manifested had this been
produced in more familiar surroundings. The speed of its capture Â– straight to
tape in just seven days Â– results in a freshness that evokes ReganÂ’s fine EPs
for the Anvil label, Reservoir and Hotel Room. This is the sound of an artist
returning to his roots in the right way Â– for personal gratification rather than
commercial gain.

Such is the intimacy throughout this album Â– though the strings are full, they
never overpower the simple set-up of reflective lyrics and strummed guitar Â–
that one feels a direct connection with the artist, on an
individual-to-individual level. Regan was singing for himself, honest and
sincere, when recording these tracks; and with his voice in a pair of
headphones, the listener is transported to the Majorcan residence the Irishman
found so conducive to crafting album three. ItÂ’s a fine body of work, the kind
of album that doesnÂ’t benefit from having highlights lifted from it. True, there
are songs that beguile with the sort of laidback beauty that so few indie-folk
performers are capable of producing Â– 1st Day of May, lead single For a
Nightingale, the echo-soaked (and over-too-soon) closer Golden Light (imagine
Bradford Cox going country) Â– but this is a collection best heard as the artist
intended: in the order presented, without compromise. That warmth youÂ’re feeling
come its close, try to hold onto it. ItÂ’s a contentment few albums leave you
with.
