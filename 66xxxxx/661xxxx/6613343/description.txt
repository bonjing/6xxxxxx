The publication of the complete 7 volume set of The New Cambridge Medieval History is a major landmark in the field of historical publishing. Written by leading international scholars and incorporating the very latest research, the History is the essential reference tool for anyone interested in the medieval world. The original Cambridge Medieval History was published between 1911 and 1936. That famous series is now out of print and has been replaced by The New Cambridge Medieval History which presents a reliable, detailed history from late antiquity to c. 1500. Published in seven volumes, with Volume IV divided into two parts, it provides a unique, authoritative guide to medieval life and thought.
