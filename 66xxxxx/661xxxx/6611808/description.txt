From the Infowars web site ::

Alex welcomes back to the show retired CIA officer turned political activist, Ray McGovern. Ray presented morning intelligence briefings at the White House during his 27 year career as an employee of the federal government. McGovern will talk about GOP presidential candidate Rick Perry's demand that AG Holder and the Justice Department prosecute private citizens who are participating in the Gaza-bound aid flotilla. He will also talk about the helicopter crash in Afghanistan that claimed the lives of 30 American and 8 Afghan troops and also the manufactured crisis over the debt ceiling.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
