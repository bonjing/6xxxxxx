,LiaFlia,2011-08-20T17:32Z,"Hello. I downloaded this game less than 12 hours ago and played it without any problems. I shut down my computer when I got down to the last 4 stages. Now when I try to play Rio again, I get an error message: ""Failed to open /Applications/Angry Birds Rio.app/Contents/Resources/data/images/PC/THEME_4_CARNIVAL_1.png

Is this happening to anyone else? How might I fix this problem?"
