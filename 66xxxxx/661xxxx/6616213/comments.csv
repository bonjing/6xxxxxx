Download and install ""Classic codec pack"" and open the video with ""Classic Media Player"" then right click the screen and you will see a option for subtitles"

,yousef86,2012-04-17T12:32Z,"Great Quality Rip!

Pros: Japanese Audio is 10/10. Can clearly be heard through all the loud background sounds and music. English Subtitles are 10/10.

Cons: It's hard to hear the English Audio when the music is playing or loud sounds in the background. 7/10.

Cartoon-World/RThsA/C-W Gets My +1 of Approval!"
