Thanks to l.diliberto at tpb for uploading the full collection from
which we made some picks for those that don't want all the esoteric stuff -
only what is in mainstream appeal to give a good enough idea of the eclectic
range of this great performer, and while including all his best picks from it.

Certainly if one of the great standards of traditional Italian music - 
"Torna a Surriento" (done by all great Italian performers including
Luciano Pavarotti, Andrea Bocelli and even Dean Martin Al Martino and others)
is something you have yet to hear from Renzo Arbore, you might have saved the
best for last. Indeed Dean Martin also does an English version of this great
song for lovers of Italian music. In Renzo's case its hauntingly passionate with
his usual appeal that ranges into what is gypsy music genre of emotive intensity
as you will find flowing through many of his songs - some of which are rather
obvious in what is the pronounced use of mandolin sounds for effect that would
normally appear out of place perhaps. Nonetheless his range is impressive and
merits incorporation into any respectable collection of European music of best
appeal. "O Sole mio" and "Funiculi Funicula" - just as well known in fact I would
think, are too included in this 72MB subset of the "Napoli" Arbore CD collection
we found to download as indicated. A song or two were edited for intro length 
only as it is on occasion a bit overdone in its effect - just slightly. Grazie
