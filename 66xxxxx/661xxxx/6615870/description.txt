The Armstrong Powerhouse presents a scenario pack focusing on steam railtours on Britains modern-day railways. This pack contains six scenarios using six separate locomotives and three different routes (Oxford to Paddington, Newcastle to York (Modern) & WCML North) so this is almost certainly our most varied pack to date. These scenarios allow you to give these grand locomotives a good run out and the passing AI traffic offers realism, variety and interest through the use of various other locomotive and rolling stock packs.

In these scenarios, we have strived for realism in all areas. For example, each scenario is based on an actual railtour that has operated in reality and uses the timetable of its relevant year to create an as realistic experience as possible. As well as this, most trains have their time of leaving, origin and destination so you can see which train is which!
