,BoonDockSaiNt30,2011-08-21T05:10Z,cinavia protected can not use it for ps3
,theoriginalphantom,2011-08-23T19:18Z,"I understand all the crap with cinavia but yall know that companies are gonna try and mess people up with the downloading. Get round it by spending a few pounds on a separate dvd player. That will at least stop your issues until someone gets a way round the cinavia problem. After all you know there will be people working on it as we speak. 
Thanks for the upload UltraTorrents. "
