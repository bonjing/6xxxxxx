Everyday Arguments combines a highly-practical, student-oriented argument rhetoric with an anthology of illustrative readings drawn from everyday life. Part I includes thirteen chapters devoted to the actual demonstration of how to write arguments--ranging from the motives behind writing and the intended audience to effectively supporting and using logic in writing. Part II is devoted to readings that exemplify the kinds of arguments laid out in the first part of the book. Readings are divided into thematic chapters: Today's College Student, The Internet, Sports, Earning Your Living, Diet, and Reading Popular Culture.
