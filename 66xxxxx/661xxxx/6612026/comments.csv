,User897,2011-08-18T04:49Z,"A warning:

Please note that this is by scenebalance, who are notorious for NOT SEEDING their torrents.  What does this mean?  It will either take a ridiculously long time, or, you may never finish downloading it AT ALL.

So, keep that in mind.

Also, this one is RAR'ed and split into two files, which is ridiculous by today's standards and nobody actually prefers them this way anymore."

its better to download NeDivx version, MAXSPEED reduced the sound quality and no improvement compare to NeDivx(5.1 dolby sound)

but i hate RARs"
