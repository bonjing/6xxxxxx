'Kammesjukjul' is a children's Christmas movie made for television. It is basically a portrayal of the odd (in retrospect) childhood experiences which, at the time they occur, hold some mysterious significance. The movie is set at Christmas time, but the Christmas setting is not really important for the appreciation of the movie.
Mads is not going to a Christmas tree party this year because his father's company is way too small for that. Therefore, Mads decides to arrange his own party. He invites some of his friends and his teacher's grandson for the party. Arranging a party is of course not easy for a young boy; it involves theft, intrigues, lying... Do Mads overcome the difficulties, or will there be no Christmas tree party?
