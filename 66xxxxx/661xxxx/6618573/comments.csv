The *scene groups* are gettting lazy these days and releasing this as 2 mp3 tracks was just plain stupid.

Hell they are releasing films now without subs for foreign scene and still conform to stupid resolutions. for dvd rips. all in all this is much appreciated"

@squee666 They most of the times add .cue files, you can split the .MP3 with the .cue file if you have the right software, but still the tags/album stuff arent right most of the times.. But they ripped it so good enough for me :D!"
