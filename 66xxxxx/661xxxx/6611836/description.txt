John Lee Hooker  Bedroom Boogie 
Label: Bootleg?
Format:Mp3@320

John Lee Hooker was the master of the one-chord boogie. Based on raw, pulsing, high-energy rhythm, most of John Lee Hookerâ€™s tunes are reminiscent of early country blues tunes, but with a modern and original twist. Hooker would spin tales and stories about being down, broke, and worn-out over tastefully polyrhythmic guitar riffs that would ebb and flow with intensity along with his stories. 
John Lee Hooker is perhaps one of the most recorded blues artists with sessions over the course of 5 decades. He was still active as a performer at the age of 83 until he died in 2001.
