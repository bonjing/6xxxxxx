Game information:


The world is changing and Tropico is moving with the times - geographical
powers rise and fall and the world market is dominated by new players with
new demands and offers -- and you, as El Presidente, face a whole new set
of challenges. If you are to triumph over your naysayers you will need to
gain as much support from your people as possible. Your decisions will
shape the future of your nation, and more importantly, the size of your
off-shore bank account

Tropico 4 expands on the gameplay of the previous game with new political
additions - including more superpowers to negotiate with, along with the
ability to elect ministers into power to help get your more controversial
policies passed. But remember to keep your friends close and your enemies
closer as everyone has an agenda! Your political mettle will be thoroughly
tested, as new natural disasters will have the populace clamoring for you
and your cabinet to help them recover from some of the worst Mother Nature
can dish out

Tropico 4 also brings a new level of social interaction with the addition
of Facebook and Twitter integration (Windows PC version only). Post
comments on Twitter direct from the game and have updates go out when you
complete missions or unlock new achievements. You can even take screenshots
of your burgeoning island and post your dream creation on your Tropico 4
Facebook page and compare your interactive Dictator Ranking on the online
leaderboards
