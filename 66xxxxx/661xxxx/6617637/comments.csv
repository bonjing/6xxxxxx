You need to follow the instructions. :)

The reason the key the generator is providing is being returned as invalid is because the Tropico4.exe is reporting your invalid key to Kalypso's servers.

Block Tropico4.exe in the directory the game was installed to using a software firewall (such as Comodo Firewall) or unplug your LAN cable when entering the key.

There is also a launcher now someone created, but I'd recommend against it as if you follow these instructions it'll work and it's less hassle to do it this way (not to mention, the right way)."

Anyone know what to do now?"
