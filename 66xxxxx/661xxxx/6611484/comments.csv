I do have a request, I'm not sure if it is reasonable or not but it is Ghost Rider #2 from the newest series. It is seriously the only comic I can not find. I have journeyed the interwebs front and back for it and have had no success but maybe you guys might have better luck. If not it's ok, I still thank you guys for the work you do.  "
