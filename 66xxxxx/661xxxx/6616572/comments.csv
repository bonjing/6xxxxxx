Thanks man, for this and all your torrents.

Don't know how you manage to find some of the rare ones, so thanks for that and for re-awakening my almost forgotten interest in the Blues. :)"

Does the CD you have play on your computer?   If so, then use an audio CD ripper (download one from PirateBay) and rip the CD to your hard drive.   Then, if necessary, use an audio conversion software (I use TotalAudioConverter) and convert the ripped tracks over to mp3.   Then burn the mp3 tracks to a blank CD.   I think that should work.
   Totally baffled my end as to why an original CD won't play for you. "

[V],nightissuchproximity,2011-09-13T17:18Z,"Have you tried a straightforward copy with CloneCD?   Might be worth a shot.
   You'd be better off going over to suprbay and getting some advice from some of the computer geniuses that frequent the place.   There're some real knowledgeable persons there that can probably help you better than I can.   I'm not really all that computer savvy.
   Sorry.


Regards and good luck, nightissuchproximity."
