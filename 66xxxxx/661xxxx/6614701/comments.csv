,saifssj6,2011-08-19T10:26Z,What the no comments?....does this work?
,zola2000,2011-08-19T12:09Z,"if not work the most people wright a comment

if work the most people play the game and not comment.

i mean this is the game of the year 2011 (or skyrim or zelda or uncharted3), so go and buy this game!"
,Dark_Emperor,2011-08-19T12:32Z,I'm downloading now to check it out. If it's legitimate then there's something good to be said about how fast Nextnomura works.
,saifssj6,2011-08-19T13:44Z,@dark_emperor:dude see if this game hasdifferent languages or not
,Axmann,2011-08-20T10:36Z,"So, just to be clear, what kind of media do you have to use to burn this?"
,CrysMM,2011-08-20T11:07Z,"Work great on soft moded Wii. I use a USB memory stick. 

Many thanks to: nextnomura"
,chiriiii12,2011-08-20T12:01Z,"thx for uploading, download worked fine....WHY is this Wii game so big in size???? what dvd I need to burn it cause the size is 6gb ...please help"
,saifssj6,2011-08-20T12:13Z,thanx in advance nextnomura...and to every body plz seed
,Mummraah,2011-08-20T12:50Z,"Only played the first 10 minutes but seems to work perfectly on a softmodded wii 4.2e using USBloader GX.

On a side note the English voice acting is cringe-worthy but you can change it to Japanese and get English Subs."
,ramboryan,2011-08-20T18:24Z,"Didnt even know about this but man it looks like a badass game downloading now thanks in advance nextnomura

@chiriiii12

You will need a duel layer disk to burn it."
,chiriiii12,2011-08-20T20:12Z,"@rambo

thanks a lot for the advice! enjoy the game, you will love it"
,Dark_Emperor,2011-08-21T03:40Z,"Fantastic! this game works without a problem on my Wii. The start screen is loaded and the music is playing and there are virtually no screen tears (those tiny black pixels).

I am running on a NTSC Wii that has system menu 4.1. uLoader is used to run it, and the game is on a USB drive that's been formatted to be WBFS. I didn't have to change the region settings (because uLoader does it automatically) and this is a great rip. Thank you Nextnomura! I'll be seeding."
,lackadaisical,2011-08-21T04:49Z,"i'm using this with a softmodded NTSC-U wii via configurable USB loader. it plays, but for some reason everything is in black and white. is anyone else experiencing this?"
,ramboryan,2011-08-21T05:53Z,"@chiriiii12
No probs :)

@lackadaisical
Try going into settings and forcing ntsc, or get wiiflow here http://www.wiiflow.org/ never had problems with that :P"
,Dylan19,2011-08-21T06:26Z,Getting really slow download speeds! Everyone seed! I'll seed this for a while once it finally finishes but I'm really looking forward to this finishing and at this rate it's going to be a while!
,SpitvenoM,2011-08-21T07:20Z,Great game
,blackadder100,2011-08-21T12:38Z,"Looking forward to this, but download speed is sooo slow.  Please seed!  Will try with USB Loader."
,jaaprx,2011-08-21T14:49Z,Downloading sloooooooooooowly...
,Oranjestr,2011-08-21T15:27Z,"Works good... but I have a problem. The game looks like total and utter crap for some reason. Characters/objects in the distance just aren't visible almost because everything is totally pixelated/jagged. I don't think it's supposed to be like this and I've never seen a Wii game looking this bad despite everyone saying otherwise.

Some tips on this...? I am playing this with CFG on my softmodded Wii."
,mondo,2011-08-21T18:22Z,"Anyone that have tried burning the game on a DL-dvd and played it using a PAL-Wii with Wiikey 1 chip?
I hardly ever use my Wii but this game seems to be a game that I would like to play, but I doesn´t have a USB-disc to install a softmod on, so I would like to know if it works to burn it on a DL-disc and if it plays fine on a Wiikey 1 machine."
,fear_bot,2011-08-21T21:03Z,"Slowly downloading, but will seed after finished for as long as I am able to."
,TacoSteve,2011-08-21T21:33Z,"Slowly creeping along, with an avg DL speed of 97kpbs. Soon as it finishes I'll seed with my max speed, because I'm not stingy like some, and hope others do the same to get this ball rolling."
,jerodar,2011-08-21T22:15Z,"I had a freeze a few seconds into the cinematic after your first encounter with the second faced mechon. This seems to be an error in the ISO, but I'm not 100% sure. Anyone else encountered this?"
,Chunk266,2011-08-21T23:35Z,"THANK YOU. 6 hours in without a hitch, brilliant game. On a PAL 4.3 softmodded wii(no chips) with a formatted 8gb WBFS USB. Just enough to hold this game xD. This is the best game out this month so far really, until Deus Ex comes out. "
,fear_bot,2011-08-22T01:03Z,"Just a few minutes away from finishing the download, going to go max upspeed when finished."
,fear_bot,2011-08-22T01:58Z,Finished and going max upspeed.
,Chunk266,2011-08-22T02:35Z,@jerodar are you playing on a softmodded or chipped wii? What region?
,jerodar,2011-08-22T02:52Z,Softmodded 4.3e wii using a usb HDD with wiiflow.
,fear_bot,2011-08-22T04:19Z,Works perfectly on 4.2u with CFG usb loader.
,jerodar,2011-08-22T16:07Z,"Same problem with an alternative ISO, so I guess it's something in my settings messing things up : /"
,tooby77,2011-08-22T18:18Z,Works perfect.. Played 5h now.. softmodded 4.3e with wiiflow
,fear_bot,2011-08-22T23:59Z,"@helluk123

Program must suck if you have to advertise it on a pirate site."
,blackadder100,2011-08-23T00:48Z,"Awesome game - using usb loader. Will seed, but stuck on 1st big boss (metal face)!"
,drex906,2011-08-23T01:27Z,"iso is broken once you get to the cut scene after the second face mech dont waste your time with this torrent

i cant find any torrent that doesnt have this problem for this game hopefully a good one will be released soon"
,fear_bot,2011-08-23T07:03Z,"@drex906

Game works fine for me. How are you trying to load the game?"
,drex906,2011-08-23T07:41Z,"@fear_bot

i am using usb loader gx and i dnt get y it freezes at that point been playing like 6 hrs and now it crashes with all isos ive downloaded i used mauifrogs modding guide at wiihacks 3 weeks ago so everything is up to date i believe"
,fear_bot,2011-08-23T10:34Z,"@drex906

I've always had problems with games loading with Usb loader GX, it's the reason I switched to CFG usb loader. Maybe try that and see if it helps?"
,Chunk266,2011-08-23T17:12Z,@fear_bot have you gotten past the second faced Mechon?
,Chunk266,2011-08-23T20:08Z,"Got past the cinematic where they first show the 2nd faced Mechon eating that corpse(very light spoiler, dw). No freezing here. I'm using CFG usbloader btw, that's probably the reason."
,mondo,2011-08-23T21:46Z,"I´ll ask again since my question is on the first page of the comments so noone will probably read it.

Anyone that have tried burning the game on a DL-dvd and played it using a PAL-Wii with Wiikey 1 chip?

,joemesh,2011-08-23T22:22Z,"Chunk266, can you list all the details of your version of CFG usb loader? I'm using it and I'm getting the freeze during that cutscene."
,fear_bot,2011-08-24T00:51Z,"@joemesh

I have mine working on CFG, see if this helps any:
Loader Version: 70
CFG base: sd:/usb-loader
FS: [ sd: ntfs: ]
IOS249 (r20)
Base: IOS57 rev20 mload v1.0"
,siittari,2011-08-24T08:18Z,hi. i had the exact same issue with freezing. i solved it by using ntfs instead of fat32.
,Zeptinune,2011-08-24T22:58Z,"P.S. This doesn't work on NTSC lol, few of my friends tried.. it doesn't load. Either boots back to Wii menu or just black screens forever. You can't 'frii' this disc to NTSC lol. Games only 'Frii' to PAL, not the other way around."
,joemesh,2011-08-25T00:43Z,Yes! Thank you siittari! That worked!
,fear_bot,2011-08-25T01:51Z,"@Zeptinune

You can play it on NTSC, but it depends on if you're using hardmods or softmods.

There's a way to force it to NTSC on both options."
,Chunk266,2011-08-25T02:53Z,"Any Wii console & game region combinations will work if you know what your doing. Sorry for being a bit late, was having too much fun with the game =p. I'm using a WBFS formatted usb, all my settings and stuff are exactly the same as when I first got them from mauifrog's guide on wiihacks."
,Yoni__,2011-08-26T13:46Z,does this run well with Dolohin?
,tooby77,2011-08-26T22:28Z,"Played around 13h now.. Still nothing are failing.. About first ""boss"" u need to be pretty high lv than u first enter cave or have major gear :)"
,305gamerz,2011-08-27T20:03Z,You guys want a smaller size of this game intact??? English Voices and English Subtitles To fit on DVD 5 Format :) I dont know why piratebay won't let me upload it but here is my link. http://www.kat.ph/xenoblade-chronicles-pal-dvd5-4-5gb-iso-t5775046.html -Have fun and enjoy bitches! !!!Remember to rate & Comment!!! 
,uzirapist,2011-08-28T04:39Z,does this game work? english sub ? english voice acting or japanese either perfered
,Imok86,2011-08-28T19:20Z,"playing now for like 20h (long, long after 2nd faced-mechon fight), using Wii 4.2E Softmodded, usb loader gx, newest d2x cIOS, 500GB wbfs Harddrive. No problems at all, no freezes, nothing. 
It's a pretty good game, nice graphics and fun to play. 
And now the stupid questions: This game is PAL, of course it has english subs! and yes even english voices, you can even choose between rather you want english or original japanese voices. But the translation is really really bad..."
,uzirapist,2011-08-29T01:03Z,hahaha dont get how its a stupid question but who gives a fuck when i can play this game right now
,88Titan88,2011-09-01T19:54Z,Works like a charm on USB Loader GX.
