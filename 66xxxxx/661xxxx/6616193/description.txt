    Earthmen are suddenly stricken with a mysterious disease, which          
    causes instant death and leaves a purple spot on the forehead of each    
    victim. Investigating, Dr. Zarkov discovers a spaceship from Ming's      
    kingdom on Mongo spreading a dust across Earth's atmosphere, which       
    Zarkov correctly deduces is causing the plague. Accompanied by Flash     
    Gordon and Dale Arden, Zarkov drives off the ship and hurries to the     
    friendly Mongo kingdom of Arboria, to enlist the aid of Prince Barin.    
    At Barin's palace, they meet Queen Fria and Count Korro of the           
    ice-kingdom Frigia. Helping them rescue a Frigian general from Ming's    
    palace, they learn the nature of Ming's plague-dust and its antidote,    
    found only in Frigia. With Fria's blessings they fly to Frigia to        
    obtain the antidote, accompanied by Arboria captains Ronal, Roka and     
    Turan. But Ming learns this, sends his own officers Torch and Thong      
    to stop them with raygun fire and an army of humanoid robots...
