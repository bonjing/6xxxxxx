Description: 
Simon Armitage presents the extraordinary story of the 
most disturbing witch trial in British history and the key role 
played in it by one nine-year-old girl. Jennet Device, a 
beggar-girl from Pendle in Lancashire, was the star 
witness in the trial in 1612 of her own mother, her brother, 
her sister and many of her neighbours and, thanks to her 
chilling testimony, they were all hanged.Armitage explores 
the lethal power and influence of one child's words - a 
story of fear, magic and demonic pacts retold partly with 
vivid and innovative hand-drawn animation. He discovers 
how Jennet's appearance in the witness box cast its shadow way beyond Lancashire, impressing lawyers, politicians, clerics and even King James I himself, and setting a dark precedent for child testimony in witch trials as far away as America. Finally, in a dramatic twist to the tale, he reveals how, twenty two years after the original trial, Jennet's own words were very nearly the death of her - when she herself was put on trial, accused of being a witch by a 10-year-old boy.
With the help of historians Malcolm Gaskill, Diane Purkiss 
and Ronald Hutton, Armitage attempts to get inside Jennet's 
head and understand how the illegitimate and illiterate 
youngest child of a family of beggars could become both 
pawn and player in a much bigger story of 17th century 
religion, power, law, science and the monarchy.
What made Jennet speak out so everyone she knew 
would die? And how did the courts decide to admit her 
evidence and allow her example to create a precedent 
for accepting the testimony of other child witnesses who 
wanted to send their neighbours to the gallows?
Although the events in this film may date back four 
hundred years, its issues resonate today as much as 
ever - when to believe our children, how the police and 
the court system should handle child witnesses and 
above all how, in times of crisis, fear of evil can easily 
lead us to behave in ways which may corrode the very 
values that we most wish to protect.
