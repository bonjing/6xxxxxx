When I open the disc I have four folders (data, documentation, languages and speech) but I have no clue what I should do now!!! I can't seem to play/hear anything. Please help me. Thank you"

you need to install the main program ROSETTA STONE with crark, but do not update or register it (never), then use POWERISO to mount the language pack (don't need to burn them, cause they may not work right when burn), and open the main program Rosetta Stone to ADD these language pack.
All these programs memtion above are on TPB, search for them I don't know how to include link to them, can't not help more, sorry."
