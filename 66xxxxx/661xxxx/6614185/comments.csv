It seems like they have been been compressed to a shorter run time, which has caused the pitch of the audio to be shifted noticeably. Take episode one for example, I have the TV rip and it's run-time is 21:43, while episode one from this torrent is 21:00.  Maybe you won't even notice the difference in audio, but it's worth noting.  Also, at least half of the episodes aren't uncensored."

So I checked the videos and probably there's some audio delay, bearable noticeable, probably more when there's some codec issues or on some video players, I admit, but I assure these are all personal dvdrips i made from real DVDs, maybe not all might be uncensored but that's how they were released."
,crdeath27,2012-03-23T15:05Z,"I didn't notice if there was any audio delay, but then again it's not nearly as noticeable with animation as it would be with live action.  As for the censored/uncensored episodes, the American Dad DVDs (and some of the FG DVDs) have two separate tracks on the disc, one censored and one uncensored, and it's very easy to rip one instead of the others, I've done that myself.  I'm guessing that's what happened with a few of the episodes on this rip.  I'm not sure how the episodes got compressed though, perhaps there is a setting somewhere in the software you used that compresses the episodes to a specific time?  Like I said though, some people might not even notice the slightly higher pitch of the sound.  And kudos for including the deleted scenes and bonus stuff, it's very rare for those to be included even on DVD rips."
