Product Description: After years spent traveling and sampling sweets throughout her native Mexico, celebrated pastry chef Fany Gerson shares the secrets behind her beloved homelandâ€™s signature desserts in this highly personal and authoritative cookbook. Skillfully weaving together the rich histories that inform the countryâ€™s diverse culinary traditions, My Sweet Mexico is a delicious journey into the soul of the cuisine.

From yeasted breads that scent the air with cinnamon, anise, sugar, fruit, and honey, to pushcarts that brighten plazas with paletas and ice creams made from watermelon, mango, and avocado, Mexican confections are like no other.

Stalwarts like Churros, Amaranth Alegrias, and Garibaldisâ€”a type of buttery muffin with apricot jam and sprinklesâ€”as well as Passion Fruitâ€“Mezcal Trifle and Cheesecake with Tamarind Sauce demonstrate the layering of flavors unique to the world of dulces. In her typical warm and enthusiastic style, Gerson explains the significance of indigenous ingredients such as sweet maguey plants, mesquite, honeys, fruits, and cacao, and the happy results that occur when combined with Spanish troves of cinnamon, wheat, fresh cowâ€™s milk, nuts, and sugar cane.

In chapters devoted to breads and pastries, candies and confections, frozen treats, beverages, and contemporary desserts, Fany places cherished recipes in context and stays true to the roots that shaped each treat, while ensuring theyâ€™ll yield successful results in your kitchen. With its blend of beloved standards from across Mexico and inventive, flavor-forward new twists, My Sweet Mexico is the only guide you need to explore the delightful universe of Mexican treats.
