NBA Rules History (XII):
------------------------

Take a look back at some of the rules changes that have taken place over the years.
(Changes/clarifications implemented prior to season, except where noted) 
-------
1974-75
-------
- Fine increased from $50 to $100 for a player or coach ejected after being charged with a technical foul for unsportsmanlike conduct.
- A timeout request made at the instant time expires for a period shall not be granted and the period ends.
- In the last two minutes of the game or overtime, no timeouts are allowed once the ball is inbounded until the ball is in the frontcourt.
- The â€œforce outâ€ rule is clarified as incidental contact near a boundary line, which causes a player to commit a violation or go out of bounds, and neither team is responsible for the action. The offensive team retains possession.
- When there are punching fouls on both teams during the same play, the team last offended is awarded possession.
