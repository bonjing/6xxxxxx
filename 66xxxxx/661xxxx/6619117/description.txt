The Jive Bunny Phenomenon began in the summer of 1989, when â€œSwing The Moodâ€ rocketed to number 1 in the UK spending 5 weeks at the top of the chart. It also number 11 in the US Billboard Hot 100! Two more number 1s followed â€œThat's What I Likeâ€ and â€œLet's Partyâ€. This revamped, extended and remastered best selling album, features those three number 1 hits and countless more top 30 hits and party mixes for all the family.
