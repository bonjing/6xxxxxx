http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6407159/Se7en_1995_Multisub_1080p.BluRay.DTS.x264-HDLiTE_

you get so impressed! The quality of the above is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! I did a rough count of how many movies I have downloaded the past 5 years, resulting in about 3000. In NO OTHER movie torrent have I experienced as high a quality, as the above!

Picture is priority A1 in movies. Sound you can always copy from other releases if you want higher Q, and subs are easy to manipulate to fit (or even translate/transcribe yourself). 

If the number of seeders is a token of how great a ripper you are, and if highest seeder is the winner in a kind of unofficial competition, you would most likely be among the top 3, both regarding smaller, and larger (along with Wiki) releases. In the WORLD!!!

Please..?"

,nyder,2011-08-21T04:55Z,"Not sure i understand.  Almost all releases eventually get a 1080p release of it also.

Might have to wait till the bluray is actually released before you get a 1080p copy of it though.
