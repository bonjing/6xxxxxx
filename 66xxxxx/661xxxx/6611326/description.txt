Dangers of the Deep
The Deep 2; Exploring Inners Space
What do we know about our own oceans that cover over 70% of our planets surface?
Humans have explored much of the solar system, carried out studies to assess the possibility for life on Mars yet little is known about our own oceans that cover over 70% of our planets surface. If we were to drain the seas what would we find, and what would it take to explore the abyss a place with no light, temperatures at near zero and pressure a thousand times greater than the surface. Only two people have ever visited the bottom of the oceans less than have walked on the moon. Were on a journey to the bottom of some of the deepest oceans. Investigating the technologies and vistas that could, one day, open-up an entirely new world. What are the challenges that face us in a quest to explore the ocean floor?
