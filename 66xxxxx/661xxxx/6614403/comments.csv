I'm uploading now for over a year, all clean torrents.
Good commets on them too."
[T],h4ck3r2012,2011-08-19T05:29Z,"To get your skull, you have to request it on suprbay.
go to forum, i.e. forum.suprbay.org, and then go to help with tpb, and add me trusted, request there."
[T],djjlicious,2011-08-19T05:41Z,OK
[T],djjlicious,2011-08-19T05:43Z,"Thanks, I was allready on suprbay, and Anacondaz had me made trusted, but I have to do it myself.
Gonna give it a try!"
,Kenny00000,2011-08-19T06:34Z,Why share freeware that you can download directly from www.ccleaner.com ?
,KingWozzer,2011-08-19T08:04Z,"Great Job
@kenny So you cant understand the convenience of people making the effort to make everything available in one place...did I get that right mate?"
,ticolino,2011-08-19T12:52Z,Is FREEWARE !!!
,Kenny00000,2011-08-19T18:12Z,"Problem is that many things like software shareware and freeware seeded on TPB have ""added extras"" like trojans, viruses etc etc and that is not checked and secured on TPB

Better then to download shareware and freeware from original sites and homepages."
[T],h4ck3r2012,2011-08-20T09:53Z,"This is thepiratebay, which allow users to upload anything, but infection free, anyone can upload anything, our mission is to provide everything at the same place, after all, i am a trusted, and if you trust on me, then download, and if not, dont download, its simple."
