Bay Area favorites, critical darlings, and great songwriters Blame Sally hit new highs with Speeding Ticket And A Valentine. Warm, witty, melodic, filled with depth â€“ an apt description of the music on the new album but also the four women who make up the band. In the studio or live, their music and vibe are compelling and infectious.
