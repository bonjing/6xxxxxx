Seventeen Days is the third studio album by American rock group 3 Doors Down, released on February 8, 2005, five years to the day that 3 Doors Down released their debut album, The Better Life. It is 3 Doors Down's first album in the three years since 2002's Away from the Sun. It topped the chart on the Billboard 200 soon after it was released. Bob Seger sings a duet with lead singer, Brad Arnold, on the song "Landing in London". It is 3 Doors Down's heaviest album to date due to richer guitar riffs and beefier drums, along with gloomier lyrics than the band's previous efforts.
