Information:

These installers are for games that I have uploaded. These work for any games that require DirectX and/or VC80_Redist. This was uploaded for any errors when playing games such as Dragon Age 2, Mafia II, and so on. So, this doesn't fix all errors! Any other errors that you may encounter, please post a comment, I will be sure to answer it. Not meant for everyone. I only recommend this torrent to people missing these files. Since my uploaded games are Direct-Play.
