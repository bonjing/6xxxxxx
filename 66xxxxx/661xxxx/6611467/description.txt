Amazon Review:
This fourth album from the New York's Blues Traveler finally brought their harmonica-based blues riffs into the public eye. Indeed, "Run-Around" spent nearly a year on the Billboard singles chart. Harpman/vocalist John Popper moves easily between uptempo, rock-based tracks like "Stand" and "Crash Burn." The hidden gem here, however, is the love-struck ballad "Just Wait." Often categorized with post-Dead jam acts such as Phish, BT isn't immune from performance excesses. But when it comes to recording, they keep it (mostly) concise and always interesting. If you've heard the name and want to know what all the hoopla is about, Four is a great starting point.

Allmusic Review:
Lacking the rootsier edge of Save His Soul, Four finds Blues Traveler retreating to their standard blues-boogie formula, with mixed results. Of course, there are some fine songs here -- including their breakthrough hit single, "Run-Around" -- but too often the band sounds like it's coasting. Four is a solid record, but it shows signs that the band's formula may be wearing thin.
