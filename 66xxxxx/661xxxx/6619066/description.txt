Got To Find A Way inadvertently makes a bold statement for the Grammy-winning, Chicago bluesman, Luther "Guitar Junior" Johnson: Simply, he's one of the finest electric blues guitar players on the scene today.

Johnson has played alongside such notable bluesmen as Muddy Waters and Buddy Guy. His signature sound has been compared to fellow West Side Chicago players like Otis Rush and Magic Sam. Johnson's enigmatic style incorporates beefy rhythm parts and graceful guitar leads with just one instrument. On this eleven track disc, Johnson-penned songs such as "On Your Way Fishin'," and "Just Like Mama Said," as well as an excellent version of Luther Allison's "Luther's Blues," show just how powerful Johnson's influence has been on Eric Clapton.
