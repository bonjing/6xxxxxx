NOTE - a sympathethic but still fairly accurate biographic drama of the first great leader of the English Protestant Reformation. Speaking personally as a non-Christian, historian, and lover of quality acting and good cinema, this was both a fine and fun film. Don't let the religious overtones turn you off here, this is a quality presentation of a great mind struggling agaisnt those that would silence him. This is worth your time, even if you do not sahre his convictions. 

Additionally, I am including the 3rd episode of the 2003 BBC series ADVENTURE OF ENGLISH, which chroniles the importance of this translation and further details Wycliffe. I hope to have another torrent soon on the life of William Tynedale, who finally produced the version of the Bible in English that the authorities could not stop, and served as the basis for the King James and NIV.

John Wycliffe (c. 1328 - December 31, 1384), also known as Wycliffe John, was an English Scholastic philosopher, theologian, lay preacher, translator, reformer and university teacher who was known as an early dissident in the Roman Catholic Church during the 14th century. His followers were known as Lollards, a somewhat rebellious movement, which preached anticlerical and biblically-centred reforms. The Lollard movement, was a precursor to the Protestant Reformation (for this reason,Wycliffe is sometimes called "The Morning Star of the Reformation"). He was one of the earliest opponents of papal authority influencing secular power.
Wycliffe was also an early advocate for translation of the Bible into the common language. He completed his translation directly from the Vulgate into vernacular English in the year 1382, now known as Wycliffe's Bible. It is probable that he personally translated the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; and it is possible he translated the entire New Testament, while his associates translated the Old Testament. Wycliffe's Bible appears to have been completed by 1384, with additional updated versions being done by Wycliffe's assistant John Purvey and others in 1388 and 1395.
