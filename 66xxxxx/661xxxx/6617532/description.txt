Tragedy strikes, one wrestler rolls an ankle. She manages to finish out the round but the ankle is too injured to continue. One wrestler gets the win and goes on to the Championship match up. One wrestler goes home, their season over in disappointment and frustration.

The ankle is OK to get fucked on. So not only does she have to forfeit the rest of the match, but then she gets the shit fucked out of her. Talk about piling on, when it rains it pours. Ultimate Surrender is real non-scripted wrestling site, you never know how a situation will turn out...
