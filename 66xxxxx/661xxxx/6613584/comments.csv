,cdrk,2011-08-19T11:41Z,"Hey mate, 

I've been enjoying your keys.
I had to reinstall windows 7 and am trying to install it again. Where should I download the Avira app. I downloaded the trial and tried your keys but it didn't work."

Its always good to download offline installer so that it may help u when you reinstall ur windows..
Remember These keys are VALID ONLY FOR Avira Premium Security Suite 10, NOT Avira Antivir or any Older Version.."
,cdrk,2011-08-20T01:39Z,"After uninstalling mine i did what you told and reinstalled the .zip version. Used (my) trial key and then when I want to use one of yours it gives me the message: ""The license selected is invalid and will not be installed. Not sure what I am doing wrong here. "
,Ghayyurious,2011-08-20T13:18Z,"@cdrk
I don't Know Why These keys aren't working for u..
I think tht that the keys got corrupted..
Download This Torrent Again(On ur desktop) and And try Installing These Keys Again...
Hope It Helps..
I by myself Downloaded Avira Setup(4rm Above Link) and The Keys Are Working Fine..
And Yea Make Sure you Are using the Right Folder For Selecting Key..

Thank you!
I had copied the folder to my desktop and tried to get it from there. Redownloaded your torrent and tried to license it from the original folder. Worked!

,flightc,2011-09-14T15:56Z,"After installing the program and using one of the keys in the torrent, I try to then update the program and I instantly get an Application Error message stating ""The instruction at 0x8787657 referenced memory at 0x0000000. The memory could not be read.""  Everytime I try to update it does this.  No other program crashes like this for me and I've tried a reboot and still the same.  What's the deal?"
,flightc,2011-09-18T00:29Z,"I'm guessing no one has an answer?   I've even uninstalled it, reinstalled and used a different key and it still WILL NOT update.  ?!?!?!"

,woody_76,2012-03-29T15:18Z,"@ Ghayyurious knob head wanna be scener, failure written all over u fella, u try an run with the big boys an u fail miserably, get a life kid,"
,Ghayyurious,2012-03-30T16:39Z,"So u r tryin' to prove ur self mature.?
huh! u did handle the argument maturely!!
i don't got all day arguing with a kid who his proving himself to be a Man..
I might be in Nappies when u were in this GAME but wat u learned is Worthless..
Ok, put this argument aside.
I don't wanna yell at someone without a purpose.
First ov all u started this shit and later on calmed down.Proves tht u felt wrong abt wat u said.
Later on the shit i wrote is bcz i ws outraged..
U think i'm doin' this stuff jst for a skull? Bitch Please!
Why i upload is jst to help ppl cz a handful of uploaders upload Avira Keys and only a few r worth it.
This key EXPIRED on 28th Feb 2012. So i posted a link to my NEW torrent tht expires on Sep 2013.
Now think abt what u said in ur 1st comment. Yes the link was dead end but i'm not getting paid to post a new link everyday.
And plz don't strt the Slang shit again cz i don't wanna prove my self offensive to others."
