This footage was secretly taken from GamesCom in Germany, August 2011.

It shows the map "Caspian Border"

It doesn't show much combat but it shows the scale of the map, it shows destruction, flying the Super Cobra helicopter and a few other things.

Enjoy!


P.S. This is a completely legit vid but I am uploading it as anonymous for the simple reason that I wouldn't want EA to find out and ban me from playing Battlefield 3 when it comes out as I'm so psyched for the game.
