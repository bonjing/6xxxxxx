Product description: 



Dolby Digital Live or DTS Connect enables you to enjoy audio from your PC or game console through your home theater. It encodes (in real-time) the PC's multi-channel audio into a Dolby Digital or DTS bitstream and outputs it from the soundcard's digital out (S/PDIF), via a single digital cable into home theater receiver system. Stereo content (MP3, WMA, CD audio or games) that is transformed into 5.1 surround sound using Creative CMSS-3D or DTS Neo:PC can also benefit from this encoding scheme that will further enhance the entertainment value of your Sound Blaster X-Fi. With Dolby Digital Live or DTS Connect, the confusion of multiple cables will be eliminated and the integrity of the audio signal will be kept pristine.

The real-time interactive capabilities of these encoding technologies (Dolby Digital Live and DTS Connect) are ideally suited to PCs and video game consoles because they reproduce audio cues and effects that follow the on-screen action, transforming gameplay into an exciting and realistic entertainment experience.

Systems using Dolby Digital Live or DTS Connect technology can provide Dolby Digital or DTS (5.1-channel surround sound) during gameplay, immersing players in high-quality surround sound that puts them at the center of the action. Gamers hear every window shatter, feel every explosion, and experience every wipeout.
