Sound: Catalan language. Stereo.

This is the fixed torrent of the first half of the second leg of the spanish supercup 2011. Be patient, my upload speed is quite low. Please help me seeding this as long as you can. This match deserves it. :-)Thanks"
,caprikornius,2011-08-18T03:43Z,"i´ll seed for like a year or more because i agree with you this match deserves it.
On the other hand, whats wrong with the 1st and 2nd half of the second leg? because im still downloading them. Should i stop them and get the fixed ones started?? "
[T],Shepard76,2011-08-18T03:53Z,"caprikornius.  yes you can delete them cause I mixed the files, and realize afterwards of the mess I did. Now I only seed the fixed versions, thanks. "
[T],Shepard76,2011-08-18T03:56Z,"If you are intereseted in even more quality HD take a look at this torrent :
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6612065/FC_Barcelona_vs_Real_Madrid_-_[2011_Spanish_SuperCup__17.08_HD]
Compared to this guy I am a complete noob. 1920 x 1080i :-) I asked him if he have also the first leg."
,caprikornius,2011-08-18T06:42Z,"this link above doesn´t work, takes me to a piratebay message which say NOT FOUND (4O4)."
[T],Shepard76,2011-08-18T11:04Z,"Weird. Maybe he had issues uploading it like me :-) Anyway I'm able to download that torrent, if it works I will re upload it . How is my upload speed ? At which speed are you able to download my torrent ? I think I need to tweak somehow my client. Thanks"
,tawaren,2011-08-18T12:15Z,"Oi, uploader, where are you? There is noone with more then bloody 9.4%. If u are on upload - then stay there until others have 100%, mate. Be cool"
[T],Shepard76,2011-08-18T12:49Z,"tawaren , of course I'll stay there. Hope people stay too and help me to spread it after downloading it. Thanks"
,caprikornius,2011-08-18T16:37Z,"ok shepard, you reuplaod it and let me know, ok?.
As to the speed of this torrent, at first i had 4 or 6 kb/sec, lousy i know. But now im downloading 30 or 40 kb/sec with no seeders, though. once i download it i´ll seed if i´m able to (this last part must be understood as capability not as willingness)"
[T],Shepard76,2011-08-18T19:40Z,"I downloaded that 9 Gb torrent of 1920 x 1080 but its password protected, very weird. It's a pity because that was a better recording than mine. It is difficult to find 1920 x 1080 recordings of Barça matches.  "
,KeyMs92,2011-08-18T21:54Z,"Thanks uploader! For anyone looking for a faster torrent with similar quality (720p) as this one, go to http://torrent.alein.org. You do have to mind the d/u ratio but it's worth it :)

I was also downloading the 9gb torrent but it's indeed fake, as mentioned on several forums. There are quite some versions of this match available but until now I haven't been able to find a working 1080i/p one :("
,kawha,2011-08-19T07:48Z,"I would not advise to download this torrent.  Impossible to open with quicktime, impossible to open with vlc, and with mpc and a bunch of codecs I can hardly read it and however it freezes at the 23rd min."
[T],Shepard76,2011-08-19T20:04Z,You're right kawha . The mp4 format which is the only format my Aver Tv tuner let me chose is not a common or wide known format. I tried to convert it to Divx or something lighter and more compatible but I am noob converting formats and I thought that probably I would ruin the quality somehow so I left it as my Tv tuner recorded it. But I'm agree with you that this format sucks but I always managed to watch it somehow with an alternative player with codecs you can download. This format always worked for me but I don't know why this time VLC don't show it (only audio) maybe I did something wrong. But anyway I managed to watch it. Sorry for that issue. I hope to understand why this happened. Please share your experience watching this mp4 file so I can learn and do it better next time. Thanks.
[T],Shepard76,2011-08-19T20:09Z,"No freezing at minute 23. Try using this player:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mpc-hc/

You're right VLC do not read right this mp4 file but mpc did worked for me."
[T],Shepard76,2011-08-19T20:46Z,"Well I correct myself I reinstalled VLC and VLC works fine too . No freezing whatsoever. So if you have issues reading the file try also videolan:

,KeyMs92,2011-08-19T23:33Z,"ah ic i was wrong sorry :(
This isn't 720p indeed, and comparing the screenshot with the version i mentioned, this one is way better. So unless you want english comments and faster download go for this one. I actually think this is the best version of the interwebz. Well done! Now off to download this one..."
,caprikornius,2011-08-20T07:09Z,"well. VLC works great with me. this is my first experience downloading footbal in 1080p. And i have to say out of honesty that this torrent is a piece of work. 2.54gib totally worths it. You shepard are the man, you keep on doing this work. you keep it up. you´re great!!!!"
,caprikornius,2011-08-21T18:31Z,"hey shepard, can you upload tennis matches. The USA open is next on, for instance. Only the best matches. what do you think??"
[T],Shepard76,2011-08-22T04:00Z,Well I'll try but I have an issue with Spanish Television HD....my tv tuner do not receive the signal very well...but if I can I'll try to upload some matches. 
,caprikornius,2011-08-22T21:15Z,"ok.
are you planning to upload the Europe super cup?
would be awesome!!"
[T],Shepard76,2011-08-23T00:53Z,"Yes, the supercup is this friday and Tv3 HD will broadcast that trophy too. I just uploaded Joan Gamper trophy First Half (F.C Barcelona official presentation to the fans).  "
,caprikornius,2011-08-23T19:21Z,"is that trophy the match that Barca played against Napoly?? i saw the highlight already, too late i guess ."
[T],Shepard76,2011-08-26T11:36Z,Yes Joan Gamper (founder of F.C Barcelona) trophy match was F.C Barcelona Vs Napoli.
