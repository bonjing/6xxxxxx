[S],velvet.,2011-08-19T15:39Z,"Why did you post this as a torrent?

The latest version of the VLC Media Player is freely available straight from the source.

You get it here:  http://www.videolan.org/vlc/"

The current vlc 1.1.11 d/l is failing for a lot of people and can neither be downloaded through the player or on the site, so torrents are often the only way we can get the file"
,killer-X-945,2011-11-11T20:51Z,"thank you for posting this! the hotel im at has such shitty internet that downloads just time out. but if i download with a torrent then it completes. 

@velvet i would like it more people posted things like this, its very useful"
