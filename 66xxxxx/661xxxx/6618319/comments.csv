In the same league as aXXo EZ is not, and with quality like this, probably never will be... this is just a typical EZ torrent.

Quote from EZ: ""i don't have time/no need for 1 file maxi thing""... this sums up his attitude quite nicely... dont give the people what they want, give them what *I* think they should get and if they dont like this, fuck 'em."

,dlarrym1111,2011-09-14T08:25Z,"@USAhater: Thats a good boy. . . let it all out. . 

Come over the THE DARK SIDE YOUNG SKY WALKER. YOUR OWN THOUGHTS BETRAY YOU!!!!!! Seriously though, As history tells, hatred brings so much joy to the planet (obviously sarcastic). Keep on following in the foot steps of wonderful people like Adolf Hitler and lets not forget his BUTT BUDDY: Heinrich Himmler, organizer of the concentration camps and a superstitious freak believing all the crap that the Vril-Society had to offer. 
Just go on and give a ""fat, obese, American"" a big old Yankee Doodle HUG. . . NOW doesn't that feel better. Now take your mouth off your mothers tit and wipe the milk off your face and GROW THE FUCK UP!!!

And  @MailerDaemon0:
Your definitely entitled to your own point of view and thats all good, but you are acting at best like a spoiled brat and at the least an ingrate. This site is about sharing what one has to share. SORRY that some of the things shared here aren't up to your standards. If you can find a better FREE copy, go for it. In fact why don't you show  and the rest of the uploaders how to do things right. Set your free time aside to give freely of your own self. . . . Oh thats right, your WAY too self centered and a selfish ASS WIPE to do any thing cool like that.

@smartmexi: 
No doubt this was done with the sole purpose of pissing off ingrates like !

( FYI: To anyone this may concern - NO UPLOADER OWES ANY EXPLANATION TO ANYONE FOR WHY A FILE WAS TREATED THIS WAY OR THAT WAY, ESPECIALLY )

If this  person is such a perfectionist, go buy the damn thing, and shut the fuck up.
NO ONE CARES what you think!!!! Do you not understand that?? Your likes or dislikes will not and do not govern ANYTHING here at ALL!! WHO do you think you are??? actually, scrap that, I don't care who you think you are or who you really are for that matter!

Lastly, Thanks again ! and DEATH to all ingrates!!!! "
,cjimbo1,2011-09-14T22:09Z,"@dlarrym1111

you make me wish TPB had a ""like"" button"
,dlarrym1111,2011-09-14T22:11Z,"@USAhater: 
You need a reality check! - You do not govern how long a comment is, what can or can't be written in a comment nor do you have any say about who makes a comment. 
Another observation that is so Ironic that you hate America so much.  America's is one of a minority of countries that would actually defend your right to say what ever you want, to whom ever you want, even the President, a policeman, or any other government official. This belief of ones freedom of speech in America is so intense, that it is even written into LAW!
FYI-Not all countries are so tolerant of people like yourself. (and I use the label of ""people"" loosely. I for one, can't be sure what horrid cesspool you crawled out of. Your lack of intellect suggests you share more DNA with a SLUG than homo-sapiens)
The best example of this intolerance would be if you grew up in the middle east. Depending on where and how long ago, that kind of shit talking could get your tongue hacked out of your mouth or at the least you could very likely lose a finger. (To be fair, you don't find nearly as much of that kind of ghastly punishments in the middle east in this day and age but I hope you get my point.) Having said that, I guess even you would shut up if the consequences of that kind of talk could result in getting your body parts chopped off, after all, without your fingers or your tongue your parents would be very disappointed. No more STINKY PINKY for your mother or licking on your dads cock. . you know how he loves your KNOB JOBS. .  LOL)
I need to stop that talk, I def. don't want to stoop down to your level of blind hate and total ignorance, so I'll leave things at that.

Just one other thing. You have made it very clear how you hate the US, (and you are certainly not alone in that feeling.) The FACT that many people don't like America is OLD NEWS. If the future, if your determined to go off on a RANT, at least come up with something we ALL haven't heard a thousand times before from some other loser.  Hell, to be honest, I don't know of any country that is completely free of being hated by some group of people, but, that is just academic. It's one of the sadder part of the human condition. 
The other question that BEGS to be asked is WHAT country of ""Paradise"" and ""Total perfection"" do you hail from?
Where on this planet, in your opinion, is the BEST place if America is the worst?

Again, great upload EZ! people like yourself that give to others so freely is a rare commodity in this day and age. Keep on Keeping on!"
,dlarrym1111,2011-09-15T01:56Z,"@USAhater: OK...Let me show you how to rip ass on AMERICA. You are not even in the same league, I can HATE ten times better then you read this if you dare:
The US:  Though accounting for only 5 percent of the worldâ€™s population, Americans consume 26 percent of the worldâ€™s energy. (American Almanac), and we are the worldâ€™s largest single emitter of carbon dioxide, accounting for 23 percent of energy-related carbon emissions worldwide. (U.S. Department of Energy). This, while worldwide, some 2 billion people are currently without electricity. (U.S. Department of Energy). The good news is that among industrialized and developing countries, Canada consumes per capita the most energy in the world, and the United Sates is only second. Italy consumes the least among industrialized countries (thatâ€™s because they still drive Fiats, which â€œconserveâ€ energy by breaking every other day). 
NOW THATS how to RIP on the US. Notice I even included my sources and I didn't use even ONE curse word. YOU, USAhater are such an amateur. A simple drain clog by comparison.

Thanks again for the upload EZ. great work."
,OOwillybubbaOO,2011-09-15T02:46Z,"I would be willing to bet a months salary he's british... You can tell because how sour he is because he's stuck on a shitty, tiny island, and we got the big one. Also the resentment is so strong, they changed their language to sound as stupid as it does today after we parted from them. Think about it... We say it how its spelled... Their shit just makes no sense... Ello? Why wouldn't it be spelled the way they say it? Because of their sourness!!!!"
,Sainten1,2011-09-15T14:55Z,"@dlarrym1111

You sir are so the man.

@ USAhater 

You definitely need to be compendious in your retorts. Your initial comment was a hard read. It was filled with too many words leading to the same conclusion. Maybe if you cut it down a line or two people will listen to your amazing and thought provocative ideas. "
,baz917,2011-09-15T17:20Z,"@ usahater. I feel sorry for you that you struggle to express yourself in a dignified manner, however much you may detest a nation. But you are free to have the right to communicate in part because of the very nation you insult.

@ willybubba. Are you not as guilty as others who stereotype a nation. By the virtue of determining that he/she is from GB for the insulting reasons you have given you are sitting on the same level. That ""shitty tiny island"" is home to many different cultures and whilst it is not without it's problems it has pride and character and a history worth defending.

I am just glad that the men and women serving  from many different nations for many different reasons do not suffer the same anger towards each other or we may not have defeated our enemies or saved the lives of others TOGETHER.

Whilst banter is a positive attribute to any conversation, what we have here is just plain unecessary and unfortunately it gets fuelled by retaliation. I hope I speak on behalf of the majority of visitors here when I say, please refrain from abusing one another, that can be done on other sites. Here we would like to just read comments on the quality of the downloads. I would not have even said anything on the matter if the same message was not on so many comment walls. Please enjoy the downloads you get.  great download ex...keep up the good work"

Hey, I hear 50 Cent is going to come out with a new clothing line, better be the first to buy it!

I even liked the twist with what happened to her in Morocco. (can't say anything else without spoiling it for others)
