Sucker Punch is the soundtrack for the film of the same name. It was released on March 22,
2011 by WaterTower Music. The album consists of covered songs, mainly by the film's stars.
Emily Browning sings three songs, and Carla Gugino and Oscar Isaac performs a cover of
"Love Is the Drug" as a duet. Recording artists Bjork, Skunk Anansie, EmilÃ­ana Torrini,
Queen, Carla Azar, Alison Mosshart and Yoav also have songs on the soundtrack.

All of the covers on the album were produced by Marius de Vries and Tyler Bates, who
utilized orchestral and rock sounds. Director Zack Snyder wanted the songs to add depth,
dimension and meaning to the fantasy aspects of the film. The recording sessions began in
September 2009. Part of Browning's audition for her role in the film included recording herself
while singing. Snyder liked her voice and offered her to sing The Smiths' song "Asleep". The
crew and Smiths' frontman Morrissey were happy with the result, and Browning recorded two
more songs for the soundtrack, including "Sweet Dreams [Are Made of This]" which is played
during the film's opening sequence.

The album received generally positive reviews. Critics considered it one of the best
soundtracks of the year, although the rap by Armageddon in the mash-up of Queen's "I Want
It All" and "We Will Rock You" was cited as the album's bad point. Browning was praised for
her performance throughout the album, mainly on "Sweet Dreams [Are Made of This]".
Sucker Punch reached number twenty-two on the Billboard 200, and the top of the Top
Soundtracks chart. Internationally, the album reached the top fifty in Australia, New Zealand,
Austria and Germany.
