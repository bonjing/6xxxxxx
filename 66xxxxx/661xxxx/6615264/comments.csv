,SarethW,2012-03-31T17:27Z,"I tested this game on Windows XP 32bit and it works completly fine, my friend even tested it on Windows 7 32 bit and it worked great.
I'm gonna try to seed this game as long as possible for everyone but my internet is really shitty so expect slow speeds if nothing at all."
