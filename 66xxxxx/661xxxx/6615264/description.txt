Game information:
=================

Sam is a six-foot dog in a baggy suit sporting a trombone-sized .44
hand-cannon. Max is three feet of pure unleashed id with a saw blade
grin and the impulsive nature of the average piranha. Together they
patrol the sticky streets of a fantastical New York City, righting
wrongs, pummeling perps, and ridding the urban landscape of the shifty
legions of "self-propelled gutter trash" that litter their streets.
Sam & Max is Telltale's longest running episodic game series to date.

The new season Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse is the biggest,
strangest and most epic to date. As the saga begins, an otherworldy
power for controlling matter and space calls to the strongest and
strangest who might wield it - intergalactic warlords and eldritch
gods, under-dwellers and scholars of the arcane.

Gaming's greatest dog and rabbit sleuths Sam & Max seek the power's
ancient secrets, as Max gains shape shifting, teleportation, mind
reading and future vision abilities for battling these foes. The saga
plays out in a surreal 5 month-long symphony of mayhem that gets deeper
and more twisted with each episode.
