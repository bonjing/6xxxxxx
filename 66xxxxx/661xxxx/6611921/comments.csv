Dragonball and Dragonball GT Blue Water Coming Soon!!!"
,Predalian5,2011-09-09T06:48Z,"So when do you plan on putting this ""Coming Soon"" into Works?"
,DBFan1990,2011-09-10T21:56Z,"@Predalian5

Very soon, hopefully i'll have the GT one up within this week and the original DB when episodes 94 and 124 are found (only missing those 2)."

This might seem a bit rude to ask.... But I'll ask anyways

Can you just post it now? My friend keeps bothering me for it. He's obsessed with Dragon Ball. He says the lost ones aren't even his favourite"
,DBFan1990,2011-09-12T22:45Z,"@Predalian5

What do you mean by the lost ones aren't even his favorite?  All of the uploads are considered ""Lost"" episodes. Bluewater dub for GT and DB and Ocean Dub for DBZ, these are what were shown in English speaking European countries and Canada only, if you're looking for the Funimation dub (the one that was broadcast in America) , you can find it on this site too, but this is only Ocean and Bluewater."

.........
Okay. Never mind. Just let me know when they're Up.

Also. I'm going to revive this Torrent.
I can download the First two episodes.
So when they're done I'll seed"
,Predalian5,2011-10-03T07:54Z,"Can you assholes Please seed this, The other day I saw 5 Seeders, I just want to download a few more episode. Then that's it"
