While watching, it periodically jump further ahead into the movie for no reason...However, you can backtracked & watch the whole movie if you don't mind the ""pain in the ass"" routine.....Why bother when there's another torrent that allow you completely download the whole movie...It's the one with the website ""www.torrenting.com"" in its description...."
