,JediTrix,2011-08-18T19:57Z,Hey guys! I'm fairly new to torrents and all and am doing my research and seeding. I've watched this torrent and dl's go from about 140 to over 210 in the last 8 hours. I have now uploaded 10GB! Yet there are still only (THANK YOU!) 2 seeders??!! I might be tempted too with near a 6 ratio NOT to seed further if/when I'm done (LOL) but I won't! I WILL CONTINUE TO SEED! Why aren't more ppl seeding this obv. very pop. torrent?? Can more ppl please seed this? please? We'll ALL benefit. Tks guys! :)

,drizeem,2011-09-03T14:15Z,"DarkVnm21 at 2011-08-24 09:34 CET: 

how do you convert a rar file to play on a ps3? 
What file format is it when you extract the .rar file? 
Depending what it is, you can use any programs like Real Player, AVS video converter,NCH video pad,Wondershare,etc etc, these all do the same thing and give you an option to convert as ps3 file, iphone,AVi, and the list goes on...
Can someone Please confirm what files are after extracting from rar please? Thank you."

,dirtygrundies,2011-09-14T20:29Z,"nevermind, figured it out, works great!"
,rusty_r,2011-09-24T08:37Z,"Just a couple friendly suggestions. On a torrent like this don't cram all the video files into a rar file. Like this it is impossible to prioritize the download of specific episodes so we don't have to wait for the entire season to download to start watching it. Also, we can't see what format you used for the video files. If you must use a rar file at least post the file type of the videos in the torrent description... Just my opinions though. On the up side it is downloading pretty fast so I shouldn't have to wait all that long. lol. Thanks for the torrent."
