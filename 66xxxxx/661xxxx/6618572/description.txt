              NOTES


           Our releases are always virus-free. If you think you found
           something  suspicious, it's  a  problem  of  your security
           software. All those  antivirus systems  will  never be too
           smart, so don't complain.  And always remember that we are
           not responsible for modified releases.

           We aren't stealing releases. We respect hard work of other
           people and always  indicate  original authors of releases.
           We have permi ions to use their files.

           We are doing all this for fun  and  knowledge only. Always
           remember to support the developers if you like the product
           and its quality.
