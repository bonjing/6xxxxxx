About the Game

When indie game developers Alexey and Markus are in trouble, their only hope comes from their creation.

You are the Tetrobot: a tiny robot that can drill blocks of matter one by one, collect them, and recycle them into new pieces of 4 blocks. You also have the possibility to destroy lines of 8+ blocks in a very Â«retro russianÂ» game style. Sand, wood, stone, obsidian, iron, diamond: each matter has its specific behaviour you'll have to use wisely and take advantage of them. So get ready to use your brain and combine your platforming and puzzle-solving skills in this incredible mashup!

Key features:

    A unique gameplay experience mixing puzzle and platform that will challenge your brain
    40 levels to play in Adventure Mode, 20 bonus levels to unlock and more free content to come
    Collect every 40 ""Blocks That Matter"" and rediscover videogames made of blocks that made or will make History
    Create and share your own puzzles using an easy-to-use level editor (soon available)
    Steam achievements: 30+ achievements to unlock by playing the game and being creative.
    Steam Cloud: No matter if you play on PC or Mac, at home or outside, your progression will be saved."

,ibne101,2011-08-21T12:56Z,the file does not run even after installing Java :(
[T],alexisthebest,2011-08-21T13:25Z,"Yea. I seem to have problems with it also.
Mine runs, then closes.

Try following the instructions in your game install folder. Go to the README folder and open the README.txt"
[T],alexisthebest,2011-08-21T13:31Z,"So after doing some of the things it says in the README.txt , i got it to work. But strange, i cant get the game to run by running BTM_launcher_win.exe. I have to run BTM.jar.

Either way. It works."
,PirateNinja,2011-08-21T20:20Z,This game has problems running on Win7 64bit. Check the steam group for an official patch that will get it working. Works just fine with the THETA release.
,sputnikwood,2011-08-22T01:43Z,"i wonder why is it that ALL Theta releases are detected with malware and trojans (even if it's false positive).  this time around the actual game .exe is detected as malware by Avast.

I'm not even going to risk it."
[T],alexisthebest,2011-08-22T06:40Z,"@sputnikwood

They are detected like that because of the way they are packed and because it's pirated software so AVs will say it's a malware.

As for the game exe, i just scanned it with Malwarebytes and nothing was detected.

VirusTotal says there is nothing in the launcher exe

Nothing in the game jar either

I guess you're not going to 'risk' it anyways.
This is clean. I'm not going to give up my trusted status and upload infected files."
,marcusmfd,2011-08-23T02:52Z,"ok rule of thumb, dont download files that arent the game...in the theta files i've downloaded the only problems occur in the .nfo or in extra files you dont need, use your head and you'll be fine "
[T],alexisthebest,2011-08-24T01:17Z,"New updated version. They fixed the problem most people are having with Windows 7 x64 and java
