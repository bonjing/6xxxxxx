In other words not the complete game"
,thegorbster,2011-08-18T22:28Z,"FECK!!!
was all excited when i seen that :("
,-Algopyrin-,2011-08-19T13:28Z,Thanks for the demo anyway!
,v3n0m0us,2011-08-19T16:05Z,Can anyone confirm if it's the old beta version ( released a month or so ago ) or the new supposedly updated version? 
,Mad_yojik,2011-08-20T10:37Z,"Well, doesnt work for me =( Win7x32bit, crashes... Does anyone have the same problem?"
,Adam of Budapest,2011-08-20T15:25Z,It works just fine at me. Thanks for the upload!

,FanofTBP,2011-08-21T21:05Z,I'm having trouble with data5.orc. For some reason powerarchiver doesn't know how to correctly extract it.
,Mart726,2011-08-21T22:00Z,"When you upload a game YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO WRITE ANY INFO!!!!

You asshole!

Is it the beta?
Is it a demo?

No one fucking knows and it's all because of you!"
,UglyDucklingxyz,2011-08-21T22:24Z,Why not try Winzip?
,Makuso11,2011-08-22T09:36Z,"yeah, its different from beta verion - only tutorial but  +1 skirmish/multiplayer map"
,FanofTBP,2011-08-22T14:09Z,"Mart726 - The demo came out the day it was uploaded and the demo was the same size as this file. 

The top comment also says that this is the demo.


I think it's safe to say that it's the demo."
[T],Skymocker,2011-08-22T23:41Z,"if you compare versions it might help, this download is ver 1.0.31232, I don't have the ""old"" beta to compare it to, but it seemed to me that this was apx .5 gigs larger than the older upload.  and frankly, why worry if it's been called a demo or a beta.  to my knowledge there is no public demo.  therefore, this is the beta.

>Insert rational thinking here"
