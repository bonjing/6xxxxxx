Thanks"
,marthafar,2011-08-23T14:54Z,"There's only one seed at the moment so when I stop seeding, the seeding stops. It resumes when I start again. It isn't always convenient for me to keep the machine running (and, therefore to keep seeding) continuously. Once more than one person can seed I am sure that the availability will improve."
,tedans74,2011-08-23T19:25Z,No worries  thanks! :)

,xanthippe13,2011-09-11T23:22Z,"Marthafar,
I have a problem with the audio. The sound in the main menu is ok but when it switcher over to the episodes there is no sound. 
Could you check this please?

Thanks!

"
,marthafar,2011-09-17T01:46Z,"Have you found audio problems on other any of the other discs or is it just this one? As far as I'm aware, they are all OK, but I will check things again, just to be sure, and will report back. Apologies for any disconvenience."
,blocktorsk,2011-09-18T19:19Z,"Yep! No sound on these episodes, just on the main menu. The other discs are o.k."
,marthafar,2011-09-18T19:51Z,"Apologies for the glitch. I'll see if I can fix it, or else I'll re-author from scratch; either way I will upload a new iso. However, it may be a week before I can attend to it as other demands are piling up. "
,blocktorsk,2011-09-23T01:44Z,Thanks a lot Marthafar!
,merkkarix,2011-10-18T22:33Z,I also noticed the audio problem with this one. Is there a fixed iso available?
,allnlu,2012-04-20T05:16Z,Downloaded 9-12 twice and no sound anyone got an alternative or a solution?
