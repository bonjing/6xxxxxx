Uncover a chilling conspiracy in this scary Hidden
Object investigation!

Becky Brogan's criminology class has piqued her interest in
all things that are bizarre, and the abandoned Institute on
the outskirts of town definitely fits the category.

A nurse at the once troubled youth facility mysteriously
vanished one night after being employed there by an
eccentric doctor with interesting treatment methods.

Clues pointed to the patients, but when Becky starts
digging around, she discovers the doctor's sordid past and
begins to wonder who was really responsible.

It's now up to Becky to decipher the clues left behind in
each room of the institute to discover what really happened!

Uncover Dr. GentleÂ’s unconventional treatment methods

Unravel hidden-object scenes and locate forsaken relics

Analyze inkblots, peek through notes, and decipher strange
clues left behind

Help Becky bring this troubling case to a close
