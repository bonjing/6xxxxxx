PLOT
Former cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) partners with ex-con Dom
Toretto (Vin Diesel) on the opposite side of the law. Dwayne    
Johnson joins returning favorites Jordana Brewster, Tyrese      
Gibson, Chris "Ludacris" Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Gal  
Gadot, Tego Calderon and Don Omar for this ultimate high-stakes 
race. Since Brian and Mia Toretto (Brewster) broke Dom out of   
custody, they've blown across many borders to elude authorities.
Now backed into a corner in Rio de Janeiro, they must pull one  
last job in order to gain their freedom. As they assemble their 
elite team of top racers, the unlikely allies know their only   
shot of getting out for good means confronting the corrupt      
businessman who wants them dead. But he's not the only one on   
their tail. Hard-nosed federal agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson)
never misses his target.
