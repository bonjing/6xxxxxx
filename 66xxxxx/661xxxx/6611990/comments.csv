Or do you have an idea what i can try ? "
[V],Anacondaz,2011-08-22T14:10Z,"there is no need to convert it

,bdbarrera,2011-09-01T04:53Z,"@Anacondaz

Thanks for the torrent. Installs fine but, is not activated?  Can you suggest a fix?

Anyone else know what to do here?"
,bdbarrera,2011-09-01T04:55Z,"@All

Additionally, none of the other activators that I have found on TPB have worked to resolve this non-activation issue.

Anyone have any success using any other activators?"

,Bora84,2011-09-05T10:32Z,"@rjay.gomez

Thanks but that really didnt aswered my question. I hate post install programs like on that Dark Lite edition, also this windows is great except my favorite security software doesnt work (Norton Internet Security). So suggesting that bloatware NOD is out of the question for me. Norton is way way better."

,gggg3,2012-01-03T22:08Z,NICE WORK!!!SUPER FAST WINDOWS.
,cableman67,2012-01-16T22:01Z,"You guys, you should know that when you do a fresh install that all old files will be erased. If you want to keep pictures, music, movies, etc. then back them up to a flash drive or CD or whatever so you can re-install them when the new windows version is installed and ready. Also in my experience i use ""Power ISO"" to burn .iso files to a disc and I check the box ""verify files written"" and write it at the slowest possible speed. Many, many times problems get blamed on the guy who did all this hard work creating something great when it is only a mistake made by trying to burn the file to disk too quick and making errors. I know this from experience so what is 5 or 10 more minutes to be sure that you got the file burnt to your disc properly? You guys got to learn how to install drivers. All you have to do is go to the manufacturer's Web site of your computer, select ""drivers and support downloads"" then enter your computer model information and a list of driver downloads will appear for you to download and install for free. WOW, what more can you ask for?"
,techsmith12,2012-03-26T07:08Z,"This is so far the best one out there i have seen.
Install size is under 2 gigs, relatively recent and can be updated.

Anacondaz did you make this or find this somewhere else? Can you make a 64bit version, or point me the
way to detailed instructions?"
