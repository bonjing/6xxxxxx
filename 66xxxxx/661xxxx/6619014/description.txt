All praise is due to Allah alone, Who decreed death upon every soul and is the only One Who is Eternally Everlasting; may He send salutations and exalt the mention of the seal of all Prophets and Messengers, our Prophet Mohammad, his family and all his companions and those who follow in their footsteps until the Day of Resurrection.

The Title: How to Seek Laylat-ul-Qadr
Language: English
The Writer : Muhammad al-Jibaly
From issues : http://www.islaam.com

Short Description: Laylat ul-Qadr is the most blessed night. A person who misses it has indeed missed a great amount of good. If a believing person is zealous to obey his Lord and increase the good deeds in his record, he should strive to encounter this night and to pass it in worship and obedience. If this is facilitated for him, all of his previous sins will be forgiven.
