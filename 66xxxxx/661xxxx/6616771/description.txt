[uploader notes and rants: 

"Varney & Company" is going to temporarily fill-in the FW timeslot next week. Judge Napolitano will be away. Expect regular Freedom Watch listing to return after the 26th.

Freedom Watch is a very timely current events show. As such, the shelf-life of individual episodes is rather limited. I maintain non-continuous root seeding for only three-weeks past air date, after which I dispose of older listings. I've been killing them off in this listing too, except recently delete here has broken. Don't expect a fill on older FW listings except by other community seeds. When delete/edit functions are finally fixed, old listings will be purged from here.

I have hope that in the future, FW becomes somewhat less driven by the shallow 24hr-news cycle, and more focused in an analytical sense on core issues at the intersection of free-society and government, like much of what is seen on Stossel. I'd prefer to drill down thoughtfully into single-topic shows than try to cover everything happening now to a depth of only 1/4", night after night (and it's mostly the same topics night-to-night anyhow). I have become rather bored of Freedom Watch. Not yet bored enough to stop following, but enough to have grown a general malaise.

For something deeper, and in the direction I've love for Freedom Watch to go, I vigorously recommend Lew Rockwell's podcast!
