[V],DownTYU,2011-08-18T22:02Z,It is the whole intact untouched BluRay...
,vandammage,2011-08-18T22:09Z,Why a joke if you have a BD burner you can download this version anyway just wait for smaller one. This guy always have great uploads and speed.
,ColoradoSilver,2011-08-18T22:11Z,"Hmmmm.... No Seeds, No Sample, 46.1 GB in size, and official release date for this isn't until October 4. 

Unless someone has actually dnlded this and can verify, I'd call it a fake!"
,Night_89,2011-08-18T22:15Z,"brilliant upload
eagerly waiting for a 720p upload"
[M],vicerock,2011-08-18T22:16Z,nice thanks mate
,doude422,2011-08-18T22:17Z,Way to big of a file to download
,Night_89,2011-08-18T22:18Z,"@ColoradoSilver

You are an idiot. He is a trusted member who has much better seeders than anyone in his uploads and he uploads at least five movies daily

thanks again for this brilliant upload"

Thanks!"

I thought only idiots used the word ""idiot"". Especially when they know nothing abouut the person they're talking to. 

Anyway.. trusted uploader accts get hacked all the time with faked files. 

I know now this one is real, but at the time it just didn't seem likely, and usually there is a sample provided with a file of this quality. 

So, sorry if I had offended you somehow, but personal attacks really do say something about you. 

Enjoy the file. "
,AS9292,2011-08-18T23:50Z,I mean I'm interested in watching this but not enough to wait for 46 gigs to download. Hopefully another 1080p 8-12 gig version will be uploaded shortly.
,orclord,2011-08-18T23:55Z,"I'd like to add this comment since most people will think this is fake
Do you people know what size 1080p untouched is? the original shot could well be over 100gb so if you think its fake because of the size you are stupid and it's released on bluray in a few countrys already so unlikely its a fake"
,divenpt,2011-08-19T00:32Z,This is true torrent ???
,JOR23,2011-08-19T01:35Z,WELL...I SHALL TRAY...THANKS IN ADVANCE.
,Goldfire1986,2011-08-19T01:47Z,"*Starts download*

I'm game =D"
,Goldfire1986,2011-08-19T02:07Z,"Either I'm looking at the wrong files, or I don't think this is legit.

I haven't completed the files yet, but,

50201.m2ts (the main video stream @ 32GB) is actually an hour long porno.
50312.m2ts is an episode of ""Falling Skies"".
50302.m2ts is a ""mofos.com"" porno.

Some of the other m2ts files appear to be legit.

Can anyone else check these particular files in the STREAM folder?

If I'm incorrect, I'll accept it. But this just isn't right..."
[V],DownTYU,2011-08-19T02:43Z,"@Goldfire1986
This bluray comes from the renowned russian tracker HDCLUB...Over 5000 people completed in various private tracker all over internet...Nobody complained about quality...
At hdclub all these people said ""thanks""

If you think this ain't legit. Go away I never forced you to download this."
,JUSTlN182,2011-08-19T02:46Z,"stop complaining guys...if you dont to download it because its too big, then download the 420p version thats already up"
,Goldfire1986,2011-08-19T03:16Z,"@DownTYU

That's great and all, but I'm unsure how to explain the files that I have so far. I do thank you for uploading the torrent, and I'll have to let it finish to see what is actually going on with the files I have."
,Goldfire1986,2011-08-19T03:48Z,"Okay, after completing more of the files, they are legit. I'm so confused at how they were different during the download process.

I apologise."
,badboy420,2011-08-19T05:51Z,"@Goldfire1986 i guess u ran the files from some other porno torrent that u were downloading
:D"
,Goldfire1986,2011-08-19T06:07Z,"@badboy420

Haha, that would actually make sense, but 1) I don't have those particular porno's I saw and 2) there were no other torrents running =\"
[V],DibyaTPB,2011-08-19T06:52Z,Thnx A lot mate! Visions 720p version is upped now! Ty!

,vandammage,2011-08-19T11:20Z,"Hope there's gonna be 1080p with DTS sound soon around 8GB, the one that is now is only DD 5.1 less than 7GB"
