,HiroPro2,2011-10-10T07:14Z,"Mp3 101 !!!

(1) Encode using LAME (itunes is CRAP using Fraunhofer encoder boo!!)

(2) Set encoder to VBR (variable bit rate) as LAME was engineered for this. CBR is CRAP and in all honesty a VBR altpreset standard at -V2 is as good as a 320 CBR !!!! and file is WAY SMALLER!!!

(3) SET IT TO JOINT STEREO NOT ""STEREO"" and if I have to explain don't ask because you have no comprehension of what the setting actually does or the maths/technology behind mp3!!!

owhh and LEARN how to use GOOGLE and RESEARCH ripping music PROPERLY you 320 CBR Fraunhofer RETARDS!!!

PS dBpoweramp is FANTASTIC ripping software!"
,didge1969,2011-12-26T09:50Z,Thanks very much
,MU4L,2011-12-30T13:43Z,"@ bratandy:

HiroPro2 might have gone overboard a bit but essentially he's right, VBR > CBR."
