,villainb,2011-08-19T01:11Z,"Eh, there's noticeable echo in the audio, and colors are dark and faded. Its like a REALLY good cam. I know its hard to wait, but this isn't quite what you're hoping for.   ...almost!

A:7
V:5"

A. 6.5 (changes to Chinese for like a sentence, otherwise fine thru my 5.1)
V. 7.5 (not quite dvd but no where near as bad as a cam, very watchable)

overall good rip for such an early release. thanks Neon Rainbow"
