From the description when the above was written:
[Subs.............: Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Danish, Spanish, German, Italian, English For The Deaf And Hard Of Hearing]



P.S. I know some would come ahead and argue that it's an English movie, so what's the need of subtitles, but that's a ridiculous excuse of not including subtitles while mentioning so in the description. And for those who are of the opinion that there are sites available specifically for subtitles, I'm not asking for your opinion. Thanks."
