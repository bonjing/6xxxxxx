        After his parents' death, Jacob Jankoski is left               
        penniless and homeless. Events lead him to joining the         
        circus as their vet, working under their unstable boss          
        August whose violent tendencies give everyone reason to         
        be cautious around him, including his beautiful and             
        quiet wife Marlena, whom August is very possessive of          
        and who Jacob finds himself soon falling in love with.
