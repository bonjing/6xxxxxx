,houta97,2011-08-22T04:36Z,"This is how it worked for me:

1. install
2. take the exe and the two .dll from the skidrow folder and put them in your game folder
3. take all files from the orbit folder and put them in both the 'ubisoft\from dust' folder and in the 'ubisot\ubisoft game launcher' folder

If you get the message ""fatal error can't create sound device""

1. disable all sound devices that you don't use
2. reboot
3. start the game"

,DragonXG,2011-08-23T13:06Z,"After trying the SkidRow (and the Offline fix) and the Kaos releases, FD still didn't work.
Running From_Dust.exe just got a small blank dialog.
I found a way to generate the UbisoftGameLauncher command line parameters, and using the Orbit folder was able to get into the Launcher, use any code, but when clicked Play, FD crashed.
Look in the launcher Logs, use a Base64 converter for the path and put it together in a BAT.
I found FD looking for the UGL in D:\, regardless of the registry saying otherwise.
The solution... I put the FD folder onto a blank USB drive and the 'contents' of the Orbit folder into the root of the same drive.
Sorry, I cannot remember where I got the UGL.exe that accepts any code, but it wasnt from KaOs or the SkidRow cracks. I tried many combos, so am not sure what came from where.
From_Dust.exe then worked, started the Launcher, which accepted any code, and Play ran the game.
Oh... another thing, I also use a Mimo 7"" USB LCD, managed by DisplayFusion.
The game wont run with the second 'monitor' on. Dungeons (Kalypso Media) has the same problem.
Hope this helps all those not able to play. Good luck. "

,KMonline,2011-08-23T22:14Z,"Can you help me in the ""Copy everything from the SKIDROW folder to the game installation"" part? I didn't get it. Does it mean that I have to copy whats inside and paste it in the setup.exe?
Please help me!"
,stagml,2011-08-24T10:54Z,could someone SERIOUSLY answer how to play without internet connexion as it always asks for update? plz have the steps easily put together...
,Fryilluh,2011-08-25T09:41Z,"ianbob98 had it right for me...  I'm running windows Vista 64 bit, and once I installed the game, I went straight to the game install folder (C:\program files x86\ubisoft\from dust) and ran fromdust.exe.  This updates the game.  Once it was updated, I closed all windows, and took the Fromdust.exe out of the Skidrow folder and replaced the one the game installed.  I also replaced the Ubisoftgamelauncher.exe in the gamelauncher folder.  Those were the only two files I replaced and after uninstalling/reinstalling 4 different times (trying 4 different install methods) this method worked for me.  "
,stassano,2011-08-25T14:04Z,The application was unable to start correctly (0x0000007b).
,AJMIS,2011-08-26T12:21Z,"I'm having a problem, I installed the game and did everything ( not my first time installing a SKIDROW game ) but when I launch the game, the game crashes right after the companies start up screens :S :( help plz ?"

,ursumium,2011-08-27T07:44Z,works perfectly.  Just beat the game.  Show the developers some love and buy the game if you enjoyed it !
,NOTME13325,2011-08-30T21:52Z,"omg i hate u!!
There is no FOLDER NAMED @installation@
Nor There isnt a single torrent that has worked for me wich is a skidrow release so where the fuck is the installation folder???"
,love2shpongleirl,2011-08-30T23:55Z,"NOTME13325 Are you fucking retarted? I don't mean to be rude, but don't blame the release group for your own mental deficiencys.  Your install folder is where you installed the game to. Should be in program files, ubisoft, the from dust. Copy the shit into the from dust folder."
,Chunkoha,2011-08-31T08:04Z,"I'm on Windows 7 64-bit, and here's what worked for me:

1) Download this torrent.
2) Install the game by mounting the .iso and using the install wizard.
3) Once installed, go to the install directory you chose during installation, or C:\Program Files(x86)\Ubisoft\From Dust\ by default, and run From_Dust.exe. This updates the game.
4) Once it's done updating, a box will come up asking for a username and password.  Close this window.
5) Open the .iso using WinRAR or some other program to open it as a folder, rather than running it like a disc.
6) Open the SKIDROW folder.
7) Take the From_Dust.exe from the SKIDROW folder and copy it to your install directory, replacing the one you just used in step 3.
8) In the orbit folder (which is inside the SKIDROW folder) copy the UbisoftGameLauncher.exe and paste it in C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\.
9) Launch the game using From_Dust.exe.

This method worked for me, and I have the game running as I type this.  I didn't have to put in a username and password anywhere.  Good luck.

P.S.  There's been a repack for people with 32-bit OS.  I don't know whether my method will still work, but it's worth noting.

,OmniCoRp,2011-09-01T13:26Z,"Okay weird thing happened to me!
I tried many times installing the game, with offline fix and without, with update and offline and regular crack. But nothing worked.
Then i tried registering the game online, cause i already had an account, and tried it all again, but no succes.
So i decided to try one more time, and uninstalled it all, and installed it again. Let it check for updates, and when it came to CD-key screen i hit cancel and for some reason it launched the game?
Without any crack or anything!"

,reythekid,2011-09-13T17:07Z,"Right so to the folks getting the blank dialog this worked for me... but maybe I'm just lucky :\
So I downloaded the torrent tried every bloody method and fix someone else posted. Update, crack blah blah blah. Finally after trying the last one I uninstalled it, reinstalled (didn't restart the PC or anything) I DID NOT CRACK IT! No skidrow folder nothinggg.
After the installation right after it ended it took me to the ubisoft site to log in n register the game I logged in with my old address, n I just clicked register and ubisoft told me thanks for registering it was quite shocking but hey I wasn't complaining, I copied the from_dust.exe to the desktop as a shortcut clicked it, it asked me to sign in when it started asked me for the key I put in some random bs number an voila it worked like a charm O_O 
buttt maybe I'm lucky :\"

This is a great little game. There aren't many god games and this one is the most unique of 'em all. Little content, as you can tell by the size, but all of it is new.

when you get connection error, go to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc and move the 2 host files to some different place

start the game, let it update and stuff, create account when prompted (dont worry, its not a real acc) and when asked for serial hit cancel.

I've got an i7 extreme, HD 6990 and 32GB of RAM but after copying over all the cracked contents nothing happens at all. The mouse turns into a loading screen and then nothing happens.. the .exe doesn't even run.

I've tried running as Admin. The patcher loads up, and then says it's encounted a problem and it closes. I thought the fucking crack is supposed to prevent the updater from running at all?

Why the fuck is it working for everyone else?"
,Suomisisu,2012-02-05T23:10Z,"Ok so after fucking around endlessly. I just downloaded the 'offline fix for 32 bit users' even though I'm on 64 bit and after copying that over all the shit I had already copied over it ran fine without ever asking for a key or ever trying to make an update or without ever showing me a blank dialogue box.
