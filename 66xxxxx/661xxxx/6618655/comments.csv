I think it may be because you can't select so many cheats at one time and it overloads it or something. I'll probably have to choose one cheat in different turns."
,DelphiUniverse,2011-08-21T04:52Z,I have all 4 cheats enabled here at the same time
,DelphiUniverse,2011-08-21T04:58Z,Hold on I will try to create an experiment just for you
,DelphiUniverse,2011-08-21T05:02Z,"Try this, see if it works: http://pastebin.com/MSCFDXPt"
,thecrazyglopss,2011-08-21T05:27Z,It doesn't do anything like that other thing.
,DelphiUniverse,2011-08-21T06:04Z,"The problem is obviously adressing issues in the modules, you are using 64 bit windows and i am on 32 bit windows 7. I am trying to change parameters. Try this: http://pastebin.com/hRiF5FZ2

I will go to bed now, see you tomorrow."
,DelphiUniverse,2011-08-21T15:46Z,"I have done another change, I want you to try and see if this one works for you if you are using windows 64

,DelphiUniverse,2011-08-21T16:23Z,"I don't think it will work however, I think I have a pretty clear idea what the problem is. Will try to solve it."
,thecrazyglopss,2011-08-21T16:49Z,"It pretty much just did the same thing as v 4.0.4

Using most of the cheats at once = crash"
,DelphiUniverse,2011-08-21T16:55Z,"I've made another change, try this:

,DelphiUniverse,2011-08-21T17:03Z,"I have made another one, this time I have implemented error checking. If it gives you an error, give me the error code.

,thecrazyglopss,2011-08-21T17:39Z,"Error code was 299.

It kept popping up loads of times so I used task manager on it, no big deal."
,DelphiUniverse,2011-08-21T17:43Z,It is important for me to know if the error code popped up before you quit civilization or after you quit civilization.
,thecrazyglopss,2011-08-21T18:22Z,After it crashed
