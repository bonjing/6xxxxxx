,Cryptical654,2011-10-24T08:35Z,"Thanks for sharing but the audio is fucked, chief. The louds are too loud and most of the dialogue is too quiet. I'm making this same complaint about ""Deadgirl,"" and I admit to having an ear infection in one ear, though, so maybe it's just me. Or maybe I'm right and Thepiratebay.org is populated with epic fuckups."
