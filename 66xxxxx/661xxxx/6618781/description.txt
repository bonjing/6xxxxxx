Includes dzpatch.exe which you must run to patch this to work

Instructions included

As a former software developer who made a nice living with FoxPro
application development (accounting systems and inventory control
systems along with Point of Sale systems in addition to several other
vertical market applications too) I can tell you this piece of software
was a goldmine for those with an understanding of the needs of users 
and the willingness to provide the features and functionality required
to make the best use of it as a tool in the service of humankind.
I had a number of well known companies using my software and development 
expertise in Canada, USA and the United Kingdom especially.

It is still a great help to us today, we use it to maintain email lists
and to create them for Outlook 2000 etc, and I'm planning to write an Accounting
application again soon to post here for you as a free download equally!


Bill Gates should give this away too 
(along with placing XP into the public domain)!

If you need to patch for version 2.6a from this 2.60 version , visit
Microsoft for it - its available tight now and may work for you - good luck!
