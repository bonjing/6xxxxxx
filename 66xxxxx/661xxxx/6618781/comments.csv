,mrizzo2,2011-08-21T22:20Z,"Any program in this category should be probably be run under XP compatibility mode - if it will run at all under win7, that would be how you might do it. While Microsoft seems to now indicate it was a processor speed issue related problem that required patching for, in my experience it is an operating system environment issue. However its a moot point - the fact is you need to use it in XP or later environments - hoping it will work for anything other than XP. There is a unix version of foxpro 2.6 now and the available out there too by the way, for those so concerned with multi-user issues on non-distributed processing environments (relatively speaking). That was in the past the efficient way for database management in certain applications for the most part. LAN multi-user solutions came later and co-existed for a while. Now its a lot mainly internet access based I would gather."
