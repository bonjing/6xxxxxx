,Amazin4Play,2011-08-18T02:19Z,"I really hope this is working with your crack too, because that would be awesome!"
,Torbax,2011-08-18T02:26Z,"What's with all the crap and loose files??.. Gees not used to that lol 
Most of the time its a nice .Iso or a .rar .... but I think its just whatever works for you I guess"
,ianbob98,2011-08-18T03:40Z,i hope this one really works
,enterthehole,2011-08-18T05:36Z,Working. Thanks .BONE. :]
,clemlenain,2011-08-18T06:53Z,"Working. Thx !
For those who might search for it : the ubisoft that you have to copy over is NOT in the game folder , but in your programs files folder (c:->programs files->ubisoft)"
,Crazerwolf,2011-08-18T07:21Z,"Little help please.
Once I installed it, I made the acc. copied everything is ok.I start the game put the random key the game starts and when I see the UBISOFT logo (the leading screen) I get an ERROR that From Dust stopped working...any idea ? :/"
,Crazerwolf,2011-08-18T07:34Z,"For me it says: From_Dust.exe stopped working....I installed it, made the acc. copied the launcher and after the ubisoft loading screen I get that error...any idea ? :/"
,artiti,2011-08-18T08:21Z,"Since this uses the Ubi launcher. Do you have to make an account with ubi itself? i.e. do they know you cracked the game?
I'm asking this since I don't want to need a active internet connection or advocate my ip to them even if the launcher is cracked."
,aznyungster,2011-08-18T08:25Z,"I have the same problem as Crazerwolf, I did everything but it never lets me get past the ubisoft logo before it says error and stops running.
"
,aznyungster,2011-08-18T08:40Z,Can anyone help me with this? The game just stops working after a certain point (The Ubisoft Logo).
,redrumpanda,2011-08-18T09:04Z,"I fucking love you .BONE. I swear I've been so excited to play this game. They should give you a gold skull.

If you can't get the game to work don't blame the up loader. L2 interwebs"
,ninjanutta,2011-08-18T09:15Z,turn off your firewall to get past the error when updating at the start of the game
,Knifezerker,2011-08-18T10:38Z,"If anyone needs help i have a detailed video on my youtube channel ""knifezerker"" that shows how to install AND fixes a lot of errors that people are having with this game... It works with this torrent perfectly, this torrent is just extracted already!"
,hahalolfailmupp,2011-08-18T11:37Z,"Ye its extracted, no iso, no iso packed in 40 rars = quick install and quick redownload of corrupted files"
,aznyungster,2011-08-18T13:14Z,I watched your whole vid Knifezerker and the game still don't start. Idk why.
,ianbob98,2011-08-18T15:21Z,i have the same problem after it says ubisoft the game crashes
,mw2pro123,2011-08-18T17:49Z,"Its very slow! The only 2 fast downloads that i found we're from unkown people with viruses! Please tell me, why is this so slow ?"
,Ultrakonkret,2011-08-18T18:08Z,"@aznyungster 

deactivate Data Execution Preveention, or add the dust.exe as an exclusion..."
,hahalolfailmupp,2011-08-18T18:20Z,"I got this down in 55 minutes, clicked the install, let it run through, replaced the exe and it works perfectly."
,carnivore_23,2011-08-18T21:01Z,When I run the game I get an error message synchronization. any of you had such a problem?
,aznyungster,2011-08-18T22:38Z,I did DEP thing But it still crashes after Ubsoft logo
,MasterHax,2011-08-19T08:13Z,"DO THIS!:
1.INSTALL GAME
2.RUN FROMDUST.EXE(FOR UPDATA)
3.COPY UbisoftGameLauncher(download crack) TO:
C:\ProgramFiles\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher
4. RUN FROMDUST.EXE
5.CRETE ACCONT

,xwarf,2011-08-20T01:47Z,"Remenber to press ""settings"" and uncheck save sync before you press play (on the launcher after serial key)! Or the game will crash to desktop!"
,Dimmis80,2011-08-20T12:18Z,Nice game and its working just fine.Thanks a lot @BONE.
,pa3kjosh,2011-08-21T10:23Z,"The game really crashes after/while the logo animates. I tried turning off the Firewall and adding From_Dust.exe on exclusion of Data Execution Prevention, but everything fails. Help :("

,DarkstoneXII,2011-08-24T03:05Z,"Hello, I have downloaded I think the 3rd torent for a  From Dust PC game that promised me a good game and that it will work, I have followed step by step instructions and so far each one of them failed at one point or another. Now this will be the 4th one, now this one stopped working right when it was loading the game after the Ubisoft logo then it gave me some bullshit about From_Dust.exe not working. Can someone actually give me a detailed answer on how to fix this problem instead of some 5 worded answer, some sarcasm, or blaming my coputer my computer is up to date with windows 7. Jsut answer my question please."
,infoeater123,2011-08-27T15:29Z,after the ubisoft logo it crashes can somebody help me. pls post a fix or a link. Thx in advance
,Abuulo,2011-09-05T00:10Z,"Elo,  I had been having trouble with this game in several torrents... So i decided to just buy it, After downloading it and Installing it I was having the same problem(crashing after Ubisoft Logo) I'm led to believe if your computer is not up to par, you will have this crash. I'm not 100% sure, but that is my guess.

Keep up the good downloads .BONE."
