Greatest Hits is a compilation album by the American rock band Guns N' Roses, released on March 23, 2004. The album reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and number three on the Billboard 200 chart. Despite some criticisms towards the track listing by fans, and by Axl Rose and ex-Guns N' Roses members, who filed a joint lawsuit to try to prevent the release of the album, the album has proven a popular seller, selling 5 million copies in the United States to date. Greatest Hits became Guns N' Roses' second-longest charting album in their homeland (after Appetite for Destruction), finally dropping out of the chart in November 2006 following a 138-week stay but re-entered at 132 on the Billboard 200 chart on December 4, 2009.[8] Universal Records' response to Rose's opposition to the record was that he had been given adequate time to supply them with a record but had failed to do so, and so they had produced their own Guns N' Roses record instead. The album is sometimes seen as a follow-up to their Welcome to the Videos release from 1998, which is a VHS/DVD greatest hits collection containing most of their videos. In Ireland it has managed to stay a total of 201 weeks in the albums chart, selling a total of 876,000 copies there. In August 2011, the album spent its 326th week on the UK Albums Chart making it the album with the longest run currently on that chart
