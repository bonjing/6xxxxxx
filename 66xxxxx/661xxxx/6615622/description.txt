Notes
ULTRA rare Frank Zappa appearance at a concert to celebrate the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Czechoslovak territory in 1991. Frank states he hasn't played guitar in three years! As far as I can determine, this CD was only released in Czechoslovakia (an import CD was also released in Japan later, I think). My CD seems to be an original Czechoslovak pressing as there is no additional Japanese insert and all the text is in Czechoslovak. I translated the song titles where appropriate with Google Translate. My apologies for any mistakes or missed nuances! There are a TON of punctuation marks in the song titles that can't be kept in a simple text file, so I included a RichText file with lots more info and correct song titles for your edification.


 And, as always, trade freely and NEVER SELL.
