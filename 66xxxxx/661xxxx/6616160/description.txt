Road Games is an EP by guitarist Allan Holdsworth, released in 1983 through Warner Bros. Records on vinyl only; a CD edition was reissued through Gnarly Geezer Records in 2001, although to this day Holdsworth claims to have received no royalties from either release. This is one of his least favourite recordings, due to numerous creative differences with executive producer Ted Templeman. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1984 for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.
