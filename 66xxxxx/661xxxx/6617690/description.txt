                    Laura Branigan July 3, 1957 â€“ August 26, 2004








US pop star Laura Branigan, who enjoyed hits with the songs Gloria and Self Control in the early 1980s, 
has died of a brain aneurysm in her sleep aged 47. 
Branigan, also an actress, was nominated for four 
Grammy Awards and her Gloria single reached number two in the US chart in 1982. 

She complained of a headache for two weeks before she died but did not seek medical attention, 
her brother said. She died on Thursday at home in East Quogue, New York, her family said. 

Soundtracks 

After the success of Gloria, she also enjoyed chart hits with How Am I Supposed To Live Without You?
and Solitaire in 1983, and Self Control the following year before her chart career faded. 
Gloria was a remake of a 1970s Italian pop song, while How Am I Supposed To Live Without You?
was co-written with a then-unknown Michael Bolton. 

She was first choice to sing All Time High, the title tune to James Bond movie Octopussy 
but eventually lost out to Rita Coolidge. But she did contribute to film soundtracks 
including Flashdance and Ghostbusters and duetted with David Hasselhoff on the track 
I Believe for the Baywatch soundtrack in 1994. 

Rave reviews 

Although she continued to release albums, her profile never returned to the level 
she enjoyed in the early 1980s. Also an accomplished actress, her roles included 
TV show Chips and films Mugsy's Girl and Backstage. One of her last appearances was playing rock legend 
Janis Joplin to rave reviews in New York stage musical Love, Janis. 

Born in Brewster, New York, Branigan had begun her career at the 
Academy of Dramatic Arts and became a backing singer for Leonard Cohen before getting a solo record deal.
