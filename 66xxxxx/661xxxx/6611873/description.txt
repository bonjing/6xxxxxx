The fact is for most people to lose weight and keep it off, it requires a combination of approaches. There is no single â€œmagicâ€ diet, exercise program, or pill that can do it all. This program takes the synergistic approach of combining diet, exercise (with a program that can be tailored to almost any fitness level), and weight loss supplements (healthy ones, not dangerous stimulants), PLUS takes into consideration hormonal and physiological barriers to weight loss. It is intended to be used with the mental/emotional conditioning approaches.
