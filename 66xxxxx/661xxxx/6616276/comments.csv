my computer has been on downloading this now for over a week non stop and i'm at 25.2% and I dedicate all my bandwidth just to this file and I have no fucking luck."
,en0nym0us,2011-08-29T22:12Z,"Thanks for sharing! I downloaded this in under 12 hours. I watched this in 1080p with DTS-HD Master Audio and i busted a nut all over the place. The sound is phenomenal! The DTS-HD Master Audio is worth the 23.43 GB if anyone manages how to stream it properly. I will be seeding this for some time now. Again, Thanks."
