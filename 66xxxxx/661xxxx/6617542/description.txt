\\\"Headmix (now split up) were acclaimed as the best festival band, behind Zion Train, for years in the UK - their eclectic mix of instruments and their raw stage energy were amazing and they could be seen playing literally anywhere they could, up and down the UK - an inspiration. Headmix ( formally Head Mix Collective ) were one of the UKâ€™s finest festival style bands. Since their inception almost five years ago theyâ€™ve gained a great reputation for their unique Dub Reggae meets Celtic Hoedown vibes. Head Mix Collective were originally formed by ex-members of Tofu Love Frogs, Doo The Moog and The Cheap Suit Oroonies. All these bands were synonymous with festivals and having a good time. This makes HMC possibly the worldâ€™s first festi-diddldum supergroup. They are festi-skank complete with melodica, tin-whistle, didgedoo and accordian. Their music will have you dancing to deep dub style bass and melodica lines one minute, then jigging up and down to penny whistles and irish fiddle the next; but always with that groove-conscious rhythm-driven thang backing it up. Theyâ€™ve always been a hard gigging band both indoors & outdoors at their much loved festival appearances. A process thatâ€™s seen them ascend from the natural starting point of the blaggers stages through the moderately organised cafÃ© stages and culminating in last years â€˜Oerolâ€™ festival in Lowlands, Holland. Where the band played to an audience of over eight thousand.

Whilst constantly gigging, Headmix were also hard at work in the studio producing a string of home-grown CD releases. A chance meeting with fellow festival stalwarts Zion Train, led at first to support slots and soon progressed to Headmix members guesting onstage with Zion Train. A relationship which eventually led to Headmix signing with Zion Trains Universal Egg label. Now after over two years of studio collaboration with both Zion Train and Levellers producer Al Scott. â€˜Birthrights is an excellent second album from a band going from strength to stength. And whatâ€™s more, in these times of so much programmable music itâ€™s refreshing to come across a band that really can cut it both live and in the studio.\\\"
