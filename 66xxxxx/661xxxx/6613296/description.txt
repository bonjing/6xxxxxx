This Movie Is a hard one to find... Only a few still have it around on vhs. The Video quality is poor and the audio is what you would expect from a vhs rip... but... here it is a digital version to all you cult followers and new viewers. your'e welcome in advance! lol

the french version is still sold as "The missing link"

the american version (not being sold) is "B.C. Rock" with entirely different dialog and music.

I ask that anyone that can find one of the 100 or so copies of the usa dvd releases please share!
