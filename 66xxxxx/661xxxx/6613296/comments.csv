Thanks for this.
Do you or anyone know of a film similar to this....I believe its claymation about a caveman who evolves through time and is set to rock music?
I don't think there is any dialog only music.
Can't think of its title....it seems to me its similar to this. Saw it years and years ago on a vhs rental....been searching for years trying to find ANY info.
thanks"
,kornbred69,2011-08-18T22:21Z,"check out a google search for ""cult classics 80's claymation"" i remember seeing this as well but it beats me as to the name, and would probably be just as hard to find as this"
,vernernet,2011-08-19T00:07Z,"thanks for the reply.
i've been searching google for 3 yrs now....cant find any info at all. a real shame.....it was an excellent flick. i'll keep searching."
