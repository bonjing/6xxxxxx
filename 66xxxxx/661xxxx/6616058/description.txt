Armstrong Powerhouse presents a scenario pack dedicated to the popular class 57/0 by Oovee. This pack contains six prototypical scenarios which really allow you to give this locomotive a good work-out on a variety of workings from nuclear flask trains to freightliner services. Also, passing AI traffic offers realism, variety and interest through the use of various other locomotive and rolling stock packs so you can squeeze every last penny of value out of your previous purchases.

To further increase realism, each scenario uses the timetable of its relevant year to create an as realistic experience as possible. As well as this, most trains have their time of leaving, origin and destination so you can see which train is which!
