Microsoft DirectX is a group of technologies designed to make Windows-based computers an ideal platform for running and displaying applications rich in multimedia elements such as full-color graphics, video, 3D animation, and rich audio. DirectX includes security and performance updates, along with many new features across all technologies, which can be accessed by applications using the DirectX APIs.

The latest version of the Microsoft Windows Gaming API delivers Microsoft's powerful new High-Level Shader Language (HLSL) and features its most-advanced suite of design tools for the development of rich multimedia elements such as full-spectrum color graphics, video, 3-D animation and enhanced audio capabilities.

DirectX 9.0 introduces significant improvements across its suite of APIs. DirectSound offers new audio capabilities, DirectShow accelerates video rendering hardware, and Direct3D enhances low-level graphics programmability with new programmable vertex and pixel shader 2.0 models.
