,Pahvis,2011-09-06T23:41Z,Hopefully this works coz the audio desync is really disturbing me in the original video :/
,Pahvis,2011-09-07T00:09Z,"Well... Downloaded REALLY fast and there was a part where there wasn't any sound, which you did inform when it occured = it was intentional to fix the audio desync.

Overall great quality and nothing very important was lost during the mute part. So, i do recommend to download this if you, like myself, don't like the desync.

Excuse me for the shitty text but im really tired atm. Should go to bed D:"
