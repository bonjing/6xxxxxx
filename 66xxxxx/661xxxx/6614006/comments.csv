Thanks for the upload Totenkruez

Totenkruez: 
you don't happen to have ""NASCAR Dirt to Daytona"" do ya? I cannot find that game ANYWHERE; the only one here at TPB is bunk, no seeds (occasionally there is one, but never connects to any peers) even using magnet link with DHT, Local Peer Discovery, Peer Exchange and UDP all enabled.

Please, someone, anyone...upload ""NASCAR Dirt to Daytona"" :("
