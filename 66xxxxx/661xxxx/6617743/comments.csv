,technosailor,2011-10-15T00:55Z,"The Audio is MONO and low bitrate 41Kbps max 49Kbps, if you use AAC HE you can get 128Kbps and if you use HE v2 you can get 64Kbps, you're a dumbass."
,xjd77,2011-12-06T05:49Z,"I'd rather have a Star Trek obsession than a porn obsession. As for the audio quality - Season One was absolutely fine and I don't imagine that this will be any different. I'm setting my phaser to kill if I hear any more complaints. lol.

Cheers for this "
,xjd77,2011-12-06T06:31Z,"btw the porn quip is nothing to do with anyone here. i've got a soon to be ex-friend whose allowed what was downloading a few clips to turn into a full blown porn addiction. everytime I say something he says ""i don't care"". shame he's actually a graduate in computer studies - which goes to show that even an intelligent person can act like a knob-head. shame my phaser doesn't have a setting called ""re-educate"". keep it real dudes. "
,xjd77,2011-12-07T02:14Z,lol. update. my soon to be ex-friend said to me today that I should be a bit careful when I leave comments. Obviously keeping a closer eye on things then I imagined. Well nothings changed mate - I've been telling you to throw that porn in the bin because it affects your view of women. It's like when you meet someone who thinks dogfighting is ok. Oh really - not in my view. Still we all got to live together - evidently that's what it's about. Silence -moi - fuck it - fight for what you believe in thats what I say.  
,deim0n,2012-03-26T23:26Z,"FYI - The sound isn't mono, I could hear clear separation between left and right."
,xjd77,2012-04-01T21:28Z,"whoops. guess stuff thats playing on your mind comes out sometimes in comments. this great torrent wasn't the place to lay it down but I guess I was here saying what a great series this is when one thing led to another and the subconcious spewed it out. anyway if you care about your friends then you're bound to expend a lot of mental enregy on maintaining your friendships. people are free to choose what they do but I stick to what I said about it affecting your views on women. love over porn anyday. go on hold your girlfriends hand - you know you want to. 

BTW I rarely swear but I do believe if something or someone is getting you down then its better to say ""fuck it"" which helps you let go of the bad feeling which is better then 
keeping it bottled up.

Apologies to the uploader and seeders for the comment and sorry about the swearing on this great torrent. Keep up the good work everyone."
,Mahler2,2012-04-27T04:57Z,I would really appreciate subtitles. I have found subs for all the other ST series (all the seasons) but have not found a single subtitle that works with any of the ilpruny files. I am deaf and don't really want to take weeks to download the dvdrips. Any help would be very much appreciated. Thanks!
