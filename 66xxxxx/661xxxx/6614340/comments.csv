But when moving it into a torrent, why keep it that way?  All it does is encourage people not to seed.  In order to make use of it, people have to extract the original file themselves leaving the RARs on your HDD.  Sure, it's only an extra 350MB for this one, but when it becomes hundreds of similar torrents?  And what is the advantage of leaving it in RAR form?  Does it help with error correction?  Nope.  Making it faster?  Nope.  What does it help with?"
,tibalt,2011-08-19T08:10Z,"that's because some uploaders concern only about speed but not users' convinience(

same torrent but in single file is here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6614727"
,scothuman,2011-08-19T17:24Z,@erroneus:  Couldn't agree more.  I also fail to comprehend why sceneline would want to damage their reputation with anyone having more than a middling knowledge of computers.
,UAofE,2011-08-19T17:44Z,"RAR has zero effect on speed. The torrent system automatically break up a file into chunks. That means it breaks rars up into even more chunks.

The difference is, a torrent with a plain video stuck at 99% upload is completely watchable. A RAR stuck at 99% is completely useless."
