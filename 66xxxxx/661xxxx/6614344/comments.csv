ASAP releases are normally pretty decent, despite others' strangely high standards of what ""decent"" is.

If you're not sure, you could just check yourself. That's what the sample.avi is for... it's only 7MBs"

It's a complete gamble with ASAP, which makes ASAP useless.

Anyone rating a10/v10 is not qualified to rate. Even though it might be decent quality, 10 means absolutely perfect, and it is very rarely the case."
,spifkitten99,2011-08-19T12:11Z,"Quality is fine in this one.

Quality is as good as usual for a 175 meg, 21 min video."
