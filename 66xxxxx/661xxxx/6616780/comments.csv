,Strikefear13,2011-08-21T04:21Z,"Changelog
# Updated the default ""Slinger-style"" WASD controls to make the character move relative to the isometric perspective.
Note: In the previous update, this required using a commandline parameter ""-isomovement"", which is no longer necessary. To restore the original setting, use the new commandline parameter ""-orthomovement"".
# In-game menus now respond to right-clicking as well as left-clicking.
# Added support for resolutions greater than 1920x1080, at which visual issues with the background visuals could occur.
# Fixed several issues that were causing the game to crash for some players.
# Fixed an issue in Burstone Quarry that could cause players to get locked out of the level's final area.
# Fixed an issue in Mt. Zand that could cause players to get locked out of the level's final area.
# Fixed an issue in Zulten's Hollow that caused the level's weapon pickup animation not to play.
# Fixed an issue in the Bullhead Trial where the text stated that the Gold Prize requirement involved completing the trial having taken less than two hits instead of three.
# Fixed an issue causing the opening splash screens to overlap when running the game using the ""-nofixedstep"" commandline parameter, which unlocks the frame rate.
# Fixed a rare issue where weapon slots at the Arsenal could become unselectable."

,miguelsz3,2011-08-21T23:27Z,It should contain fixes from previous updates.

That wasn't few hits. Most of them are probably false but how can we be sure all are safe?

Anyone tried it for a while?"
