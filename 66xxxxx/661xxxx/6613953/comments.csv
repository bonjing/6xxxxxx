TiNYiSO! Game saves only at specific points, so
that may be why some people are having

Great torrent."
,xmaster408,2011-08-23T23:07Z,Hey guys if it stops working on launch go back and install the things it prompted you to install at the end of the game installation. I did and it worked fine!

-installed framework
-installed directx
-installed xna

game runs nicely, even though i haven't applied the crack yet.
now when i apply the crack, game just crashes from the start.

from the non cracked game, i got as far as the workmen ward, but now i cant click on the other locations to do the other missions.

can anyone else who encountered this help?"

,Chiitah,2012-06-04T12:39Z,"I very much know about false positives in Virus Scanners, and I normally run very top notch scanners that can tell the difference if something actually is a specific virus, or if it just is something that acts like / runs in the same way as a virus does.  The few times I've ignored it telling me that it found specific viruses and said to myself ""It's a scene release from a VIP source"" I've ended up putting viruses on my system.  This game isn't saying that it's finding files that run the same way as some virus or another, it's very specifically saying ""Here is that exact virus.""  Because of the quality of my scanner and the usual way it tells me if it's just a file that runs like a virus, or if it really is that virus specifically - when it tells me this thing has multiple viruses in it I just am going to have to listen to it...  We all have to take our own chances and make our own decisions but it's pretty rare that it's wrong (not impossible but rare)."
