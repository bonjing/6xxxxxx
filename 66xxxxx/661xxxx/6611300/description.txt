   A young lion prince is born in Africa, thus   
   making his uncle Scar the second in line to   
   the throne. Scar plots with the hyenas to     
   kill King Mufasa and Prince Simba, thus       
   making himself King. The King is killed and   
   Simba is led to believe by Scar that it was   
   his fault, and so flees the kingdom in shame. 
   After years of exile he is persuaded to       
   return home to overthrow the usurper and      
   claim the kingdom as his own thus completing  
   the "Circle of Life".
