,Netarangi,2011-08-20T08:58Z,Sweet cheers. Wanted a smaller sized one.. heard it's pretty shit and a shitty port so didnt want to waste 1.5gb
,alleasy23,2011-08-20T09:35Z,ty KaOs  
,nickelbackfan,2011-08-20T10:38Z,I have a problem. It installed fine but when i click on the .exe there comes a little window with no text in it and i can only click OK. after that nothing happens
,amit3945,2011-08-20T10:40Z,"Thanks..but why is the size almost 2.5 gigs?Most of the other torrents are around 1.4.
Also everytime I click on the exe it gives me a Internet access problem error.
Seems like internet IS required everytime you want to start the game.
Any idea how I can bypass that as well?"
,Netarangi,2011-08-20T11:13Z,Yep there's an error. Will try skidrow crack only and reply with results.
,smsheese,2011-08-20T11:51Z,did skidrow crack work??
,amit3945,2011-08-20T12:15Z,"Yup works for me.....
Install with KaOs
Extract Skidrow offline crack and overwrite all in the game folder
Run exe...and you are through....:-)"
,Netarangi,2011-08-20T12:22Z,"Nope.

Ffs why release a game without testing it? Seriously. Wastes everyones fuckin' time and bandwidth."
,Netarangi,2011-08-20T12:23Z,"Amit, link to crack you used."
,amit3945,2011-08-20T14:32Z,"It's on TPB
Link :

,llnation26,2011-08-20T14:56Z,"Game Doesn't work here, even with the crack still nothing. And i do nothing wrong..

-Clean installation
-Extracting crack ( Copying them in the game folder)

,anuzbitt,2011-08-21T04:32Z,update game first then overwrite....
,PaulAl,2011-08-21T13:38Z,"Works fine sofar:
1. install
2. run & let update
3. overwrite w/ offline fix
4. delete *.wav in BinPC (no longer needed)
5. Final size: 1.66 GB"
,gautamb42,2011-08-21T15:07Z,Works great thanks :)
,DangerDan43257,2011-08-21T15:21Z,"yeah this release worked fine first time for me without the need of a fix, n yeah they forgot to delete unneeded audio, check your releases guys but yes nice job spot on :)"
,Netarangi,2011-08-21T23:15Z,Bullshit. This DOES not work. Even with a clean install and the offline fix. Get a blank message
,DragonXG,2011-08-23T13:07Z,"After trying the SkidRow (and the Offline fix) and the Kaos releases, FD still didn't work.
Running From_Dust.exe just got a small blank dialog.
I found a way to generate the UbisoftGameLauncher command line parameters, and using the Orbit folder was able to get into the Launcher, use any code, but when clicked Play, FD crashed.
Look in the launcher Logs, use a Base64 converter for the path and put it together in a BAT.
I found FD looking for the UGL in D:\, regardless of the registry saying otherwise.
The solution... I put the FD folder onto a blank USB drive and the 'contents' of the Orbit folder into the root of the same drive.
Sorry, I cannot remember where I got the UGL.exe that accepts any code, but it wasnt from KaOs or the SkidRow cracks. I tried many combos, so am not sure what came from where.
From_Dust.exe then worked, started the Launcher, which accepted any code, and Play ran the game.
Oh... another thing, I also use a Mimo 7"" USB LCD, managed by DisplayFusion.
The game wont run with the second 'monitor' on. Dungeons (Kalypso Media) has the same problem.
Hope this helps all those not able to play. Good luck. "
,sansyeux,2011-08-23T14:10Z,"game works, but I have no audio, only in a few videos. does the audio work for anyone else?

well, did extraction did crash at some point but I thought it was because of one fo the extra installers.
anyhow thanks!

I 'm loving this game.
"
,sansyeux,2011-08-23T14:12Z,excuse my typos lol
,sansyeux,2011-08-23T14:28Z,kaosi. exe crashes - is this reason why audio isn't working?  it always crashes for me=
[V],gansuk,2011-08-23T15:01Z,@sansyeux yeah kaosi rebuilds the games audio.
,sansyeux,2011-08-23T17:07Z,"@gansuk

sorry to be a bother, I tried 4 times and then  restarted my PC, I tried again  and this  problem i56.tinypic(.)com/673952.png -still happens.

any tips to fix the situation?
"
,PaulAl,2011-08-26T12:36Z,"@sansyeux 
the tool MUST run within the BinPC folder (as done by the install batch file).
if running under vista/win7, chances are - running with admin rights - that it starts in your system directory...
2 suggestions:
a. add following just in front of arc commands:
%~d0
cd %~dp0
(ensures that it executes in your game folder)
b. open command box in BinPC, and perform Kaosi task manually (see batchfile for full command line)

cheers,
pol"
,sansyeux,2011-08-29T04:46Z,"@PaulAl 

thank you sir :D"
,Dude93,2011-09-01T17:33Z,"Dude you rock!!! I downloaded most of your games.
And i want to ask you ( if you can of course) upload MORTAL KOMBAT 9
Or 
Aliens Vs Predator 3
I'd bee very appreciated.
 Hope you see this"
,stealthsilent,2011-09-10T15:25Z,How would you generate the UbisoftGameLauncher command line parameters? All it does when I click on the ubisoftGameLauncher is tell me that it cannot be started directly. 
,erwin0629,2011-09-16T12:04Z,is this clean my anti virus detected it as a virus..
