,ili2882,2011-10-22T23:29Z,"@DjenabeT open up your upload slots and don't throtle your upload speed I'm uploading at 100k and downloading at 600 (I'm on an asymmetric DSL) and I get better speed from the leachers then from the seeders. I'll seed till 1/1 ratio, tanks meech.
ps. I recently watched a scene 350m rip of B5 and I've got to say that show needs a meech Rip, it was the best Sci-Fi of the 90's (not including tng) the only reason it's largly unknown is cos it was on PTN and the syndication rights are undeterment between Warner Bros TV and PTN (now disfunct)."

media player classic is decent but vlc player should play anything downloadable and installable from there website."
[V],meech,2011-12-11T23:11Z,"About Babylon 5...I watched most of it, but didn't finish it off.  I felt like I kept watching it just to see if it ever got better, then I finally gave up.  I thought the first season was pretty decent, after that...I dunno. Just didn't hook me in like other sci-fi shows.  I really wanted to like it, as it is pretty liked by the sci-fi community. But it is what it is.  Anyway, you probably won't see that ripped by me anytime soon since I usually post shows that I enjoy myself.  My apologies to the b5 fans out there."
,LondonLover,2011-12-18T05:44Z,Seriously people are fucking stingy im barely breaking 2kb on download even with 6 seeds start fucking seeding people!!
