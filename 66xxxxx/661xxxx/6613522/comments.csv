,rolls7s,2011-09-15T02:51Z,When registering use MESMERiZE (is blacklisted...) as your name.  Copy and paste it.  Use any reg. number from keygen.  That simple.  Don't make it more complicated than it is.  Works just fine thanks to the poster.

,Snurre__,2011-12-03T10:09Z,"Personally I think ""Peazip"" is the best file manager / file archiver plus in works equally well for Microsoft Windows as GNU/Linux.

You can find Peazip at: http://www.peazip.org/
