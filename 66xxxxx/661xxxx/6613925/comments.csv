The Russian version also has a high bitrate for a 720p."
,Jerrrryyyy,2011-10-12T17:05Z,Can you upload the theatrical version of this also? I like this movie much better with the Tangerine Dream soundtrack.
,ninline,2011-12-31T02:11Z,The theatrical version sucks.  The studio suits chopped and slashed Ridley Scott's movie into a mess.  You are the only person I've ever heard that prefers it.  My suggestion is buy the soundtrack to the theatrical version and enjoy Tangerine Dream by themselves.
