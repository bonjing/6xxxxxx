It's too soon to make any conclusions about the long-term effectiveness, but since I started I only had one day with pain, it was fairly mild, and the pain actually went away after I did the prescribed exercises for the first time.
I tested ""positive"" for a high right hip, and did only those exercises. I've been basically pain-free for the last 3 or 4 days, and I took another round of photos and it does appear that my hips are already more even. That makes me think that it's not just a lucky coincidence."
