Robert Nighthawk recorded for United on its first day of sessions and two of United's first five releases were by 'Robert Nighthawk And His Nighthawks Band'. He had a national hit in late '49 on Aristocrat and perhaps United had envisioned Nighthawk as its blues-singing slide guitar rival to Chess' Muddy Waters. Sales didn't pan out but to many he was the ultimate slide guitarist of the amplified blues era, one who influenced the likes of Muddy Waters, Elmore James and Earl Hooker. B.B. King cited Nighthawk as one of his 'Ten Favorite Guitarists' in 'Guitar Player' magazine. Today, more than 40 years after his death, Nighthawk is ranked among the greats in blues history.
Apart from the uncertain identity of the pianist, there is confusion within the band itself, typified by curiously disjoined but martial drum patterns and tentative piano chording on 'Crying Won't Help You' and 'Feel So Bad', although Nighthawk and bassist Knowling seem to be at one. Coordination improves with a rievived 'Take It Easy' and 'Kansas City', although the thrusting rhythm section, with Knowling's slapped and syncopated patterns prominent, pressurizes Nighthawk's normally laidback delivery. A pair of instrumentals, 'Nighthawk Boogie' and 'U/S Boogie,' both driven by Nighthawk's guitar and a romping piano, pretty much make this collection worthwhile and show the man in his peak form. Included on this collection are a pair of previously unissued tracks, an alternate take of 'Seventy-Four,' and a loud, crunchy, but, alas, unfinished version of 'The Moon Is Rising.' The sound is surprisingly clean and rich, especially given the 1951-1952 origins of the tapes.
