A landmark volume in science writing by one of the great minds of our time, Stephen Hawkingâ€™s book explores such profound questions as: How did the universe beginâ€”and what made its start possible? Does time always flow forward? Is the universe unendingâ€”or are there boundaries? Are there other dimensions in space? What will happen when it all ends?

Told in language we all can understand, A Brief History of Time plunges into the exotic realms of black holes and quarks, of antimatter and â€œarrows of time,â€ of the big bang and a bigger Godâ€”where the possibilities are wondrous and unexpected. With exciting images and profound imagination, Stephen Hawking brings us closer to the ultimate secrets at the very heart of creation.
