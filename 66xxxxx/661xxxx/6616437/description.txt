BBC Town with Nicholas Crane 1of4 Ludlow HDTV x264 AAC MVGroup

We live in one of the most urbanised countries on Earth. By 2030 a staggering 92 percent of us will be living the urban life. Congested cities sprawl across our map, but they are not the only way to live. This series celebrates the forgotten world of the town, smaller than a city, more intimate, more surprising. 

Part 1. Ludlow
An English market town on the Welsh border, Ludlow is small, landlocked and remote. Yet it has more listed buildings than anywhere else its size in Britain; not one, but two Michelin-starred restaurants; and a fairytale castle which was once the capital of Wales. Geographer and adventurer Nicholas Crane discovers how such a cut-off town came to be packed with so many treasures, and asks whether it really is as perfect as it first appears.
