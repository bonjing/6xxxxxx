Father, Son, Holy Ghost is the second full-length album by Girls, following the success of their 2009 debut (simply titled "Album") as well as their Broken Dreams Club EP, both of which received the Best New Music stamp by Pitchfork and were featured on the site's respective year-end best-of lists. It's set for release on September 13, 2011 and features the previously released six-and-a-half-minute track "Vomit." Enjoy it and don't forget to seed!

NOTE: It's possible that there is a sound error around six minutes into "Forgiveness." This album is still several weeks from release, I didn't leak it myself and this is the only version of it I've heard, so I have no idea as of yet whether or not this was intentional on the band's part (it certainly sounds like it could be). Either way, there have been two cases in the past in which I've uploaded albums to this site without noticing sound errors on certain tracks, so I just wanted to warn you about it ahead of time and assure you that I'm aware of it. Thanks!
