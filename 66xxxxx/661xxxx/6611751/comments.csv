,songsforbears,2011-09-10T03:38Z,"The glitch around 6 minutes into ""Forgiveness"" does not appear on the full streams of the album around the Internet. Very minor, so this'll due until I get the vinyl."
,poitras,2011-09-15T04:56Z,"Song titles are wrong:

track 4 is ""Saying I Love You"", not ""How Can I Say I Love You""

track 5 is ""My Ma"", not ""Myma""

track 10 is ""Love Like A River"", not ""Love Life""

Audio Quality is great (except for the glitch mentioned in the post before this one).

ALBUM IS AWESOME!"
