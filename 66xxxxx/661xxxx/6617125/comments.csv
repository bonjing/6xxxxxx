You have to kill him, you understand. This is Islam."" The film traces the links between the teachings and materials at the mosque and the Saudi Arabia religious establishment and examines the extent to which the Kingdom exports Wahhabi teachings around the world by ploughing billions of dollars into schools, mosques and charities.
