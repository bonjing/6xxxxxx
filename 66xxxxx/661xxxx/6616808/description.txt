This week the show took a look at a number of practices which, at first glance, seem to conform to conventional notions of evils in civil society: reliance upon private bounty-hunters instead of trained government police, blackmail, price-gouging, scalping tickets, and private currencies.

John and company attempt to lend the libertarian perspective to these naturally arising private practices and show how they could possibly be beneficial, rather than harmful.

The conventional wisdom may not be so.

(Inspired by the book, "Defending the Undefendable," by Walter Block.)

[uploader note: this recorded on 08-11. Stossel's blog suggested his show would be extended to two hours and have live analysis of the GOP presidential debates. My DVR did pick up some of this in a Stossel rebroadcast the next day, but the show turned out to be rehashed segments from his Campaign 2012 shows featuring Gary Johnson, Ron Paul, and Herman Cain. Therefore, I will make no listing of it.]
