,tommcd,2011-08-21T15:00Z,"Thanks again for continuing to upload the Stossel show. I work at night, so I don't always get to watch the show when it is on TV. "
[T],skJGZV6z,2011-08-23T05:10Z,"Okay yeah (I'm still getting up to speed), so I guess the 18th program was all about the GOP debate and had the rebroadcast cuts from the three ""candidate"" 2012 shows. So, no post for the 18th from me."
[T],skJGZV6z,2011-08-28T00:50Z,"Those interested: STOSSEL for 20110825 was a rebroadcast of the 20100111 show: Politically Incorrect. It's still listed here. As always, post a comment in the most recent episode if you can't get a seed on an archived STOSSEL listing."
