M - Cute glorification and completely delusional movie about being psychotic.  How ironic.
A bit week storyline and slow at times but I guess it was ok."

,useitright,2011-08-22T20:51Z,"I believe that he has said many times that you can start looking for new movies about a month before they release on dvd.  From what I am reading from 5 seconds of looking is that there isnt a dvd release date yet, but everyone thinks it will be July 1st.  I will start looking for it around a month before that, which is June 1st.  I do not see why you are trying to rush something like this anyway.  I am sure zone will have it out as soon as possible without everyone asking questions about it.  You are the man zone!!!!......and I am not stupid enough to ask for something from someone who already gives so much....put the movies out when your ready and I promise I will be waiting    "

,scottsasse,2011-08-25T20:04Z,"THANKS for the up and everything but damn thing has been downloading for two days now and only at 95% now. I don't get it, seems to have plenty of seeds!!"
,greylion,2011-08-26T15:50Z,"@scottsasse:
That's what you get, if you've turned off uploading or set it very low, or maybe you don't have an open port for the torrent client to recieve upload requests on.
Another possibility might be a slow internet connection, especially an upload speed like 256 Kbps or less. (Please notice that KByte/s and Kbit/s is not the same).
Check your router.
If it's that low, and you should have a higher upload to your ISP, per your subscription, tell customer service about it."

You moron. Great opinion there with nothing else to back up your statement than a final 'lol' - peanut.
There are some great aussie movies that were very big earnrs all over the world.
Romeo & Juliet - Mad Max - The Piano - Muriels Wedding - Romper Stomper - Wolf Creek - Gallipoli - Candy - Devils Playground - The Castle - Shine - Happy Feet -= Crocodile Dundee - The Matrix.
We just have 30 studios here pumping out celluloid crap on a daily basis."

,jwhud148,2011-09-10T01:39Z,"Jason ""Fuckin"" Stackhouse!
The guy who plays Griff in this movie is the actor who plays Jason Stackhouse on HBO's Trueblood! Thats fuckin awesome. I always wondered what else he has been in, but I'm just too lazy to look it up. I must admit it is weird watchin him act without his Southern USA accent (which he does extremely well, btw)."

,menander,2011-09-13T14:01Z,"Great rip, and thx for the UL, however only 1 thing I don't like, sometiems I use Undertexter/engsub.net and if REVELATiON also did that REVELATiON UL for sub and made the sub, then hes probably the worst suber I seen =/ and again thx for the UL
