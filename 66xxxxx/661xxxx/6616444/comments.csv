,Muharemus,2011-08-22T19:16Z,is anyone seeding?
,tyler45241,2011-08-23T01:35Z,I have been seeding for three days straight now... My bandwidth is limited by my ISP to only 100kb/s so it is taking a while but the more others seed what they have the faster it will go. Sorry TWC sucks so bad. :( 
,tyler45241,2011-08-24T04:57Z,By this time tomorrow I will have seeded to 100%! I will of course seed this indefinitely but there will be 1 to two more seeders by this time tomorrow.

sharing is caring!"
,spiff1003,2011-09-29T17:38Z,What a huge pile of videos!  But neither VLC nor Windows Media Player seems to be able to play them correctly.  What's wrong?  (Win 7 Ult)
,spiff1003,2011-09-29T17:49Z,"Nice pack of files, but my VLC won't play them... It halts after a short while.  Same with Media Player.  (Latest VLC, and Win 7 Ult and updated)"
,tyler45241,2011-10-02T05:46Z,"All I can say is make sure you have QuickTime installed and all the latest codecs. Most of these are *.mov files which you will need QuickTime's codec to watch. All I did was install QuickTime, then used VLC to play them. "
,spiff1003,2011-10-05T01:49Z,"Okay, thanks.  I kinda shun Apple-products, but...  Okay..."
,monster.x,2011-12-30T00:44Z,"if you download only one torrent this year, make sure it is this one. perfect girls, perfect quality. thanks a lot!

btw: this even plays on linux vlc"
,mespa,2012-04-20T20:53Z,"would like to find earlier windows version of Mia- love,sex,happiness. Has a great orgasm scene of her throbbing pussy. Quicktime version cut it out. Can anyone help?"
