end of the tutorial, you iâ€™ll be able to swap between the firmware just flashing a dump on your PS3
using Progskeet. (instead of downgrading and loosing all data).
The first steps are not so easy, so take your time and go on, by the way, you must have some skill
with Progskeet, and it must be 100% working on your console."
