 A bunch of people who had tried to commit suicide in the past woke up locked up in like a prison cell and with a distinctive burn pattern on their wrist. One psycho with a .45 controlled them, making them cast a single six sided dice "die" to choose the fate of the other. Will the dose be fatal or not? Some lived, some died. Those that died would be dumped off to make it look like a suicide. A Hispanic woman detective was trying to prove that her father wasn't a suicide but was murdered.
