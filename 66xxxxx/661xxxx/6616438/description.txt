"The Benefit of Keeping Your Ego in Check"

In an attempt to avoid a date with a nerdy co-worker, 
Sarah (Daneel Ackles) asks Aaron (Zachary Cregger) to 
bid on her at a charity bachelorette auction. 
Meanwhile, Ben (Ryan Hansen) accidentally uses a 
suggestive phrase with a co-worker getting himself 
accused of sexual harassment. Elsewhere, Fitz (Andre 
Holland) thinks he's in the clear to spend one last 
night partying before becoming monogamous, but when 
he finds out his girlfriend feels differently, he 
must scramble to cover up incriminating photos from 
his wild night.
