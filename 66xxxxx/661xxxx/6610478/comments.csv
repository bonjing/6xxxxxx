,n3os,2011-08-17T13:33Z,The end is missing??? WTF?
,UglyDucklingxyz,2011-08-17T16:08Z,"NOTE: Due to technical errors, Arena did not broadcast the elimination segment of the show. You can tell from the preview of next week's episode who was eliminated. You can also see the elimination segment online: "

,Fangular,2011-08-17T17:04Z,"Oh my god - I can't believe Arena did that! (Cos yeah - who ever cares about who's eliminated - on a reality competition show?! That's just an optional extra!) Seriously, that's one *massive* 'technical error' on their part. And yet they managed to screen the 'next week' segment (which in turn ruined the surprise of who's been eliminated).. what a disaster.

Anyway, thank you for explaining it, UglyDucklingxyz.. and for directing us to the official site so we can actually watch the ending. 

And finally, thanks again for uploading this - and it's a great quality upload too. You're the only person in the world who's done so, as far as I can tell, so it's very, very, very much appreciated. 

Thank you!"
