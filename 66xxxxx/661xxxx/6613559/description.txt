Portraits & Biographical Sketches of the United States Armyâ€™s Senior Officer. This volume offers a unique glimpse of the commanding generals and chiefs of staff who have led the United States Army in peace and war. Their rise through the levels of leadership to the pinnacle of their profession reveals both striking parallels and fascinating contrasts. As the authorâ€™s introductory analysis makes clear, their responsibilities have evolved over more than two hundred and thirty years. Although the essential elements of leadership remain unchanged, the complexity of technology and staff organization has increased radically over time. The format of this volume combines biographical sketches with the officially designated portraits of the commanding generals and chiefs of staff, accompanied by brief accounts on the artists. As an aspect of the art history that has continued for more than three centuries, these official portraits add an interesting and revealing dimension to the biographerâ€™s words.
