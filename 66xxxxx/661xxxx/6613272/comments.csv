,will9990,2012-01-25T00:36Z,"There seems to be a few glitches with the game.  It loads up great and works in single player mode, but whenever I try and go online and I have to download and install some other content it does not seem to work.  It has completely froze my mac twice having to do a force shut down holding the off switch.  And once it has frozen the app never opens up again I keep having to place in the trash and then re-unzipping the 7z file to get a new app file ha!  Im not sure whether the multiplayer downloads are interfering or they can't be installed because its slightly modded I'm not 100% how these things work.
But it really is great apart from this multiplayer glitch, which unfortunately is the only reason I downloaded it! Any advice? I am running on a mid 2009 mbp and run UT2004 on it fine online if that helps.
Thanks though it is a great torrent!!!"
