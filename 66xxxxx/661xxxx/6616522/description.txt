Three days in the lives of six friends who are nearly 30 years old, live in Grenoble, and have a rock band called the \"Why Notes?\". They \'re to play in Paris at Charles\'s school reunion. In getting to Paris and back, the characters interact with Aimee\'s ex-husband and her abrasive, cruel ex-mentor, Louise\'s would-be lover who turns out to have a husband, Mickey\'s long-time lover and her children, Bertrand\'s Germanic wife and their children who speak no French, and Frederic\'s distant mother. The band also meets Clara, a mercurial free spirit who beguiles Bertrand, then Mickey, then takes up with someone else in the band.
