As a fully fledged Derbyshire boy I thought I should share this album for all the folk fans out there.

Fleet Arts and Derbyshire Cultural and Community Services have worked together to produce â€˜Mills and Chimneysâ€™, a series of concerts across Derbyshire which celebrate the countyâ€™s historical past through song. 

The project has been coordinated by singer-songwriter David Gibband has brought together a group of musicians from all ages and backgrounds. As well as the concerts all the songs â€“ which were written as part of the â€˜Mills and Chimneysâ€™ project - have been recorded for a CD which will be for sale at all of the events. All the musicians, who regularly perform locally, have joined forces to work together as a group for the first time. They are David Gibb, Lucy Ward, Julian Butt, Sarah Matthews, Elly Lucas and Mike Smith. 

David Gibb the project co-ordinator, says; â€œWe are really pleased to be working with Derbyshire Libraries and to be involved in this yearâ€™s Literature Festival. This is a really exciting opportunity and experience for all involved. Itâ€™s a one off event and is not to be missed!"
