Lousy title, great album. Johnson hasn't been based out of Chicago in years, but that sound remains at the heart of his approach -- even when he's recording in Louisiana with a funky New Orleans rhythm section (bassist George Porter, Jr. and drummer Herman Ernest). Jump blues in the form of Buddy Johnson's "A Pretty Girl (A Cadillac and Some Money)," the Magic Sam tribute "Hard Times (Have Surely Come)," the solo acoustic "Get Up and Go," a soul-slanted "Every Woman Needs to Be Loved" -- Johnson smokes 'em all. ~ Bill Dahl
