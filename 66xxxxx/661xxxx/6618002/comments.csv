,mikel403,2011-11-18T12:29Z,"starting to download the game, though i have no idea on how to install it.. i do know how to use rar files..
so do i just extract all in 1 folder? or is there something else? help?"
,RtKGamez,2012-02-08T03:01Z,"@mikel403 you might need an Img Mount program like DaemonTools or MagicDisc
i use MagicDisc coz its free and a lot less hassle than DeamonTools in my opinion"
,RtKGamez,2012-02-08T03:03Z,i already have the game so im mostly here to say Thanks for the Premiums!!
,gamertm,2012-02-23T06:39Z,"@Ethramous
