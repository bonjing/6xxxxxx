This Torrent contains the GOG release of Neverwinter Nights Diamond Edition. The Diamond edition contains the original game, the â€œShadows of Underemntideâ€ expansion, the â€œHordes of the Underdarkâ€ expansion, and three of six premium modules; â€œKingmakerâ€, â€œShadowguardâ€, and â€œWitch's Wakeâ€. I've taken the liberty of including the other three as-well; â€œInfinite Dungeonsâ€, â€œPirates of the Sword Coastâ€, and â€œWyvern Crown of Cormyrâ€. BioWare decided to drop module support from their online store entirely. A sad story for the respective developers of three then near complete modules; â€œDarkness over Daggerfordâ€, â€œHex Codaâ€, and â€œTyrants of the Moonseaâ€. The story grows sadder still when you think on any player foolish enough to pay BioWare money for modules that may not have been backed up and will never be able to download their merchandise from an official server again.

The GOG bonus content provided a soundtrack, the design from the original bonus cloth map, and some wallpaper. After scouring the internet I took the liberty of including more wallpaper of the hotness that is Lady Aribeth. The Lexicon seemed a perfect companion for the Worldbuilder Guidebook, a very hard to find PDF from a now very dead torrent, so lucky you! You get the guide book to the Neverwinter Connections community, and instructions on how to disable the lame intros. As tempted as I was to include the Community Expansion Pack, it's just to dang big and is not so hard to find. But I highly recommend downloading it as soon as your done with this torrent!

I tested the game myself. The first time I launched it it crashed, but after that everything was fine. I tested the Premium Modules to see if they would authenticate properly, they seem OK to me. But if you have any problems and you end up solving them, make sure to post the results so everone can know.

If you don't already have WinRAR or a PDF viewer then don't come winning to me.
