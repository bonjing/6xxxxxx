,rupturesan,2011-10-02T02:20Z,Totally my fault!  I moved and I haven't been able to restore my server.  I hope I can do it today.
,Sagus,2011-10-12T10:29Z,"Could the uploader, at least, tell us if they aren't going to seed anymore, so we all don't just hang there pointlessly at 43,3%?"
,kursat,2011-11-05T15:40Z,Come on people everyone wants to download but no one is seeding? dont hit and run..
,yobar23,2012-03-16T16:23Z,Is this some evil joke?  Both Doc Martin multi-season torrents uploaded by rupturesan have not one byte of info available.
