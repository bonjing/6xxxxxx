,sarsapil,2011-08-20T07:48Z,"The English subtitles you added when ripped to normal srt subs, become gibberish, the letters in the image sub are too close together and the OCR misreads them, can't you provide proper English subs so we can watch it and understand what they're saying? Otherwise it's useless, except for Icelanders..."
,aajkd,2011-08-21T04:34Z,What about watching it with the provided subtitles instead of ripping them to srt? Works fine with most media players
