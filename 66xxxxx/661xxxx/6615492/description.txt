     LENNY KRAVITZ
     BLACK AND WHITE AMERICA

     For his ninth album, Lenny Kravitz found much of his inspiration
     close to home. In fact, the very spirit of BLACK AND WHITE AMERICA
     came from the locations in which the music was madeÃ¹from a tiny, 400
     -person community in the Bahamas to the streets of Paris. And out of
     his experiences as a true citizen of the planet, his first new songs
     in three years became the most personal and diverse collection of his
     career. "No doubt, my environment definitely lends a lot to the
     creative process," he says.
