,DarkSamus,2011-08-20T06:54Z,"Damn it!

I can't edit it either to put it in the PC games section :("
,DarkSamus,2011-08-20T07:17Z,"Also...

In the description it should say

""Sims Store DLC up to August 2011"", not May 2011."
,tiethel,2011-08-20T12:16Z,"this is a great torrent, thanks. and I was surfing around to find something like this, really thanks :))
but its not seeding at the moment, hope we'll get more seeds."
[H],BigNoise,2011-08-20T14:49Z,"moved to Games/PC.

this is to large - with a piece size of 8MiB it will distribute veeery slooowly.
torrents of this size require a fast seedbox-service."
,zephyr_88,2011-08-23T13:12Z,"This sucks, none of the files are complete"
,DarkSamus,2011-08-24T06:00Z,"Sorry for the SLOOOW speed that took to get uploaded! 

An hour shy of 4 days at my nets max speed of 175KB/s average ;)

Anyway, I hope you all can help to SEED like hell."
,robsta612,2011-08-25T18:06Z,Hey can has anybody found any kind of viruses in these games ?
,DarkSamus,2011-08-25T18:54Z,"You will likely take my opinion with a grain of salt, but...

If any anti-virus software picks up a ""virus"" it would certainly be a false positive due to the crack files or keygens contained.

The disks are all popular scene releases.

Sims 3 - Razor Release
Sims 3 World Adventures - Reloaded Release
Sims 3 High End Loft Stuff - ViTaLiTY Release
Sims 3 Ambitions - ViTaLiTY Release
Sims 3 Fast Lane Stuff - ViTaLiTY Release
Sims 3 Late Night - Reloaded Release
Sims 3 Outdoor Living Stuff - Fairlight Release
Sims 3 Generations - Reloaded Release
Sims 3 Town Life Stuff - Reloaded Release

Hope that helps some."
,robsta612,2011-08-25T19:26Z,Thanks dude ! hey I have the sims 3 and the ambitions already do I have to download them again and follow your instructions ? Or what should I do ?  Please help me add the rest of the expansions a 1000 thanks!
,DarkSamus,2011-08-25T19:44Z,"You will certainly be fine to just use the ones you have now.

I would however un-install the ones you have and re-install following my instructions for installing everything.

The reason for this is the game/expansions do not like being installed in the wrong order for most people.

So, if you have the image files still for those 2, then certainly skip them in the download and follow my instructions to install again in the correct order ;)"
,robsta612,2011-08-25T23:46Z,"Thanks for your help dude if I find this torrent working properly and clean of viruses I'll be sure to seed !! :)
Good Luck"
,robsta612,2011-08-28T01:15Z,Hey dude help me out here what are we supposed to do with the patches ?
,DarkSamus,2011-08-28T01:30Z,Just double-click on each games matching patch to update after installing each expansion/stuff pack and it will install itself
,robsta612,2011-08-28T12:46Z,"Thanks for the help !
One more thing I never found this:
C:\Documents and Settings\username\My Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Downloads"
,psychomom1974,2011-08-28T15:19Z,I am also not finding this folder C:\Documents and Settings\username\My Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Downloads  I am running Windows Vista if that's any help.
,DarkSamus,2011-08-28T18:04Z,"Go to my documents and create the path from there yourself

So in my Documents create a folder called ""Electronic Arts""

In that folder create another called ""The Sims 3""

Finally create one last folder in there called ""Downloads""

Do the above and your done!!"
,DarkSamus,2011-08-28T18:10Z,"Here is a picture guys to show you the path if your still confused.

http://img21.imageshack.us/img21/760/imagekwm.png"
,DarkSamus,2011-08-28T18:19Z,The reason I wrote it different in the description is because a LOT of people are still using XP and that's the correct path for XP and older machines.
,robsta612,2011-08-29T01:56Z,"How do I do that man how do I create a path? 
and how will it be linked to the game??"
,supersonicBOOM,2011-08-29T04:01Z,this is 40 fuc*ing gigs dont get it
,DarkSamus,2011-08-29T07:27Z,"@robsta612

Go to my documents

Right click your mouse and choose ""create new folder"" and name it ""Electronic Arts""

Then inside that folder create another called ""The Sims 3""

In the ""The Sims 3"" folder create one last one called ""Downloads"" and place the files in there.

The Sims 3 knows already to look for that folder ;)

@SuperSonicBoom

How do you expect it to be shrunk and not have stuff removed from the games?"
,robsta612,2011-08-29T14:24Z,"One more thing , I cant get this done right :
 Run Sims 3 using Town Life Stuff.exe and go to downloads and
install Riverview, Barnacle bay and the 2 buildings


It asks me for a sims 3 account ? wouldn't they know that my game is bootlegged?"
,josunman1324,2011-08-29T14:45Z,need...mooare....seeeed!
,josunman1324,2011-08-29T14:46Z,more seeeds!
,DarkSamus,2011-08-29T14:54Z,"You can install them without creating an account.

NEVER CREATE AN ACCOUNT OR ALLOW THE GAME TO UPDATE!

If you can't install them that way, just go to the folder I told you to place those files in and double-click each file to install them."
,dollbaba,2011-08-31T13:08Z,"hey, just have a question:
does this work, with hidden springs?"
,DarkSamus,2011-09-01T00:35Z,"Yes, I have added Hidden Springs to my game since releasing this without issue.

Just double-click the Hidden Springs file and it will install"
,dollbaba,2011-09-01T15:32Z,Thanks! :) Can't wait to play it!
,Quesse,2011-09-04T10:28Z,"I've been looking for a compilation like this for months! You never know which release is going to work with which expansion so this is brilliant.
But wow... 40 gigs and 2.6kb/s download. I'll try to seed as much as I can (if I can get it that is).
Thanks!"
,elf_Iorveth,2011-09-06T19:17Z,"SEE MORE PLEASE, Look yeah im still gunna get it but 22 seeds? Come on dont fail me fellow pirates"
,BlazingTundra,2011-09-07T23:17Z,"So,I know I'm a noob for this but how to we actually install the expansion packs? Do we just unzip the rar file and execute it? Or is there some burning/mounting/iso stuff going on? (That sort of stuff always confuses me/scares me away from torrenting games -_-) Help appreciated and either way,you rule DarkSamus!"
,DarkSamus,2011-09-08T04:05Z,"@BlazingTundra
You need to mount them.
I use Daemon Tools lite myself.

Sorry for the slow reply, I have been quite busy the past few days."
,DarkSamus,2011-09-08T04:06Z,After unraring them first of coarse ;)
,BlazingTundra,2011-09-08T16:05Z,"Awesome! Got the torrent downloaded (and seeding of course). So a quick question,I already have a legal discless Sims 3 installed installed. Will that conflict at all with these expansions? And since I've never used Deamon tools or mounted anything before,would you mind giving a more step by step instruction? I understand if you don't want to do that and I'm being a needy git,I just really want to make sure this goes off without a hitch!"
,DarkSamus,2011-09-08T23:05Z,"Not sure how you would go with using the sims 3 version you have already sorry.

After installing Daemon tools and letting it create a virtual drive or 4 you...
1/ Go to the daemon tools icon in the notifications area of your taskbar and right-click it.

2/ Go to ""Virtual Devices"" and let the mouse sit there for a second and more options will show...

3/ Highlight any of the virtual drives shown and again let the mouse sit there for a moment and one last set of options will appear...

4/ Choose ""Mount Image"" and then choose the the disc image you need to mount...

5/ Very shortly after you will see the disc load up and your ready to install it.

6/ Follow the steps I give in the readme and most of all...

HAVE FUN"
,BlazingTundra,2011-09-11T06:45Z,"I keep getting a disc authorization fail when i run the game with town life.
Things I didn't that I wasnt sure of:
I just copied the files in the town life crack bin to the sims game bin folder
-i couldnt find the townlife.exe file so i just ran it from the launcher.
-didnt install the mods folder

Other than that I followed the instructions to a T. Do you know what I couldve done with,DarkSamus? Or anyone?"
,BlazingTundra,2011-09-11T06:55Z,"Slight update. I ran the game through the TS3W.exe,screen went black for awhile,and then when I got the message that basically my game had unofficial modifications that could screw up my game,and it asked me if I wanted to continue or quit.I chose quit for the time being. Anyone know whats going on?"
,DarkSamus,2011-09-11T07:18Z,"Last time that happened to someone they accidently let the launcher software update the main game to version 1.24.

Only way to fix it is to uninstall everything and when you finally get to the launch game stage disable auto-updating."
,EmMur,2011-09-13T13:49Z,"Do you need disc for this download? When I try to start the game ""Disc Authentication Failure"" keeps coming up"
,Aresfour,2011-09-15T05:16Z,"i keep getting 

(Disc Authorization Failure)

please!! help me, what do i do?!!? im using (Virtual CloneDrive 5.4.5.0

get back at me asap plz, tnx"
,Aresfour,2011-09-15T05:27Z,"btw, do i HAVE to install the whole thing to play? cause im getting the invalid disc thing even without all the expansions"
,Aresfour,2011-09-15T06:14Z,ive re'installed it 4 times.. its not working man.. i made sure auto update is off and everything.. still getting disc invalid stuff.. get back at me asap plz.. thank you.. lol
,stannwigg,2011-09-16T17:48Z,"I'm getting the same Disc Authorization Failure too. I know it's mounted ok, it loads right up to the point of being able to play then gives same message.
I've only got as far as mounting the base game and this happens. Any ideas? I thought I'd turned off auto-update too.
Thanks for any help."
,stannwigg,2011-09-16T18:17Z,"Ok, so just uninstalled, reinstalled. Definitely have updates turned off but still get same message.

So I guess as someone else asked, do we have to install ALL of it to get it working? Or have I missed something? Am DYING to get this running, really appreciate the download. 

But, help! :o)"
,stannwigg,2011-09-17T01:27Z,"***UPDATE***
Ok, it's working. I followed instructions to the letter, didn't try to get any games to work until I'd done IT ALL.

There were a few little oddities along the way. Two games wanted to update, but I either said No, or pulled my net connection and said Yes. This didn't seem to cause any problems...

So it's working perfectly. I'm astounded and massively grateful!

I do have one really dense question though. I can only seem to run through Town Life, or rather, whichever game I choose, only Town Life starts. Am I being thick? How do I play (for example) Generations? OR, are all the expansions incorporated into the end result (Town Life) - I haven't had the chance to play around in depth with it yet so unsure.

Long day. Sorry. And thanks."
,stannwigg,2011-09-17T13:27Z,"Final Update
It's all working perfectly.

Seeding."
,Pachucki11,2011-09-26T21:45Z,I have followed the instructions but world adventures has a region code error and when i load sims towns life it only displays the cursor on a black screen and the background sound. Help. PLEASE. It took me 4 days to download this..
,Cowtan,2011-09-29T04:22Z,"I downloaded everything I wanted.
Just Sims 3 and the Stuff packages not the expansions. 

I started the game with Townstuff and got Disc Authorization Failure message. 
Unfortunately I forget exactly what I did to fix it but I either went through and made sure the cracks were in the right places.  I believe Sims 3 original game has a crack you need to put in too.

Also make sure you go through all the updates in the torrent.

Should work fine after that!


QUESTION!
*** I have a question though, I'm going to buy Pets when it comes out next month, if I DL it with the cd will it work fine with these?  and will I then have to continue to use the CD to play the game? ***

Thanks everyone for you're continued support with the torrent!!"

  Im not sure what i did wrong i followed all the instructions. was getting ready to verify that the towns worked and i got that message ... PLEASE HELP"
,Azendi,2011-10-16T12:08Z,"Thanks, this is great, DLing at between 800kb/s to 1.5 mb/s.

Question though... When Pets is out sometime this week, will we have to re-install all this and apply the new x-pac after + watch the patches, or will the recent release mean that it's just to install + use given crack?

Thanks!"
,v1c0d1n,2011-10-20T19:27Z,"currently downloading this now...but im not gonna download all 40gb of it, just needed some expansion that i dont have so i need more seeders for this one...."
,hoosaid10,2011-12-20T00:29Z,Will this work for Mac?
