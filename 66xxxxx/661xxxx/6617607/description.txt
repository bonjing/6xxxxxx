Possible One Of the best Break-core/Breakbeat electronica in the world. Each album is very different from eachother. some are very intense, some are chill and some would drive a normal person to complete insanity its so good. i think the rambient works 2002 is my fav. and then either girls love breakcore or master p. on atari. there all pretty good.
