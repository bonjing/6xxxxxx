UNLOCK / UNBLOCK ANY WEBSITE BY TOR BROWSER!!!
The Tor software protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location, and it lets you access sites which are blocked.
The Tor Browser Bundle lets you use Tor on Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux without needing to install any software. It can run off a USB flash drive, comes with a pre-configured web browser, and is self-contained. The Tor IM Browser Bundle additionally allows instant messaging and chat over Tor.
Once Tor is ready, Firefox will automatically be opened. Only web pages visited through the included Firefox browser will be sent via Tor. Other web browsers such as Internet Explorer are not affected. Make sure that it says "Tor Enabled" in the bottom right corner before using it. To reduce the risk of confusion, don't run Firefox while using the Tor Browser Bundle, and close existing Firefox windows before starting.
If you installed the Tor IM Browser Bundle, the Pidgin instant messaging client will also be automatically opened.
Once you are finished browsing, close any open Firefox windows. For privacy reasons, the list of webpages you visited and any cookies will be deleted. With the Tor Browser Bundle, Vidalia and Tor will automatically close. With the Tor IM Browser Bundle you need to also close Pidgin by right-clicking on the Pidgin icon (7), and choosing Quit (. Remember that Tor anonymizes the origin of your traffic, and it encrypts everything inside the Tor network, but it can't encrypt your traffic between the Tor network and its final destination. If you are communicating sensitive information, you should use as much care as you would on the normal scary Internet â€” use HTTPS or other end-to-end encryption and authentication.
