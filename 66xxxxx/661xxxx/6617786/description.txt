Town (BBC)

Sociopolitical Documentary hosted by Nicholas Crane, published by BBC in 2011 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

We live in one of the most urbanised countries on Earth. By 2030 a staggering 92 percent of us will be living the urban life. Congested cities sprawl across our map, but they are not the only way to live. This series celebrates the forgotten world of the town, smaller than a city, more intimate, more surprising.


1)  Ludlow 
An English market town on the Welsh border, Ludlow is small, landlocked and remote. Yet it has more listed buildings than anywhere else its size in Britain; not one, but two Michelin-starred restaurants; and a fairytale castle which was once the capital of Wales. Geographer and adventurer Nicholas Crane discovers how such a cut-off town came to be packed with so many treasures, and asks whether it really is as perfect as it first appears.

2)  Scarborough 
A Yorkshire coastal town, Scarborough has had more ups and downs than a roller-coaster. It once had the biggest fish fair in Western Europe, it was a leading health spa and holidaymakers flocked to Britain's first seaside resort. Geographer and adventurer Nicholas Crane finds out what has happened to the town since its heyday and whether our fondness for foreign holidays has left this port high and dry.

3)  Perth 
The gateway to the Scottish highlands, Perth is a town packed with history. It has been a royal burgh since 1124, has survived a regicide within its walls and rebuilt itself after devastating floods. It is also a town that wants to be a city, and geographer and adventurer Nicholas Crane is on a journey to find out why, what benefits that brings, and what the town has to do to achieve its ambition.

4)  Totnes 
A Saxon river town in South Devon, Totnes is one of the UK's oldest towns. It has seen tough times through its long history, but adversity has taught it to innovate. Nicholas Crane visits the home of one of the greatest social experiments of the 20th century, and uncovers the test bed for an ambitious new idea that aims to change our urban life forever.
