"The Benefit of the Right Track"

Sarah (Danneel Ackles) struggles to get off the 
"Booty Call Track" and onto the "Relationship Track" 
with paramedic Evan (Ryan McPartland), while Ben 
(Ryan Hansen) works toward the opposite with a girl 
he met over the weekend. Back at the loft, Fitz, 
(Andre Holland) humiliated by Aaron's (Zach Cregger) 
extravagant gift on their "Roommate-aversary," tries 
to take Aaron on a fun, low-cost night out.

19/Slow
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
