,djsteve00,2011-08-19T04:45Z,is this with the hole cards showing?
,craziausi,2011-08-19T05:02Z,"espn rip -  dont think so, they ruined the show for me, i didnt even watch it all because of that crap ..."
,Trench000,2011-08-19T05:36Z,"Yes, this Main Event Part 1 is the beginning of the non-live, 100% edited and produced, ""normal"" coverage with Lon and Chad announcing and all hole cards showing & instant stats since its produced in advance.

Now if only I hadn't wasted 18GB of bandwidth downloading all the live coverage before realizing they were doing WSOP differently this year..."
,craziausi,2011-08-19T06:31Z,How is this one ? Antonio was doing the comentry in the other one ? which i downloaded too ? so same show different editing but same results ?
,Trench000,2011-08-19T13:37Z,"If you have watched and liked WSOP coverage by ESPN in previous years, then this is the start of the episodes you want for 2011.

The ""other WSOP 2011 coverage by ESPN"" (the episodes that are up to three hours long each & have Lon with different rotating pro players as commentators) is actually live hour-by-hour coverage ESPN did for the first time this year while the WSOP was in progress.

If they never broadcast live again, it won't be too soon for me.

,djsteve00,2011-08-20T10:46Z,"YES hole cards are shown, great!"
,dhavhid,2011-08-21T01:00Z,"but, this is from day 3, where are day 1 and 2??"
,FromHereOn,2011-08-21T03:44Z,BoardinGG is the best UL'er on the web!  Thanks for being the first one to put this up!
,mic76,2011-08-23T13:09Z,"4 some reson they have desided to start att day 3  this year. So sry dhavhid, no day 1 or 2!"
,DngnRdr,2011-08-30T04:08Z,Awesome... downloaded part 1 of the live myself and when I started to watch I was wrecked.... half the enjoyment of watching tv poker IMO is seeing how they play their hole cards.. if you don't know what they are till the end it's hard you have to reqind and rewatch to see why they did what they did... arggh! Anyway... thanks!!
