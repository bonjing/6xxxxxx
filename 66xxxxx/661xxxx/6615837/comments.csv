,macthemikey,2011-09-14T07:16Z,"For those who argue that there's Chinese dialog because ""duh, it happens in China"" or some such nonsense, NO. It's in Chinese because it's a TS (obviously, and not any ridiculous V-10; more like a V-6) and the audio is spliced in from some other source (also not A-10; more like A-5).

Should've checked the comments when I dl'd this. Go look for a better copy; this is not the rip you're looking for. Move alone."
,aliduman,2011-09-25T14:47Z,V-6 --- NOT a scr GRR
,iTooth,2011-09-28T18:02Z,"Well, downloading now... Thank you to the person who uploaded, and to all the seeders... From what I've seen among the comment section, the quality is bad and there is asian chatter... lol... Well, I'll see what it's like when it's finished :) Thanks"
,Sojin,2011-10-01T06:07Z,"for all the haters commenting about the ""asian chatter"" it's 2 separate instances of *maybe* 10-15 seconds, if you can't live with it, wait for the official release, i had no issues with it. 

great up, much appreciated."
,quickman80,2011-10-16T15:45Z,Be careful on this torrent. I just got a letter from my ISP.
