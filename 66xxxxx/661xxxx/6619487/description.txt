Synopsis:
Julian Sands, Saffron Burrows, Kelly MacDonald and Jonathan Rhys Meyers star in this ground-breaking film from the director of Leaving Las Vegas. Weaving together four stories of love, regret, and redemption, THE LOSS OF SEXUAL INNOCENCE is an eye-opening look at the power of sex to shape or shatter our lives. By turns erotic, hypnotic, revelatory and revolutionary, Mike Figgis' underground hit is 'a ravishingly beautiful and highly distinctive film' (Kevin Thomas, LOS ANGELES TIMES) that is sure to open your mind and your heart.
