B. This is the dullest, most dragged out single scene (not really a movie at all) I have ever sat through. 10 minutes in I was begging him to just shoot himself. Horrible attempt at a movie."

If you didnt like this movie obviously your part of the majority of movie-going-morons who like things like transformers and anything else Michael Bay makes. Mindless ""entertainment only"" movies are ruining the industry."
