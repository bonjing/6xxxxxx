Because landscape photographers are at the mercy of quickly changing weather, uneven illumination, poor contrast or limited tonal range, and other elements, this book shares the skills and techniques needed to turn these liabilities into assets. It explores types of landscape photography, explains what equipment works best, and describes how to find a balance between creativity and technique. It tells how to see the palette of natural light and the tonalities that make for outstanding photography and discusses focus, depth of field, and controlling tonalities in black- and-white landscapes.
