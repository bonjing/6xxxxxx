,x80x,2011-08-21T11:55Z,"Great quality. The movie itself is quite poor. Some bad acting and A LOT of ideas/scenes and even dialogue is stolen from Predator(s), but with no alien hunter."

[V],extremezone,2011-08-21T22:08Z,i want to see attack the block aswell but let's wait for some good sources first
,chuckmamuck,2011-08-21T22:35Z,"thanks for replying extreme. we know as soon as a legit copy becomes available you'll be the first to up it for us.
 i think we're all just getting a bit impatient, especially as its supposed to be awesome and one of the movies of the year. its been in the cinemas for months now so its a bit weird that its not become available yet.
there's alot of us looking forward to the day you get your hands on it bro. cheers "

It's bad enough you are to lazy and poor to get up off your fat ass and have to watch a movie for free that you didn't even work to get uploaded for everyone to use, it's even worse that you can't type in www.imdb.com and look up the fucking movie.. how hard is it to type battleground in the search you lazy bastard! 
@ Extremezone
Major props, always a fan and always will be. thank you for your work."

I give the stunt men starring as actors in this movie a 7 mainly because it's better than the 1001 reruns on cable, including pay cable today.Not bad for an afternoon diversion."
,Memeth_Astrodog,2011-08-25T19:16Z,"AndreLinoge

Shut the fuck up, you lazy piece of shit and go get raped by your father.

Agree with the others, what a crap film."
,reev3r,2011-09-07T12:33Z,"Seriously? Do you guys have to be a bunch of losers and just insult each other? Can we not just get some torrent quality comments here?

Thank you to those that actually understand solidarity and made good comments! Not downloading because of the ""bad movie"" comments...

@AndreLinoge: Really? Are you seriously that lazy that you are going to be a bitch about an IMDB link? Hint: Open browser tab, type google.com, type ""Battleground IMDB"", click first link... HOLY SHIT so difficult... Also, be a little more original than ripping off SK, couldn't come up with ANYTHING more original than AL?

Sorry for the gripe everyone..."
,ashen77,2011-09-10T20:48Z,^^ dont lie... your not sorry at all!!!
,st0gey,2011-09-11T11:52Z,"A - 7

Pic & sound are fine. DVD quality or thereabouts, not that you'd ever want to waste a DVD on it.

Movie is a dismal piece of cliche driven, 3rd rate garbage. The premise (bank robbers hideout in woods only to find they've become targets for a psychopathic Vietnam vet who, picks them off in increasingly gruesome ways) is barley plausible and very, very badly executed. 
The casting is a joke (acting is so bad even Brad Pitt could've done better!). The script is piss-poor, the dialogue is little more than a string of tired, old cliches that make the characters seem like parodies of themselves! Actually, they seem like parodies of the characters from Michael Mann's masterpiece, 'Heat'. They even ripped off a bit of that script (end of telephone conversation at 6:53). 
Honestly, all this movie needed was Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. They could've kept the script, marketed it as a comedy and watched the money roll in.


extremezone - just want to say, thanks very much for going to the trouble of uploading these movies. I might not like them all but i am very grateful for the opportunity to watch them. Thanks again! - st0gey"
