,jcbycroft,2011-08-19T03:35Z,"I will literally war with you for the next five years. Seriously. I'm not joking. I mean literally every day when you log on you will see me building an army and attacking you. Until every resource is returned to me. So I hope you are prepared to deal with that. I've been here several years now. I'm in the top 100 on almost every single stat. I have nothing better to do then mess with you. I asked you to donate. You did not even reply nor did you donate. Another player on the same island asked the same of you. You did not comply. You come to this island with no intentions of helping, but max out your workers. How is that fair to us I ask you. Then you respond with a rookie coward move and ask your alliance to rescue you? For what? From not donating? So like I said, literally every day you will see my name in your military advisor until each and every resource is returned to me. Enjoy the rest of your game."

,ashen77,2011-08-20T16:22Z,"lol, you know jcbycroft  is spending FAR to much time on his PC when he cant tell the difference between his game and piratebay.

Cheers for the up X"
,Psynaut00,2011-08-20T19:47Z,"Audio and visual are fine.  The movie sucks, unless you like horror movies where people do ridiculously stupid things that no actual person would ever do in order to push the plot forward.

*SPOILER ALERT*
Here is an actual example:  After walking into a camp of armed (AK-47) pirates with no weapon, and continuously provoking them to a physical conflict, the couple leaves, only to return a few hours later to search the camp when the  pirates are not not in it.  The boyfriend then leaves his girlfriend... literally,  in the pirate's campsite, without having any idea where the pirates went, to swim out to the pirate's boat and search it for clues.  Gee, can you guess what happened to the girlfriend???  

Idiotic movie, storyline, and dialogue."
,xShadyImagex,2011-08-21T00:57Z,"Yeah.... The quality is great, but the movie was HORRIBLE... It's easy to find good comedy/action movies, but hard to find good thriller/horror movies... This is NOT a good movie in GENERAL... Probably one of the worst movies I've seen in my life, and I've seen a LOT.... A:10 V:10 M:-20 (MINUS 20)"
,xShadyImagex,2011-08-21T00:57Z,What Psynaut00 said...

Or you could just go to cdcovers.cc and get the cover, disc label etc. Much quicker but that's just my opinion ;)"
