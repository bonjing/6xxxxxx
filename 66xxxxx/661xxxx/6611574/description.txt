IMDb Info

Harry and Beth wanted a different kind of holiday. So they chartered a boat
to drop them off on a remote coral island on the Great Barrier Reef. Paradise?
The island was idyllic, surrounded by a wide reef, covered in palms and full of birds
and other wildlife. It was small and totally deserted. Or was it? After snorkelling,
making out and having fun, the young lovers soon come to believe that there is someone
else on the island. Things go missing from their camp and then they discover someone
else's footprints in the sand. At first amused, this becomes disturbing as they realize
the island has a ghost! From paradise, the holiday quickly turns into a nightmare of
arguments and mistrust... Inspired by actual events.
