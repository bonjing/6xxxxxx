,dragre,2011-10-10T07:08Z,the serial is blacklisted wtf
,13,2011-12-04T22:44Z,"Make sure you're disconnected from the internet before using. I thought my firewall would block it but it took me to the System Optimizer website and said: 

""you are using a pirated version of this software, we recommend you buy a new product license immediately.""  

Other than that it worked fine."
