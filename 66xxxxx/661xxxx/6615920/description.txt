A study of Samurai history and culture. It features a detailed section on arms and armour, including the evolution and construction of samurai armour, the Japanese bow, the Samurai sword and polearms -plus the technology and deployment of explosives and gunpowder weapons. Strategy and tactics are explained, with details of command structures, the raising of armies, campaign life, the role of the castle, the characteristics of Japanese battles and the rituals and other consequences of battle. A catalogue of every major battle and siege from 940 to 1638 is followed by specific case studies examining such subjects as personal combat and guerrilla warfare. Further sections cover religion and the Samurai, Bushido and Harakiri, and a special section presents material on the heraldry used by the samurai.
