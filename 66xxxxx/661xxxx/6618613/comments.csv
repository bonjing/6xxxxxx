,onryou74,2011-09-10T19:05Z,"Don't download this if you are using Airport to serve wi-fi to another Mac. It will screw up your wi-fi and you will pull your hair out. Apple doesn't consider this a problem, as they have discontinued support through Apple Care for wi-fi and Airport related problems. Stick with the Gold Master of Lion, or Snow Leopard. Look into this in the Apple forums and you will see what I mean. 

No disrespect to ArtieChoke, good work and all that shite, but this will fuck up your Airport."
