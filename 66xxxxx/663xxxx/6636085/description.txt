    After the F1 Nurburgring disaster of 2025, the Extreme Gravity 
    Racing Association, or XGRA, was set up as a regulatory governing
    body for all heavy gravity race events. The XGRA is the future 
    sports equivalent of NASCAR or the FIA (Federation Internationale
    de l'Automobile) They are the rule makers, organizers and ultimately, 
    the overlords of the racing world. 
    Within the XGRA exists a deep and complex community of highly
    competitive teams, unforgettable riders and unbelievable sponsors,
    all clamoring for the right to stand atop the XGRA and claim the 
    title of Champion. Along the way, lifelong trusts will be betrayed,
    bitter rivalries will be forged and some will meet a fate worse
    than death in this quest for ultimate racing supremacy.
