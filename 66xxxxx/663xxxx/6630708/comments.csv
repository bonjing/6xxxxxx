,useitright,2011-08-29T19:59Z,This is a great copy with no problems.  Quality is perfect.  People are still downloading the r5 because it comes from extremezone and a lot of people only download from him whereas I download the best that is out at the time and this copy of x men is currently the best out there.  Thanks SaM......Great upload!!!!

,Fourthinline,2011-10-08T08:31Z,"There don't seem to be subtitles in the appropriate places i.e. when characters are speaking German or French. Is anyone else having this problem? If not, can someone tell me what i'm doing wrong?"
