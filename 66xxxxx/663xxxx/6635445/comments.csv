,bryentheartist,2011-08-28T17:02Z,is this in english?
,mabritta,2011-08-28T21:20Z,"It's english spoken. There's a not embedded srt portuguese subtitle. Excellent video and audio. This torrent was uploaded because existing torrent was very poor video and unknown language subtitle embedded. The original seeder will endeavour to avoid 99,9%, but he needs help. So seed!"
,mabritta,2011-08-28T21:35Z,"Availability of 99,9% is when there's no seeder and peers don't have information enough to a complete archive. So it's need someone to seed missing information."
,mabritta,2011-08-28T22:45Z,"We have now 17 seeders. This torrent may have a very long life. Thank you all, guys!"
