SOURCES:
VIDEO: ............ Colombiana - Cam - 2011 - HP
AUDIO: ............ Colombiana LINE Thanks Mate 

NOTES:
Ok heres our TS version.....same video source as before but cleaned differently.
Audio was sent to us but believe our supplier sent the audio also so a "friend" who passed it onto to CM8 grp.....so same source.

Right video we went back to the drawing board and encoded again with different filters etc....
This time round we cropped borders,resized and used a smoother to clean the video up.Also made it brighterand lowered the chroma as it was too overpowering.

Audio we have to cut and stretch to sync as the video is missing roughly 14 secs ....two lots of 7 secs.

We've also remastered the audio source we were given and cleaned it up nicely and them change the EQ settings.Now the video is pretty good in dark and light scenes....the issue is the colouring changes slightly throughout.

Audio is very nice line.
Oh and yes all videos will be missing these secs until a new source comes along
