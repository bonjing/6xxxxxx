The greatest talent runs in the family in this case - Enrique
has the same human virtue of being a true romantic as his father
before him the great Mr. Julio Iglesias equally.

Enjoy one of his best hits - "Could I have this kiss forever"
in HD 720p at 1280 X 720 DivX format 2000k video bitrate, we managed
320k audio for you on this one as the original audio we found was distorted


In addition an mp3 at 320k bitrate is bundled in for you ipod and 
hi-fi home audio system.

Enrique really should have paid enough to get Marie Osmond to do the
honours instead - but then I'm not his agent - I'm only an armchair
critic and talent scout too perhaps - as it were - in any event, however,
I suggest  my own views are rightly more completely merited in this regard.

(Have you heard her duet "meet me in Montana"? awesome! she's to die for!
Its in the Time Life Music Country hits we posted here too earlier


enjoy!
