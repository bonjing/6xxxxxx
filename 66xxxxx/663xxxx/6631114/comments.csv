,Dzonixy,2011-08-26T16:38Z,"the subs are terrible, wait for a proper one, unless you know japanese or you wanna watch the pretty pictures"
,bamsen82,2011-08-26T16:45Z,"yeah---

BAAAD"
,Penguinmstr,2011-08-26T22:26Z,"I agree with previous commenters.....the subs are awful. Most of the time they are not even in sync with the audio.

Also the video quality isn't the greatest."
,Blackout046,2011-08-27T00:06Z,"The subs don't even make sense. It's like Tarzan subbed this movie. But thanks for the upload anyway. Good audio and video, yet free too!"
,omgkillmepls,2011-08-27T02:12Z,"bamsen82, dub version will not be out for a LONG, LONG time. No point is waiting for it. Dubs are stupid anyways.. I've never seen good English voice actors for dubbed anime."
,nickgunner1234,2011-08-28T22:56Z,nice garra watch this!!!:D

,Webberjo,2011-10-15T05:26Z,@omgkillmepls You don't consider Johnny Yong Bosch to be a good anime voice actor? 'Cause I think he's awesome.
