Both of this users torrents are not seeded.

Don't waste your time with this torrent, or this user."
,ninjakecil,2011-08-29T10:18Z,"Indeed.
And I just dont get it. Why create 2 torrents with the same file. when the uploader are not seeding at all."
,crimson85,2011-08-29T12:52Z,"Actually i tried deleting the first one that was not seeding repeatedly but it has not gone away so its not my fault, and the file has been been seeding none stop since i posted it and if you are going to be like that when i am trying my best then i wont post anything... it says ive seeded 1.48 gb, so whats the problem"
,crimson85,2011-08-29T12:54Z,"btw, i posted the only motogp indy sessions on this site, are you saying none of them worked? "
,crimson85,2011-08-29T12:58Z,"btw, when u say ""both"", you are inferring ive only posted 2 torrents... shows what you know. I put anonymous on the other so incase i couldnt get them to work because it was my first time making a torrent that i wouldnt look stupid, so thats for being an ass hat to some one trying, no wonder no one cares anymore..."
,snuxel,2011-08-29T14:35Z,thx fรถr the upload crimson!!
,ninjakecil,2011-08-29T15:56Z,"I'm sorry if my post disturb you. I take back what I said. This one is a good torrent, and the other one seems like a mistake (you said you already deleted that but that didn't work).

Thanks for your hard work."
,crimson85,2011-08-29T16:58Z,"Its ok, I didn't mean to be as harsh as i did but racer 224 made me mad since he said I'm not seeding, and considering I put this on tpb to share it I wouldn't have posted it if my intentions were to not seed... That doesn't make sense. Anyways, I will do my best to keep up with more gp as I find it, hopefully people will appreciate that as you have ninja."
,racer224,2011-08-29T20:27Z,"Sorry if you are now seeding, but I had sat with both torrents in queue for quite some time, at one point I checked and there were over 500 leechers, and all were at 0%.

thanks for seeding finally!"
,crimson85,2011-08-29T21:13Z,"Like I said, I have been seeding since the torrent was up, I haven't changed a thing so if it just started seeding to everyone then I have no idea why it took so long, if you have any suggestions about how to get it going quicker them please let me know. But I did have the inital seed option on utorrent selected because I thought it would help so maybe that s it, I read what it does but from what people say I'm not sure of it would help our hurt."
,crimson85,2011-08-29T21:36Z,"Im still trying to delete this one and its still here, so do i need to get some one on the forums to delete it for me since it still wont seed and its a duplicate now that i have the other one working and there are plenty of seeders?"
