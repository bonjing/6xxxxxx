The UT Extension Plan File 
The University of Tennessee Extension maintains a collection of over 300 building and equipment plans, and all are now available in electronic format for download. The plans are primarily intended for use in Tennessee, but many are appropriate for other locations as well.

The plans came from many sources. Some were developed in The University of Tennessee Extension Biosystems Engineering and Soil Science Department, but most were developed in a cooperative effort with the United States Department of Agriculture and the Cooperative Farm Building Plan Exchange. The Plan Exchange no longer exists, but the plans remain on file and are available.

The plans developed at The University of Tennessee are based on the research and demonstration experiences of scientists at The University of Tennessee. The USDA plans generally originated at Land Grant Institutions across the country and were submitted to the Cooperative Farm Building Plan Exchange where they were edited and distributed to all states for use in their Extension education programs.

We have attempted to verify that each plan is appropriate for use in Tennessee. However, these plans are mainly for use as planning guides, and you should check with local authorities concerning building code and building permit requirements. Also, good construction practices should be followed when building from these or any other plans.
