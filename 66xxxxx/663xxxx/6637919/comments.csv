,.Leto.,2012-04-29T00:19Z,"yes, I just finished downloading this and you're right, audio is out of sync"

and I found another problem, at around 1:58:30 picture gets jerky, but it might be because I had to resync the audio with mkvtoolnix.
disappointing release anyway..."
,.Leto.,2012-04-29T17:51Z,"so just to be sure I've downloaded this a second time and I can confirm that there's a problem at 1:58:25. like I said picture gets all jerky, like it's moving frame by frame. it lasts about 20 sec. and I've tested it with several players, it happens with all of them."
