With the large number of surgical atlases in the market focusing on a variety of surgical procedures, it is almost impossible to find an area that is not comprehensively illustrated. However, almost all of these atlases are very large and serve to be â€˜library referenceâ€™ books, which are commonly displayed in the office and utilized in that manner. There is no atlas which is easily transportable, yet one would imagine that every medical student and resident would potentially want a copy of such a title to carry on them at all times.

The book aims to cover all facets of general surgery and each chapter has five to ten photographs illustrating the basic anatomical context, as well as the various techniques specific to the operation. Each chapter author provides a brief narrative describing what is going on during the operation, and also outlines common pitfalls and personal suggestions.
