Joao's "Music of The Soul" CD, given for Free to Humanity! 
I am deeply grateful to Joao Cota-Robles, son of renown Spiritual Speaker, Patricia Cota-Robles, to have asked me to bring through, into a form so you can hear and feel it, 
his Music of The Soul, with the intent (his wish) of gifting Humanity with a music that blesses anyone with any form of cancer. It has been an experience that I will never forget. Joao asked me to create this music and tell his mom to find ways to share it to the World. 
Please share it with everyone! Blessings to All. Frederic Delarue
