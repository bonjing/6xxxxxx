Note : Re did the menus, removed russian and placed english only thing really different is the banner. i took the audio from the main menu and placed it on the chapter menus as well. the chapter menus were still pictures so i rendered them to video for a better viewing as always. did a 9 pass for a dvd5 size and i didnt filter the video at all.
