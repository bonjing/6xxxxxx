,imnangler,2011-08-27T14:09Z,282 seeders and I can't get above 100kbs? Wierd.
,imnangler,2011-08-28T15:57Z,"OK - Finally downloaded:
A=10
V=10
The only problem is that there are no subs for the German speaking parts...have to download seperately."
,imnangler,2011-08-28T18:35Z,"Actually their are many foreign languages - but fortunately there are good sites to download subs for foreign only:
http://subscene.com/english/X-Men-First-Class/subtitle-455756.aspx
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6633822/X-Men_First_Class_(2011)_720p_BrRip_x264_-_800mb_-_YIFY
I think I used the second one on the list and subs are great quality=10"
,scurvypirate1234,2011-08-31T06:05Z,"The TPB link that imnangler posted matches up perfectly with the video. Use the subs marked ""foreign language only"". That's the only file you need from that torrent if you just want the German/Swiss/Russian subs."
,wolfbane3,2011-09-01T13:14Z,can anyone pls confirm if this is the same torrent as that uploaded by bozx? they seem to have near identical specs
,zegrib,2011-09-04T20:05Z,"anyone else have tearing/artifacting issues with this? all other blu ray .mkv files play flawlessly on my PC. This artifacts every 15 seconds at least. When it isn't doing that though, the quality is good. "
,CakeMonster,2011-09-04T23:29Z,"This is a link to the subs, scroll down a bit look to the right and press download do not press any other button or link

The Piratebay dosent want to add a direct link so where the word is ""dot"" change it to the sign ----->."
,CakeMonster,2011-09-04T23:31Z,"This is a link to the subs, scroll down a bit look to the right and press download do not press any other button or link

Where I have written the word dot change that to an actuall dot . This sign here .

You will need to extract the file since it is

These are complete subs so turn them on and off for the German, french and Russian parts, in that order :)


If you are using splash lite player, as you should for files which are 1080p or more, move your mouse tot he top of the left screen press the black button named subtitles and add the file then move the mouse button down and to the left and see a white bubble button with that button you control if the subtitles are on or off, the first time you add the the subs you will need to double click that button to remove them.

The program only shuts of the subtitles if going from a bright white bubble to a dark one if you add the subtitles whilst the buble is dark you will need to click the button twice to remove them, once to make it bright white and a second time to make it dark"

,CakeMonster,2011-09-08T17:00Z,"@zegrib For files that are above 720p you should use ""Splash lite player""

Vlc player and others have problemes with files above 720p

Splash lite player is a free player that is free"
,zegrib,2011-09-12T05:35Z,"@CakeMonster

I have over 50 other 1080p movies and they all play flawlessly on Media Player Classic. This particular video has tearing issues, it has nothing to do with the player or codecs or any other software on my PC."
,zegrib,2011-09-12T05:59Z,"Okay CakeMonster, I concede. I tried it out, and the splash player doesn't show any tearing. However, Splash lite doesn't support using shaders like MPC does either. Tearing aside, the actual quality of the video doesn't look as good with Splash as it does with MPC; it looks more pixelated because I can't use shaders.

All other movies play perfectly with MPC. Why am I having problems with this?"

Start splash lite player, right click, select settings, select video, click the box up to the left which says use hardware acceleration.

ALSO everytime you play a video start splash lite player with that video then close splash lite wait 30 seconds and start it again with the video"
,zegrib,2011-09-12T20:37Z,"I really appreciate your prompt reply CakeMonster; I already looked at all the settings for Splash Lite player and had turned on the Hardware acceleration. While that uses my graphics card (gtx 480), it still doesn't allow me to add shaders like I would in MPC that minimize pixelation. I used CoreAVC codec with MPC to render high definition movies before, and it always worked great up until this particular movie. Don't you think the picture in this movie looks kind of grainy? Other 1080p movies that I own that have had this issue I simply turned on shaders in MPC and the grainy effect was either gone or drastically minimized."
,CakeMonster,2011-09-13T00:43Z,"@zegrib

I do not use shaders myself

All I know is that for files above 720p one should use Splash lite player

Why dosent movie A work for you whilst move B C and D does I can not answer

All I can say is for videos above 720p use splash lite player :)

There is a buy version of splash lite player maybe you can find it cracked on the pirate bay and maybe it has shaders and maybe not"
,3lionsteam,2011-09-27T17:49Z,"i found the video quality actually not that good, its kinda dark and alittle grainy."
,skoumoun,2012-03-09T22:04Z,"Grainy should be a sign of a good encode = it means the image quality of the bluray is preserved.

If it's not grain but pixel-blocky, that's a bad sign of encoding.

To play this movie, All that should be recommended is VLC .
It's free.
No need for cracks.

If you're more expert, i recommend MPC-HC & latest build of FFDSHOW."
