  photoshop is undefined.
Line: 1  
->  photoshop.invokeBridge (false, false "")

anyone know how to easily fix this?"
,SanctusSecurity,2011-08-30T14:40Z,"I haven't used bridge with this Photoshop, so I am unsure. This was in my personal files and just decided to upload (CyberFerret32). If anyone finds a solution, please comment with it."
,SanctusSecurity,2011-08-30T14:46Z,"And for anyone who asks, this can be run from a flash drive."
,SanctusSecurity,2011-08-30T15:06Z,"To add your personal brushes and filters, follow the instructions below.

Filters: Navigate inside the photoshop directory to App --> PhotoshopCS5 --> Plug-ins --> Filters. 
Next, place your filter (.8bf file) in this folder.

Brushes: Navigate to App --> PhotoshopCS5 --> Presets --> Brushes.
Next, place your brush set (.abr file) in this folder.

Make sure Photoshop is closed during this operation.

@everybody
DonÂ´t download, itÂ´s virus.
How to delete:
First you need some startup manager program (i used advanced systemcareÂ´s one)
Disable one with that kind of installer icon and no name.
Disable svchost.exe (DonÂ´t worry, itÂ´s not real svchost..)
Now reboot your computer and go to your appdata folder and delete exploit.exe called file.
Now go to your temp folder. (%temp%)
Remove there file called 44066.exe
and under it is file called 60... .exe, delete them.

Then you see a batch file there.
I donÂ´t remember what itÂ´s called, but just edit and if you see there like path C:\Users\Username\Appdata\Roaming\svchost.exe
Or sth. like that delete that file.

Great, your done deleting this fuckin' virus..

Fuck you SantusSecurity -.-"

,TheBostar,2011-10-14T15:10Z,Whats a skull???
,anathin,2011-10-21T21:23Z,"@TheBostar There are different colored skulls that you can sometimes see next to user names, they can stand for 'Trusted' 'VIP' or 'Helper'. Either way, on TPB (the pirate bay) a skull is a good thing~
