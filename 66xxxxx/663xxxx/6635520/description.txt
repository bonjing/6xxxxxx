Storyline: In 2233, the Federation starship USS Kelvin is investigating a "lightning storm" in space. A Romulan ship, the Narada, emerges from the singularity and attacks the Kelvin. Narada's first officer, Ayel, demands that Captain Robau come aboard to discuss a cease fire. Narada's commander Nero kills Robau when he mentions the stardate, and resumes the assault on the Kelvin. The Kelvin's first officer, George Kirk orders the ship's personnel evacuated via shuttlecraft, including his pregnant wife, Winona. Kirk sacrifices himself by steering the Kelvin on a collision course, while Winona gives birth to their son, James Tiberius Kirk.
