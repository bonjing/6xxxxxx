I like how the time line in this was changed as the last of the william shatner star trek movies were a played out, sub standard special effects (my point is that the 1st STAR WARS released in 1977 has far far better special effects yet the wrath of Kahn was made @ 15years later!!!) Blade runner was also released in 1982 ( The same year as the Wrath of Kahn and it has special effects that are SOOOOOOO much better, there really is no comparison) I would have thought that Star Trek movies would have at least kept pace, but they fall short. Paramount pictures must have a tight budget. 

Not to obsess on the special effects but in the SCI-FI genre it is a HUGE deal.

GREAT upload, THANKS vicerock!! A-10/V-10"
