,Neil10,2011-08-29T02:06Z,"Thank you - I think this was the 6th time I checked today, really look forward to this torrent.  Appreciate your effort."
,bookluver,2011-08-29T05:04Z,"hi thanks so much for all the awesome torrents.  I'm wondering if you have access to the hunger games trilogy in epub format.  I've been looking but have not had much success and your torrents are always legit and easy to use and open.
thanks again"
,sufiriz,2011-08-29T06:02Z,"Thank you very much for your efforts and highly valuable uploads. Just a little suggestion that it will be far easy for us to download if you could only add the new ones in your torrents. You had been doing that previously, I remember.

The full collection could be searched in torrents if someone is interested."
,beowoulfe,2011-08-29T13:05Z,"Great torrent!!

To get a combined, updated folder of books; move all the contents of ""Fiction"" to a previous, earlier download ""Fiction"". In response to the file already exists, answer ""Yes to all"".

Older files that are not in the new update will be left alone. Duplicate files will be overwritten with the newer and maybe updated version."
,aloek,2011-08-29T13:24Z,"Great job, as always. I wonder if you have the short stories collection No Rest for the Dead. Also anything by Hakan Nesser and Arne Dahl in English. Thanks."
,tinkerbell369,2011-08-29T17:08Z,"Any chance you have Spellbound by Kelley Armstrong, and tomorrow One Grave at a time by Jeaniene Frost and the Sookie Stackhouse Companion by charlaine harris? Many thanks in advance!!!  Keep up the awesome work!!!"
