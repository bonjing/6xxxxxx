,mark.taiwan,2011-08-27T07:27Z,I guess it's too much to ask for a non-rar version?
,analjuggern4ut,2011-08-27T07:52Z,"Yes, it is. Some people still live in 1990's and don't know that modern file transfer systems have built-in error correction. Uploading video files in RAR's is the best way to minimize the number of seeds as most of the people don't have the spare disk space to store unwatchable files indefinitely."

,Graymalkin153,2011-08-27T11:27Z,Luckmann sounds jealous
,ElrondMedioElfo,2011-08-27T14:56Z,"Can anybody tell me how to download this? It seems that I'm not allowed.  If it is that way, why am I registered here and I can download nothing?"
,bobsobol,2011-08-28T20:04Z,"Okay... the reason for split RARs (for those who only ever used P2P for sharing files) is because these files are shared on UUNet / News networks (alt.bin) first.

Messages are like public Email, and just like Email the size of attachments is limited. (depends what server you use as to *how* limited) So you send lots of them, in what's known as a ""binary flood"".

It's not uncommon for servers to miss, loose or corrupt posts during replication either... so some form of raid checking usually comes with the split archive to reconstruct missing or corrupted parts. (in this case, nothing more than a .sfv file, but ho-hum)

The reason not to unpack before distributing via P2P (as opposed to client-server) is... lazy? forgetful? DILLIGAF?

What-ever. Thanks for the share... if you could unpack before posting a torrent in future that would be ace, that way your torrent isn't likely to get unpacked, reposted and the repost end up with more seeds than your original. You get more ""Pirate Cred"" and less flames. ;)

But seriously, thanks... I *do* appreciate it, all the same. :D"

Amazing what a few clicks can do. Perhaps sceneline doesn't have the time to sort it out for lazy children. Stop whining - it's free.

Thanks sceneline, good work."
