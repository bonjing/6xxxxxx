So as you can see, if you SEED when your not downloading then you get ALL THAT FASTER.  I promise.  Personally I almost never seed anything so who am I to ask, but if every one seeds a couple then we all have a personal library of movies to download fast and free anytime.  Otherwise when I hit #50 its going to be 'survival of the fittest' and someone's favorite is going to disappear. 


Somone asked for  megamind still looking for that one. all available requests filled. Except X-Men redo requests which ain't gunna happen.  you're lucky you got that.  Pffffff
