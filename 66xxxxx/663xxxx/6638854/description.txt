NOTES:
Origionaly started out with IMAGiNES oos standard def effort. Audio was oos and aspect was wrecked. Id fixed all this and encoded it. Was about to release it then stoped due to imagine releasing the 720p. I know it needed work still and the aspect was off but i stood a better chance of producing higher quality by sizing down as opposed to up. A theory wich this encode proves very well actualy.

Work done:
Video: Resized and corrected aspect based on recomendations from one of my russian friends. Corrected contrast, brightness, hue and colours nicely, as usual based off trailers and screenshots for the genuine movie. Although the dark scenes are still dark in this, i'm surprised just how much detail i've recovered in these areas and how much easier it is to watch. Sharpend this strongly then cleaned the result. Looks absolutly sweet :)
Audio: Very nice line but loads of line hiss to filter out. All clean and balanced nicely. Lowered the volume as well cause it was all overkill in the source. Gota point out i feel alot of the origional source audio is wrecked to a minor degree due to an effect like normalisation.

End result is a very nice ts. Took me a bit longer than was expected of me but then then there was alot of work went in to get this as good. Its basicly the same cam as always but this is a very nice take on it and its got easily much nicer audio and video than the average pluss, most of the issues with the source are resolved to a nice enough degree. Well worth a look if yer curiouse. :)
