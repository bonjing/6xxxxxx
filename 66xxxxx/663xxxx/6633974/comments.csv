150,000 points per second

enter the ""hidden test"" cheat, type the letter ""r"" until you reach fleet admiral. click and move the ball up into the hyperspace tube and hold it there, you will gain over 100-200 points per second.

computer player easier

An easier way to watch the computer play is to simply press ""game"" at the top of the screen, and then press ""demo.""

Big Scores

When you are about to start a game, type ""hidden test."" Then click with your mouse. You will be able to control where the ball goes and get as many points as you want. 

Lots of points

Everyone says uses the the ""hidden test"" cheat then use the spinners to get a lot of points. If you put the multiplier up to 10x first (hit down the yellow tabs that are up the top 4 times in a row) then use the flipper it will go 10x as fast... 

ONE BILLION POINTS!!

Once you open 3D Pinball Space Cadet, let a new game start on its own. Once the pinball falls into the place where you launch it from, hit F2 to start a new game. While this game is loading, type in 'hidden test' then repeatedly hit 'r' to advance your rank. Once you are promoted at least once, hit 'h'. This opens up the high score list and puts the 2nd place score at 1,000,000,000 (one billion). You can enter your name as you would when acheiving a regular high score. Keep doing this until high scores #2, #3, #4, and #5 are all at 1,000,000,000. I'm not quite sure why the first place score stays at whatever it was before, but it does.

Very Rare Score Booster

When the ball goes up the short purple ramp, there is a silver bar it passes under. It is very hard to do so but if you can get the ball to just slowly inch under the bar, it will make a zipping sound and you will recieve tons of points!

Watch The Computer Play

This is a good cheat for when you just can't be bothered to play it instead you can watch the computer play it,

When you start the game type in bmax which will give you unlimited! balls then release the ball holding down the space bar then let go and it doesn't matter if the balls exit the area because another ball will shoot out of no where 

100, 000 points per second

To get 100,000 points per second, you have to use the ""hidden test"" cheat. Left click on the ball and drag it to the flipper flags (near the hyperspace or the fuel ramp) then put the ball on the flipper flag and hold down the left mouse button. 

If you did it properly the flipper flag should be flipping like crazy and your points should be flying up

a) Gmax -- gravity well
b) Rmax -- advance in rank
c) Bmax -- unlimited balls
d) Hmax -- Score of 1,000,000,000
e) Omax -- Play in red! (It does not always work)

High Score of 1 billion

Before the game starts type "" H"" and you will get 1 billion points on the highsocre.
