Plot:Walt Disney Animation Studios returns to the Hundred Acre Wood with "Winnie The Pooh", the first big-screen Pooh adventure from Disney animation in more than 35 years.

With the charm, wit and whimsy of the original Winnie the Pooh featurettes, this all-new movie reunites audiences with the philosophical "bear of very little brain" and friends Tigger, Rabbit, Piglet, Kanga, Roo-and last, but certainly not least, Eeyore, who has lost his tail. "Well a tail is either there or it isn't there," said Winnie the Pooh. "And yours isn't... there." Owl sends the whole gang on a wild quest to save Christopher Robin from an imaginary culprit. It turns out to be a very busy day for Pooh bear who simply set out to find some hunny.

Inspired by five stories from A.A. Milne's books in Disney's classic, hand-drawn art style.
