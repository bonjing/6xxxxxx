Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? was a hit British sitcom. 

It was created and written, as was its predecessor, by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. 

The show followed the resumed friendship, after five years apart, of two young working-class men, Bob Ferris and Terry Collier.

Set in North East England, assumed to be on Tyneside but never really confirmed, the humour was based on the tension between fresh-from-the-army Terry's laziness and Bob's progression to the middle class via his new white-collar job, suburban home and impending marriage to his childhood sweetheart Thelma Chambers 

Since the end of the original The Likely Lads, in 1966, Bob has left factory life behind for an office job with his future father-in-law's building firm. 

Terry sees his extended army experience as lending him moral superiority over Bob. 
Nonetheless, he finds it hard to adjust to all the changes that have occurred in the five years he has been away. 

As implied by the show's title, the series plays on a feeling of nostalgia for the days of the lads' innocent and reckless youth.


Many of these episodes were lost by the BBC due to re-using the tapes.
They were recovered from listeners home recordings.

As on most home recordings from radio to cassette days, the intro's are not 100% complete.
