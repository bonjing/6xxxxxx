,kameliasz,2011-11-03T21:10Z,"Hey, I have a problem with running the game. I've done everything that was written in Read Me, I'm trying to run the game, it loads, then the screen turns black and closes. Two pop-ups appear - ""Missing render-texture extension!"" and ""No pixel format available!"". How to pass it?"
