By Cardia - Silverthree Sound Recordings (2003) - Alternative/Indie Rock, Indie Rock, Post-Grunge
On this self-titled debut album, the members of Cardia create a messy post-grunge mix that's freshly incomparable to what their respective bands did in the decade before. Textured guitar work and layered percussion color Ian Love's raspy squeal for a space rock wave, particularly on tracks like "Stars" and "Crash." Hints of House of Love and Chapterhouse coast along to the charming pop ballad "Your Eyes," while "Our Love Is Real" languishes in lover-like passion. Such an urgency carries the entire album as well, and the bandmembers aren't overindulgent in their craft. They're sincere in creating a lush soundscape that's distinctly inventive regardless of those early dream pop threads echoing throughout. Cardia, which was self-recorded and self-produced by the band, is an impressive introduction to four guys who had previously experienced individual success on a mainstream level. Cardia follows its own formula and makes something beautiful. ~ MacKenzie Wilson, Rovi
