BETTER PERFORMANCE IN EVERY PHASE OF DIE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING

The classic reference on metal-stamping die design and operations just got better. Twenty-year-plus engineering veteran Ivana Suchy's Second Edition of the Handbook of Die Design now adds to its comprehensive coverage new ways to improve processes and reduce costs, from design through manufacturing. Whatever you blank, pierce, punch, bend, form, draw, or otherwise fabricate, this reference gives you the hands-on guidance and use-it-now data you need to do it better, faster, safer. It's loaded with at-a-glance charts, step-by-step guidelines, rules of thumb, and up-to-the-minute techniques for ensuring precision design for every type of sheet metal pressworking. It's the essential on-the-job tool for engineers, designers, and technicians in die design and the pressworking range of operations looking for better evaluations and greater job satisfaction.
