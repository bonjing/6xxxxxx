Product Description

â€œWhile youâ€™re reading Neuro Web Design, youâ€™ll probably find yourself thinking â€˜I already knew thatâ€¦â€™ a lot. But when youâ€™re finished, youâ€™ll discover that your ability to create effective web sites has mysteriously improved. A brilliant idea for a book, and very nicely done.â€
â€” Steve Krug, author of Donâ€™t Make Me Think!
A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability

Why do people decide to buy a product online? Register at your Web site? Trust the information you provide? Neuro Web Design applies the research on motivation, decision making, and neuroscience to the design of Web sites. You will learn the unconscious reasons for peopleâ€™s actions, how emotions affect decisions, and how to apply the principles of persuasion to design Web sites that encourage users to click.

Neuro Web Design employs â€œneuro-marketingâ€ concepts, which are at the intersection of psychology and user experience. Itâ€™s scientific, yet youâ€™ll find it accessible, easy to read, and easy to understand. By applying the concepts and examples in this book, youâ€™ll be able to dramatically increase the effectiveness and conversion rates of your own Web site.
