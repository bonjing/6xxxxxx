,knarfmmc,2011-08-30T12:09Z,"Good stuff, I've never watched them. Guess I'll find out what al the whoha is about. Does anyone know where I can get the 1,2 and 3 in HD? and should I watch them 4,5,6 then 1,2,3 or 1,2,3,4,5,6?

And of course Thanks for the upload :)"

,dangrmau5,2011-08-30T20:57Z,"this is great how did you get this so early?

,Revolver31,2011-08-30T21:14Z,"whats happend to empire being 1 gig smaller and dts audio is only 768k??
i am a huge star wars fan and have preorderd the bluray boxset but going by the samples on this im realy not that impressed not sure if its just the rez or the bitrate or the master transfer dont get me wrong its good but not as good as i thought ill need to sample larger files to see but gr8 up bozx and 2 weeks early nice work."
,xpgrl_uk,2011-08-30T22:08Z,"Holy cow. What are the chances. Just decided to rematch them today and realized that the copies I downloaded 5 years ago are crappy as can be. You're a hero to me, kind sir."
,scottawa,2011-08-30T23:23Z,Wow! This is like porn for nerds! Good job BOZX!
,scottawa,2011-08-30T23:24Z,This is porn for nerds! A+++  Would download from you again!
,digs5446,2011-08-31T00:06Z,"oh yeah, why the 768 kbps on the Empire audio???  that's the best of them all!"

,VeniVidiVici2311,2011-08-31T15:21Z,Always wanted to comment that :P
,messy.1,2011-08-31T21:39Z,"Good torrent Thanks BOZX !  
Doesn't seem to be any subs for jabba etc, any idea if they can be added (just for the alien speaking bits)?"
,messy.1,2011-08-31T21:48Z,"Nice torrent, thanks BOZX! 
Doesn't seem to be any hardcoded alien speak subs (jabba and the likes) can they be added?"
,moss8813,2011-09-01T02:15Z,"Really need some english subs just for the alien speeking parts...like greedo and jabba and the like...

if anyone could post a link up if its been done already i am sure we would all appreciate it..otherwise please someone do it!..lol"
,moss8813,2011-09-01T03:00Z,"ok, my lazy ass went on google and found these enlish subtitles for alien parts ONLY! Make sure rename srt file to same name as video mkv file...example if the video file name is Star.Wars.Episode.4.A.New.Hope.1977.BluRay.720p.DTS-ES.2Audio.x264-CHD.mkv than subfile name needs to be Star.Wars.Episode.4.A.New.Hope.1977.BluRay.720p.DTS-ES.2Audio.x264-CHD.srt

,neolectric,2011-09-01T05:28Z,Of course no full boxed set.  Lamesauce.
,canopener,2011-09-01T07:14Z,"Not working for me for some reason.

Says 100% complete but can't open any files. File folder property says 0 kb?"
,neolectric,2011-09-01T09:52Z,"If you download this and find you cannot open the file, it is most likely due to the poor file and folder names that are too long for windows to handle.  (Noob).

Do the following:

1.  Rename the Folder to a shorter name, it doesn't matter what.  Before you can rename the actual files, you must rename the folder.

2.  Right-Click the movie files and rename them to shorter names (i.e. Star Wars - Episode IV - A New Hope, etc.) 

3.  Watch movie."
,spankbot,2011-09-01T12:55Z,I love DRM because it's so fun (and easy) to crack (especially BluRay DRM!).  Thank you Sony!

,canopener,2011-09-01T13:54Z,"Thanks neolectric!

Renaming the folders to a shorter name works. Great advice for everybody else having problems. "

WTF? Are you kidding me? ANY movie is worth paying for if you WANT to see them. But that's beside the point... DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I'VE PAYED FOR THESE MOVIES ALLREADY?
First in '78 off my measly allowence (I had none btw), then again, and again e few years later, then the VHS boxset (pretty lousy timeworn), then again the remastered VHS boxset, then the DVD... 

I promised myself never to pay quadruple, triple or double again and wait for the BD to download.

(They're not even in 3D. I thought that was why it took so long). "
,rcr29budcar,2011-09-02T00:48Z,"fcRabies, GO AWAY! We do not care what you think! And its true, most of us have bought these movies multiple times already!"
,dangrmau5,2011-09-02T06:00Z,"why are the download speeds so slow... this awesome torrent should be seeded to the max, im dying here @ 20kb/s"
,ts-archon,2011-09-02T11:58Z,"@fcRabies 
So that's why you have a registered account on this website? Damn Hypocrite.

Also, maybe people would be more willing to pay for this if Lucas didn't keep further fucking up the originals with every new release.

Now, fuck off"
,954blade,2011-09-02T21:48Z,"Thanks BOZX.

The force is strong with this one!"
,JustDC,2011-09-02T22:48Z,"First of all I want to thank you BOZX for this awesome release...

@FcRabies, Why the F*** are you on TPB--let alone any torrent site--if you don't condone torrenting? And your comment of, 

""There are only about five movies ever made (counting the whole SW saga as one movie) that we should pay for and this is one of them.
Only punks, losers and fools would sully themselves & download this most sacred of sagas.
Hang your heads in shame gentlemen."" 

is not only self-contradicting, but at the same time completely hypocritical. For you to download one movie you like, but when another one comes along--for whatever reason--you put others down because to you it's a classic. It doesn't work like that. Not here, and nowhere I know of.

Once again Thank you to BOZX.

,Vilarix,2011-09-03T06:11Z,The only reason I am downloading this and not buying it is simply because I do not own a BluRay player and still want to watch the new HD version.
,loki2084,2011-09-03T08:48Z,thanks bro
,Captain__T,2011-09-03T15:54Z,"Thanks for the Upload BOZX. I've downloaded ep4 and had to stop there. Not because of the file which is A10 V10, but the changes Lucas has made are just one step too far. Each to their own, but for me it has made it laughable. (adding the srt is a bit out of my depth too).

I will keep what I've downloaded for others who don't share my opinion until I've seeded at least one. "
,fcRabies,2011-09-03T20:31Z,"Goooooooooooooood.

I can feel the hate flowing through you now.

,ManuelRivero,2011-09-03T20:57Z,"More Lucas butchering.

""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!""

How does it compare to the HDTV 1080p caps that have been available for years?"
,7r0j4n,2011-09-04T00:50Z,"fcRabies is a little troll bitch lol, thanks bozx"
,ManuelRivero,2011-09-05T01:35Z,Can you upload the extras/deleted scenes?
,TheyCallMeSkeelZ,2011-09-05T09:27Z,"I am downloading this torrent since 3 days now. I'm using a service, if I would have been downloading it with my own net it would have been finished a long time ago already. But you know what they say, ""Patience is a virtue"". 

Thanks for the upload, will comment when it's finished. "

,Kowalski1977,2011-09-06T12:44Z,"This torrent is sloooooow as fuck, been downloading since last thurs, only half of Jedi to go.
In comparison to the old HD rips (comparing New Hope and Empire watching on a 42"" HDTV) I can barely tell the difference to be quite honest, this blu ray version is slightly better and you'd be trying real hard to notice, I'm talking face up to the screen trying to pixel count. If you really feel the need to download this go ahead, but keeping and staying with the aired HDTV version you won't be missing much"
,Kowalski1977,2011-09-06T12:51Z,"This torrent is sloooooow as fuck, been downloading since last thurs, only half of Jedi to go. Thanx to the uploader anywayz.

,larsv,2011-09-06T16:00Z,"As far as I can tell these are from the 1997 Special Edition and not the 2011 Blu-ray Edition. 

Any comments on this?"
,king_pirate,2011-09-07T01:34Z,"fcRabies- I'm not paying for something Lucas keeps fucking with and making worse. Sacred saga my ass.

and to everyone else: fucking seed! this is the slowest torrent I have EVER seen. 227 seeders and Soul Surfer is going at three times the speed of this shit."
,Kowalski1977,2011-09-07T03:01Z,"@larsv, it's defo the Blu Ray version as Obi Wan's sand people call is different on ""new hope""."

I watch sample of each episode,only episode 4 and 6 seem to be good other than that they are not far from standard DVD especially racing scene on episode 1"
,gshuck420,2011-09-11T22:08Z,"Thanx BOZX the video quality is far superior to the dvd saga i had before, i am watching on a 720p samsung 43 inch, using my wdtv live box connected thru hdmi. im not expecting todays blu-ray quality cuz these movies were recorded on film not hard drives like today flix, but the clean-up they did and re-colorization is awesome. one down side no subs for the non-english parts, this is a big problem i think, any way i can get the subs?"

What the hell.? As good as the picture quality is, with the audio only in chineese and the new secenes missing, what the hell is the point!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,Lilyen,2011-09-16T23:20Z,"I managed to download the first of these 3. Unfortunately it was absolutely filled with artifacts and is completely un-watchable.

Real pity because it took ages just to get one of them. I will try elsewhere!

[P.s. None of my previous downloads have ever had artifacts like this]"
,Lilyen,2011-09-16T23:24Z,"Oh, but my audio was English. There are two tracks for these films.

I just tried it again & strangely... the artifacts have disappeared. Tried VLC, media player and media player classic over and over before this.

I'll watch it now. Maybe it is worth the download afterall..."
,Lilyen,2011-09-16T23:31Z,"Ah well, I wont bother. The artifacts weren't as bad, but its grainy and every change of scene caused more artifacts. Spoiled it."
