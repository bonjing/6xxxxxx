Notes :
THIRD TIME LUCKY ;-)
GOT THE SEEDBOX SORTED!!!!!

DeMuxed DTS-HD MA track for those that wish to remux
to a smaller video size than FUll BluRay.
I personally enjoy muxing to IceBane's or Mkvonly's nice 
1080p rips. ;) Cheers Guys, Great Work.

If someone could do a demuxed audio in DTS-HD for
the three LOTR extended editions I would be 
very grateful ;).


For TrueHD rips, you may have to remux into an m2ts using 
TSMuxer or you may have to add an AC3 track for the core if
muxing to MKV.

For DTS-HD rips, you can mux safely into MKV with MKVmerge, and
still have the core DTS available.

Fixed the seedbox, so should be fast and RE-SEED!!
