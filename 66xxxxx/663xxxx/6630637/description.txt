[b]Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D


Source: Imagines 720p
thx

Encode:

Wanted to do a version right when the first avi came out, i saw the way off wrong aspect and immediately felt the need to fix that. But Video was dark most of the times and had a lot of grain in it, by removing the grain it looked worse. so i didnt do a version.
The 720p file is way better now, it doesnt have the grain and higher bitrate, helps a lot on resizing and on brightening up.
Firstly i fixed the aspect and the shaking in the first mins and hid all visible borders till the cam is centered.
I split the movie in lots of files, all daylight parts and all parts at dawn or darkness and did every part differently as they needed.
Added a lot of brightness on all very dark parts to let you see more whats going on.
parts at daylight are only slightly touched since they were good already, scenes at lower light or at nearly dawn are in the middle.
For audio i did the usual cleaning up hiss and noise. Was already well synced.

I watched my version right afterwards to see if its worth it, since a lot of people said its too dark.
There is only 2 mins that are not that good, it is the carchase at the 58min mark, even brightended up its not that enjoyable, cant do anything about it. 
i can only do as much as the source provides!
the rest is ok you can see whats going on.
i included a sample at daylight and a darker sample to let you see if its worth another dl.
up to you, anyway movie is watchable and will have to do till a scr or so comes around
enjoy
