Storyline:

Recently widowed well-to-do Laura Henderson is at a bit of a loose end in inter-war London. On a whim she buys the derelict 
Windmill theatre in the West End and persuades impresario Vivian Van Damm to run it, despite the fact the two don\\\'t seem 
to get on at all. Although their idea of a non-stop revue is at first a success, other theatres copy it and disaster looms.
Laura suggests they put nudes in the show, but Van Damm points out that the Lord Chamberlain, who licenses live shows in Britain, 
is likely to have something to say about this. Luckily Mrs Henderson is friends with him.

*I don\\\'t take requests because I don\\\'t have time and everyone will fill the comment section with them instead of commenting about quality and other tehnical specs of the movies or say thanks.Thank you for understanding!
*For best performance I suggest you use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback
*These movies were made especially for PC and they don\\\'t play on a PS3.If you want to re-encode for PS3 or test for other devices be my guests.
*I\\\'ll ask everybody to stop with the \\\"it doesn\\\'t work\\\",\\\"it\\\'s out of sync\\\" comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine.
