,cujimmmy,2011-08-28T20:00Z,Please release the 350 mb or 550mb if at all possible . I did notice the mistake 3 instead of 1 in a previous torrent which confused me at first but await your further upload 1 - 4 thanks in advance
,sonofdog,2011-09-13T16:27Z,"This is the same as season 1, unless you're counting Wonders of the Solar System as season 1."
,polarbearing,2011-11-02T07:15Z,"Thanks for posting these. I'm not critisizing in any way, but I should note (according to the Wikipedia entry):

""In the United States, this programme was aired by Science each Wednesday at 9pm E/P from 27 July 2011. The episodes were renamed and were not shown in order, instead broadcasting episode 2, 1, then 3 and 4.""

So this isn't really ""Season 2"" is it, so much as the US release of the same program originally released in the UK?

Sorry for the confusion.

[T],trialNerror,2011-11-07T05:22Z,"First off, to hell with wikipedia.  People rely on that too much for information when I've found it many times to be incomplete or inaccurate; especially when it comes to TV series'.

I'll try to be nice about it this time since you are merely confused and not trying to tell me it's a re-release of season 1 for either Wonders of the Universe or Solar System.

If Wonders of the Solar System has 5 episodes, how can this be a re-release of it when it's only 4? And how can it be just another season 1 of Wonders of the Universe when the episode titles and descriptions are completely different from what you've seen at the beginning of the year?

This is not a rehashed US market version of UK's season 1. This is NOT the same as Wonders of the Solar System. I have watched season 1 for Wonders of the Universe AND season 1 for Wonders of the Solar System - THIS IS NEW AND DIFFERENT! 

I'll try to clarify it again ...
Season 1 for Wonders of the Universe is:
Ep 1 ""Destiny""
Ep 2 ""Stardust""
Ep 3 ""Falling""
Ep 4 ""Messengers"".
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonders_of_the_Universe

Season 1 for Wonders of the Solar System is:
Ep 1 ""Empire of the Sun""
Ep 2 ""Order Out of Chaos""
Ep 3 ""The Thin Blue Line""
Ep 4 ""Dead or Alive""
Ep 5 ""Aliens""
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonders_of_the_Solar_System

Note that wiki doesn't even list episodes of season 2 for Wonders of the Universe; that's exactly why I never use wiki for TV information.  However, season 2 is listed on the science channel website, on imdb, and on the futon critic.  Check out this link: http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/07/06/brian-cox-returns-to-science-for-the-second-installment-of-the-peabody-award-winning-franchise-wonders-of-the-universe-644315/20110706science01/  See how it reads ""second installment""?  Sounds like season 2, right? I'd say so.

This is a legit release of Wonders of the Universe Season 2."
[T],trialNerror,2011-11-07T05:38Z,"One more thing I have to clarify cuz I know some of you might bring it up...

Wonders of the Solar System is the original series that aired in Fall of 2010.

Next came Wonders of the Universe at the start of 2011.

This came out at the end of Summer in 2011.

This is the real deal. If you are a fan of the series and think it's not real and aren't going to download it, well then you my non-friend are really missing out. "
,virulient,2012-02-03T11:01Z,"My 'non-friend'. That's a good one! Anyways, I CAN verify this torrent is in fact season 2, and different from season 1 of either series. It shouldn't have needed verification, but that's ok, some are a bit slow. Thanks for the torrent, excellent quality!!"
,dscgrph,2012-03-04T01:59Z,"dude. dont care about those brainfarts. you are wasting your times! keep up the good works. thanks.

,mrwonker,2012-03-10T15:04Z,"I apreciate anyone who puts in the effort to upload torrents for the benefit of the comunity so like polarbearing said this is not meant to critisize, but he was quite right in the information he gave.
here are the facts. Brian Cox first did wonders of the solar system then Wonders of the universe that is it, there is no series 2, your release is from american TV where the episodes were renamed and broadcast in different order than the original, also the episodes are edited down to about 45mins where as the original episodes were an hour long, I have downloaded this and wasted my time as I already have wonders of the universe and I can 100% confirm other than episodes being edited down to 45 mins they are the same."
,mrwonker,2012-03-10T15:09Z,"this torrent is fine if you want edited episodes watermarks and smaller file size but if you want full episodes better quality from blu-ray without watermarks download

IT IS THE SAME SERIES."
