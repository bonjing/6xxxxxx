Tropical plant enthusiasts who enjoy cultivating unusual blooms and green thumbs seeking practical advice on how to care for rare specimens will embrace Llamas' up-to-date guide to a wealth of species that should flourish in USDA zone 9 or do equally well if nurtured indoors and brought outside in summer. Arranged according to botanical families, plant listings open up a wondrous world of evergreen shrubs, bulbous herbs, epiphytic vines, and clustering palm trees. Scientific names are linked to common ones for clarity, while descriptions contain insightful details regarding plant origins, habitats, and cultivation requirements. The straightforward yet engaging writing style, along with a profusion of telling photographs depicting leaf shapes, showy flowers, and tree forms, will help in identification as well as in selecting plants to grow, whether one gardens in a greenhouse, on a windowsill, or outdoors in a sun-drenched climate.
