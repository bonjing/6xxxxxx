Camelot                                                                                                                                                         In the wake of King Utherâ€™s sudden death, chaos threatens to engulf Britain. When the sorcerer Merlin has visions of a dark future, he installs the young and impetuous Arthur, Utherâ€™s unknown son and heir, who has been raised from birth as a commoner. But Arthurâ€™s cold and ambitious half sister Morgan will fight him to the bitter end, summoning unnatural forces to claim the crown in this epic battle for control. These are dark times indeed for the new king, with Guinevere being the only shining light in Arthurâ€™s harsh world. Faced with profound moral decisions, and the challenge of uniting a kingdom broken by war and steeped in deception, Arthur will be tested beyond imagination. Forget everything you think you knowâ€¦this is the story of Camelot that has never been told before.
