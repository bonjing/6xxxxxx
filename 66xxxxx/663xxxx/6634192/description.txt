This torrent contains the only published issues of Crossgen's Negation War series, part of the company-wide crossover event.  Unfortunately the series was cancelled mid-progress due to Crossgen's bankruptcy.

I was originally going to hold this series back until I finished uling the rest of the Crossgen titles but since natural disasters may mean spotty internet and or power outages I figured I'd ul this small series and bring some joy this weekend.
All thanks to the original scanners and uploaders.
Please seed, especially since many users may miss it while batting down the hatches for Hurricane Irene.
