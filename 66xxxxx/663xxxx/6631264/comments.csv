,DngnRdr,2011-08-30T04:13Z,I guess they figure people watching would actually be interested in those commercials.
,Trench000,2011-08-31T20:13Z,"Thanks for the heads up on not being Player's Championship.  Already downloaded Main Event 3 & 4 a week ago from TPB.

The poker commercials are actually inserted by the capper so far as I can tell; those aren't commercials from the original broadcast.

Thanks for the uploads; looking forward to Day 4."
