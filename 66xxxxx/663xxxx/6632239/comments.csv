Any plan to upload a heavier release?

Thanks for the upload, DownTYU. Appreciated as always."

I´ll try DL this one!"
,mike_1337,2011-08-28T02:21Z,"@NotInLove,
it's okay, you wouldn't regret this rip by sector7. the dts is freaking nice

@DownTYU
thanks for this quality upload, i think you should not waste time on uploading a 'heavier' torrent. i'm sure someone will upload a ~15mbps version soon enough though it won't get any better from 10mbps on out

otherwise, just buy the goddamn hardcopy :P"

,kechiguy,2011-08-28T13:53Z,"Impeccable--the video and audio are top-notch, so I'm not sure what everyone is belly-aching over. I'm been waiting for Thor to be downloadable for a LONG time, and I'm perfectly satisfied with this 1080p version. Thanks a bunch, DownTYU, and keep 'em coming!!!"
,levarnaud,2011-08-28T15:57Z,"@mike_1337 @kechiguy
Well it's just that for some movies like this one, the pleasure comes a lot from the visual and audio effects, so I want to make sure that I have the best quality available to enjoy it on a big screen with a home theater, the way it was ment to be played and enjoyed. You know, without the quality loss due to compression. I often find 1080p copies under 8gb to be a bit short on quality, but that's just my opinion.
Now, if you're saying that this release is top-notch, I shall give it a try!"

,VegaOrion,2011-08-29T07:53Z,"I'm no expert, but I thought this copy was great. Little grainy but that seems to be the look some directors shoot for these days. 

Anyone have a link to a what to look for in 1080p torrents? I'm not an expert, but I'd like to be.

I'll keep seeding this one at night. Thanks DownTYU!"

,imnangler,2011-08-29T18:55Z,"I'm curious about something - It was stated that a full BD burn is like 45G and remux being 32...but I have found the quality on 5-20g movies to be outstanding. And have also movies that are 1080p and are no more than 15g. My question is would there really be a huge quality difference to the 32 and 45g ""muxes""?"
,MuSickFinder,2011-08-30T02:46Z,I think this movie was pretty clean compared to X-Men First Class that has lots of grain and not always in a good sense.
,LENUMALEX,2011-08-30T03:31Z,can you please  upload boxset brrip of jurassic park......for christs sake no one has uploaded even one of them in brrip.........i need them with about  6.5 GB for total 3 movies............can you help me......please..............

,WoWx3,2011-09-03T18:27Z,"Lol, LENUMALEX is right. I miss those too :)
However,
thank you for this upload !"
,tk1917,2011-09-03T18:34Z,"@gesswot: it is. You arent taking into account the black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. They have been removed and hence the top to bottom resolution isnt full 1080 because what would be the point in rendering black bars, it would just waste space. What is really important is the first number, the 1920. This is constant and shows its 1080p"
,Doomext,2011-09-04T03:21Z,"Not 1080p. 1080p is precisely 1920×1080 pixels, considering the format uses 16:9 aspect ratio. Every single time!"
,FanofTBP,2011-09-04T12:47Z,THIS IS 1080P. They have just cropped out the black bars on the top and bottom which make the height 816 instead of 1080. But the width is still 1920.

,ShrekFL,2011-09-20T09:51Z,"@ wolftone1916 - 16.5 KBPS?  What kind of Internet Service do you have?  That is barely any better than dail-up....  You really should just not even bother downloading blu-ray videos bro, with my Knology 60-70 megabits per second, I was able to download it just under 40 minutes.  It took longer because it took a little while before it was going full speed of 6-7 megabytes per second, or 60-70 megabits, if it would have went full speed from the start I would have had it done in under 25 minutes.  I only pay like 60 bucks a month for my internet man, 129 bucks a month total for Internet, TV with Premium channel packages and DVR, and telephone line, only 129 bucks for the entire package.

I would seriously try and find a better company to go with."
