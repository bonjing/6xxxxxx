,Distortion311,2011-09-02T05:19Z,Thank you for also uploading the avi format. It's difficult for people who use ubuntu. I have a hard time extracting batch files. This is a throw back from the days of message boards when you were direct downloading large files from your service provider.  I don't think rar files improve speed because the bit torrent process breaks the avi down into pieces when you're downloading from seeders anyway.  
,wafflerevolution,2011-09-02T21:45Z,you're welcome.
