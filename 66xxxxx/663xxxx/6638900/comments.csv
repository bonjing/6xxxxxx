1. Download the game from http://tehparadox.com/forum/f43/%5Bfslfsclbslwu-%5Ddeus-ex-human-revolution%5Beng-iso-2011%5D1gb-9dls-2799367/ and extract the Rars(files are interchangeable). Then extract/mount the ISO image. I just extracted the game files to my programs files directory manually(create your own game directory - there's is no install!).

2. Download the replace files: http://filesmelt.com/dl/Deus.Ex_.Human_.Revolution_.Crack-ALI213_.rar copy over and replace files in the game directory you created.

3. Download the crack: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6631263/Deus_Ex._Human_Revolution_CRACK_ONLY_V1.1622.0.rar copy over and replace the game file in the game directory you created.

Everything is there but, when I click on 'install.exe' it told me to check if the application requires 32-bit or 64-bit[along the likes] I use 64-bit, windows 7.
Is there any way I can get this to work or do I have to re-download it?
Thanks in advance "
,moza_en,2011-09-01T22:52Z,"ok Got it.
if you get this Error('Failed to open bigfile000') then  extract files Manually and see if you get any crs error while Extracting RAR files.some of my files were corrupt i downloaded them again and installed it manually.works Perfect.
thanks @gansuk but installation takes so much time.it's usually worth it since you save time not downloading the full pack but this time the difference was just 1 gb.still appreciated but you were more efficient.just saying (;"
,bloodtrailkiller,2011-09-02T00:46Z,"Bah, got my problem fixed...

please help, reinstalling now so it might solve something///"

,moza_en,2011-09-02T11:00Z,@bloodtrailkiller it's most probably because some of the rar files were not downloaded properly.UNRAR the files manually and see for which Files you get Error(CRS fail/Corrupt) and download them Again. that would FIX it i had the same problem.

It's English by default so if you want to change it japanese for instance, just replace ""english"" with ""japanese""."

Any idea why it's not working?"
,moza_en,2011-09-04T18:04Z,@JonathanBG i had the same problem. my problem was due to bigfile000 being corrupt.unrar the files manually and see which ones of the RAR files gives error message(crs/corrupt error).then download those files again and install(i suggest you do that manually).by the way use crack version 1.6.2(you can find the link in the comments) that might help.
,MossySloth,2011-09-04T18:22Z,"Someone *please* help. Downloaded the torrent no problem. Ran the install - worked fine but when I rant the exe got this error: ""Archive BIGFILE.003 isn't large enough! (should be at least 1524094975 bytes)"". Unrar'd manually (no errors) and unpacked and ran the exe - exact same error. Been working on this for days so help would be great."
,moza_en,2011-09-04T21:20Z,@MossySloth which Extraction program do you use(i suggest Winrar)? your problem is clearly due to some corrupt RAR files.just try to find the corrupt files and replace them.that plus manual installation should do the trick.
