,thenaughtons,2012-06-10T03:18Z,"thanks for the upload, but the album is not all that good. the only track worth listening to is the last one : You Learn. The rest just does not make scense, lyrics seem just thrown together. There are so many other Swedish bands that sound awesome and make a whole lot of scence, just not this one.

sorry, perhaps others will like it."
