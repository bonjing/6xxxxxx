May to December was a British sitcom which ran for 39 episodes, from 2 April 1989 to 27 May 1994 on BBC One. The series was written by Paul Mendelson and produced by Cinema Verity.

Set in Pinner, London, it revolved around the romance between a widowed solicitor, Alec Callender, played by veteran television actor Anton Rodgers, and a much younger woman, ZoÃ« Angell, played by Eve Matheson in seasons one and two and by Lesley Dunlop in seasons three through six. Matheson left after the second series due to an offer of a world tour with the National Theatre, including playing Cordelia in King Lear.

The title of the show comes from the Anderson-Weill song September Song, which is sung during the credits. The titles of all of the episodes of May To December are taken from songs. Most are from musicals, reflecting Alec and ZoÃ« 's mutual interest, but some later ones are hits from the 50s and 60s.

Characters

Alec Callender - (Anton Rodgers) - a widowed, Scottish solicitor who tries to balance his work, his family and his new romance with a much younger woman, ZoÃ«. Alec idolises Perry Mason, and has a signed photo reading Cheers Alec, let's crack open a case sometime. Perry. He wishes his cases could be more exciting like Perry's, but instead the most excitement he sees is the occasional divorce.

ZoÃ« - (Eve Matheson, series 1-2) & (Lesley Dunlop, series 3-6) - a feisty PE teacher, who divorced her husband after discovering he'd been having an affair. She briefly dated the boys' PE teacher, Roy Morgan Jones, but the relationship is not serious and ends almost as quickly as it began.

Miles Henty (Clive Francis) - Alec's surviving partner (Semple died years earlier though his name is still on the door) who is a bit of a womaniser even though he is married to a sculptress named Annabelle. He initially encourages Alec to take ZoÃ« out on a date. He is prominent in the first series and often takes Hillary to lunch, among other places.

Jamie Callender (Paul Venables) - Alec's son, was an easy-going bachelor who approved of his relationship with ZoÃ«. He has a great sense of humour and seldom ever in a bad mood. He's a bit of a free spirit and lightens any scene he is in. He starts as a law student and takes over for Mr. Henty in as Alec's partner after he gets his licence. He is the polar opposite of his sister.

Simone Callender (Carolyn Pickles) - Alec's daughter. Simone is married to a vicar and has a high moral standard that borders on prudish. She is vehemently opposed to her father's relationship with ZoÃ«, especially when they purchase a house a little too close for comfort to the vicarage.

Vera Flood - (Frances White) - The senior secretary who comes across as prim and bookish but has secretly written a romance novel using a pseudonym. Her love life isn't as active as the other characters, especially in the beginning, but she eventually marries a man named Gerald Tipple.

Hillary - (Rebecca Lacey) - the ditzy and scatterbrained junior secretary. She is the exact opposite in every way to Miss Flood from her personality to the way she dresses. She has a long standing relationship with boyfriend Derek, though she is briefly engaged to Miss Flood's nephew, Anthony. She moves to the Isle of Wight at the end of the fifth series.

Debbie - (Chrissie Cotterill) - ZoÃ«'s sister. While she doesn't completely approve of their relationship, she is more tolerant of it then most of the family. She works in her parents' grocery store and has a long term relationship with the much talked about, but never seen Trevor, who works nights. She is primarily ZoÃ«'s sounding board.

Dot - (Kate Williams) - ZoÃ«'s mother. She has quite a bit in common with Alec and likes him, but doesn't approve of her daughter's relationship with him. She has infrequent appearances. She owns a greengrocer's with ZoÃ«'s father from whom she later separates briefly before reconciling to the strains of Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White.

Fleur - (Sophie Louise Collinson) (episode 1), (Natalie Boonarec) (episode 2), and (Charlotte Perry) (episodes 3-6) - Alec and ZoÃ«'s daughter who is born in the first episode of the fifth series.

Rosie - Ashley Jensen - Replaces Hillary. A mad Scotswoman who is always asking: Hoo's yer juices?
