Why more people haven't downloaded and seeded this is beyond me.

I had this last week, but my stupid brother got access to my pc and deleted it! wat an asshole!

It is an absolutely amazing collection emulator_man, I mean it is the best collection of games I've ever seen by a HUGE margin, it must have taken you months if not years to collect all those titles. Anyone who's even remotely interested in the games people had in 80's NEED to get this torrent, multiple different versions of games, it even has the game inlays scanned, just utterly incredible!!!

,emulator_man,2011-11-25T21:11Z,"Yes it took a while to collect it, A couple of years actually. The worst part was to rename all files. But I really wanted to have a good collection. So I think it was worth it! Its really fun to play those old games. A good nostalgia for us who grew up with the Spectrum. About the seeding, I think theres a lot of  people seeding it right now. But I will check it from time to time."
