but if you grab the free tool called avidemux and load it into that
and change copy to mp3 lame under audio on the side and then go file pulldown and save avi it takes about 3 minutes to convert it to standard xvidmp3 format :)

I might re-add the fix to season finale next week though.. see how bandwidth goes."
