,TheAnt317,2011-08-29T04:59Z,"Sounds like LEERV is the real no-life here, trolling random wrestling torrents and thinking people care about his homophobia and insecurities. ""Half of them are gay anyway."" Hahahaha, seriously? Those ""gay"" wrestlers get more pussy in a week than you'll see in your entire life. And I like how he used the ""IT'S FAKE"" argument. Nope, it's not fake. Sure, it's scripted and the winners are pre-determined, but a lot of the fighting in the ring is made up on the spot. Learn about what you're whining about before you say anything, kiddo.

Great upload scene4all!"
,DeltaPan,2011-08-29T11:54Z,"May be choreographed, but i'd like to see that tosser LEERV doing the whingeing get in a ring and not end up in an emergency ward.

I'd like ye to say that lot to Seamus' face for instance, he'd show ye how fake it is alrighty!

Only people who have never had real violence in their lives think it's similar to cartoons where dog smacks cat over head with frying pan and head goes boing with no injury and they carry on hitting eacheother, so on, so forth with no injuries or pain because to them it's all acting, fracking acting, behave yeself.

These guys train, so they know how to fall, how to pull puches and roll with the blows,, they build up a tolerance to pain but they still get hurt, of course it is mostly controlled, else they'd put eachother into hospital each week and there'd quickly be nobody able to wrestle, it is a sport, they aren't about half killing eachother, most of the time.

Like chair shots, ye know, somebody can smack me around the head with a baseball bat and i will laugh and go for whoever did it in a way they wouldn't be able to handle, because i've had so many kicks to the head, iron bars, bricks, bottles, etc, i'm tolerant to that sort of thing, i feel pain very differently to people who haven't dealt with a lot of violence in their lives, only in 2008 a mental case smacked me in the mouth so hard it would knowck most people out cold, me, i just laughed and growled ""thought i'd go spark ay, got that wrong didn't ye"" and he shit himself, he was a mid teenager and i'm not into beating up kids so he got away with it (I did say he didn't know what he was fracking with and to frack off before he regretted it and after i took that punch, where he put everything into it and i didn't even flinch, he got the message.), could tell it made him think, people don't always go down like a sack of shit when you sucker punch them etc, i certainly don't, wrestlers are similar, through training they build resistances and tolerances, where they will just ride it out but those who don't train eetc would be in a lot of pain, of course, some people have natural tolerances.

Even so, wrestlers do end up seriously injured, have to go out for months to recover, even choreographed, they get hurt and feel pain, they just don't go that far.

As somebody who has grown up with violence, i may be peaceable now but i've given and taken a LOT of violence in my life, and who has trained in martial arts and know damn well what i'm seeing in a wrestling ring, Kay Fabe or not, these guys still hurt eachother a lot.

People who think otherwise, don't have a clue.

They should go and have a few real fights, get whacked around the head with a chair and a baseball bat or two etc, then come back and say it's all phoney playacting, because i think if they did deal with some actual violence in their lives, they'd then know what they are looking at as well, but obviously don't have a clue now, just like the sound of blowing off their own ego's and feeling 'well 'ard' when they are in fact pussies with big mouths.

Mind how ye go, ay.

,twinghost,2011-12-24T00:54Z,"@LEERV

lol i think someone needs to get a life, seeing as its entertainment, just like watching a play, the fans know its fake, its called a show, what im wondering is why if you hate it so much why your on this torrent and even bothering to write on the comments... somethin tells me, you dont have much of a life do you? lol"
,JOJO-ksa,2011-12-30T00:01Z,Thanks ..
,MOSHP1T,2012-01-04T21:49Z,"@DeltaPan  with a name like and the time you took the write about how tough you are online you must be a real tough guy.
