Um yeah...

Not sure if it works, but who knows? I mean you wouldn't be looking if you weren't curious.

Instructions:

Best listened with headphones.
Find a quiet and comfortable place were you will not be disturbed and simply listen to the whole mp3. Do as the track says and it will work better. Just relax and open your mind. Fighting causes you not to go under. It will most likely not induce you the first time, but the more you listen the better you will receive and be induced to trance. This may take some time, but you must not give up. As with your bodies results, it will take a while before you notice results. Try to listen once every day (shouldn't be hard the track is only 16 minutes long). Remember, It takes time for your mind to go into trance. Once you enter trance efficiently, the session will go by much faster the more tuned to trance you become.

Good Luck!
