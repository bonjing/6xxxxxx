With its trademark contoured body, twin cutaways, and two-toned sunburst finish, the legendary Fender Stratocaster produces a peerless sound that has earned the instrument a permanent spot in the annals of electric guitar history. The distinctive Strat was invented by Leo Fender in 1954, but it was Jimi Hendrix\'s preference for the guitar during the 1960s that solidified its popularity and made it the instrument of choice for generations of rock\'s leading guitarists, including Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, Robert Cray, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Dick Dale, and many others. THE STRAT PACK celebrates the 50th anniversary of the storied instrument with a concert recorded at London\'s Wembley Arena in September of 2004, featuring the star-studded lineup of Joe Walsh, David Gilmour, Brian May, Paul Rodgers, Ron Wood, Hank Marvin, The Crickets, Albert Lee, Gary Moore, Mike Rutherford, Paul Carrack, Phil Manzanera, Amy Winehouse, Jamie Cullum, and Theresa Andersson.
