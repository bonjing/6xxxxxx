On Mirror Traffic the Jicks rage and roar, but the winding jams have been cut away so the brief blasts of sonic ballast are one of the many colors on an album with a rather large palette.  Producer Beck doesnt clutter the record with unnecessary textures but encourages Malkmus to take detours, so Mirror Traffic winds up playing something like a focused update on Wowee Zowee. Unlike Face the Truth, a similarly kaleidoscopic pop album, there is a casualness here that is immensely appealing.
