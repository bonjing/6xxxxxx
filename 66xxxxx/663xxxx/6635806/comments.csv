A TS has a direct line. http://www.dslreports.com/faq/4178"

,pbfool,2011-09-03T02:03Z,"This is NOT out of sync at all. It is jsimply NOT a telesync. (TS) It's a Cam like all the others.

It's definitely watchable--nobody gets up and walks in front of the camera - but the audio is cam and some parts are hard to hear.

No complaining here--I appreciate the uploader, but I'm looking out for my fellow downloaders. 

They should know the quality and source before downloading. 

Just Keepin' it real."
