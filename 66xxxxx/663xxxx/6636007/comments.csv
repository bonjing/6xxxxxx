,AlanWake,2011-08-28T20:04Z,Finally a reliable source. Is this the latest version (1.622 I think)?
,billylopez,2011-08-28T20:07Z,"cheers dude you guys rock..........

will seed till I bleed"
,Zheiwander,2011-08-28T20:24Z,"Yeah,completely needs last version patch,is it already implemented,or is there a way to install it once downloaded¿?"
,moarsi,2011-08-28T20:26Z,"I'm kind of confused, so I'd appreciate some help clearing this up. Why is this 5.09 GB while others are 7-8 GB? Is this a demo or is it the full game?"
,solidesnake,2011-08-28T20:53Z,"@moarsi
its a full rip
thats why 5 gb not 8gb
and nothing ripped
TPTB rocking like always 
thx Shroo"
,SalehRam,2011-08-28T20:57Z,I love you guys 
,smart765,2011-08-28T20:59Z,"Thanks :)
Is this with the latest patch and/or the bonus Tong mission pack?"
,santoshpraveen,2011-08-28T21:06Z,"moarsi @ It's not a demo, As you can see in the description : Ripped: Nothing !!

Why it's size is 5gb is it is COMPRESSED. After u complete downloading it, once you extract it it may end up somewhr around 5-10GB (i havent downloaded it yet but it's my guess as i have told you the average size) I always download TPTB rips because they are the best. Small size and hassle free !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "

,hikki_man,2011-08-28T21:21Z,"@moarsi: It's a full rip, this means that it's the full version, but compressed. It's smaller than the other versions but has the same content, the catch is that it takes a bit longer to install, since the installer needs to decompress the files."
,knox666,2011-08-28T21:48Z,"Finally a reliable source? Why? I've been playing this game fine wilth ali123net version and the v 1.0 crack no problem. The only problem I had was with the update it erased my saved games. Oh well the ""regular peeps"" did pretty damn good in my book. :)"

It gets to rebuilding 30 percent and stops. Trying to run the game it says it cannot open bigfile.000 or whatever"

,hsn_kmr,2011-08-29T18:35Z,"Hey Guys !!

My system config is as follows :

OS : Windows XP
Processor : 1.6 GHz
Memory : 2GB RAM
Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 8400GS 512 MB
Direct X : 9.0c
 Will this game run on my pc smoothly ?? According to the requirements processor has to be 3.2 Ghz but i have only 1.6 Ghz half of it ...
I am having this doubt because modern warfare 2 also needed 3.2 Ghz processor . But was able to play it smoothly on my system which has 1.6 Ghz speed ... So will the same happen with this game ????"
[V],Shroo,2011-08-29T18:46Z,different engine different requirements. I can assure you that this game wont run smoothly.
,NeutralGold,2011-08-29T19:13Z,"Yeah, this game hardly makes my gpu break a sweat and it's a good bit laggy. "
,jeffreybaks,2011-08-29T20:57Z,"Heres how I got my game to work

1. Download the game from http://tehparadox.com/forum/f43/%5Bfslfsclbslwu-%5Ddeus-ex-human-revolution%5Beng-iso-2011%5D1gb-9dls-2799367/ and extract the Rars(files are interchangeable). Then extract/mount the ISO image. I just extracted the game files to my programs files directory manually(create your own game directory - there's is no install!).

2. Download the replace files: http://filesmelt.com/dl/Deus.Ex_.Human_.Revolution_.Crack-ALI213_.rar copy over and replace files in the game directory you created.

3. Download the crack: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6631263/Deus_Ex._Human_Revolution_CRACK_ONLY_V1.1622.0.rar copy over and replace the game file in the game directory you created.

Thats it, you should be ready to go, if you need any help email me at jefferson3891@hotmail.com "
,hipie12,2011-08-29T21:17Z,Whenever I start it up the just goes to a black screen. They said in the update it fixed it or whatever. Didn't help.

,rfvasquez,2011-09-01T15:49Z,"This is version 1.0.618.8 - it works fine for me on two AMD 6950's OC'd.  But if anyone is having any problems, you can download the Version 1.1.622.0 update here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6635818/Deus.Ex.Human.Revolution_Update_v_1.1.622.0_PROPER

1.  Extract Everything to a folder
2.  Rename Files in Game Directory to backup
3.  Copy All extracted Files into Game Directory
4.  Enjoy

And yes, it works, even if you are in the middle of the game and you have gamesaves.  Nothing is lost.

As I am sure you know, the 1.1.622.0 Update fixes AMD/ATI crashes and also speeds up LOADTIME.  There seems to be a fix for Mouse Sensitivity too"
,T4,2011-09-01T17:31Z,i just downloaded in 4 days not so bad... the only kinda bad thing is that raptr and xfire cant detect it :P
,rfvasquez,2011-09-01T19:15Z,"@bulldog75

Did you download the 1.1.622.0 PROPER Update?  Do you have the latest Driver for your HD5770?  I am running 64-Bit Windows 7 - I have heard there were some issues with the 32-bit, but I can't find the posts in the other Deus Ex Torrent comments"

,rfvasquez,2011-09-02T03:57Z,Ok - try this when the screen goes black - I have heard that you can somehow get to the options - maybe hit escape - see if you can go to the Video Options and uncheck BLOOM - I heard that is the problem behind the Black Screen Bug - post here the results
,duceduce,2011-09-02T04:57Z,"I'm also getting an error at startup.

I'm using Windows 7 64 bit, and I have a nvidia card."
,duceduce,2011-09-02T04:58Z,"also, I installed the PROPER update, still the same problem."
,rfvasquez,2011-09-02T05:54Z,"OK - here is a thread I found on the Black Screen and Crashes - try these:

â€“ Run the game directly instead of a launch via the generated desktop shortcut or launching it through Steam
â€“ Change your resolution to something smaller and more common
â€“ Exit or disable anything that may interfere with the game (antivirus, firewall, etc)
â€“ Revalidate your game cache through Steam to make sure the game isnâ€™t corrupted
â€“ Update your drivers or, when available, patch your Deus Ex: Human Revolution game when you can
â€“ You can also try running the game in Windows XP Service Pack 3 compatibility mode by right clicking the EXE file -> Properties and selecting so in there
â€“ Disabling DirectX 11 mode seems to be helping a lot of people!
â€“ Locate atidlxx.dll (32 bit Windows) or atidlxy.dll (64-bit Windows) in C:\windows\system32 and disable them (i.e. rename the .dll part to .dllbak) then try running the game
â€“ LOWER your graphics settings! Such as texture filtering, Anisotropic, Shadows, DOF SSAO, Resolution, etc.
â€“ Change the AntiAliasing option to EDGE AA

It is not uncommon to crash during the introduction or CG / Cinematic scenes. Some crash when selecting â€œNew Gameâ€. Data Execution Prevention (DEP) can prevent the game from running ot cause crashes sometimes too. For DEP issues (or disabling DEP), check below.
â€“ Make sure to install the game into PROGRAM FILES instead of somewhere different to ensure compatibility
â€“ Run the game DIRECTLY instead of via shortcut or launching through Steam (may avoid fail to launch / launch failure too)
â€“ Run dxhr.exe as ADMIN OR add the exe to the exceptions list through Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Performance"
,Sadness79,2011-09-02T07:06Z,"Simple install, clean and it works. Like it should be."
,duceduce,2011-09-02T07:36Z,"most of those dont work for me, could work for others tho

mostly because half of them require steam/retail version, and none of em fix the bigfile.000 problem. if theres some way to fix bigfile.000, it could be fixed for me. i never tampered with the files at all"
,rfvasquez,2011-09-02T08:17Z,"@duceduce

You aren't running the game off another drive other than C: are you?  If you are, re-install the game on your C: drive - I have heard that helps the BIGFILE problem - also, run a chkdsk on your drive to see if there are errors - it may be sitting on a bad sector - try a defrag to move stuff around"
,royhere,2011-09-02T18:42Z,"Game works perfectly fine..
