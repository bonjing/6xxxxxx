HOWARD WILL BE ON VACATION UNTIL SEPTEMBER 6TH.

Enjoy."

Isn't he on ""vacation"" due to hurricane situation?"
[V],wushdishmeen,2011-08-30T18:55Z,No they were off this week anyway had nothing to do with the hurricane.   Otherwise they would have been back today considering the hurricane passed through in a matter of hours and people are back to work.
