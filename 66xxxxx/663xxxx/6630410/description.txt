Johnny Young  Johnny Young and His Friends
Released: 1994
Label: Testament Records
Format:Flac

Recorded in informal settings between 1962 and 1966, this presents Young with various configurations, with major Chicago blues talents like Otis Spann, Robert Nighthawk, Little Walter, and Walter Horton lending a hand at different points (Young also plays solo on a couple of numbers). Only three cuts feature drums, so this is usually at the midpoint between Delta blues and the electric Chicago sound; Young usually plays guitar, but also brings out his mandolin for a couple of songs.
