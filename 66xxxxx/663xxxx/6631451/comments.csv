How can this be BRRIP?"
,snowbirds,2011-08-27T03:14Z,"Video - 9.5
Audio - sounds good

The 1.36 gb HD rip probably has a little crisper video, but that one was downloading really slow.  This one is nearly perfect and downloaded really fast!

Thanks uploader! :)"

If you animals like the rip, say your yhanks and download it, otherwise go do something else (maybe f**ck yourselves using your mothers dildo."

Thank you uploader, but I could not stand watch this aliens ""fantasy"" movie propaganda shoved our throats by some well aimed dubious mob. "

,MrOsborn,2011-08-29T05:54Z,Maybe I got a crap download somehow or my soundcard is shit but the audio distortion is pretty bad as the volume goes up. Thanks for the upload though. It's still better than the TS I watched a couple of months back.

,essaji,2011-08-29T12:27Z,only 710MB .. Thanks SaM you rock..!
,munkeynuttzz,2011-08-30T02:49Z,"@decebal2003 its about a norris god, of course they're going to talk about religion. and its tying together with the incredible hulk, iron man 1&2, and captain america, for the avengers movie, but i guess you missed that"
,KillaKron,2011-08-30T07:16Z,its Norse not Norris and lmao that this is in anyway religious. its MYTHOLOGY not some story out of the bible. uneducated people are so hilarious.
,reaper_alk,2011-08-30T10:58Z,awesome upload...thanks SaM.
,jimstarooney,2011-08-30T12:05Z,not a blu ray rip and not much better than all the ts that are on here
,vlaggenstok,2011-08-30T17:26Z,"@KillaTron it's indeed Norse he was the Norse God of thunder like Zeus was for the greek, yes mythology but they actually believed he was real till they got slaughtered in the crusades and then they were forced to believe in the God as we know it today."

This is the rip you want if you watch it on your pc! Quality is good enough. Thanks!"

,wistfool,2011-09-24T08:41Z,"I'd give this one an 8/10 for Video and a 5/10 for Audio.

The audio is really bad, but someone said that was because of the movie itself? Huh ... anyway there were only a couple of scenes where the difference was felt and otherwise, for the file size, it's a very good download, and very useful for my awfully slow net connection, so thank you!"
,NilHybridz,2011-09-24T12:33Z,"This is a shit print. You should stop misguiding people SaM. This is not a BRRip at all. The quality is so shit, it is shame even for a cam rip. Those who have rated video and audio 10/10, you all are bloody fucking retards. Don't download this crap. I couldn't even watch for a minute.

A: 4/10
V: 3/10

Fucking shit print."

M/why would I watch it at this low quality when there are good rips available?

This is probably acceptable for viewing on a small screen laptop or mobile device."
,Scinik,2011-10-11T03:29Z,"@mlech: Many people on this globe do not have access to unlimited bandwidth and/or high-res displays. So instead of BITCHING about what others put up FOR FREE, why don't you just shut yer yap, go get your precious Blu-Ray rip, and fap away while fantasising that your little gadgets somehow make you a better person?"
,michaelrwatson,2011-12-16T02:51Z,"@mlech: Scinik is absolutely right. There are diff qualities avail for diff folks. I would never try to download even a 1.4GB rip on my home computer--too slow, and doing it on campus is dicey.

This is plenty good quality (though i would prefer 640x272) and fits on a CD too. It's a heck of a lot better than a cam. 

Having said that, this is a great movie and worth watching at top quality. (Most movies, on the other hand, are NOT great and don't even deserve DVDrip quality.)"
,bbscorpion,2011-12-17T10:41Z,"Please upload DVD-Rip for

,phat_71,2011-12-30T04:17Z,"It's always so entertaining to see some assclown bitching about the quality problems of a 700mb file. If you want quality go DL a 1080p full BRrip at 6-8gigs. As has been said, not everyone has unlimited bandwidth, and even then not everyone has the DL speed to actually get a file that size in a couple hours. Most really decent speeds will be something around 500kbps, which means it'll take longer to DL the movie than it will to actually watch the stupid thing. 

In short, if you want super awesome quality, go buy the BR for 30$+ at walmart, and quit pissing and moaning about something like this..."
,vasanthrocks,2012-02-01T03:28Z,the print is very good.mlech is fuck joking.but there is no subtitle.
,R0tten,2012-05-11T03:34Z,"For those who are attacking mlech: He's pointing out that this is either NOT a damn Blue-Ray rip or it's been shrunk so many times and there is high quality loss. I just downloaded it and I stopped the video two minutes in. 

It's extremely pixelated, and still so when I shrink the window. In fact, the video is worse than most of my own DVD rips, so it couldn't even pass for said DVDRip either.
