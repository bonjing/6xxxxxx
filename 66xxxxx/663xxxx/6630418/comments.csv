,Cooleditor,2011-08-26T19:11Z,"whats the difference between AC3-ViSiON 3.46GB
and AAC-ViSiON 2.45GB ?

and which is better quality ?"
,udonsee,2011-08-26T19:21Z,screen works and thanks froggie100 as always
,chi18593,2011-08-26T19:55Z,Cooleditor-the diff is only in the quality of the audio....ac3 gives a better quality and gud surround...because of its higher bitrate....so the more size...no difference  in video i think....
,madecepeda,2011-08-27T00:34Z,Seeed!!!!!
,jack.pott,2011-08-27T18:30Z,"@Cooleditor: 
there's XviD.AC3-ViSiON and x264.AAC-ViSiON

that means both video and audio codecs are different.

Usually, xvid offers better compatibility (and lower resource requirements) whereas x264 gives superior compression (but is more demanding to the player)"
