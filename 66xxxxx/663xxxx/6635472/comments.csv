,gyunagyos,2011-08-30T21:31Z,is this map available for a 2005 modell?
,064harry,2011-09-02T23:39Z,"Are there just 2 single-layer DVD's ??
A normally Volvo Navteq RTI has 4 DVD's and must be burned on dual-layers??"
,popoffka,2011-09-04T19:25Z,"@gyunagyos: dunno, try googling.
@064harry: yes, these are two single-layer DVDs. I don't know what do you mean by ""normally"", but that's the case with this map."
,freddellmeister,2011-09-07T18:19Z,"Detta är inte MMM2 formatet för XC60, S80 eller V70, detta kanske förklarar varför storleken skiljer."
,064harry,2011-09-08T00:58Z,"Sorry, but it won't work as expected!
I've burned them exactly as you told me.

And by normally I meant the navigation dvd's of 2009 or 2010.
They're 3 or 4 Dvd's to burn on dual layers..."
,popoffka,2011-09-09T19:23Z,"@064harry: What do you mean by ""doesn't work as expected""? Does your car's system give you an error? I tried these disks on my XC90 MY08 and it worked fine."
,garminfriend,2011-09-10T18:18Z,"Where can i find the 3-dvd-version for V70 (2007)?
This files work only on newer models."
,064harry,2011-09-12T23:33Z,"@poppoffka

I've tried it in my friends V70 MY 2008 and it simply doesn't work.
I will try it in more Volvo models.
Strange....."
,cozmund,2011-09-30T22:40Z,Looking for the MMM/P2001 version for MY 2007 V50... thanks
,064harry,2011-10-11T23:04Z,"Yes!!! It works!!! I've tried it in a XC90 MY 2007 and it works. 

@popoffka: Thanks!!!
You're the best!
I'll try other models too......"
,olly007,2012-03-25T00:14Z,"Varför lägger den sig som 2 img filer?
När jag bränner, tar den bara den ena filen!"
,olly007,2012-03-25T00:15Z,"Någon som har något bra tips hur jag bränner den?
Funkar den till 2004 mod?"
