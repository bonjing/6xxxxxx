,jmac85,2011-09-30T17:41Z,"First off, what resolution are they? If these are 1080p, try reducing it to 720p and lower your bitrate to 1200 kpbs or so for 720p...should be fine for x264."
,jmac85,2011-09-30T17:42Z,"If you're still willing to upload, please try seasons two and three. Experiment with each episode. 45 minute shows in 720p should be 1 GB or less."
