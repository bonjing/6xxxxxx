,jh5637,2012-03-01T23:20Z,"Dude! I have been trying for days to get rid of Win 7 admin password to no avail! OphCrack only got user password but no admin. Login Now didn't even boot up. Hell, I almost ended up buying some crap called Windows Password Recovery just to see if it worked! (You spammers almost got me!) No need to throw away my hard earned money because this worked! You're a TPB God amongst TPB men. I will seed this for at least a month.  Thanks again mate!"
