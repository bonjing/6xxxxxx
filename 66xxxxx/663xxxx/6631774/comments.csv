,tito13kfm,2011-08-26T22:39Z,"What a crock of shit.  You download a scene release, attach your username to it, delete their NFO file, and add in .URL files to redirect users to some bullshit sources.

At least you didn't unpack it like some morons.  But seriously, deleting the NFO file from a scene release is some serious bullshit."

,SteelerJ17,2011-08-27T23:27Z,"Go to abgx360.com. Scroll down until you see ""Individual Video ISO Archives and click on ""Wave 12 (2.0.13146.0) also there's a Wave 13 (2.0.13599.0) For Wave 13 This is a new wave, but it has not been verified yet to make sure there is no corruption (abgx360 will not autofix video without a verified ini anyway)."

,Suma26,2011-08-30T22:52Z,"TO EVERYONE THAT IS GETTING ""unrecognized disc"" etc... on the the latest firmware on the latest dashboard, i have a solution!

MAC: If you have a mac patch it with abgx360 then after burn your game with a program called ""iburn360""
1. open iburn360
2. put your dvd+r DL disc in
3. click where it says refresh (after your disc is loaded in your computer)
4. drag your iso into the program where it says ""Drop your xbox 360 in the box below""
5. make sure your layer break is set to ""1913760""
6. Recording Speed has to be 2.4
7. Click burn
8. Click patch then click OK
Now it should work in your Xbox 360, enjoy! :D

I don't have a WINDOWS computer but I'm sure there is a program like this and just do it the same way!"
