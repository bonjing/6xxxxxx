Readers Digest Music 700 Years of Classical music (compilation)
- complete 8CD set at reasonable 192k bitrate

Here is a nice set of Classical music mp3s for your cafe, relaxing evening
or wherever mood music is the right way to go - rather than rap. punk
or any other form of mental abuse in our environments.
Learn some sensitive courtesy eh! Give folks something nicer to tolerate
instead and the world will be a fairer, saner and therefore happier place!

(Pick and choose from this huge collection - certainly!) 
Some great Standards are included in the line-up I'm happy to say
