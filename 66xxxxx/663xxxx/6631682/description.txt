NBA Rules History (XVI):
------------------------

Take a look back at some of the rules changes that have taken place over the years.
(Changes/clarifications implemented prior to season, except where noted) 
-------
1978-79
-------
- Number of referees officiating game increased from two to three.
- Rolling the ball on the floor from out of bounds now allowed; penalty of loss of possession eliminated.
- Technical foul imposed on team instead of warning for first illegal defense and two technical fouls imposed for second and all subsequent violations. Illegal defense rules modified.
- Clarification added instructing players and coaches to proceed directly to dressing rooms, without pause or delay, following halftime. Previous rule only stated at conclusion of game. 
- Clarification added to prohibit hand-checking through â€œrigid enforcementâ€ of rule allowing a defensive player to retain contact with his opponent so long as he does not impede his opponentâ€™s progress. 
- The three-point field goal is tried in pre-season.
