Pricing the Priceless
Just how much is the Eiffel Tower worth? Or what about the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt? And could you put a cash value on New York's Grand Central Terminal? In this new series, US engineer and television personality Kevin Cook decides to answer these very questions, taking a trio of iconic structures and valuing each in three ways in order to obtain an accurate cash sum. First of all, Cook assesses the scrap value of his chosen structure: how much cash could he raise if he broke up each building and sold off the pieces? Then he utilises his engineering background, looking at the construction of each selected monument, discovering how each was put together and how much the cost of rebuilding would be today. Finally, he examines the profit and cost margins of each building as if he were a Wall Street trader purchasing a company.


1)  The Great Pyramid 
In the opening episode, Cook's focus is on Egypt. Just outside the capital, Cairo lies the Great Pyramid of Giza, built to house the body of the Pharoah Khufu and comprising 5.75 million tonnes of limestone. The Great Pyramid has been the subject of historical and archaeological research for centuries, but now Cook will attempt to tell us what it might be worth, in terms of scrap, rebuilding costs and its value as a business. He also ponders how much it might cost to ship it back to his home in the States...

2)  Eiffel Tower 
Can you put a cash value on the Eiffel Tower? One man sets about finding out how much this iconic monument would cost by modern standards to scrap it, build it or move it. Tonight, Kevin Cook is breaking down the bill of Paris's historic spire for a hypothetical buyer and, despite a disjointed, almost hysterical delivery, his methods are most intriguing. After an awkward exchange with a Parisian curator, his mission takes him from a scrap metal yard to an auction house in the US, where a collector's attempt to sell an original tower staircase elicits a bemusing response.

3)  NYC Grand Central 
Can you put a cash value on New York's Grand Central Station? Kevin sets about finding out how much this iconic monument is worth, in terms of its scrap value, rebuilding costs and its value as a business. He'll also try to calculate how much it would cost to ship it to LA
