,Roxon,2011-09-10T20:33Z,Audio is korean
,Roxon,2011-09-10T22:05Z,"Also, now that I've watched the first half, I can say it's a very watchable copy with good subs too.

So far awesome movie as well, gonna continue watching now :)"
,Elkubiak,2011-09-14T23:04Z,"Is it hard-subbed? (subs on the movie, not a separate file)"

,casstin,2012-02-08T02:24Z,Why does the description for this movie says that its file size is 1.37GB? It's not. It's 2x700MB!! What the fuck? What fucking idiot still releases movies in 2x700MB format?? Who the fuck still uses CDs? Get with the fucking times and stop wasting people's time/bandwidth. God damn. 
,DadaFan,2012-02-17T23:44Z,"@casstin
please let us know how a 1.37gb movie will save bandwidth over a 2x700mb movie. fucking idiot."
,agk47,2012-03-14T01:35Z,"thankful for a version that isnt mp4/aac...people who release that evil should be whipped and put in prison...why cant technology slow down and let us enjoy what we already got...i dont plan on upgrading my 47'' xvid led tv anytime soon.
who cares if there a slight glitch when the files switch over..a single avi would of been preferred but there plenty of other torrents to choose from...so, suck it up casstin, it clearly says 8 files..the whole torrent is 1.37 :P"
,agk47,2012-03-14T01:51Z,"@dadaFan...think u got casstin wrong :) 
what they mean is they wouldnt of bothered with this torrent if they had the intelligence to read the details before downloading ;)"
,QuentinsCandy,2012-04-29T17:13Z,Erm 10/10 for everything until 1 hour 17 mins films ending is missing!!! Argh
,QuentinsCandy,2012-04-29T18:14Z,"Erm take that back big time, think I may of had one too many because I never played 2nd CD , what a wally! 10/10 "
