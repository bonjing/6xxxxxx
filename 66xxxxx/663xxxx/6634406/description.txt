NOTE: if you have a preciously licensed version of  1Password 3 then you don't need to download this.  This is only for those that may not have it.  Upgrades are usually free, and occur frequently. Don't forget to install the 1Password3 plugins into your browsers, so that you can access the program from within your browsers.

1Password is a password manager that uniquely brings you both security and convenience. It is the only program that provides anti-phishing protection and goes beyond password management by adding web form filling and automatic strong password generation. All your confidential information, including passwords, identities, and credit cards, is kept secure in one secure place using a highly encrypted keychain.

1Password fully supports most web browsers, including Safari, OmniWeb, DEVONagent, Firefox, Flock, Fluid, and NetNewsWire. All browser extensions share the data stored in the keychain which means you never need to manually copy your passwords between browsers or from the password manager to a browser ever again!

1Password has received numerous awards, including 4.5 mice from Macworld magazine, MacLife Editors pick, and was the Pick of Week on MacBreak Weekly by both Leo Laporte and Merlin Mann.
