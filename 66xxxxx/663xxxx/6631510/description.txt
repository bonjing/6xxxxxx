Why the GOG version? It comes without DRM - just install and play. It\\\'s been updated to work on modern hardware and software (say goodbye to installations breaking at 99% and graphics issues caused by modern graphics drivers!) It requires no other software to get running, not even disc imaging software.

Have fun, everyone!
