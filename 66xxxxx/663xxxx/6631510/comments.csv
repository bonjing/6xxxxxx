,Iztok1967,2011-08-26T19:20Z,THANK YOU!
,Sanicle,2011-08-26T19:51Z,"@Iztok1967 - You're welcome. It's worth noting that I have also included the soundtrack and some wallpapers and misc artwork separately in this release. If anyone just wants the game they can grab setup_beyond_good_and_evil.exe only, though I would encourage downloading the whole package to boost the overall health of the torrent :-)"
,wtfgamer,2011-08-26T20:27Z,1.01 patch is included?
,Illanair,2011-08-26T21:34Z,"I can only image it is, Iztok. GOG was founded long after BG&E was off the market."
,Sanicle,2011-08-26T21:41Z,@wtfgamer As far as I'm aware. Although further changes have been made over and above the 1.01 patch to solve compatibility issues with modern hardware and OSes
,Casevil,2011-08-26T22:30Z,I love you.
,Insomneac,2011-08-27T02:09Z,"If you guys can afford it, you should try to support GoG.

Their games aren't expensive, and they do the right thing."

,xummatul,2011-10-01T05:32Z,download stuck at 88.0 %
,Blargenheimlich,2011-10-09T18:50Z,I must thank you. Ive had to stay away from this game due to my graphics driver..and now...*single man tear* Thank you...
,sixor,2011-11-02T12:59Z,"thanks, works perfect"
,katyism,2012-01-30T07:15Z,"Help I'm running Vista SP2 and when I try to install the game from this torrent, it does a file integrity check and then the window disappears and nothing further happens. In task manager, the processes setup_beyond_good_and_evil.exe and setup_beyond_good_and_evil.tmp are running but there are no visible windows to indicate progress. I left it like that all night and still nothing happens! "
,RogherNahasa,2012-02-02T11:36Z,Thanks.
,glavan117,2012-02-06T19:47Z,u legend i love  this game plus u add some more ur a good source 
,spazowacky,2012-03-14T21:15Z,"I originally bought this for xbox then bought the pc version too which was fine on winxp but wouldn't work when I upgraded to win7x64 and ubisoft provided no workaround for the issue.
This is a great game and I'm happy to have a playable version of the game.
Thanks very much"
,Chris_Kadaver,2012-03-21T21:42Z,It works on windows 7 64-bit. But I get black bars at the top and bottom at 1920x1080 on my tv even if it is the naitive resolution. It doesnt happen in other games! It also shows wrong proportions. It should be stretched out. Kind of irritating!
,JONATHAN017,2012-03-31T18:55Z,Thank you for the game :D
,oddsor,2012-04-04T01:57Z,"Buy the game on gog.com, it costs basically nothing!"
