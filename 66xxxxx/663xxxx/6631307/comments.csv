,Ipmark,2011-09-22T10:46Z,"Decompress only ...part1.rar file, Winrar will join togheter all other parts automatically."
,test2011,2011-09-29T13:27Z,Is it possible to load this mapset into Garmin MapSource?
,Ipmark,2011-09-29T20:28Z,"Use Basecamp instead of Mapsource.
Download the program from Garmin site, it's an update but if you haven't a previous version already installed on the PC decompress The exe with Winrar and launch BCMAIN.msi.
Then search TPB for Basecamp special v3.2.2 and overwrite the original Basecamp.exe with the patched one.
Put the map on a pendrive in a folder named Garmin and start Basecamp, the program will recognize the pendrive and the map, select it."
,N_Senada,2011-10-06T13:43Z,"All working good so far, except being able to unlock maps in GPS. The keygen can create code for software and map. Which of these codes goes into gmapsupp.unl, and what should be done with the gmapsupp.unl file? Load it to the GPS?

Thanks for your patience."
,Ipmark,2011-10-09T01:09Z,"Put the gmapsupp.unl file in the same folder of the map.
If your GPS use the .gma file as digital autentication file, you have to unlock the map with Fast IMG Unlocker 2.1.exe tool."
,Ipmark,2011-10-09T01:17Z,"Yuo can found the Fast IMG Unlocker 2.1.exe tool in Garmin City Navigator Brazil NT 2012.20 Locked IMG torrent.
If you don't need the map, download only the tool."
,shrink3677,2011-10-23T22:30Z,I am a noob putting maps on gps. i have unzipped files into a holding folder - the crack only shows for Navigator. I already have basecamp installed. I cannot follow the instructions to send to GPS - I have a Dakota 20. Sorry to be bothering you over this. Please help
,shrink3677,2011-10-24T08:36Z,"Sorry, got it to work in Basecamp."
,RAWBits,2011-11-05T21:41Z,"Download taking forever.  Flashing along at the blinding speed of 1 to 7 KB/s.  It is, however, gratifying to see my Share Ratio above 1 (1.35) for the first time.  Is this peculiar to this file?  Can I do anything to affect this?  (Another download is taking place in parallel at my expected rate of ~140 KB/s.)"
,Ipmark,2011-11-06T10:29Z,"The problem is that few users continue seeding after the download is complete.
The only thing that can I do is continue seeding with my two PCs.
At this moment only 7 seeders online ...."
,shane51,2012-01-16T01:55Z,hi. need a lesson in using Winrar. how do you get the program to decompress and join all the required files?. all I get is a msg to overwrite the existing file?. hope you can help.
