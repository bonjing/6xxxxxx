,Green-Banana,2011-08-27T21:51Z,Thank you for uploading a proper video file and not wasting our time with suspicious and unnecessary archives.  Modern OSes are capable of built-in compression by themselves.  
,txrabbit,2011-08-27T22:34Z,Amen to what Green Banana said.
,vexxecon,2011-08-27T22:43Z,Thanks! downloading now!
,riodoro1,2011-08-27T22:54Z,Thanks so much!
,codemonkeyb,2011-08-27T23:09Z,"Actually, what's the point of raring up a video?  It's not like any excess compression is achieved.  Best I can figure is that it's the splitting up into a bunch of files so it can be passed through a newsgroup?  But BT is totally not newsgroups."
,bulmanb1,2011-08-27T23:33Z,"please actually seed this rather than nabbing it and sodding off! Weird, it came up as lots of RARs before, but now is just one simple AVI file :-) looks good to get, especially if bbc iplayer seems to think you're in a different country!!!"
,pengouin007,2011-08-27T23:57Z,Thanks! :)         Merci.
,CrazySwan,2011-08-28T00:04Z,I've been trying to download and keep getting the infinity sign.  Is there something I don't know here.  Been trying for nearly two hours!
,stevieb,2011-08-28T00:15Z,thanx :D
,CrazySwan,2011-08-28T00:18Z,still not seeding.  any help would be nice
,Faule,2011-08-28T00:21Z,Thank you! :) 
,Green-Banana,2011-08-28T01:10Z,"I'm an American, and you're clearly not.  Now stop being a drama troll and make way for mature people.  

I have a question about this torrent.  The video seems to freeze at about 33 minutes in.  What's that about?  It continues about a minute later, but it freezes there and kind of lags up my entire  computer.  Virus scans didn't find anything wrong with it, though.  "
,catfly,2011-08-28T01:14Z,"if its a doctor who & its full of rar files and its come up slightly before the episode even ended on tv, then its some deadshit having a lend of you, its probably not even a real file.
as for the american who can't understand pommy-speak.. why the fuck did you download it? are you a complete idiot? go watch jersey shore."
,antikhrist,2011-08-28T01:54Z,"@BanthaPoodoo you are a cock if you dont like british tv dont download it u ignorant bad mannerd insolent little twat and certainly dont bitch about the fact others want to wantch it 
and by the way if you cant understand an english accent ur a retard and i laugh at your pathetic little mind 
@VTV -thanks for the upload iplayer sucks and u saved me from having to use it"
,Green-Banana,2011-08-28T01:54Z,"I have reason to suspect that one of the people on this torrent might have infected it somehow.  I've been asking about the glitch I experienced just before 33 minutes in (32:52 I think?) and I'm told that my file is buggered.  I thought I should warn others.  Personally, if this is the case, I think it was the troll.  "

,Green-Banana,2011-08-28T02:16Z,"Nah, the episode finishes, it just pauses around the 32:52 mark and picks up again about half a minute or so later.  It finishes fine after that, but it seems suspect to me.  "

,antikhrist,2011-08-28T02:23Z,ooo sorry people aparently the page was glitching hard my msg was only ment to come up once  but maybe ittl put emphasis on how much of an ass that guy was 
,antikhrist,2011-08-28T02:25Z,@ green banana try forcing a re check it often picks up any slight glitches in torrents i get it every now and then on legit torrents
,timotay89,2011-08-28T03:20Z,Anyone know where to find the confidential for this one?
,viral_intent,2011-08-28T03:26Z,Come on please seed guys it's sitting at 98% for me!
,Green-Banana,2011-08-28T03:33Z,"@Antikhrist A re-check?  The glitch is in the video file as it plays, though.  The torrent seemed to finish fine.  I'll try it anyway, though.  "
,CrazySwan,2011-08-28T04:18Z,"finally downloading.  guess everyone had the same idea i had.  anyways, thanks"
,Durhon,2011-08-28T05:16Z,@BanthaPoodoo Do you watch shows like Jersey Shore? Because you seem to be the kind of person that would like that stuff.
,AceHazard,2011-08-28T05:36Z,Great upload and episode.  I'm looking for the Confidential episode too.  Anyone know where that's at?
,zepplin10,2011-08-28T07:47Z,"I love the English accent, and I've been a fan of doctor who for 28 years.

On the defense of a .rar torrent, I don't mind them when they are legit.  I find they play smoother on my machine while I'm still seeding the original RAR's and watching the file at the same time, less conflict going on.  .AVI's are just fine too.  "
,BrentacoN,2011-08-28T09:27Z,my day can not possibly get any better I cant wait to watch this and it is all thanks to VTV thankyou my day is complete
,turdist,2011-08-28T10:27Z,"Green-Banana if your file is broken it's a shame you didn't get the rar'd version, because then you could check each volume with the sfv and only redownload the corrupt one.

As it is, you'll have to start over.
"
,dynamic_pulse,2011-08-28T10:55Z,FOR FUCKS SAKE. 306 seeders and im still downloading at only 36 kb/s  ... I MEAN COME ON GUYS!!
,a1919354,2011-08-28T14:29Z,faster to just download it in my opinion http://safelinking.net/d/32c6772504
,Kole97,2011-08-29T14:33Z,so cool
,Vetoed,2011-08-30T21:40Z,"@Bantha-Poodoo, how extremely eloquent of you, you must be very proud of your grasp of the english  language. No wonder you can't understand Dr. Who, there's no swearing in it. By the way, your neck....it's red."
,Cinaed666,2011-08-31T14:52Z,"@Vetoed
The swearing is failing to make your point.
Try normal words for a change.

About not knowing and understanding doctor who: Get some culture."
,Cinaed666,2011-08-31T14:52Z,"oops, I meant @Bantha-Poodoo in my last comment."
,antikhrist,2011-09-01T20:30Z,@ bantha-padoo - i repeat you are a cock now  FUCK OFF
,Vetoed,2011-09-01T20:49Z,"@Bantha-Poodoo- I saw your dad last night playing the banjo at the start of Deliverance, before you deny it i already asked your mom! She could only nod her head of course, since her mouth was full, and whether she spends it on food or on some new diapers for you its the best 2 bits i've spent in a while."
,anon1978,2011-09-02T02:14Z,I wonder if Hitler is still locked in that same closet?
,slicedt,2011-09-06T06:05Z,"@green-banana
If you file is corrupted try using vlc. Other players cause shitty problems."
