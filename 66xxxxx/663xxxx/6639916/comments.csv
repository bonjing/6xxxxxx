,reala1,2011-08-30T14:43Z,thank you for the effort :) Will help seed when it is done
,Erik_O,2011-08-30T22:04Z,thanks but are you seeding now? it doesn't download...
,GhettoDiva,2011-08-30T23:53Z,Emm..why is this an invalid torrent file? that's what utorrent tells me! :(
,killbush,2011-08-31T11:17Z,I am seeding now and have quite a few people connected. If anyone got an invalid torrent message it might have been when I was not seeding.
,traital,2011-09-07T05:41Z,Hi.  So appreciate your contributions.  Any update on Episode 10?  Will you be able to upload it killbush?  I can be patient....
