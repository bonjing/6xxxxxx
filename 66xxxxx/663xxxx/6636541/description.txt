From the Back Cover
In correspondence with the widely popular and original Handbook of Fiber Optic Data Communication First Edition, and now updated Second Edition (2001), experts in both industry and academia have compiled an excellent addition to the field of Fiber Optics. This work revisits and expounds on the future technology section of the first Handbook, while also including 8 new chapters, plus a glossary and list of technical acronyms. New standards such as Infiniband, and new technologies such as small form factor optical devices, wavelength multiplexing, and optical backplanes are included. Information is also provided for end users of optical datacom, such as description and comparisons of clustered parallel computing architectures and forecasts of what the next 25 years will bring in this field from industry experts. Specialists, engineers, and scientists within this field will benefit from this up to date collection of pertinent information as will those end users looking for answers to their everyday datacom questions.
