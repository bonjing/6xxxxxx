,crimzind,2011-08-28T22:44Z,"The torrent completes, but every time I try to extract the video, it fails, and upon rechecking the torrent, parts 14 and 15 are incomplete. Every time. So, I don't know what's going on with this torrent."

,seVIIn,2011-09-02T06:58Z,"Here's a tip: If you run into a problem like crimzind's, in Âľtorrent stop the torrent (to make the menu item available) right click on the torrent and select ""Force Re-Check"" and it most likely will solve your problem.  For whatever reason Âľtorrent thinks the download has finished when in reality it still has a little bit left to go."
