    A crew of young researchers escape into the future to avoid the          
    shutdown of their project. They find that some type of 'eco-crisis'      
    disaster has de-populated the area around their lab (in rural Idaho)     
    and, by implication, the nation or maybe the world. Stranded in the      
    barren future, in their travels they encounter an abandoned freight      
    train possibly full of corpses (maybe, it isn't very clear). One of      
    them travels further into the future and meets a family in a             
    futuristic automobile, implying that that humankind has recovered        
    from the disaster (or have they?)
