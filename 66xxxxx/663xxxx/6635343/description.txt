The Spaghetti Western Orchestra

The Aussie comedy quintet bring their internationally-acclaimed show to the BBC Proms. The Spaghetti Western Orchestra's unique take on the music of legendary film composer Ennio Morricone involves the inventive use of cereal packets and asthma inhalers, among other instruments. Presented by Charles Hazlewood. Not classical but very clever.



Enjoy and Seed!!
