The RMVB video type secures nice picture performance for close half size of the necessary stable bitrate , for example : an avi that needs 600 mb to have nice bitrate stability , with the RMVB for close 300 mb the user get the same stability of the picture compared to the 600 mb avi , after maded a few tests i really tought to have a shot to upload this movie file in RMVB video type , knowing also that somehow it is starting to be a kind of normal somewhere on the net the nice movies having RMVB files available for download and that it is respected because the stability of the picture for not too much size .

Always searching the best new ways to make uploads thinking on the best that the users can get with what it is available to work and this is the correct file sharing spirit ... 

Cheers and happy movie to all of you ..."
[V],globeplus,2011-08-26T12:09Z,"Doenload the best player for RMVB files on the below link (FREEWARE) :

MEDIA COPE :

http://www.mediacope.com/media-cope-download.html

Now , anyone can ask : why this one ? because he integrates the RMVB player btween another nice thingsand while viewing the RMVB file it is possible to put the picture anywhere on the movie time , with rhe basic RMVB player the watching is very nice but only watching the movie in a consecutive way , so if you already watched 50 minutes and must get out , when you want to continue the watching you need to start from the beginning again , now beside this inconvenience that doesnÂ´t happen on the Media Cope and integrate the RMVB Player , the watch of the movie even for this size of RMVB looks absolutly normal like the avi wih many bitrate , the user is simply watching without thinking about the size and the quality very acceptable in did , so Media Cope installed is the perfect partner for this type of video files .

Happy movie to all of you . "

globeplus is real he has a scull and has uploaded many good movies, I was a bit suspect about the file size tho"
[V],globeplus,2011-08-26T18:04Z,"To undietaker : thank you for your comment , this file it is a pretty good work tested completly before the upload , it is true what i am saying and some faster services users are already using this file and the torrent going very normal under the circunstances , everything is ok .

Thank you and you welcome to enjoy any of my files or any other file available , it is wrong accusing someone of faking without a single prove , that shows no respect to the work of the uploader specially if the file it is real and done with a good effort and work from the uploader , i donÂ´t like to get angry like that but that comments was absurd and disrepectfull , anyone on my place i think that think the same as me .

Thank you again and happy movie to all of you , this movie is reaching rhe 1st places on the principal top movie charts on the US on the 1st week and the creativity on the argument is very nice and enjoyable and is a foul who thinks that only kids like this movie because the argument is very addictive even to the adults ... See all of you and enjoy ... "
[V],globeplus,2011-08-26T18:13Z,"CAM NOTE : 

picture nice coloured and nice for cam and the audio is ok but with a little incomodative reverbe effects at some points of the movie but still understandable , of course that wasn´t my work that did that , the original cam used to make the conversions was already like that too .

Thank you for understand and happy movie ."
