,exaulted,2011-08-26T20:38Z,"I can understand why some would want a smaller size, but I don't understand why those people think they have a right to deny others of wanting a larger size.

As for me, I prefer 1080p, 16GB or bigger, English subtitles included. I look for that quality first and work my way down. I don't waste my time with anything less than 720p and less than anything around 5GB.

BOZX, your time and effort is greatly appreciated!"

When I convert the MKV in order to play the movie on my PS3, the sound is very weak, tinny, and echoey (unwatchable). Been using MKV2VOB for a long time and this has only started happening recently. Any ideas?"

I don't want to DL this to find out it is DTS only as my receiver doesn't support DTS and I want to have actual 5.1... so AC3 would be great... anyone know?"
,sting88,2011-10-29T08:48Z,"Ended up downloading this anyways to see what audio codec is uses.

Not sure why the descriptions says AC3 and DTS... which would imply it has a channel for both that you can select... however there is most definitely not an AC3 channel.

This file is DTS only!"
