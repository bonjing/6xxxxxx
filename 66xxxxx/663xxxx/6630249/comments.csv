,EffMinor,2011-08-30T11:01Z,it works for a like 2 days then it says market unable to verify or something.. then i cant use it so now im using winamp to play my music (which still kinda sucks)
,aliazez,2011-08-30T17:42Z,Works great on SGT. Fantastic program too.
,gigabyteme,2011-09-01T20:19Z,"Thank you for buying PowerAMP Full Version!
Please do not uninstall PowerAMP Full Version Unlocker application if you want to keep Full Version available on this device.

EffMinor try reinstalling the program. I'm still using this program with no hiccups, and everytime I start the program I get the message above. Hope you allowed apps to be installed outside the android market."
,pain2gain,2011-09-11T04:47Z,"works!

@ effminor - if you go into manage apps and choose Power Amp and then clear the cache (data) the program will work again. you may have to keep doing it every few days, but the app is worth it.."
,jimdsouza,2011-09-11T21:45Z,@pain2gain Thanks mate! was experiencing exact same problem!
,gaisboy,2011-09-21T15:04Z,Thanks!

,loveinthespace,2011-10-20T18:47Z,"Hey gigabyteme, thank you soo much for the app!
It works on the Samsung Galaxy S II but I wanted to give this app an update! How? or you can upload a recent full version of it? (1.4 build 387) would be very nice of you. Thanks."
