[V],_F1_,2011-09-06T05:39Z,"The patch will ask for two files that you have to point manually in the appeared browse box:

1. Dolphins 3D Screensaver.exe
path: C:\Program Files\Dolphins 3D Screensaver\Dolphins 3D Screensaver.exe
and 2. Dolphins 3D Screensaver.scr
path: C:\Windows\System32\Dolphins 3D Screensaver.scr

These are paths of 32bit system. 64bit may differ. If you can't locate the file; make a search in explorer. If everything goes OK; you'll have a log like this:
