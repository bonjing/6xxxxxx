Armstrong Powerhouse presents a scenario pack dedicated to the class 67 locomotive. This pack contains six prototypical scenarios which explore the mail workings that these locomotives were built for as well as more recent operations such as Network Rail test trains and thunderbird duties on the east coast mainline. Passing AI traffic offers realism, variety and interest through the use of various other locomotive and rolling stock packs so you can squeeze every last penny of value out of your previous purchases and re-create accurate scenes from the past to the present.

To further increase realism, each scenario uses the timetable of its relevant year to create an as realistic experience as possible. As well as this, most trains have their time of leaving, origin and destination so you can see which train is which!
