,tpb_4_ever,2011-08-29T11:21Z,If u downloaded railworks 2 from TPB will u still get the free update to TS2012 (railworks 3)
,RailGamer,2011-08-29T15:46Z,"@tpb_4_ever Most certainly not, if you have downloaded RailWorks from TPB it will not update at all as it's not connected to STEAM i however do have a legal version of RailWorks 2 which i will be using the files to upload RailWorks 3, i personally use TPB copy as it allows me to use all the addons. You can update your copy of RailWorks 2 to V117.3a the latest version at the moment using this torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6614135/RailWorks_-_Portsmouth_Direct_Line where i have included 117.3a and will work on Pirated Versions of RailWorks!"
