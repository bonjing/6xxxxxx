Ricky Martin is a talented Latino performer with some nice songs
along the way - from what is an eclectic range of performing 
he has been slated and scripted for now and then, and this tends to confuse
his image. He always deserved more better I should say.

That said, I suggest the songs picked for this torrent are the ones most worth 
enjoying as his best effort thus far, and as fit for any great collection 
of Euro favorites equally.


Just 40MB total and at 256k bitrate for this audience that is wanting
and willing!
