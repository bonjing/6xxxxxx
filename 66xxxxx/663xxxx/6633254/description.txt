Amazon Review:
Just when you thought the current surplus of pop princesses would cause the leather-miniskirted bottom to drop out, along vamps Christina Milian with a crackling new CD whose 12 songs outshine "AM to PM," her 2001 hit. In the Cuban-American Milian, J-Lo has found her heir apparent (not that she was looking): The songs spotlight a similar sex-i-fied energy, jumbling attitude, vulnerability, and a jigger of jadedness into a heaving, R&B-leaning, red-hot heap. The secret is whip-smart production -- credit players who have worked with Alicia Keys, J-Lo, and Mariah Carey -- especially on "I Need More," which showcases an array of pings, pulses, and from-the-gut guitar. When we're not singing along to lyrics like "It'll be a cold day in hell before you see your girl shed another tear, boy you better hear me," bottom lip pushed out for emphasis, we're shouting "go, girl" from the sidelines. Or at least wanting to. If the radio hit "Dip It Low" hasn't pushed you to pick up this disc already, it is, in fact, about time.
