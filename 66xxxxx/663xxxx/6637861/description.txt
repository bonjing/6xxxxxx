Readers Digest Music - complete 3CD set at great 192k bitrate
as is appropriate for this content (320k can sound too dull to the senses
on the music that is mainly concentrated into the high frequencies range
- live and learn I would say!)

Here is a nice set of orchestral mp3s for your cafe, relaxing evening
or wherever mood music is the right way to go - rather than rap. punk
or any other form of mental abuse in our environments.
Learn some sensitive courtesy eh! Give folks something nicer to tolerate
instead and the world will be a fairer, saner and therefore happier place!
