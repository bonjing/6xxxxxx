(a) It is 2011, disk space is very cheap, burning to CD is retarded so no point in < 700 MB
(b) It really is 2011, MKV is better than AVI. Get a player that works

Thanks!! "
,tai69,2011-09-01T18:17Z,"Would someone please tell Harry Watson.

1) MKV files suck - when you convert them to DVD format the audio is usually out of sync with the video.
2) No DVD players can play MKV format.
3) Not everyone wants to watch a movie on their computer, especially if they have a 56"" TV
4) Running a cable from your computer to your TV to play a movie is lame
5) There is a reason most movies are in avi format."
,virtueso,2011-09-01T19:36Z,"well, i dont know aboout you fuckaaas ^^ but my 46'' samsung lcd plays movies straight out of my external hdd via usb, and it supports mkv as well..so yeah sell your friggin 56'' and get a tv with external hdd compatibility. i'm being unreasonable?f*ck you ! hhahaha!!!"
,ledamay,2011-09-01T22:05Z,"@tai69

Running one's computer to the TV is lame?
Are you retarded?  I use a 21"" and 42"" dual monitor and love the fact my cable TV thru a Hauppage card and anything on my computer I can simply drag to the larger TV/monitor.. 
Yes it is 2011.. Get with it TARD!

,ninline,2011-10-07T03:04Z,"I bought a wd hdtv live box that plays 1080p right out to the tv.  It plays damn near any format even shitty wmv files.  MKV works great on it, it's got two usb ports and ethernet.  Plug a usb hd into it and hook up the cat5 cable to the router and away I went.  I can stream to it, it does netflix, hulu and youtube too.  All for 99 dollars.  It's 2011 and I haven't burned a damn DVD in over a year except to give stuff to other people.  If you hate mkv then it's simple and free to convert it to avi if you must but really, it's not 1999 anymore."
