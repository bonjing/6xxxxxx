,OmniusPrime,2011-08-27T05:05Z,"Cool! Thanks! Now I can stop the DL of 77v1 that's been stuck at 64% since July 11 ... still need seeds of all the 80s and 91,92,97 ... most of which are stuck at 95%+ ..."
,wimjr,2011-08-27T14:33Z,Thank you.
,OmniusPrime,2011-08-27T15:14Z,"@paul: Thanks! there's around 9 of us all stuck at 80something% on that one, so it shouldn't take too long to get at least one other seed. I'll keep mine active for a day or two after it's done so you can move to the next one. Much appreciated!"

Anyone looking for seeds for disks 78+, I'll be uploading new fixed v2 versions but obviously that'll take awhile. Thanks anyone who wants to reseed them here, or people can search ""dimlan"" on demonoid where it looks like they're still seeded. "
