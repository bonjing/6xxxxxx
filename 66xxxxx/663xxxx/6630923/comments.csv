,freedomdwarf,2011-10-10T09:21Z,"Absolutely terrible!
A1/V3.
Crap audio - especially at the front altho the rest of the film was better.
Video very dark and unwatchable in many places.
Not good. I'll wait for the blue-ray rip."

,DieHardNinja,2011-10-29T12:16Z,Too bad this isn't a good copy of this film.  It seems everyone is waiting for the HD/BlueRay to be ripped and posted.  Thanks to everyone for giving a heads up about this so I don't waste my time! :-)
,BrandonCH19,2011-11-02T04:13Z,"Some people dont realize that, until the movie is released on DVD/Blu-Ray, there will never be a PERFECT quality copy of the movie because nobody can sneak a full HD camera into a fucking theatre."
,madFact,2011-11-02T18:54Z,"Actually numbnuts, there are distributor copies that come out anywhere from 2-3 weeks before the DVD release date. Thats how I watched Deathly Hallows Pt2 2 weeks ago! Obviously no one has gotten hold of a copy for this yet! Slackin! Probably cuz it looks like a shitty remake to begin with, however, Im bored so lets GO!!"
,burt64nyg,2011-11-05T00:02Z,"November 22, 2011 is the release date in the US."
