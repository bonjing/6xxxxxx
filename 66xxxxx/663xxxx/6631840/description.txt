Tupacâ€™s Death & Illuminati Theory D to Da Z Productions Edited by: Drazan aka Drazo Made on: 25 January 2010 Writers such as Mark Dice,[7]Lina and Morgan Gricar, have argued that the Bavarian Illuminati survived, possibly to this day. Many of these theories propose that world events are being controlled and manipulated by a secret society calling itself the Illuminati.[8][9] Conspiracy theorists have claimed that many notable people were or are members of the Illuminati, including Winston Churchill, the Bush family,[10] Barack Obama,[11] the Rothschild family,[12] David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski.[13] In addition to the shadowy and secret organization, several modern fraternal groups claim to be the â€œheirsâ€ of the Bavarian Illuminati and have openly used the name â€œIlluminatiâ€ in founding their own rites. Some, such as the multiple groups that call themselves some variation on â€œThe Illuminati Orderâ€[14][15][16] use the name directly in the name of their organization, while others, such as the Ordo Templi Orientis, use the name as a grade of initiation within their organization.
