Release Notes....: Yes, this is a competition show but it does not warrant CRF 22 or higher. It has must less movement than shows
                   like So You Think You Can Dance or something of that sort. I used CRF 20 which still seems a little small but
                   this is a reality show so I'll leave it at that.
