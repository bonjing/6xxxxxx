                It's the hottest, sweatiest day of the year and it
                feels like the whole of camp has got one thing on the
                brain: sex. A-Rab, Rachael, Smallie - even Bobby -
                everyone seems to be getting some, apart from Barry,
                of course. Could this call for a change of tactics?
                And just as things are finally working out for
                Rachael and A-Rab, a surprise visitor throws everyone
                into turmoil: Saima. The Ex. The girl who broke
                A-Rab's heart has returned to get him back, but not
                if Barry and the Chunk Bunk have anything to do with
                it. Which only leaves Flynn to comfort a distraught
                Rachael.

                Encoded at crf 21 because this series is less
                compressible than most scripted series. It would go
                over 5000 kbit/s on crf 19.
