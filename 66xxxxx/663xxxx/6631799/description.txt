The annual number of airline passengers has continued to increase in the past decade, putting great strain on the airports. Increasing volumes of passengers and freight will continue making demands for expansion of airport facilities and construction of new airports. Traditionally airport design and airport operation have been treated separately, yet they are closely related and influence each other. Poor design adversely affects operation; sound understanding of operation is needed to enable good design.The aim of this book is to present a new and integrated approach to the two. This second edition includes some important changes in the international regulations covering design and operations. It reflects the greater attention being given to security, safety and the environment, together with changes in the technology and the way the air transport industry operates. New sections on collaborative decision making and low visibility operations strengthen the operational character of this book. Two completely new chapters have been added covering the topical problems of cargo and radio navigation aids and the chapter on passenger terminals has been enhanced considerably.
