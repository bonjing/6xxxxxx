,ytrewq4321,2011-08-29T19:22Z,"Why is it so slow (average down 18.3 kb/s, finished 1.1%, ETA 2 weeks 6 days)? Too many peers?"
,Mesohappy,2011-08-29T23:01Z,"Yes Please Seed. 
Those of us who only watch F1 and snub NASCAR ""Xnascarfan"" 
We had a hurricane no Cable TV and no F1
Think of this as Disaster Relief"

,ArrogantIgnorance,2011-09-05T14:16Z,"jorrell0733 you rock! Thanks for the U/L 

Have you ever seen Star Sports' coverage of F1? 

I wonder if anyone on TPB can U/L it - the commentary is soooo much better, and (I think) the cameras are in different locations.

Will seed this one for a LONG time!"

,Bittornado,2011-09-11T17:28Z,"I'm sorry not trying to diss anyone or anything but how on earth can this be a 1080 H264 when the file is downscaled this much to this kind of file size and the bitrate is so low? There is no way it would hold a 1080 quality, no way. It doesn't matter in what quality the capture was, the file uploaded should be named after the CURRENT quality IMHO."
