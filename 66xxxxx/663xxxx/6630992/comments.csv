,delta3609,2011-08-26T17:08Z,"yeah...but you asked the question first so if i could get some input from someone who didn't post the question on multiple games, that would be very helpful."

,delta3609,2011-08-26T18:02Z,"TY for your quick responses.  you saved me a lot of searching and phone calls.

1 more question.
the guy that flashed my HDMI black console said i had 1.9B...is that right or is it just 1.9?
i just want to know if 1.9b even exists."
,Metalprofi666,2011-08-26T18:29Z,"when you say update, is it like 2.5 and all u need is a new game and it is updated automatically or you need it to plug the xbox on internet and then update.."
,fakebest,2011-08-26T18:56Z,@delta3609 there is no 1.9 b however there is 1.91 which is the most recent firmware which he is most likely mistaken it with because he is dumb.  1.9 will be fine for this though 1.91 only has some minor updates.
,amesy,2011-08-26T20:17Z,come on people seed
,wayner52,2011-08-27T19:32Z,"To help clarify, you must update your dashboard to version 13599. If not, then the game will not play. Here's a short summary of what to do:

1. if you have a spoofed dvd drive on your console, return it to stock firmware.
2. Upgrade the dash to 13599 (I use the usb method so I don't have to connect to XBL.
3. The upgrade will flash new firmware into your dvd drive so you need to spoof it again if you're to play downloaded games
4. Spoof your dvd drive with LT 1.9 OR LT  1.91. I believe 1.91 is better when using the new dashboard 13599. 

This worked completely for me. Now, you know the game isn't to be released for couple more days so don't expect abgx360 to help you with verification that the game is valid yet. But it will let you know if you have a valid ISO, that it's region-free, etc.

Feel free to email me at WayneLoE@gmail.com if you have any questions about this. I realize a lot of people want to play downloaded games and don't know how.  "
,amesy,2011-08-27T23:51Z,"look people dont let a few idiots on here put you off from DL this game,if you have already DL deus ex,and it works on you box this will as well.."

,amesy,2011-08-28T16:04Z,game works........
,amesy,2011-08-28T16:25Z,"sorry if i have missed lead a few on here ,but this game is asking for updates once you load it to your hd..this is what ive found out..

Lt+ 1.9 users can safely update their consoles but after the update, they wont be able to play Ap2.5 games. 

"

,shiftyboi,2011-09-03T19:31Z,"wot the new dash does (Refllashes Dvd Drive
New AP2.5 challenges
Added support for Sterioscopic 3d for enabled TV's
Locks the SPI on the 9504/0272 (slim) chips so their write is disabled so you can not write fw to them anymore just like the 0225 drive which comes disbled by default.
Once write is disabled only way to write to your drive again is to mod the chip or replace the PCB"
,tangmonk,2011-09-05T09:16Z,"guys! (and gals?).

the dashboard update that comes with this game is f*cked up, before you can play the game you have to update, but the update used from the disc doesn't work, it won't complete and you won't be able to use your xbox AT ALL!

the latest update will reset (de-flash) your drive, you will then have to get it re-flashed.

what to do? download the update from the microsoft xbox site, put it on a USB drive and plug it in. then turn on your xbox, it will load straight from the USB and de-flash and reset your system so the error message you got from trying to update from the game is now totally gone. then you will just have to get it re-flashed to LT+ 1.91 (for me anyways).

you should then be able to put in this game and play it as it should bypass the update on the disc, as you have already updated it using the USB drive. I can't confirm this though as i haven't got mine re-flashed yet.

good luck."
,mikethegreat4,2011-09-06T21:11Z,"@tangmonk, I tried what you said to do and it didn't work, it just reads the disc and goes back to the screen to put the disc in to update. Could i have this problem because I didn't apply the wave 13 to the disc?"
,gladiatorproduction,2011-09-07T16:14Z,LOL some people just dont read DO THEY lol
,shiftyboi,2011-09-07T16:26Z,just got mine reflashed and the problam  is the chip in the xbox will need to b replaced and reflashed again 
,shiftyboi,2011-09-07T16:30Z,mikethegrat4 you had same prob as me did you not read comments b4 you commented lol
,darron66,2011-09-08T04:20Z,"I don't understand how an update can reset your firmware when to get your firmware altered you have to hook it up to a pc ? I recently bought DRIVER:SF and it updated my system, BODYCOUNT now plays and I have a hitachi drive with 1.4fw, all other older back-ups work still including the new DEAD ISLAND, I wave 3 patch all my games and all have so far worked."
,micko84,2011-09-08T13:03Z,those with flashed drives. best way to get this working is to reflash with the stock firmware. download the update from xbox site for usb. update. then reflash with 1.91 and the game works fine
,mikethegreat4,2011-09-09T03:33Z,"I did it days before the comment I had made. Anyways, where do you buy a chip and is there tutorials on how to fix it? That stuff is totally foreign to me. "
,micko84,2011-09-10T23:33Z,"@mikethegreat4 you can buy the chip from any mod website, but its much easyier to just pay for someone to do it for you, its alot of messing around to fix that. "
,Powerslave0,2011-09-30T04:04Z,"darron66:  Microsoft IS flashing drives with stock firmware with their new updates.  However, Hitachi < 78 are not being flashed.  This flash routine is in the update, you don't need to know HOW, just know it DOES."
