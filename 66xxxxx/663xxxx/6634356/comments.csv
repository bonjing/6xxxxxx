,Durhon,2011-08-28T05:22Z,@timotay89 Give it sometime the Confidentials usually come out later in the day.
,Leonidas123,2011-08-28T09:20Z,only 99 MB ?
,Vastiny,2011-08-28T16:04Z,"Can someone tell if this is fake or not?

I do not trust 99 MBs when it says HDTV in the title..."
,dhenryo,2011-08-28T23:52Z,"@Vastiny - I just finished watching this episode. Do not worry about the 99 MB file size... it opened in iTunes, so it seems to have been compressed for *mobile devices* 

The quality is perfectly acceptable."
,k3nd00d,2011-08-29T00:50Z,Try looking at the comments on my previous torrents.  ;-)
,k3nd00d,2011-08-29T00:52Z,"P.S. ""HDTV"" states the source, the ""272p.H264.AAC"" and the specifics in the description tell you what form the resulting video is in."
,ArtieT,2011-08-29T10:35Z,"It's not fake, just highly compressed. 'Full' HD is 1080p, and this is 272p, as the encoder/uploader says.

 If you look around you may see other videos using the improved compression qualities of the H264 (or x-264) codec, with numbers like 325p or 480p, etc..."
