Jason Derulo raises the temperature up in his new track "That's My Shhh", included on the Miami singer's second studio album "Future History" - This 'baby-making' song was released in late August 2011 as the first promotional single from the iTunes 'Countdown' campaign preceding Jason's album release. "That's My Shhh" is not a bad song but it's far from Jason's best work.
