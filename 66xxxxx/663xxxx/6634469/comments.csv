Warning: The audio on this movie is a bit shitty, but it gets better as the movie goes on. Sorry, but that's how I found it -- it's probably a rip of a rip of a VHS tape. 
Remember VHS tapes? They're ancient fossils from the Neolithic Era! You can find them at your local museum today..."
[T],kimeesteres,2011-09-05T07:03Z,"Sorry this is downloading so slowly, but there's only 3 seeders and 7 in the queue, and my upload speed can't handle it all.

If everyone who downloads this torrent could please seed it to at least a 1.0 ratio, that would make it a much more efficient download for everyone. Seeders are cool! :) "
[T],kimeesteres,2011-09-30T07:13Z,"Desperately seeking seeders!!!

I'm seeding this torrent 24/7, and it's taking forever for the peers because I don't have enough upload speed to go around.

Please, if you download this torrent, seed it back to at least a 1.0 ratio, preferably more. Thanks, everybody!"
