This book is intended to attract the attention of practitioners and researchers from industry and academia interested in challenging paradigms of multimedia video coding, with an emphasis on recent technical developments, cross-disciplinary tools and implementations. Given its instructional purpose, the book also overviews recently published video coding standards such as H.264/AVC and SVC from a simulational standpoint. Novel rate control schemes and cross-disciplinary tools for the optimization of diverse aspects related to video coding are also addressed in detail, along with implementation architectures specially tailored for video processing and encoding. The book concludes by exposing new advances in semantic video coding. In summary: this book serves as a technically sounding start point for early-stage researchers and developers willing to join leading-edge research on video coding, processing and multimedia transmission.
