Anyone know if there are any subtitles available for this version?"
,ricky5005,2011-09-15T01:03Z,"Found some here http://www.tvsubtitles.net/subtitle-181909.html . 

They may be a little out of sync, but better than the others I found."
,ricky5005,2011-09-15T01:46Z,"Scratch that, they're out of sync pretty much the whole way through."
