This is another project by Cicero.
He has made this from HD videos (720 and 1080), and it is the complete show !
The quality overall is very nice. Cicero has authored also a bluray of this show, but my connection is not very good, I canÂ´t upload it.
If somebody has a seedbox or a very good connection and want to seed the BD, just send me a pm or post in the thread.
ThereÂ´s no cover for it, so feel free to post one and share !
This requires a double layer dvd. You can split it in 2 dvd5 or shrink it.
