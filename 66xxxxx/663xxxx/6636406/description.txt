This book examines the relationship between entrepreneurship, growth and regional aspects of business. The text offers two broad perspectives of entrepreneurship, a historical one and a comparative perspective. In the historical part, several examples of the co-operation between regional aspects and aspects of entrepreneurship are presented. The second part shows different aspects of entrepreneurship in a more and more globalizing world. Networking, the relationship between clusters and business innovation, economic transition and the links between social capital and business competitiveness are some of the topics.
