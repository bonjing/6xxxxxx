,Trisste,2011-08-29T04:11Z,why not  550MB AVI version?
,Zilex,2011-08-29T04:34Z,Real or Fake?
,bryentheartist,2011-08-29T05:03Z,this is not xvid file its mkv and they use alot of gb's and take forever to download and you have to have a player that plays mkvs
,elrockero014,2011-08-29T05:05Z,"Its real i downloaded it

Thanks!"
,maxya123,2011-08-29T05:08Z,Thanks for sharing. Hope it's not fake.
,Trisste,2011-08-29T05:37Z,@bryentheartist: I's not about player but about codec.
,zerogood,2011-08-29T05:48Z,"It's good, downloaded it, plays in VLC just fine. or i should say its downloading but vlc seems to play half .mkv files fine or at least the parts that are done."
,kingoflight,2011-08-29T06:17Z,"video is fucked on mine, plays in VLC player but the sound stutters and got green shit all over it. 

Not sure why as all my other videos are fine.. an i can only assume it's corrupt in some way. "
,roachbake,2011-08-29T09:23Z,"this is an mkv file, I tried opening it and all that came up was a media info page. I cant understand why ppl even bother with this crap, if you have it upload it, stop fucking around you tards!!"
,pa55el,2011-08-29T12:54Z,"@bryentheartist Well this release is actually slightly _smaller_ in MiB than the xvid one; but, thanks to using h264 and aac codecs, it has somewhat _higher_ quality. @roachbake don't whine if _you_ are enough of a tard to wreck and/or unable to do the basic initial config of your PC in the first place."
,DaBaers,2011-08-30T16:39Z,Final media player is free and easy download plays almost any video file type u can find including .mkv
,DaBaers,2011-09-04T19:05Z,dled (didnt even take to long considering my connections = to a dial-up lol) and played fine on my player...good quality and no sound issues! thanks for uploading :D
