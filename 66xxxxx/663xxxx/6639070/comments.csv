,OscarTheSlouch,2011-08-31T02:41Z,"Actually, this is a very good encoding; both the video and audio are excellent. 

I don't know why @Wizardling was complaining. Perhaps s/he needs to get a better computer..."
,Wizardling,2011-09-06T12:50Z,"Actually it's not, and I didn't need a better computer. I needed a better larger encode without so much smudging and blurring from too much compression. But way to go trying to blame my computer :-D Next you'll tell me it's VLC, or anything but the reality - that this is an extremely poor quality encode."
