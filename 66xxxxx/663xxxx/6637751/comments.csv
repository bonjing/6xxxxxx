FYI: To get full screen go to the: Program Files\Hammerfight folder & open the config file; scroll to the bottom & change the: GFX_WINDOWED=true , to GFX_WINDOWED=false & save."

I needed to increase the screen width for my laptop so just do what Cerebral222 said except at the bottom change the hight/width to whatever your screen is.
Also if you have trouble saving the edited notepad, make sure you Right-Click and Run As Admin then open the file from the Notepad application."
