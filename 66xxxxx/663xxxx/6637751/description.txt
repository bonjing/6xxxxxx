          Hammerfight is about 2D battles of flying machines equipped with
          various slashing, piercing and blunt weaponry.                  

          A unique combat system is based on realistic physics simulation,
          and it ties the movements of the rider to the  movements of your
          mouse.  As you wave the mouse,  your rider swings his warhammer,
          smashing the foe into the wall!                                 

          This creates an unequaled feel of the real strike, a feel of the
          mass of the  weapon in your hands.  Simulated physics and direct
          mouse  control  creates  a  huge  variety  of  possible   battle
          techniques and an unlimited field for perfecting one's  fighting
          skill.
