This is the first time I've ever commented on a movie around here but since no one else seems to be doing it I will. The first movie was a blatant MMA-copy of Karate Kid, yet succeded beyond expectation by introducing new elements to the story. This one, however, is one of the biggest piles of shit ever constructed, atleast as far as a sequel goes. See the first one, enjoy it for its flirt with the 80s and send this demoninfested, sex&violence moneyspinning waste of space back to hell where it belongs and surely came from."
