Remember the The Sinclair QL ???


New Q-emuLator for Mac OS X!


Q-emuLator is a software emulator of the QL, running as an           
application in the Windows and Mac OS environments.                   
Q-emuLator has an interpreter of the 68008\'s instructions, and        
emulates the basic QL\'s hardware, redirecting input and output to     
the Mac\'s or PC\'s video, keyboard, mouse, disks, sound hardware       
and serial ports.  
                                                   
                                                                               http://terdina.net/ql/q-emulator.html  



It emulates the following QL hardware:

68008 processor
keyboard
display (512x256x4, 256x256x8)
interrupts
file system (access to Mac files, QDOS floppy disks, QXL.WIN files, .ZIP and .QLPAK packages, microdrive and floppy images)
sound
built-in ram disk
mouse support
partial Gold Card emulation (to allow SMSQ/E to run)
