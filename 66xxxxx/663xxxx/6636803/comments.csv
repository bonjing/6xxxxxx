,funkingonutz,2011-08-29T16:48Z,"READ THIS FIRST:

1)  Download the mystery files which are RAR'ed.
2)  Unzip the RAR'ed files, which contain (you guessed it) ANOTHER RAR'ed file
3)  Obtain the name of a website you've never been to before
4)  Go to that website and get a password (Are they logging you IP address?  Beats me! Hey - 'probably' not)
5)  Unzip that second RAR'ed file, using the password from the site
6)  End up with an .avi file that is 0 kb in size (fail)

That is precisely what just happened to me.

...or...

You could download from someone else who doesn't make you do all of these things.

I'm not complaining, or trying to tell anyone else what to do.  I'm just trying to tell you what happened to me.  I""m telling you about the hoops you'll jump through *before* you click, so that you can make your own informed choice."

,Arkanoid808,2011-08-29T19:33Z,"ignore ""funkingonutz"" this torrent is an .avi file

there are no rar files or any of the other bullshit he's talking about"
,jakeou812,2011-08-29T19:39Z,"funkingonutz you are full of shit, or just stupid. You can see the avi file in there before you even download it. Get a real job, disinformation bastard. "
,yobar23,2011-08-29T21:25Z,"Thanks for the killer cable shows, eztv.  Can't afford much entertainment-wise beyond a decent internet connection, so your efforts are much appreciated in my antenna-TV house!!

,JohnnyAction,2011-08-30T00:35Z,Thanks. Good as always.
,funkingonutz,2011-08-30T01:04Z,"I want to set the record straight:
This *IS* the right file now.  You guys are correct:  It is presently an .avi

It seems this was fized/re-upped by the EZTV group as an .avi, rather than a .rar

I point to ""OggJact"" and ""tuggtugger2""'s comments which both refer to the previous .rar file.  

That file was there for a while, and apparently the EZTV guys got wind of someone in their group (?) uploading a jacked up .rar and they swapped it for an avi and fixed the problem.

I have since then downloaded to be sure, and confirmed:  This is now a good, high-quality EzTV product.

Kudos to EzTV for fixing this."

,funkingonutz,2011-08-31T18:51Z,"xlFireman said:  ""@funkingonutz WTF are you talking about? There are NO .rar files.""

To which I say:   Yes.  You are right.  The files are good.  I posted a correction at 2011-08-30 01:04.  Did you read it?  I posted a correction.

Eztv is good, file is good, etc.

,deaderman,2011-09-01T23:54Z,"Just a quick thank you to the lads at eztv. I'm an Aussie so it takes months, if not years, to get decent American television shows. You've made my life easier and have made me and my mother very very very happy. Big ups!"
