,esapxai,2011-08-28T22:57Z,"Thank you FXG.


My first ever comment on TPB"
,ramkvp,2011-08-29T05:45Z,Thank you guys. Keep up the good work.
,coolluv01,2011-08-29T06:19Z,"guys when are you uploading ""Thor"""
,AcesM,2011-08-29T06:48Z,"Thanks guys .... 

@seni
720p with 699mb size ? look at the bitrate and quality frame ... :p"
,BluesMania,2011-08-29T07:09Z,thanks very much.
,ridon,2011-08-29T08:57Z,"thanks fxg!


@seni 
720p in 700mb is ugly. look at the video bitrate, its less than this rip have.
imo, 720p should have 4gb for best image quality."
,tony419,2011-08-29T10:38Z,"@Ridon  @ AcesM   I'm with @seni, dont mean 2 start beef tho. For starters, i dont even know wat bitrate means, but i download 720p at 700mb and less all the time, and it looks flawlessly smooth and fast and HD crystal clear that makes me never want to look at a DVDrip in my life, ever. I recently got Fast Five here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6618630/Fast_Five_[2011]-720p-BRrip-x264-StyLishSaLH, and i could see the freakin oil drippin off the Rock's face :)  . It was beautiful. Please skool me tho, wats bitrate, n dont copy n paste shit, talk 2 me like in terms of how movies flow better or somthin, thanx. Much love to FXG still.

P.S For those interested, here's Thor: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6633824/Thor_(2011)_720p_BrRip_x264_-_700mb_-_YIFY.

The show must go on!"
,ishadhawanisha,2011-08-29T10:47Z,"FXG team plz plz plz upoald dvd rip print of delhi belly, cars 2, hangover 2, transformer dark the new moon, kung fu panda 2....."
,tony419,2011-08-29T10:58Z,"@Viciously   Even better, Yify: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6633822/X-Men_First_Class_(2011)_720p_BrRip_x264_-_800mb_-_YIFY   @ 800mb

But as i said before, i dont know about bitrate coz i dont know wat it is. Would love for some1 2 explain. But really, if d movie sounds good n looks even better, would i bother with subtle imperfections that a slower bitrate might present? Its just a freakin movie. I want my shit good AND FREE, so wth?!? If u want perfect, go buy the freakin Blu Ray Disc!

Peace."
,AcesM,2011-08-29T11:35Z,"@tony, look if you don't like fxg rip then no need to trash around their torrent with other release group torrent ... 
In fxg sucker punch torrent you asking why good uploaders left tpb (kickass etc etc), this is why. You never appreciate groups that uploading torrent. If you don't like their torrent, doesn't mean everyone will not like it too.
So if FXG stop uploading torrent again, i won't blame them.
And for the bitrate and quality frame... google it."
,ridon,2011-08-29T11:40Z,"@seni are you retarded? you the one who start.

@tony419 go search the google yourself about bitrate.

@viciously have you compare 720p in 2gb with 4gb? youd know the differ."
,mildot04,2011-08-29T11:55Z,"As Usual..
GREAT QUALITY from FXG
A=10
V=10
Movie=10"
,boi_deli,2011-08-29T12:30Z,"@seni and @tony419, buzz off! Stop spamming us with torrents that we are not interested in. If we wanted to watch those movies, we'd find it ourselves.

If you don't like FXG's torrent then don't come here.

The reason why FXG_team's torrents are always well-seeded is because of their quality uploads. I don't care about bitrates and frames when I download from FXG 'coz I know its going to be good.

By the way, thanks FXG. "
,2bh,2011-08-29T16:55Z,"Cheers fxg

@ridon & evry1 elz who thinks u need 4gb 4 a film that's only 2hrs long, fxg is perfect. ALWAYS. "
,tony419,2011-08-29T18:04Z,"@AcesM  @ridon  @boi_deli  Fair enough, fair enough. Didnt mean to troll. Dont want to lose another great uploader from the piratesphere, let the show go on.

Peace!"
,esapxai,2011-08-29T20:23Z,"Pleast upload THOR and transformers 3 soon...

Love you guys"
,AcesM,2011-08-29T20:49Z,"@Seni, oh come on , just because MkvGuy give you the name of the tools he use, now u think u are superior in ripping movie ? you think it's so easy to use MeGui or StaxRip or Handbreak to maintain quality with smaller size ?
Proof it , and upload ur movie and i will beg to Velvet to give you a skull."
,FlashG69,2011-08-30T00:12Z,"Thanks a lot FXG Team you rock guys!!!

A=10
V=10

Good movie, may I ask for Thor, Captain America!

Thanks a lot, best to all!"
,boi_deli,2011-08-30T05:19Z,"@seni Thank you for showing us how intelligent and eloquent you are with your words and logic.

@tony419 I agree."
,xtremeimport,2011-08-30T05:28Z,"FXG is the best, always under a gig, with amazing quality. love it.

I have a question though, how do you put the subtitles in the movie?? I put the video file on my usb and then watch on my ps3...and cant get subtitles on. :("
,AcesM,2011-08-30T07:08Z,"@xtremeimport, rename the subtitle file, matching with the movie file."

,bluetooth_82,2011-09-01T20:48Z,Thanks for all great uploads FXG . Do you an upload for the new Transformers movie soon?
,AcesM,2011-09-02T00:32Z,"@Viciously, if you like BR-Rip i can recommend you a nice Ripping & Uploader group who rip their own movies (extremezone is an uploader only, mean they upload other groups release and don't have their own ripping movies), search MXMG in tpb ... or here i give you the link (sorry FXG for posting other group link in here) http://thepiratebay.org/user/MXMG/"
,homernet,2011-09-02T06:55Z,The quality is great as usual but there are many scenes in german and there are no subs which the English version of this DVD should have. So you will not be able to follow the german scenes.
,AcesM,2011-09-02T16:15Z,"@Viciously, just trying to share dude ... no need to act like that."
,HEADBANGER4LIFE,2011-09-02T21:08Z,"You're the shit fxg but what gives, there's no subtitles for the non-english dialog, found the same problem with Fast Five."
,Akaziel,2011-09-03T02:55Z,"Huh.  Okay why would this play fine on my computer, but if I try to play it on my HDTV the sound sync is off by like 2 seconds?   

Also, not to be a dick, cause usually I love FXG (one of the only uploaders who I actually bookmark their page), the lack of hardcoded subs is pretty freakin' annoying.  "
,yelloo,2011-09-03T09:52Z,Thanks FXG_team.
,burakbcea,2011-09-03T23:23Z,Thank You.

,Mister_Wu,2011-09-04T01:51Z,"I've only read two opinions on quality, both great... So i'm guessing this is so.

Any opinions on if the movie is worth downloading.. content wise?"
,edgeare,2011-09-05T14:29Z,thanx fxg we the lower bw populace still appreciate u a lot m8 again thnx a lot & continue to ripz...
,Akaziel,2011-09-05T23:10Z,"Content-wise, this was arguably the best movie of the summer, and one of the best comic/superhero movies ever made.  "

thanks FXG!"
,shadymilkman,2011-09-11T02:17Z,"@Viciously, you are obviously some faggot wannabe elitist. No one wants to hear your bullshit, especially when people are just being helpful. No one gives a fuck if you have unlimited bandwidth, because you are just a piece of shit. My TV is bigger, and my media server is better, you cunt. Also, please stop referring to the uploader by first name. This is the internet, you use handles here. No one gives a fuck who you know besides yourself."

,colo288,2011-09-12T08:39Z,"Question, how doy ou input subtitles to the movies? I see that every movie brings a folder with subtitles but twhen i play the movie i dont see anything... how can i fix that?"
,soul226,2011-09-14T12:03Z,@colo288 use VLC right click on the video on the menu panel click on video >>subtitles>>load file>>>locate fle  
,AdinaB,2011-09-15T14:10Z,Thanks for the upload:)
,exbooooom,2011-09-16T05:36Z,"colo288: another way is to make sure the movie and subtitles have the same file name, and are in the same folder; VLC will automatically acquire any .srt file with the same name as the video being played."
,MuserClair,2011-09-16T11:33Z,"thanks for the ul, fxg

i'll come back with my a/v rating, which is what i hope to see when checking out the comments for a torrent. trolling and bitching? irrelevant and unnecessary..."
,jsallday,2011-09-17T21:52Z,Thanks FXG.  I have netflix and this is better than waiting for them to release it.
