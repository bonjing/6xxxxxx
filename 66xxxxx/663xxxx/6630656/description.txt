What does this software do?


The problem:

Have you noticed that the longer you have your computer, the slower it 
runs and the more it crashes? Often this is because whenever you install
or uninstall software, adjust hardware or change settings, the Windows 
registry is updated. Over time the registry starts losing shape, 
accumulating obsolete, corrupt and harmful files. Left unchecked, your 
system can become increasingly unstable, run more slowly and crash more 
frequently. 

The solution:

RegistryBooster is the easy answer to Windows registry problems. This award 
winning software will deep scan your registry to identify problems and errors 
that can cause instability and slowdown. RegistryBooster will then repair or 
remove harmful registry entries to optimize your PC for better performance. 
You can also defragment your registry for extra speed and efficiency.
