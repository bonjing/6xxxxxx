This is one of my favourite albums ever. I bought this the day it was
released all those years ago, and I still listen to it, to this day.
Having seen these guys play live many times, I had high hopes for this
release, and I am really not disappointed. One of my faviourite albums,
played in it's entirety live, by one of my favourite (live) bands, I
couldn't ask for more. I suggest you pick up the DVD next week too,
it's superb.
