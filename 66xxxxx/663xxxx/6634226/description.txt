The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This thirtieth alphabetical installment is: DC from Ma-Mar

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.

=================================


Mad Magazine and assorted Mad material make up about 9 of 16gb in this torrent. MAD came out of  EC comics but DC took over publication in a year I'm too lazy too look up, so it's here.
The first 23 issues are actually comics (and had color)-this was before the comics code destroyed EC Comics. They saved Mad by destroying it and publishing something different under the same name. It was no longer all comics soit could be called a "Magazine" and so not subject to the "comics" code. I'm not saying it wasn't any good, just that it really wasn't the same thing. This change meant they could get distributed and sold w/o the code symbol, which distributors and retailers insisted on for comic. Defying the code was a practical proposition. 


=================================

Today's offering:  DC from Ma-Mar

MAD Special (44 issues) - The Specials are reprint collections but each has a small amount of new stuff, of no great consequence. I didn't know this was even scanned until recently. This is not all there is but it's taking awhile to gather and I didn't want to delay the torrent further for the rest of it. I'll put whatever else I can get in a fill torrent later. I a few of these are scans of the whole book, most are scans of just the new things. They are mostly pdf format because they were ripped (not by me) from a Mad CD set, and it was not worth my time to convert to cbr, in my opinion.
