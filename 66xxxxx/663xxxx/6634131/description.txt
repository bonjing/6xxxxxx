 I â€™ll be honest - I was never that fussed with Beirut. Like many, I was drawn to â€˜Gulag Orkestarâ€™ by its forbidding title, that anonymous and curiously haunting cover photo (allegedly found in a library, photographer unknown) and the Balkan-indie tag.

And sure, it was a decent enough record, but something about it didnâ€™t quite connect. Then â€˜The Flying Cup Clubâ€™ came along and again I tried, but felt that same sense of dislocation. Like the films of Wes Anderson, Zach Condonâ€™s music can feel cool and isolating if you donâ€™t fully buy into it. But also like Anderson, when he snares you, he snares you goodâ€¦

â€˜The Rip Tideâ€™ has snared me more than all of Condonâ€™s previous records combined. Itâ€™s not quite his pop album, but itâ€™s certainly the one where he most expertly fuses his global influences with his now considerable song writing skills.

So, while â€˜A Candleâ€™s Fireâ€™ opens with his familiar mariachi stylings (and, incidentally, sounds exactly like music from The Terminator), itâ€™s immediately followed by â€˜Santa Feâ€™, which demonstrates Condon at his most breezily charming. Thereâ€™s a chance that it might be overlooked compared to some of the heavier songs that follow it. That would be a shame, as itâ€™s actually perfect. The rest of the album is more subdued, but also more rewarding over the long haul. The title track unravels beautifully over a couple of plays and the whole album is fraught with an introspective intensity. Nowhere is that more obvious than on â€˜Goshenâ€™ - the obvious highlight here. The key lyric, â€œYouâ€™re on in fiveâ€, feels like a gentle encouragement - appropriate for a song that takes to the floor as a shy piano ballad, before blossoming into a multi-instrumental epic.

That this is both Beirutâ€™s deepest and most instantly enjoyable album is obvious. Condon has left the bedroom where he handcrafted â€˜Gulagâ€™ behind. Heâ€™s no longer a promising indie auteur, but the leader of a very good band. Yet, remarkably, â€˜The Rip Tideâ€™ retains the distinctiveness of those earlier records. Its quiet magnificence is destined to win over a lot of doubters.
