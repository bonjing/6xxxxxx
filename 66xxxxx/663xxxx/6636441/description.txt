RELEASE iNFORMATiON


We introduce a new, extremely easy tool for translating .NET applications. With this new tool, Windows application written with .NET development tool are very easy to translate to foreign languages. The tool enables also outsourcing and crowdsourcing translations.

                 

Multilizer .NET Translator integrates with         
Google's Translator Toolkit. This integration     
is called Multilizer Online Translation             
Outsourcing (MOTO). These online translation        
tools will continuously get better because          
Google actively develops its translation            
tools and machine translation.
