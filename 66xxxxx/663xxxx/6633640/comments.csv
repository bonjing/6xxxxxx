,mrdd186,2011-08-27T17:26Z,its not a dvdrip but a cam at best..
,UKMadDog,2011-08-27T18:04Z,Thanks for the up will post back on quality
,5amjr,2011-08-28T01:29Z,"screens are all daytime shots, the prob with the other torrents is great daytime, unwatchable night/indoor scenes. Is this any different?"
,SomeGuy2005,2011-08-28T03:06Z,"Well, i don't think uyou realy care, nut it has to be said

Calling a Cam,  PreDVDrip(what ever that means) does not add to your rep and creditibility, instead of bullshit like this, do honest uploads with honest statement of hwat the upload actualy is and win everynodys respect! A -1 for this pretty stupid Headline"
,5amjr,2011-08-28T04:47Z,"just DL'd it and its the same copy as the other 80 listed, unwatchable night and indoor scenes which take up half the movie!
Should have guessed as u only uploaded the daytime screens, a little devious if your looking for PB cred!

Don't Download as it's a TS!"
,nofixedip,2011-08-28T10:27Z,"Another worthless TS!

Well HDvideos(SIC), you tricked me into downloading this and deleting it. I hope you got what you wanted."

and i have VERY low expectations"
,UKMadDog,2011-08-29T20:06Z,"Now watched it and it is the same as rest picture quality is quite good in all day/bright scenes but indoors/night becomes very very dark and almost unwatchable audio is ok

As already posted not sure what pre dvd rip is but hey ho. Not knocking any uploader i am well aware that a cam copy is not gonna be top notch and i am very greatful for all the time uploaders spend to let us mere mortals get a glimpse of these dvd's without handing over our hard earned cash ;) but the details in the titles are getting quite cryptic if its a cam just put cam us die hard movie nerds are more than willing to take a chance on a bad cam let us decide on what we download without the fake details in the descriptions.
