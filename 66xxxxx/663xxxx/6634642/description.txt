Proxy Multiply is a powerfull piece of software that will     
produce large quantities of fresh, working HTTP and SOCKS       
proxies. No advanced skills necessary - staying anonymous       
online has never been easier. 

Features:

1-FIND FRESH PROXIES
Proxy Multiply uses an efficient and fast search method to produce an exponentially increasing number of proxies. Just press 'Start' and PM will search the internet for new HTTP and SOCKS proxies, tailored to your needs via the port filtering and specific test server settings.

2-TEST PROXIES QUICKLY
Instead of saving proxies to a text file and testing them in another handful of programs to figure out which ones work, Proxy Multiply cuts out the middleman and tests all found proxies to find the fastest servers.

Requierments:

.NET 4.0
Proxy Multiply employs .NET 4.0, the latest .NET framework built by Microsoft, ensuring compatibility with all flavors of Windows but specializing in fine-tuned performance in the most recent versions (Windows Vista/7).

THOROUGH TESTING
Proxy Multiply was extensively tested on Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 (32-bit and 64-bit). We have done our best to make your end user experience as painless as possible.
