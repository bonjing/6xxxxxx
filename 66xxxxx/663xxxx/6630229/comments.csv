Has a ""PROPERTY OF STAGE 6 FILMS IIL-AK"" watermark that pops up every now and again, but apart from that this copy is spot on...

Agreed lol it sucks big time it seems like there's no story plot now, what with all the UFC fighters acting in this show."

,cooloolaman,2011-08-26T23:37Z,Thanks Mate
,arathanstorrents,2011-08-27T13:39Z,"this movie is like a mma brochure. fans will cringe at being feed terms basic terms and the pointless references to whos who, particularly in zuffa based organisations (makes you wonder how much they paid?). suppose at the end of the day, its good exposure for the sport and some of the rolling is nicely done. 

audio and video are decent and as people pointed out, its watermarked in parts. thanks for the upload .bone."
