Olsen's comprehensive guide describes nearly 1,000 ferns, of which 692 are shown in color photographs. The author presents the fact that ferns grew 345 million years ago, when they were among the dominant plants on the earth. Among other topics, she offers instructions on cultivating ferns in woodland and rock gardens, in containers, on walls, in bogs, and indoors, giving details regarding colors, pests (watch out for aphids), and companion plants. Other chapters deal with propagation and structure. Included are two hardiness-zone maps, a list of award-winning ferns, and a glossary. George Cohen
