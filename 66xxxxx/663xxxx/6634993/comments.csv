,Dakannine,2011-12-24T14:28Z,"This is the 3rd installment of the tril.  First one is ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" Originally called ""Men who hate women"", Second is ""The Girl who Played with Fire"". The Original title for the 3rd is ""The Air Castle that was blown up"". Each Swedish movie are great movies.  Hope the American Version will do it justice.
