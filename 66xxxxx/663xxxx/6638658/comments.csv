,Urthurian,2011-09-21T04:25Z,"Great game I miss greatly.  I lost the CD while moving years back, and I miss it even more so because this one is bugged.  I'm not sure which version I have played years ago, but it was definitely not 1.4.  When I started Skirmish or Online game, my main character had a henchman and had a Base at the beginning, thus causing no problem at all.  However, on this version, I start the session without a base, having to do missions for Uncle Vincenzo just like first Conquest mission on Single player.  AFTER DOING SEVERAL MISSIONS, 7 OR 8, VINCENZO AND HIS MEN(who happens to be ally of player) SUDDENLY STARTS ATTACKING ME AND MY MEN UPON CLICKING ON HIM FOR NEW MISSION.  I've tried different ways to avoid this and continue the game, but it gets pointless since I cannot get my own Base to start a family even when I have occupied new Base, (Clicking on the desk of empty base) nor receive any money from buildings under my control.  Thus I am stuck with doing just Single player Conquest on this amazing game I once loved.  If there is a fix for this bug, I'll gladly offer my left pinky finger for it boss.  Please..."
