The Frost - Frost Music 1969 US

A Michigan-based rock outfit whose recorded output may be of some passing interest to readers. They were originally called Dick Wagner & The Frost under which name they released the 45 on Date and Dick Wagner had earlier led the Flint-based Bossmen. 

Whilst Frost enjoyed Top 100 hit singles, their albums all sold reasonably well too. 

Dick Wagner later went on to Ursa Major. 

Compilation appearances have included: Rock & Roll Music on Michigan Rocks (LP); and both Black As Night and Rock & Roll Music on Pop Music Super Hebdo (LP).
