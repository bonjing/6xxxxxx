Although originally consisting only of Juan Carlos Lozano as lead vocalist on 1997's debut album MÅ“nia and its companion remix album MÅ“nia Mixes, since the 1999 release of AdiciÃ³n+, MÅ“nia has consisted of vocalist Alfonso Pichardo, and keyboardists Jorge Soto and Alejandro 'Midi' Ortega, MÅ“nia has released over ten albums on Universal Latino and RCA Records. Pichardo briefly left the group due to the Mexican listening public's lack of interest in electronic and synth music. When Lozano decided to leave MÅ“nia as vocalist and form the still electronically oriented but more guitar-centered Morbo, despite the acclaimed success of 1997's MÅ“nia and its subsequent album of remixes (a risky and previously unheard of novelty in the Mexican music industry), Pichardo reunited with the remaining two of his former bandmates to complete MÅ“nia's line-up, which has remained unchanged since 1999.
