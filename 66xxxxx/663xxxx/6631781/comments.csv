Audio: Stereo catalan language."
[T],Shepard76,2011-08-27T00:33Z,"Well, caprikornius that was indeed a little messy from my part cause while tv3 channel was broadcasting commercials I notice that in another channel the emision continued so that's why I was forced to record it in separate files. But this was only happened in the postmatch period. One of those prematch files are really short and some of them have a lower resolution but the big file is in semi HD (1440 x 1080) ."
,vamosamorir,2011-08-28T12:14Z,is it just me or the file contains only the audio? can't seem to find a way to see the video....
[T],Shepard76,2011-08-28T13:20Z,"vamosamorir this mp4 is quite singular. Is the default mp4 format that my Aver Tv tuner (HD 727) records the broadcast. I use VLC and is one of the few players that can play this
http://www.videolan.org/
as well as this other one
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mpc-hc/
I managed to view these files perfectly with these players but I'm still looking a converter that can be able to convert this mp4 into another more wide spread popular hd format... I still didn't found any that works, I tried Xilisoft, the AMD converter, none of these works for converting this ""rare"" mp4. I'm on it, don't worry. I'll figure out why this happens. Meanwhile I hope you can at least be able to watch it with those players I mentioned."
[T],Shepard76,2011-08-28T13:22Z,Also if someone can help me to find a program that could let me convert this into another less trouble format I would apreciate it a lot. Thanks
,vamosamorir,2011-08-28T17:57Z,"Thanks Shepard76, I had already tried VLC, Bsplayer, Quicktime and XBMC, having problems with all of them, Then I tried upgrading VLC to its latest version and it worked. Thanks for the upload, forรงa barรงa!"
