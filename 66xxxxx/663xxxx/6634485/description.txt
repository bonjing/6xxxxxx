Date: 2011.08

Director: Neil Burger

Genres: Mystery | Sci-Fi | Thriller

Plot:
An action-thriller about a writer who takes an experimental drug that allows him to use 100
percent of his mind. As one man evolves into the perfect version of himself, forces more
corrupt than he can imagine mark him for assassination. Out-of-work writer Eddie Morra's
(Cooper) rejection by girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) confirms his belief that he has zero
future. That all vanishes the day an old friend introduces Eddie to NZT, a designer
pharmaceutical that makes him laser focused and more confident than any man alive. Now on an
NZT-fueled odyssey, everything Eddie's read, heard or seen is instantly organized and
available to him. As the former nobody rises to the top of the financial world, he draws the
attention of business mogul Carl Van Loon (De Niro), who sees this enhanced version of Eddie
as the tool to make billions. But brutal side effects jeopardize his meteoric ascent. With a
dwindling stash and hit men who will eliminate him to get the NZT, Eddie must stay wired long
enough to elude capture and fulfill his destiny. If he can't, he will become just another
victim who thought he'd found invincibility in a bottle.
