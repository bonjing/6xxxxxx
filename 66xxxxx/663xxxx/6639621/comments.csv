,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-08-31T07:39Z,OOOOOOK... first off thank you very much for this upload. Now... does this have updated soundbanks? Otherwise this download offers nothing new.
,Punks_4_Live,2011-08-31T10:05Z,"Yes, soundbanks included"
,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-08-31T15:46Z,"I mean updated soundbanks, new ones off the site. OR did the uploader just grab them off another torrent"
,Punks_4_Live,2011-08-31T20:19Z,"soundbanks are from the other torrent postet some weeks ago, but here you have everything you need to get v6.0.9 if you are new to guitar pro 6"

,edtijoan123,2011-09-06T22:47Z,"I'm new to macs but am sure i've followed the instructions carefully, but no code is generated in Terminal, ""Invalid activation request code"". Any ideas?"
,Dallace,2011-09-20T20:44Z,Im confused what you do at the 4th step. im not very good with computers and im not sure what you do 
,Dallace,2011-09-20T20:50Z,yeah sorry man i just don't understand the keygan osx bit. if someone could help me out id really appreciate it 
,Punks_4_Live,2011-09-30T12:59Z,"Step4:

Open Terminal (its an application on your Mac, just open Finder, go to Applications folder, then Utilities folder and double click on ""Terminal"")

		4.1 Type and leave a space at the end: chmod u+x 

i think thats clear, just type ""chmod u+x "", remember to leave a space after the ""x""

		4.2 Drag n' Drop the keygen_osx, then hit the enter

In this step you have to go to your downloaded guitar pro folder and simply drag the file ""keygen_osx"" on the ""Terminal"" window, then hit enter.

		4.3 Run keygen_osx to generate Activation Code
	  		(drag & drop keygen_osx into then press enter)

In this step, simply double click the ""keygen_osx"" file or drag it once again on the Terminal window, then hit enter. Terminal will tell you what to do next.


Hope i could help."
,ogge7,2011-10-25T12:30Z,Thank you Punks_4_Live :-)
,BAthepimp,2011-11-01T02:57Z,I still cant get the Keu gen stuff write. Im hving trouble with generating the activation code after I double click the key gen folder. Thas in advance for the help.
,BAthepimp,2011-11-01T03:03Z,just figured it out
,plist420,2011-11-27T05:46Z,"When I do step 4.3 I get the message ""invalid activation code request""  anyone know what to do?"
,jimmay,2011-12-05T02:24Z,"I really can't understand. When I am typing user Id and Key ID, it says in the directions:

""For Username and Key ID enter anything, enter as much data as it can fit""

But when I fill it with information, it's just stuck. I can't click OK, or OFFLINE ACTIVATION because it's greyed-out. The only option available is CANCEL.

So I can't click either Offline activation OR Ok.
What's up with that??

btw: I'm running Mac OSX 10.7.2
I'm not new to the game, so don't assume I'm just retarded. I really have no options here. plz help"
,jimmay,2011-12-05T02:29Z,"Nevermind, installing 6.0.9 before activating worked. Thx"
,Minor7b5,2011-12-05T23:54Z,"If anyone is having problems it may be because you're not giving the Terminal any information. The guide says to simply press enter, but you need to copy and paste the long code from the Guitar Pro 6 window into the Terminal for it to generate the appropriate code for you. That was my problem and it's now working perfectly. 

Thank you to the uploader, much appreciated!"
,zloled,2011-12-10T04:47Z,I'm confused. how do you get that offline activation request code. And the offline activation isn;t working for me despite installing 6.0.9
,Kilamite,2011-12-13T15:08Z,"Works and the keygen worked fine too.

Bit buggy on Lion however: can't save anything, and it will periodically crash.

I think v6.1.0 brings in Lion compatibility.

Thanks nevertheless, always appreciated :)"
,Keizer1,2011-12-30T19:28Z,"First of all, the ones who were not able to get this to work are fuckin retarded...

Its simple and easy and just follow what Punks_4_Live says.

Totally works! Peace off!"
,DeadInt,2012-01-28T23:11Z,How do you make it so you can update it? Or is that not possible?
,kelshdog,2012-01-31T13:26Z,works perfectly :D
,aurvindmys,2012-04-20T16:01Z,seed pls
,butchershook13,2012-05-05T04:01Z,"why i can't hear the sound man... its work, but no sound man... I'm using mac os x fuc*in LION"
,balli007,2012-05-08T19:15Z,i think i will work please seed............................................................
,Luc1dity,2012-05-26T03:19Z,"New Rule:
If you're too stupid to figure this out, you probably shouldn't be torrenting. Stick to your coloring books instead.

Fucking retards."
,dimebagalive,2012-05-27T18:19Z,"some people dont spend their lives on the computer and actually participate in the real world! so for those of you that are so knowlegable,  when someone needs help, just offer it to them. I also have managed to install the app, but the sound will not work. could someone help?"
