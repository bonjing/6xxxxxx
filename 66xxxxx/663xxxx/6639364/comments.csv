,tpb_4_ever,2011-08-30T10:49Z,Are you going to be uploading the P42DC Genesis add-on?
,zzw1983,2011-08-30T10:57Z,if i find it!
,RailGamer,2011-08-30T11:06Z,Is this the full version or the beta ?
,RailGamer,2011-08-30T11:12Z,Is this the beta version or the full release ?
,zzw1983,2011-08-30T11:33Z,huh? I know of few railworks add-ons with beta releases. this is the FULL thing!
,RailGamer,2011-08-30T11:35Z,P42DC Genesis does look a great locomotive!
,RailGamer,2011-08-30T11:37Z,@zzw1983 Northeast Corridor did have a beta on the web i was hunting for it. I was just making sure that this one was the full version. A big thank you to you! 
,RailGamer,2011-08-30T11:39Z,:)
,zzw1983,2011-08-30T12:01Z,@railgamer: I think that beta version of NEC you're talking about might be a completely different version made privately that was supposed to be freeware. This is a completely different and official Railworks addon!
,Thootjeajax,2011-08-30T12:55Z,It's stuck at 48.8%..
,Thootjeajax,2011-08-30T13:00Z,It's stuck at 48.8% but still thanks for the effort.
,zzw1983,2011-08-30T13:11Z,It will pick up soon. Right now I'm the only seeder.
,Thootjeajax,2011-08-30T13:23Z,"It's working again really slow, but it's working! Thanks again!"

,tpb_4_ever,2011-08-30T15:51Z,Done. Seeding
,RailGamer,2011-08-30T16:13Z,"Thankyou very much zzw1983. I am sure you will get many more thanks as alot of people have been anticipating this particular add-on i have uploaded your version on my account, i will also send you a link for direct seeding once it's uploaded to the ""http"" site if you like ? "
,zzw1983,2011-08-30T16:25Z,"thanks railgamer and thoot. your railworks contributions are appreciated!!! you can do what you like. I was anticipating this release as well but to be honest i am disappointed. It seems that no new RW route can compare with WCML. It's a nice route but they should have given more rolling stock. the visibility through the am7 is AWFUL!

of topic: the new cable car and bus simulator is available but only the german version. the english version is coming this month. "

,zzw1983,2011-08-30T17:05Z,"cool, thanks railgamer

,RailGamer,2011-08-30T17:28Z,"Thank you very much, zzw1983 i will check that out."
,tpb_4_ever,2011-08-30T21:02Z,"@zzw1983 U say that u will upload P42DC Genesis when u find it, what do u mean?"
,RailGamer,2011-08-30T21:40Z,"@tpb_4_ever what he is saying is he does not have it yet, he has to wait for it to be uploaded so he can release it on The Pirate Bay as you well know we aint going to buy it if we are on The Pirate Bay. You will just have to be patient like the rest of us & wait. expect it in around 4-12 days after it's been released before it's released onto TPB "
,tpb_4_ever,2011-08-30T22:53Z,@RailGamer I understand that but where is he waited for it to be uploaded to is what im asking.
,zzw1983,2011-08-30T23:34Z,"tpb_4_ever: I do a google search from time to time or i check semboyan35.com for the latest downloads. This p42 addon is pure money making, they could have easily thrown that in with the NEC. fuckin right i aint payin for it!!!"
,tpb_4_ever,2011-08-30T23:59Z,@RailGamer I love the way u think about steam and paying for add-ons. I'll give google a try and if i find any thing i'll let you know. Thanks :)
,pop72,2011-08-31T01:52Z,"Hi zzw1983 worked perfect. Never have trouble with your downloads. Thanks mate,all the best from Australia."
,zzw1983,2011-08-31T14:51Z,thanks pop!
,tpb_4_ever,2011-09-01T17:48Z,Anyone found the P42DC Genesis yet?
,tpb_4_ever,2011-09-02T12:44Z,How do you add/change a stop in scenrio editor?
,zzw1983,2011-09-03T13:08Z,"yeah what's with the hold up with the p42dc. When the Class 67 came out, it took less than 24 hours for it to show up on the net!"
,tpb_4_ever,2011-09-04T01:06Z,Taking long!
