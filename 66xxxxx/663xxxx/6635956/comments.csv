You could either try to install 4.4.3 and upgrade from there or:

Unistall the current version and try this:


[01] Open the following .plist file in PlistEdit Pro:
~/Library/Preferences/com.stclairsoft.DefaultFolderX.plist
[02] Click on the triangle for Settings:
[03] Scroll down and locate the following three rows:
[04] Double-click on the Value ( SN Generated from the keygen (-you choose name and org-) and change it to:
RegisteredCode: [SN]
RegisteredName: [Name]
RegisteredOrganization: [Organization}
[05] Save and close this .plist file.
[06] Run the installer for a new version.
[07] DO NOT click on Launch at the end of installation.
[08] Instead, click on Preferences.
[09] Click on the On button and check Enable at Login.
[10] Use Little Snitch to block all outbound calls.
