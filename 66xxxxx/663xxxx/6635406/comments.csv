.:Review\ Another great RUDOS release. Highly recommended.

.:Details\ Video files are nearly 4 hours long, which is the FULL event. The video quality is suburb taking into account its length, size.

The absolute best currently if you want the UFC 134 event. Also recommend AAF's releases.

Score ---> 10/10
