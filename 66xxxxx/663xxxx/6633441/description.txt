India on Four Wheels

Travel Documentary hosted by Justin Rowlatt and Anita Rani, published by BBC in 2011 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Justin Rowlatt and Anita Rani embark on an epic road trip around India to discover how a booming car industry is helping to fuel the country's massive economic growth. Setting off from Delhi in opposite directions, they have three weeks to reach Chennai in the south, where they will meet up at the centre of India's car industry. Anita is driving a new Indian-made 4x4 across some of the country's thousands of miles of new motorways, while Justin is heading east in a clapped out Hindustan Ambassador to investigate the darker side of this economic revolution. Two journeys full of colour and chaos, glamour and grime, illustrating what some people think is the birth of a new super power.
