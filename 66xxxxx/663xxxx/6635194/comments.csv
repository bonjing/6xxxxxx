,oot5,2011-09-18T12:56Z,"Can anyone tell me why when I downloaded this torrent I got English subs when it says there aren't any?  When I played the film on my computer, no subs but on the TV I had subs. Any ideas would be appreciated."
,tiltswitch,2011-09-18T18:56Z,there is english subs for the foreign dialogue...as far as i kno their is no subs apart from that...just turn them off with your dvd remote..etc 
,oot5,2011-09-19T08:30Z,"Thanks for the feedback. I download the movies from here onto an external hard drive and then plug it straight into the TV. I tried the sub button on the TV remote but it didn't do anything. I think it will remain a mystery to me for the time being.
Can anyone tell what the meaning of texted language means? Does it mean there are subs? It would help me a great deal if I had the answer to that. :)"
