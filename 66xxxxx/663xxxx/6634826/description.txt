Although the Red Hot Chili Peppers have received the hits treatment before (most notably on 1992's WHAT HITS?), this compilation serves to highlight the band's peak years with guitarist John Frusciante, both before his sudden departure in 1992 and after his lauded return for 1999's CALIFORNICATION. (The group's intriguing-yet-mismatched union with Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro yields only one track, "My Friends.")

 The Chili Peppers are best known for their energetic punk-funk anthems but their mainstream breakthrough, the gently building ballad "Under the Bridge" opens GREATEST HITS. It's followed in short order, however by the boisterous, slaphappy "Give It Away." Other Peppers high points include the beautifully melancholy "Scar Tissue," the hard-to-find "Soul to Squeeze," the folky "Breaking the Girl," and the only pre-1990s track--the group's wonderfully rocked-out cover of Stevie Wonder's "Higher Ground." Of course, this HITS collection includes the seemingly requisite (and quite good) two new tracks--the driving "Fortune Faded" and the dreamy "Save the Population." GREATEST HITS effectively chronicles the Peppers' transition from goofy party boys to mature, highly inventive rock band.

 Greatest hits release for the rap-rock/funk-metal act features 16 tracks including 14 favorites & 2 brand new tracks, 'Fortune Faded' & 'Save The Population'. WB. 2003.
