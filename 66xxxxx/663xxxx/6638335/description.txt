This is a complete 4CD set at 128k from the folks at Readers Digest Music
A Sentimental Journey - "80 original hits of the 40s" 

This is our music, being made available to save our culture, our lifestyle,
our values and indeed our very existence as human beings of good sense and
taste in what to exist for and why to exist at all.

We are trying to balance the destructive forces that are generating
environmental nuisance garbage in what is passed off as music or good
enough stuff to stick on our radio at TV channels. Its time we took back
he airwaves in all regards and respects equally.
