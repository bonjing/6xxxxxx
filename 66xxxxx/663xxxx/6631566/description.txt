"Small criminals break the law to get what they want, big criminals make the law to get what they want." Do you still believe laws have anything to do with justice? The Ten Commandments and the American Constitution may be respectable, the rest is NOT. Do you really respect the laws because you believe in them, or do you respect them because you're afraid of being punished for not respecting them? If you believe in them then you're a fool, if you're afraid of being punished, then you're a coward. I neither respect fools nor cowards. Where there is true love there can be no fear. And you shall have no idols such as laws next to GOD. You're meant to believe in one authority only - and that's GOD. Those who have no GOD have their little god called "the state" with all its despicable laws. If you respect those demonic law-entities pretending to be gods then you will go to hell, that's for sure. GOD respects those who know true love leaving no room for fear in their hearts, and GOD respects those who are true individuals leaving no room for state-worship in their souls. True individuals do not require any external authority. Do you still depend? Remember: Your material situation follows your mind-set.
