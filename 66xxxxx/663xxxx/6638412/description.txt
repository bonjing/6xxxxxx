Name :   Linksys Wireless G USB Network Adapter with SpeedBooster
Model:   WUSB54GS
OS   :   Windows 7 (x64), windows Vista (x64), Windows XP (x64)

Inside the folder you will find two directories, "Windows Vista" and "Windows XP". If you are currently using Windows 7, install the Windows Vista driver.


This driver was developed to add 64 bit functionality to an older Wireless USB device, as there were no drivers to support it. Until now :D


Enjoy! And Seed!!!
