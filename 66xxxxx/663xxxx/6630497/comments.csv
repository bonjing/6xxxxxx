,jenysis,2011-08-26T00:26Z,"And I thought I would have to do without it! 22 dollars after just buying the expansion is a little excessive.
You're a modern day Robin Hood :D"
,jessemcfan,2011-08-26T01:11Z,"It's a fake; the same torrent has appeared on several torrent sites and it's the same story. Says there's 4 seeders but there isn't.

And no, I'm not making this up; I'm really frustrated that I trusted this torrent."
,TheLaloka161,2011-08-26T01:14Z,Thanks!!! 
,jessemcfan,2011-08-26T01:16Z,Deleting my comment only makes you seem more guilty tbh.
,erikhosteter,2011-08-26T11:52Z,THANK YOOU!!! UR THE BEST! :D
,sedna181,2011-08-26T13:26Z,"Thank you so much! I've just finished downloading and installing it, and it works perfectly!

And btw, you're the first one to post it, even before people at MATY's.

@jessemcfan: The problem is on your end. Sometimes you can't find all the seeders, but that's ""thanks"" to your bad connection or badly chosen setting in the torrent program. Don't you think there's something a bit unusual about everyone else getting it to work, while you can't? Stop complaining, work with it, or go buy it."
,CTRLbitch,2011-08-26T15:17Z,WORKS PERFECTLY. Didn't really like Hidden Springs though. Crappy world.
