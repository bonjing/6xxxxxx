enjoy ...  "
[V],globeplus,2011-08-27T08:51Z,"Download the best player for RMVB files on the below link (FREEWARE) :

MEDIA COPE :

http://www.mediacope.com/media-cope-download.html

Now , anyone can ask : why this one ? because he integrates the RMVB player btween another nice thingsand while viewing the RMVB file it is possible to put the picture anywhere on the movie time , with rhe basic RMVB player the watching is very nice but only watching the movie in a consecutive way , so if you already watched 50 minutes and must get out , when you want to continue the watching you need to start from the beginning again , now beside this inconvenience that doesnÃ‚Â´t happen on the Media Cope and integrate the RMVB Player , the watch of the movie even for this size of RMVB looks absolutly normal like the avi wih many bitrate , the user is simply watching without thinking about the size and the quality very acceptable in did , so Media Cope installed is the perfect partner for this type of video files .

Happy movie to all of you . "

[V],globeplus,2011-08-27T10:02Z,"Hi again and this comment is to make a note about the RMVB video and after more tests and having in mind the picture stability for not too much bitrate , it is possible for even less size keep a nice picture with this type of video , what it is surprising somehow and i am uploading the files with more than 200 mb what in the pratic without any exageration are really enough for a nice watch of the movies because the good picture stability for not too much bitrate and if i uploaded this movies maybe i should say 150 mb they was ok to watch anyway , this interesting carachteristic about the RMVB video make that the users feels really confortable watching nice movies for not too much file size and really donÂ´t care like that , it is like beeing watching 1.3 or 1.4 gb avi or something and no problem anyway and i suggest positively to download and install the Media Cope (freeware) that  have the link in a before comment  , this Media Cope program not only have a very nice player very appropriated for the RMVB files but also another features like : Audio/Video Cutter , Audio/Video Joiner , Audio Converter , Video Converter , Photo Cutter , Slide Show and more ... and it is freeware , so really recommended to take a look .

See all of you around and close 200 mb RMVB files have nice picture and sound like the many mega video files and i am serious saying this , the flvs for example that it is possible to keep a good picture for not too much bitrate , for this kind of size have a normal tendence to get some pixelization after the conversions creating little unfocus borrings resolutions beside beeing watchables anyway , this ovideo type donÂ´t , no matter what picture and sound still ok even in full screen for not too much video size and with appropriate players , i am starting definetly with more viewings of this type of video to be a fan of the use of this video type and this can happen to all of you with more movis watched in RMVB ... enjoy and happy movie to all of you ."
[V],globeplus,2011-08-27T10:16Z,"To demian91 : thank you for your comment but i canÂ´t work for the time beeing that type of files because my slow connection net , only files with not too much size i can work , i canÂ´t put the downloaders waiting a week for a game file with only a couple of giga for example , it is ridiculous but files without too much size are only a few hours and i can have my speed back again , my friendly user , my life maded me reducing the expenses to the minimum possible at least for the moment but my good friendly sharing spirit still alive and i Â´d like to thank you for thinking in me to make that game file but for now only nice movies or applications worked with all the care to give a positive work to the users when it is possible , thank you for the preference and please let me invite you to be a downloader of my movie files for not too much size because they are really good work and you will be surprised for the positive getting nice watchable movies fo not too much size and watching them without caring about the size , simply great to use them ... thank you again and this is what i have to offer for the moment , see you around ."
,5amjr,2011-08-28T01:06Z,"Anyone rate the quality "" In less than 3000 words!!!!!!"""
[V],globeplus,2011-08-28T09:06Z,"To 5amjr : hi , beside that can be an indicator a rate can always have speculation specially about what yourself can considerer the enough parameters to watch a movie , thatÂ´s why any movie critics are not good enough beside the possible indication , the user always have the feeling to want to watch for himself how the movie is or in this case if at least have the quality enough for a cam to be watching ... so the best option no matter what are the critics or rates is to watch for ourselves the movies .
About this RMVB i launch a challenge to you , watch this files and the 1gb or more avis available for download and see for yourself if you find any problem to watch on the small size RMVB , in my opinion they are simply perfect and it is surprising that beside the size the quality in full screen is keeped anyway , this type of video keeps the resolution ok in full screen independtly of the kind of low bitrate ... amazing !!! 

Cheers and check for yourself . "
[V],globeplus,2011-08-28T09:25Z,"MOVIE FILE INFO : 

video ok with colours improved and particles on the background of the picture reduced to the minimum by the dub plugins and audio ok and clear .

Problems during the viewing : nothing special to report , just the movie ."
,5amjr,2011-08-29T00:38Z,"erm thanks for that i think. I was hoping a downloader would have rated it not the uploader him/herself.
Although some are happy with low bitrate personally i'm happy to DL a 1Gb+ file for quality and i'm yet to blown away by a sub 300mb torrent.
I'll wait for a rating from a fellow downloader."
[V],globeplus,2011-08-29T08:39Z,"To 5amjr : you can trust and believe in the eficacy of the viewing of this RMVB files and the before comment is real about the file info , i have another cases without the original cams not so good that i report specific insuficiences if it is the case to the users on the comments , as you see i donÂ´t have nothing to hide about the quality of the movies on the files , of course that better is the original better is the possible work but one thing is for shore : this RMVB files real works fine for not too much size to watch movies .

Cheers ."
,5amjr,2011-08-31T09:15Z,Thanks but i'll wait for a better copy.
[V],globeplus,2011-08-31T21:35Z,"To 5amjr : i understand and respect your point of view in waiting for a better copy as you say but the idea of this type of file is to watch in a very easy and pratical way the movies and no problems on the watching anyway , what i mean my friendly user is that this type of files are another valid option to watch the movies and no doubt about that , if you ask me if i have something against betters copys , well the answer is of course not , they are welcome for shore ... thank you and sometimes is talking construtively that we get the correct idea about the files .

Thank you for your comments and you welcome anytime independtly of your preferences ."
,5amjr,2011-09-01T08:46Z,"I hear you but i don't choose to download a movie based on the type of file used by the uploader, it's movie title and picture/audio quality, simple!"
[V],globeplus,2011-09-01T09:13Z,"this comment will be divided in 2 parts because all the text wasnÂ´t beeing possible at the same time .

PART 1 :

To 5amjr : before this comments become a conference between you and me , i have to say that the user is free to choose what he wants to download for watching the movies but donÂ´t have the need in case of donÂ´t like simply beeing discriminating somehow the uploader work , with the exception of the fake file after download , this type of movie file is interesting enough for many users for many reasons : you can start watching the movie quickly while waiting for a better copy or if you have a limitated connection net in downloadable size (1,2,or 4 gb) for example for month , you can watch without downloading too much  , "
[V],globeplus,2011-09-01T12:17Z,"i am writing this comment just to say that i am getting circunstancial problems with the comments for the moment and no , i don´t have nothing that it is not allowed on the writing , i think is a circunstancial bug writing the comments and that´s why no part 2 of the before comment . See you later ."
[V],globeplus,2011-09-01T12:25Z,"Part 2 : slow downloaders always appreciate this type of work and with the nice picture stability , any nice converter out there can convert the file to an high quality video file , DVD or HD , so lot of good reasons to get this type of file ."
,5amjr,2011-09-02T02:54Z,"No ones discriminating against you i'm just saying go check out 100 comments and 98% of them will be asking about viewing quality not the file type, just like i tried to, no problem.
End of conference as this comments page is turning into wikipedia!"
[V],globeplus,2011-09-03T09:23Z,"To 5amjr : well , a final comment make sense to say that make sense that no matter what independtly of the opinions in audio and video you watch for yourself the movies and have your own opinion beside that you know that normaly the first available copys for the movies are the possible available cams , so what it is important it is at least the possibility to watch the movie sooner and sometimes even before than on the cinema , you are downloading movies in a sharing file sites , so basically donÂ´t get too much exigent and be happy with what it is possible under the circunstances and that my friendly user no matter what it is always already positive .

Happy and nice downloadings to you and you welcome anytime but if you want to watch and it is a real file working on the player , just get him !"
