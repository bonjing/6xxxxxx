From the decade of big hair, excess and pastel suits comes a story of one man\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s rise to the top of the criminal pile as Grand Theft Auto returns.

Vice City is a huge urban sprawl ranging from the beach to the swamps and the glitz to the ghetto, and is the most varied, complete and alive digital city ever created. Combining non-linear gameplay with a character driven narrative, you arrive in a town brimming with delights and degradation and are given the opportunity to take it over as you choose.
