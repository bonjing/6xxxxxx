Welcome to Jet Jock Linux Version 2.0!!



This is a live Linux DVD, based on Porteus / SLAX, containing complete, 

interactive systems training for Boeing jetliner models 737NG, 757, and 

777.  Manuals and other references are included in the desktop "manuals"

folder.



These materials are authentic, and very nearly provide a free ground school

on Boeing jetliner systems and procedures.  Use this Linux distribution to 

gain knowlege of these aircraft and airline flying, but seek proper training

and certification before attempting to operate any aircraft.



You, the end user of this DVD, assume all risks and responsibilities

associated with applying information contained herein.



Yes, for Jet Jock Linux version 1.0, I was "Captain Isotropic," but experience

has changed me.  The new name fits.  I am still in the industry, and make a 

living flying short term for airlines in developing countries in dire need of

experienced pilots.



Happy Contrails,
