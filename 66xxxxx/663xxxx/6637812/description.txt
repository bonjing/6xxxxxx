Release Note: 15 years after his first single release Pulser presents his long awaited debut album on Black Hole Recordings.

The Space Between The Starsâ€™ future-retro-trance sounds highlight a diverse album that draws on a strong influence of 70â€²s, 80â€²s and 90â€²s electronic music. The music of Depeche Mode, Kraftwerk and New Order that kick started Andyâ€™s own EDM odyssey way back in the 90â€²s.

For a producer and DJ used to delivering epic club moments, it would have been the easy option to throw together a bunch of club tracks and call it an album without much thought to the bigger picture but thankfully The Space Between The Stars doesnâ€™t go that route. The 15 brand new tracks are meticulously crafted, unique and diverse productions that take you on a spacey journey through the abstract mind, the electronic soul and right to the beating heart of one of EDMâ€™s stalwart artists.

From the opening, rocket-fuelled-launch of Trance opener Voyager, the beautiful, melancholy collaboration with Molly Bancroft on In Deep to the cool chill of Cold Love and Sunrays from US singer/songwriter Manya and the Mike Koglin co-write Chemistry, the evolution from his Cloudwalking days are obvious. The house and techno feel of Altitudes, I Dream Of Stars and Jaywalker couldnâ€™t be further away from his Trance classics like My Religion and Insigmaâ€™s â€“ Open Our Eyes but somehow that inimitable Pulser sound is retained, becoming more evident in the uplifting heights of the clubby Donâ€™t Look Down, the title track The Space Between the Stars and beyond into the pop-trance collaboration with the rising stars of British Electropop Blacktzar on By Your Side.
