My attempt to post greater-than and less-than characters in the description section resulted in the HTML code for those characters. Guess I'll stick to asterisks for now!

(Of course, I would edit the description, but TPB has ""temporarily"" suspended edits -- I think ""temporary"" makes sense in this case only when measured on a geologic time scale ;-) .)"

TPB turned off their tracker on November 17, 2009. Why so many people continue to list it in their torrents is a mystery to me.
