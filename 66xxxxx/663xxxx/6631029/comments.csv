,Four-eyes,2011-08-26T18:34Z,"Thanks TvTeam, I've been waiting for this. "
,losinal,2011-08-26T18:53Z,"Thanks a lot, I'm starting to download. The wait was worth it!"
,keandra101,2011-08-26T18:55Z,"@TvTeam
Could you please upload this in 720p resolution?
Excellent work all the time!!!!!"
,jadewah,2011-08-26T18:56Z,"Thanks for the upload, been waiting on this.

Just a friendly reminder to people; you all need to seed more, I'm 16% on it and my ratio is 1.5 and rising. Basically I'm uploading 50% more then I'm downloading. I'll be keeping it up the rest of the evening.

Don't be greedy people!"
,rsgibson,2011-08-26T19:42Z,"Hey peers, give some upload bandwidth. With this many seeds and so many leeches if everybody gives at least 100K up it will be faster for everyone."
,cassandra_cain,2011-08-26T19:50Z,2CD? In this day and age?
,noddynoodle,2011-08-26T20:53Z,"cassandra_cain: I thought the same thing, haven't seen this in years, but I think it's rather nostalgic and I actually quite like it, if only for memories of the past :P"
,Humanix,2011-08-26T22:54Z,"Thanks! Taking a while to DL but I will seed, I've been waiting for this. Although 2 CD's? just unusual thanks again!"
,dip10520,2011-08-27T03:01Z,thanks
,greylion,2011-08-27T08:01Z,"Great, I just wasted a couple of hours downloading, then I noticed it was split in two CDs.
This one is in one file:

,Nagged,2011-08-27T09:01Z,Its free and people are still moaning about it being on 2 CDs... have you gonks never heard of an avi joiner?...Be greatful for what you have!
,Etarip_o0,2011-08-27T22:50Z,"people are never greatful for what they have, only ungrateful for what they dont have. :P"
,omaa_kaan,2011-09-25T10:56Z,"Thank you!
And even bigger thanks for 2 cds split. My DVDPlayer doesn't eat big avi files.  :)
For all moaners: yes! some people still need small files. I could split it myself, but by doing this I produce another problem - matching subtitles for self-made version. So I greatly appreciate 700 chunks."
