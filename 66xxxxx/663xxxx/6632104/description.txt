FSX Aerosoft Nice/Cote dÂ´Azur scenery.


Nice CÃ´te d`Azur Airport (or in French: AÃ©roport Nice CÃ´te d`Azur) is the third most important airport in France and is often also seen as the only airport of Monaco.
The international airport of Nice is located at the south coast of France (CÃ´te dâ€˜Azur). The airport is the third businesst airport of France. Located on the Mediterranean coast the weather, mostly turbulence can make it a bit daunting at times, something that is not made better by rather complex noise abatement procedures. All in all a airport that is a bit special and thatâ€™s always nice.
While approaching or departing the airport pilots get an impressive view over the mountain landscape and the city of Nice.
