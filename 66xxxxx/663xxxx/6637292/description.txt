You have a genie that will grant your wishes. But, your genie will not grant wishes simply by rubbing a lamp or uncorking a magical bottle. The genie is your subconscious mind, and you must know how to it works and how to use it before it will be your powerful servant. This book is your instruction manual.

The Genie Within is not â€œfeel-goodâ€ stories and â€œhave-faithâ€ platitudes.

This book explains in layman terms how to use your magnificent, powerful subconscious mind. It explains how your subconscious mind works, the laws it obeys, and ten proven methods for using it easily and effortlessly. One lesson even gives you four ways to communicate with your subconscious mind and an explanation of why talking to it and making it your best friend are important. Once you have this information, you can use your genie to achieve goals, be more creative, change undesirable traits, and improve your health.

About the Author
Harry Carpenter developed a passion at an early age for finding out how to use more of his subconscious mind. The information he found over a lifetime helped him and his wife in so many ways that he wanted to share it. After retiring, he condensed this knowledge into a course he teaches in the Southern California area. Harryâ€™s students kept asking him for a book that contained what he taught. Since no existing book has all of this information, his response was to write The Genie Within.
