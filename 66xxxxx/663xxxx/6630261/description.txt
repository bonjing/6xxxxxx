Talk by Michael Parenti, held on May 16, 1999. at University of Washington, Seattle, WA.
Parenti starts broad, than focuses on Balkan situation before and after the 90\\\\\\\'s conflict.
 
Ripped off the YouTubeat highest available
quality there, because player there does not allow watching it in better than 240p
quality, and I felt a need to have a backup of it, especially after seeing Parenti\\\\\\\'s own
website being down (http://www.michaelparenti.org) for some time now. This seems to be
the only upload of talk in question, and I don\\\\\\\'t like the idea of letting it\\\\\\\'s existence
be dependant on YouTube alone.
