Aimed at student pilots who are learning to fly hot-air balloons, certified pilots wishing to add balloon ratings to their license, and commercial balloon pilots who are teaching students, this is the FAAâ€™s first textbook specifically for balloon flying. Subjects covered include equipment and components; preparing for flight, inflation, launch, and landing; inflight maneuvers; and postflight procedures such as deflation and fueling. Complete information on special operations, emergency procedures, regulations and maintenance, earning a pilot certificate, and appendices of sample weather briefings, checklists, and a reprint of 14 CFR Part 31 (the regulation governing airworthiness standards for manned balloons) make this a complete balloon-flying certification study kit.
