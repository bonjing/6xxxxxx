[T],MrDowntown,2011-08-30T17:08Z,"I started Kettleworx yesterday and theyre right you do feel it right away, 
all my muscles feel worked-out. I was actually covered in sweat and out of
breath - had to stop the video and take a few short breaks. BTW Im not a big
fat guy, just out of shape. I have a 10Lb & a 15lb kettlebell and switch based
on my own preference. In the US, good places to find cheap Kettles are Walmart 
(I know but they have em cheap), Ross/TJ mAXX/Big Lots (any outlet store might
have em in the exercise section.)"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-01T20:34Z,"Day 4 - today was 'butt & hips' and despite the name it killed me. Been going 4 days now, every morning. Been doing Core on m/w/f and other days going through others in order so: M -Core, T- Arms+shoulders, w-Core, th-Butt+hips ..etc. Next Monday Ill start Core week2 and that way my body never gets in a rut always different exercises. Im already much thinner - strengthening my abs/stomach/back muscles really pulled everything in. Working on eating better to help with my shrinking spare tire. Eating less food more often so metabolism is always burning and im always digesting (no fat storage) trying to eat mostly meat and veggies. :D"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-04T22:19Z,Day 6 - Finally got to Fast ABs and Holy Crap!! The video has 3 10minute Ab workouts with warm-ups/cool downs for each. I could not finish most of these exercises :( They are so easy but when you're doing them it feels like someone is taking a hacksaw to your Abs - they work but good luck going the full time.... 
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-12T22:46Z,"2 weeks in, today was a great day - started Core Week 3 and Ive gotten in such good shape and such a strong core that it was easy today, no pain, no shaking, no weakness, and not only did I not wimp out on any exercises including the Core-Row (my nemesis) I actually did an extra set, rewound the video for a 4th set :D Im thin, toned, defined - I notice it in everything I do :D"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-06T05:28Z,"So, Week 5 with Kettleworx Core and I finally got my hands on a working copy of Resistance and Cardio. I thought I had seen all the workouts Shanahan could make up but these are all new, resistance was fun and cardio kicked my ass today ... Now that Ive got the full program - Beware LOL"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-14T03:11Z,"@DrSavage
Ive already posted Resistance & Cardio:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6721013/Kettleworx_Level_2_Cardio_and_Resistance

Id rather you didnt post any duplicate kettleworx torrents b/c then the seeds will be split.

I do not have level 1 - if you do feel free to post or I will later if I get it"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-18T17:50Z,"Week 7 - So after doing 6 weeks with JUST Core, I now have the Full Program and decided to restart at week 1. I guess I kind of used Core to be my 6 week body transformation - and it worked, Ive lost pretty much all my extra (unwanted) weight and flab, I am really well toned and my arms arent as girlie as usual - I actually have a decent amount of muscle. Going back to week 1 was strange, i thought it would be dirt easy but I hadnt done these exercises in a month an a half, barely remembered them :D Im always surprised at how many different kettle exercises shanahan can come up with. I have moved to using my 15lb for pretty much every exercise now. Maybe thats why week1 was hard again, I originally did it with 10lb. After another 6 weeks Im going to have to get the even heavier kettle :D"
,frencia,2012-01-08T15:02Z,excellent thank you- havent tried it yet but anyday soon. great torrent i thought at first it was the same video six times- its not- only the warmup/warm down is identical- thanks again
