,masi50,2011-08-26T14:42Z,"sorry, but I do not know"
,cedchx74,2011-08-26T14:42Z,multi language?!
,masi50,2011-08-26T14:42Z,I think so
,Metalprofi666,2011-08-26T15:02Z,"is it true that you need to update your xbox in order to play the game..and also after u update your xbox looks like brand new, meaning you cannot play copy games :(  you have to flash it again...damn"
,masi50,2011-08-26T15:21Z,Flash up to 1.9 :(:(
,delta3609,2011-08-26T17:16Z,"Wait, so as long as i have 1.9 (i think the guy said i have 1.9b but i really have no idea) im safe, i won't have to have it reflashed?"
,fakebest,2011-08-26T19:08Z,@delta3609 there is no 1.9 b however there is 1.91 which is the most recent firmware which he is most likely mistaken it with because he is dumb. 1.9 will be fine for this though 1.91 only has some minor updates. 
,delta3609,2011-08-27T04:27Z,"Cmon guys...im at %99.5, just need 1 seeder and i will seed for 72 hrs at max upload"
,wayner52,2011-08-27T19:35Z,"To help clarify, you must update your dashboard to version 13599. If not, then the game will not play. Here's a short summary of what to do:

1. if you have a spoofed dvd drive on your console, return it to stock firmware.
2. Upgrade the dash to 13599 (I use the usb method so I don't have to connect to XBL.
3. The upgrade will flash new firmware into your dvd drive so you need to spoof it again if you're to play downloaded games
4. Spoof your dvd drive with LT 1.9 OR LT  1.91. I believe 1.91 is better when using the new dashboard 13599. 

This worked completely for me. Now, you know the game isn't to be released for couple more days so don't expect abgx360 to help you with verification that the game is valid yet. But it will let you know if you have a valid ISO, that it's region-free, etc.

Feel free to email me at WayneLoE@gmail.com if you have any questions about this. I realize a lot of people want to play downloaded games and don't know how.  "
,negotiator2k,2011-08-27T19:53Z,Why do there seem to be so many leechers on here recently??? Just 5 seeding from 62 currently.
,Lobyone,2011-08-28T05:59Z,this game looks lame... im gonna pass
,HOODS310,2011-08-28T23:37Z,you should seed more then just 48 hours
,nubin,2011-08-30T23:14Z,BEWARE!!! THIS FUCKING GAME BLOCK THE AP25!!!! (WHY YOU NOT COMMENT FUCKING MARVEL??!!)
,power_house,2011-09-03T04:37Z,can anyone tell me how to stop the update cause it can't read the update from disc and it won't let me do anything on my box
,zzirhp,2011-09-05T22:45Z,"God I love the utter morons on here who are completely clueless... I'll reiterate what I have seen on dozens of other xbox360 torrents; if you don't know how to use backups, WHY ARE YOU DOWNLOADING THEM?! This is not a bloody hack-your-box forum! There are plenty of sites with the information you seek. Google is your friend.

And for those of you who cry ""please seed!!! i will seed back for 48-72hrs!"" is laughable. You don't set a fuckin time-based limit on your seeding, YOU SEED UNTIL YOU REACH AT LEAST A 1.0 RATIO, preferably more. 

And finally, this is a 13th Wave game which may implement the new AP2.6 checks, therefore you'll need one of the recent dashboard updates and then the latest Lt+ firmware for your XBox360's DVD drive. Don't forget to run this ISO through abgx, I recommend running it through 2-3 times to verify everything is green. If autofix doesn't work, learn to patch the ISO's manually with the correct SS and DMI from abgx's verified database. And no, you can't email me for help, go read the actual xbox backup forums - like the rest of us did - to figure it out. I give wayner52 credit, he was far more patient than I ever would be, so heed his advice and if you still fail at life, go read the forums or move on to something you can handle like PC games.

Thank you for the upload masi50, cheers :)"
