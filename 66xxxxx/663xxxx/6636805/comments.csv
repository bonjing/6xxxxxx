,quasipb,2011-08-29T06:49Z,"This is well done: without the promo files, without the sample file(s), without the uselessly redundant  compression files... but still the dead trackers (piratebay and ccc... etc). 

Thanks for getting it mostly right. And thanks always and of course for bringing it to begin with."

,oikjgbvguiugfc,2011-08-30T16:58Z,"Well that sucked.
The story was totally unbelievable.
+ None of the characters were in character."
,quasipb,2011-08-31T16:47Z,"""The story was totally unbelievable.""

Oh, yeah it's just crazy. Gotta be the first time Curb has been so unbelievable. I believe that Larry like to keep things believable. A hallmark of this show, its very essence is in its believability. 

Oh, they've gone off the rails, what with all this unbelievable unbelievability, I believe."
