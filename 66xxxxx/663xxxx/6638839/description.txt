Subtitles: None
Date: 2011.08

Directors: Gaspar No

Genres: Drama

Plot:
Tokyo's nasty underside, seen primarily through the eyes of Oscar, a druggie, whose sister
Linda is a stripper. Oscar also has flashbacks to his childhood when trauma upends the
siblings. Oscar's drug-fed hallucinations alter Tokyo's already-disconcerting nights, and
after the police shoot him, he can float above and look down: on his sister's sorrow, on the
rooms of a love hotel, and on life at even a molecular level. The spectrum's colors can be
beautiful; it's people's colorless lives that can be ugly. And what of afterlife, is there
more than a void?
