From boogers, B.O., and belches to sneezes, diseases, and demon cheeses, The Big Book of Gross Stuff is chock-full of practical knowledge including a Gross Quiz (kids can see how they stack up against the rest of society) and the World's Most Disgusting Jobs (whale-feces research, anyone?). With the turn of every page, Bart King will challenge your gag reflexes as he introduces topics, terminology and trivia about toilets, scabies, decaying bodies, and much more. The pages overflow with humor and an array of cool phrases that will have readers bending and sending, blowing soup, and gargling gravy all the way to the bathroom!
