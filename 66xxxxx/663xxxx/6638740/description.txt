[W4F PRESENTS]: Britains.Hidden.Heritage.S01E03.WEBRIP.XviD-W4F

 
[RELEASE DATE]: 2011/08/29

 
[AIR DATE....]: 2011/08/28

 
[GENRE.......]: Documentary

 
[DESCRIPTION.]:
Presenter Paul Martin and his team visit one of the nation's
most stunning stately homes, Boughton House in
Northamptonshire. Built in the 17th century, this
extraordinary time capsule was virtually sealed up for nearly
200 years, containing a wealth of antiques, art, music and
literature - some of which is only just being uncovered.

Also on the show, reporter Charlie Luxton visits an over-
grown valley with claims to being the birthplace of the
industrial revolution; Clare Balding visits a house in Yorkshire
that might have been the inspiration for one of Britain's
greatest romantic novels; and guest reporter Ann
Widdecombe goes to Staffordshire in search of one of her
own heritage passions: the escape route of Charles II.

Enjoy!
