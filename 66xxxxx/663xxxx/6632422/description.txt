SHiTROW lolol, this release has been pred into the scene, in fact this release probably use a p2p crack (updated ALI213 ?). At this moment, the release isnâ€™t delpred or nukedâ€¦ Wait and seeâ€¦ If the post gets updated.

That being said, Deux Ex: Human Revolution is an enjoyable experience that in this case may work better as art than it does as a game. And Iâ€™ll always find room in my heart for a game that strives for more, even if its reach ultimately exceeds its grasp.

Note: I have not tested it,Am just sharing it!
