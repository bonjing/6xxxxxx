This book on nanodiamonds is the first of its kind. Nanodiamonds are indispensable for polishing industrial materials (e.g. computer hard drives and read heads) and advanced ceramics (e.g. silicon carbide and gem diamond). This book is valuable for those dealing with nanodiamonds, as well as those interested in a general education of nano-sized materials.
