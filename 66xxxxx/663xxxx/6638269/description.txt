Two strangers pretend to be husband and wife in order to use a pre-reserved ticket bought from a scalper to get on a train , because of last second plans,
find that their lives intersect and later fall in love.

The story says life of Ramanujan (Jeyram ) who happened to share a coupe with Jyoti(Soudarya )in a Train. The character of Ramanujan is well crafted in the movie. All ups and downs he encounters is screened with a mix of humour.Although the movie has only few characters, its pace and screenplay made it worth to watch and relish.All songs are good too.First half is easy going and fun filled but second half takes a different dimension. At times we feel pity for what happened to Ramanujan. Innocent carries a Strong supporting role like he did in Devaasuram.
