Book Description
Software development today is embracing functional programming (FP), whether itâ€™s for writing concurrent programs or for managing Big Data. Where does that leave Java developers? This concise book offers a pragmatic, approachable introduction to FP for Java developers or anyone who uses an object-oriented language.

Dean Wampler, Java expert and author of Programming Scala (Oâ€™Reilly), shows you how to apply FP principles such as immutability, avoidance of side-effects, and higher-order functions to your Java code. Each chapter provides exercises to help you practice what youâ€™ve learned. Once you grasp the benefits of functional programming, youâ€™ll discover that it improves all of the code you write.
