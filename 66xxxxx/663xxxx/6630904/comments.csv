,nonbeing,2012-01-25T09:49Z,"@sigimaster14, i also had the same problem. Could not save games, and I got the ""unable to save to device"" error in the game. 

To fix this, go to your Bastion install location, e.g. ""C:\Program Files (x86)\WB Games\Bastion"".  You'll see the  folder here, e.g. ""john_swarm"". Right-click this folder, select properties. Go to the ""Security"" tab. Add ""Users"" in the group/users area if it isn't there already. Then give ""Users"" full control in the lower area, and save your changes by OK.

This worked for me!"
