,vRIsen,2011-08-30T20:48Z,"After watching my RAM shoot up to 100% usage (8gb) after opening this folder after several restarts, I'm pretty sure this is a virus. Don't download."
,CakeMonster,2011-09-02T15:39Z,"@vRIsen 

It is because you need more ram and you can just wait, give it 20 min or so, and use splash lite player as your player for files of 1080p or greater quality"

,3lionsteam,2011-09-27T17:45Z,"the .mkv file would freeze my computer when clicked, and when burned onto disc wouldnt play on blu ray player"
,m00se1207,2011-11-29T21:33Z,"@ geenotreally Obviously your the dumb fuck, no one is going to waste their time to upload a 16.5 GB virus to you when you can download a virus under 1mb that can destroy your computer, obviously your computer is not good enough to play a large high def. file. Upgrade your system and you can watch the movies with the big boys. Thanks uploader!"
,AuronAXE,2012-01-02T21:27Z,@m00se1207 Geeno was being sarcastic. He's laughing at vRIsen for thinking its a virus.
,Dj-mark1996,2012-01-30T19:30Z,hoelang duurt het voordat ie gedownload is?
,stephenball70,2012-05-10T03:17Z,"English subs do NOT work with Media Player Classic. What the hell's wrong? 

And before anyone asks: yes, I am too fucking stupid and lazy to use a different player. "
