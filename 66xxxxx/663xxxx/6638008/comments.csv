There were only 28 episodes."
,V_bluejeans,2011-08-29T18:28Z,"Thank you very much for your high quality uploads and for completing the third season. I can't watch Hulu, so I appreciate your work very, very much. Is there any way you could also upload (at some point in the future) season 2, as well?"
,haidaboy,2011-08-30T07:34Z,"Yes.  I will upload season two also.  I will try to start on that in a week or so.  

I always thought Flipper was a fun show and really decent for kids to watch."
,V_bluejeans,2011-08-30T08:39Z,"Oh, thank you so much - that's very kind of you! Yes, it's a lovely show for kids and the whole family to enjoy. As the cliche but true saying goes - they don't make them like this anymore. Thank you for your work again."
