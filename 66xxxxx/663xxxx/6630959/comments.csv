,SteelerJ17,2011-08-27T14:36Z,To everyone. I ran it through abgx360. It's a Wave 12 game. 
,fishfan77,2011-08-27T15:49Z,"BRICKED MY XBOX!!!!! I have no network connection so I was not ""BANNED"". I burned dvd, fired up the game and it told me that an update needed to be applied in order to play game. I chose OK. It began updating then FAILED saying ""Cannot read from disc"" (I burned to another disc just in case first copy was bad and got the same error). Now, when i start my xbox it comes back to the failed update screen.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! "

Killing me smalls....

But thanks for the up, been waiting for this game"
,fishfan77,2011-08-27T17:09Z,"Its a microsoft issue. I hadnt taken an update since March I think, apparently they have a faulty update that they admit bricks your consoles. I think this is the May update. I am not sure what consoles it affects, but mine (an older one) was one of them. Its not an issue with the torrent, but with the update. Does anyone have any suggestions? In doing research it bascially says the console is toast. "

,fishfan77,2011-08-27T17:57Z,"yeah, the update on this disc has the potential to permanent BRICK your console. It happened to me. It was an update that microsoft said was to ""re adjust the disc reading algorithims in preperation for the new disc formats that are coming soon"". Basically, I think it was an attempt to break modded DVD firmware. Sadly, there is NO way to recover from this. The console is now useless. I am not sure if this would work, but I would suggest burning this as an image, then remove the system update folder and burning it to DVD. I am not sure if the game will still play or not. "
,fishfan77,2011-08-27T17:58Z,"@cashmoney, unfortunatley we are out of luck. The unit is toast. Microsoft was offering replacements, but not if its modded of course"
,cashmoney23,2011-08-27T18:29Z,i try burn a update to a disc.but it still want work.when i turn my xbox 360 on. it only go to status code 3151-335A-B800-0F00-C000-0059.update fail
,fishfan77,2011-08-27T18:54Z,"@cahmoney... Please read my posts. There was a bug in the last xbox360 firmware update. It will try to update the console then fail. once that happens, you are screwed. It happened to me. The console is toast. You cant update it, revert it to previous update nothing. The firmware is toast because the update failed. It basically made your dvd drive useless. I am not sure if it can be flashed but from what I read, there is nothing that can be done"

Someone also said that you must have ixtreme +LT 1.9 or higher to play Madden. Abgx360 has not verified this game yet."

,Gadhein,2011-08-28T04:42Z,"to fishfan77 and cashmoney23, its not bricked.
i just fixed mine with help from link above"
,cashmoney23,2011-08-28T06:10Z,update to the LT+ v1.9.1.it should work
,joonbugg,2011-08-28T11:54Z,"The drive is definitely not bricked if you installed the Madden update (like I did).  Sure, it disabled backups for a day for me.  I have an old Hitachi 46 firmware drive, and I flashed it back to stock with Jungleflasher, then immediately flashed it to the newest firmware, and Madden loaded fine.  Didnt have to install the ""update"" again, since I had already done it earlier.  Its all good."
,SteelerJ17,2011-08-28T15:20Z,"@cashmoney- I have LT +1.9 and the game is working great. abgx360 will verified this game after Aug 30th. Since this is a Wave 12 game. You must go on the abgx360 web site and download the wave 12 stealth patch under the heading ""Individual Video ISO archives"". While you're there. Might as well download the wave 13 stealth patch because ""BodyCount"" is Wave 13."
,fishfan77,2011-08-28T15:20Z,"Im kind of an idiot if it comes to having to open up the xbox and hooking drives up to the PC. If it was something that could be flashed using a usb stick, I would be ok with it :-)

I will need to find someone to do this for me. "
,delta3609,2011-08-28T17:18Z,You just have to flash to 1.9.1 if your xbox fried because of the update...you console is not toast you just need to flash to the newest version.
,fishfan77,2011-08-28T17:48Z,@delta... yeahI know. I have googled how to flash a dvd drive and realize its a bit more than I can do. I dont have a sata connection in my PC nor a usb to SATA adapter for my laptop and I really dont want to take the xbox apart. I will get someone to do it.. The guy that originally gave me the xbox said this drive was a pain to flash orignally
,cutepimp2000,2011-08-29T10:05Z,why im i gettin disc unreadable i have the latest f/w and dasboard and i use abgx 360 patch?

,modestfiend,2011-08-30T05:55Z,"i just flashed my xbox last night and i have the latest everything i used duke nukem forever as my test game everything works fine until i downloaded this and it comes up ""unrecognizable disc"" so what to do now????"
,cutepimp2000,2011-08-30T06:30Z,man i want to play this game so bad its killin me idk wat to do...
,Suma26,2011-08-30T22:42Z,"TO EVERYONE THAT IS GETTING ""unrecognized disc"" etc... on the the latest firmware on the latest dashboard, i have a solution!

MAC: If you have a mac patch it with abgx360 then after burn your game with a program called ""iburn360""
1. open iburn360
2. put your dvd+r DL disc in
3. click where it says refresh (after your disc is loaded in your computer)
4. drag your iso into the program where it says ""Drop your xbox 360 in the box below""
5. make sure your layer break is set to ""1913760""
6. Recording Speed has to be 2.4
7. Click burn
8. Click patch then click OK
Now it should work in your Xbox 360, enjoy! :D

I don't have a WINDOWS computer but I'm sure there is a program like this and just do it the same way!"
,daywalker44,2011-08-31T19:18Z,"ok my xbox was modded about a year and half ago i have a benq drive i downloaded the game, i installed the 12 wave on abgx360 and ran it thru everything came out ok, i then patched it to a 4th wave it booths up on the xbox but ask for me to do the update should i do the update or not"

,sean468,2012-05-12T17:24Z,"Whats with this talk of bricking my console? Is it just an update that is asked for certain consoles or all consoles? Does it let me choose to not update, or does it automatically attempt the update?"
,Neno911LIVE,2012-05-18T22:00Z,"if you don't have a X360.
Download X360 Emulator for PC !!!!!!"
