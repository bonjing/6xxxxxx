I was thrilled recently to find that The Sound of Music Soundtrack
was on sale for just a ten dollar bill in this town  - We hope to donate
a million copies to every Library of our familial constituents soon - 
we just need to win the lottery first as all we have right now are bills
to pay.


I recall that when I purchased The Victor Victoria 1982 Soundtrack CD
some years ago to post here, I barely got back some change from tendering
a fifty dollar bill! That CD too went to the local library I'm happy to say.


This is one of the greatest musical achievements, with Ms Julie Andrews
giving us a most memorable treasure of movie moments, and yes - some -
lovely songs indeed by the cast and crew for all to enjoy. Complete 
Victor Victoria 1982 movie soundtrack at 192k for you!
