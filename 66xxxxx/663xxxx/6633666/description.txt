If you loved The Early Days you will love The Early Days II!!! This DVD compilation has footage from Van Halen I through 1984 albums. All this footage has appeared on different DVDs before but I gathered all this footage and put it all this collection.
The footage on The Early Days II is totally different then what was on The Early Days. I am working on The Early Days- The Ultimate Edition which will have Vol I & Vol II put together but all the clips will be in their correct time frame.

There are a couple of notes on this collection:
(*) This originally was silent footage and I added audio from one of their early demo's.
(#) This originally had audio from the Fair Warning album and what I did so it won't have copyrighted material was added audio from one of their 1981 boots.
(!) This was orginally in PAL and transfered to NTSC.

Special thanks to: Van Halen, ChrisUK, Cato, Radikal, Decatone, liquid_steel_az, guitard, asdfanofpriest, the filmers, & to all the VH fans!! If it wasn't for you all this DVD wouldn't be possible...Ory
