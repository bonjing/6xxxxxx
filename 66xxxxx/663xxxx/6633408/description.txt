Release Notes:

Bombay Bicycle Club currently find themselves in the very common
position of being liked and respected, but not quite shifting a
proportionate amount of records. Their third album since they left
school as many years ago feels like a confident effort to redress the
balance. Opener How Can You Swallow So Much Sleep, their Bright Eyesish
Twilight soundtrack contribution, sets the template for the finer
tracks here Â– a lilting repetition slowly builds, all bouncy
sensitivity and earnest determination. Singer Jack Steadman's
distinctive voice still sounds like he's had the corners of his mouth
taped to his ears, but it's boosted by an elegant palate of guitar
layers and stadium-friendly drums, and is now more muscular than weedy.
There are occasional lapses into epic-indie-lite Â– Beggars is Keep the
Car Running Jr Â– but this is a strong, forward-looking record that
delights in its own ambition.
