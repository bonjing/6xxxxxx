[T],Zeberzee,2011-08-27T13:42Z,@blumacaw ...hmmm brrips...encoding from brrips is not really my thing ...but...they are great movies and i'll do them in 700mb 480p if you want...yes or no :)

,blumacaw,2011-08-27T17:46Z,"@zeberzee: Please don't do 480p. I'd love to watch them in 720p.
As you said earlier, please do Dirty Harry in 720p and try for other movies if possible :)
Thanks."
[T],Zeberzee,2011-08-29T17:58Z,@blumacaw ...ive downloaded the HDLiTE collection but if i do them in 720p from 720p brrips i think they will look shit...480p will look ok ...so ive abandoned the idea for now till i have a think.
[T],Zeberzee,2011-08-29T18:01Z,@Kokua651 ..the killing is already on my to do list...barry lyndon i will do....lolita - i didnt like that movie
