,MR_Games,2011-09-03T15:31Z,"d3w10n I'm sorry but this site Total Virus only scans a file from a maximum of 20 MB, so I sent a scan of the torrent file"

Muito obrigado pelo elogio, eu queria te pedir para você não parar o torrent após completar"

How well the key is not working?"
,Dizzious,2011-12-10T05:56Z,"This works flawlessly on 64-bit Win7. Kaspersky antivirus says it's clean. Just let Vuze download the torrent, then open PlantsVsZombies.exe file. That's it. You do not need any keys or cracks or unzipping or installing. Even a drunk toddler would be able to download & play this game successfully. 

shakesbeard - you may want to go find someone to hold your hand & help you / show you how to download torrents properly. Either you commented on the wrong torrent, or you're doing something horribly wrong - because this game works perfectly. 


The game is fun as hell. I'm going to go buy it now - if you enjoy it then I suggest you do the same, it's only 5 bucks. "
,BeastNo0b,2011-12-23T16:48Z,Thnks :) it works!!!
,Jan_Vat,2012-01-07T23:52Z,"Hey guys. I've been looking for this save file, I'd like to play this on another computer as well as hex edit so I can give myself a bit more cash. But I really can't seem to find it. It's not in the actual game folder. I've tried google and they say it should be user1.dat but there's no such file on my computer. Also tried my username but no luck.
I'm thinking because this is cracked and all that so it may not work the same way? Any ideas guys cos I'd really like to find my save game!! Thanks in advance"
,lionheart9,2012-01-17T09:14Z,"@Jan_Vat: hey google is right...
i windows 7 PC, it's location is as follows
C:\ProgramData\PopCap Games\PlantsVsZombies\userdata\user1.dat"

,msfuckthefuture,2012-02-05T22:05Z,"Great! Full, super fast download, no virus, no installation. Love you MR_Games (;"
,Edimar_BR,2012-02-10T22:18Z,"O game funcionou muito bem e você está de parabéns pelo link! Valeu guri!
O arquivo já vem totalmente descompactado e eu pelo menos, fiz uma cópia da pasta e colei na pasta C:Arquivos de Programas do Windows e fazendo um atalho pro desktop do aplicativo; mas por questão de organização minha."
