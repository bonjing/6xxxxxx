,gregersamsa,2011-08-29T12:13Z,"Oh, it's real allright! Thanks so much for UNRARING! I just can not for the love of god or TFSM understand WHY people persist in raring! WHAT IS THE POINT!?

Is it just to drive us crazy? IT WORKED! NOW MOVE ON WITH YOUR LIVES!!!"
,otnemem,2011-08-29T12:58Z,"Exactly. Unraring before posting takes 1m.
I make it a point of not seeding RAR torrents after DL is completed and I always share everything (else) tenfold. That's how stupid I think it is."
,CaptainMorgenstern,2011-08-29T15:33Z,"If you don't understand the point of RARing, aka FILE COMPRESSION, you are fucking retarded. It makes the file smaller, hence less to download, and LESS TIME TO DOWNLOAD! Quit complaining about it! Like you say, it only takes a minute to unRAR! Morons."
[V],SAFCukO09,2011-08-29T16:52Z,lmao the file is rared nothing to do with compression its scene rules that make these files rared .Its all do do with ftp between servers 
,AndroidLove,2011-08-30T08:43Z,"@ CaptainMorgenstern: You numb nut, have you tried raring one of these .mkv files?! The compression ratio is next to nothing & negligible in this day and age. See what SAFCuk009 said you wanker."
,jayjay87,2011-08-30T10:09Z,Thanks for the good quality download.
