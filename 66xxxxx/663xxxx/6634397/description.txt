Gary Lineker introduces highlights from the Premier League, 
with analysis and comment from Alan Shearer and Lee Dixon. 
The pick of the action includes newly-promoted Norwich's trip to Chelsea, 
and the West Midlands derby between Aston Villa and Wolves. 
Chelsea have beaten Norwich 4-0 in their last two encounters at Stamford Bridge, 
although the Canaries lead their illustrious opponents by four wins to three in 
Premier League meetings. Wolves claimed their first win against neighbours 
Aston Villa for 31 years in March. Matt Jarvis scored the only goal to help keep 
Mick McCarthy's side in the top flight at the expense of a Birmingham side 
managed by Alex McLeish, now in charge at Villa. Other games include 
Liverpool against Bolton, Swansea at home to Sunderland, 
QPR's trip to Wigan and Blackburn v Everton.
