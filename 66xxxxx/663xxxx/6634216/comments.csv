,akshajb,2011-09-01T16:51Z,"seed you idiots ,you greedy people just downloaded and slept ,seed at least for 1-2 days ,UPLOADER pleaseeeeee SEEEED."
,TheTomlin,2011-09-11T06:41Z,Will this play fine on a non-3d device? Even just using VLC on a PC? The other 2 1080p rips both have a watermark apparently
,_LeCiel_,2011-09-14T16:07Z,"The quality is amazing, thank you for uploading, but I can't really watch it since the screen in split in half and multiplied. Is there a way to disable this effect? All the players play it this way :("
[T],insinuendo,2011-09-15T11:12Z,"This is SIDE-By-SIDE 3D!!

If you don't have the appropriate hardware, it won't work for you."
,coabra,2011-09-20T16:03Z,okay i know people are going to freak out but what kind of tv do i need to do this? like a 3d tv or just a plain old flatscreen? and is there any special type of this i should burn this to?
,neo1104,2011-09-21T10:39Z,to coabra: I don't know if you need to burn it mate but what I can tell you is that you defo need a 3D tv or Moonitor. I have a Samsung 3D series 7 and I play it through an extrenal harddrive plugged in the tv. Easy. The image will be split and you just have to press the 3D button on the remote. Think works same for other tvs.
,(decaf,2011-09-23T00:55Z,ok
,ender12345,2011-09-23T09:34Z,"Sure it will work. Cyberlink powerdvd 11 with a simple red/cyan glasses.  Fiddle with the settings so that you get 1 picture instead of 2, and the effect is amazing. even with those 2 dollar paper glasses... "
,C12A1G87,2011-09-24T17:40Z,"to neo1104: I to have a samsung series 7 3D tv and connect my WD passport directly to it to play 3D films, but due to the format of my Harddrive i cannot copy i file over 4GB, how do you get around this, will reformatting it work? does the TV still recognise it? "
,TyMod,2011-09-24T21:45Z,"Your drive is set to a FAT32 default setting. You will have to format it and change it to a NTFS/PAL setting depending on where you live.  FAT32 only allows for files up to 4 gigs, NTFS/PAL allows for any file size as long as the drive is large enough (this is the default setting of your PC's hard drive.  FAT32 is that of a flash drive.

Hope this helps, excellent quality on my samsung 3D tv through my computer.  Thanks!"
,rogue1911,2011-09-25T17:50Z,OMG MAN THANK YOU SOOOOOO MUCH KEEP UPLOADING THEM THANX :)
,rogue1911,2011-09-26T18:59Z,mate theese are great but try your best to keep the file size to 7 or 8 gigs thanks very much cheers
,thegr8luiz,2011-09-27T02:28Z,Thank you very much for your time and effort to share this with us.

tnx"
,sseeww,2011-10-02T12:09Z,"So i downloaded this, took it truh ""mkvtoolnix"" and then ""mkv2vob"" then took it on a memory stick and was going to watch it on my ps3.
But when i start it (and yes i have copied it to the ps3 hard drive) it lags.. i dont get it to run smooth.. :( 
anyone know how to get it working?"
,Ene_mies,2011-10-03T10:42Z,I have a ridiculous question. If I download this and put it on my WDTV Live and display it on my 2D TV... Is there any chance this will come out in 3D if I wear some 3D Glasses from the theatre or pick up a pair of those red/blue dealies? Thanks if anybody in the know can answer.
,FalconLard,2011-10-03T11:33Z,Will it work For the Htc Evo 3d??? 
,Ene_mies,2011-10-03T12:07Z,"Also, TyMod got some terminology a bit confused. Just for clarification, FAT32 and NTFS are file systems. NTSC/PAL are television standards. FAT32 only allows files up to 4GB in size. NTFS allows for much greater size so formatting your drive as NTFS will allow you to store much larger files. Keep in mind that this has nothing to do with NTSC or PAL which are TV standards (NTSC being the standard in North America, Japan, etc.) and PAL being used in most of the rest of the world. You can't format a drive as NTSC or PAL. I do highly recommend you format your external drive as NTFS though unless you use a very old operating system such as Windows 98 which doesn't support it."
,suchetlim,2011-10-08T11:44Z,"if you watch in side by side, you can cross your eyes until you get a middle screen and in a few seconds it will focus...= free 3d ... its probably bad for the eyes to be in such position for extended periods of time tho."
,yes-non,2011-10-08T21:12Z,"Tip: Download the normal blu-ray. I don't kn ow if it makes sense, but PowerDVD 7 can make 3D of every movie."
,sebbx,2011-10-12T15:45Z,"Playing it from my computer with VLC, I cannot get this to display correctly on my 3D TV, even if I manually choose sbs 3d in the TV's menu. If I put the file on an USB drive and plug into the TV it works fine. How can I get it to display correctly when played my the PC, do I need to use a special player?"

,EbilPhish,2011-11-26T13:58Z,"For people asking if this will play on brand X TV's. I strongly recommend that you invest in an external box.

Something like to Roku, Popcorn Hour or Boxee Box. There not too expensive (and if you have forked over the money for a 3D TV you are probably not too badly off). Or just a PC with some media center (for example XBMC).

It's also possible to setup a DLNA server that does transcoding."
,yogeeta.p,2011-12-04T16:27Z,"need  help , how do you transfer the video through your 3D tv by HDD

my transcend HDD (which is NTFS) is being not recognized by my sony ex720. and if i convert my HDD into FAT32 then i cant transfer my movie into HDD as it is over 4gb. 

Please help."
,TailsSWE,2011-12-10T16:35Z,"This is side by side 3D of course. But it's not that you have to cross your eyes. You have to do that on another way. You will have to make your eyes in a derpy way. Many people get confused what Cross-eye and Parallel really are. Cross-eye, it's so easy to understand what it is by understand its name. Cross-eye... think just like a ""X"" An X can also be called cross. As you see X... think that the bottom of the X is your eyes looking views and all the way to the X's top is the 2 pictures, so that is cross-eye. Parallel is your veiw like this \  /."

DTS is NOT compatible if you plug your usb hdd directly on the TV, don't panic, just use this tool http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKV2AC3 and it will remove the DTS from the movie!
