,Ipmark,2011-08-29T18:01Z,"JM-KG-v1.5+5Digit+ChecksumFix.exe file IS the JetMouse keygen and it's included in the package.
If not,
https://torrents.thepiratebay.org/5925933/JetMouse_Garmin_Keygen_v1.5_Checksum_Fix.5925933.TPB.torrent

Setup should install Mapsource v6.16.3 too.
Patch the executable installed on the PC with this
https://torrents.thepiratebay.org/5924772/Garmin_Mapsource_v6.16.3_patched_exe..5924772.TPB.torrent
This patch remove the online check with Garmin servers.
Start Mapsource and unlock the map with the keygen (you need your GPS's UnitID and the MapID 2478)
or
Copy unlock mapset.exe file in .gmap folder
(WindowsXP:
C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\GARMIN\Maps

Vista/Seven:

,hasraz,2011-09-02T05:01Z,"i need ur help please...
they ask for the product id when i try to unlock the map online. could you tell me where i can get the product id from?"
,Ipmark,2011-09-03T15:07Z,"You have to patch Mapsource.exe file.
Download the patched version from here
https://torrents.thepiratebay.org/5924772/Garmin_Mapsource_v6.16.3_patched_exe..5924772.TPB.torrent
And overwrite on the PC the installed original file with the patched one.
The MapID is writed above, in the description.
However, 2478."
,hasraz,2011-09-04T10:50Z,"well i have run Run CNMENT2012_20Update.msi
also, downloaded the patched file.
even aftr having replacing the mapsource.exe file (C:/MapSource/mapsource.exe) with the one in the patched download, the same happens. ie when i open mapsource, they say so n so file is locked. and i find only one option to unlock ie online.
i'm stuck :("
,Ipmark,2011-09-04T11:35Z,"You haven't patch the Mapsource.exe file.
Delete (or rename) the original Mapsource.exe and Copy&Paste the patched exe.
The patched exe remove the online check (your problem)."
,hasraz,2011-09-04T12:02Z,thats what i did. dont know wts goin wrong
,Ipmark,2011-09-04T15:36Z,"If Mapsource ask for Garmin servers connection, it isn't patched properly.

Search the PC for Mpsource.exe files.
Maybe you have multiple folders with Mapsource installations.

You can check the property of Mapsource's icon to find the right folder.

Rename the original Mapsource.exe to .old and replace.i with the patched one."
,akunamatata69,2011-09-09T13:03Z,Many thanks for this file and all of your assistance. Could you please provide tips on how to use map on microSD?
,akunamatata69,2011-09-09T13:46Z,Hi ipmark I have noticed on another of your files you gave tips on how to use on SD. thks. :) I am having same problem as hasraz. have patched mapsource file (modified date 26/10). have copied unlock mapset to folder and ran it and still have same problem - cannot unlock map without having to go to online server. Thks for any help
,Ipmark,2011-09-09T15:37Z,"Step 1:
DELETE Mapsource.exe file.

Step 2:
Try to launch Mapsource program (this is for to be sure you have really delete the program file).
The PC must return ""File not found"" error.
If not, go to Step 1.

Step 3:
Copy the patched version of Mapsource.exe in Mapsource folder (you must decompress the file before, of course).

Step 4:
Start Mapsource."
,akunamatata69,2011-09-10T13:00Z,Hi ipmark many thanks for your reply. it worked!! i didn't realise i had to unlock region in the unlock maps section. Another question if you don't mind..with the files came 3dmaps locked and unlocked and when decompressed they show an img file. Have these files been automatically included when doing the mapsource installation of do  I need to do anything else with them? Thanks so much again 
,Ipmark,2011-09-10T19:31Z,"I wrote it in the instructions:
""Unlock in Mapsource with the JetMouse Keygen (included).""

Manually copy/paste the unlocked 3D Buildings file in the same folder fo the road map.

Keep in mind that not all models support this feature."
,akunamatata69,2011-09-10T20:30Z,Many thanks ipmark for all your assistance. must have missed the instructions for the 3dmap. Keep up the great work. :)

Many thanks for your replay. But I have still problems. I try to install 6.16.3. I get the message:
