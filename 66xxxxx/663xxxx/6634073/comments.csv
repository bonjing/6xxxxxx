By the way, why do you rar releases?  What's the point of it?"
,mystyc,2011-08-28T00:54Z,"I downloaded it.  It is legit, despite the archive files.  No funny business here. (though I also downloaded the VTV version because I doubted this one :P )."
,JeffRelf,2011-08-29T04:45Z,"When you see a video split into 40-or-so .RAR files,
you know it came from Usenet
( via an automated process running on a cheap/weak server ).

On Usenet, each post must be small;
10 mega-bytes might be limit, I don't know.

RAR files are just a way to split a too-large file
across mutilple posts/floppies.

Back in the day, it was all floppies
and a 10 mega-byte hard-disk was insanely huge.
