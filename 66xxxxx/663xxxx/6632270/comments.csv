,Raccoonnookkeeper,2011-09-09T06:39Z,"I lived for a long time in the Bay Area and I didn't realize until I saw the beginning of this movie:
a) that one must cross the Golden Gate Bridge, north from San Francisco, then go north on the Carquinez Bridge on the way to San Jose, then...
b) one has to cross the Golden Gate Bridge going south to get from San Jose back to San Francisco!
The movie looks as though it will be a good one to watch - just enjoy the scenery when people travel, but ignore the Geography.
Bone, thank you for a nice upload."
