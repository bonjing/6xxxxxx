,whairston,2011-08-26T19:06Z,This is a response to the two previous comments. No spam was intended on our part. We were offering something of value in order to grow the Restaurant Recipe fan page. The unlock code is 5572819 and it is also located in the readmenow file. We hope you all enjoy this baked bean recipe.

,whairston,2011-08-28T02:52Z,"Folks,
I uploaded the new zip folder with the readmenow file but it has not re-seeded. The only password protected folder is the one with the baked been recipe and the pass code is 5572819. If the first zipped folder asks for a password then just ignore it. It is when you see the .pdf file and the baked bean recipe folder is when you will need the pass code. I want to delete this torrent and upload everything again but I can't delete it after 5 trys. I asked for customer support and so far have not received a response.  If you still see the readme file then everything is still OK. Just unzip the baked bean recipe folder with the password given above.

Thanks for your understanding."
