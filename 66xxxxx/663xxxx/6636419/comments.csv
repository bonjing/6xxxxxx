Your saves will be in Documents -> ALI213 folder.

And in description instead of ""EVE root\Data folder"" I obviously meant to write ""DVD root\Data folder"".


----------------------
And final thoughts:

You know, the whole reason why I decided to upload it is coz I myself had a lot of trouble finding a normal repack (and I didn't). Repacks around are in Chinese, Russian, and God knows what else. So even if some of you have already downloaded the game, I figured proper version may still be in demand."

hey thanks alots you make very nice repack and they are very fast to unpack thanks

do you have or please upload repack for mass effect 2 and dragon age origins with all dlc included same thing you did  with borderlands becuase i can not find a proper repack

keep uploading more repacks you are the best"

I know its early to be asking this. But should future patches or DLC come out, would you be releasing them in the same installer like you have done with say the DA2 and your other games?

And also thank you so much for this, always trusted your torrents =]"

Well, I did repack and upload all the DLCs for Dragon Age: Origins, Dragon Age 2 and Mass Effect 2 (DLC crack to mass effect 2 doesn't work properly for everyone though, nothing I can do about it, I'm no cracker).

Just download the game and download my DLC packs. Write them on a same disc as the game, or a separate disc. DLC repacks are up in my torrents, and I see no real point in repacking these games - they have normal installations.

@ en4ca

Thank you for your kind words, I appreciate it :) I should have uploaded this sooner though, it was ready a day ago. :P

@ 14658 

Well, I will not be repacking the whole game just to add patches or DLCs if that's what you mean, lol. I'll make repacks of patches and future DLCs, shall they come out.

Repacking the patch may not be necessary, as I stated in the ""optional"" part of the description. To include the patch on your game disc (ISO), you may only need to replace existing files - and the next time the game installs, it will already recognize and install new version.

Avira doesn't seem to be in the list. However, I remind you, that Avira used to detect my installations as viruses. No idea if it still does.

Anyway, if any future crack is detected by your anti-virus and you need to replace it on some other crack - just replace game EXE in the root directory of ISO (disc). Game will install EXE that lies in the root directory. So if you wanna replace the crack any time - welcome."

I've finished the game with this crack, it works good. I've had no problems, anyway. And yeah, I totally understand the confusion with the releases. That's why repack is here in afirst place. I heard other cracks give you 20 save slots only (SKIDROW?), while this crack gives you 99 save slots. Quite useful. In my playthrough I used 50, I think.

@ Free888

You should be able to use your saves if you put them in Documents -> ALI213 -> 28050 -> Storage folder. Folders differ, saves should not. But I can't 100% guarantee that.

@ Capdevila

Thank you :)

@ JohnDoe

JUST the item pack DLC? It is already included in my DA2 DLC Repack. No plans to make it separate. Making installers for every DLC that comes out would be too much hassle, and would take too much time.

is this going to happen in this game?"
,illiria,2011-08-29T20:33Z,"@ zzdejan

My installer to Duke Nukem Forever does not check for your Documents directory at all. You mean the game I assume, not installer? Then your issue is with the game crack - I do not make these, can't say. Installer works fine. If you will have any issue with the crack, you can always replace it. Even right on the installation disc, as I mentioned above a couple of times.

Installer uses the crack located in the root directory of the ISO/Disc. Replace it with a different crack - and that's what installer will install. I have decided to give you an opportunity to use YOUR preferred cracks during the installation from now on."
,illiria,2011-08-29T23:30Z,"@ Free888

Ahh, sorry, didn't notice your comment before. If you have troubles with this crack, just replace the one within ISO with yours (SKIDROW), and the game will be installing SKIDROW's crack from now on."

SHiTROW is Skidrow but the 'tag' is like it is because they stole the p2p crack and called it theirs.
So some people have changed their name a tiny bit... for that reason.
"
,illiria,2011-08-30T20:17Z,"@ Free888

No idea why would it give ""Application has stopped working"". Could have something to do with Vista/7 security system, or anti-virus. Most likely some setting in the operating system is causing it, maybe a conflict with drivers. Can be anything, can't tell for sure.

@ Vaxan

...DRM? Can't say much about that, either. ""Rebuild needed""? Try to reinstall, maybe something got corrupted. Doesn't look like it refers to DRM as the protection system. It looks like it can't access some file within the game archive. Probably game archive got corrupted during installation for whatever reason.

@ Kamianbu

Ahh, I see. I heard ""SKIDROW"" crack is crashing though. Some called it BETA crack. There's been many reports it's not working properly, thats why I've included this one. I have passed the entire game with it, and now doing a second playthrough. No problems. It only crashes if you do a lot of quick loads while using KelSat's trainer. But that's the problem with the trainer, apparently.
And yes, Avira does detect this crack as a virus. But I'm afraid you'll have to live with it, because for now, it seems to be the best crack out there. Also, I heard this crack gives 99 save slots, while other cracks give only 20 save slots. During my playthrough, I saved in approximately 50 slots, but I don't know if other cracks really limit slots to 20 or it's just rumors."

Item Pack TWO? Havent's heard there's a second one. Will look into it. I'll probably make two versions: will include Item Pack 2 in my whole DLC repack, and will release it standalone, so the people who have the pack already won't have to download it again. I don't promise though, I have a lot of work and I'm really tired lately. But I'll look into it.

@ pnd_ku

I myself wondered where does it save the settings. Let's see...

Got it: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Eidos\Deus Ex: HR

Which value exactly, I haven't checked. You may as well delete whole ""Deus Ex: HR"" key, and the game will reset to defaults.

Overall, finding registry settings is pretty easy. Just browse ""CURRENT_USER"" and ""LOCAL MACHINE"" for the name of developer company, or the publisher company."
,illiria,2011-08-31T03:39Z,"@ Free888

Using process monitor in this particular case wouldn't be required. It takes a moment to open the registry and browse for ""Eidos"". No more than 20 seconds. Monitoring the game process, checking where does it write to, would take significantly more time.

No need to play smart. Your instructions are what I did. Got the complete clean STEAM release, added DLLs from the first crack, and the EXE from the second, proper crack. You're suggesting to REdo exactly what I've done. If there are any problems with the game, they are with the crack, not my release. Thats why I put crack in the root folder of the ISO, and made my installer copy it from there. Feel free to replace with a different crack if this one doesn't work well for you.
Makes release proper, no? At least I didn't hard-pack crack into the repack.

@ Kamianbu

This torrent is the same as what he offers. And I agree, it's kinda rude. :P Some people put a lot of work in their releases (I speak for everyone who does, not just for myself), not just copy other releases.

@ asd888

I think I should have made uninstaller wipe out game settings on uninstallation, not keep them. Not that it really matters, but still... Other than keep game settings, it's clean and proper, yes. Some users prefer their game settings to remain in case of future installations, some prefer them wiped. Hard to decide which to go with."

You can find your savegames in your ""Documents"" folder. There will be a folder named ""ALI213"" - saves are in it.

Alternatively, you can delete your savegames right from the game menu. In Save/Load menu, when you hover mouse pointer over a save slot, there will be ""X"" to the right of it. It deletes a savegame."
