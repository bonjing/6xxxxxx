[T],dipty,2011-08-29T21:59Z,"hi bro plzzzz upload final destination 1,2,3,4,5 1080p plzzzzzzzzzzzzz plzz up to 15gb "
,smithsunknown,2011-08-30T02:55Z,"thanks again for my request.  i really shouldn't have been pushy because you most of the time do Blu-ray Disc Rips instead of BRRips.

thanks!!"
,spaderacer,2011-08-30T14:03Z,"I like your torrents,
good compromise between quality and size.

Keep up the good work! Thanks"
,aronam,2011-08-31T03:30Z,"There's audio in the sample, but no audio in the main video. I've tried VLC and classic media player to no avail. What gives?"
,FSSR.Keyno,2011-09-01T04:36Z,"have you tried BS Player?

So does the audio work folks?"
,Sh1v4,2011-09-02T14:46Z,please seed  ^_^
,spaderacer,2011-09-03T22:21Z,"My previous comment was before i saw the movie, this one's quality is actualy pretty bad :(
Ive seen better. Thanks anyway"
,dlectro,2011-09-05T04:11Z,The image is a bit noisier than NhaNc3's rip.
,vivatpb5776,2011-09-06T11:22Z,Very good audio and video quality. The color is not as sharp as I would expect from a BluRay rip but the embedded subtitles more than make up for it. Thank you uploader.
,vivatpb5776,2011-09-06T11:28Z,"To add to my previous post...

The embedded subs are for the non-English speaking language only. For example, in the third scene (with the doctor), the entire dialogue is in German. This is the only .torrent I found with embedded (hardcoded) non-English dialogue."
,DragonF.C.Porto,2011-09-06T23:29Z,thanks
