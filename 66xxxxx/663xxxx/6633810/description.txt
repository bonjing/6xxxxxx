NBA Rules History (XVII):
-------------------------

Take a look back at some of the rules changes that have taken place over the years.
(Changes/clarifications implemented prior to season, except where noted) 
-------
1979-80
-------
- Three-point line established 22 feet in the corners extending to 23 feet, nine inches at the top of the key.
- Number of referees officiating game reduced from three to two.
- If a team is attempting to bring the ball across the centerline within 10 seconds and a defensive player causes the ball to go out of bounds in the backcourt, the offensive team will no longer receive an additional 10-second count in which to advance the ball past the centerline.
- Coaches and trainers are limited, during games, to a 28-foot area between the baseline and a hash mark to be placed 19 feet from mid-court. The penalty is a technical foul.
(There was concern that coaches and trainers were roaming too far away from their benches and interfering with the functions of the scorerâ€™s table.)
