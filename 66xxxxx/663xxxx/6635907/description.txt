Notes:

BEER rls is overcropped left and right
BFHMOV rls has a little black borders at up and down,
yes we know its cropped correctly 
but iNVADERS not (invalid.proper_1px.undercrop.is.acceptable)

Why we propering this again?
Bluray hasnt got any black borders so no cropping needed.
We decided to real final proper because its better source 
available and our rls hasn't got any technical flaws.
