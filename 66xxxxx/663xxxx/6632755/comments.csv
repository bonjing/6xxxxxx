,DarthDerp,2011-08-29T13:06Z,"Thanks for this, jak.

I have the 26 original issues of Ruse and was planning on bookbinding them, but I think I'll get these four comics and wait and see what else Marvel's will do."
,DarthDerp,2011-08-29T13:13Z,[OCD kicks in] Can't forget the Crossgen Archard's Agents comics. There's three issues of those also. [/OCD] 
,jakcreed,2011-09-01T18:06Z,"Wow totally missed the comics here.
@punkway Thanks for reminding me about Crux.  For some reason I thought I had already ULed it.
@Darthderp you may still want to get them bound, although there are some trade paperbacks kicking around.  However Ruse seems to be the only series that Marvel is launching with continuity so they may eventually republish them.
I'll see if I can track down Archard's Agents"
