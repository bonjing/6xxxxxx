,corndog472,2011-10-08T00:07Z,"I have downloaded the torrent and i mount the ISO with Daemon Tools. It opens into autorun fine, but when i click on Install Half-Life it wont run. I have tried both isos and went into the iso to click setup. Again, same thing. I may be doing something wrong?"
,halvist666,2011-10-09T13:38Z,"maybe you computer is infected by viruses? check computer, reinstall OS and try again. all ISO\installers included in this torrnts work fine! or... use another CD\DVD emulator such as Alcohol 120% or update your emulator to latest version. Good luck!"
