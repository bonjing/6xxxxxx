6 6 "Journey to the Tower of Omens" Kazuo Nogami, Sean Song Tab Murphy August 26, 2011 (2011-08-26) 

While Lion-O practices with the Sword of Omens, wee see Mumm-Ra forcing Jaga to give away the pathway to 
the Tower of Omens; which has the Book of Omens hidden and locked within. Mumm-Ra is also having some help 
with evil clones of the Thundercats. Only Tiagra and Lion-O's clones are seen though. On the other hand, in Jungle, 
Snarf, while trying to break fill his appetite causes a ruckus a hidden temple comes into the view of the cats. 
They go into the temple and after a series of deadly puzzles, they reach the other end of the hill with more 
jungle in view. The puzzles were each solved by one of the cat; depicting that each of them is important. 
Later, when Lion-O finally utilizes the Eye of Thundera and notices a button, Tiagra uses his whip-lash to press it. 
While they reach Tower of Omens, Mumm-Ra is also successful in reaching to the place; all thanks to Jaga. 
Panthro comments at the foot of Tower that reaching the Tower needed only the right set of friends. 
A fierce battle takes place in the tower and Jaga sacrifices himself to save Lion-O and the others. 
Soon; when they are able to gain the Book of Omens; Lion-O finds that it is actually blank.
