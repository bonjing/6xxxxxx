Pamalanga is a world beat band of mexican musicians.
It started in San Luis PotosÃ­, Mexico in 2004. 
Since then they have been professionally growing. 
Its members are Judd (violin, electric guitar), Davo (drums), 
Lechuga (trumpet), Huber (voice), Marko (bass) and AgustÃ­n (percussion).


As a part of a multicultural world, Pamalanga pays homage to diversity 
and doesn't limit their proposal to any one musical gender. 
It is a hybrid with no frontiers where funk, rÃ¤i, rock, international folklore, 
jungle, rock steady and afrolatin rhythms as songo and reggae coincide in a musical fusion.


Aware of today's world complexity and of the need to do something in favor of a better and more just society,
Pamalanga wants to contribute to the cause through its music and lyrics that 
are inspired in a culture of peace and unity.


Throughout these years, they have made appearances in different forums and festivals in Mexico, 
alternating with groups like Santa Sabina, Los Cafres and Los Caligaris from Argentina, 
No Jazz from France, Los de Abajo, Palomazo Informativo, SalÃ³n Victoria, 
Maldita Vecindad y los Hijos del Quinto Patio and La CastaÃ±eda, among others.


Their first recorded material was produced by Eulalio Cervantes â€œSaxâ€, from Maldita Vecindad.
