The missing songs from the Bioshock 2 licensed soundtrack.  They vary in quality, but I did my best.  It doesn\\\'t include songs that were on the first Bioshock soundtrack that were repeated on this one and it is also missing one song that only showed up on the multiplayer part of the game (I only did the single player part).

Enjoy and seed!!!
