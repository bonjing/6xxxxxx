,amputate,2011-08-27T07:51Z,"This is that crappy version that is going around on the net.
It doesn't work for half of the people who download it, and the other half that can play encounter numerous  errors and bugs, not to mention that they can't save the game...

do not waste your time downloading this..."

Thanks."
,rocco_sifredi,2011-08-27T10:31Z,"I have the 1.04 version (it says 1.0339) in the down right corner of the game.The kit has almost 4 GB and it's pre cracked. And it works well and I can save. I reached the police station quest without any bugs or crashes. I run the game at 1680x1050. I have a E8400 Intel CPU , 3GB RAM, Windows Xp 64x and a Palit 8800 GTS 512MB card.
However this beeing a 1.4 version...it shows 5 locks icons when the game is loading.They look open , one by one, once you advance in the game, meaning there is a limited levels playable.
If that is the 1.6 version, who knows, maybe you can play more. I doubt it has bugs and you can't save, because it is presumed that a 1.6 version to be better then the last one so who is saying the other way , either is a moron or a company ""best man"";)"

,hootieman,2011-08-27T16:26Z,"Your post wasn't erased, TPB comment system is one of the most bugged things out there. 99.9% of the time it won't even show you comments after you post one. Like for instance this post, show 10 comments but I only see 3, TPB is fail."
