,mantikor777,2011-09-03T00:25Z,The reason is the idiocy of the uploaders.  Simple explanation.
,jctcom,2011-12-15T04:46Z,I have asked before why the RAR's but never received an answer.  So I skip these whenever possible and usually find another one that is not rar'd.  I don't want to support seeding these rar'd versions. It just doubles the amount of data on my hard drive if I am going to continue seeding and extract them to watch.  There is no need from them I guess that is why they have never given me an answer.
