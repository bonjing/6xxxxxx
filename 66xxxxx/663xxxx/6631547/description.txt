Storyline:
In the unsanctioned, underground, and unhinged world of extreme Ping-Pong, the competition is brutal and the stakes are deadly.
Down-and-out former professional Ping-Pong phenom Randy Daytona is sucked into this maelstrom when FBI Agent Rodriguez recruits him for a secret mission.
Randy is determined to bounce back and recapture his former glory, and to smoke out his father's killer - one of the FBI's Most Wanted, arch-fiend Feng.
But, after two decades out of the game, Randy can't turn his life around and avenge his father's murder without a team of his own.
He calls upon the spiritual guidance of blind Ping-Pong sage and restaurateur Wong, and the training expertise of Master Wong's wildly sexy niece Maggie,
both of whom also have a dark history with Feng.
All roads lead to Feng's mysterious jungle compound and the most unique Ping-Pong tournaments ever staged...
