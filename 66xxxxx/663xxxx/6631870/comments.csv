,leggman7,2011-09-05T06:45Z,"This had issues with either framerate, choppy or dropped audio, or lacking video, depending on whether I played it with VLC, Mplayer, or quicktime. I couldn't get through the movie because of it."
,xEpicJ,2011-09-12T00:39Z,"The resolution says 1280 x 544!! which is not high-res and also very widescreen, why would you shrink the vertical pixels by so much?!! anyone comments from playing on larger HDTV? Thanks"
,zalchol,2011-09-14T16:06Z,720p is not BR.
,phattsao,2011-09-14T19:35Z,"To the guy asking why it's 1280x544:

Because it's letterboxed.  If you were playing a 720p copy on your TV, it would be 1280x720, but the black bars on the top and bottom of the picture count towards that.  When people rip letterboxed movies, they crop out the black bars to save on file size.  So, in essence, you are still seeing the exact same resolution on the image, just without black bars included.

So, one could argue that any 1080p BD that is letterboxed is NOT true 1080p, but we'd laugh at you if you did.  "
,dta151,2011-10-09T05:42Z,Is there a way to burn mp4 file like this to a dvd without quality loss like in convertxtodvd.With MKV files I know how to use tsmuxer and make a AVCHD or Blu Ray disk but it wont work with mp4 files.
