    Achtung! Explosions, vintage bikes, cornfields and time    
    travel make for a mind-boggling start to the second       
    batch of Doctor Who adventures.                          
                                                              
    Confidential is back on set with Matt Smith and Karen      
    Gillan in 1930s Berlin. We hang out backstage with the    
    cast and crew and bring you all the behind-the-scenes    
    action as the series gets back into full swing.           
                                                               
    We also bring you Script to Screen - the making of a      
    mini Doctor episode written by schoolchildren and        
    brought to life by Matt Smith and the Doctor Who team.    
                                                               
    Featuring interviews with Matt Smith, Karen Gillan,       
    Arthur Darvill and Steven Moffat.
