Perfect gaps between tracks using pre-gaps (the negative countdown seen on CDs) and it's just awesome.  Plus it's easier in some non-torrent downloading formats to just have one big file.  I like it.  Plus with FLAC you would have to re-label anyway, but this program at least gives you tags in the file names, even if you end up needing to add media info if you convert to Apple Lossless like I do"
