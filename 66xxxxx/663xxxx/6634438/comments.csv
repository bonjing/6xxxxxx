After a quick scroll through it looks as if all the content is there and I can confirm that the picture quality per page gets vastly better around 475 out of 809 pages. But no matter what it is always clear enough to read the page. The text is able to be copied and there are bookmarks which jump to the correct sections. Overall I would give this a 4-4.5/5 due to the photo quality in the first half of the PDF but by no means does it ruin the effectiveness. A thousand thank yous to the guy/gal who did this because you just saved me tons of money from an overpriced book."
