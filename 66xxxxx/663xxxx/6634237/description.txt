A no-nonsense, comprehensive encyclopedia that will be of use to students researching health and food-science topics. The set examines a variety of subjects such as "Antioxidants," "Appetite," "Fats," "Malnutrition," "Soy," and "Organic Foods." The food pyramid is clearly explained and food labels are deciphered line by line. Related topics include diseases that are associated with nutrition, such as osteoporosis and rickets, and health organizations. A global perspective is maintained throughout the work, with articles provided on the diets of geographic and ethnic groups worldwide. The authoritative entries are concise, if a little dry. Nutrition terminology is defined in the margins and included in the glossary. Average-quality, black-and-white photographs lend only slight visual appeal, but generally add information. Frequent graphs, tables, and sidebars supplement the text with more specific or esoteric material. The index has occasional lapses. The more appealing Encyclopedia of Foods (Academic, 2001) takes a less-clinical approach to its topic; it has color photos and contains practical advice on meal planning and preparation. Nutrition's straightforward coverage offers more information on disease and government oversight.â€“Joyce Adams Burner, Hillcrest Library, Prairie Village, KS
