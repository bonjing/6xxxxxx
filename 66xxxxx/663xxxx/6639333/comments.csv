Planes may have crashed and have been hijacked. Alquaeeda (or whatever the drink ) may have been involved, but no way those 3 buildings descend like that unless you have a controlled explosion on at least every 4 floors minimum.

They've had 10 years to come up with a reply and all the money in the world ( which they stole using this lie ). But you can not defie physics.

All evidence on site (filmed 9/01) shows clear  cutting of the central supports. They shipped everything to China, now they say they have warehouses - bollocks!"
,sonofdog,2011-08-31T22:29Z,"Bush II is as dumb as a bag of hammers or a cunt like his mates Cheney and Rumsfeld. I refer them both to the war crimes commission as these two criminals who suggested the very event of 9/11 as ""another Pearl Harbour "" required for their adjustment to the US constitution back in the 1990's, to enable a fascist dicatatorship of the USA by them.

They are definately War Criminals to be arrested and charged. They are criminals against Humanity and must be held to account!

This I demand as the son of the DOG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
