,Mr_Gamer,2011-08-31T13:07Z,"It's worth mentioning that this episode is _Original/UK_ Top Gear (getting a bit crowded - AU, US, KR) and also that this episode is from season 14. It is a special though. But for those who want the High Definition variant, search for ""Top.Gear.S14E06.720p.x264-BiA.mkv"" - It's huge though, 2.3GB, but it's WORTH it!"
