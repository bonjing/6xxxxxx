,jesuz999,2011-08-28T00:37Z,"Yeah, just keep your u|Torrent runnin' after you have 100% downloaded, and make sure the torrent is active for upload, If not you can force the upload with a Right Click Menu on the torrent. (Not the torrent file, but running one inside your Torrent program)"
,kik6666,2011-08-28T00:40Z,what the hell is this??? is this the movie or comic that comes with the augmented edition??? 
,marco699,2011-08-28T01:43Z,"Thanks jesuz999.

The Augmented Edition -- available for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Windows PC editions of the game -- will include a forty-page artbook, a ""motion graphic novel,"" and a bonus DVD that includes a making-of video, trailers, part of the game's soundtrack, and an animated storyboard of one of the game's trailers. 

This is the forty-page artbook, I have the making of DVD if anyone wants that posted?"
,WildGaren,2011-08-28T02:47Z,"@marco699:
Checked the goodies, it's a good upload, love the artworks. Thanks!

I'd like the making-of too, if you could :)

Cheers."

Enjoy."
,Black_Beard,2011-08-28T06:52Z,"Looks real to me, sad that its only 40 pages long though :(  it looks more like a game guide then an art book to me.

Thanks for the upload though, you helped me decide between buying the Augmented or the Standard edition of the game."
