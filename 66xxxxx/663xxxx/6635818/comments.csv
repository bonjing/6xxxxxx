I had the same problem starting up but I found out why. I had iz3d running in the backround, and it was trying to inject itself into the game to make it 3D, I couldn't find the process name in task manager so I uninstalled it. You guys probably don't have iz3d yourself but if you can think of any program that injects itself into the game, or messes with graphics settings or if you can think of any program having compatibility issues then I would suggest turning it off. Thats how I fixed mine. hope that helps you too."
