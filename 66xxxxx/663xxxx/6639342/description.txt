IMDb Info

Johnny Worricker (Bill Nighy) is a long-serving MI5 officer. His boss and best friend
Benedict Baron (Michael Gambon) dies suddenly, leaving behind him an inexplicable file,
threatening the stability of the organization. Meanwhile, a seemingly chance encounter
with Johnny's striking next-door neighbor and political activist Nancy Pierpan (Rachel
Weisz) seems too good to be true. Johnny is forced to walk out of his job, and then out
of his identity to find out the truth. Set in London and Cambridge, PAGE EIGHT is a
contemporary spy film for the BBC, which addresses intelligence issues and moral dilemmas
peculiar to the new century.
