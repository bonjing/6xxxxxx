,wafflerevolution,2011-08-29T20:52Z,"please for the love of god stop uploading rar files... please just do an avi like a normal person!

also, why upload the same show twice and make them BOTH rar files?"
,wafflerevolution,2011-08-30T01:48Z,"the only real thing that bothers me is that I don't want to have to piece the show together myself... 

and yes, I do suck... regularly. I enjoy sucking."
,superamrx,2011-08-30T02:38Z,"Yeah, but usually you delete the rar files after you extract them because you don't want them littering your files which makes seeding much more of an inconvenience."
,wafflerevolution,2011-08-30T05:33Z,"yea man, I'm not some teen with too much free time here... I'd seed any show I DL if it was a SINGLE .avi file. I support people who add stuff I like just as I'd expect support for stuff I upload... but I'm not supporting a bunch of individual rar files or even MKV files... I play shows on my 360 and PS3... as do my kids. yes, I'm that old. and yes, I like VB. however, what we are doing on this site is not legal... so I have a bit of a right to pick and choose what I do and do not DL. this ""packaged files"" thing is stupid. yes, I CAN unzip them. yes... and yes I COULD seed... will I? no. not as long as I'm not happy with the product.

it takes literally the same amount of time to fully DL an avi file... as a rar file, the size difference is so minimal it's ridiculous. plus it's more susceptible to viruses. 

but just because I'm a better person than Z3N, I'll let you all know the A/V is 9/10. Thanks for the inconvenient convenience sceneline."
,wafflerevolution,2011-08-31T17:25Z,"I haven't had a gaming quality computer in more than 12 years. I can't afford to keep up with that stuff... besides, PC gaming isn't pleasant for people who prefer controllers and who don't have HDTVs... that's right, not everyone has HDTVs... *gasp* I don't have a computer that's even less than 6 years old. and I have to buy laptop components for my 2 kids damn near every year just to keep them school capable... I WANT a gaming PC, trust me... but I still don't have an HDTV and I still wouldn't stop console gaming... not until they go all-digital. that's when I'll stop... I've been console gaming since games were on cassette tapes and cartridges... more than 30 years ago... I am a better person than you. I see no reason to pick fights on the internet since win or lose, you're retarded either way. 

the episode was good, not great, I liked the Dethklok poster on the wall lol though neither my wife nor son liked the episode at all... which was sad... I liked the ""behind the music"" spoof... honestly though, that song was kinda bad."
,wafflerevolution,2011-08-31T17:46Z,"I now have an avi version available for those still wanting one.

,wafflerevolution,2011-09-02T00:03Z,"okay, McR0z3n you're an awesome PC god and I envy you. honestly, I wish I had the money for an up-to-date gaming PC... unfortunately my son is more likely to get one before me.

I can use my (wired) 360 controller with my PC... and I do sometimes but I don't have the adapter to use it with a TV and frankly, with 3 xbox 360's in one house and also a PS3, it's much easier to use them from a centralized PC... 1 location going to 4 is much easier."
,illizit,2011-09-29T03:32Z,"not so much an inconvenience...
just a wste of cpu cycles, completed retarded to compress a file already compressed"
