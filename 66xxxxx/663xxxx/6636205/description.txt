Proper Notes.....: Yet another amazing release from CRiMSON! Their release features very distinct combing artifacts 
                   throughout, which is quite odd since Nat Geo is a 720p channel. They overcropped the bottom by about 4 
                   pixels. Also, they unnecessarily ivtc'd their release causing a loss of every 5th frame from the 
                   original source.
                   CRiMSON, why don't you stick to channels and shows that no one else cares about so you can avoid 
                   embarrassment?
