Astonishing."

Thank you for your reply
Islam is not a pervert
Do not find it anything out of logic or reason
Is a harmonic of the mind does not contradict the mind
If our understanding of his teachings is impossible to leave
Deviation found in some Muslim
Islam does not order them, but fighting against
Look for Islam, you will see the wonder"

Thank you very much. for your reply

I am sorry for the delay in reply I was busy


You come texts from the Koran interpreted your opinion  At your own sweet  will 

If you know Arabic 
You are well aware that it is not the correct meaning of the texts

But if you do not know Arabic

You must read the interpretation of the Koran
What you said does not exist in the interpretation

I do not know from where did you get this  interpretation

If you want a true understanding of your wedding hello

You are an atheist
The universe did not come by chance or created from himself

I give you an example, if someone gave you the service you are by yourself thank him

Look for yourself at Creator of the universe
Make you master of yourself
Then thank him  This is the religion
