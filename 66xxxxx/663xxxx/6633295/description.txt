If you go to the Grand Canyon, you can watch this same video in IMAX theaters.  Can't go to the Grand Canyon? Don't want to spend the $15 for the video?  Look no further.  It was supposed to be exclusive, but Amazon seems to already have taken that exclusivity away, I want to make it even more available.

=========== IMDB Movie Description ==============
The human history of the Grand Canyon is explored in this documentary, focusing on the earliest native civilizations about which little is known, through the coming of the Europeans, the scientific expedition of John Wesley Powell which mapped the canyon and boated the Colorado River rapids, into modern times. Both aerial and river-level photography is used to propel the viewer into the experience of the canyon.
