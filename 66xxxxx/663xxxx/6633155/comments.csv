,bluesky88,2011-09-01T18:20Z,episode six?
,tiramisubob,2011-09-02T19:23Z,"though i am appreciative that you actually take the effort to upload these shows for us, i must second the above poster's question...where is episode six?  according to imdb it should have aired this week...
lots of foolish children think just because you upload something that you're untouchable but as i run a blog and go to several media blogs with actual up-to-date content, this whole ""wait a week and you may or may not get it"" shit is old.  so, are you going to continue to upload or not?  the choice is rather simple.
and on that note, can i just say that i HATE thepiratebay with a passion?  if it weren't for chelsea lately i'd have no need to come here at all!
i'm so sick of those ""streamate"" pop-up ads with fucking fat ass whales and ugly snaggle-tooth inbred bitches giving web shows.  why look at porn when you can just laugh your ass off at the ugliest ""humans"" to grace the internet?"
,hiddendanger,2011-09-02T20:21Z,episode six? common!
