,Savestar,2011-08-26T19:50Z,"Thanks a lot extremezone! - It still puzzles me why guys like you do us guys such a huge favour! I can only hope its all worth to you! You deserve it! 
Yes we have waited a long, long time for this, but we knew it was worth it, to wait for a good release from guys like you! 

All the cams and TS suck big time! I do not get it, why anyone would ruin any good movie with that! Maybe because they have no patience .I bet my money on that! 

But like they say : ""All good things comes, to those who wait!"" -- Trust me you can apply that for PB! :)"

But that depends on your kit. The ""talking"" dialogue requires boost on the sound but then comes the ""effects"" that kills your speakers.

Perhaps on a full 5.1 mediaplayer system it might be better but a plain 2-channel pc it is very.. annoying. But worth trying to view."

Listen kid I don't know what the fuck your problem is, you aren't cool if you swear, you'll find that out when you grow up, until then stop bitching around on every torrent you see. Pubic hair doesn't mean you are a man, try working on your vocabulary if you want people to listen to you. Sorry everyone but I couldn't ignore this kid anymore, he is worse than herpes."

VLC media player man........every time i download a torrent from TPB there is always a comment from somebody saying they cant play something or other.
I have never ever had a problem with VLC, but i have the old one. I deliberately didn't update it incase of format changes and issues and what not.
and @bananamolester you just joined the AIDS circus you gay clown.
your lame attempt and being a cave troll backfired when you swore at the kid then said how uncool it is to swear.
think you need to check your pubes buddy cos you looked like more of a kid"

I have a DivX certified DVD Player, but it has problems playing DivX files over 1GB.  Try to reconvert videos with DivX Author (set custom size to 1GB) or DivX Converter (Home Theater Profile) to make file smaller.

Windows Media Player Problem:
You probably need AC3 codec if you have no audio with Windows Media Player, but I agree with the others to just use VLC Player."

For some reason though, when I have burned this only the first couple of seconds play then the movie stops.  It plays fine on my laptop and if I put the disc in my CD drive that also plays so what could be causing the problem??  It has only ever happened once in the past when I couldn't get The Next Three Days to work either but I just downloaded a copy of Source Code and the same thing has happened??!?!  What am I doing wrong?

Use Nero to create VCD or DVD, it will create the necessary system files and do the conversion for you. You may also be able to download those files and make your own; I'd rather let a program does it automatically. VCD is essentially AVI and DVD is VOB."

In fact you assholes actually seem to expect us to!! Well that is whats wrong with the US, all you little countries keep getting major help and assistance from us and you NEVER repay us!! Besides, why have I met so many Greek imigrants in the US?? They moved here for a better life and they got one!! America is far from perfect but at least you don't see us moving to your shithole of a country and living there!! It does'nt take a genious to figure this out. And you have the nerve to call us evil. You know nothing about us except for what you watch on TV!! If you believe what you see on TV then you are a bigger dumbass than I thought you were. I hope the Muslims invade your shitty country, kill you all and then burn it to the ground. Without the help of America and other countries you fucksticks would be defenseless to fight off such an attack!!! I do not say this to offend most of the Greek people, only to ignorant dickheads like ""repopoman"". Do the world a favor and kill yourself or at least stop trolling and spamming TPB with your uneducated and hateful comments!! Yeah the US government sucks, but don't all governments??

For the 1st time ever in my downloading history the ISP from Comcast has been tracked, the odds of you being tracked are slim but very possible and plausible. Sent to internet via email. Fine and suspension of internet comes into play. Also take into account never use Qwest internet, they report to FBI right away. Just a heads up, I'm sure I'll receive negative bitching feedback but to be honest extremezone I've never had a problem with any of your torrents being tracked prior. This is a heavy wake up! Is there a way to block ISP's being traced? If so let me know, because I've tried a IP blocker and it ended up being a false torrent share file. "

First of all, I've never received one, so I think these posts must be bullshit.  Secondly, if a production company had the wherewithal to figure out your email address, and your IP address, wouldn't they just send the feds to pick your ass up?  Am I wrong in thinking these posts are just some minimum wage shitheel working for the makers of these films?"

He said that if you saw the story as a different from the original northern mythology it was a good film. And abou his language: english is probably not his native language. Try to speak to him in his native language and hate again after that -.- since I'm German i probably didn't learn as much as him about the mythology but still as I live in the north of Germany the norse mythology belongs to that area and I also was dissapointed by the lack of connection to its origin. I also read the comicbooks and the movie was 70% lame/ thor without power and just 30% action.
