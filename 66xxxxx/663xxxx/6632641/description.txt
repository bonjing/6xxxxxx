Lenny Kravitz seems to be one of these artists that never grow old. Heâ€™s been making a splash in the music world since 1989, with his debut album â€˜Let Love Ruleâ€™, but his music and his appearance are always fresh, creative and modern. It takes something special to last in the music industry for as long as he has and Kravitz, indeed, is a special, talented artist.

He often plays all the instruments while recording â€“ this is unbelievable in itself, but when you think that Kravitz has such a distinctive style that incorporates such diverse elements of music such as soul, reggae, psychedelia and hard rock, it makes this feat much more impressive and is just one example of many of his creativity and talent that oozes out of every release.

He won the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance from 1999 to 2002, breaking the record in the process for most wins in that category. Heâ€™s also been nominated, and won, many other awards â€“ namely the BRIT Awards and MTV Music Video Awards. But things havenâ€™t always been so rosy for the man formerly known as Romeo Blue.

Like every musician/artist/band out there, heâ€™s faced adversity and hardship but instead of giving up and wallowing in the recesses with the thousands of others who nearly made it but failed and are forgotten, he pulled through it and came out a stronger, more resolute person. This shows a firmer, stony character rather than the one who comes across in his songs, who interacts with the listener and makes them feel good about themselves. Itâ€™s almost a juxtaposition to the fun, happy, friendly music he comes up with but itâ€™s intriguing as well. It adds an unknown depth to his character and makes you like the guy even more. You know heâ€™s had to work hard, harder than most, to get where he is today.
