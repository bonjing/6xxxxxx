S04E03 Seeking Siegfried.

Siegfried Newman, 49, when last seen at Katikati, 35km north of Tauranga, on February 25, 2008. Mr Newman's wife had died a few months earlier and there were suggestions he may have been suicidal, but his two German sisters said he loved his boys too much to take his own life. Extensive searches failed to find him. 

Sergeant Craig Madden, head of the Tauranga police search and rescue team, said a scenario analysis had been done over several months.
