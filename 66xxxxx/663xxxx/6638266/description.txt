BBC Radio 2 - The Likely Lads. 
Series 01 & 02.
By Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais.

This is a radio adaptation of sixteen of the twenty scripts of the 1960s television comedy series of the same name. [S02 E08 is audio from the TV broadcast]

The misadventures of two young lads growing up on Tyneside in the 1960s, for whom life revolves around beer, sex and football. Despite the setting, you won't hear any Geordie accents - presumably they were deemed too exotic at the time. James Bolam's mild Mackem accent is discernible, but the rest are all-encompassing BBC 'northern working-clarse'.

Terry - James Bolam
Bob - Rodney Bewes

32 kbps. Sound quality not so canny, but listenable. These files have been floating around t'interweb for some years and I have no idea who first upped them, but thanks anyway.
