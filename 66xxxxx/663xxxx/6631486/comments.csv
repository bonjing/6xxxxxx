,rarerls,2011-08-27T17:09Z,"bigt6969, *SPOILERS AHEAD BE CAREFUL EVERYONE* No fight in this episode. Once again they pulled the ""Next Time"" bullshit. I have a feeling it will be ""Next Time"" until the end of the season. *SPOILERS END HERE*"
,bigt6969,2011-08-27T21:42Z,I thought as much pretty much like sammi and jwowws fight that kept saying next time then next time and it eventually came on like 5 episodes later lol. I thought ron slammed mike because i seen it on the facebook site yesterday and you could hear a heart machine flat lining lol
,looom,2011-08-27T23:24Z,"thanks,i hope that you can upload episode 5"
