,hermatsch,2011-09-26T19:25Z,"this is a copy with CINAVIA protection, which means that on many blu-ray players, also on PS3, it will not play correctly, i.e. the sound will stop after about 20 minutes and a nice message pop up to get info at www.cinavia.com......."

,Sontiago,2011-10-13T03:27Z,The 3-d doesn't work but it does play in 2d ok...Although maybe the 3d doesn't work because I compressed it to a bd25 instead of a bd50?
,MajiNPic1,2011-11-11T10:58Z,"@Sontiago
Because there's no such software that can re-encode 3D Blu-ray at the moment. If you compress it with BD Rebuilder/DVD Fab/etc.... it will become a 2D Blu-ray with AVC video."
