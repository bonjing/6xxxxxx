DiVERGE have released a new documentary from Nat Geo, â€œInside 9-11 The War Continuesâ€ .

Inside 9/11: The War Continues tells the evolving story of radical Islamâ€™s war against the West. Osama bin Laden has finally been brought to justice, but Al Qaeda is still going strong. For bin Laden, 9/11 was just the beginning â€” the attack was designed to spark a revolution and create a whole new generation of men willing to wage jihad against America. But ten years later, these same men have eclipsed bin Laden on the global stage. And their call to jihad has gone viral with terror groups using the Internet to recruit and radicalize future attackers in the name of Allah.
