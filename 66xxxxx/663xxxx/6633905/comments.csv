[V],.Dude.,2011-08-27T19:30Z,Read the description and then comment!
[V],.Dude.,2011-08-27T19:33Z,"If i can share a file or something,y cant i just add my name in the torrent file??

[T],swebarb,2011-08-27T19:35Z,"cause hes a fucking moron, i wouldnt trust download this kind of things from a non trusted member.. "
,rhinowar,2011-08-27T20:46Z,"Wow, what a bitch.   Way to shit on someone who has contributed almost as much as you.  No viruses in their torrents.   Someone needs a skull fucking."
,shauwy,2011-08-27T20:47Z,for 1 time we are a great game don't use a trainer you can just broken your game and after no pleasure ;)
,rhinowar,2011-08-27T21:00Z,Yeag but at one time you were not trusted either.
,NeoRinTinTin,2011-08-27T21:11Z,"I can confirm this works.

Blindly denouncing torrents without personally confirming it yourself and without evidence other than ""no skull""  isn't really helping anyone. 

Same goes with people who denounce the use of trainers. We know what we're getting ourselves into. Back off."
,Kronical4,2011-08-27T21:34Z,"It makes me laugh when people all get booty hurt and cry when ever it's in there eyes as if ""someone is taken credit for there work"". Mother Fuckers how stupid can you be?!?! Those ""people"" that you feel like are not getting there ""credit"" for the hard the work put in...did they make this game??? Did they spend years to make this game? No i think those ""people"" also stole someones else work and put there names on it. Were all pirates, that is why we are on this site."
,Xenn99,2011-08-27T22:11Z,"thanks for the upload, still needed one for the new version :)"

,Shaymau5,2011-08-28T02:35Z,It works but it will crash a lot. Crashed about 8-9 times on my steam version.
,mrpaper,2011-08-28T15:16Z,"this works, scanned with three different AV programs and nothing."
,dodge112,2011-08-29T18:47Z,"Thanks DuDe works nicely, dont listen to these noobs you've done great."

,10hellfire01,2011-08-30T21:41Z,Works as it should. Just Deus EX HR is a real bitch with trainers since they all crash the game.
,Atacknun,2011-08-31T23:49Z,"It works for the most part. Some of the functions don't seem to work but oh well. This is the closest I've gotten to a working trainer.
And yeah, it causes crashes."
,Atacknun,2011-08-31T23:49Z,And I was using the SHiTROW version.
