Story
-----

Lasse has travelled the world for years. His heart knows no home except one that a prophecy from his childhood revealed to him: Valkaama, a mysterious place in northern Finland. Lasse always longed to settle there one day, along with Ari, a good friend bound to a wheelchair.

Recently Lasse has been living with Runa, a privileged girl who has looked upon Lasse only as a friend. But as he suddenly leaves on his final journey, she becomes overwhelmed by her deep-set emotions.

Magnus is a prisoner of his own miserable world in which he aides the hopeless in suicidal quests. Eventually one of his victims offers a chance to change his life for good and soon he finds himself venturing northwards. Together with Lasse and the dark secret of his past.

In the meantime Runa tries to solve the puzzle of Lasse's past and in an instant she also finds herself heading north. Hence the prophecy is finally fulfilled, but in a way none of the three could ever have predicted. A few fateful hours in the Finnish wilderness change the lives of three forever.
