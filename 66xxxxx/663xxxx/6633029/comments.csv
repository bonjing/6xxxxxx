[T],shemyaza,2011-08-31T01:37Z,"Just watched this again. What would happen if the ABs went a season without Carter and McCaw? WE now have du Preez and Brussow back game on...

BOKKE!!!"
,madu647,2011-08-31T05:29Z,"with all due respect to du preez in  last 2 games he was awful on current form i think hougaard is the man for the job his passing looks lot sharper and better and he is quick around the fringes and his work rate is much higher brussow certainly showing his worth, go bokke!!!  keep seeding it mate                                               "
[T],shemyaza,2011-09-02T00:23Z,"Yup, Hougaard is good but Generaal du Preez is in a class of his own. Put those two down to lack of recent game time. Come 9/11 we will see. BOKKE!!!"
