You don't need any cracks or serial numbers. So Far, I haven't experienced any bugs or issues."

Download 7zip, just look it up on google and download.
Open file with 7zip.
Once opened, Double-click ""Hidden_Springs_1,5.Sims3Pack""
Install. If it tells you to update The Sims 3, go to the update tab, click refresh, and a download will come up. Install update(s) and the Pack.

There ya go!"

The internet language is slang like BTW,WTF,OMG etc. "
