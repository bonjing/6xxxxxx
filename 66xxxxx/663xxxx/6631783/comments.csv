,xskewzmi,2011-08-27T03:18Z,"@mantikor777 - If you really want to see the screenshot, just drag/drop link into a new browser tab or window"

,shomanadeh,2011-08-27T14:18Z,"Guys, hush now, you are big boys, don't fight over imagefuck, the only way you can see these images outside USA is to make an account on their site and login to it.
so don't go swearing and blaming each other, unless you are a bunch of animals who don't understand that everything has a reason and every problem is solvable."

,aafz02,2011-08-27T18:52Z,"@ darklight00

Er, maybe this?      Leechers:  7777

Half the online planet is sucking this film down dsl pipelines so it's gonna be slow for a while."
,darklight00,2011-08-27T19:13Z,is everyone else getting slow download speed or is it just me??
,darklight00,2011-08-27T19:28Z,@ aafz02 thanks for explaining things. That was driving me crazy..
,LoneRngr,2011-08-27T19:45Z,those who are unable to see the screenshots. open up this page with https rather than http. then open the given links. they will work for sure. :-)
,zomaster,2011-08-27T21:31Z,"screenshots work just open in another tab. download takes way too long for this, god damn leechers. been trying to download since yesterday night but at 50 now so hopefully ill be done tonight or in the morning."
,zomaster,2011-08-27T22:24Z,@darklight00  the leechers are more than the seeds. thats why its slower. 
,murat87,2011-08-27T22:32Z,seriously trying to download this file for 16 hours and it isnt even %50 damn 
,zomaster,2011-08-28T00:00Z,@murat87 at 86 now. it takes way too long for this to be done.

,theone25,2011-08-28T09:15Z,"Screens don't work, no matter how you open them!"
,Munchk1npuncher,2011-08-29T04:52Z,Thanks!
,Saki33,2011-08-29T23:06Z,"Thanks heaps, mate!

I will weigh in on the screenshot issue even though it has already been beaten into the ground. I am in the USA using Firefox and tried every one of the suggested ways to see them. Nothing worked for me. I didn't want to see them anyway, just wanted to see if I could, as I trust the quality to be good and would rather see reports from those who have already downloaded it. Over a thousand seeders and still nada on quality.

To the guy saying goddamn leechers: so you just want everyone else to get off so you can have a faster download? what do you think you are if not a leecher? There are still many more leechers than seeders and I am getting a fast download. Maybe it's because of my high ratio sharing rate."
,osh2342,2011-08-30T06:19Z,"For those who can't see the screenshots, try using a proxy server such as,

freeproxyserver
or
hidemyass

and  paste the link there.Works for me."
