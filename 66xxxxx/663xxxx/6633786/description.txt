Times Square, 1980, Robin Johnson, Trini Alvarado, Tim Curry

The film is about two teenage runaways, Nicky Marotta (Robin Johnson) from a poor family and Pamela Pearl (Trini Alvarado) from a rich family, living in New York City. After escaping from a hospital (where they are being examined for mental illness), Nicky and Pamela link up with sympathetic disc jockey Johnny LaGuardia (Tim Curry). The two girls form an underground punk rock band, The Sleez Sisters, and become a hit with the city's disillusioned youth after broadcasting their volatile songs and speeches on LaGuardia's radio station. The climax of the film features all the fans of The Sleez Sisters congregating in the streets of New York's Times Square for a rooftop concert.
