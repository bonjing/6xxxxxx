Any chance of uploading every single one of them 'cos I have some earlier ones which have now gone missing and I don't know why.

I use a program from ""Advancescene"" to keep my roms organised and sometimes it appears to delete some that I have had for ages, for no apparent reason, and I don't know how to get them back."
,MonkeyManCoco,2011-08-30T09:11Z,"No I most likely will not release a complete XXXX pack. The XXXX roms are very unpopular. Most people don't care about them at all. If there was demand for them I would but I barely released this.

If you really want a complete set I'd suggest just downloading the old torrent from http://www.nintendo-ds-roms.com/nds-torrent.htm and this one. With those two XXXX torrents you'd have greater than 90% of the XXXX roms and could just fill in the odd missing one.

As for the advanscene app deleting some roms, the program doesn't delete anything. They do stop recognizing some old roms because propers are released, it'll stop recognizing the original releases because they were either imporperly dumped, trimmed or had an intro added to them. In most cases it's quite minor and really doesn't matter, if you actually care check my other torrents, I released a fix pack awhile back that gives you all the propered roms."
