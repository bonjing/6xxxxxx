From the Infowars web site ::

Journalist Nomi Prins talks with Alex about Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein hiring a major criminal-defense lawyer following the financial company betting against its own clients. Nomi's latest book is It Takes a Pillage: Behind the Bonuses, Bailouts, and Backroom Deals from Washington to Wall Street. She worked on Wall Street as a managing director at Goldman Sachs and ran the international analytics group at Bear Stearns in London. 

Alex also talks with former Reagan administration economist and columnist Paul Craig Roberts about the tenth anniversary of September 11, 2001, and the fact important questions surrounding the event were overlooked and ignored. 

Alex also covers the latest news, including developments in Libya.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
