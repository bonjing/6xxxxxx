This is supposed to be in English."
[T],aularon,2011-08-30T09:37Z,"@michaelrwatson:
It's in English indeed, but also with soft English subtitles (SRT/ASS) that people can enable.
WTF is _your_ problem with that? :)"

Concur. Something wrong with this. Crashed Media Player Classic, KMPlayer, BDPlayer Pro, etc, but plays OK in GOM Player - an old version at that.

CURE:
However, I've had this problem before, here's the fix that worked for me:
Change the file extension from mp4 to mpg and it'll play nicely with ALL media players. :))

(non 'power-users' may have to switch on 'Show all files and extensions' to perform this correctly - google that phrase for a quick how to.)

Great cap aularon - thanks x"
,anacondon,2011-09-22T04:05Z,Snagged a copy elsewhere but....does any one know what snappy jazz plays during opening & closing credits?  Can't find ID of artist/track(s) anywhere.  Kind of Lester Young-ish.  And i for one always appreciate subs as some of the brit dialect & accent can be tricky.
