,foodshelf,2011-08-27T06:27Z,bad audio thanks uploader for the effort though
,RexxEverything,2011-08-27T12:05Z,"Sorry, euthyfro, not all of us are nerds like you. Rar sucks."
[T],Magash,2011-08-27T13:40Z,The audio is messed up but it's not the fault of the uploader. On twitter Rob Corddry apologized for the echo so it must have aired that way
,Kosmonaut333,2011-08-27T21:08Z,"Quick fix:
Use VLC to watch the vid and set: Audio / Audio channels / Right"
,Yangwithnoyin,2011-08-28T17:33Z,"thanks kosmo.
