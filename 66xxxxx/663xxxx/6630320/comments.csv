Both is wrong IMHO.

There is still a long way to go for mankind.

Then there is another disgusting development happening where even today children get raped, sold, and forced into marriage, see the comments to this torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6561628/Politically_incorrect_guide_to_Islam_-_Robert_Spencer.pdf"

Donâ€™t judge a car by its driver!!! 

a car and the person who does not know how to drive or simply a ruthless driver,or drunk...
sits at the steering wheel and bangs up the car or hit somebody, who will you blame? 
The car or the driver?  

those you mention (raping ..)are thugs,criminals,and maybe even fundamentalists,.. 
just a few insane criminals..  

do not judge a religion by individuals actions or... 
should every body then blame Christianity for this individual acts?

Catholic Church in Australia embroiled in child sex scandal 
http://www.rickross.com/reference/clergy/clergy92.html
Associated Press/May 31, 2002 
By Emma Tinkler 
Sydney, Australia -- The Catholic Church in Australia was embroiled in a child sex scandal Friday after its 
most senior clergyman denied offering bribes to cover up abuse allegations against a priest. 

The bribery allegation came amid a crisis that has shaken the church in the United States, with revelations 
that priests across the country abused children sexually and that senior clergy tried to conceal incidents 
by moving known offenders to other parishes. 

Sydney Catholic Archbishop George Pell told a news conference Thursday that a television news program to be 
aired this weekend alleges that he tried to cover up sex abuse claims made against a priest in 1993 by 
offering the victim financial assistance in return for his silence. 

He denied the charge and said that he was misled by the producers of the program - the Nine Network's 
""60 Minutes"" - about the reason for the interview. 

""The allegations that I made such attempts or offers are not only unfounded but also implausible,"" he said. 

Pell said that he had agreed to be interviewed ""to discuss matters arising out of the American cardinals 
meeting in Rome,"" referring to an extraordinary gathering at the Vatican last month between Pope John Paul II 
and American cardinals and bishops to discuss matters including the U.S. child abuse allegations. 

According to the archbishop, a segment of the ""60 Minutes"" program to be broadcast Sunday reports that he was 
told in 1993 of abuse by a priest who pleaded guilty a year later to sexually assaulting 21 children - mostly 
altar boys and including his nephew - in one of Australia's most notorious pedophile scandals. The program 
says that the case was brought to Pell's attention by the nephew.... "

is all that are individuals acts? or you will just blame Christianity and all Christians?  
every body else does not blame Christianity  or Christians,because these ARE individual acts  
and does not represent Christianity or Christians and will be wrong to say that is Christianity...
or that is what all Christians do..


but of course ... you ... and only you.. big big brain ... blame the car!  
because for you.. all of it DOES NOT matter.....   
it does not have any thing to do with the authenticity,religion, or wright and wrong,   
it is the sad hatred personality you have,   
and i called you a racist before, and still do, why?!..  
because you also hate Jews, and you have (will not accuse you for being a member)""interest ""  for neo Nazi, 
and this combination my friend only exists for racists,neo Nazi, white pride,blood and honor,..... 

really .. it is ok,it is a free world, but the problem is that you are feeding on that hatred 
along with the hatred comments of others,and that is really sad.. 
you have been sick for 18 month,could not move around like you used to do, 
that can be hard and lonely,maybe you even lost your job,house,even friends,.. 
that can be depressing... 
is that is the reason for your bitterness and hatred of every thing? 
and the desperate need of feeling meaningful,worthy and important ? 
of course the Internet was your salvation, 
sad... that is depressing..  
you can start by dropping the stupid bike and try finding a fucken job and learn how to support your self, 
provide for your family/ start one!, be productive in your community , and stop making excuses for your 
self for being lazy and depressed, 

that will be your salvation,then you will be worthy, and you will have a meaningful life, 
sham on you...so get your head out of your butt and find a job. 
have a nice depressing life you sad fuck.
