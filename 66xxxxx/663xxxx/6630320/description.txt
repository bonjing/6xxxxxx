Criticism of the Western Civilization - Collection 11 (Hypersexual Society):


We have 37 titles in this upload that examines the transformation of modern western societies into hypersexual societies, or sex-saturated societies. Such a society is characterized by wide spread of: pornography, prostitution, infidelity, sex scandals, sexual liberation, rape and sexual abuse crimes.

This upload is closely related to the uploads about sexual abuse in Christian homes and churches. The transformation of modern western societies into hypersexual societies may explain the surge of sexual abuse in these societies; but it does not explain the prevalent sexual abuse in the church that has been going on for 2000 years.
It is hard to admit; but, the cause of this phenomena has to be rooted in the corrupted content of the Bible that portrays the Prophets of Israel and their immediate families as committing all kinds of sexual crimes and perversions: rape, incest, infidelity, adultery, .. etc.
