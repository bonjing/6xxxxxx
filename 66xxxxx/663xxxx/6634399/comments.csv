first of you need a 3DTV for this SBS rip all you have to do is play it on your 3DTV either via an HDMI cable through your pc or WDTV live for instance. do not be alarmed, the video will be 2 identical images side by side of eachother..but thats when your 3DTV comes in to play..you just navigate through your 3DTV and enable 3D make sure that you choose the mode called side by side and then your TV will make those identical images as one giving you the 3D effect. Enjoy :) "

,soadz87,2011-10-15T10:49Z,could you please make your rips audio compatible with LG 3D tv's insinuendo. picture is 11/10 but no audio :(
,ravester2k3,2011-11-21T01:02Z,im using a LG 3D TV and the audio is fine.
,howyeman,2012-01-27T21:41Z,"TO ALL LG 3D TV USERS!
DTS is NOT compatible if you plug your usb hdd directly on the TV, don't panic, just use this tool http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKV2AC3 and it will remove the DTS from the movie!
I takes around 20 min to get the work done, but it does an amazing one! Good luck LG 3DTV users!"
