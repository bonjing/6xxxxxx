I became obsessed With the Alien franchise around the time Alien 3 was released and 
taped a lot of promo material off the television in 1992.  I transferred all of my
VHS tapes to MPEG files this summer and am including the Alien 3 material in this
torrent.  I do not believe this footage has made it's way into any of the supplemental
material on the DVD and Blu-Ray releases of the film.
