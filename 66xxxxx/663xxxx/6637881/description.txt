CAMERATRACKER for After EffectsÂ® allows you to pull 3D motion tracks and matchmoves without having to leave AE. It analyses the source sequence and extracts the original camera's lens and motion parameters, allowing you to composite 2D or 3D elements correctly with reference to the camera used to film the shot.

You can now match camera moves within AdobeÂ® After EffectsÂ®' 2.5D environment, opening up new, robust options for the placement of composite elements, such as the creation of Fringe / Heroes style 'in scene' titles, insertion of animated design elements, match-moved virtual set extensions, motion-tracked projection mapping and much more...
