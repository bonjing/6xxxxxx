The first fully-illustrated book to not only help readers cook with mushrooms, but also to help them forage for fungi in the wild, The Edible Mushroom Book is part field guide, part cookbook. Beginning in the kitchen, readers learn how to prepare wild fungi for cooking, then how to make sixty mouthwatering recipes from Scrambled Chanterelles to Baked Mushroom Polenta. Moving on to the field, The Edible Mushroom Book tells you where and when to forage, provides an identification guide, and includes information on more than fifty-five edible mushrooms.
