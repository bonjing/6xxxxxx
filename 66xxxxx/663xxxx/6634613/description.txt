     Romance novelist Joan Wilder (Turner) lives for - and in - a fantasy
     world. But when her sister is kidnapped in Colombia and the only chance
     to save her is to bring a treasure map to her captors, reality quickly
     becomes stranger then fiction. Thrown into a jungle full of gunfire,
     mud slides and poisonous snakes, Joan's only hope lies with Jack Colton
     (Douglas), a rugged wanderer straight out of her novels. Together,
     they'll have to outwit the bandits and survive the jungle if they're to
     save her sister and find the secret of "El Corazon!"
