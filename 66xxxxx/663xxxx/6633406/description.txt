The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is the debut album by the English rock group Pink Floyd, and
the only one made under founding member Syd Barrett's leadership. The album contains
whimsical lyrics about space, scarecrows, gnomes, bicycles and fairy tales, along with
psychedelic instrumental songs. The album was initially released in 1967 by Columbia/EMI in
the United Kingdom and Tower/Capitol in the United States. Special limited editions were
issued to mark its thirtieth and fortieth anniversaries in 1997 and 2007, respectively

Background

Architecture students Roger Waters, Nick Mason and Richard Wright, and art student Syd
Barrett, had performed in various guises since 1962, and began touring as "The Pink Floyd"
in 1965. They turned professional on 1 February 1967, when they signed with EMI, with an
advance fee of Â£5,000.Their first single, a song about a kleptomaniac transvestite titled
"Arnold Layne", was released on 11 March to mild controversy - Radio London refused to air
it.About three weeks later the band were introduced to the mainstream media.[nb 1] EMI's
press released claimed that the band were "musical spokesmen for a new movement which
involves experimentation in all the arts", but EMI attempted to put some distance between
them and the underground scene from which the band originated by stating that "the Pink
Floyd does not know what people mean by psychedelic pop and are not trying to create
hallucinatory effects on their audiences".The band returned to Sound Techniques Studio to
record their next single, "See Emily Play", on 18 May.The single was released almost a
month later, on 16 June, and reached number five in the charts
