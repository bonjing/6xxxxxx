The day before voting the Copyright Amendment Act into law, Melissa Lee boasted on twitter about her illegally pirated K Pop mixtape.

Now on the day the Copyright Amendment Act comes into force, Socialist Aotearoa, is going to Melissa Lee\\\'s electorate office with real copies of Melissa Lee\\\'s K Pop Mixtape Vol.2.
