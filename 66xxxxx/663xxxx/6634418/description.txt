ITV1Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s successful series The Lakes is back for a brand new run in 2011.
In this 12 part series, presenter Rory McGrath returns to bring us another summer in the lives of the characters who live and work in the beautiful surroundings of the Lake District Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â£ one of the most visited parts of Britain.

This time Rory catches up with some of the people he met on his last trip and also introduces some colourful new characters.
We meet Rob Rose, a man with a passion for pigs, or rather micro pigs. Rob is on a mission to breed the perfect pet pigs and we will follow his sows to see if they can deliver the best litter yet!
We also meet sailing instructor Joe Pester and his wife Lindy who are preparing for their perfect lakeside wedding - a fitting celebration for their love of the Lake District.
WeÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³ll also catch up with hotelier Thomas The Gladiator Noblett and his right hand man Andrew The Admiral Tighe.  Last year we saw Thomas conquer the Windermere two-way swim and make a valiant attempt at swimming the English Channel. This year heÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s heading for Dover once again and we discover he has another epic challenge lined up.
