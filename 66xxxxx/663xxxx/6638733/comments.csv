,RC_Ebooks,2011-10-21T22:04Z,"The fix is so simple, it's nauseating:
Change your game start link to
""Star Wars Republic Commando\GameData\System\SWRepublicCommando.exe""

In Extras, there is a music video and a ""making of"" video. Does anyone know where to get the other 3 featurettes, or are they on CD 2?"
,RC_Ebooks,2011-10-21T22:08Z,"NO, the battle movies are NOT on 2nd CD.
Where to acquire? Checking youtube..."
