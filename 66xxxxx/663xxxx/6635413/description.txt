Handplanes evoke the romance of an earlier era, when they performed countless woodworking tasks from preparing stock to shaping moldings. In The Handplane Book, aficionado Garrett Hack reveals the rich heritage of this classic tool with a treasure trove of information and history, including detailed guidance on how to buy a plane, tune it up, and use it. Lavishly illustrated with 175 photos and 152 illustrations, Hack engagingly traces the tool's lineage from Roman times to the present, with emphasis on the golden age of handplanes from the late 19th and the early 20th centuries.
