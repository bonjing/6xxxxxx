,ferrabra,2011-08-26T12:05Z,Man... rar files.... I am no into it :(
,Bynx,2011-08-26T12:27Z,"Its also MKV files. The quality is great, but its only a tv show. Watch it once and toss it. An avi file will be about 350 Mb."
,nyder,2011-08-26T21:54Z,"Bynx, not sure what you are smoking, but an avi file would only be 350 if it's the SD version of the show, not the 720p like this is.

While some people do like to squeeze 720p down into 350mb size files, i don't recommend it because it looks bad when their is a lot of motion."
