Description: The main idea of â€‹â€‹the game - a confrontation between two teams - Special Forces and terrorists. Gameplay is based on the classic Counter-Strike. All the classic card redone, taking into account the capacity of engine: enhanced detail, changed the texture and model.

Depending on the type of game, each team must perform certain tasks:
-De - terrorists should disrupt bomb at special points and bookmarks, and special forces - to prevent them, or defuse the bomb.
-Cs - special forces should take hostages at the place of salvation, and the terrorists - to prevent it.
-Community players and has also developed maperov other, informal types of games (fy, dm, foh, and others)
-Counter-Strike: Source (CS: S) - a continuation of the old CS, but on a new engine company called Valve Source engine. The same engine is made and Half-Life 2.

In fact CS: S has a minimal difference in the game plan from his predecessor. Hitboxes been reworked, improved network code and fixes some bugs, taken from previous versions. In addition, it was doubled (to 64) the maximum number of players on the server. On the map, still played by two teams - Counter-Terrorists (CT) and Terrorists (T). We use all the same scenario - a bomb clearance (maps de_) and rescue the hostages (map cs_). All weapons are migrated from CS 1.6 with the exception of the shield. Was abandoned. Also has been cut away from buying ammunition weapons (new patch)
Completely redesigned graphics engine, sound and physics

CS: Source is more than modern, and will not cause disturbances, even in the most demanding players, while most are guaranteed to be delighted. Weapon models look very realistic and far more beautiful than those that are in the CS1.6. The same goes for the player models. Supervisory player will notice that the arms provided with a telescopic sight, can see their surroundings from behind a player on the lens a sight when it is in nepriblizhennom state.

Sound of the game has undergone significant changes that made CS: S even more realistic. Sounds of getting changed now, according to the peculiarities of the affected surface. Was also included support for Surround Sound 5.1 and 7.1 - a very useful feature, making it possible to accurately determine the distance to an approaching enemy, and the direction of his approach.

On the maps, a host of fine details. Such as bottles, bags, tires, etc. All this stuff flies alive in firing at him at close or offensive explosion of a grenade. Drums, also in obedience to the gunshots and explosions, fall and roll, whether it's sloping surface. Body of fallen opponent gently settle down and obeying Â«ragdoll physicsÂ» fly off to the side of an abandoned your fellow grenades. In the hot shooting bullets incision walls and floor, causing fountains of life to pieces. Picture in CS: Source Â«alive.""

In CS: S uses the remakes of old popular cards. In terms of architecture maps do not differ from their originals. But their design has completely changed. When you find yourself in the game, you'll know where to go, but at first will become more and more looking around, admiring the beauty of the environment ... while catching another Headshots per enemy.
