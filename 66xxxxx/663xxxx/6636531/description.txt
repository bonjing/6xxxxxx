A senator's grandson is murdered while incarcerated at California's notorious "Doscher State Prison", knicknamed "Dachau" by convicts for the number of unsolved murders of inmates that have taken place therein. Hired by the senator, Gulf War veteran John Woodrow (Tommy Lee Thomas) infiltrates the prison to find the murderer, and learns that the grandson was killed by corrupt head guard Lt. Hopkins (Eric Roberts). When Hopkins discovers Woodrow's true identity, he has him tortured by inamates and guards. After an arduous shooting chase through the desert, Woodrow escapes.
