,Billythebat,2011-08-29T13:27Z,"Because if you bothered to work out how these files are distributed from its initial source you would know why.  

That said...he is giving the full HD version of BB....eztv or vtv are not providing this service...you can go kindly fuck your self in light of your comments."

,otnemem,2011-08-29T15:04Z,"Billy, it takes 1m to unRAR before it is posted as a torrent. What's you excuse? Being ""scene""?

Also, DibyaTPB posted the same torrent unRARed 10m earlier so stfu."
,Esmad3,2011-09-12T13:38Z,"Billythebat : You can go fuck yourself. No-one needs rars for video, thats why hardly anyone uses them anymore, and the quality of this upload is not ok, so no i'm not gonna' be thanking anybody here."
