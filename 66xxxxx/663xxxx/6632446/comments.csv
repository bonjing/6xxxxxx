,shelbylab,2011-08-27T06:58Z,Thanks
,shadowgp7,2011-08-27T11:23Z,Great!Thanx for the 3D (SBS) Release.
,fatonpan,2011-08-29T19:03Z,is it possible to see it on hdtv not 3d
,AdeelAhmad,2011-08-30T06:50Z,Yes i am also wondering about this thing as i am unable to find this movie in 1920*1080. I do not have a 3D capable TV so can i watch it on normal HDTV without glasses.
,stalloutoftime,2011-08-30T17:34Z,This says it's in English but when played and the info in the .nfo are German?? and there no choice to witch the audio.
[V],DownTYU,2011-08-30T18:50Z,"For one you cannot watch a SBS video in HDTV unless you want two squashed Johnny Depps...

And second why people never use a decent player...The file has two audio tracks..CHANGE IT."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-09-01T16:50Z,"i should check it out.  i have a 3d tv, but never use it for that."
,i.me.myself,2011-09-02T20:34Z,please seed guys. seeding speed is so less.. i m d/ld it from 28-8 and till today it is 76.6% done! thanks in advance.
,720plover,2011-09-04T22:40Z,"thanks a lot, just watched it. 

as to regards to the language, on my samsung tv I press ""Tools"" on the remote, and change the language to English. you can choose both German and English. 

Quality is nice, not too much 3D but not annoying either. 

Obviously you cannot watch this movie without 3D glasses, educate yourselves on 3D movies!!!"
,prasenna,2011-09-05T15:01Z,"Great Stuff. Saw it on my samsung 3D TV with denon HT

,otksRED,2011-09-08T07:07Z,"why would you download a 3d movie, when you dont have a 3d tv? thats like downloading a ps3 game.... when you have a 360. VLC PLAYER its free, it plays everything, no bumps at all. inless you bust out a line, then itll take your stash"
,Paperhouse2007,2011-09-08T17:33Z,"Want to play this in English on PS3.  Tried MKV2VOB, tried DiVX, all only convert the german track.  Help?"
,BFF,2011-09-08T20:38Z,"Hey, I need some help with this 3D thing, I have a Samsung 3d tv and glasses, now how do I get this to play on my tv? connecting a external harddrive with this movie on to the TV dosen'r rly work it shows it wierd :/ is there anything else I should try with? I have borrowed a 3d movie in a store and played it through my ps3 and that worked great but downloaded movies don't want to work for me :("
,maki1999,2011-09-08T21:31Z,CAN I WATCH THIS WITHOUT 3D TV LIKE VLC OR BS PLAYER ??? ANSWER PLEASE 
,kaz182,2011-09-09T01:46Z," DownTYU, the question about the 2 audio tracks is a legit problem because those of us who are using a media server to stream our mkv's, can't choose a track that we want to listen to. It goes straight to the German track, and it is the same problem with a lot of these 3D movies. Most of us DO have high end 3D blu ray players but do not want to be burning discs. Make sense?"
,kaz182,2011-09-09T01:49Z,Thanks by the way for the amazing upload. Great quality.
,visakh006,2011-09-09T04:59Z,what about quality ?
,frey7777,2011-09-09T12:25Z,Thanks mate. Got any link on english subtitle?
,Paperhouse2007,2011-09-09T16:33Z,"BFF:  PS3 will not play this file format directly.  It is an MKV and must be converted to one of the many other formats that work just fine on PS3 (but no one seems to ever want to upload).  There is a program called MKV2VOB that can help with that conversion, however in the case of this and a few other 3D uploads, they keep putting a non-English language track as the primary audio, and we can't seem to find a way to convert with just the English on there."
,BFF,2011-09-09T18:11Z,paperhouse: Thanks a lot!
,720plover,2011-09-09T20:47Z,"quality 10, audio 10

however the actual film is pretty terrible, and there is not a single scene which ""uses"" 3d :(

films like Avatar, Drive angry or resident evil use the ""coming out of screen"" 3d a lot, this film doenst. 

not complaining, thanks a lot for upload, its just those of you who cant get it to work, dl a good 720p rip and its just as good/bad. 

again for some of you, you need A 3D tv and GLASSES. on samsung use "" tools"" on the remote and change the audio. This is why Samsung rules :) 
"
,kaz182,2011-09-10T01:36Z,well said paperhouse
,unbeliever69,2011-09-10T19:12Z,"Why not use MKVMergeGUI to change default language (or remove the unwanted one altogether)?
It's easy..."
,barryG,2011-09-11T08:02Z,"Hi I have a samsung 55""3D TV and a samsung blu ray 3D player have tried burning this to a bluray DVD and it plays but only in split screen ,can any one help please on how to watch this in 3D cheers"
,barryG,2011-09-11T08:06Z,BFF did you manage to get it working?
,stvoyager1,2011-09-14T18:44Z,"@BarryG, you have to turn on the 3D using your remote or it will just show side by side, read your manual if your stuck mate.

@Kaz182, why burn a disc? Those with decent 3D tvs and 3D bluray players can play these as they are off a flash drive / external HDD. Using the tools button allows audio change once the mkv is playing.

@720plover, yes you are correct. Samsung are the best. No problems with my 3D (once turned on) or audio changing whilst NOT burning a disc and enjoying of an external HDD.

@Paperhouse2007, dont use a PieceofShit3 then lol. They are obviously vastly inferior to a standalone BR player if they cannot change the audio track!!"

Look for the 3D button near the bottom. You will need a powerful graphics card to get the best from any true HD 3D movie."

,Paperhouse2007,2011-09-30T16:08Z,"fuck you stvoyager.  the PS3 is perfectly capable of switching audio tracks.  your POShit upload is incapable of being converted with both audio tracks on it.  If you had any consideration for the people downloading your shit, you wouldn't have uploaded something with German as it's primary language, you Nazi cunt."
,Nuubzta,2011-10-14T00:59Z,What speeds are you guys getting ? I've been downloading for over 48 hours and only downloaded 2.3gb but seeded 3.7gb

,Nuubzta,2011-10-21T17:39Z,"@deeroy12
maybe you could try using an program called Playback (works on Mac) to convert the movie to mp4, thats what i've been doing, 3D movies have been lagging when I play them in MKV"
,katsiakoumstos,2011-10-23T22:50Z,Can i play this movie to my Samsung USB tv?
,darkill666,2011-10-24T18:23Z,"how play this movies in a ps3 is easy ify have your sistem hack using the showtime player you can play ( mkv ) files then activate the side to side 3d mode  and zoon in the movie into u get the  best pic  and

,webwebster,2011-10-26T21:43Z,Nope.  I had the same problem as deeroy12.  It's a bum torrent.  The data is corrupted.

if you want to get rid of the german audio use mkvmerge GUI

,Neonridr,2011-12-10T16:51Z,"ok, for everyone here who is having troubles.

First off - if you don't have a 3DTV or 3D capable PC Monitor - don't even bother downloading this.  It will be a waste of your bandwith to download something you can't watch.

For people who are having trouble playing the movie.  Once you start the movie, it's going to look all distorted and you will see double images.  This is because the movie is being played in Side By Side 3D.  You need to switch your TV over to Side By Side mode and it will make everything look normal.  Since it's not a bluray disc, your TV will not automatically detect that it's a 3D file and make the switch."
