This contains all 363 shows from 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' (AHP) and 'The Alfred Hitchcock Hour' (TAHH) - and a very healthy plethora of custom extras are included. 

Series 1 to 4 of AHP are DVD rips, as is the first series of TAHH. Unfortunately, that is all that's available on DVD, but don't worry - every single episode is here, though the source quality does vary for other series. Series 5 to 7 of AHP are nearly all excellent quality television rips, series 2 and 3 of TAHH are VHS quality, but hey it's the best there is right now. If you know otherwise, or have better copies, please share them with us.

A lot of work went into assembling and ordering the material in this torrent (including a few re-encodes). I am certain that these represent the best available copies of each of these shows right now. Please download and help me to seed, this is a very large upload, and I expect it will take me a week to seed to 100%, give or take a day. Please help me out from the beginning. This should be seeded NEARLY 24 hours a day at some speed, though there will be parts of the day where my upload speed drops, and very occasionally I may have to reboot the PC or do some maintenance. Don't panic! I'll seed this until there are plenty of seeds, if I'm offline for an hour or 2 it won't make a difference, I'll be back. Until I am, it's up to you to share the data you have.


Enjoy and Seed!!
