Coming on the 10th anniversary of Will's first audition for Pop Idol in 2001, 'Echoes' is the follow up to his Platinum selling 'Hits' collection and is his fifth studio album in a career spawning over 8 million sales so far. â€˜Echoesâ€™ has been produced by Richard X (MIA, Kelis, Goldfrapp) who Will chose after falling in love with Steve Masonâ€™s (Beta Band) â€˜Boys Outsideâ€™ album that Richard produced. With â€˜Echoesâ€™ Will has sidestepped some of his traditional sounds to move more into the world of electronic music, making an album of sophistry and gentility that pulses with the undercurrents of the dance-floor. The sweeping strings and key changes of his hit ballads have made way for synthesised melody, towards something sparer and more controlled. â€˜I had to learn to undo my musical muscle memory,â€™ he explains. â€˜To allow space into the music.â€™
Will has written all but one song on â€˜Echoesâ€™ along with a personally assembled roll call of collaborators including Jim Eliot & Mima Stilwell (Kylie), Andy Cato (Groove Armada) and Pascal Gabriel (Ladyhawke). â€˜Jealousyâ€™ is Willâ€™s first single release since the acclaimed â€˜Historyâ€™ collaboration with Groove Armada that became one of the sounds of last summer.
