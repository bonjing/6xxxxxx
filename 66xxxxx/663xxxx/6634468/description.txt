Plot:
When his brother is killed in a robbery, paraplegic Marine Jake Sully decides to take his
place in a mission on the distant world of Pandora. There he learns of greedy corporate
figurehead Parker Selfridge's intentions of driving off the native humanoid "Na'vi" in order
to mine for the precious material scattered throughout their rich woodland. In exchange for
the spinal surgery that will fix his legs, Jake gathers intel for the cooperating military
unit spearheaded by gung-ho Colonel Quaritch, while simultaneously attempting to infiltrate
the Na'vi people with the use of an "avatar" identity. While Jake begins to bond with the
native tribe and quickly falls in love with the beautiful alien Neytiri, the restless Colonel
moves forward with his ruthless extermination tactics, forcing the soldier to take a stand -
and fight back in an epic battle for the fate of Pandora.

Release notes:
RUBY rip was nuked for overlaps and out of sync subs. For differences between THEATRiCAL,
SE and EXTENDED, see:

Also, we made it 3CD because the 2CD 576x320 + 128 kbps mp3 encode had an average I/P quant
above 4.5 (picture of 2CD encode stats included for proof):

"If at the lowest resolution allowed and MP3 audio bitrate of 128 kbps average I/P quant is
 above 4.5, releases may jump 1 size up (e.g. 2 CDs may be used instead of 1). Such cases
 MUST provide proper proof and explanation in the nfo."

enjoy!
