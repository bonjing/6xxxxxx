,jimmyjamesbob,2011-09-03T08:42Z,i run the application and ubisoft opens then just closes
,mikinho8,2011-09-03T16:07Z,"I'm on Windows 7 64-bit, and here's what worked for me:

1) Download this torrent.
2) Install the game by mounting the .iso and using the install wizard.
3) Once installed, go to the install directory you chose during installation, or C:\Program Files(x86)\Ubisoft\From Dust\ by default, and run From_Dust.exe. This updates the game.
4) Once it's done updating, a box will come up asking for a username and password. Close this window.
5) Open the .iso using WinRAR or some other program to open it as a folder, rather than running it like a disc.
6) Open the SKIDROW folder.
7) Take the From_Dust.exe from the SKIDROW folder and copy it to your install directory, replacing the one you just used in step 3.
8) In the orbit folder (which is inside the SKIDROW folder) copy the UbisoftGameLauncher.exe and paste it in C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\.
9) Launch the game using From_Dust.exe.

This method worked for me, and I have the game running as I type this. I didn't have to put in a username and password anywhere. Good luck."

I repeat, ALL you need is ""From_Dust.exe"" and ""UbisoftGameLauncher.exe""

Do NOT use any of the extra files. "

,mhiel,2011-09-13T17:37Z,is this working in offline mode?
,Mone008,2011-09-20T01:34Z,"If your getting the patch failed error you have to set the ""From_Dust.exe"" to windows XP sp3 compatibility mode and also run as admin :)"
,owen2nz,2011-10-10T14:24Z,well i followed the step exactly and now its just stuck at the 'U Play' screen with a couple of loading circes spinning around and piss all words. At the bottom i clicked a button but then it says its unable to locate or start game. Whats wrong?
