,googaloop,2011-08-31T02:43Z,"From the hardworking people who are kind and selfless, constantly ripped off by employers & bankrupt economies rendering them so poor that they can't afford software they need to survive: We salute you! 

To those of you that can afford to pay for software but just don't give a fuck about quality programmers but would rather waste loads of cash on placating undeserving girlfriends, expensive sports cars, and overpriced designer clothing: dump the girlfriend, sell the car, and give those nice clothes to someone who needs to look good for a job interview, and give any deserving hardworking laborers, programmers and cashiers a nice tip or a good wage for a change. You will be amazed at how good it feels to make a big difference in someones life. If you don't give a fuck and continue to waste good money on the undeserving... then shame on you! That hallow feeling inside will always be there no matter how much cocaine you snort or sex you have."
,googaloop,2011-08-31T04:11Z,"I went through and deleted all the .plist files that had been added at the times of install, any screenflow files, and telestream, turned off my wifi & reinstalled. Crazy thing is when I opened it up there was my last test recording. But then I went into the preferences and unlocked the activation and entered your key. 

I exported and viola! It worked.

Do I need to add any tricky little snitch rules in case it tries to call home or do I not need to worry about it?"
,googaloop,2011-08-31T04:15Z,"That previous comment was regarding the fact that I had a previously installed demo that produces a massive 'screenflow' watermark on any exported video. My first install didn't work, but now it does praise Buddha! I can finish my work now! TONS OF THANKS. 

?Is it safe to update this or will that deactivate it?"
,AniXiaN,2011-09-02T03:06Z,"There is one problem I foundâŚ Updating to 3.0.1 will cause to deactivate ScreenFlow. The key won't work anymore for activating ScreenFlow.

So I guess I'm going to be on 3.0 until something comes up to fix this problem."
