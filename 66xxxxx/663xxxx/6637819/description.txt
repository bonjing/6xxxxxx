Extreme Lives: Prison Love
Prison Love explores the difficult nature of relationships behind bars. It also raises the bigger question of whether some of the most dangerous criminals on Earth deserve to find love. This documentary looks at how love is facilitated when one half of the couple is in prison. Visiting a number of prisons in America, we see how in Tennessee a man who is serving life imprisonment finds love on the Internet and marries his fiancee knowing the marriage will never be consummated. Elsewhere, a pregnant woman in California who marries her husband at the county jail says her vows behind a glass wall. Over in Brazil, one woman pursues another until the pair are officially an item and can even share a prison cell. But under the strict regime of the prison, can their love flourish?
