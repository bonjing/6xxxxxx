,evadw,2011-08-26T12:04Z,How come it's so big at 24fps? Does it have all the features from the disc too?
[V],DownTYU,2011-08-26T12:11Z,The bitrate is very high at 15 mbps and I waited 8 goddamn hours for the CHD rip now they have upped it after 24 hrs at 13 Gig...I don't know if anyone will upload it. I can but given the circumstances I won't.
[V],BOZX,2011-08-26T14:05Z,"i added the CHD one since no one did... i thought some one had.. but.....
well this one i nice encode too.. gud for who want the best...rather have to compromise abit wid CHD encode."
,WIL300,2011-08-27T17:57Z,How do you get english subs to work during non english speaking parts? Thanks
,sweetchuk,2011-08-28T04:54Z,"@Will300 - you cannot. This version does not have the necessary subs for non-English speaking parts, alas.

@BOXZ - this is hardly the benchmark 1080p encode for this movie. Nice transfer, but if it cannot even have the subs for non-English speaking parts like a 720p less than half its size, then it doesn't say much for your contention of its 'best of the best' tag."
