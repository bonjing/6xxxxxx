,feralmike,2011-08-30T03:16Z,"My first comment ever, and I gotta be critical, sorry.
V:7
A:6
While I appreciate the efforts of all our rippers and uploaders, this is the third ETRG release I've tried that's had lousy av encoding.  Blocky and sometimes choppy, and audio is in MONO, 96khz.  I understand it's a low filesize, but is an extra 50 mb or so not worth hearing two separate, standard stereo left-right audio channels?
Upper:  Thanks for trying.
Downers: Try something else.  Good flick."
,feralmike,2011-08-30T03:19Z,"96 kbps, not khz.  48khz.  Apologies.
Still lousy.  Thanks though."
,feralmike,2011-08-30T08:52Z,"No subs for foreign language scenes either...good god man.  Guess it's ok, since you've uploaded like four other encodes. (?)"
,Karsz,2011-08-30T18:40Z,"@feralmike Learn to read asshole, there's a sub folder that comes with this torrent holding english subs."
,feralmike,2011-08-30T21:15Z,"That's subs for the entire movie, and that's not what I was talking about.  Let me try again, since I'm apparently not the only one who can't read:
""NO SUBS FOR FOREIGN LANGUAGE SCENES.""
Did you catch it that time?
What about this?
GET FUCKED."
,vacuoso,2011-09-02T21:51Z,yep i gotta say the lack of hardcoded subs for the extensive foreign-language scenes is annoying as fuck. otherwise (considering the file size) A7 V8
,kajinster,2011-09-06T07:15Z,"I do appreciate the effort, but I ended up having to look for another version because of the lack of subtitles on parts where foreign languages were spoken."

,Nestea_Zen,2011-09-13T09:08Z,"Had I seen this has 96 kbps I wouldn't have got it. Audio is between 5-6. I also should have read feralmike's comment. Oh well, 54 min through the movie."
,N3tw0rkbomb3r,2011-09-15T18:23Z,@furnaps Use Peer block or peer guardian. You wont have anymore issues with ISP emails.

,ThisBetterShittyWok,2011-10-17T10:54Z,"The supplied subtitles DO NOT WORK on anything I have tried - Linux and MS media players, and a dedicated hardware player with very recent firmware.  ""SubSplit"" format - what the FUCK is that?  Some Bluray gayness?

ANYWAY - its a good rip otherwise, audio and video quite acceptable and for once we dont have to go over the stupid fucking GIG limit just for a movie.

For English speakers who need subs during the German, French and Russian scenes in this otherwise spoken English movie:

A proper .srt file for subtitles is available here, it works & I used it.
