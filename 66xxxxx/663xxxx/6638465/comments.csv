It's not 'Paranoic' as you so eloquently put, it's 'Paranoid'. Talk less and make urself seem less stupid. "

,Dramat,2011-12-21T19:26Z,"Episode: ""STAR TREK ENTERPRISE - S04 E22 - Finale Fan Edit.mp4"" in not the proper last episode!

There's no last episode ""These Are the Voyages""...

Besides this one problem, upload is very nice."
,Nancy2B,2011-12-25T02:26Z,Thank You - I  l o v e this series :}
,grrrr716,2012-06-11T00:52Z,"@ILPruny, love your uploads, but seriously, what's up with ONLY including the fan edit of the last episode? A lot of people LIKED the next gen tie-in, and it was the proper last episode. If you wanted the fan edit in the torrent, you should have put BOTH in.

@fearloathingandparanoia-Dude, fuck the hell off. Millions of people around the world love Star Trek, most of them could do without you and your big mouth. Uploaders don't have an obligation to upload what YOU think is ""worthwhile"". If you've got such a strong fucking opinion about what should be uploaded, do it yourself."
