Offering a uniquely modern, balanced approach, Tussy/Gustafson/Koenig's BASIC MATHEMATICS FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS, Fourth Edition, integrates the best of traditional drill and practice with the best elements of the reform movement. To many developmental math students, mathematics is like a foreign language. They have difficulty translating the words, their meanings, and how they apply to problem solving. Emphasizing the "language of mathematics," the text's fully integrated learning process is designed to expand students' reasoning abilities and teach them how to read, write, and think mathematically. It blends instructional approaches that include vocabulary, practice, and well-defined pedagogy with an emphasis on reasoning, modeling, communication, and technology skills.
