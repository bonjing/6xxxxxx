,peterwan,2011-09-06T15:16Z,"Sorry about not adding the instruction

How to play skirmish....

Go to the installed dir of your sc2 and

search for the dir name ""OpenMe"" 

Example...
C:\Program Files\StarCraft II\OpenMe

open that dir and copy the entire dir

""StarCraft II"" to your ""My Documents""

folder, again go to the installed dir

of your sc2 and find the dir ""LAUNCHER"" 
Example...
C:\Program Files\StarCraft II\LAUNCHER

run the SCALLin1.exe

click the maps tab and choose add maps

from dir and then browse for the SC2 dir

in your ""My Documents"" select the maps dir

and click the ok button, this will add

the maps to SC2ALLin1 dir. Now in SC2ALLin1

you can play the map you want and modify

your race, teams BLAH!BLAH!BLAH! click

launch.

now you can Play Skirmish...

,steelllynx,2011-09-23T19:20Z,"Runs OK the first time, but after that it just dies silently when trying to run it."
,matias676,2011-09-25T03:08Z,"ok i followed your directions and video, i ran StarCraft II.exe closed it, then tried to run SC2ALLin1.exe an error message pops up and says: ""Can't load your settings! You may have deleted my default directories! Delete the settings file and retry, or reinstall the application!"" then another message pops up saying ""Access to the path 'C:\Program Files (x86)\StarCraft II\Luncher\lastmap.SC2Map' is denied"" theres no lastmap.SC2Map there"
,peterwan,2011-09-25T14:42Z,"Only two problems, so i think it is with
your system config

now how should i help you ""steelllynx""
i can`t be out there with you fixing the
problem:)

i have tested it on my old Sony-Vaio-WinXp-Pro
32bit with SP2 core 2 duo 2.10ghz, 2gb ram ATI-RADEON with only 256mb video memory
and on my desktop pc with Win7pro 64bit which i mostly play games it ran perfect.

i think the problem is in your system
please check or post your system config

and for ""matias676"" i always make a dir
D drive ""Games"" and install the games out
there, i do not install anything on drive C
not a good idea, some times C drive needs
to be formatted, please uninstall and try again
and if it didnt fix the problem then make a video
so that i can see how you install it."
,steelllynx,2011-10-03T22:23Z,"Plays OK, just finished about ten missions on hard.

It's just that usually what happens is after rebooting I run the game and it starts OK.  If I exit and try to play again before rebooting it just shows the 'connecting to patch server' for a second then that goes away and nothing.  I usually have to reboot to get it to work again.

Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit, 8 GB RAM, Athlon X2 4600+, ATI 4800 HD."
,Arklon,2011-10-19T03:52Z,"Anyone know what Version this is.  I've tried lookin in the EXE's info but it gives me version numbers that dont seem to match up.

,neaai,2012-01-07T15:27Z,"Regarding the comment of jboyken3 for the key duplication:

It is SCAM. And boyken3 is probably someone who feels smart enough to gather genuinely bought CD keys via some social engineering and getting people to believe all sorts of shit. An abuser who must be taken out and not shot, but skinned while alive.

Do not do what he says. There is NO WAY blizzard would use some shit like blizzardmoderator@somedoman-which-is-not-blizzard-or-battlenet.com

You have been warned. Proceed to those instructions at your own risk."
