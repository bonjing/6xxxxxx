,WingedDevil,2011-09-04T21:26Z,Don't know if its just me or not but theres no sound file to it... just gives me this kinda loud screeching...
,Ruby_pirate,2011-09-08T07:53Z,"10/10 ! The video and audio quality are GREAT! Thanks a lot ExtraTorrentRG :)

@WingedDevil The audio is ok, so maybe try using VLC Player to watch the movie and I think it will be fine"
,jauser,2011-09-16T19:39Z,"yeah same here I keep getting screeches
using Media Player Classic from K-Lite btw

so sound doesn't work but Video is 10"
,ashleycole12345,2011-09-18T00:44Z,"I can confirm that this torrent is a complete pile of fucking shit. Took 4 or so hours to download and it doesn't work in anything other than VLC, and even then it is jumpy and keeps freezing. Avoid this upload!"
,TTNandR,2011-09-18T12:53Z,"Resolution: 1920 x 816

not 1080p just fyi"
,hlamdo,2011-09-19T04:50Z,Don't want to waste time to download such large file. You can Stream it: mediaupload.us/fuWX
,legalpimp,2011-09-22T14:17Z,"@TTNandR

That IS 1080. Note the 1920 width. I'm not gonna explain just Google it."
,bitsonhj,2011-09-24T08:23Z,ME also i dont have sound when playing ....even played in VLC but no luck.....can you give the sound file in another torrent???
,vivatpb5776,2011-09-30T02:32Z,Audio is fine. Not sure why others are having issues. Video is excellent. Embedded subs would be nice for the Portuguese parts (movie shot in Rio). Thank you uploader.
,AA_tech,2011-10-07T23:13Z,"Audio missing when not played on PC with right codec, plus image gets distorted cuz of high resolution and pc monitors don't support that. But where is the fucking point on getting 3.19gb of file and wanting to play it on pc and not maybe on your 40pfl HDtv screen and getting full image experience??And don't give me some fucking retarded answer like ""there are 40pfl pc monitors"" or ""tv's these days have pc conn. option""......fucking retards"
,SilentFreya,2011-10-09T16:30Z,@legalpimp He is talking about the 816 that should be 1080p so basically I don't think this is 1080p just higher then 720p.
,aspiratr7,2011-10-10T18:51Z,"Video is an Exelent 10 but Audio is Pure Bullshit, no audio whatsoever, downloaded in 1 hr so dont mind lookin for another working torrent..... "
,H_Mist,2011-10-11T02:58Z,"No audio whatsoever, or depending on the player, I got SFX but no vocals. Maybe it was just me, but it seams others are having issues as well :/"
,Painweaver,2011-10-14T18:46Z,"People having sound issues, you can change the codec to 2 ch and that would even let you here on xbox and ps3."

Ironic last two words there. Nothing you said is correct. You, sir, are a dolt."
,Halemane,2011-12-15T15:54Z,"For everyone who are complaining about the audio:

If you play the movie using Media Player Classic, the audio gives problems. I do not know why.

So, play the movie using VLC Media Player. It should work just fine. Enjoy! :)"
