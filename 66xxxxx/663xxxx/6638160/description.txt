--------------
4.0.10 Changes
--------------

* Tiny corrections in about window
* Properly wait until relevant modules are loaded before
  giving trainer access to read/write operations
* Added error checking if relevant modules can't be loaded
* More consistent lookup of base addresses
* Replaced CAPS-LOCK with SHIFT keys when using hotkeys
  It is easier to use the shift key than using the caps lock

 (See Changelog.txt for all changes since version 4.0)

WOW64
-----

WOW64 is an emulation software layer that emulates x86 applications on 64 bit windows.
Some people report problems when running trainer using this layer, but I can confirm
that this trainer works flawlessly on win32 platforms.

About Trainer
-------------

This trainer is designed to work with Civilization 5 v 1.0.1.348
DirectX 9 and DirectX 11.

It will contaminate and corrupt memory if you do.

Switched Cheats
---------------

BEWARE: Always turn off switched cheats before making another turn. ALT + BACKSPACE will quickly turn off all switched cheats.

1: MOVEMENT SWITCH:
This cheat gives unlimited movement points to units. Set initial movement points in the editbox, this is not necessary as it already is set to a good initial value.

2: EXPERIENCE SWITCH:
This cheat gives experience to units. Set the experience value you want in the editbox then click your units you want to apply this value upon, one after another. You only need to click them once, you can also scroll quickly through all units with the arrow buttons.

3: HEALING SWITCH:
This cheat will set health points on your units. Set the health point you want in the editbox on the left side (it can be in the range of 0-10 where 0 is no health and 10 is full health) Then click all units you want to set this health value upon.

4: CITY MODIFIER SWITCH:
This is probably the most complex cheat to use. (It's really not that complex). This cheat will set the city modifier value (it is in percentage %).

It will set the modifier value on 3 things: Production, Science and Gold. To have this cheat work you will need to buy OR sell a building that affects any of these 3 areas. Thats it.

Quick hints: I recommend buying:

University	(to enable modifier for science)
Factory		(to enable production modifier)
Stock Exchange	(to enable gold modifier)

You can also sell buildings that affects these areas, the modifier will update that way too.

UpDown Controls
---------------

I have added Up-Down controls to all edit boxes in the program.
You may change values in an edit box in many ways:

1: Click a button to choose a predefined value.
2: Click the edit box and type a custom value.
3: Click the up-down control buttons to change values.
4: Use the up-down arrow keys on your keyboard.
5: Use mouse wheel to change values.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Q1: Trainer doesnt work?
A1: Use only with Civ 5 version 1.0.1.348. It will not work with other versions.

Q2: Trainer still doesnt work?
A2: Your firewall/antivirus blocked it or sandboxed it. Unblock it, shut down trainer and restart it again

Q3: Trainer is still not working?
A3: The 6 primary cheats will only update after you click a city or any operations that updates the display

Q4: I use WinXP and the trainer runs and quits almost instantly?
A4: Try to run it using Win98 Compatability mode.
