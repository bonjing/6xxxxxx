By William D. Callister, David G. Rethwisch - John Wiley & Sons (2007) - Hardback - 882 pages - ISBN 0470125373
Callister and Rethwischâ€™s Fundamentals of Materials Science and Engineering third edition continues to take the integrated approach to the organization of topics.  That is, one specific structure, characteristic, or property type at a time is discussed for all three basic material typesâ€”viz. metals, ceramics, and polymeric materials.  This order of presentation allows for the early introduction of non-metals and supports the engineerâ€™s role in choosing materials based upon their characteristics.
