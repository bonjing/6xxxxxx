I'm going to take a break before finishing up with Lost to download this gem as well as Caprica, even though I wasn't a fan of Caprica it deserves to be put out there. Rest assured the rest of Lost is sitting on my hard drive waiting to be uploaded. 

Because Defying Gravity was never released on Blu-ray these are all HDTV rips. Thanks to the original uploader, I only converted these out of .mkv format from their upload. 

Be warned, this show got cancelled, so there's only the one season. Don't go watching it with intentions to watch more. I will say this though, its definitely worth the watch anyways.

And now; for the usual:


Thank you to all the teams, scenes and other uploaders that have brought so much delightful fun into my life.
 
Please help seed when done.

As always, please be patient for the first 3-4 days after I initially upload the torrent. Thank you to all those that have helped seed my other torrents, which allows me to continue uploading new stuff. 


If anyone has any requests, post below.

Coming up in films: Inception 1080p, The New World 1080p, Ratatouille 1080p and more. Kingdom of Heaven as well, don't fear. 
 
|- These are all my personal files, films and television shows that I could not find (most often in high resolution) in a format that would allow me to simply pop on a external hard drive. I converted all these files, most often from original .mkv sources, and since they are sitting there decided to share them.
 Though my torrents take a few days to download, most of the original sources that I myself downloaded took a few days.
 So, if you want to go find and download those original sources and then convert them to work on your PS3 yourself, awesome, but if you were as frustrated as I was and either don't want to convert them or don't know how, here you go.-| 


Thank you's are welcome.
