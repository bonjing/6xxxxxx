              available from the boot menu,AND a windows7PE system for all your windows recovery needs.simply burn the .iso to a cd using imageburn or simillar iso burning software,or extract
              the contents of the iso to a properly formatted usb stick,set ur comp to boot from cd or usb(as your needs dictate)and boot it up,choose either parted magic(for linux recovery)
              or Win7PE_SE for windows recovery.iv kept the win7pe small enough to boot easily with the most functionality i could fit into the limited space on a cd,however the linux parted
              magic is a full version with all the trimmings:-)enjoy and leave feedback at the torrent page at the pirate bay......you are welcome to look at my other torrents for differing fla
              vours of rescue discs and PE systems built using winbuilder 80 under the name redback38 at TPB.....Enjoy!
       this disk is awesome for virus removal,traceless(on the host comp)for pretty much all your pe live disc needs,burn it,boot it,check out the apps and have fun!

NOTES!this version does not have audio(saving space)or my regular games suite(usually included in my win7PE)also for space reasons.it has wifi drivers and most lan drivers for most makes and models of comps PnPutil will run at startup to install most drivers needed,however there is a drivers section in the start menu with extra mass storage and misc drivers for wifi.please test and comment here with questions/requests....
