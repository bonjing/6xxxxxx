[V],DownTYU,2011-08-30T18:32Z,I didn't know there was different versions of citizen kane...
,gregersamsa,2011-08-31T09:14Z,"Then I guess this one is NOT the 70th anniversary edition that has been meticulously cleaned by experts with an impressive sense for detail.

Unless the source actually has the same cover as the one shown here, then you have somehow managed to get a copy of a film which has not yet been released - kudos!

Check it out - release date is in two weeks :)

Media isn't manufactured and shipped and hits retail stores all in one day. Release groups don't normally have to wait for retail to rip it.

As for the version of this movie, as a completely uneducated guess, I don't think it would make sense to release both an original and a remastered version as two different products at the same time."
