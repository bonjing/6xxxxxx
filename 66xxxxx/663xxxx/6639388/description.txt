A video compilation of some rare & cool new wave/punk bands from Tokyo 1979 - 
incl. Lizard, Mr Kite, SS, 8Â½, Speed, Pain, Friction. (NB: This is a bootleg sourced 
from the VHS original, with fan-made menu (see below). Quality is good. This was 
released in conjunction with the \"Tokyo Rockers\" 12\" compilation album).
