V = 8
A =10
M = 10

Much appreciated!"
,cdtext,2011-09-04T14:55Z,"@ crazedcat?
What does the M stand for. Obviuously A is Audio and V is video?"
,crazedcat,2011-09-05T05:24Z,M = movie.  Maybe I should have said F for film? Loved it :)

Everyone should see this film!"

,spunkster,2012-01-21T16:02Z,"Kamikaji, are you sure your Peerblock was turned on and fully updated? I stopped getting those notices altogether when I started using Peerblock. 
Thanks for the heads up!"
