As the saying goes -- opposites attract -- but that is just the tip of the connection between Liz and Michael.  Liz is the cop; Michael, the corporate lawyer.  They come from different worlds:  the ivy-league world of a law firm where Michael is engaged to the boss's daughter, and the gritty world of the LAPD, where Liz is a hardboiled cop on the beat.

But from the moment Liz saves Michael from a fiery car wreck, their chemistry explodes on every level.  They try to break the spell of their mind-blowing attraction but can't and maybe they'll find they don't want to.  Enter their world filled with erotic madness and inhabited by the quirky assortment of family, friends and lovers who orbit their cosmic storm.
