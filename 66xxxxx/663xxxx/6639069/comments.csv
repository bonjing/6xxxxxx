,kloe,2011-09-03T18:33Z,"Jesus Christ, why the hell have compressed this 3 times!?! You realize that there is no real point to this?
Sorry for getting angry at this, but multi-rars (and zips) really gets on my nerves...

Anyways the game seems to install alright so I can't really complain, nice up (if I disregard the rar's...) : /"
,miguelsz3,2011-09-03T18:51Z,"@kloe
lol, I take no offence I dislike multi-compression aswell. The reason its liks that is becuase its a scene release and I prefer to keep them in their original state."
,fcarstens,2011-09-05T07:55Z,When will we see Episode 3?
,miguelsz3,2011-09-05T08:32Z,"@fcarstens

,asier680,2011-09-13T17:49Z,"@tojam; zeroApex

,tojam92,2011-09-14T05:39Z,"okay thanks I got the game to work, and it runs well on my netbook. Thanks"
,ZeRoApeX,2011-09-14T16:03Z,"Something screw'd up...

After extracting the main file there will be 5-6 more to extract (thbc.zip files). You have to open them and put the .r00 .r01 etc. files in same folder. Then extract the .zip."
,karimbeau,2011-09-24T22:08Z,seeeeeed :S i am stuck at 88%
,masaIdosa,2011-10-11T18:11Z,File is broken?! :SSSSS
,rezabrando,2011-11-15T19:41Z,"Thanks, man. Works perfectly."
,icodeit,2011-11-20T17:33Z,"In Win7 64bit the installer keeps asking for the Administrator account.  I'm logged in as a user with full administrator privileges.  In fact its the only users.

Seems this installer does not like Win7 for those that might be having the same issue."
,icodeit,2011-11-20T18:00Z,Scratch my last comment.  It seems I had adjusted my rights when I was doing some clean up.  It installs correctly.
