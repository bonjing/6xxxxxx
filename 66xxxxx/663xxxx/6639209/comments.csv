,Kole97,2011-08-30T09:48Z,"thx heaps, i can't tell ya how curious i was to watch the next ep ):-"
[V],Masterzilla,2011-08-30T11:53Z,Thanx. Great uploads as usual.
,MyFootHurts,2011-08-30T13:48Z,@Tom_thomas: was that sarcasm? Why would you want avi files?
,Bynx,2011-08-30T14:08Z,And whats wrong with avi files? Its a tv program. MKV files are double the size and not necessary for this kind of program.
,mauebh,2011-08-30T16:21Z,"thanks, brother."
,MyFootHurts,2011-08-30T18:08Z,"@Bynx: Firstly, mkv files aren't twice the size, all files are only as big as the ripper decides to make them. Secondly, avi and mkv are not codecs they are containers, so they have no significant impact on the size/quality of the file. Thirdly, xvid was superceded by h.264 (which offers twice the video quality at the same file size) 8 years ago."
,Sick_Jargon,2011-08-30T22:30Z,Thanks again VTV :)
,garak47,2011-08-31T01:52Z,"@MyFootHurts

For me, the difference with .mkv files is that you cannot stream them through Xbox. AND in my experience, I have yet to find an .mkv file of similar size to the equivalent .avi file..... the ones I have seen are always AT LEAST twice the file size...usually more....."
,loka182,2011-08-31T12:46Z,i like this show! thanks vtv

,fleckman,2011-09-12T01:33Z,@Myfoothurts apparently the majority of the users here disagree with you. I'm sure your ego would never allow you to admit you're wrong but perhaps your foot hurts because it's stuck in your mouth. Thanks to VTV for the AVI files.   ..I.
,Tom_thomas,2011-09-13T05:10Z,"AVI files work fine for me .. it just a TV show ..
Thanks Bynx ... and VTV"
,langes01x,2011-09-13T07:12Z,@garak47: The reason the mkv files are double the size is because they are usually 720p which is about 4x the resolution of a typical avi. As far as streaming goes there are ways to stream mkv to ps3 and 360 though I believe that mkv can play on the ps3 natively (at the very least it supports h264 so in the worst case you can just remux it to an mp4 or something).
,Tom_thomas,2011-09-13T07:17Z,"Thank you ""MyFootHurts"" , I have HDMI cables to my 1080 42"" , and i do very well with AVI files
- and thanks to eztv,TVteam and VTV for sharing....   :-)"
,MyFootHurts,2011-09-14T02:07Z,"@langes01x and anyone interested, use GOTSent to intelligently remux or if necessary reencode mkv (and anything else I think) to ps3/xbox compatible video.

See, ignorance is no longer an obstacle, please go with the higher quality format."
,MyFootHurts,2011-09-14T02:59Z,"@fleckman obviously they do, that's why so many people still create xvid torrents when h.264 is so superior. Statement of the obvious much?

Ego has nothing to do with it, xvid is an undeniably substandard format in comparison. If you don't believe me, get a clue. Google is -> that way."
,SuburbanSteve,2011-09-14T10:40Z,Thanx big time 
,AliZaybar,2011-09-15T21:39Z,"For the record, the PS3 does not play .mkv, and probably won't in the future. I'm not going to condemn a file format that is very useful for dubbed and subtitled shows on a multi-national site, but I just don't see much advantage for non-hearing-impaired english speakers. They're the laserdiscs of the 21st century: marginally better quality video and sound in exchange for a balky format that's not compatible with anything. The real tragedy is that each new release now has half as many seeders spread across two formats, since the community is increasingly forced to take a side. A reliable converter (not WinFF) would do wonders to reduce animosity. Btw, thanks VTV; I like this show!"
,MyFootHurts,2011-09-19T04:22Z,"@AliZaybar: I'm afraid you don't know what you're talking about. mkv is a container format, it has nothing to do with video or audio quality whatsoever. In addition, this discussion was not about mkv, it's about h.264, which is a video format which tends to be found inside mkv or mp4 containers.

h.264 is the video format supported natively by ipods, ps3, psp and any other player I can think of.

mkv is not balky, it works fine. Perhaps you don't know what balky means. Perhaps you don't know how to spell bulky, but it is less bulky than most other containers so that doesn't make sense either.

mkv is supported by most modern players, it simply takes time for the average consumer to catch up.

The community is not forced to take a side, they either stick with legacy xvid in an avi container because they have some very old standalone player that doesn't support h.264, or because they don't know h.264 offers better quality.

Uploaders use xvid for 1 of 2 reasons: either they can't be bothered to practice and learn good settings for h.264 as they did in the past with xvid, so they stick with the format they know; or because they know that so many people are clueless and think xvid is the best format, so they simply supply what is demanded."
,ausvirgo,2011-09-24T04:33Z,"STOP THE FIGHT!

I haven't sold the tickets yet!

Seriously though, there seems to be a demand for both file types, and uploaders willing to provide them, so I don't see a problem.

Mind you, I've nothing against calm, rational, informative and respectful discussion (must admit though, sometimes the shitfights are amusing)!."
,ausvirgo,2011-09-24T07:09Z,"P.S.: @MyFootHurts - Thanks for the info about AVI and MKV being container formats - may explain why my TV only recognises some AVI files!

Also, I haven't had any luck yet with any MKV files on my TV (Flash drive on USB connector), so it seems my TV may be casting it's vote in favour of AVI (I'll have to check out the h.264 vs xvid issue though - might just be that all the MKV files I've tried have been the wrong codec).

Personally I tend to favour RMVB - seems to give about twice the compression for a given quality, but there don't seem to be many RMVB uploads of what I want."
