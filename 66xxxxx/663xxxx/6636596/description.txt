ALMS American Le Mans Series Race #6 of the 2011 Season

This is the "Time Warner Cable Road Race Showcase", held at Road America Raceway in Elkhart Lake on August 20, 2011. ALMS racing is unique in that there are four different classes of cars competing on the track at the same time.

Road America is a beautiful 525 acre road racing course set in Wisconsin`s scenic Kettle Moraine farmland area. At over 4 miles in length, it is the longest course in the ALMS schedule. It is also one of the fastest with the prototype cars exceeding 200MPH at the end of the longest straights.

Program was broadcast and recorded at 1280x720 resolution, lightly edited to remove commercials and station breaks, and encoded into H.264/MPEG-4 AVC at 5000Kbps video 29.97FPS and 320Kbps 48KHz audio.


Enjoy!
