,Flying_Poo,2011-08-30T17:47Z,"Really the only required hardware is a USB Jtag programmer or some way of reading the nand off the xbox and a programmed Digilent C-mod slightly modified. the tow combined is about the price you would pay for just about any other modchip. But since I already have 4 fat xenon Jtags, Im gana wait, sell them and get slims to mod for more reliability."
