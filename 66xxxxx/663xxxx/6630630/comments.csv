,iZanHF,2011-08-26T15:08Z,"Downloading now, but it looks like just RARs?"
,captain-under,2011-08-26T15:50Z,"it is a rar
but it downloads fast and works fine
thanks guys"
,jobbers63,2011-08-27T13:43Z,"rar file is broken, couldn't extract. why upload as a rar in the first place? it just causes problems..."
,7b,2011-08-28T15:33Z,"Don't upload rars. When you do, I cancel uploading immediately after d/l finishes so I can delete them post-extraction."
,aroyals,2011-09-01T07:50Z,"agreed, RARs suck but eztv was down for 2 days so there is no choice here

...well besides don't watch it :P"
,Powerslave0,2011-09-04T07:51Z,Dunno why these people use a RAR for such a small file.
