Rick Saucedo is mainly known as an Illinois-based Elvis impersonator, and a successful one at that, but some time when the Kingâ€™s ghost wasnâ€™t looking he sneaked out and cut himself two sides of music that were as far to the other end of the spectrum as you can imagine; dreamy, melodic 60s-style psychedelia.

The album opens with â€œRealityâ€, a dreamy yet concise trip of rich guitar tapestries and nice folky hooks. It is a flowing and multilayered piece of music with wistful vocals and a droning melody.

Saucedo then spins a few wheels on his kaleidoscope and via a single echoing guitar note we flow into â€œIn my mindâ€, a counterpart and alternative to the â€œRealityâ€ of almost the exact same duration. Itâ€™s at least as strong as the opening track, a little heavier with fuzz chords chugging underneath the multilayered guitars and a more cutting vocal style, albeit still totally in a 1967-68 flowerpsych mood along with the great use of organ and booming bass.

Skipping past the two roots rockers, itâ€™s time to flip the LP over and parachute into the marvelously painted landscape that constitutes Saucedoâ€™s sidelong title track. If it seems that â€œIn my mindâ€ and â€œRealityâ€ gave promises of melodic psychedelic nirvana, then â€œHeaven was blueâ€ is the realization. Clocking in at almost 19 minutes it is something unique in the psychedelic world; a successful transportation of the acid heritage from John Lennonâ€™s â€œRevolverâ€ into the domains of carefully composed suites. Saucedo pulls it off like a charm â€” stacking new melodies, guitar figures and arrangements atop the old ones every 3 minutes or so, each more swirling and enchanting than the last, and retaining a sense of progression throughout. The fact that itâ€™s less than a perfect performance, with guitars occasionally strolling off-key and the drummer seeming to wing it as he goes along, enforces the human warmth and removes any progressive rock specter forcefully.

Exactly how a moonlighting Elvis impersonator made this amazing album is one for our childrenâ€™s children to ponder.
