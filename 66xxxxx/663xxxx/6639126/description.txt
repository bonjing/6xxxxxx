Remixed audio version of The Classic Project 9.
Still great even in audio form.

Remix Explanation:
80% of this 1 hour mix is the 'Classic Project 9'.
There was too much rap and hip-hop in the original for my taste, so I chopped out some sections and added some extra tracks to keep it over 1 hour.
The result is still a perfectly sync'ed continuous megamix.
Unless you are very familiar with the original, you won't be able to tell where the edits are.

Additions:
The Verve - Bitter Sweet Harmony
Robert Dougan - Clubbed To Death
Eminem - Slim Shady (acapella)
Cher - Believe (acapella)
Gramophonedzie - Why Don't You
Eric Prydz - Pjanoo

Enjoy!
