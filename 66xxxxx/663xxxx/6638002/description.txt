Being the oldest Blues- and Jazzclub in the Province du Luxembourg, and surely one of the most important (and influential) places-to-play in Belgium, the Ferme Madelonne in Gouvy has seen most, if not all, of the best musicians in Jazz and Blues around the world. From The Duke Ellington Orchestra to Luther Allison, the late Blues Guitar Women to the No-Name local heroes, from Charlie Parker to Stan Webb\'s Chicken Shack - they all have been there. 

Surrounded by a beautiful parc, and hosted by the Druid of Jazz and Blues himself, Claude Lentz (and now his son Benji), they created a magic environment where they sell their own beer, host musicians and invite to their yearly Jazz- and Blues Festival.

In 2000, Bobby Watson recorded this excellent compilation live at the Ferme Madelonne.
Track #5 (Blues for Claude) is dedicated to Claude Lentz, for his lifetime work in hosting and welcoming musicians from around the globe.
