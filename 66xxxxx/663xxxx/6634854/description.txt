         From the prehistoric drawings through the Roswell incident,   
         reports of strange and unexplainable sightings in the skies   
         have become part of an unofficial historic record. With       
         the proliferation of video and photo technology in the        
         modern era, reports of these events--along with visual        
         evidence--have only increased. 95% of UFO sightings           
         are false, resulting either from misidentification            
         or deliberate hoaxes. But the other 5% cannot be              
         dismissed. Based on the newly published book "UFO's:          
         Generals, Pilots and Government Officials Go On the           
         Record," this two-hour special explores sightings that        
         are supported by numerous creditable sources, from Air        
         Force and commercial pilots, FAA officials, investigators,    
         military Generals and NASA officials as well as hard data:    
         photos, film, radar and audio recordings. This evidence       
         presents a startling look at the very real possibility of     
          alien visitation.
