In an intimate acoustic setting, Norton Buffalo and Roy Rogers present a set of original tunes whose flavor suggests roots much further back in time. Aside from a few tasteful string parts, Roots is all about crisp finger-picked and slide guitar, Buffalo's earthy and expressive harmonica, and each artist's agreeably unpolished vocals. This reprises the country ambience of 'R&B' rather than the bluesy vitality of 'Travellin' Tracks'. The interplay of harmonica and acoustic guitar is attractive in a jogalong cowboy-movie style. Their lyrics embrace traditional imagery, from saloon balladry to ramblin' songs. On 'Trinity the words sustain an especially rustic eloquence through multiple verses dedicated to visions of salvation. If retro affectation bothers you, it's best to imagine this session transpiring on some snowy night, with in the glow of an iron stove at some crossroads general store. When heard on these terms, Roots can cast a spell to remember..." by Robert L. Doerschuk
