This is the complete (new discs) 3CD Sounds of the City collection of New York
doo wop from the 50s to be added to our main offerings of the Time
Life 50s music series of CD offerings for you that are already 
previously posted. These are all at 192k 

There being no sense to rap or whatever other that abuses the sensibilities
today - enjoy nice stuff instead for a better familial environment to all

I personally especially like the doo wop in our (new discs) 4cd set posted here
