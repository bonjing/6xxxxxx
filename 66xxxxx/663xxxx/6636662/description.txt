The Mormon Choir brings true joy into our lives with great
spiritually blessed voices that are graced with a true Christianly spirit

Who better to sing to us from the great Musicals, or
lead the nation with Patriotic Music or keep our standards alive
generally speaking.

I am sometimes in tears just thinking of what great Christians
they are that exist South of our border (and up here too now and then
there is an American gal that keeps me from being too homesick).

God bless you for all I have been given in the way of a spiritual gift
by your presence while I was in the evangelical church and since!
