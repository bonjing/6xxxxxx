Amy Winehouse performs a one / off concert featuring songs from her album, Back to Black.

That is one of my favorite concerts, from beginning to end. She looked, and sounded,
so gorgeous and classy. Wonderful smiles, expressions, movements, and interactions
with the audience. Stunning dress. Perfect size venue for her. Great atmosphere.
Wish I had been there.
