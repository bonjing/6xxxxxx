,ninja78,2011-10-07T00:43Z,i downloaded it. installed it. but when i go to change my screen saver it isn't in the list. where do I drag the file or folder so I dont have to manually open the file every time I want to use it? i placed it in the program folder and still nothing. i tried to locate the screen saver folder but nothing shows up.
