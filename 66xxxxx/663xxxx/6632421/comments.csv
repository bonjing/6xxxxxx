The last one...religion, gay sex, look I'm all for that as long as both the chicks are cute with nice tits...I have NO need to check out a couple of dudes kissing and all that non since...I may have to stop watching if this is the direction the show is going to stay in...shit even it out bring on the hot dikes getting it on!

I'm just sayin... :P"

im sorry to inform you that there are actually gay people in the world... obviously you either have an inability to do short skips till the ""scary man love"" is over, 
or your just so intrigued by ""scary man love"" that the rest of the episode just ceases to make sense

I thought that they fired/he left the series,,,,,
Still for me, being gay friendly, this is getting TOO gay for me.
But then again what can we expect from someone that produced  the Queer as Folk series.

,tommygun264,2011-08-27T08:24Z,"Tanx VTV! You're aces!

@pennking - It's my understanding that it was Mr. Davie's decision to pass control of ""Dr. Who"" to Steven Moffatt so he could concentrate on taking ""Torchwood"" in a decidedly darker and more adult direction after it's first season (or series, as they say in the UK) which I think we can all agree he succeeded in doing, stepping up the relationship between Jack and Ianto Jones from suggestive flirtation and remarks that hinted at a sexual relationship to Gwen walking in on the two of them going at it in the Hub after hours. Davies was by all accounts happy & BBC loved the more adult second series, but then Hollywood started calling with offers to let him create an Americanized version of ""Dr. Who"" or ""Torchwood"" the same as had been done with Davies' first hit, ""Queer as Folk"", which required him to go to Hollywood to discuss the possibilities. At the same time John Barrowman wanted more free time to pursue other opportunities that would showcase his singing & dancing and Eve Myles wanted to take other acting gigs as well as a bit more personal time, so Davies negotiated the 5 part ""Children of Earth"" miniseries with BBC."

,k3nd00d,2011-08-27T09:08Z,"P.S. From my experience, straight folk don't mind seeing gay activities of gay folk they are attracted to. Most straight guys don't want to see lesbian activity either if 1 or both females are not attractive to them, just as straight women don't mind gay activity of two guys if they find them attractive. I've been around gay friends that are similarly grossed out by straight sex or displays of intimacy. Tastes are not always/usually equivalent to hatred."
,kercluck,2011-08-27T09:33Z,"The gay scenes are cut from the UK market as they are sick, distasteful and totally irrelevant. As the BBC is funded by a compulsory licence fee - which you can be jailed for not paying - there would be a huge outcry if it were general knowledge that the fee was being used to make gay soft porn.

We've all heard the hue & cry from the gays of the world about how we should be tolerant to their sick perverted lifestyle choices. Perhaps they would like to offer the same level of respect to normal, straight folk who find this kind of thing offensive and sickening.

Clearly it is *not* normal for men to stick their penises into each others anuses, otherwise we would reproduce like it. It is nothing more than a perversion and mental illness."

Look cunt, if you hate gay people so much, why the fuck are you downloading the fourth season of a show made by a gay writer featuring loads of gay characters having loads of gay sex.

You do realise far more intelligent people than yourself, such as every psychological and medical association in the western world, recognize that homosexuality is perfectly normal, not a choice and that sexuality cannot be changed. It would be abnormal if every persons sexuality was the same, but, like everything, sexuality is diverse. Therefore, as homosexuality is just a variation of human sexuality, not something 'sick' or 'perverted'.

There is no rational reason why homosexuality is sick or perverted, other than irrational hate. There is no rational reason why homosexual sex should not be presented on the same terms as heterosexual sex, or indeed homosexual sex involving women.

The BBC license fee does not produce soft-core scenes, but sex scenes. There should be not distinction made between heterosexual or homosexual sex scenes, unless you can demonstrate clear evidence that harm is caused. 

Now kindly fuck off and watch reruns of Bargain Hunt. "

Torchwood: Miracle Day, scenes being edited for the UK, BBC One Publication date: 21 July 2011 Complaint We're received complaints from some viewers unhappy with reports that we have edited out a sex scene from the UK version of Torchwood: Miracle Day. The BBC's response It is not unusual for co-productions to have slightly different versions of a show to reflect its different audiences. For episode three of Torchwood, as part of the usual discussions between broadcasters and the production company, small potential edits in two intercutting scenes of gay and straight sex were discussed and made by production. This minimal edit makes little difference to the episode to be broadcast in the UK. Both scenes remain but run a few seconds shorter than the US version. In a later episode a sequence of gay sex is important to the story and therefore both the US and UK will show the same version. Torchwood continues to be a series that will ask important questions of how we all live in today's society and the drama reflects life as we recognise it. The BBC and Starz have both been huge supporters of the writers' vision for the series.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/content/response/torchwood_scenesedited_jmf

And many people have been assuming the US version was geting some extra edits. LOL

BTW...since the videos have STARZ logos and not BBC...guess which version you're watching.  >_>

The internet is also a really great place to find multilingual people to assist with translation without spending boatloads of money to do so. Just look at the indi game development community, lots of multilingual people assisting with localizations, which is significantly more complex than simple translation. Usually the price is reasonable too, a good reference for their resume if the game hits, or single digit percentage of royalties until a predefined amount is reached.
