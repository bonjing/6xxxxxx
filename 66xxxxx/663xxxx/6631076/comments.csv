,seVIIn,2011-08-26T18:48Z,"Sorry if the quality isn't as good as the other episodes I have uploaded.  As a last resort I decided to do a screen capture off of vh1's web site.  If you want you can watch it there. It will probably be better quality, but you will have to deal with dropouts waiting for it to buffer and a crap load of commercials.  Anyway, like I said this is a screen capture and it's the best I could come by."
,Cruci4,2011-08-26T19:31Z,Thanks seVIIn - appreciate the effort!
,bryentheartist,2011-08-26T20:16Z,yes it does keep dropping (the sound) but whatever
,bryentheartist,2011-08-26T20:26Z,this is unwatchable. it's all out of sound sync and it froze up after 3 mins.
,seVIIn,2011-08-26T21:31Z,"@bryen ah poop my pants, sorry it's not working for you and I agree, the quality sucks.  I'll upload my source vid. If you want you can try that.  It's a larger file (1.51 GB) and it's mpg2. All the best.  Hope it works.  Tested on XBMC, FLV, WMP.  That's all I got.  I hope someone can find a better source."
