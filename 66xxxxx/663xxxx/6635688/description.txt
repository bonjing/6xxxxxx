Richard Elliot (born January 16, 1960) is a Scottish-born saxophone player.

He was a member of the funk band Tower of Power for 5 years during the 1980s. He also worked on Stacy Lattisaw\\\'s 1986 album \\\"Take Me All The Way\\\". His solo career took off when he remade the Percy Sledge classic \\\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\\" (which had also been remade by Michael Bolton). Other well-known songs include \\\"In the Groove,\\\" \\\"Take Your Time,\\\" \\\"Crush,\\\" \\\"Chill Factor,\\\" \\\"Corner Pocket,\\\" and \\\"Sly\\\", as well as remakes of classic pop songs like \\\"I\\\'m Not in Love\\\" and the Luther Vandross hits \\\"Here and Now\\\" and \\\"Your Secret Love.\\\"

Elliot participated with fellow saxophonists Paul Taylor, Gerald Albright and keyboardist Jeff Lorber in the \\\"Grooving for Grover\\\" concert series. The series honored the legacy of the late Grover Washington, Jr., who was a founding father of smooth jazz.
