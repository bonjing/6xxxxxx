Review
"The book is well researched and very accurate, providing the reader with reliable information. ... The Encyclopedia of the Elements is a highly interesting addition to the chemical literature. ... I do not know of any other book that could at this moment be listed as a serious competitor. ... The Encyclopedia of the Elements is a full-sized academic source of reference that will probably rapidly find lots of friends in all fields from (of course) inorganic chemistry, mineralogy and material science but probably among solid-state physics and geochemists, too."
