Each invention is given time to present its use, economic viability, purpose and niche. The inventors are then queried by a panel of three judges, chosen for each program based on their speciality. The judges include agricultural scientist Chris Russell, CSIRO engineer James Bradfield Moody, designer Alison Page, futurist Mark Pesce, science broadcaster and microbiologist Bernie Hobbs, woodworker Richard Vaughan, designer and inventor Sally Dominguez, materials scientist Veena Sahajwalla, journalist and inventor Christine Kininmonth and inventor and plastic surgeon Dr Fiona Wood.[citation needed]

At the end of the show the three judges pick a winner, referencing the six criteria of the show: originality, need, safety, design, market and marketability, and manufacture and pricing.[1] The winner of the episode is then in the running to appear in the annual grand final episode, and be named "Inventor of the Year" and join the ranks of the Hills Hoist and the fax machine in Australia's hall of fame of home-grown inventions. The public can vote by SMS or online for their favourite invention, which is then in the running for an annual People's Choice award.
