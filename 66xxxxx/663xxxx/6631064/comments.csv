,polifonas,2011-08-26T15:38Z,what's difference between normal clone dvd and nordic one ? :D
,montanamb,2011-08-26T15:41Z,Nordic?
,B.Runner,2011-08-26T15:43Z,WTF is going on with comments?

,montanamb,2011-08-26T15:48Z,This comment bug is freaking me out.
,steve30x,2011-08-26T15:57Z,Its not a comment bug. According to the TPB Admins and moerators its an antispam thing. In my opinion its a broken comment system and the mods or admins couldnt be bothered to fix it.
,xXwatchtowerXx,2011-08-26T15:58Z,on sceper . eu   there say there is a release of the game that works with crack so skidrow is gonna be close i hope
,xXwatchtowerXx,2011-08-26T16:01Z,:-) just wanna see the comments

,B.Runner,2011-08-26T16:13Z,It's taking the scene surprisingly long to crack it.

,aangelos,2011-08-26T17:22Z,"This is a Nordic Edition. Retailers sell this at least in Scandinavian countries (saw this in local store today). Info: http://cdon.fi/pelit/deus_ex%3a_human_revolution_-_nordic_edition-12776980
It should contain ""Explosive Mission Pack and Tactical Weapons Pack"""

,Fewmets,2011-08-26T17:30Z,"""the scene"" aka Skidrow has already cracked it. Just nobody's uploaded it yet. "
,Cassius21,2011-08-26T17:31Z,...
,Xenn99,2011-08-26T17:39Z,"@ b.runner
it was already cracked 2 days ago by P2P users..
just no scenegroup has uploaded a good crack of their own yet..

Who cares anyway :P as long as a crack works i dont care where it came from ;-)

(using the clonedvd and Tomek's crack, works for me.)"
,Xenn99,2011-08-26T17:41Z,"@fewmets dont talk bull.

skidrow has NOT released a crack for this game,
the one thats on piratebay and on someplaces on the net is made by someone else..

you can check www.orlydb.com to see when/if they have."
,montanamb,2011-08-26T18:28Z,"@tywdyfor:
Comment bug/broken system/antispam thing,call it whatever you want. If this is really for antispam than this is a epic fail because only thing you get with this is more spams such as ""want to see comments"" etc."
,zidder,2011-08-26T19:26Z,Seed pls
,Darkoil,2011-08-26T20:37Z,"All the people still waiting for a scene release just download the augmented edition ali123 and any of the cracks knocking about and it works perfectly, im about 16 hours in and it hasnt crashed or owt yet."

,zeraqour,2011-08-27T03:12Z,"I can confirm that this work. I just made a account to tell this, never had a reason to have a account before.

BUT it was a shit of hassle to make it work thoo, same as with Chinese version I would guess. I'm 6h into it (is realy hard game if you going stealthy I tell you, but holy mother it is fun). I'm at end to kill that dude that took over a building for a item the company you work for need to deliver. 

I followed comments and got it to work after lots of tries. You need:

1.This edition or guessing the other RUS/Pol/chinese onces, but I think this is more trusted then the others.
2. Do all thoose things with phoenix 1.4 to go behind the need to use steam and make a copy of the Bigfiles.
3. The extra Gamefiles with DFEngine.dll, fmodex.dll and such (is a torrent for it)
4. The Bigfile english (is a torrent for it)
5. A crack. The extra gamefiles have same size as the crack what I could tell. But I had allready tried starting the game before D/L gamefiles and that probably screwed up after copied gamefiles. I had to recopy the crack to get it to start.

Crack I used that worked: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6629943/Deus_Ex-_Human_Revolution_CRACK_by_Sonuyos__amp__TOMEK1166#filelistContainer

Deus Ex English: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6627567/Deus_ex_english_file

Deus Gamefiles: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6629656/Deus_ex_human_revolution_game_files

Using Phoenix and cracking: (credits to Ahetulla with slight changes of wrong words)
1. First mount Deus Ex HR cloneDVD using Daemon Tools.
2. Then you copy the .sid files as well as the .sim, and .sis files to C:\ Ex: C:\Deus test
3. Then you need to install Phoenix 1.4 beta 7.
4. When you run it you have to go to Instruments then go down to where it says Update Content Descriptor and choose Internet.
5. Now in Phoenix 1.4 beta 7 go to Instruments again and select SID Unpacker and a menu should appear.
6. Now you select ... button to the C:\deus test directory or where ever you copied the .sid files in step 2 or where you copied the .sid files if you made up your own directory
7. Now you type in the destination directory C:\Deus Ex HR is what I used.
8. Now you hit the button Scan a Sim-file
9. Then you highlight the dx3.ncf file and hit unpack. (don't worry about the russian and polish.ncf you don't need them)
10. Wait for files to copy
11. Now you copy the bigfile_English.000 to the C:\Deus Ex HR that you created 
12. Copy the Gamefiles into directory and overwrite.
13. Copy the Crack and again overwrite

With this procedure, it worked for me atleast and not a single crash. And I run it on Max settings all over that use to easy give you crashes hehe. Quicksaving works and normal saving and trust me, I have died realy alot and reloaded saves over 40 times now I think :) .

,zeraqour,2011-08-27T03:13Z,"1. First mount Deus Ex HR cloneDVD using Daemon Tools.

can you just say what languages that this has please "
,s33d4weed,2011-08-27T09:31Z,"fuck this game, i give up. this is the only game i've ever had this much trouble cracking. not worth all the effort of sifting through all the bullshit and misinformation. you think motherfuckers would atleast have the curiosity to add detailed instructions."
,zeraqour,2011-08-27T09:57Z,"elturbo9077 that is pretty stupid question. Read the comment and it answer itself. Hint: 1. Nordic Version!! (North EU??)
2. You are told to download a English Language file (Right, english laungage pack Will NOT be in english then??)

.......  Seriosly how more clear can it be??"

,zeraqour,2011-08-27T20:09Z,"@elturbo9077 It doesn't have any language at All because of using phoenix. If you was doing a normal install (with serial key), you would get the required gamefiles from Steam according to what country you live. You can't start the game after used phoenix as it won't have a single language pack unpacked. But I allready pretty clear said what 3 things is required in early post With links even. "
,zeraqour,2011-08-27T20:16Z,Shame if no seeders too as I read another user said. I'm another 7h into the game doing side quests in the city hub and completed a few main quests. No problems at all and no crashes.
