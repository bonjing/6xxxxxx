f.y.i. - i am uploading my torrents from demonoid.
Demonoid supports only HTTP protocol, TPB supports HTTP & UDP.
 

Caution - some of my vids contain warnings about video/audio problems!!! 

it would be easiest to visit my user page, you can view the full 

description and then decide whether you want it or not, my vids 

feature the Dead End Kids.

Once again, there are hardly any pristine copies, but if your a 

fan of the Dead End Kids, you will not mind. I am seeding some of 

the harder to find movies, tv shows.The original source is really 

unknown in many instances and it could be a 3rd generation vhs 

poorly done, to some surprising gems. So just be aware, what i 

think is ok quality might not be your opinion. I do comment if the 

film is seriously degraded in one way or the other.

And if you have a better copy, i sure would love to hear from you.

thanks & enjoy.
