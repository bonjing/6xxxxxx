Welcome to Serve Chilled: Electronic Summer. This release is a return, after a four year hiatus, to the sunny side of Hed Kandi's electronic chill as we bring back one of our most popular and iconic original Hed Kandi themes, for 2011.

Serve Chilled: Electronic Summer is a sublime selection of the finest slow-grooving, laid back, hazy, lazy listening, providing you with the soundtrack to your most sublime summer chilling. This year's edition consists of two CDs championing down-tempo grooves, flirting with Nu Disco, ambient beats, funk and electronic soul from the likes of Beth Ditto, Hercules & Love Affair, Maya Jane Coles, Robert Owens & Coldcut and Aeroplane to name but a few. With our sights firmly fixed on the beginning of summer the emphasis on this release is blue sky blissed-out beats, heavenly vocals and gorgeous grooves.

This up-to-date selection of music is for the more horizontally-inclined music lover and these tracks are the perfect antidote for an afternoon by the poolside, the beach, savouring those beautiful festival sunsets, summer barbeques, the morning after the night before or those seeking sanctuary from four-to-the-floor beats.

Serve Chilled officially marks the arrival of summer here at Hed Kandi HQ and in particular our return to our fabulous Ibiza home of Es Paradis. This will be our 11th Season on the White Isle and this release is guaranteed to be a perfect musical companion for all the Hed Kandi partygoers visiting Ibiza or one of our global summer residencies in 2011.

For now sit back, relax with a Mojito in hand and press play.
