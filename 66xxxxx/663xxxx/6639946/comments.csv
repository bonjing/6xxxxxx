,ItsNotYouItsMe,2011-08-30T21:46Z,"First of all, thanks to the uploader - A/V is very good. 

Being familiar with both sides of this issue over the many years, I was really hoping for a little more depth, considering the BBC's reputation for ""truthiness"". This is a well done documentary in and of itself, but it does nothing to resolve any of the actual questions surrounding the events of September 11th. It is more of a ""my scientific expert can beat up your scientific expert"" sort of thing, and honestly does little to clarify anything at all. As far as I can tell, there seems to be virtually no difference between the experts (or nutballs) on either side - both are supported by scientifically verifiable evidence, and both sides discount any evidence except for that which supports their own personally held beliefs.  That's fine, but it's not science, and quite honestly, neither is this. There is an obvious bias on the part of the filmmakers, which by definition precludes any scientific conclusions. 

What it is, however, is enjoyable and engaging entertainment, which is just as it should be. "
,sonofdog,2011-08-31T22:33Z,"Well said sir, but..Bullshit!

Planes may have crashed and have been hijacked. Alquaeeda (or whatever the drink ) may have been involved, but no way those 3 buildings descend like that unless you have a controlled explosion on at least every 4 floors minimum.

They've had 10 years to come up with a reply and all the money in the world ( which they stole using this lie ). But you can not defie physics.

All evidence on site (filmed 9/01) shows clear cutting of the central supports. They shipped everything to China, now they say they have warehouses - bollocks! "
,sonofdog,2011-08-31T22:38Z,These fucking GOP crapbags are so fucked  up they couldn't even justify the Iraq war by planting the evidence effectively. Now they seem to be hiring those that sell they're souls for a bag of money. So what's new? Even Jesus hated these fuckers!

,nnnslogan,2011-09-22T15:34Z,"Anyone who still thinks 9/11 was controlled demolition after seeing this documentary just isn't living in the real world. They showed perfectly rational explanations for why everything happened the way it did. This essentially eliminates most of the wacky theories that shouldn't have been taken seriously in the first place, many of them being just unexpected but real physical effects.

The real questions any conspiracy theorist should have about the 9/11 attacks aren't in the physics or physical evidence of the attacks themselves. The real questions are in the motivations for the attacks. You won't find any evidence of this in the wreckage and rubble, and armchair conspiracy theorists who collect all their information via the internet do not have any real access to real evidence anyway. Some kid making internet videos isn't entitled to see the black box recordings. It's none of his business. Experts have seen them, believe it or not.

If you don't trust your government or their motivations, do something about that instead of chasing phantoms in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. If you're unhappy with the way the United States of America uses their armed forces to support American corporate interests worldwide, get involved in the political process. The Bush administration was comprised of members of the PNAC, and their stated goals are largely military goals. They stand to make massive profits from military campaigns, and its largely at the cost of American tax dollars and it obviously hurts American security and the image of the United States in the eyes of the world. The only way to stop that is by not backing warmongering politicians and corporations. They didn't have to plant bombs in the World Trade Center to make 9/11 happen. All they had to do was piss off enough middle eastern people by killing their families and friends or funding the killers. Spend more time focusing on the world political and economic situation instead of the details of what was found in the rubble."
,lattari,2012-06-11T18:29Z,Excellent point. There are enough real issues in the world that beg for publics attention. No need to make things up. This may sound harsh to people with emotional ties to the events but the U.S had something like 9/11 coming for a long time. You can't expect to get away with decades of fighting and meddling all around the world without some kind of counter reaction. All powers in the history that have imposed on other nations have suffered similar incidents. The thing to do is to get over it. The whole animosity and subculture you have created around the attacks seem extremely wierd from distance. Most of all it reflects massive double-standards in how you feel you can treat others as opposed to how you expect to be treated.
