,bizoumorte,2011-08-30T09:13Z,"To people having the problem with starting thegame and just having a black screen with just audio, install the directX thing it tells you too after you finish installing the game. The first time round I ignored it and got the problem but after I installed the DirectX it worked perfectly fine :) 

Happy Gaming!"
,bizoumorte,2011-08-30T09:16Z,"To the people having the problem of having just a black screen with only audio, after it finishd installing it askes if you want to install the directX thing. INTALL IT. Solves the problem ^-^ I have the issue as well, and I decided to try getting the DirectX and it fixed it.

Happy Gaming!"

I tried another torrent and I get the same thing :( Anyone got this problem?"

,angolaguy,2012-02-05T21:05Z,"If you see something like ""Failed to write save game to Steam Cloud"", it seems you tried to launch this game without administrative privileges or you haven't access to /Program Files/limbo folder.
Just uninstall and install it again (or move) to users/%username%/optionalfoldername/limbo."
,Mad84,2012-02-09T09:42Z,Trojan found. Beware!
,sneze27,2012-02-12T17:26Z,it's great. thanks!
,bitcometsuperhero,2012-02-12T23:24Z,"ESET found trojan, but game works.."
,biosquid2,2012-02-14T08:23Z,"how come most other releases of limbo on this site such as theta's, for example, are around 70MB but your release is 176MB? i'm not saying your release doesn't work. it's just that theta's release works fine as well, but it's over 100MB less in size..."
,woggyman,2012-02-23T08:26Z,IF your getting a BLACK SCREEN!!!!  try updating your DirectX. i ran this: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=35 worked fine afterwards.
,abdels1100,2012-02-27T22:24Z,Larger then the other files but it has more levels thanks!
,Braleven,2012-03-11T05:23Z,"I'm curious why Bittorrent warns that there is trojan virus. Regardless, the game works fine. EXTREMELY easy installation and I appreciate it. 

I'm gonna check out your other stuff, bud."
,garrison_l,2012-03-15T07:59Z,Thanks 'BONE'
,DarkShive92,2012-03-16T21:10Z,"Most trojans you will ever see in a torrent are false positives. Installers and keygens are usually picked up as viruses due to heuristics, which means that they do things similar to what some viruses do, but are themselves benign. "
,civoniz,2012-03-20T23:39Z,"Legit, props .BONE. and Lewis??? .. nice installer."

,thepiratebayguru,2012-05-20T21:33Z,nice game !!!! thanks
,BigLobo,2012-05-23T03:59Z,It's working and look cleaner.
,xXNeoREXx,2012-06-01T18:29Z,"This game is absolutely amazing, a little bit horrifying at some times - but in a good way!

Downloaders Beware: This game does contain a virus in one of the files, my antivirus had detected it and deleted it so I don't remember the name. But the game still works fine without the virus, so I believe that it was injected into the download and has no connection to the game. (just remember to scan all the folder before playing)"
