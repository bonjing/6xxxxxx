The Flying Club Cup

Beirut's second album, The Flying Club Cup, was recorded largely at a makeshift studio in Albuquerque and completed at Arcade Fire's studio in Quebec. The music on the album has a French influence due to Condon's interest in French chanson during its recording. Condon has cited French and Belgian singers Jacques Brel (French-speaking Belgian), Serge Gainsbourg and Yves Montand (Italian/French) as influences.He also expressed interest in French film and culture, claiming this was his original reason for travelling to Europe.[14] The Flying Club Cup was officially released in October 2007. In September 2007 they did a Take-Away Show acoustic video session shot by Vincent Moon. A DVD, Cheap Magic Inside, was shot but quickly sold out; in December 2010, Beirut, BaDaBing, and Blogotheque authorized its dissemination via digital download.
