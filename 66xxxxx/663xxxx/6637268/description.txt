Praise be Allah, Who has adorned the aspect of man by granting him good stature and proportion, Safeguarding him from increase and decline in his aspect and measurements,
We ask for His forgiveness and guidance,
We seek refuge from the evils, which are in ourselves and the wicked in our actions,
And may the blessings and salutations be invoked upon Muhammad, His Prophet
