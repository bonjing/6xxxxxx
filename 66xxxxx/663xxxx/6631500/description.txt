A spaceship arrives in Arizona, 1873, to take over the Earth, starting with the Wild West region. A posse of cowboys and natives are all that stand in their way. 

Common complaint i seen with TS release, to dark at night scenes, fixed that up, juiced the color, didnt do a whole lot just made it easier to see.
