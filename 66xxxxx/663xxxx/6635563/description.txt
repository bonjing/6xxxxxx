We all know Robert Robinson as the chairman of such broadcasting classics as Ask the Family and Brain of Britain but in a career spanning many decades, he also made travel programmes, Points of View, the Today programme and Stop the Week which ran on Radio 4 from 1974 to 1992. 

In Archive on 4: A Tribute to Robert Robinson, Laurie Taylor takes a look at the life and work of one of Britain's broadcasting legends in the company of some of the former contributors to Stop the Week; Ann Leslie, Matthew Parris, Sarah Harrison and Nick Tucker. There are also contributions from Will Wyatt, Victor Lewis-Smith and Hunter Davis and a wealth of archive that reveals a complex man, a consummate wordsmith and one of the first TV celebrities.

Produced in Manchester by Helen Lee.
