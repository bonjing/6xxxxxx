,ncc46537,2011-08-28T11:07Z,"I for one don't like the file size...
Honestly, people now are spoiled.
I mean, I remember playing Super Mario Bros, and Duck Hunt...
Hell, I loved the games, and still have the NES in my closet."
,The_12th_Doctor,2011-08-28T13:31Z,"Why whinge about the file size? I look for files of this size because not only does it usually mean superb video quality, but it's the best bet for 5.1 audio.
There's plenty of smaller files sizes if you don't want to wait!"
,XOIIO,2011-08-28T17:09Z,"For HD this is the sam siz as it is in iTunes, so this is the correct file size."
,nickly55,2011-08-28T20:15Z,Where's the Futurama S06E24 torrent eztv?
,jaylo101,2011-08-29T05:43Z,"This download seems to be corrupt, i've dl'd it twice to the same effect & i never have any probs playing any format."

The hell are you on?
Correctly enough, the best actor Dr. Who ever had now has been gone for a while, but the script is even better than ever.
There's references and buildups all the way back to the first season being explained, Moffat finally gets some great scripts for himself to act upon and the are more story in a single episode than most other shows dare have in a triple episode.
Unless you have the attention-span of a fly, the show is just getting better and better."
,Archonin,2011-08-31T16:19Z,"*followup to myself*
No idea why the heck I wrote Moffat, I meant of course Smith xD
In my head I was thinking Moffat writing script for Smith to act upon finally ;)
I blame the whiskey!"

Stop using crappy VLC, use MPC and CCCP and it would work."
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-04T05:37Z,After the mid-season finale I didn't think this show could get better - This was AMAZING!!
,jaylo101,2011-09-08T18:47Z,"@Archonin 
I don't use VLC, just MP classic usually with latest K-Lite.
I'm not a noob, i dl & watch hd shows all the time, like True Blood, NCIS, Warehouse 13, The Mentalist etc.
This is the only one that refuses to play."
,jaylo101,2011-09-08T19:33Z,"I've just muxed this file with mkvmerge, after reading a thread about people not being able to play these FoV releases, after 2 minutes i have a perfectly playable hd episode.
Apparently FoV are messing something up in chapters header, episode 9 won't play either without muxing."
,snowolf69,2011-09-12T20:50Z,"~!! CCCP USERS, UPDATE !!~
Anyone having trouble with these FoV 720p releases of Doctor Who, go get the newest CCCP 7-30-2011.
I was using the 9-9-09 pack and it just wouldn't play but this fixed it."
