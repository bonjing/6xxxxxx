,chuckmamuck,2011-08-27T23:38Z,"setdmais
leechers aint greedy mate, they just need to finish leeching it before they can seed.
i know leechers sounds bad but it aint, leechers are in the process of d/ling the files, seeders have finished leeching and have the complete files.
they're only greedy if they disable or heavilly limit their upload speed, leechers are still giving others the parts of the files they have so everybody needs to keep u/l and d/l set to unlimited and all torrents would be rapido.
it'll never happen tho cus the worlds full of selfish cunts.
remember, leechers are in the process of downloading, seeders have the 100% complete files. leechers are still uploading the parts of the files they already have so you can actually complete your download without ever being connected to a seed, it happens alot with fresh torrents before they become healthy. as long as a few peers you're connected to are connected to a seed then you can get the full completed files.
seeds aint as important as many think they are, torrents are comprised of many small parts so you take the parts you need from the peers you're connected to and others take the parts you have for themselves. if everyone kept u/l and d/l set to unlimited then all torrents would be max speed.
its a myth that disabling your u/l speed will make your d/l faster, it doesn't, unless your connection is shite with very little bandwidth available and thats rare with todays broadband. the only people that limit their u/l speed are the ones that have never bothered to understand how torrents work."
,vrocks94,2011-08-27T23:42Z,all those retards who think that this torrent is fake should go and buy a copy of this game........fuckin' assholes don't know how to run the game and are just posting insane comments and confusing others...............the game runs perfectly without any flaw.........cheers to extremezone.......

,Niles,2011-08-28T00:36Z,"chuckmamuck

Been trying to explain that to people for years, they still don't get it. In fact the more ""leechers"" the faster the download will potentially be. I blame TPB for calling it ""leechers"" in the first place, it gives the wrong impression, they are ""peers"". 

At the moment there are 551 seeders and 12587 leechers, that gives a total of 13138 people to download from..yet people are still complaining. 

The protocol is designed to prioritize the least shared segments first, which means the torrent will be evenly distributed among the ""leechers"", so from a downloading perspective it makes absolutely no difference if you are downloading a specific segment from a seeder or a leecher, in fact the more leechers the more likely you are to   download the segment you need fast."

,cptrmjack,2011-08-28T00:50Z,"Quick Education for the new ones out there, it is common courtesy to seed ""atleast"" an ratio of 1.5, 2.0 or greater is preferred. If you can't seed because of geographical issues, use a proxy service, you are useless, and a leech if you don't contribute, go use usenet or something. But than again, if we wanted stricter seed/leach ratios, you gotta go to Demonoid."

,Luckmann,2011-08-28T13:43Z,"It's so fucking disheartening to see this many people seed and leech this shit.

Scene, where art thou? 

I love the scene to bits, but I have no fucking clue what they are doing tbh. It's like they've all been shanghaied by China, or paid off by Eidos.

I know it's wrong to bitch and moan about where the fuck the scene has gone to, but I can't help but to feel somewhat let down. Not so much because I'm not getting my free candy, but because I've come to expect a certain standard of awesomeness from them. :| 

Personally, I'm still waiting for Scene, updates & Collector's Edition. Collector's Edition has -all- the in-game bonuses. How people play games where content has been ripped out to be sold piecemeal bit-by-bit in various pre-orders and editions without feeling ripped off, I have no idea. I just can't do it.

I need the full deal."

Then extract/mount the ISO image. I just extracted the game files to my programs files directory manually(create your own game directory - there's is no install!).

2. Download the replace files: http://filesmelt.com/dl/Deus.Ex_.Human_.Revolution_.Crack-ALI213_.rar copy over and replace files in the game directory you created.

3. Download the crack: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6631263/Deus_Ex._Human_Revolution_CRACK_ONLY_V1.1622.0.rar copy over and replace the game file in the game directory you created.

4. Play the game.

Change the DWORD ""DisableHardwareShadowMaps"" from ""0"" to ""1""

Does anyone have issues with the autosave not working and/or know a way to fix it? As far as i know the game should have autosave.

One of the reason I don't buy things on CDs is because about 45% of the profits go to the publishers that don't do anything and sometimes even wreck the games with their horrible DRMs and online features.

,s2000_77,2011-08-30T21:32Z,"Works fine, thanks extreme :)  

Anyone having problems -

1. Install Daemon tools or a similar image mounting program.

2.  Right click Daemon tools in your system tray, then go to virtual devices, hover over the device (for me its Device 0: [F:]) and click ""mount image""

3.  Go to my computer and open the deus ex installer.

4.  Install to what ever directory you like

5.  Go back to my Computer and browse the deus ex installer.  Copy the contents of the ""Crack"" folder and place in the deus ex game directory.  When the warnings come up, choose to replace the files.

6.  Open the file dxhr.exe in the game directory to play and enjoy.


There is also a patch available now on TPB.  To install the patch just extract the downloaded file to the game directory using winrar or a similar program.  Once again choose to replace when the warnings come up.

Please seed - the last 20% of this game download was ridiculous and if you enjoy this game, buy it! support the developers so we can continue to have sweet games like this one :) Cheers

,mrahmohamed,2011-08-31T08:26Z,"hi Mr orangeguy21 
i see that you need help
ok
let's see if i can make it easy
so first the file size is 6.02 GiB so we need at least 13 GiB free space on your hard drive 6 for the file
and 6 for the extracted file 
if that is ensured then right click on the file and ""Extract to 'shit-dehr.iso'  ""
i did not download this torrent yet
but in most cases you would find an autorun.exe
lunch it and follow the installation wizard
after that you wouldn't be able to lunch it because you need to crack it
that's when you should go to the installation folder it should be in the ""c:\Program Files\"" if you have a x64 based pross the it's in the ""c:\Program Files (x84)"" 
in the folder you extracted there should be a folder named crack , you should copy the file(s) to the installation folder and replace the originals with them ,
(i suppose you have windows 7) if that's the case then you need admin privileges i mean copy the files as an admin otherwise it won't work,
i hope i made it a little easy for you best luck

I have it running now.

I use daemon tools to install software.  It is free and you can install from your hard drive rather than having to burn a dvd or cd.

If poweriso allows you to load an image do so.  Either choose autorun if you are given the option or open the iso and run setup program.   When the install is finished (it will take a while this is a big program) do not have it launch at the end.  

 After install go back to the iso and copy the contents of the crack directory into the directory where you installed the program.  If you did the default install that will be in c:\Program Files(x86)/Square Enix/Deus Ex - Human Revolution/.

Once that is done download the patch mentiioned elsewhere .  here is the link I used
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6635818/Deus.Ex.Human.Revolution_Update_v_1.1.622.0_PROPER

Extract the files in the rar file into

c:\Program Files(x86)/Square Enix/Deus Ex - Human Revolution/.   It will overwrite the files you copied from the crack directory a few minutes ago.   You may be able to skip the copy from the crack directory and just do this step.

As I said above this relaese is working, but I had to add the patch.   Before the patch I got message about needing steam running.   

I am running this on Windows 7 ultimate 64 bit os

Then extract/mount the ISO image. I just extracted the game files to my programs files directory manually(create your own game directory - there's is no install!).

2. Download the replace files: http://filesmelt.com/dl/Deus.Ex_.Human_.Revolution_.Crack-ALI213_.rar copy over and replace files in the game directory you created.

3. Download the crack: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6631263/Deus_Ex._Human_Revolution_CRACK_ONLY_V1.1622.0.rar copy over and replace the game file in the game directory you created.

For anyone having troubles getting there game to work right

1. Download the game from http://tehparadox.com/forum/f43/%5Bfslfsclbslwu-%5Ddeus-ex-human-revolution%5Beng-iso-2011%5D1gb-9dls-2799367/ and extract the Rars(files are interchangeable).

2. Download the replace files: http://filesmelt.com/dl/Deus.Ex_.Human_.Revolution_.Crack-ALI213_.rar copy over and replace files in the game directory you created.

3. Download the crack: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6631263/Deus_Ex._Human_Revolution_CRACK_ONLY_V1.1622.0.rar copy over and replace the game file in the game directory you created.

If you are getting crap download speeds its either A) your isp.  B) your program setup.  C)your hardware.

Many popular large isps actually block and cancel (reset) torrent connections.  Best fix is allow ONLY encrypted connections.  And do not allow incomming legacy connections.   Basically encrypted or piss off.   This will HELP maybe depending on your isp and their blocking method.

The other major problem is many torrent clients try to open a great many # of connections at once.  Windows by default will barf like this.  Along with alot of consumer grade routers, modems, and network cards.

This..  like every other torrent i see ppl whining about speed on..  Maxes out for me at well over 2 MB/second.    It's not the torrent.  It's not the seeders.  

IT IS YOUR PROBLEM 100%.   

Fix it and stop complaining already.  "

you need to get a software called daemon tools. create a virtual drive, load the game and install once you've installed go to my computer and look for the virtual drive you created and in there you'll find the crack file which you can copy and paste into the installation folder of the game...

Either the crack is causing the game to take more resources then it truely needs or if the game is just the badly optimized.  Oh well, I'm done ranting.  The crack works great on my AMD system, Windows 7 64 Bit, which is the point of this torrent.  If anybody has an idea how to get the game to run better then let me know on one of my torrents please.

Thanks extremezone!!!"

This one looks like worth buying since it runs fine on my machine. 

Oh. There may be some walware in this torrent. My virus scanners needed to be be disabled to allow installation because of multiple warnings (avast and comodo). But since is a virtual machine I don't care if is corrupt. 

Not recommend running in real environment since all scanners hate the exe as suspicious. Someone needs to confirm it's clean before recommending running in live install.

Buying it is less risky. but more costly :("

Aside from that, I'm not one to complain too much about the seeding since I'm getting the content for free instead of shelling out $50 out of impatience... however, it seems a little greedy of people when I look at my DL/UL ratio, and the upload speed for this torrent is about twice what it is for my download speed.

Stop using the patches that are in these dumb ass links people are posting, then it might work. Just use the one right under this game in search if you have it sorted by seeds like everyone else that has it working.

2. Right click Daemon tools in your system tray, then go to virtual devices, hover over the device (for me its Device 0: [F:]) and click ""mount image""

3. Go to my computer and open the deus ex installer.

4. Install to what ever directory you like

5. Go back to my Computer and browse the deus ex installer. Copy the contents of the ""Crack"" folder and place in the deus ex game directory. When the warnings come up, choose to replace the files.

6. Open the file dxhr.exe in the game directory to play and enjoy."

,Government10,2012-01-19T21:24Z,"Just an FYI, since i had this problem.

Once you install the game, place the crack, and actually get into the game (somewhat...)

If you get a ""bink"" error that pops up and cant ready it, it basically says the Binkw32.dll is installed incorrectly....  just google the dll file, and place it in the game directory.

Works like a charm."
