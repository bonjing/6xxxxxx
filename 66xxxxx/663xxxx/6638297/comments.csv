Hugely appreciated."
,Uriz3n,2011-08-30T15:39Z,"And uh... about Vol.1? Would that maybe also be possible? 

It's not that I'm complaining, far from it, but these here issues are actually #5-8 of the story. There are four issues before that, Storm Front Vol1 #1-4.
Please?"
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-08-30T15:52Z,I'll try.
,sciroccogti,2011-10-20T16:58Z,Please upload Storm Front 2 and 3. I managed to find 1-2 and these.
