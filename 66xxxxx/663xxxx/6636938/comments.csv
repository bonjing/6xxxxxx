,Holy Divr,2011-08-29T07:46Z,DM where's you re-sized Ella 161??
,tngfan,2011-08-29T08:08Z,"Thanks for sharing as always. But yeah, I kinda agree that this set isn't that exciting. And the preview for next week doesn't look too great, either."
,CainRiZZo,2011-08-29T09:33Z,Thanks webmodelsindex.

,Chisinau_Moldova,2011-08-29T14:49Z,Thank you WMI for your continue great work for us
,captainkhaos1966,2011-08-29T21:32Z,Thanks WMI. I agree with you. This is far from being a good set. I have given up on Sandra and waiting to see what Ella does. Virginia by far is my favorite now. She is the only one that knows what the fans want and is willing to go that direction
,fenderjoe,2011-08-29T23:57Z,"+1 to you for your work wmi, but Ella is the only one left for me. I treasure my older sets of both Ella and Sandra. Virginia is showing more but she needs to lose the creepy Groucho Marx eyebrows."
