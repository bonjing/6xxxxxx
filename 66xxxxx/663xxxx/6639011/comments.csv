[T],trialNerror,2011-08-30T08:05Z,"Look who's talking, frenchfry.

Season 2.  Boosh! lol  I would say you're an idiot, but every time you type something it's proof of it and there's no need for me to say it.

Oh, and I left a comment on that s02e01 known and the unknown saying it was not labeled correctly - surprised nobody else has commented that as well - and that I would release the complete set when available.  

It's now available. Complete set of season 2. 

The PS3 friendly 1080p x264 ac3 version is also available for those that love HD stuff."
,jyanendra,2011-08-30T22:53Z,"Thanks for this great series!
Did Season 2 follow Season 1 in just a few months, by the way?
Keep up the good work.

[T],trialNerror,2011-08-31T06:34Z,"Alright, now I have to say it.  You're a braindead retard, frenchtoast.  And a puss of one as well if you think ""frenchfry"" is racist.

THIS IS SEASON 2 for WONDERS OF THE UNIVERSE!  

NOT WONDERS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM!

You obviously haven't downloaded this and watched it or you would realize that.

I'm flattered you follow me so much, but don't try arguing about something you have no clue what you're talking about.

And if all you have is complaints about my torrents, WHY THE HELL DO YOU CONTINUE TO DOWNLOAD FROM ME?!  HUH?  That's a true wonder of the universe right there."
[T],trialNerror,2011-08-31T14:16Z,"For that dumbass nonbeliever trying to say this is a mislabeled season 1 of Wonders of the Solar System and not season 2 of Wonders of the UNIVERSE, here's some proof.

Title Screen - Wonders of the Universe http://i.imgur.com/4akCu.jpg
Episode 1 - Children of the Stars http://i.imgur.com/XVLJP.jpg
Episode 2 - The Cosmos Made Conscious http://i.imgur.com/EBkbH.jpg
Episode 3 - The Known and the Unknown http://i.imgur.com/aFBVi.jpg
Episode 4 - On Beams of Light http://i.imgur.com/fXgiZ.jpg

Season 1 for Wonders of the Universe is the following: Ep 1 ""Destiny"", Ep 2 ""Stardust"", Ep 3 ""Falling"", and Ep 4 ""Messengers"".

Season 1 for Wonders of the Solar System is 5 episodes: Ep 1 ""Empire of the Sun"", Ep 2 ""Order Out of Chaos"", Ep 3 ""The Thin Blue Line"", Ep 4 ""Dead or Alive"", and Ep 5 ""Aliens"".

Season 1 of Wonders of the Universe has similar intro clips, yes, but if you would have at least watched 2 minutes into the video to see the title screen you would have cleared that brainfart of yours and realized these are NOT the same episodes you saw earlier this year.  These are all recently aired NEW on Science Channel which began at the end of July 2011.

Now, frenchbraid, all you do is bitch, bitch, bitch, but wtf do you ever truly contribute?  Nothing.  Where's YOUR uploads?  Hmm?  Nada. You have no right to talk about anything, anywhere.  So, with that out in the air, if you could be so kind as to STFU and GTFO, we'd all be much happier. 

Thank you."
,ace_silver10,2011-09-03T04:15Z,"Hi trialNerror, Firstly just want to say thanks for all your uploads, your doing a good job.

Im new to torrents (morpheus user a long time ago but thats pretty much it) and im just trying to find out what the difference between this copy of season 2 and the 9gig copy, I notice you do it with just about everything.

I know it is obviously something to do with the quality and im guessing the answer is somewhere in the .HDTV.XviD.MP3-tNe if i only knew how to read it.

Also dont worry about frenchfry... That is the end result when brothers and sisters fuck.

Cheers"
[T],trialNerror,2011-09-04T13:25Z,"Hey, ace.  First off, thank you.

Secondly, you're right, it has to do with quality.  

HDTV.XviD.MP3-tNe means it's recorded from an HDTV source, encoded with the XviD video codec, MP3 audio, and made by tNe (trialNerror).

This 2 gig set is only 624 x 352 resolution @ roughly 1,800 Kbps with a downmixed 2 channel audio track.

The 9.9 gig bundle labeled 1080p.HDTV.x264.AC3 is HDTV source recording, 1920 x 1080 full HD resolution, encoded using the superior x264 video codec @ about 8,000 Kbps, and contains the original 6 channel (5.1) AC3 audio.

These XviD.MP3's look good, but the 1080p set looks stunning. ;)"
,dinanipedro,2011-09-07T12:42Z,"Gr8 work !!

Also an excellent show !!

Season 2 already - fuckin excellent."
,dinanipedro,2011-09-10T16:53Z,"sorry to inform you but this is the same as the bbc season 1 of wonders of the universe, just relaunched on another channel!

good quality though.."
,akajetz,2011-09-14T00:14Z,"@dinanipedro 
it is not season 1, season 1 is called wonders of the SOLAR SYSTEM
this is season 2 which is called wonders of the UNIVERSE"
,dinanipedro,2011-10-01T11:15Z,"@akajetz 

well yeah - however bbc originally run the show as wonders of the universe with brian cox -season 1
wonders of the solar system with brian cox - season 1
plus the bbc version is longer than the american version (in this torrent) of the show at least 15 minutes per episode."
,McSatama,2011-10-18T00:21Z,This is obviously a Fu**up. The season 2 is just re-edited season1 for American market. If you watched season1 you watched all that there is of this show....
[T],trialNerror,2011-11-07T05:06Z,"You guys are fucking idiots, alright?
This is not a rehashed US market version of UK's season 1.  This is NOT the same as Wonders of the Solar System.  I have watched season 1 for Wonders of the Universe AND season 1 for Wonders of the Solar System - THIS IS NEW AND DIFFERENT!  If you would just shut the fuck up and watch an episode of this set before commenting, all of you who say it's the same would realize you are totally fucking wrong.  Stop trying to tell me and others something you know NOTHING about.

I'll try to clarify it again for the brain dead dipshits out there...
Season 1 for Wonders of the Universe is:
Ep 1 ""Destiny""
Ep 2 ""Stardust""
Ep 3 ""Falling""
Ep 4 ""Messengers"".
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonders_of_the_Universe

Season 1 for Wonders of the Solar System is:
Ep 1 ""Empire of the Sun""
Ep 2 ""Order Out of Chaos""
Ep 3 ""The Thin Blue Line""
Ep 4 ""Dead or Alive""
Ep 5 ""Aliens""
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonders_of_the_Solar_System

If Wonders of the Solar System has 5 episodes, how the FUCK can this be a re-release of it when it's only 4?  And how the FUCK can it be just another season 1 of Wonders of the Universe when the episode titles and descriptions are completely different from what you're seeing as the previous year's episodes?  Huh? Huh? Huh?  Bitches. Fuck you fucking idiot fuckers."
[T],trialNerror,2011-11-07T05:28Z,"Some of you dickwads will come back with ""then why isn't season 2 on wiki?!""  Simple. Wikipedia is the last place anyone should go for TV information.  

This season 2 is listed on the Science Channel website, on IMDb, and on the futon critic.

Check out this link: http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/07/06/brian-cox-returns-to-science-for-the-second-installment-of-the-peabody-award-winning-franchise-wonders-of-the-universe-644315/20110706science01/  See how it reads ""second installment of... wonders of the universe""?  Sounds like season 2, right? I'd say so.

This is a legit release of Wonders of the Universe Season 2.

Seriously now, all you neigh sayers, fuck off."
[T],trialNerror,2011-11-07T05:35Z,"One more thing I have to clarify cuz I know some of you shitheads will bring it up... 

Wonders of the Solar System is the original series that aired in Fall of 2010.

Next came Wonders of the Universe at the start of 2011.

This came out at the end of Summer in 2011.

This is the real deal.  If you are a fan of the series and think it's not real and aren't going to download it, well then you my non-friend are really missing out."
[T],trialNerror,2011-11-09T10:34Z,"P/S:  In regards to episode length; 44 minutes season 2 episodes Vs. the 55 minutes of the season 1 BRRip episodes; DUH!!!  There's always some extra footage on DVD/BluRay compared to network broadcast.  Jesus.  Some real airheads around here.

I would seriously like it if you folks (*ahem* dinanapedro and McSatama *ahem*) were to watch episode 1 for Wonders of the Solar System, then watch episode 1 for Wonders of the Universe, and lastly watch the first episode of this set.  If you come back saying this is a repeat of either of those first two series then you are a lying sonofabitch that should have their peckers (or tits) put in a meat grinder.

Hey, it just occurred to me - maybe season 2 never aired in UK!  Maybe it was a US broadcast only.

Could have been.  Whatever the case is, stop saying this is a repeat of season 1 of anything when this is absolutely a second installment; continuation; a season 2."
,yogosan,2011-12-08T06:44Z,"all the episodes in this are the same as season one, destiny, falling, stardust and messengers are the exact same as these. i'v seen season 1 a few times and it's definitely the same. "
,ClipperCigars,2012-01-03T20:28Z,"@ trialNerror: Read this really carefully....

""Children of the Stars"" (s2e1) is the renamed US broadcast version of ""Stardust"" (s1e2).

""The Cosmos Made Conscious"" (s2e2) is the renamed US broadcast version of ""Destiny"" (s1e1)

""The Known and The Unknown"" (s2e3) is the renamed US broadcast version of ""Falling"" (s1e3)

""On Beams of Light"" (s2e4) is the renamed US broadcast version of ""Messengers"" (s1e4).


There is NO season 2 of this show.

If you had bothered to actually READ the Futon Critic link you posted really close, you would have seen they call Wonders of the Solar System the first season of the ""wonders of"" series, and Wonders of the Universe the second season. Hell, just read the show descriptions between season 1 and your so-called season 2, and you see they are the same.

Further, the length difference you refer too has nothing to do with being BRRip vs broadcast. It has to do with British vs US television.  US television shortens shows to fit into a 1hr time slot with commercials. British TV does not. British TV caps are full length, just like on the dvd's. It's only US releases of the discs that boast ""extra footage"" which is nothing but the original unedited BBC versions of the shows.

If your going to go off on people and act like an arrogant full of yourself asshole, at least know what you are talking about and be right. Otherwise, you just make yourself out to be the asshole you obviously are. "
