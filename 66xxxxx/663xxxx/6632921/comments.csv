,touch99,2011-08-27T15:01Z,"''QUALITY: 320kbps CBR (highest) ITUNESRIP''

iTunes provides 256kbps m4a-files , so i assume this is a transcode?"
[T],theLEAK,2011-08-27T15:25Z,"@AGiX-HD


It's not that... He's saying that we stole it from his blog when it fact it was purchased from iTunes."
,SoftWarez,2011-08-27T15:49Z,"no, its encoding..

mp3 256kbps to 320kbps CBR is transcode.

m4a 256k to 320k cbr is not transcode."
,SoftWarez,2011-08-27T15:50Z,"theLEAK wtf??

Its my purchased, and I psoted it to my blog."
,SoftWarez,2011-08-27T15:59Z,.......
,touch99,2011-08-27T18:22Z,"Transcoding means converting a file from one encoding method (i.e. file format) to another. Transcoding can be performed from lossless to lossless, lossless to lossy, lossy to lossy, and lossy to lossless.

Here you did a lossy to lossy, because the iTunes 256kbps m4a-file is a lossy version not a lossless, otherwise it would be an ALAC-file or AIFF-file like Apple prefers."
[T],theLEAK,2011-08-27T23:40Z,"@SoftWarez

The one you posted in your so called blog is very different to http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6631894/David_Guetta_-_Nothing_But_The_Beat_%28International_Edition%29_iTun

How? 


Your version:

1) Track 01, 02, 06, 09, 10 and 11 are EXPLICIT

02. You have the purchased account and Account Name field

03. Kind: Purchased AAC audio file



theLEAK's version:

01. All songs have the EXPLICIT tags
02. DRM and FairPlay is removed"

,ltamake,2011-08-28T00:29Z,"Dot dot dot...

Can we all just shut up and listen to this album? kthx. :D"
,free4seed1996,2011-08-28T06:31Z,"HAHA!!
@theLEAK - SHUT THE F**K UP AND GO TAKE YOUR NEW ASS BROUGHT!! :p LOL
@Softwarez - I SUPPORT YOU AND I KNOW YOU ARE LEGAL!!"
,SoftWarez,2011-08-28T06:54Z,Thanks ;)
,skillet92,2011-08-28T07:42Z,"Pls do this song!

Swizz Beatz â International Party (feat. Alicia Keys)"
,SoftWarez,2011-08-28T09:11Z,sure
,SoftWarez,2011-08-28T09:17Z,"@theLEAK about these proofs, tags, u put them by urself... and btw... 2nd disc has no explicit lyrics, so fuck you for lieing people and have a nice day. my version still better, craphead."
[T],theLEAK,2011-08-28T11:52Z,"""my version still better""
WTF? Both this and http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6631894/David_Guetta_-_Nothing_But_The_Beat_%28International_Edition%29_iTun are from the German iTunes Store. The difference is that we upped this album before you.


We're capable of putting back on the EXPLICIT tags after DRM and FairPlay is removed. Can you? Oh wait... you can't

Also you spelt lying wrong and no we were not lying. Do you want an album to have missing tags eh? No of course not that's why we tagged them.

You keep saying we stole it from your blog yet we have given source and evidence why our version is different. Don't accuse another uploader."
,SoftWarez,2011-08-28T13:03Z,"disc 2 is not explicit, this is the spot where so called ""WE"" is lying. (: Now get lost and dont come back! o-wait, u sure come back and start bitching about that this is dupe, fuckign jealous noob."
[T],theLEAK,2011-08-28T13:57Z,"""fuckign jealous noob. ""
The irony in that. You're calling other uploaders jealous when in fact you're jealous yourself. 

Examples:

1) http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6628222/Lil_Wayne_-_Tha_Carter_IV_%282011%29_%5BtheLEAK%5D

Promoting your torrents. WTF

2) http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6628212/Lil.Wayne-Tha.Carter.IV-%28Deluxe.Edition%29-2011-%5BNoFS%5D

They already said ""IF YOU DO NOT LIKE... DONT DOWNLOAD ...
Disrespect List:...  
"" you bother comment?


""disc 2 is not explicit""
That's because you don't know how to tag iTunes Edition. "
,SoftWarez,2011-08-28T14:16Z,"lol... wow, u must be a kid.

NoFS = upconverts grouprips/leaks

And i didnt promote my torrents, cause I didnt give ANY links, so go fuck ruself 12 years old."
,SoftWarez,2011-08-28T14:17Z,"And weird thing is that, you promoted ur own torrent aswell, bitch.

""Trusted theLEAK at 2011-08-27 10:36 CET:

,SoftWarez,2011-08-28T14:33Z,.............
[T],theLEAK,2011-08-28T19:04Z,"""wow, u must be a kid.""
Another irony.

Example: http://www.kat.ph/david-guetta-nothing-but-the-beat-international-edition-itun-t5778106.html

You deliberately thumbs down the torrent. How immature can you be? Don't answer, it's rhetorical. 



""And weird thing is that, you promoted ur own torrent aswell, bitch""

We didn't post a comment saying ""download this followed by a link"". Instead, we said ""This is already been uploaded"". There's a difference.
