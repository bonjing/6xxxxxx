,Maximis,2011-08-29T10:10Z,@ raindr0ps. You can download a DRM removal program off the net. (just do a Google search)
,raindr0ps,2011-08-29T21:21Z,"If it is so easy, couldn't you convert it and save all your downloaders having to re-invent the wheel?
It would make more sense for one person to do the job than 30, 40 or 50 people having to do the job over and over, right?"
,Maximis,2011-09-07T12:18Z,Thanks for the feedback. Will convert next time.
,raindr0ps,2011-11-19T19:43Z,THANK YOU!!
