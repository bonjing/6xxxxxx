75 Top 10 hits from the Late 50s as compiled onto 4CDs by Readers Digest Music

These folks always had great quality music offerings, however they were often
priced out of reach to many folks who didn't want to get in on a sweepstakes
equally each time they wanted to make a mail order purchase of a set of CDs

The folks at Readers Digest could yet catch on I suppose. Oh well, in any event
we thing the industry should be taxed out of these old recordings as "time
expired" for trying to cash in on them any further.

they are here for you at 160k bitrate to balance needs - although I must
say there are some real nice hits here, while a lot of the stuff will
mainly appeal if you are completely into the music from this era and could never
have enough. Please share if this is so!
