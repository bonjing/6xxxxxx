25 Aug 2011



This latest patch addresses:

- A frequent issue for AMD/ATI hardware users that can cause the game to crash on startup.
- Improvements to loading speed. The speed increase depends on machine specs and settings, but loading time improvements of over 50% have been measured on some machines.



Some control fixes:

- Diagonal movement is no longer faster as intended.
- Adjustments have been made to mouse sensitivity in response to user feedback.
- Mouse sensitivity for X and Y axis can still be configured separately, but is now consistent when set to default settings.
- 

The range of settings for mouse sensitivity has been adjusted to provide for more accurate adjusting.
-The default mouse sensitivity has been altered to be somewhat less sensitive.



Install:



1. Unpack with Winrar or similar program.
2. Then just copy the dxhr.exe file to the main game install directory overwriting the existing  one with this new updated version.
3. 

Enjoy the update and game!
