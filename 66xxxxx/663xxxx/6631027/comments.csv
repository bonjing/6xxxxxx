It's all in the picture, man
Were you too lazy to view it ?"
,maggot_corpse,2011-08-26T21:38Z,"i'm not lazy, but when it comes to downloading something, every second and user's effort counts. i don't want to copy and past the link (the releaser could have deleted the tag, or he is too lazy?). so i like all the info in front of my eyes on the opening of the torrent thread. BOZX wins"
