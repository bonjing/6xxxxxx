Colin Murray is joined by Alan Hansen and Lee Dixon for highlights of the day's four Premier League matches, 
including Manchester United against Arsenal and Tottenham versus Manchester City. Champions United twice 
beat Arsenal at Old Trafford last season, in the league and FA Cup, and have strengthened their squad in the 
summer with the big-money additions of David de Gea, Ashley Young and Phil Jones. By contrast, Arsenal 
endured a turbulent off-season, with the futures of unsettled pair Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri dominating 
the headlines. However, the Gunners deservedly beat United when they last met in May. Tottenham are unbeaten 
at home to Manchester City since 2003, but were usurped in the top four by Roberto Mancini's side last season. 
Ambitious City have again spent big this summer as they seek to win the league title. There are also highlights 
from the Hawthorns, where West Brom take on Stoke, and action from St James' Park, the venue for Newcastle's 
match against Fulham.
