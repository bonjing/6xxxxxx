,firetwuck,2011-08-28T17:38Z,"Worked perfectly.  Ran it on a machine with Lion installed and it ""converted"" it to Lion Server.  Server is basically a big app now.  A++"

,Neeliosis,2011-09-06T22:50Z,It's not an OS. It's a program. 
,djdarkstar,2011-10-17T00:29Z,"D3V1S1,

OS X is based off of Unix (BSD), unix is a powerful server platform, severs run daemons and services for a variety of things, like running web pages, hosting SQL databases, running DNS, File Servers, FTP, Authentication, LDAP (lightweight Directory) in Apples case it's Open Directory, etc. 

And much like Drumheadz said, if you don't know you don't need it, but to expand on that answer further, understand that those aforementioned services take up resources, and you'll probably endup taking processing power away by having services running in the background that you know nothing about or why they are running. 

But like many here, if you want to download and play with it, that's entirely up to you. Hell, you might learn a few things and find that you want to be a server engineer."
