,outerbark,2011-08-26T18:42Z,"Yeah, the length is correct. ItÂ´s twice as long but just as funny."
,chandlerboy,2011-08-26T22:09Z,"Ugh, retarded uploading a torrent of RARed files. Nice job making things so much more annoying for everyone. Morons."

quit bitching and be gratefull, people go through the trouble of serving you free entertainment tonight..!!"
,xenoFLASH,2011-08-27T15:58Z,best. episode. ever.
,cl0ckwerk,2011-08-30T07:17Z,"@mrtijn it is nice that they go through the trouble to do that, but the problem is this: when the uploader RARs the files, you have to unrar them to watch the video. not so inconvenient except that once somebody has downloaded the file, they won't want all the .RAR files AND the .avi or whatever it is, so they delete the .RAR files and therefore don't seed, making it take longer to dl. the other issue is that it requires more HD space to download a RAR'd file because you need both enough space for the .RARs and the file itself. in conclusion: RAR'd videos take longer to download and take up more HD space. there is no advantage. everyone please stop RARing videos."

Then don't download it. Idiot!"
,weirun,2011-09-01T04:55Z,good work:)
,robidew,2011-09-06T07:49Z,"I hate people that 'rar' files on the internet.  It's the year 2000 and 11 and everyone has high speed.  If there is anyone with dial-up they aren't downloading videos from piratesbay.  A 1TB hard drive costs peanuts now.  What is the reason?  I ask and ask and no one tells me, so after I watch this episode I am going to blow my brains out of the back of my skull."
