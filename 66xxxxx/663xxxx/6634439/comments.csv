 is this ""how to"" master class? those are so boring to watch. :)"
,XaltedSmoke,2011-08-28T03:13Z,"Yeah it is a master class ep, but its actually pretty good so far.

Other than checking the file, I'm just now sitting down to watch it myself."
,bryentheartist,2011-08-28T03:47Z,thanks baby boi some of the how to classes can drag on.
,XaltedSmoke,2011-08-28T04:16Z,"All too true, all too true... 

But there is some pretty sweet eye candy in this one.  They usually try to balance the M/C stuff with a nice tour."
