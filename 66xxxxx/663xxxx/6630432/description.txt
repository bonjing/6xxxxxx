eTextbook of "Engineering Mechanics, Statics, 6th Edition, SI Version" by J. L. Meriam and L. G. Kraige.

----- CHAPTERS 6 AND 7 ARE MISSING -----

Chapters: 1. Intro to Statics  2. Force Systems  3. Equilibrium  4. Structures  5. Distributed Forces  6. Friction  7. Virtual Work.  Fortunately, chapters 6 & 7 of the 5th and 6th editions are virtually identical, differing only by three photos and the problem sets. (That's what new editions are for...) The following compromise can then be made:

* Chapters 1 to 5: 6th Edition, SI Version (c2008)
    [Meriam_Statics_ch01-05_6thSI_txtbk.pdf , 15 MB , native PDF]

* Chapters 6 to 7: 5th Edition, US&SI Version (c2002) + problem sets of 6th SI
    [Meriam_Statics_ch06-07_5th_txtbk.pdf , 47 MB , scanned PDF]

Both files packed in the same 7-Zip archive (15% lossless compression).

Once your download has finished, _please_ seed this torrent as often and for as long as you possibly can.
