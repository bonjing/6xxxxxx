Well at 26 GB it's obviously not going to be able to fit on a BD-25 disc... So that would mean one thing.

Besides, the format is in .MKV. You'll need to build it into a disc image if you want to burn it.

Thanks for the upload. I can expect the usual excellence from HDRemuX."

,bloodred125,2011-10-11T05:22Z,with it being 26 Gb's it would be cheaper for me to go and BUY this movie than download it lol.
