Time Life Music is always most discerning in bringing us only the best of music
- however on this Patriotic CD they fail to come through as well since the
performances are from American Armed Forces Bands performers that sound too often
like vocalists George Bush picked to sound like he does - or his accountant perhaps.

Why not use Mormon Choir Talent instead - or pay Leann Rimes a million
for her greatest "God Bless America" rendition equally? Anyways for those that
simply must have all this stuff in their library anyways, we bring you
the complete CD with bonus tracks we threw in to make it truly worthwhile
a Patriotic offering after all!

Includes a bag-pipes selection along the way that seems intended to grate on
the senses more than anything else - oh well!

God bless America - where the best of gals are to be found - yet today!
