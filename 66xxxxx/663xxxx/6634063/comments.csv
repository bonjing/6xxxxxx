,mark.taiwan,2011-08-27T21:38Z,I think I'll wait for the un-rared version
[T],ct420,2011-08-27T21:42Z,"I think I will DL and watch this now while others wait for the unrar version  ;)

Thanks sceneline!"
,Green-Banana,2011-08-27T21:49Z,Stop uploading archived files.  
,Revolver31,2011-08-27T22:08Z,why lol
,turdist,2011-08-27T22:17Z,"it's so funny reading comments from people complaining about rars, thinking they know-it-all, and implying the uploader is an idiot..

.. when it's actually them that are totally clueless and oblivious to how the scene works
"
,SomeScottishGuy,2011-08-27T22:29Z,"Quite a long wait between episode 7 and 8 but bloody hell it was definitely worth the wait. Such a good episode. 

@Green-Banana - Sceneline will not stop with the rar'd uploads. The most recent official standards regarding 720p TV uploads state that releases must be in rar format. Search Google for ""720p release standards"" if you don't believe me.  "
,cipherpunks,2011-08-27T22:31Z,why no rar? because RAR DOESN'T SAVE ANY SPACE. the video files are already compressed. rar won't save any more space. all it does is make things fucking inconvenient for downloaders. it takes extraf disk space and CPU time to decompress.
,kkbb3000,2011-08-27T22:39Z,"I've been downloading 2 hours and am on 0.0 percent, is my laptop broken?"
,SomeScottishGuy,2011-08-27T22:51Z,"@turdist - My point exactly. I too find it very annoying that people seem completely oblivious to how The Scene works. 

Excellent work from Sceneline."
,wwino37,2011-08-27T23:08Z,"sceneline is the most consistent uploader for 720p files on this site.  Everyone else seems to ignore the HD fans.  Instead of complaining about clicking a button and waiting a minute for it to unrar, how bout being grateful?  "
,kkbb3000,2011-08-27T23:11Z,Still on 0.0 percent yet all my other downloads are going strong? what am I doing wring here? 8)
,zing9001,2011-08-27T23:42Z,"Quit complaining about RARs, VLC and MPC and both play files inside split RARs directly - just drag the rar into the window."
,mark.taiwan,2011-08-28T01:43Z,"Tell me then, what purpose does splitting the files with rar serve other than following 'The Rule'? What's the benefit, compared to it being a single video file? I'm just curious."
,Green-Banana,2011-08-28T01:56Z,"No, archived files could more easily just be virii.  Show us exactly what the file is, and it's at least a step in the right direction, apart from being technologically unnecessary.  "
,lapis2,2011-08-28T02:36Z,i would personaly try to never download anything thats archived for no reason.  dont care what the rules are its stupid and makes the file seem very suspicious.  if thats the scene rules then the scene rules are fucking retarded.
,CommanderMONG,2011-08-28T02:40Z,"Sure rar files dont do anything for the size of the file much these days, but it does make it a damn lot harder for the anti P2P companies hired by film and TV studios to track illegally downloaded files and such."
,lapis2,2011-08-28T02:50Z,wow whould it make the dl harder to track that makes no fucking sense.  more files=more avenues back to the dl-er/ul-er.  pls explain you fucking idiot.
,timotay89,2011-08-28T03:57Z,anyone know where to find the confidential for this one?
,hadronc,2011-08-28T04:15Z,"RARing still compresses files, but it mainly ensures that you don't have to download 1.5GB again if a bit of the download is corrupted when you DL it."
,PiraatBae,2011-08-28T04:21Z,"Honestly, if you don't like it then don't d/l it.  As already stated, sceneline is being compliant with The.720p.x264.TV.Releasing.Standards.2011.  Either inform yourselves before ranting or just go download someone else's torrent.

"" it takes extraf disk space and CPU time to decompress.""

Is your computer a Colecovision by any chance?

*rolls eyes*

Thank you sceneline! ("
,viral_intent,2011-08-28T05:20Z,"I'm loving the complaints about Rar'd files. I'll be busy watching while you complain and wait. It takes me less that a minute to un-rar it and it's just as good as the normal file itself. So thank you Sceneline, good on ya"
,Tinny_pb,2011-08-28T06:14Z,I prefer no-RAR but I don't really give a crap. Thanks Sceneline for a phat release. 
,aigarius,2011-08-28T11:18Z,"The RAR files are an antique from the time when The Scene shared files over IRC direct file transfer robots. Those did not have CRC checks and often had size limits, so the RAR was useful.

If you use Bittorent, RARing a file is completely useless: Bittorent does not care about the size of the files, it automatically runs two overlapping integrity checks as part of the transfer protocol, you can recheck the file to make sure there are no errors and if such are found that small part of the file will be re-downloaded, all bittorent connections are encrypted nowadays, so the ISP can not look into them to see file names anyways, the RARing makes absolutely no difference to movie industry lawyers, there is no technical, legal or social benefit from RARing.

It is just an antique leftover that takes people time, uses more space and looks suspiciously like the the creator of the torrent has no idea what he is doing."
,nyder,2011-08-28T23:26Z,"Weird.

This won't play on my computer that I have connected up to my TV.   The same computer I've been watching all the releases on and never had a problem before.  In fact, it's the computer I use to convert video into other formats.

But it will play on my gaming computer, so go figure.   fucking computer & settings.

thanks sceneline, i luv ya (no homo).
"
,nyder,2011-08-28T23:33Z,"@aigarius, your a stupid idiot aren't you?

what, you trying to provide fake info to make your self seem like you've been around?

Rar files didn't not start because of IRC, they started because of USENET.

USENET has been around longer then IRC, I remember when IRC started to become popular in the late 80's, after usenet has been around almost most the 80's.

And back then, the archives were split into 1.4mb sections, with each piece fitting on a floppy disk.

Ya, archives were divided so they could fit on floppy disks.

Usenet is why today, the big files are split into archives, so it's easier to make PAR files of the archives, so people don't have to request the actually pieces they are missing, they can get get the same amount of par files to fix it.

That carries over today because most the people doing the releases get them from, or use USENET to distribute them also.

So next time you think you want to rewrite history to fit how you think it should be, don't.  There is always peeps like me who actually have been on the internet since the early 80's."
,nyder,2011-08-28T23:45Z,"@aigarius

You don't know what you are talking about at all.

Here's some internet history, since your probably like 12 and have no idea.

USENET was made in the early 80's.  Not very long after, peeps figured we could use it to send ""binaries"", namely, converting programs so we could post them on USENET to share.

In the late 80's, IRC was made, and it also was able to be used to share files.

But back then, programs were split up into 1.4mb pieces, so each could fit on a floppy disk.
Ya, because back then we didn't have CD burners, and other things, and floppy disks was how we installed crap on our machines.

As CD based games became popular in the mid 90's, and harddrives became bigger, the scene changed.

So the reason why they put big files into junks because you didn't always get good downloads and this made it easier to redownload the pieces you are missing.   Then someone made the PAR files, and it because a ton easier to fix broken archives using PAR chunks.

So fast forward to today, and we have P2P programs and what not.    But USENET is still a popular way to move files around, and that is why a lot of releases have split archive files, because they are putting them, or getting them off usenet also.

So quit fucking complaining, and if you dont' like it, start releasing non rar scene releases yourself.

And don't pretend to know internet history when you don't.  Some of use actually have been on the internet since the 80's."
,PiraatBae,2011-08-29T06:31Z,"@aigarius Your dubious knowledge of Internet history aside, if you had seen my post and another person's post,  The.720p.x264.TV.Releasing.Standards.2011 specifically state:

""Releases must be packed in RAR file format.""

Now, that being said he does not provide an NFO file or sample folder which are also required, nor does he adhere to the RAR size restriction.  But, since he uses the required naming format it would appear that sceneline is utilizing the 2011 Standards to a certain degree.

And again, if people don't like it d/l someone else's torrent.  Problem solved."
