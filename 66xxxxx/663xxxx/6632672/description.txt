ANOTHER FINE RELEASE

    Release: AI Roboform Enterprise v7.4.2.0 (c) 2011 Siber Systems

    Date: 08/26/2011

    Cracked By: Twisted EndZ

INSTALLATION NOTES 

Install AiRoboForm-Enterprise.exe.After installation make
        sure all Internet Explorer and/or other browsers and explorer
        windows are closed or else the file will not copy over properly
        (as well as the Roboform Taskbar Icon).  Reboot into safe mode if
        you still have problems.  Copy roboform.dll into AI Roboform\'s
        installed folder, making sure to overwrite the existing file.  AI
        Roboform is now in the full PRO version with Enterprise features.
 
        Included is the Enterprise policies tool with this release so you
        don\'t need to request it from the homepage.  Its located in the
        PolicyEditor folder.
 
        Feel free to use the online sync feature, it does work fine when
        you run the setup.  Also make sure to set it up later or a
        taskbar notification will let you know once.  This is also known
        as RoboForm Everywhere which is fully functional in this release.
        Its suggested to use a different RoboForm Everywhere password
        than your master password.  This way nobody will be able to
        decrypt your online database except you.

        Note that you can now choose either Everywhere or Desktop type of
        installation while first installing AI Roboform.  You can also
        tell which type of configuration its currently set at by opening
        the About window.  Everywhere will show Sync With [USERNAME],
        while Desktop will not show Sync.  This can be changed at any
        time by going into Options then User Data and clicking on
        Settings button.
 
        Thats it!  Enjoy.
