,PlaidFlannelShirt,2011-08-29T03:24Z,"Very cool! Thank you so much for this! I've actually been comparing my list of Rifftrax shorts against the list of them on Wikipedia, and I have 147 of them now with the ones from this torrent, but I still seem to still be missing ""Unto The Least of These"". I'll see if I have any other holes in my collection that I can see. In the meantime, does anyone have the riff of ""Unto The Least of These""?"
,PlaidFlannelShirt,2011-08-29T03:40Z,"Okay, I checked my collection again, the Rifftrax shorts list on Wikipedia, and your other torrent's comments, and I figured out that I also need ""What About Juvenile Delinquency?"" I thought I already had a copy of it, but it turns out I was mistaken, as I was confusing the MST3K version of it for this one. Any chance of making another supplementary torrent with that one and ""Unto The Least Of These""? :D"

,PlaidFlannelShirt,2011-08-29T13:24Z,"I was able to get The Case of Tommy Tucker Part 2 from this torrent I found while looking around a couple days ago. http://www.torrents.net/torrent/1732037/RiffTrax---Shorts/ If anyone knows where I could find ""Unto The Least of These"" and the juvenile delinquency one, please let me know. Thanks!"
,AbbeySomeone,2011-08-29T17:16Z,Both Unto the Least of These and Case of Tommy Tucker (2) are available via usenet from user leepete.  Search for just those (without typing Rifftrax) at binsearch.org.
