Thanks for the upload neon ;) 

Any word on a new upload for Hanna? The Release-Lounge version you uploaded a few weeks ago suffers from any audio problem that other downloaders have noted as well."

[V],neon,2011-08-30T09:20Z,the previous release had 3 scenes that didnt have subs so heres a new rip with new subtitles....all thanks to Release-Lounge team :)
