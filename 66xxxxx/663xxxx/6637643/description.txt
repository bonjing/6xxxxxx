Storyine: Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-MEN.

Release Notes: Due to the first releases having messed up subs, it was decided to redo this movie from disc with the correct subs hand sorted by us, rather than rely on other sources for bad subs. we apologise to anyone that downloaded the previous release, but you can be rest assured that the person responsible has been shot and their body defiled .... multiple times. Pictures are available for a price lol.
