,skillet92,2011-08-31T05:49Z,"I am waiting so badly for your Star Wars Rip! :)
U downloading the 15gb Episode 4-6 right?"
[T],Zeberzee,2011-08-31T09:29Z,@skillet92...its 18.75 GB 720p  ...im at 45% so far :)
,SaXXena,2011-08-31T10:50Z,"@zeberzee: 

okay mate plz do it in the future... i'll wait for your superb rip....."
,skillet92,2011-09-01T07:04Z,"cant wait for your star wars release...acc. to me instead of releasing each movie in 1gb...u can use the same audio and video bitrate and the size wont matter!
like keep the video bitrate at around 1000kbps and audio at around 127-160 kbps!

wat say?"
[T],Zeberzee,2011-09-01T11:26Z,"@skillet..thats sort of my plan too :) 

....star wars trilogy downloading kinda slow...im at 71% :("
,skillet92,2011-09-01T14:45Z,oh...no probs man...we all can wait! :)
,daysofheaven,2011-09-03T00:02Z,"Hey Zeberzee, can you still do Caddyshack that was on your list? I can't wait to watch this classic. Also, I second the suggestion of Days of Heaven, one of Mallick's masterpieces. Please do both in 720p. You rock! "
[T],Zeberzee,2011-09-03T11:51Z,yep still gonna do caddyshack and  Days of Heaven both 720p ...after the star wars trilogy which im working on right now :)...star wars 1977 will hopefully be up tomorrow...1.1GB 720p with hardcoded subs for alien speaking parts :)
