,ryhed,2011-09-02T03:47Z,"legit, good quality. need winrar to open it but it's not that big of deal, it's 100% real"
,Chadly,2011-09-07T17:51Z,"I dont understand what the big deal is with RAR files. I litterally press the mouse 4 times and its switched from RAR to AVI. No copying, pasting nothing but 4 simple clicks. Are people really getting so lazy they cant switch a RAR file to AVI using Winrar or a program like it, with 4 clicks of a mouse? If so were all in some serious trouble... If its because of virus's and crap, be smart dont download off non skull uploaders. Very simple people..."
,BryanSwift,2011-09-13T14:06Z,I completely agree with Chadly..
