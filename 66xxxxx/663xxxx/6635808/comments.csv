****IMPORTANT****

You must have REX 2.0 already installed!

You should be able to use the ""upgrade to REX 2.0"" folder. I did not need to do this.

****************

1. Open folder ""upgrade to SP1"" and run as admin. Complete Install.

2. Open folder "" Upgrade to SP2"" and run as admin. Complete install.

3. Open folder ""upgrade to SP3"". Copy the file to you REX installation folder i.e C\program files\Real environment xtreme. Once Copied run as admin and install.

4. Open Folder ""set Up REx overdrive"" Run as admin and install.

5.Open folder ""Overdrive Hotfix"" Copy file and paste into REX installation folder. Run as admin and install.

That is it. No other user requirement. Make sure you do all the settings again in REX and install the new textures!

*****************

Enjoy, and let me know if it works."

Thanks a lot StonedRaider :D"
,StonedRaider88,2011-09-02T15:36Z,"I've seeded over 20 GB of this 4 GB torrent and at least 10 people have completed it/ yet there are no seeders apart from me. 

So if you guys are just a bunch of crappy leachers who get to 100% and then stop and don't seed thats fine. i will simply take the torrent offline. don't complain at me for no seeders and slow DL speed. complain at the selfish retards who just take and don't give back! "
,StonedRaider88,2011-09-02T16:12Z,"*****UPDATE*****

I am no longer seeding this torrent, after 5 people completed it in 10 minutes and not a single one continued to seed, they just hit 100% and went offline straight away. With selfishness like that i am not prepared to waste my whole monthly upload limit to people like that.

So sorry to those who are downloading it, you will be stuck with no seeders at whatever percentage you are at.
**************************************

The pirate community survives only because people who complete a torrent leave it to upload to at least a ratio of 1:1. In this case not a single person hit the 1:1 ratio, and if you expect the uploader to seed to all the leachers, well thats just not going to happen. besides thats just way to slow. 

You can go and find this torrent on the internet like i did. it takes some searching. and then one of you can upload it here.  "

Try updating your trackers next time smart guy."
,thealley,2012-06-03T22:28Z,"Hi, I succedeed up to the installation of SP3, but it's failing during the REX_20OverDrive.exe installation. It nearly finishes extraction, but alas at some time I get the message ""There is a problem with this windows installer package"" and it registers in Windows Event Viewer as error 1722. I followed some suggestions from the web, like removing and re-installing Java, or running the .exe from the REX folder, but to no avail. I also ran the installation from the FSX folder, still to no avail. Do you have any suggestions pls?"
