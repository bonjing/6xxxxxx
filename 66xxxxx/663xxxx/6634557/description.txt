This is a straightforward collection of all publications from The Vampire Temple aka The Temple of the Vampire.

The purpose of this torrent is not to repost for independent credit. I have eliminated the non-english copies, organized the documents in the correct order, and created a complete set. Thus far, the other torrents are missing one or more documents.

The only exception: "The Tome of Dayside Mastery". If anyone has a copy, please upload and post a link to it in the comments for this torrent, or you could email me a copy (see below for email address).


Please do not use the comments below to discuss the validity of The Temple and Their teachings/claims/etc. This is not the place for that.


I am posting this information here because I believe that information should be freely and easily available to everyone seeking it. If you do decide to pursue The Temple's teachings, please do the right thing and become one of their members. Gaining from their effort without joining them is unfair.
