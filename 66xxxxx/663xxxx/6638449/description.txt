The Toys - A Lover\\\\\\\'s Concerto-Attack !

The influence of the Toys is evident when one sees the group listed as
the first \\\\\\\"tribute\\\\\\\" on page 49 of the Supremes four-CD box set on Motown. 
The Supremes\\\\\\\' own \\\\\\\"I Hear a Symphony,\\\\\\\" released October 6, 1965, was a tribute to the tribute,
if you will. It says a lot about the competition as the Toys hit number two on the charts that very week,
pushing the Supremes, Diana Ross, and the production team of Holland/Dozier/Holland to one of their greatest heights.
The re-write of Bach, with its boss production, is a sweeping pop sensation.
And the album\\\\\\\'s 14 tracks play like the Ronettes\\\\\\\' first and only official release,
a magnificent statement of vocal harmony and pretty melodies
