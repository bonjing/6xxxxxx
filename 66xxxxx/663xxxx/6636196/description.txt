The perfect app for either the PokÃ©maniac whoâ€™s gotta catch â€˜em all or the Gen-Y hipster trying to be ironic. It started out as something of a joke app, since the main feature was that it used the Android TTS engine to speak aloud each PokÃ©monâ€™s description, similar to the PokÃ©dex in the TV show. Now itâ€™s more of a full-on strategy guide, with lots of detailed info for PokÃ©mon gamers. Supports generations three through five.
