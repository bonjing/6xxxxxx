As for the movie --Very Cool 3D Effects. Cool movie.   


Anyway, I located some 3D media from the 1950's when they first came out with color television they shot a lot in 3D but had no market for it at that time.  Some of that stuff is surfacing now and Disney's: Working for Peanuts 3D is a good example. 

HamBuster 3D made recently has HANDS DOWN better 3D effect than aaaaanything i have seen so far on the EVO 3D.  It honestly makes avatar looks pixely.  I could NOT believe me eyes, you gotta check that one out!!! Its the only media file that when you go to video it shows that its a 3D movie, like the tag you get when you record a 3d video and then go to your library...if I could find a way to make every movie look like that I will 100% DO EVERYTHING OVER FROM SCRATCH. thats how good it looks.

So as you can see, if you SEED when your not downloading then you get ALL THAT FASTER.  I promise.  Personally I almost never seed anything so who am I to ask, but if every one seeds a couple then we all have a personal library of movies to download fast and free anytime.  Otherwise when I hit #50 its going to be 'survival of the fittest' and someone's favorite is going to disappear. 


I've figured out that if I stop uploading at around 98% for about 8 hours it lets a LOT more people catch up and then once I upload the last 2% within 20 minutes there's about 25-30 seeds which is helping the other 80-150 i've seen.  So if you get 'stuck' at 98% thats why.  It's for the good of all.  That way I can move on to the next movie, half that long list is ready to go right now.
