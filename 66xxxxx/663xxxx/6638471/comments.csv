[T],Shepard76,2011-08-29T21:47Z,Thanks for this! Do you know 3D will look fine using an LG Optimus 3D/ thrill mobile phone. Thanks
[T],Shepard76,2011-08-30T00:09Z,"yes you're right about the optimus 3D :-( but I guess is too late to change it...also my resolution screen is lower (800x480)...
I just downloaded the shorts (hambuster and working for peanuts 3D) from you but I only can watch in 3D the short hambuster (one of the best 3D shorts I have ever seen so far :-) but unfortunately the other one working for peanuts appears on the screen twice...I select 3D option and I see some kind of 3D effect but the twin image keeps there...very weird....do you know why this happens...I tried with different players too....I only see correctly hambuster. Thanks a lot for your outstanding job uploading this. Keep it up ! Thanks"

Audiophile thanks for putting up the movies ill seed for a bit. Dont diss the optimus its a sweet phone and with what they're coming up with in october the ability to make games that arent 3d into 3d its pretty sweet. I'm a die HTC fan but the optimus is a good phone"
