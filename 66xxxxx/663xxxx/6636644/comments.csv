,cannibalvegetarian,2011-08-29T17:29Z,"Back in the DVD-era NORDiC-releases made sense since DVD-format required bitmap subs and subs to me muxed into the streams which basically required reauthoring the whole DVD. In fewer words, the procedure to add text-based subtitles was complicated and time consuming.

Current style of just file containers such as matroska that can hold text-based subtitles, they make absolutely no sense. Or the fact that pretty much every player supports separate subtitle files, and if you really have a player that doesn't, adding them to the container is just a few minutes job.

As anoXmous pointed out, this is falsely tagged as nordic.

This one is 1.4GB more http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6631021/Thor.2011.720p.BluRay.x264-Felony
but you get better audio(448kbps(not allowed by scene standards) AC3 vs. 1509kbps DTS), higher video bitrate(5239 vs. 4661kbps) and a better seeded release. You lose what? The trouble of downloading subs off the internet."
