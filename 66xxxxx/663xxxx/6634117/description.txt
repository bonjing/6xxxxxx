Eddie Taylor  I Feel So Bad 
Recorded: 1972
Released: 1991
Label: Hightone
Format: Mp3 @320 


One of the Chicago guitarist's most satisfying contemporary albums, this 1972 set (first issued on Advent) was cut not in the Windy City, but in L.A. in 1972, with a combo featuring Phillip Walker on second guitar and George Smith on harp. Eddie Taylor was no strict traditionalist; he was as conversant with funk-tinged modern rhythms as with Delta-based styles, and he exhibits both sides of his musical personality on this one...'~~ by Bill Dahl
