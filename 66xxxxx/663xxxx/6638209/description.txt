She looks lively and in great philosophical spirits - she indicates
in an interview segment just before going on to sing that she
isn't a nitpicky type of person - which means she has human beauty in her
spirit as she looks for the right kind of perfection than looking for excuses to nag!
I love you Leann!

PS Her somewhat nicer and mellower live performance at the AOL studios will be
posted separately for you. In addition to the phenomenal awesome clip from the
Coyote Ugly movie disc - that is one breathtaking sight of human beauty - as best
as there could be found on this planet I say!


from oriental station HDTV - some foreign promotional message for her appears
on screen bottom towards the clip end
