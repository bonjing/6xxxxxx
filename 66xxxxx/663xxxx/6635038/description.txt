Cover Up in Oklahoma

The Oklahoma City bombing was in all likelihood a false flag state-sponsored terrorist bomb attack on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995. It was the most destructive act of terrorism on American soil until the September 11, 2001 attacks. The Oklahoma blast claimed 168 lives, including 19 children under the age of 6 and injured more than 680 people. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 buildings within a sixteen-block radius, destroyed or burned 86 cars, and shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings. The bomb was estimated to have caused at least $652 million worth of damage. Extensive rescue efforts were undertaken by local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies in the wake of the bombing, and substantial donations were received from across the country. The Federal Emergency Management Agency activated eleven of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations.

Almost everything you have been told about the Oklahoma City bombing by the corporate controlled media was a lie. Almost everything you know is wrong anyway. Question authority and think for yourself. Maybe you should compare the Oklahoma City bombing to the recent bombing in Oslo. Can you see the similarities? Some people want to be fooled. Truth is so ugly and the government's lies are so comforting. After all who wants to know that he is being ruled by criminals and that democracy never existed? Waking up can be so ugly. Remember Neo in 'The Matrix'? The truth is that you are a mind controlled slave. Maybe the demolition of this building was just a test run for 9-11.
