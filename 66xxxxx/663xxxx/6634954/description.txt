All praise is due to Allah alone, Who decreed death upon every soul and is the only One Who is Eternally Everlasting; may He send salutations and exalt the mention of the seal of all Prophets and Messengers, our Prophet Mohammad, his family and all his companions and those who follow in their footsteps until the Day of Resurrection.
