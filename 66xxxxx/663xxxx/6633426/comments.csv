All your movies quality are 10/10 so why do not you put your name or any other name with the movies file name so they can be easily recognized ??"

to your question ""why do not you put your name or any other name with the movies file name so they can be easily recognized?""

my response is ""my torrents have both NAME and SITE tags, however those tags are automatically removed when i upload my torrents here. if you look at my page of torrents @ heet you'll see the exact same torrents with the mentioned tags.""

to your question ""is there cut and uncut version for this movie or what?""

my response is ""no, the issue is simpler than that: runtime for PAL is shorter than NTSC due to faster framerate (25.000 vs 23.976) and also the credits at the end have been cut after the cast list."" "
