[T],theLEAK,2011-08-28T11:55Z,"""Lol, how am I jealous""

Evidence shows you are. Example http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6628222/Lil_Wayne_-_Tha_Carter_IV_%282011%29_%5BtheLEAK%5D


""And don't start to steal my stuff on my blog.""

You keep saying we stole it from your blog yet we have given source and evidence why our version is different. Don't accuse another uploader. 

The one you posted in your so called blog is very different to http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6631894/David_Guetta_-_Nothing_But_The_Beat_%28International_Edition%29_iTun

How?


Your version:

1) Track 01, 02, 06, 09, 10 and 11 are EXPLICIT

02. You have the purchased account and Account Name field

03. Kind: Purchased AAC audio file



theLEAK's version:

01. All songs have the EXPLICIT tags
02. DRM and FairPlay is removed 


Proof:

1) http://bayimg.com/dAjiAaaDm

2) http://bayimg.com/DajigAADm"

[T],theLEAK,2011-08-28T14:24Z,"@MODERNdayHIPPIE

We can't guarantee it will be uploaded. 
Not because we can't do it but because the artist itself is not yet known and therefore it will lack seeders. "
[T],L3G3ND,2011-08-29T08:21Z,"@SoftWarez
Then why do you upload it to +premieres(a.k.a Your Blog).....
If it means stealing.......

and why had'nt you uploaded your material and snitched the CR's RIP.

& theLEAK I know the secret.........."
[T],theLEAK,2011-08-30T15:37Z,"Go to google and search ""David Guetta - Nothing But The Beat (International Edition) iTun"".

Result: This is at the top of the list than iTunes itself. :P"
