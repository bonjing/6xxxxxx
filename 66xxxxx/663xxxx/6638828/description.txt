So I've discovered this style a few hours ago, I'm a hardcore-Frenchcore guy myself, 

so here are 8 volumes of J-core Masterz in mp3. 

A little too much happy or terror sometimes, but all around, cool cds to have 

(well, if you're open-minded). 

Seen ya in Tokyo punks!



THANK YOU FOR SEEDING AS LONG AS YOU CAN.
