As many of you know some movies are watermarked using CINAVIA protection and are
unplayable on PS3s, or any DVD player that uses the CINAVIA protection code. With the
release of the CINAVIA disable tools and Custom Firmware's coming pre-equipped with
these files using the MFW builder, team Rebug (the one's that brought you all those nifty
applications and great custom firmware) have now come up with yet another great release.
