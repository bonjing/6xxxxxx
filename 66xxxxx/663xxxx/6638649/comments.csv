,mondo,2011-08-30T10:16Z,"Is this the same file as: 
""Xenoblade Chronicles PAL DVD5 4.5gb.iso""?"
,drbookworm,2011-08-30T10:32Z,"4.38 gigs, what's the catch?
Vs. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6620153/Xenoblade_Chronicles_%282011%29_%5BWii%5D%5BPAL%5D%5BMULTi6%5D ??"
,mondo,2011-08-30T10:42Z,"Yes it was.. I´ll jump in and seed. 
UL @ 11.2mb/s at the moment.. ;)

Anyone who get this to work at a PAL Wii with Wiikey 1? 
I just get a black screen with a error message telling me to eject the disc and re-boot the machine.. :/"
,mondo,2011-08-30T10:46Z,"The uploader of the original torrent with the file called ""Xenoblade Chronicles PAL DVD5 4.5gb.iso"" (which is the same file) has made some comments in the other Xenoblade torrents

I -think- the only thing stripped from the game is all languages except English... But since I havn´t gotten it to work, even in Dolphin I can´t say for sure."
,Hakidia,2011-08-30T13:41Z,Works with neogamma perfectly as far as I can tell. 
,Hakidia,2011-08-30T13:41Z,Also ya only language is english. 
,Hakidia,2011-08-30T13:43Z,Works perfectly in neogamma as far as I can tell. 
,Hakidia,2011-08-30T13:43Z,Derp forget that this comment system sucks. 
,Jenaltals,2011-09-07T01:54Z,"i was able to download and play it on my 4.0 hb wii. but the only problem was that everything was in black and white, no color what so ever. any tips, or is it just my tv?"
,Hakidia,2011-09-07T13:19Z,tv doesn't support pal force ntsc
,RMDslash,2011-09-09T13:34Z,how did you make the file into burnable size. ive tried to do that many times using wii scrubber but all i get is a bigger file. but hey im just going to download srubbed torrents from now on. thanks for the awesome upload
,RMDslash,2011-09-09T13:35Z,i cant get any seeds for some reason
,Kripteck,2011-09-10T18:19Z,"Whenever i try to play it gives me a ""system error"" saying that the wii system files are corrupted, and it didn't work with neogamma for some reason.

Can i get some help here?"
,RikuDawn,2011-09-10T21:05Z,Tried burning but it freezes at 71%.
,Kripteck,2011-09-14T21:40Z,"I fixed the problem, turns out i had to update some cISOs and stuff to make it work through neogamma.

For anyone who still have any problems with it, google and download ""ModMii"" and install everything missing with it, then download NeoGamma, that should get it working.

Hope my comment help some people."
