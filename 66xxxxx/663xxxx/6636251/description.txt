                Today love is causing problems all over camp.
                Kimberley realises the truth about Jake, Rachael is
                struggling to deal with the events of last week and
                Pam's indiscretions finally push Bobby over the edge.
                When Bobby loses it, he really loses it as the Brits
                and the Chunk Bunk find out when he sends them on the
                day trip from hell.

                Encoded at crf 21 because this series is less
                compressible than most scripted series. It would go
                over 5000 kbit/s on crf 19.
