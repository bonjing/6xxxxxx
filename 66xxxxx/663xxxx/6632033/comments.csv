,bborud,2011-09-15T18:21Z,"Fyi..... Just got a notification, after 2 weeks of use, saying serial # was invalid. Tried a few more of the serials included, majority of which are now invalid, finally found one that worked. Besides that, another fantastic torrent from blaze69! "
,bborud,2011-09-15T18:44Z,"...... and no, I did not have automatic updates turned on. "
,Lucafa,2011-09-15T23:30Z,"I've found a way to keep tuneup working forever (with updates), but I'm afraid the tuneup company is gonna 'fix' the solution I've found when I start telling people about it on the internet.. It's an easy fix though, nothing fancy. but it works, my tuneup has been running for over a year now, with updates. Just be logical about it, and you'll find the solution aswell.

,diakon27,2011-09-23T00:28Z,Too bad there wasn't a torrent that gives a permanent serial key......just so everyone knows the serial keys provided only last so many days then you have to keep putting in the other ones....its free though so what the hell eh?
,adisyam,2011-09-27T17:03Z,Thanks man for ur great works...
,tMBA89,2011-12-01T15:19Z,"Downloaded, installed, activation works, everythings works nice and smoothly! Thx for the up! (1 Activation key did not work, but just try another one!)
