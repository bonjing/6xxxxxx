,beliha,2011-10-04T00:31Z,"Why is it that every torrent has one stupid commentator who keeps insisting that 1920 x 816 isn't 1080p??

Listen, 1920 X 500 is still 1080p, got it?? Because its all about aspect Ratio!

ALL theatrical movies when converted to bluRay end up 1920 x 816, because the originaly material is filmed in 1.85:1 aspect ratio, and then converted to HD, so the aspect ratio stays the same and doesn't magically change to 16:9!

Got it now?? What he simply did, is removed the black bars to save space!"
