This one-of-a-kind authoritative guide to the ancient art of potted miniature trees and is simply a bonsaist collector`s item that gives the feeling of being directly in the workshop with the Japanese Bonsai Master Kimura. More over the printed edition is SOLD OUT, not to mention its $280 cover price. These Out of Print gem is the Ferrari of the bonsai books in the market. You will be one of only a few thousand in the world owning this hard-to-find book by a legendary Japanese bonsai master Kimura. In an ancient Japanese scroll written in Japan around the Kamakura period, it is translated to say : "To appreciate and find pleasure in curiously curved potted trees is to love deformity." Whether this was intended as a positive or negative statement, it leaves us to believe that growing dwarfed and twisted trees in containers was an accepted practice among the upper class of Japan by the Kamakura period. By the fourteenth century bonsai was indeed viewed as a highly refined art form, meaning that it must have been an established practice many years before that time.
