Doujin sequel to the Thunder Force series of shmups.
Released in 2007 by Factory Noise AG circle but quickly withdrawn from sale.
Although the soundtrack has been widely available and considered to be excellent, the game itself received a lot of critiscism and has been extremely hard to find...until now :)
