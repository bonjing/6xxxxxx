One issue though...
After entering serial all works great until you quit the application and re-open, then you get trial with watermark and have to enter the serial again.
Any ideas on how to resolve this issue?"

,SHdz09,2011-09-06T05:38Z,"I agree. Serial works, but it has to be re-entered every time the program is re-opened."
