Come on guys why the hate, itâ€™s a religion, well its the fastest growing religion but so what, its here to stay, so get used to it, writing comments on torrents to incite Muslims is kind of pointless. Iâ€™m not annoyed at all im just confounded at how stupid some of the earths population has become, i mean downloading porn all day and night and then stopping to add a comment on islam is kind of gay if you ask me. But back on topic, cut the crap, really i cant imagine how much of a gain this could be to yourself, sure its freedom of speech but its ignorant and unfounded. If only you could open your hearts then you too would see the message, the Holy Quran is the only book, that contains gods words, passed on to his messenger, the prophet muhamed, this Message is life changing, where else can you find a detailed explanation of birth/pregnancy and rain formation from 1400 years ago etc. where else you can find the most profound recitals of peace, love and unity, nowhere but the Quran... Open your hearts fellow piratebayers. Stop the hatred, youâ€™ll die lonely and miserable, accept that there are other people on this earth and you might just find friends who actually care for you, love from your pirate bay brother, peace be upon you.
