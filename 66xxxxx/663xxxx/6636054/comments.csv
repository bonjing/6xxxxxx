[V],MKVGuy,2011-08-28T20:32Z,"Should I start doing 720p in 600-700mb size or my classic 480p 300-400mb rips or both??

Suggestions please because I already see that there are around 10 rippers who already are providing such rips and with quality and I cannot guarantee better quality from them because I also use the same tools.."
[V],MKVGuy,2011-08-28T20:34Z,"@seni, most of the rippers use MeGUI to provide rips, and we also have StaxRip, HandBreak, ect..
Yes it does have subtitles in English.."
,gary2u,2011-08-28T21:06Z,thx for dis upload....pls continue doing with 5.1 audio...!!
,critic89,2011-08-28T21:40Z,"@mkvguy..

i agree with u..that there r many uploaders now..bt u know u were the first one for me frm where i started downloading small rips..n u almost left 1 year ago..:(...bt never the less u r back..welcum back..:D
dat was awesome surprise..
i suggest u should do 480p BR or dvd..as u were doing uin past..becoz..still many ppl hav low band width..:P
and for some odd high demand  movies...if u r doing 720p than do in 5.1 channels because no1 else is doing it in the size u r doing...all else do in 2 channel only..:D

and welcum back bro..hope u will be cosistent"
,pulasthi007m,2011-08-29T05:14Z,i think 720p maximum quality (bit rate) with 2 channel audio and file size around 600-700mb is better.
,nadeem15,2011-08-29T06:10Z,"thanks a million for this upload......Can u pls upload Scream 1,2,3 in 720p????????? 
pls dont go back to 480p......."
,vinx02,2011-08-29T06:27Z,"thanks mkvguy..
maybe your right man. you should start doing 720p in 600-700mb size with 2 channel audio only like critic89 and pulasthi007m for best quality in that size.."
,Johnson_01,2011-08-29T07:28Z,720p is better...!
,.KATAsTrOphE.,2011-08-29T12:51Z,"Of course do 720p rips of size not more than 800mb plz......i would prefer only 2 channel audio instead of 5 channel and use the file size for maximum video quality like bitrate etc..
Like u said there are many Tiny Rip uploaders but no one encodes 1080p movies fo around 1-1.5/2-2.5 gb........maybe u can try one or two rips in that area too........I appreciate the fact that U R asking for honest replies :)"
,SaXXena,2011-08-29T13:46Z,"+1!!!

plz stick to 720p only and you could do 2ch only.... this would reduce the size of the upload......nd welcome back.....:)"
,pri_246302rocks,2011-08-29T14:06Z,"Happy ya back buddy ;);) Good news for ya fans.. der r lot of rippers doin 720p, do movies that arent available in small size like ya classic rips ;);) Like must watch movies from past :);) Welcome back MKVGuy.. !!!"
,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-08-29T14:49Z,dude you should do your quintessential small rips of 400mb. ur quality has always been 10/10. just continue your excellent work just as before! please dont make 700-800mb rips.. Yify is there for that.
,Serp77,2011-08-29T14:53Z,The best solution is to do them both. You'll make everyone happy.
,kuttootta,2011-08-29T15:56Z,"I stand for 480p because my speed is very low. 

Most of your fans like old MKVGuy."
,nehal2012,2011-08-29T18:25Z,need more seeds speed is very slow and also @mkvguy do u have a facebook page ?
,pulasthi007m,2011-08-29T19:19Z,I agree with manishpk2007.
,a212,2011-08-29T19:41Z,"Good to have u back :)
720p rips would be great..
or doing 480p & 720p both would be great too :)"
,justregged,2011-08-30T00:04Z,"Bitrate makes no difference to live action movies thats a myth. Anyway I agree with the filesize thing 720p at 700meg or more as needed and scrap the 5.1 audio but thats just my opinion. Basically if I have a choice between downloading yours with 5.1 or scorps with 2channel then im downloading scorps as i know more has gone into the video, and the surround sound I dont need. Ask yourself how many ppl downloading movies have surround sound systems, I would say few. But im not greedy so do what you feel I dont care either way."
,apsandhu,2011-08-30T08:24Z,"@MKVGuy welcome back...u were sorely missed...
UR earlier rips averaged about 400MB and I think U should stick to that...for people wanting more quality and bigger sizes, there are a lot of other good uploaders now...also u should loose the 5.1 sound...that's not needed...
if not then do both small size and larger size rips...so each can choose what they want..."
,Ravlot,2011-08-30T20:10Z,"@ MKVGuy............. please please please be active
 i check regularly for your torrents since u uploaded last in Dec-2011............ 720p will be great.........."
,jyotir4,2011-08-31T16:49Z,@MKVGuy 720p BRRIP is really very good...please keep posting latest movies.
,tony.st,2011-08-31T19:42Z,"@MKVGuy 

For action/blockbuster movies do 720p - 5.1 sound (700 MB - 1000 MB)

For non-action (drama,triller) do 720p (700 MB)"
,vinx02,2011-09-01T03:03Z,make the 720p more or less 1GB..
,sup3xtian,2011-09-01T08:48Z,"i prefer 480p love them ever since, 480p @ 500mb
or 720p 800mb up will be ok."
,sXsmaster,2011-09-01T16:38Z,"keep the 720p res, but the size should be 700mb or less,,,  but again  all the movies are not worth downloading 700mb as compared to 300mb when you have low downloading speed.....
i guess u shoulddo them both sizes,,,,
everyone will be happy....
    i mean you are in our bookmarks.......dude !"
,gh7216,2011-09-02T07:51Z,"welcome back man 
720p in 600-700mb is way better than 480p.
so in my suggestion u should do 720p"
,gh7216,2011-09-02T07:58Z,u can't enjoy a summer blockbuster fully with 480p.
,a212,2011-09-02T08:07Z,"@MKVGuy
hey why are u not posting it under High-Resolution  category.."
,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-09-02T10:32Z,ARE YOU JUST GOING TO ASK FOR SUGGESTIONS OR ARE YOU GOING TO UPLOAD SOMETHING???
,imjustwow,2011-09-02T20:07Z,"@MKVGuy...man nice to have u back

And to answer your question on POC post.....I think you should stay though others are their....having choices is great between uploaders....but if we all acknowledge one uploader for his upload then we should atleast respect by uploading a different movie if not at least the same movie in different size so that people have options!!! 

Well the bottom line is that you need to stay active....chao  now :)"
,surenlokka,2011-09-03T21:47Z,"This is my first request for you...can you please upload Thats What I Am 2011 movie... Thanks for your good work...

[V],MKVGuy,2011-09-04T19:39Z,"Alright guys, thanks for your suggestions..

I will try to start both 720p and 480p with 2.1 channels only.."
,manni1988,2011-09-04T21:45Z,"@ MKVGUY
i think that you should go with 5.1 channel audio because no one is doing it in such small and perfect quality"
,manni1988,2011-09-04T21:46Z,"@ MKVGUY
i think that you should go with 5.1 channel audio because no one is doing it in such small and perfect quality "
[V],MKVGuy,2011-09-05T19:08Z,"@manni1988, but its really of no use until you have 5.1 speakers and most of the users have 2.1.. any other thought guys on this?"
,SaXXena,2011-09-05T19:40Z,"@MKVGuy:

stick to 2.1 ch 720p rips only..... as most of the downloaders have 2.1ch speakers......it would reduce the size too......
"
,rockr191,2011-09-06T09:10Z,"yep.. 2.1 channel will suffice or even 2 channels would.
but 5.1 will be just a waste.."
,vinx02,2011-09-06T16:51Z,"@MKVGuy 
yeah,,most of us has only 2.1 speaker.
please make only 720p w/ 2.1ch..700MB-1GB"
,tony.st,2011-09-07T22:49Z,Save 5.1 audio for big blockbuster movies. that would be a nice touch.
,adi1812,2011-09-10T08:45Z,First of all I have just started downloading your rips & they are awesome.Now with riddlera & pluto999 gone & the size of yify's recent rips increasing by the day i think 2.1 channel 720p rips in the range of 600mb-700mb will be more appreciated specially now that there is a lot of new uploaders like stylishsalh & ilpruny ripping 480p movies in 300mb-400mb..
,manni1988,2011-09-10T12:00Z,"@ MKVGUY
i have 5.1 speakers & I watched your X-Men.First.Class torrent upload which is under 700mb and still its sound quality was awesome in 5.1 ch mode far better than 2.1 ch that's why i requested that u should go for 5.1 ch audio bcoz your torrents were still under 700mb even after 5.1 ch audio which is highly appreciable.
Thanks for your effort though."
,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-09-10T16:13Z,just upload however the fuck you want... people will download it. stop asking so many fucking questions... you're obviously going to get different answers from everyone. 
,Nash6989,2011-09-12T07:51Z,Think everyone should shut the fuck up and let him do what he wants. his torrents are awesome. so fuck off.
,Nash6989,2011-09-12T07:52Z,"@MKVGuy
