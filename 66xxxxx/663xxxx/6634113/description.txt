I couldn\'t find it on any filesharing or Torrent site, so here it is! LoL Domination by TheGameDude!

First off, I didn\'t buy it. He had a \"sale\" going on where if you went to his page and filled out a survey, you could get it for free. I did that, and obviously, it didn\'t work. But easily enough, all I had to do was to disable Javascript, the survey box didn\'t pop up, and I was able to download it easily. So now I\'m sharing it for everyone else who wants it!

It\'s nothing amazing, just a short 22 page PDF, definitely NOT worth the $30 or whatever he\'s selling it for at retail. Enjoy!

PS: This is my first torrent upload, so if something is wrong, let me know and I\'ll 
fix it.

P.S 2: I think I screwed up my last one to where I got the file name wrong and I couldn\'t initial seed it. I hope this fixes it.
