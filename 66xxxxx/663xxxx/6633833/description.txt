On March 17, Canadians celebrate St. Patrickâ€™s Day with parades, whiskey and songs. But for millions of Irish-Canadians, there is a story of unspeakable sadness at the heart of Canadaâ€™s Irish experience.  It is a story seldom mentioned, even today. Some call it the Irish potato famine. Others call it the Great Starvation. And others do not shrink from calling it a great crime. The saga has a million stories and on March 17, CBC TVâ€™s Doc Zone will let you discover Famine and Shipwreck, an Irish Odyssey, a film by Brian McKenna, a story thatâ€™s one in a million.

Famine and Shipwreck, an Irish Odyssey was shot in Ireland, Quebec, Ontario and off the coast of Prince Edward Island, in 2010.  It never would have been possible without the incredible efforts of Paddy Murphy from Ontario, who traced his genealogy back to his Irish roots in South Armagh, Ireland.

Famine and Shipwreck, an Irish Odyssey is a Galafilm production, produced in association with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Radio-Canada, with the financial participation of the Canadian Media Fund, the Quebec tax credit and the Federal tax credit, and developed with the financial participation of the SODEC.
