Plot
----
A high school student named Brett Bumpers (Michael Weston) receives a mysterious 
package one day. He does not know who gave it to him, but after a while he finds 
out that the totem within the package can give him 3 wishes. When the most 
beautiful girl in school, Samantha, (Alexandra Holden) invites him to dance on 
the next day, he knows for sure that his first wish has come true. He uses the 
second one to make Samantha fall in love with him, but when someone starts 
killing students in the school, he realizes that it has something to do with the 
totem. Now it's his responsibility to save their lives.
