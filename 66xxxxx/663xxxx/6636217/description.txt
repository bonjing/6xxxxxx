[DESCRIPTION.]:
Wigan Warriors v Leeds Rhinos (Kick-off 2.30pm). Coverage
of the final at Wembley Stadium, where the successors to
Warrington Wolves are set to be decided. The Rhinos lost 30
-6 to the Wolves in last year's showpiece match and are
aiming to lift the trophy for the first time since 1999, while the
Warriors' last victory was over their close rivals St Helens in
2002. Presented by Clare Balding.

Be prepared for some very one sided opinions in the HT and
FT reviews guys, perhaps Davies knows his old team are
going to get beat by the on form in Super League Warriors
next week! Will Warrington stop Wigan or will Wigan top the
league again this year... Only time will tell!
