,GoodTunes,2011-08-25T21:28Z,"Wait, nevermind, THIS IS A VIRUS! Look at the file size, the real ones are 664kb each!"
,GoodTunes,2011-08-25T21:34Z,"Again, DO NOT DOWNLOAD IS A VIRUS!
THE REAL SPRITES ARE HUNDREDS OF TIMES LARGER THAN THIS, NO WAY EACH ONE IS ONLY 4kb!"
,Dynd,2011-08-25T23:57Z,"No it isn't a virus, they are actually really small. "

You just forgot to include 99% of the files for this upload, which is why it's only 9kb.
Pointless upload, replaces the core model locator files with the ones you already have. The other torrent you uploaded actually has the models:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6630511/Europa_Universalis_III__Western___Eastern_-_AD_1400_Spritepacks

I recommend simply deleting this torrent."
