,lbader,2011-09-01T03:51Z,Can anyone tell me why none of these episodes are downloading for me even though there are so many seeders and I am having luck with other random files? I am using Transmission for Mac. Kind of new at this - what am I missing? I'm seeding what I download btw and have high speed DSL... (?)
