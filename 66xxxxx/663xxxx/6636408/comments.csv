congrats for ur 1st upload with such a good torrent

but 
don't ignore the latest A THOUSAND SUNS
if u mind the comments by other listeners then you'll be easily driven by others

you complain that the previous mode of tracks are missing then listen to 
BLACKOUT
WHEN THEY COME FOR ME
WRETCHES AND KINGS

i've seen the making of this album from this torrent 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5826655/Linkin_Park_-_A_Thousand_Suns_%5BiTunes_LP_M4A_M4V%5D%5BMJN%5D

named meeting of thousand suns

c'mon"
