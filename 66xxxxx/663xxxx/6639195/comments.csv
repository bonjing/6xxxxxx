[T],rjaa,2011-08-31T05:44Z,"guys download this torrent without any confusion

this is a region free dvd

*sorry 4 bad eng"
,oldtyme72,2011-09-03T05:16Z,"Very nice.  Even has special features & commentary (something I wish everyone would leave in). 
I'll take reduced video quality for included extras."
,keleieke,2011-09-03T05:41Z,"The menu structure is destroyed on this due to an added custom main menu to select audio languages.  It's possible to play one movie vob at a time (with a PC media player), but ImgBurn nor CloneDVD2 will open this.  DVDRemake is able to open it and all files are flagged red until the menu is removed.  This is what I'm doing now.   I back tracked to this page to give warning since no one else has.  If you can mount this iso and perform surgury, this might still be ok.  If I don't come back here that means it worked out well enough to burn / play DVD+R."
,keleieke,2011-09-03T06:29Z,"After all that... ""Playback area limitations"" per the DVD player.  This is not a region-1, nor has the region code been removed.

If your player is region free this might work.  If your player is region free, you can't test whether a region code is removed."
,viejogab,2011-09-03T06:31Z,"thanks for uploading this, "
,loni90,2011-09-03T15:09Z,"please help me find ""A Better Life""

been looking all over, looks like a good movie to watch! "
,WingedDevil,2011-09-05T03:38Z,"So, I downloaded this movie, went to watch and its... the movie Unknown, not fast five... very confused right now...."
,WingedDevil,2011-09-05T03:54Z,nvm my comment... turns out I had a dvd in my computer o.o
,420est,2011-09-05T08:01Z,how do you seed
,WhiteGloves,2011-09-09T02:24Z,"FYI ""region free"" only applies to the player. If you want to play this on your own DVD player and TV set (not a computer) then NTSC or PAL definitely matters (very few TV sets have both). Making a DVD ""region free"" does NOT mean it will play on any system."
,guitargamery,2011-09-20T17:41Z,"lolol My God the worst movie ever made--about cars and racing but---looks more like a rambo movie with lots of explosions...for those who liked the previous movies from fast and furious ...well you will have just in the end of the movie(about 7 minutes) a strange race??? pulling a giant safe...uau this movie was horrible, for sure the first one still the best one, cheers guys but please see for yourself and fell free to comment on my fsx channel on youtube"
,bholmers,2011-10-01T04:42Z,So is it NTSC or PAL  cause the region has nothing to do with the frames per second...
