Gorbachev.....in his own words.

Twenty years on from the fall of the Soviet Union, Bridget Kendall charts the rise to power of its last leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, to reveal how a once-loyal supporter of Communism took it on himself to reform the Soviet system from within.

By trying to democratize the Soviet system, Gorbachev inadvertently planted the seeds that led to its destruction. The only Soviet leader to have grown up in the system was its last.
