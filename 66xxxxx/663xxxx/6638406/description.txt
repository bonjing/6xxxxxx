    Colonel Pete Moore is commander of the Whitney Radar Test Group,         
    which has been experiencing electrical difficulties aboard its           
    aircraft. To ferret out the problem, he sends a four-man crew on         
    Flight 412. Shortly into the test, the jet picks up three blips on       
    radar, and subsequently, two fighters scramble and mysteriously          
    disappear. At this point, Flight 412 is monitored and forced to land     
    by Digger Control, a top-level, military intelligence group that         
    debunks UFO information. The intrepid colonel, kept in the dark about    
    his crew, decides to investigate the matter himself.
