[S],velvet.,2011-08-27T22:35Z,"A normal resolution Doctor Who episode is typically 550 MB.
Your version is 9.75 GB.  That is almost 18 times bigger.

At full resolution, you haven't even set any parameters on the DVR for recording, they are on default maximum, at this size for a 48 minute show.

I suggest you read up on 'ripping'and encoding, there is plenty of material covering the subject of ripping and encoding for viable upload size files, as VF indicates, this shouldn't be more than 550Mb for a full resolution XviD at 48 minutes and as you will see, MP4/MKV/FLV etc are much smaller.

You'll find encoding software like 'Total Video Converter' for instance, easy enough and Nero has a decent video encoder/converter with it, etc. and info on encoding parameters, resolution/aspect ratio/FPS/bitrates for sound and video etc is easily available online via a search

Don't be put off, but as said, nobody is going to download nearly 10Gb's for a 48 minute show, people upload entire series of 12-15 shows at that filesize matey.

Thanks for your efforts anyway, but it's simply too large a filesize.

Mind how ye go, ay.

Peace. : )"
