well,that was a load of work.
The Video itself was very nice, just needed cropping, fixing the aspect, fixing the resolution and fixing perspective.
Got that great Line, cleaned it up and synced it back to my video, took me more than 6 hours, its a lot easier with R5 Video than with a cam.
Anyway its completely lipsync, you know i can ;)
enjoy
