,indie_guy,2011-11-21T01:46Z,Any1 mind seeding for a little while? I'd like to download this.
,MIXicant,2011-11-30T11:57Z,"for those of you Dolphin people:

I found this was in wbfs format (or something similar) and not in iso format.  Dolphin is bias for isos

if anyone knows how to turn it into an iso, you may gladly post"

*also for anyone else who needs to know*

go look for Wii Backup Manager. It converts .wbfs back into .iso."
