The Star Trek Night was a special evening of programs broadcasted by the BBC on BBC2. Presented by Red Dwarf star Craig Charles, the night was designed to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the franchise, as well as to launch the just-acquired Star Trek: Voyager. A common strand throughout the evening was "Star Trekkers," a series of short interviews in which celebrity Trek fans talked about the series.
