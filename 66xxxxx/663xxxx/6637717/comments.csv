[V],SAFCukO09,2011-08-29T16:37Z,I could have encoded this to an avi if i'd known the file size would have been such a big issue ..Stick the file in megui and then someone get it uploaded 
,redchain55,2011-08-29T16:45Z,FST
,Babygeorge,2011-08-29T17:44Z,"I need an AVI version of this -it is almost an emergency!...Because I need for it to play on a regular DVD player... 

Thank you SAFCuK anyway for all your uploads... =)"
,levarnaud,2011-08-29T18:49Z,"WTF is this bunch of retards. Can't play a mkv file, need 700mb like during stone age etc
So you still burn your movies on a cd or you have a 56k connection? Maybe you want a VHS rip? Jeez...
Just stop bitching, some people actually want quality, even if you don't."
,alectinho,2011-08-29T19:50Z,Thnx))
,bryentheartist,2011-08-29T21:24Z,"apeloff fuck you asshoe. I don't watch these on my computer, I put them on flash drive then watch on plasma tv. so eat shit and die asswipe. (shit stain on the panties of life)"

,Erik_O,2011-08-29T22:29Z,if u bitches want crappy quality why not make it 350mb or even smaller? would that make u satisfied ?
,levarnaud,2011-08-29T23:04Z,"@bryentheartist so just convert it to xvid, is that so hard?"
,killeurkilleur,2011-08-30T01:47Z,"i don't care if it's mkv , avi , mpeg or any other major video format...

MY ONLY COMPLAINT is about the size...it's just too big...700 meg would be great...this is not a blockbuster movie...this is not a classic movie like the godfather,taxi driver etc. IT'S JUST AN MTV CEREMONY...700 meg is enough ...."
,thegr8luiz,2011-08-30T05:21Z,"I don't understand those who complain about file size and format. This is not the only release available. If this is too big for you or for any reason you don't like/want mkv, just download the avi files available in most other torrents. I prefer higher quality and appreciate the time and effort this user and many other put into sharing files like this with us. Thank you very much. Keep up the great work."
,redchain55,2011-08-30T07:13Z,awesome downaloded at speed of 10 mb/sec
,twmcm69,2011-08-31T23:58Z,"Agreed. If this file is is too big for you, download a lesser quality version - there are many.

I want HD and the file size doesn't matter as long as the resolution, bitrate & quality are high."
,fedfam,2011-09-01T02:52Z,Maybe it's just my end but the perfomances I can only hear their voices (very clear though) and the music only slightly. Like there is a channel not playing.
,mdehghani,2011-09-03T20:12Z,"Although we really appreciate your efforts towards sharing these types of events with high video quality, unfortunately as the other member said, it seems that an audio channel is missing so it doesn't result in a pleasant sound experience. but thx anyway.   "
,uwabaki,2011-09-05T22:33Z,"come on people. MKVs and highres and several gig files is simply the evolution of file sharing. get on it. optical media is gone, get yourself a network media player."
,Damon163,2011-09-13T23:33Z,Thanks for uploading! Will seed!
