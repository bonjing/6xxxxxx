,cravi33,2011-09-15T18:07Z,Hey... My system is crashed. Now how can i re-seed the same torrent. Here the Edit is not working... Should i seed again freshly ?
,cravi33,2011-09-19T04:07Z,"Try adding these trackers to your torrent file... Whether this will help in continuing the download or not ?

,cravi33,2011-09-23T16:14Z,"I did the way you said. It says its seeding, but no one seems to be connected here. I think this is not the way. I think i have to create again a new torrent and upload."
,cravi33,2011-09-23T16:59Z,Hey i got the way finally. BUt i added some new songs to the folder. So it says 99.9% only. I think the new songs will not be added to download.
,cravi33,2011-09-23T17:49Z,Anyway i Reloaded a new torrent with updated songs. You can download any missing files from there also.
,cravi33,2011-10-21T16:39Z,I am having the songs in the folder...but still it says files missing...any other ideas how to overcome this...
,sunnynice,2011-10-23T02:21Z,kindly provide seed
