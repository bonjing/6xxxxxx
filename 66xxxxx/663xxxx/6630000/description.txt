::Plot::
Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) is in the Caribbean meeting with her accountant to discuss her investments, and to finalize her purchase of an apartment in Stockholm. On returning to Sweden, Salander reconnects with Miriam Wu (Yasmine Garbi) and offers her free use of her previous apartment in return for forwarding her mail. Wu gives her a cigarette case as a belated birthday gift. Later, Salander confronts her guardian, Nils Bjurman (Peter Andersson) after hacking into his email account and discovering he has an appointment booked with a tattoo removal specialist. Threatening him with his own gun, she warns him not to remove the tattoo that she previously etched on his stomach, marking him as a rapist.
