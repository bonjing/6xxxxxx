Prophet Yusufâ€™s (as) story, described as â€œthe best of narrativesâ€ in the Holy Quran, is an epic 45 episode series (one hour each) depicting the story of Prophet Yusuf (as). This series is directed by Farajollah Salahshoor, whose records include series of â€˜the People of the Caveâ€™, â€˜Prophet Ayyub (as)â€™ and others.

Prophet Yusufâ€™s series was the biggest production in 2008 in Iran and was broadcast on IRIB and Al-Kawthar TV. The scriptwriters included 20 people, and took four years to complete.

Contrary to other series watched, viewers know full or part of the story as well as its ending, adding to the difficulty for actors to perform their duty, which was nonetheless a success in portraying their character.

This series gives us a beautiful insight into the life of Prophet Yusuf (as) and the difficulties he went through from an early age, his youth, life in prison, ability to resolve the drought issue and most importantly his steadfastness in front of all the problems and challenges he faced.

We can learn many inspirational lessons from Prophet Yusufâ€™s life to benefit from; to rely on the will of Allah (swt) in all circumstances and always strive in His way, to maintain moral and ethical values, and to forgive.

During an interview, when asked about how the director was able to reflect the story of Prophet Yusuf (as), he said: â€œBy showing how Prophet Yusuf was a) a particular model of trust in God, b) a role model in patience, c) gentleness, d) invoking and referring to God and His Oneness, and e) being a successful manager.â€ All these are important to show that the story of Prophet Yusuf (as) is that of a pure, God-fearing, and trustworthy prophet, and not a simple love story as it is sometimes narrated with added or subtracted details.

Mustafa Zamani, the actor playing the role of Prophet Yusuf (as), says: â€œWe want to highlight the purity of Prophet Yusuf (as), and his good management of Egypt during the drought, not beauty,â€ highlighting the importance of reading stories of the Holy Quran and understanding its lessons which would guide us to implement them in our life and not a superficial and time-passing story.



One might be dubious regarding the authenticity of such series and how it was prolonged for 45 episodes. As stated in the interview with the director, the series is based on the story as narrated in the Holy Quran, with details taken from various sources, such as Hadiths, Tafsir and history books from Ahle-Sunna and Shia, where the stories and narrations are in conformity with Quranic verses. Conflicting stories and narrations werenâ€™t taken into account.

The only translation available so far, alongside the original in Persian is Arabic which has been interpreted perfectly No doubt further translations are on their way so this excellent series can reach a wider audience.
