All these Magnum torrents were downloaded from other torrent sites and were then uploaded here since there weren't any seeded ones.
No modifications were done on my part.

I've seen all 22 episodes, no hardcoded subs were shown in VLC player.

What player are you using?
Are you burning the episodes then watching it?"
