,ramikaz,2011-08-29T01:46Z,"I've found most home ""inspectors"" are clueless and miss a lot of things.  I used to get inspections for my properties, now I do them myself.  This book should help others do the same, so save your $300 to $500 and don't hire a guy who was ""certified"" after a week of ""training"" or by taking an online course."
