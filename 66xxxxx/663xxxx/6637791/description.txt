1969 - Kamasutra: Vollendung der Liebe (Soundtrack)


...For although the soundtrack is credited to keyboardist Irmin Schmidt, itâ€™s really the work of a prototypical line-up of Can called Inner Space that was active in 1968. Alongside Can stalwarts bassist Holger Czukay, guitarist Michael Karoli, and drummer Jaki Liebezeit were songbird Margarete Juvan and two Americans, soon-to-depart flutist David Johnson and just-arrived singer Malcolm Mooney. Excepting Juvan, theyâ€™d all already worked together on the ripping garage rocker â€œFather Cannot Yell,â€ which would turn up on Canâ€™s debut album Monster Movie (although it bears noting that Johnson only operated the tape deck that day). The sextet recorded just one other time, to make the music for Kamasutra. 
Some of Canâ€™s signature sounds were already in place. Liebezeit, a disillusioned former free jazz drummer, had already figured out how to play elaborate figures without betraying the groove; Czukay, who was just beginning to get familiar with his electric bass, played simply but melodically. Despite being credited as the leader, Schmidt was as unfamiliar with pop music as Czukay was with his instrument and hadnâ€™t figured out what to do in that context yet; his organ and electric piano keep a pretty low profile. So itâ€™s Karoliâ€™s already distinctive guitar and Johnsonâ€™s patchouli-fragrant flute that bring the tunes to balance Liebezeitâ€™s beats. Since the movie has an Indian theme, thereâ€™s also a little sitar in the background...
