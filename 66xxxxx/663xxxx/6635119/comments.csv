I think I've never ever seen such bad quality (it's usually never less than 48000Hz 128kb/s), and then the video is the full 720 pixels wide - what were you thinking??

I compared the image quality to the Swedish TV series DVD (4:3) which was quite interesting - this movie version is 16:9, containing more image on the sides, however it's cropped on top and bottom. The image quality is in some ways much better on this - much cleaner and with nicer colours and blacks, however everything is slightly blurred, meaning the image of the TV series is much sharper and therefore to prefer (+ that it's much longer, of course). Also, this movie version is a bit vertically squeezed.
