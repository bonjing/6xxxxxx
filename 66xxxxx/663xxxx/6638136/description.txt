Principles of Yacht Design is both comprehensible to amateurs and comprehensive for professionals. It follows the design of a 40-foot cruising sailboat from the first sketch to the final weight, strength, and sail area calculations, with tables, charts, and diagrams to let the reader adapt the process to any design. This edition is revised and expanded to cover powerboats as well as sailboats.
