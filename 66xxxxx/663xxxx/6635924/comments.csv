,ArrogantIgnorance,2011-09-05T13:50Z,"Wow! Fastest DL I've ever had! 8+ MBps! 

Thanks much SAFCukO09 from those of us who are trapped in Asia without any source for racing of any kind... (because the rat bastards that own the satellite service are too F%*#ing cheap to pay-so they drop Star Sports w/o notice!!!) 

Seed to at least 2.000 guys-there aren't many of us who follow F1, MotoGP, BTCC, WTCC, and cycling, so we need all the seeds out there we can get!"
