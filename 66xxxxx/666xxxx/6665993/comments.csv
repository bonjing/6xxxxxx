,PingPang,2011-09-11T11:19Z,oorenotsoo said it.
,720plover,2011-09-11T18:46Z,Any upload by BOZX is an automatic download for me. One of the few uploaders that has 100% perfect quality every single time. 
,originalKL,2011-09-11T20:38Z,"I'm sure the quality of the download is perfect.  This movie is absolutely horrible.  They should have spent some of the budget on actors instead of guys like 50 Cent and Randy Cooter.  You'll want to slit your wrists 20 minutes in..  If you make it to the end, you could probably handle being waterboarded."
,DontPissMeOff,2011-09-11T22:45Z,"I didn't even make it to the end.
When is 50 cent going to understand he is not an actor? Obviously, they couldn't put anyone instead of 50 Cent because 50 cent is the producer. And Bruce will play in anything for money. He even played a part in an advertisement of Polish Vodka. His role in this film is minor though but apparantly it's enough to put him in the poster in the foreground. This is probably the worst line I've ever heard:
-50: Do you know Vincent?
-Jewelery Trafficker: No, I've never heard of him.
-50 reload's his gun
-JT: Ok, Yeah, I know him. 
LOL"

,ninja2644,2011-09-12T22:39Z,"Quality is good

...but movie sucks big time! The cast and everything may seem okay but it feels like the cheapest production of a movie ever..it's such a B-moive!"
,bak13,2011-09-13T12:40Z,quality and everything is perfect(thanx Bozx BtW) but the movie is soooooo bad.50cent -or whatever his real name(who gives a f**k anyway) is tragic...
,Rizbo_NS,2011-09-13T16:50Z,I decided to not watch this movie...I dont wanna change my good opinium for Bruce.
,Qajs1,2011-09-14T03:05Z,Seeders/Leechers < 1 which means SLOW ASS DOWNLOAD.
,RichardSillyman,2011-09-16T00:16Z,I find that this is the 2nd most traded/shared DTS HR movie on this site.  Certainly somebody is liking it and watching it completely.  All others minus one are traded & supported less than this one.  Why?
,Sagiy20,2011-09-18T22:02Z,":) I agree with Rizbo_NS.

Thanks for all the honest comments on the movie.

At first I was like ""OMG, Bruce willis""... but then I read your comments.... heh"
,shpongles,2011-09-19T06:46Z,the writing is shitttttt............

Okay, another nonsense movie.  How can Bruce agrees to be in this movie.  Clearly, he needs to money or something.

But just to be fair, I have seen worse.  So, this is still watchable if you do not pay full attention.

bruce willis could not even act properly - he was trying not to lough the whole time..

i give it to ryan phillippe for trying to make the movie believable but the story and script were so bad and lame that no one could save it...

whoever convinced these two in playing in it was a really good salesman! "
,annafour,2011-10-15T11:15Z,I'll give it a try.Thanks!
