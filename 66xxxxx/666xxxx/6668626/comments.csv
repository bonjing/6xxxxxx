,Aeromance,2011-10-02T03:07Z,"When playing, it seems to have two tracks of audio playing, about a second or two off from each other. Obviously, that makes it unwatchable. 
At the bottom of the description, two audio tracks are mentioned, so that might be the issue. I'll try to fix it but if anyone has any tips or knows how to fix it, help would be appreciated. "
,Aeromance,2011-10-02T03:15Z,"Also: when I try to play it on VLC, the audio works, but then the video is barely visible behind a sheet of gray. 
Again, any help would be amazing. "
