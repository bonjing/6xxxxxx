The state of the art in antenna design and engineering

Edited by one of the world's foremost authorities on smart antennas and featuring contributions from global experts, Frontiers in Antennas discusses the latest advances in antenna design and engineering. This pioneering guide deals primarily with frontier antenna designs and frontier numerical methods. Many of the concepts presented have emerged within the last few years and are still in a rapid state of development. Each chapter provides in-depth details on a unique and modern antenna technology.

Frontiers in Antennas covers:

    * Ultra-wideband antenna arrays using fractal, polyfractal, and aperiodic geometries
    * Smart antennas using evolutionary signal processing methods
    * The latest developments in Vivaldi antenna arrays
    * Effective media models applied to artificial magnetic conductors and high impedance surfaces
    * Novel developments in metamaterial antennas
    * Biological antenna design methods using genetic algorithms
    * Contact and parasitic methods applied to reconfigurable antennas
    * Antennas in medicine: ingestible capsule antennas using conformal meandered methods
    * Leaky-wave antennas
    * Plasma antennas which can electronically appear and disappear
    * Numerical methods in antenna modeling using time, frequency, and conformal domain decomposition methods
