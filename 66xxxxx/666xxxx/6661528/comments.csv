,sev_on_tpb,2011-12-05T10:15Z,What about installing the audio driver?  Will that trigger the same thing as an update?
,mzisette,2012-03-06T01:28Z,"Can anyone pre-crack this? I need an admin pass to make a change to it. I don't want to ask my parents because they'll get ticked that i'm ""downloading viruses and stuff"". I would greatly appreciate it!

And yes, my parents are complete electronic idiots."
,totodelanegra,2012-03-21T22:29Z,"Regarding the question about the audio driver. Yes, do not install or you will end up having a demo version."
