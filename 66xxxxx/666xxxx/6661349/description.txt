Mass Surveillance and State Control: The Total Information Awareness Project

A global system of mass, warrantless, government surveillance now imperils privacy and other civil liberties essential to sustaining the free world. This project to unilaterally, totally control information flow is a product of complex, ongoing interplay between technological, political, legal, corporate, economic, and social factors, including research and development of advanced, digital technologies; an unremitting â€œwar on terrorâ€; relaxed surveillance laws; government alliances with information technology companies; mass media manipulation; and corporate globalism. This book details these and other factors contributing to this degenerative trend; specifies recommendations for constructive change; and provides a platform for grassroots efforts to stop the decline before it is too late.
