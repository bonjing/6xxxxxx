Absolutely everything you need to know as first or second camera assistant is here, of course and all the reference tables, film can labels and camera department reporting forms you are ever likely to see or need are here - along with an associated website that holds even more...The Camera Assistant's Manual is an essential in the ditty bag as gaffer tape and as useful to the DoP's as it is to camera assistants. It makes for a first class learning tool between assignments and my advice to camera assistants is, keep it covered when on the set. There's a whole camera department around you who will want to borrow it." - www.dvuser.co.uk

The text is supplemented with illustrations that convey Elkins' ideas, and the clarity with which he lays out the chronology of a film shoot is impressive - years of working and teaching have clearly allowed the author to hone his approach with military precision, and it's hard to think of any assistant armed with the book's checklists coming across a problem he or she would be unable to solve. -Jim Hemphill, American Cinematographer Magazine
