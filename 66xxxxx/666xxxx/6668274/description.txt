The hit mini series adaptation of Colleen McCullough's novel. Young, handsome Father Ralph de Bricassart surrenders to ambition when he accepts a bequest to the church from wealthy matriarch Mary Carson. The legacy advances Father de Bricassart to the upper echelons of church hierarchy, but it denies Mary's heirs of their rightful fortune - and ties Mary's granddaughter, Meggie, to the priest. Meggie grows into a stunningly beautiful woman, and Father de Bricassart suffers the temptation of a woman he is not allowed--and cannot leave. Together, the two share a secret passion that endures for decades and proves greater than even his faith and his love for the church.
