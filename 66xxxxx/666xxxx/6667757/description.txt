Very rare and OOP audiophile Japanese CD of the first disc in the Rolling Stones two-disc CD set, \\\"Hot Rocks,\\\" London POCD-1927. Mobile Fidelty Sound Labs did the mastering on this disc, and it is one of the best-sounding Stones\\\' recordings ever released. The disc appeared around 1990, and at that time, each disc in the\\\"Hot Rocks\\\" set was released separately. For some reason, MFSL did not master \\\"Hot Rocks 2\\\" in the Japanese set, and the sound on that is far-less impressive.
