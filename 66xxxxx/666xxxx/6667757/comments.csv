There is a whole lot of fidelity missing from these tracks. Listening to this release of (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction, at 8 seconds when the tambourine starts, it's barely noticeable. On the other 2 releases, it's very prominent.

The sound on this release is very muted and I had to increase the volume to equal the levels of the other 2 albums.

I'd suggest that anyone interested in downloading this search for an alternative version. I'm not gonna post a link to another site, but the SACD version is currently available if you know where to look.  "

The cut on this is a different recording (done at RCA's Hollywood studios as I recall) and in full stereo. The tambourine is not as prominent and the thing does sound different, but there is a clarity, presence and sense of space I have not heard in mono versions."
