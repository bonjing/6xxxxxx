@kardeck
Yes it auto saves in offline mode

@conor285
press ""Esc"" to close TPTP pop up...
If no desktop icon, then start game via ""TWOLauncher"" in ""TigerWoods12"" folder

note.: Play the game offline."

,u2r1,2011-09-24T16:10Z,i thought so
,N101,2011-09-24T22:02Z,"@u2r1

Sorry to read you could not get the game to work, but i got the game to work & thats why i previously posted.

I extracted using 7z... Ran the EA Sports / loader.bat
It didnt generate a desktop image for me, so i ran the game from the ""TWOLauncher"" in ""TigerWoods12"" folder


I would prefer to read posts thanking Shroo instead of the usual cheap insults most other people prefer to throw at one another but this is what happens when ungrateful people download for free... they throw BS back at others!"
,u2r1,2011-09-27T15:30Z,"erm for a start i did not insult any 1 
this did not work for me it may work for others  
if you cant read what i type
dont bother to reply@fed up with idiots like you bring other folk down"
,bullseye[0],2011-10-02T22:10Z,"u2r1 if you can explain in detail how your installing this game someone can help you. This RIP works fine your not doing it correctly. 
How are you extracting the game. Make sure your using 7-Zip (Right click on EASports.7z.001 file, Go to 7-Zip and extract to your favorite computer location.) Left click on the Loader.bat and game will start decompressing. Take your time.  
"
,u2r1,2011-10-07T10:53Z,"bullseye[0] @your a noob
i already explain it
if you dont understand it dont reply and insult me - or yeh get reported"
,garaboldi1,2011-10-12T02:22Z,doesnt everyone use winrar not 7z
,Smili619,2011-10-23T15:08Z,"Okay i may be being really stupid but i cant find "" EA Sports \ Loader.bat "" anywhere can someone help? "
,pnoku,2011-12-04T11:45Z,"dimwits.
what _u2r1_ is trying to say is he couldn't get past Origin. more than 3/4 of the game's features are enabled only if we could play it on/via Origin.
Drink up your Mountain Dew."
,damienstocklen,2011-12-15T23:36Z,go to run the EA Sports \ Loader.bat and its says its not a valid win 32 application. help?
,rindy35,2012-02-01T06:54Z,downloaded the game. dont know what to do from here... tried following the instructions but to no avail :( please help!!!
