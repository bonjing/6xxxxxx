

Raw transport stream capture of Adventure Time with Fionna and Cake.
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2004450/

Video: MPG2 1920x1080 29.97fps
Audio: Dolby AC3 48000Hz 6ch [Actually 2.1 with 3 dummy channels]

I tried using Avidemux to resize/convert/deinterlace this with Xvid and x264, but
the sound went spastic every time [in and back out of sync twice in 11 min?].
I hope someone out there has the right software and skills to 
resize/convert/deinterlace and sync it.
Plays as is with MediaPlayerClassic on my PC [haven't tried others] so if you don't
mind the ridiculous size you can DL this one. You will probably notice the
interlace combing.
