Cooley is a great vocalist and a helluva nice guy to boot....But there is a misnomer in the header. The guitar work on this smokin' platter is non other than that Strat Slingin' Wunderkid Mr. Robert Jankow. An incredibly underrated guitarist, who's been kickin' 'round the Detroit music scene for the better part of 40 years! He and Cooley are working together again and you can bet yer bottom that they'll put together more magic in the near future. Do yourself a favor and snatch up this 'lil gem and see these guys whenever,and wherever you can! They are a blast live!
