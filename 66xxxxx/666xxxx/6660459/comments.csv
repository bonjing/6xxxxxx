it also requires UAC disabled or admin priviledges to run properly as the configuation file is stored in the installation folder not in a seperate folder in the appdata location it is usually stored in 

even though it scans clean and seems to run fine

I would suggest people wait for another release"

This in fact does not run fine , gives error on every file played

Very problematic and not worth downloading"
