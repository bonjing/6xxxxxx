Bad Company - Live At Wembley

British hard rock/classic rock band Bad Company has been around since the mid seventies and has released many albums since then.
Well now Bad Company is back with a live performance concert and will be available on cd/dvd/blu-ray and will be released on June 28, 2011.
Hereâ€™s the press release:

New York, NY (June 14, 2011)â€”When legendary classic rockers Bad Company performed at the historic British venue Wembley Arena in London
on a beautiful April 2010 spring night, high-definition cameras captured the whole evening in all its glory.
On June 28, Eagle Rock Entertainment will release Live At Wembley simultaneously on DVD, Blu-Ray & CD, through its Eagle Vision & Eagle Records imprints
There was magic in the air as all three original Bad Company membersâ€”vocalist extraordinaire Paul Rodgers, guitarist Mick Ralphs, and drummer
Simon Kirkeâ€”are augmented by bassist Lynn Sorensen and guitarist Howard Leese. (Original bassist Boz Burrell died in 2006).
The set list is packed with every major hit, fan favorites and seldom-heard deep album cuts. The DVD and Blu-Ray includes a band interview.
Bad Company burst upon the rockâ€™nâ€™roll scene in 1973, and was immediately dubbed a super-group by fans and press alike, as its members
all came from very successful popular bands: Free (Rodgers and Kirke), Mott The Hoople (Ralphs) and King Crimson (Burrell).
They lived up to the hype for nine straight years with a string of six soulful hard-rocking albums.
After a four-year break, they got back together minus Rodgers (who had formed The Firm with Jimmy Page). Rodgers returned in 1999.
