,smilisav,2011-10-05T18:16Z,"I have ADSL2+ 2MB. Usual download speed above 200kB/sec. Sometimes I don't have time to seed and I apologize. (About 10-15% of my leeching was never covered by seeding.)
This one I download at average speed of 9kB/sec and right now I have ratio of 2.836. Few times I saw speed 112kB/sec, but all in all, for now  I received 1.97GB in 3 days. Use uTorrent 3.0 and now see 13(113) seeds and 67(550) peers.
Any advices? Thanks in advance."
,smilisav,2011-10-08T11:24Z,"Latest update: Today, after 6 days, I received 3.11GB
Thanks, I quit.
I don't download much, maybe 700MB per month, but according to my last experiences (during 2011) Torrent community slowly dies.
I will download my beloved Voyager from some video site, using some ""YouTube Downloader"".
Good luck, ppl."

,DotFrog42,2012-01-30T20:04Z,"""Supernatural is boring""?  Supernatural is the only show on that list worth watching.  Jesus fucking Christ, so much for helping seed your torrent, you tasteless idiot.  "
,MyFootHurts,2012-02-23T09:34Z,"Only issue: the season 3 episodes displaced and worst case scenario are in the wrong order, Displaced is ep 24 and worst case is ep 25. Doesn't really matter though there isn't really any story arc disrupted by watching those 2 in the wrong order."
,RickyTheFish,2012-03-18T16:38Z,"@white03j: The MKV extension is a Matroska file; I know for sure VLC player can play it. I don't know if vanilla VLC can play MKV, you might have to get the K-Lite Codec Pack, but I know VLC can definitely play the files because that's what I've been using.

If, for some crazy reason, you don't like VLC, it's possible to play MKV files with SMPlayer and DivX Plus Player. I'm sure there are more that work, but those are the ones that work for me personally."
,dustin903,2012-03-19T12:42Z,il seed this from my seedbox when it finishes downloading
,dustin903,2012-03-19T12:48Z,"please seed, I on on a 10Gb/s connection and I am only downloading at 400k, I usually go at like 20MB/s minimum."
,dustin903,2012-03-19T18:43Z,If you want to download this faster just send me an email at justdustin902 {at} yahoo.com and I will send you a link for faster download
