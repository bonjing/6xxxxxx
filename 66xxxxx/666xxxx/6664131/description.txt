  Men of War: Vietnam is a new game for the critically acclaimed series. The
  new, story-driven campaign lets you taste the explosive mix of the jungle,
  Hueys and rock-n-roll in 1968. The US campaign focuses on a team of elite
  special ops soldiers, and each one of them has a personality. The unit
  includes Sergeant John Merrill, machinegunner Jim Walsh, sniper Sonny
  Armstrong, grenade launcher operator Carl Dillan and combat engineer Bill
  Kirby. In some missions they can count only on themselves, while in the
  others they act together with regular US and South-Vietnamese troops. The
  North Vietnam campaign tells the story of two Soviet military consultants
  and two soldiers of the North Vietnam Army who are the only survivors of an
  ambush prepared by the US troops. The task of getting back to the North
  Vietnam territory is a difficult one - they have no means of radio
  communication, no wheeled vehicles, and it's too far to make it there on
  foot. On their way these survivors get involved in a chain of bloodbath
  engagements and find themselves in the dead center of the well-known Tet
  offensive. Missions range from special operations (rescuing a shot-down
  pilot, escorting a reporter, etc.) to full scale battles.
  Key features:
  *  There are two sides in every story, so two new story-driven campaigns
     attempt to show the war from both sides.
  *  Breathtaking missions including an ambush on the Ho Chi Minh trail, a
     game of cat and mouse in the Mekong Delta, raids into Cambodia and Laos,
     bridge defense during the Tet offensive and more.
  *  New weapons and units: M-16, T-54, M-113, Patton III, M-60, AK-47, M-14,
     RPG-2, M-72 LAW, RPK and many more.
  *  Multiplayer mode - co-op for up to 4 players.
