In this definitive biography of Tsar Nicholas II and his wife, Alexandra, Robert K. Massie sweeps readers back to the extraordinary world of Imperial Russia to tell the story of the Romanovsâ€™ lives: Nicholasâ€™s political naÃ¯vetÃ©, Alexandraâ€™s obsession with the corrupt mystic Rasputin, and little Alexisâ€™s brave struggle with hemophilia. Against a lavish backdrop of luxury and intrigue, Massie unfolds a powerful drama of passion and historyâ€”the story of a doomed empire and the death-marked royals who watched it crumble.
