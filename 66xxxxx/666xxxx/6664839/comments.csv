,poppy8700,2011-09-10T13:21Z,WIP or retail ?
,ExiledXbot,2011-09-10T14:40Z,"On an unrelated note, can any body put up a torrent for Monkey Island Special Edition Collection XBOX360(PAL) Please. Thanks in advance."
,chrome50ae,2011-09-10T14:41Z,its retail people :)
,Lobyone,2011-09-10T16:22Z,so i guess gears of war is XGD3 format then? we wont see an ISO until c4eva released 2.0
,chrome50ae,2011-09-10T17:29Z,mines just finished and im testing it out now. will update
,sleeperreaper,2011-09-10T22:01Z,can somebody seed.  was going great until now where i'm only getting .5 kB/s :/
,TGOD_ROB,2011-09-10T22:57Z,How do i burn this using imgburn and utorrent?
,tyshady,2011-09-10T23:07Z,"if this is a retail then why is it a jtag 
:/"
,bball230,2011-09-11T01:03Z,"i kinda doubt this is the final retail... why is this the only one? you would think people would be talking about this all over the place that it is XGD3.. and i have heard nothing. 

so can someone please confirm what the heck this is?"
,ssabotage,2011-09-11T01:13Z,"It's retail meaning the file was taken from a retail disc and is not the developers copy, however, the disc is in XGD3 format so there is no known way yet to be able to rip this to be able to burn it to disc. This is why you can only play this on JTAG consoles which read games from external hard drives rather than discs."
,fanfasnight,2011-09-11T01:26Z,Becuase the iso wont work
,chrome50ae,2011-09-11T06:56Z,After pplaying for some hours I can confirm it is retail and plays great! jtag only though fellas.
,mattee91,2011-09-11T07:37Z,so this is working on a LT xbox?
,Otaku1,2011-09-11T08:22Z,"Yo masi50 can you please seed this, been stuck on 24.8% for hours.  I downloaded Driver San Francisco off of you thanks so I trust this is the real deal."
,FLAMinEK,2011-09-12T13:51Z,my hdd1 is full (and god games only boot from hdd1) so i god2iso the 4D5308AB and then ripped the resulting iso to raw file format to boot it from my ext usb hdd.
,gizzmo,2011-09-12T20:42Z,GOD does run from external HDD but yo must install FSD.
,twistquist,2011-09-13T06:39Z,"People need to stop using so many abbreviations in the comment section, I'm confused and my head is gonna cave in.


Somebody should post a tutorial on how to get this to work for retard noobs like me."
,ricky006,2011-09-13T07:51Z,"Please SEED people , No seeds for the last 2 days now ? stuck at 58 %"
,HawkguyTK,2011-09-13T22:51Z,"@twistquist, JTAG stand for 

Just 
The 
Awesome 
Gamers

So I guess you can't play because your not awesome like the rest of us."
,Lobyone,2011-09-14T03:12Z,hmmm... i have an old hitachi... non ap 2.5... im wondering if i use GOD to ISO and burn to a disc if it will work. but im not sure LT+ 1.1 supports xgd3
,D3FEKT,2011-09-14T03:27Z,"great stuck at 70% >:(  Seed people!

,brock1384,2011-09-14T16:43Z,Looks like alot of people are gonna have to spend $60 for this game including me :(
,gymrat780,2011-09-14T17:47Z,Is this jtag or will this work on flashed (newest one) 360?
,impact_,2011-09-14T18:45Z,That wont work for me on my JTAG. Drive SF was also XGD3 and i copied to an external drive and started it via FSD w/o problems. But this here cannot be started by any kind.
,ricky006,2011-09-14T22:21Z,"Ok , plenty seeders now , Thanx everybody "
,twistquist,2011-09-15T02:58Z,"@ HawkgayBJ


Its okay kid, I already have a real copy now ;)

Enjoy your shit pirated copy."
,carmelo7,2011-09-17T16:21Z,Question to someone who already download it: are there polish subtitles ? And WHAT THE FUCK means jtag ?
,oren230,2011-09-18T17:31Z,carmelo7: jtag means that you can play this download only from the hdd and no dvd burn available .you need a jtag fix to your console to play it and it is a pain in the ass to do that.just wait for the dvd version like most of us here.
,hentai66666666,2011-09-19T14:35Z,"works like magic , if you got yourself a jtag, and an internal + an external hdd for game storage 

your all set

i always keep my , god/extracted iso 

folders there due to larger storage xD

lets party!!

p.s: btw the 3rd part rocks!!playing the hell out of it atm, and tons better than the leaked build that came out several months ago xD"
,DoodleBop,2011-09-20T03:03Z,"Why is the Jtag out first anyway ? o_O
I guess we'll see many DVD torrent flourish tomorrow. Well, i can wait 24 hours more. ;)"
,DoodleBop,2011-09-20T03:06Z,"twistquist > congrats, you're a douche. You just made Microsoft more richer."
,omfgipwnedunoobs,2011-09-20T08:55Z,"For those waiting for non jtag version you might be waiting a while, I'd be very surprised if microsoft didn't use the XDG3 format on one of their biggest titles of the year"
,john4551,2011-09-20T13:40Z,can you get gears of war 3 no jtag
,TGOD_ROB,2011-09-20T14:10Z,GET GOW 3 NO JTAG OR I THINK IM GONNA KNOCK YOU OUT BRO !!!!!!

,LIlweedkila510,2011-09-20T22:00Z,When is someone going to upload gears 3.. or someone let me know how and ill do the honors 
,omfgipwnedunoobs,2011-09-21T01:57Z,There will be NO non-jtag version of gears your only choices are get a jtag console or buy the game. This game uses the new disc format XDG3.
,hentai66666666,2011-09-21T08:37Z,actually didnt want to say anything but ...oh well you already did xD
