Why? There's no corroboration of the existence of Jesus of Nazareth. Plenty of historical records, but no Jesus, no Nazareth even. This is a fairy tale. But haters gonna hate and believers gonna believe. Have fun avoiding sin, eh?"

It is not a surprise but the Lord is waiting patiently to you guys. Just take a step and He will draw near to you. Let Him fix you and that will be the most important decision that you will be making for your whole life!"
