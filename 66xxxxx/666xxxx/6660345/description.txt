George R. R. Martin - A Song of Ice and Fire - Audio books 1 - 5 plus extras.

It was a hassle to organise these myself, so now I did it and here they are for your convenience!

This is a collection of chapterised audio files complete with tags and matching good quality cover art for the series.

The files are organised into approximately audio-CD-length folders according to the number of CDs in the retail editions.

This description with more information is included as a plain text file.

Also include are e-books 1-5 in .epub, .mobi and .pdf formats; maps, family trees & pictures (spoiler warning) from book 5; and three video files including an interview with the author about book 5.

All thanks due to the original uploaders.  For them, I haz a happy.  :)
