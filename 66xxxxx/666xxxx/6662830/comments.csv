,ndx689-,2011-09-14T21:49Z,"Your uploads are great quality and very much appreciated!

The only thing extra I could ask you to include in your descriptions in future is the aspect ratio.

Again... many thanks!"
,ndx689-,2011-09-14T21:54Z,"Oh... and whether the movie is PAL or NTSC format, which you've apparently accidently left out of some of the descriptions.

Top notch though in anycase!"
,stocks,2011-09-23T21:55Z,"Great Copy, thanks.  Although the storyline you've added kind of spoils the film for anyone who hasnt seen it....more or less tells you whats going to happen :-("
