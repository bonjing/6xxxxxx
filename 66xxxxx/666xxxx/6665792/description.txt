Plot: An unorthodox Irish policeman, Boyle (Brendan Gleeson) joins forces with a strait-laced FBI agent (Don Cheadle) to take on an international drug smuggling gang in Ireland's Connemara Gaeltacht.
A murder which appears to be the work of an occult serial killer is the first incident the relevance of which is then revealed by Boyle in a briefing by an FBI agent sent to liaise with the Gardai. A web of bribery, blackmail and killings ensues. Boyle and Everett form an unlikely alliance and with the unwitting help of the IRA bring about a bloody denouement.
