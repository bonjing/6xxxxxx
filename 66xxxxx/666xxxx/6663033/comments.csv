I've seen you have uploaded a lot of Bowie albums in DTS. But I wonder - what is the source for these recordings? 
DTS and DVD Audio as well has a sampling frequence at 96KHz which means the sound frequence is 48KHz. But I'm a little bit confused. Has all these Bowie albums really been released in the UK in SACD or DVD Audio with a sound frequence of 48KHz and a sampling frequence at 96KHz?
