I have no problem with avi, but when I try to do an mp4 file, I can burn it to the disc but it won't play on a dvd player or xbox 360. If someone could help me out and let me know how some of the other people here do it, I would appreciate it very much.  And YIFY thank you for this great upload. I been watching for this."
,rcr29budcar,2011-09-09T06:19Z,"Oh yeah, concerning my previous post, I have the same issue with .mkv and .mp4 files. I can burn them to a dvd, but they won't play on dvd player or 360.  Again, any help or advice would really be appreciated. Thank you."
,daveo76,2011-09-09T09:03Z,This isn't a 720p quality. Because for 720p it meant to be 2GB+ for each video size 
,Wesley_Gibson,2011-09-09T14:49Z,Thanks yify!
,PooPants,2011-09-09T21:56Z,I am deaf and thus rely on subtitles.  The subs for this are mangled (only a small portion of them in the file) or missing completely.  Can you link to the proper files?  Awesome uploads as always.
,Ki1l4U,2011-09-10T06:35Z,"Thanks for uploading the bluray version I thought it would be a while so I already got your hdtv version, now I have to get this instead."

,Dashman666,2012-03-07T14:54Z,Thanks for the Movies!  And if you need to burn the mp4's and other files to DVD get the program ConvertXtoDVD!  Great Program!
,Sagiy20,2012-04-01T06:06Z,"OMG, what a crappy quality.

YIFY, you should have went with the 1.0kbps audio quality instead of the holy 48kbps or whatever you had there...
Would have been much less crappy that way... then I could put the movie on mute and enjoy the mediocre picture quality. :""/"
