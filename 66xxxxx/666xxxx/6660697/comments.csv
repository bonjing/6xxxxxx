,bookworm1960,2011-09-09T22:08Z,"Will this keep the original video width/height and the sound quality when converting from MKV to AVI?
I don't care if the final file size reaches 6 gigs, or even larger, I have ISOs and video_ts folders that are that size.
I don't know why, but my PC doesn't play MKV, M2TS, or MP4 files very well, not even with the latest codec pack installed."
