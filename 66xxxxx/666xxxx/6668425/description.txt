Movies : Crime : VHS Rip : English
This is a re-do of a previous torrent with many flickers. Switched out vhs units and got much better results. Picture quality is a little lacking but that is in the source also, very watchable now.

the Dead End Kids & the Little Tough Guys 1943 Keep 'Em Slugging

A WWII era movie mixed with a little crime, stir well.

Mary Gordon plays the part of the mom, which she did in several of the boys' films, she is my favorite.
