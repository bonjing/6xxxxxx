Thanks for the upload.
I will seed it for another week...."

DTS is NOT compatible if you plug your usb hdd directly on the TV, don't panic, just use this tool http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKV2AC3 and it will remove the DTS from the movie!
I takes around 20 min to get the work done, but it does an amazing one! Good luck LG 3DTV users!"
