,Phatfish,2011-09-09T22:45Z,I hope this will not have the same annoying missing frames/wrong framerate like most other vodrips...
,Phatfish,2011-09-10T02:08Z,"Same shit as all other Vodrips. What's like the deal? 
I'm surprised people dont seam to notice.

Anyway, thanks for the upload."
,CScott619,2011-09-10T04:27Z,"Thanks for the upload. I saw a screening for this nearly 2 years ago and I have been waiting for what seems like an eternity for this to be released. I know it's not a perfect copy, what with the glitches and all, but it's free, it's viewable and it's Bunraku. So thanks again and keep up the great work. "
,Nash6989,2011-09-10T11:08Z,is this as awesome as it looks? lol only one way to find out.

Audio is screwy, it comes and goes out of sync, gets really bad towards the end.

Still, a cool movie."
,allan46,2011-09-10T17:56Z,Audio goes out of sync
,onryou74,2011-09-10T19:01Z,"This movie, not quality of A/V, just the movie itself, is complete shite. I feel embarrassed for anyone who collected a paycheck making it. Very reminiscent of Dick Tracy, Bat-Man, and The Punisher movie with Dolph Lundgren; bad comic book movies from the last century. 

Audio is shite the last half hour of this movie. "
,NitLions,2011-09-11T01:49Z,"I think its a pretty cool movie actually, but ya the audio is just awful and it gets worse as it goes along"
,a3sir,2011-09-15T06:42Z,"v:8
A:4

Out of synch in the end..comes and goes"
