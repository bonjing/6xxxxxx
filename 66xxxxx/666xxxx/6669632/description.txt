Maroon 5â€™s latest album â€œHands All Overâ€ is filled with the catchy pop rock tunes that they are so well known for. This album contains the best elements we saw in their previous albums: pretty and melodic tunes with almost reggae-happy drum beats in some songs, with cleverly written lyrics with sugar and spice hidden meanings.

Some of the better songs in this album would be the album titled song â€œHands All Overâ€, as well as others such as â€œStutterâ€, which is guaranteed to get stuck in your head and have you singing along all day.
