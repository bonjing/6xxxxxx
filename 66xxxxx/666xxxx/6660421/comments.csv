,skygear,2011-09-13T10:01Z,"all the USA regions besides the SouthCentral are released... if your looking for other places like Canada, Mexico, Australia, Europe, etc. might want to check a few of the gps forums, 

i hear http://gpsunderground.com/forum/gps-navigation-systems/garmin-gps-systems/garmin-maps/ is a great place for interesting things"
,skygear,2011-09-13T10:03Z,"also, if you search on thepiratebay (here) for (garmin topo) or (garmin) you come up with some nice hits"
