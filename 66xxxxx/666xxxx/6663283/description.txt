Long ago an evil overlord wreaked havoc upon the world with its 3 demon 
golems. When all seemed doomed a powerful wizard sealed the overlord into 
a dark sword. Without its master the 3 golems stood as statues for centuries. 
Now they are active again, and in order to stop them a young man must sell 
his soul to an evil overlord. Will we be able to save the world and his soul?
