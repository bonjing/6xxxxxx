Street Angel #1 - 5 [SLG]

*** REQUESTED ***

In this irreverent graphic novel full of snarky humor, homeless, street-smart teenager Jesse "Street Angel" Sanchez uses her skill with a skateboard and her martial arts prowess to fight ninja gangs, evil geologists, nepotism, homework, and hunger, with her sidekick, Bald Eagle. The stories aren't for the fainthearted, but the book delivers a hilarious send-up of everything from religion to superheroes. The writing is sharp, witty, and riddled with teenage angst--even as it lampoons the idea. The art is deceptively simple: the high-contrast, black-and-white work appears stark at first glance, but upon closer examination reveals a depth that is startlingly poignant in some stories and fabulously over-the-top in others.
