A member of the Energy Therapies family - which includes, acupuncture, acupressure and shiatsu - Emotional Freedom Technique is a simple and increasingly popular self- development therapy used to treat a wide range of physical and emotional issues. Popularised by figures including Paul McKenna, EFT is based on the theory that negative emotions are caused by disturbances in the body's energy. Often referred to as acupuncture without needles, EFT involves locating and tapping on meridian points in the body while thinking of a negative emotion and using positive suggestion and thoughts to alter the body's energy flow, restore balance and reprogram thought processes.

This no-nonsense guide introduces readers to the theories and methods behind the technique and shows them how to use it to reduce the physical and emotional impact of a wide range of issues including, depression, fears, phobias, anger, addictions, sleeplessness and pain. It's simple, safe, anyone can practice it at home and with EFT For Dummies readers can banish bad habits for good.
