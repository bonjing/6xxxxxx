This build adds support for multichannel audio output on PS3 (AC-3, DTS and 8 channel
linear PCM). Note that due to how the PS3 audio frameworks applications can not output
raw digital bitstreams. So Showtime still needs to decode the audio and than the PS3 will
reencode the audio in the best available encoding mode the user has selected (or don't do any
encoding at all if 8 channel PCM is available)
