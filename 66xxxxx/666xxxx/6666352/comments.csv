,DJBigal,2011-09-11T00:58Z,Excellent quality except for songs 1 and 2 at  128 kbps ...
,JTPDynasty,2011-09-11T01:26Z,No. They are all 320kbps. I just double checked.
,slipknot342,2011-09-12T22:37Z,"Dude, he's right.  Yes, track 1 and 2 say they are 320, but they sound like shit so I believe they are transcoded."
,JTPDynasty,2011-09-13T01:06Z,"If you don't like it then find them somewhere else. They sound perfectly fine. Those 2 are all over the internet, find the ones that fit your deaf ears..."
,HMD3,2011-09-13T15:37Z,"So far, this is the only torrent of this that is actually 320, so thanks uploader for knowing what you're doing and being honest. :). There are a few other torrents claiming to be 320 that aren't. I hate when people are ignorant or just lying.  & @DJBigal 1-2 are not 128, even if, they were released as singles easy to find in 320, but the tags might be goofed, foobar will fix it, and make windows report the bitrae properly. Just load the songs into foobar, right click -> tagging -> then uncheck the boxes for ID3 and check the box for ape, then do the process in reverse."
,HMD3,2011-09-13T15:44Z,"Ok, ya 1-2 don't sound quite as good as the rest of the tracks, but they still don't sound bad. I had the 2 singles already which sound better, so I juast tossed those in. Still, thanks for being the only true 320 out there so far."
,JTPDynasty,2011-09-14T00:18Z,"You're welcome. The first two don't seem to sound as good as the rest, but they're good and I can't find ones that are much better. But now that the album is officially released, I'll look for the first two tracks CD ripped and maybe delete this torrent and re-upload."
,DoctorMadcow,2011-09-15T00:06Z,No Complaints dude. This is an awesome torrent. Thank you uploader!!!!
,JTPDynasty,2011-09-15T00:20Z,"You're welcome. I found better first two tracks, but I can't post a link to download... Should I risk deleting this torrent and re-uploading with the first two tracks updated?"
,JTPDynasty,2011-09-15T00:21Z,"Nevermind, download these first two tracks of this album and let me know if they sound better than the ones in this torrent:

,JTPDynasty,2011-09-15T04:13Z,"Please download the updated one instead:
