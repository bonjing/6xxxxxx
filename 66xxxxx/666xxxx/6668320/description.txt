Torrent contains all Naruto episodes from episode 1 - 220.
Episodes are divided into different folders, based on season.
All episodes are .AVI.
Every episode is Japanese dubbed with English subs.
Also, every episode is named this way: Naruto - ... (replace dots with episode number) episode numbers always consists of 3 numbers.

Due to the size of the torrent, I would really appreciate it if you could help me seed it.
My upload limit is 1MB/s, and I will try to upload at that speed 24/7.
Right now I'm also uploading all One Piece episodes, so I probably can't upload @ 1MB/s all the time.

Please help me seed it after you finished downloading, and at least try to get a ratio of 1.

Enjoy!
