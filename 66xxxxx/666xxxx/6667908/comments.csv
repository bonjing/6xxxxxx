,XApathyX,2011-09-13T12:44Z,"Not that I'm ungrateful here, but why are these coming in so late?"
,houseofswing,2011-09-14T02:20Z,please need sept 10th show
,XApathyX,2011-09-14T12:19Z,There is no September 10th episode. The 9th was the last one from last week. They're missing the first one from this week. The newest one uploaded has the date wrong.
,XApathyX,2011-09-14T12:28Z,"Allow me to correct myself here.
The one that was just uploaded should have been titled ""Craig.Ferguson.2011.09.12.Lauren.Graham"", not ""Craig.Ferguson.2011.09.13.Lauren.Graham""..
September 13th would actually be Tuesdays episode, not Monday.
The 10th and 11th were weekends and the show doesn't air on weekends."
,XApathyX,2011-09-14T12:30Z,I would also like to make sure everyone knows that I am really grateful that people are taking the time to record these shows and put them up for my viewing pleasures :D. I really am grateful for that :)
,XApathyX,2011-09-14T13:05Z,I was corrected on another site and the title does have the correct date. My apologies to all. Keep up the great work :)
