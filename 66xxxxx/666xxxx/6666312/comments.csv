,tatskey_a,2011-09-11T03:50Z,"don't be selfish now. I assume most, if not all of us downloading this are United fans. those who managed to download the fine completely have to seed for the rest of us. come on now."
,fall1en,2011-09-11T07:38Z,lol at people asking for seeders! You really think that works? You noobs need to learn to be patient.

,Grabbulla,2011-09-12T01:50Z,"I'd certainly like some pre-game talk up, post game I'm not as interested in. Isn't it possible to do the pre and post parts as separate files to make it choosable when downloading to fit everyone's ""needs"".

Thanks alot and please keep uploading the MU games throughout the season!"
