This is actually a converted version from .rmvb to .avi. This is because there's an .srt file that comes with it, and real player doesn't welcome .srt files. The original upload is credited to  JamesKees. So a special thanks to  JamesKees and all of his contributions to allowing us to watch these Martial Arts flix from his massive collection. 

My first upload, so I hope you enjoy (and hope I did this right).
