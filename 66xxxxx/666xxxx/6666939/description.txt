         Texas (1-0) opened the season with a convincing 34-9          
         win over Rice, but the Longhorns have lost two previous       
         meetings with BYU (1-0), which only allowed 208 total         
         yards in a 14-13 win over Ole Miss last week; BYU won last    
          meeting, 47-6, in 1988.
