Sad to see the last Torchwood episode though.  Maybe series 5?  Back on BBC too, this Starz crap sucks."
,DngnRdr,2011-09-10T06:58Z,"Yeah.. first couple of eps and last couple.. great TV. Unfortunately the six eps in between were a grind to watch... would have been better as three eps, the whole series being about six episodes rather than ten."
,wb21,2011-09-10T09:22Z,"Yeah, this series has taken a step down the ladder recently... Be good to see them bossing the police around cardiff in a repaired Torchwood HQ underneath the pavement"
,catfly,2011-09-10T10:08Z,its been crap. heard the last 2 eps are good tho so i'm here givin it another chance. fingers crossed. Much thanks VTV :)
,snilloc,2011-09-10T11:46Z,"+1  Many thanks

1st class copy as usual "
,Paydayyy,2011-09-10T14:44Z,I love this show & the temporary changes this season has provided. I'm more excited to see what challenges RTD has for us next season.
,Paydayyy,2011-09-10T14:46Z,ohh Akira1422 the show is on BBC & Stars this season. lol
,MrE159357,2011-09-10T15:06Z,"Talk, Talk, Talk, oh wait, it's the last episode?  Action!
This is the reason most American series fail.  Eight independent writers all working at the same time with little overlapping story, or direction.  Series 4 is so bad, anyone could die and I would have a hard time caring.  Series 5?  Not bloody likely.

VTV - Thanks again mate!"
,Mantrhax,2011-09-10T16:31Z,Stop this gay shit in torchwood and perhaps it get better
,akira1422,2011-09-10T18:52Z,lol @ Manthrax the homophobic piece of shit complaining about gay scenes in a show made by a gay man.
,ShamboMambo,2011-09-10T21:39Z,This is just a bunch of British bum-gay faggot shit. Filthy disgusting pooves should be hanged by thier balls until dead. All fucking child molesting queers should die.
,smartchick_95,2011-09-11T02:22Z,"get a life shambo. nothing wrong with gays.
thx for upload vtv."
,bob8164,2011-09-11T05:40Z,"don't drop any soap in the showerroom, shambo, because no one will care. Thanks for the great download, VTV."
,madsam31,2011-09-11T07:54Z,"Great download and super fast, 500mb/s +"
,ShamboMambo,2011-09-12T03:00Z,The BBC is run by faggots. Bum-Gay homo cocksuckers control Dr. Who. The producer is a disgusting poove. Torchwood is a disgraceful orgy of shitstabbing. Russell T. Davies is a disgusting filthy poove!
,McCoyReal,2011-09-12T11:35Z,"@ShamboMambo: and YET, you've obviously come here to download his show. Why don't you just grow up and admit to yourself that you are gay? Nothing worse than the self-hating homophobes... Fek off & EABOD."
,Sattori,2011-09-12T19:53Z,"This episode was better than the last ones. But they should cut this ""three families"" crap. That was pretty boring. But I fear they will push them toward a 5th season. "
,ShamboMambo,2011-09-12T21:59Z,This is bum-gay faggotry. Only people that can stomach homo filth and buggery will enjoy this. The show runner of this made the Channel 4 series Queer As Folk. He is a disgusting poove.

,celtqueen,2011-09-14T07:07Z,"thanks VTV for your work, i do appreciate it. didn't even know there was a BBC series until this...now i'm watching the first three seasons. i like them all. can't believe there are so many of you that hate the Brits, doesn't even make sense - if not for Britain there'd be no US, dumbasses.  and all the ""fag"" hating is just ridiculous. why do u care so much how others live? if you don't like the ""fag shit"" don't dl the show, duh?"
