[V],TorrentTracts,2011-09-16T15:35Z,"You're right.  I didn't include those two 2011 releases in any of these fifteen Christian music torrent bundles.  But you can still download them, at your leisure, from the following links...

Deitrick Haddon - 2011 - Church On The Moon:

Kim Burrell - 2011 - The Love Album:

,soulmuziq,2011-09-16T22:53Z,"thank you so very much...i think i figured it out..if you happend to have the link for the nevels sisters and fred hammond,feel free "
,soulmuziq,2011-09-16T23:51Z,"what program do i use to download it,once i download it from the source you gave?i used utorrent n bitlord..it said not the right program to download it"
[V],TorrentTracts,2011-09-17T15:49Z,"For those two external links I gave you...

* visit each link one at a time
* find and click on gray ""slow download"" button
* notice the 30 second countdown timer that appears
* wait out the timer
* a captcha will then appear in place of the timer
* type in the captcha code, and once you type in the correct code
* you will be promoted to save the file

Now you have a .rar file on your computer.  That's a compressed file that needs to be decompressed before you can expose the .mp3 files.  So simply use a program like zip or winrar to decompress it.  Google it, if you don't already have it.  Once decompressed, you can start listening to the music.

Please let me know if this helps."
[V],TorrentTracts,2011-09-17T17:13Z,"The Nevels Sisters has a 2011 release, entitled ""Beautiful"".  But Fred Hammond, to my knowledge, hasn't produced anything since his 2010 ""Life In The World"" release."
