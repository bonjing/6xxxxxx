I'll download the whole thing though, and help seed."
,bookworm1960,2011-09-11T19:35Z,"Files:    2
LOL, of course I'll be downing the whole thing, the books are in an ISO!"
,MudShark,2011-09-11T21:25Z,"So what format is the file really in... !?
It's not a normal cd image."
,bookworm1960,2011-09-13T02:23Z,"It is NOT an industry-standard ISO file, none of my ISO apps can open this.
I deleted this junk."
,salah2005b,2011-09-13T11:02Z,"It says that the iso is corrupted when you try to burn it or even open it with any kind of software (deamont  winrarâŚ)
block size of the file is not right
This is junk"
,K2K,2011-09-13T11:16Z,"Why is everyone too stupid to read a readme?

You want to learn linux but you're unwilling to read the first  2 learns in a readme? I'll save y'all the trouble: give up now.

Fantastic collection in any case, an abundance of info. Thank you!"
,bookworm1960,2011-09-13T22:10Z,"@K2K Tell me why I, or anyone else, MUST get yet another app, just to handle a NON-STANDARD file calling itself an ISO.

Would a jpeg file be a jpeg if only one image app could open it? NO!!!

So when WinArchiver makes an app that breaks the cross-app useability of the ISO STANDARD, then the file is NOT an ISO file!"
