Colin Murray presents highlights from the day's two Premier League matches as well as a review of all the
 goals and talking points from Saturday's top-flight games. It is six years since Norwich and West Brom met 
in the Premier League - the Canaries edged a 3-2 victory that day but have lost three of the four subsequent 
Championship meetings. The day's other game sees Fulham host Blackburn Rovers at Craven Cottage - 
it was also 3-2 when those teams last met in March. A controversial last-minute penalty enabled Bobby Zamora 
to clinch victory for Fulham, which led to a red card for Rovers' defender Gael Givet, who was furious with referee 
Mark Clattenburg's decision to award a spot-kick.
