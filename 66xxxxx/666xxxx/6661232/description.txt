cartooning can be a lot more than just having fun drawing and creating
jokes. This â€œclassroom in a bookâ€ provides the aspiring cartoonist with a
practical means for creative self-discovery and the exploration of complex
ideas through the iconic visual language of comics.
You will get all the benefits of taking the cartooning course I teach,
minus the distractions of the instructorâ€™s monotonous, droning voice, chronic
absent-mindedness, soporific slideshows, and soul-crushing critiques. The
seemingly endless tangential exegeses, however, have been retained.
You will keep a sketchbook that will function as a journal for notes, observations,
experiences, memories, dreams, and anecdotes (and may even
serve as an â€œart objectâ€ in and of itself). You will then develop and translate
this material into various cartoon narratives, ranging from the simple construction
of one-panel â€œgagâ€ cartoons to a full-fledged multiple-page story.
All the while, you will be encouraged to experiment with the wide variety
of tools and media that can be used to create comics.
You will design characters, explore the various rhythms of storytelling
inherent in the cartooning language, and compose panels, pages, and
stories. The goal will be to move from rough ideas to initial sketches, and
then to use this booklet as a sort of â€œprocess-oriented workshopâ€ to refine
those sketches into finished pieces.
This instructional guide will focus as much on â€œwriting with picturesâ€ as
on developing ability in drawing.
