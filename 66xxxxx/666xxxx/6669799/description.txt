Werll guys, this is my first try to share something, so here is a 20 year old piece.

Drumclinic with Nicko McBrain of Iron Maiden from 1991

it is a .flv file and the video quality for that size is not good.

I wanna share it for Fans of Nicko for thei collections and drummer.

I sit on a remote Island in the Philippines, so my upload speed is VERY slow. might take a few hours.

So bear with me and enjoy.
