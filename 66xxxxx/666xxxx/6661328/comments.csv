Anyone who cant find any Mineshafter servers, check the page or add me on msn jake_bilbe@live.co.uk and I will give you an IP to join my personal server."

now i need to connect my account with my minecraft account 
but when i press on change nothing happens.
can you plz help me?"
,Konkor,2011-09-11T17:00Z,"When you click the change button the page should expand and show two new text boxes for a username and password. If you don't see these try using another web browser or pressing Ctrl+F5. If you see the two boxes but the Connect button doesn't do anything try another browser.

Hope this helps!"
