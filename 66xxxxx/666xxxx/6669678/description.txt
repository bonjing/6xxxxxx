Following his sell-out UK & European tour in 2010, and 2009â€™s UK top ten album Still So Far To Go - The Best Of Chris Rea, one of the UKâ€™s foremost singer-songwriters returns with his first new material in over ten years. The elaborate three-CD and two-DVD The Santo Spirito Project  includes a brand new studio album, featuring "Dancing My Blues Away", "Never Tie Me Down", "The Chance Of Love", "Rock & Roll Tonight", "Electric Guitar" and "The Last Open Road".

Additionally, The Santo Spirito Project features two bespoke feature films on DVD, written and directed by Chris. The first feature is a raw and brutally honest chronicle on bullfighting, featuring neo-classical and Spanish-themed gypsy music. The second feature follows a man on a search for the truth in the city of Florence, a journey he may or may not wish he began. The soundtrack for both films is featured on two CDs. Here, Chris explains his rationale for such an ambitious project:

"I love creating things and passionately believe artists should be looking to try new ways of bringing what we do to the public. There should be no rules whatsoever and, for Godâ€™s sake, there are alternatives to TV talent shows. Sometimes, those who have had extremely good fortune in music allow only X Factor type TV shows to set the musical and cultural agenda of this country by actually doing nothing new or different themselves.
