He has been the driving force behind the craftâ€™s resurgence, and his technical knowledge, design skills, and ability to instruct remain unequalled. One by one, with the aid of color photographs, he covers tools and materials, the best woods, holding and sharpening chip carving knives, and laying out and transferring patterns. Borders, grids, rosettes, free-form design, positive image design, and lettering all receive separate, in-depth chapters, as does Bartonâ€™s special, time-tested hints.
