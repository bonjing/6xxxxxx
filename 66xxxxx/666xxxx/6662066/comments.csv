This download may work for you, but it failed my test badly. I just uploaded my third and Final version of this torrent and I have more faith in it working than the first two.

 If you have problems with this torrent then please try the NEW TORRENT (and Final) at:

Sorry for the trouble but this recording is worth it."

,XxM24Ty,2011-09-09T19:29Z,"Disregard my last comment......

 as it was mean for a different torrent. (lack of sleep). This torrent should be fine. Please advise if there are any problems with it."
