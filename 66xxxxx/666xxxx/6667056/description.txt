Bernstein provides a unique and wonderful look at America's original artform, jazz. In contrast to traditional, chronological approaches, Bernstein breaks down the musical components of jazz such as rhythm, melody, and harmony, and discusses the way they are used differently in comparison with Western European musics. Bernstein has a knack for discussing complex material and stating it in a way that all can understand. An excellent CD for those just getting into jazz, jazz enthusiasts, and music educators.
