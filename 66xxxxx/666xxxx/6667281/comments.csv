,daMouse,2011-09-11T21:23Z,"The game can be tweaked a lot by modifying the file ""default_levels.xml"". Shouldn't be necessary to hack the code after that. Google for more information.  (also FOV and mouse tweaks are possible)"

,cms3717,2011-10-05T09:02Z,"Works just as its supposed to after you apply the update, You WILL loose your save game, But you can chapter select and get kinda close where you left off. If it's not working don't post pissy comments just because your not smart enough to figure it out. "
