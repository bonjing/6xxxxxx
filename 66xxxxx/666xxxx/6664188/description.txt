"The Benefit of Putting in the Work"

Ben (Ryan Hansen) asks Aaron (Zachary Cregger) to 
invest in a macaroni & cheese food truck idea but 
Ben 's business proves to be a problematic 
investment. Elsewhere, Sarah (Danneel Ackles) dates a 
cute journalist on antidepressants, which makes 
physical contact very challenging. Riley (Jessica 
Lucas) helps Fitz (Andre Holland) become number one 
on Chicago's most doable bachelor list after 
researching the current number one bachelor.

18/Slow
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
