Setting up her camp somewhere between the beach and the jazz club, Zee Avi croons her way through another batch of relaxed, tropical songs on her second album. Ghostbird picks up where her debut left off, highlighting Avis voice and globe-trotting influences. But for all its worldly context, Ghostbird still wears its heritage lightly, placing more focus on the breezy songs themselves than the singers dual citizenship. The arrangements follow suit; theyre detailed and gorgeous, but they rarely overwhelm the music theyre meant to support, even at their most ornate. Ghostbird is a summer album for adventurous folk fans, engaging on its first run-thru but packed with enough twists and turns to warrant repeated listens.
