Get your dancing shoes on as Steve Wright and the TOTP-2 team take you back to the

It's 30 years since Saturday Night Fever and the BeeGees are here in all their glory,
alongside camp classics from Gloria Gaynor, Liquid Gold, Sylvester, The Village People, The
Weather Girls and The Three Degrees.

Then there's classic dance fodder from Chic, George McCrae, Hi-Tension, Heatwave, the
JALN Band, Earth Wind and Fire, Tina Charles, The Gibson Brothers and Edwin Starr.

Plus, disco pop from Blondie, Yazz, Boney M and Linx, while Sophie Ellis Bextor and Infernal
