First, learn to spellcheck yourself.
Second, stop trying to act hard online, we all know you're a skinny little punk who couldn't fight off a grandma.
Third, if you don't like something or someone here, keep it to your ignorant self, all you're going to do is keep posting immature comments and have people laugh at you.\
This may not concern you, you know you're able to hide behind your online name, and that's all you are, some random name online.  You haven't amounted to shit in real life so you vent your anger here, another place where you won't amount to shit, and like all other useless pieces of shit, you'll be forgotten.

,renison7,2011-09-21T14:49Z,@Mbb15 thanks for the info and I concede that it is an Irish film. Please update if anyone finds the English subtitles for the film.
,Sangarion,2011-09-21T19:23Z,"Ya, this is an Irish film not British.  It's also excellent."
,ashen77,2011-09-22T01:04Z,"its still a half brit half irish movie. look at the production companies. Like I said earlier, if it was a pure irish film they'd of never got it finished as they would of been to busy trying to farm potato's on location"
,ashen77,2011-09-22T01:05Z,"oh and spoilerboy, your a cunt, please kill your self before you breed others like you."

One of the better films I've seen this year.
Thank you!"
,Dont_H8,2011-09-22T18:55Z,"Hillarious Movie - Brendan Gleeson is absolutely hillarious in this movie. Grows on you the longer you watch. Gotta Love the Irish. ""I'm Irish its in my culture to be racist"" - what a funny fucker!"

and america is very quickly loosing its position to china. theyre the next big thing. "
,skiba_,2011-09-30T21:14Z,Come on. Someone make subs for this. Looks like a fun movie but the Irish accent is really thick. 
,movie_fan,2011-09-30T23:17Z,"extremezone thanks for your quality work.

Quick question to the community, I've recently noticed more avi files being uploaded with VLC player recommendations (like this one).

To watch these uploads, I download onto a flash drive then put into blu-ray.  However, with these recent uploads, the video isn't working.

I know it's not your upload so any ideas on what I need to fix?  i.e convert file to mp4 (not my 1st choice) or update firmware on blu-ray (don't think this is the problem)

thanks in advance.

,fastbel,2011-10-05T11:17Z,"Firstly - thanks extremezone for yet another great film. This to me is a DVD rip - start to finish without any faults or 'property of [whatever]' messages, perfect. As it says on the tin...well, cover - A cracker of a film, 10/10"

An amazing film, has me in stitches every time i watch it."
,.hotzenplotz,2011-10-15T22:26Z,"Great movie /w great quality. I really enjoyed viewing. Subtitles, at least in English, are existing only in miserable quality. I wonder why someone makes the effort to write down the audio of a movie in wrong words? "
,h4wk69,2011-10-17T01:09Z,"One of the best movies of the year without a doubt imo and lol @ the peeps who cant understand the irish accent, its hilarious!"
,nvek,2011-10-19T02:52Z,@skiba - Subtitles? Like Oprah having subtitles for the Susan Boyle interview? Here's an alternative suggestion: learn to speak English.
,Jagwiz,2011-10-19T04:43Z,Probably the funniest movie I've seen in a couple of years.

,skiba_,2011-10-21T23:07Z,"@nvek

You wouldn't happen to be Irish now would you?  I watched one short scence and honestly I didn't understand 80% of what they were saying. No point wathing this with out subs if you'll miss all the jokes."
