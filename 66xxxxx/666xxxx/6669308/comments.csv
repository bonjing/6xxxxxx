,turvgasm,2011-09-24T09:20Z,@daddydude Just download this torrent and uncheck all the other eps. you don't have to download every file in the torrent... crisis averted!
,raghu1985,2011-09-24T17:16Z,"Hey Vladtepes3176,

Is possible for you to upload the special features, deleted scenes etc for x-men first class and Thor. You really have the best collection of special features and movies. I like your collection alot.

,Derbenedikt,2011-10-02T19:56Z,The second half of Episode 07 is out of sync. But thanks a lot.
,djxtremo,2011-10-02T21:28Z,outstanding
,portylad4,2011-10-17T15:16Z,Is anyone else having issues with this torrent? For me the videos go blurry every 2-3 seconds for about a second. a lot of other videos do this as well. Does anyone know of a way to fix this?
,vortextk,2011-10-20T11:52Z,"Sounds like your computer is too weak to handle HD files if this happens ""often"" as HD is a more common upload than standard def now. Try 480p"
,portylad4,2011-10-21T13:34Z,"There is no way at all it's a weak PC, is it possibly something else?"
,KasualLeigh,2012-01-04T05:13Z,is this any good or does it have viruses??
,Tgod420,2012-01-05T23:04Z,Thanks much!
,LordTruth,2012-01-27T20:34Z,"I really like most of your ups, and want to DL your TrueBlood seasons, but, I want to get them all from one person. Is there any way you could Up S1 and S2? Or perhaps comment back here and let me know yes, know, or if you have them and I missed them? I've scanned a few times, and didn't find so...

Thanks a lot either way. Nice Ups."
,ladelame,2012-02-16T11:34Z,"The video keeps in and out of focus.  Like the compression is changing, going from crystal to blurry on and off every few seconds.  Very subtle, but really obnoxious.   

Anyone else seeing this?"
,ladelame,2012-02-16T16:01Z,"Never mind.  The ""default"" aspect ratio for VLC player was doing it.  Changing it to 2.21:1 fixed the issue.  

 cycles through the available ratios in VLC, at least on my machine.  Btw.   "
,croise,2012-02-16T20:26Z,"There a good BoB torrent available over here:

,mother_teresa,2012-02-19T23:44Z,Great quality but got an e-mail the next day from my IP about a complant from HBO about copyright infringement.
,steelrone,2012-03-24T15:29Z,This was either uploaded by HBO or someone they hired! I downloaded and received two copyright notices from my isp! DO NOT DOWNLOAD 
,Kole97,2012-03-29T10:57Z,Guys i just uploaded TRUE BLOOD season 5 (Official Trailer) - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7141425/True_Blood_Season_5_(Official_Trailer_HBO)_HD___K97
,treetops422,2012-05-02T19:34Z,I rarely comment uh DONT TAKE WHAT OTHER HAVE SAID ABOUT THIS BEING TAGGED LIGHTY! I downloaded this yesterday got to around 25% and got a call from my ISP telling me to stop torrenting or they would shut down my service and send me  a fine. I thought others that posted that were working for the movie industry trying to scare me.... I recommend downloading them 1 at a time.
,mcavelly,2012-05-08T05:34Z,Thank you
