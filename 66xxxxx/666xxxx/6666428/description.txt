Description......: On September 11, 2001, the worst terrorist attack on American soil claimed the lives of 2977 people in New 
                   York City and another 125 in the Pentagon. These are the stories of twelve survivors--fire fighters, 
                   ambulance workers, defense officials and ordinary office workers who went to work on that sunny day, 
                   unaware that their lives were about to be forever changed.
