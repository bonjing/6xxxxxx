Belle de jour is a rather risque sensual piece of music from Saint Tropez
circa 1978

The rest of the stuff is the I think in quality best described as the best
of disco beat music - certainly better than anything else - the truth be told

Enjoy this lovely music - this being a 1996 version as the 1978 
titles were all in lovely French. However belle de jour was the one item
they had to keep that way in any event - music for grown ups I say!

enjoy great sound quality in every way!
