,pssyluvr,2011-09-09T08:06Z,"The movie is ok, but they picked the wrong character to be the hero, which makes the ending as unreal and unbelievable as could be. I wont spoil it, but watch and you'll see what I mean. Thanks to TvTeam for the great, as usual, upload anyway. "

Thanks for the effort though TT

intobearzz; learn the english language please

pssyluvr: it would take more than changing one actor to make this film any good.
