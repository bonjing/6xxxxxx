Antenna Theory and Microstrip Antennas offers a uniquely balanced analysis of antenna fundamentals and microstrip antennas. Concise and readable, it provides theoretical background, application materials, and details of recent progress. Exploring several effective design approaches, this book covers a wide scope, making it an ideal hands-on resource for professionals seeking a refresher in the fundamentals. It also provides the basic grounding in antenna essentials that is required for those new to the field.
The bookâ€™s primary focus is on introducing practical techniques that will enable users to make optimal use of powerful commercial software packages and computational electromagnetics used in full wave analysis and antenna design. Going beyond particular numerical computations to teach broader concepts, the author systematically presents the all-important spectral domain approach to analyzing microstrip structures including antennas. In addition to a discussion of near-field measurement and the high-frequency method, this book also covers:

    * Elementary linear sources, including Huygenâ€™s planar element, and analysis and synthesis of the discrete and continuous arrays formed by these elementary sources

    * The digital beam-forming antenna and smart antenna

    * Cavity mode theory and related issues, including the design of irregularly shaped patches and the analysis of mutual coupling

Based on much of the authorâ€™s own internationally published research, and honed by his years of teaching experience, this text is designed to bring students, engineers, and technicians up to speed as efficiently as possible. This text purposefully emphasizes principles and includes carefully selected sample problems to ease the process of understanding the often intimidating area of antenna technology. Paying close attention to this text, you will be able to confidently emulate the authorâ€™s own systematic approach to make the most of commercial software and find the creative solutions that every job seems to require.
