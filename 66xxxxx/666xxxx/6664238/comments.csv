Thanx."

Can you please upload Hesher? Thanks!"
,Painweaver,2011-10-15T18:16Z,Is this one of the Hurt Locker files being tracked and getting people sent the lawsuit threat letters?  It's all over the internet this movie and the Expendables are the 2 newest movies being tracked for lawsuits.
,raindog33,2011-10-23T18:28Z,"Thanks very much.
I have a question though.  How can this be truly Highres if it's only 800MiB in size?  Most HD films I've seen (BRRips, etc) are ~4Gb+, give or take."
,sgt_schultz,2011-12-14T00:11Z,"yeah, i ask the same, can't be 720p at 800M"
,Saintnick,2011-12-29T20:20Z,Few people seem confused over file size. Google The Matroska Multimedia Container and H.264
