It is often disappointing quality to hear analog quality transfers
to CD when clearly they could always have done better with existing technologies
even back then I suspect - oh well there is certainly a great difference
in these re-mastered versions that aim for digital quality so as to
come closer to what we got from the vinyl disc playback Dual turntable with
an Ortofon cartridge, hooked when hooked up to a nice Cambridge amplifier
along with JBL or Bose speakers perhaps. Why not Grundig across the board even!


Anyways these are some great mp3s for 192k of Earth Wind and Fire's greatest
hits picks. We tried some 320k from other folders we found that were advertised
as remastered from a different album - however they weren't as good as these
192k greatest hits versions - and in any event these are rightly sized for an
ipod in addition to your home stereo perhaps even more! Stay tuned!

We found these to be "joint-stereo" as are a good many disco and pop postings
on the board. That said we think this is nice quality for someone who knows
they sound better than some many mp3 versions that are differently ripped.
Its up to you to pick and choose

cheers!
