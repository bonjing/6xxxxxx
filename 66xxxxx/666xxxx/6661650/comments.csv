,Twiiik,2011-09-09T10:46Z,"This is almost funny but really, it's just sad. 
Been so looking forward to this movie. Bought the HD version the instant it is was available on iTunes. Now I'm downloading it from PirateBay because ""You don't have a HDCP-compatible display""... Seriously. I can't play the movie I bought from iTunes on any of me TVs or 30"" Dell LCD-monitor. 

Thanks for the upload Mendoza15. Would love to find this in HD."
,ufomongo,2011-09-09T11:36Z,"Any thoughts regaring HD version?
Great upload anyway."

,Anthogno,2011-09-09T16:06Z,"For your own sake, dont watch this torrent! Dont get me wrong, i am rooting for TPB, but 60% of Thats it thats all was about audio and visual quality. And its even more true in this one! Get a US gift card from ebay, register US acc on itunes, and download HD version! Will be the best 10 euro ull ever spend on a digital download "
,sevsev77,2011-09-09T16:26Z,Yes! Thank you for getting this up so quick. You are awesome!
,Twiiik,2011-09-09T17:17Z,"Anthogno, read my post, then go piss on an electric fence!"
,bernsteez,2011-09-09T21:07Z,"If you like it, support the people who made it possible by buying it. It's $9.99 for the HD version on iTunes.

I downloaded this torrent and paid for the movie after watching the first minute and 20 seconds. Can't wait to see the whole thing!"
,llamacode,2011-09-09T21:14Z,"Anyone want to upload this to for direct download?

,bibibim,2011-09-09T23:07Z,"llamacode: just google the release name I put in my previous message, you will find a direct link. And it has much better quality btw..."
,zaniac420,2011-09-10T00:36Z,I bought this too on itunes in HD and was very excited to watch it.  My computer plays all sorts of other HD files no problem but itunes and quicktime play it very choppy.  I was able to watch the SD version that itunes gave me but would like to see the HD .

,ditch_666,2011-09-11T04:50Z,"Hey bibibim, The HD version of The.Art.of.Flight.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H.264-MC seems to have been taken offline, I managed to download it last night but didn't realise there was a password on the rar files. Would you care to share it here please?! Thanks mate!"
,davidglol,2011-09-11T18:53Z,"ditch_666 there are many mirros, with HD."
,nicko001,2011-09-12T00:51Z,heyy broo !! because they raise the torrent of the movie in hd ??? 
,ditch_666,2011-09-12T05:54Z,"I'm sure there are many mirrors, but I've already downloaded this version, and I'm hoping somebody else has as well and knows the password, thanks."
,nickpav,2011-09-12T07:10Z,thanks so much!!
,zaniac420,2011-09-12T08:50Z,"I just downloaded this and wanted to give a comparison to the version I purchased on itunes.  You may be wondering why I would download it from here if I have a purchased copy - I wanted a copy I could actually take with me to people's houses and also I cannot stand being forced to play it in quicktime thanks to itunes.  Also, I purchased the HD version but quicktime is too shitty to play it on my computer, even though vlc plays other HD videos no problem.  The SD version they included however does play on my computer and I can say even that definitely looks MUCH better than this rip.  The SD version I have is I believe 1.4gb while this is not even 1gb.  This rip is watchable but I definitely suggest you watch a better quality version if at all possible.  I personally cannot wait to get my hands on the HD copy and wish someone would put it up here, I can't help but wonder why the dude who posted it didn't do that to begin with."

,stervendehoerenkachel,2011-10-19T03:34Z,"Just a stupid snowboarding movie.
Has as much to do with flying as people jumping from the twin towers."
,bay_area,2012-01-28T08:09Z,"@stervendehoerenkachel what a stupid fucking asshole you are. if you don't have anything to say about the video or audio quality, get the fuck out of here and troll somewhere else. your head must be pretty far up your ass to ignore the cinematography and realistic element put into this movie"
