HERE WE GO WITH ANOTHER WONDER WOMAN BOOK.ENJOY!

This graphic novel may be marketed as a JLA book, but make no mistake, Wonder Woman is far and away the star. When a monstrous dragon appears in Europe, the Oracle at Delphi makes a prediction to Wonder Woman -- the Justice League will defeat the dragon, but perish in the attempt. Wonder Woman swears, then, to save her teammates from death the only way she can -- by defeating them each, one at a time, and then facing the dragon alone.
