,nflfan,2011-09-10T19:54Z,Great job as usual phatwarez. All your NFL uploads are really appreciated. 1.26 gigs a nice manageable size too. Well done!
,nflfan,2011-09-10T20:05Z,"Read your comments about tenyardtorrents and the excellent job you did uploading games last season. Personally I can't stand the Nazis who run TYT. The slightest criticism and you get banned, like I did. Any luck in finding an alternative source? "
[V],phatwarez,2011-09-10T22:14Z,"Yup I have a few new sources of NFL games i've been working on for a few weeks, independent from TYT. I'll probably stick to this resolution/bit rate for regular releases, I just don't have the setup to encode 16 1080p games a week.

I'm slowly clearing out my bdrip queue so i'll be able to dedicated my time solely to NFL games. I WILL be taking requests for individual games, email me.

Don't forget to donate! =) Seedboxes aren't cheap."
,waligaga,2011-09-11T15:24Z,"The audio and video is not only out of sync, and if you try to fix it manually in VLC it doesn't matter since there are glitch/skips which throw it back out of sync. This is all within the first 15 minutes.

I've tried various players and computers. 

Unwatchable."

[V],phatwarez,2011-09-13T02:24Z,"I'm redoing this one due to sync issues. Yup games coming soon, i'm real busy so i'm probably gonna dump all 16 at once."
,suninthefun3,2011-09-14T05:55Z,Hello Phatwarez...  I can't tell you how much i appreciated you uploading the Seattle Seahawks games last year.  I can only say that I truly hope you will be able to do the same this year.  From those of us who can't afford a television.... THANK YOU!
,rogeraccount,2011-09-14T23:50Z,I'm dying to see the Titans game :(
,EllisD4u2,2011-09-15T22:11Z,Do you have the Pats-Dolphins game?
,thaboial,2011-09-21T16:25Z,"i see you have a few requests already, but i cant help but ask do you have the week 2 chicago vs saints game."
