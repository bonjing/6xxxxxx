Debut album from the young Yorkshire folk-pop artist who was signed to Atlantic after taking himself off to LA and playing countless open mic nights, where he was discovered by Jamie Foxx. His warm, mature-sounding voice drives this album of soulful, melodic songs, often featuring electronic beats. Includes the haunting single "The A Team".
