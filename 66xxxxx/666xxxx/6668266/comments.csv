The music industry IS controlled. It's controlled by what YOU THE VIEWER wants to see. Music videos are ads for selling the albums, and sex sells.

Jay Z's use of pyramids is probably a reference to/ symbol for money, #2 on the viewer want list.

This is just a rant from a fanatic that sees things that aren't there."
,one_last_round,2011-09-12T01:55Z,"You haven't even watched the film.  Why don't you come back when you do, Ok?"
,one_last_round,2011-09-12T01:56Z,Why don't you watch the video first before making up your mind?
,gshuck420,2011-09-12T05:50Z,"WOW!!! okay i actually downloaded this, i watched it, and well to be honest I am more afraid of the Evangelical Christians than the music industry. People have a choice to listen to the music or not to, thus have the choice to be brainwashed. Now for Christians well when you are told Sunday after Sunday and evenings during the week that if we dont have a N.O.T.W stickers plastered on our worldly vehicles, that we are less in Gods eyes. This is horse shit brainwashing propoganda. You should watch the new movie Red State http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0873886/"
,rauthony,2011-09-12T18:33Z,"Stop the press! There are dark themes in pop music! This came as a real shock to me. Wow!

There are also dark themes in the Bible, which advocates genocide, incest, slavery, sexism, homophobia and the rejection of reason.

Editing together snippets of A-ha and The Pointer Sisters to illustrate some ill-defined supposedly Satanic conspiracy makes you appear feeble-minded and ludicrous, like a kind of special needs Tipper Gore. 

I do not subscribe to your Stone Age desert superstition, but if you really want to follow the message of Jesus, leave your drab bedroom and your bad editing skills behind, sell everything you have (yes, including your computer) and give the money to the poor.

Or volunteer for Amnesty International and make a real difference in the world instead of just trying to appear vaguely holy. Or if you can't bring yourself to make a real effort, then just sit quietly in a corner and draw a picture of mummy and daddy.

Your film is pointless."

LOL Dont listen to them, Keep up the good work!

God Bless"
,one_last_round,2011-09-14T21:15Z,"It's not my fault you don't get the A-ha and The Pointer Sisters clips.  Some will, some won't.  I didn't baby feed every part.

Saying that, I admit my mistake on the Lady Gaga clip.  Would have changed it now if I could."
,Dennis6744,2011-09-26T00:50Z,"Congratulations, I've made an account on PirateBay just so I could comment on this torrent. I've watched your video and what a waste of time it was. I can explain all the questions you state in your movie with one word: MARKETING.

Musicians sing what people want to hear, what people can relate to. Since the 1950's a lot of people have turned their backs on the Bible. Musicians as well. Only difference is; they write songs about it. 

And for Rock and Roll being the music of the devil; no shit. Rock and Roll is about rebellion, against the system, the system being the Bible here. You shouldn't take things so literally man, I mean, the Tenacious D video? Really? You are convinced that that video was made by Satanists? 

But I gotta admit, I love how you answer your own question at 01:23:18.

Stop trying to scare people and work on your editing skills. Peace!

,strong1975,2012-01-08T15:50Z,"Ok....while I get what you are trying to say, and you DO make your point, I have to say this whole thing would've held alot more weight, if you had used more current music. I mean, the majority of what you use as examples, here, were discussed, at length, DECADES ago. The only thing missing from your video, was playing certain tracks backwards. You do use a few current musical acts, but come on...The sex pistols, Black Sabbath (the name of the band, alone, should tell the listener what they sing about, the same goes for many of the other bands, you profiled)...The Rolling Stones...Danzig...seriously?  Granted, some of their music is still listened to, but those bands are LONG gone. Another point, is CONTEXT...alot several of the songs you played clips of, at the beginning of the video, were taken WAY out of context. While some of these 'artists' may very well BE ""Satan worshipers"" (how the hell do I know), if you take certain words or phrases out of context, they can mean ANYTHING. I could play a clip of a local pastor screaming ""SATAN"" at the top of his lungs. Tell everybody he's praying to Satan, and somebody would believe it. What I didn't reveal to you was, he actually said, ""I HATE SATAN""....see how that works?
I happen to be a singer/songwriter/musician. Hoping to make a living from my music. I do not worship Satan. In fact I believe Jesus died for my sins, and try to live my life the way I believe God wants me to. I believe this is the direction he wants me to go. And I do NOT believe I will have to sell my soul to the devil to achieve that, as your video would have me believe. (feel free to download my first demo album: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6933609/James_Strong_Heart_upon_my_sleeve_HQ )
I feel you have a valid point about SOME of this music. (especially the part about selling sex to kids) But I also feel this point was made YEARS ago. 
People have the God given right of freewill. They are going to listen to whatever music they want to, no matter how many of these kinds of videos go up. It is up to the listener WHAT they listen to, and what they take from it. 
For instance: ""Lose yourself""-Eminem...I am not a 'rapper', I SING my songs. And I don't even listen to alot of rap, but this particular song is one of my favorites. If you listen to it in context, it is about taking control of your life, and when the opportunity, that you have been waiting for, presents itself, you recognize it, and you SEIZE it. It's about having the strength to persevere, no matter the odds and taking that one moment to shine. While I'm not crazy bout some of the lyrics, THAT is what I took from this song. You get my point?   
I respect you for making this video, and the testimonial at the end took some guts. I understand what you tried to do, and I applaud you for it. But I don't believe this video is going to change anyone's mind...no offense intended. This same thing has been done to death...with MANY of the same bands/songs/albums that you covered here. 
God bless you and keep you
Peace be with us all"
,strong1975,2012-01-09T01:25Z,"P.S......Almost forgot. With a few exceptions, most of today's artists don't even write their own songs...just FYI. ;)"
