You should have used an OCR in theses files..
Some books have about ~100mb before OCR, after OCR it drops to ~10Mb[in colors, if b/w it, it drops to ~3mb]. This torrent could have less than 4Gb.

[I used this one http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4334000/ABBY_FINE_READER_final_activated100__by_ViKi_S ]

It's easy and will be easier to share the files."
