Note for standard DVD players
=============================

pressing the MENU button.


Important note for VLC users
============================

This DVD starts with an introduction to the use of the DVD.
But VLC normally skips straight to the menu.

To view the introduction in VLC, start playing, then perform
the following steps:

	1. Right click anywhere in the menu;

	2. Click Playback / Title / Title 2.

VLC will now play the introduction.

Please note that you do not have to mount the ISO file or
burn it to a DVD to watch it with VLC (though you can).
Simply open the ISO file with VLC and it will play.
But it will still skip straight to the menu, so you need
to perform the steps mentioned above.

Naturally, for future viewing you can just choose your options
from the menu since there is usually no need to watch the
introduction more than once.
