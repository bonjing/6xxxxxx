  Matt Baker and Clare Balding head to the North Pennines for a hike    
  and bike tour. Matt hitches a ride on a trike to visit some of the    
  spectacular sights here. He drops in at a winery where beetroot is    
  the main ingredient. Clare's on foot, finding out what makes this     
  place ideal shooting country. As the season gets underway, she meets  
  a group of women mixing glamour with game shooting. James Wong is     
  also in the Pennines. He's discovering how planting trees is helping  
  to train soldiers and increase the UK's woodland cover. Elsewhere,    
  with bovine TB in England at its highest level in decades, the        
  government is proposing killing badgers as a solution. If a cull      
  goes ahead, how will it work in practice and what impact it will      
  have - Tom Heap investigates. Down on the farm, Adam is in search of  
  a new sheepdog.
