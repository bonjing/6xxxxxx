,wizzkid1970,2011-09-13T03:06Z,dont touch this it stops at 99.7% stupid torrent guy must be hacked account
[T],drock232,2011-09-15T07:08Z,I am trusted and it does play all the way through the only reason it stopped at a certain point I believe is cuz I can only seed from 12-8 that's the only time my cable company doesn't monitor bandwidth sorry. I am seeding ALL of my torrents though that I have uploaded so it should be fine I don't know what you guys are talking about I checked the movie before I uploaded it and it is completely fine.
[T],drock232,2011-09-21T21:44Z,Guys I'm really sorry I'm going to re upload this...
