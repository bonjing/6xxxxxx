  The Vuelta a Espaa (English: Tour of Spain) is a three-week road     
  bicycle racing stage race that is one of the three "Grand Tours" of

  three weeks and attracts cyclists from around the world. The race is

  the end of the race. The rider with the lowest aggregate time at the  
  end of each day wears the Red Jersey.
