After the death of her father, sexy Honey West took over his
high-tech private detective firm.

As tv's first title-role female Private Eye, Honey West would
take on any tough case. She could handle herself mingling with
millionaires just as well as scaling a thirty foot wall.

Along with rugged Sam Bolt and her pet ocelot Bruce, Honey West
was sure to solve the case.

This short-lived series made television history by casting Anne
Francis as the first-ever woman lead private eye.

A honey of a drama about a drop-dead gorgeous, karate-kicking
private eye with an ocelot named Bruce for a pet. She fights
the bad guys with an arsenal of fashionable crime-busting
gizmos, such as an exploding compact and bejeweled handcuffs.

Honey first appeared in a series of novels, then after making
her TV debut on an April 1965 episode of `Burke's Law,' was
spun off into her own show.

It deserved better than its one-year run.
