,k3nd00d,2011-09-14T06:31Z,"I have a 42"" LCD TV and it doesn't look good to me on it. I don't think most people should expect to like how my 272p videos look on such a large display. LOL

A micro sized encode shouldn't be judged on playing it any more than twice the size of the native resolution of the file. :)"
