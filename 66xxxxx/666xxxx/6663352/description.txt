If you downloaded my other torrent of these guys, you should get this 1. I hadn't previewed all of the content yet, (which I usually do) and caught a few of the songs were lower quality, and volume. So I replaced them with much higher quality versions, plus found & added the reissue of their debut, which has better quality than the original issue, and some of the songs have a little more production on the 2007 remaster.
