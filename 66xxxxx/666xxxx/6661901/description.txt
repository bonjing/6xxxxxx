Cypherpunkd Episode 006: Regional Looms: PorcLoom.net - Alex Wied


Loom.cc is not the only Loom system out there in the wild. PorcLoom.net is alive and kicking its way into the New Hampshire Free State Project stomping grounds.

Alex tells us why he recoded the Loom system in Ruby, setup his own Loom server, how it is geared toward a regional market, his plans for it, and many of the business models and market usage that can be operated on top of this Economic Dialtone System in the Loomiverse.
