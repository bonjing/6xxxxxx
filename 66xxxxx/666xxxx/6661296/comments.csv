,LolNade,2011-09-08T22:53Z,Does this contain the crack somewhere?
,miguelsz3,2011-09-08T22:56Z,"@LolNade
Nope.... Just install the game, Run the game, and click login. Pure and simple."
,LolNade,2011-09-09T02:19Z,"@miguelsz3
Ahh okay thanks, I didn't bother trying that in the first place. Lol"
,edgar6,2011-09-09T10:20Z,Thanks dude m8 Good up :)
,Z-Runner,2011-09-10T00:14Z,"Dont work.
Anyone tested in XP?
It looks like for MAC realese."
,miguelsz3,2011-09-10T04:54Z,"@Z-Runner 
Running on Vista 32-bit basic.... Last time I check that aint Mac."
,Z-Runner,2011-09-10T10:36Z,"Didnt work for me.
Java installed.
Game installed.
Trying start get this
set path=%path%;%ProgramFiles%\Java\jre6\bin;%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Java\jre6\bin;
java -Djava.library.path=./ -Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true -Dsun.awt.noerasebackground=true -Dsun.java2d.d3d=false -Dsun.java2d.opengl=false -Dsun.java2d.pmoffscreen=false -cp lwjgl.jar;./ zombie.FrameLoader

Its open in notepad dammit."
,miguelsz3,2011-09-10T22:48Z,"@Z-Runner 
Wait? So when you start it, it opens notpad correct?"
,Z-Runner,2011-09-11T03:28Z,Yep in notepad. I dont know what going on.
,miguelsz3,2011-09-11T04:38Z,"@Z-Runner 
Oh lol, no wonder it aint working. The game runs as a .Bat file, so my guess is that your computer has associated it with Notepad rather then just executing.... Yah... Ummm.... Try googling "".bat file opening in notepad XP"".

P.S.
I think I made it sound a bit overly complicated."
,Z-Runner,2011-09-11T15:58Z,"Great thanks. It starts now.
I find bat fix and now its work."
,miguelsz3,2011-09-12T00:58Z,"@Z-Runner
Cool, glad to be of help."
,xhizors,2011-09-15T04:21Z,"ok so i downloaded this game, now how do i turn on my computer?

~Sincerely, Z-Runner"

,zoomoneys939,2011-09-19T01:02Z,You can download the same version off of the official PZ page. 
,miguelsz3,2011-09-19T11:01Z,"@zoomoneys939 
If it were the same version from the website then whenever you would click ""login"" the game would automatically exit out. So in essence... 

Shoo noob. =-="
,HolyWinter,2011-09-24T23:54Z,"I couldn't read it for some reason so if anyone has the same similar problem I just right-clicked and selected ""Run as Administrator"" and it issued the setup just fine. Thx!"
,Raamen,2011-09-28T03:48Z,"Doesnt work on my XP
Freezes on loading map"
,KrackShot,2011-10-07T00:50Z,Good stuff you put up. Keep it comin'.
,LethalBobby,2011-11-02T00:53Z,"I am having the same problem as Raamen.. I will load the game, and if I go to ""sandbox"" mode I can pick my guy, occupation, so on so forth... but thats it.. I dont know if Im being a spaz and cant see where the ""next"" button is, if there is one... and if I go to story mode, doesnt matter which one I choose, the music will play then eventually sound like a disc skipping and it will freeze... Im using XP, so please any help??"
,randyarmy,2011-11-29T14:59Z,"No crack ??

,miguelsz3,2011-11-30T03:55Z,"@randyarmy

,miguelsz3,2011-12-23T21:10Z,Sorry but I cant be much help. The games still in pre-alpha so its glitchy as hell. I cant even play with the audio going bat shit insane.
,HoboNoah,2012-01-06T04:00Z,"Install -> Run -> *Click* Log-in.
Everything freezes for roughly 13 seconds, then the Log-in button pops back out.  Doesn't even get into the game screen."
