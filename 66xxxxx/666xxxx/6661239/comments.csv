,lukiezgo,2011-09-09T14:35Z,It's the first Deus Ex game...better than Human Revolution...oooo controversy begin!
,Endetium,2011-09-09T15:39Z,honestly does anyone here actually read the description box?
,ancient78,2011-09-09T16:22Z,"BUT the original deus ex was ~700 megs and this is ~3.1 gigs!!

so the question is:

What has been added to make this that huge from the original game?"
,XxXDoWNLoADeRXxX,2011-09-09T16:40Z,"Nothing was added... this has nothing to do with Deus Ex. I know a dude who's part of this group and he sent me this game. I just can't install it on my Vista, that's why there are no screenshots... Anyways, I hope you guys can. I'm seeding right now."
,ZtorkX86,2011-09-17T08:43Z,Is it a parody like the Nameless mod or?

,ZtorkX86,2011-09-17T10:23Z,Where did the downloader go? How are we suppose to download this when the availability is lower than 1 and no active seeder?
,ZtorkX86,2011-09-22T17:29Z,Damnit. Still 0.989 availability and no active seeder.. :(
