Essential Custom Materials for Cinema 4D
Dozens of custom materials from Cinema 4D artists packed into an easy to use library for your projects.

What is it?
Texture Kit is a collection of over 140 Custom Materials and Textures for Cinema 4D for use in your projects and renders. These materials are made by Cinema 4D artists and ready for professional production work.

The Artists
Version 1.1 of texture kit includes materials from three Cinema 4D artists. Beeple, Pariah Rob, and Greyscalegorilla. We hope to add more artists in future versions. Future materials will be included at no extra cost.

The Requirements.
Texture Kit requires Cinema 4D 12 and above. All versions including Prime, Broadcast, Visualize and Studio are supported for most materials. Special materials like hair, displacement, and sub-surface-scattering materials will only work with Studio. Less than 10% of the included materials require Studio.

Whatâ€™s Included?
Over 140 custom textures including natural textures like brick, wood, glass, and leather. Mograph style textures like Glows, Gloss, Patterns, and soft material. Many Hair and specialty textures are included as well.

Extras!?!?
Texture Kit also comes with "Texture Maker" which makes making simple textures very quick and easy by using sliders and color pickers instead of the default texture options.
