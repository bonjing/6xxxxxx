1) INSTALLATION CD (copy-protected), used CLONECD to rip the data (dummy bad sectors inserted).

2) DATA DVD (unprotected), created iso file.

Use the included free utility, "Virtual CloneDrive" to load the images and install the games.

It seems only Windows XP x86 is supported. If you have Windows 7 or/and 64 bit OS you can use "Oracle VM VirtualBox" to setup an Windows XP x86 virtual environment!
