,yavin4jc,2011-09-12T06:39Z,"I'm curious. Why do people make fake torrents? Is it to spread malware, or is it for some IP tracking thing, or just... for fun? (This is a fake torrent btw.)"
,tastyjoel,2011-09-12T06:43Z,if i download an xbox game on my pc how do i transfer the game to my xbox?
,Feetback,2011-09-12T06:44Z,"Excellent job  ""DibyaTPB"" Thank you! keep eem coming more please :)  "
,yavin4jc,2011-09-12T06:47Z,"It's fake, people."
,sandralea_22,2011-09-12T06:55Z,Where is eztv's download never a problem or worry there
,sum1knew,2011-09-12T07:03Z,"so, what is the final verdict on this? real or trap?"
,sum1knew,2011-09-12T07:04Z,WTF? Comments don't show up?
,sum1knew,2011-09-12T07:12Z,"I assume fake, comments are being hidden so there is no negative feedback."
,xyggurat,2011-09-12T07:12Z,@yavin4jc Why do you keep insisting that this torrent is fake? A quick click on the username shows a consistent pattern of posting good torrents. Please do your research before making baseless accusations.
,Meoang,2011-09-12T07:28Z,"For the hesitant:  This is real, ignore the people who spam all over that it's fake.  Notice that the same people are posting multiple comments on torrents saying it's fake."
,Meoang,2011-09-12T07:29Z,"Sorry if I'm posting multiple comments, my last one didn't come up.  This is a real torrent, I'm watching it right now as I type this.  Ignore the people posting multiple times on the same torrent that it's fake, I have no idea why they're doing that.  Maybe to support torrents that actually are fake."
,diskoh,2011-09-12T07:36Z,"Download complete, watching now. This is real, and good quality. Are the ""fake"" comments bots or something? "
,xyggurat,2011-09-12T08:03Z,"Verified real, and you beat the slackers eztv to the punch. Thanks @DibyaTPB."
,soot9978,2011-09-12T08:04Z,real or fake... it can't be an HD file at a quarter of the size of the usual HD files.
,flipperspit,2011-09-12T14:52Z,"Real, but why is 624x352 resolution posted as a ""Highres - TV shows""?"
,DontPissMeOff,2011-09-12T22:00Z,Where's the admin? ;)
,Nikopolo,2011-09-15T07:34Z,"My comments been deleted so âŚâŚ

I'm NOT saying that this is Fake . It just didnt worked for me because my Pc told me that the File was broken and i could not fix it ive tried every player i had and VLC was trying to repair it but it couldnt . But im not the only one who says that ."
