This is a vhs workprint of tom savini's 1990 remake. It's reputedly director Tom Savini's personal workprint from point of production, that was stolen from his house. It was recently transfered to dvd and found its way into my hands. The workprint is rough, old and damaged. It's a vhs tape thats at least 21 yo by now. It has no proper title or end credits, only music. No counters. Rough edits. Different, trippy music. Prolonged gore scenes. Its from a point before final editing and censorship so its fully uncut.

I've made a seriouse attempt at restoring this workprint. Av ran several specialised filters to reduce the overall mess and repair it, where possible. Although its much nicer and cleaner than the origional, this is still rough and messy. If you want dvd quality, you aint getting it from this.
Remeber, this is rough. The origional transfer was much worse. But it is still very watchable and worth a look. I tried to encode from source several times but out them all, this was the best looking encoding run. Its not perfect but its much improved over source. Take it or leave it.

Work done:
Video: Ran several filters to reduce scratches, blotches, static lines, aliasing, ringing and damage/age etc. Had to deinterlace but the whole structure was damaged meaning it wouldnt deinterlace properly in areas. I used an additional single field deinterlacer to tidy up the mess but theres still small interlaced artifacts specled here and there. Sharpned the vid on this and defined edges more. Stabalised, filtered out static and adjusted chroma. Then adjusted colours, contrast, brightness and saturation. Tried to remove that nicoten stain coloured film over it all and restore the colours back.
Audio: Filtered out tape hiss, reoccuring pops and clicks. Rebalenced and tidied it all up real nice.
Overall: Origional encode was 700mb. I trimmed off some dead areas at the start and end and also trimmed some of the messier areas out, just small edits of a few frames done to tidy up the overall vid. Nothing important is lost. This totaled aprox 15mb of edits. Btw, due to the level of scripting invloved, couldnt do this before encoding. Couldnt precision seek in vdub wiout lockups. Had to settle for trimming after encode.
