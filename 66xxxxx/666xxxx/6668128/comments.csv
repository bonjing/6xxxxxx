,madelynn,2011-09-12T05:38Z,"just wondering if there is any problem playing this on ps3? im not stupid, i know its for ps3 but when i dl other movies to watch on ps3 after about 5 mins there is a program that stops me from watching the whole movie."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-09-12T15:31Z,"that would be Cinavia you are talking about.  I don't know if this or any other title is Cinavia protected as I don't test on the PS3 platform.  Get an apple tv ($99) you will enjoy it, it is a very nice item."

,madelynn,2011-09-13T05:08Z,Do i need a mac to use apple tv or will my pc work? Can i stream from my pc to my tv using apple tv?
