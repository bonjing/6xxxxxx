SWF Text is an author tool of Flash text animation. It embraces 160+ text effects and 40+ background effects, and users may also customize all the properties of a Flash, including font, text color, and layout, etc. With SWF Text, a user without any experience of Flash development can easily create a Flash banner or an introductory page within a few minutes. And all you need do is to input text, select font and animation effects. While a veteran Flash designer may use SWF Text for text animation in a project, which sure greatly saves your time and effort.
