Had a little accident which ended up with my computer on the ocean floor....

I'm on a loaner now so it'll be a little on and off, but I'm working on it.

Papakeno, Great as usual, nice to see youre still going strong, bringing good music to the uneducated masses...  Hahaha, keep up the good work, my friend!"

I'm a 80 - Early 90's New Wave (New Romantic and Synthpop fanatics). I've stop to collect the musics late 90's as I've fade up with all kind of rubbish that time.

I got copy of your PapaPop Collections from Real Chicken last 2 years. Thanks to him also that copy still exist.

Because of your Collections I'm keep on digging this kind of Genre, and I've found again my lost soul, but now has evolve the name of Genre to be Future Pop or Electro Pop. (I've found allot  these type Genre like more to Synthpop Upbeat in your collections)

Thank You so much for your collections and most of all inspired me again to get my soul of music back.

BRAVO!!!

Cheers.
