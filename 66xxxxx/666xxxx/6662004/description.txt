Last month someone uploaded this beautiful copy of the 1954 movie "The Egyptian" at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6614233/The.Egyptian.1954.720p.BluRay.x264-HDCLUB I went looking on the internet for English subtitles to watch it with. While I'm not deaf, I like to watch movies at night when the family is asleep. The subtitles allow me to do that by watching the film without sound. The only so-called English subtitles I could find were a version that was created from the Portugese soundtrack of the film. The results were hideous and couldn't be used to the point you didn't what they were saying. "Master" came out as "My love" for some reason. So I downloaded a program called Subrip and opened up the file and begin changing what they had to the what was really being said in English. I hope you enjoy it and feel free to post the file on any subtitle site.
