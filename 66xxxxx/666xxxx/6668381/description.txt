This is a great song, and it is interesting to see an artist
such as Les Zeppelin do it.

The video is 720 X 576 and a full 320k audio bitrate from a 70mb flac
file conversion to get an mp3 that did it righter justice than 
what we found around instead.

The audio is far superior to the other live clips of this performance now around 
too - although they seed at incredibly high speeds - I assume while awaiting a 
better offering. Well, here we are!

Having attended high school in he 70s, This is a song I was
appreciative of, however this is my first glimpse of Led Zeppelin
as I hung out with the squares back then I have to admit - and that
is not likely to change as I am who I am as it were!


Great song, and I am about to post a hundred versions of it here by
different artists - lets see how the votes come in at the end
of it all.

This is superior to the 111mb mpg (224k audio vs our remastered 320k)
and Xvid (which is 128k audio) now around as I say as the audio
is supreme, and the video a more standard res than the former,
and in DivX too!

Cheers - I hope this seeds for you equally!
