Uriah Heep are an English rock band formed in London in 1969 and regarded (along with
Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin) as a seminal classic hard rock act of the 1970s. Uriah Heep's
progressive/art rock/heavy metal fusion's distinctive features have always been massive
keyboards sound, strong vocal harmonies and (in the early years) David Byron's operatic
vocals. Twelve of the band's albums have made it to the UK Albums Chart (Return to Fantasy
reached 7 in 1975) while of the fifteen Billboard 200 Uriah Heep albums Demons and
Wizards was the most successful (23, 1972).In the late 1970s the band had massive success
in Germany, where the "Lady in Black" single was a big hit.

Uriah Heep's audience declined by the 1980s, to the point where they became essentially a
cult band in the United Kingdom and United States. The band maintains, though, a significant
following and performs at arena-sized venues in the Balkans, Germany, Japan, the
Netherlands, Russia and Scandinavia. They have sold over 30 million albums worldwide...
