,Kendo83,2011-09-08T22:38Z,"For anyone slagging off Extremezone, when you do even a fraction of the work he does then you can have an opinion. Until then, STFU cos you got jackshit to complain about"
,mpkropp,2011-09-08T23:58Z,"dido kendo83, except for he wasn't really complainin, more like requesting, which considering all the content released from xtremezone, is denied and understandably so, no bugging, so how about this ""stfu and be happy, dont slag""  Even though slagging off kind of makes me laught.  Sorry no V A.  ExtremeZone thank you for all your hard work, do appreciate.  "
,L3fT4D34D,2011-09-09T00:40Z,"Stop asking for specific torrents, as always, he will upload them when a good copy is available.


/Thanks again extremezone 10/10
"
,Kendo83,2011-09-09T01:12Z,"mpkropp, it wasn't specific to this page. I've seen on other torrents that disrespectful people have made comments. I think it's disgraceful that people can't just be grateful that someone is actually going to the effort to post these for everyone to enjoy."
,mantronixlives4ever,2011-09-09T04:56Z,"Wow didn't expect to see this up here already! It starts in the theaters tomorrow! Awesome!

Great Quality for a SCR. 10/10 

Thanks You Extreme!!!!"
,Nash6989,2011-09-09T05:38Z,NO SHIT!! Extremezone probably uploads more than anyone on this site. anyone who bags on them are fucking RETARDS! keep up the brillant work
,majestika,2011-09-09T05:38Z,"Thanks EZ, I know from you it's excellent quality just not sure yet how I would rate the movie. It looks good from trailers, but then those could be the only good parts of the movie. Will rate the movie after watching.  Thanks again for a fast upload."
,majestika,2011-09-09T07:13Z,"@Kendo83 & Nash 6989, I have been on PB for a long time and totally agree. We all know how much time and effort a lot of these uploaders put in, just so we can enjoy a night at home watching a good movie. It's the kids that can't go out after 9 that are ungrateful, disrespectful and comments are not worth reading. Many thanks again EZ, going to relax and watch the movie now....just came back to see if anyone yet gave a rating on the movie.
Cheers...."
