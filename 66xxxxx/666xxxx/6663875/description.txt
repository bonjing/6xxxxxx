Welcome to Neo_X_Killua_45s' "Ark of Knowledge II" (inspired by Mark Passio)

This torrent is inspired by Mark Passio, I will be uploading, "Ark of Knowledge I" if II is successful..  Why, do you ask?  Because that one will need 999.99 GB's of free space once that one is unpacked...  Do you see where I'm going with this..  Sorry for any .rar errors, I tried my best, but the errors should be false, I moved the directories of some files to different folder locations, so they should be in there somewhere..  These ARKs are too good to split up..  Demonoid has too low of a size limit to get anything up besides books and images...  ;(


Please try to Start w/ the "What On Earth Is Happening" folder (movies).

use the "Software.." folder for any issues opening a file..  If there are some files that linux or mac users have trouble viewing (probably located in the "Books.." folder for trouble reading random book files, use the internet!)



I'm sorry Ark II is not as neat as Ark I, but you are free to re-organize to fit your style of folder structure.  This is a never-ending process, but remember, All is Love, Fear is an Illusion.
