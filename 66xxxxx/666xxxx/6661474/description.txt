Since the first publication in 1995, the Organic Chemistâ€™s Desk Reference has been essential reading for laboratory chemists who need a concise guide to the essentials of organic chemistry â€” the literature, nomenclature, stereochemistry, spectroscopy, hazard information, and laboratory data. The past fifteen years have witnessed immense growth in the field of chemistry and new discoveries have continued to shape its progress. In addition, the distinction between organic chemistry and other disciplines such as biochemistry and materials science has become increasingly blurred. Extensively revised and updated, this new edition contains the very latest data that chemists need access to for experimentation and research.

New in the Second Edition:

    * Rearranged content placed in a logical progressive order, making subjects easier to find
    * Expanded topics from the glossary now presented as separate chapters
    * Updated information on many classic subjects such as mass spectrometry and infrared, ultraviolet, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
    * New sections on chiral separations and crystallography
    * Cross references to a plethora of web information

Reflecting a 75% revision since the last edition, this volume is a must-have for organic chemists and those in related fields who need quick and easy access to vital information in the lab. It is also a valuable companion to the Dictionary of Organic Compounds, enabling readers to easily focus in on critical data.
