Pls help me, I want the highest possible quality of this movie, so which one should I download ?

As far as I can comprehend, 1080p source is same DVD9 and resolution has been just upped to 1080p. So, will DVD9 give better picture quality than 1080p in this case ?

Waiting for the reply, thx "
[T],TamilCreation,2011-09-11T21:19Z,@ arnold991 : THE 1080P IS RIPPED FROM THE DVD9 SOURCE. SO THE QUALITY OF THE DVD WILL BE RETAINED IN IT. SO THE BEST THING WOULD BE TO DOWNLOAD THE ORIGINAL DVD ITSELF.
