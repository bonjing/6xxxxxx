iNSTALL/REGiSTER NOTES :..

Use our keymaker to register the application.

Note about the email you use to register:

For v2, your email can use only A-Z, a-z, dot, and .

For v3, you can use A-Z, a-z, 0-9, dot, , , and dash.

The email address must be in valid format such as "ab.cd". I already do my best to check if the email is valid for you, but still if you try to use any strange email address, it's your own business and you will fail even the keygen generate you a serial.

False example:
(x) ab.c - no country code can be only one character.
(x) ab.cdefg - no subfix can be longer than 4 characters.
(x) ab.c - use your brain
