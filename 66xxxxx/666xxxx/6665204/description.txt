The Vuelta a Espaa (English: Tour of Spain) is a three-week road
bicycle racing stage race that is one of the three "Grand Tours" of
Europe and part of the UCI World Ranking calendar. The race lasts
three weeks and attracts cyclists from around the world. The race is

end of each day wears the Red Jersey.
