,hokella,2012-02-27T15:35Z,great work but if you ripped from youtube why 320 kbps ? highest audio quality on youtube is 192 kbps

,hokella,2012-03-09T23:09Z,it says 320 kbps if you ripped it on that way but that's useless because the song you ripped from youtube contains 192 kbps data. that's an unnecessary usage of at least 1 gb for your torrents anyway i am just saying
