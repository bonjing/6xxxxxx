This torrent will install fine. I had an error during the extraction/install process which was resolved by disabling the anti virus real time shields. So if you have problems during installation, (such as this ISDone.dll is not a console application created the file %n%s%nYou error or an incorrect format pcf-file), just deactivate your anti virus when you begin installing, and keep it off until the process is complete.


The extracted and installed folder size is ~6.38gb

This is a VERY good release. With only English language files, a lot of space is saved, coupled with very efficient compression we get a high efficiency high quality torrent. 

I was skeptical at first because of the small size, but everything works properly, and there are no modifications whatsoever except removing surplus language files.

All pre-rended cinematics and cut scenes are included at full original res. The only excuse to download another release is if you want multiple languages.


Very good torrent, don't let the small size fool you. I will seed for a long time."
