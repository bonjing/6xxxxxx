OK it took me about 6 hours of installing and reinstalling as could not get the game to run.

Aftere trying different cracks and suggestions this is what worked for me on Windows 7 32bit.

Just follow the instructions and the game should work

1) in folder named 1 copy the hosts document and paste and overwrite in c:/windows/system32/drivers/etc

i after this restarted my pc but not sure if you need to or not.

2) install From Dust using setup.exe

3) once installed go to folder named 3 copy and overwrite From_Dust.exe in the instalation folder. (This is the directory where you installed the game)

4) Then open the folder named orbit copy all of it and paste and overwrite everything in c:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\program files\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Ubisoft\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Ibisoft Game Launcher.

Again after i installed the game i restarted the pc.

Then double click on From_Dust.exe

(NOTE USE THE From_Dust.exe IN THE INSTALLATION FOLDER NOT I REPEAT NOT IN PROGRAM FILES MENU)

i OPENED THE INSTALLATION FOLDER AND CREATED A SHORTCUT TO MY DESKTOP, IF YOU USE THE .EXE IN PROGRAM FILES MENU IT WILL NOT RUN)

It will briefly open a window saying checking for updates, it will then ask you for a key.
