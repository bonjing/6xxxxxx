[V],DownTYU,2011-09-09T18:38Z,I already did this..
[V],DownTYU,2011-09-09T18:41Z,Anyways I will ask 'em to delete it...:)
,ofpirate,2011-09-09T19:02Z,"@downtyu: check the size, its meaningfully different.. "
[V],DownTYU,2011-09-09T19:40Z,Thats why I have asked the mods to delete it.
,ofpirate,2011-09-09T20:00Z,"actually, my point was that i believe many users might prefer the smaller file size of this print.."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-09-10T04:34Z,That's also what DownTYU meant :)
,ofpirate,2011-09-10T21:56Z,"shit! sorry, i thought we were debating killing this one.. doh!"
,basjnisse,2011-10-02T08:48Z,Thanks!! A must see 80's classic
,kchri,2011-11-04T03:03Z,"Thanks so much for this but I honestly cannot perceive a difference in quality AT ALL in either video or audio between this one and PsychoLogic's rip, which is only 2.34 GB. Everyone should really just download and seed the other one. Personally, I'd gladly like to find a 1080p rip because I love this movie that much"
,jlh1976,2012-05-14T19:37Z,Is there a better place to download this?  It's really slow.  Where is PsychoLogic??
,jlh1976,2012-05-15T04:53Z,"Nevermind, I found it.  Nobody was seeding it when I tried downloading.  Piratebay's search engine isn't best..."
