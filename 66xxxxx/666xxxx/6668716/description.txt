Six Pack Shortcuts is a training course consisting of a series of online videos that that are designed to help you get a ripped six pack after around 3 months on the six pack abs exercises that Mike teaches. Itâ€™s dubbed the â€œSix Pack Shortcutsâ€ as the abs workouts are specifically designed for training efficiency (the most possible results in the least amount of time).

But for those of you are hoping for â€œthe least amount of effortâ€ then think again!

This course is NOT a magic â€˜how to get a ripped six packâ€™ scam which just tells you to take a magic pill and you will get a six pack stomach. You will have to work your ass off on this course to get a six pack, but I is definitely the most effective program I have ever tried.

 

â€œBasically, youâ€™re getting a how to guide on exactly how to design your workout and diet plans to achieve maximum results in the shortest possible time.â€




The Six Pack Shortcuts course is structured in a way that is easy to follow, but most importantly, teaches you to understand the reasons why you will get your six pack abs. The six pack program is structured in the following stages:

The Introduction to Phase 1 Video - Mike Explains and Walks You Through Every Workout

Phase 1: Accelerate Your Metabolism â€“ Mike teaches you how to change your workout program to incorporate HIIT (high intensity interval training) techniques. This phase is designed to increase your muscle mass and calorie expenditure by training with higher intensity for shorter periods.

Phase 2: Burn the Belly Fat â€“ The next stage of getting a six pack involves burning your belly fat. Once your metabolism is raised, you will further increase the intensity on this phase and going on Mikes â€˜Zero Will Power Eating Systemâ€™.

Note - THIS IS THE BEST NUTRITION SYSTEM I HAVE EVER SEEN!

This system is worth the six pack shortcuts membership fee alone. I have always gone up and down on with my eating plans, but Mike teaches you have to select the right foods, buy them cheap (this is good because healthy food is usually expensive) and cook in bulk. This eliminates your choice so you are never tempted to stray off your six pack diet plan.

Phase 3: How to Build a Six Pack â€“ once you have low body fat and can start to see your six pack stomach, You move onto another video and Mike teaches you about 10 or 12 specific six pack abs exercises which he has perfected over the years.

Phase 4: Learn how to Maintain Your Six Pack Stomach for Life â€“ The final video teaches you a few additional exercises and tips to shed those last couple of pounds and keep them off for good. By this point you will probably have your ripped six pack abs and not really need to much stuff from this video.
