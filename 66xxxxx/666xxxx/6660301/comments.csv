,tanteadele,2011-09-08T14:35Z,"Awesome that its so small will give this one a shot.

I tried the RELOADED release with and without update.

I run win xp 64 and no matter what i do I dont have any attack sounds. 

Totally weird. I have voices and everything but if I kick, punch or swing a weapon i dont hear anything not the wooosh of the weapon or any weapon impact.

Does anybody know that issue or how to fix it? 

Any help would be really appreciated.

Blessings"

,tanteadele,2011-09-09T00:17Z,"Its actually interesting that ppl complain about a lack of seeders. 

What you are looking at - ladies and gentleman - is mans nature at this state of evolution.

Why would the balance of the most dominant trait on earth - the accumulation of wealth - in humanity suddenly experience a shocking blow from only a very few sharing beings to a mass of social entities. 

If suddenly, against all odds, tpb was a platform that holds as many seeders as leechers then this virus might spread and cause all kinds of havoc on our economically so well balanced planet.

So, in the scheme of things, we'r right where we belong. This balance is actually quite representetive and very normal.

So we shouldn't be concerned about a lack of seeders....only about the time OUR downloads will be complete. haha

Many blessingssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss"

,Antiga,2011-09-09T02:32Z,"People whining about the speed and asking for SEED SEED do not understand how torrents work. 
The uploader mentioned his upload speed for this torrent will be slow today. Since he's the only real seeder, every part of the torrent must first be uploaded by him before it can be shared further.

To break it down a little more: what is happening is he is constantly uploading unique parts of the torrent to a few different people, who then start doing the same. Normally parts spread out fast enough to get a big difference in who finishes downloading first, but since his speed is slow, pretty much every leech is able to get the unique part uploaded by .Dude., from any other leech, before a new unique part is available.
Check the peers tab, you will see most people are stuck at the same percentage.
Hope this helps people understand the process a little more, but above all stops the senseless moaning about seeds n speed.

Though currently it's been stuck for a few hours, i'm guessing .Dude. turned off his computer. Tomorrow this will have 600 seeds."

,BHTrix,2011-09-09T14:20Z,"For those that get the black screen, no starting, it's because the games resolution is set to a different setting then your native screen resolution settings, just let it run, it will start eventually, do a bit of alt tabbing, start up the task manager, leave it alone for a bit. When it starts, make sure you set the resolution of the game to the same resolution as your desktop, restart, should work properly. Still seeing if the saves work with this copy."

Simple as that. Not only this, but also the size it has been compressed to is amazing! only 1.65GB...

Hopefully this torrent will be 100% idiot proof and there will be no dumb 'how do i install' questions.. but hey, who knows these days lol....

,Inirit,2011-09-09T20:35Z,"pumpkicks1k, you're retarded.

Anyway, I installed the game from this release and my first run was flawless. Game played great, saves worked, etc. Now I've come back to play again a few hours later and the sound is fucked up. It's good during the splash screens and the opening cutscene, but when I ""press any key to continue"" and get to the main menu, I get crazy amounts of static noise. This random static persists during actual gameplay as well. It's incredibly annoying and I don't know what's causing it. Anyone have an idea?"
,venom110,2011-09-09T20:40Z,"I'm lolin, i got it to work. 

1) install winrar
2) extract the .iso
3) open setup.exe
4) install Directx when prompted (yea, it worked after I tried that)
5) install the C++ (if you hit install and it only says ""Uninstall"" or ""Repair"" then just cancel out. 
6) choose your game directory
7)Make desktop icon.
8) Install. (I have Avast, and all I did was allow it to open normally and hit ""Remember my choice for this program"".. some people may have to turn AV off completely)
9) Allow the game to install. (It took me about 30 min for some reason)
10) Restart computer.
11) Start game from desktop icon.

It worked for me after that, so good luck and happy gaming.
 100% real. "

,nitropack777,2011-09-11T19:06Z,"@dolan's mate...I found out the main problem...I use Avast and it likes to open things in sandbox, and it changes something with the file...so you gotta have ur AV off or if you use Avast just have it open normally"

,dem0man01,2011-09-11T23:36Z,"Install worked out perfect, took maybe 20 minutes. Will test out the game right now. If you go to page 5 of comments and check out venom110's comment, I followed that and it worked except I didn't extract with WinRar I used PowerISO to mount."
,Rbtehdred,2011-09-12T00:34Z,Only problem I have found with this game is some weird issue with the flashlight!  It doesn't actually light anything up!  Anybody have this same problem or might know how to fix it?  Very hard to do missions if you can't see where you are going!
,orangenod18,2011-09-12T03:17Z,"Best Dead Island torrent release, it has no complicated installation process like other releases and no in-game crashes so far. PLUS! IT""S ONLY 1.65GB, FK Yeah!

Hoping BLACK-BOX Lossless release Warhammer 40000: Space Marine in compressed too :)"

,chaohak,2011-09-13T12:58Z,"No xeusoi16, not fake. Took about 10 minutes to install and has worked fine so far, I'm only at chapter 3 but I have yet to crash or notice any problems.

Even thinking I might buy the game on steam for multiplayer so if someone could confirm if i can copy my save over or not that would be great."

,puli9,2011-09-14T05:26Z,thanks dude works great but how to install updates on it 
,KingP1NGaming,2011-09-15T02:37Z,"I hear the player character & the game sounds (actions combat, etc.) fine but I can't hear anything when I actually engage in conversations with NPC's. However, I CAN hear them chatter in the background without my interaction. Weird.

Does anyone know how I fix this? I looked for a settings or gamesettings file in  both my documents & program files, so that I could change the sound settings but I haven't found anything. Any help is appreciated in advance.

Besides the audio gripe, this is a Quality torrent in such a condensed package, making it easier to download & install. Thanks, Black Box."

You have to download daemon tools lite which you use to mount the .iso file, it then plays like a normal CD/DVD. then u have to run the setup.exe as administrator by right clicking on it and selecting ''run as administrator''. then the setup should do the rest 4 u, hope this helps"
