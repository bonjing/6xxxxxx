Dont know what cultmoovie is on about"
,LinShark11,2011-09-12T11:11Z,"cultmoovie, your post looks a bit silly, since eztv is famous for delivering quality releases without any passwords."

,chaiyont,2011-09-12T11:45Z,"Cult, stop using mommy's computer!!"
,klaushead,2011-09-12T11:51Z,"It works fine, except there seems to be some automatic sound equalization going on.
In quiet bits between speech the voume of background/white noise seems to increase, this is pretty annoying, I found the same with last weeks Breaking Bad too."

,ramboryan,2011-09-12T18:26Z,"God damn thats a good episode, can't understand why they are finishing this next season makes no sense to me.

Oh and
@klaushead
I have only known it to be like that, Thought it was for some reason intentional :S"
,M.C. Hammer,2011-09-12T21:00Z,"Klaushead and ramboryan are right. there's a definite sound issue with this and previous episode (Filenames ending in TLA).

My advice -avoid these TLA guys, go with ASAP or FQM"
,cherrybakewell,2011-09-12T21:19Z,Thanks. Always use your torrent and usually really happy with the quality. The last two eps though play perfect on the pc but when I convert them the lip sync goes really out. I use convertX2dvd. Never had this before. Any idea why?
,Bit-Step,2011-09-12T21:26Z,"This is the only American drama i am fixated on! 

It just gets more & more intriguing...........

you make TPB what it is. eztv = like a boss man"

,OCDoubler,2011-10-19T06:20Z,"Thank you eztv. You have no idea how you have made our life better stuck on a rock in southeast Alaska. If you ever want to fish, crab, shrimp... just say the word. My boat is yours!"
,cyberzed,2011-10-28T12:54Z,"Thanks for your uploads. Very happy with the quality of all the eztv episodes, although for some reason I had an audio synch problem this one and episode 8 when using ConvertXtoDVD. If anyone else has this problem, you need to set the source file audio for these episodes to -6000ms. "
