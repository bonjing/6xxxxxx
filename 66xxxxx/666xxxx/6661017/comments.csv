,khui,2012-02-28T05:46Z,"i'm writing to be friendly not to criticise. episode 13 was propered by BiA: 

CTU's release is missing the centre audio
channel (dialogue) at various points 
e.g 17m46s to 18m01s and 26m02s to 26m13s.

i can provide the episode if necessary. you could share the single episode as a separate torrent and link from here. 

all the best "
