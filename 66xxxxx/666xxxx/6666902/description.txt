Movies : Crime : VHS Rip : English
Please Note: Film not in the best condition, bumped up the bitrate a bit, the smaller the viewing size the better it looks. Watchable. The opening credits have much garble in them, it's in the source, i did not attempt to edit, movie is not like that, but the clarity is lacking.

Recommended only for the die-hard fan who has never seen it!
