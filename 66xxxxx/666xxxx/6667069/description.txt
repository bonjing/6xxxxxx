the album is not just one of the year's most beautiful, incisive albums, it's also the young singer-songwriter's most personal statement yet. '100 acres of sycamore'is a fleshed out return to acoustic sensibilities, but with a chamber-quartet closeness of strings featuring heavily. if 'empire' was 'bringing it all back home' then this is not so much regan's 'blonde on blonde' as his 'john wesley harding'.
