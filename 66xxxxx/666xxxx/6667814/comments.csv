,jager963,2011-09-11T22:33Z,once again thanks micky...btw what was wrong that needed fixing?
,mickyfinny,2011-09-11T23:19Z,"Modifications:

- Low RPM sound loop issue was solved.
- Clickable area of the GPS was extended (now covering the entire screen).
- Differential braking scale was adjusted.
- Correction to the brakes map for braking with left or right wheel independent.
- DoorÂ´s screw remained static and didnâ€™t move with the door. Now it is fixed
- Statics elements were adjusted to the level of the ground.
- Thermometer had a bug and was indicating wrong temperature. Fixed.
- Pop-up GPS showed a different button from the one in the VC. Fixed.
- MPH airspeed indicator marking (inner circle) was adjusted.
- Some corrections to the description of the aircraft were done.

We also added the autopilot on/off switch to the Autopilot light indicator because many people donâ€™t find the autopilot switch (which is located below the power section). Now both work as autopilot on/off switch.

If you go to avsim forums and check out the Carenado C337H Skymaster pages,it is acknowledged there were some bugs still present on its release.Thanx to all for seeding this beautiful craft.P.S. Also there are some useful tips on altitude etc."

,mickyfinny,2011-09-15T23:19Z,"I dont have a cracked version of ezdok 1.17,but what i do is rename the 1.15.exe from the install folder.Then copy over the 1.17.exe into the 1.15 folder,import aircraft settings etc then revert the 1.15 back to its original state.This is just my way of making things easier for me to do it this way."
