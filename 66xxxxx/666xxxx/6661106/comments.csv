,click2shaan,2011-09-08T20:18Z,a/v anyone plzz ????
,Torx8,2011-09-08T21:51Z,"how can you say ""excellent quality""? it's a CAM rip (350p or something) converted into 720p! it's utter shit.."
,soupcip,2011-09-08T21:54Z,"Watching the screenshots its a no download for me. It just seems the same ppv rip upscaled to 720 p, but the same quality can imo easily be obtained with half the resolution and file size.
I know I've seen alot 360p material much much better than this. If the source is crap, its kinda useless to do a conversion to 720p, only little gain can be achieved with quarterpixel enhancement and bidirectional encoding etc etc, but still, you cant really polish a turd is the old saying I believe."
,twilight_nexus,2011-09-09T01:01Z,the quality is crap.... but still a lot better than the TS prints. When is the blu-ray releasing ? seems like i've been waiting too long for this movie now...
,dreddian,2011-09-09T02:30Z,"i beg to differ on the polished turd

http://antoniomiceli.net/2011/07/16/the-art-of-the-demo-part-1/polished-poop/"
,soupcip,2011-09-09T03:08Z,"@whiteylion85, I cant upload anything better, no one can as of yet, cos there is no other source available. My point is its not of much use to upload stuff that has been uploaded many times, only slightly differently encoded. That doesn't mean I don't have the highest respect for .BONE cos he's a killer uploader ! Why you have to resort to namecalling says alot about you tho. Happy life boy :) "
,soupcip,2011-09-09T03:10Z,"LOL dreddian...but that turd isnt actually polished, its been ""re-modelled"" ...ok and polished afterwards ;)"
,blusniffer,2011-09-09T10:40Z,"Whoever created Cinavia should be made to watch as i polish that turd and say thank you as i curve-ball it into his face! 

CUNT!"
,ofb,2011-09-09T14:09Z,"jus tD/Led,  I'm sick and tired of you guys that don't know the difference between 720p HD and cheap cam ..this quality is total crap and a waste of my time"
,ofb,2011-09-09T14:12Z,"@whiteylion85 no one is complaining because of the quality, we are pissed because you lied and claimed it was 720p quality, when it isn't , thereby wasting everyone's time"
,andyg60,2011-09-09T14:54Z,"i think tpb should have like a shit section then all the cams and all that can go in there instead of placing thinks in the wrong location as this is. no disrespect to the bone he or she do good, but this is far from a highres movie"
,andyg60,2011-09-09T14:56Z,i think i will wait for aleast 11gig for this 1 aspecialy for all the action and special fx ..... peace.
,theshape31,2011-09-10T03:22Z,"This is an upscaled cam.  Someone literally recorded the PPV on a video camera.  This is so unbelievably awful.  These uploads should be deleted by a mod, or forced to change the title to what it actually is.  Please help vote these releases down."
,martronn,2011-09-10T04:13Z,Fucking CAM!! That's NOT (HD) 
,5amjr,2011-09-10T09:39Z,"I'm surprised there's no r5 around yet. Although amazon has a TBA (UK) about the release date some sites claim its september 30th.
Is this date for the US?"
,Pahapaavali,2011-09-10T09:46Z,"I should write pre-written txt for these things. HighRes -> high quality. Not just crap in bigger file sizes. No disrespect, but please, not to HiRes section. Really, please."
,KapteinRalph,2011-09-12T15:08Z,"so much bitching for people who choose to download instead of buying the dvd. STOP WINING! boehoe it's not a good rip, get a job and buy the damn thing if you cant wait"
,sanriver,2011-09-13T04:30Z,"@whiteylion85 
dumb fuck. that's what the comment section is for, telling other before they download that the quality is crap so they dont lose their time. idiot."
,blusniffer,2011-09-13T12:56Z,"@kapteinralph tell me where to buy the time machine dumbass and i'll go buy the movie!

Another Brainless Twat!"
,throwing_wheel,2011-09-13T15:46Z,"Some of you guys are so testy.  Sanriver is right, the comments serve the purpose of revealing the qualities and deficiencies of the rip.

The disk release should be in the last week of Sept, so it should be on trackers around Sept 23."
,5amjr,2011-09-15T13:47Z,"Exactly, the comments are the 2nd most important thing on PB after the torrents themselves. 
Without them we would go back to the time when you would DL 10 files and only 2 would be watchable. But we'r also able to thank u guys for good uploads.
Commentators let rip"
,danielwe,2011-09-16T23:29Z,"Thanks for torrent!

Anyhow i handled bout 5 minutes, gonna wait for better quality. Current quality is something i would recommend solely to the hardcore fan."
,mkdhdh,2011-09-17T14:47Z,damnn even a most of the cam's i download are better than this
,jorod74,2011-09-18T09:21Z,"it's funny- asshats here spend hours posting about how shoddy vids are, but can't be bothered to open a new tab or turn the tv on for one minute to catch the infinite number of times a movie's release is announced."
,adijkstra,2011-09-18T13:43Z,"All those whining people shut the fuck up.
If it is what it is then why bother screaming.
Be nice say what i is so people can realy on downloads.
By th way this was a dutchboy shouting to all you whinners."

,computerman_az,2011-09-20T03:51Z,All you assholes that complain about quality should go pay and see the movie at the theaters!! You are a bunch of whiny bitches
,Ki1l4U,2011-09-21T05:22Z,"I wouldn't complain about the quality if it was in the right section, this is the Highres section crappy CAM's don't go here so no wonder people are pissed .BONE please post in the right section."
