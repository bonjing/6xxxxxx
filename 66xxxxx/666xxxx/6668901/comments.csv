,deadxgirl,2011-09-12T08:38Z,"Someone please, is it fake?"
,yoke_man,2011-09-12T14:20Z,"I know I prob sound really stupid...but can anyone explain to me what ""dimension"" means? And if it's just better to wait for the AVI version? 

""Dimension"" in this case is the release group that originally rip`d this episode for us from hd`tv or blueray, chosed the format and so on...

If you wont hd this is it (mkv), avi is usally divx or xvid but to make it more confusing there is also a release group called avi but in that case its a Release group name NOT a format.

Cherrs, hope it helped! "

,RaW-D-Coy,2011-09-12T17:03Z,"the pw is: trbb893248123412 but it says in the .rar that it isn't correct so this is just a clean scam!
"
,Evilution,2011-09-12T18:01Z,"RaW-D-Coy: skip the crack, why on earth would you try to use some password for a file that isn´t packed/pw-protected?
It´s a MKV-container, just play it in a videoplayer.
If you can´t get MKV to work sell your computer and stick with the TV."
,HatsuneMikuFan,2011-09-12T19:07Z,"To everyone hopefully reading this please do not waste your time this is fake.I swear they want you to do a survey and you will not get anything in return you will be disappointed as i have been.DONT TRUST ""MOVIE"" TORRENTS THAT YOU HAVE TO EXTRACT EVER!!"

,yuriprimes,2011-09-13T02:04Z,"DibyaTPB, you are a fucking tool bag and should be banned from this site. 
This torrent's rar file requires you to go to a website, fill out some survey with your address and email and then downloads a bogus text file that has the 'password' that actually doesnt even fucking work. 
Fuck you you fucking faggot."
