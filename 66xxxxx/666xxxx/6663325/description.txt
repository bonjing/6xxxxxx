IMPORTANT! I got an opportunity to add the name of each (!) pictures complete list of possible tags for a template site from which it was produced. This process is quite time-consuming, I will not 

deny, but doable. It will be made in several stages, but will lead to the fact that all have to download again, because renaming of files will not allow distribution of hash downloaded the new torrent 

file. But the question is whether to add the tags? Just make it much easier to distribute and transform almost analog gelbooru and other chans, enough to enter the tag and ops - all the pictures in 

front of your eyes!
Well, is it worth doing?
