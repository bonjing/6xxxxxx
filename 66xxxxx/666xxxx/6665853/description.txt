It is often disappointing quality to hear analog quality transfers
to CD when clearly they could always have done better with existing technologies
even back then I suspect - oh well there is certainly a great difference
in these re-mastered versions that aim for digital quality so as to
come closer to what we got from the vinyl disc playback Dual turntable with
an Ortofon cartridge, hooked when hooked up to a nice Cambridge amplifier
along with JBL or Bose speakers perhaps. Why not Grundig across the board even!


Anyways this is the Eagles 1971-1975 greatest hits CD in remastered quality
along with some missing songs - so we could call it their greatest hits
(expanded) CD. Live and learn!

cheers!
