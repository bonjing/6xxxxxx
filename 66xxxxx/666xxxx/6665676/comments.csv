,wilhel1812,2011-09-10T21:32Z,"I’m seeding all I’ve got here, just give it a day and it’ll hopefully be ok. I will be uploading at 5-600kbps for a week or so. I have a ratio of 2.5 now. Please bear with me, because it’s my first big upload. "
,wilhel1812,2011-09-11T16:42Z,"And just like that, it’s living on its own with lots of seeds :)"
,Sanicle,2011-09-12T14:12Z,"I hate it when people expect torrents to be instantly active. P2P doesn't work that way people! That said, great work wilhel1812 :)"
,Ecclesiast,2011-09-17T18:29Z,Thanks!
,Darkussik,2011-09-18T16:20Z,"Folks, no worries about this torrent is dead. There are dozens peers and a couple of dozens seeding right now. Now it's downloading at 1.4k, no worries at all. And I will stay seeding 24x7 with 1.7k top cap. Great torrent, please keep it alive!"
,Jaylez,2011-09-23T00:17Z,Great quality! Seeding.
,mjau.,2011-09-24T23:12Z," THANKS SO MUCH!!!! I love futurama, will definetly seed when finished :)"
,Snotmaw,2011-09-29T00:11Z,the episodes are organized in tv order and not in production order (they aired them out of order on tv). oh well not a big deal
,wilhel1812,2011-10-10T21:34Z,"Yeah, I felt that was the right way to organize it. I wonder what order they will be organized in in the DVD"
,SteFFgame,2011-10-11T21:42Z,thank you!
,Kastur,2011-10-17T19:35Z,You're my new best friend.  Thank you so much good sir.
,facebreak,2011-11-01T14:05Z,"Hey retard, the description says 184MB per episode, when they are actually 175MB a piece. Just felt the desire to needlessly point out your error, shit for brains."
,anticow,2011-11-10T21:10Z,hey retard #2 nobody cares about 9 megs thanks
,ili2882,2011-11-25T23:53Z,"TV or DVD Rips?
There's no info on the torrents description, how about resolution and codec?
As only 1/2 of season 6 was released on DVD I believe these are TV Rips am I wrong?"
,ili2882,2011-11-26T13:36Z,Yea TV Rips second half of season 6 will be released on DVD/BD december 20 2011
,meshugeah,2011-11-29T17:38Z,"nice, thanks. Will seed at least to ratio 1.5"

,ninoscrpt,2012-04-06T18:26Z,"Hey facebreak, he's actually right, they are ~184MB per episode, you're talking about ~175MiB.

Nowadays we prefer to use M (mega) as 10^6 as the SI dictates, and Mi (Mebi) as 2^20 IEC dictates.

He probably has a Mac, or works in a HD manufacturing plant, where they use MB instead of MiB (mainly to inflate numbers).

Don't go treating nice fellow pirates as shit please, they are at least better than us leachers. :P"
,DONT_READ_THIS_USERNAME,2012-04-13T23:53Z,'ninoscrpt'  --- shut up and quit rambling
,Kasraz,2012-04-14T07:53Z,Yea Facebreak you are the stupid retard that are being rude for no reason at all. Even if you were right witch you are not thats totally uncalled to call that nice person sharing Futurama with us that for 9 lousy MB. The problem with internet is that any fucking loser jerk think they can write what ever they want. If you live in Stockholm sweden we can meet and i can give you a lesson that you wont forget as long as you live. (If you dont want to learn and are stupid enough to meet me anyway maybe that wont bee so long)
,Kasraz,2012-04-14T08:02Z,"And ""DONT_READ_THIS_USERNAME "" shut the fuck up! If you are not the same asshole you are some other asshole. I dont know why ninoscript bother to explain obvious things to stupid fucks butt he or they is right it is 184 MB. And all you negative haters are totally wrong. First of all get a life and then you can get a decent computer!"
,Hudafuq,2012-04-22T10:12Z,"@wilhel1812 A/V 10/10 for what it is, really wish I would've Googled the episode list before downloading, though... :T Kinda my own mistake, already watched all these on Netflix.

Side-note:
I love the tards dueling semantics about MiB and MB when the tilde mark has obviously been carelessly overlooked by everyone involved. Since you're all about giving lessons to people less informed than yourselves, I suppose I'll humor you.

Pro-tip:
~184 means ""less than"" or ""up to"" 184 while 184~ means starting at 184 and increasing.

Not to mention it clearly says MB and not MiB so where the comment ""Unless he works in a blah blah and derpalerps MiB instead of MB"" comes from is beyond me.

^Episode list, for anyone downloading this torrent."
,kronos_0,2012-04-29T07:18Z,"""(Problems with magnets links are fixed by upgrading your torrent client!)"" It says, but ever since they switched to only magnets I can't pick individual files to download, I can only download the whole thing. Does anyone know why this is? I have the latest version of uTorrent."
,NicThePoet93,2012-04-30T14:12Z,Why is it not in English? Why is no one else commenting on this? Clearly I'm missing something...
,Stopperan,2012-05-13T22:27Z,"@kronos_0

You can set the priority ""do not download"" after uTorrent has done downloading file list (when your download is starting to commence on full speed) on every file you don't want to get.

P.S. Anybody knows more synonymes to ""download"" ;) I ran out of 'em."
