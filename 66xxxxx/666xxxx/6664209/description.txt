Struck by lightning, an endearing little robot known only as \"Number 5\" escapes from an experimental electronics firm. Technician Newton Crosby (Steve Guttenberg) and his indecipherable East Indian assistant, Ben Jabituya (Fisher Stevens), set out to locate Number 5 before the military can go through with its plans to destroy the robot. Number 5 takes refuge with loopy Stephanie Speck (Ally Sheedy), who is convinced that the mechanical man is an extraterrestrial. Hoping to teach the \"alien\" all about Earth, she fills Number 5\'s memory banks with reams of pop culture and then the real fun begins.
