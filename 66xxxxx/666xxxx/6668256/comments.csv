Thanks for the link.
I only added subs that were uploaded as 14 cd subs,
I don't have time and nerves to download separate subs for each ep apart.
I wish folks would upload the subs with one go, 14 in our case."

,Korbendallas,2011-09-12T18:35Z,"Thanks!
Just one question.. Why do you encode to dts 755kbit instead of ac3 640kbit? and what program do u use? SurCode?"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-09-13T05:57Z,"@lailabagge
Or rather ""Dear [mkvonly] on earth, thank you so much for this wonderful torrent!"" ;-)

@Korbendallas
The only good AC3 is the original from studio (Not made with software).
 You can't make a good AC3 640 with any software (or at least not that I know of).
DTS 755 is much more crispy-clear, more superior then AC3 640.
And yes Surcode is the baby ;-) + eac3to.
I make them though 1500 KB/s for movies like Avatar, Fast and furious, Transformers etc, where the sound is brain blowing quality."

Thanks a lot."
,Lightfigter,2011-10-22T23:22Z,"Even my comp couldn't show this without tearing and distortion:

Win7 with SSD bootdisk, Phenom II X4 3,4 Ghz and 4 Gb ram. So it shouldn't be the hardware. I use Mediaplayer classic 114 with fddshow codecs.

Anyone an idea?"
,Lightfigter,2011-10-22T23:26Z,"Why does my comp show distortion and tearing

I have a Phenom II X4 3,4 Ghz + 4gb Ram with Win 7 on a SSD. I use Mediaplayer Classic 114 with fddshow codec. 

Anyone any idea?

You never mentioned what video card you have. I think that's more important than the CPU. Check out the HTPC forums. You can get by playing 1080p with low CPUs, but a video card needs to have the right stuff. Like DXVA or VC1 video acceleration. My Nvidia Geforce GTX 285 really blows at VC1 acceleration. I get better VC1 from a $50 video card."
