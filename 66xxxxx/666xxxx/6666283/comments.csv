Morons.

If you don't like it, don't download it.

Thanks for the great up EZ."
,choucho529,2011-09-11T02:32Z,How are there over 500 seeders and I'm only getting 30-50 kb/s speeds with dsl? This is the only thing i'm downloading...
,urje69,2011-09-11T04:27Z,"Wow how can someone think this is a rar?  Its only so easy to click on the ""Files: 1"" on the top of this screen, and it shows its mkv not rar.  

Rar's are normally a bunch of files for something huge and this only has 1 file.  

I have downloaded from eztv for a long time and never had any problems with their torrents (as long as it was an actual eztv account). "
,rawree,2011-09-11T05:24Z,"Awesome download as always from EZTV. 

Moronic comments as ever from the hater twats."
,Evilution,2011-09-11T05:27Z,"Wish there was a function on TBP to downrate retarded comments like the one saying itÂ´s fake...

Thanks for the up EZTV!"
,Skram0,2011-09-11T05:54Z,"So are these 24p NTSC, or 25p PAL? The quality of the WEB-DL (web download versions) kick ass. Pure uncompressed looking quality. But the Doctor Who versions, they are 25p PAL. But seem to play okay in an NTSC XBMC."
,Evilution,2011-09-11T08:01Z,"This one is ""Video: MPEG4 Video (H264) 1280x720 25.00fps [English (Video 1) [Default]]"" so that should be PAL? :p"

~!! CCCP USERS, UPDATE !!~

Anyone having trouble with these FoV 720p releases of Doctor Who, go get the newest CCCP 7-30-2011.
I was using the 9-9-09 pack and it just wouldn't play but this fixed it."

* NOT WORKING ON POPCORN HOUR DEVICES *

Since several weeks, any FOV-torrent of Doctor Who episodes, will not work on my up-to-date Popcorn Hour C200 (= Networked Media Tank with Syabas SW).  It will not play or it even chokes up the entire device (HW restart needed)...

Does anyone know why this is?
Is FOV using another incompatible Codec, EZTV?

Thanks for any feedback!
And for the upload too, ofcourse.
