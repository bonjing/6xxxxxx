,MySecrets,2011-09-13T16:17Z,"This document appears to be a fraud. The first and last sections have been removed, titled ""Indian Muslims unhappy over their leaders' weak response to terror acts: WikiLeaks"" and ""US feels India has 180m Muslims"", respectively, as well as all links to the author's Blogspot. I didn't compare the files for other disinformation. I also didn't verify that my ""original sources"" are completely original.

The original, previously unseeded until now, torrent is at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6662069/Wikileaks_on_India_a_Compilation_by_Ashraf_Part-1

Changing text is a strong form of censorship that we need to be aware of."
