,whitestriped,2011-09-13T09:07Z,"Excellent quality -- just as good as TVTeam's releases. 
A/V - 10/10"
,DoctorWhat,2011-09-25T16:54Z,"I'm sure this is great, but is there a version in AVI format at 175MB, like there used to be for all eps up to the end of season 4? 
My computer is sadly rather outdated and can't cope with the MKV video format. "
