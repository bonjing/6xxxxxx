Sorry, but I've seen wayyyy better bluray quality and yeah I know, it's still only 700 mb. It's still better than DVD quality for sure.

Subtitles don't seem to work with Windows 7 WMP. Trying to find codecs for it"

,toastedsocks,2012-01-28T08:33Z,"I must say YIFY, you are the first uploader in a while that I completely agree with on how your content is compressed, you don't sacrifice quality, yet don't waste space. In addition, you have high res versions of most of the stuff I'm currently looking for. From here on out, I'm just going to check your page before anywhere else for my video needs."
