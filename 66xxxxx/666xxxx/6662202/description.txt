- - -
Matt Baker and Clare Balding head to the North Pennines for a hike and bike tour. Matt hitches a ride on a trike to visit some of the spectacular sights here. He drops in at a winery where beetroot is the main ingredient. Clare's on foot, finding out what makes this place ideal shooting country. As the season gets underway, she meets a group of women mixing glamour with game shooting. James Wong is also in the Pennines. He's discovering how planting trees is helping to train soldiers and increase the UK's woodland cover. Elsewhere, with bovine TB in England at its highest level in decades, the government is proposing killing badgers as a solution. If a cull goes ahead, how will it work in practice and what impact it will have - Tom Heap investigates. Down on the farm, Adam is in search of a new sheepdog.
