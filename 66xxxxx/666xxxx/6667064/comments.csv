Sorry for that, posted on the wrong torrent and by the way the password doesn't works."

The audio has soooo many clicks and pops. The creator really needs to encode the audio better. I had to watch it with the sound off.....but fortunately, the Strikeforce commentators are horrible anyway, so I probably would have turned off the audio anyway.
This audio issue seems to occur quite a bit with this creator.  Really f'n annoying considering it's very easy to avoid.  Maybe spend the extra minutes making sure all is good, rather than rushing to be the first one to post it?  It'll help your reputation.
But all in all, the video is the most important factor....and the video quality of this event is great.  This was a great event...lots of good finishes.  Thanks.(just work on the audio a bit more)"
