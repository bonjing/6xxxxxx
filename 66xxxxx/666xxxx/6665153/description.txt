Portal 2 co-op maps from http://www.thinkingwithportals.com/
All downloaded 2011-09-09. More maps & updated versions are available for free on http://www.thinkingwithportals.com/, this is just a convenience pack

Credits go to original map authors, I just downloaded & prepared the files for playing, so you don't have to spend 2 hours on it like I did

if anyone (in the future) has a better collection, please make a similar torrent
