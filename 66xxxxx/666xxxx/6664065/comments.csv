,Mr.Lucifero,2011-12-21T21:24Z,Fantastic quality of a near-perfect Swashbuckling Film...Here's my rating guide...I only give out V/9 & V/10 rating for actual HD & Blu-ray quality equivalent upload....And I don't rate the audio unless it's particularly bad....Anyway here's my 2 cents....V/M=8.5/9....Top class DVD quality equivalent.....Thanx mfccorrea.... 8)
