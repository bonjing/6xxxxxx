Crashing the Lines 2 of 3 - iPod

DVD Rip to iPod

Producer: Christopher J. Petrilli

Trained in the Philippines by Filipino legend Grandmaster Ciriaco "Cacoy" Canete himself, 8th degree black belt Christopher Petrilli has distilled his knowledge of Japanese aikido, Indonesian silat and Filipino Doce Pares eskrima into an elevated system of stick fighting that goes far beyond anything previously captured on video.

Volume 2 teaches different lines that allow you to explosively disarm your opponent and effortlessly maneuver him into the arm bar position. Then, proving that anything you can do with the stick end you can do with the punyo, Petrilli shows you how to perform the punishing locks, throws and chokes previously learned with just a few inches of stick.

Show someone you love them, hit'em with a stick!
