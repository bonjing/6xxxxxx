The rain in the first scene of 1x01, for instance, makes it quite hard to hear the dialogue, as there is a lot of extra noise being generated due to it being hard to compress.  48Kbps stereo is asking a bit much even for AAC, I'm afraid.  I think allowing an extra 10MB per file and going up to 64K would have been a smarter choice."

Have you compared it with the larger xvid encode? Get a clue, at 272p and small filesize...why do you expect it to be equivalent to xvids or mkvs or mp4s that are higher bitrate and from 4 to 15 times larger filesize? What is wrong with your brain and where are all of your stellar encodes?"
