,ThePirateQueen,2011-09-12T04:13Z,"I was finally able to complete my download, yay!  I will seed for a while now.  :)  Thanks for sharing this each week, really appreciate it."
,moonsoup,2011-09-14T14:59Z,"I had the same problem of being stuck at 83%.. so, I went to look for another copy of this.  And I found one... copied the video into this one and fixed it... Then I seeded it to 10 other people at first, so I am probably the one you saw at 100% but wasn't uploading. I just wanted to get it to 10 other people quick. And here it is!!! That was last Friday, I think..."
