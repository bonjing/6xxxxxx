About the Author

James Ford


James Ford lives and works in the relatively sedate Midlands of England, and is constantly thankful that he doesn't have to contend with public transport or large volumes of traffic on a regular basis. Occasionally being stuck behind a tractor for several miles is a small price to pay for that! Macromedia Flash 8 represented his first serious interaction with a programming language, an epiphany whereupon his BA in Design for Interactive Media became far more focused on the Programming side of things than the Art (although it turned out okay).

He considers himself to be fortunate to have encountered the Flash Platform when he did, as during that time between first contact and today, the Flash Platform has evolved at just the right pace to enable him to keep up with the latest shiny new features.
