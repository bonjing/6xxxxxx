Each great blues musician has a special quality that sets him or her apart from the others as a true master. By that standard, Jeff Chaz is one of the greatest living blues musicians today; he is on every level a master. Genius is a word that gets tossed about like old socks sometimes, but in this case the word is accurately descriptive of Jeff as a person â€“ forget the musical talents. He is somewhat eccentric, disheveled (in an Einstein sort of way) and flamboyant but deeply spiritual, gracious, and kind. His amazing intellect is evident in his lyrics, derived of a life filled with experiences that rival any Deep South blues iconâ€™s painful past. He exudes brilliance as a melody writer, poignant instinct as a guitarist, and is a beautiful singer with tremendous range and a style of delivery that bends oneâ€™s heartstrings. He is prolific in his ability to write, record, produce, and promote his music. His performances are nothing short of electrically stunning. He has written and produced 3 original albums and has many more projects that are fertile and awaiting naissance under the right circumstances.
