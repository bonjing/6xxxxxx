,raghu1985,2011-09-22T17:45Z,is possible to tell at what duration of the film they have extra scenes for fast five? 
,Schizoman,2011-10-13T00:16Z,"This isn't the Extended Version of the movie as the title of the torrent suggests.  For one thing, it's only 126 minutes when both Amazon and IMDB list the Extended Version at 130 minutes.  Plus, right when the movie starts (after the Universal logo/intro) it says in big letters, ""ORIGINAL FILM.""  So thanks for the movie, I just wish I didn't spend 3 hours on a crappier connection than I normally have just to be disappointed.

It looks and sounds good, though it's a smaller size video than I prefer.  Good upload, just please name your torrents accordingly in the future.

Thanks. "
