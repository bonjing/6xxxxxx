This is an excellent quartet album that really showcases great trombonist J.J. Johnson. Accompanied by pianist Tommy Flanagan, bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Max Roach, Johnson alternates standards such as "Hello, Young Lovers" and "Gone with the Wind" with originals, including the two part "Blue Trombone," and shows listeners why he is still considered one of the greatest jazz trombonists of all time. ~ Scott Yanow
