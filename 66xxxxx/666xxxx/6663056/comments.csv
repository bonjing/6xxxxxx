,ifire,2011-09-09T18:43Z,"Amazing! Definitely going to buy the deluxe version after hearing this! Once again, Evanescence blow me away with their awesome music."
[T],exit-reality,2011-09-09T20:03Z,Can anyone load something lossless???? Nice it's posted but the sub-par bit rate makes it distorted and hard to listen to.
,tomasSC,2011-09-09T20:11Z,"I would say that 192kbp is above PAR.
Thanks"
,DJBigal,2011-09-09T23:39Z,This is an other transcode ... the real bitrate is  less than 128 kbps ... poor quality ...
[T],exit-reality,2011-09-10T00:24Z,"Anything under 256 sounds like crap, the cymbals distort the music sounds overly compressed and all the dynamics are lost.

If anyone gets a copy and can post a flac file I'll seed the hell out of it."
,njournal,2011-09-10T17:28Z,"Okay, guys! Quit already! It's not about quality - if you want the perfect quality, wait another month and buy the goddamn CD! As for me - I will. And yes, if I manage to find lossless - be damn sure I'd upload it!"
,FoxyBoy,2011-09-15T02:15Z,"You're right, njournal.  It's about you getting the glory of having the first torrent out for it.  Trying to collect as many seeds as possible?  I don't think so, sir.  I'll trust a pink skull opinion over this.  If you do try to upload again, please do find a better copy."
,Flurff,2011-09-15T15:19Z,To all you normal people out there and not music torrenting elitists douche bags  - This is fine until you can buy the album.
,njournal,2011-09-15T16:32Z,"FoxyBoy, man! It's never about being the first. When the album is leaked, there is ONLY ONE quality possible - in the case of Evanescence, it was 192 b/s. I downloaded it from somewhere else and uploaded it here, because honestly, I expected TPB to be the first tracker after demonoid to have it. Yeah, the ""pink skull"", nicknamed exit-reality is absolutely right - everything below 256 sounds like a morning shit. But when there's 192, you listen to 192 until the FLACs fly or until you buy the album. You dont transcode it to 320 and try to get the most ot it..."
,cobain87,2011-10-01T14:45Z,"I think it's hilarious how people complain about the quality, ""the low bit rate makes it sound distorted and hard to listen to..."" Wahhhhhh! It sounds just fine! I mean jesus, you get the whole album before anyone else does and for free. If you want studio quality then go buy the damn cd when it comes out. Pretty simple. People don't appreciate anything anymore, just crazy."
