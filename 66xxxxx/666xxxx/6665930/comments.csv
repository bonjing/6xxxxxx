,Delsher,2011-09-11T14:57Z,Thanks! keep up the good work! could you also upload some Blu-ray rips of  The Home Alone trilogy and The Polar Express in 1080p full HD with HD master audio that would be awesome. It's only 4 months left for christmas. 
,MVC78,2011-11-07T23:47Z,This rip is HUUUUUUGE. I don't understand the difference between this and the 14 GB rip on here. 
,MajiNPic1,2011-11-11T11:10Z,"@MVC78
This is a full copy of 3D Blu-ray. You'll see the difference clearly if you watch it in 46""+ TV, especially a dark scenes."
,zebraapple,2012-01-11T05:45Z,"Thanks for the upload.  I've download this iso, but I don't have a blue ray burner.  Is there a good utility I can used to convert this to mkv 3D HSBS format so I can watch it on my 3D TV?"
