,USMC0331M2VET,2011-09-16T08:11Z,works good with VLC. had to slightly adjust audio to be insync. video is cropped but only minor (a few heads chopped off here and there) video gets very dark during night/low light scenes but I didn't miss anything. it's not a dvd-rip so don't expect dvd quality
,zubair_love,2011-09-20T15:19Z,after waiting a lot i m going to download this.....hope video is good.....
,wikaman1,2011-10-06T13:05Z,"watched this last night.

v-8 (10 being DVD so it was very good)
A-7 (better than most cams but the occasional loud static noise)
M-7 (pretty good, just light entertainment, don't expect the best movie ever)"
