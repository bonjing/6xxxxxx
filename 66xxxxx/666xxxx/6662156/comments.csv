Install it, then use the crack, copy over where the file and overwrite it. Very Simple to install. 

Thanks. "
,InterMike,2011-10-20T09:28Z,"I dont' see any folder. I used the patch, and it said that it had patched it, and it created a file Pamela.exe, and nothing else happened - now folder or anything.

Did I do it wrong? (I still ""Get Activation Code"" and other registration links in the ""Help"" dropdown menu.)

Thanks."
,dirol10,2011-10-24T00:55Z,"@InterMike, use the crack in its original downloaded folder and grab the extracted file Pamela.exe to the installation folder and replace it with the original one. That's how it worked with me. I'm using windows 7."
,spunkster,2011-12-06T00:56Z,"I'm confused. I followed the instructions precisely. Ran the crack, clicked Yes, it created a new Pamela.exe file, then clicked No to close the crack. Cut and pasted the new Pamela.exe to the installation folder to replace the original, larger Pamela.exe file. It still says ""pending authorization"" and the help menu has registration links. What now?"

,mohab007,2012-02-18T03:35Z,crack is not working :S
,gyeazle,2012-03-06T20:42Z,"The crack worked like a charm for me. I think people have been using it wrong. Take the crack file pamela.for.skype.professional.v4.8.0.42-ismail.exe and place it into your installation folder (C:program filespamela) then run it, and click on ""yes"" it will then patch the file. Don't run it and copy the file it creates into the installation directory, that will not work."
