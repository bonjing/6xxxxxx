Release Notes:

This movie was shot for the ultra-wide aspect ratio of 2.76:1. Surprisingly, the movie looks quite alright.

 The film begins with a 4m40s Overture,in the middle it features an intermission and entra'cte of 2 minutes. So don't be alarmed during the first couple of minutes of the movie 

Enjoy Marlon Brando and his English accent in this movie.
