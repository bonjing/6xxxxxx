I took the Print that you created, and stripped off your Tamil Soundtrack and dubbed in an English Soundtrack.  This was the ONLY 3D Anaglyph Print out there.  I also did some other tweeking to it also.  Just read read my notes.  I believe in giving credit, where credit is due.  Thanks again! Here's where it can be found: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6723045"
