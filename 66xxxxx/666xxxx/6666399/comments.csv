Surrounded by snow, blocked in by huge drifts from the South, the Frontier Force have to rescue a family who own a farm.

Tons of pure white snow everywhere, and what do they say?

They were running out of water!!!

I mean, pardon!!!

What in the blue blazes of Hades do they think snow is, ay?

Running out of water, i mean how daft is that, all they needed to do is melt some virgin snow, of which surrounded them, i mean tens of tons of the stuff, thousands of gallons of water right there, all they need do is melt it.

That has got to be the stupidest thing i've heard in a very long time, too dumb to be funny even.

Surrounded by snow and they're running out of water, WTF!!!"
