You don't need any tracker at all to upload @ TPB. Just enable DHT properly while creating the .torrent file.
If the tracker is at all required to be included; it is best way to visit trackon.org for the live statistics and pick one active."
[T],Pongydog,2011-10-16T01:50Z,"This is a lot of good. 

I can't download the list because the 2 trackers that the uploder has used on the torrent itself are not working. 


So it's a text file contaning a list of working trackers uploaded using 2 trackers that are not working. I think this is a clear case of irony."
