And after you read all this, close your eyes and listen to John Lennon's ""imagine"""
,captain-under,2011-09-10T01:56Z,"Religion is passed on from parents to children 
Kind of like the aids virus 
The god you worship depends not on truth but merely in what country you were born 
And what set of lies your parents taught you
Very few people choose their  Religion
Who would choose as a adult to believe  the crazy shit  that all Religions preach as truth
Remember this crap was written in the bronze age

It must be great to be 14."
,hijaz79,2011-09-10T09:35Z,"In the comfort of your chair in the safey of you home it is easy to reject religion.
But, if you were in a sinking ship, or in a falling plane with failed engines, or even stuck in an elevator between floors in a skyscarper...
in these situations, 99% of the people pray to god to save them.

True that most of our beliefs about religion were inherited from our parents and are influenced by where we were born and raised. But we are living in the information age, and we have all the resources to enable us find the truths about religion."

You are looking for simple answers to complex and difficult questions. Sorry, I cannot be of help. I can only try to explain my previous comment.

1- The definition of 'Religion' is: a collection of cultural systems, belief systems, and worldviews that establishes symbols that relate humanity to spirituality and moral values. (see Wikipedia) Therefore, by definition, every person has a religion. In one person's religion, he believe in God, in the Prophets, in Angels, in the life after death, in the paradise and hell, ..etc. In another person's religion, he does not believe in God, nor in the Prophets, nor in the hereafter, nor in the paradise and hell, ..etc.

2- In the religion of those who do not believe in the existence of a creator, life was created by coincidence in nature. They believe in Darwin's theory of evolution to explain the existence of the human beings. We may call their religion: Darwinism; and their god is Nature. But, Darwinism does not offer itself as a source of moral values and cultural systems. Also, Nature cannot be the source of moral values and cultural systems. Thus both of Darwinism and Nature fail to provide us with a complete religion.

3- Throughout the history of humanity, man has been searching for a source of knowledge to form the basis of his religion. The books in this upload tell us that there existed many religions. The greatest religions that are dominating the world now are: Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, Judaism, Sikhism, Taoism, and Zoroastrianism (see: Palmer Ă˘âŹâ World Religions). These religions differ on who originally established the religion and what are the sources of the details of each religion. None the less, they all share the common belief in the existence of a supreme deity (or deities) that man must worship. (this explain my comments that during time of duress, 99% of the people seek this supreme deity (or deities) to save them)

4-  Alternatively, a person may think he is knowledgeable, strong, rich, independent, .. and that he can rejects all established religions, and can be the source of his own religion. In some extreme cases he may think that he is God Himsel. This person needs to imagine himself in a situation of duress to discover whether he is really a god or not. 

5- When several religions exist that differ in the details of their beliefs, then one of these religions is true, accurate, or authentic; the others are false,  corrupted, or outdated. We are living in the information age; we have all the tools that enable us to discern the true religion from the false ones.

You forgot my point #1. By rejecting other peopls' religion, you are adopting another religion, which is atheism in your case.

There is consierable amout written about atheism. I am not sure if the space here allows us to address it. 

My hesitation to discuss proofs to the existence of God is because  the subject needs considerable space and time. In these kind of discussions I prefer to refer those who are interested to find the proofs through other means.

I am surprised that you claimed victory for atheism after 2-3 comments and counter-comments. I never claimed to be a prophet or a religious leader. I believe the issues of religious and god need to be personal issues of extreme importance. Every one should study the matter seriously, and start his personal journey to discover the truth."
,hijaz79,2011-09-14T14:48Z,"Another reason that make me hesitate discussing the proofs of the existence of god here is because you can only discuss these issues in general terms to a certian level. Then you have to be more specific and present the arguments of a specific religion.

Discussing the Islamic beliefs here is bound to incite another round of hate-comments against Islam. 

Those who are interested in reading books about the subject written by Muslim writer, I suggest to them the series of books written by Harun Yahya (more than 200 books available in English). They are available on the intenet.
