    Bored farmer's daughter sets out to make it in the big city. She gets    
    mixed up with freaks, perverts and degenerates and winds up a            
    stripper in New Orleans.                                                 
                                                                             
    Wholesome Judy Collins becomes a GIRL IN TROUBLE when she defends her    
    virtue by killing a man, then promptly loses that virtue by hiding       
    out as a lingerie-model-turned-stripper! Wanting to experience "a        
    taste of life" before marrying Johnny, her small-town sweetheart,        
    Judy hitches a ride to New Orleans, kills a man who attacks her, and     
    ends up washing blood off her brassiere in a flea-bag hotel: "Would I    
    ever feel clean again?" On the advice of an old hooker, Judy takes a     
    dubious modeling job only to get attacked again! Thinking things         
    can't get any worse, she struts her stuff on the stage of the Club       
    Flamingo when who should enter but her boyfriend Johnny....
