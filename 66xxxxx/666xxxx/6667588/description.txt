The field of fingerprinting for personal identification and criminal investigation is progressing at a rapid rate. Numerous research projects are devoted to fingerprint detection techniques and identification issues, and recent debate focuses on the admissibility of fingerprint evidence in US courts. In light of these events, as well as the previous lack of one volume that brings together the scientific and legal aspects of this discipline, the time is ideal for an easily accessible resource that gathers together and analyzes the latest findings and techniques related to fingerprint science.
Fingerprints and Other Ridge Skin Impressions features the insight of a recognized team of authorities, including contributors from a key institution for forensic research. Chapters cover all aspects of the subject including the formation of friction ridges on the skin, the deposition of latent prints, the detection and enhancement of such marks, recording of fingerprint evidence, and fingerprint identification itself. Recent advances in statistical interpretation, fingerprint detection techniques, and computer technology are also discussed in detail.
This practical techniques manual is an ideal text for practitioners working in the field of fingerprint detection and identification, as well as anyone studying forensic science at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. There is also sufficient background material for legal professionals and police in need of an introduction to the critical subject of fingerprinting.
