On Modern Collective, Kai Neville brought on the six most brilliant performers surfing could muster, and the academy approved. For his new collaboration, Kai rallies a dozen more surfers â€” including the original six â€” for Lost Atlas, a project to defy all norms and expectations. A location based film shot in under 12 months will take the veiwer on a candid jaunt into surfing today.
