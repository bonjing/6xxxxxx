A charming tale set in the 1900s, this stirring story focuses on a coal mine in Yorkshire, UK and the "pit ponies" that were used to haul the coal bins out of the darkness of the pits. Unfortunately the owner of the mine decides to increase profits by destroying the ponies and replacing them with steam engines, so the children come up with a cunning plan to save the animals. The children are caught taking the ponies and all looks lost until a tragic accident where the mine explodes, trapping the men underground. Only the ponies can rescue them.
