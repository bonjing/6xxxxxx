,ThiefintheNight,2011-10-01T09:51Z,"I'm interested to know if this actually works as it is designed to, because, the copy I've used appears to work fine but doesn't. This software is structured to build a master page, which is a bit like a template, allow the objects of that master page to be incorporated into subsequent pages, and then those pages be developed as the user wishes. BUT, what happens is that the master page objects are not added to the second page, AND, when the user hits Save, or Save As, it will only save the new page as the master, thereby losing all the previous work. 

Serif have this cracked. By that I mean that after registration further coding is added anonymously to enable the software to operate fully. A pirated download may provide a serial number to make it install but it doesnt provide the coding to make it fully operational.

And I assume most people who download Serif products do not come back to the torrent site to tell of their experience.

If you have a different tale please let us know."
