Plot
Jake Humphrey presents all the action from the 13th round of the season, held at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza (Start-time 1.00pm). Sebastian Vettel returned to winning ways in Belgium last time out, thus extending his lead over his team-mate and closest rival Mark Webber to 92 points, with Fernando Alonso 10 points further back. Alonso became the first Ferrari driver to win in Italy since Michael Schumacher in 2006 when he took the honours last year, with McLaren's Jenson Button finishing second and Alonso's team-mate Felipe Massa in third place. Commentary by Martin Brundle and David Coulthard.
