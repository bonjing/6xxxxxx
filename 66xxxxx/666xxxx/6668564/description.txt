Aeon Flux Uncompressed

All Liquid Television (LT) and MTV 1/2 hour episodes in both their original (OR) and remastered (RM) formats in uncompressed mpeg2. 

The sources include the VHS boxset, the first print DVD, and the Collectors 3 Disc DVD set.

I did not like the overdubbed "Lucas'd" versions of the remasters despite their visual quality, so I included the originals.

When possible I used the better quality versions of episodes (first print DVD) over the VHS versions. 

The extra files are from XBMC scraping and there is a problem with the database on the episode "War" but I manually edited it for the time being to point to the correct URL.

If anyone would like to encode these to a more manageable x264 format ( hint hint ) please feel free to.

I've also included some Aeon artwork and Peter Chung Special Features.

Thanks and help seed!
