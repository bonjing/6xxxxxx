However, it's season 3 begins with Utopia or Deuteranopia, not season 1 (see [url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_%C3%86on_Flux_episodes[/url]).

also, technically, MPEG2 is considered a form of compression...whereas VOB is actually lossless."

I used the dvd order on tvdb for the episode listing so it would show up in XBMC that's why they all say S01.

As for the mp2's, all I did was rip the vobs without file splitting and stream copy it into mpg. I did no further encoding and they should be identical to the source. "
