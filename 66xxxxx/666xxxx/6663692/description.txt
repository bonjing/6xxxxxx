During the past two decades, higher processing temperatures, more efficient engines at higher temperatures, and the use of a vacuum environment have led to the development of a number of important processing, fabrication, and industrial techniques, resulting in new material forms including: matrix composites, nano- and functionally graded structures, plastics, smart piezoelectric materials, shape memory alloys, intermetallics, ceramics, and fullerenes. The second edition of this encyclopedia covers the new materials that have been invented or modified in recent years and updates information on basic materials as well.

Encyclopedia of Materials, Parts, and Finishes, Second Edition brings together in one concise volume the most up-to-date information on materials, forms and parts, finishes, and processes utilized in the industry. There is not a handbook currently on the market that incorporates as much materials information in one volume. The coverage of materials usage extends from the breadth of military and aerospace materials to commercial (aircraft, automotive, electronics) and basic materials (wood, rubber, etc.). Each entry provides thorough, straightforward definitions along with examples of corresponding materials, parts, or finishes. Like its predecessor, this encyclopedia will be an invaluable reference that belongs on the desk of every materials scientist and engineer.
