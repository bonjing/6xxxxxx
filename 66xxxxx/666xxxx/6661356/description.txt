Dramatic reconstructions and compelling interviews reveal how the chilling
2006 terrorist bomb plot at Heathrow was foiled.

Liquid Bomb Plot is the incredible true story of the surveillance operation that stopped a fatal disaster and saved thousands of lives. 

It's August 2006. A UK terrorist cell plans to launch suicide bombs that would have resulted in the world's largest and deadliest attack since 9/11.

The plot involved exploding devices disguised as soft drinks and, if it had succeeded, would have blown planes from the sky killing 2,000 people in a single night.
