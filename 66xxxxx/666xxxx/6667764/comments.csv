,rabocop,2011-09-12T18:53Z,Hi again. Do you have any Charles Bukowski other than Women? He's another one who seems to be quite difficult to get hold of.
,rabocop,2011-09-12T19:35Z,I should ammend my last comment to say that it's hard to find Bukowski books which are correctly formatted and comfortably readable.
