Ive just ripped the best tracks from my "The best of the Village
People" CD for you at impressive 320k I had to steal "macho man" from another
torrent as the version on my CD is the remix which is completely inane and makes
no sense to do whatever.

Included are two bonus tracks (as a filler) of the best of Barry White

Michael Rizzo Chessman
