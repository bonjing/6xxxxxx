Many people do not understand the basic concepts of probability, as evidenced by the proliferation of those participating in lotteries, horse racing, and gambling at casinos. But probability and statistics are becoming increasingly important in todayâ€™s society. As the basic ideas are being taught in elementary schools through college, itâ€™s important that everyone has a basic understanding of probability theory. Probability theory explains the happenings that occur due to chance. Although it is not possible to predict for certain the individual outcome of a chance process, it is possible to determine outcomes in the â€œlong run,â€ and to predict the probability that something will eventually occur. This book will present the basics of probability in a non-rigorous manner. Only an understanding of arithmetic and some basic algebra are necessary to learn these ideas. No high-powered mathematical notation or formal proofs will be used, rather the concepts will be developed from examples using coins, dice, cards, and other common probability devices.

DON'T ROLL THE DICE LEARNING PROBABILITY!

Now anyone who ever flipped a coin, played cards, or placed a bet can grasp the principles that govern probability -- without formal training, unlimited time, or an Einstein IQ. In Probability Demystified, experienced math instructor Allan Bluman provides an illuminating and entertaining way to master chance, odds, and predictability.

With Probability Demystified, you learn the subject one simple step at a time -- at your own speed. This unique, self-teaching guide offers problems at the end of each chapter and section to pinpoint weaknesses, and a 60-question "final exam" to reinforce the entire book.

If you have basic math and a little algebra, you can master probability. This fast and entertaining self-teaching course makes it fun and easy to:

    * Learn probability theory with examples using familiar items such as coins, cards, and dice
    * Discover how actuaries predict the likelihood of events
    * Play games of chance with deeper understanding
    * Construct a solid foundation for statistics
    * Be better prepared for standardized tests
    * Take a "final exam" and grade it yourself!

Simple enough for beginners and students but always challenging, Probability Demystified is the most interesting self-teaching tool or brush-up you can find!
