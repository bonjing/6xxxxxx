i justify pirating because i'm too poor to pay 60 dollars for a game i beat in 3 days anyways. i literally have about 20 dollars a month to spend. i'd never get a game. if a company wanted me to love them they'd make a badass free game every now and then since they make a ton off their games. However.....Warhammer I'd actually like to pay for. I love the story of 40k altogether. other games i'll pirate the hell out of. I'll buy a copy of this eventually "

1 Install daemon tools and winrare. 

2 Use winrare to extract all the files from the ISO-file.

3 After exraction delete all the files except for the ISO and the crack file (in the crack file there is sometimes serial umebers and info

4 Mount ISO wth daemon tools and istall the game

5 Copy all the files to the file here the game was installed

6 Right-klick drag the new exe file in the games file on to the desktop.

If you don't have Steam, install that and update it first before installing the game. Mount, install, copy crack, but don't open the game just yet. Open Steam, go to Library, then click Add a Game at the bottom left, then Add a Non-Steam Game. Let the list load, select Space Marine (if it doesn't show up on the list, go to Browse and locate the .exe), then click Add Selected Programs. At this point in the process, Steam will automate an AppID for the game (for those of you getting the AppID error) and you can play.

I ran this on Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit."

,Dragonlance1,2011-09-11T20:42Z,"
I don't extract anything.  My set up to run games: 

Winrar & powerISO

Install winrar and do nothing. 

Install powerISO and create an image drive. If you do this correct you should have more drives located in Computer next to your C drive. These are called virtual drives.

Install:

1. Go to  C: Program Files and create new folder Warhammer  (close that out when done)

2. Go to the file (Warhammer) you downloaded and right click. Look for powerISO  and mount  to drive you created.

3. Go to Computer (C drive area) and look for the virtual drive to where you mounted Warhammer. Right click and  OPEN.

4. Click warhammer exe1 browse to the folder you creaded, C: program files/ warhammer and install. After install is finished go to warhammer exe2 and run that.

5. Copy the crack content from the crack folder located on your virtual drive. Paste crack files in C: program files/ warhammer. 

*Note Copy the files in the crack folder NOT the folder itself!

*Note The shortcut on desktop for warhammer did not work for me, I just went to C: program files/warhammer and created a new shortcut exe. from there and placed on desktop. Works like a charm. Props to uploader!!"

,jvezirian,2011-09-11T22:48Z,"To those having issues with the sound being choppy. This is a really big issue all over the web. Several threads even on the Warhammer Site, in the forums.

So Far I have done these and it has helped a little:

1. Updated Video drivers
2. Updated ""Realtek"" HD Audio drivers
3. Registry fix for Windows 7 packet throtteling issue, just google Warhammer 40000 Space Marines Stuttering issue, it will come up, sorry did not save the damn link, but it did help a little too.
4. Set the priority of the game to High and or Realtime at startup, it helps some.

Now on the hammer site, there is a big fix notice, I have not tried, but several folks swear by it. and that is that C++ 2005 Redist, is what is fucking up the game in Windows 7 machines, in fact it fucks up a lot of games. I have not tride the fix of removing all the C++ 2005 yet, as not sure what affect it will have on all the other shit on my machine. But from what I have read, it works, and improves performance of Win 7 machines.

Just wanted to pass along what I have found out.

Good luck to all.

BTW I have this one installed and runs good, just sound is still choppy."

,Lucky13s,2011-09-22T04:20Z,"I pirated then bought it.

The game is good, rougly Gears of War 3rd person mode, but less cover, more mass slaughter.

Theres a variety of weapons you can acquire, and each weapon has a particular kill move for each type of enemy.

Multiplayer is somewhat like Gears 3 and CoD combined. You get experience which unlocks new weapons, traits, looks, etc. that you can customize. Spawn, fight, die, respawn, repeat. Basically Gears 3 deathmatch, but with flying chainsword wielding melee assault marines everywhere (because 12 year old noobs like to play the flying sword wielding marines).

Theres only 4 playable maps so multiplay gets boring fast, but Co-op mode will be out soon (similar to hoard mode), and new maps."

,britton27,2011-10-05T14:52Z,"I had a little trouble trying to make this game install, at first. Just clicking on the warhammer 40,000 Space Marine.exe did nothing and neither did the autoplay option.

So instead of giving up on it and saying it was junk, I copied the data from the ISO to the desktop and used Alzip (zip/rar extractor) to unpack the exe to a folder on the desktop. Extract the .exe, not the .rar first, the exe is attached to that rar and Alzip will ask you to tell it where the part 2 is.

The whole time I had been looking for a standard installer to pop up, or at least some kind of notification that the game was installing. There was none, so I extracted both of the big data files into a folder and copied over the contents of the crack folder to that new directory, and that was the answer. No need to install steam or whatever. Just place the folder (I renamed it to Space Marines) in to the program files (x86) directory and create a shortcut. Then move that shortcut to the start menu, under whatever you want (I just put in in the games link, folder) and then pin it to the start menu. 

I've only ran it once, and it shows the main screen. I think it's going to work though, no crazy error message, or Anti-Virus warning popups. I think the uploader could have done a better job documenting the install procedure for this release. Or perhaps chosen a different means to compress the data. Otherwise a top notch upload.

,bombzero,2011-10-16T23:21Z,i seem to be having a wierd issue with my install. i mounted the disc in daemon tools. the autorun window popped up and i clicked install. it then takes forever to get to next step. when the install window pops up the default drive is set to my emulated disc drive. this isnt right so can somebody help me out on how to actually install it?
,karlosss999,2011-10-17T05:50Z,"@bombzero

you must manually enter the target folder. I put it on D:\space marine

replace D with w/e drive you use for games and stuff"
,Delabeled,2011-10-17T18:10Z,Its always refreshing when you check comments section to see what has been said about an upload and you see this childish name calling and bickering going on. Very mature. Talking about beating each other up and doing dead grannies. I am constantly amazed at the level of immaturity and general stupidity people can posses. That being said I am 23 years old and honestly couldn't care less what someone over the internet says about me or to me. Which is why i do not understand how people can take offense so easy.
,scorp123,2011-10-17T22:22Z,"Hmmm... doesn't work for me. When I try to start the game I get a pop-up window with an error (from Steam??): ""Error: App ID not registered."" ... I already tried the crack from another torrent. Same result. And Google results are all talking about original games ;)  ... So this doesn't help me. Any ideas please? :)"
,Gr1mwar,2011-10-17T22:23Z,More Seeds please!
,scorp123,2011-10-17T23:43Z,Please disregard my previous comment :)  Everything works tip top now :)  You _really_ really have to delete the shortcut the installer creates and instead create your own shortcut to the game. Done. Game works tip top :)

,tiz2,2011-11-08T15:30Z,"The only issue there is with this game is that the shortcut made by the installer doesn't work (at least it didn't for me), but the game still works fine. Just open the game from the .exe and voila. There is absolutely no need to install Steam or anything else unless youÂ´re trying to use the game with Tunngle. On a personal note: This game is really fun in Multiplayer. All the melee fighting in it makes it stand out from other shooters, the Exterminatus dlc is great fun (this is multiplayer only, so again this is only for you if you use Tunngle) and there is an upcomming expansion. So maybe you should do as I did and buy it :P"

The ground, stairs and walking platforms, as well as terrain mesh all disappear. Rendering the game unplayable. NO ONE else having this problem?

Regardless, this game is full of awesome eyecandy, but playability and character control are Kindergarten level. If you love FF, Tekken, and crap games like that your gonna love this one. I for one, hate the gameplay. Uninstalling, and kissing it goodbye.

Nice try though. Relic, GW, and THQ, you wasted your time on graphics, when the interface is crap."

Your problem is that the game is not selected, alt tab then left click the game in the menu bar

@Quarius  

Go to the control panel located in the right side of the start menu, then select programs and feautres this will then pop up a new window that gives you a list of programs, right click the game select uninstall

If you can not see the program and features select classic view or view small icons option in the control panel depending on if you have windows 7 or not"
