I am very particular about my music files, everything has to be perfect and I usually plan on spending some time to clean up most files I download from here.  Its ok and I am not complaining,  it comes with getting them for free.  But you had everything labeled correctly, all artwork was there, all ID3 titles correct, song numbers, everything!!  Not to mention all the extra demos, and live albums!  Great collection.......Keep it up, I will look for more of your torrents!  Thanks man!!"
