,Phatfish,2011-09-09T21:14Z,Yeah I heard Bruce Willis got blackmailed in to doing this movie. Either he did it or they would tell his wife about the hookers. Apparently he didn't know that she found out YEARS ago...

 Not sure as of what media player you are using but if your using windows media player. thats probably your problem. windows media player isnt worth a shit. get VLC media player. its the best. ask antone. and it free. other than that i havent seen it myself yet but,ask for the sound being out of snyc? in VLC go to tools. open adjustments and effects. then to synchronization and on audio/video. click down twice to get -0.200 s. and you should be good. have a nice download. ask for Bruce willas.. fuck man. wish youd stop wasting time with shitty movies. and make a fuckin sequel to the fifth element.. best movie ever..."
,Nash6989,2011-09-10T10:29Z,this says its not even out till november! i love torrents... just sucks how we can get things before they come out. but we still cant get any copy of 30 minutes or less or our idiot brother...

Not for this movie it isn't, dipshit. It says ""Budget
$22,000,000 (estimated)"" just as Billylopez said."
,PokerPimp,2011-09-10T11:44Z,"Im sorry.. I dont have a skull but it is off... vlc player I had to +3.2 seconds to match the words to it so mine was off a lot in my opinion. The video is fine. As far as the movie is concerned it had a great plot but the dialog was written by a neanderthal... Ive hustled over 20 years and know all the slang in the world, never heard people talk so slow and labored..Bruce Willis had great dialog obviously, Ryan Phillipe was ok.. everyone else in the movie including Couture and 50 were awful. I wont give away spoilers but Couture playing with the guns was stupid, the Butchers part was stupid...but then again I thought the Expendables and Crank 2 were awful...just not my genre..
Volume was not messed up on mine.. but is out of sync..and I DO HAVE the klite codec pack from http://codecguide.com/"
,ronbabby,2011-09-10T12:24Z,ty BONE always can count on your DL thank you
,doomsday2012lol,2011-09-10T14:49Z,You can't get Bruce Willis / Ryan Phillipe to even look at the script if the budget is 4 mil..Bruce Willis has Die Hard 5 lined up for 2012 so its not like his career is dead.
,QasimAwan,2011-09-10T15:35Z,"Thnx 4 uploading, but voice was too low.

For everyone else who r getting it low.

1. Download latest k-lite codec pack.
2. Run the movie
3. Go to AC3 configuration ""Mixer"", uncheck ""Auto gain control"" and ""Auto Matrix"". Now change the ""Column C"" value to 5 in the ""Mixing Matrix"".
4. Press OK

And I think it IS a B Grade Movie."

@MyKrossini:
I had the same problem with my XBOX, I did the downloadable update and also a hard disk copy and neither one actually let me play .avi files, although it supposedly installed correctly.  I tried a few months later to dl and re-install the updates and it ended up working fine, so that my just be a problem they have."

I got that download too.  Unfortunately I never got the .avi to work again without setting up the windows media extender.  It's crap without the $60 dvd remote.  Though still easier then teaching the family how to watch movies on the big screen via the computer."
