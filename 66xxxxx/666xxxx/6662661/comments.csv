Does it contains the ""Carrion Crown Map Folio""? I'm searching for this and can't find it anywhere."
,elmalvado,2011-09-09T19:17Z,"Nope, it does not contain that pdf. You can copy the images from Carrion Crown APs and paste them in Paint."

,elmalvado,2011-10-19T23:05Z,Unfortunately this release is no longer up to date. 2nd part of Jade Regent & Feast of Ravenmoor are missing. I'll wait for the October releases coming out on 26th & create new torrent.
