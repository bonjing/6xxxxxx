,Dyspaire,2011-09-11T01:33Z,Guys how do you get the serial to work?? Please help!
,mrjollol,2011-09-11T03:19Z,"The Game works with no proplem, installation was fast.
But on the otherhand the game is terrible...
there is no tutorial to teach you how to play and after having failed the first mission 7 times i finally got past the first skirmish only to be slaugthered by 9 enemy soldiers vs my 4, and the ai of your own men seems to be comparable to a mad dog in terms of intelligence, They pop out of cover always right after the enemy has started shooting again, though that doesn't really matter as the game appears to thank that cover is just a  hologram floating in the air grenades and bullets just fly trough it with ease.
I honestly don't know how they managed to throw a piece of a half finished game on the market...
please don't buy this game i don't even recommend downloading it for free"
,rreed168,2011-09-11T03:42Z,"this game sucks bawls, really boring, but hey to each his own so maybe ya'll will like it"
,Demoras,2011-09-11T05:08Z,"@mrjollol

This game is a standalone expansion of men of war, you want a tut, then go play the first game, and durr, its Vietnam, the walls are made of bamboo, they aint suppose to stop bullets, you want protection you go hide in a bunker."
,cher080,2011-09-11T05:23Z,"Install Great!  

Only that the game is pretty hard.  Couldn't pass the first mission hahaha (maybe I suck at this kind of game lol)"

To unlock the American campaign go to your user name, documents\my games\men of war\profiles\player or default\game_progress.set and rename the extention to .txt, open it with notepad and change the level to 3, save it, rename the extention back to .set and play the Amercan campaign.

,kurtz667,2011-09-16T04:11Z,"what are you guys saying?? this game rocks!
if u dont know how to play it. play the pacific assault version first. and if u cant get past the first mission. dont bother killing the pilots. get in the (left) tower, man the machine gun and mow down the choppers. it might not be the easiest game, but what u guys want? another game you can finish in 3 hours!? o yea and you dont need a serial! Anyway thnx extremezone!!!"

someone help?"
,streetbum149,2011-09-20T08:45Z,"i agree with what kurtz667 said, its no more difficult then the last men of war games. by now you should know how to play. don't like the difficulty? well then i suppose you should play some newbcraft 2. keep on spamming boys! lol. on a further note, im glad i decided not to buy it. not because of the difficulty but because they didn't implement multy-play very well from what a few reviews said. no competitive just co-op."
,markb24,2011-09-28T03:06Z,Ok i installed the game and copied cracks into the game folder but it still wants a serial # to activate.Windows 7 ultimate here.Could someone help me please ??
,SamuelTheDamned,2011-09-28T14:44Z,"@markb24

Try copying the crack files TO THE RIGHT FOLDER.
..like

C:\Program files (x86)\crap\more\crap

If all else fails, reinitialize the setup and click next
upuntil the setup asks for the setupfolder !

Now press Alt+Printscreen (on top of insert) and open paint...

Press Ctrl+V to paste the picture to paint and save under title: I need to see an optician !"
,markb24,2011-09-28T20:57Z,"ok I can't get this game to work it demands a cd key.there is only 1 file in the crack folder and it does nothing no matter where i put it.i mounted the iso file with nero.is there a better program to mount with.really would like to play this game.any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thank You 
Mark"

,ciaobellaxo,2012-06-05T14:28Z,"This game is woeful.  The graphics is 90ish.  swampy if you really want to play it you don't need a serial mate.  I had a bit of trouble but here you..
* go to the crack folder and select both items
* go to the Men of War Vietnam folder (it's actually got the helmet icon which threw me)
* paste the two items here
* double click on the vietnam icon
Should work then!"
