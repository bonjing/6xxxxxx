,exarro,2012-03-18T02:38Z,"Audio: AAC 24000Hz stereo 31kbps

well, no wonder yify releases are so small..."
,Granchy,2012-04-05T08:31Z,"I appreciate the upload, but I've never seen so many people with no clue what good video and audio are.

The audio makes this unwatchable.  The video is passable but not very good.  "
,xdaeda1us,2012-04-07T18:41Z,"No YIFY release is a 10... You people need to watch actual Blu Rays. Blu Rays are reference quality so they are 10. You can't take a 700mb rip of a 16+gb file and retain anywhere near the level of quality. YIFY is just passable on smaller monitors. Looks and sounds like garbage on any big screen. The file size is nice, though."
