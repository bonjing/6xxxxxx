Nice was the third album by The Nice; it was titled Everything As Nice As Mother Makes It (Immediate IMOCS 102) in the U.S. after Immediate's distribution changed from Columbia to Capitol. Nice had been initially released in the U.S. with a slightly longer version of Rondo 69 not available on the UK or on the Capitol distributed U.S. versions. The first U.S. version of Nice was briefly reissued in 1973 by Columbia Special Products. Continuing The Nice's fusion of jazz, blues, and rock, this album consists of studio (1 - 4) and live (5 - 6) tracks, the latter having become firm favourites in the band's live performances. The album achieved number 3 in the UK Album charts
