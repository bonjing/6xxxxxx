Axure RP gives you the wireframing, prototyping and specification tools needed to make informed design choices, persuade any skeptics, get your design built to spec... and maybe win a few fans along the way.


Sketch & Design:
=================
Tools for quick and dirty or polished designs:
-----------------------------------------------
Quickly create beautiful wireframes with boxes, placeholders, shapes, and text. When you're ready for more visual polish, add color, gradients, and semi-transparent fills, import images, use grids and guides for precise placement, or the many other tools designed to help you work at the right fidelity for your project.

Switch to a sketch, hand drawn feel instantly:
-----------------------------------------------
Now you can change the sketchiness, switch to grayscale, and choose a handwriting font for your design instantly and at any stage of your project. Clients may love it just for the look, but you'll love it when the sketchiness helps to set the right expectations and get feedback focused on the functionality, content, or interactions.

Start in minutes and get faster every day:
-------------------------------------------
You'll be productive on day one with Axure RP's familiar diagramming environment, inline text editing and 50+ keyboard shortcuts. And as you get to know features like selection modes, widget styles, and the dynamic panel manager, you'll get faster by the day.

Change once, update everywhere with masters:
---------------------------------------------
Use masters, to create your own reusable design elements like headers, footers and templates. A change to a master is reflected everywhere the master is used. Use as many masters on a page as you need, and nest masters in other masters to maximize reusability.

Widget libraries to jump start your projects:
----------------------------------------------
Download widget libraries that we've published or that customers have shared to add to the built in Axure RP widgets. Or create your own custom widget libraries with icons, design patterns or branded elements for your applications.


Interact:
==========
Much more than just clicks:
----------------------------
Create simple click-throughs or highly functional, rich prototypes with conditional logic, dynamic content, animations, drag and drop, and calculations. You don't always need it, but when you do, it's nice to have the power to take your designs to the next level for your own evaluation, client feedback, or user testing.

Easy to build without coding:
------------------------------
Select an event like a OnClick, OnMouseEnter, or OnKeyUp. Add a case and choose an action like Open Link, Set Widget Value, or Show Panel. Configure the options for the action and that's it. No coding. Once you get the hang of it, you'll be amazed how much you can do and how fast.

Click to generate HTML. No player required:
--------------------------------------------
Click a button and Axure RP generates your design to an HTML and javascript prototype that can be viewed in IE, Firefox, Safari, or Chrome. Stakeholders, developers, and testers can view and interact with your prototype without installing Axure RP or a player. Publish your prototype    to a network drive, web server, or share.axure.com to share it.

Your prototype. Your brand:
----------------------------
It's your prototype and it should represent your brand. Your clients don't need to see an Axure logo when you're presenting your work.  Add an image and caption to your prototypes. And if you've got some CSS chops, customize the prototype even more.


Document:
==========
Widget Annotations and Page Notes:
-----------------------------------
Add notes to widgets and pages to provide more context to the prototypes and clarify or detail functionality. The annotations are organized into customizable fields to help manage the information and standardize the documentation. Page notes can also be divided into categories for different audiences.

Powerful, customizable Word generator:
---------------------------------------
Create Word templates with custom headers, footers, title page, and heading styles. Select from single or two column layouts. Configure the order of the screenshots, annotations, and page notes. Then, click a button to generate your custom specification any time and as many times as you update the design.

Export all copy:
-----------------
In addition to the annotations and page notes, you can export the widget text to the Word document as well as the options in list boxes and droplists. Choose to generate the text on only annotated widgets or for every widget in your design.

Filter by annotations to group specifications:
-----------------------------------------------
Generate specifications for a specific subset of the annotations by creating a filter on annotation values. If you're keeping track of versions or change requests in the annotations, you can generate documents by version or change.


Collaborate:
=============
Shared projects for design teams:
----------------------------------
Use shared projects to work simultaneously with other team members on a project. Keep a history of changes and export previous versions of the project when you need to. Use a shared network drive for easy setup. Or store projects on an SVN server for remote access. And the best part, there's no additional cost for Axure RP.

AxShare. Share prototypes and manage feedback:
-----------------------------------------------
Upload your files to AxShare at share.axure.com and your prototypes will be generated and ready to share in minutes. Password protect the link to your prototype for security. Enable discussions to collect feedback directly in your prototypes. Discussions can also be added to prototypes not hosted on AxShare. Currently in beta.
