Thanks for all the Queen remasters.
Being a Queen fan since 1976 I own all their stuff across different formats (original vinyl, 1st CD releases, Hollywood re-releases, the lot) but I just couldn't get myself over spending money at ""another copy of something I already own"".
So, again, thanks a lot"
