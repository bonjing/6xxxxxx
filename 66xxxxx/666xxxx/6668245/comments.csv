does your 3DTV have an option to reverse eyes?  My Samsung has it under 3D options its called ""picture correction""

,cleverjack,2011-10-12T19:13Z,"the images on this are reversed; you can cross your eyes and see the 3D, which means right eye is on the left side, and left eye is on the right side. This won't work with any 3D TV. "

,realstar7,2011-11-12T06:59Z,"Worked great on my series 8 led samsung 3dtv. Just download and put on a portable HDD and plug into one of the usb ports on the back. Adjust 3d a little on settings and change side by side from L-R to R-L. 
Loved the movie and when I'm shopping next ill pick up the legitimate version.

Thanks!!!"

,yogeeta.p,2011-12-04T16:23Z,"@realstar7 

dude need your help , how did you transfer the video through your 3D tv by HDD

my transcend HDD (which is NTFS) is being not recognized by my sony ex720. and if i convert my HDD into FAT32 then i cant transfer my movie into HDD as it is over 4gb. 

Please help."
,Piers1989,2011-12-10T23:58Z,"As someone else asked, is this is full HD3D does that mean its a full SBS? if that was so wouldn't the resolution be 3840x1080?

If thats not the case is there any way of getting the sequential rips in mkv?"
,TheGriffinman,2011-12-26T04:02Z,"This is full 1080p, filled the screen on my 55"" Samsung 3D LED.  And excellent 5.1 channel sound.  I prefer 7.1 channel sound with my Onkyo receiver, but I'm not complaining.

Audio = 8/10
Video = 10/10
Movie = excellent (you be the judge)

This download is definitely the best 3D movie I've seen on my series 8 Samsung so far (comparing to store bought 3d blu-rays).  I didn't want to see this movie in theater because this is the reason I paid so much for a 3D TV and 3D receiver.  This movie was only released in 3D in a ridiculously priced limited edition package.  Hollywood was pissing me off by the amount of money they were making off of this movie and wanted to charge me for it over a year after its debut.  Fuck Hollywood.  L3G3ND gave a serious ""talk to the hand"" high five to the face of Hollywood with this release!  This is picture perfect!  This is a gem!

@realstar7: this 100% positive feedback could not be possible without you.  I was ready to come in here and tongue lash this torrent before I read your comment and realized I needed to tweak my 3D settings to make it play right.  Rather than changing ""L-R"" to ""R-L"", I have a setting in my Picture/3D options for ""Picture Correction"" that took out the blur that is probably what everyone else is complaining about.  I gave up on this movie 3 minutes into it, and, fortunately came back here to cry about it when I did the smart thing and read the comments.

This is my best ever download from ThePirateBay!  This uploader should be given his jolly roger!"
,and1996,2011-12-26T20:23Z,can I watch this with glasses?
,spanihati,2011-12-27T02:24Z,"Thanks.
U can use Xilisoft 3D converter to convert it to anaglyph and see through normal red-cyne anaglyph glass. (Use +4 depth)"

There is only one problem, when you change the audio from german to english, which works perfect :).... The subtitles for the language the avatars speak show in german and there are no options for english!

You are the master my friend ;-) I have a smart tv and it only took some minor adjusting within my tv to reverse the lenses. My deepest thank you on this. 
My Ol'man and I have been waiting for almost a year for this to come back onto the open market as another HD 3D manufacturer bought the rights to it for a year. So you can only imagine my huge smile right now.

A, 10

I'm watching now and it looks and sounds AMAZING!!

Massive shame about the german subtitles for the Navi parts. 

I can confirm that my LG 55"" passive 3D TV plays this. 
I had to swap the left/right as mentioned in these comments, and select the 2nd audio channel to get it to play in English

Hopefully I can set up the subtitles in english and then this will be absolutely perfect.

Thanks to L3G3ND "

But when I try it on my toshiba 55tl151u It does its job but the right side of the screen is darker when I look at the screen and then the left side is a brighter. When I close my right eye I see the screen fully, when I close my left eye the right side of the screen is black but the other is clear. I have a passive 3d of course. Its hard to explain but when I look at it with both eyes its like the right side is darkened and alittle of the farest left is darkened, and the middle of the screen is brighter. Any clues, when I click to convert into 3d, It gives me 2 options, top and bottom or side by side. top and bottom give me 2 screens which look just like the screens when not in 3d. Side by side give me the issue."

Your monitor has to have the ability to set it to side-by-side 3d. I too am running nvidia 3d vision, but you actually don't need it to play these movies, you simply play it in normal 1080 mode in VLC or another player and turn the monitor setting to side-by-side. I achieved this by using the Sony PS3 3d display."

There's no secret futuristic codec they use, it's just that a whole bunch of picture quality and audio is lost while maintaining resolution - which is okay for your iphone but on the laptop or tv, its' stupid, and the evidence is overwhelming. If not, I think you need to go get your eyes checked out ASAP. "
