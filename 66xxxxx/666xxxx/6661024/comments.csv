,Papaoso42,2011-09-08T20:11Z,Thank you for posting this! A lot of us have to work and don't get to see things like this.
,Superbong,2011-09-08T20:51Z,Thank you very much!  Ron Paul 2012
,TaiTheGuy,2011-09-09T02:19Z,"Just randomly decided to search ""GOP"". Just my luck, this was uploaded yesterday!
Please keep up the good work & post more of these as they come. It's one of my only sources for these debates, unless I watch them live streaming online."
,Dicratoz,2011-09-09T16:35Z,"Thanks! I'm not even an American, but I want to watch this because of Ron Paul :)"
,Actionsho,2011-09-09T19:42Z,"np, I meant to write in the description that these were ripped from Ron Paul's YouTube channel. I can't stand to watch things on YouTube, I want to watch them on my TV so ripping and converting to AVI so I could watch on a DivX player was my only option `-`"
,TaiTheGuy,2011-09-12T13:53Z,"I'll do you a favor & save you like 50+ DVD's a year (if you watch 'em as much as I do)
Get yourself one of these:
http://www.amazon.com/TV-out-VGA-S-Video-Cable-Adapter/dp/B000P3UB24
Or even just a regular S-video cable if you have a laptop.
And plug it in your TV like its a DVD player. Bam, Done!"
,Actionsho,2011-09-23T19:03Z,I have a DivX player with USB Support. I don't ever bother burning to a DVD. :)
,blaackboxen,2011-10-13T04:32Z,"Thanks...

please also provide ALL the GOP ""debates"" in one ZIPPED pack (zipping prevents selective seeding)"
,icanhazbits,2011-11-15T03:04Z,"posting to usenet would be VERY AWESOME

This would make debates ddos-free and available for at least 1000 days!
