Release notes:
This is the second pilot of the "A Haunting" series, of which OSiTV ripped the series and
aSpYrE ripped the first pilot called "A Haunting in Connecticut". As with "Connecticut"
there's also a feature film coming out about "Georgia": http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1457765/

ps. No IVTC because source was hybrid. Vobsample included.

enjoy!
