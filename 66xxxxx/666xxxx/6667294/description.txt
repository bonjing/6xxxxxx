The Raspberry Pi is a $25 Linux/ARM computer scheduled to be launched in November 2011. The purpose of Raspberry Pi (the name of both the computer, and the non-profit foundation that designs and sells it) is to help kids get access to computers and learn programming, in schools and the 3rd world, but the Pi (ARM11, 128/256 MB RAM, HDMI, USB...) is powerful enough for a variety of other uses (emulation, NAS, HTPC, Office work...).

Description of this torrent by the VM's creator:
"VirtualBox Virtual Machine in which I have installed and configured Debian-i386, scratchbox2, qemu and the codesourcery toolchain so that it is possible to build software for the RaspberryPi (although no one actually has one, only a handful of alpha boards are in circulation right now).
This virtual machine should also be usable for other ARM based devices, especially if you have a rootfs and can seed the scratchbox2 environment (see http://russelldavis.org/2010/10/20/setting-up-scratchbox2-to-build-software-for-zubuntu/ & http://russelldavis.org/2010/11/03/mounting-a-raw-disk-image/ & http://russelldavis.org/2011/09/07/setting-up-scratchbox2-from-scratch-for-the-raspberry-pi/ )."
