and its disco music - in joint stereo

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6555023/Earth__Wind_and_Fire_-_Very_Best_Of[mp3]

so look elsewhere if you dont think our folks are satisfied with our nice stuff eh "
,musicfromrizzo,2011-09-09T22:41Z,"here is another disco torrent (Village people) with 52 seeds posted earlier in the year

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6323071/The_Village_People_-_The_Best_Of_(1994)_MP3_320

it is joint stereo too - So I suggest you mind your own business tifon make suggestions that are constructive but dont be a spoiler just because you dont have a better way to win on these torrent types here - also I think you shouldnt have pink avatar showing as is poor tactics I say"
