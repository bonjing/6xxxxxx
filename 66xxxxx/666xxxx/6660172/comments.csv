Whoa, a compound bow! Ollie's getting updated!

Thanks for the upload!"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-08T20:34Z,"So, let me get this straight:
DC guy #1 - We need Green Arrow to appeal to a younger hipper audience
DC guy #2 - Like they did with Smallville?
DC guy #1 - EXACTLY like that

So Ollie is a bit older and they ditched Chloe for a whole team but this is just Smallville's version of GH ...

guess its good I really liked GH on Smallville..."
