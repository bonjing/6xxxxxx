Iam downloading for quite some time from you.

Needless to say, your releases are spot on and without playback loops or bad navigation issue's due to bad authoring etc .. 

And i like to thank you for all the retailcorrect releases you have bhrought here on the bay.

That's the least i can do once in awhile.


+1 from me friend"

Enjoy

&

Gladly posted"
