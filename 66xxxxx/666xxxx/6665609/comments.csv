,shani9211,2011-09-11T18:28Z,Hey What s about the QUALITY ?
,Qajs1,2011-09-14T03:10Z,"Tip to look for when downloading something to increase download speed: search for the torrent with the best Seeder/Peer ratio. (Seeder/Leecher). A peer is someone downloading the file at the same time you are. A seeder is someone who has the file and is uploading it to other peoples computers. Usually when there's less peers and more seeders, you get more availability for better connections."
