Set against the Dramatic Island backdrop of Hawaii and based on a true story, Princess Kaiulani is a historic romance about an unlikely heroine, exiled from Hawaii across the seas to Victorian England at just 13 years of age, and her unwavering fight to defend the independence of her people, which took her first to Washington USA and then back to her beloved Islands.
  
This is a heart-warming and very moving film which does not (like so many) attempt alter history to suit the screen play.  If proof indeed was ever needed, it is only just recently that the USA issued a full apology to the natives of Hawaii for the annexation of their lands.

It takes a great country to admit to past mistakes.
