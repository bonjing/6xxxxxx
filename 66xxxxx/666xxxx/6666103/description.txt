Game Description:

Robot Alchemic Driver, or commonly known as RAD, is a Big Robot / Monster fight in a modern city with a twist. There is a story mode / training mode and a 2 player vs mode. In a nut shell, alienâ€™s attack the last city on earth. The big robot comes up, and here is where the twist come in, you have to control the robot from the perspective of the â€œheroâ€ (three to choose from) and you can switch between the robot / hero mode. This forces you to make sure you have a strategic position to move the hero around in the city to see the battle without getting too close. As the game goes on you have the option to update/customize the mech(s) to improve them. You can end up destroying whole building / terrain as you battle the alien monster. 

Prepare to bond with 75 tons of high-tensile robot. Direct every movement of your machine and slug your way to victory over colossal opponents in brutal hand-to-hand combat (plus missiles, lasers, shooting fists, boomerangs, and much more). Freeway overpass in the way? Take it down. Buildings crowding you? Knock 'em over. 

Much more than a simple action game, Robot Alchemic Drive accurately simulates the operation of a remote-controlled metal titan in crowded, active urban environments. Use your giant robot as a tool to defeat enemies, complete missions, and much more. Treat your robot well and you will be rewarded. Abuse your robot and, well, you'll wish you hadn't.
