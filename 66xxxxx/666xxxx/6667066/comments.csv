[V],_F1_,2011-09-11T08:56Z,"TPB tracks the seed-leech count from openbittorrent tracker (automatically includes in torrent file when you upload) which often goes down. The seedcount on the client (like uTorrent) is nearly correct as it shows the highest count from all the trackers included. This torrent is well seeded already.

Keep up good work whitecat :)"

,whitecat2010,2012-02-25T03:10Z,"You might be interested in my Crochet afghans (throws) mega collection
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7022179/Crochet_afghan_(throw)_mega_collection
Hundreds of books and leaflets, all cleaned up, renamed, categorized etc...
I'm still in initial seeding, 'cause I had a problem with my connection last week (it was fixed yesterday), but there are 64 people who already have 53% and going strong, so you shall start getting files altready. by the time you get to 53% the initial leechers will have completed it and the speed will hopefully be even more."

thankyou

Chris"

It is not among my crochet patterns. It's a knitting pattern, I have uploaded a torrent with Knitting patterns - babies and children here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6667034

The full title in my torrent is KNIT - Pingouin 122 6 layettes [0-18m].pdf"
