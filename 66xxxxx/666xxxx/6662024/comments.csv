,oshat29,2011-09-25T08:10Z,what software is required to watch these files? VLC won't play them
[T],480v,2011-10-02T14:24Z,Thank you for including the subs. This is important to me. This will allow me to remove Suits (HD) from the DVR and get some needed capacity back.
[T],480v,2011-10-04T05:10Z,"Follow up: Watched and compared these files against the 1080i recordings I had on my HDDVR. Video quality is good. Its looks slightly more crisp and detailed. The black is a little deeper too. Audio sounds practically identical to broadcast, but better than the Xvid versions. Subtitles are in perfect sync. Also identical word for word to original broadcast. The Korean sub is awesome. I can definitely use those. The only negative is Episode 12 (last episode) doesn't have subs. Out of the many versions I've downloaded.. this is the best."

,tjekk,2011-10-22T10:26Z,What software do i use 4 this?
,goldenwombat,2011-10-23T18:08Z,"tjekk
The only software you should ever use to watch PB downloaded shows is VLC. 
VLC is Mac and Win compatible, it handles just about every Codec and it's fully adjustable when the sound or subs are out of synch.
It takes time to learn all the ins and outs of VLC, but once you start, it's like crack - you can't stop.

Also thanx much to Konashine for this impressive upload, your work is excellent!
Kamsamnida!"

,bestevawuz,2012-01-01T20:56Z,"Guys I have 2 Questions
1. What program will play .mkv files?
2. If a torrent has texted language options does that mean that it will have like subtitles below the movie?(For example, like this movie)"
,bestevawuz,2012-01-01T21:00Z,Does this torrent have subtitles in it because it says that theres texted language. And I REALLY don't want texted language below my tv shows.

,1popcorn,2012-03-20T12:02Z,"Hey guys, 
I made an account just to ask and would appreciate your help. I was really looking forward to this tv series but vlc cannot play it. I have tried media player classic - home cinema and also the ffdshow decoder as was suggested in other forums but nothing works. Only the first few seconds of the file plays and then the screen goes black (14 secs to be exact for ep1). Please help?"
