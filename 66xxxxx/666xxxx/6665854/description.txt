Description:

Since the beginning of time, the forces of Order and Chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. In Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, you'll become part of this struggle as you follow Baal, the last of the Prime Evils, into the Barbarian Highlands of the north. You'll face a series of challenging new quests to prevent the vile minions of the underworld from destroying the world of Sanctuary. This expansion to Diablo II features more weapons, armor, magical items, and character classes--everything you need to fight the new monsters that await you.
