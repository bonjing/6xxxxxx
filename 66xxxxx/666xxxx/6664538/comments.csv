,viral_intent,2011-09-11T03:26Z,"You need to understand the fact that the standard stipulates the earliest releases be released as rar libraries. Plus it doesn't detract from the file in any way. It's out earlier, so the filetype doesn't matter."
,braveedge,2011-09-11T05:04Z,"I have a Boxee Box that I view these on.  It can decode an ISO of a DVD that is inside a RAR file.  First time I did that, it blew me away.  This one shouldn't be a problem"

,Screamokid,2011-09-15T23:31Z,"Kinda bullshit how America gets it 6 days before the UK and then it's not even aired in the UK on it's release date! BBC are bullshit! Should be released here first considering it is ""British"" and America at the same time :/"

The standards need to be changed to something more current.  There is no benefit at all to RARs and unless you have a boxee :) most of us have to extract the files to be able to watch them so that means if we want to continue seeding we are using twice as much hard drive space.  
RARing is an antiquated practice which needs to go away.  For gods sakes it comes from the time of floppy discs!  lol "
