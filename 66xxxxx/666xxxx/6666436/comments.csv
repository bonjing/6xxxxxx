See my other torrents http://thepiratebay.org/user/k3nd00d/"
,qaider,2011-09-11T16:28Z,"It's a very fast torrent, and it's exactly what it says, but it isn't HD. How unfortunate."
,k3nd00d,2011-09-12T06:17Z,"If you want HD go find a 1GB+ size 720p or 1080p file. For under 100mb you are not going to get an HD video file. The SOURCE for this is HDTV, and it is then encoded down for small file size and fast download. Ideal for cellphones, tablets, PCs, etc. Looks pretty good double sized, but won't look good fullscreen on a huge monitor or widescreen TV."
,SonicIt,2011-09-12T07:44Z,Thanks! It's a great episode.
,Leonidas123,2011-09-12T15:52Z,"ill wait for the 350 MB. This is lower than SD, forget HD."
,k3nd00d,2011-09-12T22:23Z,"Moron. I am sick of doing work some people want and having twats bitching about it. If this is not the encode you want, fine...but stop your bitching you drive-by leeching morons! The 160-200mb and 350mb and 500-550mb and 1.2gb versions are out there. Go get them you whining jerks and stop feeling you must bash my portable encodes just because you're ignorant and somehow that makes it ok.

I'll tell you this...I believe my encodes will play on more devices than any of the others, from ipod to psp/ps to xbox to cellphones to win pc to mac pc to linux pc to tablets, etc.

Now, piss off!"
,ArtieT,2011-09-17T23:45Z,"Well said, man! It seems to happen to all the encoders, sadly, but it's much worse for the more compressed versions. My theory is that it is people whose internet allowances are compromising how much they can d/l, but they've forgotten to let their expectations know!! 

The resolution is in the title: 272p! Full HD is 1080p, do the math!

Anyway, keep up the good work, man!

Cheers"
