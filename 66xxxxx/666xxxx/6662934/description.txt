I like the approach of this text. The authors lay down a theoretical background for the topic followed by practical examples. This is exactly what an engineering textbook should accomplish.

The coverage of topics and the exposition of fundamentals are clear and precise, and they are balanced with excellent choices of high quality and appropriate examples in all chapters.
Product Description
Nationally regarded authors Andrew Pytel and Jaan Kiusalaas bring a depth of experience that can't be surpassed in this third edition of Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics. They have refined their solid coverage of the material without overloading it with extraneous detail and have revised the now 2-color text to be even more concise and appropriate to today's engineering student. The text discusses the application of the fundamentals of Newtonian dynamics and applies them to real-world engineering problems. An accompanying Study Guide is also available for this text.
