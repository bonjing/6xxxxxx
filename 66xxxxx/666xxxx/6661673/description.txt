TTC - Operas of Mozart
By Robert Greenberg


Format: MP3


In this course with Professor Robert Greenberg, we are summoned to understand more fully the height of Mozart's operatic achievement by analyzing two masterpieces closely. The course also invites us to fathom the enigma of Mozart's meteoric genius by studying his career and development.

Professor Greenberg is not an idolator-he reminds us that Mozart was a man, a human, working to make a name and a living. Professor Greenberg shows that Mozart was an ''irreverent revolutionary'' who did not worship the past. Accordingly, says Professor Greenberg, ''This course is somewhat different from what you might expect. It brings Mozart's art refreshingly down to earth. It does not trivialize opera, nor does it put it on a pedestal.''

The structure of the course is somewhat unusual. The 24 lectures are in three parts of eight lectures each. The first and third parts concentrate your attention on two works of surpassing beauty and accomplishment, CosÃ¬ fan tutte and The Magic Flute.

The middle eight lectures of the course study Mozart's early life and development from the first opera he wrote (when he was 11 years old) to Don Giovanni, completed when he was 31.
