,deviantdigi,2011-09-11T01:53Z,"My game keeps crashing using this. Didn't happen at first, bout 2 hours in or so.

I'll be playin, then all a sudden I get a dirt background screen. That says ""saving chunks"" but the writing is all jacked up. I have to restart to play. Understandable, being an early release  but THIS HAPPENS EVERY 10 OR SO MINS.

Thanks for the up, may want to wait for a better release than what is available now."
,sonic222333,2011-09-11T10:55Z,"THIS WORKING!!!

You'll need to download the version 1.7 if you don't have minecraft

Remplace minecraft.jar from appdata/roaming/.minecraft/bin (location for windows 7) and enjoy!!"
,GLMC,2011-09-12T01:02Z,"thats what i said derp!!!!

download my 1.7.3 version and then replace the minecraft.jar file in the bin folder"
