the Dead End Kids in Crime School - 1938

I added a 2nd short vid, a prelog to the movie with Vincent Sherman, who worked on the film.

Featuring the six original Dead End Kids with Bogie & Gale Page. The villinous Cy Kendall is in charge of the reformatory the boys get sent to.

Definitely one of their better movies.
