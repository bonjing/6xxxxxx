,paulderby,2011-09-11T09:33Z,"The BBC did an interview with the idiot that made this film, and when challenged about the bullshit in the film, he couldn't answer, what a twat."

,Blubs,2011-09-11T11:03Z,"but they show when u post again, and only when you submit a post..... rolmfao"
,paulderby,2011-09-11T13:40Z,"wizzkid you are deluded, sorry but you just are.

So why dont you ask the families of the people who were on the plane that hit the pentagon where there loved ones are.

,Symn,2011-09-11T19:04Z,"it's fun to believe in conspiracy theories. Too bad they're bullshit. 

The guy that made this is a pathetic twat who created a whole identity out of this 'documentary', because he had non. Loser. Watch the BBC-thing  and all will be explained. 

Oh... @ whizzkid:

PUNCTUATION."
,donthurtthemhammer,2011-09-11T19:26Z,"Just tell me how ther BBC had a reporter reporting on how Building 7 fell before the building even feel? They had her on a live feed with Building 7 in the background describing how it feel from "" THe Fire "" and when they noticed their mistake they blacked out her picture and said they lost the feed. Everyone who believes the original story I am not mad at you. This whole event is full of tragedy and emotions and with all of that surrounding this its hard to see the truth. Emotions forces alot of us to make decisions without facts. I was the same way. I didn't want to believe any of the conspiracy shit. ut not until I went pass my emotions and took time to listen and do my own investigation I came up with the hard fact that the offical story was a FUCKING LIE!! Now some of these conspiracy theories on this event is way out. I mean even crazy at times but I think they are put out there to confuse people and to give ammo to people that believe the original story so they can point at people who don't beleive the original story and say look they are crazy!!! do your own investigation. all of these DVDs should be stepping stones to your own investigation and not the bibles of truth. Trust me. Get pass your emotions, do your own investigations and you will find the truth !!!!!"

,boi.,2011-09-12T16:54Z,"Look at the facts, its not about ""conspiracy theories"". And the facts say what people dont want to hear, the truth.

Remember remember the eleventh of September
THERMITE! A plane it t'was not!
I see no reason why the murder of freedom
Should ever be forgot


Time to open your eyes, its not pretty. And if its all like they said it is, they wont mind doing and independent inquiry into it.........oh wait, after 10 years there still hasnt been one. "
,bigdump,2011-09-18T01:41Z,"the worst thing is when people try to make you feel stupid for doing your own research and drawing your own conclusions.... ""DUH! look at these idiots actually trying to find their own facts and actually trying to use their brains, what a bunch of morons... just drink beer and watch football, idiots!!""... the reason you're so closed-minded is due to the fact that you've never actually had to use your brain before. not everything conspiracy theorists say is true, but not everything in the official story is true either. the real truth is somewhere in between, but you'll never know it if you think you can make fun of people with curious minds. it's closed-minded know-it-alls who have stopped EVERY SINGLE social, scientific, technological, spiritual progress we've EVER made in the history of humanity. learn how to use your mind and stop sitting around assuming you know everything because you watch the news. that is an insult to humanity and makes you look like a complete fucking idiot. you don't have to agree with the point of view of everyone, but at least they're doing something to expand, learn and inform... what the fuck are the rest of you doing?? getting stupider every day? wow, you're so amazing.... sorry, YOUR so amazing, like, whoa, like, beer, like totally!"
