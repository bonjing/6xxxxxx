British R&B singer/songwriter Jay Sean is notable for being one of the first British-Asian crossover stars and also for his international popularity. Born Kamaljit Singh Jhooti on March 26, 1981, in the London borough of Hounslow, he began rapping at age 11 and eventually switched to R&B music, in part because of his Indian heritage, which made it difficult for him to break into the British rap scene. Sean was signed in 2003 by 2Point9, an all-in-one entertainment company whose roster is comprised of British Asian artists such as Rishi Rich, and he made his recording debut late in the year with "Dance with You (Nachna Tere Naal)." Produced by Rishi Rich and featuring fellow 2Point9 artist Juggy D, "Dance with You (Nachna Tere Naal)" became a major hit in the United Kingdom, reaching number 12 on the singles chart. In the wake of his debut single's success, Sean was offered a lucrative major-label recording contract with Virgin Records. He accepted the offer and opted to drop out of Queen Marys School of Medicine and Dentistry, where he was studying to become a doctor. Me Against Myself (2004), his debut album, became a Top 30 hit in the U.K., spawning a pair of Top Ten hit singles (Eyes on You, Stolen); plus, the album became an even bigger hit in India, where it was a chart-topping success and went multi-platinum, thanks in part to Seans appearance in the Bollywood film Kya Kool Hain Hum (2005). Despite his international success, Sean was dropped by Virgin Records and released his second album, My Own Way (2008), independently via 2Point9 Records. Though its release date was pushed back repeatedly because of Internet leaks, My Own Way debuted at number six on the U.K. albums chart, a significant improvement over his last album, which had been released by a major label. The album spawned a couple U.K. Top 20 hits, Ride It and Maybe, the former of which also charted internationally in countries including Poland, Portugal, Romania, and Bulgaria. The focus would turn towards America in 2009 when Sean signed with the Cash Money label. The relationship kicked off with the single Down featuring special guest and label mate Lil Wayne. The track would land on Sean's album All or Nothing released in November of that year. In late 2010 the single 2012 (It Ain't the End) announced the coming of his 2011 album Freeze Time.
