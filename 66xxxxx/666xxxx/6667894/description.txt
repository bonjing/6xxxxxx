The world\'s leading Horror News site says The Orphan Killer is great horror and great genre potion. Iâ€™m gonna have to call this one outstanding and a return to classic horror with a lethal bang! An impressive visceral contribution that will be talked about for quite some time.

Horror Jungle is the home of a primeval wilderness dedicated to horror movies both new and old. The Orphan Killer ended climatically and very tense. I enjoyed every minute of this film. Let me tell you this is a huge hit. As of right now TOK is in my Top 10 horror films of 2011 list. I highly recommend this horror film. 9/10
