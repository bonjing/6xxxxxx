From parades, sporting events, and black-tie galas to political rallies, product-release parties, and anniversary celebrations, this is the definitive guide to event photography. With the recent advent of relatively inexpensive digital cameras, consumers are becoming increasingly proficient at capturing important moments on their own. In order to save their business and stay in front of the curve, professional photographers must proactively build their businesses by initiating new contacts, selecting the best equipment for each job, and enhancing their marketing and promotional skills. Detailed information on how to be successful before, during, and after the eventâ€”including proper professional etiquette, lighting and posing options, and snapping unobtrusive action shotsâ€”is included as well advice on working with both the images and client after a job.
