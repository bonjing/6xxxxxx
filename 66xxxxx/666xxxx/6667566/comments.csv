,heatinupfast,2011-09-12T04:33Z,"I joined TPB just to thank you. My wife is an Anglophile with 3 years living in London and she can't get enough of this series! I got a little nervous when you apparently went on vacation, I thought I was going to have to download the individual series. The omnibus is a lifesaver. THANKS W.E.O.."
