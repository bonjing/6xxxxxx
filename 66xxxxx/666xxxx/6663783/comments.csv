,jj423,2011-09-09T23:48Z,well my link was removed to the video so just go to youtube and put this in: Dead Island Mods By Team XPG *Dev Menu!*
,Kirtaner,2011-09-10T01:14Z,"If you actually think this is Live safe because ABGX said it passed basic security sector stealth checks, you are retarded and deserve your ban.

You realize all data is checksummed and WILL fail Live security verification if modified, right?"
,Kirtaner,2011-09-10T01:15Z,I guarantee if you play this copy while on Live you won't be on Live anymore come christmas.
,Kirtaner,2011-09-10T01:18Z,Why are my comments disappearing? Ugh.
,jj423,2011-09-10T02:32Z,"i really hate it when someone comes on here talking like they know something...this game doesnt have a checksum you fuckin retard...and it is live safe. if you dont think so, dont d/l it...simple as that, but dont come on my shit running your mouth, cuz you dont know shit"
,jj423,2011-09-10T02:55Z,"i ""guarentee"" your a fuckin idiot, so shut the fuck up...."
,rishi82in,2011-09-10T08:55Z,"hi jj423 i trust you, just wanted to ask if i want play complete storyline do i have to enable something or cheats will automatically be there...ill be playing offline..thanks"
,jj423,2011-09-10T15:02Z,"@rishi82in, the super kick/punch and added stamina will be automatic. to use the dev menu, simply pause youe game and scroll down to it on the bottom and select what you want. thats it! there are alot of options to choose from!"
,rishi82in,2011-09-10T16:34Z,"thanks jj423,appreciate your support...will seed for sure"
,DJ_SEVEN,2011-09-10T18:09Z,"Who gives a FUCK about live anyway, its you guys who cant live without that shit thats retarded, thanx uploader for you effort!"
,jj423,2011-09-10T19:00Z,"yeah, live is ok...but not really that important. but as i said before, this is live safe, anyone who doesnt think so can eat shit. on another note, be careful what you mod cuz you might ruin the game for yourself! if there is no challenge, there is no point! ENJOY!"
,Krock0,2011-09-11T01:06Z,"Tank's for the post .

But please don't say us this is OK for Live .
Just take around in web to see for yourself ."
,jj423,2011-09-11T01:37Z,"LIKE I SAID....ITS SAFE FOR XBOX LIVE. IF YOU DONT BELIEVE THAT, PLAY OFFLINE...DAMN"
[T],Sunblock.,2011-09-11T12:25Z,"Its NOT Live safe or ony safe at all. Any modification to games , console etc..makes it higher risk of ban,. FACT!...But its up to ppl what they want to do or belive."
,jj423,2011-09-11T14:58Z,im done argueing...do what you wanna do. i just wanted to share.
,DJ_SEVEN,2011-09-11T15:29Z,"Just a heads up, this sc modded version asks for a mandatory  update, and as im on a old system i havent done anything yet."
,jj423,2011-09-11T15:51Z,IF YOU UPDATE IT WILL REFLASH YOUR DRIVE BACK TO STOCK IF YOUR NOT ON THE NEWEST LT FIRMWARE. NOT A BIG DEAL JUST REFLASH BACK. BUT MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THAT OPTION BEFORE YOU PROCEED!!!
,arathanstorrents,2011-09-11T16:05Z,ahh boo-hoo jenns bitch
,rishi82in,2011-09-12T06:35Z,working perfectly fine as mentioned by jj423..it has made my game much more fun..thanks jj423..fyi..im playing offline 
,jj423,2011-09-12T16:13Z,"@rishi82in, im glad you like it, i also think it makes the game better! i just upped a gamesave editor for this game as well, for those who prefer that method vs iso modding."
,oscartkoyou,2011-09-12T22:31Z,i think this game iso is garbage because the file size is to big when the real marvel.vs.capcom.3.xbox360-complex is much smaller in size i dont know what the extra files are but fir those of you that say they got it working maybe you can let us now how you got this broken game iso to work in abgx because the rest of us cant
,jj423,2011-09-13T01:44Z,"as i said in the discription. IT WILL THROW AN ERROR IN ABGX, thats normal. it passes basic stealth and plays just like the unmodified version. burn it as you would any other game."
[T],Sunblock.,2011-09-13T12:30Z,"I would not call it ""normal"". If abgx can throw a error what do think a billllllooon dollar corporation can do?..."
,jj423,2011-09-13T15:22Z,"@Sunblock. its normal for the game, if you dont wanna d/l it, dont. but stop trolling my torrent. thanks."
,rishi82in,2011-09-13T18:38Z,"jj423 would request you to stop responding to the useless comments, im playing it & enjoying...its just that people who could not do it..they r just jealeous..cheers "
,jj423,2011-09-13T18:52Z,"@rishi82in, your right, im going to from now on. so unless you need help or have something useful to say, i wont be responding...i have better shit to do than try and deal with some ungreatful trollers.. "
[T],Sunblock.,2011-09-13T19:59Z,I would never put this crap in my xbox just to get it banned. Tell me what its im going to be jealeous of? cheating in a game?..lol..any one who have bean on the scene knows this is the first thing M$ looks for to ban consols (modded isos)....but what ever....
,coolzer0,2011-09-13T20:06Z,"@Sunblock  Word!.
"
,morbalbtman,2011-09-13T22:18Z,great i was thinking about downloading this but with all the comments i think i am going to pass.  must be a fake.  ill wait for the release.
,jj423,2011-09-13T23:31Z,"HAHAHAHA this is the release... what, you think its gonna come out at gamestop? to see it in action all you gotta do is go to youtube and put in:""Dead Island Mods By Team XPG *Dev Menu!*"""
,jamallachgar,2011-09-14T07:00Z,"This is cool but it is NOT Xbox Live safe,play at your own risk"
,aldo45,2011-09-14T14:05Z,"@oscartkoyou - You're either posting on the wrong torrent or you're a fucking idiot mate.

@Uploader - I don't give a fuck about X-Box Live, unlike some of these whimpering girls here. Thanks for taking the time to u/l this. Peace bro."
,jj423,2011-09-14T15:58Z,"@aldo45, your welcome, enjoy!"

,jj423,2011-09-15T23:11Z,"**UPDATE** i have been told the dev menu no longer works after you apply the title update. so if thats the case, just delete the title update and either play it offline, or fill all your shit offline using the mod, save your game, then re-apply the t.u. and enjoy all the stuff online."
,babyleo1,2011-09-16T22:36Z,Yeah seriously this torrent is fucking awesome fuck playing online of course you'll get banned idiots just play it its worth it...
,PanosGR360,2011-09-17T16:42Z,"jj423 thanks for uploading. BUT...I had a problem. I burnt the iso into a DVD9 and when I put it on the console, it started updating and...stayed there! Even though I turned on and off the console....it stayed there! Stuck! Now I have to reflash my console. 
Thanks though for youe efforts. Appreciated. "
,JordanWillo,2011-09-18T12:41Z,"i burnt to disc put it in, wants me to update but wont that mean i'll need to reflash my xbox? .. (i only play offline)"
,jj423,2011-09-18T20:28Z,"@everyone, if the disc prompts you to update, that means your dash is out of date, and yes you will indeed need to re-flash after the update. im sry, there is no way around it. "
,rishi82in,2011-10-08T04:57Z,hey jj423...ru gonna do something abt dead rising off the record?

,thalefty,2011-11-22T06:30Z,"This version of dead island will make your xbox 360 require an update which banned consoles can't do. This will nearly brick your xbox; there is a way to unbrick your xbox however. Even afterwards the update leaves your xbox unmodded.
