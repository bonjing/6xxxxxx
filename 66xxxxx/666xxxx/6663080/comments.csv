I've seen you have uploaded a lot of Bowie albums in DTS. But I wonder - what is the source for these recordings? 
DTS and DVD Audio as well has a sampling frequence at 96KHz which means the sound frequence is 48KHz. But I'm a little bit confused. Has all these Bowie albums really been released in the UK in SACD or DVD Audio with a sound frequence of 48KHz and a sampling frequence at 96KHz? "
,CompuTerror,2011-09-09T19:47Z,"Most of the DTS albums I've uploaded are upmixes... There is a few that is from SACD source though.

But this DTS album is straight from the DVD DTS audio track."

Most of the DTS albums I've uploaded are upmixes. Only a few are from SACD source. This pack however is the DTS 5.1 audio track from the DVD which also is included."
