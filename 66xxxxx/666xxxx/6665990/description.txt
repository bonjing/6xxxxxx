[size=18][color=red][b]JESUS:[/b][/color][/size] Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

[size=14]I received inspiration to write the following text.  I hope that inspiration will be passed onto you after reading it.

Our Holy Temple:
Don\'t get me wrong; the scriptures ARE great and all.  But Jesus came here and sacrificed himself allowing the Devil to torture and crucify him, not merely for the sake of the scriptures, but for YOU!  It\'s the Goodness of \"YOUR\" Holy Temple which he seeks being created in the Image of the High Father and ALL his Glory.  It\'s about time Christians realize this and begin to treat themselves worthy of such a WONDERFUL gift!!!  

For instance, the 10 Commandments are not simply to teach us right from wrong, but to help us understand how to treat our Temples.  If you are unwilling to recognize the essence and worth of your Holy Temples, God\'s greatest gift, and respect yourselves enough and treat them accordingly, then how do you expect anyone else, including God, to respect you?  Too many Christians give the excuse that breaking the Commandments and turning to sin is acceptable because Man is of sin.  Newsflash - WE ARE MADE IN GOD\'s IMAGE, Like God, and For God, NOT the Devil.  Our Temples are HOLY, not unholy!  God gave us these Commandments and ordered us NOT to commit SIN, not because it\'s unattainable, but because it\'s expected of us!!!  

Do not shy away from this and quit searching for an easy way out.  Excuses through poor use of the scripture is readily found.  However, they\'re just excuses that ease your burden of conscience.  Thus, removing all Fear associated to not following the Holy Spirit of Grace and Eternity in the Firy Furnace.  ALL Christians know the best form of worship anyone may give to God is to treat and place their Holy Temples, made in God\'s Image, in such high regard over and above all forms and pervasiveness of evil.  Why do Christians take better care of their personal belongings than they do their Holy Temples??  If they do NOT respect themselves, they do NOT respect GOD!  Stop this madness and recognize what you\'re actually destroying.  

God\'s Grace offers salvation, but only to those who both desire and commit to that salvation.  If lacking the courage to commit, then Christians need to rely more on their Love for God and not hurt him so deeply.  Please STOP making God shed his tears due to your ingratitude and lack of desire.  Drop this MIS-conception that it\'s okay to SIN and still be saved.  God does not want to send his children to Hell, but it\'s OUR choice.  If you Love God or at least love yourselves, do not follow this path of disregard and discontent.  Open your hearts and be thankful for what God has given us and your HEAVENLY rewards that lay in wait.  The BEST is yet to come.  Remember, loving God is loving yourself and for anyone not knowing, the more you love him, you\'ll realize the more you love yourself and everything else around you.  It\'s simply wonderful.  SO, remove yourselves from the FLESH and stop living for the moment.  Failure will only acknowledge your unwillingness to be Blessed.  

I plead with you, follow ALL of the 10 Commandments, Obey God\'s Laws and the Sabbath, Cherish his Love for us, and if necessary, be willing to DIE for him and his LAWS.  God, in all his Majesty, is apart of us all.  Stop living only for yourselves and SHARE your life with him.  He\'s living it with you anyhow, so WAKE UP and start living it with HIM!!!


Hebrews 10:26:29
If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the Truth,
NO sacrifice for sin is left,
but only fearful expectation of judgement and of raging fire
that will consume the enemies of God.  

Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died
without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.  
How much more severely do you think a man deserves to be punished
who has trampled to Son of God under foot,
who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant
that sanctified him, and
who has insulted the Spirit of Grace?

[size=14]Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.

[size=14] One last note.  I recently watched a video clip on \"Limited Atonement\" and again, received inspiration to write the following text.  Typing it seemed to flow with ease and while doing such, it brought tears to my eyes.  It read...

 \"Limited Atonement\" hogwash!  Guess sin doesn\'t matter, repentance, or remorse. Maybe its simply limited in that thru Grace we get away with it. So again, it doesn\'t matter. Guess (and I do that a lot) when the Lord cries because we care so little about sin we can keep doing it too. Guess, it doesn\'t matter that we knowingly continue to defile our Temples and others well-being because we have been Saved.  

Guess, the only difference between Good and Evil is that Good believes in Christ. Guess by now, I should learn to control my anxiety over the Lord\'s heart-felt weeping because we refuse to obey his laws due to being Saved and self-righteousness. Guess, I\'m an idiot and should not be so concerned about others lack of caring for themselves and others. Guess, I\'ll try not to comment on these matters anymore because others seem to get angry and not understand.  

Please forgive me Lord because I am inept and wish I could do more. I love you Lord with all my heart, more than life itself.  With all my Love and Devotion, if I only had more. If only I could not be such a disappointment in your eye, and maybe sometime, brighten your day as much you do mine. God Bless everyone!
