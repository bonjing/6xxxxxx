Review From IMDB



The Sullivan brothers grew up together in a small town in Iowa. They would eventually join the 

Navy after Pearl Harbor was attacked and would be killed in action. The story is a true one and 

heart wrenching to say the least. Thomas Mitchell is perfectly cast as the father. A very young 

Bobby Driscoll plays little Al, the youngest of the 5 Sullivan boys. Anne Baxter and Ward Bond 

were magnificent. Get yourself a box of Kleenex for this one folks. It will stay with you for a 

long time.
