Is it becauz teh torrenz can only handle less tanh 50 meglobytes at one timez?  Because I've always wondered how people got around that limitation in the past.

Don't get me wrong, I honestly and truly do appreciate the upload.  As a side benefit I would also greatly appreciate an explanation for something that has been so vexing me these past months."
