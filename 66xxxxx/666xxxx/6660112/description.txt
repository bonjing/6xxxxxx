Les deux soirs filmÃ©s du concert de Led Zeppelin Ã  Earls Court en intÃ©gralitÃ©. QualitÃ© d'image moyenne et son plutÃ´t bon. Ces lives ont Ã©tÃ© filmÃ©s Ã  la demande du groupe mais leur distribution n'est pas officielle. On retrouve certaines pistes sur le DVD officiel de Led Zeppelin.
Le premier soir provient d'un DVD achetÃ© en magasin (trÃ¨s rare en magasin en France !) et le deuxiÃ¨me provient d'un torrent, lÃ  aussi trÃ¨s dur Ã  trouver.


Both nights complete filmed concert of Led Zeppelin at Earls Court Arena. Average image quality and sound pretty good. These lives were filmed at the request of the group but their distributions are not official. There are some tracks on the official DVD of Led Zeppelin.
The first night from a store-bought DVDs (very rare in stores in France!) And the second from a torrent, also hard to find.
