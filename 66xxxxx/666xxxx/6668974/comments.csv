,farkstick,2011-09-12T23:06Z,IMMERSE - where mediocrity week after week is just fine.
,rawree,2011-09-13T02:14Z,"Thanks for this release. As much as morons complain, they don't understand that it is a GOOD thing that multiple rips exist. If we ever got dependent on one source, and one source only, no matter how good, it'd be devastating to lose that source.
That said, the WEB-DL ones, while loved by many, I loathe. Using the AppleTV2Flash hack with XBMC, the WEB-DL stuff runs, but seems to skip every few frames. Runs full speed, but looks like a goddamn strobelight... feels like you're on meth!"
,Esmad3,2011-09-13T19:43Z,This is crap and so are the people who defend it. Here's the good one: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6670011/Breaking.Bad.S04E09.Bug.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H.264-TB.mkv
