Both multiplayer are basicly the same, but with different amounts of servers and different maps."
,ibackpack,2011-09-16T22:44Z,Guys don't waste your time doesn't work. The single player and multiplayer both say your product key is invalid and there is no option to change it.
,Victor_Blackpage,2011-09-19T19:25Z,"It doesnÂ´t work dude... The key is invalid, and there is no way to change it."
,StoopidMerekat,2011-10-01T18:43Z,Does not work. Says that there's an invalid key. It's unfixable like the other two people have said so far.

,batosuai,2011-11-22T01:54Z,"Hey tehjones, that would be all fine and good if somebody explained to me how to change the product key, it doesn't give you that option."
,Spinfx,2011-12-04T06:27Z,"What the other guys said. This torrent contains folders of the ALREADY-INSTALLED game. What the sweet jesus FUCK?

1. Attempting to run either Halo.exe or HaloCE.exe from the respective folders first opens an EULA, and then pops up an error message saying you have an invalid key.

2. Installing the game from elsewhere (so that you can enter a different key during installation, duh), and then replacing the game files with the contents of these folders also does not work and produces the same error.

I'm only looking to play the SP Campaign, and there's already a working torrent for that -- the problem is I want to use the console devmode cheats and apparently that only comes with the CE version.

-
Doubtful if anyone can get this torrent's contents working, but if you do, let us know exactly what you did and did you get the console working in the campaign (which should confirm that it works)."
