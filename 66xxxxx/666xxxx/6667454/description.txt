STORY
 Once again, Sam â€˜Seriousâ€™ Stone must use the Time-Lock to travel through time and destroy the enemies of humanityâ€™s past, in order to save its future. 
 But since his last outing, 2 important new relics have been discovered: the Gun Stacker and the Porta Pad. 

 Only Sam is serious enough â€“ and crazy enough â€“ to use this untested technology. 



 All that stands between victory and annihilation is a man with a T-shirt and jeansâ€¦ and a great big pile of guns.
