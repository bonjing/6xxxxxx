,slash97,2011-09-22T18:49Z,the installer seems to be corrupt i'm guessing there is something wrong with the inf files i don't see ant text in them maybe you should upload the working and proper inf files if that's the problem. If u don't want to re upload you can atleast tell us how to fix the setup .its fine by me if u tell us how to fix the setup  
,ReiFukai,2011-09-29T04:19Z,"Here is how to fix the save game and profile option in this game.

Go into the root dir of game. Ex. C:\program files\dead island\

Create the following dir's..

in the game root, create a dir called OUT.
in the OUT create two more dir's called SAVE and PROFILE.

ex.
C:\program files\dead island\out\save
C:\program files\dead island\out\profiles

Thats it. The save game and option profile will now work.

Cheers!"
