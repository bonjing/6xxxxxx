,JamesPY,2011-09-21T22:27Z,"This FLAC format is the best in sound quality, pitifully it only works on a pc. Thanks!"
,ibitton,2011-09-21T23:40Z,"@JamesPY: it's the 21st century, buddy. FLAC will work just fine on most modern and respectable audio players.
It even works on Apple devices (after some tinkering)!! :)
Altho i would recommend a cowon player with decent 'phones for those true audiophiles..."

,Milfhunter1992,2011-11-11T12:17Z,@JamesPY: convert the .flac to Apple Lossless to play these on iPod.
