I'm usually reasonably good at tracking down ebooks (and converting them if necessary), but I've not had any luck with My Name Escapes Me, or any of Alec Guinness' books for that matter. If you have them I'd be most appreciative."

,rabocop,2011-09-11T02:43Z,"Thanks for looking. It's a mystery to me why some books are easy to find and others impossible, and I'm talking beyond the obvious stuff like if it's really obscure it'll be harder to find than a bestseller. I've only just found Obama's book Dreams From My Father after some serious searching, when his other two were virtually presented to me in any number of bulk collections..."
