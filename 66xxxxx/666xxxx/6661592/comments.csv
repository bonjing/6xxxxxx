,mr.mannnn,2011-09-09T14:47Z,"No actually, because most movies are wider than 16:9, so to save space they cut out the white space so that is actually 1080p"
,arnold991,2011-09-11T12:36Z,"jayp78, you have two torrents and source of both are same DVD9;

1) 1080p 6.01GB

2) DVD9 7.64GB

Pls help me, I want the highest possible quality of this movie, so which one should I download ?

As far as I can comprehend, 1080p source is same DVD9 and resolution has been just upped to 1080p. So, will DVD9 give better picture quality than 1080p in this case ?

Waiting for the reply, thx"
