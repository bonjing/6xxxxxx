Do you have a 2gig Bluray rip of the International version of the ""Blade Runner""?
It's the one with Harrison Fords narration in various parts of the movie

There is not one good rip of this version to be found!!"

,SpeedyUp,2011-12-08T19:33Z,"This is the Final Cut, but it dates 2007, not 1997.

In 1997 the DVD version of the Director's cut (1992) was released. Which was NOT cut by the director. So this Final cut is more like a real director's cut. :) "
