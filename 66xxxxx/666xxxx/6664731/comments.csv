,dude8888,2011-09-11T02:59Z,"I spoke too soon, so I owe my apologies to you Zen_Bud

My son had made a change to our PC when he was playing some games & it had affected the sound of all movies

The audio on ""A Fish Called Wanda"" is fine now

I should have known because all of your other Bluray rips have been great..."
