When did the virus happen? during install or when you started, I have been playing game for a few days now, no problems here."
,quark000,2011-09-09T17:56Z,"hi ,  i downloaded it about 2 hours ago, d/clicked on the installer, my pc then rebooted itself  and would not let me back into windows , i am using win 7 X64 , i then tried it on my laptop and it did the same thing laptop is running X32 ), as i thought maybe it was 64 bit win 7   at fault, wouldnt care  it sounds a good game too"

I uninstalled my version, and reinstalled it again.
I am using win7 32 bit, I am not sure why it crashed your setup, I am sorry to here that, I will be trying it on my other PC and see what happens on that, I will let you know."

Ok tried this on my other PC running XP I had no problems.

I wonder if any of the other seeders have had any problems, sorry once again for your trouble, hope you get things working."

Install the game, right click on the game desktop icon once install is done., 

click properties, a new window should open showing a tab called open file locattion, click on that.

You see a new window open, go into the 
crack folder and drag the file in that folder into the main game folder, overwrite all and then start game.
