,dharneth,2011-09-12T22:37Z,Funny I can watch these videos on my 50 inch. Though I did develop the intelligence to link my computer to my TV. You could also use a conversion program or use Playstation Media Server. It works with the XBOX as well and has a built in converter. I used to watch MP4s with it all the time.
