This week, John Stossel takes a look back on the terror attack and examines the aftermath from the perspective a decade brings. Has the nation made the right decisions? Are there opportunities now to make different choices?

o Our responses to the attack; the Global War on Terror
o Is Islam a religion of Peace, or does it command the faithful to holy war?
o Charity and outreach for victims and for warfighters
o Charity scams playing upon the intense emotions of 9/11
o The state of our civil liberties

and John Stossel's take:

"War is the Friend of the State"
