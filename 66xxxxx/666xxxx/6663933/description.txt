A freindly, clearly explained primer for music theory. From what is a staff to basic chord progressions and everything in between, including key signatures, scales, modes, and much more.

Each chapter and section includes a comprehensive, cross-referenced review, specially designed for optimal memorization. In addition, practical use exercises reinforce what is learned.

Book contains a large glossary, index, blank staff paper, and a piano keyboard which doubles as a bookmark and is used with the reviews.

An excellent and friendly book.
