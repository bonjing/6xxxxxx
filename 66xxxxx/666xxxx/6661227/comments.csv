In the winter, I'm a Buddhist
In the summer, I'm a Nudist

Then there's Sturgeon's Law, so appropriate:

95% of everything is crap

Yes, you should study Sturgeon. Damn smart."

I swear that you understand not everything
Not from the Koran nor the Bible, not even Buddhism.
Your attention to your stomach and reproductive system.
Like cattle

Think of your mind
Do not think your instinct
