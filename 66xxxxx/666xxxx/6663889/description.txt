GRAND-AM Rolex Sports Car Series Race 11 of 2011 Season - Montreal Canada - 20Aug11

Entitled the "Montreal 200" and held on Circuit Gilles Velleneuve in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

This is the final sprint race of the 2011 season. This course is known to be
very hard on tires and brakes. There are 3 long straights where speeds top 150MPH.
And on the 4th straight terminal velocity is 180MPH before diving into a very tight
64MPH turn.

There is a slight glitch in the broadcast just as the GT cars are finishing. There are several seconds of black screen broadcast together with audio loss. This has been edited out and will be noticed as a jump in the screen action.

The video has been lightly edited to remove all commercials, station promos, and most anything not related to the race. Then it is encoded in H.264 MPEG-4/AVC at 5000Kbps, 29.97Fps, 2CH 320KB audio.


Enjoy!
