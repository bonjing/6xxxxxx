Flo Rida, unsurprisingly a native Floridian, is an MC who toured as a teenager with 2 Live Crew's Fresh Kid Ice and began popping up on high-profile mixtapes by 2006, most notably DJ Khaled's We the Best â€” on "Bitch I'm from Dade County," he appeared with the likes of Rick Ross, Trick Daddy, Trina, and Dre (of Cool & Dre). Signed to the Atlantic-distributed Poe Boy that year, he recorded Mail on Sunday, which was released in March of 2008. "Low," featuring T-Pain, was the album's lead single; it reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100. A year later he returned with the album R.O.O.T.S. (Route of Overcoming the Struggle), featuring the massive club hit "Round." Only 1 Flo, Pt. 1 appeared in 2010 with some tracks produced by dance music star David Guetta.
