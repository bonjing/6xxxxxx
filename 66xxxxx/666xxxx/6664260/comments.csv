,vyertago,2011-09-10T09:11Z,Thanks for all the great Rugby uploads.  I like to play them on PS3 if possible and while most of the ones you post I can some like this one I can't.  Not really wanting to transcode them but I noticed that the cappers for this one and the others are the same.  Do the cappers usually release in two different formats?

Many thanks for your tireless efforts to make rugby available to many of us who are locked out of the every-day rugby coverage...and in particular, the RWC!"
