    A naive young girl goes to a model agency, where she is molested,        
    shot up with drugs and forced to become a prostitute.                    
                                                                             
    Sally Down (burlesque star Misty Ayers) proves that BAD GIRLS DO CRY     
    when she's drugged, held prisoner, and forced to work in a               
    whorehouse. Unfortunately, when All-American Tommy Cole tries to help    
    her escape, a trigger-happy hood comes gunning for him and Tommy is      
    forced into hiding... behind a telephone pole.
