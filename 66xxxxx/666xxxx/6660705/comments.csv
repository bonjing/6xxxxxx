,escapeinTV,2011-09-08T20:11Z,"Thanks for sharing!
I only have problem, I installed it but when I try to launch the game I get this error : D3DCOMPILER_43.dll is missing...
could anybody tell me if I did something wrong or what to do ?"
,DjHero,2011-09-08T20:30Z,"I have had 5 dll problems one after another. But fixed them all by downloading the dll's one by one. Finally got it to run properly. But unfortunately there is no sound. I have checked my sound settings, plus the game's sound settings. But still no sound. Very sad actually."

,Koga001,2011-09-15T22:09Z,"Game stops responding after it starts, when the rock shows up on the lower right corner.
Any workarounds?"
,Koga001,2011-09-16T18:38Z,"This is already included on v1.02, but I'm guessing this is v1.0

Here's the fix to the initial freeze:

Go to your My Documents/My Games/UnrealEngine3/BoulderGame/Config directory and open up BoulderEngine.ini

In the top part change:
""Map=BoulderFrontEnd.bmap
LocalMap=Splash_cinametic.bmap
LocalOptions=
TransitionMap=BoulderFrontEnd.bmap""

To:
Map=BoulderFrontEnd.bmap
LocalMap=BoulderFrontEnd.bmap
LocalOptions=
TransitionMap=BoulderFrontEnd.bmap

Save it, and play the game. "
