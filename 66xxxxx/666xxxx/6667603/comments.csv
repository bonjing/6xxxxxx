Video itself has glitches for me, was hoping they would stop but just got worse. Would have been a great download if not for that!"
,rumpltumpskin,2011-10-20T19:32Z,"could not burn with ConvertXtoDVD v3 which has always been reliable. it was a very fast download though. the error was with the AAC-7 but that is not to say that there is something wrong with this torrent, i assume that you just have to make sure you have a converter/burning program that supports it.

what program did you use TopVillan?"
