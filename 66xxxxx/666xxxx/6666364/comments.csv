You know it'd be more useful if you actually told me what the error is? =/"

,Insomneac,2011-09-11T23:32Z,"That's usually a .NET framework error.

Try reinstalling it if you already have it."
,Government10,2011-09-30T01:39Z,"I also got the framework error,  and after reading your comment on downloading the ""junk"" and installing it,  i was pretty sure it would still fail.

But nope,  works like a charm now,  props to you sir,  and thanks for the upload."
