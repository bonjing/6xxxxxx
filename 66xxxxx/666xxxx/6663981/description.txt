

Pacer was The Amps' only LP. It was released on October 31, 1995. The album is titled after 
the first track. The song "I Am Decided" was a combination of two songs written by Robert 
Pollard, which were given to Kim Deal as a gift after she produced some songs for Guided 
by Voices. The song "Hoverin'" was originally recorded by the Breeders as a B-side track 
on the single "Divine Hammer". "Tipp City" was sampled on Girl Talk's "Unstoppable" album.
