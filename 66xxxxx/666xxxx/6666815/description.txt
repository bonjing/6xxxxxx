So annoyingly rare..even in this day an age.. i had to track them down on vinyl from ebay.

I ripped these from vinyl myself... so the quality is not 100%. but its good enough i promise


their other album (White Side of Night 1983) is missing from this torrent and my collection. please leave a comment below if you have it.. as i would love to hear it.

enjoy and please re-seed

Maith ar Fad!
