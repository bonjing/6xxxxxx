From the Podenco Canario story website:

The life of most Podenco Canarios is one filled with pain and suffering, as they are mostly used for one purpose only:
to serve as a tool for the hunters.

If they are no longer useful for the hunters, they will get rid of them, and the methods are usually brutal.
Until that happens, their lives are usually spent in small concrete rooms or in small cages with up to 20 other Podencos.

The reason that www.podencocanario.net exists is to put a personal story out in regards to the Podencos and the rescue and
adoption of one of these beautiful dogs, and to get the word out to the rest of the world to try and help more of them.

These videos are from the personal pages of Podenco Canario and all show you how beautiful and friendly these dogs are.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

Podenco Canario (In English: Canary Islands Hound, Canarian Warren Hound, Canarian Pharaoh Hound) 
is a breed of dog originally from the Canary Islands. 
The Podenco Canario is still used in the Canary Islands today in packs as a hunting dog, primarily used for rabbit hunting.
The word "podenco" is Spanish for "hound". "Canario" means "Canarian" or "of the Canaries".
