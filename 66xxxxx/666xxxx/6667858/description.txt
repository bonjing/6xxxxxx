Two of my vinyl LP rips- The Woodentops "Giant" and "Wooden Foot Cops on the Highway". Great albums from the 80s, all at 320kps to preserve the ticks and pops of the original vinyl! (Honestly, it sounds pretty damn good!)

Linear Tracked LP- Harman/Kardon ST-7 with Audio Technica AT440MLa Recorded/Edited/Tracks made with Audacity 1.3.3, .MP3 files converted with iTunes 7.4.2

Hope you enjoy!
