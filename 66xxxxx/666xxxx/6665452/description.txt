All credit and thanks to jps176 for his extraordinary effort and generosity in ripping and sharing this historic release. All tracks are lossless FLAC (HDCD, no less) and come with 100% logs, cues, and a huge amount of artwork. Besides individual cover scans for each show, there are many photos of the interior and exterior of the steamer trunk packaging taken from all angles, plus scans of the 32 page tour book and even the sticker.

Enjoy the music and please remember to seed back as long as possible so others can get this.
