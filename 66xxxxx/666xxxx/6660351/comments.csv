,george1052,2011-09-08T20:01Z,Hi and thank you for this torrent. Would you or anyone else know how to shrink the songs to fit on a cd? I know that cds are becoming obsolete and I'm outdated with everyone using ipods and stuff but I'd really like to include ALL 21 songs on a disc. Any tips would be appreciated. Thanks.

re-rip it with 192 or 128 bitrate
hit google for programs
1 of them called ""format factory"" TRY IT"
