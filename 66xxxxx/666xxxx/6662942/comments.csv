,jonmobrien,2011-10-07T17:15Z,"Hey there vigvinraj - thanks for coming back! :) You're a legend, I can't wait to grab and watch this."
,jonmobrien,2011-10-20T19:23Z,"Oooh, this is getting close to 100% done.
I can't wait! You see, I am in desperate need of this video because I won a Dragon Egg is a Wizards poker game (Texas Holdem of course), and I have no idea of how to raise a dragon. But everyone knows a dragon hatchling learn their good or bad habits in their first days, so the most important time to Train Your Dragon is from its birth. So far, the only guidance I have received is from my old friend Hagrid, but I think he has ADD or something. He is very excitable, and every time he tried to teach me about young dragons, he rambles and starts rambling on about Hipogryphs and Blacky and whatever you do don't get him started on Harry!!!

Now, my dragon egg is due to hatch on Hallow's Eve, so you see, I don't have much time left.

Thanks for your upload!"

,ilusam,2012-02-11T14:09Z,"Hi vigvinraj this movie is not in English may be its in Russian is there any way to convert it in to English.
If anyone knows please Help me out."
,swimtwobirds,2012-02-16T00:38Z,Soundtrack seems to be Russian - so until I can find an english language DVD and rip the audio to replace the 3D movie soundtrack using Vegas Pro I am using subtitles which I got from http://www.allsubs.org//search-subtitle/how+to+train+your+dragon+en/20 - not the ideal solution but it works!
,swimtwobirds,2012-02-23T02:07Z,"Revelation!!!! This movie contains both complete Russian and English soundtracks.  Simply use your player controls (Audio) to select the English track. It works perfectly.
