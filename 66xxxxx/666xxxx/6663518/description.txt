Tribes of the East (ToE) is Heroes 5 second addon, which also

works as a standalone game. It contains all the features of H5,

and adds a lot more. ToE features a new faction: Stronghold,
 
home of the mighty Orcs. All creatures now have two possible

upgrades: the classic upgrade and an alternate upgrade. Both

can be recruited from the same upgraded building in town, and

they can even be retrained into one another.
