[Penthouse.] India Summer (Money Talks 2: Living In A Material World)



Stacia and Paul entertain their new neighbors and dazzle them with their many cool possessions. What the neighbors don`t know is that this married couple is a fake. They work for a woman who invented an entirely new advertising concept. She gets her employees to pose as hip couples and selects expensive products for them to promote to their friends. Maggie absolutely forbids her employees from having sex, but reserves the right to intimate access to her employees. Paul is about to find out about that particular clause of their contract.
