,denys555,2011-09-16T16:16Z,"One of the files has ""shrinking harvests"" in the title. That is complete nonsense. In the 1930's the average corn harvest in Iowa was 23 bushels per acre. Now it's between 140 and 150. Yes, that's correct, no typo. Check it. 

Should we be concerned about environmental problems, keep doing research and modify our behavior? Yes. Should we go bugshit hysterical? No. 

Calm done you nutters. Read some actual books and stop doing all your research on the internet."
