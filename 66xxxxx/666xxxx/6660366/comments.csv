,Furyio,2011-09-24T14:15Z,"Not showing up for me in Wow : /

Extracted to the correct folder but cannot see if as an ingame addon to activate 

Any suggestions ? "
,wubs23,2011-09-29T08:30Z,"@ Furyio, you have to extract the entire folder to WoW/Interface/Addons.

then you launch WoW, login, and then you see your characters.
On the bottom left it should have a button saying ""addons"" or sth similar. 

Click on this, click on ""load out of date addons"" and on Zygor.  Now it should work. 
Also make sure it's available for every character, not just one (again, you can do this in the same menu.) 

hope it helped!"
