CHD's release is the unrated with 130 Mins duration."

,MeToYou,2011-09-25T19:55Z,"@fredyr - actually REFiNEDs release - Bridesmaids.720p.BluRay.x264-REFiNED - is the UNRATED. Their nfo is WRONG! It states 125mins but when you extract the mkv file, the actual video length is 2hrs 10mins 18seconds. which is 130mins.

They should have done a DIRFIX or it should have been PROPERED by another group - but everyone was probably lazy I guess.

So if you download Bridesmaids.720p.BluRay.x264-REFiNED its the same exact thing as this."
