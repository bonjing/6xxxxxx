Atomic City Adventures The Case of the Black Dragon is a single player
3rd person science fiction action game set in a cool retro futuristic
world. It is a world in which flying cars are ordinary, everyone has a
friendly robot, and we all live in tall cities of glass and steel

But in Atomic City, the largest city in this bright future, corruption
has taken a hold, and it s up to an elite crime fighting force "the
Vehicular Strike Force" to clean things up!

Players take on the role of Agent Pam Rodgers, a new agent within the VSF,
and progress through a series of missions in which they battle evil
robots, corrupt corporations, and criminal masterminds while uncovering
a plot that jeopardizes the city itself!

Players begin on foot and on hoverbikes, but soon progress to full blown
flying jetbikes, battling villains both on the ground and in the air in
each new mission as they uncover more of the story

In each mission, players discover new weapons, both for themselves and
their vehicles that they can equip to give them access to a wide array
of blasters, beams and rockets!


Features:

Exciting, fast-paced action both on the ground and in the air using a
wide variety of cool hoverbikes, jetbikes, and weapons

Truly vertical gameplay! Towering skyscrapers, buildings that plunge
away, skyways of cars between vast canyons of concrete and steel

Retro sci-fi style that gives the game a fresh look and makes it stand
apart from other action games



Burn/mount, install, play!
