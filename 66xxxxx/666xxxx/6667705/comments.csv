,dsafjaly69,2011-09-12T21:37Z,"Thanks for the download,  but I think this is only compatible with Vista/7,  doesn't work on my XPsp3 machine, just get an ""Entry point not found"" error. I looked around but only reference to the error I could find seemed to indicate an incompatibility with XP. Seems to be confirmed by system requirements posting on a gamespot DL page.



System Requirements
Minimum:

Microsoft Windows Vista / 7
1 GB Available System Memory
Video Card with Pixel Shader 2.0 Support (or Greater)
1.4 GB Available Hard Drive Space "

,SlackerPD,2011-09-13T07:36Z,"One last thing i tried, i extraced the install file out of the iso with 7zip and that seem to do the trick, apparently alcohol 52 has some problems reading the iso correctly, so if you get the same error, try that."
