,raimundolacerda,2011-09-19T09:37Z,"to all who have downloaded the formula 1 season of 1998
from list of torrents, and to all who are still downloading it:

the old torrent has been replaced with a new one
which contains a new version of the australian grand prix.

if you want to replace the old version australian grand prix
with the new one, which has much better video quality
and english audio rather than finnish audio, without having
to start from scratch, here's how to transfer all the data
you've already downloaded from the old torrent to the new one,
with the obvious exception of the mentioned grand prix:

these steps are accurate when using utorrent/bittorrent
but they should be quite similar when using other clients,
and they work for completed downloads as well as
partial downloads.

stop the seeding or downloading (depending on whether
you've reached 100% or not) on the old torrent.

right-click it and select ""delete torrent""
(do not select ""delete torrent + data"")

now browse to the ""F1 1998 Season"" folder
and manually delete the following file:
""Round 01 - Australian GP 1998 (Melbourne).avi""

download the new torrent from here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6686582

open it with your torrent client and select the same
download location as the old torrent, that is,
the ""F1 1998 Season"" folder.
don't just highlight the folder, double-click it
(as so to open it) and click ""save""
and make sure the ""start torrent"" box is unchecked
before clicking ""ok"" and adding the torrent.

now, right-click the new torrent and click on
""force re-check"". if the torrent percentage doesn't
go beyond 0% after this procedure, you'll need to
make sure the download location was selected properly.
just right-click the torrent and select
""advanced - choose download location""
and then ""force re-check"" again.

once the procedure is complete you can start the torrent.

my apologies for any incovenience.
