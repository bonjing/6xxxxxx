Are you going to do Ep. 305 & 306?
I looked on you list & I don't see them. "

,mojoboy1984,2011-09-09T15:38Z,This is good quality.Anyway what is bitrate for video? If you increase it little bit and make file of around  200 mb it would be great quality. even know it is better then those scene releases from Tv team and the others.

I managed to find them via DDL. 

I LOVE THIS SHOW!"
