Jorge Strunz- Neotropical Nocturnes

Neotropical Nocturnes is an entirely new intimate, rhythmic, 
revelatory acoustic guitar creation, with 10 highly original compositions embodying virtuosity and great expressive talent. 

Most of the compositions are inspired by tropical America, 
although the recording as a whole exhibits various influences, notably jazz, 
flamenco, and classical, resulting in a rich guitar style, 
that although never heard as such before, 
clearly enriches the existing guitar music pantheon.
