,CodeX96,2012-04-21T11:28Z,"X264 1080p is the best quality, then in 2nd place is X264 720p and then XVID...i dont understand why encoders all over the world are encoding/converting 1080p sources to 720p when they could easily just leave the resolution alone. nobody cares about having more reference frames 1080p is superior to 720p but theres nothing i can do about it..so im stuck with X264 1080p movies and X264 720p and XVID tv seasons/episodes...wish it would be 1080"
