MuPDF is a lightweight PDF and XPS viewer and parser/rendering library.

The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high quality anti-aliased graphics. It
renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to within fractions of a pixel
for the highest fidelity in reproducing the look of a printed page on screen.

MuPDF is also small, fast, and yet complete. We support PDF 1.7 with
transparency, encryption, hyperlinks, annotations, search and many other bells
and whistles. MuPDF can also read XPS documents (OpenXPS / ECMA-388).

We don't support interactive features such as form filling, javascript and
transitions. MuPDF is written modularly, so such features can be added on by
integrators if they so desire.

Still don't believe me that it is the fastest PDF viewer ever ? Try it yourself, what are you waiting for!
