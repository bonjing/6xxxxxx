So i checked the forums and Battlestar seemed to be the thing. So i download it and the damn thing won't play on PS3. So i check the torrents again And find this one. Posted THE SAME DAY. Fucking love you!....Well, if it works that is. One seeder might take a while :P

P.S 
First!"

For best impact, this should be watched after Season 2, Episode 12. "
