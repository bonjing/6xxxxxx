,nermin123,2011-09-27T14:13Z,It works fine tahnk you :)
,TastyTeo,2011-09-27T19:07Z,"@mrtrolling and @sam20rth - First start downloading the Torrent with uTorrent. after the Torrent is 100% Downloaded. Go back on uTorrent and right click it then Open Containing Folder, now you will be on the downloads folder, from there, you have to extract GTA San Andreas.rar with WinRAR or 7-Zip. Right click the file, and Extract Here, then wait until it is finished, afterwards, open the extracted folder GTA San Andreas, and run gta_sa.exe, the game should start correctly... if it doesn't start properly, try right clicking gta_sa.exe and running as administrator.

@Parth_killer - i think the torrent is well seeded, i started from zero and now has almost 600 Seeders, which is an awesome count and can get you full speeds

@askplz - no problem, seeding means that you leave your torrent client opened uploading the torrent and giving speed to others. the more you upload the more speed others have. "

,TastyTeo,2011-10-20T19:51Z,"@m.s.ruiz - No the disk doesn't matter, it is pre-cracked anyway, maybe you are typing the cheats in your native language, for example you might not been using english and you might use something else. try that, if they do not work, it might be from your laptop or something, i would get a secondary keyboard in your place to play games, its more comfortable even if you are using laptop"

,immagical,2011-12-13T02:40Z,"if you want this game to install properly. 
disable any protection/anti viruses,   
once you get it downloaded disable virus scanners,  ,  
get a zipper program,.  ""i used ""bitzipper""  then extract it to its own folder, (the option to extract to c:\users\san adreas)  will be one of the options,.   
then just simply find the extracted files in the folder you just extracted to and open that file right click the ""gta_sa application icon"" and run as administrator.  and that should be it, just follow the install option and play..    

this is also the AO version (adults only)  so look up on the net for the  ""hot coffee"" cheats,  and also go to  ""gamespot com "" were you will find all the cheats for the pc version ""this one! there,  the cheats are easy to add, just type the letters into the keyboard during game play and you off..

cheat for health/armour/$250,000:  ""HESOYAM""
dont use the quotes =""""""

cheats for nutter weapons.  "" UZUMYMW""

 those 2 cheats should put some money in your pockets and some weapons, ""well i dont know how he carries all those"" but he does,. lol..
you'll get the rest at the above website,.
hope this help,,  also i necer used any mounting to a disc just extract and run,."

,immagical,2011-12-20T20:13Z,"Just a quick note to anyone having laggy game play or slow motion game play,.
