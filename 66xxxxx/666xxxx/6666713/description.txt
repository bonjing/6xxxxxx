Gary Lineker introduces highlights from the Premier League. 
Champions Manchester United were at Bolton, whom they twice 
trailed in the corresponding fixture last year, while neighbours 
City hosted Wigan. Premier League newcomers Swansea travelled 
up the M4 to face Arsenal, while new Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas 
took the Blues on a long journey north to meet Sunderland. 
Everton v Aston Villa is the most-played fixture in the top flight, 
and the two met again today at Goodison Park. The remaining matches 
saw Wolves host Tottenham and Liverpool visit Stoke.
