NOTES:
This release is CLASSiFiED..............
OK here we are with a nice TS of a decent comedy.....
We were going to wait for better video before using this
super sweet LiNE but cant wait forever so here it is :D
Video used was UnKnOwN's CAM so thanks to them for that....
Cropped sharpened some changed to the RGB and YUV as well as
perspectiving it to try and hide the camera movement.....
First 30 seconds are cam audio since we didnt have that
in the LiNE. 2 samples included cut from same area, one from our TS 
and other from source cam to show difference in audio.

GREETS:
IMAGiNE, CHOiCE, REVELATiON, BDK, FLAWL3SS, DTRG, TARIQ

------------------
Uploader note: Didn't have the samples from CLASSiFiED so I made 
one. Thx CLASSiFiED !!
