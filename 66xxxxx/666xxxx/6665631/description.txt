Why is it included in this game pack Well, the Ultima seriesbreaks down into three trilogies, and it seemed a shame to break up thelovely symmetry.

The countrys benevolentmonarch is nowhere to be found, and an usurper named Lord Blackthorn hasclaimed the throne! Its your duty as the embodiment of the EightVirtues to make all wrongs right and recover the world of Britannia fromthe paws of Blackthorn and his three evil Shadowlords! Thisinstallation of the Ultima series expands on the world of Ultima 4 in anumber of ways: towns are larger, have more unique buildings, and NPCinteraction has evolved. With enhanced dialogues, diverse conversationtopics, and a diverse array of characters, Ultima V shows that LordBritish kept raising the bar for games looking to call themselves anRPG.? The day and night cycle affects the gameplay. For example youcant shop at night because the NPC shopkeepers are asleep! Delve intothe world of Britannia and save its inhabitants & moral codex!

Ultima6: The False Prophet starts out with a bang! You, the Avatar, arecaptured by demons, imprisoned, and ready to be sacrificed on an altar.Like in all those Hollywood movies, in the nick of time your friendsfrom earlier adventures come in guns a-blazing to save you! You learnthat those demon-like creatures are gargoyles, a new race that invadedBritannia and have seized the shrines of Virtue. As you venture forth onyour next adventure as the Avarat, you try to understand the truemotivations of gargoyles. As the embodiment of the Eight Virtues, theAvatar will understand that his mission is to establish peace and makethe two races coexist in Britannia peacefully. Ultima 6 is a one of akind game which, without over imposing it on the player, tells a storyof the evil of human prejudice and ignorance. This is where the motto ofOrigin Systems, We create worlds?, is best visible and it really stepsup to its name!
