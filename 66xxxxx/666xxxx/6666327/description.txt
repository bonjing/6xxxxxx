A rock-solid combination of rock-rolling action, deep strategy, and captivating art and music from different ages of history, this is a game of crush or be crushed! Two castles stand opposed; one is yours, the other is your enemyâ€™s. Theyâ€™re a jerk and their castle sucks, so youâ€™re going to try to smash it using an enormous boulder. Even as they build up their defenses, youâ€™re ready to roll over them in order to raze that unsightly tower. But beware! Thereâ€™s a giant boulder headed your way, too.
