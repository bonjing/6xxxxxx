,loongear,2011-09-11T12:15Z,could anyone confirm that it is working and not a theta release?
,BakaBaka11,2011-09-11T20:17Z,"Same size as theta and my AV treats finds the same trojan (or false positive) as in theta, so its probably theta release."
,loongear,2011-09-17T22:57Z,"I had to download and try it myself when noone commented for so long but thanks for the reply anyway.

Bottom line is, yes, it is the theta release."
