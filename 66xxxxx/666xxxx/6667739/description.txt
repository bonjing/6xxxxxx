The Story of Scotland Yard by Laurence Thompson is #16 in the Landmark series. Landmark Books (American history) and World Landmarks (world history) are accurate, in-depth stories for young people nine to fifteen years old. These living histories were written by award-winning authors or by men and women who experienced the events first-hand. Written during the 1950's and 60's and illustrated either with two-color drawings or clear photographs, the books are informative, enjoyable, and well worth collecting and reading.

This is the 1954 edition published by Random House.
