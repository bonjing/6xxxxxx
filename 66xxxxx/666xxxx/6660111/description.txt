NEW! Privacy Protection

With the touch of a button you can mark a contact as â€˜privateÃ¢Â€â„¢, meaning that no trace of them will appear in contact lists, SMSs and call logs. Other people using your mobile will only see what you want them to see.

Supports contacts from both the onboard memory and SIM cards
Password protected
Switch to Privacy Protection mode:

Manually
Automatically after a predefined period of time
Remotely by sending a special SMS to your mobile

Anti-Theft

Remotely Block your phone if it is lost or stolen. Just send a predefined SMS to your phone and your device will be blocked and no-one will be able to access its contents. You can even choose to remotely Wipe your data.
NEW! Set a prearranged message that will be displayed on the screen if the smartphone is blocked, allowing any law-abiding citizen that finds your smartphone to return it to you.
You can locate your smartphone using GPS Find. Just send an SMS with the appropriate password to the missing device and you will receive a link to Google Maps showing the exact location of the device.
The first thing a thief normally does is to remove your smartphoneÃ¢Â€â„¢s SIM card. If the SIM is replaced, SIM Watch will immediately block the device and send you an email with the new number.

Detailed Overview

Privacy Protection
Anti-Theft
Encryption
Give sensitive information on your phone an extra level of security. Choose the folders on your smartphone that you want to encrypt and password-protect. Even if the folder is located on a memory card, it cannot be accessed from another phone or computer without the correct password.
Anti-Spam
Are trivial calls or messages distracting you at inopportune moments? Choose which contacts you want to accept calls and messages from. Anti-Spam can run in whitelist mode (only accepting calls and messages from specified contacts) or in blacklist mode (accepting calls and messages from all numbers except those on the list).
Parental Control
When installed on a childÃ¢Â€â„¢s mobile, Kaspersky Mobile Security can block outgoing calls or SMSs to undesirable numbers, including premium rate services. GPS Find allows you to pinpoint exactly where your child is at any time of the day or night.
Anti-Malware Protection and Firewall
Kaspersky Mobile Security provides everything you need to keep your smartphone protected: realtime protection from malware, on-demand or scheduled antivirus scans, automatic updates over-the-air, and blocking of dangerous network connections in line with a predefined security level.
