Why would you do these as a giant 2 GB+ torrent with RAR files for ONE 1/2 hour TV episode  ?? One file is all that's needed.

That's ridiculous! So is using a group name, and since there was a TV series that ended in 1963 ""Untouchables"" is a bad choice of a name.

Instead of giving the Season # and Episode #... why not just give the episode title?

I won't even get into the too-low bit rate you used.  You probably haven't encoded a DVD before, so I hope my criticism isn't taken the wrong way."

Not one of the better episodes, but a good performance by Mickey."
