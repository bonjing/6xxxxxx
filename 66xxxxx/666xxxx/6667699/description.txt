Plot : 
Pretty tomboy Kim Matthews (Felicity Jones) used to be a champion skateboarder--but now sheÃ†s stuck in a dead end job trying to support her dad. Opportunity comes knocking in the form of a catering job in the one of the most exclusive chalets in the Alps. At first, KimÃ†s baffled by this bizarre new world of posh people, champagne and skiing--but then she discovers snowboarding, and the chance to win some much-needed prize money at the big end-of-season competition. But before she can become a champion again, KimÃ†s going to have to dig deep to overcome her fears. Hard enough, without the complicating factor of Jonny (Gossip GirlÃ†s Ed Westwick)--her handsome though spoken for boss

* What is DXVA?
 DXVA, or DirectX Video Accelleration, is a system built into Windows operating systems 
 since Windows XP that allows programs, if they support it, to offload the decoding of 
 certain media codecs to the GPU. Doing so reduces the strain on the CPU and allows for 
 even High Definition content to be played on a relatively weak system.
