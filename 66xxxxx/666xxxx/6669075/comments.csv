,psoexplorer,2011-09-12T07:38Z,"To the naysayers: If it says By: eztv and it has the little green skull, it's legit, guys...."
,comarose,2011-09-12T07:40Z,Perfect...Thanks again! 
,mikeFBA,2011-09-12T07:42Z,"EZTV torrents are always real.

How do you think they got the green VIP skull?

It amazes me how many people use this site and have no clue what is going on. They have no idea what the skulls mean or come here and download TV programs that haven't even aired yet. 

Thank you again, EZTV. Always worth the wait. "
,patti360,2011-09-12T07:42Z,"Yes. Ive been waiting for this for hours.

This is legit. It's EZTV. :)"

,NightWrath,2011-09-12T07:59Z,"damn how long it took to get it online, only been finding fakes all fkn night there arent just enough guys like u eztv u rock......"
,spockbot,2011-09-12T08:03Z,"That was crazy how many fake true blood torrents were on this site today. They have to make a way to ban LOL from uploading. He/she/it actually has 6 fakes with bogus comments. Thank you EZTV and Fuck LOL, I hope you choke while sucking you dead mothers nipples. Psyco bitch. Get a life and keep away from TRUE BLOOD fans!!!"
,mikeFBA,2011-09-12T08:12Z,"I hate to say it, but this is a poor quality rip. The video is extremely dark. 

I guess I'll have to wait some more until EXTV gives us a PROPER. :("
,mikeFBA,2011-09-12T08:14Z,"Actually, it's not LOLs fault that people are using their name on fake releases. There were a couple of fakes posted today that claimed to be EZTV rips, too. 

Look for the skulls, people. "
,LostNky78,2011-09-12T08:14Z,Thanks Eztv!
,mikeFBA,2011-09-12T08:15Z,Very surprised by how poor this rip is. 
,lincolnmq,2011-09-12T08:16Z,"Finally, a REAL copy. 

Great quality. Thanks!"
,saseko4saseko,2011-09-12T08:18Z,"I may not be the all important original uploader, but I am one of the many important seeders. People should just be more like me, and upload to a nice ratio. I generally go with 5.000 or higher, but some take too long and i stop at 3. With files like this, it takes like a day or 2 of time uploading to get to 5.0, many times I have gotten it in just a couple hours. People help out more with the general seeding, and all shall be better."
,mikeFBA,2011-09-12T08:21Z,"Great rips from EZTV all season, and now that it's the season finale we get one with very dark video that is almost unwatchable. So sad. :("
,controlledinsanity,2011-09-12T08:31Z,PLS SEED!!!

,PirateWayne,2011-09-13T16:06Z,"Voice sound track did not play correctly -- can't hear the talking.  Tried Windows Media Player w/ codecs and VLC Media Player.  No luck.

Judging from quality score (Was +15 / -10 last night, now +15 / -19) this is a very rare dud from EZTV.

I don't know where the first 2 pages of ""great job"" came from.  They either have a different player that works, or didn't bother trying to watch first. "
,Sarsparilla15,2011-09-13T17:29Z,Thank you for this season:) Very much appreciated!

,Kigre,2011-09-22T07:08Z,"I stopped watching True Blood during this episode. Shit got retarded by the episode. Was a torture just to get to this one. But now i've had enough. It has now just gotten to the point of being funny!? Reason i started watching true blood was cause there are lack of good shows these days. At least for the moment. But this show is for sucidial, extremely disdurbed female teens. I get that now."
,PurityDeath,2011-09-25T19:10Z,"@Kigre

This show has never really been amazing. It's never been the forefront of great storytelling or anything. The Maenad arc of season 2 was stupid as hell.

All in all it's always been fun to watch though and if you lose track of what's fun about something then you shouldn't watch it. :)

Also yes, half of what's good about it is the comedy. Fantasy/Sci-Fi Dramedys like Buffy and Farscape make up the best things to ever grace TV. You don't have to take yourself too seriously to be great. You can just have fun with it and enjoy it."
