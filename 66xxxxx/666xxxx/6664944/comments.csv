,gleep,2011-09-10T11:57Z,"SEEDING at about 80k/s now. Get your downloads happening now. This is an amazing film. Brutally real. I've been in these houses, and it is almost exactly the true situation. This is a very real story about addiction recovery."
,gleep,2011-09-13T09:15Z,"I made a YouTube video of the opening sequence. It gives a good intro. I is mostly dark, but the movie has a lot of fun and laughs, as well as plenty of hope.

Go to youtube an search for ""Opening Sequence - Never Get Outta The Boat"" uploaded by gleeper. If you like the intro on youtube you will like the movie."
,StankyLefthand,2011-10-02T04:11Z,"I am trying to download this now. If it takes me a month to get this movie, so be it. I've searched for it before with no luck so I thank you, so much, so so so much, for uploading this. I'm in recovery and my counselor was talking about us watching a movie and most movies I suggested she didn't want us to see so I've been wanting to see this and let her know about it. Again, thank you for the upload, gleep. If I like it, which I'm sure I will judging by the trailer, this will remain on my comp for awhile so I'll be seeding for awhile."
