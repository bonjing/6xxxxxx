ReleaseNotes:

If you were challenged to name five rock albums that epitomized the '70s, Frampton Comes Alive! should probably top the list. Former Humble Pie guitarist Peter Frampton recorded a few perfectly fine albums with his band Frampton's Camel, but it wasn't until some of those tracks were recorded at a live performance in San Francisco and released as Frampton Comes Alive! that he became a household name. Buoyant pop, sentimental ballads, arena rock--this album has it all. The double-LP package set sales records and contained three bona fide radio hits--"Baby, I Love Your Way," "Show Me the Way," and "Do You Feel Like We Do?" This 25th-anniversary remastered package features three previously unreleased tracks from the source shows, plus an additional selection recorded at the time as a radio promo. --Lorry
