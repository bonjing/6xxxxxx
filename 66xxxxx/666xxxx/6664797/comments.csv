This is where I got mine from and it works well on OSX Lion; just in case this ever stops seeding."

,RobotA34,2011-12-16T08:15Z,"Nope, icon just keeps bouncing. When you click it, it disappears."
,Oscie,2011-12-21T01:06Z,"Does work, but you need to open terminal and do:
chmod 700 /Applications/Plants\ vs.\ Zombies.app/Contents/MacOS/Plants\ vs.\ Zombies 
(or whereever you have it stored)

If you cant work it out, google ""chmode mac execute"" or something..."
,alenric,2012-01-30T23:32Z,"it is working on lion. just follow Oscie's instruction.

1. download this game
2. put the Plants vs. Zombies icon at the application folder
3. open terminal
4. paste the following words

chmod 700 /Applications/Plants\ vs.\ Zombies.app/Contents/MacOS/Plants\ vs.\ Zombies"

,lauregasm,2012-03-26T21:05Z,"That chmod execute thing didn't work for me but I

right-clicked on the Plants vs Zombies app, clicked on Show Package Contents > Contents > Mac OS > Double-click on the PVZ Unix Executable File.

That did it for me :)
Thanks again for the upload!"
