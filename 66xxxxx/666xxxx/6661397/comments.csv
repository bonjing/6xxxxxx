,tbones187,2011-09-08T22:54Z,"dude I'm too old to give a fuck about some post from a online cocksucker such as yourself. I screwed up the rar file so reseeded cuz i don't start seeds very often.

Guilty of fukin up a Rar = Yes
Guilty of being a wuss = No

Bitch please, shut up and go enjoy yourself.
Someone get this nigga a lap dance or some weed.

,tbones187,2011-09-08T22:55Z,"You have to run smart steam first. 

It works fine.

People are so helpless these days. My god"

,CoreyKoehn,2011-09-08T23:35Z,"Patch 1.1.0 if you follow the directions in the description it works perfectly, thanks tbones ^^"
,TheAC30fSpades,2011-09-08T23:52Z,"Once I get the actually game running I'll be able to find out for myself, but for now are you able to play with co-op online?  Or the only way to is with LAN?  I appreciate the upload, and I agree with the lap dance and weed part, both of those at the same time would be nice right now."
,diogosousa,2011-09-09T01:05Z,how fix sound!!??
,Dragday,2011-09-09T01:36Z,"he has just 2 torrents that are from dead island, and he spammed in every dead island torrent.
Am i the only one that think it is suspicious?"

,sansyeux,2011-09-09T02:33Z,"okay, I didn't lost anything, I re-applied the previous files I had and my progress is still there. I checked the lobby on this version and it was empty.so it's hard to tell if it's working or not."
,sansyeux,2011-09-09T02:38Z,"then it makes , duih , this is only coop lan, sorry mate. i'm a n00b with online games on PC , i always play single player. how do I write texts on the game? I only have an integrated mic on my pc, no likey."

,Dreoh,2011-09-09T06:14Z,"How do I use old saves? 

I put my back-upped saves back into the out folder but it doesn't register they are there

And when I started a new game, saved, then exited and copied over my back-upped old saves again, it didn't register they were there but instead showed my new save. So is there somewhere new I have to put my old saves?"
,The4X3R,2011-09-09T07:36Z,"looks like incomaptible with update 1 saves...
or maybee it stores them somwhere else"
,Rovlad84,2011-09-09T10:01Z,"FOR THOSE WHO JUST WANT 1.1.0 PATCH AND DON'T CARE ABOUT MULTIPLAYER:

Do not overwrite steam_api.dll, do not install / run steam. Game works perfectly fine."
,Rovlad84,2011-09-09T10:01Z,Oh and old saves work if using method above.

,reisalomao,2011-09-09T16:52Z,"Hi my friend! Thanks for the torrent!
Works great!
But i need a help. When i play singleplayer, if i must quit the game to go to work, when i need to load, all map get reseted. All itens on map bring back again, chests, energy drinks, all things. why this happen?"

,hexrei,2011-09-09T19:37Z,"@reisalomao 
That's just how the game works. You'll find that all that stuff happens even when you're playing the game and you go too far from a particular area. "
,Dragday,2011-09-09T22:10Z,"I downloaded and it now says version 1.1.0

but here are some Con
you need to have steam/smartsteam
you lost your save from 1.0

Pros
works
you can play single player without steam by just keeping the old steam_api.dll

,Toubib11,2011-09-09T22:35Z,"alright guys I'm not quite sure how it works cause I've tried several things. So first of all I have put all the smartsteam files inside my steam folder then I put the downloaded game inside steammaps/common/dead island.  
after that I put this update and evetything in the file I run smartsteam it opens steam which I guess is what it does then I click deadislandgame.exe  The game starts but the thing is I'm trying to play co-op lan but the game lobby is grey I can't even click on it. I'm not quite sure what I am suppose to do now"
,Zeptinune,2011-09-09T23:03Z,"Guys please define 'works'?

I copied this over my 'RELOADED' copy of the game. Downloaded steam, made a new account. Logged in, ran steam. Ran the game.

Confirmed that version is 1.1.0

Checked 'Online options' set it to LAN, Co-op mode and public slots 3.

Made a new character... (for the 15th time)
Finished the prologue. Saved Sinamoi and

I STILL FUCKING CANT GET INTO THE GAME LOBBY!! It's still fucking greyed out!

On top of that, my fucking save data after I got the checkpoint for saving Sinamoi is gone.. so it was like I didn't even do anything.

What the hell?

So please define for me what you all consider 'working' because I've tried everything and I still can't even get into the game lobby. Are you guys using Hamachi and are trying to get into a co-op game with friends? Because that is what I am trying to do..."
,Toubib11,2011-09-09T23:21Z,well yeah I'm using Hamachi I was able to get in the game lobby but the strange thing is my friend could see me in the game lobby and not me and we could not play co-op because of that did it ever happened to someone here
,marcusrc,2011-09-09T23:27Z,"This doesn't work. As others have said, the option for game lobby is greyed out.
And yes, I've set the options to lan and got to Act I, funny how hes also uploaded it twice -_-"
,SweaterCollection,2011-09-09T23:42Z,"Both me and my friend on an actual LAN are having the exact same issue as Zeptinune. We followed the instructions as per the install notes, to a T. We cannot access the lobby under any circumstances."
,Dragday,2011-09-10T00:35Z,"i thought everythink was fine, but badnews
the save doesnt work , the realoaded update 1 was working fine.
and i didnt see any difference unless the lobby menu saying 1.1 ,  maybe he just found a way to change 1.0 to 1.1"
,saequa253,2011-09-10T03:35Z,Can anyone tell me why my system keeps crashing when I play this game?  This only happens with burnt games
,tassadarnzl,2011-09-10T03:51Z,"dont download this guys  it dont work  no co-op at all , i tryed all crap they say to do,it still dont work"
,call_me_nobody,2011-09-12T22:47Z,"thanks jackass, now the game says that i must logon to steam to continue..."

,Jay91,2011-09-16T20:47Z,"A good cracker knows how to get past this without needing a pirated steam, this is bad and will waste your time defintly."
,Diodelmare,2011-09-17T02:29Z,I'm trying to play this with my friend who bought Dead Island...can anyone help? :)
,Xandror,2012-04-27T18:20Z,"Let me save you hours of frustration if you are trying to play this on a LAN. First off, this is an old version so its useless. However the torrent contains a working copy of Smartsteam. Google ""Dead Island Master Update 1.3.0 v3!!! DLC BLOODBATH REPACKED 7 patch into one+exp balance+COOP!! "" to find the real working patch for the original reloaded release of the game. Once that is patched follow these steps.

1. Install Steam. 
2. Create a fake steam account for each player on the lan. 
3. Winrar smartsteam from this torrent into the steam directory.
4. run smartsteam from each computer.
5. run Dead island.
6. Start a game, switch online option from internet to LAN.
7. Have each player start a game and use the Game Lobby option to find your game. They must have completed the tutorial and be on at least Act 1 to do this.

hope this helps."
