After the death of her father, sexy Honey West took over his
high-tech private detective firm.

As tv's first title-role female Private Eye, Honey West would
take on any tough case. She could handle herself mingling with
millionaires just as well as scaling a thirty foot wall.

Along with rugged Sam Bolt and her pet ocelot Bruce, Honey West
was sure to solve the case.

This short-lived series made television history by casting Anne
Francis as the first-ever woman lead private eye.
