We will, of course, continue with NAVIGATORZ indie playlist each month,...Hope you like them, your comments are, of course, welcome!

Anyone who is interested in sending your own stuff (via links to downloads), we would gladly listen to your music and include it in our list or radio show if we find it good, so more people would hear it...

As always, our own radio show is on the internet radio station http://radio.elektrana.net/ , every Tuesday 7pm CET. There you will be able to hear some new stuff before we upload it on the net.This month artwork is from Mia Matovic.
