Release Notes....: It looks like this aired on Channel 4 in .au and on History Channel in .us. I believe this is the same
                   show as "Bin Laden: Shoot to Kill" released by C4TV from PDTV source, only the History Channel version 
                   has an extra 12mins of footage and is from HDTV source. 

Description......: Featuring exclusive interviews with President Barack Obama and other senior aides, this two-hour special 
                   event will take viewers inside the dedicated effort to hunt and kill Osama Bin Laden. We'll also examine 
                   the historical ramifications for President Obama's administration, as well as look at the role of the 
                   men and women who worked for many years over several administrations to make this possible. Rigorously 
                   researched, Targeting Bin Laden uses historical footage, photographs and dramatic re-enactments to 
                   illustrate one of the most important missions in our nation's history. In addition to President Obama, 
                   interviewees include National Security Advisor, Tom Donilon; White House Chief Counter-Terrorism 
                   Advisor, John O. Brennan; Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications; 
                   former CIA Director, Gen. Michael Vincent Hayden; former CIA Deputy Director of Counter-Terrorism, 
                   Philip Mudd; members of Congress; policy experts and others.
