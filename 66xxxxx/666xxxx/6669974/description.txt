Entourage is an American comedy-drama television series that premiered on HBO on July 18, 2004 and is now in syndication around the world. The series was created and is largely written by Doug Ellin and chronicles the acting career of Vincent Chase, a young A-list movie star, and his childhood friends from Queens, New York City, as they navigate the unfamiliar terrain of Los Angeles, California.

Mark Wahlberg and Stephen Levinson serve as the show\'s executive producers, and its premise is loosely based on Wahlberg\'s experiences as an up-and-coming film star.

In this sitcom, the suddenly risen film star Vince Chase, a\'jeune premier\' of humble origins, learns the ropes of the business and the the high-profile world of the wealthy happy few in and around Hollywood, but not alone: he brings from his native New York his atypical \'entourage (hence the title), not glitterati or professionals but a close circle of friends since childhood, and his professional agent finds they often make his job harder as the Queens boys not only sponge on the star but also have his ear, so Vince is much harder to counsel. Vince chooses his friend from home Eric as his manager, and LA professional Ari Gold as his agent. Over the course of the Series, they progress from Brooklynites, to actors, to producers and chase the funding and support to try to make the perfect movie for Vincent.
