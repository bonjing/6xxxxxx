This torrent is a redistribution of this one: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6100649/Chicago_Hope_-_season_1-6
...but it has been \\\\\\\"fixed\\\\\\\", meaning that it now includes the missing episode, S05E12 - Adventures in Babysitting, and the incorrect episode S01E17 GROWING PAINS (which actually was S03E18) has been replaced with the correct one, being S01E17 GROWTH PAINS. You can see the complaints about this in the other torrent. I just get a bit OCD and feel like it would be nice if a proper all-episode version of this torrent came up. 

Enjoy!
