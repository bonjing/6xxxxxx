        Ghost from the Machine

        After his  parents are  killed in  car accident,  Cody is left
        dealing with  enormous guilt,  caring for  his younger brother
        and the persistent thought of how to bring his parents back to
        life. Cody knows he is not the first person to have this  idea
        or the  first to  have attempted  to carry  it through.  After
        several attempts with  his electromagnetic device,  he becomes
        the first to breach the wall between the living and the  dead.
        But where is the line between life and death? And who actually
        comes back? What  ghosts come out  of the machine?  "Phasma Ex
        Machina" is a sci-fi film that combines both heart and mystery
        with electronic veins and sheet metal.
