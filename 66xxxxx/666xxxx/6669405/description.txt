After a scandalous premier, actress Leila Manner (Elina KnihtiÃ¤) flees the reporters to the familyâ€™s old summer villa with her two sons. Short-tempered Ilmari (Samuli NiittymÃ¤ki) is his motherâ€™s confidant and protector, whereas his younger brother Unto (Eetu Julin) is an insect enthusiast and a loner.

Their peaceful time together is soon interrupted when Leila invites a group of her friends over to spend the weekend. Joining the others is author Aimo (Eero Aho) whom Leila falls for, despite trying to resist. At the same time, the weird waitress Karita (Anna Paavilainen) at the local pub approaches Ilmari telling him that she saw his arrival in a dream.

When the other guests leave, Aimo stays. Ilmari is not pleased with the intruder, although Leila assures him that Aimo is nothing like her previous men. Gradually, Aimo starts to have enough of the youngsterâ€™s insolence. Ilmari tries to escape the situation in the company of the fascinating Karita, and Leila, who is in love, turns a blind eye. The atmosphere at the villa surrounded by woods becomes threatening.
