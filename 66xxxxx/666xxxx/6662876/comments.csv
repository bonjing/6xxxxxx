,aarque,2011-09-09T18:32Z,"All freeware not appropriate for Pirate Bay. Additionally this stuff has been spammed here in almost identical form many times. Besides your own history of uploading freeware to a Pirate site there are numerous torrents like this one:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4639092/FSX_Aircraft_Package_01-2009

Why should people learn to use the search feature when unscrupulous users constantly regurgitate free stuff already available elsewhere. You should stick to the torrents you are good at like Extreme Anal Starlets.S

,Viper_Zero_One,2012-01-11T07:41Z,"Downloaded, extracted with password, installed properly (it had the wrong friggin folder names), won't even show the aircraft in-game.  Are these even for FSX??  Now I have to go through my aircraft folders and manually delete all this crap.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!"
,Viper_Zero_One,2012-01-11T07:50Z,"In addition, there are multiple shortcuts to websites in the rar file that install Spyware onto your computer.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!  I've reported the user to TPB, hopefully they nail him to the wall."
