,Sonnybrimon,2011-09-13T01:39Z,"Fix works but it has a conflict with Yellow Tools Instruments,it says  YT acoustic piano xao1...and so on....it cannot find the piano instrument.."
,Sonnybrimon,2011-09-13T06:39Z,"I got it working without the fix.Here is what I did to make this work.
1.Install it as trial and use the fix to make it full version.

2. You have afull version now but there is a problem with YT- acoustic piano,no problem.

3. Download the Free instrument and sound packet from magix website.( Open program, at start up click download free synthesizer and sound packets.)

4.After the installation of sound packet and synthesizer,close the program.

5.Now go to the installation folder of sound packet and synthesizer,it's Computer/program data/magix/magix music mx premium download.( IF YOU CANNOT FIND THE PROGRAM DATA FOLDER,GO TO CONTROL PANEL/FOLDER OPTION, CLICK VIEW AND TICK THE"" Show hidden file and folder)

6.COPY THE MAGIX MUSIC MAKER MX PREMIUM DOWNLOAD FOLDER TO YOUR DESKTOP (PROGRAM DATA/MAGIX/MAGIX MUSIC MAKER MX PREMIUM DOWNLOAD)

7.Uninstall MMM MX.Install it again,DO NOT USE THE FIX TO ACTIVATE THE PROGRAM.

8.YOU MUST HAVE A INTERNET CONNECTION AND CLICK ON EXTEND TRIAL FOR 30 DAYS UPON OPENING THE MMM MX.LOG IN TO MAGIX IN ORDER TO GET THE TRIAL CODE,IF YOU DONT HAVE AN ACCOUNT,CREATE IT.PASTE THE TRIAL CODE TO THE ACTIVATION WINDOW.

9. Now copy the folder that you save to Program data/ Magix/

10.Replace the existing folder (Magix Music Maker MX Premium Download Version)...you're done

11.The only thing that is not activated is the Mp3 encoder,i'm still working on it.

12. Hope this help you..."

[T],trialanderror,2011-09-29T17:22Z,"@Sonnybrimon:
The procedure you described didn't work for me. Still the same error with Vita. I think I'll go back to v17 until there is something that works. I also don't like the fact that they removed the Jazz Drums and Saxophone synths."
,Sonnybrimon,2011-10-04T05:23Z,"@trialanderror

Sorry to hear that man...but it works for me...maybe you missed something..did you have the complete sound packets and instruments? did you use the Fix activation after you uninstall the MMM? "
,swexpert,2011-10-19T17:15Z,"For all those who are saying the fix does not work, i would like to tell you that the coder is a bit inexperienced as he has put fixed path in the patcher. In simple words, the patcher won't work for those who install in folder other than C:\program files\mag...

So to make it work, install and then copy the Magix folder to your %Program files% folder. copy the patcher into that folder and run it. It will do what it is supposed to do.

Then copy the folder from %program files% to the original location. 

Enjoy!

Thanks uploader, patcher and developers!

,iWitchfinder,2012-01-24T22:11Z,swexpert hit the nail on the head. That is exactly where the fix problem lies. Heed swexpert's words.
