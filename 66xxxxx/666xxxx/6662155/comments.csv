[T],trialNerror,2011-09-23T04:57Z,"According to SOME episode guides this could be episode E05 if you were to count the pilot episode which aired at the end of 2010 as E01.  I don't, though. Science Channels website doesn't, either.

To avoid any kind of confusion like that it'd be better if the episode title was in the file name - like I have been doing.

I will be releasing E05 (Dirt Boat) and E06 (Really Freaking Fast Food) in a little bit. "
