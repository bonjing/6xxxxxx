Woodworkers interested in wood-burning will build their skill level through these three step-by-step projects for beginner, intermediate, and advanced burners. They will learn how to prepare wood surfaces before burning, how to transfer a design or pattern, and how to select materials for burning, colouring, and finishing a project. Methods for burning onto wood, leather, paper, bark, and antlers are detailed alongside ample pictures of pyrography on the various materials that will inspire novice wood-burners. Numerous techniques are also discussed, including solar, negative, relief, engraving, torch, and hot wire. The most difficult area for burners - how to realistically create animal fur, feathers, and eyes - is addressed.
