No, I haven't finished downloading it, but even a partially downloaded video can be partially watched.
Audio is a bit low, as always for Doctor Who releases I've found, but it is fine.
A: 8/10 V: 9/10
+1, and a comment for the truth of this being a good release.
Hope you get to the top of the list for seeders for this episode, mate."
,ncc46537,2011-09-10T22:23Z,"As for speed...
It'll pick up once a few people have downloaded.
That's why it's called a Peer to Peer service.
Seed at a worthwhile speed, even if you aren't getting one.
7.30717185kbps at 18 seeders at 300kbps, with 739 leechers.
10kbps, is faster than the average."
,steffijenkins,2011-09-10T22:25Z,Come on people make with the seeding!
