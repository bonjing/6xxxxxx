A long-forgotten bootleg recording from an intimate coffee-house fundraiser for Amnesty International, this album showcases Winnipeg folk rocker Greg MacPherson and John K. Samson of the Weakerthans at their most raw and relaxed. Alternating between lead and backup, the two captivate with stripped-down versions of memorable tunes from their then-early careers, displaying endearing humility and respect for each others' music and a brotherly camaraderie. This is rock and roll at its most bare-bones authentic level.


Recorded live at W.C. Miller Collegiate in the winter of 2000-2001.

Remastered for volume and content by Garrett Everett in 2011.
