,Phatfish,2011-09-10T03:00Z,"Oh wow. Just watched about 30 mins of it...
What a mess. Obviously I can't prove or disprove on any specific detailed facts given but they spit out 10000 theories a second in a way like it was undisputed objective facts. I think that's what's called propaganda yeeez..."
,DieDaily,2011-09-10T12:27Z,"Wow the non-stop absurdities and lies in this film come even faster and more furiously than they did in ""5 Days of War"". And I didn't even think that was possible. What a giant load of steaming, Orwellian, BS."

,Reedy44,2011-10-22T14:24Z,"personally i believe its true, why would america including their president make a documentary about this which could in future be proved as a lie ? it would ruin them and also make people think they never went to the moon."
