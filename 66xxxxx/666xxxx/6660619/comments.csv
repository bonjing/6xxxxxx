Strange tho how you uploaded POTC 2 weeks after this yet that one uploaded fully so much quicker.
Tip for future (as you said this is your first torrent):
For uploaders with a LARGE torrent and a SLOW uplaod speed:
a) Make your block size a lot smaller. At most make it 1MB. 256K will help you uplaod this so much faster. Sure there will be some little extra overhead but you will be able to get each piece fully uploaded to a leecher quicker which then can be shared out by that leecher while you upload another piece. You will be able to get 32 seperate 256K blocks out in the time you get 1 x 8MB block out. The problem is with such a large file and slow upload, you get hundreds of leechers, and your torrent program will revolve between leechers to seed to. With network interuptions (you're most likely downloading other files which uses upload bandwith, etc, etc) - you will be getting many many partial blocks uploaded to individuals of between 0.1 and 7.9MB which then drop out or lose your direct connection to them, and they can not share that 7.9MB of data and so you connect to someone else and start that block over from 0. So smaller block sizes means a lot less wastage.
b) (And you can implement this now) - connect only to a few peers at once.
Do both: reduce ""Maximum number of peers connected per torrent"" from 50 to about 10-20; and reduce ""Number of upload slots per torrent"" from 10 to 3-4.
Reason - similar to (a) - reducing peers connected per torrent means less peers you are revolving around so less ""lost"" parital pieces, and less upload slots per torrent means you get full whole blocks out quicker and more reliably which that person can then share out very quickly. ie. If you have for example 20kB upload for Rio and you are connected to 10 peers at once, you will be averaging 2kB per peer, needing well over 1 hour of uninterupted connection to each of those peers to get a full 8MB block uploaded before they can then share it out. Connect to 3 peers only and you're getting 7kB per peer needing only 20mins reliable conenction per peer.

Hope that helps :)

and thanks for getting the Rio 3D edition up here. I can't wait for it to finish.
Cheers!"

,KillMind,2011-10-18T18:59Z,"@jobmobrien : That was a great Comment.... really appreciated it... thanks a lot !!!
Due to severe rains my internet connection was lost... sorry for that. But  it resumed now... so just a matter of time. THANKS !!!"
,jonmobrien,2011-10-20T19:11Z,"@matterp - who says he cannot seed the torrent? He just can't upload as fast as some other uploaders can. Why would he upload this? Because no-one else in the whole world has uploaded Rio-3D at all, and at last count there are OVER 700 people downloading this from KillMind - SO FAR. I expect there will be many thousands of HAPPY THANKFUL leechers pulling this down in the next few months.

@matterp - there is only one ash hole in this comments section. Can you guess who it is? Here's a hint: it is not KillMind. 700+ people agree. If you watcfh the sample file you'll see it is a brilliant quality rip, and yet in a manageable "
