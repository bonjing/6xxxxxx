is all your WEB-DL releases are better than standart 720p? Even if the size of 720p is bigger than WEB-DL release?

Thank you."

Comparing 720p HDTV rip (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6489802) to this WEB-DL rip -> I downloaded both and HDTV has a little better picture quality, but WEB-DL video is more fluent. I chose WEB-DL, because slight lagging of HDTV was annoying to me."
