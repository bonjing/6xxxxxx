 tnx extreme i do appreciate "
,ForeverAUltraz,2011-09-11T02:49Z,"Quality of the movie (both Audio and Video) is fine on VLC.

But the movie in it self is not that great. 
If done proberly this could have been a good movie, but lacks complete action, which is nonexistent and actors are acting bad... Offcourse its all about movie task, and my wide is kinda big, but this movie is not worth the time.. watch and see if u agree :)"
,golpster,2011-09-11T06:56Z,thanks guys
,SuperWurm,2011-09-11T16:10Z,"a and V is good, but the movie is one out of a dozen. Everything in the movie has been done a thousant times before. Nothing is original about it.
I think the movie is made because rapper 50 cents wanted to be an actor and so they wrote a story around his personality. So if you like to see the white teeth of 50 cents than this is your movie."
,ProudFather,2011-09-12T03:14Z,"It might be hard to come up with a original movie idea never used,Since there has been so many movies made through the years,Not often do i come across a movie with a original story never used.Some of the best movies i have seen have already been used numerous times,Or even remade.I am going to download it because it sounds like a decent movie,And in my many years of downloading movies,I have found most of good movies i have watched,There are always people making comments on what a bad movie they think it was..lol."

The kid acts like he makes movies and this particular one impacted his life in a very serious way, but obviously thats not true. For someone to absolutely lose their shit over something as meaningless as a movie that nobody likes is pretty insane. Hopefully his mommy and daddy have realized he's off his meds again and have sedated him by now. Anyways, THANKS for the upload!!! You are always on point extreme!!!

Watch those instead if you haven't."

,flegmatic,2011-09-22T21:37Z,"ATTENTION!!!!

I rarely comment in Bay, but this time i just feel obligated to...

This is a B class movie.

Oh, Bruce Willis, what have you done?!?
Never seen Bruce participating in anything low quality before. This movie forced him to overdo on acting and reacting like some amateur.

Movie tries to hold on to Guy Riccie (Snatch, Lock Stock and Two smoking barrels) style which i personally found just insulting due to how horrifyingly distasteful and inappropriately it has been performed.

Movie is produced by 50 cent (obviously). Poor guy can't get into any A class movies, so he buys a script that was thrown away by all of the biggest film producers and studios and produces it himself just to appear on a screen.

Only good thing this movie has is Ryan Phillipe. Guy is very talented and took the role seriously. Instead of Bruce Willis who casts an impression that he already knows that movie is going to suck ass and seems to have a sarcastic attitude towards it with a face expression:
""Hey, 50 just paid me 10 mil just to drop four lines here and appear in credits!""

In summary, not only this B class movie is bad even for B class, but it made me so angry that i just had to warn every self respecting cinematography appreciator that this is predictable crap, with crappy acting, insufficient budget, no film director (or one that is forced to work a certain way) and no script. Atleast no script with actual story in it besides making 50 cent look bad ass and Ryan Phillipe saying: ""He's a hothead! He will come to a front door...""

Painful to watch...

P.S. Torrent it self is ok though. Would not expect anything else from EZ."
,str8pirate,2011-09-23T13:02Z,yea 50 is not good in acting man he needs to stick to music what a joke..... A/10 V/10 M/ sorry guys 50 just ruined this flick man...
