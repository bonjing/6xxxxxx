,suncitygirls,2011-09-10T23:27Z,If this is the real 20th anniversary remaster they botched the hell out of it.
,weedfactory,2011-09-13T11:47Z,"This is a homemade remaster with mixed up artwork from different pressings and a cheap font/writing added, not worth the download
It has nothing to do with the forthcoming Nevermind 2011 releases !"
,logan-xart,2011-09-20T08:14Z,this is bullshit...not the 20 year release...
,GearCloud,2011-09-20T13:31Z,"@320hunter 
Which Software do you Use to remaster songs?"
,RazzBot,2011-09-21T06:22Z,"@GearCloud You can't remaster an album if you don't have access to the masters

This is not a ""remaster"", it's a piece of sh*t."
,zoso5150,2011-09-27T11:14Z,"To all you amoebas!! Stop slagging 320 off,this guy is responsible for some really good uploads,so if you are so clever put it up yourselves,and keep your pathetic comments for facebook!!!! "
,320hunter,2011-09-28T14:54Z,"@zoso5150 Thanks! But eegative criticism is just fine, then I know that I have moved into their head that I'm good: D 

@ GearCloud Magix Music Maker try this if you want :)"
