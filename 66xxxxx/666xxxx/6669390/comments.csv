,surenlokka,2011-09-12T10:42Z,If you can please upload TNA shows in small size........like 300-500mb mkv or mp4 format...Because I can't find it anywhere......Thanks for your good work
,DarthExile,2011-09-12T19:03Z,can you please upload avi files that can be streamed    wtf
,DarthExile,2011-09-12T19:06Z,mkv files are only good if your gonna burn a huge dvd with every ppv on it. it would be cool if someone made a mkv file with RAW SD and TNA impact all in one file otherwise mkv files are fucking worthless 
,guy_wild,2011-09-12T23:59Z,"Darth...  _you_ are a worthless noob with your constant whining about not being able to stream Matroska files.

Get real, get informed or get out."
,guy_wild,2011-09-13T00:02Z,"...and LOL ...it's not even mkv, just plain ol' mp4.

Sorta makes you even more noobish, no?"
[T],Maverick2587,2011-09-26T20:24Z,THX 4 upload!
