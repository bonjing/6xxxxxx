,BigLilSteve,2011-09-13T02:29Z,"It's been released in Turkey.

Just like we had a dvdrip of Taken before it even came out in theaters here in the US."
,dirtygrundies,2011-09-13T23:15Z,.BONE. NEVER releases fake sh!t.  The best to do it.  In my opinion.
,Animeman1000,2011-09-22T23:46Z,"@hsr4movie Do you enjoy turning a good thing into shit. I've seen you make the same comment on 4 different Torrents. I guess you've never heard of foreign countries releasing shit before we do in most cases. Well this could be one of them. So that would mean we wouldn't have the screenshot unless they released it here. Notice how you keep putting I think it's fake. Well download it and see for yourself. I know for a fact you haven't downloaded any of the version of this movie where you've commented on. SO shut the fuck up, download it and see for yourself before being stupid."
,chair_tard,2011-09-26T11:01Z,".BONE your releases are usually top notch. 
This one contains a public atom... just a warning to QuickTime users... this will not work. Use VLC. No way to get this rip to iDevice without transcoding (usually, one can bypass this step, just re-rip the audio). Thanks anyway... going with YIFY's release. Using Subler to rewrap the mkv in mp4, no transcode necessary. "
