Inspired by a friendâ€™s mastiff that would imitate its masterâ€™s morning yoga routine, photographer Daniel Borris created Yoga Dogs, a full-color collection of 45 different dogs and puppies doing human yoga poses. Donâ€™t worry: No animals were harmed during the making of the images; instead, their extreme flexibility can be chalked up to some very effective digital trickery. The results are silly and curious all at once, and the inherently humorous pictures are complemented by information about the poses and some funny and punny canine meditations.
