Panthro and Tygra try to rig the Book of Omens to the Thunder Tank. When in a nearby town getting supplies, Lion-O has an encounter with a Drifter who warns him to stay away from the town. Lion-O learns that the town doesn't accept Thunderian currency after what happened to Thundera. Lion-O enters a sword competition for the right currencies of the money and wins by slicing the stone block in half with the Sword of Omens. Lion-O soon ends up challenged by the Duelist (a professional swordsman who collects the swords of the opponents he has defeated) in a sword match where he loses the Sword of Omens to him. The Drifter reveals that the Sword of Hittanzo is the Duelist's best sword (which he claimed from it's sword-maker) and learns that the Drifter was the Sword of Hittanzo's maker and he warns Lion-O that no one can beat the Sword of Hittanzo. When it comes to the sword match, the Duelist manages to overcome Lion-O and claim the Sword of Omens. Afterwards, Lion-O ends up gaining the unlikely assistance of the Drifter to make another sword. Once the sword is forged, Lion-O seeks out the Duelist at a nearby tavern and challenges him to 
a rematch for all of Duelist's swords with Duelist wanting Lion-O to put up his life as well. During the sword match, Lion-O does his best to evade the Duelist's attacks until the Duelist breaks the sword. Upon following the Drifter's "willows are weak" philosophy. Lion-O uses this wisdom to disarm Duelist of his swords. Drifter says that he has what he needed to win in himself. When Duelist tries to attack Lion-O, the Drifter manages to successfully knock down the Duelist and send him out of town. Before going their separate ways, Drifter tells Lion-O that he will return the swords to their rightful owners. Lion-O reunites with Panthro and Tygra who wondered what took him so long.
