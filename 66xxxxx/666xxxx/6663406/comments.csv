,dinofdo,2011-09-10T11:39Z,your doing a great job with the quality of movies but it would be much better if you could reduce the size of it
,elmac101,2011-09-10T21:12Z,Worked nicely on my ps3
,gotmycoke,2011-09-10T23:57Z,"Hey this is my first movie torrent, and the video is great quality but there's no audio at all. Please give me any suggestions."
,reavercraft,2011-09-11T04:51Z,"gotmycoke, try downloading VLC player, its free google search it"
,Virtualgoose,2011-09-11T08:01Z,"Registered just to say this: I love you for including a Non-English only subtitles file. I've DL'd too many movies that include only all English, or none at all. I'd have to search all over the internet for a suitable file, and a match is rare at best. So thank you, and keep up the good work!"
,username_x,2011-09-12T03:05Z,There is no audio track.
[T],MitZep,2011-09-12T04:11Z,@username yes there is!! You must not have the right codecs...
,sandipraj,2011-09-13T23:28Z,"SIgned up just to post a comment. many thnaks for the nice encoding - please do not listen to people who ask you reduce the size of the file - high bit rate is what we need. I mean, if you are encoding 720P with high compression, you are pretty much loosing the quality. I saw another 720P rip out there with 2 CHANNEL audio !! can you believe it, just 2 channels - whats wrong with ppl.. why would you have high def video with 2 channel audio.. anyways good work mate .."

,Terry.Jran,2011-10-24T20:42Z,nm about audio. already downloading another one. but video is superb
