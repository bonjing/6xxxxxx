I know they're difficult to find and most you do have to buy them but I thought I might ask since you have heaps of uploads and get your videos in awesome quality and Especially with No Logos which is also hard to get since those like Promo Only love to ""SIGNATURE"" their DVD videos ETC.
But thanks for the ones you've uploaded so far ... 

I have the Jessica Mauboy ""Been Waiting"" Deluxe Edition DVD if you like, I can upload the video files and you can re-up them in your super quality ...

If this helps please let us know and will just put up the whole DVD and you may take it from there :)

As always, heaps of thanks and appreciation and keep up the awesome work! 

Also, soon I will be releasing in conjunction with you, a music video to co-inside with my SubtitleMaster side of my user name.

I will be calling it ""The JB59/MRD And MDSM Subtitle music Video"" series since the music videos will be from your upload ...

I hope this is alright with you as well :)

MDSM :)"
