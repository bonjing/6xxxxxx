,ShadowMastr,2011-10-28T23:06Z,"The program and keygen work just fine. ESS 5 didn't like the keygen, but we know why.....

Anyway --- Even though this is actually Paintshop Pro X4 and NOT Paintshop Photo Pro X4, it is essentially the same thing.

Apparently Corel decided to drop 'Photo' from the name, and this is the result.

A review on pcmag says this version runs faster and doesn't crash like the X3. They still give Editors Choice to Photoshop Elements 10, but rank this a very close second."
