My maximum upload speed is ~50kb/s so don\\\\\\\'t rage about slow download rate. However this is really small game in size so it shouldn\\\\\\\'t take too long anyway. 
Also I share stuff mainly at 23:00-7:00 (UTC+02:00, Finnish time).

Info below:

In Lightspeed, your task is to illuminate spheres by directing laser beams
along reflective material and through translucent objects. 
You\\\\\\\'re not playing against the clock or another player--it\\\\\\\'s just you and
the principles of physics. 
Precision is key: If you turn a mirror too much, the beam may go completely
off the board. The austere graphics portray the mirrors, reflectors, 
absorbers, and maze walls clearly. Even if you aren\\\\\\\'t very good at 
physics, the introductory levels systematically explain each game element.
If you get stuck on a level, the Demo button shows you the solution.
