Using vivid wildlife footage and animation, this documentary presents a compelling look at the lives and skills of wild birds that soar grandly through the air and swoop adeptly down to snatch their prey. Sharp-eyed raptors use binocular and even ultra-violet vision to stalk their victims. Owls home in on a kill even in complete darkness with highly-developed hearing, responsible for the signature shape of their faces. Vultures search for carcasses and have keen long-distance senses of smell and dynamic digestive systems. Innovative experiments used by naturalists and scientists are also on display in this installment of the much-loved Discovery series, The Ultimate Guide.
