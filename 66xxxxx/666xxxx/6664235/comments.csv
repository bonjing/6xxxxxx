,Dr.D.,2011-09-21T00:13Z,"Great quality and there are actually subtitles in 10 different languages. And don't listen to that moron jaeaxp who either can't handle his mediaplayer or is a stupid troll. One last word to MXMG: I noticed the nice logo, but there is an error in it, it should actually say ""Quality at its best"" without the apostrophe, kthxbai"
