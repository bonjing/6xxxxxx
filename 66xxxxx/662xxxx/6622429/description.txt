What Matters Most

The incomparable Barbra Streisandâ€™s long-cherished desire to release an album of music with lyrics exclusively written by her collaborators and friends, Alan and Marilyn Bergman, will be achieved with her latest release What Matters Most- Barbra Streisand Sings the Lyrics of Alan and Marilyn Bergman

â€œWhat Matters Mostâ€ is her first new album since the September 2009 release of â€œLove Is The Answer,â€ which went to Number One on both sides of the Atlantic, making her the only artist to achieve number one albums in five consecutive decades.

The new album, which Streisand personally produced, is comprised of ten Bergman songs which Streisand has never previously recorded. Included in the set are the Academy Award winning songs â€œThe Windmill of your Mindâ€ (from the 1968 film The Thomas Crown Affair);  â€œSo Many Starsâ€ (originally a hit song for Sergio Mendes &  Brazil â€˜66); â€œNice â€˜nâ€™ Easyâ€ (popularized by Frank Sinatra); and â€œThat Faceâ€ (first recorded by Fred Astaire).
The CD will be packaged in a jewel box with a 24-page colour booklet.
Out: 22nd August â€“ Columbia Records
