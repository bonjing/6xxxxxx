I've created a multiboot DVD/USB for programs such as:

Avira AntiVir Rescue System
Dr.Web LiveCD
Kaspersky Kav Rescue CD
Panda Safe CD
Acronis AntiMalware
GParted
Parted Magic
System Rescue CD
Ultimate Boot CD
Linux Mint
Windows XP Recovery Disk
Windows 7 Recovery Disk (X86)
Windows 7 Recovery Disk (X64)

This was only built for me but as its here all together why not share it. I made it in case I crash my system again and cannot boot it up.

I'm always playing around with virus's so I need this really instead of reinstalling Windows.
