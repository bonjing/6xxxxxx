,Alyxm,2011-08-25T15:38Z,"Thank you so much man, any idea on who is making a crack? If anyone? Im hoping it (a crack) is available this evening or before tomorrow anyway... or tomorrow! :)"
,nathan38,2011-08-25T15:58Z,"now all we need is a crack. I expect between 6 and 12 hours after the EU release, which is the 26th"
,Darkoil,2011-08-25T16:27Z,"@Djdede i have no idea what 2 acc is, is it bad enough that you feel the need to call me a dickhead though?"
,haggisofdeath,2011-08-25T16:41Z,"Anyone know why the crackers are waiting for EU release? 

Just out of interest "
,kik6666,2011-08-25T16:43Z,"I have no idea what this is, but I'll wait for a proper version, not a version that needs to be installed with   a lower version of a different program and then need to do something other bla bla bla... I'll just wait for a SKIDROW release, or will I...?"
,N4N4KI,2011-08-25T16:47Z,"@haggisofdeath I think one of the EU editions, comes with an extra mission or something."
,Harty0000,2011-08-25T18:21Z,"Yuuus!! playing it now, ali213 released a crack. Working well so far ;D"
,ravenus11,2011-08-25T20:11Z,where would one find the windows7.exe (like in the beta)? cant find it anywhere - thanks in advance
,Yselik,2011-08-25T21:31Z,@Harty0000: Pics or it didn't happen.  Link to the crack because Ali213's other links are broken.

,coffin.filler,2011-08-26T13:27Z,2nd level is working fine :-)
,coffin.filler,2011-08-26T15:17Z,"100% working! I am level 2 and no crashes!!!!!!!
100%working on Win 7 64 bit (if interested).
Specs on PC GTX 275, 6G RAM, AMD 64X 3000+

Simply follow these instructions to install game and ensure you play in English, there were videos on YouTube but these have been removed so I am merely doing brief tut in text to help anyone who needs it! If you don't plz ignore 

1 = D/L Deus.Ex.Human.Revolution.Incl.Crack.and.CHS.Fullrepack-ALI213 (uploaded by sonuyosro).
2 = D/L this torrent (this is needed also).
3 = Run DE application file which is 887kb (in game d/l) and click ok, next, next, next and install game (language in Chinese but you can tell what's what very easy).
4 = Once Installed make sure all check boxes are selected as this will d/l directx etc (end of install process).
5 = locate folder where installed game and copy/paste dxhr into new folder on desk top.
6 = go into Deus ex game file (this torrent) and copy all but last 3 files.
7 = Paste files into folder where you installed game (overwrite existing files).
8 = Go into new folder on desk top and copy dxhr and paste it into folder where you installed game (overwrite).
9 = Enjoy :-) (make short cut on desk top from dxhr).

This works and is in English! Thanks to Ali213 (great re pack), sonuyosro for upload of the repack, Darkoil for the upload of the additional files needed and to Knifezerker for the You tube tut (even though removed). Seeeeeeeeeeeeeeding still and will continue to for a while longer, where are the other seeders tho? so many d/l but not so many seeed!"
,Sairith,2011-08-26T19:32Z,"coffen.filler

,coffin.filler,2011-08-26T21:12Z,"@ Sairith you are welcome, but remember i merely wrote the tut, I did not provide the content ;-)
Happy gaming!"
,number1mn,2011-08-26T22:06Z,You say all but the last 3 files. Which files specifically?
,Mikeydunn420,2011-08-26T22:34Z,i still can't get it in english where do i put the file?
,mnetarver,2011-08-27T02:25Z,"Followed the you tube tutorial by Knifezerker.

,geuheo28,2011-08-27T03:36Z,"fucking bastards   it's a bif fake !!!!!   dont download that crap !!!!!   it's a fake iso wbfs manager says 0,00go !! "
,alzho,2011-08-27T19:24Z,"@geuheo28 You do realize this is supposed to be dragged in to the game directory, not burned to a disc, right?"
,xeusoi16,2011-08-27T23:26Z,yea well i can tell you i was downloading one from bitextreme last night and it was password protected. i will try this but im not hopeful.
,darkspider99,2011-08-28T13:47Z,"If I download this, my game will be English? I downloaded this fucking game 2 times already."
