Van Halen - Best of, Vol. 1:

In addition to material from nine of the band's first ten studio albums (nothing from Diver Down was included), Best of Volume I also features the band's contribution to the Twister soundtrack ("Humans Being") and two newly recorded songs with original vocalist David Lee Roth ("Can't Get This Stuff No More" and "Me Wise Magic"). These two songs were released as singles to promote the Best Of compilation. Thus it contains the last studio songs recorded with David Lee Roth.

[Uploader's Update]: "As of 2011 Van Halen HAS got back together with David Lee Roth for some time now, and many boot-leg videos of their live performances can be found on sites such as YouTube. Also Eddy's Son is now the bass player."

*******************************************************************************
Initial pressings of the album contained an alternate edit of "Runnin' with the Devil" where the verses, chorus and solos were arranged in a different order than that of the original album version. It was reported that this was accidental and subsequent pressings have replaced this version with the one found on Van Halen. However, some radio stations still play this erroneous version of the song. (Compare the version of Runnin' with the Devil within THIS collection, comments are welcomed)
*******************************************************************************

The album itself, while not controversial, sparked a great deal of in-band controversy because of the personnel issues surrounding the band at the time. Sammy Hagar, who by this time had been a member of Van Halen for 11 years, equal to the amount of time as the previous vocalist, David Lee Roth, left the band in June 1996 due to a number of unclear circumstances. Some sources reported that Hagar was dissatisfied with the decision to issue a "greatest hits" collection, and was instead more inclined to do an entirely new album of new material. In either case, the band announced that Hagar had left the band and the band was instead working with David Lee Roth on new material for inclusion on the disc. This was not to last, as Roth and Edward clashed publicly and the band once again was without a lead singer, before hiring Gary Cherone. [1] All songs except "Humans Being", "Can't Get This Stuff No More", and "Me Wise Magic" are included on The Best of Both Worlds.

It is a golden introduction to a band that changed the face of '80s hard rock. Guitar-blazing old tracks like "Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love" segue into more commercial numbers like "Jump". These in turn, set the stage for Hagar's slicker, more polished vocals.
In addition to materials from nine of the band's first ten studio albums (nothing from Diver Down was included), Best of Volume I also features the band's contribution to the Twister soundtrack ("Humans Being") and two newly recorded songs with original vocalist David Lee Roth ("Can't Get This Stuff No More" and "Me Wise Magic").

[Uploader's Note]: "It's a pity this collection has not even a single song from Diver Down, as some of us liked the album a lot."
