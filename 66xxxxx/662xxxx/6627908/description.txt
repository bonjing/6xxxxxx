A tremendous achievement of Soviet cinema, very much in the style of silent Soviet cinema, Father of a Soldier (Georgian title: Jariskatsis mama; Russian title: Otyets soldata) is a humanistic tragicomedy about war.

Therefore, it may also have been influenced by Mario Monicelliâ€™s The Great War (1959), which shared the Golden Lion of St. Mark at Venice with a far less antic film about war, Roberto Rosselliniâ€™s General della Rovere (1959).

Written by Suliko Zhgenti and directed by Rezo Chkheidze, Father of a Soldier is a behavorial comedy in the midst of combat; it is warm, humorous, humane, piercing. Its heart is keyed to that of its protagonist, Georgy Makharashvili, an aging Georgian farmer who ventures beyond his rural village in search of his son, Goderdzi, a tankman and army lieutenant during World War II who has written home that he has been wounded. Goderdziâ€™s mother tells her husband just before his departure: Do not come back without our son! The manâ€™s odyssey takes him into battle, into warâ€™s heart of darkness. Along the way, he also dons a uniform to become a soldierâ€”and a good thing, too; for it is in Berlin, at its fall, that he reunites with his son. Briefly. Goderdzi, freshly wounded, dies with Georgy by his side.
