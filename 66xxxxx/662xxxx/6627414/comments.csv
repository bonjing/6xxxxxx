,harddrivesixtynine,2011-08-24T18:22Z,"You're all retarded. Be appreciative for the least or say nothing at all. Thanks!

The game is on it's way, be one of many to spam F5 here http://www.orlydb.com/s/games and shut the hell up."
,beanshr,2011-08-24T18:41Z,"Patience people, the game isn't going anywhere and good things come to those who wait :)"
,goingmad1,2011-08-24T18:55Z,At least some1 put some effort to upload this. Appreciated as I didn't see many of those bonus disks as torrents.
,toxia,2011-08-24T21:56Z,"i saw extremezone had a torrent up for the game, but its been snatched down, dunno whats up."
,ai2006,2011-08-24T22:17Z,"So far, all the game release for PC are fake. Thats why they are taken down."
,toxia,2011-08-24T22:49Z,"yeah now theres another fake one up, last one wasnt up long enough for me to look at it, obviously fakes. losers."
,Zelaron,2011-08-25T00:13Z,I... I... I thought you were a GEP gun.
,mitegai,2011-08-25T00:21Z,I kind of miss the fakes. At least they gave us a place to chat while we wait for this release. 
,marcusfenix919,2011-08-25T08:18Z,I logged in just to say Thank you for this :)
,__arch,2011-08-25T09:43Z,"to all those crybabies regarding cracks:
how about fucking actually BUYING the game that's rated 10/10 on so many reviews instead of buying like 10 beers in an evening. And stop crying about your damn incompetence of cracking the game by yourselves. Do it yourself or shut up and wait!"
,Xe1887,2011-08-25T12:35Z,"@arch

I can't buy the game in my country"
,lkymn,2011-08-25T12:59Z,"@arch

Telling people on a pirate site to BUY something?

Might as well tell a rich person to donate all of their money."
,clovely,2011-08-25T13:21Z,can someone please upload the 40 page artbook
,lefioda,2011-08-28T19:56Z,"Seed, stuck at 99.9%!!!"

,MrE159357,2011-08-29T15:53Z,"After 5 days at 99.9999% (adriko did not come back), I am safe in saying that this torrent is dead.  For those of us with almost everything, we got screwed.  I was only going to get the extra content from torrents since charging extra for a couple of weapons, and unlocking the maps from the demo (which was free!?!) is pathetic.  Now, I am grabbing the whole game, so job well done!

Quick Version: Do not DL - was not seeded to 100% and poster is gone."
,Blyzer,2011-08-29T22:38Z,C'mon man...seed!!!
,Bersercker,2011-08-30T09:22Z,"Downloaded 4.10 gb, availability 0.99... 

Fuuuuuuuu"
,Metatron.,2011-08-31T11:40Z,"Please seed, I too stuck at 99,9!"
,rainycat,2012-03-03T15:56Z,"Please seed, it's at 99.9% for many."
