1080p means ratio is 1920x1080. But when you rip the Bluray Disc you use this ratio 1920x800. why you don't use 1920x1080 ratio??? what is te reason behind it????

 It just a query please answer."
,meguil,2011-09-13T20:12Z,@Aragon101 bro some movies are release in resolution 1920x1080. and some in 1920x800. resolution.... so according to its original res. i rip it... if i make 1920x800 to 1920x1080 then you will get some black area on up and down side of the video. :)
