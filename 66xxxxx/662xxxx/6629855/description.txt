Hercules series (1957-1965)


A series of 19 Italian Hercules movies were made in the late 50s and early 60s. The films were all sequels to the fantastically successful Steve Reeves movie "Hercules" (1957) and its sequel "Hercules Unchained" (1959), and inspired Italian filmmakers to begin a new Maciste film series in 1960. The actors who played Hercules in these films were Steve Reeves, Gordon Scott, Kirk Morris, Mickey Hargitay, Mark Forest, Alan Steel, Dan Vadis, Brad Harris, Reg Park, Peter Lupus (billed as Rock Stevens) and Michael Lane.
