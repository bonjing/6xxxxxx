I already have the other albums.
The one's missing are Pick up a bone and Unfinished picture"

Can't you at least seed until someone else got 100%"
,wetWeasel,2011-09-16T08:52Z,"Need to be Seeded.

A great selection of albums, but we can't help you if you don't  help us.

Please seed until there are several other seeders to take up the feed."

Thanks for sharing!"
