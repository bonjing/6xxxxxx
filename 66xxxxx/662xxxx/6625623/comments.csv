[T],artpepper,2011-08-24T13:45Z,"@heyman1981, to be fair, some TS releases are better than others but on the whole, I find them unwatchable. 

I watched an earlier TS of this film and, like most CAMs (and that is what a TS is: a CAM with synchronised audio) it was absolute shit--I turned it off after 5 minutes. 

The audio was actually painful (all super-lows and super-highs) and the video was so dark and murky, it was like watching with a hangover and sunglasses on.

I guess it depends on how much you want to see a film; if you don't mind muddy-to-unlistenable sound and unwatchably dark video, then you won't be bothered. Personally, I've given up on TSs and just wait for a proper SCR or R5 release.

But thanks for the upload @TVTeam."

,Chadly,2011-08-24T17:37Z,"@ artpepper ive found some pretty nice TS out there. I know if you have to pay per gig of download, its probably not worth even trying any TS, cause most are crap. But if you have unlimited download like me its worth a shot. If you cant wait. Sometimes those R5s dont come out until a couple weeks before the dvd is released. Might aswel wait for the dvd at that point lol. Check out Fright Nights TS on here. Its pretty good I think, for a cam and or TS. In my short exp with downloading I have found some pretty good TS copies so I will def never stop trying them, thanks tvteam, but this TS is garbage. Warning to downloaders all Conan out there are garbage right now. Ive tried them all. Dont even bother. Wait a couple weeks :)"
