    Ray Crisis is your typical flying/fighting, scrolling arcade game with an 
    environmental twist. The levels you fly through are not strictly 2D and move
    and warp around you, creating a morphing landscape and loose feel to the
    game. There are 3 ships called Wave Runners to choose from, namely the WR-01R,
    WR-02R and the WR-03. Each ship has its own individual weapon set-up including
    different lock-on capabilities, main gun and special attacks.
