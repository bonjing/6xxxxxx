[V],mirrormaster82,2011-08-24T18:36Z,MrD:You beat me by seconds for uploading this one :-(
[T],MrDowntown,2011-08-24T18:56Z,"Haa haa i win! LOL :P

We should figure out what were doing with the 52 next month? Split them up or just Upload as we go? Lots of duplicates - but more the merrier."
,BatDinger,2011-08-24T19:27Z,looking foward to youse guys's coverage of the new 52. I already expected to get most of them with the 0day pack
,NeikanTenshi87,2011-08-24T20:42Z,"To MrDowntown and the rest of the scanners, I just want to say thank you so much for all your hard work. I'm visually impaired, so the digital form of comics is the only way I can experience them. I still buy the comics in the shop for collection purposes, but to actually be able to read them I have to use the digital format along with assistive technology like ZoomText. So again I really thank you guys for all the work you do week in and week out, you really have no idea how much I appreciate it. Keep up the great work guys!"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-08-24T21:05Z,"@NeikanTenshi87:

Im just an uploader not a scanner - gotta get some $$ before I switch to scanning, but yeah they are the true heroes and the people who Seed it back :D"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-01T17:40Z,"Finally got around to reading this.. just when i was thinking that Batman Inc was getting better they make this mess - cant stand the art, panels are way too cluttered, dialogue is terrible. I love batman but really un-happy with the direction many of these are headed :("
,MonJoh,2011-09-02T02:46Z,"I gotta admit I LOVE the art, myself. I can see what you mean by 'cluttered panels' and yeah, the dialogues are poor (they often are) but this looks like nothing I've seen before. 
And I don't think they will (or even should) do ten issues (or five or two, for that matter) like this one. 
Overall, I am pleased with the graphic designs of all eight issues so far (esp. Y. Paquette, whose work I really appreciate)."
