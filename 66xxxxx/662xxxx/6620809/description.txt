Alice Cooper - Toronto's Varsity Stadium 13-9-1969 (new edit from freak out cd) Long version

My own version of legendary alice cooper Toronto rock and roll revial concert.

I removed Ronnie hawkins songs(aint that just like a woman and goin to the river) from the"freak out" album and the songs are edited in the correct order.

I added the longer version of "Don`t blow your mind) song directly from "toronto live"VHS tape....So "don't blow..." quality is little bit lower than other songs..

if someone wants this to "FLAC" format, so please send me a private message ..

1 (real song title) no Longer Umpire (fake "FREAK OUT" title (Painting a picture)
2. Fields of regret (science fiction)
3. Nobody likes me
4. Lay down and die,goodbye ( An instrumental,i`ve writen home to mother)
5. Don`t blow your mind (with different lyrics) 13 min VERSION (Freak out song)

I hope you like this little hippy trip concer
