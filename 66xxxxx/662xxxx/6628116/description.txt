******************** Mafia II ******************

is upon us and ushering in a new era of wise guys and made men. If you've been waiting for this one, there is good news GGÃ©Â¼GÃ‡Â£ the game is
 fun. Having shootouts in bars while bottles explode and glass flies, finding a mob hacking your friend to death, and going to brothels are all
 great times. Still, those moments aren't the entire game, and the accompanying parts hurt the whole.

Mafia II casts you as Vito Scaletta, a young Italian who returns from World War II to find his mother and sister on the hook to a loan shark. 
Like any gangster in a gangster movie, Vito decides he doesn't want a subpar life of the slums and goes down the organized crime route to make 
some cash. You'll be with Vito as he whacks dudes, steals cars and tries on all sorts of snazzy outfits.
This is a video review you can't refuse.

All of this is going on in Empire Bay, a New York-esque town packed with people, cops, cars and collectable Playboy magazines. Now, at first 
glance, Empire Bay looks like an open world GGÃ©Â¼GÃ‡Â£ one teeming with missions and quests for you to take Vito on. It isn't. You'll have one mission 
at any time and it's always one that drives the story forward. All the icons on the map GGÃ©Â¼GÃ‡Â£ clothing stores, gun stores, and so on GGÃ©Â¼GÃ‡Â£ are just 
ways to enhance that mission. Outgunned and dying a lot? Buy better weapons after restarting. Cops on your tail? Go pay to have the license 
plate changed on your ride. You're not going to wander around the streets of Mafia II picking up odd jobs and meeting strangers; this is a 
world built around the missions you're doing.

So what is so good with this upload?

Improved Mafia 2 performance with the APEX clothes fix Some of you with even mid-high range video hardware might find slowness, stuttering and other framerate related issues while playing Mafia 2.

***Thankfully, all this allready fix and done by me!!***

You get a massive framerate boost without losing too much visual quality. The game uses 
dynamic clothing (realistic clothing simulation) not only for the main character but for all NPCs as well. This is a very CPU and GPU intensive
 task and can take up quite a lot of resources. 
this should greatly improve frame rate.
