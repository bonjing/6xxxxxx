To Be Still is the follow-up to Alela Dianeâ€™s critically-acclaimed 2006 debut The Pirateâ€™s Gospel which brought the Nevada City, CA-reared musician a passionate following across the globe (and massive acclaim in France where sheâ€™s recently completed a 26-date tour that took her deep into the countryside). Considering that initial copies of The Pirateâ€™s Gospel were given away to friends in hand-sewn covers just a few years ago, this is not only quite a leap, but a well-deserved one.

Geoff Travis, founder of Rough Trade Records, says â€œAlela Diane is a real American Songwriter. Both flinty and beautiful. She draws from a tradition that might include Sandy Denny and Karen Dalton and she suffers not a jot in comparisonâ€
