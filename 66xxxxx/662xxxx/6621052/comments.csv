,Jmadrid99,2011-09-16T02:54Z,Thanks for uploading. Do you have a serial for Acronis Recovery for Microsoft Exchange. Or do you know where i can find one.
,mukammalaurshaffaf,2011-10-05T13:21Z,"When i posted the serial it was fully working with the Acronis Products. But now Acronis has blocked the serial in its new build.

So for all new comers, do not download the trial version from Acronis.

Sorry from who have already downloaded."
