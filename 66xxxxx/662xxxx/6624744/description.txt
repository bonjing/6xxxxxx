Included are a Custom set of JAPANESE--to--ENGLISH Subs extracted from a Retail DVD, then Time corrected.
I used the 'Tokyo Drift' HDDVD/MP4 rip from honchorella31 as my timing source. The matching torrent is also
included in this package to make things easier.


The Matching Version of Tokyo Drift can be found here:

Alternatively, you can open either the included TXT or SRT file in Notepad and edit the time codes for each line as you like to match your own copy.


As the SRT file is currently, you can simply use MKVMERGE to add it to your honchorella31/Tokyo Drift RIP if you already have it.

I decided to do this for my own collection, as it seems that 99.99% of English Rips out there FAIL to include any Subs for the Japanese speaking parts..LAME.

Enjoy,
