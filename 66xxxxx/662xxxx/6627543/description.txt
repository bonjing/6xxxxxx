    Because of a back-log of war orders, the Lambert Airplane factory is     
    unable to try-out the robot-controlled plane developed by test pilot     
    Jerry Barton and weather bureau observer, "Doc" Williams. The pair       
    lie in wait for factory owner George B. Lambert while he is playing      
    golf with his spoiled dbutant daughter, Betty, and send up their        
    radio-controlled model where Lambert cannot fail to notice it. But       
    Jerry sets the model down in a pool of water and douses Betty.           
    Lambert authorizes Jerry and Doc to test their remote-controlled         
    robot pilot on one of his planes for the Army. Jerry flies the plane     
    up, bails out and Doc is to land the plane using his remote control      
    box. But foreign agents, wishing to hamper the development of the        
    robot pilot, have tampered with the controls, and Doc is unable to       
    pull the plane out of a spin, and it crashes. Lambert fires Jerry and    
    he and Doc return to the remote weather outpost to do more work on       
    their invention. Betty, on her way to Hollywood to be a movie star,      
    is driving across the desert with her Aunt Maude and runs out of         
    gas,and Betty borrows some gas belonging to the U.S. government, and     
    is caught by Jerry. He decides to place her under arrest, pending the    
    arrival, in a week's time, of the U.S. Marshal. Jerry makes Betty and    
    Aunt Maude do housework and chores. The spies steal a plane, crash in    
    the desert, show up and make some trouble, and try to get away in a      
    car in which Betty and Aunt Maude are hiding in the trunk.
