,c0ldpr0xy,2012-06-09T23:42Z,"Okay, I can confirm that this is actually Sims 3 and not Sim City 3000.

Yes, I triple-checked everything and no I have no personal vendetta against the uploader to ruin his reputation.

The keygen is also a virus. How can you be so stupid to upload a whole different game?"
