Son of the Mask is a 2005 fantasy family-comedy film directed by Lawrence Guterman, starring Jamie Kennedy as Tim Avery, an aspiring cartoonist from Fringe City who's just had his first child born with the powers of the Mask. It is the sequel to the successful 1994 film The Mask, an adaptation of Dark Horse Comics which starred Jim Carrey. The film had an $84 million budget and $57.6 million worldwide box office gross.
It also stars Alan Cumming as the god of mischief, Loki, whom Odin has ordered to find the Mask. It co-stars Traylor Howard, Kal Penn, Steven Wright, and Bob Hoskins as Odin. Ben Stein makes a quick reappearance as Dr. Arthur Neuman from The Mask to reestablish the relationship with the mask and Loki. The film was widely panned by critics. It won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Remake or Sequel.
Unlike the first film which was more adult oriented, this film is a family film as the film's tone is much lighter and more comical than the first one's darker tone.
