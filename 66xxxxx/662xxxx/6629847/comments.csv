,thespiritglass,2011-08-26T12:15Z,"Hi, does this have hard coded english subs for the non-english speaking role? As in will my noontek media player apply these subs? The reason I ask is I downloaded another movie where the non-english speaking parts did not have subs at all. I know some video files have it ""within"" the file. Thanks! I really appreciate it fellow bayers!"

MXMG Thanks"
,sun2244,2011-08-26T21:35Z,@thespiritglass : the subs are in a separate file including the Russian parts. U can name the sub file the same as the video file and Noontec should show the subs entirely...
