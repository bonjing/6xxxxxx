Aphex played, so I had to take the train over to Copenhagen.

I brough my portable microphone(s), with a XY setting, hence the stereo sound.

Did some editing in Cubase, added compression and just a little EQ.

Also the wave file was about 1.8GB so I compressed it into Stereo 320kbit MP3.

I hope youÂ´ll enjoy my trouble, and help seeding this one for a while.
