After the kidnapping of the Swiss Ambassador in Brazil in 1970, 70 political prisoners were released from Brazilian prisons and set free in Chile on an exchange agreement. The directors of this film, Haskell Wexler and Saul Landau, went to Chile and recorded first-hand interviews with the former prisoners, revealing the torture that was part of everyday routine interrogation in Brazilian prisons. The film shows reenactments of waterboarding, pau de arara and other medieval and modern "procedures" administered by Brazil's military government.
