Date: Sunday 21st August 2011 (Already shown)

Drama based on a true story. In the summer of 1931, with Germany on the brink of economic collapse and the city of Berlin turning into a paramilitary war zone, audacious young prosecutor Hans Litten summons a star witness to a trial of Nazi thugs. In spite of the risk to his own safety and against the advice of those who love him, Litten forces rising political star Adolf Hitler to make a sensational appearance in the witness stand of Berlin's central criminal court. Litten aims to expose the true character of Hitler and his politics to the German public, to reveal his hypocrisy and his violent ambitions and, in doing so, halt the electoral success of the Nazi Party. In a humiliating and hostile cross-examination, Hitler is forced to account for his political beliefs, his contempt for the law and his desire to destroy German democracy. For a brief moment, Hitler's political future is genuinely in the balance.
