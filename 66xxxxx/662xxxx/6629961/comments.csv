...not sure I'm interested in the movie itself, but agree with biz that this is from a trusted uploader, and BONE rocks... =)"

,symalteria,2011-10-23T09:05Z,"it must be a newbie thing that I myself dont yet understand, when i go to download torrents like this it seems fake, but that is only cause us newbies do not know what we are doing!  If other peolpe are saying its fine and its from Bone so it should be, then howcome the file is empty?  Should we be downloading and then using a different player? HELP with this issue would be so greatly appreciated.  FYI I am only talking about the downloads that have a blank icon when you go to download, someone had made a post on a diff torrent regarding what we were doing wrong but I forget what they said and I cant find it now! :)"
