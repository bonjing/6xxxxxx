"
[T],zingooo,2011-08-23T22:18Z,i dowloaded  the movie its same like cam with bad video and Audio
,billygoat71,2011-08-23T22:37Z,"V-6 A-5 vid is pretty dark in places, Audio crackles in the begining. But its watchable."
,cuttingedgecomix,2011-08-24T02:44Z,"It's watchable, but the audio kinda sucks"
,ryuut84,2011-08-24T14:34Z,"v is a 6 as far as TS goes, i'd call it watchable while the scenes are in daylight. Audio was pretty horrible, and it went out of sync about 15 minutes before the movie ended."
,ptv83,2011-08-24T14:48Z,"HORRID AUDIO, unwatchable during the entire narration at the beginning that explains the story, remaining audio is terribly bad too, messing with the equalizer in WMP helps to clear up the speech so you can at least hear what they're saying.

First ""Telesync"" that i turned off and deleted in 2years.

Video has blurring across the bottom.. not sure what could be possibly blurred out in a camera recording from the theatre as it would all be original content without watermarking or the usual things that are blurred in screeners.

A:1
V:7
M:7 - skipped past narration and watched until 15minutes (including the part i skipped) and it seemed alright i guess... not mind blowing or anything... NOT ANYTHING like the old films which you could laugh at... too serious almost."
,Calamakuya,2011-08-28T05:06Z,"Darn... I'm forced to wait a bit longer for a better release...

I may as well go nutz meanwhile."
,DieHardNinja,2011-10-29T12:22Z,Sorry for your luck froggie100.  Hope you or someone gets a decent upload of this soon!
