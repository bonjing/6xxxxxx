,zmajcekBo,2011-08-25T10:32Z,"Great, thx! I don't understand however, if there are 15 seeders as stated at the moment, how come my max seeder is 82 % seeded only. It's gonna p2p better tomorrow tough no doubt."
,twilight_nexus,2011-08-25T13:17Z,why all these new blu-ray movies very dark.. and by that i mean the print is quite low in brightness. i always have to tweak the video settings to get the brightness right..
,5amjr,2011-08-25T13:39Z,"I dunno if it's the china rip as the first bluray of Source Code and Priest were asian too and had a dark blue tinge to them.
I won't be screwing up my bravia settings for a rip but is much better than the r5's around m8ys!"
,nittany,2011-08-25T14:19Z,I think some of these rips are not from final bluray discs or something which is why the quality is sometimes weird.
,abhikrit,2011-08-25T14:19Z,the brightness & everything is perfect.

You can get it that low by lowering the bitrate considerably, however that makes that quality of the movie horrid, pixelated garbage.

Whilst still being 720p, calling it HD is an insult."

I tried converting it with Emicsoft Video Converter but only converts to the same spot then stops.  Also my brand new WD Media Player only plays to the same spot and has no sound.  Is it a codex problem because of BluRay or a bad download.  Are there any better converters that work best with Mac?
For what its worth for the first minute V: 10/10 really good"
,bragazar1710,2011-10-02T01:28Z,thanks.
,drkblz,2011-10-06T07:24Z,"BOZX, you need to include the partial English Subs. Some of these Blu-rays aren't hardcoded. Not your fault for them not being hardcoded, but you need to include those. For everyone else, those are available here: http://subscene.com/english/X-Men-First-Class/subtitle-473946.aspx

Also, I noticed too that my download for this and another 720p was really bad... TV shows take 5 minutes tops (200mb), but this took a few days. What gives? Is is a setting in uTorrent?

Finially, 720p IS HD. Anything above 1000px horizontal resolution is HD (720p is 1280 horizontal). Also, this is 720p. It is approx 2.3:1 Ratio, instead of 1.8:1, so it has black bars produced by your player to fill in the remaining vertical space. It essence, due to the aspect ratio, it has the same width as true 720p, but not the same height, so you get 544 vertical pixels instead of 720. Alternatively, the black bars could be encoded for a true 720p, but then the file would be bigger and harder to use, and the bars are typically off-black."

,meothui,2011-10-25T18:03Z,"Here's another idiot having 6.5 GB for a 720p. Don't you fucking know there's an encoding mode called ""quality mode"" which uses variable bitrate?
