Fanboy Confessional

â€œFanboyâ€, â€œGeekâ€ and â€œNerdâ€ were once terms of ridicule and derision, but now these folks wear the badges proudly. Because everyone knows â€“ Nerds Rule! And today there are literally millions of self-professed nerds around the world. FANBOY CONFESSIONAL is a new television series celebrating this revolution.

FANBOY CONFESSIONAL presents active stories of self-professed â€œFanboysâ€ (and â€œFangirlsâ€) â€“ pop culture enthusiasts and aficionados. Itâ€™s a celebration of unique interests and creative knowledge, and presents each Fanboy as a hero in his or her own right. The characters in our series come from all areas of fandom, and all have a sense of humor about their passions, mixed with a healthy measure of self-awareness and respect.
