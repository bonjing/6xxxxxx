Did you use this loader?
This loader is not detected by Microsoft even if you install updates!"

,bert16,2011-08-27T04:36Z,"My wife just called my that her laptop lost its Windows activation. I've always been a fan of w7lxe.exe, so I used it. For the first time ever it didn't work, so I turned to this program and it worked perfectly. MS Security Essentials picked it up as a virus after the activation, so I promptly deleted it as well as the files it created on her drive C: - The computer is activated and all is well."
,11western,2011-08-27T20:01Z,"I don't know why so maybe someone can figure this out. I have tried this many times with various torrents and they all act the same.
The windows loader box opens but there's no tabs ( profile,oem,advanced) and the install/uninstall buttons aren't useable. Build does say 7601.
I changed the serial that thumper gave me before and it worked for awhile but kb971033 got back in updates and up pops the ""this copy is not genuine"". No time limit and in system it still says activated. Seem not to be able to change serials now and I'm logged in as admin.

Thanks in advance if anyone has an idea!!"

WAT is Windows Activation Technology.
Search Google for more ;)

@bert16
You don't have to delete anything.
It's not a virus.

Good luck.

@Dimmis80
How did you activate it?"

No, you don't have to."
,Munchk1npuncher,2011-08-29T05:00Z,Fantastic! Best loader.
,Dimmis80,2011-08-29T08:25Z,@Maherz my windows were activated from the start.I did not do anything.I just installed them..!
[T],Maherz,2011-08-29T23:01Z,"@Munchk1npuncher
Anytime ;)

@Dimmis80
Upgrade to SP1 and don't worry.
In case you lose activation, use this loader to reactivate it.
Good luck."
