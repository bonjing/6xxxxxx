Fast Five 2011 BluRay 720p DTS x264-3Li

SUMMARY:
Former cop Brian O'Conner partners with ex-con Dom Toretto on the opposite side 
of the law. Since Brian and Mia Toretto broke Dom out of custody, they've blown 
across many borders to elude authorities. Now backed into a corner in 
Rio de Janeiro, they must pull one last job in order to gain their freedom. 
As they assemble their elite team of top racers, the unlikely allies know 
their only shot of getting out for good means confronting the corrupt 
businessman who wants them dead. But he's not the only one on their tail. 
Hard-nosed federal agent Luke Hobbs never misses his target. When he is 
assigned to track down Dom and Brian, he and his strike team launch an 
all-out assault to capture them. But as his men tear through Brazil, 
Hobbs learns he can't separate the good guys from the bad. Now, he must 
rely on his instincts to corner his prey... before someone 
else runs them down first.
