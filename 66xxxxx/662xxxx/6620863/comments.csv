READNFO because the vid and audio have issues. Source vid was a cam of a 3d showing. Relizlab have tried to convert this to 2d. This had left the file with alot of wierd artifacts ( side to side wobble, some hints of double vision, ocasional scene still in 3d and fluctuating red and green scale). Audio was very nasty. I've worked wonders at cleaning this up, however there is a very strong distortion that pops up over speach every now and then and can make it dificult to hear the speach. This is rare and brief but it does happen. Although i could clean the strong hiss from the audio, this distortion is engrained in the audio, even more so by a previouse, amateur attempt at cleaning. I do not have software or know of any tricks to fix this. Soz :(

Work done:
Video: Adjusted aspect to match the movies origional. Rebalenced, sharpened and cleaned. Used an antiflicker filter and reduced alot of the wobble and fluctuation, making the end result much easier on the eye.
Audio: De-hissed pretty hard. Tried and failed to repair the distortion. Could only reduce the severity of it and make it a little easier to understand whats being said. 95% of the audio is clean and perfect. Download the little comparison files bellow and check out the before and after to see the impact i've had on the aduio. You gota hear this. Its an excellent way of demonstraiting the kind of work i do.
Overall: Trimmed 1 mns 30 secs off the start. This was not a relevent part of the movie. Just a description of what 4d is and explaining that theres scratch cards under the viewers seat and you scratch the number off and sniff when the coresponding numbered cog shows on screen. Audio was badly messed up in this section so i took the liberty of removing it completely.

This woulda and shoulda been a great ts. Even flawed i still feel its a very nice ts. Its not perfect though and i just wanted you to be aware of this before downloading. Untill something better comes along, this is the best its gona get. Take it or leave it :)
Now i've told you, dont complain about it, lest ye be trolled in the comments for being dumb enough not to read the notes first trololol :D"

But seeing the amount of work .BONE has done on the video,in my opinion it is awesome.

I appreciate your effort and your upload!!!!!"

,theoriginalphantom,2011-09-28T12:04Z,"@terrybaseball
Use a program called convertxtodvd. I can say in all honesty it is the best for converting almost any video file to dvd. Good luck mate.
.BONE. Thanks for the up."
,drewkrew,2011-10-02T22:42Z,"BONE: any news on a new source for this yet, all current release groups (to my knowledge) have used the same one with loss of video at the end and film cut short...? 

I also wanted to say thanks for all the work you've put in to uploading etc lately. You're a true credit to the Bay.
