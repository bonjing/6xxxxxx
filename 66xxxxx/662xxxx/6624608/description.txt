The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set.
	â€¢	Feynman's effective classroom style remains intact in these volumes, a valuable work by a remarkable educator.
	â€¢	The volumes are an edited version of Richard Feynman's lectures, taped and transcribed specifically for the books.
	â€¢	The three volume commemorative issue is either available hardbound and packaged in a specially designed slipcase, or in a paperbound edition.
This three volume work was originally designed for a two-year introductory physics course given at the California Institute of Technology â€” a course designed to take advantage of readers' increasing mathematical prowess and to provide a more comprehensive view of modern-day physics. It is a rigorous undertaking that resulted in a classic reference work for anyone interested in physics.
