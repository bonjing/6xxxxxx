,mbmalone,2011-08-27T00:02Z,"I tried the hacker edition and the desktop wallpaper reminded me of my redheaded cousin. I clicked to play a game  ..... because that's what hackers do and the SOBeach said no Java was installed and wouldn't let me play. aahhhhhhh yo' fukkkkn beaach teasing me with game button! soky, because the intel audio didn't work. Everything else worked good."
,redback38,2011-08-27T01:07Z,"on checking disk 3(hacking disk).....you are spot on the money.....i forgot to add the java lol! ah well,guess im not a god after all lol!...an easy workaround is to simply download and install java.a small ass pain yes but itll work fine..games work on disk one no problem....and yes there is no audio on disks two and three...not a necessary item for rescue or hacking so i left them out for space saving reasons.....i will check my mail this morning for the driver scripts you sent me.....two more versions to be released in the next day or so:-)"
,redback38,2011-08-27T01:09Z,howd you go with the other two discs???
,mbmalone,2011-08-28T20:39Z,"I had more problems, unfortunately. With disk 1, I tried to run the games. Games are very important to hackers, btw. Remember, ""do you want to play a game"" from wargames? Anyway, I could bring up the awesome game menu and see defender and all that, but it would just lockup my desktop because there was no sound support. It might work on another computer. The desktop has ADI 198x Integrated HD Audio. I guess you should just integrate all the sound drivers, if you haven't already. I was going to just download the driver, but flash wasn't installed or something and just locked up the browser completely. rrrrrrrr ...."
,redback38,2011-08-29T01:08Z,"dam.....it all works fine and slick here....its a fine balance to try to get all things working for everyones comps as geniric as possible....i tried these discs out on a few dells i could get my hands on without issue,and some hp as well as my toshiba a350(my build comp).and they were all ok with the exception of java missing on disk 3...as a gift to you and as an apology for ur time and input,ill post you a custom build with all ur packs included today,as i have some free time,and ill make SURE the games suite works for dells especially before putting it up:-)"

I haven't tired it yet on my hp notebook. It might work fine."
,ratfucker,2011-08-31T20:43Z,"Okay, let's try this set."
,mbmalone,2011-08-31T22:19Z,"I would like to see virgin 8, but with less desktop icons. OMG, can't find anything. That's a lot of software, love it."
