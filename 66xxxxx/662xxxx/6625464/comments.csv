,Fenr1r,2011-09-18T12:31Z,"Works in Win7 x64

I'm surprised why this torrent has only 5 comments (+ this one). It's a good game! ^_^

And I didn't have any problems with saving.
ruifilipe13, if you tell the name of the DLL file or the exact error message, maybe someone can help."
,lward53,2011-09-19T03:04Z,"The dll error ""the program can't start because MSVCR100.dll is missing from you're computer. try re installing to fix this problem""

Ive re installed three times."
