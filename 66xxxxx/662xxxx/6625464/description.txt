           Steam:


When indie game developers Alexey and Markus are in trouble, their only hope comes from their creation.
You are the Tetrobot: a tiny robot that can drill blocks of matter one by one, collect them, and recycle them into new pieces of 4 blocks. You also have the possibility to destroy lines of 8+ blocks in a very Â«retro russianÂ» game style. Sand, wood, stone, obsidian, iron, diamond: each matter has its specific behavior you'll have to use wisely and take advantage of them. So get ready to use your brain and combine your platforming and puzzle-solving skills in this incredible mashup!

"(...) sometimes you find some gems that are truly worthwhile. Blocks That Matter is one of those.â€
- Jeuxvideo.com 18/20
