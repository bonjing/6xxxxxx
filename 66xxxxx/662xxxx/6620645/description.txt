It's the latest MisterMusic Show 163   

New music this week from  former Pavement member Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks, and a cool song from the Swedish duo- Pallers.  Plus recent songs by Wire, Clan of Xymox, Digits, and Portugal The Man. 

Of course the usual mix of classic hits from over 5 decades of indie-alternative-rock. 

The Oldie of the Week was released this week in 1965.  It eventually went No. 1 and was a theme for the folk movement during the Viet Nam war.
