[V],polisdavid,2011-08-24T09:36Z,"Doesn't work except in trial mode.

Keygen is difficult to run. unreliable, and hard to understand whether why it's not in root by default on a standalone machine. Is there a trick to setting up the keygen?

Also, serial number comes up a 000-0000000 when in activate mode not what was entered, so what do you enter as sn on the activation screen?

Mempatch never works."

If I can get to that point I think I can handle the rest b/c the instructions by LGalhardo seem fairly concise although complicated for a code novice.

In the link posted by LGahalrdo titled ""how to make it work on Lion"", this is what is written: ***Once you get to the activation screen select ""I have an activation code"" and open activity monitor making sure ""All Processes"" is selected at the top.***

The ""open activity monitor"" and ""making sure all processes is selected..."" is what is throwing me off.  Obviously you were able to do it WITHOUT going thru this process, you just ran the automated script and I don't know how u did it so there's my hangup.  Could you pls explain exactly how u did it so that I and probably many more out there can do it too?  Thx!"
,rubengarciajr,2011-09-03T08:13Z,"lkft> u don't need to select anything.  When the ""Activity Monitor"" app pops up, u just need to look for ""AutoCAD License Manager"" and see which PID number it has assigned to it.  Then u enter that number on the script."
,raj3489,2011-09-04T09:26Z,Great torrent. Works 100%. Thanks a lot Anacondaz   for great upload.
,lkft,2011-09-05T00:23Z,"...Slowly getting there...the activity monitor referred to is the standard Mac OS program that all macs have...duh!  I was thinking it was something to do w/xcode...anyway, was able to find the PID of the Autodesk Licensing Utility as per LGaharldo's link but when I get to the part that says ""maximize terminal and enter the following lines..."" terminal doesn't recognize the lines as valid so I can't continue to the next part which is even more daunting requiring the use of a ""GDB"" to alter the code of the keygen to fix the memory patch with more lines of code.  I'm doing all this as described by LGaharldo's link titled ""how to make it work w/Lion"".  If that's what all you guys have done then pls guide me into what I'm doing wrong.  If you guys were able to use some kind of ""automated script"" as seems to be the case w/rubengarciajr then dammit tell me how you did it b/c it's all a big mystery to me!  Thx!"
,rubengarciajr,2011-09-05T07:11Z,"lkft>

I see what could be the problem on your end.  You are following the instructions on how to do it manually without the script.  

Forget that, just download and use the 2nd link which is the automated script that will walk u through the steps.  "
,guitarmasterlala,2011-09-05T10:11Z,"i get error not admin when running memory patch with force, what am i doing wrong? please help!"
,lkft,2011-09-05T20:49Z,"@rubengarciajr
You were right, I was not using the second link.  I did download the link before and i forgot about it.  Anyway, followed the instructions and ran into the following hangups...when prompted to enter the hexadecimal address for the text of the mentioned process the format is ""05cb6000-0620c000"" along w/some other info inside brackets.  After letting the GDB run I get prompted to click on memory patch of the keygen and when I do the gdb runs yet again and stops and I get another prompt stating the memory patch has been fixed and to enter the request code and generate the activation code and when I do the AC doesn't work, I get prompted by autodesk to go back or re-enter, etc.

Of interest I notice that the gdb has a ""invalid number xxxxxxxx and in a separate popup Crack2012 says ""can't get end"".

Am I entering the hex address correctly?  Any other  ideas on what could be going wrong?  Thx!"
,rubengarciajr,2011-09-06T00:39Z,what are entering for the hex address?  It should be  8 characters.
,geoldr,2011-09-07T01:46Z,"I got to the point where I am supposed to enter the hex value, the output I am getting is this:

is that a hex range or something? Which value do I use? "
,geoldr,2011-09-07T02:58Z,"Well I was able to manual do this, by searching for ""libadlmact_libFNP.dylib"" and using the first of the two values. X-force reported that it successfully patched it, and it worked!"
,evo-l,2011-09-16T03:34Z,Can someone re-upload the script? I cannot download it from that site its currently hosted on. 
,evo-l,2011-09-22T04:20Z,"So it tells me to use the hex address ""under"" __TEXT. 

I do not have anything under __TEXT, just hex's next to it to the right in ranges like ""9847000-04cdc700""

I don't get which HEX to use since there is nothing under the word ""__TEXT""

Can someone please help with some better step by step directions. Each instruction write-up is slightly different. Thanks."

"
,marcosgr39,2011-10-26T05:00Z,"STEPS TO FOLLOW in ""Crack2012"" application:

1) I wanna crack ""Autocad"";

2) Insert ""666-69696969"" in the serial box, ""777D1"" in the product key box of the activation screen and click ""Next"", then re-insert serial (666-69696969) and check the ""I have an activation code from Autodesk"" box. Finally go to ""Crack2012"" and click ""OK"";

3) Now ""Activity Monitor"" will open up. Find in ""Activity Monitor"" the process named ""Autodesk License Management Utility"" and write in ""Crack2012"" the PID of the process (column all on the left), clicking ""OK"" in ""Crack2012"" when done.

4) Now ""Terminal"" will open up with a lot of lines. Find the line (enlarge the ""Terminal"" window to search properly, or use search function) that begins with ""__TEXT"" and that ends with ""â€¦libFNP.dylib"" and write in ""Crack2012"" the FIRST of the two HEX numbers that are in that line (the two numbers are separated by a minus (-) sign). For example in the line ""__TEXT [â€¦] 11111111-00000000 [â€¦] libFNP.dylib"" you should write ""11111111"" in ""Crack2012"" box. When done click ""OK"" in Crack2012.
"
,marcosgr39,2011-10-26T05:01Z,"5) Now you will be asked to insert your user password in ""Terminal"". Do it and you will see other lines go fast on the screen. When they stop, click ""OK"" in Crack2012.

6) Now other lines will go fast on the screen and ""xforce2012"" application will be launched automatically. Click the ""Mem Patch"" button on the application, wait for other ""Terminal"" lines to go fast on the screen and when they stop click ""OK"" in ""Crack2012"".

7) Other lines will go fast on the screen and now you should receive a message from ""xforce2012"" application and from ""Crack2012"" file that patching was SUCCESSFUL. Click ""OK"" in both messages.

8) Copy the ""request code"" from activation screen to the ""xforce2012"" application and click on ""Generate"" to generate the ""activation code"" to paste in the activation screen. Paste the ""activation code"" in the activation screen (it's shorter than expected, but it's OK, because you have patched program's memory). When done click ""Next"" and then ""Finish""."
