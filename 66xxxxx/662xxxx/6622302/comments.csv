,fasurvivor,2011-08-22T19:06Z,any chance of The Matrix Trilogy?
,fasurvivor,2011-08-22T19:20Z,"I was looking for Resident Evil Quadrology and then I found your upload but there are many complains about no sound.
any idea?

Resident Evil Apocalyse Extended Edition(5 min longer)"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-08-22T19:49Z,"""any chance of The Matrix Trilogy? ""
Lol, yesterday evening I began doing them ;-)
multi lang & subs."
,Night_89,2011-08-22T20:09Z,"I also have a request if possible for you to upload

Underworld Trilogy"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-08-22T20:17Z,"Resident Evil 1,2,3,4 BDRip 1080p Eng Fra Hun Ita Spa [mkvonly] 

It's clear in description but superficial people don't read;

""Audio Tracks are all demuxed, so download the ones you want.
Use MPC (htt...cccp-project.net/) to automatically recognize & play
the external Audio tracks or mux the Audio in MKV with  mkvmerge
(ht...MKVtoolnix) if you wish to use other player.""

Who want to download all the 25 file?

They don't realize what a favour I did for them to give the option to download exactly what they want, like in a self-service salad-bar ;-)
"
,fasurvivor,2011-08-22T20:23Z,"thanks for the matrix trilogy

A request

During encoding please consider such bitrate that a movie (i.e. The Matrix) is converted with in the size of 4.38 GB (DVD-R) with a DTS sound of English
and if not possible, convert it with the size that can be split and burned in 2xDVD-R (i.e. 7 GB, 6.8 GB, 7.5 GB, 8.5 GB etc.)
not with a size that confuses everyone during burning (i.e. 4.4 GB, 5 GB. 8.8 GB etc.)

and this is only a humble request"

Sir, I love your uploads but never saw a complain in your torrents except one that`s why I was little confused, but as of now you have resolved the problem by answering.
So, thanks"

No ""Underworld"" Trilogy, sorry but I had enough of vampires ;-)
why don't you go for these:

True Blood  2008-  Seasons 1 & 2 BDRip 1080p Eng Fra Ita Spa [mkvonly]
True Blood Season 3 BDRip 1080p Eng Fre Spa multisub [mkvonly] 

By the way your comment at ""Hellboy Duology (2004, 2008) 1080p multi [mkvonly]"" was kinda weird. I can't believe you like ""Underworld"" more then Hellboy, but c'est la vie. I personally thought ""Hellboy""-s are some of the best movies in it's genre.

@fasurvivor
I encode to bitrate (6 MB/s for 1080p/1080 16/9 AR & 5.3 MB/s for 1080/800 etc.). I don't ruin a video quality just to fit a DVD.
It's sad how some rippers ( PS3-TEAM  ) make all movies 4 GB no matter how long the movies are, so a 2 H movie will result in a much more inferior quality then a 1H 30 min movie."
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-08-22T22:46Z,"please stop rating the torrent (+ & -) if you haven't seen yet the movies.
Leave a comment (after you saw the movies ) instead of a click, don't be lazy ;-)
The rating system on this tracker is worthless and shouldn't be taken in account."
,fasurvivor,2011-08-23T02:34Z,"No Underworld
that`s sad but would wait till the 4th part comes and you may make your mind to encode it
I am replacing my whole 720p collection with yours 1080p uploads (my system doesn`t handle 1080p but yours, I don`t know why, it plays fine)
so, thanks for that as well"
,Night_89,2011-08-23T09:19Z,Del Torro's imagination is a beautiful thing. He has created some of the most fascinating creatures that traditional Hollywood doesn't have the guts or inclination to ever assemble.
,Night_89,2011-08-23T09:21Z,Hellboy is no exception and it has a great dark comic book atmosphere.
,Night_89,2011-08-23T09:22Z,"Too bad that the story and most of the characters don't really work out the way they're supposed to.

So,
""Visually it's outstanding, Mentally it's mediocre,"" or, ""Quite stylish but somewhat disappointing movie"""
,fasurvivor,2011-08-24T02:47Z,"@Night_89
Who gives the fuck either movie is good or bad? It is uploaded and being seeded well and that`s the point
&
What the hell are you doing by posting your Hellboy comments in hancock?

Will Smith is best"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-08-24T10:24Z,"Thx fasurvivor, Will Smith is ne of my favorites too ;-)"
,Karnadas,2011-10-14T20:30Z,"I'm at 100.00% but it's apparently still missing something and I've been here for a while with no seeders. 0kb/s download, 80kb/s upload :(

Will keep seeding for a while after I finish if someone helps me out :)"
,joecol69,2011-10-27T20:33Z,"So just to clarify, english audio is already in and working? no need to mux? I know i know stupid question already been addressed a few times. but the one person said there was no audio, and another said ALL the audio was separate, and in the files there is no separate english"
,damin26,2011-10-31T15:34Z,"thanks for the amazing torrents.....!
when i try to open the file, i get the following message: ""A decoder for the new track could not be found. Track type: VobSub"" and eventually the video cannot play... I am using Bs Player. Can somebody please help me fix this issue? Thanks! :)"
