,Lastxeno,2011-08-21T19:48Z,Will be downloading this tonight and seeding :)
,Oranjestr,2011-08-21T21:26Z,"Me too, the other torrent didn't work that well for me so I hope this one will be better."
,jerodar,2011-08-21T22:16Z,"@orangjestr: did yours freeze as well at the cinematic after the fight with the second faces mechon?
Anyhow, sloooowly downloading this one as well, hopefully it'll work."
,jerodar,2011-08-22T16:08Z,"Had the same problem with this, so I guess it'll work for most other people since my freeze is independant on the ISO.
Just going to buy the game now, it's worth it after that 10 hour ""demo"" :p"
,TheDutch888,2011-08-22T19:41Z,"The size of this game is 7.93 GB, but i jst have got 4,7Gb dvd's. Waht have i to do?"
,shippoukitsune,2011-08-22T21:12Z,"@TheDutch888
Get a dual layer dvd"
,drex906,2011-08-23T00:19Z,"@jerodar

Do you know any way to get around the freeze? Ive been getting it with every single torrent I have tried and its driving me nuts.  Same point as u with this and the other torrent.  Have you heard of people not having this problem? Or is it all thee torrents are the same broken ISO?"
,drex906,2011-08-23T00:31Z,"@jerodar
Is the freeze a comon problem with people?  Is it a broken ISO cuz I am also having the same problem at the same point in the game."
,caspertheking13,2011-08-23T15:49Z,"@drex, the freeze problem might be your Disc Drive in the wii (if this is the problem you're reffering too) itm ight be a bit brooken and cannot run dual layer disc's good. i read somewhere that if you can run Super Smash Bros brawl fine and perfectly this game shouldn't give you any problems. otherwise you have to send your Wii too Nintendo, they'll fix 'm for free :P open your wii and get your wiikey out of there though, otherwise it's gone ;)"
,ruibo,2011-08-23T21:17Z,does this work on a ntsc wii?
,jaaprx,2011-08-23T21:58Z,"The two ISOs has the same freeze problem??
No ISO around the world extracted delicately with love?
There's no other game we can play now? I finished Zelda Twilight Princess thousand times!!! Dragon Quest also finished!!! Now I'm playing LEGO shits!!!!
Arrrrrrrggggggggg!!!!"
,mondo,2011-08-23T21:59Z,"Anyone that have tried burning the game on a DL-dvd and played it using a PAL-Wii with Wiikey 1 chip?
I hardly ever use my Wii but this game seems to be a game that I would like to play, but I doesn´t have a USB-disc to install a softmod on, so I would like to know if it works to burn it on a DL-disc and if it plays fine on a Wiikey 1 machine"
,SpitvenoM,2011-08-24T01:48Z,"@mondo

Why dont you try it and let people know. I have a wiikey 1 but i am using wiiflow to play it dont see why it wouldnt work but then i have'nt really kept up to date on wiikey compatibility."
,PPierce34,2011-08-24T06:52Z,"@ruibo No, PAL doesn't work on an NTSC Wii, BUT I found this and am currently downloading. It claims that you can convert the PAL version to NTSC. Lotta pieces to dl but I'm gonna try it and I'll report back.

,Raikkonen94,2011-08-24T07:42Z,Can I anyone confirm that this is working on a PAL Wii with USB Loader??
,mondo,2011-08-24T11:09Z,"@SpitvenoM
I just wanted to know if I should do anything special with the ISO before burning it since it is a DVD9. I have only burned and played DVD5 games before.
But I will buy a couple of dvd´s to test burn it and see if it works..."
,caspertheking13,2011-08-24T14:06Z,"damn @ everyone. 

I burned it at 4x to a dual layer disc, the damn thing loads up. i get the screen of monolith and then when i press start i get the reading disc error. or it says reding disc forever :S "
,steelllynx,2011-08-24T21:08Z,"softmod is the way to go.  I have a 320 GB verbatim 2.5"" usb drive with 86 games on it and 100 GB to go.   When it fills up I'll just delete some of the crappy games (plenty of those to choose from).  Games load faster than from DVD and it doesn't tear up my optical drive.  Another bonus with the softmod is the ability to run emulators for most of the older systems.

Downloading this now, let you know how it runs with USB loader."
,Zeptinune,2011-08-24T22:54Z,"On top of that, this is 8GB... there's a DDL on 'Devils-Shadow' that's only 6.50GB and a thread there with fucking 866 Wii .iso 's.

As if you'd use torrents."
,Zeptinune,2011-08-24T22:56Z,"P.S. This doesn't work on NTSC lol, few of my friends tried.. it doesn't load. Either boots back to Wii menu or just black screens forever. You can't 'frii' this disc to NTSC lol. Games only 'Frii' to PAL, not the other way around."
,PPierce34,2011-08-25T00:28Z,Reporting back. Files from the link I posted have been removed before I finished downloading all the parts. I'm guessing Zeptinune is correct and you can't convert PAL to NTSC so it wouldn't have worked anyway. Just have to wait until Nintendo of America releases the game over here...
,Raikkonen94,2011-08-25T07:35Z,"I'm from PAL region, so I am really happy that we get this one (A)

But my downloadspeed is like really slowww, so seeeeed please :)"
,paper_planes,2011-08-25T13:46Z,"Works great with USB loader, thankyou"

,305gamerz,2011-08-27T20:01Z,You guys want a smaller size of this game intact??? English Voices and English Subtitles To fit on DVD 5 Format :) I dont know why piratebay won't let me upload it but here is my link. http://www.kat.ph/xenoblade-chronicles-pal-dvd5-4-5gb-iso-t5775046.html -Have fun and enjoy bitches! !!!Remember to rate & Comment!!!
,chen123,2011-08-28T00:48Z,"I just got it onto a memorex DL dvd, and when I put it in my wii, it says unable to read disc. My wii is modded and can run every other game, it even ran super smash bros brawl in japanese... how come I can't run this game? can someone help me?"
,305gamerz,2011-08-28T01:21Z,"TO: Chen213, I believe that the Wii's that were made after 2010 aren't capable of playing DL backups... You'd have to download it and put it on a flashdrive or external hard drive and if you have neither then download mine... I spend a hell of a long time decoding this shit to fir a standard DVD and it works great with Neogamma... :) http://www.kat.ph/xenoblade-chronicles-pal-dvd5-4-5gb-iso-t5775046.html The whole game is intact nothing missing except the other languages... The entire game is in ENGLISH! :) Later dude"
,uzirapist,2011-08-28T04:33Z,is this game in english because im not fluent in japanese
,chen123,2011-08-28T09:53Z,i bought my wii when it first came out... and it was modded with a mod chip. I'm just trying to figure out how I can play this game :(
,titi831,2011-08-28T18:24Z,Thank you so much it works perfectly on USBLoaderGx! 
,titi831,2011-08-28T18:26Z,"And yes, the game is in ENGLISH(you can choose between english and japanese). And because my wii is in french, I also have French subtitles!"
,uzirapist,2011-08-29T00:59Z,"@titi831 awsome its in english heard this is a good game  

@ chen123 get wiiflow or some kind of usb loader to play your game you can also use dvds "
,PPierce34,2011-08-29T23:12Z,"OMG! There's never been a game I wanted to play before that wasn't NTSC so I never even tried with USB Loader GX. Well all you have to do is go to settings and change it to ""Force NTSC"". I just found out I can play this on my NTSC Wii and I'm quite happy!!!"
,harrybish,2011-08-30T12:24Z,"@chen123

Memorex DVDs wont work on the wii. I made the mistake of buying a load of Memorex dvds for my wii only to discover that they wont work. You can find a list of all the different types of DVDs that will or wont work."
,wizard2121,2011-08-31T00:47Z,totally untrue ^^^^^ staring at four of my burned wii games with imgburn they are all memorex DVD-R
,chen123,2011-08-31T02:41Z,"i'm using cfg usb loader right now, and i can only read the game in black and white.... if i burn it on a different dvd instead of memorex dvds, (let's say verbatim dvds) will it restore it's color?"
,jblaze55,2011-09-01T07:52Z,can someone please make this game in a smaller size...or just the wfbs...maybe seed bc this thing is taking forever and i really want to play this game...thanks 
,majuaraan,2011-09-03T15:19Z,dont listen to @harrybish ive play plenty of games on the wii on memorex sl and dl discs
,wishmasteruk,2011-09-06T12:25Z,"hi chen123
try force ntsc in settings its black and white because its different region for your tv"
,ivanhoe68,2011-09-08T13:42Z,Works really good with wii emulator Dolphin 3.0 and a xbox 360 controller =) And with the emulator you can enjoy FULL HD! And enhanced graphics. Try it out
,taarna23,2011-09-09T20:48Z,"I had a bad time with Memorex DVDs as well, thought admittedly the Memorex dual-layers always served me well. I've always done the soft-mod approach, and when loading times for Metroid: Other M off DVD started getting crazy slow, I got an external hard drive and never looked back. No more coasters. =3"
,NoMoreVIP,2011-09-13T20:02Z,Hi all i have i question and is what is the layer Break on this game?
,d33pak001,2011-09-16T11:33Z,"can i play this one on the pc.
I really want to play this.."
,pewpew,2011-09-17T16:32Z,Does this game require IOS 4.3?  I have 4.2 softmodded and this game won't launch from either USB Loader GX or NeoGamma (latest versions of both) even after forcing NTSC.  So do I have to update to 4.3 to get this to run?
,pewpew,2011-09-17T19:05Z,"Never mind - to answer my own question, I did not need to update to system 4.3.  What I did need to do was follow this guide: 

http://www.joystiq.com/2011/08/19/how-to-play-xenoblade-chronicles-if-you-live-in-america/

basically install IOS236, then install D2X per the settings in that guide and it was all good.  Oh and I did set force NTSC and select IOS 248 in USB Loader settings. "
,jackisdead,2011-09-17T19:39Z,"This game is awesome, i'm on 46hours and still totally hooked! "
,hbhb123,2011-09-21T18:40Z,This game is a insult to Wii. The Graphs are a SHI7.

,VeteranD13,2011-09-26T03:58Z,"Great game,but it's sad that Final Fantasy X looks better than this.Anyway phenomenal game.I'm playing on the Dolphin emulator.

 A word to Nintendo of America>Screw you!"
,DesertFlame,2011-10-07T00:04Z,"@hbhb123 Oh god, you're joking right? Its graphics are some of the best I've seen on the Wii. Graphics aren't just the look of something; it’s also the scale and content. The scales of the maps in the game are HUGE and substantially bigger than Monster Hunter Tri that focuses more on looks than size and even though one section is bigger than like 2 entire levels in MH3 the looks are gorgeous, still adding Water falls, grass, trees, and lakes.  So Lrn2graphics before dissing such a fucking amazing game."
,rolosdad,2011-10-13T15:56Z,could someone please give some help on setting up 360pad to work with this game..tried all settings on dolphin but just cant get it right..doing my fucking head in now.:(

,Pinkdott,2011-11-24T15:28Z,"@hbhb

ya know.. read the reviews
IGN, Gamespot, Metacritic, Game Informer...
all refer to this as THE BEST and MOST IMPORTANT RPG OF THIS GENERATION!!.... and I agree!!...
That means to laymen like you.... Best RPG on all 3 systems. I am sure the reason this is not ""out"" in America is that they are going to give it the HD treatment, and online play and make this a WIIU launch title"
,Unstoppable_bender,2011-11-30T19:35Z,"Notable: Just received C and D on behalf of DMCA from my ISP. Odd since the game is NOT EVEN SOLD IN THE U.S.

,iamchrislechat,2012-01-16T05:37Z,you can try using cfg usb loader for starters since it has never let me down then go check out http://gwht.wikidot.com/ and make sure you have the latest IOS' installed
