The idea here was to collect the torrents of all things Grateful Dead. There should be a torrent in here for everything that has been officially released and a few things that haven't (like torrents for all the soundboard concert recordings that can be found here on TPB). Most everything is at least 320kbps and some are FLAC. A few notes:

-There are multiple versions of some items. You don't need both. Just pick the bitrate you want and download that.

-Some torrents have multiple releases in the torrent. I've listed the ones that will complete in the name of the file. Use a client that allows you to select which files to skip and which to get.

-Very few of the video torrents have seeds. This part is going to be trial and error sorry.

-I may update this in the future. I took the time to figure out the bit rates of everything so if you have a suggestion I just ask that you do the same. Just leave a link, the bit rate and whether or not the torrent has seeds.
