[DESCRIPTION.]:
Series in which British families, keen to trade in the British
weather for the down-under lifestyle, are given the chance to
sample what life would be like if they moved to the other side
of the world.
The Wall family from Nottinghamshire experience life for a
week in Perth. In the UK, Paul works as a carpenter, but he's
been hit by the credit crunch. His wife Angela juggles two
jobs to make ends meet. They're worried about son Dylan's
prospects in the UK, as he's dyslexic. Life is a struggle for the
family, and a move down under might be the solution. But
could the financial reality of life in Australia put an end to their
dreams?

Enjoy!
