Tours" of Europe and part of the UCI World Ranking calendar.
The race lasts three weeks and attracts cyclists from around
the world. The race is broken into day-long segments, called
stages. Individual times to finish each stage are totalled to
determine the overall winner at the end of the race. The rider
with the lowest aggregate time at the end of each day wears
the Red Jersey.
