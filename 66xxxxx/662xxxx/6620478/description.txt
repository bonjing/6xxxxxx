Since I couldn't find any widescreen encodes of this show in English, I decided to make them myself. I used a French widescreen source, and muxed the English audio with it. The only difference is that the logo and credits are now in French, but the quality is much better than any other English encode of this show.

See some comparison screenshots here:
Left are 4:3 English encodes, on the right are mine.
