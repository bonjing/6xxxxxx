One type of workshop may not suit every woodworkerâ€”after all, a turner has different needs than a furniture makerâ€”but one guide is just right for telling every woodworker how to set up the perfect shop. WoodÂ® Magazine provides ideal standards for work flow, machine space, electric power, lighting, ventilation, dust control, and other factors. More than 250 well-illustrated pages present advice on choosing the right space, checking for adequate electricity, customizing a room, heating systems, security in the shop, noise protection, and eyewear options. Plus, thereâ€™s coverage of workbenches, from drop-lead to full service; stools, stands, and supports; shop cabinet craftsmanship; special storage needs; and easy racks, holders, and organizers. A Selection of the F & W Book Club.
