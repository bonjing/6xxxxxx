From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with Gatewood Galbraith, who is running as an Independent in the Kentucky governor's race this year. Galbraith is running against a â€œculture of corruptionâ€ in the state and will talk to Alex about the economic situation and the bankster plan to bankrupt the states. Mr. Galbraith ran as a Democrat in 1991 and 1995, but left the establishment party because â€œthey froze us out of the Party and didnâ€™t allow our views to be heard or considered.â€ He is convinced neither of the two establishment parties can fix the political problems in the state. 

Alex also covers the latest breaking news on Libya and the economy.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
