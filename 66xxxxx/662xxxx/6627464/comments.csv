,jh5637,2011-08-25T00:14Z,"@ Master-Q - Thanx, just wanted to give back some of what I've enjoyed all these years.  BTW, can you give me some feedback as to whether this worked for you? For some reason the torrent never started seeding on my uTorrent client.  I've read thru all the how-to's and walk-thru's...aarrgghh....so is this working for anyone?"
,Master-Q,2011-08-25T07:11Z,"@jh5637 
delete the torrent in client not the files offcause. then downĂŚoad the file from here  and to your client and it should start.
i can see we are severel people waiting for it to start.

keep it up"

Well, did as you instructed and still not seeding...this is weird, I've tried to follow every tutorial I've come across to the dot...maybe it's just an ID-10_T error on my part...LOL"
