Okay...I fudged up the other torrent so here goes again.  I compressed this one a little bit in order to save some space.  Any tips would be appreciated:

Windows 7 x64 bit sp1. I downloaded the the Windows 7 Ultimate x64 ISO file and deleted the file that limits you to only 

pick from one version then used a dell win 7 boot image to make it bootable.  If anyone needs the links on instructionals 

I can also provide these.

This has Windows 7 x64 Starter/Basic/Premium/Professional/Ultimate
PLEASE NOTE THIS IS !!!!NOT 

CRACKED!!!! it's for people who want to do fresh installs. 

I work for a lil pc shop and needed something like this. Your 

product key will activate all the right features for your version.


Long time leecher, first time seeder...so let me know 

what you guys think.  Comments and tips are appreciated.

it's ISO format!!!


1)Download .rar file and extract .iso file using WinRAR or similar program

2)Extract .iso file and then burn onto DVD 
using a program like IMGBurn

3)Put into optical drive and restart PC.

!!!!NOT CRACKED AND please NOTE that a valid KEY is 

NEEDED!!!!

Will post link to x86 version after I create it.
