The bowl is one of the most traditional forms, but contemporary artists who work in wood understand that it has tremendous potential. These 500 exquisite examples, many by pioneering artisans, show just how much the bowl has been â€œreinventedâ€ by craftpeople all over the world as both an iconic object and as a departure for self-expression. On display are a wide range of woodworking approaches, from chisel to chainsaw to router to bandsaw. Some have carvings on the suface; others feature paint and mixed media; while many more stay close to what nature provided, with the wood simply sanded and sealed. The talented creators include James Prestini, Bob Stocksdale, Rude Osolnik, Mel Lindquist, Ed Moulthrop, Mark Lindquist, David Ellsworth, and William Hunter.
