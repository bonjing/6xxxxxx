[T],jerry7_57,2011-08-23T21:37Z,why doesn't the sample play
,Chadly,2011-08-23T23:30Z,"Sample wouldnt play in media player for me but did work with VLC player. Looked alright, abit dark.If you dont mind abit of darkness and if you cant wait I think its watchable.

For a cam i give 6V and 7A... compared to dvd lol I give it a 2 maybe 3 all around lol Peace an love :) Thanks bone, good enough for me, for now :)"
,pinzmoo,2011-08-24T00:27Z,sample looks like a touched up version of the same horrible source will recomment when DL is done.
,SomeGuy2005,2011-08-24T01:02Z,"Thank god tat some uploaders still bother to post sample images of cam movies, appreciate it!"
,pinzmoo,2011-08-24T04:31Z,"Prolly the best copy out atm, dark parts are still alittle too dark but as for the blur thats all gone 

may just be on my end but the movie didn't like my bass settings so not sure if its my speakers or the files audio.

worst TS i've ever downloaded the sound is just as bad if not worse than recording on the camcorder itself."

,JoeySix,2011-08-31T02:03Z,ya the sound for this is terrible... video is a bit dark but its ok for a cam... but the sound makes it impossible to watch ... thanks for the attempt .Bone will wait for a better copy
