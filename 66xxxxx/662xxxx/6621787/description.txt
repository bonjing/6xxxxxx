This is the classic 1984 Frank Zappa album, Them Or Us. As there is no
really good version out there -- the EMI CD is by far the best, but even
that sounds really flat and lifeless -- I decided to create one.

This is the version with Sinister Footwear II fixed. Yesterday's upload has some discontinuities in that track.

Track listing:
1. The Closer You Are  (2:57)
2. In France  (3:31)
3. Ya Hozna  (6:27)
4. Sharleena  (4:29)
5. Sinister Footwear II  (8:38)
6. Truck Driver Divorce  (8:50)
7. Stevie's Spanking  (5:23)
8. Baby, Take Your Teeth Out  (1:54)
9. Marqueson's Chicken  (7:35)
10. Planet Of My Dreams  (1:38)

12. Them Or Us  (5:08)
13. Frogs With Dirty Little Lips  (2:43)
