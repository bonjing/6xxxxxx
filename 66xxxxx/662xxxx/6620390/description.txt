In the same bright, open design as the well-received Ceramics for Beginners: Hand Building, this second entry in the series offers an introduction to the mechanics of wheel-thrown ceramics. Artist Emily Reason takes the beginner ceramist through nine projects, starting from one of two fundamental forms (cylinder or bowl).  Color bands throughout point the reader to related information on various techniques, while gallery sections provide inspiration.
