,Arizona-Ash,2011-08-24T17:54Z,Does this mean the Clonedvd version on this site is legit?
,Torx8,2011-08-24T17:56Z,why would you upload this when there isn't even a crack for it yet (that i know of anyway)? if you got the crack then upload that too..
,Xe1887,2011-08-24T17:56Z,Fake
,Kildras,2011-08-24T17:58Z,"yes, the clonedvd had always been legit.  
It's just there is no crack and it was in russian (through the chinese team said it has been confirmed there are eng file inside)"
,ninjanutta,2011-08-24T17:59Z,"just as useless as all the deus ex torrents before it,hope everyone knows that this game has some serious security that is showing to be a right bitch to crack.Dont be too suprised if your waiting for a long time for a scene release."
,AdrenaLiNv2,2011-08-24T17:59Z,"to upload this to a single peer @40kb/s it would take 34 minutes, so concentrate on one peer with a higher upload capacity so we can download from it, otherwise it would take forever."
,Kyerzak,2011-08-24T17:59Z,"Hum.. how can i use this? if i install the game in polish, can i afterwards change the language to english with this file?"
,AdrenaLiNv2,2011-08-24T18:03Z,lol
,qazaq1981,2011-08-24T18:05Z,"english file size  873 891 840
why here's differ?"
,Cucumber06,2011-08-24T18:11Z,Thank u
,Dark1lla,2011-08-24T18:15Z,ye but still no crack :(
,ogrec,2011-08-24T18:15Z,"yup, that clone dvd is legit, you just have to use phoenix to unpack it and wait for crack"
,elibom,2011-08-24T18:19Z,Baah the comments arent working
,OkNeTt,2011-08-24T18:19Z,.
,GrimyGhost,2011-08-24T18:21Z,think im just gonna wait for a trusted uploader... chances are a crack wont eve nwork with the current releases..
,OkNeTt,2011-08-24T18:22Z,"Why is it taking so long to crack it? I mean, it's just another steam protected game..."
,qazaq1981,2011-08-24T18:25Z,wtf
,Darkoil,2011-08-24T18:25Z,!7 comments and i cant even read them on my own torrent.
,Neoncillo,2011-08-24T18:27Z,"The Clonedvd one is the Beta version. It's for the ALI213 version which is in RU/PL version, but there is no crack yet"
,Gripen221122,2011-08-24T18:30Z,"To all you saying its fake, you're retarded.
This file is simply the english langue file for those who DLed the RUS/PL torrent version before the ENG version was out."
,Darkoil,2011-08-24T18:30Z,"Fucking comments,  reyt i unpacked the russian/pol torrent and it was missing this file so i got this from a different torrent website. I also got a english clone dvd that i unpacked with pheonix and it already had the english bigfile 00 in it. If this doesn't work properly when the game is cracked i could always upload the second one i have."
,charlie19866,2011-08-24T18:31Z,1
,XIRee,2011-08-24T18:33Z,"Chances are, a crack will work PERFECTLY for this type of release. Anyone who says it won't obviously don't know anything about this type of release..."
,Arizona-Ash,2011-08-24T18:41Z,"Wait a sec, the Clonedvd release is the same size as all the ''fakes'', so maybe the fakes are actual skidrow releases,i mean you cant really know cuz skidrow blocked their site with a stupid survey"
,knox666,2011-08-24T18:45Z,Mayby the pirates make cash deals with game companies not to crack or pirate the games for a few days after release. ??? Mayby. 
,Kronical4,2011-08-24T18:46Z,"SkidRow, and Reloaded prob got payed off to hold the game from being cracked."
,Kronical4,2011-08-24T18:48Z,"@knox666 

It for sure does happen."
,AdrenaLiNv2,2011-08-24T19:43Z,If you want to play this game so bad without waiting for a crack look for some tutorials online how to crack a game and make your own freakin crack.
,Phroster,2011-08-24T19:50Z,actually anyone tried getting this too work?
,Phroster,2011-08-24T19:56Z,someone actually tried making this work?
,Boppa86,2011-08-24T20:12Z,Thank you for this.
,blacklabel67k,2011-08-24T20:19Z,"Anyone who's bitching about others who want a crack should shut the fuck up. You're just as bad as them, if not worse. You're taking their comments to literally, they are just expressing their excitement for the game and you come off as a douche when you slander them.

As for this download, it's going way to slow. I've uploaded 1.3gbs already. Hope everyone is doing the same."

I LOLD SO HARD"
,Bersercker,2011-08-24T20:48Z,"Btw, where do i put this file?"
,Whobuysgames,2011-08-24T20:54Z,"maybe Skidrow and Reloaded, have, i dunno A JOB? maybe a life outside cracking for you appreciators. not to mention each crack is different. give it a couple days, it was a tuesday release anyway."
,HeroinHer0,2011-08-24T21:00Z,This is taking too long....i might just buy the freaking game.   JK You are not winning Square Enikksu
,Grimscythe,2011-08-24T21:06Z,"@whobuysgames

+1"
,HeroinHer0,2011-08-24T21:36Z,Nah they definitely don't have anything better to do if they spend the time learning C++ and stuff to make cracks.  They aren't being paid to do it so its out of boredom since they don't have something else to do for fun. lol
,AdrenaLiNv2,2011-08-24T21:45Z,"We're all at 50% now, my share ration is above 1.5 lol."

,number1mn,2011-08-24T21:56Z,"Since I have a habit of screwing things up, where specifically does this file go?"
,Darkoil,2011-08-24T22:27Z,"Use phoenix 1.4 to unpack the sim file to a folder of your choice, then just pop this file in that same folder and then just twiddle ya thumbs till a crack comes out."
,kinapuffar,2011-08-24T22:31Z,@knox666 That's not how you spell 'Maybe'.
,knox666,2011-08-24T23:04Z,"@ whobuysgames I was not being rude or hateful that's why I wrote mayby. Because anything is possible so just because you want to be a naive sheep good for you, But yeah if Ubisoft offered me a few grand to put my cracking abilities(I dont have any) on hold I would accept it and wait. It is a very plausible sitituation. And I did not name names I was very general in my comment as I said pirates. So sorry if I hurt the hero whorship I was just saying is all. :/"
,knox666,2011-08-24T23:06Z,@ Kinnapuffar Thank for being the grammar nazi because I was trying real hard to win a pulitzer prize on the pirate bay. :/ Mayby maybe not. :)
,knox666,2011-08-24T23:10Z,"Or mayby I like spelling words the way I prononce them being a nova scotian and all. So take dat there boi,eh! ;)"
,WildGaren,2011-08-24T23:44Z,"Bitchin' and trollin' aside..

Can anyone confirm this file swap does work and gives English subs and audio?"

Can anyone confirm that this file swap does indeed give English subs and audio?

Thanks."
,blacklabel67k,2011-08-25T01:06Z,"@knox

Dude, if they knew who they were why would they offer them money? Makes zero sense, just think about it. 

I don't know the laws wherever they're from, but I think they'd be more likely to file a lawsuit or have them arrested for doing something extremely illegal. (at least here in the US).

If I had to guess it's either

A. The code is just hard to crack

or

B. They enjoy Deus Ex games and want to support the developers by waiting. Doing that will force people who really want to play it to go out and purchase it."
,kimjongwil,2011-08-25T01:08Z,"to all the people who think the cracker groups were paid off by the big companies: are you all retarded? i'm pretty sure once they entered into negotiations there would be no way to guarantee that the groups wouldn't crack it under a different name, it might not be the right crackers, the companies would sue the crackers or have them arrested, and any other options. you guys are fucking stupid. skidrow and reloaded and flt are probably working on it as usual but it's just taking some time. "
,rafamolina3,2011-08-25T01:19Z,.
,elessarGObonzo,2011-08-25T02:05Z,maybe you're all fucking retarded and they're sitting back laughing at all of you as you type
,knox666,2011-08-25T03:21Z,I even knew my comment was a what if could be I never said they actually were. Relax and watch the name calling. Plus I guess some peeps never of heard of pay pal.
,BlkWltz19,2011-08-25T07:07Z,"@ Arizona-Ash (and anyone else who cares...):

I found through using a random proxy and navigating to the skidrow site, you have a split-second to click the download links. I was able to get  through to the download file. Have to mess with proxy settings, and try different ones, doesn't work all the time. Although, they still do not have a crack up yet....so really no use yet"
,Chabs232,2011-08-25T10:02Z,"Knox is a big phat cock suckah!
May the bees of SP swarm your rotten vagina."
,SirDaisy,2011-08-25T10:44Z,"@blacklabel67k
No, my guess is that it will be released on the day of release in Europe. This may not be the case, but I'm going to stand by it.
Also
No code is THIS hard to crack if they've been at it since release, and no they aren't giving the dev's a chance (although they probably did gain sales due to this).
Rest assured I will be buying the game come the 9th, but until then I don't have the money."
,AdrenaLiNv2,2011-08-25T13:16Z,"I hoped SKIDROW could release it one or two days after the official release, but for some reason it didn't happen. And if they didn't do it till now, maybe it'll be done by a week or so. Maybe they're not working on it at all. So I bought it at 50âŹ here in Europe and it's totally worth it. I suggest you do the same, unless you want to check every release scene every day and have your hopes crushed."
,lkymn,2011-08-25T15:01Z,"@adrena

Yeah, I'll be buying too, I really want to support games of this genre and hope companies move out of the CoD hype."
,anuzbitt,2011-08-25T15:27Z,"blacklabel67k@

,Arizona-Ash,2011-08-25T16:09Z,So can someone plz upload the sikdrow version to this site and then we can wait for a crack
,Bersercker,2011-08-25T17:02Z,"I managed to launch the game without any errors with this file, so it seems to be ok. Didn't play yet though, only gone as far as main menu..."
,kaosu,2011-08-25T21:45Z,I'm looking for the a torrent with the bigfiles included without being compressed. I have a few corrupt files that are a few megs away from completion. 
,soolavann,2011-08-26T15:01Z,where do i put the file.
,Darkoil,2011-08-26T16:27Z,"you place this file with the files from the russian/polish relase once they have been unpacked, they are all bigfiles format so they should be easy to spot. Use the files from my other torrent aswell."
