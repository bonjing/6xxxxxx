In the spring of 2005 the Berger Knutsson Spering trio sat down to go thru old tapes from Don Cherry concerts. We picked a handfull of favourite songs and the musicians to play them with: Christer Bothen, Per Tjernberg and Sigge Krantz who all worked with Don, plus a few of our other favourites: Thomas Gustafsson, Mats Oberg and Lars Almqvist. Neneh and Eagle-Eye were our guests on some of the pieces. We recorded in June, mixed in September and proudly released the result, See You In A Minute, on the 10th death anniversary of Don Cherry, October 19 2005. The album consists of See You In A Minute, a suite to and from Don Cherry. Plus eight of the finest songs he used to play. Don's children Neneh and Eagle-Eye is singing on three of them.
