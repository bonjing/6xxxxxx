The Allman Brothers are the band that defines the genre known as southern rock, and "Shades of Two Worlds" is among their best work. While their previous 90's album "Seven Turns" was their comeback album and was very good, "Shades of Two Worlds" has a stronger set of songs and is a more diverse collection. This album is currently out of print in the U.S., but remains a popular favorite among the group's fans.
The group's follow-up to their comeback album is a major step forward, with more mature songs, more improvisation than the group had featured in their work since the early 1970s, and more confidence than they'd shown since Brothers and Sisters. It's all here, from acoustic bottleneck playing ("Come On In My Kitchen") to jazz improvisation ("Kind of Bird"), with the most reflective songwriting ("Nobody Knows") in their history. ~allmusic.com
