The single player game mostly sucks, but there are still hundreds of players on the multiplayer game, with lots of mods and additional content still being created by players.

has all the new online maps for the game. doesnt have dead ep but dead ep is trash and isnt worth playing due to far to many glitches and crashing problems...

day of the zombie i also uploaded and it's HIGHLY compressed making for a faster download using less bandwidth too, and is still the full game. my lotd upload with all the maps is also highly compressed. a 3.23gb download that extracts to 10.3gb worth of stuff.

after finishing a new map im working on and gathering a few new things i'll be uploading a new more updated torrent, but that wont be for a while."
