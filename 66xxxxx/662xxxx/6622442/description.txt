Sarah Jane 30 years, it is usually office \"gray mouse\": works as a secretary in the pharmaceutical corporations, and dreams to rise even a notch above the corporate ladder. Falsified resumes, Sarah can take the top job manager, but - just for one day: more agile colleagues also know how to plot! In a fit of revelations new chief reveals the secret of Sarah artless career: to \"only\" get rid of the five top managers. And then Sarah Jane comes to mind is a very non-trivial background. The girl left only to believe that she is not \"office plankton\" and the innate and ingenious ... a killer.
