,asc11,2011-08-22T02:58Z,"The (purported) fallacies:

PART I. RIGHTâ€“WING FALLACIES
1. CAPITALISM IS NATURAL - Why the market actually depends on government
2. INCENTIVES MATTER - â€¦ except when they donâ€™t
3. THE FRICTIONLESS PLANE FALLACY - Why more competition is not always better
4. TAXES ARE TOO HIGH - The myth of the government as consumer
5. UNCOMPETITIVE IN EVERYTHING - Why international competitiveness doesnâ€™t matter
6. PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY - How the right misunderstands moral hazard

PART II. LEFT-WING FALLACIES
7. THE JUST PRICE FALLACY - The temptation to fiddle with prices, and why it should be resisted
8. THE ""PSYCHOPATHIC"" PURSUIT OF PROFIT - Why making money is not so bad after all
9. CAPITALISM IS DOOMED - Why ""the system"" is unlikely to collapse (despite appearances to the contrary)
10. EQUAL PAY - Why some jobs must suck, in every aspect
11. SHARING THE WEALTH - Why capitalism produces so few capitalists
12. LEVELING DOWN - The wrong way to promote equality"
