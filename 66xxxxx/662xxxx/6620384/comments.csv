Updates OK lanjimsdk

This is the loader application that's used by millions of people worldwide, well known for passing Microsoft's WAT (Windows Activation Technologies) and is arguably the safest Windows activation exploit ever created. The application itself injects a SLIC (System Licensed Internal Code) into your system before Windows boots; this is what fools Windows into thinking it's genuine."
[T],rahulro,2011-08-22T19:55Z,@lanjimsdk: no you can't turn automatic updates on.!

,Heidepirat,2011-09-02T23:07Z,"Authentic Daz ware.
works great."
,DreamerXristosGr,2011-09-14T09:40Z,"+1. Worked for me. I had the windows not genuine problem after I reformated and used some loader. I reformated again after finding this loader by Daz, results? Success!!! Haven't used updates yet, but I will start now choosing my updates. I am a little scared because I had unistalled kb971033 and it installed it self without notice... we will see!"
,MarkP91,2011-09-17T03:49Z,I downloaded used on my computer and now when it starts it gets stuck on the start window. Did microsoft figure out i am a hacked copy?
,joecargo90,2011-09-18T19:34Z,"Those asking if its safe to run windows update with this, the is answer is ""it depends""...

Recent versions of the Daz loader install a unique crack on every system making it impossible for Microsoft to detect or disable it like older versions. 

If you get a ""not genuine"" error after using this, it because of an older previously installed crack that messed with the WAT. 

A clean untouched windows 7 install + this loader is 100% safe (till now, atleast) with all windows updates including kb971033 :)"
,jg4545,2011-09-19T10:35Z,"Hi,
I attempted to install the loader but one of the dialogue's under profile tab said ASUS but I have a Lenovo.
Should I select Lenovo or leave as ASUS?
Thanks guys for any help. I'm stuck right now."
,jg4545,2011-09-19T10:47Z,"Hi,
I ran the loader but in the profile tab it says Asus but I have Lenovo. Do I accept Asus?
Thanks."
,diamond2200,2011-09-21T22:21Z,"Just Downloaded it! I looks great though, I am just waiting for the Windows 7 Ultimate to download.....
Please Pray that it WORKS!!!!"
,ilocano1968,2011-09-29T18:09Z,"works perfect with my windows 7 both 64/32 bit with fresh installation...I verify it using this link: http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/......and works 100% genuine.

thanks a mil"
,la_cross37,2011-10-03T20:26Z,"I'm currently using the 1.6.9 version of loader made by Daz on my windows 7 ultimate 64 bit OS and it's working great. I've installed every single windows update, including a language pack and it's been all good. I'm only downloading this newer version to get, well, a newer version, newer is usually better. I will use this if I need to reinstall windows.

Thank you for the UL!"
,nickopolis1777,2011-10-04T02:59Z,This is totally Awesome I used it on my sons computer that I upgraded. The motherboard and processor along with every other component was upgraded with the exception of the hard drive I figured I'd reused his existing OS but low and behold after 3 months it was flagged as non genuine. Not even 1 minute after I installed this easy to use program everything was once again copacetic with his computer. Thanks for the upload you definitely deserve you pink skull. 
,sgt_schultz,2011-11-22T10:35Z,Is Server 2011 on it's way to be added to this great boot loader ?
