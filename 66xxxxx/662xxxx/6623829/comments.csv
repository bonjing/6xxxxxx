Hrmmm... The only thing I can find that is nearly close to a change log is steam updates and it seems piratebay disables Steam links...

,ummi1987,2011-08-23T13:49Z,"From the official Steam forum:

- Various crash fixes based on user-submitted reports.

- Fix to typographical error in the Memorial Vigil, ""The Skippers""."
,OrangePillow,2011-08-23T18:51Z,"Great! I just installed these updates and wanted to play the game. Guess what, it deleted my saved Profile and now I have to start all over again."
,matthew_rs7,2011-08-25T04:33Z,"The update seems to have worked fine. BUt does anybody know what all these updates are for?

The game has only been out a week or 2 and there are already so many updates?

Also, I went from 1.0r2 to this one. Is that fine? or did I have to update all the others in order?"
,miguelsz3,2011-08-25T11:49Z,"@matthew_rs7 
Just like any other patch its meant to fix bugs... Oh and im pretty sure its a cumulative patch. (As in all previous bug-fixes are included)"
,ummi1987,2011-08-26T14:32Z,"@miguelsz3
Are you planning to upload the sixth patch?"
,miguelsz3,2011-08-26T23:26Z,"@ummi1987
Hrmm? Well of course, as soon as I find it i'll upload it."
,Voordal,2011-08-28T05:01Z,"If you 'lost' your saves after updating, simply go to your saves folder, change the most recent save file (for me, it was B-NODE_ProtoTown03.sav), change it to Profile1.sav, and move it to the Swarm folder thats in the Bastion folder. Done deal. Save locations were changed."
,yetisamas,2011-08-28T19:43Z,"can anyone upload the music, or is there anyway i could extract the music from the gamefiles?"
,Hollow Chest,2011-09-04T22:07Z,The files are unorganized. Prevx and Ad-Aware flag it and won't let me open the files. Then when I let them open they do nothing. Virus or not this is a bad download.
