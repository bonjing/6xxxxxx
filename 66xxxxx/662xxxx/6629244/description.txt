NBA Rules History (XV):
-----------------------

Take a look back at some of the rules changes that have taken place over the years.
(Changes/clarifications implemented prior to season, except where noted) 
-------
1977-78
-------
- If a coach wants to discuss a rule or an interpretation of a rule prior to the start of a period, it will be mandatory for the officials to ask the other coach to be present during the discussion. Previously, the rule only addressed pre-game discussions.
- Any field goal that, in the opinion of the officials is intentionally scored in the wrong basket shall be disallowed.
- The 24-second shot clock shall be reset to 24 seconds on all violations, as well as after a zone warning.
- If the ball enters the basket from below, a violation has occurred.
- Fine increased from $100 to $150 for a player not in the game who does not remain in the vicinity of his teamâ€™s bench during a fight.
- A $25 fine shall be assessed to any player hanging on the rim during pre-game warm-up. 
- Following a missed free throw, it is not necessary for a player to return to the floor with a rebound before attempting to score.
- Following a 20-second timeout, a team may only substitute for the injured player. The opponent may then also substitute one player.
- During the last two minutes of regulation or overtime, if a team requests a timeout immediately after getting possession, they shall have the option of putting the ball into play at midcourt or at the out of bounds spot.
- Any player or coach making intentional contact with an official will be suspended without pay for a minimum of one game. A fine and/or a longer suspension may also result.
- In order to protest the result of a game notice must be sent to the Commissionerâ€™s office within 48 hours after the game. No protests may be filed after midnight of the day of the last game of the regular season.
- If a player is fouled and is subsequently ejected from the game before shooting the free throw(s), he must immediately leave the court and one of his teammates on the floor will be designated by the opposing coach to shoot.
