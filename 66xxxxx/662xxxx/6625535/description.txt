Notes ....: The R4 rental CROSSBOW used was presented in 1:1.78 which isn't the 
            theatrical aspect ratio. Also their disc had AC3 448k which is 
            basically DVD Audio not Blu-Ray.Here's the movie in the correct 
            1:2.40 AR and with DTS Audio as ALL retail releases will be released.
