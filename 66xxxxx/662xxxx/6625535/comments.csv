,hauntnut,2011-08-24T20:08Z,"Just to make everyone aware, this version contains alternate audio dubs of many lines, the same audio that was in the PPV release. The differences are negligible, but if you're a purist when it comes to your ""Scream,"" then all you have to do is download both this and the CROSSBOW version, mux the audio from the CROSSBOW version to this one using mkvmerge (before muxing, be sure to set the audio at a delay of 900ms for proper sync).
