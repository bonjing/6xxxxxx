This a Custom dvd, why?
Because Iâ€™ve downloaded the movie in English and in Spanish, and then extracted the audio of the Spanish movie and added it to the one in English. I also added English subs. I wanted to make things easier for everybody.  :)

Some specifications (I wish I could name a few more):

Language spoken         : English & Spanish.
Subtitles               : English.
Duration                : 2h 16m.
File format             : .ISO
Aspect ratio            : 16:9 (wide screen)


Iâ€™ve included two previews of the same scene in English and Spanish. 
You can use ImgBurn to burn the .iso file to a dvd disc or mount the file with Daemon tools Lite to watch it your computer.


***Once again, this is a CUSTOM dvd. THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL DVD!!!  Please understand the word CUSTOM before you decide to download this movie.  I made this dvd for myself and then I decided to share it.

***The Spanish audio wasnâ€™t synchronized very well (it was like that when I downloaded the movie in Spanish â€“ not my fault), so I had to fix it (cut 20 seconds of audio in Spanish and then add it to the movie and synchronize it again). Now, the audio in Spanish match the movie.

***Iâ€™m telling you what to expect of this CUSTOM dvd, so you wonâ€™t be complaining for the loss 20 seconds of audio in Spanish or a few minor changes.


Seed if you think this torrent is worth it.


Enjoy.
