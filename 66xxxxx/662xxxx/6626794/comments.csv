At first glance I thought this was like the past Ultra torrents that really didn't include the Ultra version of Beat Hazard. When BeatHazard.exe is booted up the first time, it may not look like Ultra version, but it does create a shortcut on the desktop that adds additional parameters to the launch.

You only get Beat Hazard Ultra if you launch through the shortcut, not through BeatHazard.exe.

Imagine my surprise when Gigundo fucking Worm Boss comes on screen from out of nowhere and blows me to Narnia."

,Pezomi,2011-10-22T00:24Z,"running this on a 64-bit computer, runs amazing. It's a great game and deserves more attention. I recommend playing some UKF Dubstep in it, AMAZING!

*also my mcafee AV didn't find any viruses in it."

,nowhere-man,2012-02-20T20:46Z,"Malwarebytes detected that the NFOviewer.exe file was actually Malware.Packer.Krunchy and had to be quarantined.  Stop putting malware in your files!  Also, why is online play disabled?"
,MrTokie69,2012-04-08T09:26Z,"Downloads and installs fine, but when the game opens, it always crashes right after language select. This happens on both the Ultra version and Classic"
,AlauraLeafLoveless,2012-04-14T22:39Z,"nowhere-man, they don't, just antivirus's are fucked up to where they think torrents and things like these are virus's"
,Razer1103,2012-06-05T11:05Z,"I know you guys are saying that anti-virus will flag this because it's cracked software, blah blah, but wouldn't you expect someone trying to get malware on your system to make you feel safe, even if it's not? There is no reason for them NOT to lie about it. They want control over your system, plain and simple. 

Today, the nfoviewer.exe tried executing itself for absolutely NO REASON. I wasn't even near the file, thankfully Malwarebytes caught it, and I quarantined it. Unfortunately, I won't be seeding anymore. :( Sorry.

There is no reason nfoviewer.exe should be flagged anyway, is there?"
