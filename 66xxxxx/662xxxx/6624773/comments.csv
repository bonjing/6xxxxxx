,itzjaake,2011-08-26T13:24Z,"This sounds really, really good, and even if it isn't legit, what is there to lose?
There are no viruses, and you've got some kick ass music.
& Props to the guy who made this, if it is fake. But I'm certain it isn't.
10/10"
,Raapzaad,2011-08-26T22:59Z,"I have no idea how jimmy already got this, but it's real :D Unless jimmy can impersonate the peppers real good.

IT'S REAL YOU GUYS! THE NEW PEPPERS ALBUM! THREE DAYS OF WAITING? NO! GET IT NOW. IT'S AWESOME!"
,eklxtreme,2011-08-27T16:09Z,"he uploaded it only a week from it's release date, so that means the album leaked and he got it and ULed it."

,slomka111,2011-10-01T22:16Z,How come rhcp i`m with you torrents dissapeared from web today?

,thoughtcriminalz,2011-11-16T07:24Z,"Torrent is real, but let me save you some time: This album sucks!! John left the band and there is no chemistry or actual songwriting with the new guitarist. I didn't think it was possible, but yes RHCP put out a totally, completely garbage album.

Shaking my head in disbelief and I just deleted it as soon as a I listened all the way through."
,thoughtcriminalz,2011-11-16T09:19Z,ok well I didn't delete track 3 which is very good. But it still doesn't make up for the other 13 songs. RHCP is not RHCP w/o Frusciante
,fuzzybrain,2012-01-19T19:21Z,give it away now...
