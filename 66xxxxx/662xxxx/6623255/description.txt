  Album Info..: 
  
 While the Deftones still rely more on form than content, they have noticeably 
 improved on their second album, Around the Fur. Their sound has hardened into a 
 blunt, aggressive slab of metallic guitars and hammering drums, giving the album a  visceral force. The Deftones tap into the same alternative-metal vibe as Korn and L7, and while they don't have catchy riffs or a fully developed sound, Around the Fur suggests they're about to come into their own.
