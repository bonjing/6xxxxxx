,Luckmann,2011-08-23T05:37Z,Comments shitting up again? Test.
,diawkdfi,2011-08-23T09:22Z,I always assumed that it had something to do with making the files more difficult for anti-P2P engines to find.  I have no idea if this is true or not.
,Luckmann,2011-08-23T13:05Z,"Except that this isn't P2P.

Anyway, checked TvTorrents, 904.72MB size; still not nuked. So I guess it's right. Still, I wonder why or how.

Have scene standard changed? A few MB here and there is understandable, but when a whole 100MB just isn't there like it used to, I find it a bit alarming. :P"
,xpgrl_uk,2011-08-23T19:30Z,There was a 800MB file around for this show a while back. I guess it depends on who encodes it and how.
