It is a streamlined version of his bestselling OCEANOGRAPHY text, but was created specifically to meet the needs of the shorter course. This text provides a basic understanding of the scientific questions, complexities, and uncertainties involved in ocean use, and the role and importance of oceans in nurturing and sustaining life on the planet.
