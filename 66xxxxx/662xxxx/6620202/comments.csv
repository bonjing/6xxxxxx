IF YOU HAVE INSTALLED THE ""MORE realistic DEMO's OF 47 Soundpack"", FROM THE ""...ADD-ON\VISUAL AND AUDIO ADD-ONS\"" (FROM WITHIN THE GIVEN IMAGE FILE), AFTER INSTALLING THE REALISM PATCH, THEN YOU HAVE TO INSTALL THE REALISM PATCH AGAIN, OR IN OTHER WORDS, ALWAYS INSTALL THE REALISM PATCH AFTER INSTALLING EVERYTHING ELSE..., OTHERWISE IT MIGHT NOT APPLY CORRECTLY!***

With that in mind, you might always want to look for the best!


Long live the Fighting Falcon..., and Open Falcon FTW!
