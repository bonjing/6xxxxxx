                        |Realism Patch V2.15 for any OF version|
                         --------------------------------------


THIS PATCH CAN BE APPLIED TO ANY OPEN FALCON VERSION, REGARDLESS OF ANY PREVIOUS REALISM PATCHES...!
THE "REALISM PATCH V2.0/2.1x OF" IS ALREADY INCLUDED INTO THIS PATCH, SO YOU ONLY NEED TO APPLY THIS ONE OVER "Falcon4" FOLDER



     This patch has major changes in the aircrafts data..., once again bringing them one step closer to the real thing!

***********************************************************************************
     All the modifications within the tables have been meticulously reworked in concordance with real diagrams and polars,in an effort of bringing the
aircraft's flight models as closer to their real behavior as possible, in terms of roll rates, pitch rates, accelerations on X and Z axis
(that means coeficients of lift, drag coefs and propulsion tables modified) as well as angle of attack limiters for given G values!


I wish that the real F-16 pilots have finally found the simulator which makes them feel just like in the real F-16 with it's performances!

"F-16 and other fighter pilots..., welcome to a new world!"
***********************************************************************************


Other modifications are as follows:


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The F-16 Block 52+CFT has unknown data issues which makes Falcon4 crash when attempting to fly it, therefore it has been taken out from DGFT menu!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following aircrafts, now have their specific top speeds achievable, just like the real ones: 

- The F-16's now can reach 2.05M or M2.10+ depending on variant/block/engine manufacturer

- The F-14A top speed = 2.38M (40000ft)

- The F-14B/D top speed = 2.35M (40000ft)

- The F-15C = M2.5+ (50000ft)

- Other F-15 variants now reach their real top speeds aswell

- The F/A-18A/C = 1.8M (@36000-38000ft)

- The F-18E/F Super Hornet = M1.8+ (40000ft)

- The F-22 Raptor = M1.82+ for supercruise and M2.4+ with afterburner (real top speed is higher, but classified...) (40000ft)

- The MIG-23ML armed with two R-23 Apex, now reaches from 600km/h to 900km/h in 12.2 seconds at 3000ft, same as the real ML, and from 1.00M to 2.00M
in about 160 seconds (2 minutes and 40 seconds) at an altitude of 36000ft

- The MIG-29's = 2.35M

- The MIG-31 = 2.8M (above 70000ft)

- The Su-27/30/37 = 2.35M

- The Su-32 = 1.8M (36000ft)

- The Su-33 = 2.17M (33000ft)

- The Su-35 = 2.25M

- The SR-71 = M3.2+ at around 80000ft
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following aircrafts now have a better Cobra and Kulbit/Powerloop behaviour:

- MIG-29 all variants

- Su-27/30's/32/33/35/37

- The F-22 Raptor

***Although the Cobra ability for MIG-29 and Su-27/30 is now closer to real, there is a small issue with the rudders going in opposite direction when
applied somewhere between 200-300kts, because of the limitations within the .dat files..., but this shouldn't affect the landing speed or cause any
difficulties in any way!***
