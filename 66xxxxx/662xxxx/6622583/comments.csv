,PorlyHung,2011-09-04T20:19Z,"Yep, the keygen has a trojan in it.  Works otherwise, thank you for sharing. :)

I see no dramatic improvement over pervious version, they just added some eye candy, and repackaged it as 2012.  Once installed, there are at least 5 different tasks running, eating up memory. "

,micoyol,2011-10-21T16:44Z,"Thank you scene4all.

When I install Roxio I follow the instrutions , but Roxio start to install and suddenly stops and say Roxio found a problem a can not install , contac Roxio technical support ,I tried many times to install Roxio 2012 but allways I recived thesame warning from Roxio. 

The way that I finally could install Roxio was by accident, 
1-I have a other CP with Roxio  2011.
2- When Roxio warning me that there was other Roxio application installed and it must be uninstalled first, and ask me if I want uninstall it first or install Roxio 2012 anyway, my answer install Roxio 2012 anyway.

Roxio 2012 start to install and later it uninstall Roxio 2011 automaticly.
Its working fine.

I let you know this because some people probbably have the same probem that I have.

Cheers"

,uniden365,2011-11-02T05:06Z,"This torrent is getting mixed reviews, is there a virus in there or not?"
,simplepinoi177,2011-11-02T18:25Z,"I'm pretty sure that this is either a ""lite"" version of roxio 2012 or a previous version bundled in with computer (my laptop came with a sort of roxio lite as well), the thumbnail for this torrent is 2011 pro.
There are no sections for this program for Photos (but in help, the tutorial shows section) and other staples/programs that Roxio has come out with in the past (Creator Classic, the audio editor). Although everything says 2012 pro, programs/crackers could simply re-edit the code to display roxio 2012, but not actually be."

,Arachne,2011-11-08T19:59Z,Works great!  
,simplepinoi177,2011-11-11T01:37Z,"I was mistaken...
apparently, make sure you uninstall Roxio 2011 Content CD before installing this 2012 Pro!
Apparently, my 2011 content cd went hinky and only allowed Roxio 2012 Pro to install a fraction of the programs that didnt interfere with the 2011 content cd...
Sorry, my mistake. After figuring it out, all is well and complete! Thank you Magnitude n piratebay!"
,asdf672001,2011-11-22T22:32Z,Thanks for this - everything installed smoothly.

,Cracker_Jak,2012-06-04T20:59Z,"Thanks for the up/down. Yes the keygen gets flagged, Just do what squashme10 says. Easy install. 1, Burn iso file to disk. I used Gizmo but you can use whatever. 2, Run your disk, You will be prompted for a serial. Use the one provided by following the link by Squshme10. 
  And that's it.restart and wham-bham-thank-you-mam. Just for people who are not sure. "
,armchair.53,2012-06-08T08:04Z,"With VISTA 32 bit, it will not install along the lines of other comments.  It gets about 95% through and then encounters a problem and rolls-back.  It explains the problem in the log file but I did not understand it.

As far as the keygen goes, yes my AVIRA finds a Trojan but I am certain it is not.  Good keygens are often flagged as infected when they are not.  A good way to tell is (1) rely of the reputation of the pirate... he does have a skull, and (2) notice the size of the keygen, it is small; keygens with viruses are larger.

Anyone else having problems installing on VISTA or 7 32 bit systems?"
