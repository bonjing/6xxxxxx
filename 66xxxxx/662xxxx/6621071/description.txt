Permanent Waves is the seventh studio album by the Canadian rock 

band Rush, released January 1, 1980. The album was recorded at Le 

Studio, Morin Heights, Quebec, and was mixed at Trident Studios 

in London, UK. Permanent Waves became Rush\\\\\\\'s first US Top 5 album 

hitting #4 and was the band\\\\\\\'s fifth Gold (eventually Platinum) 

selling album. The album also marks a distinct transition from 

hard rock and progressive rock into a more accessible, radio-

friendly style and consequently, a significant expansion in the 

band\\\\\\\'s sales with hits such as \\\\\\\"The Spirit of Radio\\\\\\\" and 

\\\\\\\"Freewill\\\\\\\" seeing considerable radio airplay.

Music

\\\\\\\"The Spirit of Radio\\\\\\\" featured the band\\\\\\\'s early experiments with 

a reggae style, which was explored further on Moving Pictures and 

Signals.

A notable track on Permanent Waves is \\\\\\\"Jacob\\\\\\\'s Ladder\\\\\\\", a song 

style reminiscent of their earlier heavy progressive rock period. 

Exploring odd time signatures, the song possesses a dark, ominous 

feel. The song\\\\\\\'s lyrics are based on a simple concept; a vision 

of sunlight breaking through storm clouds. The title is a 

reference to the natural phenomenon of the sun breaking through 

the clouds in visible rays, which in turn is named after the 

Biblical ladder to heaven on which Jacob saw angels ascending and 

descending in a vision.

\\\\\\\"Entre Nous\\\\\\\" (\\\\\\\"Between Us\\\\\\\") is similar in style to \\\\\\\"Freewill,\\\\\\\" 

yet it did not receive heavy radio airplay, and was not featured 

in concerts until the Snakes & Arrows Tour.[3] While the band 

began stepping back from the epic song format on this album, 

\\\\\\\"Natural Science\\\\\\\" does clock in at over nine minutes and is 

composed of three distinct movements. The lyrics are driven by 

concepts of natural science. It was featured, with a different 

arrangement, on every tour from 1996 to 2002, and was also 

featured on their 2007-2008 Snakes And Arrows tour.

Cover art

The cover art sparked some controversy because of the appearance 

of the \\\\\\\"Dewey Defeats Truman\\\\\\\" headline on the newspaper. Because 

of pressure from the Chicago Tribune, Hugh Syme changed the text 

to \\\\\\\"Dewei Defeats Truman\\\\\\\". The billboards in the distance were 

changed from Coca-Cola (who objected to the use of their logo) to 

include each band member\\\\\\\'s name in similar typestyle.

The background scene comes from a photo, taken by Flip Schulke, 

of the Galveston Seawall in Texas during Hurricane Carla on 

September 11, 1961. The woman pictured in the foreground is model 

Paula Turnbull.[4] The waving man in the background is Hugh 

Syme.[5]

Background

The writing of the album began in July 1979, at a farmhouse at 

Lakewoods Farm in Ontario on Georgian Bay, Lake Huron while Peart 

started his lyrics in a cottage near there. They began with an 

instrumental jam, which they nicknamed \\\\\\\"Uncle Tounouse\\\\\\\". Parts of 

this were used in the songs on the album. While Peart worked on 

lyrics, Lifeson and Lee would work on musical ideas in the 

basement. Within a few days they had put together \\\\\\\"The Spirit of 

Radio\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"Freewill\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\"Jacob\\\\\\\'s Ladder\\\\\\\", which came very 

naturally to them, and it was recorded on a Slider JVC mobile 

unit. \\\\\\\"Entre Nous\\\\\\\" was the only lyric completed ahead of time.

Neil was working on making a song out of Sir Gawain and the Green 

Knight, the medieval epic from King Arthur\\\\\\\'s time. Based on the 

story written in the 14th century, he was trying to keep its 

original style. It was deemed too out of place with the other 

material and was discarded. They moved into Sound Kitchen studio 

in Toronto to record demos, joined by producer Terry Brown. \\\\\\\"The 

Spirit of Radio\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"Freewill\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\"Jacob\\\\\\\'s Ladder\\\\\\\" were further 

polished on the warm-up tour during soundchecks.

In 1982, Lee told Rolling Stone Magazine that the album\\\\\\\'s title 

referred to \\\\\\\"a theory that was going [within the band] about, 

like, culture waves; and there was a night when Neil said that a 

big album was like a permanent wave and I told him, \\\\\\\'that\\\\\\\'s our 

title.\\\\\\\'\\\\\\\"[6]

Rush headed to Le Studio in Morin Heights, Quebec and began 

tweaking the settings of instruments and positioning of 

microphones. They recorded basic tracks with multiple takes until 

they captured the best performance. While Lee, Lifeson, and Terry 

Brown began overdubs, Peart began attempting to write another 

epic song to replace the discarded \\\\\\\"Green Knight\\\\\\\", and after 

enduring three days of writer\\\\\\\'s block, \\\\\\\"Natural Science\\\\\\\" was 

born. Fin Costello was then brought in to photograph the band in 

the studio. Cover art director Hugh Syme was also brought in and 

added a piano solo to \\\\\\\"Different Strings\\\\\\\". Music was composed for 

\\\\\\\"Natural Science\\\\\\\", with some leftover parts from \\\\\\\"Green Knight\\\\\\\". 

The tide pool effects for the song were created by splashing oars 

in the private lake, performed by producer Terry Brown and studio 

assistant Kim Bickerdike, and the natural echo outside was used 

to record various instruments. The rough mixes on the album were 

complete, and the final mix was completed in a week at Trident 

studios, London.[7][8]
