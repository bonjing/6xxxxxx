50 YEARS FOUR CORNERS: YOUR STORIES, OUR HISTORY

To mark the occasion, 50 YEARS FOUR CORNERS: YOUR
STORIES, OUR HISTORY will air on ABC1 on Monday 22
August at 8.30pm. In tracing the history of Four Corners,
producer Deborah Masters and editor Alec Cullen found broad
themes that framed the life of the program: crime and
corruption, social change, Indigenous affairs, war and
conflict, immigration and politics. As this program
demonstrates, a walk through Four Corners' history is a walk
through Australian history.
