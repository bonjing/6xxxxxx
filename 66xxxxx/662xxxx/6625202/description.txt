Director:  Carl Foreman

Anti-war and anti-epic film that has long been missing from circulation, although people have long been wondering  whyâ€¦  This is a 4:3 letterboxed TV version, keeping the original aspect ratio but not the original running time of 175 min. It is the shortened version of 153 min that showed up a little after the first week of the filmâ€™s original screening back in 1963 (according to IMDB user reviews)

With an international cast:  George Hamilton, George Peppard, Eli Wallach, Peter Fonda, Vince Edwards, Albert Finney, Maurice Ronet, Jeanne Moreau, Melina Mercouri, Romy Schneider, Elke Sommer, Rosanna Schiaffino, Senta Berger
