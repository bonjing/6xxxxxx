One rainy night, a stranger arrives in a nondescript seaside town and checks into a cheap hotel.  All that is known about him is his name â€“ Pierre â€“ and everyone he meets is suspicious of him.  He appears to know the area well; he looks to be in good health.  But why is he here?  Why is he so sad?  The answers emerge when another man appears on the scene, an acquaintance of Pierre who knows the crime that he has committed and who intends to use the information to his own advantageâ€¦
