SEASICK STEVE (AND DRUMMER) DAN MAGNUSSON LIVE AT LOWLANDS 2011 (20-8-2011)
(Downloaded and converted .swf stream to .mp4 file.)
quality is no dvdrip, certainly no dvd for that matter but with video in H.264 (480x270/25 frames per second) and audio MPEG-4 AAC (Stereo/48000 Hz), at the same time not at all bad and really enjoyable! Too bad the concert is only 1 hour 3 minutes and 49 seconds long....
