,Lowlskichi,2011-08-22T08:25Z,Why is the file so friggen' massive? I'm just wondering. Thanks btw for uploading the episode :D
,MoviesR101,2011-08-22T13:43Z,"Thanks EZTZ!

This file is so big because it is 720p HDTV! EZTV usually uploads a 720p and one that is just HDTV! The HDTV should be around 500MB! I will wait for the 500MB!"
,MoviesR101,2011-08-22T13:48Z,"This is the 500MB one!

,gabriel.angelfire,2011-08-22T19:02Z,"eztv actually always comes with the HDTV-only firsts, it actually takes awhile to come out with the 720. I was trying to download another 720-Dimension but it was taking forever, think it'll be better to start with this from the start."
,hmathews,2011-08-22T19:59Z,"Guys..it's ""massive"" 1.74gb's size is because the title says 720p HDTV. EZTV always releases a SD file around 549mb's, then an HD file (this one) "
,LanMax,2011-08-23T00:50Z,Thanks. This size is no problem nowadays. C'mon guys. What are you on dial up? :) More seeders = 10min DL =)

,ariiraariira,2011-09-04T15:33Z,"If you have the choice, only download from eztv! 100% legit. always."
,TheSageM,2011-09-25T17:03Z,Thanks EZTV :-)
