1.) Put the disc in. 
2.) Wait for the error message. 
3.) Go into the diagnostic menu by pressing and holding Menu, Map and Back simultaneously. 
4.) Select Version and press OK (push the big joystick in). 
5.) Select Download and press OK. 
6.) Then wait for the download (couple of minutes), the satnav will reboot and you are done.

Hope this helps!! Enjoy.... and most importantly, Seed!!!"

No... follow the above procedure and this will ensure that the disc starts perfectly everytime the engine is started."

Cheap brand DVD... Use VERBATIM DISCS ONLY for perfect results everytime!!"

,xolog,2011-11-06T16:15Z,"Hi,

Just want to leave a comment to state that this worked perfectly for me.

@jrafty and @tamgunner,
I was getting the same message as you guys, but i realised i was copying the ISO image onto the DVD not burning the actual image. Make sure you are burning the image on the DVD by selecting burn image in PowerISO.

Oh and I have a 2006 Model 2.2 iCTDI EX with Voice Recognition, Manufactured in 2008.

Worked without having to manually update the software.

Cheers again to the OP for taking time to upload this.
A."

hi thanks for the reply. i downloaded the iso file and opened it and extracted its contents into a folder and then burnt it on to DVD+R Dual layer. 

im going to buy them verbatim DVD's everyone recommends them and try that.. but it works some time and other times it doesnt..really confused..tempted to just buy them off www.satnavi.com he sells copies and back ups etc

great seed and big shout out to the man uploading it but just cant get mine to work!!"
,sholock,2011-11-07T18:47Z,What is the md5 hash of the ISO image ?
,jrafty,2011-11-07T19:23Z,"sholock

what you mean MD5 hash?"
,stoxradar,2011-11-15T19:26Z,"Hello! Thanks for this Gizmo, I have yet to test it on mine. 

1. Do you know how to make the DVD player play movie DVD's? (Are there any special programs/warez for this?) 

2. So far every movie DVD for the UK region gives a Disc Error - Am i correct in understanding that the Accord DVD only plays Sat Nav discs issued by Honda? 

Thanks!"
,GizmoK,2011-11-17T12:25Z,"@stoxradar

Yes... all models with sat nav only accept sat nav discs. Connecting a video source can be quite complex... In simple terms you must create a lead for your media device which can be plugged into the OEM reverse parking camera socket on the back of the DVD drive. For the sound you will need an AUX in device such as ""Connects2"" or ""Denison"".
I have achieved this modification along with many others such as making the power mirrors fold with the central locking and creating a replica Honda Ambient Footwell lighting kit!"
,capmar55,2011-12-28T18:14Z,"For updating the Certification Code is required (CR-V 2007 Honda SSD Navigation System). It could be gotten from https://ec.clarion.com/certificationcode_en/hinput.php. But Disk Code + Access code (20 digits - is printed on the inside of Update package) are required. Gizmok, if you have all these details please share it."
,gingergod5,2012-02-02T20:26Z,"Worked Perfectly on a 2008 Honda CRV EX
burned using Poweriso and had no issues at all
installed straight from the cd without having to do any menu's

Thanks Gizmok :)"
,kituh,2012-03-29T15:25Z,"Working ok on my 2009 Honda Accord Tourer NAVI!
Only made it with VERBATIM DVD's - tried with other brands and didn't worked.
I also got a problem after updating the SW - car battery was completely down after the update - got some battery cables, recharched and it's now fully ok working with updated maps! :-)"
