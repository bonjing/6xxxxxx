About the Game
The BDnzrf control cars were designed to enable electric train services to be driven from the rear on return journeys, without the need to uncouple the locomotive and run around the train. As such, the DDnzrf has normal passenger accommodation together with a drivers cab but no pantograph or motors. In this add-on the control cars are coupled with a Class 143 pusher locomotive. The Silberlinge coaches were initially restricted to 120 km/h but were upgraded after 1970 to 140 km/h, and have been re-liveried and reconfigured inside over the years since their introduction.
