,ghandi253,2011-09-11T09:34Z,This is probably fake. The files are video_ts and audio_ts files. How could someone get the DVD format when it hasnt even been manufactured on DVD yet?
,carlozone,2011-09-15T05:43Z,@ghandi253 what does it say in the title doughnut? TS 2 DVD. read it next time before you give a negative comment. These guys don't get skulls easily and it's people like you who jeopardise this. @BlackSam keep up the good work ;)
,Wezzy101,2011-09-18T16:01Z,@ ghandi253 dude you can mad video and audio_ts files with any video format in any video conversion software
