Audio is muffled (Obviously since it's only 128kbps.

Video looks good, dark but thats what makes it look so good...  Fuzzy on my 50"" 3D plasma but thats problebly because its stretched so far. 

Overall score:

V-10 (It is a R5.  Not a true DVD rip.)
A-7 (Because it sounds so muffled)
M-? Havn't watched it yet. About to do so in a min.

Thanks man!!!
