,hoppy54,2011-09-18T19:31Z,"@KC, Hello mate, if you unzip the programs rar there is a folder marked ""windows loader"".
double click the exe and it will make your copy genuine.."
,KCPeas,2011-09-22T17:02Z,Thanks Hoppy. I couldn't seem to find the windows loader in the .rars I downloaded. But I did find a Remove WAT app that worked.

,hankin2011,2011-09-26T19:23Z,i need the key to activate this
,kernow73,2011-10-09T15:52Z,what happens when it wants to upgrade its self. will it tell me its not a proper version. thanks in advance
,hoppy54,2011-10-11T11:51Z,"Hello Kernow
If you run the activator included in the rar files then you can go ahead and update mate with no problem."
,KengurBGD,2011-10-13T08:32Z,Microsoft Windows 7 USB Download Tool doesn't work with this ISO? This is suspicious for untouched version of Windows.
,KC-Peas,2011-12-22T16:04Z,"Hoppy, I ran Windows Update and now it's saying

""Windows 7
Build 7601
This copy of Windows is not genuine""

It also started the activation clock again. I ran the RemoveWAT.exe but it says it's already removed and the only option is to Restore WAT.

Any ideas?"
,KC-Peas,2011-12-24T21:51Z,"Hey Hoppy, thanks for the reply.

It turns out I had used Hazar's Remove WAT tool when I did the original install of this for some reason. I probably couldn't find the tools that shipped with it =p

Anyway I simply restored the WAT and then removed it again and everything is fine. It takes a couple reboots but I don't mind.

I will check out digitalrejects.co.uk as I have some other issues not related to W7 I'd like to clear up.

Thanks again!"
