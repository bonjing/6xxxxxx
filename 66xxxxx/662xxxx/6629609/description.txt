While there is a growing number of books on specific forensic tests and cases that have been solved with blood-spatter evidence or ballistics, this book takes a more unusual approach to the basic CSI concept of crime solving. Yount introduces the men and women who pioneered ideas that led to many of our modern-day crime-fighting tools and explains how these tools have made an impact on law-enforcement techniques. Readers see how fingerprints came to be the identification of choice, beating out anthropometry or studying arm length and head circumference to identify criminals. A chronology and list of sources for further information are included for each of the individuals highlighted, and easy-to-read diagrams and drawings of key concepts appear throughout. This book will be a valuable addition to the study of various sciences not only for its technical information but also for the profiles.â€”Lynn Evarts, Sauk Prairie High School, Prairie du Sac, WI
