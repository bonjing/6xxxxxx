The survival of the Angry Birds is at stake. Dish out revenge on the green pigs who stole the Birdsâ€™ eggs. Use the unique powers of the Angry Birds to lay waste to the pigsâ€™ confounding constructions. Angry Birds features challenging, physics-based demolition gameplay with hours and hours of replay value. Each of the 240+ levels requires logic, skill, and brute force to crush the enemy.

The Angry Birds have been captured, caged, and taken to Rio! There they meet new friends, and work together to make their escape from a desolate grey warehouse to the lush green jungle. Help the Angry Birds escape and beat their captors by bombarding the evil marmosets and smashing all obstacles in the way!
