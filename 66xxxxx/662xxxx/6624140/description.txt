ABOUT \"STAR TREK: DEFIANT\":

\"Star Trek: Defiant\" is a full-cast, ongoing sci-fi serial adventure based upon the Star Trek television series.

Defiant started off as a text-based story list in early October of 1995. Believe it or not, that list is still around. I actually met my wife there. :)

But back then, Defiant was really something new and different on the newborn, barren wasteland of the internet. A bunch of fans with a similar passion for Star Trek came together and formed close friendships while telling stories about our fictional crew set upon my favorite of all the Star Trek ships, the USS Defiant (of Deep Space Nine fame).
