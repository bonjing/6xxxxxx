This Top 10 Travel Guide to San Francisco divides this waterfront city into five easily managed central areas, and one area exploring the towns and cities around San Francisco Bay. This map shows the location and extent of these areas. Each San Francisco area in the guide is color coded; color bands on the pages covering each area correspond to the colors shown on this map. Almost every place mentioned in the book has a map reference, which takes you to the large maps on the front and back flaps.
