This is World of Warcraft - Cataclysm, fully patched to version 4.2.0.14333.

This is the version that all private servers running Cataclysm support. All you have to do is download, edit the realmlist.wtf file according to your server and run the game!

This took quite a long time, and lots of people want it. Please help me seed it. If I see people downloading and not seeding, I will take it down.
