,icnk,2011-08-23T22:27Z,User/786sami786 on YouTube has started to put the videos up. Don't know if NBC will remove them quickly.
,meekus,2011-08-23T22:42Z,ahhhh! Stuck at %99.9
,meekus,2011-08-23T22:44Z,ack! %99.9 i'm stuck!
,meekus,2011-08-23T22:45Z,sorry bout the double post
,PeridotButterfly,2011-08-23T23:06Z,Seed please! I've been stuck at 99.9% for hours. :/
,icnk,2011-08-23T23:13Z,That .01% is only the .torrent file. You shouldn't need it to be able to play the rest of the files.
,saphio,2011-08-23T23:21Z,"OMG
THanks alot for the upload!"
,wonderwatcher,2011-08-23T23:22Z,I'm also stuck at 99% and it's the Part 9 video file that isn't available for download. The Part 9 file itself is at 99.6%. 
,kokobombon,2011-08-23T23:25Z,"Thanks so much!!
it plays nice on VLC :)"
,hazydazy,2011-08-23T23:52Z,it will not finish downloading. what parts are 100% will not play. for some reason WMP 12 won't recognize the .flv format. and it's up to date. :'-(
,zahur,2011-08-23T23:55Z,"Will wait for a well-seeded one, but many thanks! Your efforts are much appreciated by lots of people here, including myself..."
,zahur,2011-08-23T23:57Z,"Get VLC people, it'll do the trick!"
,wormyrug,2011-08-23T23:57Z,"I've downloaded the other two as well, you just missed the bit where they shoot the music video. apart from that, great quality."
,hazydazy,2011-08-24T00:08Z,YAY!!!! it does work in VLC. thanks kokobombon :-). here's hoping part 9 works too
,icnk,2011-08-24T00:18Z,"I've just noticed - sorry! I've just uploaded a corrected torrent, which should be 100%. Or I've merged them into an avi, which is smaller, but I don't think the quality is as good. "
