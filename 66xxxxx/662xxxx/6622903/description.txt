(A scathing rebuke of classic Indian culture by an movie Indian producer)

Salaam Bombay (1988) is a wake-up call to the harsh realities on the ground 
in respect of cultural make-up of life in India at the present time.

It would be insane to consider integrating what is shown in this movie with any 
respect of European civilization as a compatible or remotely possibly 
co-existent model in any regard whatsoever.

To each his own as they say, and that is most certainly the case here.

We cannot allow ourselves the possibility that any in our midst envision
what is shown in this movie as something we want to become equal to in any
notions of propriety whatsoever. The "monkey dance" done by Steve Ballmer at Microsoft on one occasion is shown equally by a neanderthal genius in this
movie who takes it upon himself to swing a belt buckle at at boy carrying some
tea to see if this would entertain the visiting gal (from Australia?) no thanks!
(to this brand of entertainment genius and social modelling insanity!) Amen
