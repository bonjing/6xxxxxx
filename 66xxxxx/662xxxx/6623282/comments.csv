,bboywhat,2011-08-23T09:44Z,"thanx BOZX, you get your torrents from DH?

anyway, the original NFO says, ""NOTES....: left border varies so we crop to the widest possible frame.""

Does that mean some of the content is cut off, or there's a black bar on the left at times? :S"

,dfxsilva,2011-08-23T15:56Z,is this really 720P ?????
,dfxsilva,2011-08-23T16:03Z,sample? is this realy 720 dude? rsvp
,EvilCorporateWhore,2011-08-23T16:09Z,"Damn, wish i would have waited for this release. I was impatient and got a much smaller resolution last week. This one looks great.

And for those saying this movie sucked, i personally thought it was pretty good. For anyone that liked/loved the previous Pirates movies, you'll like/love this one just as much.

My only problem is that it seems Depp is just doing a parody of the Sparrow character now, which sorta bothered me especially at the beginning, but i guess i got used to him. IT just felt that Depp was doing an impersonation of Sparrow for most of the movie and it sorta ruined it for me. BUT, there's lots in this movie to redeem itself from Johnny's performance, especially in Barbosa, who, once again was my favourite character in the film, he really carries the movie and is captivating to watch every minute he's on screen.

Don't listen to the whiners, if you like the series, you will like this one. Thanks BOZX."
,Leonidas123,2011-08-23T16:22Z,Why 6.56 GB ?

,aruntv2010,2011-08-23T19:34Z,"Those who dont like please dont come here to post negative comments.These people were there were when the movie was released and kept on posting negative comments in IMDB and rotten tomatoes. Still it went on to make 1 Billion plus.(that much  is the fan base for this series, no critics could stop that from happening).  Now they have come here too to post idiotic comments.This is for fans and lovers of the series. 11000 PLUS LEECHERS as i write this comment. Just enjoy the ride in Blu-Ray for free. Still there are people to post idiotic comments/self boasting comments.This is not a place for such people.Just respect the uploader and seeders. BOZX is doing a great job 60MB/s speed is simply awesome.

Ofc u can use vlc for hd movies:P i have played avatar 1080p dull bluray (45 gig)
in vlc without any problems:P

I recommend to buy a cpu capable for hd movies.

Or if u dont want to buy a new cpu, and have an nvidia gpu, i recommend media player classic home cinema.
It uses the cuda engine aka vpu (video processing unit) to play off hd movies.

My gpu only uses 10% vpu when playing an 1080p 10 gb movie."

Install K-lite codec pack, enable gpu acceleration in codec settings. play in WMP

Any other operating system(not recommended)

Install VLC, enable GPU acceleration in settings.

If that does not work for you then you must stick to DVD rips."

I also think, they should make a pre-pirates movie, like telling the story of Jack Sparrow. Showing where he came from and how it got all the things he had, other than giving hints through the first two movies."
