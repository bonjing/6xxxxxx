,damnken,2011-08-24T15:25Z,"extremezone, you've probs heard this a million times. But again and again thank you for your continuous hard work and perfect torrents. You Are The Uploader! Best of the Best...
Quick question: Why do you strive to make the best torrents? pure competition (you're winning btw) or you enjoy it, or some moral code (although it is pirating, haha)... Or all 3.

Anyways Cheers.
Platinum skull for you sir.
Btw pretty funny movie, JT can kinda, sorta actually act..."

@nDALLAS I saw it at the cinema, knowing they used a body double for that one scene before I even watched it (did some reading), but trust me when I tell you that there are still some pretty damn hot scenes of Mila, to say the least. You won't be dissapointed. Also, it is in fact a good movie. If you just want the Mila scenes there's no point in watching the movie and you can just search 'em on YouTube/Metacafe etc."

but the movie sucked .....JT just doesn't cut it 4 me in movies "
,beeftv,2011-11-15T13:18Z,"Shut the fuck up about how fast the download was for you. 

It has nothing to do with anything that is relevant to anyone but yourself.

Also nobody gives a shit what you think about the movie. Go to IMDB to give your opinion about the movie.

Here you should just rate the audio and video quality."
,Rages,2011-11-16T15:38Z,Thank you beef tv I get so tired of looking for quality ratings and get siskel and ebert type crap keep the drama in ur pocket ppl!!

,toxitrix,2011-11-24T04:22Z,"Awesome download !
a big thanks

The quality of this one is very nice for a R5-line"
,The_Probe,2011-11-27T08:26Z,Just a warning that this will not play on any PS3 with firmware above 3.XX as it is Cinavia protected.
,beeftv,2011-11-30T20:37Z,Audio is out of sync!
,beeftv,2011-11-30T20:38Z,"And people, shut the fuck up about what you think about the movie.

This is not imdb. Nobody here gives a shit if you like the movie or not, and what you want to rate it.

Just rate the video and audio quality, and then shut the fuck up."

Thanks!"
,XXD1XX,2011-12-17T05:39Z,"@beeftv : Seriously dude... clean the sand out of your vagina... Just like you say ""comments about the film aren't needed"" (I cleaned up your filthy language a bit), your comments are equally, if not more so, uncalled for in the thread. All their doing is reinforcing everyone's first opinion of you... (Which is ""Douche bag"")"
,Samus50,2011-12-23T03:35Z,@XXD1XX i agree with your statement 100%.... just feeding the fire!!!

I tried playing this on my PS3 last nite tho, and a message popped up about 5 mins into the film saying it was copyrighted and that it wasn't authorized playback on this device, and wouldn't let me continue watching (sobb) (damn you Sony, Lol)....I should be able to watch this on my Laptop through VLC tho right? x"

,pirah,2012-04-30T20:18Z,"@mikefinley

You fucking prick. I made an account just to say that for spoiling the fucking movie. Why would you do that? Just to be a dick? Well nice one because you are."

,hkdaddyo,2012-06-08T18:53Z,"@Pirah: You couldn't tell that, as MikeFinley said, ""they fall in love at the end"" from looking at the goddamn cover of the movie? Did you think one of them dies of cancer? Or perhaps they realize that they're not meant for each other and go their separate ways?!?!? HAHAHAHA! Tool."
