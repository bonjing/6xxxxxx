i put the crack in the program directory folder
and it still don't work, this is no good"
,AndyFtw17,2011-08-30T17:03Z,"Guys, here's the instructions

1) Install TouchCopy as normal
2) Go to C:/Program Files (x86)/Wide Angle Software/TouchCopy 11 and replace the TouchCopy.exe using the one from the crack directory
3) Load up TouchCopy and choose ""activate offline"" and browse to myass.lic which is also in the crack folder.

Done! :)"

,trent86,2011-09-28T16:48Z,First class and what a differance it made to backing up my ipod bits thank you so much. Will confess I was a chicken and not wanting to mess up my new laptop (hence the need for the backup) I asked my son to d/l and install but it worked at once no probs.
,trent86,2011-09-28T20:20Z,Help this all installed properly copied everything on my ipod but when i went into the folder there was nothing there. What did I miss?
,Wiznaz,2011-10-14T05:32Z,I'm unable to get this program to recognize my iPhone. It just keeps searching for the phone. I followed the directions correctly. Tried on both Win7 64bit and XP. Using an iPhone 4 w/ firmware 4.3.3 and now on iOS 5. Any ideas?
,Wiznaz,2011-10-14T20:37Z,Update on my previous comment: The program was working correctly the whole time. It took over 10 minutes for it to complete the connection to my phone. 
,TorrentGuy96,2011-10-18T12:48Z,"Finally, went through 4 different applications, all of them couldnt find my iPod Touch, this one is working flawlessly :D

Just got this iPod Touch off of ebay and it has so much music on it, would have lost it all if it wasnt for you so thanks :)"
,fitlighter,2011-10-20T17:04Z,"FYI you must have iTunes and Quicktime installed for this app to work, they do not need to be running, just installed. this is what i had to do and im running Windows 7.  

works great! thank you, thank you!"
,asixex,2011-11-28T12:13Z,"TouchCopy will find my iPod but when it does, it crashes. I've tried this for over an hour and it still just won't work."
,M_J_Luff,2011-12-06T09:35Z,"It does work, just read the other comments to get work out how to install it.  Also remember that you need itunes and quickplayer.  Without quickplayer it opens but doesnt connect to your iphone and crashes.
Thanks for the upload."
,blezegun,2011-12-14T19:15Z,"i can't find the 'myass.lic' with browse, what do i wrong?"
,clamsquadron,2011-12-20T07:16Z,@blezegun It's looking for a specific type of file. Look at the bottom right of the browse window and change that to All files. Then you'll see the .lic format
