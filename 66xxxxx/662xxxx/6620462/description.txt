The U*X*L Encyclopedia of Diseases and Disorders is devoted to helping younger students and general readers understand the nature of diseases and disorders of every type, including communicable diseases, genetic disorders, common conditions, and injuries.

This book is a collection of more than 200 entries on diseases, from avian flu, to cystic fibrosis, to warts. The entries start with a definition
section and highlight the basic facts of the disease to explain the causes, symptoms, and treatments. Other sections give a more detailed description, talk about demographics, and discuss the future of the disease, for example, if any new treatments are under development or if the disease is becoming more or less prevalent.

The U*X*L Encyclopedia of Diseases and Disorders uses everyday language when possible, and explains medical terms as they arise. Terms are
also defined in Words to Know sidebars within entries, and a collected Words to Know section is included in the beginning of each book. Entries are designed to instruct, challenge, and excite less-experienced students, while providing a solid foundation and reference for students already captivated by medicine.
