,dadotkd,2011-08-22T08:02Z,I tried it on two trial programs and it DID NOT work for me and also I can't uninstall it. I'm not sure why but be careful.  
,ptv83,2011-08-24T17:12Z,"am interested by the concept, am wondering dadotkd what programs you found it to NOT work with, 

would be a good/helpful idea for thse who download to post what trial programs it worked/didn't work with...

I think of this with sorrow when I look around Pirate bay, or roaming is the right word here.

Sometime there is some who seeds. But itÂ´s not enought.

maybe people are afraid to do so because they think they cant get caught..?

Show that youre not scared and seed!"
