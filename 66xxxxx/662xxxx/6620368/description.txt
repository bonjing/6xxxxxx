
Using Time stopper you can use trial version software without expiring. If you don't have enough trial period of any trial version software you can extend the trial period using Time Stopper.  However,We recommend to buy trial version software which you really want.



Time Stopper is a tiny utility which eliminate the time limit existing into trial software usage period.

Time Stopper works with any software executable file and practically will extend the trial period of the program for an unlimited amount of time.

Time Stopper is very easy to install and use: you just have to browse for the executable file of trial program (generally located in C:Program Files) and select the new installation date. Now, your program trial period will be automatically extended to another 30 / 90 days, depending on the software.

TimeStopper will not modify the time and date of the operating system, therefore is safe to use.
