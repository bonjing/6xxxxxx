With his international solo debut on Ruf Records, Big Daddy Wilson is going to take one step further in his late career as a musician.For â€œLove Is The Key" he recorded his own songs exclusively with a small band; taking it back to the roots, often reduced to acoustic instruments, but always full of soul. His good friend Eric Bibb is guest on two songs about Wilsonâ€™s roots â€œCountry Boyâ€ and â€œWalk A Mile In My Shoesâ€.
