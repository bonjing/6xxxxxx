Listening to OMNIA: "Crone of War" for the first time is like the first time you had sex: you're not sure what exactly is happening, you don't know what to think about it, but it sure is great! And you know you'll want more ...

Although "Crone of War" is OMNIA's 4th CD to date, it is the first real PaganFolk album to cover the full range of their evergrowing spectrum of musical styles.

Because OMNIA is really into this "misty-swirly" "heyaheya" "tree huggie" kind of stuff they only play on authentic (acoustic) instruments on Crone of War and none of the recordings have been compressed, so as to keep the natural dynamics and emotion intact.
