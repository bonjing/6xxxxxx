,bryentheartist,2011-08-23T15:44Z,can you upoad this in reg xvid? it takes forever to  download when file is mkv. thanx
,mantikor777,2011-08-24T11:47Z,All of the Hi-Res .mkv files I download from these guys will not play in the Divx player - if I were just watching on my computer or tablet this would not be a problem but I like to play them on my Blueray machines in the living room and can't them to run while all other .mkv files from other uploaders work just fine.  Something is whack about these uploaders - just FYI
