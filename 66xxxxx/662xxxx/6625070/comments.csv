,Torpor,2011-08-24T00:05Z,"Kinda' obvious that the show is not about breaking into assholes! Thnx for the up, docus about physics and time are always appreciated!"
,joshcran,2011-08-24T00:40Z,"I had respect for ya guys, 'tvteam', but that pic up there is a little weird!"
[V],catflap,2011-08-24T04:43Z,"you people who think tvteam creates
the files they post don't understand where
the shows and films come from.

they mostly come from scene groups.
tvteam (and others) grabs those files
from the groups and creates a torrent file
and posts it here.

tvteam doesn't create the content or the
nfo. the nfo you see here was created by
analtv.

complain to them (if you can find them)."

Don't add to the crap that's posted every day. Make sure it's accurate and searchable! People searching for Sci Channel material probably won't find this."
