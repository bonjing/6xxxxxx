,WvBrsci,2011-09-08T17:12Z,"Spollero: Scenebalance uses split rar, as a rule. They're traditionalists. High quality and quick release usually makes up for it.

For those short on tech history, split archive is a relic  from way back, when the DL of 15 MB could take an hour or more, and any interruption would require starting from scratch. A file size of 350 MB would make the DL impossible. The Scene is old (ancient, in Web terms, as it predates the Web), and elements of it find it very hard to let go of even the oldest standards, as a lot of prestige is tied to meeting Scene standards.

Anyway, it's not like it's a major problem. If you're on Windows, just use WinRAR."
