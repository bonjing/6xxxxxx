"Robert Lorayn is an artist cohabitating between two deserts; the Internet 
and Phoenix, Arizona. RobertÃ­s work includes essays, computer drawings, flash 
animations and a series of videos which, in particular, have really piqued 
my interest.  I came across RobertÃ­s site last fall when he made an epic post 
on COMPUTERS CLUB with a collection of black & white drawings [DRIFTS, 2010]. 
Since then, IÃ­ve been paying attention to the hands/signs in his drawings and 
in videos heÃ­s posted of himself on Facebook. The videos are incredible; they 
depict Robert rhythmically throwing rapid-fire signs; the most articulate 
hand motions IÃ­ve ever seen."

-Taken from Look I'm Lucid interview with Robert Lorayn, May 2011

Here's a collection of Robert's stacking vids. As far as I know these don't 
exist anywhere else, since he removes them from his facebook after being online
for a few days. I started downloading them after noticing the trend this year. 
I asked him about it a while back, he said "Hi, ya i [deleted them on purpose]. 
I like playing with the expectation that data will always be there. Or 
somewhere...I think that's especially potent on social sites where one expects 
a profile to essentially be a record of that person in the real world."
