,tahl112,2011-08-24T06:10Z,Will this work on Lion?
,maczoli,2011-08-24T12:27Z,"If something goes wrong please let me know in the comments section down below, I'm new at this but I want to be good at it. 
To answer your question - Yes, it runs on Lion 10.7.1"
,FourTwenty83,2011-08-24T13:21Z,"Does not work for me on 10.7.1 Lion, when i try to start the game it just bounces on the dock and then closes down :(

Anyone else got it working?"
,blumpkin123,2011-08-24T13:31Z,"same problem, just bounces about and closes"
,arovsNL,2011-08-24T14:18Z,"yup, same proplem too, not using lion though..."
,lennysglue,2011-08-24T14:55Z,"Ah, same problem too. Not working on 10.7.1."
,maczoli,2011-08-24T17:33Z,"I think you should paste your own _MASreceipt file in to the contents folder of the game.
Just download a free app, right click, show package contents, contents folder and there you'll find your own receipt file. Copy that to the same hidden folder of Jedi Outcast. 

Check the system requirements of the game! It may not work on some video cards."
,arovsNL,2011-08-24T17:59Z,"well, i got the system requirements, and my mac passed the test, but i can't seem to find this _MASreceipt file you're talking about?"
,arovsNL,2011-08-24T18:01Z,"nvm, i found it, and copied it, but it doesn't work. It even stopped bouncing, so i guess it got worse :P"
,arovsNL,2011-08-24T18:06Z,"It, uhm, doesn't seem to work. It stopped bouncing, so i guess it got worse..."
,maczoli,2011-08-24T21:06Z,"I've found another source. It works! It's on fileserve. Just put this at the end of the link -»

,blumpkin123,2011-08-25T00:24Z,"yeh, downloaded the one from that link, it works but is very buggy. every time you press escape it crashes to desktop and the fella looks like the human centipede, multiplayer didn't seem to work either"

,arovsNL,2011-08-25T08:34Z,"thx man, this one works :P and srry for the triple post..."
,therealduckie,2011-08-25T09:27Z,"To fix this:  

1. Open terminal
2. change to /Jedi Knight II.app/Contents/MacOS/  directory
3. type (or paste) this into terminal:

sudo chmod u+x Jedi\ Knight\ II

It will make it a unix executable

Somehow the formatting broke because it was torrented as an app instead of compressed."

chmod: Jedi Knight II: No such file or directory

,dogflesh,2011-09-23T06:59Z,You think it would fuck up if run it on a 2.3 GHz CPU?
,awwgoddammit,2011-10-02T01:20Z,can you ul a fixed version? your terminal solution didn't work for me. :(
,pn247,2011-11-02T10:11Z,This was a waste of my fucking time. NOTHING works. AT ALL. fuck you and have a horrible day.
,tonyt387,2011-11-11T04:38Z,the terminal thing isnt working it keeps saying directory not found
,JOLG,2011-11-16T11:14Z,"For the terminal command you need to write this in the terminal. And yes, it works after this!

cd ""/Applications//Jedi Knight II.app/Contents/MacOS/""
Then
sudo chmod u+x Jedi\ Knight\ II"
,jjsydroo,2012-01-27T15:33Z,"Thanks, a lot JOGL! Your solution works perfectly. For all those people who can't type:
1)Open Terminal
2)Type cd and drag MacOS folder to Terminal's windows
3)copy-paste sudo chmod u+x Jedi\ Knight\ II
4)TURN OFF ""F.LUX"" OR ""SHADES""!!!!!!!! After that, my brightness issue disappeared. 

Thank you, maczoli for the upload!"
,pogesichris,2012-02-05T06:58Z,"Uhm whenever I do this:

,Dj-TweeX,2012-05-17T22:21Z,"@pogesichris
when you type your password in terminal, it will seem like nothings typing but its just not displaying what you are typing. just type your password and hit enter. it works."
,Jcc477,2012-05-19T01:19Z,"Hi guys! I just followed all steps posted by JOGL but it keeps telling me « No suck file or directory »
