Emma Becker (Alexandra Chando) is in foster care. When Emma is framed by her foster brother for stealing she decides to run away from home. Emma doesnâ€™t have many options as to where to run but she knows she has a twin sister, Sutton (Alexandra Chando). Although they have never met in person they have talked on the computer a few times. However, Sutton has other plans. Sutton wants to go to LA and try and find their birth parents. Sutton canâ€™t just pick up and leave like Emma because she was adopted by an affluent couple and sheâ€™s supposed to be at school and she would get into trouble. Sutton comes up with the evil scheme that Emma will pretend to be her, while sheâ€™s away in LA doing some digging.

Emma goes along with the plan. What other options does she really have? Emma soon finds out itâ€™s not as easy as she might have thought. Sutton has many people in her life such as her parents Ted (Andy Buckley) and Kristin (Helen Slater). She also has her best friends Madeline (Alice Greczyn) and Charlotte (Kirsten Prout) to fool. Not to mention Suttonâ€™s sister Laurel (Allie Gonino) and Luke, Suttonâ€™s boyfriend whoâ€™s acting strange. Thereâ€™s also a mysterious bad boy called Ethan (Blair Redford).
