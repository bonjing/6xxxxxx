Information
------------------------------

It's perhaps not the most comforting of thoughts, but flying isn't always the safest way to travel. Aircraft tumble from the skies for many reasons: extreme weather conditions, engine failure, lack of fuel, terrorist attack... And that's before we even get to structural failures, fire or human error. This series uses first-hand pilot testimony and computer-generated animations in order to examine some of the world's more dramatic aeroplane incidents, reliving the crucial moments when pilots lost control. Passengers recall life-or-death situations, while the animation aims to recreate an accurate picture of stricken planes' final moments before crashing or destruction. 
 ------------------------------ Why Planes Crash: Breaking Point -----------------------
Nine passengers are sucked out of a 747 flying over the Pacific when a cargo door explodes. This is just one of the sudden structural failures in this episode, which also sees a DC-10 lose an engine on take-off!
