,hahalolfailmupp,2011-08-24T10:17Z,"So there was the 1st release, which worked for me all the way to the end no issues, decided to try the Skidrow crack, to give it a chance, first, the crack tries to connect to the internet, 2nd it removes any previous save files, the ""offline fix"" still connects to the internet, doubt I'll try this one."
