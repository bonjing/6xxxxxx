Forest. Safe haven for some and an ideal hunting ground for others. In the world's forests are hiding unique and dangerous creatures. The leaves are poisonous predator camouflage, large animals dominate due to its lethal force, and small animals armed with such weapons, which we do not normally see until the feel. Discover exotic predators such as ants - Bulldogs, tarantulas, goliath (the world's largest spider), a giant skolopendra and Foss (predator, the king of forests of Madagascar, is found in nature only there). Welcome to the scary world's most deadly animals of the forest.
