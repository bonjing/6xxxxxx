,maczoli,2011-08-27T18:31Z,"You have to use chmod to make it a unix executable. I've read this on my other torrent Jedi Outcast, the user ""therealduckie"" pointed this out. I don't know how to do this, I upload the stuff that worked for me. I can't edit or reupload them because the system won't let me."
,8letters,2011-08-29T14:54Z,"I couldn't figure out how to start it from the finder but if you cd into the Braid.app/Contents/MacOS and then ""chmod +x Braid"", you can start it from there using ""./Braid"""
,christiantheatheist,2011-11-14T23:11Z,"I did as 8letters said and it worked for a few hours and then it stopped working, when I tried to relaunch the terminal returned error 10. I eventually found a better fix which doesn't require to use the terminal: I changed permissions with an old app called iRepair which is free, after that I can launch it directly from the finder and I can configure video and gamepad options. So that's what I recommend doing, good luck with that."
,KingLobos,2012-05-19T14:17Z,This app is tainted. It has a bug that makes your mac app store show an update for Angry Birds whether you have it or not. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Unless you want an update notification on your mac forever.
