,Jierdan_Firkraag,2011-08-25T06:30Z,"In this torrent is not so much ""wallpapers"" because they were not my goal.

Sorry for the russian some filenames. Rename them if they disturbing.

I put torrent in haste at the request of roleplayers. So, corrections and additions will follow later."
,Jierdan_Firkraag,2011-08-25T06:36Z,"BTW, in ""Cities, Landscapes & Worlds"" is cityscape, futuristic and estraterrestial environment. 

How to add ""Description"" to this page?"
,bookworm1960,2011-08-26T19:59Z,"""Wallpapers"" may not have been your goal, but using ACDSee Pro, I can use any image as ""desktop wallpaper"", it scales an image up, or down, as needed, to fit the screen, while keeping the original aspect ratio.

And there are a lot of images here that are new to me, so thanks again for this great collection!"
,Jierdan_Firkraag,2011-08-26T20:18Z,For the Greater Good!
,bonzodog1,2011-08-28T18:54Z,Thank-you!
