Since you try to fill requests, I have one as well. Being a Bernard Cornwell fan, I'd love to get any or all of the following :
.... the ones I've yet to read :
Stonehenge, Wildtrack, Sea Lord, Crackdown, Scoundrel, or The Starbuck Chronicles (Rebel, Copperhead, Battle Flag, The Bloody Ground).

Even if you can't, on behalf of all Cornwell fans, thanks."
