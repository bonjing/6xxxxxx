SYNOPSIS: 



Tux Paint is a free image editor aimed at young children. The project was initiated in 2002 by Bill Kendrick, who continues to maintain and improve the program, along with the help of several volunteers. 



Is licensed under the GNU General Public License and seen by many as a free alterative to proprietary software Kid Pix. 

History 



Tux Paint was initially created for the Linux operating system, because there was no similar drawing application for children at this time. 



It is written in C programming language and uses several helper libraries free. 



Tux Paint is a drawing program designed for children, specifically for children between 3 and 12 who can make their first steps into the world of computer design. 

Tux Paint includes a mascot named Tux, a penguin who will give advice and encouragement when children are half their creations. 

The program includes an interface designed so that no child has problems when drawing whatever. 

On one side we have the tools that allow us to create lines, paint, print drawings created, write text and much more. On the other hand we have the options of each of the tools.
