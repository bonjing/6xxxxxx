T-Bone Walker invented the guitar solo as we know it ? he was the guy who figured out how to make an electric guitar cry and moan. Born in Texas in 1910, he was a bluesman touring the South by the age of fifteen. As early as 1935, he was playing primitive electric-guitar models. But he shocked everyone with his 1942 debut single, â€œMean Old World,â€ playing bent notes, vibrato sobs and more wild new electric sounds that other guitarists hadnâ€™t even dreamed of. Walker invented a new musical language, from the urban flash of â€œThe Hustle Is Onâ€ to the dread of â€œStormy Monday.â€ Through the Forties and Fifties, he led his suave L.A. jump-blues combo on classics such as â€œYouâ€™re My Best Poker Hand,â€ â€œI Know Your Wig Is Goneâ€ and â€œLong Skirt Baby Blues.â€
