An essential piece to any Bob Dylan collection, the first version of Corrina Corrina on this album just shivers my spine, though I am partially biased towards this album as I consider Freewheelin' to be my favorite studio album of his.

Quality is of studio quality for a majority of them, although few do appear to be amateur recordings.

You can change the .nfo file into a .txt file (same for the .log file) if you are unsure on how to open a .nfo file (though you can always download "DAMN nfo" for free online).

Will be seeding this forever, though my PC will not always be on so if the seeds die, just wait until a point in the day that I am actually online, it's not dead (though, I should count on you folks to seed, too)!

A great package. The cover is an alternate photo from the Don Hunstien West 4th street photo shoot that produced the official LP cover. Inside is Dylan at CBS studio NY with famed producer John Hammond. The recordings are clear, crisp, and right off of the mix down board. This CD belongs in every  collection. It was re-released in 1999 by an unknown Label, and again in 2001 by OMR.
