,Vader--,2011-08-22T17:14Z,"This is the same as the rest, God Awfull and unwatchable.

Anyone else want to re up the same shitty torent like miguel1983 or froggie100 or sceneline or  scenebalance or TvTeam or UltraTorrents or  Test_Verify.

In case you bunch of repeaters don't know   TorrentXXLS had the torrent up 6 hrs before the next one and 24+ hrs before the rest of you.

Just saying as a long time user smarten the fuck up, We too can read and see  TorrentXXLS's torrent and unless you can improve on it , the general body of users here see you as wanna bees and Paretts.  That's Paretts...not Pirate's!"
,LEERV,2011-08-23T02:21Z,"Hey vader stop dissing the uploaders you prick, if it wasn't for them you'd have fuck all. YOU MUPPET. By the way what's a parett??? The word doesn't exist in the English dictionary. Where do you come from Twat City???"
,tsubodai,2011-08-23T02:39Z,"@vader
those guys you ar dissing spend hours looking for torrents for our benefit they cant watch them all.
I am just glad they love doing this so much.
and to all uploaders great job and pay no attention to idiots like vader"
,Chazk,2011-08-23T04:46Z,"I'd love to live in Twat City! Although, it'd probably smell kinda fishy..."
,LukeScooto,2011-08-23T05:57Z,"You can dis vader all you want, what he speaks is the truth, thats the bottom line. All everyone is doing is re-upping the exact same cam copy. They only change the name to get their own credit for uping it, and they didnt do that good a job of it either cause we can all still see its XXL's.
And how do i find Twat City? Is that on my TomTom GPS?"
,Vader--,2011-08-23T06:35Z,"LEERV and tsubodai you are NEWBIES to torrenting and have little to no understanding of what these parrots (is that better) are actually doing. If you start multiplying these re- ups times the number of movies it is ridiculous.

Also you only find this kind of behaviour on public sites because that's the only place they get away with boosting their (parroted) rep.

LEERV I may have made a sp error, but you need a new English Dictionary. It's not only the name of a river but it's also a Family name as well as a business name, a village, name of a BAY in ST.Johns. It's also a type of Claim an injured worker can use against an employer.

If that's not in your dictionary TFB 4u, buy a new one."
,LEERV,2011-08-23T22:08Z,"vader - parett isn't in the ENGLISH Dictionary.
Names don't appear in the ENGLISH dictionary either. I don't know, maybe you're not familiar with ENGLISH.
As far as a worker saying ""Hey boss, I've hurt myself I think I'll put in a parrot."" Come on your having a laugh, you'd get beaten up.
As far as TWAT city's concerned, I've been there lots of times usually when drunk. You tend to meet piss flaps like vader there."
,mubeen37,2011-08-23T22:49Z,downloading....
,Ezkriel,2011-08-23T22:50Z,"ok i just want to know if this copy is watchable but first i want to thank the uploader for there time and effort on sharing this torrent, however before i commit to downloading i wanted to know if it was worthwhile as the comments so far have been more arguements"
,LEERV,2011-08-24T02:33Z,"Ezkriel - Firstly we're not arguing, we're taking the piss (well I am anyway). Learn the difference.
Secondly, no it's not very good. I'd hang about a bit. The uploaders do rule though.
 LONG LIVE 'THE PIRATE BAY'."
,neomagician,2011-08-24T07:20Z,Just got a email from ISP COX. Torrent is tracked by BayTSP 
,Vader--,2011-08-24T17:54Z,"It's a parret claim and not parrot claim.

That is a word and it's my last to you .

Take your foot out of your ass and take your ass out of your mouth, and take the time to look it up before you fit both feet where the sun don't shine."
,LEERV,2011-08-24T21:26Z,"Sorry vader but the word 'parret' DOES NOT EXIST in the ENGLISH Dictionary. 
There is a river PARRETT that flows through Dorset and Somerset in south west England.
I'd also like to point out that I don't own a Donkey and I wouldn't put my foot (or my mouth) anywhere near it even if I did.
P.S. You're still a prick."
