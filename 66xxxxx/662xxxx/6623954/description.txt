GOTSent 0.24 Beta 8

Great for those MKV's that you want to make MP4 so it can play on you XBOX 360 or PS3. :p 


Easy and Fast h264 .MKV to PS3 , XBOX 360 and iPad compatible MP4 and PS3 compatible M2TS/AC3 conversion. 

recoding to Xvid, mpeg2 and compatible h264 (with hardcoded subtitles or to AVCHD with softsubs) is also supported. A newer feature includes folder batch conversion of AVI files to PS3 compatible format. (scan and only convert incompatible AVI files) 

0.24 Beta 8 is released.

Many fixes in MKV parsing: Compressed header fix for many new releases. (this caused many conversions to fail from the start). Fixes in AVI creation and MPEG creation. Audio sync updates. Better file splitting and updated tools.
Too much to name, although much too late :)

For iPad newbies: just select the Xbox 360 profile, select the MKV and hit convert. The resulting MP4 should play fine

(Or just drag the MKV files over the GOTSent program).
