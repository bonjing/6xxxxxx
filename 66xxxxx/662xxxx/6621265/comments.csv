Audiochecker should reflect a 99% to 100% odds that this recording was ripped from CDDA.

Some fans prefer this version over the 2008 Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (M.F.S.L.) remix on Gold plated CD. Personally I believe the two remixes are both a tie and they both are an improvement over the 1980 mix, which was already not too bad."
