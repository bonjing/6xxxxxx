[Notes]

Merge Records presents Obscurities by Stephin Merritt, a collection of
Merritt's hard-to-find recordings dating back to his time on Merge (1994
1999) and prior, as well as five previously unreleased tracks.

In 1999, The Magnetic Fields' three-CD collection 69 Love Songs established
Stephin Merritt as one of this generation's most talented songwriters. The
Los Angeles Times hails Merritt as "one of indie-rock's most acclaimed
figures" while Pitchfork calls him "smart, thorough, and unerringly
precise."
