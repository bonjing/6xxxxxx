,venom925,2011-08-25T17:54Z,"Thanks for the up forland91. just a heads up for anybody downloading this, it DOES break the waypoint if you have it set to use the carbonite waypoint in place of the builtin. so you will either have to use the built in waypoint or replace the waypoint.lua with the one for one version back or use the builtin one"
