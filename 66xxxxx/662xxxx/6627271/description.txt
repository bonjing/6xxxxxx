August 22nd, 2011

Alliance Guides Change Log:
* Rewrote Eastern Kingdoms Leveling guide levels 34-60. The Hinterlands and The Cape of Stranglethorn now both merge into Western Plaguelands at level 34. From then on, the leveling path is the same.

* Fixed minor typos in Northrend and Cataclysm.
* Took out quests in Nagrand that had reputation problems with Kurenai.
* Fixed the end of guide that was giving error for Western Plaguelands.
* Dwarf starting zone - added in a quest goal to a later step to allow the player to see it completed (Rhapsody Malt).
* Changed &gt;= Neutral Tags for Scryer and Aldor to show &gt;= Friendly
* Shadowmoon Valley - Added in \"only scyer reputation\" for a hearth step.
* Changed some other typos found in the Shadowmoon Valley Loremaster guide.

Guides Viewer Change Log:
