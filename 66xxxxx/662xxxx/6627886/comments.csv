Tarsem Singh has really unique way to make movies. If movie ""The Cell"" rings any bells, you know how beautiful and unique his movies are. This movie is fortunately made without Jennifer Lopez (she starred ""The Cell""). :D"

I'll agree with you on that particular film. It's splendid; full of insight and creativity, with a touching introspection into human weakness and strength."

""presented"" by David Fincher & Spike Jonze, which really kind of says it all -- nice up, and highly recommended!"
,nilvolentibusarduum,2011-10-21T19:30Z,"Insinuendo, but DO you mind if I say you're incredible? Because I love your uploads (the movies and the quality). It's not often that I compliment someone over the internet, but you sir are doing a tremendous job - Thanks a lot! "
