2Cellos are Luka Sulic and Stjepan Hauser, virtuoso musicians and long-time friends from Croatia who have both played the cello since childhood.

Their debut self-titled album is a collection of chart-topping rock and pop songs from Guns N' Roses, Kings Of Leon, Coldplay, U2 and features Michael Jackson's "Smooth Criminal".

2Cellos were catapulted into a worldwide YouTube sensation when they posted their duelling cellos interpretation of Michael Jackson's "Smooth Criminal" online -- and received more than 5.6 million views. Unfortunately, due to certain issues regarding copyright the video has been removed from YouTube. However (at time of album release), their live performance on 'Ellen' is still available to watch.
