,UncleO,2011-08-25T02:40Z,I'm not sure I get it.  This 2nd UL is for the pics?
,musicfromrizzo,2011-08-25T02:51Z,No its not at tpb and the old hash couldnt be posted here - I tried that first . So I just prettied this up with a nice image attached to each and removed the demonoid notation from the torrent file. Our 4CD collection is a nice line up too - at 192k from discs we bought ourselves to post
,UncleO,2011-08-25T08:38Z,"Hmmm.  when doing new torrents I found two versions of your UL.  Two sizes, one with no seeders or leeches."
,musicfromrizzo,2011-08-25T11:28Z,when a torrent gets posted it sometimes doesn't show the seed for the first moments. They are two separate torrents at different bitrates nd refer to different packages of this collection - the 4CDs come as a set as do the ten - they are therefore on separate torrents for different appeal - although you may happily wish to seed both - thanks
