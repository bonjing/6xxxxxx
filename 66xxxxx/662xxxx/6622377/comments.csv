,LiOnBliTz,2011-08-22T19:57Z,Please comment on the quality and seed as much as you can as you are only helping fellow formula1 fans like yourself! :-) 
,kaiser818,2011-08-23T07:46Z,Thankx for the quick response and the fast up for my request. Your a life saver !! Time to download and help seed for others. Cheers
,kaiser818,2011-08-23T07:52Z,I had already downloaded your single race up hungry 2006. So that should atleast help with initial seeding.
,oOo0HellKnight0oOo,2011-08-28T08:10Z,"it would be nice to have seasons 1998-2004 if you can, and thanks for this, downloading"
,LiOnBliTz,2011-08-28T09:26Z,"will try to upload season one by one, but first of all will seed this one till it is uploaded completely and then will upload other seasons. :)
"
,f1cabezon,2011-08-28T17:18Z,"thank Lionblitz

do you have the complete 1998 & 1999 F1 seasons? "
,f1cabezon,2011-08-28T17:24Z,"thank lionblitz

do you have the complete 1998 & 1999 F1 seasons? "
,Administrator999,2011-08-29T14:21Z,"Thank you very much! What speed do you seed with? 1mbit/s? This will take some time, but F1 is worth wating for. Thanks again!"
,LiOnBliTz,2011-08-29T21:40Z,"@f1cabezon

I can upload them too but i am already uploading the 2006 one and a bunch of other races, i guess i'll upload the seasons one by one and that way it can be seeded in the order otherwise if i seed all of them then it will take a lot of time for anyone to download them.

will seed the 2006 season first and then will do other ones. :)"
,LiOnBliTz,2011-08-29T21:40Z,"@Administrator999

yep! :)"
,LiOnBliTz,2011-08-29T21:51Z,"i have 98 and 99 seasons as well but i guess i will upload and seed the 06 season first as the torrents will get too slow if i upload them all. just wait for some time, will upload seasons one by one, thts the best way i think. :)

@Administrator999

yep! :)"
,Administrator999,2011-09-01T09:50Z,"Please seed Lionblitz. Nothing happens now. I am stuck at 35,7%. Have been that for the last couple of days. Why are you not seeding?"
,f1cabezon,2011-09-02T03:25Z,"Thank Lionblitz

Please upload 98-99-2003 and 2004 seasons


"
,LiOnBliTz,2011-09-02T12:34Z,seeding now!
,Tmade,2011-09-08T08:06Z,"PLZZZZZ SEED LiOnBliTz , so a few of us can finish & seed too ,  half of us stuck at 84.7 % ;)"
,LiOnBliTz,2011-09-08T16:22Z,"Have uploaded more then 45 gb for past 3-4 days, dont know anyone has got all 100% yet?  too many leechers, i guess it will be 100% for majority of leechers in a day most probably. "
,raymond_u,2011-09-08T20:48Z,"Lionblitz; the majority of peers I'm getting are at 88%, but none at 100%"
,LiOnBliTz,2011-09-10T03:16Z,majority of them now r at around 98% so i guess the whole torrent will get around 20-30 seeds in around couple of hours from now.
,kaiser818,2011-09-10T07:02Z,Hey Blitz !! Glad to see not too long now before this season is complete. once this is complete I will have complete seasons from 1978-2010. Obviously 2011 still ongoing. So if you decide to up any more seasons let me know and if I have the same stuff I can help seed for the rest of the guyz too !
,LiOnBliTz,2011-09-10T14:01Z,"@kaiser818

,sonny786,2011-09-26T06:18Z,"Thanks for this, do these files include race build up? Also do you have the qualifying sessions for '06 season? "
,Tmade,2011-09-28T04:45Z,"Thanks Blitz , A10  V10 !! Don`t forget to share people :)  Any word on who can seed the F1 98 & 99 seasons for fellow F1 fans ??"
,Administrator999,2011-11-28T22:03Z,"He does not want to upload anymore, and who can blame him? Uploading here is useless. Noone is seeding. Just retarded morons everywhere. I hate those parasites. They should not download when they dont want to seed. It is very sad. Morons that kill all the sharing. Fuck the morons!"
,Administrator999,2011-12-09T03:25Z,"I am at 4,3% now. This will take some time. 7kB/s. =) Why is it so slow? Is it because some morons are limiting the uploadspeed? I HATE those fucking morons!!! They are useless. They kill all sharing for everyone, including them self. Why are morons without a brain!!! =)"
,matej007,2011-12-29T11:09Z,please seed...please please
