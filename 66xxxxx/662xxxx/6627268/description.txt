John Dies At The End is a comedic horror story by David Wong published online between 2001 and  2004. After being released as a paperback in edited form, the story was taken off the web in 2008. The edited story is still available for sale (paperback and ebook) and as a torrent.

This is the unedited web version, also called the "badgerconda" version after a monster that was retconned out of existence in the book.

The format is in website archive form, with the original folder structure preserved.
