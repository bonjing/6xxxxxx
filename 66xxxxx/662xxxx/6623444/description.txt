Notes   Just taken from a CD-R floating around in collectors circles for years now. No efforts were made to improve the sound. Cheap cover art.
  
  Concert:   One of the best shows of this tour. Our man is in high spirits and he enjoys his time on the stage. Pitty that he wasn`t as good as here more often these days. We have a very good and interesting setlist with highlights like America The Beautiful, Hurt, Help Me, How Great Thou Art or You Gave Me A Mountain. Well done, Elvis ! 

With covers. Enjoy!
