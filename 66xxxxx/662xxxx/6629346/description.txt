Komodo - Secrets of the Dragon
It's fair to say the Komodo dragon isn't nature's prettiest design, but this enormous lizard is fascinating to watch. The Komodo dragon was discovered one hundred years ago, yet the true nature of the biggest lizard in the world is only just being uncovered.
Australian biologist Dr Bryan Fry has become infatuated with the Indonesian inhabitants and travels to Komodo to understand more about the predators. He doesn't get too close - the apparently sleepy dragons can turn at a moment's notice, as a water buffalo discovers to its eternal cost. But Dr Fry's affection for these unique creatures is certainly infectious - especially with a TV screen between them and us.
