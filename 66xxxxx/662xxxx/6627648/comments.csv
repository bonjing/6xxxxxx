""Bears added to list of hazards for bike race"".

Then ..... ""Colorado parks officials are adding a new hazard for the upcoming Pro Challenge bike race.

Parks officials are worried after a bear entered and damaged two tents in Difficult Campground near Aspen and they've restricted camping to campers with hard sides.

According to the Difficult Campground host, the site is fully booked next Monday and Tuesday night as cycling fans gather to watch the race as it passes over Cottonwood Pass and Independence Pass into Aspen on Wednesday.

Race officials are estimating the race may draw more than one million spectators over the course of seven days beginning Aug. 22 and transportation officials are allowing roadside camping.

The race will cover more than 500 miles of Colorado terrain, including Aspen, Avon, Breckenridge, Colorado Springs, Denver, Gunnison, Salida and Steamboat Springs.

Not your average road hazard!

Just like the Tour de France, I'm looking forward to seeing what should be wonderful country views?"
