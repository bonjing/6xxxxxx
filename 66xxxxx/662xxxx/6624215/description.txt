Personnel:
Elizabeth (Libba) Cotten - Guitar, Vocal

Elizabeth Cotten was among the most influential guitarists to surface during the roots music revival era, her wonderfully expressive and dexterous finger-picking style a major inspiration to the generations of players who followed in her wake. Cotten performed with love and pride songs and tunes which reflect her traditions, her independence, and her inspirations. 
This album was recorded 'live' for an appreciative audience during her ninth decade. 
The original LP release won a Grammy in 1984.
She does some of the most popular items from her repertoire over the course of this 50-minute recording, including 'Freight Train,' 'Shake Sugaree,' and 'Oh Babe, It Ain't No Lie' (which was covered by the Grateful Dead). The guitar playing is good, the vocals are less impressive; there's plenty of storytelling between the numbers, and audience participation on some of the choruses during the songs.
