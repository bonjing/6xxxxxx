,toxia,2011-08-25T04:31Z,Nope.
,Otaku073,2011-08-25T04:32Z,Yep tested and patched it myself :D
,gansch,2011-08-25T04:32Z,probably but its 360
,Otaku073,2011-08-25T04:33Z,"@toxia
-.- i just added this torrent so theres no way you could have downloaded it and tried it already so dont BS people. This game works"
,Valmont1982,2011-08-25T04:35Z,"Don't be a pussy. That Otaku guys seems legit... 

:p 

Honestly, I have no idea."

,Valmont1982,2011-08-25T04:35Z,"Gah, 360. I'm such a blind dofus. "
,Zantumall,2011-08-25T04:35Z,"The uploader's other 2 torrents appear legit, but I was under the impression that the real game was about 8 gigs."
,Zantumall,2011-08-25T04:36Z,"Oh, it's 360.  Seems legit in that case."
,Scottbot,2011-08-25T04:45Z, 
,Sickatriz,2011-08-25T04:47Z,so i guess the crackers grew a conscience? delaying PC crack isn't goin to help the PC community.. consoles are leaked a month in advance and they still far outsell PC sales so if this is all just stupid
,clawixp3,2011-08-25T04:53Z,The hell?
,kalamari13,2011-08-25T04:53Z,"@Unknown_prodigy

I doubt it, these idiot shitheels have been uploading these fakes for more than a day now."

,Erstok,2011-08-25T04:58Z,God looking at the nfo makes me feel like I'm reading dos or linux console.
,Otaku073,2011-08-25T05:04Z,Gah sorry guys i didnt know the text from ABGX360 would turn out like that and now it wont let me edit it for some reason. The reason its so small is because i compressed the game into rar files. Why are you guys so skeptical of me?
,Otaku073,2011-08-25T05:09Z,"Alright guys listen
1) I copied the text from ABGX360 and when i uploaded the torrent the text turned out like that i have no idea why
2) Pirate bay wont let me edit it now, probably cause I just uploaded it
3) The file is smaller because i compressed it all into rar files

any other questions??"
,sync380,2011-08-25T05:14Z,Is skidrow the only group that makes cracks?  I know there's are always legit but are we waiting solely for them or can someone else release something sooner?
,tsakali77,2011-08-25T05:33Z,"@Otaku073

what's the point f uploading something that has been uploaded and successfully working by someone else for over a week now?

Honestly, I'm not trolling, I'd like to hear the reason."
,toxia,2011-08-25T05:35Z,"leÂ·git-Adjective 
 Legitimate; legal; conforming to the rules.



he asked if it was legit. no, it isnt. No, its not for PC. Will it work on Xbox, dunno. size diference seems to be because the iso is broken down and compressed. :)"
,tsakali77,2011-08-25T05:43Z,lol Otaku073 why are you deleting my very valid and relevant question i made to you?  you could have said anything and it would stil look better than just acting like a 12 year old and simply delete my post
,JarateLover06,2011-08-25T05:53Z,"ME thinks the 'Scene' is showing respect for a company that deserves it. I'll bet you'll see a scene release shortly after the game is playable everywhere.

   Or I could be wrong and Skidrow could crack it in 10 seconds from now, who knows?"
,Otaku073,2011-08-25T06:13Z,"@tsakali77
I didnt delete your post dude i dont even see an option to delete posts. Your comment probably just didnt get posted"
,Otaku073,2011-08-25T06:14Z,do you mean that post thats 2 comments above yours? its not deleted
,Otaku073,2011-08-25T06:28Z,Guys how about saving the skepticism until someone actually tests it and shows that it works too then youll see
,tyrannor,2011-08-25T07:01Z,"Ok, I have been looking for the PC version for 3 days and have given up. Can someone verify if the clone dvd version will work with any crack? My speed is very limited and I don't want to waste time downloading something for which the crack is not compatible."
,Daveboy55,2011-08-25T09:04Z,"I have enough time and idk of this is legit or fake, so i gonna download this and bring some news back when it's done"
,__arch,2011-08-25T09:41Z,"to all those crybabies regarding cracks:
how about fucking actually BUYING the game that's rated 10/10 on so many reviews instead of buying like 10 beers in an evening. And stop crying about your damn incompetence of cracking the game by yourselves. Do it yourself or shut up and wait!"
,clovely,2011-08-25T13:22Z,can someone please upload the 40 page artbook
,spawx,2011-08-25T15:35Z,arch.. dont you realise that people in EU does not even have the possiblity to buy it since it dosnt release b4 3 days afther US ?
