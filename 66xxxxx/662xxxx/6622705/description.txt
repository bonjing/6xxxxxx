We have only just compiled a most up to date listing of IP ranges by country
for an upcoming free compiled FoxPro program that will allow you to create your
own IP filter from a menu of country choices.

For now, here is a list of those countries that are most requested by Euro based
peers trying to keep their seed to more relevant areas in hopes of efficiency.

This ipfilter.dat text file can be used for utorrent and other such programs
that use the same format. Its easy to view using notepad etc and can be added to
for such problems as clients that are using defective software as often happens with 
selected qbtorrent and even (more rarely) some utorrent clients etc that show no
progress regardless of how much you seed them. The software should be smart enough
to disconnect them - but then who ever said its a genius that wrote utorrent as it
is! No logic to sharing patterns whatever! Simply insane!

Simply place this file in your utorrent applications data directory (under 
documents and settings) for the relevant user configuration for XP
(Or search for the existing file and over-write it if desired)
