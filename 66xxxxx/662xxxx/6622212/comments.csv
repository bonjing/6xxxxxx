,roarnejsk,2011-09-30T09:48Z,"this is a good torrent, and it worked on my desktop;
but when i install the trial on my laptop, i get an error saying 'this application has failed to start because the licensing configuration is incorrect. reinstalling the application may fix this problem'
but even though i reinstalled it, i still have the error. it's the same for other versions too.
any ideas how to fix it?"
,loveramore,2011-11-03T23:19Z,"Roar, did you go through the same process for each computer? You can't just the same license for all the computers and expect it to work. Find the install ID for each pc and enter it in the keygen to get a new activation. If that doesn't work... download Revo Uninstaller and delete all remnants of the program and install and start the process over. Hope this helps. "
