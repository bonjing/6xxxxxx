Story of the early life of genius and Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynman.

As a young boy, Richard was fascinated with science and objects in motion. This
wonderment was reinforced through the efforts of his father. The only thing that
mattered as much as science, and his family, was Arline, whom he met when they
were both in school.
