Thanks!"

this torrent have been tested full game on all os's......your problem has been giving me to think...try to update "
,Klipto,2011-08-28T19:04Z,"I have tried to update with both the official updater and by dragging your files into the directory, I may be doing it wrong in which case I apologise but when i put the update files into my directory the game itself doesn't actually update."
,Klipto,2011-08-30T10:56Z,"I managed to fix it by downloading the cracked update from another torrent, i get no more crashes which is brilliant but if you are reading this and are still getting crashes, lower the amount of enemy dynasty's and it will let you play for longer because the crashes are due to memory leaks in the 1.1 update.

Great torrent thanks :D"
