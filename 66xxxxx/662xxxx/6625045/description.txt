04 "Omega Red" August 19, 2011
(æ¥µèµ¤)  January 28, 2011

Logan's fight with Omega Red takes its toll on him regardless of his healing factor. 
In a flashback of one of Logan's black ops missions, he was to infiltrate and steal 
a power source for a Soviet era weapon, which drains the life force of any weapon it 
touches with its carbonadium tendrils, which are a KGB experimental counterpart to adamantium.
 As Logan steals the power source, he runs into Omega Red and leaves him to die in a cave in the snow. 
In present day, Omega Red blames Wolverine for his pain because without the synthesizer, 
his body was vulnerable to biological attack. To buy time and escape, Logan throws a flammable container 
at Omega Red which explodes and destroys the dock. While resting in a vacant apartment, 
Wolverine senses an assassin. The assassin is really a decoy for Omega Red, who reappears with a 
severely burnt face, and pins Logan to the wall and knocks Yukio back.
