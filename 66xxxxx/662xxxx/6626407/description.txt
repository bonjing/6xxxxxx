Praise be to Allah. I thank Him, seek His Help and Forgiveness. I seek refuge in Allah from the evil of my bad deeds and myself. Whomsoever Allah guides, is truly guided, and whomsoever Allah leaves to stray, none can guide him. I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Seal of His Prophets.
