Why is it.., that even before a single person has had the chance to download and watch for them self.., what ""the other side of the story"" is.., that someone else does their best to keep others from taking the time to hear for themselves.., what the ""other side"" has to say ??

It makes one wonder.., why do ""these people"" have such a hatred for allowing others to make up their own mind.  Do they just use such hateful words to hide behind.., in a way to suppress ""open debate"" and discussion on certain ""taboo"" subjects ??

Just asking...

,sarsapil,2011-08-23T05:47Z,"No, just warning people who dont know who this traitor turd was so if they are not neo-nazis dont waste their time with his lies and justifications for having joined the infamous SS of murderous reputation all through Europe. But if they are so inclined, nobody prevents those who want to splash around in this sewer to their satisfaction... The nerve of these bastards to use the word 'truth' when the nazis did all they could to suppress it..."
,slosail,2011-08-25T18:26Z,There will always be the uneducated who spew abuse at the world without having any real idea of what they are talking about. Usually for fear of having to confront reality.
,slosail,2011-08-25T18:27Z,And when they do as in this case they sound as bad or worse than the Nazis
,truelle33,2011-08-25T20:19Z,"Hi brother, is there any possibility of contact ? I am able to make your releases (always perfect) spread larger, the world."
,Warperdorker,2011-09-05T09:37Z,"Slosail, Some of us genuinly find all spects of history facinating, including the evil bits such as the SS, NKVD, Pol pot etc.........

Trouble is, if 'do gooders' ban say all references to Hitler and that part of history, or the Waffen SS, then how do younger people learn from the past mistakes?"
,HH14,2011-09-08T03:33Z,@sarsapil and @slosail. Scum like you will NEVER stop us. You fuckers have seen nothing yet. Thanks for the up. 88
,skatanafate,2011-10-08T22:09Z,"@ sarsapil - it's so easy to pass judgment when you live in an era so different from WWII. My country was occupied too, and I don't really know how I would react if I lived back then. It's interesting to see what the other side has to say, as long as we keep things in perspective."
,wallmartysec,2012-02-29T05:24Z,"I had the patience to watch this whole video and was astounded by the cheek of this traitor to this country to lie so repeatedly. So in his words Hitler gave cheap cars to the Germans, FALSE, they got the workers money but few got to even see those cars and never got their money back, the SS were in charge of concentration camps which were little less than holiday camps and the jews in the ghettos lived good lives, he lies about the hunger, murders, oppression of the jews there whose numbers dwindled drastically until they were taken to the death camps, run by the infamous SS. Its hard to believe how a human being, even such a bastard as Degrelle, can lie so blatantly. Who does he hope to fool? Some of the young nowadays? Fat chance since the truth about the murderous SS is quite available everywhere, just a pathetic loser like this traitor trying to justify himself with pathetic lies. Fodder for the neo-nazis only who lie all through their sad little lives.
