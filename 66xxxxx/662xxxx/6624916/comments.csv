[T],artpepper,2011-08-24T13:51Z,"Thanks for the upload @charlesfire22 but I found this unwatchable. 

The sound was horrific and the video was so dark and murky that I turned it off after 10 minutes. 

Not your fault, of course: 98% of TS releases (and a TS is just a CAM with synchro audio) are unwatchable.

Best to wait for a proper SCR or R5.

But thanks for the effort."
