After having spend the better part of two days to get the full version of this great mod working I could feel for lesser mortals without my extensive knowledge of modding. So I decided to make life a bit easier and created this installation package. Hopefully it will attract more people to this mod. Please note that changes to files are minimal (corrected formatting and size changes) and do not change the game play in any way at all.

The following CoW downloads have beeen included:

    Base install 1.4
    Patch 1.4.4
    Music Patch
    English Language patch

Other downloads from TWCenter:

    German Language
    French Language
    Italian Language
    Spanish Language

Work done:

    Removed all unessary files (duplicates, wrongly placed, not needed)
    Reduced texture sizes of strat models and buildings (reduces lag)
    Enlarged radar map
    Adapted checker for modelDB file and made corrections
    Added my CoW language installer pack 2.0

Comments:

    Reduction in size on disk - 3.05GB
    Reduction in installer size - 1.54GB
    The installer has to be in two parts because more then 2GB size is not supported by this program.


Installation:

    Download all parts (5*part1 and 6*part2) into one directory
    Run the EXE of part1 (DO files will be installed automatically)
    Run the EXE of part2 (DO files will be installed automatically)
    Update the language installer
    Choose your language from the shortcuts on your desktop

Important:

    Both installers will appear to be frozen at the beginning for a few minutes due to some huge files being installed (animations pack and sound pack respectively).
    DO NOT cancel the installation unless you get an error message!
