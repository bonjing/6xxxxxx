However i get crash reports once every minute. Semse like this mod dosent support Windows 7 X64 bit so well. At least that is my guess,

,hham22,2011-12-29T03:22Z,"get the following when I try to install part 2: 

""Call of Warhammer - Part 2"" has not been totally installed because of the following reason:

mods\Call_of_Warhammer\data\sounds\Music.dat: This file contains invalid data. (error 11FD)

You will have to run this utility again to completely install ""Call of Warhammer Part2""

- by the way the mods\Call-of-Warhammer... file does not exist - any ideas on what to do? Thanks
