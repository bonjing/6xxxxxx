a short film by Nina Reyes Rosenberg | 2009 | 13 mins | US
lesbian relationship blues, unsure of love style.
Organism by Nina Reyes Rosenberg

Written and directed by Nina Reyes Rosenberg, this is in essence the story of the off / on relationship of high school lovers Carmen and Jen. It is a work told out of sequence, with a seven months later heading making you question exactly what is now and what was then. Yet into a mix that is already perplexing, Rosenberg adds a dream sequence, an insert that is as surreal, as it is bloody. Thankfully Rosenberg does not mask the sexuality of her piece, proudly flying the lesbian flag from the start, even in part porno video fashion, in a short film that places the spotlight on relationship blues, of the unsure of love style. Ah, c'est la vie.

starring: Samantha Greiff as Carmen and Ji Young as Jen,
with: Leo Khuh-Chan Townsell, Joe Rocha and Neelo Norry as the Punks,
