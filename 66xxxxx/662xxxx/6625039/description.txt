On WOLF LOVE, Omnia has really surpassed themselves in musical diversity. The tracks coming by could all have originated from different albums (and even different bands) because this time OMNIA set out to prove that they can play ANY type of music on their 100% acoustic instrumentarium with the musical mood shifting dramatically between their own work and pieces from Bach and Leonard Cohen. Songs of madness, songs of love, songs of the changing world we live in... WOLF LOVE has them all.

The 16 timeless tracks on OMNIA WOLF LOVE are packaged in a beautifully Gold embossed double-Digipac and also include a Free DVD of live videos, 'behind the scenes' features and Bonus Material.
