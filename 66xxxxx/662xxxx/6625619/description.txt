The aim of the research group is to do a preliminary marketing first, to design, develop and research new Concept Houses, to build and test them as prototypes, to do a final marketing for use in the Netherlands and in Western Europe and to prepare the actual production in the form of zero-series.
The research group has been composed as a multi-disciplinary research group in which urban designers, architects, building technical designers, industrial designers, domoticadesigners, marketing people are working together with industrialists and potential clients like housing associations.
