Turner Classic Movies captures the magic of Hollywood icon Joan Crawford in the TCM Original documentary, Joan Crawford: The Ultimate Movie Star (2002). This is the first documentary ever produced on Crawford's life and career. 

The 90-minute program, narrated by Anjelica Huston, celebrates Crawford's OscarÂ®-winning career, from silent movies through '60s horror films, totaling almost 100 motion pictures. The documentary also tracks her personal life, which included numerous lovers, colorful colleagues and friends, four marriages and four adopted children. Filmmaker Peter Fitzgerald paints a vivid and frank portrait of the ultimate movie star by blending rare footage, photographs, vintage newsreels and film clips with interviews with family, co-stars, friends and lovers, including daughter Christina Crawford, entertainment reporter and Crawford biographer Bob Thomas, actors Cliff Robertson, Anita Page and Anne Blyth, director Vincent Sherman and columnist Liz Smith.

Beginning with her roots as an impoverished and abandoned child, the show carefully traces how Crawford reinvented herself time and time again, from a young dancer named Lucille LeSueur to her beginnings as an MGM contract player to her rebirth as starlet Joan Crawford - and finally to her ultimate success as an Academy AwardÂ®-winning actress.

Narrated by Angelica Huston
