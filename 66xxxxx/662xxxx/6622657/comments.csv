,DP3_001,2011-08-23T01:03Z,"About three years before, Robin did a charity benefit concert with Grammy winning artist Richard Marx in Chicago, IL (USA) for a local TV station in the area (where she used to work before joining HLN in Atlanta, GA). Naturally, she BLEW the roof off the joint! It turns out, in any case, that somebody in the crowd recorded the performance using a cell phone camera (with video capability) and put it up on YouTube, and it started receiving TONS of views. One of the people who saw it, it turns out, was none other that multi-Grammy award winning singer/songwriter/performer David Foster. And when he noticed she was in the audience of a concert he was giving in Atlanta, GA, he, reportedly, stopped what he was doing and called Robin up on stage to sing a song or two with him & his band (One of them Linda Ronstadt's ""When Will I Be Loved""). Again, she blew the house down, and also received a standing ovation from the audience. That, eventually, led to the opportunity to record her first Country album ""Brand New Day"", something that took Robin over a year (using up all her vacation time that year) to put together.

And after hearing her voice, I know you'll be amazed at how powerful her voice is. She is SO talented!

BTW: If you like this album, seed the HELL out of it! The only other way to get this album is if you live near a Target store (in the USA) or go to iTunes (again, only people in the USA can get it from there). And for people who HATE to be locked into a proprietary music format (i.e. AAC), this MP3 album is the perfect alternative. Especially since iTunes uses a dumbed-down encoder to create the crap they sell (Their AAC files sound HORRIBLE because of it!)

Enjoy the album!"
