,Heyntjes123,2011-08-23T11:56Z,"Thanks for the upload,

but I have a question.

When I play the game, it runs very slow. How can I solve this?"
[T],PirateBoy,2011-08-23T13:42Z,"@Heyntjes123

Well, you can try this and tell me if it works.

Go to ""Config"" -> ""Frame Skip"". Here, uncheck the ""Limit Framerate"" and check the ""Auto-minimize skipping"" options.

This should increase your overall game-speed.

Now, if you want more speed, then select option ""9"" in ""Frame Skip"".
Hope this helps......enjoy.....:)"

Trading isn't possible on a emulator, but if you mean on the actual DS then just need 2 DS's and both games and go to pokemon centre and trade whatever pokemon you want. You can't link with DeSmuMe. The only option to obtain the Pokemon you want is to edit your save with Pokesav, google for it to find the webpage. 
Don't use cheats...i recommend it....but if you really wanna finish the game in emulator(PC)...use PokeSav Cheat...

If you want....I will upload PokeSav.

Regards....seed n enjoy... :)"
