,Nash6989,2011-08-24T06:19Z,I wish they would hurry up and release more Regular show.. that and superjail are probably the best 10 minute cartoons so far

,dinosaur58,2011-09-10T20:52Z,"If anyone has the right software and skills to sync it I captured [and deinterlaced] a clean 720p video stream + 6 channel AC3 audio of this episode. The sync 'wanders' off and back on twice. It's weird, I've seen this once before and could never get it to work. I would offer to upload the raw 1080p transport stream [which is synced], but it's 700 mb for 11 min. "

760Mb, Plays on my PC using MediaPlayerClassic.

Sorry about the huge size for 11 min show. I tried to convert it using Avidemux but the sound spazzed."
,dinosaur58,2011-09-12T05:47Z,"That was quick! Here is the 160Mb 720p mkv encoded by Asussin.
