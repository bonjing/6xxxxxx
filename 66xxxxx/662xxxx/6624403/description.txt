Adventure Time 305a, Adventure Time with Fiona and Cake.

Two things:

I\'ve called this Adventure Time 305a, Adventure Time with Fiona and Cake. I\'m not actually sure if this is 304b, or 305a. According to all the episode guides I can find, 304b was supposed to be called Wizard Battle, and air next Monday. If I\'m wrong feel free to hate me. Or just rename the thing.

And the quality is really not great. It\'s worse than the other low quality episodes I\'ve uploaded. I\'m sorry about that. But this is an episode a lot of people have been looking forward to, so I\'m going to up this for now anyway. As soon as I can find a better version, it\'s yours.

Enjoy.
