rec. Aug. 1967 in Nesbit, Miss. by George Mitchell


In the 1920's and 1930's all the major labels were deeply invested in the blues, 'sending mobile recording units all over the south in search of talent. In the late 1950's and early 1960's the major labels were no longer recording blues, although that would change as the blues revival kicked into gear. Instead of mobile recordings units there was a committed group of collectors roaming the south in search of the old time bluesmen that appeared on their cherished 78s; men like Mississippi John Hurt, Skip James, Bukka White, Furry Lewis and Son House. They most certainly werenâ€™t looking for a minor figure like Joe Callicott, who waxed a lone 78 in Memphis in 1930, the year before played second guitar on Garfield Akersâ€™ â€œCottonfield Blues Parts 1 & 2.â€ It was the indefatigable field recorder George Mitchell who found him in Nesbit, Mississippi off Highway 51 not far from Hernando and short distance from Brights where Akers was supposedly born. It appears Mitchell was looking for Callicott although itâ€™s unclear if he was tipped off about his whereabouts or if it was his own initiative: â€œOn that Saturday in Hernando, we pulled up in front of a cluster of Black men shooting the bull in front of the courthouse and spitting tobacco juice on the sidewalk. â€¦I asked if anyone had ever heard of Joe Callicott.â€ He was directed to Nesbit, seven miles south where he was greeted by a smiling, friendly man: â€œHow yâ€™all doing? Have a seat. Iâ€™m Joe.â€

Callicottâ€™s â€œcomebackâ€ was about as short as his first recording career, lasting from the summer of 1967 through the summer of 1968; he recorded nineteen sides for Mitchell either late August or early September (split between Revivalâ€™s Deal Gone Down and Arhoolieâ€™s Mississippi Delta Blues â€“ â€œBlow My Blues Awayâ€ Vol. 2) four sides at the 1968 Memphis Country Blues Festival (split between The 1968 Memphis Country Blues Festival and Stars Of The 1969-1970 Memphis Country Blues Festival) and seventeen sides for Blue Horizon in 1968 which have all been issued in 2007 as Furry Lewis & Mississippi Joe Callicott: The Complete Blue Horizon Sessions.
