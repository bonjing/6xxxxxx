,huldu,2011-08-24T04:22Z,"hootieman... seriously dude. You working for hulu or something? Well, if you are... tell them to ""lift"" their restrictions. You see... you can only watch episodes on hulu *if* you're an american. It's totally shit elsewhere. "
,roytastic,2011-08-24T06:44Z,"funny because im an american and you can't watch the new season of hell's kitchen unless you subcribe to their hulu plus for $9 a month which is BS because you still get bombarded with ads.  what a joke hulu is, american or not."
