Not in these days."
,weerab1981,2011-08-26T23:35Z,"you cant put 720p then show a res of 1280x544.

,meothui,2011-08-27T08:33Z,"Thanks for the upload but IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SMASH YOUR TV WATCHING THIS SHIT, DON'T DOWNLOAD.
LAME STUPID FUCKING MOVIE.

A=10
V=10
M=01 "
,Kadoma,2011-08-27T14:58Z,"I love the dummies who constantly complain about videos that are not ""truly"" 720p. If they got out the house more and perhaps actually saw a movie IN A MOVIE THEATER, they'd realize few blockbuster type flicks share the same 16:9 aspect ratio of TVs and monitors and are far wider. Anyway some simple math: Take 544 and add 176 LINES OF BLACK FUCKING NOTHING and you'll get your 720, or ask uploaders to permanently hard code the black lines into the video for you so you'll be happy with true 720 videos.  "
,weerab1981,2011-08-27T21:36Z,"^^ these are taken from BRrips = discs!! not straight from movie theatre dummy!!!! 
oh yeah forgot that the black lines, which are becoming less and less common with blu-ray as they are wanting the films to fill the whole of a tv screen, actually contribute to the pixel ratio of a film!!!! DUMMY"
,Kadoma,2011-08-28T15:43Z,"Man you're slow in the head. Or maybe it's not your fault, maybe schools today don't teach simple math and geometry. Or they don't want to negatively affect children's self esteem by telling them that the square peg does not fit in the round hole. Anyway smart guy, if you have a box that's one 3 meters in length and one meter in height, can it fit inside another box that's 2 meters in length and 1 meter in height? Either you have to cut of the edges, or shrink it and have space at the top and bottom. NOT ALL MOVIES ARE THE SAME ASPECT RATIO, and few are 16:9, the ratio that results in 1280x720"

As for ""they are wanting the films to fill the whole of a tv screen"", it's nothing new, it's been done for decades going back to when all TV's were 4:3 requiring films to be ""pan and scanned"" (edges selectively cropped out. However it's done (permanently cropped, or temporarily cropped and stretched digitally, it's crap.

Thank you froggie100 :)"
,wroth91,2011-09-18T19:21Z,"720p is a relative label now, get with the times... btw, I'm so glad this movie is finally out, been sitting here with a cam version but could never bring myself to actually watch it cause I love these movies ^..^ haven't downloaded yet but I've used your torrents before and they are great... and the VIP badge helps attest to quality XD"
,Malasky,2011-09-19T06:55Z,"Thanks froggie. Quality, as usual, is excellent. Top marks, pal."
,mukaas,2011-10-14T20:39Z,thx

,kornypony,2011-10-29T06:52Z,"Kadoma is right, but don't bother explaining to n00bs, they'll find out about it themselves later on."

,Sit3UserX,2011-12-26T22:55Z,Good quality. A:10 & V:9. Thanks.
,rjorekit1,2012-02-28T19:51Z,did you all take your stupid pills today?  720p = 1280 pixels wide.  pixel height doesn't mean shit when talking about HD resolutions.
