NBA Rules History (XIV):
------------------------

Take a look back at some of the rules changes that have taken place over the years.
(Changes/clarifications implemented prior to season, except where noted) 
-------
1976-77
-------
- Excessive and/or vigorous swinging of the elbows, without contact, is a violation.
- If a defensive player causes the ball to go out-of-bounds, the offensive team, on regaining the ball for throw-in, shall now have the unexpired time or 5 seconds (instead of 10), whichever is longer, to attempt a shot.
- For an inbounds play for the last two minutes, the offensive team has the option of moving the ball to midcourt or taking it at the spot following a timeout.
- The â€œforce outâ€ rule is eliminated.
- If less than five seconds appear on the 24-second clock when the offensive team is entitled to a throw-in, the clock will be reset to five seconds.
- The team that gains possession after the opening tap will put the ball into play at their opponentâ€™s end line to begin the fourth period. The team losing the opening tap will put the ball into play at their opponentâ€™s end line at the beginning of the second and third quarters.
In putting the ball into play, the thrower-in may run along the end line or pass it to a teammate who is also out-of-bounds at the end line--as after a score.
- Any player who engages in a fight is subject to a fine of $10,000 and a suspension.
This went into effect March 7, 1977.
