I have downloaded 4 or 5 movies from you today and just had the time to watch parts of them on my 63 inch TV, The Quality is fantastic for such a small file and the sound is good on all I have downloaded.
I am seeding all I get from you, Thank you for the great service."

,vatnahaus,2011-09-10T23:43Z,seed please
,Fanchig,2011-09-12T00:26Z,"As seen on a 15,6' laptop :
A 10
V 9
Subs 10 
Movie 6

One of those movies where the best comes from the soundtrack (by the Chemical Brothers in this case).
A couple of good actors though as well as interesting camera works all along the movie. Too bad the scenario was that basic - quite surprising actually considering the rest."
,KelvinOS,2011-09-12T22:38Z,"Cheers man, top quality"
,triflemenot,2011-09-17T00:55Z,Fine film. I would hate to meet the bozos dissing it.
,Thragrash,2011-09-18T19:30Z,Thanks FXG. You are the best as always as far as we talk about 700Mb rips. And adding subs is something that someone like me who doesn't speak english as first language does really appreciate.
,StanlyManly,2011-09-19T12:52Z,"Pretty much the best quality out there like always.  Nobody beats you guys on that or anything else, and at only 700MB.. I can't thank you enough guys.
