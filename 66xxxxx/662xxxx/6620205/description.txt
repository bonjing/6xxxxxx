Burning Tutorial from HD-R-US

By using ImgBurn and selecting "Write image file to disc", this iso can be burnt straight to a DVD5 disc to be played back on any stand-alone, AVCHD compatible, Blu-ray or DVD-HD player, including PS3. Please note that regular DVD players are incapable of rendering Hi-Definition video, so they will NOT play this movie without re-encoding it.

Alternatively, if you want to stream the movie or watch it on your computer, Daemon Tools virtual drive can be used to mount the image file, or PowerISO v4.5 or any later version can be used to extract the files and folders from the iso. This is a blu-ray/AVCHD iso, not a DVD iso, so applications like WinRAR or MagicISO will NOT recognise it. The movie file itself will be located in the BDMV/STREAM folder, and will be named "00000.m2ts". Once extracted, if you decide to save the movie by burning it onto a DVD5 disc, your ImgBurn settings need to be as follows:-

Click "Write files/folders to disc"
Add both the BDMV and CERTIFICATE folders
Select the Options Tab-
Data Type = MODE1/2048
File System = UDF
UDF Revision = 2.50
Make sure that the "Recurse Subdirectories" field IS checked, and all other fields are NOT checked.
Insert your DVD5 disc and click Burn.

The relevant codecs need to be installed to watch any HD movie on your computer. K-Lite's codec pack is free to download, but there are numerous others.

This disc image includes the PGS stream subtitles that are listed above, but unless they are marked as being hard-coded, they will NOT display if you watch the movie on your computer, hence why we have also included .srt format subtitles so that you can add/load then to your media player manually if required.

Fair warning - Many computers will struggle to render Hi-Def video smoothly unless they're up-to-date and/or fast, so if the movie is sluggish or out-of-sync, don't worry; it's your hardware, not us! (=

Please Visit HD-R-US, they have the best AVCHD torrent...Leave comments so i can improve my next upload, or i should quit sharing or re-ecoding =))
