Amazon Review:
The first time you hear it it'll sound somewhat alien as there's a few songs here that you'll recognise from her later album but they are stripped back and don't have the big production sound of her Spirit Room album. It's almost as if Michelle has acoustically revisited the songs. 'Paper pieces' is just a different sounding song altogether that I've heard from her, very rock band sounding. Carrying on the cd you get into beautiful melodic songs such as 'Stewart's Coat', 'I'll always be right there' and 'Leap of faith' the guitar is prominent and vocals from Michelle are superb.
