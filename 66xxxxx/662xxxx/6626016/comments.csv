I recently received it in the mail and I just finished making a torrent for it here on TPB. So enjoy! I'll make an effort to seed it soon for your sake. Not many people scour the Internet for Penpals... we are among the few! I now have their first four albums... but I'm broke. Lemme know if you get the fifth (or any other) one! Haha, be well."
