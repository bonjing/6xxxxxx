As a former software developer who made a nice living with FoxPro
2.5 application development (accounting systems and inventory control
systems along with Point of Sale systems in addition to several other
vertical market applications too) I can tell you this piece of software
was a goldmine for those with an understanding of the needs of users 
and the willingness to provide the features and functionality required
to make the best use of it as a tool in the service of humankind.
I had a number of well known companies using my software and development 
expertise in Canada, USA and the United Kingdom especially.

It is still a great help to us today, we use it to maintain email lists
and to create them for Outlook 2000 etc, and I'm planning to write an 
Accounting application again soon to post here for you as a free download
equally!


Bill Gates should give this away too 
(along with placing XP into the public domain)!

If you need to try the different versions for ease of development and
use generally speaking here is a portable version of visual Foxpro version
9 as found on the net posted by - Birungueta - although we also have 
versions 2.5 and 2.6 available on a separate download for you to perhaps
settle for instead too.
