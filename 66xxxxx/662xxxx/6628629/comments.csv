Update: Just tried playing the first 2...it told me Window.dll was missing from my computer. So I downloaded and registered it...then it gave me the same message. I'm using Windows 7.
Don't bother with this one."
,crapdude,2011-09-09T18:42Z,Ohk we need the code on the CD they say... now what????
,Thordrac,2011-09-19T15:39Z,"Managed to start Goblet of Fire. 

Unzip the ""0compressed"" file and copy the files to the main map. Then copy the crack to the main map aswell, and then play, using the crack file (gof_f)"
,tanwie2006,2011-10-09T11:08Z,"the Harry Potter Sorcerers Stone,
Harry Potter Chamber of Secrets,
Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire, works fine with the crack except the Harry Potter Prison Of Azkaban that doesn't have a no cd crack. so i can't play it, it ask me to insert the cd, i have look the directory where the game is stored but there is no crack there. so upload the no cd crack for Harry Potter Prison Of Azkaban pls."
,tahathar,2011-11-01T19:59Z,"i can't get the 0compressed file unzipped, it says the file is of unknown format or damaged, how to fix this?"
