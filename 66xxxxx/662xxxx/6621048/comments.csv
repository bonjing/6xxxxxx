,AndroidLove,2011-08-22T09:14Z,Is this finally the real deal? This is the only hi-res version on here right now that doesn't have a .rar compression and is uploaded by eztv. Can anyone who has downloaded this please re-confirm as this episode seems to have a couple of fakes floating around.
,fo0ki,2011-08-22T10:46Z,"It's eztv

No need to ask - just download and enjoy!"
,Osceana,2011-08-22T11:47Z,"This is it. I downloaded a bunch of fakes too and was worried this would be the same, but it's the real deal. Enjoy! (And a special F U to all the people that upload fakes every week)"
,arr1829,2011-08-22T11:48Z,why;s is this ep 1.55gb when previous eps have been ~1gb ?
,Osceana,2011-08-22T11:48Z,p.s. I will probably seed for the next week or so. This one took a bit.
,Osceana,2011-08-22T11:50Z,"@arr1829: Don't know, but mine came in at 1.66 GB, even though this ays 1.55. Strange. Like I said though, it's the real deal. It just finished downloading for me and I am watching the ""last week on...."" now."
,edvedder4,2011-08-24T00:57Z,por que este episodio es de 1.55gib si los demas son de 1gib no entiendo?????
,DeedotBo,2011-08-29T04:59Z,you are the God of bit torrents......u are th captain of pirate bay!!!!!!!1 argggghhhh! Eztv!!!!!
,kornbred69,2011-08-29T09:24Z,ALSWAYS check for eztv as the uploader! the green skull x-bones there are 2 versions of almost everything he posts... small file size and large.... the smaller one means you watch it at normal rez shitty sound (tho 256kbs is crap to me...)
