It is rivaled only by the EMMANUELLE series for its daring sexuality and enduring popularity. And in this first - and best - sequel to the erotic smash JOY, French hardcore goddess turned respected actress Brigitte Lahaie (HENRY & JUNE) takes over the titular role of the international supermodel with a relentless passion for sexual pleasure. This time, Joy flees the betrayals and depravities of her male lovers only to find ecstasy with a gorgeous tour guide (the delicious Isabelle Solar). But can one woman find a way to fulfill Joy's most intimate and shocking desire?

Former porn star Brigitte Lahaie gives Emmanuelle a run for her money in this soft-core drama about a globe-trotting model with an insatiable sexual appetite. Betrayed and defiled by her depraved male lovers, gorgeous glamour queen Joy (Lahaie) discovers pleasures she never imagined with a lusty tour guide (Isabelle Solar) who knows how to please a woman.
