'World of Omnia' is a document of OMNIA's past, present, and future. Containing new material like the cult hit "Old man Tree" and revised older works as well as some original material taken from previous releases, this album illustrates OMNIA's path through time; its roots, the transformation, and also the elements that will always remain. As usual this new CD comes with a beautifully illustrated booklet.

"World of Omnia" was released on July 31st 2009 (release party at the Dutch fantasy festival "Castlefest")
