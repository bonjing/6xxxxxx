Abnormal Psychology could not have been written a decade ago.  The collaborative effort of a clinical psychologist (Rosenberg) and a cognitive neuroscientist (Kosslyn) provides students with a fascinating, progressive, and modern view of how psychopathology is studied, understood, experienced, and treated today.  

Like no other text, it integrates the next generation of the biopsychosocial approach by including what we have learned about the brain and its role in psychological disorders.  This new neuropsychological approach shows the dynamic interplay between the neurological, psychological, and social factors involved in understanding psychological disorders and their treatment.   Equally important, Rosenberg and Kosslyn include captivating clinical material that puts a human face on psychological disorders.  The text includes page after page of riveting case studies, examples, quotes, and critical thinking exercises.  

By combining the neuropsychosocial approach with rich clinical material, students are provided with the â€œbig pictureâ€ of abnormal psychology so they can understand and remember it, and apply it to the world around them.
