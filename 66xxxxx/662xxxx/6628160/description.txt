How to use
----------

Start Trainer or Game in any order you like.

---------------
Switched Cheats
---------------

1: MOVEMENT SWITCH:
This cheat will give unlimited movement points to units. Activate it and then click any unit, in any number, in any priority and move them around. Always remember to deactivate a switched cheat before making another turn.

Set the initial movement point in the left editbox to set a default initial value for your units. Why would you want to set a initial movement score when the movement is already infinite?

The reason is simple: Because if you have 1 movement point left, it will cancel if you try to move it more than 1 hex, its pretty annoying. The default initial value is already set so you do not need to worry about it.

2: EXPERIENCE SWITCH:
This cheat will give experience to your units. Set a initial experience value in the editbox on the left, then click all your units. You only need to click them once. Then deactivate the cheat when finished.

3: HEALING SWITCH:
This cheat will set health points on your units. Set the health point you want in the editbox on the left side (it can be in the range of 0-10 where 0 is no health and 10 is full health) Then click all units you want to set this health value upon. Deactivate the cheat when finished.

4: CITY MODIFIER SWITCH:
This is probably the most complex cheat to use. (It's really not that complex). This cheat will set the city modifier value (it is in percentage %).

It will set the modifier value on 3 things: Production, Science and Gold. To have this cheat work you will need to buy OR sell a building that affects any of these 3 areas. Thats it.

Quick hint: I recommend buying:
University (to enable modifier for science)
Factory (to enable production modifier)
Stock Exchange (to enable gold modifier)

You can also sell buildings that affects these areas, the modifier will update that way too.

UpDown Controls
---------------

I have added Up-Down controls to all edit boxes in the program.
You may change values in an edit box in many ways:

1: Click a button to choose a predefined value.
2: Click the edit box and type a custom value.
3: Click the up-down control buttons to change values.
4: Use the up-down arrow keys on your keyboard.
5: Use mouse wheel to change values.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Q1: Trainer doesnt work?
A1: Use only with Civ 5 version 1.0.1.348. It will not work with other versions.

Q2: Trainer still doesnt work?
A2: Your firewall/antivirus blocked it or sandboxed it. Unblock it, shut down trainer and restart it again

Q3: Trainer is still not working?
A3: The 6 primary cheats will only update after you click a city or do a next turn.

Q4: I use WinXP and the trainer runs and quits almost instantly?
A4: Try to run it using Win98 Compatability mode.
