,gigie555,2011-08-24T06:58Z,Extremezone. Every movie I've downloaded from you seems to stop playing halfway through it when I play the avi file on my dvd player though the usb slot. What program are you using to rip these movies? It's awfully annoying.
,pantaylor,2011-08-24T10:25Z,"Hi gigie555
They always did the same thing for me as well. Normally around 3/4 the way through.
I brought a WD media player and won't look back. It plays everything and no need to burn anymore. Under $100.

Extreme rocks"
,majorbeef,2011-08-25T07:05Z,It probably has more to do with your player.  Don't be a cheapass n*gger and get a home theater PC.

,listenherenow,2011-08-25T13:50Z,"people with the movie shutting off in the middle - actually 3/4 of the way through. This problem was not happening a while back but it does now. My dvd/divx player is doing the exact same shit, pisses me off. 
  seems as though any movie - avi or not, that is downloaded, that is over 1 gig will not play for shit all the way through.  

 No one will tell me why - everything i put in there no matter how big it was , wwould play with no problems until this year. 

  what i found is that if I convertthe whole thing to dvd ntsf  i usually do 8000kbs, and then burn it to a disk it plays fine.  thats the only way I can do it though.   they will not play straight off my usb stick anymore, really sucks.  wastes all my blank dvd's.  can't put two per disk either caus teh convert generally is bigger than 2.3 gigs so another will not fit. 

  wtf is a wd player?   what is the change that makes them only play 3/4 of the way ? why was that change nessesary?   "
,pantaylor,2011-08-26T11:40Z,"Hi listenherenow 

It's a Western Digital media player and it might be the cheap way out but has fixed all my problems. I don't burn disks anymore just copy to a thumb drive and transfer to an external drive via the media player. Also I now have all movies in one spot and can watch any of them at any time. If something changes in the coding of the movies in the future you can upgrade it easy as.

Goodluck with it, it use to piss me off to no end when they stopped half way and I had to watch the rest using vlc."

,gigie555,2011-09-03T08:27Z,"@pantaylor

But this problem only happens with extremezone's movies. I have downloaded avi's from many other sources with no problem playing them on my dvd player. This leads me to believe there may be an incompatability or improper setting in his burning program that causes some dvd players to stop playing them in the middle of the movie. Anyway I thought he should be aware of this, hope he has a chance to read it."
