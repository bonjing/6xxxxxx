aspireos_1 +  update (2011-08-16)
I made this AROS distribution for ACER Aspire One A110, A150 and ZG5 owners. It might work with other hardware, but will not be supported by me. With this Distro I want to stay as true to the original AmigaOS as possible, but at the same time being much more modern. The included software is well tested and also configured in some ways to take best advantage of Aspire One hardware. This distribution comes in .iso format. You can read more about that in the installation page.
If you install AspireOS v.1 there will be updates announced on this page, or join the mailing list aspireos@googlegroups.com

This is the first update for AspireOS v.1
It is required that you have AspireOS v.1 installed on your Computer.
Just unpack and replace files in your System: (AROS:) folder.

The most easy way to do this is shown in this video.
There are 2 new games. Rise of the triad (3d shooter) and a more recent compile of 
Rick Dangerous where joystick is working.
There are also some new configuration files for both DOpus and other programs.
Rest are more recent AROS system files with some bug fixes. 

Have fun.
