,geeguh,2011-08-21T21:45Z,Audio is hosed. Sputters half way through and then no audio for the last half. 
[T],V100,2011-08-22T00:20Z,"Thanks. Bad in VLC player. Works well in Windows Media Player Classic, WMPlayer, Nero Showtime and Real Can't seem to delete torrent. I'll rework it and unload it as a different rip."
,Hulagu,2011-08-22T17:13Z,"1. When you say it 'works well' in wmplayer, nero showtime, etc., do you mean to say the audio will be synced and working properly in the those players, and you're only going to rework it to improve its playback in VLC player?

2.  When you do 'rework' it, if you could please leave a link for the new version on this thread, it would be highly appreciated

3.  Thanks a tonne* for uploading this.  Nova (along with Frontline) is the finest investigative program produced in the U.S,, and anytime somebody can upload an episode which is no longer readily available, it's a cause for celebration.

*A metric tonne, none of that shorte tonne bullshit."

[T],V100,2011-08-22T22:18Z,Perfect in WMP classic. I don't do much with VLC but I have a player and it doesn't like it. Maybe something adjusting... The torrent stays as long as the delete function is disabled. If I find the time I'll re-code with (ACC or whatever works) and then add new torrent that is VLC friendly. I'll put VLC in title and add a link for it here. 
[T],V100,2011-08-22T22:26Z,WMP Classic is only ~5mb and it's freeware. It is a handy thing to keep on the desktop. If you drag a file to the icon it opens fast and will play almost anything. You can also have multiple players open at the same time.
