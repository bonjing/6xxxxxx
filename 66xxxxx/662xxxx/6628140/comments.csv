,evilhomer1969,2011-08-25T00:11Z,This isn't an album from Metallica - it's an album honoring Metallica.   Various artists are doing the Black Album in their own style.  Pretty cool !

Lemmy (Enter Sandman) and Naera (Through The Never) versions are real gems. 

I've no idea who NAERA are and I've never been a fan of this death/speed/etc. stuff but these guys did a VERY impressive job, in my opinion. The song really sneaks up on you.

The rest of the tracks, however, are absolute sacrilege. I've heard better karaoke jobs at the local pub.

Doro??!! Please..."
