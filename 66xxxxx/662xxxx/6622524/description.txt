Hi, guys! I know I don't have many devoted followers that actually comment/come to me looking for new music, but I figured I might as well post this for theahppiestEMO, because it seems to be something right up his ally. All thank yous can be directed to him.  

This is a discography for a Finnish post-hardcore band called Snow White's Poison Bite that my girlfriend got me into. They are kinda like a harder version of Black Veil Brides and sound a lot like Get Scared. 

This, like most of my other torrents, is a result of me looking high and low over the internet to find stuff from an unknown emo band that other people are having trouble finding the music of. I found it and think it is the most annoying thing ever to have to hunt for something. So I uploaded this so you don't have to look. 

It's mostly 128 kbps. I included the following:
