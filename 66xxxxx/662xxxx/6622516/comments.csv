,Diovos,2011-08-28T03:59Z,Where did you got this? It's without Disney's Logo
,kbhasi,2011-08-31T14:50Z,@Diovos he took it from the DVD 
,Diovos,2011-09-03T01:40Z,@kbhasi But this is 720p HD. The DVD has regular quality (480p)...
,Ultraball,2011-09-03T05:57Z,"@Diovos ""HD DVD"""
,Diovos,2011-09-10T22:43Z,"@Ultraball HD DVDs doesn't exist. If you mean Blu-ray Disc, the movie has only been released in DVD, not Blu-ray."
,TerryN,2011-09-13T15:23Z,"it says HDTV in the info, but if the logo is missing, it's not from TV.
But if there's no BluRay and it's not HDTV, then it can't be 720p.
So the question remains, what is it?
My best guess is an upscaled DVDRip."
,AnonyMissMe,2011-09-21T20:39Z,"Man you guys are paranoid. This was posted a day before the DVD was even released. It is an HDTV source, just not a USA source. If you download it you will see a TV rating card in the top-left at the start."
,Diovos,2011-10-07T17:38Z,"It look like this was downloaded from iTunes, but there's no HD version there, too."
,Diovos,2011-10-07T17:39Z,"Oh, and sorry, Ultruball. HD DVDs do exist. But the movie wasn't released in it, too."
,Diovos,2011-10-09T19:15Z,"And, no it's not an upscaled version of the DVD, because the DVD ending is different from this one (the DVD doesn't end with ""Kick It Up a Knotch"")."
,tendmex,2011-10-21T08:06Z,I don't have Sound?
,AnonyMissMe,2011-10-22T21:24Z,@tendmex Get AC3filter or similar.
,finisher489,2011-11-01T09:49Z,"This is definitely not an upscaled DVD cos if it was the quality would be terrible!!!! HDTV Channels and Blu-Ray are the only 2 proper HD sources nowadays and BTW Nobody uploads upscaled DVD because it's just too stupid and once people get it, they'll realise that it's upscaled straight away"
