Storyline:
In the mid-21st century, the nations of a dying Earth look starward for a solution and set out to colonize Mars.
But something no one could have expected awaits. Houston, we have big trouble. Val Kilmer, Carrie-Anne Moss and Tom Sizemore star in this taut adventure
about humankindâ€™s first mission to the mysterious Red Planet.
Also on the mission is the multifunctional robo-assistant AMEE. In one mode, she's a as loyal as a puppy. But a malfunction has locked her into a far different mode:
a killing machine bent on destroying the crew.
Yet thatâ€™s not the end of the expeditionâ€™s perils. Because Mars may be barren, but itâ€™s not uninhabited.
