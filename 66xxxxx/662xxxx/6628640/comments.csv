Snì±„lla Seeda!
Por favor, este torrent esta muy muy lento."
[T],trialNerror,2011-08-25T09:12Z,"Of course it's slow for some.  I just released it like 40 minutes ago and there's only one seeder - ME!  If you are able to connect to me it won't be slow, but that's only going to be for a couple people.  First come, first serve.  Those that are in the peer list show D/L speeds of anything from 100-200kb/s.  What are you expecting, 1Mb/s speeds?  Psh. Yea. Right.  "
