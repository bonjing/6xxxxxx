,jenchai,2011-09-15T23:43Z,Yes this stuff is real. The studio just don't make millions of Blu ray disks the night before they decided to release. They starts making 10-30 days ago or more. And who saying one of those disks didnt got uploaded here. There are lots of release teams who gets those disks.
