                             The Complete Series


The Hour is a 2011 BBC six-part television drama series.

The series is a behind-the-scenes drama and espionage thriller in Cold War-era England that centers on a journalist, a producer, and an anchorman for an investigative news programme.

With a highly competitive, sharp-witted and passionate love triangle at the heart of the series, it's through the lives of enigmatic Bel and her rivals, Freddie and Hector, that viewers will witness the decade on the threshold of change â€“ from the ruthless sexual politics behind the polite social faÃ§ade of the Fifties to the revelations that redefined the world for a new generation.
Over the six episodes, the interplay and intense ambitions between our rising news team play out against the backdrop of a mysterious murder and Freddie's controversial and dangerous investigation.
Ben Whishaw plays Freddie Lyon, a brilliant and outspoken journalist, whose passion endlessly lands him in trouble. Getting to the truth of a story can be a dangerous and risky business and it's Bel, his contemporary and best friend, who is always there to bail him out. For Freddie, Bel is so much more as well â€“ if only he were brave enough to tell her.
Romola Garai plays Bel Rowley, spirited and ambitious and facing the most exciting and daunting challenge of her life â€“ running The Hour. Can her passion for the truth survive the political pressure the job will bring â€“ and will her friendship with Freddie survive her undeniable attraction to front man Hector?
Dominic West plays Hector Madden, charming, charismatic â€“ a man whose upbringing and education have instilled in him a sense of entitlement and whose glamorous young wife has the family connections to get him the job as front man on The Hour. But, beneath the confident faÃ§ade, Hector has a lot to prove. Bel provides the challenge â€“ and the spark.
The Hour's supporting cast includes Tim Pigott-Smith and Juliet Stevenson as Lord and Lady Elms; Anton Lesser as Clarence Fendley, the BBC's Head of News; Anna Chancellor as Lix, The Hour's brave and maverick hard-drinking foreign correspondent; Julian Rhind-Tutt as Angus McCain, the Prime Minister's eyes and ears; and Oona Chaplin as Marnie Madden, Hector's spoilt beautiful wife.
