,Brekemoff,2011-09-08T09:23Z,"I have a feeling Ross is a jerk behind the scenes. And I still don't get why he turned his rage to Jason, who was responding to a different matter."
,tvmogul,2011-09-09T00:43Z,"He raged at Jason because Ross is one of the NY douchebags who thinks he's hot shit. I work with guys like him ALL THE TIME. He's really just a little fish in a big pond who happens to have a few big-shot friends, so he takes his rage out on smaller people, ie. Jason."
,Brekemoff,2011-09-18T23:02Z,"Yeah Ross sucks. I can't wait to watch ""The Newly-weird Game"", I purposefully didn't listen to I could watch the htv version."
,Brekemoff,2011-10-01T00:50Z,"I haven't seen any shows in a while, everything okay? "
