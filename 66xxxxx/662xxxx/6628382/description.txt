EXCELLENT ALL-AROUND KARATE PRIMER!, 
 If you've ever been interested in learning about what karate is, why it is, what to do with it, or how it works, THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK YOU SHOULD PICK UP! Written by renowned karate historian Randall G. Hassell and Edmond Otis (a leading technical karate expert), this book is a very easy and FUN read that you'll refer back to for years to come. The authors have over 65 years of karate experience between them and it shows. No stone is left unturned, no punches are pulled (no pun intended!) and they don't talk down to you - every sentence compels you to read the next, and the next, and so on. Excellent photography and graphics help you visualize everything, from techniques to tying your belt, it's everything you need to get started in your karate training!
