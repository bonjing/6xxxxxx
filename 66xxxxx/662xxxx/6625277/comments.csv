,cowidster,2011-08-24T02:57Z,"@Patric: Did you have made boot disk of the program, and is it work as genuine? I am afraid of this kind of problem, because the last time I use the program is ok on the installation, but not ok on making boot disk.When I boot from acronis boot disk, it said that the copy of software is not genuine."
[V],Anacondaz,2011-08-24T03:09Z,+1 rep for the nice work pal
,PatrickIV,2011-08-24T13:31Z,"@cowidster:  No problem making the boot disc, however I found out its not necessary.  All I did to recover was pick and choose, then rebooted.  On reboot, it went right in and recovered/restored the image.  FYI."
,nickie1801,2011-08-26T19:40Z,"It is not so simple to recover with a bootdisc, specially when the drive has more partitions. They mixed up easily. In case of a not booting windows: just install windows again on its original partition and install only Acronis True Image home. Now you're able to restore your originally backup safely"
[T],TrettioSju,2011-08-28T11:00Z,"To reinstall without bootdisk then windows fail to boot, better do like this

""Click Tools & Utilities on the menu bar and select Acronis Startup Recovery Manager
Click the Activate button""

Now you are able to press F11 then computer boots up (black screen) and run a simple restoreprogram.

No need to install a dummy windows LOL"
,nickie1801,2011-08-31T21:21Z,"@ TrettioSju: thanks for pointing me about the F11 button. But it looks like the same as booting from a disk. Here comes the difficult part:  "" specify recovery setting of partition 1-1 "" I noticed that with more partitions on one drive, the drive letters change during this recovering. So my original C:\ drive was not recovered, but a data partition. Anyway, need to read the manual later on"

,PIRATE-555,2011-10-16T21:52Z,"Hey Mates:  I tried this version with my Win-7 64bit system, but it was a NO-GO.  I tried as administrator and for compatibility with everything above XP-SP2, but nothing I tried worked for me... 
From other reports I suspect the program will work fine with other OS/32bit.
