Do you have the urge to take the casing off your Windows-based PC and tinker around, but youâ€™re a little intimidated? If so, get this book first. The text is clear and well-indexed, and this book will give you the information, and then, confidence, that you need. (It would also be a great book for anyone who wants to help recycle old computers for schools or non-profits). Two Torx blades up!
