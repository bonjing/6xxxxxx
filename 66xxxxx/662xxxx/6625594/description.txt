Countdown with Keith Olbermann from Current.TV - Tuesday, August 23, 2011

SORRY FOR THE INTERMITTENT CRACKLING AUDIO IN THE FIRST ~5 MINUTES; THAT'S HOW IT WAS IN THE SOURCE.

Guests include:
o  Environmentalist and author Bill McKibben: www.TarSandsAction.org
o  Comedian Paul F. Tompkins

"Please watch Keith on Current if you can get the channel, harass your cable company if you cannot. Keep celebrating freedom of news."
