,barometerrising,2011-08-24T16:11Z,"Yes, MANY thanks for this, from another American expat. When Keith was on MSNBC, of course, it was possible to download and watch copies of the program any time, even here in Europe. That can't be done with the Current broadcasts, though, but I guess you can't really blame Current. They have to increase their subscriber base somehow, and putting complete broadcasts of ""Countdown"" online, certainly would not contribute to that."
