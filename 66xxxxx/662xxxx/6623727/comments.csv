,PoliteMan,2011-08-24T08:35Z,I noticed after I uploaded this that the id tags are not complete. Just the song titles. It is an easy fix in the advanced tag editor on Wmplayer. Had I known before then I would have corrected it. Nevertheless the quality is very good so you should be ok. I have noticed upon looking around that this has happened to a few uploaders of this album upon ripping from CD. Sorry for any inconvenience. Happy listening. PoliteMan :)
