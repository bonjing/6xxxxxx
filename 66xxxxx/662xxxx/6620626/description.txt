Using TechTool Pro, you don\'t need to be an expert. With an easy-to-use interface, single-click diagnostics scan critical CPU, memory, video hardware and more to identify impending problems to help you prevent costly repairs. New in version 6, TechTool Pro ships standard in a 3 user Family Pack, yet provides a comprehensive suite of tests that also delivers for the Mac professional.

The TechTool Pro dashboard makes everything easily accessible from a single location

TechTool Pro\'s hard drive tools are second to none. Create an emergency startup partition on the active system volume using TechTool Pro\'s eDrive, without ever having to boot from a DVD. Perform a SMART test on your internal ATA or SATA drives to detect changes in reliability, and repair corrupt or damaged HFS+ volumes, including those in newer solid-state devices (SSD\'s).

Use TechTool Pro\'s Volume Cloning to create exact duplicates of your volumes for trouble-free archiving. Plus, TechTool Pro helps you recover deleted files and lost data. If bad blocks are found when scanning your hard drive, you can identify and restore the corrupted files within them from previous backups you have archived.

To help keep your Mac running at peak performance, use TechTool Pro to optimize your volumes after defragmenting your files, or to repair disk permissions which may prevent problems accessing applications or files on your Mac.

TechTool Pro also helps with device management within your local area network (LAN). To monitor the configuration or security of your LAN, TechTool Pro displays Bonjour supported devices and active services, and helps track devices no longer available to the monitored network.

Count on TechTool Pro to provide total, continuous protection by monitoring your system, alerting you when aberrant behavior is detected, and helping you maintain top performance for your Mac every day.
