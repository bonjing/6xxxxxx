The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This twenty-ninth alphabetical installment is: DC from Leh-Lz

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.

================================

Some of you may not have noticed that this series has been posted by me ondemonoid, and the pirate bay. Recently it has begun appearing on the newly resurrected zcult.fm posted by the "not-quite-so dead-after-all" DieSmurfDie, which is very fitting, since though he's not exactly returned from the grave, he had gone beyond the reach of mortal kind. Well almost. He's back and busy making the world safe for non-blue people once again. I suspect he has risen to an even higher state in the deeper magical workings of the comics kingdoms than before. Privy to the inner councils, friend of the great and legendary, that sort of thing. Me I know just enough to know I'm a long way from the bright center of that universe. Which good because they expect you to be useful. There are hard working people out there. I just pass on their labor to you in these torrents.

Oh and I've started uploading to zcult on my own, since the un-blue man has plenty to do I'm sure. Thanks DSD for once again being so helpful.
