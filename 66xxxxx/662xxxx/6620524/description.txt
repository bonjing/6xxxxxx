You're no idiot, of course. You know that monsters don't really live in your closet, the dark can't hurt you, and, statistically speaking, that flying is safer than the freeway you use every day. But when it comes to facing your own fears and anxieties, you feel like climbing on a chair and screaming you lungs out. Don't run screaming just yet! The Complete Idiot's Guide to Conquering Fear and Anxiety gives the strategies, tactics, and weapons you need to slay those inner demons, so you can go on and live you life.
