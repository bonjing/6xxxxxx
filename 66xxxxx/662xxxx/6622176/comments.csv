,arthelia,2012-06-08T06:50Z,"i'm dling this atm but i was wondering if there's a working PSP emulator around yet, i've been thinking about buying a psp and buying this game cause i wouldn't mind supporting square enix, but it would be better for the time being for me to pirate it till i get some money : /"

You could try JPCSP , this game is playable in it."
