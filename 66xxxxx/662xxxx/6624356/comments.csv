I've had plenty of good stuff from this site, but I've also had some junk too! The trusted/vip stuff can usually be relied on - but the stuff on the private tracker is always there and because there is an incentive to keep seeding and maintain a ratio every torrent downloads really fast. This site has a totally different purpose and has really helped shape the world of file sharing and is great at what it does.

I'm downloading and there aren't many seeders right now - either because the torrent is new or because there is something wrong with the file and people are deleting without warnings others. I'll persist until the download completes and then will leave another comment (hopefully in the next 30 mins). I'll let you know whether this really is the episode and it's good quality (and, I'll seed if that's the case) or whether it was junk and I deleted it. I find that sort of info useful - others have completed the download so wish they had commented."
,Julznova,2011-08-23T13:40Z,Its Real! go go go download!
,PhilT81,2011-08-23T13:52Z,"This is the correct episode.
The audio/video are good.
There are no problems/malware.
I will keep seeding."

,Johnny24071982,2011-08-23T14:12Z,Thx for letting us know. I've been waiting for this episode.l
,rogersarevok,2011-08-23T23:36Z,"eps 10 and 11 are legit, last night was a 2 hour special"
,hootieman,2011-08-24T01:05Z,"really if you all can wait 24 hours, Hulu broadcasts Hells Kitchen for free the day after so you can download something else"
,useitright,2011-08-24T01:37Z,This is what it says it is.  Audio and Video are great.  
,huldu,2011-08-24T04:23Z,"hootiman... wow, you're here too spreading hulu praise? Yeah, i bet it's great if you live in America. You see, they don't let you watch shit on Hulu, if you're not. Fail design."
,IseeingI2I,2011-08-24T05:22Z,hootieman two things 1. as mentioned before hulu is american only and 2. why wait an extra day with ads when this is just as free and a day sooner once hulu catches up with tpb sure ill give it a shot but until then get blown
,PhilT81,2011-08-24T19:09Z,The reason I download this is because I don't live in America so can't watch it on TV - and I bet that the case for many people who download it - so advertising a service so that people in America can watch it seems pretty pointless. It's a bit like coming on here and telling people if they get a TV they won't have to download it.
,Misaow,2011-08-25T03:54Z,"Hell's Kitchen is now on Hulu plus, so unless you want to pay, you have to wait 8 days to view it for free."
