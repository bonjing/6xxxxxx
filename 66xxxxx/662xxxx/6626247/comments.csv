My real issue is that I am downloading as many cartoons as I can for my nephew. Besides that he is only 9 years old, but the laptop he has is a hand-me-down and .h264 Hi-Def files bring the frame rate to just a mess of un-watchible artifacts as his laptop struggles to keep in-time. At this point I have to re-configure all these files to XviD/.avi files so he can use them. I doubt anyone would even care if you began uploading 11 min long cartoons using Video-Xvid/Audio of mp3 in a .AVI or .mp4 container. Just thought I'd mention this. the quality is of coarse. Its like putting 110 octane racing feul in a used 1993 Honda Civic. The gas is the highest quality, but can a 20+ year old car take advantage of that ""AWESOME"" feul. . . I don't think so. your 720/h.264 with AC3 audio is the 110 octane feul, a 2001 era laptop is the early 90's era honda. . . does any one else see this point and or feel it makes any since to back off on the super HIGH RES video. It not like your uploading an IMAX film or AVATAR or something like that. Thanks none the less. The quality is of coarse great."
