One of the great masters of post nouvelle vague generation, Philippe Garrel, in one of his more acurate films of his narrative period. Again the failure of 68 utopia,  the crisis of the modern couple, the parenthood, and the solitude are in the heart of fiction. Again his wonderful images in black and white, the laconism, and the dry romanticism of his urban poet.
