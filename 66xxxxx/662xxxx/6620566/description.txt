Yummy FTP is an FTP and SFTP client application for the Apple Macintosh, built as native Mac OS X software from the ground up, with the goal of providing a reliable, powerful, yet easy to use file transfer utility.

Since itâ€™s release, Yummy FTP has gained a reputation for being the fastest, most reliable, and most flexible FTP client available. Hereâ€™s why:

Reliability: The unique connection manager monitors for busy servers or dropped/stalled connections and will re-connect and resume transfers from where they left off. Firewalls are traversed with ease, due to the automatic FTP mode detection system. Misbehaving servers are pandered to in order to get the job done. Other apps simply display an error message.

Flexibility: Yummy FTP takes all the best standard features available in other solutions, makes them better, then adds a bunch of its own uniquely powerful features, resulting in a highly focused and productive feature set. You wonâ€™t find any bloat here. Itâ€™s also compatible with a wide range of servers from the FTP server built into Mac OS X, to Windows, Unix, and even XBox and Dec VMS servers, which fits nicely with its ability to customize settings on a per-server basis.

Itâ€™s Fast: And itâ€™s efficient too, using minimal CPU resources at all times. To demonstrate, we tested Yummy FTP against three major competitors: Fetch, Transmit and Interarchy.
