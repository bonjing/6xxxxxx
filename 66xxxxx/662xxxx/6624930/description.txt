Small Arms Ammunition Archive (diagrams & info) by Merc408

Welcome to Merc408's collection of ammunition diagrams and information!

The information contained within has been gathered from several international organizations whose purpose is to either archive or monitor the physical dimensions and/or properties of a large variety of small arms ammunition cartridges from around the world. Sources include NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), SAAMI (Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute, Inc.), the C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes Ã  Feu Portatives, or in English, the Permanent International Commission for Firearms Testing), and more.

I have collected the diagrams and information of 455 different cartridges of small arms ammunition, from pistols and revolvers, to large-caliber rifles and rimfires, and even shotguns, as well as several articles by each organization pertaining to the same realm of science and education. Each detailed diagram of a cartridge provides every single dimension to 0.01mm and is accompanied by a second diagram showing other physical dimensions/properties like minimums and maximums for production and use, as well as statistics like maximum average pressure within the cartridge and kinetic energy produced upon firing, and more. The diagrams and other information are all displayed in easy-to-navigate PDFs, organized into different folders so everything is easy to find, and a high zoom level can be achieved on almost all diagrams, allowing for maximum clarity.

I have created a text file for both the C.I.P. and SAAMI folders, listing every cartridge in that folder by category so you can easily find whatever you're looking for as quickly as possible. Also, in the main folder of my archive is a text file listing every single cartridge in my entire collection, all 455, so you can see whether or not the information you want exists somewhere in here (and I'm pretty sure it does  :)  ).

So enjoy the awesome magnitude of information in Merc408's database, and don't forget to seed so nobody gets left out!

Here is the full list of all 455 cartridges contained in the archive:
