,Ryanizgod,2011-08-24T00:38Z,"it the same copy as everyone else just edit the start to skip the bit with the big head !!!!

,Torrential.Reign,2011-09-07T18:50Z,"Logged on just to thank whoever bootlegged this one – top quality stuff for a CAM / TS copy;  like someone said, some scenes feels like you're watching a dvd;  honestly, i will not be upgrading to a dvd copy until the sequel is out on dvd also – it's that good;  extremely watchable on a 106 - 116cm TV, even 1.5M close.  Xlent work, wish they could be of this calabre.

,Torrential.Reign,2011-09-07T18:59Z,"Oh yeah, movie's pretty decent too, a go0d prequel to the classic story.
Thanx to all behind the scenes ppl who make it possible & 2 all who seeded (well seeded - i've struggled to get to my usual 3:1 seed ratio!).
