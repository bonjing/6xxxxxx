Thanks for the upload, it's certainly not worth subscribing. At least I can FF past the boring shit.

@triple_fault No...I hadn't noticed. Jim Norton is funny!"
,P.O.S,2011-08-24T22:14Z,THANKS FOR THE UP.........@triple_fault You suck monster cock! I dont know how you can listen to this show and not like Norton why would you listen? they dont have him on alot..... HE IS PART OF THE SHOW NOT A GUEST!!!Dont subscribe dont download dont listen YOU SUCK!!!!
,webdoc58,2011-08-25T00:27Z,I don't think Norton is the problem.  Seems to me the show's energy is spotty these days.  I remember a lot of times when I would have to pull over while driving and listening to the show b/c I couldn't stop laughing.  These days... not so much.  When you're the workhorse of satellite radio guess it's sometimes hard to keep the energy up.  Still better than anything out there right now.  Just my 2 cents...
