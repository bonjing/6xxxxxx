,Heyntjes123,2011-08-30T23:52Z,"Hey, 

thanks for the solution. It made the program run a little faster.

Do you perhaps have a decent version of the games Heart Gold & Soul Silver?

I already have Black and White and these games work perfect on the emulator"
[T],PirateBoy,2011-08-31T04:01Z,"@Heyntjes123

I will upload Pokemon Platinum, Black and White. I also have a version of both Heartgold and Soulsilver but they are likely to crash at some stage or the other. So its better not to share them with you all. If I find a decent version of Heartgold and Soulsilver, I will definitely upload them. Getting a decent version(without crashes and freezes) of Heartgold or Soulsilver is tough."
,stranger1324,2011-10-07T00:03Z,hey like it and i just start it. but how do i save my game ????
[T],PirateBoy,2011-10-07T15:08Z,"@ stranger1324

Go to File -> Save State As...

Save the game there under any file name you want. The extension of the file will be something like Filename.dst if the filename you typed is 'Filename'.

Load the saved file by going to ""Load State As.."" option.

Enjoy... :)"

.................................................................

cus need it to complete game and dont wanna use cheats to get the game 

like GENGAR or ALAKAZAM cant get them unless i trade"
[T],PirateBoy,2011-10-19T17:59Z,"Trading using GTS system: http://www.gamefaqs.com/ds/925601-pokemon-diamond-version/answers?qid=253711

Trading isn't possible on a emulator, but if you mean on the actual DS then just need 2 DS's and both games and go to pokemon centre and trade whatever pokemon you want. You can't link with DeSmuMe. The only option to obtain the Pokemon you want is to edit your save with Pokesav, google for it to find the webpage. 
Don't use cheats...i recommend it....but if you really wanna finish the game in emulator(PC)...use PokeSav Cheat...

If you want....I will upload PokeSav.

Regards....seed n enjoy... :)"
,bhaz09,2011-11-01T05:37Z,How do you speed up the system?
[T],PirateBoy,2011-11-13T12:51Z,"@ bhaz09

u have to increase the frameskip rate in ""config"" option...u can also try the limit frameskip and auto frmeskip options....and see what's the effect on your emulator speed....hope it helps.... :)

seed n enjoy... :)
