DAMN IT VISUALHUB, COME BACK PLEASE!!! "
,classy35,2011-08-24T13:28Z,Filmredux and VisualMonkey are forks.  Check it out.
,MikeXRyan,2011-08-24T14:33Z,This updated version WILL stitch files together - no error message.  This version of Visual Hub has been updated specifically for Lion.
,MikeXRyan,2011-08-24T14:41Z,"This updated version WILL convert from FLV, WMV and MPG to AVI with no problem.  This version of Visual Hub has been updated specifically for Lion."
,941640278,2011-08-24T14:54Z,Yeah Baby!  This updated 1.34 version works great!  I tested the combining option and converted several files and they all worked.  It seems faster to me and the quality is really good.  Thanks Mike!

,pryingeyes,2011-08-24T18:07Z,"Just to be clear, this is an update that revises the software so that it will function under Lion, but it has absolutely no upgrades to the functionality of core software -- in that sense, it is still circa 2008, and the developer has dropped it. If you liked it in 2008, then sure, go ahead with this. But in the last three years, lots of other video editing software has come along.

Here's the explanation from the guy who released this update:

""These one-step updaters will fix a show-stopper registration bug preventing proper operation in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion. They do not add new features, and are available as-is for those still using VisualHub and AudialHub.

""It's been nearly three years since Techspansion closed and these programs were last maintained.
VisualHub and AudialHub are no longer supported. And they won't last forever.
Whatever breaks from here on out will be the end, sadly. I hope this update squeezes a little more life out of these two apps for you."""
,941640278,2011-08-24T19:38Z,"Yes, I believe this is an update to the original 2008 release - an update to return all functionality that was previously lost under Lion.  I've been putting it through its paces and it does render (convert) faster and results in a high quality video.  I too use a great many video converters and picked up the patch recently released by the author but this package fixes the problems left by the patch.  Visual Hub has been a staple for me and of all the media converters available for the Mac user, is and remains the easiest, fastest and best in my opinion in all format areas.  I do a lot of conversion over to the iPad and iPhone as well as flv to avi and VH is my best and easiest choice."
,Dakota85,2011-08-25T17:22Z,"Awesome Cheers :) but I have to admit I miss the ""usual"" torrents lol :P can't wait til the next ones lol."
,pssyluvr,2011-10-14T14:06Z,I can' get it to convert M4v to Mp4 anymore.
