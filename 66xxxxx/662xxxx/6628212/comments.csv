,TyMod,2011-08-26T22:27Z,It sounds good man.  Sounds better then the original leak.  So why complain if it sounds better.  I already explained this before though.  If it truely sounded like shit I would understand why you would post a comment but it sounds better than the original leak so who the hell cares if its' upconverted.  HE never said it wasn't so I don't think he was trying to hide it or anything anyways.
