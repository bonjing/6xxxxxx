"This is full of ideas for studio artists and advanced hobbyists and should inspire them to see boxes and other containers as works of art, not just as functional objects."  â€”Library Journal


"Beautifully illustrated, this volume serves as a catalogue and companion to the Boxes and Their Makers exhibition, which opened in the fall of 2009 at the Messler Gallery of the Center for Furniture Craftsmanship in Rockport, Maine."  â€”Book News


"In fact, most of the boxes in this book are on the fanciful/artistic side of things, as opposed to the practical/craftsman side. But these artsy boxes are introductions to other stunning works, such as Hosaluk's Yellow Cactus Chair and Scribble, a maple bowl decorated with acrylic paint."  â€”Canadian Home Workshop


"Very thoughtfully done. Author and furniture historian Oscar P. Fitzgerald devotes a half dozen pages or so to each artist, offering a thorough and lively discussion of their backgrounds, inspirations and techniques. Each is illustrated with beautifully lit and detailed photos of the artist's work."  â€”Fine Woodworking.com
