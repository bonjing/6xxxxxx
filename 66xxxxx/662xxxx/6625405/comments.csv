,Denny9,2011-08-25T16:24Z,"Thanks ever so much. This posting is awesome but alas I've already read all of them. However, I'd really appreciate it if you could upload some or all of Cornwell's other books. Here's a list of the ones I've yet to read :
Stonehenge, Wildtrack, Sea Lord, Crackdown, Scoundrel, or The Starbuck Chronicles (Rebel, Copperhead, Battle Flag, The Bloody Ground).

Even if you can't, on behalf of all Cornwell fans, thanks."
