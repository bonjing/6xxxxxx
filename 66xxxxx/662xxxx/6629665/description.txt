Lemonade Joe is another great find from the immensely entertaining Czech New Wave. Director Lipsky threw singing cowboy films, Dudley Doright, and Marx (Karl, that is) in a blender, hit pulp, and poured out a delicious candy-colored malt that is far from perfect, but certainly a sight to see. This is definitely one for the â€œI have never seen anything quite like that beforeâ€ category.

Karel Fiala stars as the titular hero, Kolaloka lemonade advocate and the straight-shootinâ€™est cowboy around. The action is set in a fictional Arizona, where Doug Badman, owner of the Trigger Whisky saloon, controls a small town, and entertains himself by sponsoring saloon girl musical numbers and what may be the longest craziest bar brawl of all time. When Badmanâ€™s glass-eating thug menaces temperance crusader Ezra Goodman, and his luscious daughter Winnifred, Lemonade Joe shows up to save the day in his own inimitable style. Joeâ€™s arrival sets off a moderately vicious battle for the minds (and wallets) of the townâ€™s residents between Goodmanâ€™s newly founded Kolaloka outlet, and Badmanâ€™s depraved whisky den. Events are complicated by the arrival of Doug Badmanâ€™s even worse brother Horace Badman, and by Tornado Lou, the local torch singer, who has been waiting for a champion like Joe and does not want competition from the demure Winnifred.
