Thanks to extremezone for the upload!

This file might also avoid the ""blocking the internet"" in it's entirety. It worked for me."
[T],wowcabbage,2011-08-23T23:54Z,Thanks. Now i dont have to turn my router off every time!

,darepuke,2011-08-24T17:09Z,ok solve a problem you can not play the old save game with new KalypsoLauncher.dll only the new beginning campaign works tnx!!!!!!
,Jesuskipz,2011-08-24T18:58Z,dk if I would still be able to get updates :/
,LadyAshura,2011-08-24T19:43Z,"Just like with any cracked game, if you want updates, always backup your original files. When there is an update, restore the original KalypsoLauncher.dll and then update the game like normal. Replace the ""offline launcher"" version of the KalypsoLauncher.dll and play the game!

However, I am not sure if this offline launcher is still going to work with an update. "
,Jesuskipz,2011-08-24T21:17Z,If that does work I need a copy of the original file... I for got to back it up encase of anything.
,LadyAshura,2011-08-24T22:23Z,"The original KalypsoLauncher.dll can be found in the ISO under ""Setup"" Folder (or CD if you burned it). You can copy it from there and just paste it. "
,zamotakool,2011-08-26T14:26Z,"@wowcabbage
turn your router off?. You could just open Network and sharing centre-> change adapter settings -> right-click on Local Area Network -> disable it. Then re-enable it again when done. A faster way is to use the quicklaunch icon (small monitor icon beside the clock).
Or like me, use kaspersky firewall to block Tropico4.exe. Windows firewall just doesn't work, and btw alot more confusing @@."
,LadyAshura,2011-08-27T15:31Z,"@zamotakool

With the offline launcher, you don't have to block it from the internet. This prevents all of that (at least no one has told me otherwise). I don't have to block it on mine after putting this file in. 

RAR File Contents (since I can't edit):

-flt-trp4.exe (keygen)
-ReadME.txt file (instructions)
-KalypsoLauncher.dll (to replace original)

No more blocking it from the internet. No asking for login. Works 100% (as no one has complained otherwise).

Cheers!

,Guil07,2011-09-03T13:23Z,Torrent never begins. Unusual. Is it just me?
,iambeefcake,2011-09-04T19:20Z,Tropico 4 never even loads -_-
,LadyAshura,2011-09-05T04:58Z,"@ DrPiso

There is no appdata.dll file in my rar. That has to do with the game you downloaded. Try reinstalling the game. I have only tested this crack to work with the Fairlight release of Tropico 4 v 1.0  from the TPB here.

thepiratebay.org/torrent/6617702/Tropico_4-FLT

@ iambeefcake

Same goes for you. I recommend resintalling the game. Only tested this on the release at the link above. Also make sure you meet the minimum system requirements, make sure all drivers are updated. Check to see if any programs in the background are interfering with the game loading. I recommend turning off any antivirus software just to be on the safe side.

Windows Defender doesn't need to be turned off as I run my game with it on and it gives me no trouble at all. "

,Warjo,2011-09-10T13:13Z,Works like a charm. TY!
,robcasse,2011-09-17T17:50Z,Did anyone managed to install patch 1.03 ?
,LadyAshura,2011-09-17T19:51Z,"@ jacks538


You did not follow the instructions. After installing the game, do NOT start it. Follow the instructions listed here after downloading the offline launcher. USE the keygen. It works. If the games asks if you want to patch, I wouldn't recommend it because I am not sure the offline launcher will work. Just follow the instructions. Don't skip any steps, and the game should work fine. 

@ robcasse

I wasn't aware that there was a patch for this game. However, if there is, I am not sure if the offline launcher will still work. All I can say is tread carefully. Reinstalling is a huge bummer. "
,LadyAshura,2011-09-17T19:53Z,"@ Guil07

If you ever get that problem (the torrent never loads or start) remove the torrent and try again. I get the same issue sometimes. At least it's only a problem when starting. No big deal to go back and re-download / reload the torrent file so the download can begin. "
,Gloomfrost,2011-09-17T20:58Z,"The patch doesn't change THAT many things. Don't even worry about patching it until patch 1.1x, there will probably be a different offline .dll by then anyway. Worst case scenario, you can always go back to using the firewall/router to block it :P"
,HMCPB,2011-09-20T13:33Z,"Hi. I have FLT version installed. No problems, but it never asks for Key. And I cannot see mouse cursor. Uninstalled several times, including a regedit session. Nothing left of Kalypso or Tropico. Now tried this one, cuz I thought it might have to do with it ever having gone online. But nothing. 
Game runs, but no mouse pointer, and I never get asked for a serial either. HELP!"
,HMCPB,2011-09-20T17:54Z,Was just a lame ass Win7 Mouse setting. The trail thingy. Solved and runs perfectly
