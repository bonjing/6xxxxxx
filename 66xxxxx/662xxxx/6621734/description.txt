Ireland v France.
John Inverdale presents live coverage from the Aviva Stadium as Ireland host France, with both countries looking to hone their World Cup preparations. In 2007 the northern hemisphere duo were drawn together in the same World Cup pool, with host-nation France winning the must-win Group D encounter 25-3, a result that ultimately ended Ireland's hopes of reaching the quarter-finals. It's France's second trip to Dublin in 2011, having narrowly beaten Declan Kidney's men 25-22 in the Six Nations competition in February. Morgan Parra was the French hero on the day as his five penalties helped secure the win off the back of some poor Irish discipline. 
Commentary comes from Andrew Cotter and Phillip Matthews.
