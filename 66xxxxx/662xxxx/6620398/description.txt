The International is a 2009 thriller film directed by Tom Tykwer. The film follows an Interpol agent (Clive Owen) and an American attorney (Naomi Watts) who investigate corruption within the IBBC, a fictional merchant bank based in Luxembourg. It serves organized crime and corrupt governments as a banker and as an arms broker. The bank's ruthless managers assassinate potential threats, including their own employees.

Modelled after the Bank of Credit and Commerce International banking scandal, the film's script, written by Eric Singer, was inspired by banking scandals in the 1980s and concerns about how global finance affects politics across the world. Production began in Berlin in September 2007, including the construction of a life size replica of the Guggenheim museum in New York for the film's climactic shoot-out scene. The film opened the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival on 5 February 2009. Reviews were mixed: some praised the sleek appearance and prescient themes, The Guardian called it a thriller with "brainpower as well as firepower" but The New Yorker criticised the characterisation saying the two protagonists were not believable humans.
