You need to uncompress the files and when you write the disk, make sure you use the DVD video format and make sure the files you get are written into the folder VIDEO_TS - if you are doing it correctly, there will be an AUDIO_TS folder there as well, it will be empty - that's ok.

Hope this helps."
