Orville Johnson's unique approach to the resophonic guitar is on display thruout this all instrumental tour-de-force. John Miller says in his liner notes "...Orville holds the sound of the human voice as a star, guiding his musical expression." It truly is as if he is singing through his guitar as it careens along into many styles and grooves but always retains the individuality of his own voice. A must have album certainly for any dobro enthusiasts and anyone who appreciates the sinuous sound of slide guitar.
