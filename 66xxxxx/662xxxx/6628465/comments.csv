,ArtieT,2011-08-26T12:11Z,"I don't know what's worse - Hollywood's current era of creatively-bankrupt remakes/reboots, or the people they're made for - those who refuse to watch the 'old' originals (let alone b&w films!). Many writers actually refuse to do remakes of classics out of respect, and because they have those things called principles (remember them?!), which means they constantly strive for originality.

 It may well be funnier/more topical/thrillin' than the original for today's audiences, but in principle that's not that hard to do, because 90% of the work has already been done for them, hasn't it?! 

Hollywood wants a 90% guaranteed hit, like TV before it, and this is the result, even at the risk of cultural stagnation. As one bright spark asked, why don't they work instead on the failed/cancelled films - they need it! 

Thanks as ever for the upload, great work!"
