
THE POWER OF SIX by PITTACUS LORE


Iâ€™ve seen him on the news. Followed the stories about what happened in Ohio. John 

Smith, out there, on the run. To the world, heâ€™s a mystery. But to me . . . heâ€™s 

one of us.

Nine of us came here, but sometimes I wonder if time has changed usâ€”if we all still 

believe in our mission. How can I know? There are six of us left. Weâ€™re hiding, 

blending in, avoiding contact with one another . . . but our Legacies are 

developing, and soon weâ€™ll be equipped to fight. Is John Number Four, and is his 

appearance the sign Iâ€™ve been waiting for? And what about Number Five and Six? 

Could one of them be the raven-haired girl with the stormy eyes from my dreams? The 

girl with powers that are beyond anything I could ever imagine? The girl who may be 

strong enough to bring the six of us together?

They caught Number One in Malaysia.

Number Two in England.

And Number Three in Kenya.

They tried to catch Number Four in Ohioâ€”and failed.

I am Number Seven. One of six still alive.

And Iâ€™m ready to fight

â€œI can feel it in my bones that he is one of us. And I know somehow, that I must find him.â€
