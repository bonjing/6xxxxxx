,kraut58,2011-08-22T22:32Z,"If your going to upload movies please don't upload under the once and famous name of aXXo, the GREATEST uploader of all times!"
[T],artpepper,2011-08-23T03:01Z,"@kraut58, spare us your fake, blowhard outrage, OK?

 .Bone is one of the best respected uploaders of films on TPB and if he says that this is an aXXo release, then that's what it is. 

You'll notice the date of the film. It's a re-upload of an original aXXo release. 

Was it really so hard to work that out before you started flapping your fucking gums, you worthless asshole? 

I notice you've never uploaded anything yourself. Big surprise. Why is it that the ones who bitch and moan over nothing are always the biggest parasites?

Instead of whining like a little fucking girl , why don't you upload something  yourself and show us you're not a complete useless wanker? "

[T],artpepper,2011-08-23T04:03Z,"Good advice @Kissleevolve. Usually I ignore the assholes but sometimes, I let my irritation get the better of me...my bad."

,PiercedPleasure,2011-09-03T05:34Z,"Although recorded as a colloquial term for Germans by the mid-nineteenth century, it was during World War I that Kraut came to be used in English as a derogatory term for a German. In World War II it was used mainly by American soldiers and less so by British soldiers, who preferred the terms Jerry or Fritz. The stereotype of the sauerkraut-eating German dates back long before this time, and can be seen, for example, in Jules Verne's depiction of the evil German industrialist Schultz, an avid sauerkraut eater, in The Begum's Millions.
..............hahahahaah says it all pals !!"
