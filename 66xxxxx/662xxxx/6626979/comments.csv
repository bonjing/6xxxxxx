,Salazar1234,2011-09-07T23:49Z,"now DL cheers, could you do the other 3 in 1080p aswel, much appreciated."
,danwguy,2011-10-15T03:16Z,"bad encode, I am so sick of these coming out. Works fine on  computer, but you can't make a bluray dvd out of it or watch it on a ps3 or bluray player because it has an improper NALU size. If you don't know how to encode with mkv properly DON'T DO IT!!! waste time downloading this just to spend 14 hours fixing it"
,fuctup.rm,2011-10-18T17:13Z,"Some really, really dumb comments here. Please don't let them dissuade you - this is a good encode."
,amitjajoo,2011-12-03T16:29Z,"sorry but how do I convert this into a normal DVD ?
