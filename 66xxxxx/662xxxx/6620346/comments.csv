Thank you very much to all the people that have put them out so far, but there is no high quality proper release out yet, believe me, I've trawled through them all. What we need is:

- extended versions (movies approx 3 hours rather than approx 2h30m)

- bluray 720p or, even better 1080p (not DVD rip!)

- original Swedish language, *with optional English subs*


The boxset has been out for months so I'm surprised no-one has released them yet from the US Blurays.

If anyone knows where to download these, please let me know! Thank you very much!"
