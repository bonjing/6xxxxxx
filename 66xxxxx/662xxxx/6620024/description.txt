Here\'s the debut EP from Retox.  It is available to stream from their website (http://www.retoxrules.com).  It\'s 8 tracks in 7 minutes, and it\'s the musical equivalent of getting beaten and left for dead.  Each song is an assault on the senses.  I hate all the \'-core\' subgenre tags (speedcore, spazzcore, mathcore, etc.) so I\'ll just say if you like your music confrontational, you\'ll love this.  I\'ll also say that it\'s fast as hell.

   1. Ready To Spit
   2. I Rub The Wrong Way
   3. We hang By Our Eyelids
   4. Unpleasant Food
   5. Rusty Sheriffâ€™s Badge
   6. Go Ahead And Rescue
   7. Put Some Hair On It
   8. Piss Elegant

And I know it\'s a given by now, but I still feel the need to say it:  Please support the band if you appreciate this release.  Their debut full-length album, \"Ugly Animals\", drops on August 23rd via Three One G/Ipecac Recordings.  And it\'s even more brutal than this.

Thanks for the download!
