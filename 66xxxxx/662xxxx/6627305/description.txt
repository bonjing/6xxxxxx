* What is DXVA?
 DXVA, or DirectX Video Accelleration, is a system built into Windows operating systems 
 since Windows XP that allows programs, if they support it, to offload the decoding of 
 certain media codecs to the GPU. Doing so reduces the strain on the CPU and allows for 
 even High Definition content to be played on a relatively weak system.
