This is Ross Martin's first TV series, where he played Andamo -- 
a friend and business partner of a man who goes by the name Mr. Lucky.

In the premiere episode they're running from South American revolutionaries, 
and by the next episode Mr. Lucky wins a floating gambling casino in L.A.!

This stylish half-hour B & W series was based on a Cary Grant movie
from the 1940s. The TV show was better, but it only lasted the 1959 to 1960 season. Created by Blake Edwards, who was also still producing "Peter Gunn" 
at the time, Edwards again wisely hired Henry Mancini to compose the music.

Mr. Lucky was played by lesser-known actor John Vivyan.

Although these episode files are titled, there are no titles on film
so instead I'll just list the guest stars I'm familiar with in each episode.

1. Nehemiah Persoff and Ziva Rodann

2. Pippa Scott, Norman Alden, Madge Blake, and Conrad Nagel.
