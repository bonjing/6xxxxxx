,nightlite,2011-08-28T10:27Z,Epic fail indeed.
,buservt,2011-09-07T18:09Z,If you guys are too fucking stupid to download the free version of winrar to unpack the paid one then you should just kill yourself. Show some freaking gratitude for Christ's sake.

Morons, how many are they...?"
,chas66,2011-09-15T10:28Z,"Right on buservt, could not agree more :)

So sad that some people have never thought of Google or even just politely asking the poster for help to save themselve from being shown up as abusive fools!"
