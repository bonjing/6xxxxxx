
TAKIS KARNAVAS

A large section of Greek folk music (Dimotiko) is undoubtedly the great Takis Karnavas (1936-1999).
Born in Kandyla Xiromeroy, Aitoloakarnania.
His professional career began at the age of 15 and quickly became known and sung at festivals in Agrinio, Preveza, Arta and Ioannina.
in 60s worked with Vasilis Soukas, who brought him to Athens where he worked in all major centers of folk song.

His career took off with appearances all over Greece and concerts abroad e.g. New York of which abstracts are on Utube, dozens of albums and collaborations with other greats of folk song as Constantinou, Vera, Hristias, Kollitiri, Saleas, Soukas and too many others, brought him to the top and made him perhaps the most important artist of Dimotiko, the Aitoloakarnanian Barba-Taki!
His discography is (fortunately) large, with hundreds of folk songs.
The Karnavas is a real legend for fans of folk song. With tremendous vocal abilities (incredible ingenuity, though he did great abuse) and high expressivity, broadcast a unique emotion, which made everyone to be in ecstasies, and resorting to extreme events admiration.
