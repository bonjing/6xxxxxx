"Let's Get Out of Here"

As all hell breaks loose in Shreveport, 
Sookie summons her most potent powers yet 
to save Bill, in the process breaking a 
spell and leading Marnie/Antonia to re-
evaluate her mission. Also, Jason urges 
Jessica to glamour him for Hoyt's sake, 
while Terry drags Andy to Fort Bellefleur 
for an intervention. Elsewhere, Alcide 
reconsiders his allegiances after Marcus 
fight with Tommy, while Jesus, 
accompanied by Sookie, Lafayette and 
Jason, tries to breach the Moon Goddess 
Emporium's defenses to liberate Tara and 
Holly. And finally, Bill leads a brigade 
of vampires committed to blowing the 
place to kingdom come.
