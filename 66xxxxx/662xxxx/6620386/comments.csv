,cutepopeyez,2011-08-22T17:33Z,"Uh...it's only been posted once, if you can count. And hypothetically speaking, if this was posted over and over, then why do you keep following and tracking it? Maybe because you know the book's true and don't want to admit it? Self-denial won't get you far in life!"

you've raised a couple of interesting points so I wrote an email to the author to get his side of the story. The author replied back to me and explained his reason for self-publication in that he simply wanted people to read his novel, not to make money, because as he says ""money really is the root of all evil"". Also the author points out how money is 1 of the root causes of why Asian culture is so messed up so selling his book for money would've been hypocritical. And per that same email, the author mentioned to me that his book is currently being translated for publication in a few Asian countries, with all proceeds going to local charities and not a penny going to him. Sounds like a noble endeavor to me. So this shows valid reasons as to why the author went with self-publication and also shows that publishers are willing to translate his book and put it in bookstores. 

This also shows that your post is just based on blind assumption and hate. I mean, you are certainly entitled to your opinion but if you hate this book so much, why do you keep following and tracking it, just like that other dude? That makes no sense. That's like saying you hate a certain band but you keep following that band by checking their concert dates and talking about their music! so wouldn't it make sense not to keep following this book if you hate it so much and think it's garbage? heehz 

so is it really because you're angry with the author because he speaks the truth about Asian culture OR is it because you don't want people to know the truth about asian culture OR is it because you're insecure? Regardless of which one you pick, it doesn't look good for you. It actually looks pretty sad to me. 

I personally love this book...and this is coming from an Asian person. But I guess there will always be haters in this world and  the haters have nothing to offer but hate..."
