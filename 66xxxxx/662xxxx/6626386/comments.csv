,mvp7001,2012-03-05T21:42Z,"I guess it worked, however, now my drive (160gb) only shows up as 8gb in windows.

Only 8gb available for copy/storage even though disk management shows fat32 & 160gb.

But right click in disk management & select properties, it shows 8gb total.

Still a bug in your ""fixed"" .exe

Thanks anyway.. Will keep looking."

And what's more, after converting the drive, it now shows that instead of 500GB capacity, it has 7.8GB.

Either fix the torrent, include clear instructions, or delete the entire fucking thing."
