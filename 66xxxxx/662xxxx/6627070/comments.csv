I am writing this to seek help in your upload of Lingoes. I have downloaded the heavy file, but the interface language of the software is Russian. Moreover, it also gives some kind of error message in Russian. 

Can you help me in this? I don't know Russian and just can't think a way out. 

The torrent has no comments or discussion to help me. How can I change the language of the interface? Any idea?"
