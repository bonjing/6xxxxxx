,Phatfish,2011-08-24T02:53Z,"I was a bit puzzled and though it was a fake at first but its just the wrong movie description..

THIS is a experimental movie/video installation by Brock Enright, running time 1h 09min on not the movie in the description.

Thanks anyway! 
'm actually gonna watch this one though, the hipster I am...lรถl"
