I know you don't probably do requests, but the one movie that seems to have slipped through the net is Thor (2011 - starring Chris Hemsworth), not the Asylum version. 

It's been out on DVD for months now and the only versions still knocking around are TS. It didn't help that three Thor movies (including anime), and several games with the same name appeared at the same time confusing people. If you can upload, much respect :)"
