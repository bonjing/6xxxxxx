We went shopping yesterday morning at a bankruptcy sale and were happy
to come back with the Time Life Series from the 50s we posted yesterday
(along with more brand new CDs stuff that's pending to post) - and we also
were thrilled to find at a nice discount this 2CD set of great stuff from 
Mr. Tom Jones including popular duet offerings too.

This is especially great for the folks back in Ireland, Germany Italy France
and Sweden, Holland as he is the best of men from every-such-where! 


All at 192k - enjoy!

(One bonus track at 128k - Ain't no sunshine - done supremely 
best by Mr. Tom Jones)

enjoy!
