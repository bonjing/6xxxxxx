[V],globeplus,2011-08-22T18:14Z,"HI ! The best possible quality was getted with the Dub plugins after the work on the original cam video file , the RMVB video type secures nice picture performance for close half size of the necessary stable bitrate , for example : an avi that needs 600 mb to have nice bitrate stability , with the RMVB for close 300 mb the user get the same stability of the picture compared to the 600 mb avi , after maded a few tests i really tought to have a shot to upload this movie file in RMVB video type , knowing also that somehow it is starting to be a kind of normal somewhere on the net the nice movies having RMVB files available for download and that it is respected because the stability of the picture for not too much size .

Always searching the best new ways to make uploads thinking on the best that the users can get with what it is available to work and this is the correct file sharing spirit ... 

Cheers and happy movie to all of you ..."
,lambofgodman,2011-08-22T18:47Z,Thanks globe. I love this movie saw it at theater this weekend.
,Nergalsyn,2011-08-22T19:34Z,"@globeplus
Thanks for all the hard work you and other uploaders do to get these torrents out to us - the general public. I appreciate your sharing."
,Davesoft,2011-08-23T02:56Z,"Don't bother try to download this, I don't know about the quality but when I clicked on it the download hit as much as 2 Mbps then just fell on it's face, stuck at 29% and no seeders! Yea, thanks up-loader! I'm in the same boat as anyone else, waiting on a better copy because the only copy I could find was summed up best by one of the comments... "" The blurry blob on the screen made a crashing sound so I decided to wait for a better copy and deleted it!"" LOL!  "
[V],globeplus,2011-08-23T06:54Z,"Not stucked anymore , circunstancial inconvenience , corrected now !  Keep going .

enjoy ...

,pinzmoo,2011-08-23T10:13Z,stuck @ 35%; so what green skulls are uploading bullshit files now?
[V],globeplus,2011-08-23T15:10Z,"To pinzmoo : please donÂ´t be so hard with me beside the fact that i understand your point of view , the utorrent for slow connection speeds with a real great number number of peers can have congestionments during the downloading , for example if 100 or more peers have 40% , the next block on the seed to be shared it is a kind of hard to be getted , the ideal is that the peers with more percentage get more disperse , for example : 10 with 39.5% then 10 with 39% and so on , for the normal share of the necessary blockshappen with more frequency , i analised for 2 or 3 times correcting settings this subject but no matter what after a while the peers keep going anyway , i know that it is not the ideal but still ok to keep going , from myself i still analising possibilities to help on the blocks frequence to the peers but it is always some things that it is tough to inderstand specially if the connection speed are not too much and if that not enough not giving what was the normal uploading speed for this kind of connection , my wish is that all of the peers get the file soon as possible and that will happen independtly of the necessary time to the download , i have for the meantime a slow connection and it is ok for not too much mega files but with the acumulation of lot of peers , the blocks started to be more tough to be shared on the sharing program , just life i guess but still thinking positive about getting the movie ...

Cheers , sorry for something but who gives the best possible to share nice files with the others deserve a excuse , right ? Ok , at least i think so ...
See all of you watching this movie in sooner time as possible . Thank you . "
,Davesoft,2011-08-23T17:11Z,"I got an idea globplus, not trying to be an ass here but why don't you seed your own upload? I've been downloading this since 3 pm or so yesterday and I am now at 45.9% and it's just sitting there starring at me now. At one point it was downloading at up to 2 Mbps and I was going to have it in less then 3 minuets but now it's infinitive. I'll continue to try to download but if this is any better then the other copy it needs to be seeded! Thanks for your efforts BTW..."
,royhere,2011-08-23T18:00Z,"How are U?

From: roystar  (old friend)"
[V],globeplus,2011-08-23T21:40Z,"To Davesoft : i am seeding all right , open your sharing program and go to the general information about the torrent and if the availaibility is higher than 1 it is because all blocks are available for the present file , the time necessary to get the download it is another story that depends too on the connections and possible help for the current torrent file , it is like that .
I have to confess that maybe because my slow net  connection wasnÂ´t prapared for certain acumulation of peers is the base of this circunstancial constrangiments and it is tough even for me this situation , for me all of you was already watching this movie file and i hope that happen soon as possible .

My friendly users , i already uploaded in the same circunstances other movies and it was sometime to  the users get the files but with better frequency i think then on this one , so rthe question is : why on this particular movie the file have more possibilities of randomly constrangiments ? because i think i have 2 or 3 times the number of peers getting the same blocks at the same time , on the orhers i has 20 , 30 maybe 40 at maximum peers connected getting the movie at the same time , on this one i am getting more than an 100 easily here and there , it is about the volume of peers but we all know something that it is inegable : once all of this users start getting this file , it will be a fantastic probably file for anyone to get but unfornatly with a suffer story on his born as a torrent movie file ...

Have a better downloading as possible all of you , from me expect a normal seeding with the hope of more users with file start joining me helping soon as possible too .

LetÂ´s go watch this movie ... "
[V],globeplus,2011-08-23T21:51Z,"To royhere : 

HI Roystar , my truly old friend , it is nice to see that you still around trying to find nice files , i know my friend that i am travelling in deep waters without too many oxygen , i mean uploading with a slow connection net and with that only small files can be worked because i canÂ´t put the downloaders days or weeks waiting just to get a couple of gigas file for example , i am passing tough times about this particular subject , but my heart my friend still having all the nice correct file sharing spirit that always was with me all of this years and i will still like that , one thing it is for shore : i will never let the users of my files going down or get frustrated with my work , maybe i need to recognize circunstancial difficulties but i am with them for the best and the worst having in mind that everyone that wants this file have the right to have 100% soon or later .

See you around and please still enjoying more nice files as possible as you can ... we have the computer and that it is for something for shore i guess ...  "
[V],blaze69,2011-08-24T00:19Z,"globe . Are U sure This Torrent Is Not Paused ?
Cuz I myself Is Downloading It and Everone In my Peer list Is Stuck @54.5 %"
[V],globeplus,2011-08-24T06:40Z,"To blaze69 : no problem , it will be ok and i´d like to thanks the new seeds that are giving a new healphy support improving the frequence of new blocks available , it is a matter of time now to everyone start getting the file .

Happy movie to all of you ."
[V],globeplus,2011-08-24T14:47Z,"Hi everyone !

This movie file is getting real close , around 99% to the peers with more percentage and iÂ´d like to suggest 2 possible players to play this video type :

- RMVB Player 1.0.1 , light and pratical to the RMVB video files

- RealPlayer 14.0.4.652 with more features than the RMVB Player and appropriate to for this type of video

Note : of course that the tradicional generalist players that everybody knows read well also this type of video but taking a look on the appropriate players probably not a bad idea too , even if it is for the curiosity to watch how this video type looks on this designated appropriated players 

enjoy and sorry for something about the download of the file , happy movie to all of you ."
[V],globeplus,2011-08-24T15:22Z,"RECOMMENDED after testing this movie :

RMVB Player 1.0 :

http://www.soft82.com/download/windows/rmvb-player/

TESTED and APPROVED .

Note : i don´t have any deal to sell this player and he is complete free and pratical , i am suggesting this player because the VLC nice generalist player showed a little lag here and there and this one more accurate and perfect with the picture , so i recommend to use this player , use the link above to get him or search on the net .

,ashikojim,2011-08-24T18:14Z,stuck at 99.9%!! PLZ SEED!!
,soccerkid5,2011-08-25T00:39Z,"Hi I'm sorry to bother you on something off topic but I figured you'd probably not respond on an old torrent , but for your football manager 2011 torrent , where is the editor date folder located for that game?"
[V],globeplus,2011-08-25T07:59Z,"To soccerkid5 : probably wasn´t included if you don´t find him because wasn´t working properly or something but not necessary if that it is the case to play the game , extract again and check but if not included it is something like that , i don´t remember well the file , was worked many time ago ."
,tester4u,2011-08-25T10:43Z,"Do not download this unless you are tooo greedy like me
no disrespects to the uploader but this is one of the worst uploads ever 

A - 1
V - just shapes :)"
[V],globeplus,2011-08-26T11:48Z,"To tester4u : i am shore that the file you tested wasn´t this one , this one works very nice for this kind of size in the RMVB player and any other subjacent comment about the picture that you don´t like was extracted from the used original cam that by the way was worked with the dub plugins improving colours and reducing particles on the picture background , so your test is a complete bullshit ...

Cheers and happy movie to all of you ."
,newid81,2011-10-17T08:36Z,"I didn't download this but I've downloaded Real Steel uploaded by this uploader and reading comments here I think its not wise to download the so compressed quality films, quality is severely compromised. No offence to the uploader"
