rookies on every board, is it some kind of joke? For fuck sake ask google before you post your stupid mother fucking cumment!

Has this worked for others?
Has anyone tried it on live?

Thanks"
,frerwin,2011-08-26T19:00Z,SEED PLEASE!
,Macsta,2011-08-27T01:40Z,asking me to update before I can play. If I update its gonna reset my firmware. So technically this isnt a working game!
,blamil,2011-08-27T01:54Z,"Works like a charm! To those complaining about the update, flash your drive back to original - install game and allow update, than flash lt+ 1.9 after update has completed. "
,masked741,2011-08-28T17:11Z,"Region Free?
Works on NTSC consoles?"
,masked741,2011-08-29T02:47Z,"ABGX confirmed: game works on NTSC/U and PAL consoles...
The game is not in the online ABGX database yet...
I will wait to confirm before burn it....
I donÂ´t know the wave, but I think probably will need Lt + 1.9 or 1.91"

,pvt.db,2011-09-01T10:02Z,anyone know when rugby challenge will be available? for pc?
,Jaysarray,2011-09-03T09:26Z,"To update, do we just press ""yes"" and let it happen, or will that affect a modded 360? Any likelihood of it freezing or bricking the 360?"
,blamil,2011-09-05T10:56Z,"@ jays...installing the update will re-flash your drive back to stock. You then risk possibly bricking (unlikely), but also can be flagged.. best to flash to stock, update via usb to .13146. software, than re-flash drive with newest lt + firmware.."
,ruhtra666,2011-09-08T20:14Z,"guys i've got a problem. I downloaded the game burned it and put in the xbox. When it asked me about the update i clicked yes. It started to install and the xbox rebooted. When it started again it showed me a message that the update can't be read from the cd and i should enter the cd again if i want to continue. I did that but it didnt work, i burned the dvd again but it didnt work, i downloaded the update from the xbox website, burned it twice but it didnt work. It may be sth simple but i dont know what to do. HELP"
