Also, I just discovered that McHale, Ensign Charles Parker, and Captian Binghamton were for real and the show was based in part on truth including Taratupa and their tour of duty in Italy. Check it out on the Seiber Islands Ministry of Defense web site. Seems the real McHale was still alive in 1999 at age 100. The real story is as great as the TV show."
