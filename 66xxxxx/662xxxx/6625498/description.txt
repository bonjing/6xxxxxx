Storyline: As a U.S. senator moves to pass new legislation that dramatically expands the surveillance powers of law enforcement agencies, Congressman Phil Hammersley (Jason Robards, uncredited) remains firmly opposed to its passage. To ensure the bill's passage, National Security Agency official Thomas Reynolds (Jon Voight) kills Hammersley, but he is unaware of a video camera set up in a duck blind by wildlife researcher Daniel Zavitz (Jason Lee) that has captured the entire incident. Zavitz discovers the murder, and alerts an underground journalist while preparing the video on computer cartridge. Reynolds learns of Zavitz's footage, and sends a team from the National Security Agency to recover the video by any means necessary. While on the run, Zavitz secretly passes the computer cartridge to his old college friend, labor lawyer Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith), moments before he is killed in a traffic accident.
