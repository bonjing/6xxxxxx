,euphoria4949,2011-09-02T08:33Z,"Well it took a few days to download it due to the size but it was well and truly worth it :) 
Absolutely amazing, perfect quality and a wicked movie.

Its just a shame that so many selfish bastard have downloaded it and then immediately stopped seeding! Which as a result it was only averaging 300KB/s when I was downloading it and most of the time there was only 2 seeds!!
I have already uploaded 61GB and I'll continue to seed for the next couple of weeks, I just hope other people do the same :-\

VIDEO = 10/10
AUDIO = 10/10
MOVIE = 9/10

Massive thanks to mkvonly, wicked job guys :)"
,mihalis83,2011-09-12T23:21Z,"Any recommended software to burn this to disc? 
Thanks for the upload."
,plutten78,2011-10-06T17:21Z,in which folder should I put the SRT subtitle when I play the movie in my media player?
