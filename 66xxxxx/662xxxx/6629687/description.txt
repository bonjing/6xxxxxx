As they say on their MySpace page...

\"We\'re orbiting a planet near Eta Carinae (look it up) right now and the view is beautiful, however we have to return on Monday because that\'s when we\'re mastering our new and improved Mini LP. It\'s been in the freezer so long we\'ve had the chance to put some more tracks on it. We also apologise for the long wait suffered, this was just down to internal workings at EMI. We plan to get this record out asap and then follow it as soon as we can with another. Release will be swift...we hope...and very much worth the wait.\"
