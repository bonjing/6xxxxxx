no you just spam us with your half dozen bots with the same shitty cams over and over, and no useful info"
,Juggernaut62468,2011-08-22T03:12Z,@namorax2  How about you either just fucking download it and watch it OR Just go and watch it in theatre. If your going to just bitch and moan then stfu. Show some respect to the guys who actually try and give something without anything in return.  
,mojica22,2011-08-22T03:26Z,a/v?
,namorax2,2011-08-22T04:16Z,"jugg anytime anyone complains about the shitty, shoddy, spamming bullshit these clowns put out an idiot like you comes along and says ""its free, you dont dare complain!"", fuck you and all your ilk. I'd rather these idiots didnt put anything on here, than the thousands of things they do that are shit...all they do is swipe other peoples work anyway. TPB a few years ago wouldnt stand for that kind of shit, now it seems to be all about getting clicks..."
,mojica22,2011-08-22T04:16Z,"will rate and seed when done
"
,dadotkd,2011-08-22T04:49Z,"A-8

Thanx TvTeam"
,mojica22,2011-08-22T06:22Z,ty dadotkd for rate. plz seed to max
,mojica22,2011-08-22T06:23Z,TvTeam great job as always
,Chazk,2011-08-22T06:31Z,"@ namorax2 why dont you nitwits ever rate your own A V quality...

Probably because whiny, greedy dipshits like you would just complain about how they're lying about their own ratings. How about not being a skinflint cry-baby and go pay for the theatre version instead of demanding you be given a high quality free version?"
,Alreadydead,2011-08-22T07:12Z,v7 a5 -Still decent quality but sound is quite hallow 
,simon200,2011-08-22T10:43Z,"Ungrateful sons of bitches 
If it's not up to your liking don't take
If you do like it take it
Under no circumstances are people (who have not contributed to tpb) entitled to an opinion, apart from THANK YOU VERY MUCH followed by a rating on A,V

Cheers for the up TvTeam"
,pinzmoo,2011-08-22T18:49Z,"a6 v4 almost unwatchable on some parts; again the person who recorded this noobed it by leaving autofocus on, none the less thanks for the up TvTeam."
,thefanfx,2011-08-22T19:26Z,"10x ,bad quality , but for free :)"
,LukeScooto,2011-08-23T06:04Z,"Namorex is right in part of what he says. The part i agree with is that XXLS put up the original, and still the ONLY original copy of this movie. Everyone else just stole it, and changed the title and put their name on it and reuploaded it for clicks and cred. If you want real cred, go cam your own version, or R5 or something original. I have no respect for anyone who isnt doing their own work, whatever it is. Changing a title isnt work, its lame. I have lots of respect for whoever cammed the original of this, even though its poor quality. The quality isnt as important to me as the fact of who did deserves the respect, not the 11 people after him that claim it to be theirs. 
Why should i be thankful to tvteam or scenebalance or any of these guys copying someone elses work? Just because they're upping it? Its already up by others, so im unlcear here why im so grateful? I mean lets be real, we all have $10 to spend to go to the movies, so thats not really the issue here. The issue for me is time, and I dont have it to go to every movie. I save it for the bigger transformer 3 type movies that i want to see inperson. Otherwise i rent, or watch here. Anyways, much respect to the original cammer, everyone else is a fucking douche and an even bigger douch for claiming original ownership by putting their name on it. Douchebags."
,jahnee,2011-08-23T17:33Z,"FORGIVE ME for saying... BUY A HD CAM OR GTFO, it's 2011 how the fuck can you still own such a crap cam, was this recorded in Mexico? SHIT I may as well start going back to theaters sick and tired. HD or GTFO! "
,latsprime,2011-08-24T00:47Z,"not a bad shot but just too blurry at times, good effort tho A- 6 V- 4"
,crniTHEman,2011-08-28T22:16Z,"v-2

,u03,2011-09-12T09:56Z,"For those girly-girls out there this CAM release won't do. I found it perfectly watchable for the most part, despite the blurrs. I agree with 
latsprime:

              not a bad shot but just too blurry at    times, good effort tho A- 6 V- 4
