OMNIA plays only pure PaganFolk and World Music on acoustic traditional instruments. This means: no computers, no artificial beats... what you see on stage is what you hear. But that doesn't mean we don't like to listen and dance to electronic dance-club music! And that's the "raison d'Ãªtre" for this release; a remix CD filled to the brim with OMNIA's shamanic Pagan sound warped by all sorts of groovy computer tricks, subsonic beats, freaky sample tracks... the works!

This is Omnia's "dance-remix" CD - was released June 2007.
