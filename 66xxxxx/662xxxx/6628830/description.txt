"The opening story in this anthology was the closest I have ever come to screaming with fright over something I've read... Absolutely terrifying." "This is a must-have for anyone who considers themselves to be a horror fan." "One hundred and thirteen horror stories in a 500 page slab of thick, chunky tome. Terrifically terrifying!" "Love horror? Get it. Now." "So much more than the usual suspects of recycled cliches. This anthology is genius at its most gruesome."
