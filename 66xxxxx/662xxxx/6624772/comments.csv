,Taishig,2011-08-24T08:18Z,"Thank you for actually sharing! Download went fast and all songs sound great :). 

However, you added two songs twice:

Songs of Storms
Lost Woods

If you could remove two of them and fix it, the torrent would be smaller and people wouldn't have unnecessary duplicates. Other than that: perfect!"
,Taishig,2011-08-24T08:20Z,"Oh, Gerudo Valley is also in there twice!"
,Zargon123456,2011-08-24T09:27Z,"Great Torrent! Aside from the duplicates, which increase size/time, it's awesome. I love the new song. "
,Oiche,2011-08-24T19:59Z,"Duplicates? That's quite odd, but I'll upload a new torrent without them. For some reason, ThePirateBay doesn't let me edit this current torrent, so I guess i'll make a new one."
,Oiche,2011-08-24T20:06Z,"That's odd, I'll make a new torrent and try to fix that problem. Honestly, the folder i uploaded into the torrent only had a single copy of every song, so I have  no idea how there are duplicates."
