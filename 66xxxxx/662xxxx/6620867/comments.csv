All the video clips play great in VLC player.
I haven't tried to burn them yet.

Since you're getting artifacts, that cause could be the blank DVD's, computer speed or memory problem or the DVD burning program you're using.

Try the videos in VLC player and you'll see how clear they are.

Good luck."

You're very welcome.
I'm glad I can help.

Magnum was always my favorite TV series."

All the Magnum torrents that I uploaded were from other torrent sites.
They played good on my computer, so I figured I'd put them up on Pirate Bay since there weren't any seeded ones.
No alterations were done on my part.

Hey, you can always buy the whole Magnum PI set....
But I'd rather get it free here, ;)"
,toormina2,2012-02-21T06:15Z,Have watched first 4 eps and the quality/sound is very good. I play the .avi's from an ext. HD thru a WD TV Live Media Player.  Thx for the uploads.
