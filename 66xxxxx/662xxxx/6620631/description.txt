The original band of Myles Kennedy, the now front man of the better known Alter Bridge, which is mostly the leftovers of Creed with Myles on Vocals. But, as always with my releases, 320, 500x500 art, properly tagged. I took me a while to find high quality uploads of these releases, especially the 2nd album which I encoded from FLAC, as well as the EP.

Studio Releases
1. Fallout
2. Second Skin

EP
3. Motion: Live*

*Note: Original quality is low, I encoded from a FLAC I found somewhere, it doesn't really warrant a 320 encode, but my encoder was already set to that.

As always, Enjoy, and please seed, as there are no 320's of this discog anywhere.
