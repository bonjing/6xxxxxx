.""Dude."" or anyone, does this Black Box Version of GTAIV & EFLC use the ""G.F.W.L."" saved game system, where as with a person who have a  legitimate  ""G.F.W.L."" account ,  could loss all gamed save progress in the event of a Hard Drive reformat an you had to re-install Windows an GTAIV & EFLC, because I noticed in the info you posted that this Black Box Version uses ""  Xliveless""?

,EDGE5000,2011-09-14T09:20Z,"First of all thanks for the upload and I'm a big fan of GTA IV. But I had a couple of questions regarding the installation. I get 9 different errors after the installation is complete. The first 8 errors I get are:

1.C:\Program Files\Black_Box\GTA IV + EFLC\1.avi
2.C:\Program Files\Black_Box\GTA IV + EFLC\2.avi
3.C:\Program Files\Black_Box\GTA IV + EFLC\bass.dll
4.C:\Program Files\Black_Box\GTA IV + EFLC\gg.ico
5.C:\Program Files\Black_Box\GTA IV + EFLC\un.ico
6.C:\Program Files\Black_Box\GTA IV + EFLC\wbb.ico
7.C:\Program Files\Black_Box\GTA IV + EFLC\EFLC.ico
8.C:\Program Files\Black_Box\GTA IV + EFLC\IV.ico

All followed by: ""An Error occurred while trying to read the source file: The device is not ready. Click Retry to try again, Ignore to skip this file (not recommended), or Abort to cancel installation.""

I hit the Retry button a couple of times and it does nothing. So I ignore it.

After the installation is complete, I try to run GTA IV and the 9th error message says: 
""GTA IV FATAL ERROR: D3D Error - Shader Model 3.0 or higher is required.""

Am I doing something wrong? I am using UltraISO. Thanks in advance!"
,SABERWOLF357,2011-09-14T19:42Z,"@EDGE5000 ""GTA IV FATAL ERROR: D3D Error - Shader Model 3.0 or higher is required."" 

That error sounds like it related to your Graphics Card being unable to run the game.

As far as the other errors, that sounds like it's related to you Virus Protection program not allowing those files to initialize, you might want to turn off your Anti-Virus Protection completely while installing this game.

Go Too Start Menu---> Type ""MSCONFIG"" in the search box.

When ""MSCONFIG"" opens go too the ""SERVICES TAB, Look for all releated properties to your AV program an untick the boxes an restart your PC an try to install the game.

When the game is dine installing go back to MSCONFIG an tick the boxes again an restart your PC :)"
,EDGE5000,2011-09-14T23:29Z,"@SABERWOLF357

Thanks for the tip on the anti-virus. That fixed the first 8 errors. Now the only problem I have is with the graphics card.

My graphics card specifications:

Name: Intel(R)G33/G31 Express Chipset Family
Manufacturer: Intel Corporation
Chip Type: Intel(R) GMA 3100
DAC Type: Internal
Approx. Total Memory: 256 MB
Running with DirectX 11

My system specifications are:

OS: Windows 7 Ultimate 32-Bit
Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo E7300 @ 2.66GHz (2CPUs),~2.7GHz
Memory: 4GB RAM

I wasn't sure if these specifications were enough to run GTA IV. Also my graphics card has OpenGL 3D settings to mess around with but I wasn't sure what to do. 

Thanks again! =)"

Click on the GTAIV game, the site will analyze your system to see if you can run the game, if you get a prompted by the site telling you that you do not meet the system requirements to play the game then there is nothing you can do except upgrade your GFX hardware."
,-R3ap3R-,2011-09-20T04:18Z,All i wanted was the first damn game the original.... but NOOO i have to install the whole damn thing which is taking 1hr10mins and still installing .... WHAT THE FUCK

,miketheratguy,2011-09-21T07:00Z,"While I assume that this would probably work trying to install from the mounted disc, I just went straight to the suggestion to install by copying into a folder and it worked perfectly.

1: Ensure that you have 35 GB free hard drive space (this is temporary)

2: Mount disc 1 using Dameon tools.

3: If you get a pop-up giving you the choice, explore the disc. If not, right-click and open / explore the disc in My Computer.

4: Create a folder anywhere on your computer.

5: Copy all files from the disc into that folder (should be about half a dozen or so files).

6: When that's done, mount the second disc just like you did with the first one, and explore it just like you did the first time.

7: Copy all the files from the second disc into the folder you made, again it will be about half a dozen. It will ask if you want to rewrite a couple files. Shouldn't matter but just let it rename them if you're worried. Go ahead and unmount in Daemon.

8: Run the setup in the folder you made (should have a yellow Rockstar icon next to it).

9: Let it try to install Direct X and C++ (it won't overwrite if you already have what's needed). You don't need to install the Bing toolbar.

That's it! The installation takes a whopping hour or so. I don't know why, but whatever- as someone who spent hours of hassle trying to get this game to crack and get around GFWL and Rockstar social club in the old days, I will gladly take a one-time long install if it means I can play this game free of headaches. Thank you very much uploader.a"
,miketheratguy,2011-09-21T07:03Z,"Whoops, correction- once you download the torrent you need about 23 GB of free space, not 35. The reason is because you need over 11 for the folder copy of the disc content, and another for the installed game. Once the game is installed, you can delete the folder you made or save it to a portable hard drive or whatever."

,soturi_,2012-04-01T13:20Z,you also need to turn your antivirus off while you install this game. if your antivirus doesn't give you any warning and it lets you install this without problems then I suggest that you get better one :P

,xDonarudo,2012-05-13T22:24Z,"Okay everything is running just fine, it's awesome, but when I pause and press the windows key on my keyboard, there is a problem. I click on the application to enter the game again and its just a black box (no pun intended) and so i have to log off and log back into my computer and start the game up again. I guess for now on i'll just pause it and not exit to desktop."
