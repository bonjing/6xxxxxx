upgraded to win-ultimate sucessfully....."
,nights0ul,2011-08-22T01:02Z,Thanks.
,bert16,2011-08-22T05:37Z,How long did you say it takes this loader to activate Windows? Did you say 10 minutes or did I misunderstand? Daz and w7lxe.exe are very effective and take a lot less time than that.
[V],.Dude.,2011-08-22T06:07Z,"The upgrade takes 10 minutes.
Loader takes less than 30 seconds :)"
,xeroxed,2011-08-23T01:59Z,"This just upgrades your windows 7 software right, or will this upgrade your vista to windows 7?"
,timberlax,2011-08-23T06:54Z,"I'm kinda confused about step #3...where do I paste it??? The Anytime Upgrade keygen? It just has a couple of generators and nothing is ""pastable"" in it. I must be missing something...?"
[V],.Dude.,2011-08-23T14:30Z,"Copy the key from Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade Keygen.
And then paste it in Windows anytime upgrade which is in Control Panel."
,profdj,2011-08-23T17:06Z,"I was really surprised that this actually worked O__o the upgrade that is, the activation didn't work for me :(
But thanks anyway! :D "
[V],.Dude.,2011-08-23T18:25Z,"Buddy,Even the activation works perfect.
Do activate it or within 3 days ul start getting ""Buy genuine windows"" message on your home screen."""
,hxcxewo,2011-08-24T20:20Z,Hey dude! Thanks for this torrent. I even made a TPB account just to thank you for this. More power dude!
,goobot,2011-08-26T17:38Z,I i guess this is a patch to make win 7 work right? Can i have a link to the actual os that works with this patch? Im trying to make a bootcamp on my mac with win 7. 
,dallasguy11,2011-08-27T02:43Z,"I followed the directions and the activator is loaded, but it still shows in System as ""3 days until automatic activation. Activate Windows Now"" When I click the ""Activation"" button in the loader it says Intial grace periods ends in 30days"" I tried using Repair Activation it restarts then is still not activated. At first I forgot to install as administrator so I uninstalled and reinstalled as admin but still says ""3 days. Activate Now."""
,stevenuf,2011-08-28T01:03Z,Thanks A bunch. Worked perfectly!
,jgalka74,2011-08-29T14:44Z,I used this on my laptop to upgrade from windows 7 home premium to ultimate and it worked great. I recently updated my pc from xp to 7 but the wrong loader screen installed so i tried using this activator to choose my screen and something went wrong. computer wont turn on. any ideas?  
[V],.Dude.,2011-08-29T16:30Z,"Sry,no idea..may b u will need to reinstall your copy of windows nw!"
,tun50,2011-08-30T11:38Z,"Hi Dude.

Thanks ....it works for me.

Just need to follow the instructions you have given. However, at step 4, there was a message that said the product key cannot be used or verified....something like that. Don't care, I just press cancel button. I restarted my pc after 10 mins. 

After restarting, it's still not activated. Don't care.... I just follow step 7 onwards....Bingo!!!

Thanks Dude."

,princeshrey,2011-09-03T07:11Z,Pls Help....!!Not working for ENTERPRISE....
,bhtani,2011-09-06T16:32Z,During activation (step #7 & 8) do I need to disconnect from net?  Coz this is not working for me :( (using win7 home premium & not interested in an upgrade :p )

,guy2345,2011-10-07T19:11Z,will this still keep your files?
,Luckmann,2011-10-20T23:25Z,"Doesn't work with Windows 7 Ultimate, because there is no such thing as ""Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade"" and the ""Windows 7 ULTIMATE activator by Lord Tidus"" is broken; doesn't work. Says installed Loader, restarting, but after restart, Windows 7 is still not ""Genuine"".

If I didn't know better (I scanned it) I'd call it a potential virus."
,darkmift,2011-10-21T17:49Z,Works like a charm...All hail pirate bay!
,Alkydale,2011-10-29T22:44Z,"Worked brilliant, upgraded netbook from starter to ultimate in around 40 minutes, thank you!!!!!"

,lonewolf121188,2011-11-16T06:08Z,"Help! I'm using Boot Camp on my MacBook Pro...I got the ""Your copy of Windows is not genuine"" message, so I downloaded this and ran it. My computer restarted automatically, but now when I try to boot into windows, I just get a black screen with a flashing cursor for about 4 seconds, then it reboots again automatically. Any ideas? I can't even get into safe mode, I don't think...can I do anything from OSX?

Probably an MBR issue, right?"
,lonewolf121188,2011-11-16T06:09Z,"Just want to clarify, I only pressed the Install/Remove Loader button, not any of the anytime upgrade stuff. And yes, I only pressed it once."
