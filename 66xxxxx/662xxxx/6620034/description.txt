Verse by verse, word by word, this is a commentary on the book of Romans. NGJ continually receives testimonies of lives changed and souls saved through listening to this greatest of all New Testament books. Until you know the book of Romans you donâ€™t know the Bible. If you have never listened to any Bible teaching by Michael Pearl, this is the place to start!

Michael also has a printed commentary on Romans 1-8 which is more extensive than the audio.
