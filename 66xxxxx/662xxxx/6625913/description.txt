Priming the pump - The death of addiction
There have been a number of articles in the news-o-sphere about the recent decision of the American Society of Addiction Medicine to classify addiction, be it alcohol, cocaine or sex addiction, as a mental disorder. Traditionally addiction was seen as, at least in the initiation of the addiction, moral failingâ€¦a weakness of mind. Modern research has brought such â€˜common senseâ€™ into doubt. The ASAM statement holds that an addition is really a â€œbio-psycho-socio-spiritualâ€ illness.
Though addicts canâ€™t choose not to be addicts, they can choose to get treatment. Recovery, ASAM says, is best realized not just by self-management and mutual support groups such as 12-step fellowships, but also with trained professional help. The ASAMâ€™s timing corresponds with the current revamping of American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disordersâ€”the bible of the mental health profession.
Why is it a highlight? I would like our listeners to check out the links on the show notes and let us know if you agree with addiction as a disease, the use of the spirituality in treating addiction, 12-step programsâ€¦this will likely be a future segment.
