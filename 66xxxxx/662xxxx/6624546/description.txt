From Wiki:

The Dayglo Abortions are a Canadian punk band from Victoria, British Columbia. Their lyrics are informed by a complete disregard for societal norms. They formed in 1979 and released their first album in 1981. The band's biography, Argh Fuck Kill: The Story of the Dayglo Abortions, by author Chris Walter, was published in 2010 by Gofuckyerself Press.

In 1988, a Nepean, Ontario police officer instigated a criminal investigation of the Dayglos after his daughter brought home a copy of Here Today, Guano Tomorrow.

Two albums featured in the resulting trial; the covers and the lyrical content being showcased by the prosecution. Here Today, Guano Tomorrow had a cover showing a picture of a hamster eating from a box of chocolates on nice satin sheets, along with a glass of wine. A gun points at the hamster, and the back cover shows a depiction of the resulting carnage.

The previous album, Feed Us A Fetus, was perhaps a little less graphic, with a depiction of a baked fetus on the table in front of Ronald and Nancy Reagan.

This resulted in the criminal prosecution of Fringe Product, their label at the time, for distribution and possession with intent to distribute of obscene materialâ€”the first such prosecution since the offense entered the criminal code in 1959. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty.

The Dayglos, for the title song of their next album, Two Dogs Fucking, concerned the supposed priggishness of Ottawa's public officials leading directly to the extinction of the human race.

Dayglo Abortions singer, Gymbo Jak, also sings in Maximum RNR.[1]

On their most recent album, the Dayglos showed a new-found political awareness. Holy Shiite has song titles such as "America Eats Her Young", "Christina Bin Laden", "Scientology", and "Where's Bin Laden?".

Here Today, Guano Tomorrow 1987



Here Today, Guano Tomorrow is a 1987 album by the Dayglo Abortions. This is one of the very few late 80's punk albums that was available on 8 track.[citation needed] The cassette version was on high quality Cr02 (chrome) tape with Dolby, also very unusual for indie labels of the day.

Foobles the Clown pays ode to 'Fuck My Shit Stinks' on his 'Tribute to Dayglo Abortions' YouTube upload. The song plays in the background while Foobles places a hamster in a blender, which eventually is turned on . This video was criticized very much until Foobles himself explained that the hamster was taken out of the blender and replaced with a mixture of "different things".
