BUT why so poor quality??

Samplingfreq: 22k
Bitfreq: 32

64/44kHz Mono is good enough an take just a little more diskspace/download time.

I didn't do the rip I just stumbled across it on deeper reaches of the internet and thought I might share, If you find a better sampling please post it in the comments"
