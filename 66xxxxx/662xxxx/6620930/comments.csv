There was a few spots for about a second where it turned pixel-ated. It was great, though. Good watch!"

,farkstick,2011-08-23T00:48Z,"It's unfortunate EZTV keeps pushing out releases by this group, be warned ASAP seems to stress speed over quality.  Their previous efforts this season related to Breaking Bad speak for themselves."
,Erich505,2011-08-23T01:52Z,With ez you never have to worry. All quality.
,Warbuxx,2011-08-23T02:12Z,"Thanks for the excellent release, the haters on this site are retarded. Remember when you missed a tv show and couldn't catch up unless they re-ran the episode? I do. Thanks eztv. "

,gramranger,2011-08-23T23:36Z,"Ugh, why does the most awesome service ""EZTV"" keep supporting the worst encoding group out there (ASAP)???

Video: 1
Audio: 9

Every other second is a blurry mess. Typical ASAP encoding I've seen in countless other tv shows. Its a shame they have decided to come in and taint Breaking Bad."
,Bokey_Boy,2011-08-24T02:05Z,EZTV has the best! if u didnt download from EZTV u didnt get the best!! thanx EZ!!!
,carlinhos_50000,2011-08-24T04:50Z,Thanks

,equalizer231312,2011-08-31T14:12Z,"Who are you talking to
right now?


Who is it you think you see?


Do you know how much
I make a year?

I mean, even if I told you,
you wouldn't believe it.


Do you know what would happen


if I suddenly decided
to stop going in to work?


A business big enough


that it could be listed
on the NASDAQ

goes belly-up, disappears.

It ceases to exist
without me. No.

You clearly don't know
who you're talking to,

so let me clue you in.


I am not in danger, Skyler.


I am the danger.

A guy opens his door
and gets shot,

and you think that of me?


No.

I am the one who knocks."
,Books6000,2012-01-28T00:26Z,"The best By far, thank You EZTV!"
