Colin Murray is joined by Lee Dixon and John Hartson for highlights from the day's three Premier League matches, 
including the game between Bolton and Manchester City. It's a quick return to the Reebok Stadium for City, 
whose 2-0 win over the Trotters on the final day of last season helped them secure a third-place finish. 
Premier League football returns to Carrow Road for the first time since 2005 as Norwich take on Stoke. 
Paul Lambert's side were the surprise package in last season's Championship, but they face a real step 
up in class against the Potters, who were beaten finalists in the FA Cup final back in May. 
The day's other game is at Molineux, where Fulham take a trip to Wolverhampton Wanderers. 
Mick McCarthy's men narrowly escaped relegation on the final day of last season, 
and his Wolves side will be hungry to get points on the board quickly this year. 
There is also a chance to catch up on all yesterday's goals and talking points.
