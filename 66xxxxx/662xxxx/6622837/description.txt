We have only just compiled a most up to date listing of IP ranges by country
for an upcoming free compiled FoxPro program that will allow you to create your
own IP filter from a menu of country choices.


From our latest download of the GeoIPCountryCSV.zip file on the net
which we have sorted for you - by country code into separate files

For now, here is a list of all countries from which to pick and choose
wisely to keep to peers that allow for seeding to more relevant areas in hopes
of efficiency.

Create your own ipfilter.dat text file using the same format of the text
files included here. Simply copy and paste into one big file, whatever best 
fits your needs, and name it ipfilter.dat as is likely required by
whatever software you might be using. ipfilter.dat works for utorrent in 
any event, right now.

Its easy to view using notepad etc and can be added to for such problems as clients that are using defective software as often happens with selected
qbtorrent and even (more rarely) some utorrent clients etc that show no
progress regardless of how much you seed them - even if they come and go.
The software should be smart enough to disconnect them - but then who ever
said its a genius that wrote utorrent as it is! No logic to sharing 
patterns whatever! Simply insane!

Simply place your ipfilter.dat file in your utorrent applications data
directory (under documents and settings) for the relevant user configuration for
XP etc (Or search for the existing file and over-write it if desired)
