,crab2cool,2011-08-24T18:31Z,Thanks a million!
[V],mirrormaster82,2011-08-24T18:37Z,"Yeah,I know...to much times between issues..."
[T],MrDowntown,2011-08-24T19:25Z,I read that #4/#5 will be released together to catch up - believe it when i see it. Love Millar stuff but he does TOO MUCH and is too erratic with scheduling. Are we ever gonna see more Superior or Nemesis2??
,BatDinger,2011-08-24T19:26Z,yeeeeeeeeah boy! its supposed to be on a regular schedule starting with this issue
[V],mirrormaster82,2011-08-24T19:50Z,"Superior should be out next month or so I've heard.As for kick-ass maybe Romita Jr. can't draw faster since he is drawing Avengers too,but I doubt that that's the issue since he has already tackled 2 books a month in the past..."
,cartman19987,2011-08-24T20:46Z,Awesome! Thanks so much! I'll seed indefinitely.
,MuserClair,2011-08-25T01:47Z,"millar recently blamed the delay on 'scheduling issues', but tbh, he's not exactly got a good track record on completing his creations in a timely manner.........if at all!

Anyways it's here (about efffing time!) - thanks for the ul, MM! :-)"
,RexxEverything,2011-08-26T10:43Z,Thank you soooooo much! Can't even begin to tell you how much this means to me.
[V],mirrormaster82,2011-09-03T23:09Z,"Don't know if Millar watched this before it aired,but it's copy-paste stuff according to this---nevertheless watch this if you haven't - fun and heartwarming tale... and be sure to check "" super "" i really liked it...http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6609301/Superheroes.2011.HDTV.XviD-aAF.........................................http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6561033/Super_(2010)_BRRip_Xvid_AC3-Anarchy"
