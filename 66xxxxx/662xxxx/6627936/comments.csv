,Mautty,2011-08-25T08:45Z,He is not a god and every thing that lives has cellular decay. As he ages his cells wont be able to become superchargerd like they did in his prime. He is invulnerable not invincible.
,cartman19987,2011-08-26T00:47Z,"Yeah, I guess that makes sense. But still, he does age a rate much slower than humans, so I think that any cellular decay wouldn't happen until much later than this story implies."
,plattekak,2011-08-29T14:51Z,remember this is world #3 Superman that means there are different rules (e.g. look at Superboy prime)
,cartman19987,2011-09-17T18:32Z,"@plattekak, oh right that makes sense. Also, I'm not very well-versed in DC continuity, but didn't the Infinite Crisis series eliminate all other universes? So how is there an Earth 3 Superman in this story?"
