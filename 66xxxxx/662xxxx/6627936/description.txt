From the hit comic series BATMAN BEYOND comes the adventures of The Man of Tomorrow in the DC Universe of the future. 

As Superman feels his super-powers beginning to decline, The Last Son of Krypton is called back into action to stop a villain more powerful than any he's faced before. This looks like a job for Superman Beyond!
