,KhanGirey,2011-08-29T07:04Z,Is this auto update or is it manual or no way at all. When I use the update.exe it says invalid command line.
,psyche61,2011-08-30T16:18Z,"downloaded it, and symantec removed the exe files!   if anyone else had this problem, disable the antivirus when downloading this.. install and then turn on the antivirus.. what a pain!  I had to download it again LOL"

,NowhereMan012,2011-09-03T03:58Z,Yeah how do we update this? is it manual or auto? because there's already a new version of AB Seasons (the one with moon festival) and it won't update. How do we update it?
,NowhereMan012,2011-09-03T09:33Z,"btw, this is a great torrent, it works and there's no virus. extremezone's my trusted uploader..."

,beachbum37,2011-09-04T23:15Z,why does norton say trojan.ADH? kinda new to this and i trust you extreme. Is it the crack?
,beachbum37,2011-09-05T06:36Z,"@bonnym 
I use norton 360 and it said trojan.ADH. so i have no ideah whats what."
,watzit2u,2011-09-05T19:04Z,"I trust extremezone implicitly, but this torrent was not playing nicely. "

,Kal_Torak,2011-10-11T03:17Z,"The ""virus"" is nothing more than a false positive. "
,Atomiic,2011-10-12T18:10Z,"OMFG you stupid people,use Avast on something else than McAfee or Norton. They're the worst protection your comp can have, extremezone is pretty much the most trusted guy in the whole TPB 
-.- i pretty much only download his torrents cuz they're always 100% virus free"
,Sora_Li,2011-10-23T02:20Z,I downloaded it and it works fine except the game only shows half the screen. How do I fix this so that I can see the entire thing?
,Sora_Li,2011-10-23T03:17Z,"Okay, so my screen somehow fixed itself, really not sure how... but the activation key/code isn't working. It always says registration failed. What can I do to fix this?"
,ericv1984,2011-10-25T22:44Z,"Hey dumbasses, ALL cracked programs get flagged as viruses. Do some fucking research before bitching and complaining over nothing."
,Grailknight,2011-11-04T11:38Z,Norton IS 2011 says it's clean :)
,kriptikchicken,2011-11-15T09:05Z,"A. The way patches are packed, some AV's think they are bad.... THEY ARE NOT.

B. If you install the games and enter the serials, the games will then allow you to update to the latest version online WITHOUT the need for a new serial or patch. :)

C. Don't do it the other way around or the patch fails. ;)"

I'm new to games if someone can help me out.."
,jlar1973,2012-01-03T09:24Z,"Somethings wrong with this !
First people have said they get virus warnings...
When I install this version of the game, i lose my 'D:' hdd ...
I rather belive an Antivirus over a guy I don't know."

Scanned with Norton full version, was easily removed.  My guess is it's a false positive and I'm probably going to have to re-download because it just removed an important graphics file :\  
All the same, be safe, ALWAYS RUN YOUR ANTIVIRUS AND A PEERBLOCKER WHILE DOWNLOADING AND SEEDING!  Thx for the torrent, I'll update when I've fixed it and played."
,hondac3,2012-01-07T15:33Z,"Great torrent, once again, from extremezone.  Both trainers were unfortunately removed twice by Norton, which, again, is probably a false-positive, but just to be safe I'll probably not be using them.  Seeding till tonight :)"
