[T],oddeven,2011-08-27T17:51Z,"griez, you might enjoy ""Nuit de chien"", and if you missed it, ""26 bathrooms"", and if you're still into Vonnegut, ""Knoflikari"" if you didn't pick it up elsewhere."

[T],oddeven,2011-09-03T12:47Z,"Thank you, sunshot100, I ordered it about a month ago, but it still hasn't shipped.  There is some confusion whether it will have English subs."
,mouffette,2012-03-24T00:51Z,"Lured - thank you!  http://www.kino.com/press/glamourgirls/lured_2.jpg Lucille Ball did some interesting films other than comedy, my favourite (and hers) being The Big Street.  She and Henry Fonda were fabulous and Agnes Moorehead in a supporting role was unrecognizable as we are so used to seeing her as Endora on Bewitched.  Check her out also as a Goldwyn Girl in Roman Scandals!  "
