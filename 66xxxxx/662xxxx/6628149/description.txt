"British Legends" investigates five heroes of British history: Boudicca, Macbeth, King Harold, William Wallace (better known as Braveheart) and Robin Hood. Although all but one died a failure, each was seen as symbolizing something great during their lifetime. Tony Robinson journeys into history to trace the true stories of some of the greatest Britons that every lived, seeking to discover who the real people were behind the myths that surround them, and ultimately how these myths have woven themselves into our nation's character and its perception of itself.
