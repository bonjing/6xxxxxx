Worth downloading???"
,Jayzen_Freeze,2011-08-25T12:34Z,This film is a propaganda film to recruit people into the military by glorifying murder and torture as the american military does! 
,redrumpanda,2011-08-25T16:32Z,"@Jayzen_Freeze
The American military does not glorify murder nor torture. The entire military is based on volunteers who are average citizens of the United States that are trained to be an elite force. With that said fuck you buddy. 
The next time you need the US to stop some tyrant from raping your women and enslaving your people don't fucking call us if we're so bad. Remember WWII? Saved the entire planets ass in that one. We are not a warmongering nation we were wronged, and we set that shit straight. Bin Laden, Saddam, and now Gadhafi are proof of what happens when you try to enslave and torture your people. America is a force of good so if you don't want us helping you which includes aides such as money, food, and military force then go bitch at your govt officials begging us for assistance.
Tsunamis, earthquakes, famen, and genocide you all want our help when it happens to you. Then weeks later you are sitting back cozy uses our money/supplies bitching about how bad we are. But you know what fuck all of you help yourselves."
,proest,2011-08-25T21:47Z,"@redrumpanda, the American military reinstated murder and torture. Your volunteers are poor beggars with no other option in life. Your elite force is getting slaughtered again and again since the Korean war. World war II only got your attention after the massacre in Pearl Harbor. Until then they sat on their fat asses and let their allies rot. Your force of good let their own people starve and swindled the whole planet to a bankruptcy leaving the dollar good for one thing; toilet paper. And even as that it sucks.  We are doing fine by ourselves tank you."
,HamBoned,2011-08-25T22:06Z,"NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR YOUR OPINIONS ON THE US MILITARY, IS THE MOVIE WORTH DOWNLOADING OR NOT?"
,redactedwv,2011-08-26T00:46Z,"Bollocks, redrumpanda. And that's coming from an ACTUAL vet (Bombaconda, motherfucker).

The US military is made up of 2 broad groups: Those who were economically conscripted as a result of living under an inherently unfair system designed from top to bottom for the benefit of the wealthy; and those predisposed by upbringing and ideology to be right-wing, authoritarian hierarchical 'thinkers'.

Your 'all volunteer army' line is silly superficial nonsense, parroted by every dull-normal fucktard whose pulse rate increases while watching GIJoe for the umpteenth time.

It is, by definition and in practice, a culture of aggression, authoritarianism, and domination. The ""all volunteer"" system you advocate - by design - lands disproportionately on the working class. It has created a dangerous ideological homogenization in every branch. It's a big subject, but suffice it to say: it's bad... and it leads to exactly the situation we're in today (a situation about which you're entirely clueless). The number of war crimes we've committed in the last decade alone boggles the mind, from rampant torture to murder squads to 'incidents' like the rape of Fallujah writ large. Whiskey Pete, anyone?

Even when you ignore the facts, redrum... They're still there.

You know absolutely nothing about what you are talking about. Nothing.

As for your take on American foreign policy, still more superficial pablum. Might want to pick up a book sometime, rather than getting your understanding of the world from the back of the nearest cereal box. It's astonishing that people like yourself continue to ignore the volumes of evidence that do not jive with your ever-simplistic worldview.

'A People's History of the United States' (written by a WW2 bombardier from the 490th), 'Confessions of an Economic Hitman', and 'The Shock Doctrine' will get you started, if you're interested in something approaching a realistic, fact-based assessment of the world.

Reply if you like, but the tone and content of such a missive is well traveled ground, and entirely predictable. I'm going to go ahead and register my disagreement now - why wait? Your reply, and those of the frustrated and poorly informed fox-fed buffoons that will agree with you, can all be filed under 'H', for 'hopeless'.  

But do type away, keyboard warrior... The barons in the castle always love to see the spirited defense their serfs provide.

------------

Apologies, ErikZown.... But if some basement-dwelling tablepounder is going to crap out a bunch of juvenile piffle and pass it off as an accurate representation of the military, i'm going to smack it down at least once. 

Having said all that.... Sincere thanks for the up. Even if it's schlock, it's always entertaining on one level or another. Will seed to 10 or more. 

Thx to all s/l's."
,redrumpanda,2011-08-26T14:16Z,"To all you fucks on here: Fuck you!

None of you know shit about the US govt nor the Military you proved that by what you said. Stop being a pretend soldier over the internet. 

Stop relying on our dollar if it fucked your economies up. We are still the number one super power on the planet get over it. China has people but cant afford to feed them, and their military is smaller than our state run militia. 

The only govt that I actually approve of besides our own is the UK at least the had the brains not to trade their currency in for you euro trash."
,T3CHN0M4NC3R,2011-08-26T17:36Z,do we really need to go all racist and political over a movie? y so srs?
,catdaddy420,2011-08-26T18:53Z,Someone needs a hug! 
,wakaju,2011-08-26T20:11Z,"hug???
now watch gaddafi hug @rerumpanda"
,Phatfish,2011-09-11T21:21Z,"@Jayzen_Freeze:

What fuckin movie did you watch?

This movie isn't really about the military at all. It's about a mentally unstable and confused kid who's growing up and trying to find a meaning of it all.
The idea was good, but unfortunately the finished movie is total, utter crap. 


Thanks anyway though!"
,nedgehead,2011-09-27T14:22Z,"WTF??? I'm sure there are forums all over the net that ye fucktards can join if ye want to have a debate over fucking military/political/currency matters. Now shut the FUCK up already. Seeing as there are no A/V/M reviews here I will d/l myself and give feedback which, unless I'm mistaken and i don't think I am, I think the u/l'r would fucking appreciate.."
