The film is as much as Mario Salieri, 1991. Information on the film there are practically none, rare film. If, in general, we are talking about one of the favorite topics of the director, sex in a convent with an implicit coercion to his sisters. In addition the film is notable for the fact that it was withdrawn Miss France 1985 Carole Tredille. And I must say that she knows his job very well. The whole movie plays organ and hear a song sung a beautiful female voice. It is from this beautiful music and nuns have given the Cardinal and those who are in his favor. To sum up, we actually do not even know who the director, just look a few frames from the movie, and it is immediately clear - this is Salieri, as he takes only that now, in 1991.
