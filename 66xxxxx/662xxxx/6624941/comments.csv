RCA thought that since they had the contract for vinyl, cassette, and 8-track that they could release in the brand new CD format.  This upset Bowie, and he pulled his catalog from RCA.  All his recordings were then (after a great period of time) available on Rykodisk.  The music files on this torrent are in lossless FLAC."
