Like the living legend that is Deadmau5, the Canada icon uncovers a new solo render. As premiered in his Essential Mix at Space in Ibiza for BBC Radio 1, Professional Griefers is another genuine and infectious trademark for the industryâ€™s most ingriguing character. Donâ€™t let the initiating and chunky beats fool you as it covers an underlying, profilic touch of the classic Mr. Zimmerman to it with a progressive sound dynamic. Coming off the release of his 4Ã—4=12 album in December and the renowned release of HR 8938 Cephei in March, the Canadian is back, and with a dash of meaty electro tones. Well-known for his notorious statements and liberal alignments, his pronounced earmark has helped him scoop an astonishingly loyal fan base of numerous millions and start off a record label that has come to be one of the more prominent in its region. However, Deadmau5 is about to unleash another well-shaped, long-awaited single on Mau5trap Recordings and itâ€™s indeed a spectacular one.
