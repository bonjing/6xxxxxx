The Db level on this torrent is too much."

,caglar90,2011-09-01T17:39Z,thank you
,kneebutt,2011-09-02T10:25Z,Try to remember - only fuckwits buy music from I-tunes.  Anyone who tries to ease their guilty dowloading conscience by suggesting we hand money over to Apple are as fucked in the head as they sound.  No musician ever felt less ripped off because some un-involved corporation managed to get rich off their music.  If you support I-tunes just do everyone a favour and kill yourself - but first kill your parents incase they inadvertantly give birth to another piece of shit like you in the future.
,chatters,2011-09-02T12:29Z,thank you :) but highly advice going out and buying it cant wait to listen to it and catch the next tour! RHCP best band in the world :D

,bigdnz,2011-09-17T07:43Z,"@tonyflows

Blame it on the governments around the world who force us to find things for free because they are making it too hard to live an honest life and pay for everything we want.

Besides Music should be free anyway."

http://vlep.pl/feu6bh.jpg
oversampled - peaks are cut...
just get another torrent and ave your ears."
,HiroPro2,2011-10-10T07:00Z,"Please stop ripping in CBR!

I don't understand why people have the idea that CBR would be better than VBR!!!

The LAME encoder was DESIGNED TO DO VBR!!! And a lot of the work the devs did was in that regard. All you idiots are doing is making INFERIOR and LARGER files than if you just used -altpreset -v2

use VBR and JOINT STEREO!!!

Not CBR320 Stereo YOU RETARDS!

and use dBpoweramp to rip!"
,HiroPro2,2011-10-11T00:13Z,"Mp3 101 !!!

(1) Encode using the LAME encoder (itunes is CRAP using Fraunhofer encoder boo!!)

(2) Set encoder to VBR (variable bit rate) as LAME was engineered for this. CBR is CRAP and in all honesty a VBR altpreset standard at -V0 is as good as a 320 CBR !!!! and file is WAY SMALLER!!!

(3) SET IT TO JOINT STEREO NOT ""STEREO"" and if I have to explain don't ask because you have no comprehension of what the setting actually does or the maths/technology behind mp3!!!

owhh and LEARN how to use GOOGLE and RESEARCH ripping music PROPERLY you 320 CBR Fraunhofer ppl!!!

PS dBpoweramps is FANTASTIC ripping software! "
