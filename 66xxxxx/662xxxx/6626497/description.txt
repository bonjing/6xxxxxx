After being pushed around, threatened and more by "A," Emily is at a breaking point and her friends know that something drastic has to be done to save her. The girls turn to the only person they have come to trust and know that she can't let their secrets out - Dr. Anne Sullivan. Finally being able to reveal the torment that "A" has put them through to someone outside of the tight-knit group gives the girls a sense of relief and Emily a new sense of courage. But with the cat being out of the bag, has a weight really been lifted off their shoulders, or could it possibly have just provoked a beast? And now that Dr. Sullivan is aware of "A" and what the girls have been put through, could she be next on "A's" target list? Meanwhile, Hanna's grandmother comes to town to stir up trouble for Tom's rehearsal dinner.
