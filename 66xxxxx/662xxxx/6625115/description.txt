  Grab your oxygen mask and jump into the future of interplanetary defense. 
  The year is 2219AD, and Earth's Star Federation has unleashed the R-GRAY 
  advanced tactical combat fighter to save the planet from certain destruction 
  at the hands of the bloodthirsty Secilia Federation. Despite impossible odds, 
  you must now command a specially outfitted R-GRAY fighter to defend Earth 
  from certain destruction. Each fighter is equipped with lock-on lasers, 
  pulse lasers, and a single devastating assault laser array that can destroy 
  all sighted targets at once. Even with this technology at your disposal, 
  the battle will not be easy. Earth's forces are depleted, and the merciless 
  hordes of Secilia will settle for nothing less than complete annhilation of 
  Earth. Fortunately, Star command has created two R-GRAY prototypes, 
  so if you need extra firepower, a skilled friend can fly at your side. 
  Whether you fly solo or with a friend, the intense sound, action, 
  and arcade-perfect Hyper-3D visuals will blow you away!
