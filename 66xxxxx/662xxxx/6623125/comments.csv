Any help would we appreciated!"
,kzeroffthree,2011-08-23T14:47Z,"Thanks for the upload, however I'm getting an error. Is this upload only for 64bit Windows? Since it says to me that my version of Windows is invalid. I've got the 32bit version."

,sk8ingboy,2011-08-24T01:13Z,the game crashes to the desktop when it wants to load the game
,Silver4k,2011-08-24T02:36Z,"I can't even get the game to install. Mounted the image, tried to run the setup.exe and I'm getting an error:
setup.exe - Application Error
The application was unable to start correctly. Click OK to close to application.

So, I can't tell if this is legit. Gonna try the one from soupucia and see if that one will at least install.

Win7SP1x64"

,yowan,2011-08-28T17:52Z,AVG warns for Agent_r.ANQ in setup.exe.
,pirateola,2011-09-21T08:59Z,"Setup.exe contains ""Torjan:Win32/Alureon.DX""

To install :- 
extract contents of setup.exe to hard disk, on doing this you will get  two files 'REG~1.exe' which is the virus and the other the proper 'setup.exe'. If you have an anti-virus software the virus is automatically deleted on detection.

Copy rest of the files from the iso to your hard disk along with the proper setup.exe and install. Done."
