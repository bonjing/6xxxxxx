Release Notes....: With the new rules release, last week S03E02 was encoded at CRF 22 since it was competitive reality. This show
                   seems to be more compressible than most competitive reality since it can out with such a low bitrate. This
                   week CRF 20 was used which seemed to yield a very reasonable bitrate for competitive reality. This will be the
                   CRF value used for the rest of the season.
