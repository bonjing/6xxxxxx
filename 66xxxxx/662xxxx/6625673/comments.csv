,grafex,2011-08-25T17:35Z,thanks for the upload!  don't know why people complain about rar files...takes all of 2 seconds to unpack them and watch
,useitright,2011-08-25T21:49Z,One of these days you will unpack something that you don't want in your oh so safe rar files.  Then you will know why people are so weary of them.....because they have a right to be.
