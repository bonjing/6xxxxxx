RegRun Warrior offers you a way to quickly detect and remove hidden rootkits/viruses/malware from your computer using the special boot CD.

Precise double-checking for a Windows-based PC, which allows identifying and eliminating any types of malicious software. RegRun completes its initial checks during the very first steps of Windows initialization detecting thereby all automatically launched programs. 
The second external check is made when a computer boots from a CD/USB device. This principle of double-checking offers a superb advantage: any suspicious code is removed prior getting a chance to run in your system. 

It is easy to locate and to eliminate any inactive malicious software at this stage. It also becomes quite easy to discover any kernel rootkits, which hide their files away, as well as any registry and boot-record rootkits. 

Every malicious code becomes visible as if it has been looked upon with a magnifier, whereby it is absolutely impossible neither to hide away nor to avoid the RegRun cure.
