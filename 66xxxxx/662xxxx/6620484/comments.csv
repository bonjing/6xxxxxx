[V],DownTYU,2011-08-22T01:45Z,There are so many optimists here. 1492: Conquest of Paradise is Scott's worst film...This one's just great.
,VicVega,2011-08-22T20:06Z,"OK, 1492 is bad too. Dull as hell. I guess it's a matter of personal taste if you prefer a bad scifi/fantasy or a bad historic drama. It all boils down to the story. Bad script = bad movie."
