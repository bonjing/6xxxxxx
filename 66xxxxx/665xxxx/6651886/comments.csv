,tartangaz,2011-09-05T15:02Z,"thanks for this 720 version.
just watched the first 10 mins on the stv player.......looks great but it's ruined with ads. "
,sharkcutter,2011-09-07T17:01Z,"Great quality download, thanks. A great show about a horrible couple. No idea what tartangaz is on, there are no commercials, shame when people post lies."
,southak,2011-09-14T17:21Z,"@sharkcutter - I don't think he/she is lying, stv = sky tv online tool similar to 4od and BBC Iplayer. I assume they mean the version on stv player had ads in it."
