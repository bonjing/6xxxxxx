This book is a result of my almost half-century study of the morphology and systematic of fl owering plants. It continues my work published in several of my previous books, especially â€œSystema Magnoliophytorumâ€ (1987), published in Russian, and its continuation and expansion â€“ â€œDiversity and Classifi cation of Flowering Plantsâ€ (1997), published in English. However, when writing this book of mine, I have inevitably analyzed and considered the matter again and in many cases considerably changed the former conclusions. Here I present an essentially new version of my system.

My new revision of the system is based on a great amount of new information published in the last decade as well as on discussions and consultations with many of my colleagues. New taxonomic revisions of large groups, including families, and new comparative-morphological studies of various groups, including an increasing number of micromorphological (ultrastructural) studies, were especially important for phylogenetic inferences.

No less important was a rapidly increasing number of molecular taxonomic studies, provided that they did not contradict the totality of other evidence. I would like to thank Dr. Peter Stevens and Dr. James Reveal for reading the manuscript. Both of them made valuable suggestions that were very helpful during the preparation of the fi nal version of the book. My work on this book would be impossible without the great help of Tatiana Wielgorskaya. She has helped me not only in all kinds of computer work but also in the search of literature.
