One of the underrated gems of the 1960s, Salt And Pepper is an exciting matchup of tenors Sonny Stitt and Paul Gonsalves. It is very much a jam session set, with "Salt And Pepper" being a heated medium-tempo blues and the two competitive tenors stretching out on "S'posin'" and a lengthy "Perdido." The most memorable selection from the date is the one on which Stitt switches to alto, "Stardust." His beautiful playing behind Gonsalves' warm melody statement raises the session to the classic level. 
Highly recommended to bebop and straight-ahead jazz fans.
