Being an avid Cornwell fan, I am always looking for his works that I have yet to read and today you've posted one. Battle Flag is the 3rd in The Starbuck Chronicles. I'd be ecstatic if you could post the others - Rebel(1993),Copperhead(1994) & The Bloody Ground(1996). 
Even if you can't, I am grateful for what you post. Thanks."
