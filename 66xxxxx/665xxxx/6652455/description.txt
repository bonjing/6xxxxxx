The Quilt Inn Country Cookbook was written as an invitation for you to join us at The Quilt Inn, to savor not only the joy of bountiful down-home cooking, but to drink in the pleasures of country inn living. We are itinerant travellers and country inn lovers, and we have selected and savored the best recipes of all the ones that we have tried, to create the essence of â€œinn-nessâ€ for you. Weâ€™ve collected our favorite dishes, and memories, and spread them out for you here on our harvest table for you to sample and enjoy. When you re-create these recipes for yourself, and as the homey smells of country cooking waft through your own kitchen, we hope you will be transported to The Quilt Inn where a warm welcome awaits you.

People often ask us where The Quilt Inn is located, and when then can come visit us. The Quilt Inn is that mythic sort of place, like Camelot, that rises unexpectedly and fortuitously at the end of a long day to give haven to the weary traveller. Weâ€™ve all been to The Quilt Inn, if only in our hearts. The Quilt Inn is old and cozy, just like one of Grandmaâ€™s beloved and faded quilts it was named for. Whenever we are weary and bleary-eyed we can wrap it around us, and sink into its warmth.

In Spring, we find the Inn in a cozy valley blanketed with snowy white cherry and peach blossoms. In Summer, we find it perched atop a breezy hill where the verdant treetops rustle like yards of crisp taffeta swooshing overhead. In Autumn, we find it at the end of a long narrow lane bordered by rows of trees in riotous colored patchwork. In Winter, we find it etched sharply in delicate filigrees of ice as our footsteps crunch noisily across the big snowy fields toward a wisp of smoke and warmth.
