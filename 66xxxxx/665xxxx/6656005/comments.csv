Dunno, wondering the same thing myself about co-op, this is the steam version i believe (not sure if there is another version) and normally that means you can't lan it if it's a steam cracked game (taken from personal experience no one jump to conclusions here lol) but u can connect with some of them via I.P address on the lan works sometimes, i remember co-oping the L4D games that way, anyways if someone could confirm wether there is co-op or not that would be appreciated, i'm sure lots of people want to know :) I've set my download and my upload speed to unlimited, so it's in god's hands.. =D"

copy these 2 preload ncf to steamapps folder:
media*fire*.*com / ?1v3992vnmny3t29

copy game files to steam\steamapps\common\dead island\
run smartsteam (you need US vpn) and launch the game, it should decrypt your files.
extract my decrypted binaries to your steamapps folder:
file*serve*.*com / file / YdcFJdu

copy only the cracked exe (do not use their cracked steamapi.dll , steamclient.dll. it may cause problems).
Launch it through cracked steam.

Step 1: Download this torrent
Step 2: Download ""Dead Island.Crack Update - RELOADED"" (found by searching ""dead island"" on piratebay)
Step 3: SEED FOR DAYS
Step 4: Install the game (the one in this torrent) by clicking the one that says ""dead island"" it should have application written next to it.
Step 5: The installer is not in english (the game is though) so simply just hit next next next etc as you would normally install a game. The one you want to click is the highlighted one each time. 
Step 6: Copy all the data from the other torrent into the main directory which unless changed should be C: > Game > Dead island. You'll know if it's the right place because the files you are copying will be the same ones as the ones in your Dead island (game installation) folder.
Step 7: You will have to create new folders in order to be able to save your game, to do this go to c: > Game > Dead island and in that directory (the one where you copied the reloaded update to) Create two new folders ""Save"" and ""Profiles"". 
Step 8: Launch the game and have fun
Step 9: for some reason when i went to run it after all that, it crashed when trying to load the game, instead i ran the shortcut that opens after installing the game and it then worked fine and after that i could run the game from the folder, if anyone has any questions at all, i'll try and do my best to help, though i'm a bit of a noob at this stuff to be honest. I hope everyone enjoys this game and make sure you seed guys. Not everyone is in the position to be able to but if you have unlimited internet and you don't have to pay extra, then seed like crazy, because after all your not online gaming with this game so it's either seed and help out or have your internet doing nothing

To fix your save problems just follow these steps.
1. Navigate to installation directory (inside Deadisland Folder)
2. Create a folder and name it ""Out"" (without Quotes)
3. Go inside that Out folder you just made and make two folders named ""Save"" and ""Profiles""

And thats pretty much it. To clarify the directory its

""Game/DeadIsland/Out/Save""
""Game/DeadIsland/Out/Profiles""

Good Luck. 
Btw dont go on asking on legit forums how to save on this lol, legit users do not have the save problem its only for us who pirated it, so if you go on asking why your copy isnt saving, youl get yourself in trouble and make a fool out of yourselvs."

,cyborg34573,2011-09-09T18:54Z,"@ colmbob1

Try applying reloaded's update 1. Make sure you keep a backup of your Deadislandgame.exe first tho before patching because reloadeds cracked exe file causes stuttering when vsync is turn on, the one that comes with this doesnt. So basicaly after patching wiith the reloaded patch, just copy over your original (backed up) Deadislandgame.exe and vsync shouldwork fine again.

But about the saves. If it still crashes after patching try this.
go to
'Game/Deadisland/DI/Out'.
Inside that Out folder again, create two folders named Save and Profiles. So now you have 4 existing copies of em

two located in
'Game/Deadisland/Out/Save
'Game/Deadisland/Out/Profiles

two in
'Game/Deadisland/DI/Out/Save
'Game/Deadisland/DI/Out/Profiles


Idk exactly what fixed it for me, cause adding in the folders caused my games to crash aswell, but after installing the reloaded update and adding in the samefolders in the other Out folder located in DI, my game magicaly worked."

Go into the root dir of game. Ex. C:\program files\dead island\

in the game root, create a dir called OUT.
 in the OUT create two more dir's called SAVE and PROFILE.

ex.
 C:\program files\dead island\out\save
 C:\program files\dead island\out\profiles

Thats it. The save game and option profile will now work.
