,james50a,2011-09-05T01:59Z,download was slow and to big. better torrents out there for this file
,Nitsus,2011-09-05T21:31Z,@james50a: Some of us care for quality. And there's no torrent better than this one yet.
,RedSuperKilla,2011-09-06T12:22Z,"Recently, FOV torrents for Doctor Who simply refuse to work on a Popcorn Hour C200 (with up-to-date Firmware).  It ""Can not be Read"" or it completely blocks the Popcorn Device.  I've never had any problem reading MKV-files before...   Is there anyone who knows if the EZTV releases of Doctor Who work better on a PCH C200?"

2005 as opposed to the old doctor who series. It isn't a mistake. imdb it."

,tortall,2011-09-10T18:15Z,"This was the only one I could get to download at any reasonable speed, but it's far too big and when I went to play it it was all grey. Never had an issue with eztv before which is why I selected this download even though it was bigger. Very surprised about the lack of video."
,Livens,2011-09-12T02:41Z,"@tortall,

The video is there, trust me, I just watched it last night.

However, early on there were a few glitches where the video skipped and half the screen did grey out for a second. Im going to guess your system/codec/player had a bigger issue with those glitches than mine did. Later in the show they went away."

Anyone having trouble with these FoV 720p releases of Doctor Who, go get the newest CCCP 7-30-2011.
I was using the 9-9-09 pack and it just wouldn't play but this fixed it."
,RedSuperKilla,2011-09-13T13:05Z,"* NOT WORKING ON POPCORN HOUR DEVICES *

Since several weeks, any FOV-torrent of Doctor Who episodes, will not work on my up-to-date Popcorn Hour C200 (= Networked Media Tank with Syabas SW). It will not play or it even chokes up the entire device (HW restart needed)...

Does anyone know why this is?
Is FOV using another incompatible Codec, EZTV?

Thanks for any feedback!
And for the upload too, of course."
