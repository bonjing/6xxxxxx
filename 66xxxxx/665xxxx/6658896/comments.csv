,ZtorkX86,2011-09-07T22:34Z,I just started and it started steam. Thanks for this!
,ZtorkX86,2011-09-07T22:37Z,"Eh? Avast detected: Win32:Crypt-JQQ [Trj]

I couldn't even upload the file at VirusTotal. Anyone else tried it?"
,shuggeeman,2011-09-07T23:12Z,"It's virus free, but it's a VERY bad crack, even on lowest settings i get 11 FPS at most. I downloaded the game from steam instead and i got 60+ FPS atm."
[T],Distrance,2011-09-07T23:13Z,"Huh? Why would you need a crack for a DEMO. Steam is free, so are DEMOS."
,ZtorkX86,2011-09-07T23:57Z,"shuggeeman@ Same here.

Distrance@ It's to bypass Steam, without it it will start steam client if you have it installed."
,xidio,2011-09-08T00:14Z,"Haha this is just sad.
Cracking demos.

LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL"
,xidio,2011-09-08T00:15Z,"Ztork..
Why would you want to bypass steam with a legit fucking demo? "
