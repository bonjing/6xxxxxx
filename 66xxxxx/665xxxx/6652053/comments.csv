Bring on the BONUS MATERIALS!"
,User897,2011-09-06T04:18Z,"Since this is sourced from the Blu-ray, it is important to list the correct year for this film.

This is the 2011 version, NOT the 1977 version."
,lastjedi,2011-09-16T18:13Z,i highly doubt this is a blu ray disc rip since the blu ray discs just came out today.plus if this comes from the blu ray discs wouldn't this have the deleted scenes and behind the scenes footage that comes with the blu ray releases.so that is the proof right there that this doesn't come from the blu ray disc release.
