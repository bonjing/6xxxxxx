Impulse of the Moment - DJ Noriken

Nice compilation album, Noriken has laid the framework for this album, and had a few of the better-known J-Core artists add their own flavors into it. End-result: the album is a success. While not god-tier, it's pretty fun album to run through. By far and away, my favorite song from the album is the title track, "Impulse of the Moment" is some weird blend of happy hardcore, trance, and throw in some random but effective mixing.

If you like Noriken, happy-hardcore, or want a positive album for your day, see if it fits your tastes.
