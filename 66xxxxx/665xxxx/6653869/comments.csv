,rock_drummer08,2011-09-08T02:23Z,Can you please reseed this torrent? This is the only one that has series 9!
,Bl4ckz,2011-09-08T15:04Z,"Yes i will, but my PC is not 24/7 online.."
,Meukz0r,2011-09-20T15:35Z,"Dudes...I've got a pretty decent no-limits 24/7 100MBit fibre connection, so I don't mind sharing.

But I've uploaded 365GB on this torrent in 5 days, and yet, when I look at the peerlist, I don't see other peers with 100%. 

To promote seeding, I've decided to add any peer that reaches 60% complete to my banlist for this torrent."
,Bl4ckz,2011-09-20T19:31Z,"Thank you for seeding. I've uploaded 340GB so far, i hope we get more Seeders!"
,Meukz0r,2011-09-20T20:46Z,"Wheeler Dealers is cool!

I will keep on seeding this for a while, don't worry :)

Komt goed!"
,rob90991,2011-11-24T08:57Z,this release is seriously mislabeled on series numbers check here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeler_Dealers
,rob90991,2011-11-24T09:41Z,"@Bl4ckz allyou have done is downloaded my release: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6294692/Wheeler.Dealers.Series.1-7-rob9099 and renamed them to the wrong series names, well done!"
,Bl4ckz,2011-11-28T21:35Z,"This one also includes 8, and 9!"
,rob90991,2011-11-29T07:49Z,"no, what you have renemed series 8 and 9 are really series 7 check here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeler_Dealers"
,thufir,2012-01-08T17:45Z,"Would love some more seeding power on this one, When i first started downloading it, someone was seeding with a 2mb/s connection, but quickly stopped again, which i think is lame, im seeding with a 100/100mbit connection myself, and atleast to 1:1.. Cmon lads! :)"
,shahne,2012-01-15T03:07Z,I will reseed aswell.
,spudmudcrud,2012-03-17T12:12Z,"Fantastic, role on season 10"
,snaarky,2012-03-22T11:30Z,Everyone listen to rob90991... this is NOT series 9. 
,aratarUK,2012-04-24T17:50Z,"Just to confirm, this is Series 1-7 ONLY."
