Sorry tricklisted, but I believe that's how the official english dubs were made.  I remember watching it on TV and thinking the same thing you said!  Even in mandarin (which I don't speak), I believed that the movie WAS made to be a bit ""cartoonish"" in its dialogue and expressions.
So as far as I know, the english dubs ARE the original ones, but I definitly agree with Noshkanok: I WOULD like to get the mandarin version with english subs!  :-)
Cheers all!"
