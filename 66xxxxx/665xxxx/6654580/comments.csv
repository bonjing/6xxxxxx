,ishenly,2011-09-07T07:29Z,"Hi man (men), all OK with patcher, but, when ending patching, and going to create a license file, then providing data, after put number of users of licensing, the console application crashs and (windows) show the error msg.

With this, have created an license file (.xml), but it is incomplete (because the crash), and when import from SmartFTP, not work.

I find a solution: Having an old license (.xml) file,   I open in a text editor the licenses, then copy that part saying 'maintenance' and 'issue' from old to new file. And, in the new file closing the correspondent label (  ), then saving. Then registry inside SmartFTP and OK!. XD."

1 = multiple users"
