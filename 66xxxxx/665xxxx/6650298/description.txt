Release Notes:

The French have given us fine wine and fine food, but rarely fine
music.

Try as they might, the French music industry remains hopelessly insular despite the attempts of the electro house scene to ignite the nation's dancefloors.

Hailing from the land across the channel, John & Jehn manage to combine dark indie rock with something deeply French. Lingering traces of the language appear in their vocals, while the duo's moody image is derived from Godard & Co.

Releasing their debut album in 2008, John & Jehn proved that they are more than just a regional phenomenon. Taking time off to craft a follow up, the duo are now ready to showcase the results.
