,baconninja,2011-09-07T16:29Z,Thanks! I thought SS run on detective was great but then really stumbled at the end. But gonna give him another chance. 
,baconninja,2011-09-07T16:42Z,Wow that sucked. Thanks for the up though!!!
,himen23,2011-09-07T16:52Z,and? How is it? Is it good? or Tony Daniel sucks in Det Comics?
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-09-07T16:58Z,"Well, I felt Action Comics and Stormwatch sucked even harder."
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-07T17:27Z,"This is the first one Ive read - not a fan. After how amazing the pre-relaunch DC stories were, this is just not right... :("
,Fulcrum_X,2011-09-07T18:09Z,"creepy 1st issue. good opening salvo for detective comics. can't say the same for action comics. they made superman like superboy, almost like a teenager. "
,himen23,2011-09-07T18:15Z,"@GunningHawk90
Well... I was waiting to buy it (Im a HUGE batman fan) but I will download it to see if it's worth the buy ... and YES, Action Comics sucked a big fat 100 inches dick... I hated it... Since it was Grant Morrison I had hope, now I don't.

@MrDowntown
Scott Snyder's run on Detective Comics was amazing... I really hope he does a good job in Batman #1 I REALLY HOPE FOR IT...

[V],GunningHawk90,2011-09-07T18:38Z,"It may improve, but this particular issue is not worth buying."
,dtz247,2011-09-07T21:57Z,"Thank you so much for the upload. When you're on the other side of the planet (South Korea), there's no other way in hell to get these. You're a life saver."
,dtz247,2011-09-07T21:59Z,... I only wish I could get a hard copy
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-08T00:29Z,"@dtz247 - You're the reason we do it. And how most of these comics are turning out, be glad you havent paid for them and can pick and choose when you get a chance to buy physical issues"
,Hank89,2011-09-10T19:08Z,anyone else see the mystery woman from flashpoint 5. she's in every number 1 so far
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-09-13T08:38Z,And she's gonna be there in all the 52 issues.
,leapfrogEE,2011-09-18T02:47Z,what software do i need to read these comics?
,finisher489,2011-10-30T15:43Z,@leapfrogEE you need CDisplay to run this
,stijr,2011-12-27T18:54Z,thanks !
