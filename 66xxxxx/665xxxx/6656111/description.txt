Harry's Arctic Heroes

Travel Documentary hosted by John Hurt, published by BBC in 2011 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Prince Harry joins a group of British soldiers in their attempt to make the first unsupported trek to the North Pole by wounded servicemen, on a charity expedition that has garnered support from everyone from photographer David Bailey to the Prime Minister. Narrated by John Hurt, this documentary follows the team in a year of training and planning that ends deep in the Arctic Circle, where Prince Harry joins his fellow servicemen in their final preparations for an expedition that would challenge an able-bodied explorer, let alone those severely wounded on active service in Afghanistan. These young men are determined to reach the top of the world to highlight the plight of the seventeen-hundred-plus service personnel injured in Afghanistan since the conflict began.
