I was asked if I had any Timson readings and at one time I had them all but I never rated them much personally so I deleted them. I've had a little look here and there today and came up with these so I thought I'd upload them as a lot of people do rate Timson. I'll continue my search to see if I can find more. I've found one of the novels, The Sign Of Four, and I'm just listening to it to make sure it's OK. If it is then I'll upload it soon.
