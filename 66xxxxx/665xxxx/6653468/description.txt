Release Note: 'The Sound of Garuda: Chapter 2' is a gripping new club-facing mix comp, which captures the audio spirit and energy of the UK's no.1 DJ: Gareth Emery.

The album follows on the heels of the success of Northern Lights - his acclaimed debut artist album (which displaced Deadmau5 to claim the #1 spot on the US iTunes Dance chart). The second Sound of Garuda again places the leading-edge sound of Emery's illustrious label centre-stage and is unique in that each and every track comes as a never-heard-before exclusive. It also includes two brand new productions from Gareth himself.
