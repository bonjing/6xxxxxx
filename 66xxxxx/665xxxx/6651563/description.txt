http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070518/
User Rating: 7.3/10

This file is from the 1988 Turner Preview version of the film (Disc 2 in the DVD set).
It is the closest to a true director\\\'s cut that is available.
This is not the [shorter] 2005 Special Edition. That version is available for download elsewhere. 

For more information about the different editions of this film, I would suggest you read it\\\'s Wikipedia page, as well as the source links at the bottom of the Wikipedia page.
