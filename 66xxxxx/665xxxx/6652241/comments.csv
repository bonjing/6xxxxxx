,Ashleynin,2011-09-05T08:44Z,"I should say, thanks to goldene_note for reminding me of that 'Lostgirl' tv show, i totally forgot about that one !!"
,tyler453,2011-09-05T11:05Z,"thanks for the tvrage link,
i really hope uploaders started putting those in their info boxes more often.
i mean, how am i supposed to know about a show if i'm not from the U.S.

adding a tvrage link is not that much work if you're already taking the time to upload the torrent.

PLEASE, UPLOADERS, ADD TVRAGE LINKS!

thank You to everybody!"
