[T],metalcore.,2011-09-06T05:43Z,this seems to be the CUT Danish version 34 minutes shorter than the uncut version.
,Toxic7777,2011-09-07T13:11Z,"Its the original version made by Sami Saif in 2000.
Theres another version(with the same name) that has extra footage made by some random guy about 3 years ago but its not very good imo.Terrible editing"
,blackestsheep,2012-02-01T03:54Z,"this is about a 2 hr video  of  richardo lopez
it is on an iso disc  and can be played w media players like km player or gom player etc
right click to open the iso file, then find the yellow audio  and yellow video files..then drag these into the media player just like you would a regular movie
this DOES NOT  include his suicide at the end
it is in english  but does have subtitles hard coded on the movie..it is totally watchable and fine
i think the subtitles are danish 

thanks for the upload this is hard to find"
