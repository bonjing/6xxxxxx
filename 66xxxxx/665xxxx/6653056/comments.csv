,rgmontejo,2011-09-05T15:10Z,Is this the blu ray release?
,turbo_dude555,2011-09-06T01:06Z,"@rgmontejo

No it's not bluray. As you can see the bluray box in the image and the 1080p description. Clearly this MUST be a dvdrip.....some people should really not be allowed to have children"
,thegreatgabbo,2011-09-06T05:41Z,is liam neeson in episode III?
,rcr29budcar,2011-09-06T07:09Z,"Turbo Dude, have you watched them to verify they're fake or not? Can someone verify?  I'm downloading but its slow.  You can tell if its real or not by Yoda in Ep. I.  The new ones have a CGI Yoda that looks more like the one in Ep. II and III while the old ones have a puppet Yoda that looks different in Ep. I.  And I don't need an opinion on if its the blu rays or not. Just because its not released in retail stores doesn't mean shit!  And if no one verifies by the time I get it downloaded i'll let everyone know.  Thanks."

,ManuelRivero,2011-09-07T03:25Z,Q[mi5]: Thx for the comparison shots. Looks like they improved EP I a lot. I remember it being quite murky at the theater. Probably because most scenes were shot in 35mm while others (the ones with more greenscreen effects?) were in early digital (
[T],zeromancer,2011-09-07T19:52Z,The Phantom Menace doesnt look all that good. Is this really the blu ray rips?

,JB0RQ,2011-09-08T06:45Z,Very tempting indeed.
[T],zeromancer,2011-09-08T18:19Z,@liquidmonkey: I honestly dont know. But the Jabba the hut scene in A new Hope doesnt has hardcoded sub. Guessing it got a seperate subtitle track.
[T],zeromancer,2011-09-08T18:20Z,Implemented subtitle track I mean.
[T],zeromancer,2011-09-08T18:22Z,"I take back what I said about The Phantom Menace. Judging by the sample file, it looks great."
,rcr29budcar,2011-09-08T20:42Z,"What do any of you guys use to burn .mkv files to dvd? I've tried allot of different programs to convert the files and to burn them to dvd's and for some reason or another they never work.  I have no problem burning .avi files, but no matter what I try, I can't seem to have any luck with .mkv files. Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you very much in advance."
,rcr29budcar,2011-09-08T20:48Z,"Correction,  I can burn them to a dvd disc, but the format isn't compatible on the dvd player or xbox360.  Can someone help me out with this. Thanks."
,mosmooth,2011-09-09T18:46Z,"@rcr29budcar - 

1.A DVD player is totally different technology to a BluRay player.

2.These are HDMI output files so ditto (above.)

You could only hook up a Popcorn Hour or similar to play any files above 4GB (that is the limit of your XBox 360 file size thus ditto (above.)

Simply put-get a Popcorn Hour or later and spend some cash getting good equipment (a good TV/Home Cinema Amp etc.)

I love big files, and many thanks to CHD for the original and Bozx for making them available here for these two great ups ( the 1977-1983 films are on Bozx's other Star Wars torrent (CHD's original) here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6640920/Star.Wars.1977-1983.BluRay.1080p.DTS-ES.x264-CHD)"

,onicon,2011-09-09T22:55Z,No subs whatsoever. Anyone has a source?
,bigdrago,2011-09-09T23:00Z,Hmmm. This is to be released September 16... so it can't be real. http://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Complete-Episodes-Blu-ray/dp/B003ZSJ212/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1315601871&sr=8-2

I watch sample of each episode,only episode 4 and 6 seem to be good other than that they are not far from standard DVD especially racing scene on episode 1"

As is THUGLiNE and AMIABLE by the way."
,arkhanrj,2011-09-11T19:08Z,any comments on quality?
,mosmooth,2011-09-12T01:00Z,"@The whingers-
Those who have bleated about it not being BluRay, being doubtful as it is not yet released and that the samples are no better than DVD-you are all morons.

Many films uploaded are leaked by those working in production studios and 13 GBs is not ""little better than DVD quality."" And with DTS-ES as the audio track-is that poor quality audio too?

One whinger (bigdrago) has no torrents and I suspect he works for Lucasfilm and posts fake comments to dissuade people (doesn't work idiot-this already has 300+seeds, 2000+ peers.)"
,hennycare,2011-09-12T11:09Z,"@bigdrago This came out in the uk at midnight, check the amazon.co.uk site. You realise you yanks don't always get stuff first, just usually..."
,cannonsoft,2011-09-12T18:09Z,NICE ONE 
,QuantiumG,2011-09-13T18:44Z,"Thanks for the upload.  Unfortunately, it's only running at 40-75Kb/s, so it'll probably take you like a week to finish the download.  It'll be in stores before that.  "
,xcaliboy,2011-09-14T20:49Z,"Thank you BOZX....I wish more people would seed...this is gonna take FOREVER...not complaining, just stating a fact...so if you are downloading these, please SEED with more KB's...nearly been downloading for 24 hours and still less than 11%"
,kon_klink,2011-09-14T23:16Z,I just spent the last three days dl the torrent and when I look at the files after it says the torrent is complete but only the samples have actually downloaded?  The .mkv files that contain the actual movie appear to be empty at 0bytes ... what have I done wrong?  Sorry if this is a noob question but I'm really worried about all the bandwidth I just wasted!
,mosmooth,2011-09-15T23:31Z,"@kon_klink - You clearly only downloaded the sample files and skipped the actual fims. I never dl the .nfo, smaple or anything EXCEPT the film files (why waste the electric/hd space/bandwidth?)

You had better go into your downloded file folder (whilst downloading on your torrent engine) e.g. in utorrent click on the torrent, go to ""files"" on the lower toolbar and then, at the far right it states ""priority""-left click it with your mouse and it'll show options- you chose ""skip"" so now change that to ""normal priority"" and you will see the film start downloading (again.) Do this for all the films and wait a week-you'll have them all then.

By the way, did you not wonder why you upped them all in a day and the files were only showing about 100 Megabytes file size?

Doh!"
,mosmooth,2011-09-15T23:32Z,"sic-""sample"" not ""smaple"""
,mosmooth,2011-09-15T23:39Z,"sic-""sample"" not ""smaple""

The Doh! must be infectious. By the way kon_klink-if it took you 3 days to dl 300mbs, you will have the films in 358 days (35,880 Megabytes divided by 33 Megabytes a day) before you will watch this-the next version will be out by then!"
,mosmooth,2011-09-15T23:53Z,"Correction: I mistook the 100 Mbs for the 33 a day-it will thus be 1,087 days and 6 hours before you watch them-or just shy of 3 years.

Multiple Doh!s "

Kon, i would continue asking for help and googling etc.. as i have seen this exact problem before in comments, and i know they found the answer, and DID NOT have to re-download... i cant remember the answe, but good luck"

,wengy78,2011-10-10T01:10Z,"I downloaded Episode III from this torrent first, it took over a week as the file was over 12GB. When I finished downloading it, I went to play it and the file was empty. The sample downloaded but the actual movie file had zero bytes size. So thinking something went wrong, I deleted the file (note, when I deleted it asked me if it could delete it permanently as the file was too big, as though there actually was 12GB in the folder) 

I then downloaded the entire torrent, all 35GB of it, and got the same issue. All the samples are there, but the actual .mkv movie files all show as having zero bytes filesize. 

I download a lot of torrents and I've never encountered this issue before. Anyone know what's up??

I see from the comments that someone else had this same issue with this torrent as well. "
,pinnace,2011-11-25T12:14Z,"@wengy78

this is because of the long file names. try copying the downloaded root directory of this torrent to any location. it should copy the files like starwa~1.mkv etc. it worked for me."
