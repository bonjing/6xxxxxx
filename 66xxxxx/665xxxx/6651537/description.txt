I bought this album after reading a great review of it in The Observer, I did a bit more research and was intrigued by all the great press and reactions from the fans that James gets as I have never heard of him before. He is from Manchester, UK but now lives in Prague, Czech Republic. This album is truly very different from what the market offers these days. But not different in the way that would make it â€œunlistenable", quite the opposite. The album contains thirteen songs and it won't be an exaggeration when I say that they all are absolutely brilliant. They all feature amazing vocals, very clever lyrics (you feel you could have written some of them yourself â€“ even though you probably couldn't...) and interesting guitar playing â€“ both acoustic and electric. What I really like about the lyrics is that there are almost like poems, there are many different ways of how to interpret them. I have tried asking my friends about their understanding of the songs and it was interesting to hear so many different views.

The album was released by what seems like a small independent label. (Dekkor Records).

The cover and the booklet: interesting piece of art work by Paul Wilson, try to study the picture for a few minutes and you will see a lot of different things â€¦The booklet is very simple and does not contain any lyrics which I am sure some fans will miss. But if you put the CD on, I donâ€™t think you will be interested in reading the usual small print lyrics anyway.

Now the musicians:
