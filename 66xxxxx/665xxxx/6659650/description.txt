"The way her shadow used to walk by your side,

In the symbology of Lekman's songbook, motion is a means to stave off insanity or succumb to it and the songs on An Argument With Myself EP deal with many types of movement, both big and small, from why he moved to Melbourne to the societal change/movement in his old hometown of Gothenburg to simple map directions. With more fractured textures that combine horns, flutes, string swells and arpeggiated guitars, the opening of the EP finds Jens in constant state of transition, musically, as well.
