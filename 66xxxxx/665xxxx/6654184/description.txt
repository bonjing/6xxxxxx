Release Notes....: After CRiMSON's embarrassment of a release last week, I thought a quality group should do Project Runway this 
                   week. Their explanation for a ridiculous amount of glitches in their release is that "it is enbeaded into the 
                   stream and could not be avoided" (it's spelled "embedded", FYI). Yeah, that's a load of bullshit. This is 
                   when you would record the reair. If they had capped this from a digital source (which is required) it would 
                   have been nearly impossible to maintain sync. Not only was the release riddled with errors, the standard 
                   crappy CRiMSON deinterlacing was noticeable throughout. Here are a couple examples
                   They are lucky that Lifetime does not reair full-length episodes or they would be propered in a heartbeat. If 
                   that's not enough, if you look at the waveform of their mp3 you'll notice that during the drops in audio 
                   there is still a waveform present. The waveform of a drop from a digital source is a straight line - no audio, 
                   hence the word "drop". I'm no expert on the matter and I could be wrong, but this would lead me to believe 
                   that not only is their video from an analog source, their audio is also. Maybe this is why they don't pre any 
                   720ps. CRiMSON, you should pre some source proof just for the hell of it and show everyone that you're legit.
