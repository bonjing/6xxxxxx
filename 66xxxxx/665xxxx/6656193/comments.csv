This update is to be applied with the original crack. The original crack has a folder in it named out. Within that folder are two folders named profiles and save. This is where your saves will go. Without these folders you will not get your save! Copy them over, or create them, as they are originally empty. Good luck, and I hope this helps."

If you previously installed it without running as the admin then an invisible folder is still taking up space on your HDD. Download MagicISO, in the file directory tree in MagicISO you will see the duplicate install folder and you can right click and delete them through MagicISO.

Step 1: Download this torrent (my version is actually the ali one but i presume they are the same thing)
Step 2: Download ""Dead Island.Crack Update - RELOADED"" (found by searching ""dead island"" on piratebay)
Step 3: SEED FOR DAYS
Step 4: Install the game (the one in this torrent) by clicking the one that says ""dead island"" it should have application written next to it.
Step 5: The installer is not in english (the game is though) so simply just hit next next next etc as you would normally install a game. The one you want to click is the highlighted one each time. 
Step 6: Copy all the data from the other torrent into the main directory which unless changed should be C: > Game > Dead island. You'll know if it's the right place because the files you are copying will be the same ones as the ones in your Dead island (game installation) folder.
Step 7: You will have to create new folders in order to be able to save your game, to do this go to c: > Game > Dead island and in that directory (the one where you copied the reloaded update to) Create two new folders ""Save"" and ""Profiles"". 
Step 8: Launch the game and have fun
Step 9: for some reason when i went to run it after all that, it crashed when trying to load the game, instead i ran the shortcut that opens after installing the game and it then worked fine and after that i could run the game from the folder, if anyone has any questions at all, i'll try and do my best to help, though i'm a bit of a noob at this stuff to be honest. I hope everyone enjoys this game and make sure you seed guys. Not everyone is in the position to be able to but if you have unlimited internet and you don't have to pay extra, then seed like crazy, because after all your not online gaming with this game so it's either seed and help out or have your internet doing nothing

4. Use Update1-RELOADED in the same folder as above, overwriting when necessary. Your installation folder should now contain DI, Redist, out, some DLLs, txts, vdfs and the executable.

If you cannot do this, open Notepad.exe first
Open a file from within Notepad.exe, search for All Files
Navigate again to the video.scr file in the Dead Island directory

Once you have this file open, change the following.

""Fullscreen()"" to ""Fullscreen(1)""
""Monitor(0)"" to ""Monitor(-1)""

Save your changes, and run the game again, you should now be good!

For those who do not get to work.

Mount or burn the iso file.
Got to the mounted or burned dvd, and select steambackup2, select the folder you want to install it to (i sugest a temp folder and copy the directory created in the temp folder to the location you want it to have).
Do not use setup or any other programm.
Once done copy the content in the crack folder (on the mounted or  burned dvd) into the folder created by steambackup2 overwrite everything when asked for.

Thats it, ow and for windows7 x64 users i sugest to create a chortcut of the crack and change the properties settings tab campatibility service speck 2 for xp and mark option run as administrator/ apply and close run the game, on the background you get a popup, either allow it or not, close the programm by killing it, and start it again, presto it works.

GIBBERISH FIX:

1. Install Dead Island.

I use MagicISO to open it.

click on the icon that extracts it, a pop up will appear, click on the folder you have created (oxoxox) it will extact it to this folder.

when done go to that folder and open, click on the steambackup2 icon 2 pop ups appear,

go to (browse to folder) pop up, now find your folder (oxoxox) and click ok.

(the other pop up starts to extract the program)

On the screen right click and make new folder, call it oxoxox or what ever.
go to your down load folder and open, you should see a disc, double click on it, it will open it up on your iso program,

I use MagicISO to open it.

click on the icon that extracts it, a pop up will appear, click on the folder you have created (oxoxox) it will extact it to this folder.

when done go to that folder and open, click on the steambackup2 icon 2 pop ups appear,

go to (browse to folder) pop up, now find your folder (oxoxox) and click ok.

(the other pop up starts to extract the program)  


now a new folder appears (Dead Island) when finished loading cut and paste all the files in your oxoxox folder to 

the (Dead Island) folder. NOT THE CRACK FOLDER.

Open the crack folder and cut and paste the files to (Dead Island) folder

Now click on the deadislandgame icon and start to play

The ""Documents/DeadIsland/DI/Out/Settings"" location doesnt apply to us who torrented the game, that only applies to legit steam users as the location was changed when they got patched, patching our torrented copy to the update1-reloaded doesnt seem to change the config files location.

You can can find the file that needs to be edited ""Video.scr"" in the installation directory ""Game/Dead Island/DI/Out/Settings"". The file is a screensaver file (weird i know), so youl have to open notepad first and then drag video.scr into it then change whatever settings you want to change (dont forget to save changes after). Just make sure to set the file to ""Read-Only"" so the game doesnt revert the settings back to default when launched, how you do this is by rightclicking the file > properties > check box ""set to read-only"" > apply.

""DisplayDeviceType(0,0.000000,1.000000,1.000000,1.000000)""

Do not overrite this line because it pretty much tells the game what video card you have, and well if you copy MY DisplayDeviceType settings over to yours and we dont have the same video card, then the games gonna crash, so dont copy that line over.


Also you can set this line to ""4096"", it gives you higher resolution shadows

Some people sadly cannot use it as the game crashes, it has nothing to do with how much videoram (VRAM) your video card has, the setting is just picky. I have 2 GTX580's in sli, 1.5GB each and i crash when trying to use 4096. You can try but if you crash then i guess your not lucky like me.

,cyborg34573,2011-09-08T15:54Z,"Btw people, make sure you turn on vsync to cap your fps based on your monitors Hz, the reason i suggest this is because the game is not demanding at all, your fps will fly thru the roof stressing your video card causing it to overheat. Most video cards will handle the stress fine, they may run hotter than usual but nothing high enough to destroy the card, but some cards out there run hot to begin with, and if you dont have vsync on letting your framerate go wild, you will overheat your videocard.

Now setting vsync on in this release (With the patch applied) will cause you to stutter, to fix this just basicaly get a backup of the original ""DeadIslandGame.exe"" file , the one thats there before the patch, then after the patch replace the new executable that the patch applies with the original one that you backed up. Viola, stuttering gone."

No you do not move the ""Out"" folder thats inside DI to DeadIsland folder. You leave that folder alone and you make another one in DeadIsland Folder. So its pretty much ""DeadIsland/Out/"" at this point, then you create two folders inside Out folder, ""Save"" and ""Profiles"", so now its
""DeadIsland/Out/Save""
""DeadIsland/Out/Profiles""
(same location, two folders inside the Out folder)

Leave the Out folder inside DI alone.

3. then set the game(deadislandgame.exe) to run as administrator and you're set.. providing you're running 7 anywho, and if not, well you can figure it out on your own, can't be too complicated.
If you're having issues, try reloaded's crack fix at  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6656242/Dead_Island.Crack_Update_-_RELOADED
And if that doesn't work, update your software and drivers, or if that still doesn't work, update your gaming rig ;]

PS. THIS ^ is how a comment is supposed to be, especially if you're whining the game(or torrent) isn't working for some reason or another, ESPECIALLY if it's 'laggy' or 'slow' or w/e. (there's only one reason to not post your specs..think about it)
If it's really that much of a hassle, type your specs down in notepad or w/e text program you're using, and save it in your docs or somewhere easy to access, then copy and paste it. There is no excuse for laziness ;]"

1. mount the disk image using DAEMON tools lite
2. a popup will appear and select to run steambackup2 (or something like that)
3. installer appears (along with its music lol) and choose where to install the game, i went to c:/program files, it should create a dead island folder in there and install.
4. for me the first time i installed it the dead island folder didn't appear, but then windows immediately asked me if it had been installed correctly (a popup) and i chose to reinstall using the recommended settings and it worked.
5. go to the original disk image and open it using winrar.
6. you'll see a folder in there called 'Crack' extract/copy everything in that folder and paste it into wherever dead island installed, for me c:/program files/dead island (windows will ask permission to do this, allow it)
7. in this folder you'll now see an application called 'deadislandgame' (one of the cracked files you copied) double click and run this, a popup may appear saying you dont have permission to write to this folder, if so then right click the application and select run as administrator, the game should startup just fine.

A lot of ""apps"" as you mac users love to call them don't work with wine.  Most of the games coming out these days do work but the release here from RELOADED is the first release.  That being said, it was not the version that techland wanted to release, it was the beta version (for lack of a better term)  This is most likely why it will not work with Wine on MacOSX

For those of you wanting to know what the game is like:
Think Fallout/FO: New Vegas meets Left 4 Dead meets Dead Rising.  It's fun so far but i've only been an hour in.  with my low time involved so far I give it an 8 out of 10.

,call_me_nobody,2011-09-08T23:27Z,"Dead Island: Deep Silver apologises for 'incorrect version' released
US copies to be fixed 'ASAP', other territories will get full patched version on Friday
Share this  +
Comments 5
Deep Silver has issued a full statement in response to disastrous - but quite funny - releasing of a development build of Dead Island on Steam today.

""We deeply regret that an incorrect version of Dead Island was inadvertently made available to players on Steam launch in North America,"" confirms Deep Silver, after gamers noticed several glaring issues with the build they downloaded, including the ability to turn off clipping and essentially fly through walls and around the game world. 

It's also widely reported that the version released contains hints elements of what appear to be the Xbox build. Lol.

Deep Silver adds: ""We are very sorry for any issues you may have experienced while playing the game-the correct, patched version will be made available to North American players ASAP. Other territories are not affected by this situation. The fully patched game will be available on Friday as announced.""

But 'fully patch', we assume it means that EU versions will come with the massive 37-bulletpoint fix patch will be pre-applied before release. That would be nice.

Dont choose the chick specializing in gun, it's pretty much pointless since there like no guns.. And if you get one there's no ammo.. The quests are boring as nuts..

But a lot of us download these games because we know we're most likely going to get the shaft with another shitty console port, or just a shit game in general. End up playing a day or 2 and then its uninstalled.. And such saved $60 for more important things like booze and hookers..

Developers should take us pirating as a good thing, that games coming out are soo bad that we don't even get excited enough to buy it.. Example: Blizzard.. Diablo 3, trusted developer, they do great work on EVERY game.. Guaranteed buy on launch.. Valve, HL:E3, trusted, great work (on the most part) definitely don't rush main titles, guaranteed buy on launch (whenever that might be...) Other companies should take the same path to not rush a turd out there ass when it will hurt them.. But most companies don't give a shit and just like to cater to the retards with controllers mashing there buttons and screaming in there mics...  But it's fine :) I like my growing smaller PC community. "

So I was like screw it, let's just start over, different class. Played till level 25, just finished the final part of Act 1, game crashed, reset to level 2 -again-, can resume at chapter 4 at level 3. same story.

not too hard, like common if you cant figure this out you shouldn't be pirating games.

,TalonH,2011-09-09T06:31Z,"Ignore my previous comment, the torrent is fine.

Just make sure you install the steambackup2 thing, install the updated directx, the distributable, copy the crack and such to the install directory, start it up once, get the update 1, replace the update 1 files into the install directory.

Bang, you should be golden and all the text fixed."
,Sivos,2011-09-09T06:35Z,"Okay, those of you who are having the problem with the missing _x86 file, here is what you do.

1:  Use the steambackup.exe to install it to your desktop (easier this way).

2:  Take the Dead Island folder and move it to C:/Program Files(x86)/Steam/Steamapps/common  (if you don't have a common folder, make one).

3:  Copy the crack into the folder C:/Program Files(x86)/Steam/Steamapps/common/Dead Island/  after that, the game should run fine.

If you don't have a Steam folder, download Steam and make an account there, sorry but you have to.

If you have any questions, I won't be back to answer them, so you're on your own.  I tried using the Update 1 on TPB, but the file just turned my game into another language so I don't really care too much to figure out why right now, I'll do it later.  Also, if you disobey my instructions to put the file on your desktop first and are concerned why in the world it won't install in other places you decided to put it, just run the steambackup.exe in Administrator and all shall be fine.

Happy gaming :D"

The director of the CIA at the time, George W. Bush, then approached him and tore out biohazardfroggies intestines to see if his powers didn't only affect his teeth. sadly, they did. the next morning at 4:20 AM biohazardfroggie died from blood loss.

Quit - Play - New Game.
Just let it load then at the first checkpoint I Quitted - Exited Game. Restarted Game. The character I first played with disapeared.

So.. I guess you shouldn't try to make a new character and just stick with the one you picked untill you are done with it."

1) Go to Dead Island\out\save folder

3) Rename the save with the highest number (save_2.sav in this case) into save_0.sav. Rename the existing one.
4) Play the game again without having to start from scratch!

Works for me at least. "

In the main 'dead island' folder, make a folder named 'Out'. Inside that folder create 2 folders, named 'Save' and﻿ 'Profiles'.

Start your game and get to a point to where the game saves, exit or restart it and you should see the Continue button lit up now. Hope that helps!""

,DemonX112,2011-09-10T03:04Z,"!!!READ HERE FOR SAVE AND OTHER STUFF!!!

Save Game - Go to your Dead Island install directory, and simply create a folder and name it ""out"" After that is done, go in to the folder, and create two more folders. Name one ""profiles"" and the other ""save"" Once you create a game, it will save.

Install without key-code - This is simple. Once you have copied it to a disc or have used it in your iso mount program of choice, either wait for the autoplay, or go to My Computer, and find your drive image, right click it, and hit ""Autoplay"" The Reloaded installer should be then open up.

Also, anyone playing this on a monitor that is bigger than 20"", the FOV is terrible. It's set at around 90. So playing it on 1920 x 1080 makes everything look much too close, and can cause nausea and motion sickness to some people.

The quest trackers disable themselves sometimes upon updating certain quests. For instance, when getting the flares for Trevor. It will tell you to return to him (top of lighthouse) but wont set a marker up for him.

I recommend anyone downloading this for the first time, to also download the ""RELOADED Update 1"" to fix some errors in the game. If you decide to get it later after playing for hours on end, then you will realize that you just lost your save, and have to start again."

The whole setup is a STEAM set up and since I'm an avid gamer, it recognizes my account and requires a CD KEY. Also, if I run Steambackup2 this happens: The image file C:\Program Files(x86)\Symantec\Symantex Endpoint Protection\SnacNp64.dll is valid, but is for A MACHINE TYPE other than the CURRENT MACHINE. select OK to continue or CANCEL to fail the DLL load. So I click OK and it shuts the fuck down. (steambackup2.exe has stopped working.) So my question is, what the hell do you do? There is no reloaded installer as far as I can see and there is no keygen or key. What do?"

I found that the save file is in your steam userdata and there is an out folder in there with the profile and save. It looks like when we update, the game updates but it then can no longer read the save from the previous version. Not sure how to correct this.

Don't know what people are talking about it worked perfectly for me! What I did was:

1. Mount the iso in daemon tools
 2. Create a folder called 'Dead Island' in program files
 3. Run steambackup AS ADMINISTRATOR
 4. Choose your folder and click next
 5. Copy all the files from the crack folder on the mounted iso to your Dead Island folder
 6. Click 'deadislandgame'
 7. ???
 8. Fuckin' bingo

Don't know what people are complaining about, it saves for me and it even posts my achievements to facebook, YES FUCKING FACEBOOK.

The only problem is if you press Y on your keyboard you noclip but that's really not much of a problem.

The routine has become pretty routine and it really hasn't changed over the last decade.

1) Download the ISO
2) Mount it with Daemon Tools
3) Install the game.
4) Install the crack from the CRACK folder to the installation directory.
5) Play.

If you ever have any doubts, just consult to the NFO file included in the archive. There's ALWAYS one unless it's a fake.

If the game is working fine, don't bother updating. Ever. Usually it just causes problems."

Warhammer 40K has no known bugs, the story is strong and emotional, you get to kill a shitload of orcs with a chainsaw, and the graphics and surroundings are outstanding - and so is the sound.

And another thing, there is nothing funnier than watching a computer nerd think he is hot shit and pretend that they don't want to help out noobs and try to show off their computer knowledge.

Works great! Install was flawless. The game itself is fun and the custom modding is interesting. Guns seem underpowered though but I suppose that would rob the game of it's mechanics if you could kill everything with 3 bullets.

Oh and it's very easy to get the XP and Cash using Cheat Engine, just for laughs.

@EscadaRule The right answer wouldn't been download that .dll, but just extract all files from .iso file to folder and reinstall game again. I had the same problem, but when i did like that, worked fine.

@Crueljoker007 @Brunchies Game saves only when you cross a checkpoint. Game gives you a little notice for a checkpoint at the text box, usually when you complete a chapter or finish to watch a cut scene you cross a checkpoint.

@ s7raker You've downloaded a .dll where all achievements has been done. Try other .dll, but I'm not sure which .dll it is.

Game just decided to wipe my saves. Been playing for 4 days now and got to level 40-ish. I was going to purchase the game but then this happens.

Glad I was able to try it, would've wasted my money. Not saying it's a bad game but has a lot of bugs. HAVE NOT applied NEW PATCH yet and still the save gets corrupted/wiped. Oh well.
Not worth re-doing all the fetch me X items quests and leveling. Lost all my inventory and cash too. Very stupid save system too. Just autosaves on one slot and no manual saving.

Thanks again Extremezone. Happy to be able to ""try"" these games before I buy them."

,Jeepster1,2011-09-17T13:41Z,"To everyone having problems - Game itself v1 works perfectly in native windows (not in VM) with no problems.

just do following.

1. Dead Island is dead on VM Virtual Machines, Parallels Desktop 7 and Domain Accounts; therefore until they fix it, it will have to be installed on a native Windows installed machine or from booting-up in BOOTCAMP if you have a Mac.

2. Just make sure your Windows user account is also the System Administrator account.

3. Use Explorer (Start Menu>My Computer) to go into the C: drive > Program Files (x86) and create a new folder here called Techland and leave it empty.

4. Then mount the disc-image with Daemon Tools Light.

5. Don't auto-run, when the dialog box appears asking what you want to do, just click on open folder to view disk contents.

6. Right click the 'steambackup2.EXE' file and choose 'Run as Administrator' - NOW if this extract how it should do, then you should have the contents of the extraction placed within the 'Techland' folder you created earlier, if however there is a privilages or permissions problem or something then the extraction places the contents deep in a hidden folder within your home 'user-name' folder something like (username-folder) > AppData > Local > VirtualStore > ProgramFiles (x86) > Techland (or just Dead Island) > Dead Island. This can be where the extraction places it and has probably driven many mad trying to find where all those GigaBytes disappeared too - I had to check out some system logs to find this out myself, therefore feel free to point users back to this post if people are still experiencing this.

7. Providing all went well, then you should have your extraction in the correct place. Now open the Crack folder in the disk image and select-all, copy, then paste into the folder where the Main game folder is, i.e. C: > Program Files (x86) > Techland > Dead Island ..  clicking yes to any System Administrator permission dialog box that may appear.

8. Right-click the main game program executable file 'deadislandgame.exe' in the main game folder and choose to 'Pin to Start Menu' or/and Send to >  Desktop (create shortcut). Now right click on any created shortcuts and click on Properties and then the 'Advanced' button under the Shortcut-tab and then tick the 'Run as administrator' checkbox, click OK and then click Apply then OK.

9. Run game and hopefully enjoy! (not from within a virtual machine, until they fix this)

As mentioned, it does NOT work in virtual machine mode i.e. Parallels Desktop 7, VM Ware as 'kevinluongxD' pointed out and also other forums on the web have indicated that they could not play it under domain accounts - obviously a BIG fault with the game itself and having seen many other games work perfectly both natively in windows and in virtual machine mode like Paralles. 

So if anyone has a simple solution and workaround to enable the game within Parallels Desktop 7.... PLEASE share."

I'd also like to add to my above post that when I get into a truck it has no sound as well. I've tried various fixes from editing the audio file, changing my speakers to 5.1, reinstalling the game. I have all the updates. 

Like I said before audio is working just I cannot hear zombies they are silent as fuck I can't tell if there is one behind me till he is taking a bite out of me. When I swing my weapon it makes no noise. When I get into a truck it is silent."

Your saying your smart but ehh..can't manage to delete a file, a torrent is only downloading the huge file, when you delete something from utorrent, your just deleting the connection with the torrent.

,DR.SIMME,2011-09-18T22:34Z,"Everyone who got problems with the game. 

Missing dll files and sound.  

I had this same problem and I tried to reinstall and all kind of stuff. 

Then at last I got everything to work. 

Instead of mounting the file try to unrar it with Winrar.  

Then you run ""steambackup2"" as admin

And when you install make sure to install on your  C hard drive.

First time I installed I installed on my D where I install all of my games. 

Then just copy the crack to the intall directory and run ""deadislandgame"" as admin and all should work.  


So to make it clear.  Unrar instead of mounting. Run steambackup2 as admin. Install on C. Run game.

This should make the game work correctly.

- Then i clicked the auto run option that pops up, then a box will appear and opens a file finder which asks you were you want to install the game. I choose program files in the C drive.

- Then after installing the game i copied the files from the folder named ""Crack"" into the Dead Island folder which was created in the C drive copy it into the folder.

,savestheeday,2011-09-21T03:20Z,"I rarely comment...but since you guys are about to slit your wrists over this shit, THIS is how you install the game...if this method does not work, then just assume it's not fucking going to...this is EXACTLY what I did (on my first try..without bitching and begging for help) and the game runs just fucking flawlessly.

1) Download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6656193/Dead_Island-RELOADED

2) Download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6656242/Dead_Island.Crack_Update_-_RELOADED

3) Download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6656841/Dead_Island_Update_1-RELOADED

4) Install Power ISO...create a virtual drive, and MOUNT THE .ISO FILE called rld-deis.iso

5) From your desktop click start, computer, or 'my computer' - right-click on newly-mounted .ISO and select INSTALL!

6) When it asks for Directory, install it wherever the fuck you want to install it!  I personally put mine under Program Files...Don't worry about creating a ""Dead Island"" folder, it will do it automatically...

7) When you are done installing, return to desktop and click start, my computer.  RIGHT-CLICK the mounted ISO file and select 'open'...then, open the 'crack' folder.

8) HIGHLIGHT AND COPY everything within this folder...now, go to your fucking directory, meaning the ROOT location at which you installed Dead Island...So, for me, I installed under C:/Program Files/Dead Island..I would navigate to the Dead Island folder, double-click it to open it and then PASTE all the cracks you previously copied, select YES and OVERWRITE to all..

9) Again, navigate to my computer and RIGHT-CLICK the mounted .ISO image and select 'open'...

10) Double-Click 'resources' folder...then, double-click 'Redist' folder...double click DirectX folder...find DXSETUP.EXE and double click to install

11) Go back to 'Redist' folder from step 10 and double-click VCRedist folder. Install VCRedist.exe

12) Return to Redist folder from step 10 once more, and double click WMF folder. Install WMFDist11yadayada.exe

13) Double-Click Dead Island.Crack Update - RELOADED folder (that you downloaded in step 2) - COPY everything within this folder!  Once copied, navigate to the DIRECTORY where you installed Dead Island (just like in step 8!)

14) DOUBLE-CLICK Dead.Island.Update.1-RELOADED folder (that you downloaded from step 3) - COPY everything within this folder! Once copied, navigate to the directory where you installed Dead Island (yep....yet again)

15) If there isn't already a shortcut on your desktop to launch the game, navigate to the DIRECTORY WHERE YOU INSTALLED THE GAME and right-click on deadislandgame.exe select 'Create Shortcut'

16) your fucking done...dude.  I just spent THREE TIMES longer to explain to you guys how to do it, than it actually took me to do.  There are several steps of mine, that if you knew what you were doing, could be avoided...but, this is the sure-fire way to make it work and it's what I do with nearly EVERY FUCKING GAME TORRENT.  If I missed a simple step somewhere along the way, my bad.  This is what you get ;)."
,AceKiller420,2011-09-21T05:44Z,"Ok so I finally got it to work after 4 installs. The gibberish wording is gone I do get a black screen when starting the game but it should not affect the rest of the game just press esc,enter to skip right to the title screen. I played for about 3 hours so far no crashes.

For those of you that are having problems with the gibberish wording this is what I did.

1. I extracted the game using winrar.

2. Mount the Image using Daemon tools.

3. After mounting an installer should show up. Close that one and go to where you extracted the game and double click on ""steambackup2"" then it will ask you where do you want to install the game. I placed it in C:\Games\Dead Island or you can place it in C:\Program files. Wait until it is done. It should look like this C:\Program Files\Dead Island.

4. Copy all the items in the Crack folder and paste them in the the dead island folder the installer created.

5. After Pasting the crack click on the Red palm tree. And it should work. (Creating a shortcut to the game won't work it will just give you an error message you will have to run the game from where you installed it every time)

Note: I installed the Update-1-Reloaded and it reverted back to the gibberish words.

Hopefully that will resolve the messed up words."

The game does not work without them. All reloaded copies and other torrents seem to be effected the sameway. The game performance start to suck periodically when the virus is activates. It is not visible in the task bar processes. BEWARE!!!

Mount the iso, it will let you choose where to put the files (name it 'dead island'), now open the ROM Drive its mounted too, copy all the content inside the 'Crack' folder and paste it into the ('dead island')folder that the files got installed too, and there is your game, enjoy :)"

,ketchupfreak,2011-09-22T15:33Z,"I've been checking this torrent from time to time just to see if you guys are still having problems. My game doesn't crash, has sound, has all the sprites in it(even the fire), I can save. In short I didn't have any problem.

Specs:

Windows 7 64-bit
Core2Quad
GeForce 9500GT
4GB RAM
Asus P5G41T-M LX3

Here's how I installed the game:

1. Download torrent
2. Inside the folder, mount the file ""rld-deis"".

For those of you who are not that computer literate, download and install Power ISO. You should be able to right the said file and find a new tab named ""Power ISO"". Click it then click ""mount to image drive"". After mounting, you should see it in ""My Computer"".

3. Once you're inside ""rld-deis"", look for ""steambackup2"". DON'T CLICK IT YET. Right click the file and click on properties. Go to the second tab named ""Compatibility"". Look for ""compatibility mode"" and run the program for ""Windows XP (Service Pack2)"". Click ok.

4. Go to your ""Program Files x86"" folder and create a new folder named ""Tech Land""

5. Right click the installer again then click, ""run as administrator"". It should take you to the installer window. Just install as you would. Just direct the installer to the folder you created so you'd know where to find it later on.

Note: For those of you with Adobe Drive, it gives a DLL error. Just click ""no"". It'll continue installing. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: When you receive something like, ""If you like the game, but it"", that's not an error. It only means the installation is done. Remember, that is not an error.

6. After installing, go to the folder you created a while ago. You'll see a new folder created named ""Dead Island"". Click it. Open a new Windows Explorer and go back to your mounted ISO. Go to the ""crack"" folder and highlight everything you have there. Copy and paste it to the ""Dead Island"" folder that the installer created. Next, go back to the mounted ISO and click on ""resources"". Do the same thing you did for ""crack"". Just copy and paste.

7. You're done installing. Look for the file ""deadislandgame"". That's the launcher. Just right click the file and ""run as administrator"". It should launch the game properly.


That's how I made it work. I hope it does the same for you."

,awec,2011-09-23T02:14Z,"! You can play this game Co-op !
---------------------------------------

Download and install Tunngle/Smartsteam. If you dont know what they are just google em. Remember to NOT use your main steam account on smartsteam!

When ure done with all the installing and account creating reboot your computer.

Open Tunngle and go to a random lobby with your friend(it doesnt need to be Dead Island lobby)

Run Smartsteam.exe AS ADMIN same thing with Deadisland.exe!

Start a game and click play. Go to Online Options in the left bottom of the screen and switch Visibility to LAN. 

Start a game and play untill you get a black screen saying Act I. Now if you and your friend did everything right and the stars are aligned your friend should be able to join your game or you join his/hers by pressing ESC and going to Game Lobby.

Sorry for crappy English but this should cover the issue for the lazy asses who are not willing to search things for themselves.

Just copy the 'deadisland.exe' file in the rld.deis iso. file to the game directory....

,gavinorb,2011-09-25T18:30Z,"About the dll error, I saw a solution to a forum that you must locate the 'Dead Island' folder, from where you installed it [drive C or wherever].

Inside that Dead Island file, open the folder named 'DI' then locate the folder 'Data'.
Once you opened it, go to game.ini file - it's the configuration setting.
After opening it, find the line that says ' Locale(""En"") ' . Change the line to ' Locale(en) '  small e and remove the """" inside en.

If you followed it, it should work properly. But if it doesn't, I suggest you download DirectX9."

Install (this will install Steam...if you continue with the install it will eventually ask for a product key)

Now...EXPLORE the disc, open ""Steambackup2"" and choose the directory you want ""dead Island"" installed to I.E. C:Programfiles/Dead Island

Once ST2 is done copy the ""crack"" file and paste it into the newly created directory

(working on Gateway laptop w/ Windows 7 home(64bit)
runs very smooth (even smoother than Resident Evil 5...which blew my mind)

Thanks for the UL"
,Facti0n,2011-09-26T21:21Z,"Now i got the game installed, but when i start the game it just gives me black screen :S"
,FFSrabbit,2011-09-26T23:06Z,"So far I got this game working fine except for one thing which is starting to get on my nerves, ALL the text in the game menus or when you pickup stuff like cash, is littered with these & symbols and that kinda makes it hard to figure things out.

a good example is the main menu
I would expect to see:
Continue
Play
Options
Extras
Exit

Instead I see
&MenuMain_Continue&
&MenuMain_Play&
&MenuMain_BTNOptions&
&MenMain_Extras&
&MenuMain_BTNExit&

Obviously this is no problem here cause there is enough space to accommodate, but when you get into the invintory/ other in-game menus, its a literal clusterfuck of ""&"" + illegible words

what I want to know is if thats just how this works, or did i do something wrong when i installed this/ how do i fix?"
,skatty14,2011-09-26T23:45Z,"Had a bit of trouble at first, but soon got it working...it functions well, thanks extremezone!

For people who are having trouble please try following these instructions (written by ketchupfreak): 

1. Download torrent
2. Inside the folder, mount the file ""rld-deis"".

For those of you who are not that computer literate, download and install Power ISO. You should be able to right the said file and find a new tab named ""Power ISO"". Click it then click ""mount to image drive"". After mounting, you should see it in ""My Computer"".

3. Once you're inside ""rld-deis"", look for ""steambackup2"". DON'T CLICK IT YET. Right click the file and click on properties. Go to the second tab named ""Compatibility"". Look for ""compatibility mode"" and run the program for ""Windows XP (Service Pack2)"". Click ok.

4. Go to your ""Program Files x86"" folder and create a new folder named ""Tech Land""

5. Right click the installer again then click, ""run as administrator"". It should take you to the installer window. Just install as you would. Just direct the installer to the folder you created so you'd know where to find it later on.

Note: For those of you with Adobe Drive, it gives a DLL error. Just click ""no"". It'll continue installing. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: When you receive something like, ""If you like the game, but it"", that's not an error. It only means the installation is done. Remember, that is not an error.

6. After installing, go to the folder you created a while ago. You'll see a new folder created named ""Dead Island"". Click it. Open a new Windows Explorer and go back to your mounted ISO. Go to the ""crack"" folder and highlight everything you have there. Copy and paste it to the ""Dead Island"" folder that the installer created. Next, go back to the mounted ISO and click on ""resources"". Do the same thing you did for ""crack"". Just copy and paste.

7. You're done installing. Look for the file ""deadislandgame"". That's the launcher. Just right click the file and ""run as administrator"". It should launch the game properly."

,canadianwalrus,2011-10-05T01:05Z,"This torrent worked absolutely amazing; the download speed was great (1mb/s) and it was a somewhat simple installation.

To anyone having issues I'll tell you what I did:

1. I used Daemon Tools Lite to mount the ISO and I just installed. No going into the ISO to click this and that, just a simple mount and install. You pick the location you want to install to and it'll all be there.

2. I took all the files located in the Crack folder of the ISO and placed them right in my Dead Island installation folder.

I guess two easy steps. I thought I'd have to download another thing but this was all I needed. I ran into an issue however where the game wouldn't start up so I attempted placing all the Crack files in the DI folder. Regardless after clicking on deadislandgame.exe enough times it just decided to work. (I also removed the Crack files from the DI folder once it started working)

An excellent game, I love the graphics. Currently I have my ps3 controller to play. Anyone wondering how to do that, I'm using MotionJoy and set it to Emulate XBox controller.

I recommend this torrent, it's not very difficult to get going. I haven't gotten multiplayer going, but single is good enough.

--Play in Analog mode if you have a controller, it's fun :D Good luck and enjoy!"

download

MOUNT the iso with your emulator

DO NOT CLICK ""SETUP"" to start the installation, open ""steambackup2""

when thats done go into the iso.

open the folder called ""crack""

press ctrl + a

press ctrl + c

go to C:/ Games/ DeadIsland/ 

press ctrl + v

now all you have to do is open ""deadislandgame"" and you can play. though id recommend downloading the update first, however you can play fine without it."

AMAZING GAME!!!!"
,Slaxwarez,2011-10-06T17:57Z,"@Handsome_Hawk

I have finished this game twice without any problem except .. if your save file (unpacked) is bigger than 10246 bytes it'll make crash your game when loading the save game. So keep your inventory and storage items small

@jeremy96

Your computer specs are way above mine. I'm only using ATI 4830 (the lowest class in 4800 series) and Phenom X4 (first phenom not second) with 4GB RAM and Windows 7 64 ... with all detail set to High ... and i don't experience any problem except the problem i mentioned above

My suggestion is ... :

1. Update your Graphic card driver (in case you're using outdated driver)

2. Search for Dead.Island.Update.1-RELOADED and download it and extract it to your Dead Island install directory overwriting everything there (note: your previous save might be unaccessible after this)

3. Then finally search Dead_Island_Update_3_LANFiX-P2P .. and download and extract everything EXCEPT steam_api.dll and steam_appid.txt (unless you want to play online although for me i only play offline)

Special Note:
- If you create two different character, your old character might became unaccessible. That doesn't happen on the original / legal version. To overcome this just backup your save game before creating new character :D"
,eagle_luchador,2011-10-06T18:25Z,"@oniganxxxx 

thanks for posting your setup guide. just one question, when you open ""steambackup2"" all that happens is a directory box opens up, once I explore to the iso file and copy the crack file you say to go to game/deadisland and paste. when I open steambackup2 is it supposed to create the directory in the games folder?? other wish there is nowhere to past the file just following your instructions 

""HOW TO INSTALL

download

MOUNT the iso with your emulator

DO NOT CLICK ""SETUP"" to start the installation, open ""steambackup2""

when thats done go into the iso.

open the folder called ""crack""

press ctrl + a

press ctrl + c

go to C:/ Games/ DeadIsland/

press ctrl + v

now all you have to do is open ""deadislandgame"" and you can play. though id recommend downloading the update first, however you can play fine without it."""

,HolyNathan,2011-10-06T21:16Z,"=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

INSTRUCTIONS FOR NOOBS -.-

1) Download the Torrent

2) Extract ISO to a folder (i Did C:\Desktop\Dead Island)

3) DONT Use Setup.exe. Instead Use SteamBackup.exe which is (Our.Installer)

4)When Done, the only way you can play Dead Island, Is when you go to Crack Folder and Click deadislandgame.exe

5)Now PLAY THE GAME (: YAYY "

the reason that Skidrow, Reloaded Razor etc do not pre - crack all of their games is because they dont want tons of noobs downloading their torrents because then it would just make it wayy to easy for people to get cracked games and the gaming PC industry would loose a lot of money and a lot of gamers it would be much less worth it to make a game if half of them are going to be cracked copies - ALSO NOOBS DONT SEED SO THEY'D RUIN THE TORRENTS -.-"

1) Download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6656193/Dead_Island-RELOADED

2) Download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6656242/Dead_Island.Crack_Update_-_RELOADED

3) Download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6656841/Dead_Island_Update_1-RELOADED

4) Install Power ISO...create a virtual drive, and MOUNT THE .ISO FILE called rld-deis.iso

5) From your desktop click start, computer, or 'my computer' - right-click on newly-mounted .ISO and select INSTALL!

6) When it asks for Directory, install it wherever the fuck you want to install it! I personally put mine under Program Files...Don't worry about creating a ""Dead Island"" folder, it will do it automatically...

7) When you are done installing, return to desktop and click start, my computer. RIGHT-CLICK the mounted ISO file and select 'open'...then, open the 'crack' folder.

8) HIGHLIGHT AND COPY everything within this folder...now, go to your fucking directory, meaning the ROOT location at which you installed Dead Island...So, for me, I installed under C:/Program Files/Dead Island..I would navigate to the Dead Island folder, double-click it to open it and then PASTE all the cracks you previously copied, select YES and OVERWRITE to all..

9) Again, navigate to my computer and RIGHT-CLICK the mounted .ISO image and select 'open'...

10) Double-Click 'resources' folder...then, double-click 'Redist' folder...double click DirectX folder...find DXSETUP.EXE and double click to install

11) Go back to 'Redist' folder from step 10 and double-click VCRedist folder. Install VCRedist.exe

12) Return to Redist folder from step 10 once more, and double click WMF folder. Install WMFDist11yadayada.exe

13) Double-Click Dead Island.Crack Update - RELOADED folder (that you downloaded in step 2) - COPY everything within this folder! Once copied, navigate to the DIRECTORY where you installed Dead Island (just like in step 8!)

14) DOUBLE-CLICK Dead.Island.Update.1-RELOADED folder (that you downloaded from step 3) - COPY everything within this folder! Once copied, navigate to the directory where you installed Dead Island (yep....yet again)

15) If there isn't already a shortcut on your desktop to launch the game, navigate to the DIRECTORY WHERE YOU INSTALLED THE GAME and right-click on deadislandgame.exe select 'Create Shortcut'

16) your fucking done...dude. I just spent THREE TIMES longer to explain to you guys how to do it, than it actually took me to do.

I'm not dumb when it comes to computer's by any means and I'll tell you this, I have NEVER had a hard time figuring out to install a game, or a app till trying to figure out this hot mess! I've been trying now for almost 3 hour's to get this game running, I have uninstalled, Re-installed, ran the cracked install I mean I have tryed EVERYTHING! Yet every time I try to start the game I get some sort of crash error. Instead of being mean and hateful, Try acting like humans and show that you people have a heart in your body!

1) Mount to drive (I used poweriso/great program learn it)

2) When mounted, go to my computer, it should come up as another cd drive labeled as dead island

3) use the installer ""steambackup2"" itll give u an option where to install files (install on DESKTOP)

4)NEXT; Copied ""Crack"" contents (found on cd  drive earlier) into ""deadisland"" directory you just installed on the desktop

5)Done; NOW, go back into ""dead island"" Directory and created desktop shortcut of ""deadislandgame""

6)HAVE FUN!

for this error u need to do is go to the drive where the game is installed and then find the dead island folder open it and then run the game from the dead island icon if u don't run it as administrator  it will say that u do not have write permission so run it as admin it will work. another tip if u want quick access to the game open the properties of the icon that u used to run the game and in the properties/security option set it to run as admin and then run the game and then snap out of the game while it still runs and shows an icon on the taskbar and then simply pin it to the taskbar, so when the next time u run it it will show u the dialog box for running it as admin, just what u Need !!

There is a known save-game bug with this version. This is not a reloaded issue, this is a Techland issue. It was present on all platforms, xbox360, ps3 and PC. It was patched a few months ago, and the 

update IS available and i will provide a direct link below. Using v1.0 It is very common to have to either beat it one continuous sitting, or risk data loss/game restart. It has been patched (Update ""5"" , v1.3) 

I will explain this later. 

 It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED after proper installation to update to ""Dead Island v1.3"" which i will provide a link to, also legit, also cracked. It is known  as ""Update 5"" and includes the Original ""Dead Island 

Day One (1) Update"" as well as the updates ""2, 3, and 4."" It is an all-in-one update-and-go  update/bugfix package and has been thoroughly scanned, tested and verified.

Update from Dead Island v1.0 to ""Update 5"" Dead Island v1.3  (Level cap increase, MANY bugfixes including the annoying lost game-save bug.) [ ...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! ...]
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6770880/Dead.Island.Update.5.v1.3.0-P2P

This game is playable OFFLINE solo campaign as is (v1.0, straight install+Crack) as well as updated (v1.3, installed+Cracked and patched)

This game is NOT PLAYABLE utilizing the OFFICIAL techland multiplayer features, online or LAN. Both versions suffer this. Common with pirated games, if you want the official multiplayer features, there is 

no free workaround/get-over... support the damn developers of this great game and BUY IT.

THERE ARE RUMOURED TO BE WORKAROUND UTILIZING HAMACHI, SMARTSTEAM, OR TUNNGLE TO PLAY ONLINE MULTIPLAYER AND OFFLINE CO-OP MULTIPLAYER. THIS TUTORIAL DOES NOT 

COVER HOW TO DO SO, BUT I MAY DO A WRITE UP LATER ON!

uploaded by ""extremezone"" 

is 100% LEGIT, Working, NON-STEAM. and CRACKED. it is the ORIGINAL Dead Island V1.0 game version. (I suggest updating to 'Update 5 - v1.3' after install)

No Virus. No Trojans. No Keyloggers. No Spyware. No Adware. No Malware. A ""false positive"" MAY TRIGGER, but is NOTHING to be concerned with. this is CLEAN. 

There is no CD Key Required.

This is a straight cracked .exe install. STEAM IS NOT REQUIRED TO PLAY THIS when installed PROPERLY.

Cracked game files are included.

This release is game version ""Dead Island v1.0"""
,Purged1234x,2011-11-05T23:48Z,"1.) Download Torrent
2.) Extract Contents of  rld-deis.iso (5.49gb) to a Folder. Explore newly extracted folder to find ""CRACK"" subdirectory.
3.) Create a Virtual CD Drive using Daemon/PowerISO/etc
4.) Mount ORIGINAL ARCHIVED rld-deis.iso to the Virtual CD Drive you just created. BE SURE not to try and mount the extracted folder. MOUNT THE ORIGINAL rld-deis.iso!
5.) Autoplay the mounted rld-deis.iso OR explore and run ""Steambackup2"" application file, 361kb.
6.) Let the game completely install to an installation directory of your choosing.
7.) Once completed, Open up the installation directory in Windows Explorer.
8.) Open up the extracted rld-deis.iso you extracted earlier and find the CRACK subdirectory.
9.) Copy/Paste or Drag/Drop the contents of CRACK to the INSTALLATION directory of the Dead Island game.
10.) Close the extracted folder. Delete if you wish. In the Installation Directory find the .exe to play Dead Rising, Create a shortcut to Desktop and enjoy playing!
		This is to install the client as is, no updates, cracked Dead Rising v1.0 for Single Player campaign.
		No Steam Required, No Cd Key when cracked. Cracking it disables official multiplayer features, as those require a cd-key and Steam.
		You can play on private servers for multiplayer, utilizing Hamachi, Tunggle, or another third-party software."

I have them set to maxed settings but the game makes it out that they are REALLY bad like not even low graphics worse than that, and its definitely not a problem with my pc. I was just playing Deus Ex on highest graphics without a problem but for some reason I have a problem with Dead Island. I followed a YT guide on how to install.. I don't know if that means anything but I would really like to play this game in normal quality. I don't know how to explain but I know what low graphics settings look like this just looks extremely messed up.

,carlZuss,2011-11-17T18:57Z,"Attention to all people who failed to find the installation folder of Dead Island. Make sure you enable the ""Hidden files and folders"" to be seen under Folder Options of Control Panel.

It is located at:
C:\Users\""YOUR USERNAME\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files\Dead Island.

Crack game by moving all the contents in CRACK folder in ISO into the game dir. Shud work. If you have installed many times and that the game took most of your disk space. Now you can delete all those redundant folders to gain back ur mysteriously ""lost"" 5Gb.

@Funkyasshit: chill man. You shud be thankful enuf tht extremezone took effort to upload it. And at least do some research before venting ur anger all over the page.

,PedalGrind,2011-11-24T08:51Z,"For all those who actually READ these comments and care about the game working: make sure to keep a back up save (copy the save data and store it somewhere else) in case your data becomes corrupted. I've been playing this game from this torrent (Thanks again EZ, another excellent upload) and after my second time through the data became corrupted and unloadable. The steam-client has a fix for it however it doesn't seem possible to use their fix application. 

I, personally, will be keeping a daily backup for the next time this happens. Thankfully I had kept a few backups without knowing this issue might develop. Unfortunately my most recent backup save was ~%50 main quest difference. Not a huge issue to me but one that can easily be avoided in the future. 

For every question I've seen on these forums regarding this torrent/game there's a very easy answer-
FOLLOW THE FUCKING DIRECTIONS.

,ViolentC,2011-12-18T08:31Z,"Game was fun untill I got up to Chaptor 14 and hit a quest I couldn't beat. you can't leave the quest either. you just respawn and die in a village with 14 monsters over and over... your weapons slowly breaking every time u die till you can't possibly win... one forum said to restart the game with the same character and play from lvl 14 start. but this means none of the side quests are completed and you lose all your modified weapons... I decided to quit rather than play the 30+ hours to get back to where I was (about 85% game complete.) I say save yourself the pain of starting something  you can't finish... or just be aware you need 3 guns with full ammo, a stash of molitof and probibly 4 players when you get to the quest called PURE BLOOD"
,ViolentC,2011-12-18T08:37Z,"PS. When I tried to restart at lvl 14 on the same character not only were my side quests not completed (about 50 quests I had already done) but the stupid game also saved the new character over top of my old one. so even when I wanted to go back to the mission I couldnt beat for another try with my busted weapons I spawned at the location on a lvl 2 character with white weapons... GG I'm uninstalling this for a while. very angry.... NOT the uploaders fault at all. just a very buggy game that needs a lot of love from its programers before its enjoyable...
Why I'm on a rant. another commen bug in this game is inventory items just Vanish sometimes. meaning you can spend all your hard earned game money upgrading and modifying a weapon only to leave the workbench and come up with empty hands... VERY ANNOYING!

Attempted to play the game via the dead island exe. And nothing happens. Possible I need admin access (which im unsure of how to use) or that I am using a mac running this via crossover. Any help would be appreciated. Tried installing this about 15 times. Looks like a great torrent to me and thanks. Im sure it's either just not possible to run it with crossover or I am as usual missing one tiny thing.

If you cannot find dead island directory to go start menu and search Dead island.exe from there and then at top in the URL you can trace the root patch of you directory

After you found it, make sure you move it to a more know place... like say C:/Dead/Dead island... make folder"

And I'll make it easier for some of you new guys. Even though I've downloaded some cracked games before, I'm still fairly new and got it to work like a charm.

1. Download the torrent

2. Download Daemon Tools (Lite)

3. Now mount the .iso file with Daemon tools (You can do this by double clicking on the .iso file or by going to daemon tools and click mount image and browse for it)

4. Install the game using the steambackup2.exe thingy (It will prompt you run the .exe or view folder when you double click the ""mounted"" image, just click run) And pick the location where you want it downloaded. I personally would download it to desktop so it doesn't get lost

5. Go back to the mounted image and double click it. click ""view folder"" and open the folder that says ""crack"" Copy everything in that folder and paste it into the ""dead island"" folder that you had recently installed (mines would be on the desktop) Yes copy over everything.

6. Go back to the mounted image and double click again, click ""view folder"" and go to the folder that says ""redist"" now go to DirectX and run ""Directxsetup"" Next go to the next folder ""vcredist"" and run the .exe Then go to ""WMF"" and run that "".exe""

7. Now go back the the dead island folder and run deadislandgame.exe

Have fun.

Also for peeps who wanna play co-op online with their friends and family members on lan. All you have to do is go the the tunggle website and search ""dead island"" it'll give you step-by-step instructions on how to download multiplayer!!!"

Tried using search but it can't find them and it doesn't come up in control panel under remove programs either."

To plat Coop  u gotta have SmartSteam, Tunngle (or Hamachi) and the newest Update [7] (recommend). And when u start a game, the other player needs to have same things and need to have same ip (in hamachi or tunngle) and on both sides gotta be set to lan.

to play online you can play via tunggle. just instal the latest patch and greenluma.

,TehAgent,2012-04-14T12:09Z,"well after playing for around 10 hours now, ive noticed a few issues.

White chick - game crashes when you use your RAGE

Black chick (though this could be for all of them not sure as didnt want to risk my save again) - manually selecting ""load from last check point"" changed my character to the big black dude and set me back to level 1 with nothing id collected in the first part of the game.

Few of the missions on the second part of the island (after you get to the village) seem to be missing an entery for when getting into certain houses, you need to minimise the game when it hangs at the loading screen and close the warning box it pops up, before it will finish loading the game.

Now not sure if these issues are due to the cracked exe, or the game its self. but thought id warn people. not major game killers, just dont load from last check point in the pause menu incase it resets your character."
,TehAgent,2012-04-14T12:14Z,"Dear Mrtrolls, game saves fine, set the dead island exe to run as administrator and IT SAVES FINE 

Wish people who didnt have a clue would stop spreading bullshit.

but yes this is the dev version and pressing Y does put you into fly mode."

,Swiftwinter,2012-04-27T07:28Z,"Game works and everything. This is an important warning, though. This is the dev version, which means that pressing Y enables no-clip. DO NOT SAVE WHEN IN NO-CLIP. DOING SO REVERTS YOUR CHARACTER BACK TO LEVEL ONE. This happened to me by complete accident when I was 10+ hours into the game. I had no idea about no-clip and I guess I tapped Y by mistake. Had no idea what the fuck was happening; only option was to exit the game. Upon reentering, I was back where I left off, except I was level 1 and everything in my inventory was wiped. It's a fun game, though. I'm just not gonna redo all that shit again."
