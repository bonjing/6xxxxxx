Product Description: This book will introduce various power management integrated circuits (IC) design techniques to build future energy-efficient â€œgreenâ€ electronics. The goal is to achieve high efficiency, which is essential to meet consumersâ€™ growing need for longer battery lives. The focus is to study topologies amiable for full on-chip implementation (few external components) in the mainstream CMOS technology, which will reduce the physical size and the manufacturing cost of the devices.
