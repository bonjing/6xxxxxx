Changes in DVDFab Passkey 8.0.3.7 (September 6, 2011):
    * New: Added option "Enable Hybrid disc support", and it's disabled by default since some drives are reporting wrong hybrid disc information.
    * New: Updated language files.
Passkey for Blu-ray: 
    * New: Added region-reset support for PowerDVD 11.
    * Info: AACS MKB v26 is out, and it's already supported by old version of Passkey.

as usual preactivated-precracked version...
Many thanks again to Dimitry for sharing.

Note :
--------&gt; MediaGet is formally and definitively disallowed on my torrents !!!
I don't wanna see it anymore !
libtorrent peers,please,be sure to rightly set your torrent client.
I get many problems with you too but you still stay allowed to connect anyway.
Note :
to Japanese peers :
I ask for certain specific peers from your country to definitively stop 
trying to connect to my torrents.
For the last time for those who still try :
please,go away !!!
It will still be useless and in vain anyway.
So why insisting again and again,on and on...it's stupid !
Ip filter requires...for some security reasons.
All ip are logged and can be traced and seriously checked if necessary
and much more...

ty for understanding
Enjoy
