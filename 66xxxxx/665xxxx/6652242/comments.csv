,splurf,2011-09-05T08:52Z,Thanks WMI.  You have outdone yourself this time.  Every time  I think a set cannot get more boring..........  Anyhow it is good that the clothes that my grandmother donated to the Salvation Army have been recycled!
[T],webmodelsindex,2011-09-05T08:57Z,lol @ steevo
,shdwolf1,2011-09-05T14:00Z,"thx wmi.+   dept store catalog pics; boring! steveo is right, omg, the outfits are atrocious. 
Sandra is like the girl at the party you really want, but isn't giving it up for anyone. 
Ella is the tease you can never quite get drunk enuf. 
So, you end up going for the wild one getting drunk and taking her top off as she dances on the bar; thank god for the Virginia's out there...lol"

,john2597,2011-09-05T20:43Z,"LMFAO Igor, Yeah it is an aweful outfit, its made her look like a clown, doubt i will bother with this one. Thanks tho WMI."
,captainkhaos1966,2011-09-05T22:48Z,Thanks WMI. Yeah pretty weak set. Ciople of nice ass shots but that's about it. I am waiting for Wed. Always look forward to Virginia. Since Sandra and Ella seems destined to model for kids mags Virginia is the one blasting to the top
,jaham272,2011-09-05T23:33Z,"I think what we are seeing are out takes, sets that were shot long long ago and deemed 2nd tire.
My guess is that they never figured Sandra to get knocked up. All they are doing now is milking her fans by regurgitating what they have laying around.

I would like to thank the poster and all the other paying member of Sandraâs sites. I am pretty sure I have seen everything she has ever done and never paid a dime. However I feel that the Sandra era ended years ago."
,jessie1990,2011-09-06T00:19Z,"I like this set, it is a really cute fun set, reminds me of why I fell in love with Sandra to begin with."
,RIggsta,2011-09-06T02:27Z,just another boring ass model...
,batzen,2011-09-06T04:38Z,She looks like an idiot
,navlock,2011-09-07T20:38Z,"How can I view the extra upcoming pics from Sandra sets on fame-girls.com? Not just one standard picture they post each week, but more. Plz share..."
