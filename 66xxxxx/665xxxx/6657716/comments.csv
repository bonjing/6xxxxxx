USE AT OWN RISK, THERE ARE SUSPICIOUS LOOK FILES SUCH AS .agent.db.dll.

AGAIN, USE AT OWN RISK."

,zekiel247,2011-09-07T09:52Z,Clean by Nod 32
,Wintermist,2011-09-07T09:52Z,"It's the real deal. It's the beta client, but I'm sure you will need a key for it."
,Torm3nT,2011-09-07T10:06Z,"avast! version 110906-1 detected no threats during or after install.

,ficgic,2011-09-07T10:22Z,"This isn't fake, I already have it installed.
Disappointment is that you can login only with your Battle.net account which has Diablo 3 beta key."
,Espionage724,2011-09-07T10:24Z,"If your at all suspicious, you can find a link to the client right on Blizzard's servers even "
,Wintermist,2011-09-07T10:31Z,"OK, it works, but you got to login with your Battle.net account and if you're not in the beta-list you can't login."
,zekiel247,2011-09-07T10:51Z,Sadly true...
,call_me_nobody,2011-09-07T21:38Z,so then... whats was the point of downloading this again since u even can't use it?
,ficgic,2011-09-07T22:21Z,This is just a reminder that full game release comes next. ;)
,In_Da_Club,2011-09-07T22:57Z,You have no usage of this unless you have d3 beta invite / cd-key
,PhreakU,2011-09-08T06:22Z,"This is the BEST torrent out there!

The beta client is widely available, therefor, this torrent is completely fucking useless!!  Like tits on a bull!!

Amazing stuff!!!"
,RafeeqQC,2011-09-08T16:58Z,"To play Diablo 3 beta, you must have a battle.net account with a D3 beta key. Otherwise, you won't be able to play it.

But !... you still can explore the MPQs and listen to the beautiful musics in it."
,darjeengo,2011-09-18T12:41Z,"This torrent is everything it is said to be. It is the diablo 3 beta, without a beta key, tho."
,SlimShadywD,2011-09-22T05:06Z,i think this is fake because it will not let me sign in
,alleasy23,2011-09-25T17:57Z,is the beta still working
,mekushion,2011-10-08T19:26Z,"I get ""checking new tools..."", but nothing happens :/"
