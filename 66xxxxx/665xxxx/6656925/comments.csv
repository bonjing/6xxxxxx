,hauntnut,2011-09-07T00:54Z,What's the running time on this? Is it the theatrical or unrated extended version?
[T],insinuendo,2011-09-07T03:15Z,RUNTIME//////////// 125 min
,MovieDude82,2011-09-07T12:30Z,Stuck at 92.4% connected to 0 seeds ? If somebody seeds and lets me have 100% I'll seed at 500kb/s for as long as it takes to get more people with 100%
,phoenixrises,2011-09-07T20:35Z,"Please seed guys! I'm showing 100+ seeds but no one is sharing. C'mon, play nice folks. Stuck at 93.5 :-("
,MovieDude82,2011-09-07T21:07Z,"I was on 92.4 this afternoon but now stuck on 93.5% aswell, showing 0 (105) seeds. I don't understand why one person won't seed the full 100%. My ratio so far is 2.104"
,euphoria4949,2011-09-07T21:53Z,"Same here :-\ Suck 93.5% for around 12 hours now with ""zero"" seeds!
It's a shame because it started so well, it was downloading at over 1.8MB/s at the start and shot up yo 90% in just an hour with just 1 seed, but as of 21:00GMT 7th September, no seeds and everybody is stuck :("
[T],insinuendo,2011-09-07T22:29Z,"Learn to fucking chill people.

I don't leave folks hanging dry...I just teach them patience :)

Those who know me know my ways.

Those who don't well..."
,phoenixrises,2011-09-07T22:31Z,My laptop is overheating from being on 24 hours plus so have to log out for a few hours. If anyone reaches 100% please could they continue to seed for a while. I know it's a bloody cheek to ask but it would be very much appreciated! 
[V],HolyRoses,2011-09-08T00:47Z,thanks for the up.
[T],insinuendo,2011-09-08T01:21Z,Enjoy HR
,euphoria4949,2011-09-08T05:17Z,"Ok fair enough I'll give insinuendo his due, it has now started up again and is now being seeded by myself and a couple of hundred of people.

Sorry insinuendo thanks for the up great quality, it was just frustrating for a load of us been stuck we thought you might have left us :( lol

Video = 10
Audio = 10

Thanks again"
,MovieDude82,2011-09-08T10:54Z,"Yeah thanks Insinuendo was just a bit annoying being stuck with hundreds of other people. I'll be seeding for a while so no need to worry about people getting stuck

A:10

,phoenixrises,2011-09-08T12:39Z,"Sorry for doubting you insinuendo, I'll know for next time. And thanks for the great quality upload."
,VelvetMirror,2011-09-08T14:24Z,"This is not the unrated edition.

But thanks in any case."
,phoenixrises,2011-09-08T18:17Z,"Sorry VelvetMirror but you are wrong. This is indeed the unrated version. I have watched this dl and can confirm that this is the longer version with a run time of 2hrs 11 mins. See this link:

,phoenixrises,2011-09-08T18:21Z,"Insinuendo, is there any chance you could also upload the theatrical version/cut of the film? Or do you have a link to a good copy? Thanks."
,sishe,2011-09-08T23:34Z,whats the point of torrents if no one is going to share them?!?! my upload is way above my damn download! this is uncalled for!  start sharing!
