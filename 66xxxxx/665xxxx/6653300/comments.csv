,bikybay,2011-09-05T19:45Z,Hi SaM. Thanks for the upload . I will appreciate if you could upload DVD RIp of AVATAR EXTENDED 2010. Thanks in advance and always eager for your uploads
,Mathlol,2011-09-06T06:14Z,@bikybay SaM upped the best dvd sized version of Avatar you will ever find.  FASM is the last stop for movie quality equal to uncompressed rips twice in file size ~8GB.  Anything else in non-HD is already out there and cannot be made better than it already is.
,levarnaud,2011-09-06T20:19Z,and why would FASM's rip have the same quality as 8gb rips that other people released? I find it hard to believe tbh.
,Mathlol,2011-09-10T07:18Z,Fasm has their own methods.  Compression is an art.  If you're into video production the concept is easier to grasp.
,Mathlol,2011-09-10T07:21Z,"The 2011-03-01 fasm version looked nicer imo.  The aspect looks funny on this, all squished."
,CUX211,2011-09-11T10:56Z,DOBAR DOBAR
[T],fachman,2011-09-14T05:25Z,ALL IS SQUISHED when the player does not recognise SAR flag. Change player if its possible
,invpzg2,2011-09-16T14:04Z,"Audio sync is out even after installing MPC and following instructions, it's worse on other players. Starts off OK gets worse as movie progresses."

,doktorslecht,2011-09-28T08:40Z,FASM rips have about the same quality as 540p I've set my player up like they suggested compared to other AVATAR versions and that's what I came up with. This version lacks a ridiculous amount of detail especially in the darker parts. The colors are also not that good. Too bad though.
,xyhu,2011-10-08T23:20Z,Dziękuje ! :]
,mrpras,2011-10-17T14:16Z,"The secret sauce is in pre-processing - intelligent application of denoising (proper denoising) can make a huge difference..

A typical scenario I use for extreme cases:
Topaz Denoise on EVERY FRAME (Photoshop filter)
Temporal smoothing (virtualdub)..

Don't ask about them, go google it.. This ain't a forum. "
,xnajkn,2011-11-01T12:01Z,Is it having plugged in (burned) subtitles?

,karan1234,2012-02-21T09:13Z,is it gonna work on ps3?????just install in pendrive plug and play would work?
,tiz2,2012-03-04T21:32Z,"Calling Avatar ""Pocahontas with CGI"" is a pretty good comparison, but do you know those demo-discs that were made when dvd-players, surround-sound, and blu-ray each came out? They were made to really show the capabilities of the new tech and were just a mix of sounds and effects to demonstrate how the new stuff is better than the old. Exactly like those except it cost a billion dollars to make.  "
,elshiftos,2012-03-05T02:19Z,"Has anyone watched this all the way through?

If so, I'm amazed that noone has pointed out that it cuts off before the movie ends. Let me be the first to point it out :)

Great quality though - many thanks to encoders and uploaders."
,oxthorn,2012-03-05T05:10Z,"In response to the movie cutting out.

The movie ends when he opens his eyes.
true the transcoder coulda waited till the AVATAR in big green letters was on the screen.
someone with enough creative intelligence to produce such a file is capable of understanding this.

celavie...

In truth only about half a second of the movie is cut.

There are no credits."
,elshiftos,2012-03-07T14:41Z,"You're right, my mistake!

This is the first time I have seen the movie so I didn't actually know how it ended. The way it cuts off abruptly made me assume there was a problem.

,preparationh,2012-03-09T14:41Z,"good upload, great quality. thanks.
could've at least faded out at the end or something but still good stuff."
,xxhamster,2012-03-22T18:52Z,"I prefer Mark Kermode's description of it as 'Dances With Smurfs' 

I don't like the missing eye opening few seconds... it just feels wrong so i'm gonna try editing it in from another version and add a jumpcut to 15 secs of black...

,PravJuge,2012-04-01T15:44Z,awesome !!!lucky to have it
,barbarosac,2012-04-06T17:56Z,"nice work
like evreting in the FASM
but i aspected to see HAPPY FEET DOULOGI in the FASM rip because in my opinian is the best qulity.
I love HAPPY FEET and my child she loved.
i cant belive whay  nobody not converted in FASM FOR PS3.Is the best movie for children, and for us.
I just hope is not just my request , i belive is a lot of people how want to see this movie in the best quality ( FASM - PS3 ) And i hope sombody it will encode for PS3 SOON.          "
,kezdak5,2012-04-15T20:29Z,Is it in order?
,piizda,2012-04-16T12:00Z,This is old Avatar movie.
,rydelski,2012-04-26T06:07Z,"Wow. Okay so I had high expectations. Too high apparently. I have a 1080p monitor. 1920x1080 resolution. The video doesn't fill the entire screen, as it should. The pixels are horrible. And some of the comments say that this is good? Well, you've clearly never seen a blu ray film. I have movies in 720 from the 1970s that look better than this. That's pretty sad. In conclusion, this is fugly, and a far cry from what it should be. "

Video isn't too bad, could have definitely got over it if it weren't for the terrible audio. Felt like it was recorded on VHS or something."
