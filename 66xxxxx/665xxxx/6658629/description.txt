I pray it will do wonders for the Irish spirit to give these away
even if they did come from itunes and we need to fund such work communally
in lieu if what we send "elsewhere" for crissakes

My spirit is sustained with Irish music and so this is a worthwhile
endeavour that I am embarked upon I submit with care
