Countdown with Keith Olbermann from Current.TV - Wednesday, Sept. 7, 2011

*** Sorry for the crappy video on this one; that's how it was in the source. IMO, it's just this side of acceptable quality for a watch-it-once-then-toss-it program.

Guests include:
o  Brian Beutler: reporter for Talking Points Memo
o  Markos Moulitsas: founder and publisher of Daily Kos
o  Ken Vogel: reporter for Politico
o  Karl Frisch: syndicated columnist, Democratic strategist
o  Christian Finnegan: stand-up comedian, actor

"Please watch Keith on Current if you can get the channel, harass your cable company if you cannot. Keep celebrating freedom of news."
