,desi_superhero,2011-12-11T22:49Z,"Quality for Bluray-rip:
Video: 7/10 
Audio: 9/10 
The official Bluray release itself was of bad quality.
Movie:
3/5 stars
Ive noticed that although the audio quality is almost excellent, the WAF team doesn't really focus on video quality. Strange!
Thanks anyways."
