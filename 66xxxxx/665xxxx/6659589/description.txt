Please read this first, this has been encoded as high def, it is still a m4v and works fine on apple tv. I HAVE NOT TESTED THIS ON AN IPOD REPEAT NOT TESTED. 
If some could test it for me and comment that would be FAB and I will start posting both normal and HD Films (my Ipod is busted at the moment)

Have a good one :)






A vision of an apocalyptic future set in the wastelands of Australia. Total social decay is just around the corner in this spectacular cheap budget gang orientated road movie. Where the cops do their best to lay down the law and the outlaw gangs try their hardest to defy the system. Leather clad Max Rockatansky husband, father and cop turns judge, juror and executioner after his best friend, wife and baby are killed. Here we see the final days of normality of a man who had everything to live for, and his slip into the abyss of madness. Mad Max is the antihero on the road to vengeance and oblivion.
