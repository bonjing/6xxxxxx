,addy53,2011-09-06T11:54Z,how do you uncompress the file ?
,G-Unit_Hacker,2011-09-07T09:55Z,"@addy53 : Its a 2 parted .rar file, So youll need WinRAR. If you do, Just open any part, Then wait for it to read the files(a couple of seconds). Then select the folder that appears(named 'CS Source' and click on 'Extract To'. No installation needed, So just extract and open the Start.bat."
,G-Unit_Hacker,2011-09-07T09:58Z,"@Pennywise4333 : I don't know exactly , Now there is only 2 seeders, Me and someone else, And 100 peers( That's what uTorrent says, It's more accurate than PB )"

,G-Unit_Hacker,2011-09-18T10:11Z,"@passafire94 : 
A  - It's a bug found in CS:S. Right-Click the server, Click on 'Details', Copy the address( Looks Like : XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:XXXX ). Open up the console( press ` ), Type ""Connect {PAST ADDRESS HERE}"" and hit enter.
B - If that didn't work, It means the server is down."
,G-Unit_Hacker,2011-09-18T10:12Z,"@passafire94 : 
A - Its a bug, Just copy the server's address( right-click the server and click 'Details', youll find it there), Open the console, And type ""CONNECT {THE ADDRESS}"". 
B - It A didn't work, The server is down."
