I really appreciate what you think of the game as it is very special for me"
,petar4o0o94,2011-09-08T02:01Z,"1 HINT YOU COULD USE:

When your melee soldiers are turned against the enemy and attacking hit pause and repeat this combination multiple times:
Halt (deafult Z) + right click on the attacked enemy...repeating that combination at the right time adds for example 10 combinations = 20 attacks in the time of 1...very useful against hords of undead"
,petar4o0o94,2011-09-08T02:01Z,10* attacks i meant..not 20

,petar4o0o94,2011-09-11T11:16Z,"On mission ""The renegade shaman"" kill as much as possible orks on the bridge before you clean the altars to gain experiance..use the hint i gave in a comment above to do that..you will need the upgrades in the character menu (hit C) and atleast 3rd lv spells..also mana over 450.

There is a mission where you have to blow a cave from which undead come in armies..if you have to kill an army head for the mages/shamans first.."
,petar4o0o94,2011-09-11T11:18Z,"IF YOU HAVE DIFICULTIES ON A MISSION

leave me a comment where you cant pass something..i will make a video of the mission and give you the link :)"
