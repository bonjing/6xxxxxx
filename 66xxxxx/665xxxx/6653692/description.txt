There are a few torrents out there for the Main soundtrack, one or two for the album edition (Although they're both .Flac which I hate) and none I could find for the EP (Used to be one, must have gone down).
I'm a big fan of the music of this game so I managed to track down all the tracks and decided to upload them all as one Torrent.

The Main OST I got off the CD, so shouldn't be any problems there.
The Album edition I got off one of the aforementioned Torrents, but I changed it from a .Flac to a bunch of .mp3's for convenience. 
The EP was no where to be found so I had to resort to some sketchier methods to acquire it.

If there's any problems with any of the files let me know and I'll see what I can do.


I can't Seed that much, long story,  During the week I should be Seeding from about 3pm-10pm (EST) unless there's a problem.  On the weekends I can Seed more.
So I'd really appreciate it if people would help with Seeding.
