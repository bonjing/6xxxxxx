Filmmaker Miguel Kohan offers an affectionate tribute to the grand old men and women of tango in this documentary tracing the career of the exceptional musicians from the 1940s through the new millennium. While some outsiders see tango as simply a dance, to many Argentineans it is literally a way of life - especially the citizens of such cities as Buenos Aires, Montevideo, and Rosario. Within these cities dwell some of the very same people who drive tango to popularity back in the 1940s and 50s, some of them still performing the same dances that they did during the golden age of tango. Argentine composer and musician Gustavo Santaollala acquaints viewers with such notable tango personalities as Leopoldo Federico, LÃ¡grima RÃ­os, Luis Stazo, and famed duo JosÃ© Libertella and Luis Stazo in a film that inter-cuts their personal memories with unforgettable performance footage that climaxes at a joint tango evening at Buenos Aires' renowned Teatro ColÃ³n.
