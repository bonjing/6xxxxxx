,spifkitten99,2011-09-06T18:31Z,"What is the point of splitting it in two?

Does any human being still use CD's for movies? I think not."

,markdbsilva,2011-09-07T12:49Z,Post real and working. nice quality. tnx :)
,godzvilla,2011-09-07T13:21Z,About half way through it keeps jumping backwards and repeating and mixing up with another part of the movie/going out of sync - lasts about 5 mins - other than that fine and watchable....just have to fast forward through it
,huejardon247,2011-09-07T14:34Z,"You fuckin' muppets who ares still burning your films onto discs (DVD-r), etc, are in the dark ages. Get yourself a media player and download HD movies, porn and stuff. You might as well get a flash drive than buy all those discs and then you have to store them. Get a life!!!!!!!!!! or a 2tb Screenplay Media Player, about ÂŁ180. A good investment that will pay for itself in about 3 months."
,feared7,2011-09-07T18:12Z,hey extremezone please can you upload hangover 2
[V],MeRaDil,2011-09-07T21:24Z,"Use a merge tool like Ultra Video Joiner to merge the videos in to one file.
Or buy an HD Mediaplayer,because thats much easier than burn to disc.
THANKS for the up,you're the best."

,elcapizzo,2011-09-25T10:25Z,"This has Tim Heidecker from Tim and Eric Awesome Show in it, as well as Matt Lucas from Little Britain!

Win!

Quality is good, sound a bit quiet. Annoying though as this has been broken into two separate files though.

V/8
A/8"
