Two videotaped hearings from Obama's Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues held on March 1, 2011 and May 18 and 19, 2011. 

Victims (aka targeted individuals) of government mind control, covert implantation, weapons testing, and other egregious human rights violations speak to Obama's commission.   

Also a self-recorded video by Helen Kurdin of Canada reading her open letter to the Prime Minister asking him to put a stop to these abuses.


You or someone you care about might be the next victim.    

Also be sure to download the original "Covert Implantation of Radiotelepathy Neurotechnology" torrent (without the index number after it) which contains a wealth of additional related information.
