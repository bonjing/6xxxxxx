,lancelight,2011-12-08T03:35Z,"This torrent needs to be removed.  The app DOES NOT WORK.  It's an UNCRACKED trial version with a keygen that works and a patch that DOES NOT.  The keygen works, it will register with the ""patched"" .exe's after you have ""patched"" it (directly after install and BEFORE reboot) but when your machine comes back up and you try to ""enable"" (the icon should turn from grey to green I think, the color changes, I forget what color its suppose to be, but it wont turn colors and reports an error instead), the exe reports ""This is not the original, please re-install the original and try again"" or something like that, I dont remember the full error and dont really care because this is just crapware.

If you try using it WITHOUT the patch, the keygen works, but then it immediately EXPIRES the trial and asks you to buy it.

epic FAIL."
