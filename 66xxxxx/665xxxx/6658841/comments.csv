[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-07T21:59Z,"THere was a duplicate page in this - almost feels like it was missing one too. I really liked it - Only good thing about relaunch is Babs back as BG, I literrally just Read Batgirl Year One yday, highly recommend it:

,Rag318,2011-09-07T22:02Z,"Hey, just a heads up, there seems to be a copy of page 11 where page 14 should be."
,DisarmingWhitemouse,2011-09-07T22:03Z,had to register a username and everything just to say...awesome job...thank you so much for this and the other New 52 titles you've brought us today

[V],GunningHawk90,2011-09-07T22:16Z,"Yeah, I saw it too."
,adrianos1995,2011-09-07T22:59Z,Are you going to send all the new 52 ?
,adrianos1995,2011-09-07T23:02Z,"will you send all the 52?
By the way, i think there's a missing page

,dclebeau,2011-09-08T00:22Z,"For whatever reason, this won't download.  None of GH90's torrents seem to work for me.  I am getting a connection error.  I downloaded Action Comics just fine though.

Anyone have any suggestions?"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-08T00:26Z,"There is no need to request any of the New 52, they will ALL be uploaded as they become available - just keep checking back"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-08T00:27Z,"@dclebeau

Thats strange - try the 'MAGNET LINK' instead"
,synchronicityii,2011-09-08T02:06Z,"Thanks for the upload! 

As others have mentioned, there is a missing page.. will you be adding that back in at some point?"
,adrianos1995,2011-09-08T02:26Z,"Ok thank you, i just asked because i'm going to use the reboot to try to acompany as far as i can every DC comic"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-08T02:43Z,"As per the extra/missing page - Right now the Green-giant scan is the only source of BG1, as soon as a FIXED copy is scanned/uploaded one of us will put it here. I read my copy and there does appear to be a jump from Barbara talking to her dad to when she's moving in (where the duplicated page is) but I doubt that we missed any vital info. IMHO"
,jds061980,2011-09-08T02:57Z,"Thank You for the upload, but are we going to get a corrected release with the missing page?"
,jds061980,2011-09-08T02:58Z,sorry Dogtown your post had not posted till after i posted mine = )
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-08T04:10Z,"Yeah I honestly dont know if there IS a missing page, may just be one extra page, but if there is we just missed meeting her roomy like you said. But since everyone and their mother is upset about it, Im sure fixed will be up soon enough. Funny that of all th 52 Im most excited for Batgirl and sounds like everyone else too"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-08T16:35Z,"Here is the FIXED Batgirl #1:
