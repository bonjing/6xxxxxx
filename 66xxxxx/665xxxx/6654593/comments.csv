,diamondcutter,2011-09-06T13:10Z,"Is this really 37? I one named 35, but it seems that there is another one after that. I will post it but think it is not right"
,xelaresom,2011-09-06T15:22Z,"what? 35 is missing, this says 36....."
,DngnRdr,2011-09-06T16:00Z,"If there's any dispute over what episode you have or episode numbering... http://therenovatorstv.com.au/episodes.htm lists the episode number, airdate (AEST) and a brief description (may be spoilers if you haven't seen episodes). "
,diamondcutter,2011-09-06T18:08Z,"Let me rephrase that comment in English. I was asking is this episode actually 37, not 36, as I have one called 35 downloaded last week, and this one seems to have skipped and episode with challenges that were previewed at the end of 35."
,diamondcutter,2011-09-06T18:18Z,"Yes good link DngnRdr, seems the 35 I have is actually 34. Not sure how this happened."
,XaltedSmoke,2011-09-06T18:21Z,"Bryentheartist....  Read the description...
And I am NOT a baby girl...

That being said, episode 35 was finally located and episode 37 is on its was as well.  I will upload both within the hour.

To clear up any confusion this file is correctly labeled. This IS episode 36."
,bryentheartist,2011-09-06T21:45Z,was only kidding when I called you baby girl. thanks for the uploads.
