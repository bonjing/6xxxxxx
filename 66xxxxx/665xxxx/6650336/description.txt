Alex Terry, an Australian who plays the blues as if he grew up in Chicago, presents his first studio CD: Goin' Down Slow. Together with his band, Alex sings and plays that Mississippi saxophone (blues harmonica, that is) on a number of blues classics, all performed with taste, raw power, and that magic touch of Chicago smoke!
