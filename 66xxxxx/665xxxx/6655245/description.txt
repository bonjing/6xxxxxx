The Mystery of the Crystal Portal 2: Beyond the Horizon, the sequel to the original Mystery of the Crystal Portal, promises to be a compelling hidden object game. You get a wonderful possibility to continue your fascinating adventure filled with uncovered secrets and unsolved puzzles.

Like in the first Mystery of the Crystal Portal, you play the role of a young journalist Nicole Rankwist, whose father went missing after he discovered something very importantâ€¦ something which can "change the cause of humanity." Nicole managed to activate the Crystal Portal in her fatherâ€™s basement in hope to find him.

You will travel the globe and visit the most beautiful and incredible spots of the world including the legendary floating islands. The Mystery of the Crystal Portal 2: Beyond the Horizon is not an ordinary hidden object game. It has a challenging gameplay which is borrowed from its prequel.

Like the first episode, The Mystery of the Crystal Portal 2: Beyond the Horizon scenes are filled with various types of items: key objects, normal objects, and containers. Key objects open a small menu which you need to fill with the normal items shown in this menu. 

Containers are items which can be examined more closely. Very often containers involve small puzzles. You just need to assemble the item inside the container before you can pick it up. Sometimes an object can be both a key object and a container

The Mystery of the Crystal Portal 2: Beyond the Horizon will make you switch between different locations in order to find a required item and complete a definite task. In a word, you perform an interrelated succession of actions in order to move further.

The Mystery of the Crystal Portal 2: Beyond the Horizon has a number of mini-games from common jigsaw puzzles to quite original and fun mini-games.

The game has two modes of play: Casual and Advanced. As opposed to the original Mystery of the Crystal Portal, the sequel has a more considered hint system. Now hints reveal both key and normal items at a time so that you know where the item can go to.

The Mystery of the Crystal Portal 2: Beyond the Horizon game features attractive graphics with lots of animated details and pleasing sounding which helps to create an amazing atmosphere.
