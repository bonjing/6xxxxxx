,GoatDancer,2011-09-07T11:07Z,There's a beta? The release date isn't even posted yet.
,The4X3R,2011-09-07T11:25Z,"no use if don't have the beta key
but good upload, anyway"
,Netarangi,2011-09-07T11:33Z,Legit. Beta is out..
,GoatDancer,2011-09-07T11:44Z,Lala
,BloodBroHS,2011-09-07T11:52Z,.
,Espionage724,2011-09-07T16:31Z,"Yep this is legit, but useless unless your in the beta. Right now, Friends and Family Beta is going on."
,Sagiy20,2011-09-07T19:00Z,"@Espionage724 ""in case Blizzard's servers are overloaded""
- Nice! Nice upload!
Good of you to care for the community like that. :)

I'm dying to get a beta key... ah.."
,draco74,2011-09-07T20:05Z,"@ALL

[T],swebarb,2011-09-07T21:49Z,"To crack this and play u gonna have to emulate the server, and that wont happen probably as u can only play online and not solo."
,ZtorkX86,2011-09-07T22:04Z,swebarb@ Are you sure or just guessing? I will sure to keep it downloaded in case it gets cracked. It's a pity they left out SP and LAN. :(
,Espionage724,2011-09-07T23:00Z,"If a crack were to surface, I would keep an eye out on DarkBlizz.org (they cracked SC2 Beta, and I believe have the SC2 LAN program there too)"
,Whobuysgames,2011-09-08T06:05Z,"this game is fully online, cant be cracked. though if someone hosted a free private server, thats a possibility"
,MeSaber,2011-09-08T09:24Z,where the heck did you find this? i have no beta diablo 3 download in my battle.net account..
,MeSaber,2011-09-08T09:26Z,so where do u download this if not in this torrent?
,hergiyone,2011-09-08T09:45Z,WORKS ?
,Espionage724,2011-09-08T10:01Z,"@MeSaber
There are links online that lead to the beta client downloader straight off of Blizzard's servers (if I heard right, reddit had links, if not, DarkBlizz has them too still)"
,Espionage724,2011-09-08T10:02Z,"@hergiyone
If your in the F&F Beta, yes, if not, you stare at a login screen pretty much

Also, there was an update recently, so after you download this, run the Launcher to patch up :p"
,TheDank,2011-09-08T13:48Z,"download link for the first download:
http://us.media.battle.net.edgesuite.net/downloads/d3-installers/4de82d80-ddeb-4e61-80ae-b4e8817f54b0/Diablo-III-Beta-enUS-Setup.exe

it ends up downloading this torrent basically (not THIS torrent specifically just the same files from their servers)"
,0xalis,2011-09-08T23:44Z,"They cracked the SC2 beta which you need to be online for, maybe they'll find a similar way to do it for D3? 
SC2 had the loader that put you in a game with PCs, maybe they'll find a way to pass the character creation and online stuff and you just start with a character class you select from the loader.
I definitely think it'll be possible to crack this, in the mean time let's all pray for a beta key lol."
,7m3sgte,2011-09-09T16:26Z,yes lets get a crack like sc2 beta did... please? lol
,crazybaby,2011-09-10T18:36Z,"D3, char selection creation screen cracked. Just the char creation selection section. So dont think u can play game . Ä°nstall update beta, backup .exe's. download this ( search google Diablo_III_-_hero.rar )  , and rename Diablo III - hero.exe to Diablo III.exe. Open game with launcher and have fun chars.  "
,ZtorkX86,2011-09-10T21:12Z,crazychar: haha. Well I guess then we can save two seconds it takes to pick one and create a name before a playing crack surfices.
,cooper125,2011-09-11T03:38Z,"-crazychar
urm you can't really reserve a name unless your on Blizzard's servers"
,cooper125,2011-09-11T05:58Z,"sry, I was talking to ZtorkX86"
,crazybaby,2011-09-11T14:35Z,For d3 beta crack server development follow #diablo3dev at twitter. and http://i.imgur.com/5HC3f.jpg
,ZtorkX86,2011-09-12T06:16Z,"cooper125@ Uhm, I assumed that whatever crack arrives it won't let you play on blizzards server so if there's emulated servers or somehow offline play the name won't be an issue.."
,victorfa1,2011-09-12T13:34Z,man... i'm afraid that... diablo 3 will be paid like starcraft 2... and... crack maybe never released :S
,Alzitar,2011-09-12T14:49Z,LoL diablo 3 will most probably give you years of entertainment.. so that would surmount to like paying 0.05 cent a day to play :P which makes it the cheapest entertainment around apart from entertainment that needs nothing ;) Well worth any price tbh.. cant wait!
,Real1tYofficial,2011-09-13T21:42Z,lol is this for real? can u play offline // single player??
,omenofgod,2011-09-14T12:07Z,"@Real1tYofficial no Diablo III will always require an internet connection to play there is no offline single player. There is/will be however a ""invitation only"" play mode in which you can play solo. Any/all Diablo iii cracks will be server emulations either going to other servers or a downloadable local host server."
,rezvia,2011-09-16T14:21Z,can i play offline in this game?
,dorknoob,2011-09-18T03:18Z,"so diablo 3 with be a p2p mmo? interesting. i plan to keep an eye out for private servers. who knows, i may even end up paying for it."
,lordsarum,2011-09-18T18:04Z,"Ehh guys, as may said before, there will be no crack for D3, instead there could be a private server, but i wouldnt think that thay will be able to make a decant server in next half a year at least, but playing on random server in D3 its like playing wow on some shity website, instead, preorder the game NOW before it gone up in price.. and go on blizzard and aply for oficual beta test,, and be happy XD"
,lordsarum,2011-09-18T18:06Z,"ohha nd if you are a decant player, you can make your money back for the game from the new marketpleace which now oficualy will be using real money, so you can actualy sell items for cash dollors, and i wouldn think it will take long to pay back for the game, and its not like wow, you dont have any subsription, you just pay for the game and thats it. and atm its around 50$ so DO IT"
,XIIIxaros1966XIII,2011-09-20T22:30Z,play offline DIII
,XIIIxaros1966XIII,2011-09-20T22:33Z,up to now you can only play as DH and explore tristan with no interacts
,Kalarm,2011-09-21T00:13Z,"Something you need to not forget about the possible ""crack"" is that while SC2 did end up being cracked. It took quite some time. When I got my invite to the beta we were only able to play against player created AI's. I don't even know if they ended up being able to play against other players or not.

What does that do for D3? It means there is high probabilities that the crack will only be able to have content made by the crackers themselves as they won't have access to the real thing. If they have access to the actual beta, they might take time to re-create the world as it is in beta, but that is pretty unlikely.

So just don't get your hopes too high for the crack and enjoy whatever bits of content they crack :)."
,Espionage724,2011-09-23T23:46Z,"Go to dark blizzard's site if you want news on how emulator work is progressing. As of now, you can enter the word as either a Demon Hunter or Monk, and ONLY walk through Tristram. Can't cast spells, can't walk far out of town, can't interact with anyone or anything."
,kostur3870,2011-09-25T01:55Z,"i downloaded DIII beta from this shit http://www.kat.ph/diablo-iii-beta-the-game-v-0-3-0-7338-beta-%D9%A0-t5850293.html
its working but u cannot interact with ure character trough the city of Tristarm. but its still fun! guy who made this said that problem will b fixed soon "
,goodie90,2011-10-21T16:59Z,how can i enter the game?? i eed usename and pass
,Espionage724,2011-10-29T18:59Z,"Go to DarkBlizz for all emulation needs. As of right now, you can enter the world on any character, and cast spells, gain XP, and etc. You have to spawn monsters in though."
,kulu88,2012-01-16T10:17Z,"hey guys, i am pretty new here as a user, till now i was only a guest, downloaded stuff and seeded it. so please forgive me for any mistake if i do.

i read all the comments on this torrent and downloaded the torrent as well, but i am still stuck at the same level i guess as everybody here is, i couldnt login to battle.net due lack of licence and i couldnt emulate the game, they way you all have described here...please help."
,CinMac,2012-02-03T10:40Z,"Hi, I keep getting the message: ""Error: Element not found"", can somebody help me please."
,Balverine,2012-02-09T22:45Z,"@Kalarm:

Or you could just not be a stupid fuck and just buy the game."
,Gliktch,2012-02-12T12:01Z,"Yeah, gotta agree with Balverine on this one...  I'm as much a fan of pirating (and messing about with emulation) as anyone, having played on, worked on and administrated gameservers in the past, but if there was ever a game worth paying retail for, this is it.

Well, that's judging by the quality of D2/LoD, but I guess I'm an optimist...  ;)"
,.235.,2012-02-18T04:27Z,"I'm sorry, (not really...) but.. how the hell are you supposed to buy something that hasn't been released yet?
fuckin duh.
and I gotta say those are tw owords I have NEVER heard in a sentence before...
Diablo2 and quality."
