Portugal, late sixties. TomÃ¡s Palma Bravo, the Dauphin, is the heir to a world in decay. He is the master of the Lagoon, of Maria das MercÃªs, his barren wife, of Domingos, his black, one-armed manservant, of a mastiff and of an E-type Jaguar, which takes him to Lisbon and to the prostitutes.

A hunter, who is a detective and the narrator, returns to the lagoon every year to hunt ducks. A year later he discovers that Domingos has been found dead in bed in the house belonging to the Palma Bravo couple, and that Maria das MercÃªs was found floating in the Lagoon. TomÃ¡s Palma Bravo and his mastiff are said to have disappeared without trace. And mysterious barking sounds can now be heard coming from the mist over the Lagoon.
