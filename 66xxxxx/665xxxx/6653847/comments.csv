,11002,2011-09-27T01:07Z,"great quality, you just kinda have the same track for the 1st and 2nd songs. the 1st is the wrong one, so if you could fix it it'd be super amazing"
,Mysantheropy,2011-10-08T07:07Z,"Alright, alright. So the album gets a 4.1/5 from me.
xGcPx, you're missing song 7.
Affirmation of Ascension is a copy of Behind the Curtain. Thanks for the upload, but lets get this fixed for future seeders.
Oh, and fix the track order."
,bk12321,2011-10-13T06:22Z,"As other have stated, first/second song are copies. I still gave this a +, since this CD is simply amazing. Intake is top notch."
,xGcPx,2011-10-19T19:00Z,I got the CD well before its release so I never had the track order. The 1st and 2nd song being the same is purely me being stupid. I'll fix this ASAP.
,Allovt,2012-01-12T22:09Z,"Speedy download, great quality. I will begin seeding! Thanks!"
,blackestsheep,2012-03-07T01:39Z,"uh  yeah  this torrent is fine quality  but like other noted the first two  songs are exactly the same..so it was never fixed..otherwise great torrent..very very heavy  deathcore  type if you like that sort of thing

thanks"
