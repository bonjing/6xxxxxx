Without these folders you will not get your saves! Copy them over, or create them, as they are originally empty. Good luck, and I hope this helps."

,TheZentetsu,2011-09-07T04:20Z,"Ok, so I did what Ithink said to do about the out folder but it did not work.. So I started thinking he is on to something because it needs folders to save to. So I uninstalled the game and re-installed orginalDead.Island.Cracked.Fullrepack-ALI213 [.Dude.[ put an out folder in the main directory and then inside the out folder put Profiles and a Save folder.. Restarted game and got to a save point exit the game and bam! The continue icon poped up, got out of the game went to windows restarted game and it works now with saves and key bindings saved also.. I Have not used this update yet but I'm thinking you can as long as your out folder is in the main directory.... Update it works with this update also.. You may be able to just make a out folder in main directory like ithink said put a save and profile folder inside of the out, just do not put the folder in the DI folder keep outside of that."

I'm here to confirm that this DOES work! I've been playing for a few hours. I don't believe it saves (could be wrong) but just to make sure My friends make sure they drop out of the game right before a quest turn-in if they want to save. Dropping out will just convert it to a single-player game, so don't worry about it fucking everything up!

,morbalbtman,2011-09-07T15:05Z,dont know why you'd want it because it sucks!
,us4always,2011-09-07T15:05Z,"@ Seminkou There's a little more to it than that if you have the STEAM.UNLOCKED-ALI213 version of the game. You do make an out folder in the game directory with 2 sub folders in it with 1 named profiles and 1 named save. But with the version of the game I'm talking about, if you open the DI folder there is also a folder in there named Out, yes with a capital O. What I did is start the game and get to the first checkpoint coming out of the elevator, then I quit the game completely and went to my documents folder. In there a Dead Island folder has appeared and when you open that there is another out folder like the one you created in your game directory. I had to copy the contens within the out folder and paste them in the out folder I created in the first place. Now back to the other folder named Out in the DI folder, I had to delete this folder for it to finally save my games. So to sum up, create out folder in game directory, open that folder and create 2 more folders, 1 named profiles and another named save. Start the game and get to the first checkpoint then quit to desktop. Now the Dead Island folder will be in your Documents folder. Open that folder then open the out folder and copy the contents to the out folder you created. Now go to your game directory and open the folder named DI, and delete the folder in there named Out. Start the game again and get to the checkpoint, quit to the menu and you should be ablle to click continue. Not sure how much clearer I can explain it than that, Hope this helps someone as it took me awhile to figure this out as I really wanted the ALI213 version because I feel it looks the best and is the best quality. 
Take care all and enjoy!"

[quote]Can anyone give me serial key so i can install the game please ? [/quote]
When you install the reloaded one you have to mount it as iso and run the backup setup and pick a folder. Then after that you open the crack folder and copy and paste into game directory of where the backupsetup.exe put it. Then with this update you unrar it to where your game is installed and overwrite files. 

The reason your getting serial key is probably one of two things. One you tried to unrar iso and run setup from steam which will ask for serial. Or 2 your not setting your game to single player in options. By default its multiplayer mode. So try changing that. I have no serial popup. Only way you can do CO-Op with ppl is lan game and using Hamachi or steam cracked version...  "

,Delfs1970,2011-09-08T22:37Z,"It works for me but the loading times are very long, almost a 5 min wait for the loading of the start or next level.  I seen a few people getting this, but I see no answer on how to correct.  Game runs great when it is loaded but the loading is my only complaint."
,Delfs1970,2011-09-08T22:45Z,"I am running AMD phenom 2 X4, Realtec audio on the mother board, 4 gigs ram, and 4850 512mb video card, and this game runs great.  I have no problem with sound or graphics.  The bloom effect is sort of lame and would love to configure the graphics more but they don't have the options for that.  Like I said before loading is a long ass wait.  Check all your drivers and if it is not the drivers you hardware might be out of date if your having trouble?"

,Delfs1970,2011-09-09T13:43Z,Well I'll be damned I found a correction to the long load times and I really can't believe it worked.  Look for the Crash log file.  Depending on how it is installed on your PC it could be in Dead Island Main or under Documents?  I did a search in the main and simply right clicked on it and set it to READ ONLY!!  BAM!!!  Problem solved and runs/loads like a champ now!!!!

When starting a new character, simply go to the chapter that was last available to you.

I found that the save file is in your steam userdata and there is an out folder in there with the profile and save. It looks like when we update, the game updates but it then can no longer read the save from the previous version. Not sure how to correct this.

Apparently legit steam users got their saves patched."
