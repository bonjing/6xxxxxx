By the way, uTorrent for Mac wasn't connecting to the server for this or the 64K version.  99% of the time it does though. So if anyone else is having that issue, use another client.

Transmission works great!"

,Bitchley,2011-09-06T20:23Z,"Funny, I'm having trouble with Transmission. Thanks for your amazing ups Wush!"
,jspyder24,2011-09-06T20:33Z,"@TheExecutive, if you have a mac then transmission the way to go. Used it for about three years and love it. 
Also, I am so happy to have Stern! I prefer downloading from sterngeek, but this'll do. "

SternGeek just steals our rips and relabels them as his own.   So how it could be better is beyond me.  It's the same exact files."
