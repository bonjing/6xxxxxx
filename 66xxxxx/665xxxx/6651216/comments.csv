,gamer13_,2012-05-12T12:19Z,720x624 is not 720p (720p would be 1280x720). this vid is dvd resolution. just clarifying.
,gamer13_,2012-05-12T12:41Z,"oh wait, the screenshots are 1050x624... i guess it's a display aspect ratio thing. so technically it displays at around 720p, but it's not really full res. it might be higher res than dvd, but it'd be an upscale anyway since it claims dvd as source.

confusing. but i'm not commenting negatively or positively on quality, just wanted to clear up the HD claim. (check the screenshots for quality)"
