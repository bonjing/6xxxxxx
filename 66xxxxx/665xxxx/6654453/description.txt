Lz0 released new version of â€DevExtras Print Screenâ€. DevExtras Print Screen is a simple yet advanced screen capture and image editing tool for Microsoft Windows 7, Vista and XP.

Description: Microsoft Windows comes with a built in facility for capturing the screen contents. Pressing the Print Screen key on your windows keyboard will copy an image of the screen onto the clipboard that can then be pasted into any graphics program. DevExtras Print Screen enhances this screen capture functionality by providing on-screen selection to define exactly what is copied, an image editor to make minor adjustments/annotate the captured image and finally options on what to do with the image other than simply copying it to the clipboard.
