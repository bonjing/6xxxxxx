We found this 160k bitrate 2CD set on the net with no filenames or mp3tags
and spent a few minutes getting it all prepped for you and getting
all that was missing filled in using great software programs that work
miracles for you such as mp3 tag&rename in addition to mp3tag.

In addition, we have added some nice bonus tracks so that its a truly outstanding
lineup especially, in addition to some of the greatest of Lanza's songs 
most of which were otherwise already included in this 2CD set.

Mr. Mario Lanza is one of the greatest voices of our time and this offering
is a comprehensive collection of his greatest works.
