CM8 brings a TS for Larry Crowne. The audio was taken from the PPVRip but the video from the cam was still better than the PPVRip video, so in fact this Telesync is better than the PPVRip since the video quality of the cam was a lot better. Check the video sample to review it yourself.
Plot: Until he was downsized, affable, amiable Larry Crowne (Tom Hanks) was a superstar team leader at the big-box company where heâ€™s worked since his time in the Navy. Underwater on his mortgage and unclear on what to do with his suddenly free days, Larry heads to his local college to start over. There he becomes part of a colorful community of outcasts, also-rans and the overlooked all trying to find a better future for themselvesâ€¦often moving around town in a herd of scooters. In his public-speaking class, Larry develops an unexpected crush on his teacher Mercedes Tainot (Julia Roberts), who has lost as much passion for teaching as she has for her husband.
