https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6023120

and btw. torrents, once published aren't owned by anyone - they belong to the public, but it's pointless to make a dupe of an existing well seeded torrent."
,tikitikitattoo,2011-09-06T22:59Z,"i see your point but this wus a test and it sounds like it worked. thanks 
so you got any advice ??
more trackers maybe ??"
[H],BigNoise,2011-09-07T21:53Z,"hm, yes it worked because i was seeding it after i obtained the data from the torrent mentioned in my prev. comment.
Adding tracker(s) won't do a thing in this regard.
I guess you don't have a port forwarded to the machine that runs the bittorrent client, so no interested peer can contact you.
For more info/help visit the suprbay forum."
