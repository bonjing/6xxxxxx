Amaretto

Creative, complex, beautiful sophistimicated progressive house and trance music. This is the first disc by Black Berry Recordings, a branch off of Diverse System, this time led by MAYA AKAI. If you know anything about MAYA AKAI, it's that he makes some dang good trance. The album is excellent, if you like trance or progressive house (with no lyrics I might add), give the album a shot. Don't be fooled by the generic cover art, there is a lot here.
