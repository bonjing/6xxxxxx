This time Max and Stacy discuss stiffing the dead in Illinois and reviving the carry trade in Iceland. 

In the second half of the show Max talks to Mike Maloney of GoldSilver.com about how high gold would have to go to account for all the money printing since Bernanke took over the Fed.     



The .mp3 in the torrent is audio extracted from the Russia Today video. You can watch the video online at:

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
