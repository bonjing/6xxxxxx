,karly_w,2011-09-07T14:18Z,"Thanks for this update. I expect that I'll be able to upload a few more in the next couple of days - most likely:
CD 20 - Uncursed
CD 22 - Memories
CD 23 - Effectiveness
and I'm going to get either CD 32 or 33 if anyone has a preference.

If anyone else would care to fill in the gaps... feel free. :-*
