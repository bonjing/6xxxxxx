,O_P_E,2011-09-10T23:02Z,"shiva: A wench of the high seas you're talking to, hope it's useful.
man: Don't have the textbook unfortunately.
7: Wrong edition? Could be 8th ed? Let me know if you can tell."
,7plays,2011-09-11T20:48Z,"Seems like it's a completely different book, the textbook is posted http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6658163/Boyce_-_Elementary_Differential_Equations__amp__BVP_9th_-_txtbk, but comparing the questions, they don't seem like they belong to the same book"
,gangasf,2011-09-14T02:15Z,These solutions are actually for a text called Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications 6th Ed
,dementedmonkay,2011-11-30T16:34Z,yeah this isn't the Boyce book at all..
