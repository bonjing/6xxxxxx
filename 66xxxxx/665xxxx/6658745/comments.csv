,Lunatrius,2011-09-07T22:29Z,"Tagged? As in ID3 tags or just plain names?

The *.log files that are in the folders include the original title and the description, taken from Youtube."
,luvtpb123,2011-09-08T00:45Z,"yeah i mean ID/ID3 tags, so the .logs are from each utube description? ah okay, but are the mp3's just titled or tagged is my question, sorry if unclear:) this looks like a great torrent"
,Lunatrius,2011-09-08T12:21Z,No tags in the MP3s. I plan to add tags once I have all 1000 songs.
,Lunatrius,2011-09-08T17:59Z,"Got the script working. The 1000 batch torrent will have ID3 tags included. Until then, enjoy XxImmortalmagexX's music compilation. :)"
