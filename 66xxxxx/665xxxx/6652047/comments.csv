Bring on the BONUS MATERIALS!

Besides, this is scenebalance, who are notorious for NOT seeding!"
,User897,2011-09-06T04:18Z,"Since this is sourced from the Blu-ray, it is important to list the correct year for this film.

This is the 2011 version, NOT the 1977 version."

Seriously, I'm a massive Star Wars fan but these changes you guys complain about are INSIGNIFICANT in terms of the movie.

Hell in most cases it adds to the films."

In that case you...

A. have just as little respect for the creators of the original effects and their work as Lucas does.

B. have little to no appreciation for the craft of making movies and it's history

C. Probably think that 'Anaconda' had pretty decent CGI, too, in which case you are not fit to have a worthwhile oppinion in this matter


Sorry, but continously ruining your own classics just bacause you're so terribly insecure about the value of your past work is a sad, sad fate."
