TvÃ¥ hÃ¥rda snutar, en engelsksprÃ¥kig och en fransktalande, buntas ihop fÃ¶r att finna en seriemÃ¶rdare som sÃ¤tter skrÃ¤ck i Kanads hockeyvÃ¤rld. De kommer inte riktigt Ã¶verens.


Martin Ward (Colm Feore - Paycheck) and David Bouchard (Patrick Huard - Stardom) could not be more different, one speaks English and is from Toronto, the other speaks French and is from Montreal. One obeys the law while the other makes his own. When a dead body is found draped over the border sign dividing Ontario and Quebec, they are forced to work together on the investigation and engage in a violent cat-and-mouse game with a deranged serial killer who is determined to keep the body count mounting.
