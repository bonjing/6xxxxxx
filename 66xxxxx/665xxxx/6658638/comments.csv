,abusiraj,2011-09-09T23:49Z,"@ Zeberzee, I've been waiting forever and a day to get the Star Wars Saga on Blu Ray (rip), and yours are the best rips I've found on-line. I haven't access to these films where I live, so I'm seriously hoping that you'll reconsider and upload the 3 prequel movies. I downloaded the first 3 from your uploads and they're great! Today's my B-day, and they were my present to myself!"
,TyMod,2011-09-16T02:12Z,"Yeah man,  I will download this weekend and seed for life.  Love the movies and you supply them at a reasonable size without quality lost.  So reconsider man. The Revenge of the Sith is my favorite."
,princeofpiracy,2011-09-30T21:47Z,Fuck the prequels!
,AnakinEv,2012-05-11T03:55Z,Awesome once again
