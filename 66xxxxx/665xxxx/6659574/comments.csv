someone has asked for the Hellraiser Collection to be uploaded which I'm uploading/FTP'ing now so should be back up later today.
Then (Depends on feeling wanted ) I have been asked for American Pie collection which I will add
If anyone can think of any old horror films they would like please comment.

Remember I currently only seed 40:1 unless someone asks and torrent speeds are unrestricted i.e should be fast"

Also I going to post a High Def m4v which I need someone to test on an IPOD (mine is busted something to do with droping it down the toliet ) but they work fine on APPLE TV. "

I can do all of these... but now, I only post when I get feedback/comments and Quality rating on newest/last post.
i.e not comment not rating no posting/torrent."
