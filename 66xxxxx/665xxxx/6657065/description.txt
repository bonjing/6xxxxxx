1 Corinthians 15:1-4
1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

2 Corinthians 5:18-21
18  And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;
19  To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.
20  Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s stead, be ye reconciled to God.
21  For he [God the Father] hath made him [Jesus Christ: God\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s only begotten Son, God in the flesh] to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

1 Timothy 2:3-7
3  For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
4  Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.
5  For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;
6  Who gave himself a ransom for ALL, to be testified in due time.
7  Whereunto I [Paul] am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.

Ephesians 2:8-9
8  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
9  Not of works, lest any man should boast.
