The one and only UK version of You Don't Know Jack!

This game doesn't install on modern Windows PCs but plays just fine, apart from the odd rare audio hiccup. No need to resort to some Virtual PC trickery to get the files installed, they are included in a seperate folder in this torrent along with the disc images.

Just mount the disc images with your tool of choice (i used Daemon Tools Lite myself) and run ydkj32.exe to play. People with stupidly high screen resolutions may wanna dial it down a few notches as otherwise you'll have to play in a small box in the center of the screen.
