â€œFor those who lunch alone, welcome to radio.â€

Mikel Rouseâ€™s Gravity Radio song cycle is instantly understandable yet inexplicably hard to explain.   I was incredibly psyched to get this disc and have listened to it quite regularly over the last 6 weeks or so.   It is a favorite of mine (and the whole house, for that matter, but I blogged about that already).   Playing this album for some of my students, they asked â€œWho is Mikel Rouse?â€   I think the best answer would be â€œMikel Rouse is todayâ€™s Schubert with better operas.â€   That just about covers it.

â€œLove comes to those who wait.   Those who wait for me.â€

The songs that make up this cycle all sound like effortless, high quality popular music.   Why songs like â€œWait For Meâ€ and â€œIâ€™m So Blueâ€ arenâ€™t on the radio, Iâ€™ll never know.   Binding the songs together are several AP new reports enmeshed with lyrics and other wonderful statements spoken with perfect inflection by Veanne Cox.   There is a veritable Gordion Knot of material here.   The disc is cyclic with melodic, textual, and rhythmic returns of events.

â€œIf you multiply my disappointment by the world, youâ€™ll see what I mean.   Multiply that by the animals eaten.â€

The sound quality on the disc is amazing.   What sounds effortless is actually some of the most nuanced and intricately orchestrated music Iâ€™ve encountered recently.   Every listen brings out something new, like Christina Pawlâ€™s trumpet playing.   There are times when you hear the trumpet but there are times when she is tucked into the texture.   With the exception of those that Iâ€™ve already mentioned and Penelope Thomasâ€™ backing vocals, Mikel Rouse performs everything.   Not only is he Schubert, he rivals Wagner in gesamtkunstwerk.

â€œI look at human beings and I see a freak show.â€

The best thing about this music is how complicated the songs are without sounding Complicated.   â€œIâ€™m So Blueâ€ is a rather weird song in many respects but you donâ€™t know that when you hear it.   Rouseâ€™s lyrics are so smart and tight in the verses that when the chorus is a simple â€œIâ€™m so blue/that I love youâ€ you can rest assured that he has exhausted any other way he might have had of saying the same thing.   â€œIâ€™m So Blueâ€ is also in a 7 beat meter but I didnâ€™t realize that for about a month of repeated listening.   Other favorites of mine are â€œWait For Me,â€ â€œSilence of Sound,â€ â€œStar Chamber/Rose Woods,â€ â€œStay in School,â€ and â€œThe World Got Away.â€

The songs are catchy, appealing, and detailed that you will be singing them to yourself for a while (my 4-year-old daughter was singing â€œSilence of Soundâ€ in the tub the other night).   You will also be mining the lyrics and such for Facebook and Twitter posts.   Chuck Norris wins.   Some songs are harder to get into.   â€œYawn Factoryâ€ was a tough sell on my ears but Iâ€™m into it now.   Iâ€™m not a fan of â€œBlue Book,â€ but I couldnâ€™t quite tell you why.   When I try, I end up telling you everything that I LIKE about â€œStar Chamber/Rose Woods.â€   Galen Brownâ€™s testimonial from last month can shed more light on this excellent disc.

â€œIâ€™ve traded knowledge for tape decks and beer.â€

I will point out that, with the holidays coming up, you have a music lover that would dig this disc a lot.   Everyone knows someone who will love this.   Do them the favor and pick up a copy for yourself.   Chuck Norris wins.
