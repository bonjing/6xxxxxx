Both beginning/novice amateur astronomers (at the level of Astronomy and Night Sky magazine readers), as well as more advanced amateur astronomers (level of Sky and Telescope) will find this book invaluable and fascinating. It includes detailed up-to-date information on sources, selection and use of virtually every major type, brand and model of such instruments on todayâ€™s market. The book also includes details on the latest released telescope lines, e.g. the 10-, 12-, 14- and 16-inch aperture models of the Meade LX-R series. As a former editor for Sky & Telescope, Astronomy, and Star & Sky magazines, the author is the ideal person to write this book.
