,Korashen,2011-09-05T19:27Z,"Ahhh, I might made a mistake... I got the Steam-Version unpacked with Phoenix, so I don't have a ""bin/game.exe"" at all. Might be the reason why it does not work..."
,dr00k,2011-09-09T23:21Z,"@Korashen

If it doesn't reopen after you close it, run unpack.bat again. That seemed to work for me. I don't have a bin\game.exe either! :("
