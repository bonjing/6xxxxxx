,Aypolo,2011-09-13T02:43Z,You're welcome :-)
,zombird,2011-09-15T06:18Z,"Thank you. I'm not sure if this is the same one on Demonoid but this one seems to work better for me. Very easy to extract and install, don't have to do anything else. It does take up a bit of resources, and I can't have anything else open really while I'm running this or it lags a bit, I suppose that could just be my computer. But it hasn't crashed or froze at all. Cheers."
