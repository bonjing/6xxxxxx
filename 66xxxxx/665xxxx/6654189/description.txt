Poet Roger McGough narrates the extraordinary story of how
a simple invention - the shipping container - changed the
world forever and forced Britain into the modern era of
globalisation.

With a blend of archive and modern-day filming, the incredible
impact of the box is told through the eyes of dockers,
seafarers, ship spotters, factory workers and logisticians.
From quayside in huge container ports to onboard ships the
size of four football pitches, the documentary explains how
the shipping container has transformed our communities,
economy and coastline
