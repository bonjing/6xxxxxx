,aa.sleuth,2011-10-20T12:31Z,Looked a little grainy for a 720p bluray. Your Thor rip looked much better than this one.
[V],3Li,2011-10-20T21:47Z,is exactly as it should be - grainy - like original source.
,igormilenkoski,2011-11-06T19:45Z,"Bravo,
grains look gives a special charm.
The original BD provides grained appearance.
Change NO. is perfect.
and expect something new from you in the MKV file.
MKV, DTS DVD5 and size."
,igormilenkoski,2011-11-06T19:48Z,...DVD5  size.
,igormilenkoski,2011-11-06T20:11Z,"BEST 720p DTS x264 UPLODER EVER
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK"
