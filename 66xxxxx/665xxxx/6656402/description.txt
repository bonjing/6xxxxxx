The cliche of classic rock guitar is one of riffs, solos and noise. But
write a list of great guitarists and their finest moments and a
quieter, more intense playing comes to the fore. The acoustic
guitar is the secret weapon in the armoury of the guitar hero, when
paradoxically they get more attention by playing quietly than being
loud.

This documentary takes an insightful and occasionally irreverent
look at the love affair between rock and the humble acoustic
guitar. Exploring a much less celebrated, yet crucial part of the
rock musician's arsenal, contributors including Johnny Marr, Keith
Richards, Ray Davies, James Dean Bradfield, Biffy Clyro, Joan
Armatrading, Donovan and Roger McGuinn discuss why an
instrument favoured by medieval minstrels and singing nuns is as
important to rock 'n' roll as the drums, bass and its noisy sister, the
electric guitar.
