Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny denounced what he called 'the dysfunction, disconnection, elitism - and the narcissism - that dominate the culture of the Vatican to this day'.

The astonishing attack was the first time that Ireland's Parliament has publicly castigated the Vatican instead of local church leaders during the country's 17 years of paedophile-priest scandals.

The controversial revelations have eroded Catholic authority in a nation where the church still owns most schools and several hospitals, and state-run broadcasters still toll a twice-daily call to Catholic prayer.

Nice so the Catholic church is screwed up so please feel free to post links showing where the Catholic church is raping enslaving and killing muslims and other non-Catholic and that they think their religion gives them the right to do it.I'll be waiting for the posts"
,4files,2011-09-06T23:55Z,"@bodthe dog the catholic church is not forcing people to not use contaception that is their choice that Catholic church does not kill people for leaving the church.Yes centuries ago the catholic church ravaged central america and lets not forget the spanish inquistion either but those horrors were centuries ago,Muslims today right now are raping enslaving and killing because there religion says it is o.k.
yes there were many horrors in the centuries past when mankind was more primitive however we are not in the Dark ages anymore and I would still like to hear some one try and defend Muslims raping enslaving and killing.
