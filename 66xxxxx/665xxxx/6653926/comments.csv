,KLM737NG,2011-10-27T11:17Z,"Great! It seems to work on my pc...

Can anybody tell me how to get the F/O's System Annunciator panel (Master Caution lights on right side) in view in 2D??? I can only get to see it in 3D, but it's unreadable in that mode!"
,KLM737NG,2011-10-27T14:45Z,"Not so great after all... There seems to be a very annoying bug in this: the autopilot keeps descending with 1000 fpm, even in altitude hold!

I'm a pilot on the 737 in real life, so I know how to deal with this plane, but not so much with FSX/PMDG... So, please help!

It doesn't matter HOW I get to a level (VNAV, Level Change, V/S), after ""ALT ACQ"", the vertical mode goes to ""ALT HOLD"", but the A/P starts a descent with 1000 fpm nevertheless. Tried about everything I can think off, but cannot find the solution... Is this a bug in PMDG???

Thanks for all the help in advance!"
,poopoo812,2011-10-29T06:05Z,Can someone crack the SP1?

,rrsousa,2011-10-30T14:19Z,"hoping guys can work on a new crack after sp1.
keep up the good work, you make a difference"
,skyglider777,2011-10-30T18:44Z,"Before we get the cracked 600/700, we need the cracked SP1...without the SP1 the 600/700 expansion won't work. Good luck with the crack  guys!"
,oscar25os,2011-10-31T11:22Z,SP1 works good and reliable with alef1995 patch. To install NGX with SP1 - Completely Remove old NGX and remained PMDG folders. Install only NGX main file(alef1995)+SP1+patch (alef1995). We only need 737-600/700. Hope it will work fine with patch from alef1995.
,funnelpond,2011-10-31T17:12Z,"Hi guys need help here,I can install and use the 737 but everytime i end the flight using the 737 fsx crashes?Any help for i would be grate ful.I have been using torrents for some time and i will soon learn how to upload them as i have some i am sure people would want.

,B737NG-KLM,2011-11-20T22:31Z,"As an update on my recent comment (under name KLM737NG, but I can't access that anymore for some reason):
The problem is solved: make sure you have set the Unit Measurement (in FSX-Settings-General) to either ""U.S. System"" or ""Hybrid""! If you set that to ""Meters"", it could give you TROUBLE!

No idea why I can't save my panel state though... That's a minor point for this one..."
