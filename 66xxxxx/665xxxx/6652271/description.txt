Just a quick upload for those of us who are watching TV on our mobile devices. Series 1-4 of Skins converted (by me) to iPod/Pad format (.m4v) with all the tags, etc. that would come with a proper, online-bought copy. 

The show itself? You know it. You love it! It's the best thing the Americans made a crap remake of.
