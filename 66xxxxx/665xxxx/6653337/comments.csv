Thanks anyway VTV."
,vvfireflyvv,2011-09-06T08:47Z,as advertised it is a 1/2hr episode recapping the past 2 seasons.
,vvfireflyvv,2011-09-06T08:48Z,my kids hid my reminder so i missed it. Thanx so much for the upload 
,pxpierre,2011-09-07T02:52Z,"@ vvfireflyvv - It contains scenes & spoilers from the upcoming season, talks about arcs & characterless, etc.

Don't watch that if you are a fan & like to be surprised by the brilliant scenario of this excellent TV series."
,tesskrit,2011-09-23T15:32Z,"there were these 2 messages on the eztv website forum :
- Just received a ""Unauthorized Distribution of the Copyrighted Television Series"" notice from CBS for this episode...
- I also received a DMCA violation notice from my ISP for downloading this.
anybody else got the same notice?"
,photodoug,2011-09-29T15:23Z,CBS sent an e-mail to my ISP which was forwarded to me.  I called my ISP and a nice young fellow told me they were legally required to pass it on but that I could ignore it because they (the ISP) really doesn't give a crap.  If the ISP cut off all their downloading customers they wouldn't have very many left.   Cheers.
