[V],err0001,2011-09-08T09:08Z,"I'm confused why you would change the torrent title from the filename: 

  craig.ferguson.2011.09.06.720p.hdtv.x264-2hd.mkv

You've changed the date format (so it looks like this is from June 9th), you've left off 2HD so most people won't recognize it is a scene version and you've omitted the ""mkv"". 

Why?"
,apfelsine91,2011-09-08T09:46Z,IMHO this is format that should be used from the beginning
