The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson is a Peabody Award-winning American late-night talk show hosted by Scottish American comedian Craig Ferguson. Ferguson, the third regular host of the Late Late Show franchise, follows Late Show with David Letterman in the CBS late-night lineup. While the majority of the episodes focus on humor, Ferguson has also addressed difficult subject matter, such as the deaths of his parents, and serious interviews with Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Stephen Fry. The show's main competition comes from Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and as of May 2010,[citation needed] the two shows were roughly tied in the ratings, with Ferguson's show drawing in 1.7 million viewers.
