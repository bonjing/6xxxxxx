A/8
V/6
Decent picture quality with good audio, the movies is based on mockumentary found-footage from the 1974 Apollo Moon Mission so most of the footage is grainy and distorted to give real authenticity, so if you think the copy is bad in places, it's suppose to be...lol 
Many Thanx to .BONE. and CRYS for the decent TS rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"

,technation,2011-09-05T05:58Z,"BONE, How come MKV you normally do AVI's or MPEG4......But i always wait for your rips..Just wanna let you know your awsome and keep up the great work. And to all those FAKERS we see right through you. By the way BONE where's Hangover 2 it's crazy no r5, rc, internal nothing.
Thanks again Bone"
,Cr4zyDaN75,2011-09-05T06:00Z,"confirmed 100% real

V: 6.5 bit grainy, but watchable
A: 7-8 but @ 1:06 it goes out of sync, but sorta comes back
M: 'twas ok and i liked it (the thriller/horror cam franchise goes to space)"
,NoCompetition,2011-09-05T06:53Z,PS3 compatible..anyone know?
,NoCompetition,2011-09-05T06:57Z,PS3 compatible??
,orange7,2011-09-05T08:45Z,@NoCompetition Only if .kmv files can be played on a PS3

,michaelrwatson,2011-09-05T21:08Z,"What's the source for this... is it CHOiCE's video? And, PLEASE DO NOT CREATE .MKV files unless you want me to rape your mother with a rusty pipe. Please use .MP4 instead for h264. Thanx."
,michaelrwatson,2011-09-05T21:10Z,"Meant to add, you can even force .h264 into the .AVI container if your IQ is above 90. Thanx."
,BKKJack,2011-09-06T03:41Z,"@michaelrwatson

Go fuck yourself you ungrateful fucktard.

If you want a .MP4 convert it yourself shithead."
[V],.BONE.,2011-09-06T06:53Z,MKV converts to dvd just the same as AVI n MP4  and yes the video is from the same source as CHOICE the 1h 26 u forgot end credits :p and them who complain about ps3 if u can afford $350 for ps3 then u can afford $35 for a cheap dvd player...
,5amjr,2011-09-06T09:49Z,"Dunno if it's cinavia protected but those talking about a MKV file,1-2 minutes max through a TSmuxer to convert it. Does TS all the way up to BDMV+Bluray making the file compatable with PS3.
Sweet"
,dickles,2011-09-06T18:37Z,"DLing now,  will comment  on  quality  then...guessing  its  from the theatre if legit?  an  casper  the runtime  is correct  for the movie  idk wht  ur  talkin  abt"
,dickles,2011-09-06T19:04Z,"yea as it would have to  be its from  the  theatre  so  quality  is  so-so..ntb  for being from a theatre..got up to 1.4 mb/s thru wifi so thts decent..but wtf, this found footage is not ideal for this movie or any  other movie except for maybe blair witch..."
,jahnee,2011-09-06T21:43Z,"I DON'T WANT TO SOUND UNGRATEFUL, but jesus christ bro I'm tired of cheap cam quality and people re-uploading crap, 720p or gtfo the theater. "
,cafemac17,2011-09-06T23:35Z,"@jahnee
plz my dear 
for better quality shell out some bucks...
for be shut ur asshole
.
always says thanx to the uploader...
bcoz he can give what u can never"
,michaelrwatson,2011-09-07T04:39Z,"@.BONE: thanks for the response but in my experience .MKV is much harder to work with (i.e. to convert) than .MP4 or .AVI.  And ""BKKJack"": the same to you."
,Wire41,2011-09-07T04:53Z,you're d BEST!
,jahnee,2011-09-09T19:24Z,I will start donating 720p HD cams
,dickles,2011-09-09T21:09Z,"ok, so i  previously commented about found footage  sucking.  well, i  jus  watched ""cannibal holocaust"" best upload is from  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6408397/Cannibal.Holocaust.Uncut.Edition.DVDRip.XviD

and holy shit that movie is not only the  most fucked  up  thing  ive seen  but it is  truly effective with  its  use of  ""found footage""  im  grateful the uploader  as  i  rly  wantd  to  see  apollo 18 but wht a  disappointing movie.."
,5amjr,2011-09-10T10:28Z,"I like BONE.'s stuff but thats dozens now of wrongly titled/unwatchable shit.
Why build a respectable PB id and in the space of 4 months start to bury it with uploads of this quality. I used to DL your files without even checking the comments, now i can't, pity!"
,dandmart,2011-09-11T03:03Z,All of his torrentz have been legit!
,blusniffer,2011-09-11T11:55Z,big difference between legit (not fake) and able to be viewed without the hubble telescope!
,EiNST3iN,2011-09-13T19:26Z,"Quit crying like little babies and go download a video converter if your computer sucks so bad that it wont play MKV! Idiots! 

If you can't figure that crap out then you don't belong on TPB!"
,JONBOY179,2011-09-18T20:17Z,hey m8 you a star thats brill am seeding and all of your stuff THANKS

,Douglas_Quaid,2011-09-30T02:05Z,Gotta love the noobs hating on .mkv when they obviously have no idea how it works..
,aatorress,2011-10-17T23:21Z,"MIllion thanks'!!!

,artdnr,2011-10-21T22:00Z,"Good torrent (WasnÂ´t expecting good quality from a CAM release, at least it downloaded fast and is watchable), shitty movie though.

,THESENUTS27,2011-10-29T07:22Z,"It wasn't the best quality but not bad. I'll give the movie on a scale of 1 to 10 a ""7"". The storyline is very plausible indeed."
