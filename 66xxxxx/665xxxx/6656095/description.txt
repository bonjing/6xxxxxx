'Megafactories' Aston Martin One-77
For the first time on television, Aston Martin's most advanced production car, the One-77 will be showcased on National Geographic's popular Megafactories series. Following un-paralleled access to Aston Martin the hour-long programme charts the intense One-77 development programme throughout the three years it has taken from the car's conception in October 2007 to the build of the first production One-77 in October 2010. Filmed in high definition the show illustrates how Aston Martin remains at the forefront of contemporary manufacturing, embodying design and engineering excellence, and a brand with a truly special heritage. In never seen-before footage of the exclusive facility where up to 77 examples of the One-77 will be hand-crafted, Megafactories details the highly skilled manufacturing process fusing modern technology with traditional hand-craftsmanship and painstaking attention to detail culminating in over 2,700 man-hours to complete the ultimate Aston Martin by a dedicated team of 27 technicians. The One-77 facility is located in its own specially created standalone building within the company's global headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire. Inside the facility the distinctive production space is laboratory-like in its design and detail, an open plan 1,000 sqm serene space with its white walls, floor and ceiling containing four build positions and a host of specialist equipment and tools. The facility is a marked departure from a conventional automotive production space, with each car remaining static throughout the build, rather than progressing from station to station.
