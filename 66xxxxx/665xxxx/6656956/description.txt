Agent-oriented design has become on of the most active areas in the field of software engineering. Although great advances have been made in the study of the architectural design of agent systems, the complexity and multi-disciplinary approaches of this constantly growing field are currently of a premature nature compared to where they should be. Architectural Design of Multi-Agent Systems: Technologies and Techniques provides a compilation of advanced research results focusing on architecture and modeling issues of multi-agent systems. This study serves as a reference for further research on system models, architectural design languages, formal methods and reasoning, module interface design, and design issues. Architectural Design of Multi-Agent Systems: Technologies and Techniques presents high-level issues such as: modeling agent systems in cognitive sciences, knowledge management, in-depth exposure of agent theory, and state-of-the-art research on design quality of agent systems.
