1 cup sliced celery
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 Tbsp. butter
2 cups milk
2 cups water
1 package (16 oz.) frozen mixed vegetables (can substitute canned or, even better, fresh vegetables of your choice - you would just need to cut the cooking time down a bit)

2 cups (8 oz) cheddar cheese, shreaded

Place oats in food processor or blender; cover and process for 1 minute; set aside.

until tender; blend in ground oats.
Gradually add milk and water; continue cooking over medium heat, stirring
