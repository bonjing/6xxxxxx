The five-disc box set The Melody Ranch Girl collects all 151 tracks that Jean Shepard recorded for Capitol Records between 1952 and 1964. Shepard's recordings for Capitol were undeniably her best -- by and large, this is fiery, passionate honky tonk. All of her hits from this era, from "A Dear John Letter" and "A Satisfied Mind" to "Beautiful Lies" and "Second Fiddle (To An Old Guitar)," are included, as are several rarities, outtakes, and complete albums, including Songs of a Love Affair, one of the first country concept albums. The set also includes a thorough discography and biography, as well as many rare photos. For casual fans, The Melody Ranch Girl is far too lengthy and detailed to be pleasurable listening, yet for dedicated followers, it's an essential purchase.
