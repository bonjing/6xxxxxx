,black_thorne2001,2011-09-08T10:50Z,"tnx for this illiria 

i like your DLC pack on DA2 nice work ;)"
,illiria,2011-09-08T11:13Z,"@ black_thorne2001

Thank you. :) Yeah, made this for myself, then figured others may want a proper-looking release.

Digital releases with STEAM unpackers, while working great, make me dwell back on the days when box releases of games had proper autoruns and installers, and I felt great including them in my collection. A bunch of files and unpacker just make me feel odd... Feels like a rip, not a normal release.
But that's just me, and my aesthetic preferences. :)"
,daucuskarota,2011-09-08T11:17Z,Many thanks for this!! I just wanna know if the DLC is in it too
,illiria,2011-09-08T11:43Z,"@ daucuskarota

""Bloodbath Arena"" and ""Ripper Mod"" DLCs are included.
""Ryder White's Campaign"" is not included because its a FUTURE DLC, it hasn't been released yet.


So to answer your question - yes, all currently available DLCs are included."
,Forgottencrow,2011-09-08T13:23Z,illiria Always love your RePacks. whit this new patch can you walk normal coz when  i patched my game it was laggi and i was walking strange?  ty :)
,illiria,2011-09-08T14:15Z,"@ Forgottencrow

I've played only my patched version, but it works very well on my computer. Walking just fine, game optimization is perfect (better than in most modern games).
Check game's system requirements in Google - maybe your computer is below them?"
,Sliteh,2011-09-08T16:37Z,"Does the saves work? I've downloaded the game from 3 different uploaders and in each one the saves did NOT work. I configured the keyboard, played till I got to the Lighthouse. Exited the game and when I restarted it, it hadn't saved the game even though it said ""Game saved"" in the game o.O"
,Glowyrm,2011-09-08T17:17Z,"""P.S. - Hell knows why does it say ""version 1.0.0"" - I'm 100% sure I've applied ""Update 1"" properly. Maybe it doesn't update game version visually.""

THE ""UPDATE 1"" IS NOT THE PATCH RELEASED BY TECHLAND TO MAKE THE GAME VERSION 1.1 !!!!

That's why it still says 1.0 for you.

We are still waiting on someone to make a torrent with the ""NEW"" (1.1) Dead Island rereleased on Steam, not the DEV Version mistake."
,illiria,2011-09-08T23:14Z,"@ Sliteh
Saves are working for me, I can't say for others. I saw torrents which include some ""save fix"", you might wanna search for them. I will too, and see what its all about.

That ""fix"", whatever it is, will work with my torrent.

@ Glowyrm

If reloaded releases proper Update 1.1 to their release - I will repack and release it too. So far I have to work with that I am given. All I can say is that game works flawlessly for me, so download with no fear."
,Sliteh,2011-09-09T05:29Z,"@ illiria
That's good enough! I will give it a try! :) Thanks"

Sorry, forgot to mention the language. Seems to be ENGLISH ONLY. I don't see any mention of other languages not in game settings, not in game files.

@ saequa253

Obviously not a fake, simply because I made it for myself. Which files are ""blank"" for you? Maybe you don't know what ISO is? :)"

,illiria,2011-09-09T12:53Z,"@ Fgtfgtj

I see only one DLC-related file. I know for sure there are others, but I can't identify them by name. So I'm afraid I can't do that."
,illiria,2011-09-09T17:08Z,"I AM AWARE that updates are being released. I am waiting for a normal scene release to pack them into a patch.
So far game plays flawlessly, smoothly, all saves (on my computer, I speak for myself) work fine. So there is no rush. You can also play it online with Tunngle, Hamachi, or whatever. I don't use them. There are also trainers for this version.

I suggest you don't rush head-first into every torrent claiming to release an update. Let's sit and wait for a proper release. Game runs very well as it is."
,Throwie,2011-09-10T03:33Z,Are you sure this version can play online/LAN using hamachi? My game lobby seems to be greyed out when I load up the game
,illiria,2011-09-10T04:11Z,"@ Throwie

I know for sure people play this version through tunngle, not sure about hamachi. I haven't really researched on this topic, I just gave examples. You know more about pirated multiplayer than me. :)"
,Glowyrm,2011-09-10T06:23Z,"This install + http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6663395/Dead_Island_UPDATE_3___DLC___CRACK_CO-OP_TOMEK116__amp__Sonuyos = Dead Island V 1.2 with Update 3.

Awesome work illiria, love your repacks so much especially this and the Mass Effect 2 stuff :)"
,Glowyrm,2011-09-10T06:33Z,"And if you want to use your previous saves from playing 1.0 (assuming you saved your ""out"" folder) just get the original ""steam_api.dll"" file from Reloaded's original release and copy that over to your Dead Island directory."
,illiria,2011-09-10T08:11Z,"@ Glowyrm

Nah, very simple work, I didn't do much. I just made an installer and autorun for myself coz I prefer my games good and official-looking. Besides, RELOADED unpacker plays music during the entire unpacking time. It's... uh... annoying.

I don't expect anyone saying I did a good job on this, because I didn't. I just made it for the looks, that's all. And I didn't compress, because as long as it fits a DVD, its good. Compression highly increases installation time, and I said so before, and I'll say it again - nobody wants to install the game for two hours.
And most of us have fast, reliable internet to download torrents. Those who do not, are welcome to download a highly compressed repack - I am not forcing anybody.


P.S. I really don't care for reputation, but I do wonder why do people put ""minus"" reputation. Everything works proper, everything looks good. What else is needed? High compression? Welcome to a different repack. Unsatisfied? Then you haven't read the description prior to downloading. Your own problem. *shrugs*


P.P.S. I'm tired of excusing myself. Sometimes I do very complicated works, sometimes very simple. There will always be dissatisfied people, and for them I have only two hints:

1) Learn to read descriptions.
2) Look for other repacks that suit your needs better. To each their own."
,illiria,2011-09-10T08:17Z,"@ Glowyrm

Startred my tirade, and forgot what I was gonna say:

You did a greast job providing support for the game, thank you a lot. Only thing that sucks about othyer torrent is that it requires STEAM to be installed on the computer is order to work properly. It's not terrible, but I prefer not to garbage my computer with software I'm not gonna use. And if I'm not mistaken, STEAM is a very persistent software. Launches with windows, auto-connects to internet, likely runs background processes. Not something I'd install unless I REALLY have to. :/

Still hoping for a scene crack release..."
,Fgtfgtj,2011-09-10T09:41Z,@illiria--how to get dlc it says unlocked but i cant play at additional content menu pls help where to play bloodbath arena mode
,Fgtfgtj,2011-09-10T11:30Z,@illiria Can u pls tell where can i play bloodbatharena mode ??? it says unlocked in additional content but i cant enter.
,Glowyrm,2011-09-10T11:33Z,"@illiria

I don't use steam and mine works fine, you just have to not copy over the ""steam_api.dll"".

I probably should have mentioned that in addition to making old saves work, the original ""steam_api.dll"" will also make it so you don't need Steam to run it...BUT, Co-op will not work then.

So what I said is really for people who just want to play single player without  the need for Steam and use their old saves."
,illiria,2011-09-10T11:53Z,"@ Fgtfgtj

""Ripper Mod"" DLC is definitely working - I have it in game.
""Bloodbath Arena"" - judging by what I'm reading in Google, it has not been released yet. It says ""UNLOCKED"" in RELOADED version, but looks like it just shows the game has accepred a pre-order DLC code. The DLC itself is yet to be released.

In ashort: ""Bloodbath Arena"" is not officially out yet.
According to Google articles: ""Deep Silver has confirmed that the first download pack for Dead Island will be released in late September.""

@ Glowyrm

I see, thanks. I'll try the torrent out and see what it does for me. Thank you a lot.
As for update itself, I doubt it features any worthwhile Single Player changes. Most likely they are fixing/polishing co-op/multiplayer mode. Changelog is always welcome. :P"
,Machi4,2011-09-10T18:04Z,"Help. No matter what i do, I cannot open the game because it says I am missing a .dll file. The file is one that starts with an X. What am I doing wrong?"
,Confusion7,2011-09-10T22:06Z,"For some reason at certain parts in the game, mainly at the beginning and in the menu, I get this really loud static bloody ear-raping noise that just doesn't want to stop. Any idea what's causing this?"

,Glowyrm,2011-09-11T20:49Z,"@ Confusion7

From what I heard that's a bug some people get. I have read that the latest update has fixed it for people.

@ illiria

Yeah I wish I had a change log as well. I'm not sure what exactly changed in version 1.2 but I have read that some weird bugs people have faced with cracked version are fixed (like the sound glitches and some quest glitches).

You're also probably right that it has Co-op polish / fixes in it as well.

@ Anyone who wants to ""mod"" their game (remove weapon swing blur, head bob, disable bloom effect, all kinds of quality of life stuff). Take a look here...

A very nicely organized thread with easy changes and fixes (just read carefully). Just use the first post to take you to the fix you want. You should not get VAC banned for these since you're not changes any DLL's or EXE files."

,Glowyrm,2011-09-13T07:22Z,"@ geuheo28

This package is working 100% perfectly. You may have one of the ""sound bugs"" some people have been getting, try applying some of the updates crack teams have put out, here is a link to one I know to work for certain and will update the game to version 1.2 (non dev version and any bug fixes they have released so far).

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6663395/Dead_Island_UPDATE_3___DLC___CRACK_CO-OP_TOMEK116__amp__Sonuyos

@ shim255

As far as I know there's no way to do this yet.

@ benoit2

If you backed up your saves you can play them by using the original RELOADED version of ""steam_api.dll"" in your directory and not one from an updated crack.

Also would like to promote this thread once again since it's full of great stuff!

http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2106453

IMPORTANT: If you wish to attempt anything in that thread, the directory path you will use is different than the ""legit"" path.

It is... *\Dead Island\DI\out\Data\"
,illiria,2011-09-14T07:10Z,"@ Glowyrm

I have already recompiled the game version 1.2 along with Update 3, but I don't think theres a sense in uploading the whole thing afresh...
I might, in the end, release a complete edition of the game with the latest patch, DLC, maybe a couple of bugfixing mods - but as soon as new updates come out every week, I don't see the point.

As far as new patch/crack goes, it's just a bunch of files to copy in game folder. There isn't much sense in repacking that either."
