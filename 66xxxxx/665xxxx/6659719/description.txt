This is a repack of Dead Island, RELOADED, update 1 is included in the repack. RELOADED version has no installer, so I made one.

There is nothing outstanding about this release, just a basic repack. It also weights 1 gigabyte more than RELOADED version, because I used no compression. I could compress it to a much lesser size, but would you really like to install it for 1,5 hours?

Anyway, aside of pretty autorun and installer, there isn't much to say about it. Grab if you want a good-looking release to save. RELOADED (this) release also contains unlocked bonus content, in case you didn't know.


P.S. Hell knows why does it say "version 1.0.0" - I'm 100% sure I've applied "Update 1" properly. Maybe it doesn't update game version visually.
