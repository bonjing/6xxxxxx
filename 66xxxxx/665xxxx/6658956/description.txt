From the Infowars web site ::

On the Wednesday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Michael Allison, a 41-year-old backyard mechanic from southeastern Illinois, who faces up to 75 years in prison for the crime of recording the police. Allison ran afoul of officialdom in Robinson, Illinois, after filing a lawsuit against the city in 2007 in response to a demand he pay the state to license unused cars on his property. 

Alex also talks with Mike Adams of Natural News about the Texas wildfires and FEMA's authoritarian moves in the state to seize control of the emergency response.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
