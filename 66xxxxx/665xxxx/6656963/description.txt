        A romantic documentary about love in a foreign city.           
        Four Bulgarian guys emigrated to Helsinki and                  
        disillusioned in love decide to give themselves a task:         
        they need to find new girlfriends in Helsinki in 12             
        months. Otherwise  they figure  they wont cope with          
        Nordic ladies ever again.                                      
                                                                       
        The men start well organized self-development and women         
        hunting. Internet dates, sport dates, courses in dancing        
        and tantric sex  not to mention a date with a whole            
        female volleyball team.                                        
                                                                       
        Still, love is always full of surprises. The past              
        especially ex-wives and ex-girlfriends - wont leave the        
        men in peace. And the present is also full of surprises:        
        Why dont all women put their photos on the dating sites       
        of the Internet? Why do Finnish men have less hair than        
        Bulgarian men? Is sex a cure for solitude? And can              
        anyone anywhere really get to know another person in 12         
        months?
