This video contains all of the Mr. Screen opening scenes from Pink Floyd's 1994 Pulse tour DVD set.  This was a bonus feature included in disk 2, which I have combined into one mpeg2 video, in the same quality as straight from the DVD.  If you enjoy this torrent, please seed it until there are a good amount of seeders sharing the file.  
Enjoy!
