,captain-under,2011-09-07T16:25Z,"Religion is passed on from parents to children 
Kind of like the aids virus 
The god you worship depends not on truth but merely in what country you were born 
And what set of lies your parents taught you
Very few people choose their  Religion
Who would choose as a adult to believe  the crazy shit  that all Religions preach as truth
Remember this crap was written in the bronze age

,biadil117,2011-09-07T17:55Z,"God is only 1 which is taught by all religions but we humans have misinterpretted all the Holy books n have wrong conceps.Brain is given to us so that we use it n dont follow wat others say,so that we use it n believe wat we think is right.All religions have their respect but Islam is the final religion by the creator of the universe.read Quran n u'll find it flawless unlike other religious books which have been changed by man himself.Quran is the only book in his real form.u might not believe in Allah or Quran but ur soul will believe it when its recitation will give u inner satisfaction.I just pray that Allah blesses u wid the truth.This torrent is for the believers of Islam.so kindly restrain urself from commenting all this here.Stay blessed AMEEN..i dont want to offend any1 so peace to all.t.c"
