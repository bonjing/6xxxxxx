,Rag318,2011-09-08T01:30Z,Nice! You and GunningHawk are knocking them out of the park! Any chance we might get a fixed upload for Batgirl? The first one was missing a page.
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-08T01:51Z,"if it was missing a page then I dont think we missed any crucial details, but Im sure there will be another upload later"
,Rag318,2011-09-08T02:22Z,"Fair enough. I think we just missed the introduction of the new roommate character. 

Either way, you guys are awesome for these uploads. And you're right, I would have loved O.M.A.C. 18 years ago."
