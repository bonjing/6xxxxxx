available on Steam earlier today, that we released. Watch out for save
game issues that may arise out of incompatibility."

,dumas1000,2011-09-07T07:39Z,"Driver San Francisco for the PC does not come out until September 27, at the earliest. Rips are usually acquired by people with limited bandwidth, who often don't give back, and my experience is that a Blackbox or TPTB or Kaos release can die out in a matter of days, while the full release stays seeded for months and sometimes even years. In other words, you better get this file now or else there within a week there might no be any seeders left. I cannot download any file that gets hammered because my bandwidth evaporates, so I'm forced to download ripped versions of new games. I can get 175kb/s on a download, but if I tried downloading Extreme Zone's full release of this game, I'd end up with only like 15kb/s. It sucks."
,irishboyblue,2011-09-07T09:49Z,great rip shroo and these stay seeded for years just like 420dopeman rips ect if the games good it will live long regaurdless thats  my experience !

,p2b,2011-09-07T16:44Z,"@deusexfan - their rip would probably have vids downgraded to 50% & tptb's is 60% so see the difference

I'm not new at this sort of thing but the game just doesn't seem to allow me to change the the resolution to anything higher or lower than 600x800, even though it SAYS it's on 1080p.
