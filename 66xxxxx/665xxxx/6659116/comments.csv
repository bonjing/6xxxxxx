,cur37ious,2011-09-08T01:47Z,"Even if this contains the original 1136, the additional 839 files make it well worth downloading.  Thanks!"
,bookworm1960,2011-09-08T03:15Z,"Thanks, there's a few here that I didn't have."
,chromepony,2011-09-08T04:29Z,"NO SEEDERS?  90 LEECHERS?  C'MON, WHERE IS YOUR HEART AT!!!!!"

,cur37ious,2011-09-08T19:41Z,"Patience, chromepony. It took a while for his solo seeding to establish a few more seeders in his first attempt in February. Hopefully, he won't be alone in seeding (if it's zero, he's offline.  Some can't leave their connection up 24/7) and things will proceed quickly.  His original collection now has 34 seeders."
,Tuneyloon,2011-09-09T00:21Z,"I have left the files uncompressed as I did with the previous version, this way you can pick and choose which files you want instead of sifting through after downloading the lot!. Up to 4 seeders now thanks guys!"
,chromepony,2011-09-10T04:03Z,"I tried it 3 days in a row and got nothing, that's why I posted the first time.  Not yelling, just used Caps to get someone's attention.  I tried again now and it's downloading, slow but sure so it should be OK.  Thanks everyone!  CP"
,Flinx98,2011-09-17T12:42Z,"Any chance of getting a seeder?
We seen stuck at 47.2% for around 5 days now."
,Tuneyloon,2011-09-20T06:44Z,"Flinx98 try searching for 'EPub books updated'. It's the same as this version minus about 6 books.
