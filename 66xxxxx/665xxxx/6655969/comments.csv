,Sarmatae1,2011-10-06T07:56Z,"Okay...bad container. Held a file that crashed Windows Explorer. Was able to isolate the corrupt file, but when I attempted to trash it, it hooked and took with it critical Windows logon files, disabling even Safe Mode booting. Lost everything that wasn't backed up...which, fortunately for me, wasn't much because I know there are sperm-vomiting cock gobbler like you out there.

Whatever was in that container slipped past the following scans: McAfee, Malware Bytes, AVG, AdAware, AND Norton 360. The movie can't be that good, and if it is....there have to be better copies out there. People, don't chance this one."
