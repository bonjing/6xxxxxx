--------ABOUT BED PEACE

1969 was the year that John and Yoko intensified their long running campaign for World Peace. They approached the task with the same entrepreneurial expertise as an advertising agency selling a brand of soap powder to the masses. John and Yoko\\\'s product however was PEACE, not soft soap, and they were determined to use any slogan, event and gimmick in order to persuade the World to buy it.

BED PEACE (directed by Yoko and John and filmed by Nic Knowland) is a document of the Montreal events and features John and Yoko in conversation with, amongst others, The World Press, satirist Al Capp, activist Dick Gregory, comedian Tommy Smothers, protesters at Berkeley\\\'s People\\\'s Park, Rabbi Abraham L. Feinberg, quiltmaker Christine Kemp, psychologists Timothy Leary and Rosemary Leary, CFOX DJs Charles P. Rodney Chandler and Roger Scott, producer AndrÃ© Perry, journalist Ritchie York, DJ and Promoter Murray The K, filmmaker Jonas Mekas, publicist Derek Taylor and personal assistant Anthony Fawcett.

Featured songs are Plastic Ono Band\\\'s GIVE PEACE A CHANCE and INSTANT KARMA, Yoko\\\'s REMEMBER LOVE and WHO HAS SEEN THE WIND and John\\\'s acoustic version of BECAUSE.
