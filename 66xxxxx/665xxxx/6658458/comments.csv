hell yeah dude, i love the early part of volume 3, i love detective bullshit noir more than anything. after the renumber, things took a bit of a dive for a while because peter david turned x-factor back into a team book... anyway im ranting. x-factor is still the best ongoing x-book around besides uncanny x-force. so yeah, i share your love"
