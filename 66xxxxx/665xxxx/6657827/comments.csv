I looking for the Swedish..."
,Doowangle,2011-09-07T17:14Z,"LOL look at all the names on this torrent, icon, arshad, sneak shot, and I bet none of you faggots were the original ripper either. Its sad how desperate you nerds are for attention. You download this from filesharing links off the net, then upload it here and think you need your name all over it. As if anyone gives a shit. 

Protip: NO ONE CARES WHAT NECKBEARD UPLOADED IT, the only thing people care about is if it works or not, you aren't going to get E famous off this little bullshit. Kill yourself for being so needy for attention.

P.S. Since this is the same version as the filesharing ones, this DOES work, but you will need at least dashboard 2.0.13146.0 for this to work, otherwise if you let it update from the disk, you could get your 360 bricked

,Doowangle,2011-09-07T17:24Z,"LOL, look at all the user names attached to this torrent. icon, arshad, sneak shot, and I bet not one of you clowns actually ripped the game either. You got it off file sharing links, as any fool could, and decided you just HAD to have your name on it. 

Protip: You aren't going to get E-famous off reposting other peoples work. No one gives a crap about your goofball user names, the only thing people care about is 'does it work or not'. You are a clown, and you will die a clown

P.S. Since this is the same one that I grabbed off file sharing links, this DOES work, but you will need at least dash 2.0.13146.0

If you don't have that dash or higher, it will update from the disk and you risk bricking your xbox. "

,azuziel,2011-09-10T01:58Z,"@Doowangle

Actually, unless you've been on the moon for the last half year, the dashboards running on most jtag's have all checks removed. FSD v2.09 for kernel 12611 doesnt check anything, there isnt even a need to update past 12611 unless you want gay-ass avatars anyway. Oh, and dashlaunch does the same thing. Updating kernel/FW for jtag users is a thing of the past. XB-S forms support all of this, go check it out before spreading BS about bricking systems."
,gymrat780,2011-09-10T02:36Z,"@ laza8, took me about 20 hours to get it but I wasn't always connected to the net."
,laza8,2011-09-10T23:10Z,Its been taken me 3 days and only 30 percent
,laza8,2011-09-10T23:14Z,can u increase the speed on utorrent?
,Doowangle,2011-09-15T19:33Z,"@azuz

I wasn't speaking to Jtag, I was talking about ixtreme flashed consoles. Jtag is ghetto shit for people who don't want to play online. 

Maybe try thinking of context before trying to make yourself look cool online, clown"
