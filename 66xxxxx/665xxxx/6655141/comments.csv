,blacklabel67k,2011-09-06T12:01Z,"@Mrtololoz

I can't even figure out how to unpack the preloaded version. Or maybe doesn't even need to be unpacked."

,PGMP1979,2011-09-06T12:06Z,"No confirmations yet :( - A scan made on Virustotal dropped 4 different results but they are probably false positives.

,Lazuri12345,2011-09-06T12:37Z,"Techland accidentally released the developers debug version on steam. Meaning that it's not really optimized for any platform. That's why it crashes, is hilariously buggy and sends you into noclip when you press ""Y."" Go nuts."
[V],.Dude.,2011-09-06T12:46Z,"Check this:

,Leeell,2011-09-06T12:58Z,"no use downloading the game, the released version for PC is a direct Xbox360 developer release (tweaked for PC) and its totally broken, wait for a brand new release instead (the company fucked up big time)

so nothing against .dude , most likely a working release, just not the intended release. "
,mizztahd,2011-09-06T13:05Z,Anyone know how to force V-sync?

,Leeell,2011-09-06T13:24Z,"@mizztahd

impossible, its not in the video config either, same as the FOV, it will have to be modded in the future. (if even that is going to be possible)"
,mizztahd,2011-09-06T13:30Z,this game needs patching as it's effed
