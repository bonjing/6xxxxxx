CBDA Project Update:

Set 6 took me quite a while to put together.  There
was usually work or family stuff or just one more thing to add
into Set 6 to make it better.

Once Set 6 has been seeded well, I am going to release
the next CBDA VHS Preservation: CB The Duck Maestro!
Instead of ConvertXtoDVD for DVD menus, I will try out another 
DVD menu software.  If anybody would like to make DVD covers
for the CBDA VHS Preservations, then please post weblinks
to the pictures in the piratebay comments section. Thanks!

Set 11 will include the recently found Barks Bear Book scans
placed into separate comics with covers, CB and JH cartoos, 
Eye Opener books and picture scans of the MM in colour CB section.  
The bonus for CBDA Set 11 would be a colour scanlation 
for Pluto saves the ship and updated one pagers with fixed up comics.

I now have all the CBL in colour graphic albums on hand, so
some of the one pagers and a few older DD / US stories 
can be updated.   

I was able to buy DD Beste Verhalen 134 and 135 from www.bol.com with google translate.  Now I can scanlate the rest of the Daan Jippes drawn Woodchuck stories as well as Pied Pied Piper of Duckburg DJ, King Scrooge the First DJ and Pluto saves the ship!


At least, that's the plan so far.

**********************

Other CB news:

1. Fantagraphics CB volume 1 is coming out soon!

2. IDW Barks Bear Book has been delayed to January 2012,
according to amazon.com!

3. I have read that for next year, Egmont is working on their own version 
of "The Fine Art of Walt Disney's Donald Duck" book which will
include unpublished paintings as well as colour and black & white drawings!

4. After reading through the index to the Egmont Carl Barks Collection,
I found some CB comics that have not been in the Another Rainbow CBL series
and will be included in CBDA Set 11!

a. 3 Happy Hound stories credited, but not drawn by Carl Barks
b. 12 comic strips written by Carl Barks and drawn by Al Taliaferro

5. The DD verhalen series has unedited stories that can be scanlated!
a. US 071 King Scrooge the First 
b. US 008 Mysterious Stone Ray
c. DD 4c0238 Voodoo Hoodoo
d. WDCS 197 Daffy Taffy Pull



**********

The excellent free disney comics website is available if you just
want to read the un-cropped comics online.

Much thanks goes to that guy who has posted many more recent
scans of wdc&s stories. It gives me a quite a few more comics
to update though.

The CBDA collection will be complete, 
but if you can find better scans than posted within this 
collection, then please leave a message and post up your comic scans.

I will update this request list as I go along.
Thanks for helping!
