I don't have access to login to my account anymore."
,toolosseus,2011-09-14T15:38Z,"hmmm, i just watched the movie on my WDTV live and the forced subtitles were non-existent."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-09-17T22:35Z,forced doesn't imply they will play automatically.  you still need to select them.
,toolosseus,2011-09-18T09:44Z,"Ya i did try using the subtitle button on my remote but it did not show that i even had any subtitles to choose from. I simply copied the folder i downloaded straight to my WDTV, so i know i did not forget to transfer the subtitles."
