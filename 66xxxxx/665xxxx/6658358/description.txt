Starting with the appropriately queasy-ish Fever Dreams, slightly warped shoegaze-ish guitars in a tight loop as Aaron Chapmans at once breathy and direct singing cuts through a slow-building rhythm, Nurses have found themselves in a much stronger, more distinct spot than 2009s Apples Acre allowed for. Dracula, for all the gothic connotations the name might call up, deals in a different kind of busy, involving darkness and something shadowy.  The end effect is ultimately liberating, letting Nurses explore something more than the late-2000s indie cul-de-sac theyd found themselves in previously.
