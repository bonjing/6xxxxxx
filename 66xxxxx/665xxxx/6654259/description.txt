The book covers every aspect of face-to-face, phone, Internet, and self-service customer relations, and provides simple yet powerful tips for: projecting a positive attitude and making a great first impression; communicating effectively, both verbally and nonverbally; developing trust, establishing rapport, and making customers feel valued; and confidently handling difficult customers and situations.
