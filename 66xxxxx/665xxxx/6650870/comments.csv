If so download TSmuxer, click add + choose the mkv file u downloaded from your library, choose to convert to AVI, BDMV+Bluray and 60 secs l8r your done making it playable on a ps3.

If you don't use a ps3 ignore all the shit above! lol"
,blusniffer,2011-09-07T04:18Z,"@Michaelrwatson you told the uploader not to use MKV files as "" Your standards are high "". He's only ever uploaded 3 torrents, a 2008 movie, 2009 movie and this cam.

Take ur head out your ass u Twat!!!"

,chris411,2011-09-28T02:02Z,"I understand that because of the intended look of the movie, the audio/video will always be a little off, still this looked and sounded good enough to know what was going on.  However the last few moments of the movie seem to be missing... it ends very abruptly."
