NOTES:
READNFO and PROPER for several reasons, just to get a few important points across. I highly advise you read this first.

Reason for the PROPER tag:
As of the point of posting this, none have properly corrected perspective\\\\\\\'s. CHOiCE have attempted to fix perspective but there still off. The left margine is still skewed to the right. There pic is narrower at top. Meaning aspect is effectivley off or the pic is contorted outa shape. Mine is corrected properly.

Biggest issues and reason for readnfo:
There is a couple of mins missing from the start.
The first 1 mn 45 sec of vid, is not from rukino\\\\\\\'s cam. Its from an undisclosed, lower quality cam. I trimmed this off CHOiCE\\\\\\\'s vid and appended it onto the start of mine, after working it seperatly.
The movie is supposed to judder and be of fluctuating quality. This depicts several different 1970\\\\\\\'s cameras and is all part of the intended atmosphere. In other words its supposed to look rough.
Resolutions strange yet aspect apears correct. Round is round and square is square. Thats cams for you but. Unless every piece of vid is 100% there and there is no cropping, then cams always follow strange resolutions to compensate for the missing vid, lest ye risk knocking aspect off lol.

Work done:
Video: Corrected perspective PROPERLY. Corrected a small amount of \\\\\\\"the shakes\\\\\\\". Couldnt go to far, with this bar i risked removing intended effects in the movie. Corrected contrast and brightness. Balanced colours as best as i could.
Audio: Great line. Filtered alot of hissing out. Lowered the volume and balanced eq better. Had to add 100 milisecs of background noise at 1mn 45 secs, due to appending the start clip, to maintain sync with the rest of the vid.

Ive tried to get this up to my normal standard but please note. I\\\\\\\'m always a big believer in things \\\\\\\"being the way there supposed to be\\\\\\\" so i was extremely wary and limited due to risking knocking off the directors intended effects. Still, this is sweet looking and it sounds amazing. Its not perfect, then it is only a cam and the movies not supposed to be perfect anyway
