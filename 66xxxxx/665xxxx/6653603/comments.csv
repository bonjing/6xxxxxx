I think you're a prince among men for all of the  uploading you do, and how accommodating you are to everyone.  

Just in case you can't sleep tonight, here is my request:

Marriage Plot -  Jeffrey Eugenides
Say You're One of Them Uwem Akpan
Lost Girls (Black Ops) - Bob Mayer
Story of a Marriage- Greer
State of Wonder - Ann Patchet
Jew Boy in Goy Town -Charles Bluming
Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet - J. Ford
Postmistress - Sarah Blake
Solitude of Prime Numbers - Giordana
Olive Kitteridge - Elizabeth Strout
Corrections - Jonathan Franzen

Also, if you get the idea of the type of books I'm looking for, and you can point me to a particular post of yours or someone else's, that would be great.  It's hard looking at so many lists!

Your new fan,
TridentGal"
