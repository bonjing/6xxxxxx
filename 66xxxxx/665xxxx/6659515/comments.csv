I've read already 4 of the 13, alphabetically, and so far I'm very happy by this DC reboot. I wasn't a DC reader before, and I feel that I can finally get into the story without having to recatch all the previous stories... Anyway, nice work dude:)"
,xenoFLASH,2011-09-08T08:56Z,I think this might be one of the better books to come out(even with winnick writing).
