,Endless-,2011-09-09T16:25Z,"Maybe the reason for no comments or seeds is that the files are 2 small. I mean common. BluRays have what.. 30 GB? and all you could squeez out was 500 MB, shame on YOU"
,brok47,2011-09-10T05:42Z,"@Endless 
 size doesnt matter 30 gb of blue ray is very very painfull to danload and waste of bandwidth sine due to heres bandwith limitations and at this size any 1 indian can dawnload these movies in affortable time "
,Endless-,2011-09-10T10:39Z,"@Brok47: I agree, but when you are using a 50"" screen and have a average good sound system, 500MB files are just to low The Blackness and the quality in general is to low. But I must state that all you ppl spending time on decoding so we can download IS doing a good job. I just need atleast 1.5 GB files, atleast, prefere higher."
