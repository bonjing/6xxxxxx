,zekiel247,2011-09-05T13:49Z,"Downloaded it and tested with nod32, all clean also launchs. Just needs key I guess. thx for the upload"
,kevmeister95,2011-09-05T16:03Z,"what I was gettin' at was this;  this might be a planted game by Lucasarts, used to test internal security.  if someone did find a key to use this, it might be a moot point.  

from reading the reviews, this game looks like it's supposed to be a single player game with MMORPG support.  

unless I missed somethin'..."
,heaser,2011-09-05T20:08Z,"yes, you missed something... IT IS an MMORPG"
,sefis122,2011-09-05T23:28Z,when the beta will be available

,fishyfish2656,2011-09-13T10:43Z,anyone know any way of bypassing the login thing?
,casirm,2011-09-29T20:16Z,"seems fairly useless. they've said numerous times over the past few weeks on the official forums that they were about to roll out a new build of the game, requiring everyone to download the new client again from scratch. appreciate the effort, but unless anyone here can manage to extract cinematics or dialogue, etc. from the clients files, there's not much use anyone (even those already in the beta) can have from this."
,xord123,2011-10-17T20:58Z,why not working my launcher? it like s an not working web site 
,Bargetti,2011-10-31T03:04Z,any idea if I can atleast rip the audio out of it or something?
,Casevil,2011-10-31T20:54Z,Depends on what kind of files you found there. 
,Casevil,2011-10-31T20:56Z,And btw why MINUS the fucking proper upload? Appreciate the work - if you do not download this for who's sake do you minus it? IT IS LEGIT BETA BUY YOU CAN'T DO SHIT SINCE YOU NEED A KEY!
