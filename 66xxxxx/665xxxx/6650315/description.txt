A specially built version of portable firefox built to increase youtube views. Not meant to replace your current browser, its prebuilt for navigation and usage of 1 site only that is reputable of increasing views, likes, channel views, subbers and comments on your videos. Not going to name names here, you'll have to download it and try it yourself. The homepage is also the registration screen if you dont have an account already with this site. It strips the video out of the auto surfing for views feature allowing a quiet, smooth rotation without the videos hanging load times and crashing the system. The way this is done also bypasses their checkers already in place that make sure you have flash enabled.
