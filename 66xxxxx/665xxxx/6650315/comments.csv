[T],n2kmaster,2011-09-19T18:33Z,"yeah this was setup as a tester product for their website however they were looking more for just a plugin. I am aware a click bot or something would probably do the same thing HOWEVER, most people already have their browsers cluttered up with crap and this site just bogs out from time to time. I've used the site a lot already just the heavy page loads on youtube, firefox sucking as of late, their chrome plugin not working right, and the downloadable autowatcher just never worked for me. I had to find a solution cuz i knew right then and there about 1000 people were all suffering the same way. Here's the skinny on this.

1. Does it boost youtubes? YES, no question about it
2. Is it free? I'm the N2KMaster, of course its free.
3. Do i need to install anything? Nope. Its a pre packaged portable version of firefox, everythings in the box.
4. Do I have to sign up to anything? Yes, the site that shows as a homepage, sign up there.
5. How come I can't play my facebook apps on it? Cuz you're a dumb dumb who can't read its not for general web browsing, its a stripped down version of firefox built specfically for using this one site, that's it that's all. 
6. What all does it do? You can get subbers, channel views, video views, video likes, and video comments. Comes in handy if you got a bunch of credits stored and you need a video liked asap(I'm looking your way TGC) where they can basically thumbs down your video from like 5 people and then report your video getting it pulled from youtube (Trust me, it happens, they did it to 3 versions of me showcasing Mega Mapper for FPSC) 
7. Can i get in trouble using it? Not my products fault, dunno who or when it happens to them, i guess theres a 1% chance of getting the account locked on ya, says it on their site. But if you FOLLOW instructions they give you on the site you will have no problems at all.
8. So it works, right? I wouldn't have put it up here looking for testers if it wasn't. TPB is where i put most of my homebrewn products and all my goodies go up. I never upload fakes or viruses or anything to hurt anyones machine, thats just lame and doesn't prove you can code or hack, just proves your a pud. And once again YES it totally works, even the staff of the site approve of this little tool being used on their site."

so you know i aint just throwing out some referral dealy here, my accounts up over 90,000 credits which is thousands of youtube views, i've just recently found them myself, and figured out the loophole"
,GOOD12,2011-10-05T21:56Z,CAN U MAKE A MAC VERSION???? PLEASE
,t0rres9,2011-11-13T21:58Z,"I don't understand how you got up to 25,000 views overnight, when the most you can request at once is 250.

Before downloading this app I already had an account on the website it uses, with lots of credits. I was hoping I could use the modified portable firefox to watch MY video lots of times.

Your ""I got 25000 views overnight"" suggests you can.  If so, how?

Would really appreciate it, because adding 250 views every three days is getting tiresome, and it's taking a long time to get above 3k.

Would really appreciate help."
