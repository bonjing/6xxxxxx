,agnt24,2011-09-18T20:23Z,"just so you guys know, i saw the movie at the multiplex before watching this print, and i am shocked to see that along with audio cleaning, there has been a sizable amount of ""VIDEO CLEANING"" too. many scenes pivotal to the storyline have been completely axed or chopped off. if you're looking for the full length version, check out other torrents or watch in theatres."
