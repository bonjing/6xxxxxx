  That Girl in Yellow Boots is a thriller     
  tracing Ruth's (Kalki Koechlin) search for  
  her father - a man she hardly knew but      
  cannot forget. Desperation drives her to    
  work without a permit, at a massage parlour.
  Torn between several schisms, Mumbai becomes
  the alien but yet strangely familiar        
  backdrop for Ruth's quest. She struggles to 
  find her independence and space even as she 
  is sucked deeper into the labyrinthine      
  politics of the city's underbelly. A city   
  that feeds on her misery, a love that eludes
  her and above all, a devastating truth that 
  she must encounter. And everyone wants a    
  piece of her.
