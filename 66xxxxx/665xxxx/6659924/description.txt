Ishi is high energy electronic band with influences of Folk & Soul. They thrive on creating a positive atmosphere that encourages their audience to be themselves & let loose.
	
Ishi formed in Dallas, Tx as a duo with JT Mudd & Brad Dale at the end of 2006. Their sound derived from their vision to unify the instrumentation of Folk music with the endless soundscapes of electronic production. They started the recording process early 2007 with the intent to take their listeners on a uplifting journey exploring new sounds & resolving back to their forefather "Folk" which inspired it all. Ishi released their debut record "Through The Trees" May, 2010 & received two awards in the 2010 Dallas Observer Music Awards for "Best New Act" & "Best Electronic/Dance Band". This year the band has been nominated again for "Best Electronic/Dance band" & will soon be determined on 10/18/11.

In May of 2011 the time had arrived to make changes to the roster by adding guitarist Rocky Ottely & in June Becky Middleton joined the tribe as Female vocalist. James Mudd started playing in the Spring of '09 & still remains on drums & programming. Ishi continues to grow as they pursue other markets which led to them being accepted to perform at Wicker Park Fest '11, Free Tulsa '11, Halfway to Forecastle '11 in Louisville, Ky, Homegrown Fest '10 & '11 in Dallas & EdgeFest '10 also in Dallas. They have shared bills with such bands as Phoenix, Pretty Lights, Big Boi, Neon Indian, Toro y Moi, Boombox, Twin Shadow, The Toadies, Marina & the Diamonds, & Matthew Dear. The band is currently working on their second record & plan for a 2012 Spring/Summer release.
