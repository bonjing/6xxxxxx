This double-CD really is a garage and deep house heaven from the golden 90-95 era. The two compilers are quite famous French gay activist and journalists, they have been around since house day1 and it shows in this impeccable selection with tracks of sheer beauty, deepness, hedonism but also 'social' content from back in the days when house was also a gay militant music. This comp is ideal to understand why people like Frankie Knuckles, Robert Owens, David Morales or Tony Humphries are real legends when they have now a cliched and dated 'over-the-top' image...most of the tracks here havent aged at all, and things like Chante Moore's This Time will restore hope and faith in the most blase-d heart. A real treasure. (by Restless on discogs.com)
