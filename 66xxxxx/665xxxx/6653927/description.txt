I uploaded this because I found it frustratingly difficult to setup and run Civ V from any other torrents. I found I was searching everywhere for info, how-tos, and random shit that I needed. So here it is...

Patched with Skidrow Update 8
 


Instructions:


Install VirtualCloneDive.exe

Extract Civilization V.rar

Mount the extracted .iso(Either double click on Civilization V.iso, or right-click it and select "Mount (Virtual Clone Drive)"

If it doesnt auto-play, go to: My Computer--&gt;Right Click on the drive where it says: "[Drive Name]: Civilization V" and select "Install"

If your computer is DirectX9 ONLY or is DirectX10 & DirectX9, select DirectX9, else select DirectX10&11.

If it doesn't run, or you get an error, try updating your video and sound card drivers, and check the system requirements at http://www.2kgames.com/civ5/support/#systemreqs

Keep in mind that the game doesn't need to be installed at all, just put the .iso wherever you like, then create a shortcut on you desktop to that .iso

*The game must always be remounted before gameplay, and NEVER unmount it while playing, as this would be catastrophic.

Alternatively, if you know how to extract an .iso, just do that, which would eliminate the need for mounting.
