,JohnHolmesII,2011-09-06T03:06Z,"Sorry about the upload speed, I only get about 50kbps Up, so patience is appreciated, as is not throttling and FUCKING SEEDING!"
,JohnHolmesII,2011-09-07T01:45Z,It's healthy!
,lobo345,2011-09-07T19:02Z,"Is the game version in this 1.0.1.383 ?

Or earlier version as in most torrents?"
,Arcilte,2011-09-08T06:07Z,"Patched with Skidrow Update 8

This means 1.01.348"
,JustShyofGenius,2011-09-08T17:12Z,Is there any way to get the new civs with this?
,rapplet,2011-09-12T21:29Z,Hey mate! You should try magic iso maker. That'll let you open .iso files and even create them!
,deraco96,2011-09-18T14:19Z,"works, but havent played a lot."
,jnole93,2011-09-21T00:46Z,it says im missing d3x9_42.dll what do i do
,ynk21,2011-09-21T21:30Z,"I experience the same problem as @jnole93.
Can someone help?"
,TEMP1974,2011-09-23T00:42Z,"That is the dll for DirectX9
Download DirectX9, 10, and 11 and then try.
Or just X9. 

It is also possible that your computer cannot handle the game.

Another option is to click on DirectX11 when asked by the launcher, or maybe DirectX9 if you always selected DirectX11. just pick the opposite one.


Btw, I am the uploader, but I'm having trouble logging in so that's why suppourt tool so long."
,TEMP1974,2011-09-23T00:43Z,"http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ht/directx9xp.htm

try this"
,cruxzz,2011-10-02T17:05Z,"Hi,

please tell me how can I install it, because I don't know.

Or how can I upload polish language to this Civilizaction V?"
,Sherndog,2011-10-06T03:49Z,"Pretty fast download, 350kb/s, still downloading, have yet to play it."
,vickershaft,2011-10-07T03:49Z,"i keep getting this error code any advice

d3dx9_42.dll"
,TEMP1974,2011-10-10T01:08Z,"cruxzz, 
There is no need for an install. The .iso is ""portable"", meaning the dependent files are all within the .iso.
As long as you have a piece of software that can mount an .iso, just double click on the .iso.

vickershaft,
Do you think you're funny? Read my last two posts."
,manitoulinserach,2011-10-17T09:48Z,i just downlouded this all it is is just a bunch of vidieos whtf
,TEMP1974,2011-10-21T19:48Z,"manitoulinserach

I really don't know what you downloaded.
There are, in fact, a series of opening videos in many languages, but those aren't the point. Ever heard of .exe? or maybe you jsut have shitty autoplay setup. What did you do?"
,clarkievon12,2011-10-27T20:27Z,there is no .iso :'(
,AhmedNader,2011-11-06T17:26Z,"PLEASE help 
this thing happens with all ripped torrents 
they ask me for a password 
?????????? 
i will reply here if u have any tip "
,TEMP1976,2011-11-06T23:51Z,"The .iso is inside the .rar, as I said in my first comment. It cut the file size in half, so it was definitely worth while.

Ahmed, I think your computer may have a virus. I assume you have a windows box, as you must to play this game, then here you go: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials

It is also possible that you have shitty software that asks for a password by default. Could you describe your problem in greater detail?"
,donotstopthedance,2011-11-07T18:18Z,Can someone seed this torrent?I have 2 % left and there is no seeders:(

,beauna,2011-11-09T10:22Z,"The mouse pointer disappears once i'm in the game, anyone know how I can fix this ?"
,beauna,2011-11-09T11:29Z,"Dw, i fixed the problem, if anyone else has this problem just go into options-video options- and unclick 'fullscreen' :)"
,Chadly,2011-12-15T07:23Z,"Worked great :) I actually havent got into the game yet as its pretty damn late and im sure I wont be able to play just a few mins of it lol but the intro video looked good, abit sketchy but not bad. Im sure its just my comp, I know its not the greatest lol new but not great lol it did kind of look like the video just stopped, was that the full video? Stopped right after the old guy said I had a dream or vision of the future?

Very simple, im a noob and got this np :) thanks for doing this JohnHolmes or Temp1974 what ever u prefer :)"
,Chadly,2011-12-15T20:01Z,"Take it back lol full intro vid worked just now :) But I did notice the mouse cursur is abit off in the game. You have to go abit off the tab or whatever you wanna click to click on it. Not a big deal tho, game was free :) so no complaints just envy :P thanks again :)"
,shotgun9922,2011-12-23T17:41Z,Why are you guys complaining about the amount of seeders? there's enough. after i have downloaded i will seed 3 months 100kb/s
,plzonlygame,2011-12-28T09:40Z,"If you are missing any DirectX file such as ""d3dx9_42.dll"" in this case, google that filename, download it and place in the same folder as the .exe giving the error."
,ashenlar,2012-01-04T22:49Z,"Cheers mate, excellent torrent, I've been looking for something these easy to use for ages! Keep it up!"
,ashenlar,2012-01-04T22:49Z,I'd +1000 it if I could...!

,curuke,2012-01-22T16:19Z,"Works great! Thanks.

I would like to try the latest patches to see if they improve the  AI. Can the Skidrow (or other) patches work with this version?"
,unoto,2012-02-04T20:46Z,i just get a black screen for both the directx 9 and directx 10 & 11 versions. Maybe i just missed something obvious. Any advice?

,stinklash,2012-05-29T12:13Z,What program do you need to open this with
,JohnHolmesII,2012-05-31T15:52Z,The main download file need either 7-zip or winrar.
,Pcelite,2012-06-07T20:09Z,"when i try to run this it says ""Exception Processing Message 0xc0000013n Parameters 0x751C92A0 0x00000004 0x751C92A0 0x751C92A0"" what does this mean and how do i fix this???"
,JohnHolmesII,2012-06-08T15:39Z,"@Pcelite
Jesus, lord, I have no idea. That's defintely not my area though.

Post system specs thoroughly (i.e. operating system, directx's, last update, graphics cards, driver versions) and maybe I could help you."
,Pcelite,2012-06-10T00:50Z,"ok, well i fixed that problem but now it just says there is no disk in the drive. oh well"
