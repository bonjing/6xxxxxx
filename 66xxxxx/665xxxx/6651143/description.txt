True DVDrip with a very young Kylie Minogue and Charlie Schlatter (the cute funny guy from Police Academy 7: Mission to Moscow).

Optional English subtitles in separate idx/sub files, will work in Windows Media Player etc (move left or right to follow speaker, Australian style).

20,000 fans of the Australian singer Kylie Minogue turned up when this movie opened in London, where it became the most seen film during Christmas of 1989. Kylie proved that she was a competent actress, too. Since then, the film has been 'lost in distribution', only available on VHS and a bad VHS transfer to NTSC DVD. But the Australians have made a fresh, proper widescreen DVD edition which is perfect.

Plot from Australia 1957: The love of a young couple survives an abusive father, pregnancy, abortion, prison, and foster home. With interesting music and culture from that epoc, without excessive Australian accents. Rated 15+ for nudity, sexual references and "adult themes".

Widescreen, DVDrip XviD 2-pass 720x384, good stereo sound AC3.
Synch tested, runs well in both my standalone DivX players.
