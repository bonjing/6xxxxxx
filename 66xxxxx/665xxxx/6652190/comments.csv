,AlfNader,2011-09-05T09:02Z,calpix05: you must be the same asshole who has been uploading the fakes
,Akaforty163,2011-09-05T09:08Z,LOL! This torrent is a fake! It's an old episode. For fucks sake...
,marmad,2011-09-05T12:17Z,"@calpix05 & Akaforty163:
Don't you representatives of the copyright holders  understand that the majority of us here know what might or might not have a virus and how to verify submissions?"

,gogubbe213,2011-09-05T17:14Z,"This is not S04E08, it's from season 7."
,Esmad3,2011-09-05T18:55Z,Sucky qulity for HD. Just like the others. Heres the good one: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6653508/Breaking.Bad.S04E08.Hermanos.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H.264-TB
,bewareoblivionisathand,2011-09-05T21:01Z,Can confirm poor quality for 720p. No contest when compared to the WEB-DL version above.
,gogubbe213,2011-09-05T21:22Z,Scratch that. New episode.
,otnemem,2011-09-05T22:55Z,"I'd always prefer web-dl release, but I'd have to wait 12 more hours (sometimes even more) for my BrBa fix and I can't take it...

That said, yes, immerse's releases aren't exactly tip-top for 720p, but this one isn't as bad as the previous ones and it's not nuked."
,tr0gd0r88,2011-09-06T02:05Z,FAKE!!!
,tr0gd0r88,2011-09-06T02:08Z,"sorry not fake, just a reiteration in the intro"
,gjendem,2011-09-06T22:13Z,"Why do people vote + and say thank you?? It's bullshit, this is an old episode!

VIP on TPB have no liability obviously."
,DontPissMeOff,2011-09-06T23:10Z,OLD EPISODE - DON'T Download
,chaiyont,2011-09-07T11:13Z,"starts with 2 minute recap. This is not an old episode. a=10, v=10"
,DontPissMeOff,2011-09-07T12:13Z,Sorry for the previous comment. I got fooled - it's the right episode with some reminescence of earlier ones. Thnx
