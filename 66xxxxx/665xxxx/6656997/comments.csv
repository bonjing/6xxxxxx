You're a halfwit, what does it mean to be racist when we're all fucking homo sapiens? ALL of us came from HOMO ERECTUS, and after that it becomes harder and harder to detect our lineage. So curiously enough, you think any one religion is better than the other, let alone color? If that's not chauvinistic I don't know what is, but chauvinism = ignorance. All people suck, some more than others, you clearly more than the rest; your own short-comings and failures have left you angry at the world and your peers. You want to be angry, direct your anger into the government rally your neighbors, demand sovereignty, tell them your not a fucking child and start getting educated. We're all owned and payed for by the same people. The IMF(International Monetary Fund) Controls all of our governments money, and is a U.N. Entity. It's all a facade you moron and those hateful ideas and propaganda you've surely read/watched is just to blind you from the bigger picture. I'm as white as they come, and if you think immigration in the U.K. is a problem, come here to the U.S. I'm 1609Km from the Mexican border, you know how many Illegals we have here, hah nearly 1/4 of my city's population is illegal, and they're not even the problem, who cares if they work under the table and don't pay taxes, don't know about your government, but mine doesn't appropriate it's funding very well, and I'm sure yours doesn't either. The real problem comes from all the people with more money than they no what to do with just sitting on their money. That's a fucking issue, economies die when you hoard the funds, hoarding = inflation. Even better, how about all the rich fucks in your country and in mine renouncing their citizenship to avoid taxes on their income? Get educated, I don't mind opinions when they have even a hair of intelligence behind them. Ignorance is what bred this fucking world, the only way to make it better is to evolve, and since we're done evolving our bodies, our next stop for expansion will be our brains, don't stop too soon, I look forward to a well thought out and witty response."
