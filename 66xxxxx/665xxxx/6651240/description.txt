Only Connect is a quiz show programme first shown on BBC Four on 15 September
2008, presented by Victoria Coren. In the series, teams compete in a tournament of
finding connections between seemingly unrelated clues. Radio Times's listings usually
describe it as "a game of patience and lateral thinking".

professional analysts pit their wits against a trio of editors.
