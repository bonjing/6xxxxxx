The author

Gilbert Keith Chesterton (29 May 1874 â€“ 14 June 1936) was an English writer. His prolific and diverse output included philosophy, ontology, poetry, playwrighting, journalism, public lecturing and debating, literary and art criticism, biography, Christian apologetics, and fiction, including fantasy and detective fiction. Chesterton has been called the "prince of paradox". Time magazine, in a review of a biography of Chesterton, observed of his writing style: "Whenever possible Chesterton made his points with popular sayings, proverbs, allegoriesâ€”first carefully turning them inside out." For example, Chesterton wrote "Thieves respect property. They merely wish the property to become their property that they may more perfectly respect it.".


The reader

Sir Nigel Barnard Hawthorne, CBE (5 April 1929 â€“ 26 December 2001) was an English actor, perhaps best remembered for his role as Sir Humphrey Appleby, the Permanent Secretary in the 1980s sitcom Yes Minister and the Cabinet Secretary in its sequel, Yes, Prime Minister. For this role he won four Bafta Awards during the 1980s in the 'Best Light Entertainment Performance' Category. In the 1990s he won two more Baftas, one as Best TV Actor for 'The Fragile Heart' and one as Best Film Actor for The Madness of King George. His role in the latter also garnered him his sole Oscar nomination.
