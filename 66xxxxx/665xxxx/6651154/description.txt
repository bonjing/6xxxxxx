5 STAR DOODY'S REVIEW!
"This condensed version is for anyone who has the remotest association with the practice of medicine, be they internists, surgeons, nurses, technical staff, or counselors. This is the authority, and in a time of readily available but not always accurate information, this is the one source that can be relied upon, in an almost pocket-sized edition....While the main text is one of the absolute pillars of any medical library, this is the pillar to be carried with you on rounds. It is the final word in internal medicine and we all owe a debt of gratitude to the editors and contributors who have created this extraordinary authority in medicine."--Doody's Review Service
