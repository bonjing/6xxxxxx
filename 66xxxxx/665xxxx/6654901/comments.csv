[V],GoodFilms,2011-09-06T11:41Z,the imdb rating is 7.4 - not 7.0
,maggot_corpse,2011-09-06T12:00Z,rottentomatoes rating is impressive
,punk420,2011-09-06T12:25Z,Thanks mate...
,iridis_alpha,2011-09-06T12:48Z,"thanlks for this, is this the unrated version? I can see the Blu-Ray cover says it is but just need to be 100% sure before I download 6.5GB."
,iridis_alpha,2011-09-06T13:10Z,"the unrated version is 131 mins long, this says its 125 mins, can anyone who's downloaded it confirm its length is 125 mins ?"
,waninoko,2011-09-06T13:19Z,the unrated one runs 6 minutes longer..so I think this is not unrated
,dezontk101,2011-09-06T13:33Z,"Wooo 4kb/s for me... really straining the 40MB line. I miss public trackers :D

""This is not retail – there’s logoaway blurring along the bottom of the picture."" Is that true, or just a troller? I know the NeDiVx dvdrip has already been nuked."
,maggot_corpse,2011-09-06T14:28Z,"so, do we wait for unrated?"
,digidolcymru,2011-09-06T14:35Z,"Another fine release by Refined>
Top quality!!! NO NUKES."
[V],DownTYU,2011-09-06T17:11Z,"@BOZX
Mind posting some support to the thread ""seeking justice"" at 1337x; as also your torrent has been pwned...and also those guys who like BOZX show some support."

,king_pirate,2011-09-07T01:36Z,"Thank you! Been waiting for this since they announced the release date.
Will comment on quality and movie as soon as it's finished."
,wantsomerp,2011-09-07T04:42Z,what does it mean to have been nuked?
,hauntnut,2011-09-07T07:29Z,"I'll be sticking with this version; just finished the unrated version, and the new material isn't really all that great, and just makes the movie longer, when it was just fine to begin with. "
,Ashleynin,2011-09-07T07:34Z,nothing's wrong with this bluray ...these douches keep trolling at every torrent 
,maggot_corpse,2011-09-07T17:37Z,"awesome movie, kristen wiig is super cool"
,eluent,2011-09-07T17:40Z,"The file is fine. The movie sucks.

Unless you're very young you'll get the feeling you've watched it ten times before, you won't be surprised by anything etc."
,maggot_corpse,2011-09-07T23:21Z,probably the first movie with women as central characters which i really liked

,lailabagge,2011-09-09T02:14Z,"Fantastic! Funny! Fresh!

I've already seen it twice in the local cinemaplex, had to download for a third viewing!"
,MeToYou,2011-09-10T03:13Z,"Gosh so many people downloaded this and not ONE person had the decency to come back and confirm the movie length. Well just to let you all know - the NFO IS WRONG. This version is actually 131mins - so this is the UNRATED version.

REFiNED are a bunch of pricks for not PROPERING the nfo with a DIRFIX. many ppl have been waiting for the 131min UNRATED version when this was it all along!"
,deathwish422,2011-09-10T03:54Z,plz seed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,LEVEL_99,2011-09-10T05:17Z,"""This is not retail – there’s logoaway blurring along the bottom of the picture.""

,sanigene,2011-09-11T04:31Z,avoid this if you like good movies.  it's fucking terrible.
