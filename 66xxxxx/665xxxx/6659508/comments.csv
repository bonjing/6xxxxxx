,dackral,2011-09-09T01:02Z,Are you going to post the MSNBC/Politico GOP debate held at the Reagan Library last night?  I missed the first hour and would like to see it if you have it available for upload.  Thanks for posting these Freedom Watch and Stossel episodes in a timely manner!

no seeds?  PREVENT this problem for YEARS with USENET

posting to usenet would be VERY AWESOME

Posting to usenet is as easy as posting a torrent, but original seeder ONLY needs to expend upload bandwidth ONCE

This would make debates ddos-free and available for at least 1000 days!


astraweb $96/yr for actual-unlimited includes SSL

no link: DEATH to affiliate url spammers

Alternatively buy usenet in blocks (not unlimited), where blocks of data never expire and for some are more affordable.

media consumers who HATE paying to watch commercials:

pay for the content with your tv subscription, but ditch the commercials via usenet!
