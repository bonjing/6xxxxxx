Children's Film Foundation - Black Island 1979

The incredible upsurge in American UHF television stations in the 1980s created a huge demand for children's programming. One enterprising syndicator purchased the rights for a group of British and European films, originally targeted for the Saturday-matinee crowd. One such film was Black Island, released theatrically in England in 1979. Martin Murphy and Michael Salomon head the cast as a couple of British kids named Michael and Joe. Stranded on a remote island, the boys rather enjoy the adventure -- until they discover that two escaped convicts have also landed on the tiny isle. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi
