I download them only when they contain documentaries or something I want see badly, given there isn't a DVD or Bluray copy available. More often than not, when only 700 MB rips seem to be the only choice, there is a dutch DVD with one seed. And what's best, your subtitles never seem to be hardcoded. I thank you for producing 
these DVD copies, and for keeping them seeded for such a long time. This has made many not so popular movies available in proper quality. I wish you all the best!    "
