A Year at Kew 
The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew was recently voted the UK's favourite garden and in July 2003 it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Over a million visitors flock each year to enjoy the glories of this beautiful garden, which hold a special place in our horticultural history. However, Kew is so much more than just a garden it is also a highly respected centre of pioneering science, research and conservation. This twelve part BBC television series is a month-by-month journey through the garden, following the work of a committed team of experts offering a unique insight into the gardens, glasshouses, laboratories and museums that give Kew its reputation for excellence. In each episode we are introduced to some of the Gardens' spectacular monthly highlights, including the unrivalled orchid festival in February, the famous crocus carpet in March and the stunning autumn colour of the sweet chestnut, Kew's oldest tree. Throughout we follow the team of experts as we see how their enthusiasm and skills help maintain Kew's role as world leader in plant research, conservation, horticultural practice and as the world's most beautiful botanic garden.
