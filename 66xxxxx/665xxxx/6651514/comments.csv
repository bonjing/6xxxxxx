,liverpoolguy0001,2011-09-08T21:40Z,hi mate i download ur windows 7 and i really need the product key can you tell me where i get it from or can you send it to me thanks 
,khannies3,2011-09-08T22:24Z,"@liverpoolguy0001:

It doesn't need a key, just run the loader and restart your PC,
After restart, right click on My Computer and scroll down to see ""Ask for Genuine Windows"" logo and you can also see that your windows has been activated, so its genuine now and you can go for Microsoft Updates, Enjoy!!!!!
