A uniquely engaging description of the mechanics of the guitar, for engineers and craftsmen alike. Clearly written in a conceptual language, it provides readers with an understanding of the dynamic behavior of the instrument, including structural and component dynamics, and various analytical models, such as discrete, finite element, and boundary element models. The text also covers manufacturing processes, including both handmade and mass produced instruments.
