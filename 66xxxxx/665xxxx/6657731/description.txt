Here is another book (in traditional Chinese) on the cultural revolution which occurred during 1958 to 1962.  Within those few years, over 36 million Chinese died in hunger which was completely avoidable.  To put that number in prospective, the dead toll equated to 450 times the people killed by the atomic bomb that was dropped to Nagasaki. 10 million died during the 10 years of the first world war, but in 1960 alone, over 15 million died in China.

During that period, weather in China was normal, there was no war, no wide scale diseases  but tens of millions died.  Over the next coupe of decades, magazines, newspapers and official propaganda downplay the number of deaths or totally avoided the subject. The author, working as a reported traveled all over Chinese, collecting memories of those survived.  He checked records and statistics.  

The book is titled "Grave Stone" - a grave stone to be erected in the memories of people including those from the future.  This is a historical fact that none should forget.
