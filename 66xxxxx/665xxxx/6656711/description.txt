It's hard to believe 10 years have passed since that fateful day. With the coincidental release of P.O.D.'s "Satellite" album on 9/11/01 a somewhat successful San Diego band rocketed to the top of the charts and inspired millions to truly feel "Alive"

This fanmade album commemorates that occasion and pays tribute to the fallen thru songs like "America" featuring guitar legend Santana and a special World Trade Center mix of "Ghetto". I also included their new 2011 song...21 tracks in all


To quote one of those songs,"I believe this world believes in love"
