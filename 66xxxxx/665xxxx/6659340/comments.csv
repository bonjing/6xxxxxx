All the rest of this series have been great. Is anyone else having problems with these two?"
[V],TheExecutive,2011-09-08T16:58Z,"Looks like they are being poorly seeded
by whoever is left after I've moved on to the next show. 

Sorry I can't seed these all day every day, since I'm not saving these episodes. 

Send me a PM on SuprBay, and I'll give you the direct links to where I got these from."
