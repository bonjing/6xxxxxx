[T],FatFreddy69,2011-09-05T18:16Z,"Most of the very early BDRip releases are encoded in rush (to be the first who releases a movie ;-) with very low encoding settings, all done in 24 Hours or less.
So usually if you want the best copy (with highest encoding settings) you'll have to wait a week longer because a rip takes up to apx 6 days!
Look with media info at the encoding settings of the cinefile, amiable etc groups what a lame encoding setting they use, something like;
re-frames 3 or 4 / me=umh / subme=7 /  me_range=16 / trellis=1 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=1 .

My rip:
re-frames 5 / me=TESA / subme=9 / me_range=64 / trellis=2 / bframes=7 / b_pyramid=2
 Very rarely you'll see rips encoded with TESA (Transformed Exhaustive Motion Estimation Method) because it takes between 3-6 days.

Even though their files are 2x or 3x bigger they won't look any better, in some cases they even look worse.

So  I decided to put TESA64 in the title of my rips encoded with tesa, beginning with my previous upload ( THE MATRIX TRILOGY BDRip 1080p multi TESA64 [mkvonly] ).
All ripers/uploaders are welcome to do the same (include TESA64 in the title) if they wish. Cheers."

just wondering if you would re-up the movies previously uploaded with low settings
please reply"

Don't talk double-dutch, I never encoded with low encoding settings. "

,Night_89,2011-09-06T17:29Z,"A request 
Re-up Resident evil and Inception with TESA64

Encoding setting of previously uploaded resident evil

me=umh, me_range=24, bframes=4"
,Night_89,2011-09-06T17:39Z,"this is just a request
do it when you get plenty of time if possible and if not, don`t."
,Korbendallas,2011-09-06T22:00Z,Thanks mkvonly! for all your encodes! Personaly I don't think it's worth the time it takes with tesa. I always use ref=4:b-adapt=2:direct=auto:me=umh:merange=24:subq=10:rc-lookahead=60:analyse=all:trellis=2 and with slight higher bitrate you get the same quality as tesa.. in less than 8 hour... :) .. I haven't tried the new subme=11 yet...
,Night_89,2011-09-07T04:01Z,"@Korbendallas

I don`t want to say anything except you are an idiot. You can never get the same quality with higher bitrate which you get with the highest encoding setting
There are just two encoders which I prefer
1. FASM eBDRip who challenges you to compare his 2 gb release with whatever you got (CHD, WIKI, ESIR, METIS, 720p, 1080p) and you know what he is right, his release 2GB=xxx

2. mkvonly who encodes with TESA-64

the main problem with FASM is you cannot see the encoded setting, it`s restricted and does not show in mediainfo (2nd challenge)

in nutshell, you are an idiot who says you get the same quality with slightly bigger bitrate"
,Korbendallas,2011-09-07T08:16Z,"@Night_89

*lol* If any is an idiot it is you..
If I encode.. the source is always bluray.. You never encode a release twice...
How many different encodes have YOU done with the same bluray source and have YOU compared the results with YOUR own eyes?? with me=tesa or me=umh? 0?

And its not best using x264 core 88 these days.. it's rather old.. 1 year old?
And if you want high quality at lower bitrate. You should use 10bit x264 anyway..."
,Night_89,2011-09-07T16:32Z,"No, I m not an i...., you are

I don`t encode myself but I have downloaded many versions (WIKI, CHD, ESIR, METIS, KINGS etc) of the same movie just to compare the result with my OWN eyes

FASM and mkvonly are the only best encoders I have seen

there are some of the uploads, check it out and compare it with YOUR encodes 
and then talk to me about highest setting....................

,fasurvivor,2011-09-07T17:06Z,"@Night_89

just one one question

how can be the rip better than the bluray itself?"
,Night_89,2011-09-07T17:11Z,"@fasurvivor

I don`t know how but it has been proved maybe its a filter usage
check for yourself inception and avatar
and mkvonly`s TESA64 is just like the source

so many thanks to mkvonly for his efforts"
,Korbendallas,2011-09-07T18:35Z,"@Night_89

LOL... better than bluray source at under 3k bitrates. Hard to belive..
And you don't compare quality with your 22 or 24 monitor.. You use 55+"" screen or projector @ 90"" or bigger... then comeback and tell me which encode does look best... FASM or Bluray source..

And thanks again mkvonly for your encodes! Do you have spare computer that you let encode at tesa and merange64?.. Personaly I think it's smarter\better to use UMH and subme=10 instead of TESA and subme=9... and a more moderate merange.. like 24 or 32... and maybe raise rc-lookahead to 60 or so.."
,Night_89,2011-09-07T19:26Z,"@Korbendallas

""better than bluray source at under 3k bitrates. Hard to belive..""
it was impossible to believe but see for yourself he has done it 178min 1080p=4GB only (eBDRip)

and play on whatever you got (55""+, 99"") and compare it to the source

I don`t have 55"" but 42""
and X-men 1 of size only 1.86GB-audio included (Avatar is foooo......ur GB) plays incredibly on it even it was encoded QEBS 2.1 technique which is too old for fasm now (Avatar is encoded with QEBS 5.0 technique)

in the end , I don`t want to say anything except that if you prefer umh, this is not for you , go somewhere else or PROVE ME WRONG WHICH YOU CANNOT (I have provided you every detail to compare)"
,Korbendallas,2011-09-07T21:12Z,"@Night_89
They are not comparing the Avatar release you are linking to. Here it looks like they have used noiseremoval and then aplied sharpening..  But anyway... It's not that hard to get the encode to look transparent from the source.. not atleast in ""easy"" scenes with low motion.. it's in high motion scenes you see the diff.

And regards umh and tesa... ofcource tesa will be higher quality over umh. Like 1%.. (said by x264 dev. DarkShikari himself) (if all other settings are the same)... That translates to.. ie you wont see the diff but it takes like foreever to encode... so for me it's not worth the time it takes over the 1% quality gain.. nuff said.."
,Night_89,2011-09-08T00:18Z,"@Korbendallas
you are the one who does not want to check anything but wish to prove that you are right about the encoding setting only YOU know
Fine, conversation is over.

but you are really invited to check avatar to see his efforts (I know ""They are not comparing the Avatar release you are linking to"" but it is not only the usage of noise removal tool and sharpening)"
,fasurvivor,2011-09-08T00:39Z,"@Night_89

just downloaded the samples of avatar, x-men, inception and harry potter 
and i agree with you they are highly compressed but looses nothing not even a bit diff.
just wondering how he encodes and yeah the thing is real ""better than the bluray itself""
Avatar and inception-I have never seen a print like this, it`s brilliant. Zoomed it to 4X just to check if its noise removal or sharpening, it`s not, video quality remains the same, it`s like pixels don`t leave their place either you play that on 24"" or 55"" or ""xx""
thanks for the link
there is just one problem, you cannot see the encoding setting he used (in case someone wanted to try QEBS 5.0 but it`s xxx)"
