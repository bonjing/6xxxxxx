
Stelios Kazantzidis

Stelios Kazantzidis (August 29, 1931 â€“ September 14, 2001) was a prominent Greek singer. 
A leading singer of Greek popular music, or Laiko, he collaborated with many of Greece's foremost composers.

In Israel, he was a musical icon. Many of his songs were translated into Hebrew and performed by the country's leading singers. 
Yaron Enosh, an Israel Radio broadcaster who often plays Greek music on his programs, described the singer's ability to combine joy with sorrow: "This is the task of music: to touch the entire range of feelings...Kazantzidis could do this; he played on all the strings." 

Kazantzidis died of a brain tumor on September 14, 2001. 
His death was an emotional event for Greece, as attested to by the many obituaries in appreciation of his life and work. Kazantzidis was given a national funeral through the streets of Elefsina (26 km from Athens) which was broadcast live on Greek television. 
His music was also beloved by the Greek diaspora all over the world, capturing their feelings in the difficult post-war period.




"Kazantzidis was the voice of the people, of the weary, the exploited, the betrayed. And the voice of the refugee and the emigre, too."





Stelios Kazantzidis sings Vassilis Tsitsanis

A hallmark in his career â€” and an event of great importance for the musical scene of post-war Greece â€” was his cooperation with composer Vassilis Tsitsanis. 
It started in 1956 and resulted in Kazantzidis reinterpreting some of Tsitsanis old songs. Kazantzidis, thus, sung and popularized such rebetiko classics as "Synnefiasmeni Kyriaki", "Mpakse tsifliki" and "Ta Kavourakia". 
These songs, and many others, previously unknown to the wide public suddenly became cherished and sought-after. (wikipedia)
