Brought together in Stockholm by guitarists Peter Lindgren and Mikael Akerfeldt in 1990, Opeth added progressive influences and acoustic instrumentation to their brand of Swedish death metal. As the group progressed, it was very common for an Opeth live set to fly in several different musical directions, and an average song lasted no less than ten minutes.
