Are people using some therms for it so we know it's realy the original 24bit studio kwality ???"
,antiantianti,2011-09-11T07:37Z,softwarecheck you can analysis the waveforms with an editor like Wavelab or Audacity. If I remember correctly the dynamic range of 16-bit is 96db and for 24-bit is 122db.
