Description
------------------
This collection includes three fascinating titles featuring evolutionary biologist and best-selling author Richard Dawkins. In THE GENIUS OF CHARLES DARWIN, he explores how his hero's theory of evolution has influenced modern atheism; in THE ENEMIES OF REASON, Dawkins discusses his critical views on alternative medicine, spiritualism and astrology; and in the famously controversial documentary THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL?, he examines the powerful but problematic role religion plays in society, and how the abandoning of critical thought can breed fundamental extremism.
