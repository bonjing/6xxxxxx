S04E01 Looking For Justice

Mrs Lesley Calvert vanished on February 2, 1977 and her body was not found until seven months later. The decomposing body was found in manuka scrub on the farm's boundary, an area that searchers would have passed dozens of times. 


Mr Lindsay Calvert has lived under a cloud of suspicion for 33 years that he murdered his wife, Lesley, at their Waikawau farm, north of Mokau. Mr Calvert, who now lives in Rahotu, contacted the producers of television's Sensing Murder in a last-ditch effort to clear his name and see justice done.
