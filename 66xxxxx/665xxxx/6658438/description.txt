This enables you to have the Avenged Sevenfold Bat and logo on your facebook profile, using the 5 image previews along the top. :D

This only works on FACEBOOK on the PC. 

Instructions:
Import \'A7X_03.jpg\' as your profile picture, and import all the other photos making up \"Avenged Sevenfold\' (make sure they are in the right order). Once imported, tag yourself in each of the 5 images making up the words \'Avenged Sevenfold\', and they\'ll appear on your profile page! Enjoy (homemade)

NOTE: Dont post comments on how this isn\'t a hack yadda yadda, I called it a hack because facebook don\'t allow profile customisation like bebo. I don\'t know what else to call it.
