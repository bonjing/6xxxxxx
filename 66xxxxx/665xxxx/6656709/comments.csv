,edade10,2011-09-15T17:13Z,This movie is on German language.
,BraviaMan,2011-10-17T05:03Z,People keep seeding. I will seed forever as well. Everyone should experience this in 3D. 
,MVC78,2011-11-06T21:49Z,"Default language is German. There's an English audio channel though as well. Use a MKV edit program to take out the German track if you're having trouble getting the English to play. 

Movie looks phenomenal btw, great copy  "

,cowonline,2011-11-21T05:36Z,"Help, why is there double display?"
,nandosman,2012-04-07T23:06Z,"For everyone wondering why this has double display, it is because this is 3D, for TV with 3D tech. You can still watch this on normal screens using Stereoscopic player and conventional 3D glasses (red & blue)"
