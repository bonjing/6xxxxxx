,Kikee_31,2011-09-11T03:34Z,"hi scenebalance:) i've DLed several of ur BB eps but i usually have to re-DL from TvTeam or someone else because of the type of file i end up with from u. im not sure what to do with RARs (thats what they're called right?). why do u use this format and not the simple ""click-2-watch"" that dummies like me can actually use? Just curious.   PS. Ur files r always a quick DL (4 me anyway) and ur also usually first to post eps so if i knew how to watch them i'd always go with urs. thanx."
