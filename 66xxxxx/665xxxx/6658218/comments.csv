,walkingcougar2005,2011-09-07T21:08Z,After successful installation of this torrent Team Viewer will offer to update to version 6.0.11117. If you do it will  revert to the free version.
,shakuur,2011-09-10T07:39Z,"in the crack folder there are three files which one is the exe file,,,please explain more thanx"
[V],scene4all,2011-09-10T09:10Z,"@shakuur, You need to copy all the 3 .exe files from the crack folder over to the C:\Program Files\TeamViewer\Version6 and overwrite when asked.

And if running win 7 and your not able to overwrite the exe files, then you will need to stop the Teamviewer 6 Service, by going to start -> in the search type Services -> and then you should see services, click it -> then the services window should open -> search for TeamViewer 6, right click it and click Stop then  you should be able to copy the 3 .exe files -> after your done copying, start the TeamViewer 6 service again. Enjoy!!!"

,EnTek,2011-09-22T02:33Z,"AWESOME DUDE, HAVE BEEN NEEDING THIS FOR MY WORK SO MANY MANY THANKS.  MUCH APPRECIATED."
,cannabays,2011-09-28T18:20Z,WORKS PERFECT. TY so much!
,nanotdw,2011-09-29T07:31Z,Perfect & excellent !!!
,mlev1987,2011-10-03T18:53Z,this is the non-free version? I dont see any differences. Can someone please point out the differences? thanks
[V],scene4all,2011-10-05T13:06Z,"Yeah its a non free version, and the difference is when you go to About you will see ""License: TeamViewer Server Enterprise"". Which mean it will even work on servers, aka Full. Just make sure that you don't allow it to update and you'll be all good to go."
[V],scene4all,2011-10-05T13:08Z,Oh and totally forgot to mention that there are no more unwanted popups when you disconnect from a partner.
,bodlil,2011-10-09T15:32Z,"if this is the full version why does it say on the client pc for personal use only, it's fine at my end.

have I done something wrong?"
[V],scene4all,2011-10-12T20:25Z,"That's coz you need to install this on ur partners PC to, then only he wont get the license for personal use only. If you install this on ur pc doesn't mean it will be full for the other PC as well."
,lazinhobrrj,2011-10-14T04:43Z,"Here it did not work, installed in 2 pcs, but disconnects after 5 minutes.

ps: message does not show non-commercial use.
  only appears TeamViewer.com

Help me please.
Thanks."
[V],scene4all,2011-10-16T21:52Z,Did you even bother to copy the files from the crack folder over to the install directory?
,lazinhobrrj,2011-10-17T03:10Z,"Yes, I copied the 3 files to the program folder and replace the originals. I use a lot to support customers, can you be?"
,EnTek,2011-10-17T23:33Z,i got the same problem starting today 10/17/11.  it kills my session after 5 mins.  i guess they have fixed the hack.  damn!!!  now what will i do?  i do multiple session daily and cant afford the 750.00 license.  any ideas?
,mrnexus,2011-10-18T00:53Z,"it tells me that i have the 601117 verision and that the license is free.scene4all says thatwhen you go to About you will see ""License: TeamViewer Server Enterprise,will i dont see that at all,and i did copy the crack folder into the c:drive etc,"",I was never asked to overwrite when asked.please could someone explain that process please as i really need this thks, "
,lazinhobrrj,2011-10-19T02:02Z,"@mrnexus.
You need to copy all the 3 .exe files from the crack folder over to the C:\Program Files\TeamViewer\Version6 and overwrite when asked.

And if running win 7 and your not able to overwrite the exe files, then you will need to stop the Teamviewer 6 Service, by going to start -> in the search type Services -> and then you should see services, click it -> then the services window should open -> search for TeamViewer 6, right click it and click Stop then you should be able to copy the 3 .exe files -> after your done copying, start the TeamViewer 6 service again."
,lazinhobrrj,2011-10-19T02:05Z,Try Team Viewer Trial Reset. Google it.
,lazinhobrrj,2011-10-19T02:07Z,"He reset the period of 7 days of the commercial version, and is recommended to use a virtual machine, because you give each reset, it changes the identification of the machine, changing several things in the registry."

,EnTek,2011-10-19T05:54Z,I WENT AHEAD AND CALLED TEAMVIEWER AND THEY APPROVED ME A 6 MONTH RENTAL OF THE FULL VERSION FOR 220.00 WHICH AVERAGES TO $37.00 A MONTH WITH AN OPTION TO BUY THE $750.00 LIFETIME LICENSE.  IT WAS WORTH IT TO ME CAUSE I AM A TECH AND WAS TIRED OF TRYING TO GET AROUND THE 5 MINUTE CUT OFF OF THE PROGRAM.  NOT A BAD PRICE FOR $1.18 A DAY.   THANKS FOR THIS THOUGH.  IT WORKED FOR A MONTH OR SO.
[V],scene4all,2011-10-20T05:19Z,"@mrnexus, coz either u didn't install the setup that came with the torrent i uploaded or you  allowed it to update, that's the reason why it didn't ask you to overwrite any of the files, coz this crack only works for v6.0.11052.

@EnTek, Tell me one thing, did you choose non-commercial/personal while installing? coz its working fine here, even after five min."
,EnTek,2011-10-20T23:06Z,Yes of course I selected personal use and it worked for a while but now gets the 5 min cut off.  Reinstalled several times and on 3 computers and all get 5 min cut off.  Yes I installed correctly.  I am a tech!
[V],scene4all,2011-10-21T13:43Z,"Hmm, Well just to check if it the crack was still working. I uninstalled Teamviewer by removing all setting, then i cleared the registry and reinstalled v6.0.11052, then stopped the Teamviewer service, copied the 3 crack files over to the install directory and restarted the Teamviewer service. And its still working fine, the session was valid for 15 min without any cutoff, looks like ur doing something wrong."
,boOya83,2011-10-22T18:58Z,"Works perfect, TY.
Just follow the instructions guys in readme.txt
Thumbs up !!"
,EnTek,2011-10-25T00:12Z,I reinstalled it on another computer of mine (win 7 ultimate 64) and it quit after 5 min.
,EnTek,2011-10-25T00:13Z,HOW DID YOU CLEAR THE REGISTRY?
[V],scene4all,2011-10-26T01:21Z,"After uninstalling any program, the registry's stays behind, either u can remove them manually by going to the regedit.exe and deleting them (not recommended) or you can use a registry cleaner.

,killa_is_here,2011-10-27T05:24Z,same issue as entek. when i use it at home to connect to my moms house its ok(personal pc to personal pc) but when i try to connect from work to my home( domain pc to personal pc) or to any of our clients it wont last more then 5 minutes. if i go online and sign in then its ok thru the web browser but no file transfer function. it seems that as of the 15-17 of October something happened. it used to work before. but since Microsoft bought them who knows what they up to now.
