,mikedean1950,2011-09-09T00:08Z,"I have just finished watching this and it was very good, the sound was good and the picture quality also was very good. Thank you."
,argh666,2011-09-09T09:49Z,deleting... would have been good if you could have just hardcoded the subs...
,argh666,2011-09-09T10:23Z,http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6564474/I_m_back_bitches__-_X-Men_First_Class_(2011)_(R5)_(PiZ)  here is a better torrent with the subs for all the parts in different languages...
,albert2172,2011-09-09T15:22Z,I include subs because i wasn't going to have time encoding then and uploading it and at the same time getting some new stuff. So you could burn them into the file if you want. Knuckle head! 
,thefan23,2011-09-09T19:25Z,thanks alot for the ipod version!
,loulou75,2011-09-09T20:44Z,Thanks for continuing the handhelds have been looking for a while and was gonna give up keep them coming please!!!!  
,mallickabbas,2011-09-09T20:48Z,"First of all, thank you for all the torrents. They are great keep them coming.
Secondly, please upload the handheld for the HD torrents done by Holyroses for example gmae of thrones season 1, hanna, trust etc.
I will be extremely grateful."
,argh666,2011-09-10T01:17Z,no worries i just found someone that wasnt too lazy to hardcode before uploading... 
,jdoo7,2011-09-10T05:34Z,"What a bitch, this nice guy is uploading movies for us when he could realistically just keep them for himself and you're bitching about subs! Who's the lazy one here the guy who didn't have time to encode because he was busy uploading for us or the bitch who is probably on welfare, is 350lbs and too dumb not lazy to mix his own subs on. Thanks for the release Albert!"
,coorgman03,2011-09-10T18:49Z,goodwork . nice movie
