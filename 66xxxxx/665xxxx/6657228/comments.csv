,sisyphustkd,2011-10-26T04:20Z,I'm 10% through this very large torrent and none of the .rar files downloaded so far will open with either WinRAR or Z-Zip. Are the files corrupted or in some obscure format? Or do I have to download the full torrent before being able to access the archives?
,sisyphustkd,2011-11-03T06:24Z,The files open normally once the torrent is completely finished.
,Feenixx,2012-06-12T00:23Z,"Not sure what problem sisyphustkd was having, because I've only downloaded 5 percent of the overall torrent, but the first individual .rar file to reach 100 percent opened just fine. All I used was The Unarchver, a free program for Mac. I'm sure any basic unarchiver program would work just as well. "
