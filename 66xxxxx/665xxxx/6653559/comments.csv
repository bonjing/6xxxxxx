If you are referring to the very fine grains, then no, your computer doesn't have any issues. This is how HD videos are. They have very fine 'grains' all over the place :).

I don't know how to explain it technically :P"
,DeeJayVZ,2011-11-21T01:36Z,"If you wan't to fully enjoy HD-movies a computer screen is not the right medium. A Plasma-screen is your only choice mate. The grainy look is simply because the pixels on a computerscreen are to big individually and ask yourself, how far away from the screen is your face, huh? Get my point?
I'm watching all my HD-downloads via my NAS on my EISA-Award winning, THX Approved, DTS-Certified Panasonic Plasma-screen and Blu-Ray 7.1 home cinema system.
