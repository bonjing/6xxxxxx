Win7.SP1.IE9.lite.v2-IK (size: 700 MB)
______________________________________

This is second (improved) version of my stripped down version of Windows 7 Ultimate with SP1 (32-bit).

It\\\'s bootable image based on en_windows_7_ultimate_with_sp1_x86_dvd_u_677460.iso

This Windows is updateable through Windows Update (language packs cannot be installed).

There is no any software or updates added except newer Internet Explorer 9.

Some tools used: dism, gimagex, vLite, RT7lite, W7T etc. (many thanks to their autors)
______________________________________________________________________________________

What\\\'s difference with last release (Win7.SP1.IE9.lite-IK):

added: Remote Desktop Connection
added: Backup and Recovery
added: Windows PowerShell
contains all sound and network cards drivers.
removed: Minesweeper and Purble Place games only.
less services are disabled.
Windows 7 will be activated if SLIC 2.1 is found in BIOS.
Windows should be 100% software compatible now.
______________________________________________________________________________________

Reminder: Note that almost all the drivers are removed and you should have your computer drivers ready before installation.

If you are regular user you will not notice any difference using my lite version compared to full-featured Windows 7.

An autoattended.xml file is inserted in the image to automate the installation (Language: EN, name: Administrator, PC name: IK-PC, time: UTC+2h. All can be changed 

after setup). You need only to point a partition for installation and in 5-10 min Windows should be installed.
