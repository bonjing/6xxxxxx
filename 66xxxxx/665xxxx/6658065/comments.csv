,ea_jones,2011-09-07T18:02Z,The license keys must end in (.key) to work. The keys you put up are registry keys (.reg).
,RoseRow,2011-09-07T18:47Z,"Though You Can Use them Just Try It, It's Working.
Good Luck:)"
,JamsBand,2011-09-07T18:49Z,"The keys (if they are that) dont work even it you change the extenstion from reg to key. Why would you have files that are reg? 
Btw everyone its good to be back. Long time member since 06 but something happened to earlier this year where I couldn't log on. Finally fixed it."
