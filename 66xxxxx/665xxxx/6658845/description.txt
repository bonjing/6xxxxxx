While on their way to Asia to close a business deal, five friends (Anna, Tom, Joe, Alexis, and Chris) rescue a man thatâ€™s been left to drift at sea. Injured and in shock, the stranger overrides the yachtâ€™s autopilot and attempts to change the vesselâ€™s course, but instead wrecks the boat on a rock and the vessel sinks.
