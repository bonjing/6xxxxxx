 Back from the Dead is a documentary series which follows forensic scientists  
 as they hope to find evidence that will shed new light on the realities of    
 life in the past.                                                             
                                                                               
 Using the latest technology and also dramatic reconstructions, the series     
 attempts to piece together the stories of a child sailor, an American gunner, 
 a freed slave and a syphilis victim.    
                                      
                                 Enjoy!
