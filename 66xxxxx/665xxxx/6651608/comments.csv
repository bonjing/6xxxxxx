[T],Tyr3ll,2011-09-05T02:00Z,"Well ya exactly,this driver is newer but its version is older than previous and first catalyst 11.8 preview opengl 4.2 and even to latest official normal catalyst 11.8 WHQL,i agree.However its date of build is from august 29...new ccc also...
Strange issue so...a bit troubling also.
installed by now on my computer and i can confirm it is really catalyst 11.8 on Win7 x32.
As far as i know,this driver is still as beta driver dude.Or if you can learn me more about i will be pleased,indeed.Could you be a guru3d member ?
If you are on Win7,go on your control panel and 
device manager,and then you will see it gets only AMD sign.and not full WHQL certification from MS lab,bro.Most of preview drivers are often delivered with a certain mystery or should i say
few secrets,even ! but still fun to test,sure,indeed.
On AMD page,it's say still as beta driver...
May be i'm wrong or may be not...
btw,few mobility products are also supported...
I forgot to write that...what a shame ! :p lol
sorry for my bad then :s
That's why i always give the complete and full list to let you discovering and know all supported products as well,indeed.
Anyway AMD/NVidia both brands are curently preparing their very next and very newest openGL 4.2 driver full WHQL certified as finalised.
Guess,september beginning will probably bring us these new ones...
Just a question of time as i already know full WHQL certification is on a way for each brand for soon now...
This driver seems working a little bit better than previous version,i mean for me anyway.(lol)
XFX HD 5870... 
anyway i purpose,you decide,isn't it ? huh ? :)
But still fun to talk with you about this topic,sure.
cheers dude with all my respect,anyway,indeed."

,nights0ul,2011-09-05T05:38Z,"I have installed it and i think it's much better then 11.8 from amd website i hope you are right,thanks,i did a upgrade with this one,installed 11.8 and then make a upgrade to components with this one,i hope it's ok,i'll be back after a few days to see how it's working. Thank You."
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-09-05T17:05Z,"Hey bro,i was not angry at all ! you probably have missunderstood on the way i was talking about.
it was just a simple clarification.
btw,install well on my laptop on HD 6470M
however it was absolutely not the case with previous version,before this last one.
Great ! and all options work fine on ccc also.
For me,this driver is the best for my desktop XFX hd 5870 and my laptop...
Works very fine.
I really hope you will like and enjoy it and that it will working fine for you as well .
I'm not angry anyway,I'm just trying to be...
