Read below on how to convert movies to T-Mobile Phones:

After downloading from TPB the movie of choice I...

Converted the movie in Toast Titanium 10
(do only 1 movie at a time!)

*You can download Toast from TPB. 
I suggest 10, not 11 - more user-friendly.*

Here are the settings I used for the first conversion:

Device: 264 Player
Quality: Custom
>1920x1280 29.97fps
>Audio: MPEG-4 Audio, Stereo, 48000Hz
(If you know or can do better quality go for it)
Destination: (Other) - Make a folder named Compression1

Ok, this will take a very long time to convert movies. Figure at least 3+ Hours. The average movie 4GB downgrades to 400MB, downgrades in size but not quality.

Once you have the movie converted, Congrats, you converted .mp4, .divx, .mt, avi, or whatever is now .mp4 (x264).

Next you will need to convert it to T-Mobile x264.
Here is how you do that:

Download Realplayer Converter. This is another awesome program and is legally free.

Next you will open Realplayer and for the Device go to Cell Phones, then scroll all the way don to T-Mobile G1. 

Most of the other formats are 3GP (which bites butt! lousy quality). You want 264 (HD).

Drop your movie in there and click Start. Again, I would reccomend only one movie at a time.

If you don't want to waste your time and life away converting each movie, just check out my torrents! New added daily!

Thanks

,jesusshockwave,2012-04-24T10:54Z,This video works on older T-Mobile phones. It is 1080HD converted - t-Mobile G1. For phones such as Samsung Highlight (Ice Blue).
