Red Hot Chili Peppers - Californication 320 kbps {vigoni} {PURE RG}

Summary: Californication is the seventh studio album by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, released on June 8, 1999 on Warner Bros. Records. Produced by Rick Rubin, Californication marked the return of John Frusciante, who had previously appeared on Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, to replace Dave Navarro as the band's guitarist. Frusciante's return was credited with changing the band's sound altogether. The record was a notable shift in style from what was produced with Navarro. The album's subject material incorporated various sexual innuendos commonly associated with the band, but in terms of themes it is more varied than previous outings. Lust, death, contemplations of suicide, drugs, globalization, and travel are all part of themes introduced in the album.Californication is the Chili Peppers' most commercially successful studio release. To date it has sold over 16 million copies worldwide,with over 5 million copies sold in the United States alone. And as of 2002 the album had sold over 4 million copies in Europe.
