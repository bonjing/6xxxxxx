When filmmaker Robert Bresson made Le Proces de Jeanne d'Arc, he broke with moviemaking tradition by taking a narrower, more realistic approach to the famed martyr's life in order to make her life story no less legendary but certainly more real. As the title infers, the story centers on her trial and much of the script was taken from actual transcripts. Her life is presented objectively and roles are essayed by nontraditional actors. In portraying Joan, Bresson chose to present her as more deliberately intelligent and manipulative. He also lingers on the terrible effects the psychological and physical torture had upon the courageous peasant girl.
