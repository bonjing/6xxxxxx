Bio:
THE PROJECT HATE MCMXCIX are back with the darkest work in their more than twelve year lasting career: \\\"Bleeding The New Apocalypse (Cum Victriciis In Manibus Armis)\\\". The Masters of and beyond Death Metal present more than sixty minutes of assembled brutality, beauty, blasphemous symphonies and diabolical domination â€“ all gathered in six songs, which were recorded with guest contributions of Leif Edling (CANDLEMASS), Mike Wead (KING DIAMOND, BIBLEBLACK), Jocke Widfeldt (VICIOUS ART) and Christian Ã„lvestam (ex-SCAR SYMMETRY) and collectively mixed and mastered at Unisound by legendary producer Dan SwanÃ¶.

THE PROJECT HATE MCMXCIX started up in 1998 after years of talking between the two long-time friends and band leaders Lord K. Philipson and JÃ¶rgen SandstrÃ¶m. Lord K. Philipson was already widely known for his work with GOD AMONG INSECTS, LEUKEMIA, HOUSE OF USHER, LAME as well as stepping in as a touring bassist and guitarist for renowned bands like DARK FUNERAL, VOMITORY and GRAVE among others. In addition to this, Lord K. also served as the editor of that legendary early 90\\\'s fanzine \\\"Hypnosia Magazine\\\". His partner JÃ¶rgen SandstrÃ¶m had gained fame by contributing his crushing vocals on the first three classic albums of Death Metal legends GRAVE as well as handling the bass and backing vocal duties in ENTOMBED for over a decade, before 
joining VICIOUS ART and KRUX.
