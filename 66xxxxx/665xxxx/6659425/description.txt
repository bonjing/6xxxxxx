[b]Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D


"FROM THE DIRECTOR AND FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHER
OF BORN TO FIGHT AND THE ONG BAK FRANCHISE"


Source: Bluray

Encode:
firstly, this movie is a bit in english but mostly thai language.
I hardcoded english subs for the thai language spots.
The first 20 mins the plot is build up, during that time audio is either eng or thai with
eng subs, after that there are just fighting scenes with nearly no subs at all.
For those who dont like subs, well there arent that many in this movie.
There are some pretty crazy fighting scenes in it.
If you liked Ong Bak this movie shouldnt be missed.
enjoy

Video: 720x400 @bitrate 1800 2pass
Audio: Thai/Eng DTS to AC3 5.1 @384
Sample: yes, included
Subs: yes, english hardcoded for foreign parts only[/b]
