,KidaRiddle,2011-12-27T00:51Z,I have a problem with the sound on most of the episodes. If I skip somethis the rest of the show becomes mute and I have to start over.  I use VLC. Any tip on how to fix that?
,Oldmagoo,2011-12-28T16:21Z,"Try Media Player Classic Home Cinema, best player ive ever used."
,Oldmagoo,2011-12-28T16:22Z,If u get error when u try to use the player u must download DirectX
,Oldmagoo,2011-12-28T16:43Z,K-Lite Codec Pack 8.0.0 (Full) is what works with Media Player Classic
,ariip,2012-02-13T01:04Z,I use vlc as well. I had downloaded season 2 by itself from another user who has them separate and there was a problem with audio gone after the theme on episodes 1-9 only of season 2.  Epsidoes 10 on are fine in season 2. This would seem to indicate it is a problem with the original file and not the user who commented. I have not had that problem with any other downloads with vlc. I am wondering if you got your season 1 and 2 from them. I was hoping your files would be problem free. 
,ariip,2012-02-13T01:08Z,Additional note:  only those s2 1-9 the intro volume is much louder than the others that are ok and there is a repetitive little tick in the audio. Something may have been overloaded on ripping.
