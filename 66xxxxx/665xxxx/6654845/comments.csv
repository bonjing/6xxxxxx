,phish1999,2011-09-14T03:03Z,"Thanks for your uploads this year McLuv. I really truly appreciate it. I'm assuming we won't get any more live material until next year sometime, perhaps summer. I think Gordon is doing some solo/non-Phish stuff in March, which I'm guessing means they won't be doing a spring/late winter 2012 tour."
