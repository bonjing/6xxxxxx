,southak,2011-09-12T15:07Z,"what's the source, blu ray, dvd or tv?"
,taqui211,2011-09-12T15:32Z,"When you see something marked as WEB-dL release it's usually from some kind of internet distributing system such as hulu or more oftenly iTunes. Regarding this one, I'm pretty sure it is from iTunes."
,PorlyHung,2011-09-24T18:19Z,"I didn't think they were even filming in HD, this early in the series?  It's probably up-scaled or something."
,maqui211,2011-09-25T18:53Z,"I suppose it was not filmed on a digital camera initially, but rather somehow digitized after that. And the HD resolution should not be a surprise, because there a lot of really old films coming out on Blu-Ray discs nowadays, and those are in 1080p or possibly have even higher resolution."
,PorlyHung,2011-09-26T22:01Z,"*Update*  Downloaded it, the show intro is 4x3, but the actual show is in widescreen format.  Looks great, well worth the download.

Thank you taqui211!"

You can digitalize film to 1080 px and above and still getting true HD."
,mrmaestrom,2011-11-22T13:38Z,"Just an FYI, I was wondering what what they've done to get this widescreen, when the first two or three seasons were broadcast (and published on DVD) in 4:3 format. I was thinking they would have just cropped it, but I did a quick comparison with one of the DVDs and it turns out the opposite is the case - this widescreen version shows the areas off to each side that weren'e there in the original.

Also from my quick comparison, the DVD seems to have a sharper image, but at the cost of pixelation, and there's some posterisation with colours. This HD version has a softer image but it's still nicer to look at. This is going of the first episode, anyway, later seasons might be a different matter."
