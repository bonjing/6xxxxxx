,Ginso,2011-09-04T19:43Z,"Shit why when I install SKIDROW it uses 9GB of free hard drive space, instead 4.5GB ? And although I have good configuration and latest video driver I can not run the game because of extreme slowdowns in menu :( I applied two patches but slowdowns are still there , fuck ! Help please"
,Haven1989,2011-09-06T15:32Z,To Genso i had this problem before you just have to remove the xbox360 emulation files and that should do it
,Zurisadai,2011-09-10T06:02Z,"Ginso, Deactive the option V-Sync generally is the problem"
,Lodey,2011-09-20T04:18Z,So which crack should we use if Skidrow can't be used? The game won't start after a clean install due to a missing file.
,MisterDB,2011-09-20T05:50Z,"I install Skidrow from scratch.  Game plays and works fine.

I try to install Patch 1 and it says it installs then an error message happens about an ""ORDINAL IN XBOXLIVE.DLL""

Install Patch 2 and it installs then same ""ORDINAL IN XBOXLIVE.DLL"" error

Now the game won't start properly, generating that same ""ORDINAL IN XBOXLIVE.DLL"" error

So tell me - how is this update NOT usesless?"
,Lodey,2011-09-20T23:12Z,"Same thing happens to me, but that's because there's no crack included with these updates."
,MisterDB,2011-09-21T01:09Z,"I think I found a solution.  I went to Microsoft's web site and downloaded the GAMING FOR WINDOWS LIVE installer.

It downloaded the content and installed the updated files over Title Updates 1 and 2 (which I had previously installed over the main game) and the error messages went away and the game played.

Whatever the patches break, that updated installation of the GFWL software seems to have fixed, at least on my system.

Worth giving it a try.  Good luck."
,DarkSamus,2011-09-21T04:26Z,"@MisterDB

The messsage you got was because of an out-of-date GFWL software install. When you got the newest version from there site that fixed your issue.

The updates in this download work perfectly, but your GFWL install MUST BE UP-TO-DATE."
,MisterDB,2011-09-22T02:30Z,"Does anyone have a download link for the FULL offline install of version 3.5.89.0?

If they do, please post.

It may make sense to create a new torrent that has that complete offline file included so that folks can avoid the problem entirely.

Step 0 - install original Skidrow release
Step 1 - install self-contained GFWL Update
Step 2 - install Patch 1
Step 3 - install Patch 2

Boom - that might just do the trick."
,MisterDB,2011-09-22T03:15Z,"Ok, sorry for the extra post - BUT, I have good news.

I found the full offline installation of version 3.5.50.0 of Games for Windows over at Betanews:

http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail/Microsoft-Games-for-Windows/1187971879/1

It is about 70 meg in size.  If you download THAT version (3.5.50.0) and install it on the same system you installed SFIV AE (Skidrow Release) on, you should be able to install Update 1 and Update 2 and play the game with no problems.

I just tested it on a system where I cleared out everything on (no game, no GFWL files, nada - all removed and then CCleaned) then followed those 4 steps above - installed the game (skidrow) then the Windows Live 3.5.50.0, then Update 1 and then Update 2 and everything seems to be working fine now.

Hope this info helps.  Good luck."
