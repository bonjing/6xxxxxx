21 is the second studio album by English singer-songwriter Adele. Released on 21 January 2011 in the UK and most of Europe, and on 22 February 2011 in North America, the album was named after the age of the singer at the time of its production. While it shares the folk and Motown influences of her debut album 19, also named after the singer's age, 21 was further shaped by the American country and southern blues music Adele encountered during her 2008/09 North American tour. Her second album on the subject of a break-up, 21, like its predecessor, was composed in the wake of the singer's separation from an unnamed partner, and explores various themes of anger and revenge, heartbreak, self-examination, and forgiveness.
