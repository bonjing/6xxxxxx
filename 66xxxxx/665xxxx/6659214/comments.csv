,TTparty82,2012-06-10T22:02Z,"Hi I already said this on Vray torrent comments. I'm using Lion, with R13 and Vray 1.2.5.5. Everything installed fine, but when I press Render, it doesn't do anything. Vray is installed. Could this be because this is R13 and Vray is not entirely compatible or something? PLEASE HELP!!!"
,TTparty82,2012-06-10T22:31Z,"So, I installed R13 and vray 1.2.5.5, (OSX Lion) I follow all the instructions. Vray shows in render settings, BUT it doesn't render, when i press the render button nothing happens. HELP!"
,TTparty82,2012-06-10T22:33Z,"Sorry for repeating the same, I thought I deleted the older comment"
,TTparty82,2012-06-10T23:39Z,PROBLEM SOLVED! I copy VrayLibs root folder instead of the files inside
