,Chr1ll337,2011-09-07T06:58Z,"So, uhm, I'm guessing this game doesn't have XDG3-protection."
,jinxed33,2011-09-07T07:01Z,You have to have your drive reflashed to 1.91 to play your backups now.
[T],grrrrrgi,2011-09-07T08:15Z,"Works? I have Lt+ 1.91
Is the English only in the game or is it more Languages?

Funkar det? Jag har Lt+ 1.91

,Prestafisluktailla,2011-09-08T23:59Z,"This game works flawless!

The Language in the game is:
English, Swedish, Russian, Czech, Deutsch.

Any chance for Driver SF without Jtag?

Thanks for the upload!"
,Bateman82,2011-09-09T12:55Z,"@crispit1988, yeah you must have the latest dash, otherwise the disc will ask to update before you can play it. and we all know what happen then..hehe.. so flash back to stock, download latest dash, then reflash the xbox to latest LT 1.9 and it should work like a charm"
,DontKnow27,2011-09-09T15:42Z,why does it say RF (PAL) in the description? making sure

,Pontixptr,2011-09-11T18:53Z,"Yes it's finnish

Kyllä sillä on suomia!"
,redfox88,2011-09-11T22:58Z,"@ Prestafisluktailla

Games from this point forward will use XGD3, which  doesn't currently work with any drive firmware, hence only use on JTAG. This may be corrected with new firmware in the future, but I doubt it as XGD3 has storage capacity larger than any DVD-DL. Sorry pal."
,redfox88,2011-09-11T23:02Z,"@ Bateman82 

Usually games are not verified until the official day of release, which was the 9th for Europe (they should have released it by now, but they haven't) and the 13th for the US (which is usually what date the game is verified). It should be fine to play, but to be certain you should wait another two days."
,redfox88,2011-09-11T23:48Z,"Im going to attempt to answer a few questions that people are asking.

You must be using the latest dashboard in order to play this game or else it will ask to update. The latest dashboard was released in late June and reset your drive so if you haven't yet updated, you will need to update, then reflash to 1.91.

ABGX will not verify a game until someone uploads verified rip data, which will not be done until usually the day of the actual official release or the day after. In this case that day is September 13th."
,HerraPapu,2011-09-12T09:10Z,I wonder where is PS3-version of this game?
,Killopass,2011-09-12T13:58Z,I got out of the update-loop but now i cant play any burned games at all. I have the latest update dashboardand lt+ flash.Do i have to reflash??
