,Ki113r94,2012-02-13T06:10Z,"great series. watched it all in 1 day. If your watching on your computer it should be fine, but on the xbox only for season 2 ep 3, 4, and 5 after 10 min there would be no video, just audio. So i finished only those three episodes on my computer. the rest work great on xbox. Worth the download.
A=10/10
V=8/10
This and ""The IT Crowd"" are my two favorite British series. Downloaded fast too."
,Tinny_pb,2012-06-07T11:17Z,"A9 V8.

Plays perfectly in VLC and on WDTV Live. Most episodes are 640px wide, several are 624px wide, s01e04 is 560px wide.

S03e02 has 2 brief glitches that seem to have been part of the TV transmission. Another episode has slightly out-of-sync sound in its second half. If you want perfection, buy the DVDs.

Thanks for an excellent torrent."
