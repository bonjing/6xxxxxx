[S],velvet.,2011-09-09T03:46Z,"@programa: Why do you do something so exceedingly dumb as setting the anonymous flag on all the torrents that you upload, and then go and post comments on many of your torrent s with links to your other torrents?

Do you not understand that if you weren't dumb enough to set the anonymous flag on your torrent postings, then any downloader who appreciated one of your torrents would simply be able to click on your user ID to find the rest of your torrents?

In addition, do you not understand that as long as you keep settings the anonymous flag when you upload torrents, you will never earn yourself a Trusted (pink skull) or VIP (green skull) status from TPB?"
