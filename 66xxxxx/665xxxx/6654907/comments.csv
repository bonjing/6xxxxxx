,TSD_999,2011-12-22T04:23Z,"My Star Wars book collection is almost complete as of December/2011. The ones I don't have are:

. Lost Tribe of the Sith: Sentinel by John Jackson Miller;
. Lost Tribe of the Sith: Pantheon by John Jackson Miller;
. The Old Republic: Revan by Drew Karpyshyn
. The Old Republic: Deceived by Paul S. Kemp;
. Knight Errant by John Jackson Miller;
. Shadow Games by Michael Reaves and Maya Kaathryn Bohnhoff;
. Hand of Judgement: Choices of One by Timothy Zahn;
. Crosscurrent: Riptide by Paul S. Kemp;
. Fate of The Jedi: Conviction by Aaron Allston;
. Fate of The Jedi: Ascension by Christie Golden.

Are these in this torrent? Which format? After my collection is complete I intend to put them all in chronological order (almost there already), convert them all to EPUB and share here.

If you need any just tell me.

Thanks!"
