,SilentKiller411,2011-09-19T09:02Z,How do you replace the RCT3plus.exe with the cracked verison?
,JTPDynasty,2011-09-19T20:33Z,"@Velo_816: Sorry, but I'm not sure. The version in this torrent is 3.2.8.13.

@SilentKiller411: You need to copy the RCT3plus.exe in this torrent and paste into the RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 install directory. When it asks you to overwrite the old RCT3plus.exe, say yes.

The default install directory for RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 should be ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Atari\RollerCoaster Tycoon 3""; so find your ""RollerCoaster Tycoon 3"" folder and paste the cracked RCT3plus.exe into there and choose to replace the old one when you're asked."
,Hudokid,2011-10-16T10:35Z,"Hi thanks for the download but im unsure how to play i have installed the game and now have the rct3plus but am unsure where to put it. i have opened up all programs/atari/rct3/ and pasted it there but that does nothing. I also cant find a folder called insatll directory. im using windows xp on an acer travelmate 6592, if thats relevent. if you need clarification on what inve asked you just post. Thankyou"
,BallsOfSatan,2011-10-17T20:53Z,"@Hudokid ""Install directory"" isn't an actual folder, it refers to the directory where you installed RollerCoaster Tycoon 3. The goal with the rctplus.exe is to replace the original one that came in with the install with the cracked one in this torrent. Just find rctplus.exe and replace it with the one in this torrent, since you're running XP, it should be in ""C:\Program Files\Atari\RollerCoaster Tycoon 3"". Go into that folder and you'll find rct3plus.exe. Not ""All programs"", it's in ""Program Files"". Program Files is a folder on your C drive containing all your installed programs."
,Hudokid,2011-10-24T14:47Z,Thankyou so much for the torrent and ballsofsatan(?) for the help.
,Nupjook,2011-11-17T07:17Z,I cannot install it. It gives me an error (-5009: 0x8002802b) when I run 'autorun' or 'setup'. Is this because I have Windows 7?
,Nupjook,2011-11-17T07:29Z,"Why can't I see my last comment? Did someone delete it? I wrote that whenever I run 'autorun' or 'setup' I get an error (-5009 : 0x8002802b) and I wonder how to get around it, or if it occurs because I use Windows 7."
,BallsOfSatan,2011-11-27T04:15Z,"@Nupjook - I'm using Windows 7 and it worked fine for me. Are you using MagicDisc to mount the ISO? If not, try it with MagicDisc. Also make sure you downloaded the torrent completely, that way you don't have only part of the ISO file.

Another possible problem could be that you're trying to use the ISO while seeding the ISO. The solution is to keep seeding the ISO you downloaded and copy and paste that ISO into a different folder and mount the new copied ISO.

So here's what you should try. Start by making sure you're using MagicDisc. Now unmount the ISO, copy and paste the ISO you downloaded in this torrent to a different folder, mount the new copied ISO to a virtual drive with MagicDisc, and try running it. Again make sure the ISO was completely downloaded. If that doesn't work, restart your computer and try mounting it again."
,InFerNos1,2012-01-01T11:14Z,Ride ALLLL the rides!
,InFerNos1,2012-01-01T12:28Z,"Works great, only flaw is the screen resolution maxed at 1280x760

Just follow the instructions in the 'instuctions.txt'
You don't need the .ISO tool that is in the instructions though, I used Daemon Tools and it worked perfectly."
,InFerNos1,2012-01-02T02:08Z,"Found another bug;
When you press 'options' from the ingame menu, you crash."
,Jannyboy111,2012-02-10T23:50Z,"ok i managed to mount it but then nothing happened.
said I needed a cd.
do you know if it'll work using the normal rollercoastertycoon cd?"
,mzemma,2012-04-11T02:26Z,"Can anyone please explain to me what mounting to virtual drives is? So sorry if this is annoying, but I'm new to this..."
