,KebertX,2011-10-10T03:41Z,"Excellent quality.
One issue: There are subtitles over German speech, but not French. (The movie IS English, but there are scenes with Nazis and such).

-Possession of this gold is illegal. I should inform the police.
-Let's not play this game.
-Where did you get it?
-A friend. He recommended your bank most highly.
-I see. Do you know our terms, Sir?
-Yes, and you should know mine. This gold is what remains of my people. Melted from their posessions. Torn from their teeth. It's blood money. And you're going to help me find the bastards responsible for it..... Don't touch that alarm. I want Schmidt. Klaus Schmidt. Where is he?
-Our clients don't provide adresses. We're not...
-Not that sort of bank? Metal fillings, eh? No gold? Worried someone might steal them?
-Argentina! Schmidt is in Argentina! Villa Gesell! Please!
-Thank you. I would love to kill you. So, mark my words. if you warn anyone I'm coming... I will find you."
