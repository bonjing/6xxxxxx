                While cleaning the windows, Jackson spots Letitia
                kissing Dee Davies in her bedroom. Jackson goes
                berserk, attacking Dee in front of a social worker
                who's waiting to assess him and Avril as foster
                parents. Frank isn't much use in the parent
                department, staggering to the Jockey and leaving Carl
                to nurse pox-ridden Stella. Pissed-up Frank leaves
                the pub and accidentally gets on a mini-bus, waking
                up in a synagogue. He's discovered by Isaac, who
                promises not to report him because Frank's been sent
                from God. Frank thanks Isaac for his advice and
                hospitality by stealing his candelabra and legging
                it. When Jackson discovers Letitia is 'revising' at
                Dee's he goes mad. Through Dee's window, he sees old
                flame Alyah and draws a terrible conclusion: he must
                break up Letitia and Dee. Carl helps Jackson with his
                plan, but will it work?
