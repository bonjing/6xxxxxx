,filipDS,2011-09-05T16:39Z,Does the save works here?
,p2b,2011-09-05T16:57Z,@filipds - save works here ---> http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6648719/PC_Call.of.Juarez.The.Cartel.Rip.-TPTB
,kakajeet,2011-09-05T19:05Z,"To all who cant save the game, here's the solution. 
download this crack- http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6647686/Call_Of_Juarez_The_Cartel_-_Crack_Only_SKIDROW.
Then copy all it contents in the main game folder.
Then copy orbit folder files(in the downloaded crack) to C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher(by default).
then launch the game via the launcher(the one you copied to main game folder).
Wait for at least 45 sec to 1 min , the game will run and you will be able to save games.
IF IT DOESNOT RUN THE FIRST TIME, TRY IT(JUST DOUBLE CLICKING THE LAUNCHER.EXE) 3-4 times, THE GAME MUST RUN.
I AM PLAYING IT AND I AM ON CHAPTER 3. ITS A NOT BAD NOT GOOD GAME(JUST TIME PASS)."
[V],gansuk,2011-09-05T21:31Z,this contains the skidrow crack already so saves work
[V],gansuk,2011-09-05T22:11Z,@p2b tptb are a respectable group and dont post comments as you do on our rips. we dont bother them & they dont bother us. n i think im right in saying if kaos find tptb are been disrespected in anyway we would have something to say to defend them as they have defended us in the past. so give up with your comments if your not downloading. KiNG

,hature,2011-10-04T10:18Z,"I've downloaded the whole thing, and the fix. and the cracks over nd over again...Installed completely. but when I try to run the game, nothing happens. No screen, no start, no error msg. 

I use windows XP sp3, with directx 9c and core2due processor with intel 35ec motherboard along with 3 GB ram. Including ATI radeon HD 4000 series 1GB graphics card, that smoothly runs COD MW2 even without any problem.

NOW what should I do to run COD THE CARTEL?? PLZ ADVISE."
