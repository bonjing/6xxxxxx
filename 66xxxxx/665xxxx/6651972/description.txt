NBA Rules History (XVIII):
--------------------------

Take a look back at some of the rules changes that have taken place over the years.
(Changes/clarifications implemented prior to season, except where noted) 
-------
1980-81
-------
- 20-second injury timeout eliminated such that each team is now entitled to one 20-second timeout per half, regardless of injury, for a total of two per game, including overtimes.
- Red light, synchronized to light up when the horn sounds at the expiration of each period, added behind backboard.
- Officials shall not permit any players to play with any type of hand, arm face, nose, ear, head, or neck jewelry. Safety rules clarified to include all facemasks and eye or nose protectors must conform to the contour of the face and have no sharp or protruding edges. Also, all equipment used by players must be appropriate for basketball and equipment that is unnatural and designed to increase a player's height or reach, or to gain an advantage, shall not be used.
- Any time a technical foul is called on the offensive team, the 24-second clock shall not be reset. Previously, the 24-second clock would be reset regardless of whether the technical foul was charged to the offensive or defensive team.
- The 24-second clock shall be reset after a zone warning.
- Clarification added regarding free throws: a player shall not deflect or catch the ball before it reaches the basket.
- On a flagrant foul, the coach of the offended team selects the free throw shooter.
- The three-point field goal becomes a permanent rule.
- If any period begins with teams lined up improperly and scores result from this error, all points will be deleted and the period re-started unless ten seconds have elapsed from the game clock. If ten seconds have elapsed, all points count and teams shoot for the same baskets.
