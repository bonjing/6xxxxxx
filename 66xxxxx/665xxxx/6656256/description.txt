It's surprising to realise just how thoroughly sushi -- the Japanese art of fish-based cuisine -- has colonised the more sophisticated areas of Great Britain (and some not so sophisticated). What was once considered exotic fare is now something that many of us are addicted to. And the reasons arenâ€™t difficult to understand -- apart from the absolutely delicious nature of the food itself, it's the undisputed healthy aspects of sushi that allows us to enjoy the food without feeling in the slightest guilty. A great part of the revolution in food bought about by sushi in this country is undoubtedly due to the remarkable success of the YO! Sushi chain of restaurants, and YO! Sushi: The Japanese Cookbook by Kimiko Barber is both the bible of this new/old cuisine, as well as an inspirational primer for those wishing to try their hand at preparing sushi themselves.
Sushi is, of course, not the most straightforward of food to prepare at home (in contrast to the speedy nature with which we are served it in YO! Sushi restaurants), but Barber, in straightforward, well-illustrated instructions gives us the most comprehensible of directions. From slicing fish for sashimi and sushi to making hand rolls (the latter, of course, being one of the key ingredients in sushi cuisine), up to preparing such exotic dishes as Okononiyaki (a savoury Japanese pancake) and the delicious fried dumplings filled with minced vegetables called Gyoza: it's all here, laid out in the most straightforward fashion. There are, of course, those tempting deserts which slide by us on the conveyor belts that are so intrinsic a part of the YO! Sushi restaurants, and there will be quite a few people -- inspired by visits to the restaurants -- who will be checking to see if this still exotic cuisine is within their own culinary range. --Barry Forshaw
