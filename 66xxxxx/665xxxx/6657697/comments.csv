- ""Due to the disabling of Editing and Deletion of torrents I have to re-upload this Fast.Five.2011.NTSC.DVDR-FiCODVDR torrent.
I found an .!ut file in the hashed Sample folder which made the torrent appear without seeders. 

If you are downloading this torrent:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6657697/Fast.Five.2011.NTSC.DVDR-FiCODVDR,
then delete it and download this instead. Sorry about this.""
