This is the story of the 1996 EVEREST Film Expedition, a MacGillivray Freeman production in association with Arcturus Motion Pictures. Filmed in breathtaking IMAXÂ® photography, EVEREST is the dramatic true story of a team of climbers who found hope, strength and triumph in the wake of tragedy. Their successful ascent of Mount Everest just days after fellow mountaineers and friends died there, is a compelling story about the human spirit and a mountain they love, respect and sometimes fear.

Says producer Greg MacGillivray: "Great fictional films impart an emotional story of a life and death struggle. Our large format films, being non-fiction, have never before had that same urgency and poignancy. But with EVEREST we have these powerful story elements in a real, nonfiction film, photographed as it all happened in the most realistic format yet invented."

Shown on the tallest screens in the world, EVEREST takes audiences across creaking icefalls and gaping chasms, up dangerous, towering cliffs, through a harrowing rescue, and into the danger zone of oxygen-thin altitude. The 40-minute film also reveals how this tallest mountain was formed and continues to evolve, how high altitude challenges a climber's physical and mental capabilities, and how Sherpa culture permeates the Mount Everest experience.

EVEREST is co-directed by David Breashears, who summited Mount Everest himself to bring back this remarkable chronicle. The stars are the expedition members: Ed Viesturs, Araceli Segarra, Jamling Tenzing Norgay, Sumiyo Tsuzuki, Paula Viesturs and the Sherpas who helped carry the heaviest camera ever to film on Everest's peak.
