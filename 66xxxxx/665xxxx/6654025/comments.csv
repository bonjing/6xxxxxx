,RailGamer,2011-09-06T21:06Z,"Please visit my website: http://railworks.ezweb123.com

Thank you!"
,Rangler,2011-09-08T17:35Z,Thank you very much for the package! =
,tpb_4_ever,2011-09-08T18:00Z,Are you going to upload the files for railworks 3 the day it comes out.
,pop72,2011-09-14T03:38Z,Once again thanks RailGamer. You make an old bloke happy.
,zzw1983,2011-09-16T13:28Z,your website seems to be down :(
,stoke1,2011-09-18T12:00Z,Thanks for this :) do you have Iron Horse House class 40? thanks....
,RailGamer,2011-09-18T23:57Z,"They took it off me after a trial. I needed to upgrade which costs money, which unfortunately i don't have. Sorry :("
,RailGamer,2011-09-19T00:00Z,Right people. I need a list of every add-on released for RailWorks so that i can put a big add-on pack on here. Please email it to me at WiredShock@gmail.com
,Rangler,2011-09-22T19:25Z,is it possible to download the update to the version RailWorks3  ?
,tristen1230,2011-09-23T01:42Z,Upload more! I love this. Upload all the modern ones!
,nigelbear2011,2011-09-23T12:43Z,any news on the big file yet??
,RailGamer,2011-09-23T16:33Z,My copy of railworks has upgraded to Train Simulator 2012. I need you guys to explain to me how to seperate railworks from steam. Then i shall upload Train Simulator 2012 today!
,zzw1983,2011-09-23T17:21Z,is there a way you can have the update install in a different location or from scratch and then copy the files? Long shot and it may not work. We'll probably need a new crack.
,Rangler,2011-09-23T17:41Z,"RailGamer.
Download please TS2012 (RW3)"
,zzw1983,2011-09-23T17:50Z,"A warning to anyone considering 'upgrading'. TS 2012 is a total flop. Infinite problems, and unacceptable performance contrary to what they have reassured us for months. Do yourself a favour and keep RW2."
,RailGamer,2011-09-23T19:59Z,I have found the crack i think. The guy who has uploaded it has put a password on the file so i am just cracking the password which may take a few hours and i will then upload Train Simulator 2012 with every add-on included to date.
,Rangler,2011-09-23T20:20Z,"RailGamer.
Download TS2012.Vsya hope for you! Good luck!"
,zzw1983,2011-09-23T20:23Z,Railgamer: If the crack is from a torrent make sure you check the upload date. There's no way a crack could have been made in a few hours. The full version of the game was released only a couple hours ago. You may be dealing with a fake file or a virus. I saw a 'crack' for Railworks 3 train Simulator in a torrent dated 9/9. Just a word of warning.
,zzw1983,2011-09-23T20:24Z,sorry 9/19.
,zzw1983,2011-09-23T20:27Z,ok i checked the so-called 'railworks 3 train simulator 2012 crack by SKIDROW' and it has been confirmed FAKE and a VIRUS
,RailGamer,2011-09-23T20:40Z,I have managed to seperate Train Simulator 2012 from Steam but as no crack is available. It keeps prompting. Please Login To Steam. then crashes we now just need a crack so that it launches i have tried using some of SkidRow earlier ones but then crashes when you select play Train Simulator 2012
,RailGamer,2011-09-23T21:14Z,Does anyone here know how to crack a game. I will upload Train Simulator 2012. But it will need cracking before you can play on it.
,Rangler,2011-09-23T21:41Z,should be selected on SKIDROW TS2011 (Steam - game version)
,Rangler,2011-09-23T21:59Z,"Horseshoe Curve Expansion Pack 
you have?"
,Rangler,2011-09-24T15:30Z,Upload somebody RW3! =
,zzw1983,2011-09-24T15:42Z,"Rangler: it's no use if there's no crack for it. It only came out 24 hours ago. Besides, there have been hundreds of reported bugs and serious performance issues. I personally would wait 6 months for this. It is just not worth it right now. "
,RailGamer,2011-09-24T17:22Z,Train Simulator 2012 is a big downer in my opinion it does however support multi-core processors now but i would wait for them to update railworks and allow them to fix the amount of lag and poor performance graphics wise even the loading screens lag and my processor is an AMD Phenom II X4 965 @ 3.40Ghz
,domthepom,2011-09-25T03:54Z,"can anyone up load the west coast mainline? please i downloaded legitimately from steam but had an issue with it, i had to uninstall it and now i dont know how to download it again..."
,Rangler,2011-09-25T10:38Z,"Horseshoe Curve Expansion Pack 
you have? ="
,Opake,2011-09-25T12:38Z,"What happened to your website, RailGamer ?"
,Opake,2011-09-25T18:01Z,"@domthepom
Return to the Steam store where you bought the DLC and you will be able to download it again.

I downloaded the rpw files of Glasgow Airport and West Coast Main Line North but the Class 380 is missing in the first one and the Mk3a + Class 86 in the second one. I will be grateful if someone includes these trains in new rpw files."
,Thootjeajax,2011-09-25T18:07Z,"@Opake
Do you run Railworks via Steam? If that is so, there is nothing you can do about those missing files, steam has secured railworks for illegal downloads.
I suggest you download the railworks 2-skidrow from tpb en install the add-ons in that one.
(That one doesn't have the steam-security)"
,Opake,2011-09-25T19:44Z,"@Thootjeajax
I do and you are probably right. But this is strange because the P42DC Genesis runs just fine on my Steam version (TS2012). I don't know why they didn't put the protection on all the DLC..."
,Opake,2011-09-25T20:40Z,"Sweat, SKIDROW just released TS2012 with the Horseshoe Curve DLC !"
,Thootjeajax,2011-09-25T21:02Z,"@Opake you're right, it's only with some of them, so i don't know why they didn't protect all, but they protected it to prevend people to download illegal.

Btw where did you find the Skidrow TS2012? I want it :P"
,Thootjeajax,2011-09-25T21:04Z,EDIT: I found it on rutracker and it's now also on Pirate Bay! Downloading it now!!
,Dr_Demented,2011-09-26T00:58Z,I get an odd missing .dll error when I try to run one of the scenarios. Is there something lacking in the file?
,Opake,2011-09-26T02:50Z,"I ripped the Horseshoe Curve (from SKIDROW) into a RWP file. It works well on my legit Steam version, there is no protection. I'm going to send the file to RailGamer."
,stoke1,2011-09-26T11:48Z,"hi guys,just want to know if i install this will i loss any of my other add ons ? as i hear that people are lossing routes and other addons. thx...."
