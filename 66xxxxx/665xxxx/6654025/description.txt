About the Game
The P42DC Genesis add-on is an accurate recreation of this familiar and well-liked passenger diesel locomotive complete with Amtrak Superliner passenger cars. The most widely used of Amtraks passenger locomotives, the Genesis is able to operate on all Amtrak lines, making it a common sight on passenger services across the US.

Introduced in 1992 and made up until 2001, the P42DC Genesis is noted for its low roof profile which allows it to use all Amtrak lines, while its V16-cylinder 4,250-horsepower diesel engine and 4 DC traction motors enable it to reach a top speed of 110mph. This 121-ton General Electric locomotive has been modeled in superb detail for RailWorks by G-Trax Simulation with a great many features to make the driving experience as realistic as possible, including correct sounds for the engine generator and K5LA horn and accurately-recreated control systems.

The Amtrak Superliners included with the Genesis feature different passenger views and functioning brake status lights, which allow the train crew to check visually if each carâ€™s brakes are working properly.
