,FluxCapacitor,2011-09-10T05:42Z,"thanks kimm!  interesting, two of those citations are from the same study, a 7-year study of 507 children and the other one is a 5-year study of 534 children.

here is another article which directly addresses the 507-child study and addresses urine studies which were critical in the other one.  skipping straight to the section that describes methodological flaws in current studies:

--

SCENIHR based their statement about the safety of dental amalgam also on two children amalgam trials. These studies show severe methodical flaws:
In two randomised trials on children it was evaluated whether mercury containing dental amalgam had adverse neuropsychological or renal effects [277,278]. Healthy children were randomised to either amalgam or composite surface restoration. Two children in the amalgam group died (one possibly by committing suicide) and were excluded from the study.
Power calculation (binomial - adverse event versus no event) indicates that psychological illness, having prevalence of 6.7% in the composite-treated children, would have to have had a prevalence of at least 14.5% in the amalgam group to have an 80% chance of being proven statistically (observed was 9.0%). Similarly for neurological illness, observed prevalences in the composite group (0.4% composite, 1.5% amalgam) would have needed at least 4.5% prevalence in the amalgam group to be significant. From the authors it was concluded that ""there is no reason to discontinue use of mercury amalgam"" [277] and that ""dental amalgam [...] emits small amounts of mercury vapor"" [278].
The first conclusion is a classic error: Due to its lack of power, the study provides false reassurance that mercury is 'safe'. To effectively evaluate the effect sizes seen, the trial should have been much larger (1500-2500/group). 
[...]
The conclusion of Bellinger et al. [277] that ""there is no reason to discontinue use of mercury amalgam"" is amazing, because possible adverse effects may need more than five years of mercury exposure to develop. If mercury is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, the disease may need up to 50 years to be diagnosed clinically [44].
One of the included criteria for the two studies was ""no interfering health conditions"" including neurodevelopmental disorders. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta (USA) reports that 1 in 6 American children have a neurodevelopmental disorder. However, above mentined papers conclude that amalgams should remain a viable clinical option in dental restorative treatment [278] and they did not exclude use on children with neurodevelopmental disorders - exactly the type of child, however, which they excluded from their studies. As mercury exposure during pregnancy may be the prime cause of neurodevelopmental disorders [46,61,245], this conclusion from the children amalgam is unsafe for the public.

fyi kimm 'debunked' is code for 'disinfo.' it doesn't add anything to your argument and it suggests you are shill for the industry."
,FluxCapacitor,2011-09-19T04:46Z,"Fine with me if you are satisfied with the official pronouncements of government agencies and professional associations about the safety of mercury in amalgam.  Personally I am appalled that a known poison is being put in people's mouths and that dentists continue to make money doing it despite the evidence that mercury is leeching off of their dental fillings.  Mercury has been known to be a poison since before it was used in dental fillings, and mercury poisoning has known symptoms which have been matched with the effects of mercury in dental fillings, so it seems like a no-brainer to me.  I only wish that I had known about this or that my parents had known or had a choice for other dental fillings before my own mercury fillings were installed, but I was only a child so I couldn't have done anything about it.  I think it's deplorable that children are subjected to having mercury fillings put in their mouths despite the clues that multiple sclerosis, alzheimer's and lifelong allergies are connected to them; and I think it's doubly evil for so-called doctors to do this to children as part of an experiment to see how it affects them when experiments have already been done on animals that have established the effects, but not only that, they are only studied for five or seven years when some of the symptoms of constant low level mercury poisoning are known to take decades to present themselves.  If you are looking for more references why don't you see the hundreds of references in Quecksilber, or the 4321 references in Rooted, or the 500 references in Gammal's Open Letter the the Deans of Dentistry; but I doubt you are looking for references.  For everybody else out there who has the least amount of sense, like the other guy said, mercury isn't safe just because dentists say it is, and I hope that uploading these movies has caused at least some people to learn that mercury is in their dental fillings and that dead teeth are a constant source of bacterial poisoning who wouldn't have known or even thought about it if these movies weren't available on the net to causally peruse."
