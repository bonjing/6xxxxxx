 People are given help finding their perfect home, even if it needs a bit of   
 renovation.                                                                   
                                                                               
 Kirstie and Phil travel to Torquay where they attempt to find two homes for 
 two very different couples. Sam and Jamie want Kirstie's help to put a tough
 couple of years behind them and find them their dream property. Football coach
 Geoff and his wife Sharon need Phil's help in finding the right property for
 their family. The problem is they both have very different views in what they
 are after.
