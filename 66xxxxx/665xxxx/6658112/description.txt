HERE'S AN ABSOLUTE VALUE FOR ANYONE WISHING TO MASTER PRE-CALCULUS!

Calculus is a cinch with pre-calculus under your belt -- and calculus is a must for any science, math, or computer science major. Pre-calculus by itself deepens your understanding of mathematics and improves your performance on standardized pre-college and college tests. Now anyone can master pre-calculus -- without formal training, unlimited time, or a genius IQ. In Pre-Calculus Demystified, best-selling author and teacher Rhonda Huettenmueller breaks pre-calculus down into manageable bites with practical examples, solutions, graphs, practice questions, and a fresh approach that removes the mystery from pre-calc concepts.

Unlike most books on pre-calculus, general concepts are presented first -- and the details follow. In order to make the process as clear and simple as possible, long computations are presented in a logical, layered progression with just one execution per step.

This entertaining self-teaching course makes it fun and easy to learn precalculus fast. Get ready to:

    * Perform better on placement exams
    * Avoid confusion with detailed examples and solutions that help you every step of the way
    * Conquer such topics as absolute value, nonlinear inequalities, inverses, trigonometric functions, and conic sections.
    * Get comfortable with functions, graphs of functions, logarithms, exponents, and more
    * Master a subject that will help you with calculus, geometry, trigonometry, physics, chemistry, computing, and engineering
    * Reinforce learning and pinpoint weaknesses with questions at the end of every chapter, and a final exam at the end of the book

Pre-Calculus Demystified is the perfect shortcut to learning or brushing up on this important subject.
