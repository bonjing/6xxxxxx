,VitalogyPJ,2011-09-05T11:15Z,Still don't understand why you don't decompress the file before post -_-
,s0litaire,2011-09-05T12:38Z,"@VitalogyPJ PLEASE think and google before you type! would save yourself some embarrassment.
(hint: video is already compressed!)"
,MrE159357,2011-09-05T19:06Z,"He means, why was this posted as RAR split files as torrents.  If it were proper then it would just be the video.  There are too many idiots who password protect their split files and make you take Scientology quizzes to get the pass.  (yes, I am joking about the type of questionnaire that you have to answer).

As long as the skull is there, I have no worries.
Thx for the share!"
