,joester8,2011-09-07T00:58Z,Says I'm missing _x86_rwdi.exe when i try and start the game. Anyone know what I need to do? And if the file can be sent I'd appreciate that as well. Thanks. j_edw@yahoo.com 
,Dragday,2011-09-07T01:57Z,does the coop work now?
,brutal_product,2011-09-07T02:20Z,"all reloaded rls:
mount iso (run steambackup as ADMIN) point to program files (or x86 program files for 64bit users), apply crack from iso, run shortcut as ADMIN, works. 
apply update 1, works (saves keep, tho I don't think you can manually save, just checkpoints). applied crack update-this torrent- fucked up all the words on the screen.
shit.
game still plays tho, just cant see the options to try and find a LAN workaround.
.Dude. +1"
,brutal_product,2011-09-07T02:21Z,"^^^ps..also allowed game in firewall on both systems. guess its time to re-install w/o this update.

honestly tho, game plays like a shitty console port, go figure."
,IthinkImadeitworse,2011-09-07T02:27Z,"Alright. Here's a fix for all of you having troubles with saves.

*this is for the reloaded release*

This update is to be applied with the original crack. The original crack has a folder in it named out. Within that folder are two folders named profiles and save. This is where your saves will go. Without these folders you will not get your saves! Copy them over, or create them, as they are originally empty. Good luck, and I hope this helps.

*This fix is not meant to work with this updated crack. I used the original located within the reloaded disc.*"
,TheZentetsu,2011-09-07T04:06Z,"Ok, so I did what Ithink said to do about the out folder but it did not work.. So I started thinking he is on to something because it needs folders to save to. So I uninstalled the game and re-installed orginalDead.Island.Cracked.Fullrepack-ALI213 [.Dude.[ put an out folder in the main directory and then inside the out folder put Profiles and a Save folder.. Restarted game and got to a save point exit the game and bam! The continue icon poped up, got out of the game went to windows restarted game and it works now with saves and key bindings saved also.. I Have not used this update yet but I'm thinking you can as long as your out folder is in the main directory."
,kushal73,2011-09-07T04:34Z,its just a bunch off dll files how to install? usually in power iso/win rar there is an exe install file
,kushal73,2011-09-07T04:38Z,nvm i see wht i did wrong
,call_me_nobody,2011-09-07T07:21Z,"i updated, but still not a darn picture... just blackscreen when i open the game...

And wierd sounds comes when i quit the game..."
,blacklabel67k,2011-09-07T08:43Z,"Horribly confusing directions dude....

So basically just create 2 folders called ""Profiles"" and ""Saves"" in the Out folder?"
,gaulitzzz,2011-09-07T15:52Z,..
,Grufil,2011-09-07T15:54Z,Only thing I wish is that I could save the game. Also it would be nice if game would save video options.
,geuheo28,2011-09-07T22:39Z,are you guys serius? i have been downloading this in 10 hours now and have been uploading 10 g and downloading 500mb. fuck this im waiting for the realese day instead and then i will start to noob tube.

Don't waste your time."

,saequa253,2011-09-08T06:31Z,can anyone confirm that this is not a fake?
,someguysname,2011-09-08T07:43Z,"For some that still get the black screen there is a wmf dist installer in the redist folder that is required by the game which prevents any of the wmv format videos to play. Installing that got the game to work for me, just crappy text that needs fixing now..."
,gabester666,2011-09-08T11:23Z,"Download Reloaded, install 'Update 1', then install this torrent. Game will start up and work fine, but all the text is corrupt/garbled/messed up so you can't really change any options or play properly."
,zipsi,2011-09-08T19:02Z,"Works fine, but causes a system freeze after 5-10 minutes into game. Any ideas? All other games work 100% fine."
,Its_Morph,2011-09-08T20:30Z,I'm also getting messed up text.
,mokies,2011-09-09T01:37Z,"This is a confirmed good crack for any EXTRACTED releases.

,frostsid,2011-09-10T01:57Z,"Dude one question, the game works fine and all but with two different persons playing the second save always overwrites the first... Any idea to solve this?"
,BigBlackDicks6969,2011-09-11T03:54Z,"For those having trouble with saves not working after patch. I beat the game on patch 1.0. Then I saw the 1.2 update and installed that and it appeared the game had deleted my save. However when I patched the game back to 1.0 it worked again.

I found that the save file is in your steam userdata and there is an out folder in there with the profile and save. It looks like when we update, the game updates but it then can no longer read the save from the previous version. Not sure how to correct this.

Apparently legit steam users got their saves patched."
[V],maximersk,2011-09-11T10:49Z,"Game works ! Saves doesn't work ! DAMN, please help !"
,JamesChalpkin,2011-09-11T11:08Z,"Does anyone know how to fix the text problem? Many thanks, i need this crack, as the other one made the game skip frames... looked horrible"
