Bold decisions by three 20th-century U.S. presidents are the focus of this three-part documentary. The film examines the global effects of Lyndon Johnson backing civil rights legislation, Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" defense system and Franklin D. Roosevelt's decision to arm Britain before America joined World War II. The program includes rare footage and interviews with Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter and newsman Walter Cronkite, among others. Moragn Freeman narrates.
