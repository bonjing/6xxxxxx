Lady Antebellum have released the cover art and track listing for their 
upcoming third album, 'Own The Night,' due out September 13. The project is 
the follow-up to the band's Grammy Award-winning, multi-platinum album, 
'Need You Now.'

"We're definitely more in tune with each other musically and personally than 
ever," says band member Dave Haywood. "It's an exciting place to be. This 
album was created from the ground up -- we are writing these songs, playing 
these instruments and creating these arrangements. With 'Own The Night,' 
more than ever before, we share a real feeling of accomplishment both as a 
band and as friends."

The talented trio return with producer credits on the new project, once again 
collaborating with veteran producer Paul Worley. Band members Charles 
Kelley, Dave Haywood and Hillary Scott wrote or co-wrote 10 of the album's 
12 tracks.

"Our only hope and expectation for this record is that it will build on the first 
two," Charles admits. "At the end of the day, we just want our fans to be 
able to say that we continue to give them solid albums with solid songs they 
can enjoy from start to finish."

The album's first single 'Just a Kiss' is the band's fast-rising single to date, 
currently sitting at No. 6 on Billboard's Country Songs chart.
