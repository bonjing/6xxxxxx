This torrent contains behind the scenes footage of Pink Floyd's Pulse tour, as seen on the 1994 Pulse tour dvd set.  I have ripped this extra out of the DVD and into mpeg2 format, in lossless quality and small file size.  This is my favorite extra in either of the DVDs, as it shows you what it was like working as the crew for Pink Floyd back in 1994.  If you enjoy this torrent, please seed it until there are a good amount of seeders sharing it.  
Enjoy!
