,d3ntzmanz,2011-09-08T07:40Z,"After easing viewers in with a fairly explicit opening and more nudity than you can shake a stick-like penis at the violence appears with a sudden brutality. From that point forward the two women are on the run through an unforgiving urban landscape where friends can be just as indifferent or dangerous as the bad guys and their only hope may be in the kindness of strangers.

Bianca is probably best known from her frequently nude role on Spartacus: Blood & Sand, Holly is a professional, goal-oriented woman uninterested in distractions, but when Shay enters her life and ends up in danger she takes on an instinctive motherly role of sorts. Bianca shows that fractured exterior well in addition to showing everything else. Lawrenceâ€™s performance is more fear based, but she convinces with a performance that mixes innocence with hesitant determination.

X is as far from the world of Pretty Woman as you can get before looping back and circling around again for good measure. Itâ€™s a world populated with hookers, assholes, drug addicts, and hypnotists, where lives are as disposable as condoms used up and thrown away. Sexy and bleak arenâ€™t necessarily an enticing cocktail, but Hewittâ€™s film manages to be a thriller that excites and depresses in equal measure. The ending offers a glimpse of the fairy tale denouement without commitment, but after this particular night from hell that may just be the happiest ending possible.

The good: Sexy, violent, dark, and raw; two strong lead performances; fantastic last line"
