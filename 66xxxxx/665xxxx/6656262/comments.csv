,youngjh999,2011-09-11T17:56Z,"I downloaded this movie, two days later I got an email about copyright infringement from my internet provider. Be cautious when downloading this. "
,snoobler,2011-09-11T21:22Z,"@youngjh999:  That letter had nothing to do with this movie.  It had everything to do with your behavior of sharing a copyrighted work.  If you're not using peerblock, get it."
,otksRED,2011-09-13T08:18Z,"@rustyrambo of course it doesnt look like blu ray you moron. its not hi def, its simmered down to dvd size, its gonna be better then a dvd rip. stupid fucking retard. go learn something. people like you dont deserve to live. you need to go contract hiv and move to the middle of africa, and beat on drums and hunt with sharp sticks and stones, with the apes."

And you are the reason why we bomb nations and take them over. I would watch you words, we have the FBI, CIA and other Security Defenses watching poor worded individuals like yourself! Welcome to the Patriot Act! You fail! "
,PeaTearGryphon,2011-10-13T03:41Z,"Despite the dumbfuck spouting anti-American bullshit that he obviously has no basis for, you KNOW a supposed-comedy's gone wrong when the comments section is funnier than the movie itself...

Seriously? After Julian Assange and the founders of the pirate bay you actually still believe that Sweden doesn't kiss american military and media arse like the rest of the EU? Give me a break, Swedish authorities sell out just as fast and cheap as those in the US proper."

,NinaColada69,2011-12-23T08:17Z,loves it
,YellowBeard89,2011-12-23T20:52Z,DON'T USE PEER GUARDIAN 2 - get PEER BLOCK - they actually update it - they took PG2 and have been continuing development...
,tbrnouche,2012-01-15T18:16Z,"I installed PeerBlock specifically because of the comments in this thread, and went ahead and downloaded Bridesmaids a few days ago. Well imagine my surprise when last night our internet shut off and I received a notice that NBC Universal had flagged me for pirating Bridesmaids. Obviously PeerBlock didn't do crap for me. Any other precautions I could take in the future (besides not downloading, for all the smart asses out there)?"
