An Ernest Hemingway look-alike is discovered adrift under a glass bottom boat with a bullet hole in his head during a "Hemingway Days" booze cruise. Turns out, the victim might have gotten caught in the middle of a family feud between bootleggers. Meanwhile, an old romance from Callie's past reappears and drops a bombshell, one that could seriously affect her relationship with Jim, the FDLE, and the hospital.
