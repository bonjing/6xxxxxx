This is a great movie. Andrew McCarthy is a doll-house furniture designer who hasn't been having good luck with women lately. He finds an incredibly hot-looking woman in a bar and decides to fly her to paradise for Christmas. The next morning the woman, Kelly Preston, wakes up and doesn't remember anything due to being drunk. I don't want to spoil the movie but unexpected things happen and love blossoms in Only You. Andrew McCarthy is incredible, and Kelly Preston is superb. see it today.
