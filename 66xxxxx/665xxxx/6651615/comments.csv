,MonkeyDudeSubtitleMaster,2011-09-06T15:11Z,"Hi MeRaDil Man

Do you have all Linkin Park music videos ...? I have 22 all before New Divide, the quality isn't anywhere as good as yours but most are of DVDRip viewing with no logos. Would you like us to upload them for you ?

Also always love your work, have been enjoying all your uploads that I like for years :)

Are you able to upload more AUSTRALIAN ARTISTS music videos as well, as they're so difficult to find, cause that would be greatly appreciated if you could :)

Some include:
Guy Sebastian Featuring Eve - Who's That Girl
Zoe Badwi - Freefallin'
Jessica Mauboy Featuring Jay Sean - What Happened To Us
Tammin - It's A Beautiful Thing
S2S (Sister2Sister) - Too Many Times

... And any more Australian artists that you come across would all be very helpful and much appreciated :)

Awesome as always, keep up the good/great work :)

Thanks

,MonkeyDudeSubtitleMaster,2011-09-06T19:26Z,"For alirezanoori:

Hi I've got all 4 of Holly Valance's videos that she released, I'll upload them for you. Although the quality isn't as good as JB59/MRD's qualities so if you like MRD feel free to re-up them in better quality ...

Thanks as always.

,alirezanoori,2011-09-06T23:49Z,"@MonkeyDudeSubtitleMaster: Thanks. I've got them too but their quality is not good enough. They're DVDRip. Just like you said, not near the MeRaDil's rips quality."
