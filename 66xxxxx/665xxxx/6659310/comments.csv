,ZenRhino,2011-09-09T18:13Z,"The WWF events frequently were held at the Boston Garden back then... this event isn't a PPV, and I think it falls between Wrestlemania III and Survivor Series 1987. Couldn't find the exact fight card, but google ""wwf boston garden"" and 1987 and you get some results on video."
