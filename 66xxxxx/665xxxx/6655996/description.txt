From the very first notes, with their tolling bells, Casellaâ€™s Symphony No. 2 is deeply indebted to its model, Mahlerâ€™s own Symphony No. 2, whose Parisian premiÃ¨re was championed by Casella during his years in the French capital. A notte alta (â€˜In deepest nightâ€™), which Casella described as â€˜the only piece of programme music I have ever composedâ€¦inspired by emotional events in my personal lifeâ€™ (Casellaâ€™s love for his Parisian student Yvonne MÃ¼ller), is a work of intimate self-revelation and sombre meditation on â€˜the utter indifference of Nature to human passionsâ€™.
