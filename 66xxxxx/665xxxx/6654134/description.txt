Jurch's "Clinical Massage" is designed to outline the principles and foundational understanding of assessing and treating orthopedic injury or dysfunction through massage therapy. The text follows an anatomic region approach, covering surface anatomy and muscle groups before presenting a comprehensive review of the most often presenting orthopedic dysfunctions or conditions. Each dysfunction or condition is reviewed with a consistent diagnostic checklist, a stepped treatment program, and relevant "clinical pearls". The learning aids throughout the text, along with the reader-friendly writing style, create a highly-effective learning system for understanding the concepts of clinical massage.
