Angry Birds Seasons: Moon Festival!

It's September and the moon is full and high as the Angry Birds head to China for the mooncake festival! The 3000-year-old harvest festival is one of the most important Chinese holidays, and the pigs think they can hide themselves in the midst of all the celebrations. Help the Angry Birds as they chase the pigs through 30 brand new levels filled with pagodas, rabbits, and red lanterns, lit by a dazzling harvest moon.

In addition, the Mighty Eagle is now available for Seasons! This in-app purchase lets you use the Mighty Eagle to destroy difficult levels and collect special achievements.
