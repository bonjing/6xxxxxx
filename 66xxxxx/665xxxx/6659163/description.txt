About VortexBox
VortexBox is a free, open source (GPL v3), quick-install ISO that turns your unused computer into an easy-to-use music server/jukebox. Once VortexBox has been loaded on an unused PC, it will automatically rip CDs to FLAC and MP3 files, ID3 tag the files , and download the cover art. Vortexbox will then serve the files to network  media players such as Logitech Squeezebox, Sonos, or Linn. The music files can also be streamed to a Windows or Mac OSX system.

07 Sep 11 VortexBox 1.10 released
It is been a while since we released a new version of VortexBox and there are a lot of small fixes and tweaks in this new version. There is the usually updates such as a new Kernel and SqueezeBox server 7.6.1. There are also a lot of small updates such as increased UPnP player support. VortexBox now supports the latest Samsung TVs and the BeoSound 5 from Bang and Olufsen.
We added a lot of user requested features such as a one click restore button in the USB backup manager. We also added faster mp3 mirroring at the request of VortexBox users. This version has been tested with new products from Sonos and Logitech including the new Play:3 to ensure these devices are fully supported.
VortexBox 1.10 supports the new VortexBox Orbiter, a fanless player that automatically finds your VortexBox.
