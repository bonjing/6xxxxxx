In more than a decade since the publication of the first edition of Comprehensive Toxicology, an explosive increase in the knowledge of the effects of chemical and physical agents on biological systems has led to an increased understanding of normal cellular functions and the consequences of their perturbations. Revised and updated to reflect new advances in toxicology research and including content by some of the leading researchers in the field, the 14-volume second edition of Comprehensive Toxicology remains the premier resource for toxicologists in academia, medicine, and corporations. Rather than giving an alphabetical listing of compounds, Comprehensive Toxicology second edition provides a unique organ-systems structure that allows the user to explore the toxic effects of various substances on each human system, aiding in providing diagnoses and proving essential in situations where the toxic substance is unknown but its effects on a system are obvious. Comprehensive Toxicology second edition is the most complete and valuable toxicology work available to researchers today.
