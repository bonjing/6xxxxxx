Does the ""steaming"" function in Utorrent work well while downloading? I can't seem to get it to work, but I'm curious if anyone else has tried it."

,OrpheusDude,2011-09-05T07:13Z,"xxan: what did you download, and from where?  This is an .avi file.  Your comment has no place here.  eztv is among the most reliable sources on TPB.  Be gone with you!"
,NekMinute,2011-09-05T07:30Z,"comes as a RAR, once extracted asks for a password. to get the password it leads you to some fucking online servey's.

Dont download, unless someone can prove me wrong."
,kevmeyer84,2011-09-05T07:36Z,"xxan has the right comment just for the wrong torrent, there is one on here that is pass protected, just not this one"

,filippom,2011-09-05T22:44Z,The sound is NOT in sync. Bad!
,agbronco,2011-09-05T23:46Z,thanks yo
,spam0000,2011-09-06T01:01Z,"eztv, thanks a lot for your ups!
One thing though - the audio on this season is very hard compressed and/or ""expanded"", possibly this is a setting in the ripping software you use to enhance the audio. It could also be called something like ""maximizer"". It flattens out the dynamics of the audio track, making the background sounds a lot louder than they should be. Maybe you'd like to check it out and have a listen.

Again thanks so much for the super quality, and hope that was helpful."
[T],jack.ss,2011-09-06T05:11Z,"@spam0000
It is a scene group called TLA that made this release and not eztv. The site called eztv only distribute other groups releases on eztv and TPB."
,Roar_,2011-09-06T14:50Z,"Thanks, perfect as always!"
,musclemd,2011-09-06T16:27Z,Reliable- amazing download speeds!! Thanks eztv
,thongo,2011-09-06T22:11Z,"I almost never comment, but this release has extremely shitty sound."
,gjendem,2011-09-06T22:21Z,"YES, great DL speed, ok quality etc.

BUT IT'S FUCKING WRONG EPISODE! THIS IS AN OLD ONE."
,thongo,2011-09-06T23:04Z,"@gjendem It's not an old episode. Just watch a little longer than 3 minutes into it, will you."
,y3n007,2011-09-07T03:52Z,"so is this a rar file? and if it is does it work, too many post about files being corrupt.....maybe they do not know how to unrar files...."
,y3n007,2011-09-07T03:57Z,"Kept reading the comments, I guess no rar here or password....I should have not even doubt this torrent, after all it was posted by eztv who is a bad ass when it comes to posting torrents...."
,zhoenix,2011-09-07T08:01Z,"I appreciate your efforts in supplying us with these episodes..  The quality is outstanding..

I have one issue though, Breaking Bad always at the end of each episode shows a teaser for the next episode, which you do not include.

This show gets you on the edge of your seat at the end of every episode, and the teaser helps answer some questions each time.

I would love for that to be an addition to your future releases.  Thank you for your consideration."
,clashingpersonality,2011-09-07T08:38Z,eztv ! this guy is solid.  no bullcrap here
,DontPissMeOff,2011-09-07T12:15Z,For everyone thinking this is an old episode - it's not - only first scenes are repeated - watch further. 
,empm9,2011-09-07T18:28Z,thank you
,0rounder0,2011-09-07T22:05Z,** This is an OLD EPISODE! from last season **

,jim380,2011-09-09T06:35Z,Thank You !!
,zhoenix,2011-09-10T03:57Z,"__THIS IS NOT AN OLD EPISODE__

--The opening recaps previous episodes, from previous seasons--

QUIT POSTING ""THIS IS AN OLD EPISODE"" BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT."
,targong,2011-09-11T09:41Z,Thanks eztv - just got 1 -8 and hanging out for the rest. Always awesome quality and fast speeds.

,rolleface,2011-09-12T07:53Z,"obvious mac user is obvious.

no wonder you're retarded."
,Mashmodo,2011-09-15T22:20Z,This is not a rar... We can click the files list you retards.
,saltriver,2011-09-21T04:39Z,thanks eztv
,Faboba_,2011-09-21T04:42Z,"I wonder if all the people saying 'It's an OLD EPISODE!' were equally puzzled by The Two Towers; as with that film the start of the episode repeats a sequence from a previous episode and then continues the story from the perspective of another character. Thus begins the best episode of Breaking Bad to date.

""Is Gustavo Fring your real name?"""
,cyberzed,2011-10-28T12:51Z,"Thanks for your uploads. Very happy with the quality of all the eztv episodes, although for some reason I had an audio synch problem this one and episode 9 when using ConvertXtoDVD. If anyone else has this problem, you need to set the source file audio for these episodes to -6000ms."
