V:9 or 10.

the subtitles are hardcoded Swedish, audio is very low, and for that reason, the british accent throughout the movie makes it more difficult to understand what the actors are saying. i tried the headphones too, but no improvement. i actually downloaded it all and deleted it after 10 mins coz of audio issues."
