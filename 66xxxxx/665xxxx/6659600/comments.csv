,XxM24Ty,2011-09-08T17:18Z,Thanks for the feedback unitarity. I honestly did not realize the two were different. ; guess I learned something. ;) Nevertheless I do feel that this version sounds better for some reason. -Thanks for the clarification.  :D
,unitarity,2011-09-08T20:06Z,"Remasters almost always sound better than the original.  The people at DCC Gold are very good at it.

This is a great upload.  Thank you.
