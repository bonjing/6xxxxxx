â€”Steve and Lynn Clark are one such couple.

Married with a 5â€“yearâ€“old child, they are successful and happy. On the surface.

But their relationship is beginning to stagnate and their confidence in their life together â€“ and each other â€“ is starting to crumble.

Until, that is, an unsolicited text message asks a searching question.Itâ€²s the first of a series of texts that cause them to question their behaviour and values â€“ and devise a series of remedies to their growing problems.

Together, Steve and Lynn create and explore 15 ways to build confidence. Simple principles that anyone can apply to their own lives with similar results.
