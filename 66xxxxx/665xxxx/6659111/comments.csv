@Mrdensson is f1 2011 out yet?"
,hootieman,2011-09-08T01:30Z,"love it thanks! my question is, why did tiger woods stop releasing their games to the PC until 2012? They skipped quite a few years. Oh and NBA2K12 comes out Oct 4th or 5th can't remember which so we still have a wait on our hands "
,TyMod,2011-09-08T02:46Z,"You fucking RULE!!! I have a friend who loves to golf and he loves PC gaming. Thought I would download this for him and give it a try myself.

Thanks man, keep kicking ass,

,dumas1000,2011-09-08T02:46Z,EA has stopped (mostly) producing their sports titles for the PC. They did so starting around 2008. I'm shocked that this game was even ported to the PC.
,dumas1000,2011-09-08T02:51Z,"F1 has a release date of somewhere around September 21. I mostly love Codemasters racing titles and I sorta collect Games for Windows Live games, but I could not play that year's F1 game worth crap. One of the few games Windows Live games I've ever deleted. Seems if you are not a total gearhead or a hardcore sim racing enthusiast, that game is going to kick your ass. Even on ""easy"" mode, which wasn't easy at all."
,houseofswing,2011-09-08T02:51Z,"the reason they started making this again is because of the success of the tiger woods online free to play game, which does tie into this game if you were to buy this. hell i was playing free online till i heard this was coming out now thx to TPB i dont have to anymore 

thx extremezone"
,TyMod,2011-09-08T03:10Z,"Also I am getting about 130kbps which is pretty good since there is only 13 seeders at this point.

Also yes, EA like completly quit making PC sports titles which is stupid.  Especially since with Madden 08 they sent a message out notifying people the servers will be closed down to make room for Madden 09 and that we needed to buy the game.  And then BAM, never ported it.  Ass wholes.... Oh well, atleast they gave us golf..."
,knox666,2011-09-08T05:08Z,Me have sad face see......    :(....no windows controller support. I play on 52 sharp see why i'm sad faced now? :/
,knox666,2011-09-08T05:15Z,Word to the not so wise :/.....If you decide to update or make any changes now and/or later copy and paste your save file to your desktop then move it back into your save folder which is the out folder with save and profile. And if it does not show as a continue in the play menu. Remove the number of the save file and replace it with the number 0 with the rename funtion. Ok? ok now bye bye. :)
,knox666,2011-09-08T05:17Z,disregard last comment wrong torrent :/ my bad.
,ben_high,2011-09-08T05:38Z,Can anyone comment on how this game plays with mouse/keyboard? 
,houseofswing,2011-09-08T08:45Z,wow this is the same exact game as tiger woods free to play online with just a campaign mode what a joke i feel srry for dudes that pay for this...if you wanna know how it plays with a mouse sign up for free to play and try it out

first of all... thanks alot for all the great uploads! appreciated :)

Thanks! "
,tribal86,2011-09-08T17:39Z,"i try game... it works.. :)
unzip data... copy crack :) work like charm...

just hope for some new way to crack so we can get exp and other stuff :)
(maybe something like ubisoft game luncher crack)"
,bd201020,2011-09-08T17:57Z,Installing by unzipping the Data.zip only installs the basics. No commentary etc is installed using this method. There is a 1.79Gig file that presumably contains commentary and more that is not installed making the game semi installed.
,hurka79,2011-09-08T18:17Z,Thanks from Hungary!
,tribal86,2011-09-08T18:18Z,"ok... bd201020

,vrocks94,2011-09-08T19:33Z,holy son of bitches......the game just works fine.........extremezone rocks!!!!!!!!
,bd201020,2011-09-08T19:37Z,@tribal86.. Yeah I'm not sure really. The 1.7 gig file that is not installed when you only unzip the Data.zip is probably Commentary and perhaps the new caddie thing. Unzipped the missing file is actually 3gig which is the same size as the Data.zip game folder so It probably holds a lot of stuff.
,Flanker-B,2011-09-08T22:34Z,"@dumas1000
This game is actually not a port form any of the console versions. The pc version is based on the free Tiger Woods PGA tour Online."

,jvezirian,2011-09-10T04:31Z,"Hey Extreme....

Followed the instruction like you said, just created a folder Tiger Woods 2012 and extracted the Data file there, copied the crack folder there (always do that to keep a backup copy) and then copied the contents into the game and launched using shortcut to the cracked .exe.

Works great!!!!!

What about ""Tiger Woods PGA TOUR(R) 12 The Masters.pkg"" file, what gets done with this, do we install this file?

Can the file be installed or was it extracted with the data file.

Game works and plays great, but there are no choices for the player other than a few faces, and the shitty red shirt..lol

Anyone else follow the unzip method, but have been able to get additional content, or do you have to go online using the game face program, which I cannot access since I block this program from web access."

@hurka79, just extract the data.zip like it says in the description and you're good to go. That's what I did anyway. I tried to install first and seen the Origin thing. Decided not to go that route is possible ;)

Thanks again EZ!! You guys are great!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

@ extremezone...a little help would be nice since no one else is bothering...

I know the instructions said to do the unzip thing, but from what I've read, going that route only gives a shaved down version of the game. I don't care about getting online, but I don't want 45% of the actual game either.

So the question is, IS THERE A KEYGEN?? Because it's asking us for a product key to install the game...

Is anybody gonna help with this question? Because a lot of people are having this issue...

Thanx in advance..."

Then it puts a pretty nasty fucking MBR virus on your computer as well. Impressive job by the virus writer as well, had to use a Fedora Live CD to boot and wipe the MBR (since Bootrec /FixMbr didn't work like the old fdisk /mbr).

FYI if you need to do this:

fdisk -l ( that's an L ) as su (sudo)

dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/[your drive here] bs=512 count=63

For example (for my primary drive)
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=63

to wipe the whole mbr (you can then boot off Vista/Win 7 and run your boot record fixings).
