Storyline: A group of young film studies students from the University of Pittsburgh are in the woods making their own horror film along with their faculty advisor, Andrew Maxwell, when they hear on the radio the news of apparent mass-rioting and mass murder. Soon, these reports include cannibalism and the fact that the recently deceased are inexplicably waking and walking. Two of the students, Ridley and Francine, decide to leave the group, while project director Jason, who wants to film the events documentary-style, heads to the dormitory of his girlfriend Debra Moynahan. When she cannot contact her family, they travel in a RV to the house of Debra's parents in Scranton, Pennsylvania.
