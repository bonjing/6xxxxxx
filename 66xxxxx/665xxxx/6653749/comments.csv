If so, I am sure everyone would appreciate if anyone could share links to english subtitles for alien parts ONLY."

""SUBTiTLES.......: N/A""

NA means not applicable or not available. No subtitles for these three films. It's possible to download the subtitles from another website and use MKVMerge to add them to the file."
,rcr29budcar,2011-09-06T03:54Z,Is this the real blu ray copies with the cgi Yoda or is it HDTV copies?
,moss8813,2011-09-06T05:33Z,"yeah nameuser123 i know subtitles aren't included. hard-coded subs for non-english parts only are rarely noted in the info.

Their probably not on there for the non-english parts just like 720p

And yes i know can download the subs..which is what i want to do..i was asking if anyone had them to provide a link with where they got the english subs for this trilogy for non-english parts only like i provided the 720p star wars OT posted here on the bay. "
,thegreatgabbo,2011-09-06T05:42Z,is liam neeson in episode III?
,nameuser123,2011-09-06T16:28Z,"""is liam neeson in episode III?""

His character, Qui-Gon Jinn, was killed in Episode 1. Perhaps George Lucas added a CGI ghost of Qui into episode three along with the deleted Jar Jar Binks 'naked in shower' scene.

:P

,BruceWayneJr,2011-09-06T16:40Z,"thegreatgabbo, As far as I know, the Qui-Gon/Yoda force communion scene is included as a deleted scene, and not dipped into the actual movie. 

The question remains: Does this set include the bonus/deleted scenes?"
,DragonF.C.Porto,2011-09-06T23:05Z,thanks
,rcr29budcar,2011-09-07T02:49Z,Does anyone know if the deleted scenes for the whole bluray saga will be uploaded soon or not?
,thegreatgabbo,2011-09-07T03:54Z,thanks

,MadPandora,2011-09-10T00:41Z,"If this from blu ray release,I think many blu ray's fans going to be mad for sure because picture were not sharp and pop out as blu ray should be,don't you think so.
I watch sample of each episode,only episode 4 and 6 seem to be good other than that they are not far from standard DVD especially racing scene on episode 1"
