Sensational Salads. Reports Cindy F. of Seward, Nebraska, "I add a bit of chicken bouillon granules and horseradish to my dressing for macaroni salad. This is
one flavorful dish." To give tuna macaroni salad zip, Pam H. of Cooperstown, New York, pours on a splash of Italian dressing.

"Tuna salad becomes lively with a couple tablespoons of salsa," comments Liana R. of Oceanside, California. "The salsa complements the flavor of the tuna." To perk up her coleslaw, Nellie S. of Royal City, Washington, includes chopped celery, green pepper, apple, banana, pineapple, and black walnuts.

Best Burgers and Meat Loaf. "We like the flavor of bacon in burgers and meat loaf," explains Charlene F. of Coaldale, Alberta. "To save time, I mix packaged bacon bits into the meat before grilling or baking." Heavenly Hash. "When making hash from leftover roast and potatoes, I sprinkle on a teaspoon or two of vinegar 5
minutes before the end of cooking," remarks June W. of Leesburg, Florida. "It sparks the flavor."

Super Sandwiches. Cold meat sandwiches get crunch at the South Bend, Indiana, home of Eugenia C. with thinly sliced radishes. "It's a fun alternative to onion slices," she says.

Better Baked Beans. "To any canned baked beans, stir in about 1/4 cup barbecue sauce, 1/4 teaspoon each garlic powder and pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon dried basil,"
suggests Michelle A. of Knoxville, Ohio. "My husband won't eat them any other way."

From New Berlin, Pennsylvania, Karen K. relates, "My niece recommended adding a dash of cinnamon and ginger to my favorite baked beans. They get a new zing, and
everyone wonders what my secret ingredient is."
