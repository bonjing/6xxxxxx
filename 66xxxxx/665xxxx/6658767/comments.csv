,maggot_corpse,2011-09-07T20:43Z,Viggo is great in LOTR and The Road. All of his other characters are annoying.

Big thanks, DownTYU! The German BD only has the original Spanish and German subtitles, so thanks a ton for mixing in English subs!"
,kpyi,2011-09-14T05:15Z,"I downloaded the movie, but there are no english subtites...the enclosed ""info"" file is a undf file what can not be played by vlc nor any of the windows media players...
Any advice?"
