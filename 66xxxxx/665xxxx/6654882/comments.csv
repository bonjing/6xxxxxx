,TheBigDB,2011-09-09T10:43Z,"I can't seem to run/install the game...I double click the a147-win.exe, and the folder stops responding...after trying it 5 times I decided to just delete it, I'm pretty sure my computer can play this and idk what I'm doing wrong"
,koja90,2011-09-10T16:46Z,"If someone does not know how to ""seed"" answer to you is: when the torrent finishes downloading, leave on utorrent, bittorrent , and where written before downloading, now will write ""Seeding"".  Whenever it is turned on utorrent, bittorrent - then you will help  others to download that torrent! which is called ""Seeding"" !"
,koja90,2011-09-10T17:44Z,"I do not know what to tell you ""TheBigDB"" ! I deleted it and re-installed The Game. And it works perfectly like the first time! Surely you have a virus in the system, or you missing a system component. I would recommend you to reinstaliras system. or to somehow recover the component. I hope I was helpful!"
