,Zeptinune,2011-10-06T18:49Z,"Most amazing rip ever. I also downloaded a 6.3GB rip of this but it has HARD Swedish subs.. not a problem because my wife and I are Finnish and we can both understand Swedish but I found that this torrent was MUCH! better.

Thanks for the addition of Finnish subs mate. We ended up watching this version and only 10 minutes of the other one.

Downloaded at 4.03MB/s the whole time. Took 27 minutes. Thanks to the seeders!

I'll show my love and seed for a month!

Greetz!"

Thank you for this excellent quality .mkv AND the enclosure of all of the subtitles for various languages, including English. I have hearing problems and don't want to watch anything without subtitles!

I used this as the source to make an AVCHD disc with switchable subtitles (using mkv2vob) and the audio and video are still crisp and clear after transcoding."
