,Nickyboy7,2011-09-08T17:13Z,"Thanks for this, Ghost Adventures is back on the 23rd September, first episode is ""Ashmore Estates""

Counting on you to upload the new series :) you always deliver when it comes to Ghost Adventures, just want to thank you for all your previous GA uploads, helped me complete my collection."
[T],trialNerror,2011-09-08T23:45Z,"You're Welcome Nick.

Just so you all know, the upcoming episode of Ghost Adventures is the premiere of Season 5.  Anything released in the past as S05E0X is completely mislabeled. 

Coming Soon: COMPLETE GHOST ADVENTURES 720p Seasons 1 thru 4 (except the LIVE Halloween Event is standard XviD) plus The Beginning Documentary 720p as well."
,ToneZone,2011-09-09T03:32Z,Very cool tNe.  I'm looking to get all GA episodes in 720 especially the beginning one from 2004.
