,ankit46,2011-09-05T17:05Z,"I thought that your upload help those people who have slow internet connection,then why you increase the size of your movie

plz plz plz plzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
just keep your size in between 400 to 550mb"
,neodick,2011-09-05T17:30Z,@ankit46: Not all surprizes come in small packages. Quality matters.
,xBSAACHRIS434x,2011-09-05T17:50Z,"Thanks for the up YIFY!!!
@ankit46 shut the fuck up!! there's a fine line between quality and file size. This is still smaller than an average DVDRip and its Bluray quality. If you want smaller file size maybe you should rip a few movies yourself and see how hard it is to get good quality at 350 mb. haha."
,xBSAACHRIS434x,2011-09-05T17:56Z,"Im sorry 450 - 500 mb what a joke! YIFY has done it before and I'm not saying its not possible, I'm saying 650 to 850 mb gives much better quality because of frame rate etc. I think it's time you upgrade from dial up and be more appreciative."
,ankit46,2011-09-05T19:11Z,"@xBSAACHRIS434x
IF you want to see a movie on big lcd screen then for improving quality your movie size also increases but if you see a movie in 15'6 laptop screen then i am 100% , movie size between 400 to 550MB is enough 

I dont have fast internet connection thats why i am requesting but if you have fast internet connection and you also want good quality then download 4gb blueray print"
