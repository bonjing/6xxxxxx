,Oot-Glit,2011-09-08T12:13Z,"Annoying pops, static, even DTMF tones infest this amateurish effort. Probably processed on a crappy Windoze machine while the ""grider"" watched porn flicks. Windoze can hardly do 1 thing at a time correctly, let alone multitask. WTF, over?"
,grider,2011-09-08T17:21Z,"I had some time this morning and found a better stream.  

Complainers,  

Instead of bitching, how about not being a net zero to society and upload something?"
,Lissar,2011-09-08T23:19Z,"Thank you grider, for all your efforts. Even despite the additional popping noise and other sounds, I am just glad to have access to hearing Rush in my afternoons. I am grateful, as others no doubt are too, so thank you again. "
