  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The player is drawn into the world of Dead Island on the brink of a 
  mysterious epidemic that suddenly, and without warning, breaks out on 
  the fictional island of Banoi. As a guest of the Royal Palms Resort, 
  the player\'s stay was supposed to be a dream holiday; a luxurious 
  getaway to the beautiful beaches of a tropical paradise. But faced 
  with the reality of a zombie apocalypse, there is only one thing 
  left to do: Survive.

  This is Dead Island... a paradise to die for.
 


  Notes:
  ~~~~~~~

  For some odd reason it seems not all copies of this game have XGD3 depending
  on where you buy it... That\'s why our first rip was for JTAGs only.
  Here\'s one from another source as a traditional .iso release which
  can be burnt and played as usual .. enjoy
