Side Notes:
-----------
All of these have been tested in Windows XP, working valid portable versions, precracked, no cd's or serials required. Custom menu laucher for it was coded by me and adds a nice touch to my first real AIO on torrents.No confusing ISO's, DAA's etc "Hey what the heck is a MDF?", took out all of the nooby torrenter problems that don't know how to mount or burn cds from images. I've tried getting the portable versions of both Pro Bass Fishing 2003 and Trophy Hunter 2003, only the Trophy Hunter proved to work and it was crippled. Individually as a torrent, they aren't seeded very well. So I am teaming up with my business partner Zero Degreez to help power seed this as well as we can. I'm personally setting up 3 seeds here, hes got like another 6-7 at his place to help seed as well. So I don't wanna hear any complaining that it ain't being seeded, plz seed, seed! etc comments will just get you flamed. I put a buttload of work to make this work nicely and cleanly as well. It's virus free, I've personally built the launcher/front end of this thing. And I stand by my torrents as well. Help seed for others cuz man i really want my Pirate Bay skull.
