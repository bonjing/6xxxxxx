,Stozzy,2011-09-11T04:28Z,"mkv plays fine on ps3 if you know what you're doin. i've gotten all formats goin on wii, all ""popular"" on the ps3, and 'some' on 360 (windows based son of a)

thanks for the up man. keep rockin the avi's so i have less headache on the xbox."
,analu,2011-09-12T02:02Z,"Thanks FXG! You rock my world! 

^__^\m/ Keep it rockin!

As for the sub themes:


1. Please, FXG guys: Don't listen to those mkv lovers!
I agree mkv is great, but it's way too soon for that. I watch films not only on my pc, but on other players with TVs, which happen to play every single fckn file EXCEPT MKV, one of which I can even update codecs, but not yet to play mkv. And there are many ppl who think the same way.

AVI is still the best and most reliable format, so, thanks for using it and keep doing so, please!

2. I don't think FXG is aXXo, 'cos the last year aXXo was active (until early 2009), I was always comparing their files and they were waaaay different - the only really similar aspects were small avi files and TOP quality. p.s.: I loved aXXo too...

3. @this_is_deep 
''I am an FXG loyalist...''
WOW! I'm thinking of printing that line on a shirt, if you don't mind... :p Or... maybe not - maybe it's a bit too ''in your face'', like a shirt I saw a while back, saying: ''I'm a Hacker - arrest me, pls!'' XD"
,shadowskilled,2011-09-12T08:46Z,"You guys are the best rippers around. Not to sound too ungrateful but I wish you'd dedicate more time to stay up to date. Thanks for the work, you guys rock."
,Erich505,2011-09-13T00:13Z,WATCH OUT! this copy could crash your VLC media player.
,ViolentC,2011-09-13T06:10Z,"Hi FXG could I make a request? I am after a 2011 Documentry called ""The Weird World of Blowfly"" ... It's about Clarence Reid and his Alter Ego BLOWFLY . "
,gdogfolife,2011-09-15T20:41Z,Ya mkv is cool and all but I cant play it off my xbox so thats why im sticking with avi for the time being. I hope cars 2 and kung fu panda 2 come out soon.
,MuserClair,2011-09-16T11:09Z,"thnks for the ul - will take the risk with the pixellation cos other rips out there are double the size with comments about voices only on the right channel instead of in stereo.. ..think i'd find that more annoying than a lil pixellation

cheers for the ul!"
,redactedwv,2011-09-18T05:36Z,"@ ViolentC: There are rips out there...try hunting The Weird World Of Blowfly - PDVDRip - XviD - 1CDRip - [DDR] or """" 2011 R5 LiNE XViD - IMAGiNE. Might try hitting iso thru a proxy."

,michaelrwatson,2011-12-24T04:42Z,"WHOOPS, i wrote that too soon. FXG: You suck wanker (and you've got nothing on aXXo). This release is missing the *entire* endtitles. 

The negligible quality increase gained by not encoding endtitles isn't worth it. Endtitles have the cast and most people want them. 

So here's an idea: encode the movie at higher bitrate, then encode the endtitles at half that (for a total of "
,phat_71,2011-12-30T04:12Z,"Seriously? Who gives a rats ass about the endtitles anyway? I'd be thrilled if everything I DLed ended right when the credits began, not only would I be able to get things faster, it would take less time to burn them to DVD. If you want to see the entire movie in it's complete form, go pay 25$ for it at Walmart like a douchebag."
