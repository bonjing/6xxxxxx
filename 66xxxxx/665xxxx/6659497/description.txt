Route 666 complete from Crossgen.  Crossgen's original horror series, written by Tony Bedard, follows Cassie as she attempts to deal with a conspiracy involving dark spirits.

All thanks to the original scanners and uploaders
If you have any Crossgen requests that you want ULed this week post a comment.  I'm leaning towards either Ruse or Mystic but I can put others online.
