,Chadly,2011-09-06T05:35Z,"Im Guessing VOD means Video on Demand, but im probably way wrong lol :)  Thanks Bone"
,QborT,2011-09-06T06:49Z,"Chadly, you are correct.  VOD is Video On Demand.

And extremezone is right, this is out of sync.  SiC released a V2."
,JohnnyRayRay,2011-09-06T11:10Z,"You can fix the out of sync problem in vlc easy. My vlc is in swedish but it should be something like ""language syncronizing"" under tools."

,LukeScooto,2011-09-08T03:33Z,"I think extreme was just trying to help Bone become a better upper by just giving a tip about whats wrong with the movie, i dont think he was whining or slamming bone, it was the opposite. I think hes just trying to make the place have better quality movies."
,ashen77,2011-09-08T21:58Z,"the above comment is obvious to any one with more than 3 brain cells to rub together.

Never mind RedBusterd, with time and effort you WILL be able to tie your own show laces one day."
,ashen77,2011-09-08T21:58Z,and your shoe laces too!
,akhifx12,2011-10-09T10:38Z,Nice movie.
