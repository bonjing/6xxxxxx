The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This thirty-third alphabetical installment is: DC from My-New

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.

=================================


Sorry for those of you who like my random thoughts. I've made various excuses, but the real reason I've not been doing much in that area is my bipolar cycle is on the down side. I not only find i t difficult to care or get any fun out of doing that (or anything) when I'm more or less depressed (technical term is anhedonia) but the synapses just aren't firing as crazily (and I use that term precisely) as when i'm on the opposite phase. Much of my creativity and free associating thought style is linked to that.  Of course nearly all of the time I find it difficult to think about only one or two things at a time, which also "helps" my writing style.


But you get COMICS!

btw about 350gb to go!

Blue Beetle appeared in these along with others. Not exactly the same same as the Blue Beetle of later years, but the modern Blue Beetle is a continuation and revision of the same character. Like many Golden age heroes he has been revised more than once.
Mystery Men 01-31 (Fox(1939-1942)

Mystery Play, The (Vertigo(1994)

I love the original Mystery in Space! DC had the second best science fiction comics in the "olden times". EC was number one before the dark times, before the code. I find that the other publishers from the 40-60s I've tried are almost always distinctly inferior. For one thing the stories always seem to end too soon, with a jarring effect. Whether it's the case or not, I get the impression the writer had an extra page or two written and the editors cut them down brutally and clumsily.
