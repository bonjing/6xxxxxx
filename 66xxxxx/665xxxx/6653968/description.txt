Driving is one of the most successful ways to induce Grumpiness with numerous 
blood-pressure-raising elements and the uncanny ability to turn any normally 
passive person into a road-raging wreck.

This brand new Grumpy Guide programme gets our Grumpys seeing red as they cover 
topics including misguiding sat navs, infuriating back seat drivers, the hell 
that is inner city gridlock and how it's not fine to get a fine.
