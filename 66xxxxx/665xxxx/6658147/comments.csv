,pete0726,2011-09-17T00:05Z,Let me know what you think about the ROM. I have been flashing I9000 on my Infuse using Hellraiser Beta6.I Have not found one stable enough to keep. I have tried Darkys ROM (JVQ) but it has its list of problems. Bionix is the most stable ROM I have found. There is a clock zip and a camera mod that I have not yet posted for Bionix.
