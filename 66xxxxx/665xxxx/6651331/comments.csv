Countless times have I downloaded a ""lion compatible"" application only to have it either not work or only work after a little tweaking; the same can be said for the early days of SL. I was merely seeing if the compatibility claim was backed up.

And I don't really understand why asking questions on the internet has become such a crime and warrants such aggression."
,SamHefron,2011-09-08T12:54Z,"@tahl112

If that comment was ""aggressive"" to you, you need to harden up a bit princess."
,tahl112,2011-09-09T14:48Z,"@SamHefron

Haha, thank you for directly illustrating my point.
I take no direct offence; I do however feel that a less cut-throat environment on the internet would actually see positive outcomes such as a stronger community to keep good torrents alive for longer.

There's no need for badly structured sentences when all we want is a strong online community.

Btw, torrent and game were fantastic. Thanks."
,khanthep,2011-09-10T15:07Z,Good

,timp74,2011-10-06T00:57Z,I found if I change the 'icon file' property in Info.plist to something other than the 'Limbo.icns' the game would start.  Unfortunately it runs too slow on my machine. :(  My graphics chip is effectively a Nvidia geforce 8400

,Ricklaus,2011-12-22T08:19Z,You Can use The ENTER RETURN as the Control button….use to Grab things….and is running really smooth here…..Mac Os X - Lion. 13' - 2011.
,derrylc,2012-01-05T05:44Z,"CAREFUL: this file contains a Trojan. Sophos advised that I delete immediately.

The game may work as advertised, but be careful that you're not installing something more malicious at the same time."
,derrylc,2012-01-05T05:45Z,"And just look at the description....

""i hate http downloads from fucking fileserves andi think you too! so have a torrent!""

I would play it safe and not download this."
