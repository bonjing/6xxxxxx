,wonderboylv,2011-09-10T01:38Z,This one stops playback around 37:00 on my comp and doubles in speed around 37:00 on my phone 
,Papaoso42,2011-09-10T14:03Z,"@ wonderboylv, Haven't had that problem yet. If you download and see that your file is not at least 38mb then I would say there was a problem downloading. Just delete and try re-downloading the torrent. Hope that works! Has anyone else had problems with the file? "
