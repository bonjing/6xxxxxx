Secondly or all those who have problems with installation just follow the instructions exactly

1. Unrar
2. Burn or mount the image
3. Install the game using our installer ( steambackub2.exe not setup exe)
4. Copy over the cracked content from the Crack   dir (all the content from crack dir even the ""OUT"" dir) on the disc to 
install dir of the game. Install the redists from the installREDIST
dir as needed
5. Play the game
6. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT

If you have problems with graphics you must put on defaults ""3d application settings"" on display driver  settings
If you want you can install Dead Island Update 1-RELOADED http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6656841/Dead_Island_Update_1-RELOADED

1. Go to Program Files (or x86 for 64bit users)

3. Mount image using Daemon Tools, or extract all contents of ISO into a folder and run steambackup2.EXE as an administrator
4. When it asks you to choose install dir, choose the folder you just created.
5. After install, copy the crack contents into the folder titled ""Dead Island"" located within the fold you created. NOT the ""DI"" folder that is inside the Dead Island folder.
6. When you play the game, make sure you play it as an administrator or else it will not allow you to save or in some cases play at all.

Also remember to download the update or else when you die you'll be spawning inside of a zombie horde!!

,shipz2640,2011-09-17T04:12Z,"@strife261 Step back and take a chill pill.

Firstly, when you install the game if you're running 64bit Windows Vista or Windows 7, it will be installed to ""C:\Program Files (x86)"" with a sub-directory for the game, typically the name of the game, so it'll probably be ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Dead Island"".

Once you've located that folder, copy the cracked content to that folder and you're done. As the NFO states, you may need to install some of the redists from the ""installREDIST"" folder within the ISO."
,shipz2640,2011-09-17T04:17Z,"@DC03 You shouldn't need to create any additional folders. You should be overwriting existing files with cracked files. That's how cracks work.

If you're refering to the redists, you still shouldn't be creating new folders. If you're creating folders yourself then you're doing something wrong. Read through the NFO and try it again."
,shipz2640,2011-09-17T04:18Z,"@diogosousa Yes, it is the same exact package, the only difference is the tracker(s) and the seeder(s). You can merge the trackers/seeders from this torrent with the other RELOADED torrent for Dead Island to speeden up your transfer rates."

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT THIS RELEASE

- Backup your save files - the folders named ""profile"" and ""save"" in the install directory - everytime you exit the game. There is a bug that occasionaly happens to me that messes up with your save files, erasing your inventory and reseting your level back to 1. So if that happens you can copy and paste your backup save to turn everything to normal.
- There is another bug that happens when you enter an instance dungeon (a house, for example) that makes the loading never end. You will hear the sound of a crash message when this occur, so press alt+tab, press enter to close the message window, go back to the game, and the map will load normally."
