
 This is a rip of the old CD game from Sierra called  "Outpost" it installs as "Outpost 1.5" though. Some people may have problems installing it on XP, but that can be fixed by turning compatability mode for the installer. I recommend the following settings:

 Run this program in compatibility mode for:  Windows 95

 Disable visual themes

 Turn off advanced services for this program

 Once you do that it should install just fine. This game does want its CD in, but an image like this can be mounted in Daemon tools during the install of the game, and during play it must have the same drive letter and it won't know the difference!

 This is an .MDX file, so you might HAVE to use Daemon tools to mount this as an image, and or burn it. Daemon tools lite can burn images to physical discs, and its free.
