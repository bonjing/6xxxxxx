,phoenixrises,2011-09-04T22:08Z,"I've been really impressed at how you are able to get some of these titles. 

Is there any chance you can source a copy of ""Luther: The Calling"" by Neil Cross? 

Also ""The Eagle of the Ninth"" by Rosemary Sutcliff.

And this will be a real challenge as I don't think it is available in eBook format but if anyone can get it ..... ""The Mayor of Castro Street: The Life and Times of Harvey Milk"" by Randy Shilts.

Any of these would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."
,Ludds,2011-09-04T23:34Z,"Thanks again for all your uploads King! Do you have anything by R.H. Blyth-specifically ""Haiku in 4 volumes""? (and thank you again for Frost Music,hadn't heard those songs in almost 30 yrs.!) "
,cur37ious,2011-09-05T00:48Z,"When I saw the earlier comment requesting Michener books, I thought ""Ruh, Roh"", that's gonna be tuff"".  You continue to amaze me, K3.  Thanks!!!

If you ever run across Lois McMaster Bujold's Foreigner series, or at least the first 8 or 9, I'd be delighted.  Own 10 in hardcover, have read 9 and 11 (don't ask.... *sigh*) but would like to revisit the entire series.  Also, ""Heavy Weather"" by Bruce Sterling would be an interesting find, as we're currently beginning to experience what he warned of back in 1995.  Any other Bruce Sterling would be icing on a 7 layer chocolate decadence cake you've been serving here. "

By any chance- have you ever run across a book titled ""Raptor"" by Gary Jennings?   It's a long shot- but I thought I would give it a try. 

Thanks no matter the outcome~!
And thanks for all of your uploads!"
