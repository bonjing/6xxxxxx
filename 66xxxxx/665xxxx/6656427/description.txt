This software was downloaded by me fromplus i removed the password. In my opinion it is not fair that they block software and all the crap from us with surveys, so i thought i'd share it with everyone here on TPB.
 Also i have to warn you, that i haven't tried this software myself, so use it at your own risk.
 I scanned the files with ESET NOD 32 v.4.0 and nothing was found.
 Make sure to scan the files always before you open them.
