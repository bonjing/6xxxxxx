Rihanna established her dance-pop credentials in summer 2005 with her debut smash hit, Pon de Replay, and continued to demonstrate hit potential in subsequent years (e.g., S.O.S. in 2006; Umbrella\" in 2007; Disturbia in 2008). However, it was the singers third album, Good Girl Gone Bad, that made her a full-fledged international pop star with a regular presence atop the charts. Born Robyn Rihanna Fenty on February 20, 1988, in Saint Michael, Barbados, she exhibited a certain star quality as a young child, often winning beauty and talent contests. Because she lived on the fairly remote island of Barbados in the West Indies, however, she never foresaw the sort of stardom that would later befall her.
