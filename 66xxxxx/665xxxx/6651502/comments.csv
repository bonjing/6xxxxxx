Since i olnly had the hability  ti download 60MB a hour, imagine how long it  would take to view a series with 350mb. So for that i thank you for four years of watching the series you coded.  "

Don't mind downloading the Pilot unaired, its the first version which had a duration of 1 hour and the TV channel requested to give them a three episode series."
[V],twentyforty,2011-09-06T12:28Z,"@critic89: Sherlock series was uploaded. Even Unaired Pilot, all as tiny tawny [lepton] encodes. I have BluRay and I would rip it in future days. Come and join to SU, here I upload just left-overs even month later than there.

@azrielle: ""Source"" was me - here and there....."

[V],twentyforty,2011-09-07T10:38Z,"My e-mail is in hundredths of Descriptions of torrents right here. Short asking will do. About 120 people got Invites so far, but few people are already out... SU is a private site and level of behavior is way above Hit&Run download service as TPB. Point being - sceneunderground.org is clean, nice place and true file-sharing community. 

In my opinion, every honest downloader of my torrents already joined few months ago. Others are either passers-by or crazies who have bullied me out from TPB. 

So - on TPB I do upload either left-overs or because - I want to. "
