A calibrated camera is the key to each optical measurement problem. This work introduces camera modelling and calibration in computer vision. Tobias Hanning explains the classic pinhole camera model with distortion derived from third order optics and shows how to obtain an optimal solution within this model. The limitations of the classic camera model in computer vision are explained and proven experimentally. To overcome these limitations two alternative approaches which augment the standard model are presented.
