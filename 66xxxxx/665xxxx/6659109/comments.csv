Hope you've gone through the book already; even I've only upped 14.2% as of now ..."
,tegrant,2011-09-08T01:50Z,"ON SNAP!  

Well said, F1;  and thanks for the up."
[V],_F1_,2011-09-08T07:00Z,"@jlithgow:

I can guess what you are talking about the religious troubles. But Muslims in my country is not that troublesome as  much I've come across, ofcourse there IS incompatibility. I'm from a secular country.

Got your point, but you should get mine too. This comment section is meant for the quality of the torrent, not the subject. Your frustrating comments can misguide downloaders. If you wanna discuss on it; you're most welcome to the General Discussion Forum:

,ramikaz,2011-09-08T11:23Z,jlithgow is a Zionist jew scumbag supporter of APARTHEID Israel and always spreads lies about Islam (see above) even on torrents that have nothing to do with the subject.  He is a pathetic fag that obviously has no life and will thankfully die alone.
[V],_F1_,2011-09-08T11:58Z,"@ramikaz (& if the above statement is true then @jlithgow too):

I give a shit about your religious debates (this is the first, and maybe last nasty word I've ever used @ TPB).
This is not the right place for you. I don't support Muslim, neither Jews, and not all other bla bla ... I believe in one religion and that is 'humanity' and that is my culture (not religion) taught me to believe in.

You people will get nothing spitting on each other in the name of religion, but will dirt yourselves all the way. Start believing in the religion I've mentioned: 'Humanity', be a little cultured (if you at all consider yourselves 'human')."

That book was requested, BTW ... :)"
[V],bigbluesea,2011-09-08T13:14Z,"Well said F1 

This is not the place for religious debates and hatred.

Thanks for the up partner :)"
[V],_F1_,2011-09-08T13:33Z,:) Hi BBS. Whats up dude? Going fine?
