Rare book by Swans/Angels of Light founder Michael Gira

Hereâ€™s what the late, great Hubert Selby Jr. had to say about The Consumer on the back cover:

"The Consumer is a look at the inner world of illusion, self-hatred, a search for identification through mis-identification of a lost soul. It is an all consuming book. It is certainly not a book for the squeamish, yet even the squeamish, I believe, will be hypnotized by this book. Though hallucinatory, the writing is extremely clear, crisp, succinct, as the narrator literally eviscerates himself for the reader. Yet, at the end I found myself with an unanswerable question: are the hallucinations a distortion of reality, or really closer to the reality of the world?"

Nick Cave said this:

"This is repulsive writing. Brilliant, disciplined and repulsive writingâ€¦"

Dennis Cooper said this:

" M. Gira is an astonishing writer whose belief in the power of language is almost supernatural. The Consumer is one of the purest, scariest, and most beautiful books Iâ€™ve read in years."
