Information
------------------------------

Over six episodes Tony will retrace the steps of the earliest explorers, delve into the harrowing stories of the early days of white settlement, find out how the indigenous Australians responded to their invaders, look at the turning points in Australia's development and explore the influence of multi-culturalism and two world wars on Australia's relationship to Britain - the Mother Country. He'll discover that, in some ways (eg. fox hunting), Australia is more British than Britain. And in others, Australia is worlds apart. Tony will be joined on his journey through time by some of Australia's foremost historians and writers, including Tim Flannery, Thomas Keneally, Eric Wilmott, and Geoffrey Blainey. There'll be amazing stories of conflicts, hardship, discovery, as Tony brings fascinating new insights into the impact that so many nations have had on Australian life...a unique perspective on Australian society and history. Tony Robinson travels to Australia to explore the nation's ancient and magical story, revealing its tyrannies, tragedies and triumphs.
