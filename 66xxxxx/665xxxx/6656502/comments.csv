,PlayGod,2011-09-06T22:45Z,ALSO PLEASE SEED MY UPLOAD RATE SUCKS!
,reboot2099,2011-09-06T23:01Z,"Playgod, you don't need to compress the CBR files as they are already compressed.

And it is much better to see which files are in the torrent, which we can't do if they are all compressed into the same file. 

Especially for a comic like X-Factor which has lots of volumes. I'd like to know if this is all volum and if it is, I'd like to choose which ones I want, cause there are some of them I do not want."
,TeamSwampThing,2011-09-06T23:14Z,what volumes and issues are contained in this?
,TeamSwampThing,2011-09-06T23:20Z,what issues and volumes are in this torrent?
