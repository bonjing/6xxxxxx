::Plot::
Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Gandalf, ThÃ©oden, Gamling and Ã‰omer meet up with Merry, Pippin and Treebeard at Isengard. The group returns to Edoras, where Pippin looks into a recovered palantÃ­r which grants him a vision. While using the palantÃ­r, he is seen and mentally interrogated by Sauron. Pippin tells him nothing regarding Frodo and the Ring. From this event, Gandalf deduces that Sauron is planning to attack Minas Tirith. Gandalf rides with Pippin to find the steward Denethor. Pippin swears loyalty to Denethor, his son Boromir having saved his life at Amon Hen. Gandalf urges Denethor to call Rohan for aid, but Denethor declines, fearing Aragorn and Gandalf plan to depose him. The Morgul army, led by the NazgÃ»l, drive the Gondorians out of Osgiliath. Denethor sends his younger son Faramir on a suicide mission to reclaim the city. Pippin fires a beacon, signaling ThÃ©oden and Aragorn to assemble the Rohirrim for battle.
