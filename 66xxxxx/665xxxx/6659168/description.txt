CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D


Source: DVD-R

Encode:
The dvd needed fixing very bad. For a R1 Retail DVD this disc is messed up, basically there are only
2 colours present - green and black. personally i dont have a clue what the producer wants to say
with that. White is green, red is green, brown is green. Even a ppv looks better.
Anyway, decided to fix the colours all manually, white is now white, brown is brown and red is red.
Was a load of work, but turned out watchable now. colours are nearly as they should be, tried to
find a decent way through all scenes.

Here are 4 screen comparisons how it was before and afterwards:

besides all that, i did the usual cleanup in sharpness ...
there were 10 min of deleted scenes on the disc which also had the messed up colours,
fixed these and attached them as 1 additional file for those who want to see them.
enjoy
