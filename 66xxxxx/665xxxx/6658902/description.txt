Young Dublin-based musician Patrick Kelleher has just released his debut album 'You Look Cold'. One of the more exciting Irish releases of the year, it showcases Kelleher's ambition and imagination as a songwriter as he uses a variety of instruments and implements to create an album that's slightly off-the-wall, but never conventional or boring. It's out now on Osaka Records
