Gathering Remnants: A Tribute to the Working Cowboy
Filmmaker Kendall Nelson invites today's cowboys to reflect on a timeless lifestyle and share the inner-workings of their personalities, quirks, and most intimate beliefs. "GATHERING REMNANTS" takes viewers into the lives of Ruth Jackson, Mark Jensen, Tom Hall, Darrin Pfeifer, and Sticker Wiggins and lets these real cowboys tell their own stories - granting access to the inner-workings of the cowboys' minds as they reveal their personalities, quirks, and most intimate beliefs. These "buckaroos," as they call themselves, will surprise you with their tales and perhaps prompt you to question your own life choices.
The American cowboy is a cultural icon, who has been celebrated as a symbol of freedom, hard work, and heartland values. However, reality for working cowboys expands far beyond the romantic notions of Hollywood. Today, a small number of men and women on ranches in Northern Nevada and Southern Idaho continue the time-honoured traditions and working methods that have been practiced for over one hundred years.
