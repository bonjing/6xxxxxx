If you are still around, could you seed this wonderful torrent again? It's stuck at 84.1%, and the 2-3 seeds that show up every now and then don't stay long enough to upload the missing 15.9%.

Thank you so much for the upload :)"
,viselec,2012-01-08T23:34Z,"TOS and Czech subtitles?

Please seed...   IÂ´m on 86% two days. I need this."
