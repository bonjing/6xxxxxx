AreYouTargeted.com - The Rare Original Website


The original AreYouTargeted.com was pulled down in summer 2011 and replaced by a static page.   The owner stated on recorded phone calls (the "mc-recovery" podcasts at talkshoe.com) that he had been planning to take the site down eventually, but did so abruptly being he was being set up.

This copy of the website was saved just a few days before it was pulled down and is preserved here for the historical record.
