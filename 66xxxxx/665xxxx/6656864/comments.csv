,XxM24Ty,2011-09-15T18:17Z,"This download did not run for me. UTorrent downloaded it and the burn was verified 100%. yet no media player nor virtual player will play past the menu screen. 

Sorry BL, this file and Vol #2 both appear corrupt on this end. It even took me 4 DVDs before Nero could verify a single good dvd burn of Vol #1. 

DO NOT DOWNLOAD! AVOID! -Sorry BL."

,jwilson109,2011-12-27T23:55Z,"I converted the ISO file to DVD using a free software, ISO to DVD and it plays on any DVD player but  the menu doesn't work, the vid quality is not good but it's old film, audio is OK. Great work up loader but could you use AVI instead of ISO?
Thanks to TPB "
