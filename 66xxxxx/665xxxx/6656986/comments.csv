One seeder and 329 leachers...this one is gonna take a while. It's all good. Hopefully it will be complete when I return home.

Much love for the TvTeam"

,oscar167,2011-09-07T16:33Z,"SEEEEEED PLZ
it is not move"
,bryentheartist,2011-09-07T18:44Z,I would seed but it is at 52% and has been for awhile. what gives tv team? a upload isn't any good without seeds.
,nickbbad,2011-09-07T18:51Z,There is no reason a 350 mb torrent should take over 12 hours to download.... It would be nice if you actually seeded your downloads....
,bryentheartist,2011-09-07T19:59Z,thank you it took half day to get to 52% then finished in 32 mins :) I will seed also. :)
,Kole97,2011-09-07T20:20Z,thanks guys for seeding...can't afford to miss any epis (:
,TheTrekhippy,2011-09-08T03:55Z,"I'm reading all these seed complaints and wondering,  with the trackers they put in the torrent perhaps you should add some more, better trackers manually.  That's what I do and I always get plenty of seeds."
