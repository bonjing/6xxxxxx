 1939 - A world plagued with unrest and      
 upheaval. Adolf Hitler's ruthless ambition  
 for German expansion in Eastern Europe is   
 becoming increasingly violent and inhuman.  
 Whereas another nation, India, struggles in 
 its fight for freedom against the British   
 as the idealistic Mahatama Gandhi continues 
 to appeal to his countrymen to adopt a stand
 of non-violence. A stark contrast in        
 ideologies even with an eventual common     
 opponent, Gandhi one day decides to pen a   
 letter to the German dictator... a letter he
 hoped would persuade Hitler to change his   
 path and avoid the Second World War, avoid  
 the massive calamity that it would bring on.
