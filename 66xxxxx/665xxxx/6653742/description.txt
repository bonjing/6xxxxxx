AD:155

What can I say to compliment this compilation? This album, is hella-fricken-balls-to-the-wall-awesome. There is a wide range of sounds from beautiful multi-layered hard-trance, light house, hardcore dance, and some very uplifting NRG. The mastering on this is extremely well done, the album is an adventure in awesomeness. 

Just get it, download it right now, and enjoy yourself.
