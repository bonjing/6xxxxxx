any chance you've got Batgirl #1 to upload as well?"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-07T18:53Z,"Yeah Im excited for BG1 - I just read Batgirl Year One and Im interested to see how it stacks up.

Keep it up GH - we'll just leave the 52 to you :)"
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-09-07T19:01Z,"Ain't scanned yet, don't worry I'll try to scan it asap."
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-09-07T19:03Z,"@Mr.Downtown, C'mon man, y'know I can't handle the whole thing, you're gonna have to help me :))

On another note, out of the ones uploaded so far, I found this to be a pleasant surprise."
,methosivanhoe,2011-09-07T19:25Z,"yeah, i strangely enjoyed this one as well

Stormwatch was a complete letdown, but i can't wait to see how Batgirl stacks up :)"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-07T19:34Z,"GH: If you leave us any LOL

Ive only read the preview of this issue, first few pages, but the constant bickering gets old. Also I found it sad that they had to put Batman on the cover to try to sell a JL with a bunch of nobodys. Lets see how it turns out though"
,BatDinger,2011-09-07T20:10Z,"ps youse guys
swamp thing was the SHIT!"
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-09-07T20:30Z,Sad to hear that :((
,deyknow,2011-09-07T20:30Z,I got excited when I thought they were gonna put Blue Beetle on the team. Do you have static shock?
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-07T22:05Z,"No need to request any particular 52 comic - they are ALL being uploaded as they become available, just keep checking back"
,hootieman,2011-09-08T01:38Z,"hmm the search function of this site is fucked, I type in The New 52 and get some of the comics that are on here, and this one sure as hell wasn't on the list when I searched it."
