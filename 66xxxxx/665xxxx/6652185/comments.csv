And why are you asking for iStat on a EWQL Stormdrum Intakt torrent anyway?"

There it is, free of charge.

Why are you asking for iStat in a EWQL Stormdrum Intakt torrent thread anyway?"
,idontcare007,2011-09-07T15:00Z,"sorry for asking it on this thread...but the link you sent is just a widget, and does not display everything like activity of each core...like istat menus does...if you could upload the paid version of istat menus it would be great!!

Thanks! :)"
