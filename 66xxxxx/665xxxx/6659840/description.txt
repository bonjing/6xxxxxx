Not sure if this is a home made effort,  It is 16:9 but the video info is 4:3 letter box with an attactive atmospheric moving border.   I have tagged it to industry standards and converted it to MPEG2 format for import into the DJ playback software of your choice.

The quality is good enough for pubic performances but only just.   I do wish people would not take original promo only or MixMash/Video pool source material and then compress it to within a pixel of life it's self and put it up as an MP4!!!

Sure the source file ends up at only 50 Mega Bytes in size, but what about the quality gang...  And WHY pander to the 4:3 people.  I know all the original source material was 16:9 but somewhere along the way it has been shrunk to 4:3 and now here expanded back to 16:9... Duh...  Homer Simpson springs to mind.

Hey gang, let keep everything in 16:9 screen ratio and from now on let the 4:3 people watch in Letterbox, not those who have made the investment in Hi Def Flat Screen technology...

Rant over.  Anyway worth an look and until I can source the original from Promo Only or the rest of my suppliers, this will have to do for now.
