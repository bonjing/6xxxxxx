Think Zarre_99 has a point"

,drewjohnson2783,2011-09-08T01:42Z,"Thankyou so much for all of you uploads.  My apartment was recently broken into and they took all of my dvds. 90% of which were horror films from the 80's.  I have an apple tv and the collections you have put up will go a long way to restoring that collection!!  You even have the Basket Case movies up!  I feel like I just met a kindred spirit.  If there is a way you could continue seeding the older posts, i.e., Hellraiser series, things like that it would be most apprectiated.  Thanks again!!"
