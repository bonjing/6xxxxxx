"Speak for Yourself" is Johnny's first full-length CD. It's all about the Blues - Chicago-Style Blues, Delta-Style Blues, Progressive Blues and Blues-Rock. This is where it's at for Johnny. It's all about "gettin' the feelin' out - telling the story and lettin' the house really know how the soul feels about it."

Guitar is the voice along with Johnny's vocals. "There's nothin' better than a wailin' guitar for gettin' the point across," says Johnny. "Speak for Yourself" is the title track. After getting one's attention, it's a shuffle that let's everyone know how he feels about where the relationship's going. "Whisper," "I'd a Held the Door" and "Take Out the Garbage" keep the Blues in the forefront. "Time to Fly," "The Same" and "Up One Side & Down the Other" let some progressive syle come to the Blues along with some Blues-Rock spice. "Mo Blue," Ice Storm Blues" and "Bridge Down the Road" keep the Blues feeling focused from the soul.
