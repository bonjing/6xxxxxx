REQ - Fast Crew - Set The Record Straight (SB Forum Thread)
Hey. I have been trying to find a copy of this album (Set The Record Straight ) (larger than 23.31mb's)
FastCREW is a New Zealand / Australian Hip-Hop group. Set The Record Straight (album) was released in 2004 or 2005, i think. even just the single "Set The Record Straight" would be great. Please Help, I've even tried itunes and ebay (to buy the cd) but nothing. there is 2 videos of it on youtube, but my downloader says "no video found"
