        Office worker by day, Superhero by night.

        The  world  can  make  us  invisible.  Courage  can  make   us
        incredible. Love can make us invincible. Ryan Kwanten of  TV's
        'True  Blood'  stars  in this  charming,  quirky,  and totally
        unpredictable romantic  comedy about  the superhero  in all of
        us. Griff (Kwanten), a shy  and awkward office worker by  day,
        finds escape from his  ordinary life by assuming  the identity
        of  a  fantastic  superhero  each  night.  Griff's  secret  is
        jeopardised when he meets  Melody (Maeve Dermody), a  cute but
        unconventional daydreamer. She  quickly becomes fascinated  by
        his idiosyncrasies, which  are equal only  to her own.  In the
        face of mounting pressure to live in the "real world", it's up
        to Melody  to rescue  'Griff the  Invisible' for  the sake  of
        herself, Griff and their newfound love for each other.
