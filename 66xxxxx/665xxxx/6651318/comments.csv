I mean, you can watch the film, but the video quality -  which is really one of the most important aspects of this film - is really quite fuzzy.  PLEASE BE PATIENT AND WAIT FOR A PROPER DVD RIP: the USA BluRay release date is 11 October (I contacted Amazon.com and they said they have no information on a regular DVD release in the USA); at British Amazon, both regular DVD and BluRay are scheduled for 31 October; at German Amazon, the date for both formats is 10 November."
