Anvizon \"The Set-up Machine\"

The Setup Machine 2 enables Maya users to easily and quickly rig a wide variety of CG characters. With just a few clicks, TSM2 installs a high-quality skeleton and proxy, adds a control rig, and applies basic but accurate skin weighting to human, animal, and creature models, a task that normally takes days.

The rig TSM installs is designed for maximum flexibility and control, allowing you to contort and deform the rig in ways that are impossible with most rigs used outside of major feature animation studios. Powerful integrated tools like smart FK/IK switching and IK pop elimination make animating with a TSM rig easy and fun.

And because it builds its rig with standard Maya nodes, the resulting rigged character can be used in any copy of Maya. The Setup Machine is perfect for anyone who needs a great character rig fast.


Don't believe the readme.txt; Team XFORCE cracked it first.

Enjoy.

Created the torrent after finding the plug-in, because the others sucked.
