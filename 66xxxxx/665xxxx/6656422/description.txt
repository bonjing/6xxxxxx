The two-disc â€œGet Up With Itâ€ from 1974 is perhaps a more accessible release, less repetitive than â€œOn The Cornerâ€ and more finely colored, though the shades remain mostly black and blue. This contemplative moodiness lingered in Milesâ€™ music well beyond his impending hiatus and on to his death in 1991. The personnel shifts wildly from track to track; only Miles and Henderson appear consistently on all eight selections.

Half of disc 1 is taken up by a deep meditation on the legacy of Duke Ellington written not long after his passing. The piece is underscored by Milesâ€™ funereal organ, with Dave Liebmanâ€™s alto flute adding a ghostly Ducal air. Next, a funk ballad floats on the foaminess of three guitars, Pete Coseyâ€™s pretty chordal vamps clashing with the dissonant organ. Track 3 was recorded in 1970 with Milesâ€™ important lineup of Henderson, John McLaughlin, Billy Cobham, Keith Jarrett, Herbie Hancock, Airto Moreira and soprano saxophonist Steve Grossman. â€œRated Xâ€, recorded in â€™72, sounds indeed like some twisted porn soundtrack with its horror-film organ and electric sitar.

Disc 2 begins with another half-hour marathon that sounds like an acid trip on a beach in Trinidad. Dave Liebmanâ€™s liner notes say that track 2 wasnâ€™t originally intended for Miles but he latched onto it after hearing it in the studio. It briefly sounds out of place with its large horn section and Wally Chambersâ€™ hot harmonica, but soon enough the wah trumpet brings it all back home. Next comes a tribute to Mtume, the stellar percussionist who graces most of the tracks, loping along with underwater guitar sounds. The disc closes with Milesâ€™ nod to soul icon Billy Preston. â€œGet Up With Itâ€ offers a most interesting look at Milesâ€™ artistic development across the first half of a controversial decade, a valuable document.
