I was wondering if you are able to get any children's books such as Curious George, Disney Junior Novels, Barbie, Judy Moody, Junie B Jones or any Rainbow Magic books? Anything would be appreciated greatly! Thanks for all you do!"

I was hoping you will be able to uploead the following:

How to Win Friends & Influence People by Dale Carnegie. I found one here on TPB http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6692831/Kindle_Books_-_C but once loaded it is displayed incorrectly. It looks like every sentence starts as a new paragraph which make reading very frustrating.  I am using Calibre, and tried it on Kindle and Nook with the same result.

I would also be extremely grateful for
