~RS~ ReSeed

As a co-founder of the 1980s Bayou Rhythm (along with Sonny Landreth), Mel Melton has written, toured and recorded extensivley ever since.
This album was released on Blue Moon Records in 1994, and due to quarrels with the label it is currently not available on the market anymore.

Blues, Cajun, Zydeco and Swamp music from down in Louisiana, with one of the US' best (and least known) Blues Harp players and an early (but yet brilliant) Sonny Landreth.

Enjoy and seed :o)
