The Shamen album UV from 1998.

This is my first torrent upload so I'm hoping it goes well. It took me a while to find this since every torrent on the net seemed to be dead and the Shamen discography's don't include it but I found a copy regardless. I haven't had the chance to check out the quality although the place I got it from claimed it to be 320kbps.

   1.  "Mercury"
