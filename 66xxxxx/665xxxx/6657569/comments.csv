,th-mach,2011-09-07T22:40Z,"I just looked at Musashi. Very impressive work! I'm not familiar with the book, but your version makes me want to spend time with it.

However I find when I open the .epub in ADE it doesn't recognize some of the odd characters -- it shows Takezo as ""Takez?"" -- i.e., it replaces the funny o character with a question mark.

How did you manage to spend $3000 on software and equipment for this project?? Maybe you have a high-end scanner?"
,blagas,2011-10-26T10:02Z,Thank you for the upload.
,leuenberg,2012-05-04T22:50Z,"Thanks a lot, I wanted to look for a specific paragraph in the first book of Musashi and am glad that someone OCR'ed this marvelous book by Yoshikawa.

@th-march, the ""funny"" characters are those with a macron meaning that the sound of the vowel is extended, that's how Japanese is transcribed using the Hepburn method. e.g. SĹhĹ would be read Soohoo."
