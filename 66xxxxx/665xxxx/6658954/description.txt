A 24-year-old-Dubliner with all of Joyceâ€™s love for experimentation and all of Beckettâ€™s restraint, this is Patrick Kelleherâ€™s first LP. Like Ariel Pink, minus the tape hiss, Kelleher crafts songs to be sung outside closed windows, or from behind drawn curtains. Perry Como meets Passion Pit on â€˜Until I Get Paidâ€™, as sleepy â€œdoo-wopsâ€ and grainy instrumentation sidle underneath Kelleherâ€™s slinky tones. Elsewhere, 8-bit blitzkriegs are blasted in homage to Miami Vice (â€˜He Has To Sleep Sometimeâ€™) and â€˜Coat To Wearâ€™ is the track Owen Pallett wishes heâ€™d written. Though the record swoops from texture to texture, it all remains united under a slight cloud of reverb. Ever tried. Ever failed? Oh no. Ever tried. Ever succeeded.
