,Tyrael_Archangel,2011-10-18T01:52Z,"Bad torrent, crashes my system every time i try to open any of them"
,jcorbin69993,2011-10-19T23:27Z,"MKV's have a memory leak, causes RAM to spike and explorer.exe may crash for you (it didn't for me). Had to put the files through MetaFox to repair. Works fine now though. Apart from the time I had to spend sorting this problem, good upload."
,jcorbin69993,2011-10-19T23:31Z,"Just to add to my previous comment, my download speed peaked at just over 2 MB/s."
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-10-27T12:29Z,"@nilim
""I've rolled over the p2p sites & found this wo alternative of this....""
R: so the alternative is supposed to be a 720p trilogy with 384Kbps  AAC & Subtitle....: Eng & Swe. Lol, you make us laugh.

""Yeah! That's what i want buddy. Thank you. I kicked your ass & u seed!""
R: I re-seeded well before your comment and the only arse you kicked is your own. You're so ridiculous and pathetic."

,Zapfinger,2012-06-06T22:49Z,"i dont know what it is, but something is wrong with this torrent.. everytime i open the folder my pc almost hangs itself even though i can open a 60gb folder without any problems so my pc is not too weak for the folder.. i cannot recommend this, i cant even rename the folder on my hdd and i cant fuckin delete the files anymore so i call bullshit on this one... -.-"
,Zapfinger,2012-06-06T22:52Z,when i try to rename the folder or one of the files in it explorer.exe crashes instantly and if i try to remove the files it just stays at the preparing stage of the removal forever. so i basically have an inaccessable folder with locked fucked up files on my hdd and i want it removed.. i can watch all the movies without any problems though and i can rename any other folder below or a above this one - so wtf is wrong here?!! can anybody tell me how to fix this???
