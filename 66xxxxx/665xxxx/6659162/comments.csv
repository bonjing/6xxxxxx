[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-08T02:39Z,"LOL... and as always GA probably wont get uploaded for a week :( I saw a preview of GA not BW, and it looked like GA from Smallville"
,reboot7,2011-09-08T02:48Z,"@BatDinger- Ha, I bought Batwing, but have no way to scan... it was ""Meh"" anyways.. Won't be buying #2..

@MrDowntown- Thanks for all these!! Men of War was one I didn't buy that I might now, it was actually pretty good.

Oh, any chance of a re-up of Batgirl #1? The one that's uploaded has a page 14 the same as page 11... seems to be missing that page..."
,DavianJ,2011-09-08T06:07Z,Any chance of upping Static? I've heard good things about it on the forums.
