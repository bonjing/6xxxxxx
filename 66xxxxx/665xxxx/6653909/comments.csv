A great movie with one after another twist, I had a lot of fun watching this film, great quality .BONE.
PS: about time i registered an account, Ive been downloading torrents for couple of years now anonymously. It's time i gave my own something, not much just opinion :)"

To be a true Pirate Man you need to be part of the community and start sharing. Perhaps jealous because you do not know how to upload anything?"

,GhostOnes,2011-09-06T21:15Z,"Leechers let go! Seeders please open up a bit, please. Thanks .BONE. -Ghostâźne"
,nicki101,2011-09-06T21:55Z,"@ironymon - It's the thanks to uploaders and your opinions about the ""movie"" that counts for 98% of us. It's the other 2% that have opinions which are meaningless, they just feel big behind a keyboard. 

p.s. I seed as much as I can, but living in a rural area uploading is a joke. By the time I get a movie up  20 other people already have already uploaded it. "
,PrimalFear,2011-09-06T22:47Z,"@pirateman2 I gave it a +1 just to offset your -1, I have not D/L'd the movie nor do I intend too. it's just not my cup of tea. "
,deathhead,2011-09-06T23:30Z,I'm cutting my speed down. I may as well everyone else does.
,useitright,2011-09-06T23:43Z,"At least they are not stupid enough to hold a site accountable for a few comments. Go ahead, head back to demonoid----- I am sure we will all miss you very much.  Idiot."

,FaNtAsY2011,2011-09-07T11:09Z,"why write a spoiler in the first place this is a torrent site, why would i read it when i am about to download the film, it people like this that spoil films for us because not all of the write

,LukeScooto,2011-09-08T03:04Z,"Who is anyone here or anywhere else to say if one person's opinions are better or more valid then someone elses. This is a site dedicated to free speech, so its kind of hypocritical to say that anyone can share anything they want, but then in the next sentence slam someone for their comment, whatever it might be. If you dont like the movie dont download it, if you dont like the comment, so what, move on or leave your own comment, about the movie. But to insult that person because of their opinion is just childish and it really does show your age, and that alot of the torrent sites lately are filled with kids in the 12-17 range. Most grown men dont respond with douchy comments because someone else gave an uploader a -1. He's probably 13, and like the other guy said, he could just be jealous that he cant upload any of his own movies. Who knows, who cares. Is it even worth spending time on? Bone is a big boy, if he really cares that much let him respond on his own. I dont think he needs people coming to his rescue..."

I thought this movie was pretty good. Small twists throughout. Relief to find a thriller like this again, been a while since a thriller like this has come out!"

,PupySantiago,2011-09-16T10:55Z,The stupid thing about this movie is : How the f@$k did the kids get in the gaz station at night when there is clearly no one working there ???
,PupySantiago,2011-09-16T11:03Z,Ohh yeah The video quality is good for you people who like to watch movies under 1G but there's an annoying tic tic tic if you listen carefully at the audio 
,y3n007,2011-09-24T04:07Z,"Checked the Imdb and this sounds like a real stinker, but Ray Liotta is in it and he is a great actor so I am gonna give this a chance.....thank you .BONE for the upload and I will see for a month as always......"
