,Volcanthegreat,2012-03-02T05:38Z,"Fun part is the program itself is less than 40mb. The Soundbank is 1.07gb! you can chose the soundbanks from guitar pro website for $$! Each sound bank has its different taste. There is metal, jazz, blues sound bank!

Default one is 1.07gb and without it Guitar Pro 6 is soundless"
