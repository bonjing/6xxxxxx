,nsttira,2011-09-07T03:22Z,"now that's off my chest!!!nice upload but please try not to praise yourself so much,let others do it,it's classier"

Why don't you go fuck yourself, son of a bitch? I never claimed to have anything to do with original mods - it's even stated in the description. I create many mods, patches and trainers for games, which I will also upload - but for this game, I've gathered everything, adjusted, and compiled. You think it takes five-minute work? Well, you are wrong.

Aside of my releases on PirateBay, I make dozens of other projects, I work every day from dawn to sunset. If you can't understand that, I pity you. Comprehend, motherfucker?"
,illiria,2011-09-07T04:06Z,"@ nsttira

And in case you are too fucking dumb to READ - I never praised myself. There IS NOT A SINGLE CREDIT to me in this or any other work of mine. Not in Autorun, not in installer, not in description. I describe ONLY the work that I do, never trying to claim any credits for mods, cracks or patches that I include in my work."
,illiria,2011-09-07T04:12Z,"@ nsttira

And I also assume you were referring to my ""best PC edition"" releases, that are coming in the near future? Well, guess what? I WORKED FOR YEARS on patches to Knights of the Old republic games. YEARS. Without any outside help. I assume your head is too big to pull it OUT of your ass?

Yes, I do more work than you, son of a bitch, can dream of.

Now, that I got it off my chest, go fuck yourself."

Thank you very much. :) Sorry, I take everything too personal. But yeah, I worked for 12 total hours yesterday putting all this together, editing, scripting and compiling. So... yeah. It's personal. Most people underestimate what a quality repack is about. It's a lot of work, not just ""pack and release"". That's why I don't have many torrents yet. Each of them takes a while to complete. Especially to thoroughly test.

@ kooljinam

Thank you a lot! Yes, it definitely needs more seeders... I'm seeding as fast as I can, and I have to delay my hard drive format because of it. I'll try to wait till the torrent picks the pace.


Again, I apologize before you, decent people, for this outburst. It's always a work, and it's never easy as 1-2-3. It tends to hurt feelings when someone shits on it. :P"

,illiria,2011-09-07T14:48Z,"@ irishboyblue

Thank you again. I would, however, like to sum what first posts were about for this, and future torrents of mine. In some other releases, I will also use the work of modders. Regarding that, I have three comments:

1) If they released their mods to public, then mods were released TO BE USED by public. That's what I do. Don't want them used - don't release.
2) Yes, I CAN'T AFFORD to spend hours searching for the names of the original mod creators. And believe me, I tried. Their sites are down, forum topics with their original posts no longer exist.
3) I never took credit for their work, naming it mine.

I hope after this statement, there is no more  misunderstatements and I won't have to defend my right to use freely and publicly shared work in every torrent of mine.

I know I said that quite a couple of times, and sorry for bringing it up again. Just explaining why I do what I do in crystal clear terms. I'm a modder too, and my work has been used and claimed by others plenty of times. But I realize that Web is not my personal safe locker to try imposing rules on. It's a free sharing space. Can't cope with that - stay away from it.


P.S. Glad to see torrent is finally getting seeders."
,nsttira,2011-09-07T15:53Z,"illiria:::Judging by your reply to my constructive,non abusive comments i presume English isn't your first language.I will try to explain my point to you again as clearly as possible.You say you never praise yourself!!!!that has to be one of the most blinkered statements ever issued.Here are a few examples:1:""BEST PC EDITION!"":2:""I work every day from dawn to sunset""(BOOHOO!!welcome to the real world!!):3:""I WORKED FOR YEARS on patches to Knights of the Old republic games.YEARS.Without any outside help""(surely this is the type of work the Nobel peace prize was created for!!!):If you manage to find time to reply try not to contradict yourself with every sentence and please don't be so abusive,i never questioned the quality of your uploads,just your massive ego."

,dumas1000,2011-09-08T00:08Z,"Stupid flame war. I appricate this file being put together, since it's difficult nowadays to obtain all of these mods. I could not acquire the HD cinematics mod anywhere. However, the size of the file makes it difficult for a lot of people. If you are going to upload files of this size, you need to seed this thing for a very long time. People have bandwidth issues that prevent them from downloading something like this quickly unless it is seeded by many. If it's only being seed by a few, those seeds need to stick around for probably a week, minimum. Most of the time, that does not happen and files like this die out."
,Die51,2011-09-08T05:32Z,"@dumas1000 - No worries on that, I'll keep it going for a good long while once it finishes for me."
,ben_high,2011-09-08T05:37Z,"illiria

 You said in the uploader comments that we can aim with wasd instead of mouse. If wasd is mapped to aiming then what are the move controls mapped to? Also does this upload have the keyboard icon replacements for the QTE's?

  Sorry to bother you with it here but 7 GB's is a lot to DL to find out."
,illiria,2011-09-08T06:13Z,"@ ben_high

It is specifics of all Resident Evil games to date: you can't move while you aim. When you press ""aim"" (Shift/Right Mouse Button), you can't move your character, you can move only aim. It is the same way even in Resident Evil 5. So normally, W/A/D/S are movement, but when you aim, W/A/D/S keys move your aim.

Yes, it has keyboard icon replacements for the QTE's.This is exactly why I disbled key remapping - to prevent users from screwing it up. In QTE, you will need only two combinations: Shift + E, and Space + F.
The only bug I noticed in replacements, is that it tells you to press R to control Ashley, while it is actually Q. That's why I've included readme with all the configurations described. 


@ dumas1000

Yes, I realize the size is big. But if I was to make it smaller, I would have to cut something out.

I'll keep seeding for a while, it seems... Dead Island came out, and I'm making a repack of it too. Will be seeding it too. :P"
,irishboyblue,2011-09-08T09:57Z,lliria to true this guy is proper stupid he thinks his gerry queen runs the country der cunt face your pm does ive put out stronger spliffs than him and one thing i learnt when i graduated from uni and got a very good job in the nhs was to spot metal heath ill have a word with a cpn for if not he can always just slit hes wrists and dumas no disrespect but why do you post the same comment on orther torrents too nothink lives forever 
,Wowtgp,2011-09-08T11:53Z,Illira i absolutely love your games but i would like to make a small request.when you say you can compress these games and make it of much smaller size then why dont you do it mate?it will help us alot because then we will be able to get this game faster and we can seed your game for a longer time.i hope you consider my humble request.thanks in advanse.
,illiria,2011-09-08T12:36Z,"@ Wowtgp

Yes, I can compress the games to a much lesser size, but they will install for two hours. It is a tough choice. I often compress half, and leave another half as external files - so it would install relatively fast, and will take less size. The reason why I don't bother much with compression, is because most people have a stable, fast internet connection these days. Size is usually not an issue. Unpacking time, however, is. Nobody wants to install the game they are eager to play for two hours.
I promise that I'll look into this matter, but I can't promise I'll find a better solution than going half by half, as I do now. 

I guess I will upload ""Saints Row 2"" soon. I made a nice repack for myself, that features a patch and very-hard-to-find proper crack for it. That game is a good example of nice compression and a slooow install it results in, lol.


@ irishboyblue

,dumas1000,2011-09-12T06:06Z,"This game breaks gamepad support for me. By itself, the gamepad isn't recognized at all. In conjuction with Pinnacle Profiler, the pin doesn't function properly. It could be just me. I don't know. I've compiled a similar version of this game in the past by myself and that wasn't an issue. I can confirm that it's all there, but if gamepad support don't work, personally I won't play it."
,dumas1000,2011-09-12T21:16Z,"Obviously, yeah. It seems intentional, the lack of gamepad functionality. Probably has to do with the mouse support add-on.
