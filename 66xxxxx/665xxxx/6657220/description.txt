Both shocking and entertaining is what you can call this DVD. It starts with a short news break about Meat collapsing at stage and then we get to see an hour of the July 28 2011, Pittsburgh show. It starts with Bat out of Hell and the video taper seems pretty close to the stage. Great close-up footage. After Bat the video shows us Meat Loaf on his back being attended by his crew. He finally gets up and continues the show! Pretty heroic but unfortunately his voice did suffer from the incident. The video on this is great and the audio is pretty decent. Meat Loaf, obviously after fainting on stage, sounds weak. But he keeps his humor and Paradise by the Dashboard Light is both complete and entertaining.
