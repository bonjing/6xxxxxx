Reigning CMA and ACM Vocal Group of the Year Lady Antebellum will release their third Capitol Nashville studio album Own The Night. The album's lead single "Just A Kiss" has quickly become the fastest-rising single of the trio's career, climbing into the Top 10 on Billboard's Country Singles chart in just six weeks. Own The Night follows the band's GRAMMY winning sophomore album Need You Now. Since its release in January 2010, the album has sold over five million copies across the globe, spawned three multi-week #1 hits, taken home five GRAMMY Awards and scored over a dozen other award show trophies. With the success of "Just A Kiss" already producing massive momentum for Lady Antebellum's highly anticipated release, the trio is sure to own the night.
