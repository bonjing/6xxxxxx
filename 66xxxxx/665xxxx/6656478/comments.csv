,Wolfdk,2011-09-07T19:45Z,"You also have a password protected zip file, you git.

Get it right - never protect your files with a password, only scammers do this.

And post the fricking password."
,Wolfdk,2011-09-07T19:48Z,"There are 50 seeders atm on the above link.

,PlayGod,2011-09-07T21:31Z,"There is No PASSWORD, Liar."
,Wolfdk,2011-09-08T18:29Z,"I deleted it at 99% after I checked and found all the files came up with encrypted...

Migth be because it was not finished...

I figure its pass protected and point others to a better seeded release.

And delete the crap - can see your newer uploads are not zipped - very good, but I stand on my comment."
