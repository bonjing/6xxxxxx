when adding files to itunes further into an iphone or an ipod everything is left messed out each track would be on it's own when seen in album view :(
when doing the id3 tags fill in ""Armin van Buuren"" under the ""Album Artist"" label so that they are sorted in one album and here's a +1,, thanks ;)"

[T],-inspiron-,2011-09-03T01:04Z,"Welcome everyone :)


@Phuckation : Thanks for the telling me, and you got it mate, will do that the next time ;), and if you want i can make a play list also, i only transfer albums to my ipod, so i couldn't notice, how about putting (ASOT 525) just to distinguish betwen Armin's album? wouldn't that be better?

@MitsEvX : no not yet :( and welcome, like your comments :)"
,MitsEvX,2011-09-04T23:01Z,"@-inspiron-: Thank you! And as a thank you for all your great uploads, maybe you want to have one of the best trance tracks I've ever listened to. It's from Anjunabeats 199 and it's called ""Triangle & Strings"" from Glenn Morrison (Tom Middleton Remix) ;-) Familiar with that one? http://www.housezone.lt/download/glenn-morrison-triangle-strings-tom-middleton-remix/4647/"
[T],-inspiron-,2011-09-07T21:08Z,"@MitsEvX : good tune, love it :D, thanks a lot for sharing "
,MitsEvX,2011-09-09T00:57Z,"Ok then, nice to hear! :D Your welcome!
Btw: how come your a VIP? :P Congratulations man, you deserve the pink skull!

uuuffffffffff....yeaaaaaaaaaaa"
,eXoticon,2011-09-12T07:43Z,"inspiron, your work is greatly appreciated. however, when i saw @Phuckation's comment about putting ""Armin van Buuren"" as the album artist, I disagree because Armin is not the producer of the songs. I'd prefer if you put it as ""A State of Trance"" as the album artist.

Reason is, Armin releases albums such as Mirage, Imagine, Universal Religion, etc. which you can get in form of CDs/digital purchase, but that's not the case with ASOT radio show.

Nevertheless, I really want to thank you for the good work you put in."
,Cheyenne-tgy,2011-10-14T12:43Z,thanks mate.
