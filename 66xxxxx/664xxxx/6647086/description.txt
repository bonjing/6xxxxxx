Lightning Strike
The extraordinary journey of a lightning bolt: from creation to destruction, outer space to the inner workings of the human brain, life and death - all in less than the blink of an eye. We look at lightning - one of nature's weirdest, most destructive and well observed phenomena. But it's also one of the least understood. Faster than a speeding bullet, six times hotter than the surface of the sun, it can turn sand to glass, and strikes our planet up to eight million times every day. We follow a bolt on its incredible journey through the atmosphere, from creation, to destruction - and beyond. We reveal dramatic new discoveries, shocking experiments that prove lightning is one of the weirdest, most destructive, and important phenomena on Earth.
