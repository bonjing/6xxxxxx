[T],teslaman,2011-09-02T10:58Z,"Lol, well if you are happy with the 350mb rips then by all means, go for it. ;) It definitely does not look the same as them though. If it did, I wouldn't even bother making them. But what the heck, lets do a comparison just for kicks:

350mb = 624x352 @ 955kbps 1-pass capture with 128kbps vbr stereo MP3 audio.

700mb = 720x400 @ 2,061kbps 2-pass re-encode from 720p scene rip on best quality encoding settings with 256kbps 5.1 surround sound AC3 audio.

Just some additional useless FYI, lol... At one point I even did 350mb re-encodes, which because of the 2-pass and HD source, still looked 2x as good as the regular 1-pass scene rips. But, I prefer the much better 700mb quality. :)

Anywho....Cheers!"
