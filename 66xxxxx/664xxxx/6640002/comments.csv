,iluvdds,2011-09-10T22:23Z,"Anyone get this to work yet? I tried to install over dragon 11 premium and I kept getting error message, It did not work. Maybe there is some special way to install it. Please post if successful,
Thanks!"
,iluvdds,2011-09-11T21:41Z,"Okay guys I figured it out,

1.  DISCONNECT FROM THE INTERNET!

2.  Back up your user profile.

3.  Unselect automatic updates under ""tools"", ""options.""

4.  Close Dragon NaturallySpeaking and all other programs.

5.  Double-click on the service pack link that you downloaded, and follow the instructions.  Reboot your computer as soon as you are done installing.

If everything installs correctly, you will be able to open up the DragonPad, say a word, choose that word, and say ""quote that"" and it should automatically quote that word.  Thanks to the up loader for a great torrent.  You are the bomb!

By the way, I wrote this whole message using Dragon NaturallySpeaking 11.5."

,dickpeters,2011-10-08T15:49Z,this service pack will not work if you have the dragon v.11 spanish version on your cpu.  it's not compatible even though it will tell you when you open dragon english v.11 to update.
