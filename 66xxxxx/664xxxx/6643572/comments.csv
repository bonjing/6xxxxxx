[V],DownTYU,2011-09-01T04:21Z,"Subtitles are included inside the mkv file as vobsub which I don't prefer, so I OCRed them into srt.
And are you a shitless fool ...Since when you need to create an account at subscene.
DONT FUCKING BULLSHIT ME."

,tverlaine,2011-09-01T16:37Z,It took me less than a minute to download English subs without any need to do anything like submit a password or a username.  Thank you for your excellent work on this.
