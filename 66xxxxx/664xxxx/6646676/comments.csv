,rjt2291,2011-09-02T22:47Z,Thanks! but there is a problem with Spaceship on the 2009 album. Not really a problem but it is 300kbs and not 320kbs and WMP will not play it right. It works correctly with VLC though.
,HMD3,2011-09-03T08:49Z,"@rjt2291, its probably just a goffed up id3, hapens sometimes, I just missed it, but foobar will fix it. Just goto tagging, uncheck id3's 1/2 and check ape, then again but reverse."
