 People are given help finding their perfect home, even if it needs a bit of   
 renovation.                                                                   
                                                                               
 Kirstie and Phil are in Harrow where meet a young couple who are desperate to 
 find their first married home together, but who are also very particular about
 living in the expensive suburb of London, Pinner. They are also in            
 Hertfordshire where they attempt to help a couple of new parents find a       
 property in Hitchin.
