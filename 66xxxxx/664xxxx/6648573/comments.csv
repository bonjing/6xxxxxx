The original cam i used to make the work in full screen had big black borders cutting the picture view not only on the horizontal but also on the vertical of the full screen viewing and if that it is not enough looking with more attention to the picture detail the corners had slight inclinations not giving the correct rectangular viewing that it is normal when watching the movies , all of this imperfections was corrected to a perfect widescreen view simply delightfull and as usual with the nice work of the dub plugins , the colours improved and borring particles at the picture background reduced to the minimum giving with all this work a very nice normal movie vewing , picture and audio are also very acceptable on this cam , so after this work , we get the best possible movie file under the circunstances .

enjoy ... "
[V],globeplus,2011-09-03T10:32Z,"Download the best player for RMVB files on the below link (FREEWARE) :

MEDIA COPE :

http://www.mediacope.com/media-cope-download.html

Now , anyone can ask : why this one ? because he integrates the RMVB player btween another nice thingsand while viewing the RMVB file it is possible to put the picture anywhere on the movie time , with rhe basic RMVB player the watching is very nice but only watching the movie in a consecutive way , so if you already watched 50 minutes and must get out , when you want to continue the watching you need to start from the beginning again , now beside this inconvenience that doesnÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t happen on the Media Cope and integrate the RMVB Player , the watch of the movie even for this size of RMVB looks absolutly normal like the avi wih many bitrate , the user is simply watching without thinking about the size and the quality very acceptable in did , so Media Cope installed is the perfect partner for this type of video files .

Happy movie to all of you ."
[V],globeplus,2011-09-03T10:33Z,"Hi again and this comment is to make a note about the RMVB video and after more tests and having in mind the picture stability for not too much bitrate , it is possible for even less size keep a nice picture with this type of video , what it is surprising somehow and i am uploading the files with more than 200 mb what in the pratic without any exageration are really enough for a nice watch of the movies because the good picture stability for not too much bitrate and if i uploaded this movies maybe i should say 150 mb they was ok to watch anyway , this interesting carachteristic about the RMVB video make that the users feels really confortable watching nice movies for not too much file size and really donÃ‚Â´t care like that , it is like beeing watching 1.3 or 1.4 gb avi or something and no problem anyway and i suggest positively to download and install the Media Cope (freeware) that have the link in a before comment , this Media Cope program not only have a very nice player very appropriated for the RMVB files but also another features like : Audio/Video Cutter , Audio/Video Joiner , Audio Converter , Video Converter , Photo Cutter , Slide Show and more ... and it is freeware , so really recommended to take a look .

See all of you around and close 200 mb RMVB files have nice picture and sound like the many mega video files and i am serious saying this , the flvs for example that it is possible to keep a good picture for not too much bitrate , for this kind of size have a normal tendence to get some pixelization after the conversions creating little unfocus borrings resolutions beside beeing watchables anyway , this ovideo type donÃ‚Â´t , no matter what picture and sound still ok even in full screen for not too much video size and with appropriate players , i am starting definetly with more viewings of this type of video to be a fan of the use of this video type and this can happen to all of you with more movis watched in RMVB ... enjoy and happy movie to all of you ."
[V],globeplus,2011-09-03T11:59Z,"Hi , this a report about Media Cope well known bugs beside beeing a very good RMVB player , we hope that this bugs can be corrected with new versions :

- Problem playing file message after running any video but that donÂ´t affect anything and the video works fine 

and ..

- the normal time indication when the movies runs stays at 0h0m0s but of course no big deal because of that too 

NOTE : to get full screen just do a double click with the left mouse button on the picture

Media Cope really is a fantastic freeware with many nice features but the player have this insigficants circunstancial bugs that maybe can be corrected on news versions of the program ... enjoy and happy viewing to all of you .

PS:. donÂ´t forget also that with a nice converter the file can be converted to an high quality video type , DVD or HD , it is up to user , so are many possibilitys to watch the movie , enjoy ..."
,sagar2011,2011-09-03T12:22Z,@Globe:: u r a fucking retard...stop uploading this crap......
[V],globeplus,2011-09-03T12:47Z,"To sagar2011 : you look like something is needed in your ass or something but this files are not the correct place for that , if i am wrong just be bother with me , donÂ´t forget that the users always have the option to choose to download or not but the work on this one is really wonderfull and correct and really recommended and yes media cope is fine beside the little bugs .

PS :: DonÂ´t insult the uploaders , they upload the files with the best intention possible to make a nice file share with the other users and this movie file is really great , not only because the movie but the work done too , just believe me ."
,skt12,2011-09-04T13:47Z,Man Upload ripped version of Deus X-Human revolution (PC). Try to upload newly released games as soon as possible!. (If Its no TRoUbLe for u)
[V],globeplus,2011-09-06T08:24Z,"To skt12 : well , no one more than me liked to do what you ask but unfornatly i still have a slow connection net and for giga files it is ridiculous the upload , i canÂ´t put the downloaders a week or more downloading a game file just for example a couple of giga , thank you for your request recognising my possible nice positive work for that type of files but for the moment only files without too much size like movies , small games or applications and yes beside my present net i still have all the correct file sharing spirit but limited to what it is possible for me to work for the moment ...

Thank you for your comment and you welcome to download this RMVB movie files that are real nice work for any possible user in my neutral perspective ."
