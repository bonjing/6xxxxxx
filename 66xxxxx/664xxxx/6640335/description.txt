Al Jolson does music from the 20s and 30s in sincere fashion for the period
Some great standards are included in this line-up in his uniquely gifted style.

He sometimes is a bit austere in his voice tenor, however he more than often
gets it just right for a star performance - uniquely so!

If you want in on 20s and 30s music, here is a great place to begin
