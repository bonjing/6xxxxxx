,Timothious,2011-08-31T17:28Z,Ok... so I Found Homey Don't Play and Esham For Mayor... The Problem is NO SEEDERS!!! As soon As I get them I'll upload an updated Discography
,wc662,2011-09-10T08:48Z,great shit seed
,Timothious,2011-10-18T00:15Z,I'm not sure why it got cleared out but I'm starting to seed again :) sorry guys
,Hippnotic,2011-10-21T08:30Z,This needs seeds! You have everything I need... except for ONE thing: Life After Death. I even looked at the other torrents on here and no one seems to have it? I must have it...
,Hippnotic,2011-10-21T08:35Z,Nvm my last comment. I was thinking it was by ESHAM but it was NATAS. IDK wtf I was thinking at the time.. still seeding for you and giving it a DL.
,Timothious,2011-10-22T05:59Z,"hippnotic, i have alot of natas too... you think i should upload them too??"
,Timothious,2011-10-22T06:07Z,"heres my natas torrent, let me know if im missing anything"
,Timothious,2012-02-18T22:20Z,"Sorry guys I have to stop seeding for awhile :( if this torrent happens to die, I'll re-do it when I get back online."
