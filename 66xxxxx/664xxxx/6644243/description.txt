Greetings!

The DVD is shared as an ISO image that you can burn straight to DVD choosing the "burn image" function or equivalent from your DVD burning software (such as Nero or imgBurn). For those of you who are not familiar with ISO files, the operation of "burning the ISO image" is not the same as burning a DVD that *contains* the ISO file. Rather, the ISO is an "image" of the actual DVD. If this is unclear, Google "how to burn an ISO image".

"On the spiritual circuit, Dolano is not a famous person like Eckhardt Tolle or Osho or the Dalai Lama. Why? The closer to the end of the path, the fewer the people you will see there. There are some big bright lights whose job it is to attract as many people as possible to the path. They have to speak a form of truth that will echo with people from all walks of life. Dolano's work is different. Dolano's light will not attract people who are not yet on the path. She will appeal to those who are already on the path and who have tried many things."
