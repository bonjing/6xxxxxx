         After Ryder gets a bad grade on his history paper, Joe        
         talks to his teacher in hopes of raising his grade, but       
         he manages to only make the situation worse; distressed       
         at how upset Ryder becomes with him, Joe goes back to a       
          teacher to sort things out.
