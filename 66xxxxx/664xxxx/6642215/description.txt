well bringing you now another fresh new build of vlc player 1.1.12
from yesterday : August 30
untouched and still as beta stage and not official yet anyway.
This version is still under developement and will be the very next version of
our dear vlc player.
This is normaly the very latest stable build of the day.
Howewer may crash a bit in certain conditions-situations.
You must delete all cache when uninstalling any previous version before this one.Uncheck : check automaticaly new version as this option does not work
anymore with this kind of beta version.vlc-cache-gen.exe can sometimes crash to installation beginning.This is mostely due by the fact your previous cache has not been reseted-deleted.
Anyway,if you get any problem,feel free to post your feedback here below.
don't forget to regulary check most trackers of your torrent.
some can close or decide to refuse your connection sometimes.
a N/A means that you will have to delete the relied tracker so.
You can add others and more trackers as well.
Enjoy and have fun
a very nice day to all
regards
