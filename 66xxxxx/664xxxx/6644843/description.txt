This group is a "must have" for every warm blooded human being
to enjoy and experience in their walk on the planet - equally speaking!

This 2006 CD of "the very best of" did not do the same justice to
a great song "escucha me" as compared to the 1995 version so both
are included here for you to compare.

That said, you should have all their best stuff - and thats mainly
pretty much all they do - across the board - They are mong my favorites
along with Yanni - for a different effect - yet Euro humanly vibrant even 
more are both groups offerings!

enjoy!
