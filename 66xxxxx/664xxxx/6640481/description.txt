[AUDIO ONLY]

Radiohead â€“ The King of Limbs: Live From The Basement is a 55-minute performance from one of the most successful and critically acclaimed acts of their generation, who have sold over 30 million albums worldwide. The programme will feature the notoriously elusive band performing the entirety of their celebrated new album in a studio setting with some additional behind the scenes material.

From The Basement sessions, produced by no other than Radioheadâ€™s 6th member Nigel Godrich, are true gems among live acts. This time itâ€™s no different. If you havenâ€™t been convinced by the studio album of TKOL, give it another shot by watching the live recording below. Itâ€™s one of the best performances Radiohead have ever done.
