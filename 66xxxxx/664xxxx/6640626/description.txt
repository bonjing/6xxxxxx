This volume provides an overview and an understanding of REST (Representational State Transfer). Discussing the constraints of REST the book focuses on REST as a type of web architectural style. The focus is on applying REST beyond Web applications (i.e., in enterprise environments), and in reusing established and well-understood design patterns when doing so. The reader will be able to understand how RESTful systems can be designed and deployed, and what the results are in terms of benefits and challenges encountered in the process.

Since REST is relatively new as an approach for designing Web Services, the more advanced part of the book collects a number of challenges to some of the assumptions and constraints of REST, and looks at current research work on how REST can be extended and applied to scenarios that often are considered not to be a good match for REST.

This work will help readers to reach a deeper understanding of REST on a practical as well as on an advanced level.
From the Back Cover
Exploring ways of developing and implementing applications for REST, the Representational State Transfer system architecture conceived along with the World Wide Web, is gaining prominence as a research topic in academia and industry. Edited by two of the leading lights in REST research, this volume features edited and expanded papers from a key workshop at the 2010 World Wide Web conference, as well as further contributions by researchers on the cutting edge of REST development. The chapters aim to build understanding between those engaged in the abstractions of academic research on REST and the many originators and designers of processes claiming to be â€˜RESTfulâ€™.

As well as covering the core principles of RESTâ€™s architectural style, this significant contribution to the literature on Web development examines a number of REST applications that appear to display advantages over its competing â€˜WSâ€™ architecture. Contributors also assess the benefits REST brings to pervasive computing and cast an eye towards the future with a section on open research questions such as deciding on resource granularity, modeling metadata, and handling transactions.
