,mindvoyager,2011-09-03T14:57Z,"Hey Bantha-Poodoo
If you can't think of anything more intelligent to say than this homophobic crap, you'd better get offline."
,d2235,2011-09-03T16:36Z,"hey all,
i think Bantha-Poodoo needs to b crucified upside down!!! he deserves it!!! :)"
,elsmeghead,2011-09-03T20:30Z,"Makes you wonder why Bantha PooDoo is still downloading Torchwood, doesn't it? He must be a closet bumder !
Ta for the upload

10/10"
,6patera9,2011-09-03T22:46Z,"Thanks ! And lolz at Bantha-Poodoo, so very backwards thinking...."
,TheSecretUchiha,2011-09-04T01:48Z,"I agree with Bantha-Poodoo but not 100%,yes the scenes with Jack kissing and...doing stuff with guys are very growse and should be removed,or atleast keep them but add some girl-girl parts haha.But Torchwood is a amazing show and as a SF lover i say Torchwood and Doctor Who are the best...so i think some gay scenes shouldnt stop us from whatching it."
,spook69,2011-09-04T02:52Z,The only reason they do the gay thing is so people will watch the show/ratings.  hello...so far as i can see no one here is saying anything intelligent. we have a homophobe making stupid comments. hey! guess what...every single person on earth has had a homosexual thought of some sort at some point in life. And my guess is that Bantha-Poodoo has had one of those thoughts and now feels guilty and so he has to take it out on gay people. okay...i feel better. Torchwood is an awesome show!! just enjoy it
,LawnMowerKing,2011-09-04T05:05Z,"THE LATEST FROM THE  GREATEST!!!!

YOUR NUMBER #1"
,xboxhaloalive,2011-09-04T05:26Z,"haha Bantha-Poodoo is homophobic, you just need to give it a chance big boy haha"
,Sattori,2011-09-04T10:03Z,Thanks! I wonder if there will be a 5th season after this moderate boredom. Is it just a coincidence that they seem to run out of good ideas at Dr. Who too?
,akira1422,2011-09-04T12:41Z,"Hey Bantha-Poodoo, don't like it? Don't watch it.  Russell T Daviees is gay too, just a heads up."
,Fuji8355,2011-09-05T04:31Z,hey what wrong with the audio??
,Fuji8355,2011-09-05T16:44Z,nvm. audio/video great! just problems with my drivers
,ivansama,2011-09-05T17:09Z,l really love how it's getting under the religious jackasses' skins XD awesome show 
,ronnix,2011-09-06T07:10Z,"I think ""poodoo"" pretty much sums it up. Disgusting."
,ronnix,2011-09-06T07:13Z,"I should verify. ""poodoo"" is disgusting; Torchwood is far from. Far more intelligent than, and far too much so for poodoo."
,AshardAsNails,2011-09-09T00:46Z,"The gay scene depicted in the story was indeed critical to the story-line and you are extremely shallow and homophobic to not see this, You are also ignorant because the scene to which you refer was in episode 4/8 not this episode 4/9. Bantha-Poodoo you are just an ignorant uneducated moron that has nothing better to do than judge people, what failings have you got to hide eh?"
,Iyatiku,2011-09-10T04:48Z,Thank you. All of your posts are excellent quality.
