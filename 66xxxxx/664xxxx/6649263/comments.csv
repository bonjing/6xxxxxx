Not sure what happend..hope the channel I get my episodes from can fix the problem soon...!! I won´t be able to get the missing episodes without the problems so I will be back with the episodes when the problem is fixed...So Sorry..!

we are thankful for everything you are doing for us! :-)

is the sync problem variable or static? if its staticly maybe it can be fixed with VirtualDub but it may require more work than its worth."
[T],MsFenmore,2011-09-09T18:42Z,the current show is working again.. I tried it almost 2 hours with VirtualDub to fix it...and it didn´t work...and then I gave up...so I hope now it will stay Ok...
