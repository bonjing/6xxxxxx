Notes:
Ok. Been working on this for a few days now. Playin wi colours n filters mainly and runing a 2 step encode. Started with imagines 480p and did a test run of it, while i waited for the 720p. I personaly had issues with the 720p file to start with. Mainly a small degree of corruption in the avi container and audio. I had to repair the avi container to encode the video correctly but had to revert to the audio track from the 480p.

Work done:

Video: Did this in two stages. First, i used the youtube hd trailer linked above to help me tune in elements such as colours, contrast, hue, saturation, brightness, whitescale etc. I encoded this to lossless decompressed rgb in 720p. At this point i concidered doing the final encode in 720p but decided against it. I created a script that resised it down to 720 x 304 like all the others. Used a decent sharpner and my custom seesaw script with my fav blender. I then encoded this in x264 to retain as much detail as possible.

Audio: Like i said, the one in the 720p was damaged. I could demux it but it wouldnt decompress to wav so i could work on it, due to corruption. So i took the one from there 480p, lowered the volume on that little intro to be less harsh, gave the high end a big lift and the bass a lift, ran over the final result with denoiser to remove the inevitable excess hiss from the high end lift.

I think the end result on this is realy nice and av gota give props to imagine for such a challenging source that had loads of potential. I had alot of fun with this one
