[T],karaokeking123,2011-09-14T23:35Z,"its right in front of you ,where it says key-/+
in the middle of the screen"
,Johan1962,2011-09-16T08:47Z,"Thank you for the reply. I have now looked all over and cannot find this key+/-. Where in the middle of which screen are you referring to? I don't want to sound dumb but I honestly don't see it. Remember I have PCDJ VJ Version 5.2.
Regards
Johan (DJ JayVee)"
