,InstantStarFan7,2011-08-31T04:24Z,"IT says 8 seeders? WHY!? There are 0. This freakin sucks.. I have it recorded on DVR but it's not HD and it has commercials which takes away from the show. I love TVTeam but this is ridiculous. No reason there shouldn't be at least 1 seeder. EZTV started to take a freaking day or more to upload their shows, so can't get it from there! >:|"
