,cazgrl,2012-02-24T06:01Z,thank you @Zen_Bud ! :)
,tehnores,2012-05-14T01:35Z,"zathras69 is right, this is not a very good rip. Not only can I not find English subtitles that sync, the video appears choppy, and it has odd, random color tinting that pops in and out.

I deleted this rip and got the 3Li Director's Cut rip instead, which works fine."
