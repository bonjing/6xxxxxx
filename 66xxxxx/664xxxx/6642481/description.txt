A lot of folks will tell you that Robert Johnson was the King of the Delta Blues. But for godâ€™s sake donâ€™t say it in front of Reverend Peyton. The guitar-wielding leader of The Reverend Peytonâ€™s Big Damn Band has no problem praising Johnson and his incredible body of work. â€œBut thereâ€™s only one King of the Delta Blues, and his name was Charley Patton,â€ Peyton said. 

â€œIâ€™ll go toe-to-toe with anyone who says different.â€ This summer Peyton and his band released a powerful tribute to their hero in the form of Peyton on Patton. The 13-track CD exclusively features songs written and recorded by Patton during his brief recording career, which came to an end upon his premature death in 1934.

â€œHis playing style melded the delicate elements of Mississippi John Hurtâ€™s music, the vocal anguish and slash-and-burn acoustic slide styles of Charley Patton and Son House, the rebelliousness and everyman storytelling of folk icon Woody Guthrie, and a hint of Americana rock of the kind performed by Scarecrow era John Mellencamp, also a Southern Indiana native.
