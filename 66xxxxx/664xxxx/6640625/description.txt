Ripped from the new live stream from Glenn Beck's web site. I have edited out the  
music played during the commercial breaks.

Notes: So, I may have a different perspective on this since I'm editing these streams every day for the past 8 months... but is Glenn Beck getting lazy as far as Radio rules go?  In the past couple of months he has gotten a little lazy or loose in throwing to commercial breaks (live or not), and he talks very deep into the outro music that hands off to local radio affiliates... today I have two distinct examples.  

In Hour 2, he talks us out to nothing, where he should be doing a live commercial and dead air is there until he suddenly jumps into the live commercial he should have been doing.  I left this in and faced out during the commercial as it was standard.  

Hour 3 they all 3 (Glenn/Pat/Stu) all talk well over the end of the show (where normally you'd hear "Mercury" that I always use to fade out of Hr3) and well into the music where again the Radio affiliates should be taking over.

Anyways, sorry for rambling, just wondering if anybody else notices... :)
