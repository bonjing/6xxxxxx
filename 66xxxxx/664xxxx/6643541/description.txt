2-Disc Collector`s Edition. Jesse Andrews stars as Elle, a call girl with issues in her past. Through a series of sexual experiences, she is able to find and accept herself, and discover the possibilities of personal freedom.She is young, somewhat naive, and she has done wrong. She is romanced by materialism, and a type of lifestyle, but deep down something isn`t right about the way she feels about herself. This manifests itself in her sexual emotions, and her dynamics, and enables her to experience and come to terms with her deeper feelings of guilt and a lack of self worth.The story is intended to be a visually poetic and sexually powerful journey towards acquiring the freedom she has been searching for by being honest with herself, taking responsibility, and making amends.
