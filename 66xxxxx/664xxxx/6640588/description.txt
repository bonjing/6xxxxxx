very good condition, complete.

This is the 43rd film in the series and this is where the marathon from summer 1999 concluded without any host saying nothing, i thought that was a little abrupt since the host surely would have said some closing remarks. They had run 14 weeks of triple features, this film ran by itself. Although prior to starting the triple features , during the all night marathon featuring random flicks from the series they ran 'In The Money', the last film in the series.
