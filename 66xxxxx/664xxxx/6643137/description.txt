None of the files I will be uploading are mine, the credits go to others. 

All the files can be found on bittorrent sites. 

All have been re-encoded and cleaned up.

To everyone who don't hit and run but keep on seeding - THANKS.

This is a 2 x dvd9 set.

Mickey Mouse In Black And White The Classic Collection 1929 - 1935 D1
Mickey Mouse In Black And White 1928 - 1934 D2
The dates are correct.

When D1 has enough seeders D2 will be uploaded. 


Enjoy
