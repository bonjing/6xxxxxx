Ive often thought of designing course-ware for a website in many
areas such as accounting electronic economics psychology and many
other subject areas that would be suitable to such an approach.

I bought this cd new and un-opened on the way home tonite from a sidewalk
used book vendor for two dollars - although amazon is offering it for forty bucks

personally after trying a couple of questions and seeing the style of this 
software here Id say the two dollars was the right amount - or
why not free

Its ony to give you an idea of what could be done - however visit
their site on the net to see what areas are covered and whether
its worth the bother to you just yet

cheers
