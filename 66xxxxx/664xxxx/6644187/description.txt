Another siiick edition of the heavy dubstep saga!

featuring 2 mixtapes of me (TGDubbs) and a shitload of dubstep and some jump-up to skank out to while going to school ;)


And again, if you want me to include you in the next edition of Heavy Dubstep , hit me up @ Tariq_gemmeke@hotmail.com and we'll talk business ;)


oh and if the filenames come up wrong or something , i'm sorry but itunes is being a bitch to me in changing the filenames as in artist names etc. so sorry! 

peace,

Bit-Step & TGDubbs
