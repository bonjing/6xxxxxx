I will choose to ignore them. Islam is the religion of anti-christ, and Muhammad the child rapist and  Bandit was the anti-christ. That  is why the Bible is banned in all Islamic Countries.

As far as Zakir Naik goes, he is doing what Muslims do best - lie for the sake of religion. It is called Al Takiyya in Islam and is used by scores of muslims to lie and marry hindu and  christian girls. Seach with the keywords ""Zakir Naik liar"" and you will get several sites which  list his lies. 

Islam and Islam alone will remain the worst religion of  all and this you can see this when you look around you at all the persecution, violence, rape and murder committed by Muslims, the Bloody Swines. "
,powcub,2012-02-02T21:08Z,"It's to bad, the movie sound is out of sync. It not much, but easy noticeable. 

IndianChristian, if you want the movie to get out to the people to watch it, it wise to work with that. 

The picture is ok. "
