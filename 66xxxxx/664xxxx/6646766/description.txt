Here we are finally done with both versions (in terms of source) of "Bodyguard".
Version 2 had some issues with regard to Audio, which has been taken care of, to the best possible extent.
As per our view, we would recommend Version 1, although both versions are good.
We have tried to give our best. Enjoy !!
