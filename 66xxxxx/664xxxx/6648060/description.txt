The Day the Towers Fell.History Channel.DVDR.DVD9.rECOn

As I was going through my videos, I found this digital rip of a fascinating account of the 9/11 event.  I searched very hard for other torrents of the same video, but none could be found.

The History Channel deserves credit for a wonderful job of recreating the drama and terror of that day as seen through the eyes of the photographers and others who witnessed the events.  While it's not the best quality video, especially compared to current HD content, the emotion and words are well worth the download.  I assure you that there will not be a dry eye in theroom.  Play it for your friends and family.

This is my gift to those who were directly affected, either themselves or their loved ones, by the brutal terrorist event of 10 years ago 09/11/01.

I encourage everyone who enjoys this to purchase the DVD.
