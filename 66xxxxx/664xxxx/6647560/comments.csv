All the sub's I have been able to find are out of sync so far.  Looks a very good movie, but unless you speak Japanese or Swedish (Swedish sub's are hard coded), this DL may not be for you.  

For those who will enjoy the film with the language options proovided, A and V are both excellent and it's a great UL.

Can anyone give me a hint why the G + H hotkeys for sub' syncing in VLC appear to fanction correctly but the subs do not re-sync?  Is it an issue with SRT files?  Any help appreciated.  "
