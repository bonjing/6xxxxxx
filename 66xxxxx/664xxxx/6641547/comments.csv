,Die51,2011-09-03T00:14Z,"Once again, perfect. Why do you not have a skull yet? I follow you more than anyone else. :("
,Mikeee200,2011-09-04T06:10Z,"This is Great it works and no Viruses, Just one Question How far into the game do you have to be to be able to use all this?"
,illiria,2011-09-04T17:44Z,"@ Mikeee200

You don't have to be far into the game. As soon as you reach Gemlen's house (Kirkwall), you can use everything. It's almost at the start of a game. Maybe 15-20 minutes of playing, if you play from the very beginning."
,BlackoutGeek,2011-09-04T20:45Z,"Ah, I've been looking for the recently released item pack. Thanks for this! I've seeded most of torrents to know this will be flawless."
,BlackoutGeek,2011-09-04T20:51Z,"... most of 'you're' torrents...

goddamn typo -___-"
,OOHFFS,2011-09-06T18:30Z,"Hey illiria, will this work if I have DA2 but already with another cracked DLC pack? Or do I have to reinstall DA2 clean?"
,vk_1989,2011-09-06T22:28Z,"hey illiria...i have installed the the game correctly but when i start the launcher it says DRAGONAGE2LAUNCHER.XML
could not be found....what should i do?plzzzz help."
,illiria,2011-09-07T01:38Z,"@ OOHFFS

It will work over another DLC pack, yes.

@ vk_1989

Game file is missing. Not a file from my repack though, the original game file. You need to reinstall the game."
,calvinloh,2011-09-19T12:16Z,"How do I, quote:""Download the archive and unpack it into your game folder""?"
,dudu96,2011-09-20T21:43Z,"Hey just tell me fast: I used your 1.02 pack *FIXED*... When i enter the house its ok but i cant go out cuz the game crashes every time i try to do it!!! I cant get my items or go anywhere... 
PLS Tell me that this isnt going to be the same here OR what to do?!?
Thx for the awesome torrents!!!"
,gshoes,2011-10-02T07:16Z,illiria: YOU...ARE...A...GOD. 
,illyriametal,2011-10-02T14:49Z,does this include the 1.03 patch? cause i installed your dlc 1.03 patch pack before knowing this existed. can i install this safely? or will this remove the 1.03 patch?
,illiria,2011-10-02T22:00Z,"@ calvinloh

Extract contents where your game is.

@ dudu96

Game crashes are unrelated to my repack/torrent, I don't know what can be the possible cause.

@ illyriametal

Includes patch 1.03. you can install on top of any patch and DLC."
,joe531,2011-10-05T07:36Z,"I am on Act 2 into the game, what happens exactly when I install this pack? Im a bit confused because i've already picked up all my Item Pack 1 from the uncle's house and now I have my own house, so do the Item Pack 2 appear in that house still or my own? And what about quests half way through? Do i need to restart them?"
,mintholly,2011-10-09T08:28Z,"Hey illiria! Mark of the Assassin has been leaked for PC!

,mintholly,2011-10-10T00:09Z,Do you think you could make a crack for it?
,Meier_V,2011-10-12T10:18Z,Only English? Or Russian too?
,Banzay27,2011-11-15T20:04Z,"Great stuff, thanks kindly, illiria.
Although DA2 was a disappointment, yours was a very conveniently neat and enjoyable work.
Voted up."
