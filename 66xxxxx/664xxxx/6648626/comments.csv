,ramikaz,2011-09-04T22:35Z,"Nick Fury is a WHITE guy, and shouldn't be played by that Zionist a-hole Samuel Jackson!!!"
,jhelton8981,2011-09-26T03:06Z,Nick Fury is also a fake character and your a dirty schmuck.
,Mshake,2011-10-02T01:41Z,How about a quality comment? Just sayin. Is it the same as the rest?
,monkeymanjim,2011-10-05T12:28Z,The original Nick Fury was white yes but was then later based on Samuel L Jackson who is one of the coolest motherfuckers on the planet so deal with it you racist Gimp..

Thanks a bunch for the U/L!"
