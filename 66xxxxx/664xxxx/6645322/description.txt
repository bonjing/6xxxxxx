Playboy Centerfolds - 1960s complete in JPG format.

These are taken straight from the C2C HD, individually saved as PDF, exported to TIF, dead white area (created in the PDF saving process) stripped away and then individually color and density corrected in PS - thus the CC added for "color corrected".  Last they were saved as Quality 10 JPGs and lossless rotated to vertical where needed.

They are 2175 px on the short side, 4548 long side.  Since they are from the C2C drive, they have NOT been butchered by some hamfisted correction or "restoration" algorithm (as is the case with most of the CyberClub images), and they still have the original "Playmate Of The Month" text as first printed.  I'm fairly certain that the folks that made the C2C drive used the centerfold masters from the bound The Complete Centerfolds coffee table book for scanning - you know, the big one that came in an attache case.

1970s are being worked on and I will upload when able.
