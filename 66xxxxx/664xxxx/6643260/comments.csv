,Undietaker,2011-09-01T01:23Z,MP4? how about AVI Please!!!!!
,billyboy999,2011-09-01T05:04Z,WTF is up with the sample???  The bad bits on the other versions were the night time parts where u couldn't see a thing..Give us a samp of a night time scene please.
,5amjr,2011-09-02T02:44Z,The fact theres no dark/indoor scenes shown in the sample or screens tells me its the same dark shit as the rest!
,shonuffx,2011-09-04T02:03Z,"so ungrateful... It's good enough, don't think so? Then have patience until it's released on dvd or go to a theater near you..."
,konkrete99,2011-09-04T14:32Z,It was released on DVD the 28th of Aug.  Do a little research before spreading misinformation.
,5amjr,2011-09-05T08:34Z,"@shonuffx don't be so quick to tongue an uploaders ass just because they add a file, in this case a torrent only 40% visible! twat"
,xantheus13,2011-09-05T21:33Z,@konkrete99 it most certainly was not released on DVD on August 28th. It doesnt even have a DVD/Blu Ray home release date yet. So maybe YOU should do some research before spreading misinformation!!!!
,LEERV,2011-09-06T02:53Z,"This is the same as the feel free version with the dark bits guys. I'd hang about a while.
Hey bonkrate - It was released on DVD on the planet TWAT. What a Cock you are."
,5amjr,2011-09-06T09:19Z,"Yeah there isn't even a date yet on amazon for release and can't even be pre-ordered!! 

That's Koncrete evidence! lol"
,muscle555,2011-09-13T15:14Z,"I find it hard to believe that this movie would be released on home video now when the movie has just recently been released in many countries and some countries are still waiting.  The theater release dates shown on IMDB show most countries are seeing it in theaters in August, September and a few in October.

Has anyone seen an official released to DVD anouncement?

See more at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409847/releaseinfo concerning theater release dates."
,5amjr,2011-09-19T14:09Z,It hasn't been released and wont be for months. Follow shonuffx's example if u want and stick ur tongue in the uploaders ass because he uploaded a piece of shit!
,asskicker555,2011-10-08T03:49Z,"@ xantheus13 right on bro... 
if it was released on dvd EXTREMEZONE the best of the best uploader would have it already!!!!!!"
,THESENUTS27,2011-10-17T02:16Z,"It was filmed using a CAM in a theatre. You can see silhouettes from some of the people there. Aside from that, the quality isn't too bad except for the dark night scenes. I rate it a ""6.5 to 7""."
