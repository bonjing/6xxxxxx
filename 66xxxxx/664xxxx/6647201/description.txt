Storyline: Some time after the events of Dawn of the Dead, zombies have overrun the world. A woman named Sara sits in a white room, featureless save for a calendar on the opposite wall. As she approaches it, hundreds of undead hands burst out and lunge for her before she wakes up in the seat of a helicopter, revealing the event as a nightmare. She and three other survivors, John, Bill and Miguel, land the chopper in deserted streets of Fort Myers, Florida to search for other possible survivors. They try to call people with a megaphone, but only attract hordes of undead. The group returns to their base, an underground army missile bunker near the Everglades
