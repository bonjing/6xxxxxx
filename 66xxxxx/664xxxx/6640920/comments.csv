,Revolver31,2011-08-30T22:42Z,sorry but again with reduced size on empire result of a lower bitrate on the vidio and dts audio.
[V],GoodFilms,2011-08-31T00:32Z,so what?
,jenchai,2011-08-31T00:42Z,"11.7 mbps reduced size ? For 1080p, for me anything over 6mb+ is good enough. Audio may not be 1500k, but 768k is good enough."
,jenchai,2011-08-31T00:47Z,Thanks BOZX !!!!
,Revolver31,2011-08-31T00:57Z,ok just pointing it out the 2 others are 1536k maybe empire was just overlooked when it was ripped just stating facts the quality is good no doubt bigger the better for me but ive preorderd the blu boxset anyways it was just strange to me that a new hope and jedi have been treated pretty much the same as in file size  and a/v bitrate but empire hasnt still a gr8 upload and still 2 weeks early.
,feenzee,2011-08-31T05:25Z,This is Special Edition. Otherwise great.
,moshster,2011-08-31T08:40Z,I'd be happy if they all used 768 DTS as any true fan ill own the BD boxset anyway for the highest quality :)

[T],zeromancer,2011-09-01T01:25Z,"@feenzee; Not shit, sherlock !!"
,Revolver31,2011-09-01T03:20Z,@zeromancer thx for your input while others actually comment on the torrent giving an opinion and thoughts you make clever remarks so your saying im wrong then a new hope and jedi both have around 13100kbps vidio bitrate and both have 1536k audio empire has 11700kbps (1400 less) and 768k (half) i was just pointing out that fact for others i think your smoking enough for both of us.

,User897,2011-09-06T04:14Z,"Since this is sourced from the Blu-ray, it is important to list the correct year for these films.

This is the 2011 version, NOT the 1977, 1980, or 1983 versions."

,QuantiumG,2011-09-13T18:45Z,"Thanks for the upload. Unfortunately, it's only running at 40-75Kb/s, so it'll probably take you like a week to finish the download. It'll be in stores before that. "
,reacharound,2011-09-14T13:38Z,"Thanks BOZX,
I cannot wait to watch them.
I was just curious as to why The empire strikes backs audio is 768k while the rest are 1536k.
thanks heaps."
,xcaliboy,2011-09-14T20:51Z,"Thank you BOZX....I wish more people would seed...this is gonna take FOREVER...not complaining, just stating a fact...so if you are downloading these, please SEED with more KB's...nearly been downloading for 24 hours and still less than 9%"
,bboy776531,2011-09-15T10:17Z,Man we need more seeding. This is gonna take like a week. 120 seeds to 2105 leeches thats terrible. SEEEEEEEEEEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 
,wtfjbl,2011-09-15T18:13Z,"hey, I'm upping at 500kbps and downloading at 25kbps...what's up with that people... seed it!"
,RichardSillyman,2011-09-15T20:13Z,"IÂ´ve heard so much raving about the tiny changes that George Lucas did to the BD films.  HeÂ´s just tinkering with his own creation & that is his right.  When SW 4 was released, he had given all film profit to Fox to keep all rights on the show paraphernalias, like software games, board games action characters, etc.  Now he has come back to control much more.  Not bad at all. 2 out of 367 seed connected after 1.5hrs.  Sharing is not a strong point.  If everyone would set their uploading limit to 0.8% the trading would be alot  faster to download."
,Yoduh,2011-09-15T20:57Z,"These rips don't include the new added scenes.  First thing I did after downloading was look for the new scene where Luke is making his green lightsaber in RotJ and it's not there.  I don't know if it's an additional feature you have to enable like a directors commentary, or if they're only viewable as bonus material separate from the films.  Either way I hope we get an upload of the bonus material soon."
,Yoduh,2011-09-15T21:05Z,"Oh, and wicket has new eyes but darth vaders lightsaber in the ESB duel with luke is still pink.  Unbelievable."
,mosmooth,2011-09-15T23:57Z,"53 seconds of changes-and a pink light sabre-is making you so upset?

You should leave that bedroom you've spent the last many years in and...GET A LIFE!"
,Yoduh,2011-09-16T06:47Z,"oh mosmooth you know me so well.  how about instead of trying to start internet flame wars you spend time learning what the fuck you're talking about.  53 seconds of changes while understandable since it is george lucas and he will always change star wars with every re-release, still gives no excuse for not fixing a color problem that's been present in the film since 2004.  i'm not complaining about the content of the film, i'm complaining about its shitty production quality.  as an $80 product lucasfilm expects me to buy, i have the right to criticize it in that way do i not?  talk about needing to get a life..."
