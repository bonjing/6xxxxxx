,ScubaSteve5678,2011-09-02T15:45Z,"Awesome thank you HR so much.  Any chances of hoodwinked too, and cars 2 if not no problem just curious if you are planing on putting those up 
thanks for all the great work "
[V],HolyRoses,2011-09-02T15:50Z,"hmm, maybe, those titles seemed weak to me.  hookwinked 1 was great though.

anyhow, make sure you turn on the forced subs when you watch this movie.

-HR"
,ScubaSteve5678,2011-09-02T16:10Z,Perfect thanks if you can great if not no problem I just know the kids would love those movies as the first hoodwinked and cars we pretty good movies hopefully the sequels are equally as good 
,rK225,2011-09-02T16:23Z,what about THOR...waiting for that ...HR..THANK 4 X-MEN..:)
,Hile_Hoe,2011-09-02T23:20Z,"thanks for the great job, as always.
any chance that you'll be doin' some handheld torrents soon, I prefer their compactness.
anyway, keep on going for all of us"
,xenoFLASH,2011-09-03T00:34Z,Why not hardcode the non-english parts?
,swatkat,2011-09-03T16:00Z,what do u mean by audio 1 and audio 2??????????? why not simply give a single track???
,swatkat,2011-09-03T16:00Z,screens arent working.........
[V],HolyRoses,2011-09-03T17:18Z,its designed this way for a specific reason.  the screens do work.  everything you see is on purpose.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-09-04T00:46Z,"hmm, there is an error with one of the forced subtitles.

Dispatch the fleet! is displayed for 10 minutes.  its supposed to be displayed for 1.5 seconds. turn subs off for 10 min if you like."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-09-04T01:27Z,"Comrades, thank you for your service. is displayed also for 3 minutes.

sector7 goofed somehow."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-09-04T01:34Z,"oh well, if someone wants to hex edit the .m4v and provide a ppf or something, i'd appreciate it.  take the appropriate time stamps from the sdh subs."
,torrentking64,2011-09-04T02:23Z,when you doing transformers 3 dude? by the way your work is awesome.
,Metagrossabra,2011-09-04T04:48Z,"Great upload, HR. Splendid work."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-09-04T16:18Z,"yes,  you can remux it.  problem is with the forced sub file.  Just those 2 lines.  SECTOR7 somehow goofed and no way I would realize unless I watched the whole film which I finally did.  You can open the 2 subtitles with aegisub and notice what I am talking about."
,Hile_Hoe,2011-09-04T20:53Z,"question from an a/v noob,
how do you edit these (quite large) in such a way that it actualy decreases in size to a (quite small) handheld m4v format?
I saw that the terms 'hex editing' and 'ppf' were used, but how does it work alltogether?"
,__ratatat__,2011-09-05T10:12Z,awesome thanks you should try and get the big lebouski
,badteam,2011-09-05T14:43Z,"Awesome Upload once again....

Can you upload Jumping the Broom?"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-09-06T15:38Z,"I might repack this with fixed subs.  Notice I have the source files still untouched on computer.  It so minor though, but I don't like bugged releases."
,Hile_Hoe,2011-09-06T21:34Z,"Thanks HR, but could you please also upload a smaller version for handheld devices, or else please explain how to create such a file"
,udfutaka,2011-09-07T05:38Z,i should have waited for your upload....nevertheless i will it watch again...awesome quality!
,xenoFLASH,2011-09-07T11:13Z,Could you hardcode the non-english parts if you decide to release a fixed subbed version?
[V],HolyRoses,2011-09-08T00:44Z,"get REPACK
