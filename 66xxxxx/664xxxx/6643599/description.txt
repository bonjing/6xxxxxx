Here is a greatest performance of Vivaldi's Four Seasons by 
Ms. Anne-Sophie Mutter  - 192k bitrate

Enjoy it in your library along with Sir Neville Marriner's rendition
or I Musici as may be your true preference too in addition to this.

In any event, dont miss out on the more gentle moments at times
of what is a true feminine touch brough to this great work in lovliest 
fashion indeed.

Includes a nice 10MB mp4 glimpse of Ms. Anne-Sophie Mutter for your ipod
or what have you - view on your computer - its a lovely concert clip
of her doing the first part of The Winter segment of The Four Seasons
and is not to be missed!
