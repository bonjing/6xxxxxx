Follow the meteoric rise, the equally meteoric fall, and the decidedly un-meteor-like second coming of the most important band Hank Venture, Dermott Fictel and H.E.L.P.eR. robot have ever been in: Shallow Gravy. If youâ€™re hungry for rock, then open wide, because here comes a ladle of heavy metal fire and metaphoric meat drippings. 



I uploaded this .avi file version because there was no other options out there. Just .rar files or nothing.

sorry sceneline and sceneline fans, but most people don't want rars. it has nothing to do with not knowing how to use them.


enjoy people.
