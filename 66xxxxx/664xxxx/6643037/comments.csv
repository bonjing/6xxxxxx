,marieann,2011-08-31T23:08Z,Thank you so much
,Fuzi0719,2011-08-31T23:23Z,"Thank you, hope this will start seeding faster, it is like molasses on an icecube."
,Fangular,2011-09-01T10:51Z,A million thank you's from me too.
,BMF60,2011-09-01T14:38Z,This is taking such a long time to download - seems to be no one seeding.
,Fangular,2011-09-01T17:54Z,I can't get a single seed for either this or Top Model.. :-(
,paramount71,2011-09-01T18:29Z,why does it take so long for loding?
,Fangular,2011-09-01T19:16Z,"I'm not sure about the technicalities of it - all I know is that now neither this or Oz Top Model are downloading *at all* any more - ETA is âˆž. And I've been downloading this torrent (or trying to) for over 7 and a half hours now. 

I wildly appreciate you, UglyDucklingxyz, for uploading these shows - seriously, thank you - it's so cool of you to do it. And there's never been a problem like this before with your past uploads.. but it's extremely frustrating now. Has anyone at all succeeded in downloading the whole episode yet? Of this or Top Model?"
,Fangular,2011-09-01T19:27Z,"ETA: ∞ 

At this rate, I will literally be dead before this episode is finished downloading!"
,UglyDucklingxyz,2011-09-01T19:54Z,"Unfortunately, I'm on a sluggish internet connection at the moment (the upload is abysmal), so that's why. I'm using the ""initial seeding"" option which is supposed to help spread all the pieces around faster, or at least it did for last week's episode. Perhaps not everyone is seeding the pieces they received? "
