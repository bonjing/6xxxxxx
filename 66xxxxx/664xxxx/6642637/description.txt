The Four Seasons by Italy's Antonio Vivaldi has always been a greatest
favorite of my classical choices. Perhaps even the best - although I have
some Bach Chopin and Beethoven pieces that are equally on the same list.

I have always best liked the renditions by the Italian group I. Musici - 
often found on the Philips Label (Holland). We are be posting that for 
you too - both in video (already posted) and mp3 formats.

For this particular torrent, we offer the renowned performance by
Violinist Alan Loveday Conducted by Sir Neville Marriner
Academy of St. Martin,in the fields. I liked this just as much when I listened
to the final movement (Winter) as it is the most beautiful of classical pieces
and is just as well done here as by anyone else I'm aware of! Great stuff!


For those who like this work so much that they wouldn't
want to miss out on hearing different renditions that are in the main
most popular, help yourselves here too certainly!
