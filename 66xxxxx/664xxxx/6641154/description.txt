The Four Seasons by Italy's Antonio Vivaldi has always been a greatest
favorite of my classical choices. Perhaps even the best - although I have
some Bach Chopin and Beethoven pieces that are equally on the same list.

I have always best liked the renditions by the Italian group I. Musici - 
often found on the Philips Label (Holland). We are be posting their performance
of this great work for you in this video and will have for you as well the mp3
offering too. They seem always supremely competent with whatever material
they bring to us in the Classical genre.
