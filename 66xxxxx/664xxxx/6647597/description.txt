The goal of Tunnel Blaster is simple: Stay alive as long as possible and 
rack up as many points as possible. Digster X is a miner that tunnels through 
potential mining sites of the subterrainean underworld ridding the area of 
aliens and monsters. The Hero, Digster X has a single weapon - a Grappling Pump. 
The grappling pump fires a projectile that injects creatures with compressed air 
on impact. If you fire enough of the grappling-pump projectiles into a creature, 
the creature will explode!

However, the creatures of the game aren't just going to sit around and let 
you do this.
