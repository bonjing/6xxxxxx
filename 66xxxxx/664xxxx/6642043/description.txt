  Developed by Ubisoft Reflections under the direction of the creators of the 
  original title, DRIVER San Francisco marks the return of the established 
  video game series that has sold 14 million copies worldwide. Gamers will 
  play as Detective John Tanner on a relentless manhunt for crime lord 
  Charles Jericho through the hills of the City by the Bay. Thanks to a 
  groundbreaking gameplay feature, players can now seamlessly Ã´shiftÃ¶ between 
  well over a hundred licensed vehicles, keeping them constantly in the heart 
  of the action. With its timeless setting, unique car handling and renewed 
  playability, DRIVER San Francisco will revitalize the classic free-roaming, 
  cinematic car chase experience for the current generation of gaming 
  platforms.
