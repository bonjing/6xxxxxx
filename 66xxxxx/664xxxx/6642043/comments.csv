,steve30x,2011-08-31T12:56Z,@ dsfboss : The pc version was delayed by three weeks.
,twojastara,2011-08-31T13:47Z,"fish91, a noob you say? a noob doesn't use thepiratebay (or any other torrent site for that matter) to acquire Xbox games. :) and you also have to take under consideration that it's a problem for most of the people here to even burn a game, not to mention turning your Xbox into a jtagged one and playing like that :)"
,dodge112,2011-08-31T14:59Z,"@twojastara Cause using trackers is so hard lol seriously u sir are a noob now stfu gtfo kthxbye, nice upload Masi50 Cheers."

,jamesmal,2011-08-31T22:15Z,"Can someone explain in simple terms what a jtag can do and if it's possible to play online with one? Yes I'm what you might call a noob but I do burn games to play on my offline console,but I'm interested in maybe getting it jtagged and would like some simple specifications for it"
,Ltodemax,2011-09-01T00:13Z,">mfw 2 seeders 215 leechers

enjoy your download speed 360 fags"
,brstarks,2011-09-01T03:12Z,you probably cant jtag your console. becuase you have to be on a early dashboard. like pre nxe... if you find one on a lod dash you can jtag that one.
,jamesmal,2011-09-01T04:31Z,@brstarks ... Cheers thanks I'll not be able to do it then ...no worries I'll just wait for LT 2.0 with hopefully new burning instructions 
,fish91,2011-09-01T07:51Z,"Everyone can jtag now, slim and fat, just google ""reset glitch jtag hack"" thanks to GliGli a french dude:-)"

,DJArcher,2011-09-01T21:00Z,"I have downloaded the game and have unzipped the files but now I have a folder which says ""5553087E"" and then a folder which says ""00007000"" and there are all sorts of data files. Normally I only get a zip file and an imgburn file. Can someone tell me what to do to burn this on a disc? I am not familiar with JTAG..

Thanks a lot!"

,RKangeL,2011-09-01T22:36Z,A friend of mine told that you need to take off the LT run the actualization and charge the flash it again. Will be truth???
,HawkguyTK,2011-09-01T23:55Z,fish91 is right about every console having the ability to JTAG now. The hack was just released less than a week ago. This is a hardware hack so Microsoft can't do a simple update to block this. The only way they can block it is to change the xbox design. This means any xbox's currently owned or in the stores has the ability to be JTAGd. The scene is hard at work simplifying this for all of us. 
,brstarks,2011-09-02T02:54Z,wow.
,sambospengler,2011-09-03T20:15Z,why cant someone just uploads the rip of this game save messing around with Jtag my console still works fine after new update still plays all games online after the XGD3 update i have hatachi 59 dirve
,Kevininu,2011-09-04T14:03Z,"What does jtag mean?
Does it mean it reades fake games or what?"
,theclarkster,2011-09-06T00:18Z,have you got a non jtag driver available mate?
,blingboy,2011-09-08T12:09Z,HAS ANYONE GOT THIS GAME SO I CAN PLAY ON A NORMAL XBOX NOT A JTAG 
,krljo,2011-09-11T15:39Z,speeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,azuziel,2011-09-11T17:23Z,"Non_jtag users...your days are numbered. XG3 format is not rippable. period. all new releases, are XG3. So, forget hcaked firmware, and go take advantage of the new exploit on ALL xboxes. Details at XB-S. There is now no reason that everyone cant play games from hard drive. Forgert burning discs. New hack, gives ability for hard drive launch from any model/drive. no more caosters laying around, really is for thebest anyway. So stop reading my comment, and go google the new 360 hard drive hack (xbox-scene has deets). enjoy."

The Xbox 360 reset glitch hack - New Homebrew Hack!

>> GliGli released a new hack to boot the Xbox360 into XeLL and thus run homebrew software on your console. It's is compatible with ALL dashboard version and ALL Slim and Fat (expect Xenon, Falcon support will follow later) models and is unpatchable via software updates by Microsoft.
