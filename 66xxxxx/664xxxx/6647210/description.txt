Please Note: Crappy vhs equals intermittent brief distortion flickers in spots courtesy of my vid card, not too too bad. Additionally, the picture clarity is fairly poor, faces at distance are blurs. Other that that ; ) Not too bad, very watchable, increased bitrate, complete.

For the fan who has never seen it.
