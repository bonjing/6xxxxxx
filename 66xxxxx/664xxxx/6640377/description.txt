The Light that Dwells in Rotten Wood is simply a beautiful album, there are no two ways about it. Its pacing is flawless and its length is just right at a tidy 44 minutes. The vocals are intense wails and shrieks that fit wonderfully, and remain that way throughout despite their one whispering variance.
