The project of Ithaca, New Yorks Alec Koone, Balam Acab - named after a Mayan demigod who created rainbows by piercing clouds with arrows - began as an experimental noise project while he was still a Pennsylvania high-school student. He resuscitated the name a few years later as a music student at Ithaca College, incorporating dubstep, U.K. bass, and RnB elements into his atmospheric sounds, drawing comparisons to Grouper as well as house artists such as Salem and White Ring. Koone's debut album, Wander/Wonder, arrived in September 2011.
