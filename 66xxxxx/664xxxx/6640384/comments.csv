 -------------------------------------------------- -----------------------
 Once the package AP22 will not boot? Opportunity to lay out a locomotive Klass67 ? ="
,RailGamer,2011-08-30T19:36Z,@Rangler it seems to work for me. all i can suggest is re-install it. If your using a legal copy of RailWorks this seems to prevent some addons from working also check that you have the latest version of 117.3a of RailWorks 2
,Rangler,2011-08-30T19:58Z,"A copy of the ""crack"" all addons work except AP22.
 v.117 ="
,tpb_4_ever,2011-08-30T20:11Z,@RailGamer I downloaded your v117.3a update and when i try to play game it crashes. I have 114.0b. Any help would be useful thanks.

,RailGamer,2011-08-30T21:35Z,@Rangler you need to upgrade to 116.5a found in this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6311446/Railworks_Add-ons_2011_-_Part_2
,Thootjeajax,2011-08-30T21:54Z,"@tpb_4_ever 
1. Go to your railworks folder
2. Right click on ""RailworksProc2.exe""
3. Go to properties
4. Select Compatibility
5. Make sure the box around ""Windows xp (service pack 2) is ticked.
This worked for me!"

,davejames777,2011-09-01T15:13Z,"Thanks the download worked but when I start a scenario the textures in the station such as the platforms and bridges ceiling etc are invisible. When I'm in the world editor I can see the surroundings that are supposed to be there but not while driving. Any help would be appreciated, thanks. :)"
,davejames777,2011-09-01T17:10Z,"apologies, I have discovered that I had the scenery slider on a too low number which is why the station didnt show up. Works great now thanks :)"

Thank you!"
,analjuggern4ut,2011-09-07T19:14Z,"@pop72: RailGamer's uploads are mostly proper .rwp files, which you can install and uninstall using the package manager in RailWorks user interface. Because of that, the addons can also be removed if necessary. This is much more user friendly than most of the other uploads which need to be manually copied into \Railworks folder. Kudos to him!"
,Gelith,2011-09-26T15:44Z,Lol.. Why is my train decoupling from the carriages sometime? :( Lol.. I should read about this one..
