,SP3FFC,2012-01-19T22:06Z,"Awesome share, thank youuu!! @kacsok1 you probably just need good codec pack and player try using K-Lite codec pack and vlc or try CCCP codec pack. Episodes 3, 4, 16, 18,19 and 25.5 are in 720p instead of 480p like the other ones, so that might be causing the problem on your case"
