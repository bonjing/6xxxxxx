Install the program found in the root folder. When you have done that, boot the program found in the crack folder. Ta dah, it's done."

,steliso151,2011-12-25T07:52Z,"Hello oldskoolscouse, I do all the steps correctly but it doesn't work for me. The steps:
1:I install VDJ and do NOT run it.
2:I copy the file in the Crack folder
3:I paste it and remove the old one from c:/Program Files/VirtualDJ.
It works..but it's not pro version, i must log in..when i put a song it says i can only play it for 30 seconds lol Help please"
,steliso151,2011-12-25T07:55Z,Registered to Cracked By AceCrack..Version 7.5.0 Pro But...It doesn't really work as the pro version
[V],oldskoolscouse,2012-01-07T20:12Z,"@steliso151, you need to block it accessing the internet, you can do this from your firewall anf if your using a 3rd party firewall you must block it there aswell."
,maxswtw809,2012-04-18T23:25Z,How do I download? Lol
,Psythik,2012-05-01T07:09Z,"Can someone PLEASE upload an updated version of the VDJ Registry Tool already?  I can only find an old version that doesn't have the video memory tweak; I need ver 4.0.5. 

Manually editing the registry values doesn't work; you need the tool! Thank you!"
