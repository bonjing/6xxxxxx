A little while ago, I was teaching a workshop on advanced SketchUp techniques to a group of extremely bright middle and high school (or so I thought) students in Hot Springs, Arkansas. As subject matter went, I wasnâ€™t pulling any punches â€” we were breezing through material I wouldnâ€™t think of introducing to most groups of adults. At one point, a boy raised his hand to
ask a question, and I noticed he looked younger than most of the others. Squinting, I read a logo on his T-shirt that told me he was in elementary school. â€œYouâ€™re in sixth grade?â€ I asked, a little stunned. These kids were motoring, after all. The boy didnâ€™t even look up. He shook his head, doubleclicked something, and mumbled, â€œThird.â€ He was 8 years old.

SketchUp was invented back in 1999 by a couple of 3D industry veterans (or refugees, depending on your perspective) to make it easier for people to see their ideas in three dimensions. That was it, really â€” they just wanted to make a piece of software that anyone could use to build 3D models. What I saw in Arkansas makes me think they were successful.

Before it was acquired in 2006 by Google, SketchUp cost $495 a copy, and it was already a mainstay of architectsâ€™ and other designersâ€™ software toolkits. No other 3D modeler was as easy to understand as SketchUp, meaning that even senior folks (many of whom thought their CD/DVD trays were cup holders) started picking it up. These days, SketchUp is being used at home, in school, and at work by anyone with a need to represent 3D information the way itâ€™s meant to be represented: in 3D. Google SketchUp (as itâ€™s now called) is available as a free download in six languages, and is just as popular internationally as it is in North America.
