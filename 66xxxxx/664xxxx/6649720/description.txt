Crashing the Lines 1 of 3 - iPod

DVD Rip to iPod

Producer: Christopher J. Petrilli

Trained in the Philippines by Filipino legend Grandmaster Ciriaco "Cacoy" Canete himself, 8th degree black belt Christopher Petrilli has distilled his knowledge of Japanese aikido, Indonesian silat and Filipino Doce Pares eskrima into an elevated system of stick fighting that goes far beyond anything previously captured on video.

In Volume 1 of this unprecedented Paladin video series, Master Petrilli teaches you how to move from largo mano range instantly to the close-in fighting that characterizes Doce Pares eskrima. From there, he goes into sinawali patterns that show you how to strike and soften up your opponent, drawing him into the locking and throwing lines that will finish him off.

Show someone you love them, hit'em with a stick!
