[DESCRIPTION.]:
Presenter Paul Martin and his team travel up and down the
nation looking for undiscovered treasures and forgotten
places that tell us about Britain's rich and astonishing history.
In this programme, Paul visits one of the country's greatest
stately homes, Dumfries House in Ayrshire. There he meets
HRH Prince Charles, who helped save the house for the
nation.
Also on the show, reporter Charlie Luxton uncovers an
industrial time capsule in the form of a 19th century
Birmingham silversmiths; Clare Balding travels to Essex to
learn more about the discovery of a rare Victorian culinary
manuscript; and guest reporter John Sergeant takes to the
skies in search of the last remaining Avro Vulcan bomber, an
icon of the cold war.
