,zephyrus28,2011-09-18T06:50Z,"I have purchased the Sims Medieval, and it is installed on the computer. If I download this, will this expansion pack work with my game, or do I need to download Sims Medieval in the description for it to work?"
,zephyrus28,2011-09-18T07:57Z,"Actually don't worry, I have installed it and it runs fine, it just asks me for the disk, and now I don't know what to do, leaving me unable to play. -__-

help?"
,Banzay27,2011-09-19T18:10Z,"Heh... wouldn't be a true The Sims without expansion packs. I think it's the one case in gaming where I'd rather see DLCs in the place of expansion packs, simply because these supposed expansions bear the content of mere DLCs. Being expansions is just a way to rip off more bucks off every purchase, even if the expansions are cheaper than most they'll still more than most DLCs.
Hell... there's a Mass Effect 2 DLC that has at least ten times more content than any The Sims expansion. Ridiculous."
,zephyrus28,2011-09-28T07:08Z,"Realised that when I downloaded it before, I put the wrong files in the wrong thing.

this time it worked.
Great game. :) thanks"
,ReBeLi0uS1,2011-09-29T20:28Z,"Right on!!! Works perfectly!! Thanks! Just a side note, I have always left the auto update box checked on my game and it has always updated without any problems! The iso image is always mounted when i play, so not sure if that has anything to do with it. But never had to use any update cracks! :) Thanks again!"
,antheamvh,2011-10-13T21:50Z,"Hey guys
Has anyone else been unable to start the game due to a "" service initialization failed (0x039e8474)"" error? I used the crack provided, saved it to the Game/bin folder of medieval as instructed, and have also tried reinstalling the game, but to no avail. Haven't found any solutions on the net yet.
Suggestions anyone?"

,Spiro88,2012-05-25T11:45Z,"NEVERmind thanks for the comment
If you can't play because the game asks for the CD after loading, it's problably because you placed the crack in the wrong folder. It's supposed to go in the ""The Sims Medieval/Game/Bin"" folder, not on the ""The Sims Medieval Pirate and Nobles/Game/Bin""
