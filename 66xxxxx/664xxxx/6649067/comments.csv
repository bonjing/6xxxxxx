,indiaman,2011-09-04T05:34Z,Thanks for this edition of Moran.Excellent.Your engineering books are great.
,fatetard,2011-09-08T12:01Z,"dynstab2, 

I *am* exceptionally greatful for this upload of yours.  As well as all the other mechanical engineering material that you have posted.  I cannot emphasize this enough.  

Would you happen to have the 6th editon of this book?  I have found a few scanned copies.  But I've been looking for the 6th edition vector text, pdf.  

I only ask because I have spent so much time (thermo courses, and tech elects) working out of my 6th edition hardcopy."
[T],dynstab2,2011-09-09T14:06Z,@fatetard  All I have in native PDF is the 5th and 7th. 6th: My own personal print copy (the one with the white cover). I too wish I could find a nice PDF copy. I just found a digital copy but didn't download it. At 125 MB my guess is this must either be a broken copy or a scan. :-(
,hammer2fall,2011-09-27T21:56Z,Do you by any chance have the solutions manual?
,andromeda666,2011-11-08T09:03Z,"Thanks a lot for the upload.
Do you happen to have the textbook ""Mechanics and Thermodynamics of Propulsion""? Could you please, upload that if you have it?

Thanx"
,ej007,2012-02-05T05:13Z,"Thank you very much!!!!!!!!!!! Greeaaat upload!! :D ...btw I really really need the solution manual for this one, do you happen to have it or you know where I can find it? I appreciate it :)"
,ut1880h,2012-04-29T16:28Z,"The file that is downloaded is ""Moran_Shapiro_Fundamentals_Engineering_Thermodynamics_7th_txtbk.7z"" - which has no file extension. It isn't a PDF or any other viewable document format. So, how the hell have the other downloaders view this textbook???"
,ut1880h,2012-04-29T16:38Z,Disregard my last comment. I recently reloaded my pc and hadn't installed Winrar yet.
