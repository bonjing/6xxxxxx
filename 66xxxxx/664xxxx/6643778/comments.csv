no comments. . . say whatever you want to say. I'm not forcing anyone to download my files. I welcome ur comments. I dont want to argue. I'm not uploading the same file. This is my version of the movie. If you dont want it, fine. At least you're taking time to accuse me for uploading. .

I've a skull coz I'm a trusted uploader, I dont upload fake torrents. Anyone can talk. . but I UPLOAD.

I'm trying my best to help our friends, they know it. I'm happy for that, and I'm not going to restrain from uploading 'same movies'. 

thx for the comment friend.

,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-09-01T18:54Z,where is the logic in uploading replicas? its like there are 10000 copies of a book in a store and what ur doing is putting another copy of the same book on the shelf. does that fucking make sense to u? why cant u think for a second and come up with a book which is not there in the store at all? can u honestly tell me what you've been doin wid pirates and now x-men is logical?

[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-09-01T20:44Z,"@ fearloathingandparanoia
Asher_jk has a point. I'm having a troubled internet connection, no more seedbox support. I'm seeding @ 50kbps :( That's the reason for delayed uploads. Also I edit the sources. Correct the color & sharpness for better viewing pleasure. I'm not belittling others' efforts, but my versions have better video when compared to my fellow encoders. No offence bros. 
They can do the same if they edit the source file. They know it. I try to improve the video quality. I like it that way. So it takes time. If people are okay with prior releases, why am I getting good responses ??
I respect ur suggestions, though they're a bit rude. lol

logically you might be right my friend. But who doesn't want to place their 'book' among the renowned books ? 

@ skillet
As you know (my internet) Unable to do this again in 480p. Sorry my friend, hope you understand :)

I use MeGUI to encode.

@fearloathingandparanoia
My internet conn is not good now. If I upload a Asian/foreign movie now, it'll take longer to start downloading by anyone. I've only 6 hours to seed. I've to finish seeding within that. If someone starts downloading after 3rd hour, it's hard for them to complete downloading. So I'm forced to skip them. 
And my friends love my encodes like you. I'm grateful for that. 
All of you make sense. pls wait for my internet to fix. I'll do more & more movies.

I request the same for all the request. Give some time friends. thx all :)"

I just want to chime in on this discussion.
I think your 480p rips are great. They compare to every other small sized 480p Ive Dled.

Your 720p rips on the other hand I was not impressed with. I just dont think its fair to say.
""I'm not belittling others' efforts, but my versions have better video when compared to my fellow encoders."" I dont think any one has earned the best small sized 720p badge yet.

My reason is because of your ""Fast Five' and ""Limitless"" rips. I got both of them and felt I needed to re-download both. I ended up going with Yify on them and compared yours to his before I deleted. I actually had scOrps Fast five also and Yify topped all in quality.

Im going to DL this and compare it to Yify and scOrp. I will give you an honest answer on which is best imo.  I think your doing a great job and with more practice you may be the best soon. At least I hope so lol, then Ill always know where to go."

,Treehuger,2011-09-04T03:26Z,"So I got scOrps, Yifys, and your rip of this movie. 

The best of the three in quality was scOrp. You were better than Yify this time, actually quite a bit better and 50mb smaller too. As far as scorp goes, it was only better because it was over 100mb bigger. It was barely better at that.

In the end I am going to keep your rip of this because it was the best for the size.

You really did step it up since I last got a 720p from you. Great job on the encode bro. You will be a permanent contender for my 720p Dls from now on. Keep at it and I could see you getting good enough to be the best. really it seems like yify is getting a little lazy on quality in the past few weeks and I have to Dl scorps from hot links most of the time.

after u install it, just follow the instructions on how to transfer movies to ur idevice thru file sharing using itunes.

700mb was a norm so that 6 movies could come on a DVD. Now dvds are cheaper than ever before So an extra 100-20Mb upto 1GB for a movie would be acceptable. Just a thought.

Question: Why mess with the quality of the source video at all? If the source video is from the Bluray then isnt the video quality already at its desired level intended by the filmmakers? 

This was one of the many points for bringing widescreen format to home entertainment, to display the movie as intended by the filmmakers.

Just seems pointless to change the visual of the movie into your liking instead of the way it was meant to be seen. IMHO thats like taking the movie Dark City and saying to yourself ""ya know this movie could be brighter, would bring out a lot of details in the background."" Just sounds idiotic. 

Lastly this has nothing to do with the fact you uploaded multiple copies i could careless about that."
