Please Note: This is a re-do of the previous Block Busters torrent. This copy is vastly superior, there are distortion flickers for a few tics in the first minute and after that it is good except for a couple of brief glitches which are in the source. I also made it a tad darker and increased the bitrate for a better picture.

"It seems like the one constant in life through all the years has been baseball, Americaâ€™s National Pastime. America has rolled by like an army of steamrollers. It has been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt and erased again. And through all this, baseball has stood the test of time. This field â€“ This game â€“ Itâ€™s a part of our past. It reminds us of all that once was good and could be again. " James Earl Jones in Field of Dreams.
