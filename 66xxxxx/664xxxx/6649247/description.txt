Estobuntu is a remastered Ubuntu ISO image that uses Estonian by default where ever possible, and includes media codecs, Flash and Java. Plugins/addons are added to Firefox for supporting Estonian ID card and blocking advertisements on Estonian web. Special Estonian spell checker is added to LibreOffice and in multimedia applications various default Estonian content is added (links, radios, banks etc). By default Estobuntu also features clipboard manager and some locally meaningful desktop widgets.
Distribution is meant for average Estonian user without much knowledge about computers.
Our mission is to provide for Estonian people an easy and useful operating system based on free software. We commit as much as possible upstream and work together on the bugs.
