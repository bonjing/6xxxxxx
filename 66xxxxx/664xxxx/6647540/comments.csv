,monkeyboyjenkins,2011-09-04T05:51Z,Downloaded...tried to play two different movies (that did play with VLC) but the program froze...system msg stated that the display driver failed to work.  I restarted my computer three times but could not get it to work.  I did install the included updates.  I am going to remove and try a different torrent.  Thank you for taking the time to rip and post though.
,monkeyboyjenkins,2011-09-04T08:49Z,Okay...I tried a different torrent and had the same issue.  I had to upgrade my NVIDIA driver from GEForce to nForce.  That did the trick.
