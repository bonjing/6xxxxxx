All 3 sets from the Sims 3 Store for September 2011 in .package form. 

Drop them in your Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 3/Mods/Packages folder.

If you have never used .packages files before, you need a resource.cfg file. In which case, google it.

If you already have store content, everything should run fine.
