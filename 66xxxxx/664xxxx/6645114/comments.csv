,Rinadasler,2011-09-02T21:41Z,why its a *.package not a *.sims3pack??
,Sivos,2011-09-12T07:02Z,"@Rinadasler Because it's easier to install that way.  The pack sometimes has glitches to where it doesn't install, the .package, all you have to do is pop it in one little folder and you're done.  All it does is treat it like a mod.  Don't complain, you just got them for free."
