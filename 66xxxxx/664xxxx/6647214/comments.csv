,ZtorkX86,2011-09-05T21:32Z,I'm only going to continue seed for a while longer. If there's no more seeders then tough nuggets but I expected that at least one or two people would be willing to share their internet connection so other could download and spread the game but obviously it doesn't work on a public tracker with no leeching rules.
,DontPissMeOff,2011-09-08T12:02Z,"And what do you expect?
There's no info about the game, no screenshot and when I find a gameplay on YT
it turns out it's OLD. I'm not even interested in downloading this game."
