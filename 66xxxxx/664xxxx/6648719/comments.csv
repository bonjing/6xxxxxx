Thanx"
,kakajeet,2011-09-05T19:03Z,"To all who cant save the game, here's the solution. 
download this crack- http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6647686/Call_Of_Juarez_The_Cartel_-_Crack_Only_SKIDROW.
Then copy all it contents in the main game folder.
Then copy orbit folder files(in the downloaded crack) to C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher(by default).
then launch the game via the launcher(the one you copied to main game folder).
Wait for at least 45 sec to 1 min , the game will run and you will be able to save games.
IF IT DOESNOT RUN THE FIRST TIME, TRY IT(JUST DOUBLE CLICKING THE LAUNCHER.EXE) 3-4 times, THE GAME MUST RUN.
I AM PLAYING IT AND I AM ON CHAPTER 3. ITS A NOT BAD NOT GOOD GAME(JUST TIME PASS)."

,santoshpraveen,2011-09-08T10:59Z,"people... you need to play the whole chapter to have your game saved!!!
