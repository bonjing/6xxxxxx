Hi this Version of Lion Can Be Installed on Any Computers Without Trouble
Instructions are Included in The Torrent Just Burn The ISO Image Included in The Torrent to a Blank DVD (4.7 GB - The Common DVD in The Market) 

Edit BIOS Settings
Set SATA as AHCI Mode 
Turnoff "Processor Power Management"
It is Better to Remove All Other Hard Disks Presented in Your Computer
{IF Your DVD Rom Hangs During Installation Your DVD Drive isn't Getting Enogh Power So Change The Power Cable and USE Separate Power Cables for "DVD ROM and HDDs" }

Boot From The DVD Install Using The Instructions Given on Installer ......
Then Again Boot Using The Same DVD in The Boot Loader Select The Partition in Where You Installed "Lion" 
After Booting From it Install The "ChameleonInstaller.pkg"
(Read The Instructions Included in The Torrent Completely)

My Last Torrent Upload Had Kext Error
Do not Download the Torrent Which Got Hash "A4CAC2D8 FBEFD48A 446BB194 94F31D98 FE5840CB " IT WONT WORK FOR SURE

Users With Intel Processors Will Face No Trouble Lion Requires 64 bit Support but It Can Load 32 bit too
I am Not Sure That AMD and ATOM Users can Able to Boot From it Any How Give it a Try Because as Soon As Patched Kernels Available for AMD and ATOM i Will Release PreBoot CDS for the Users So You Can Use That CD to Boot This ISO on Your PC

HP Laptop Users Please Read The Instruction Give in The Torrent

There is Also an Instruction Included in the Torrent to "Make Chameleon Bootable Flash Drive (Pen Drive)" I Figured This Way for Current Mac OS X Users only
[ Windows Users Currently Have an Option of Installing From DVD only  ]

This DVD Also Can Be Used in Macintosh Computers to Install Lion 
And Also This is The Only Lion Version That Allows You To Customize

Please Seed as Long as You Can
AFTER Download and Don't Forgot to Add Comments After Installation
