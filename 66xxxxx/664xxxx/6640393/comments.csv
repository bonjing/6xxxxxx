,doink069,2011-09-03T15:25Z,"This package = FAIL

Unless you really want to install Lion without the apple included apps like Mail and iTunes this package does nothing that others, and it makes it WAY more complicated.

It DOESN'T install on Atom, AMD or Intel P6xxx machines. If you're interested in building a Hackintosh running Lion than do yourself a favor. Just grab a copy of the Lion App and MyHack. You'll easily end up with a running Lion based Mac on any machine this freaking mess would possibly install on. 

The only thing this package does is bring together some readily available unique utilities all in to one package. 

PASS on this."

I boot Macbook Pro 15"" with the key and installed, all fine and dandy except the hard drive wouldn't boot and all I could boot into was the usb key. I did everything possible from disk program, permissions checked and repaired it (at the end of repair it said it fixed bootloader if it was found necessary.. also info on the disk listed is as bootable disk. But the disk never showed up in Startup disk panel, only in that disk program, forgot its name right now. 
Booting without usb key I would get a folder with question mark meaning there is no boot disk.

I have burnt the ISO on to a TDK DVD-R 4.7 Gb disk from my Samsung SF510-S55 laptop. I have tweaked the BIOS as Niresh said and when I try to boot from the CD, it kicks me back and boot me into my Windows 7. I would appreciate it if someone can help me. Thanks :)

My specs:
Intel Core i5 M460 CPU
nVidia 310M GPU
TSSTcorp CDDVDW TS-U633J ATA Optical Drive"
