,bryentheartist,2011-09-02T07:21Z,just watched sample is this supposed to be blurry and fuzzy or is it copied in LQ?
,golfpro,2011-09-02T09:23Z,Agreed. Sample looks very poor. 
,jjjxx,2011-09-02T09:57Z,"
Why would you download even a decent versio of a Malick movie? His movies change peoples lives, I would wait at least 264 dvdrip lol"
,mark1990,2011-09-02T17:47Z,been waiting months for this..dvd not released until november so this will do for now..thanks
,LAZIO88BG,2011-09-02T18:32Z,"Sample is awful... Will wait more...
This is probably worth waiting movie..."
,lilicca,2011-09-03T02:01Z,"Well, the movie is not complete, is it???
Just get 49 minutes???"
,Captain_Zero,2011-09-03T02:19Z,Looks like this was ripped through a screen door covered with Vaseline.

,FaNtAsY2011,2011-09-03T12:03Z,xvid (avi) rules!
,jjjxx,2011-09-04T02:20Z,"""Long live Xvid. x264 is a CPU hog, for little compression superiority."" are you kidding 700mb 100min 720p movie is good quality with x264"

,sleddoggy,2011-09-05T21:49Z,"Does anyone else have the movie seize & crash around the 45 min mark?  Tried to play it with VLC & Win Media 11 and both crashed my laptop around the same time.  Codecs are up to date, all else seems good. "
,shabbamanuk,2011-09-06T03:43Z,wait wait wait....there's a clean version on its way.
,FaNtAsY2011,2011-09-08T20:17Z,"Please do not be put off by these comments about the quality because its absolutely fine, the sample looks pretty good its like all ppv rips, I think these ppl are expecting dvd quality! It's a bit granny like a vhs what most pay per view rips are like. "
,onthe1,2011-09-09T23:29Z,"If there is a movie that you don't want to see in mediocre quality this is it.  

My advise:  download the sample first and try that before you are disappointed"
,onthe1,2011-09-09T23:30Z,"*advice

:D"
,OrpheusDude,2011-09-11T12:26Z,"NOOOOOOO!  The quality is hideous!  I mean, you can watch the film, but the video quality -  which is really one of the most important aspects of this film - is really quite fuzzy.  PLEASE BE PATIENT AND WAIT FOR A PROPER DVD RIP: the USA BluRay release date is 11 October (I contacted Amazon.com and they said they have no information on a regular DVD release in the USA); at British Amazon, both regular DVD and BluRay are scheduled for 31 October; at German Amazon, the date for both formats is 10 November."
,jrollin,2011-09-11T21:00Z,"i can't understand why people don't write constructive criticisms..... please, let us just assume the poster did his/her best to bring us the film.

thanks poster! ........jrollin "
,satyrosjay1,2011-09-13T23:41Z,"Is the film worth the download if you want quality.  This is the main point,"
,Psyclerk,2011-09-16T05:11Z,"Pretty low quality rip. Looks like you're watching it on an old SDTV through an aerial antenna during a lightning storm. This would be ok for a lot of movies, but this movie has too many important visuals to watch in this quality. Nice try though. Glad to see this movie has not been forgotten."
,Zeagle,2011-09-16T07:04Z,"uploader, did you obtain a pre release screener. wonderful quality and thank you very much for this vid. if i were a girl i would blow you"
,5amjr,2011-09-16T14:04Z,judging by your comment and the quality of the torrent i think you just blew yourself dumbass!
