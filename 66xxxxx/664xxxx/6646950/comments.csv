,alderbaran,2011-09-03T06:48Z,"The truth behind the picture link above is:
 Before tetrapak was introduced in Sweden, there was only milk in glass bottles (and in cows sometimes).
 - This was this poor guy's first attempt to pour milk out of a tetra.
 - It took Tetra Pak several years to realize that perhaps it was appropriate to hold and pour from a more square product.
