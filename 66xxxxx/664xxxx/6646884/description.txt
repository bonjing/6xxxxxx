 The minute-by-minute story of how America dealt with the terrorist attacks on
 September 11, 2001, as told by some of the country's key decision-makers that
 day. The documentary shows how events unfolded as President Bush, his
 advisers, the security services and the military tried to piece together what
 was happening, who was attacking and what could occur next. Former vice
 president Dick Cheney, ex-defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, mayor of New York
 at the time Rudy Giuliani and former First Lady Laura Bush reveal their roles
 and there are interviews with US Army generals and anti-terror chiefs from the
 CIA and FBI.
                                 Enjoy!
