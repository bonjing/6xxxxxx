[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-09-13T11:15Z,I have stopped seeding this one. Want it seeded again just leave message and al turn it back on.
,Ixone25,2011-09-17T17:11Z,ya i downloaded torrent and when i load the game it says disc authourization failure meanin it had a problem finding the disc
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-09-18T11:14Z,@Ixone25 You need to remove the Original TSM.exe (or put it in a back up folder like I do) and then copy over the TSM.ex_  from the crack and rename it to TSM.exe and that will sort the problem out.
,Ixone25,2011-09-18T12:52Z,where can i find the original cuz the game runs but it keep showin the disc authorization problem and wnt let play it
,Ixone25,2011-09-18T12:54Z,And where would i put the copied TSM.ex_ from crack after renaming it
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-09-18T13:33Z,"The Sims Medieval/Game/Bin

You will find the Original in there and thats where you put the TSM.ex_ Then change it to TSM.exe

That will sort it!"
,Ixone25,2011-09-18T14:24Z,ok last thing i've renamed it to .exe in electronic arts>Sims Medival>Game>Bin but it says ex file how do i change that
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-09-18T15:43Z,You just right click and select rename and change in that way.
,Ixone25,2011-09-18T15:59Z,its still says disc authourization somethin bout cant verify if its a valid copy any ideas?
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-09-18T20:22Z,"I have just retested it.

Follow these instructions. To solve it you just have to rename the .ex_ to .exe and it should be fine. If not you have done something wrong."
,Ixone25,2011-09-18T21:11Z,I am reinstallin it then i gnna copy TSM.ex_ put it in Electronic Arts>Sims Medival>Game>Bin and change it to exe
,Ixone25,2011-09-18T21:53Z,btw servius does the game work for you?
,Ixone25,2011-09-19T00:36Z,so name it to TSM.exe 
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-09-19T14:23Z,Yes the game works for me.
,Supertomster123,2011-09-30T11:24Z,"I Dont Know What to Do! It says insert disk 1 with TSM.ex_, but no matter where i do it, it just dosent work! It says that it is not the specific folder! WHAT DO I DO?"

,Sarshka,2011-10-02T15:52Z,Would have been quite interesting if there was actually any cracked content included with the download.

[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-10-02T22:08Z,@Sarshka Look at instructions and the files before commenting. Gees.
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-10-02T22:11Z,Oh and the TSM.ex_ is the crack you gotta rename it to TSM.exe and copy it into the Game. So look before thinking about commenting.
,selenecorvenious,2011-10-04T22:08Z,hoping this works been dying to play
,Daisy911,2011-10-07T06:01Z,SEED please :) thanks 
,Daisy911,2011-10-07T06:31Z,whats the keygen ? 
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-10-07T14:52Z,"@Daisy911

It is on the disc in the crack folder ( rld-tsmk.exe ). That is the Key Gen."
,Daisy911,2011-10-09T15:29Z,thanks :)
,silverair15,2011-10-18T19:40Z,"Is anyone else experiencing problems with the game??? After playing for a few hours and getting up quite a few levels, my game just starts glitching out.. It blacks out, shows my desktop completely blown up, tries to go back to the game, then blacks out again and it keeps happening over and over again until I'm able to close it all out.. I really enjoy this game, but this problem is totally bumming me out.. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!"

,davidb0mb,2011-10-22T00:16Z,You need to give better instructions. I don't see a keygen in here. :| At least tell us where to go 
,chamoiseaudebeley,2011-10-24T18:36Z,"Hello.  I have a problem : Everything works, but when I want to set up a sims, the loading takes two hours and maybe more, but I stop, cause that's too long. So I can't create a sims. Does someone know what's the origin of this problem ? Help please :("
,harryrats,2011-10-29T05:58Z,"hey i did everything like you said but when i start the game it asks for disc one, and the TMS or whatever is .exe im confused?"
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-10-30T12:01Z,"@chamoiseaudebeley

Your system must not be able to handle it then if its taking that long to load!

@silverair15

Firstly do not repeat the same question twice. I would have to say you have an issue with your graphics. Possible your dirvers. Either update them or roll back to older version.

@davidb0mb

This has already been answered. Shows you do not read comments before asking questions. So again al indulge another persons ignorance. The key gen is on the disc in the crack folder named ( rld-tsmk.exe ).

@harryrats

The TSM.ex_ is the crack you gotta rename it to TSM.exe and copy it into the Game. And replace the original."
,krawk423,2011-11-01T09:41Z,I can run the game but now it said it can't find my video card in the database and the game just stuck there
,vabunuc,2011-11-01T21:15Z,its forcing me to download a patch...... is this normal?
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-11-04T08:49Z,"@krawk423

Make sure your drivers are up to date and if its still doing that. Then all I can say is you wont be able to play the game. Some games have issues with cards it dose not know. But then some games do not. Sorry wish there was better info I could provide for you.

@vabunuc

No that is not normal."
,luciemay,2011-11-05T16:44Z,"I can't get the keygen to work, it tries to extract and then says 'the contents of this file cannot be extracted with this program' what can I use to open it?"
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-11-06T02:27Z,"@luciemay

*Raises eyebrow* Extract you do not need to extract. Its not in a zip or rawr file. Ignore 1. Unrar That was a miss take.

Mount the image and go to the crack folder and double click on rld-tsmk That is the key gen."
,Popaj123,2011-11-12T13:53Z,"Really sorry for bothering, but I'm doing this for the first time and I'm not sure what to do next:
I installed the game and WinZip
When I open the game it takes me to a WinZip page of that game and there I found the keygen.
And that's it, I don't see anything more that could be useful for starting the actual game.  Please help me so I know for later too. And sorry if you already explain this to someone but I didn't find it anyway plus I'm lousy at English. Thanks! "
,XDarkfaeX,2011-11-16T13:20Z,"Thanks dude!  It took me about a minute to figure it out since I'm sorta a noob at this, but it works great for me!  :)"
,Tennak,2011-12-14T16:52Z,"its says dont trusted or somthing,
player how to make it work"
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-12-16T01:18Z,"Follow these Steps.

1. Burn or mount the image. (use Daemon tools lite)
2. Install the game and use the keygen when asked for a serial.
3. Copy over the cracked content. (which is TSM.ex_ and change it to TSM.exe you will have to remove the original TSM.exe file)
4. Play the game."
,FatWhalelordz,2011-12-18T17:19Z,"Im getting a disk authorisation failure when entering game. I have copied over the TSM.exe file, but i'm not sure if i have put it in the right place. Can anyone help?"
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-12-29T02:06Z,@FatWhalelordz - OMFG I just retold the instructions. 3. Copy over the cracked content. (which is TSM.ex_ and change it to TSM.exe you will have to remove the original TSM.exe file) God. Next person that dont read properly will just get ignored.
,twistaco,2012-01-13T03:21Z,"In order to rename the .exe at all, I have to move it to the desktop or somewhere, rename it there, and copy it back into the /game folder, or the /crack folder, either one of those, I think. Problem is, there's not enough space in that particular drive, and in order to make more, I would have to delete the .ex_ file. That file is completely untouchable; I can't rename it in that folder, or delete it in any way.

 I'm obviously doing something stupid and wrong here, I just want to know what."
,fazzer337,2012-01-29T02:13Z,@twistaco I think he means copy it through then rename it. Should be able to do it then. 
,Nazaress,2012-03-03T09:00Z,I'm having the same problem as chamoiseaudebeley. The game runs fine until I try to create a Sim; Then it just sits there loading and never actually getting to the creation process. I know for a fact that it has nothing to do with my machine. I can run Skyrim and Battlefield 3 on Ultra. Do you perhaps have a reason for why this might be happening and a solution to fix it?
,Nazaress,2012-03-03T09:45Z,Nevermind. I did a fresh install and didn't apply the cracked update I got and it worked flawlessly. Now I just have to find an update that won't screw me over.
,AliceinShitville1987,2012-03-03T18:19Z,"Hi, sorry to be a bother, total idiot when it comes to stuff like this, and you may have already answered someone's comment on it, but I'm still lost, how do you rename the .ex_ file? Please help x "
,TissueL,2012-03-20T00:14Z,When I start it up it says unable to see if this is a valid copy of The Sims Medieval please contact customer support.
,neamis,2012-03-21T23:00Z,ok new to this how do i change the .ex_ to .exe i have copied the .ex_ on my computer changed it to .exe but when i try to copy it into the game/bin folder it says not enough space please tell me what i doing wrong 
,neamis,2012-03-21T23:05Z,ok i am a noob read the comments this is where i get stuck. i have copied the .ex_ file to my computer changed it to .exe but when i try to paste it in the game/bin folder it says not enough available space.
,TxicAnnie,2012-04-02T18:22Z,"Hi. Sorry to bother. Wondering if anyone has had the issue I have. I followed all instructions fine, played the game off and on for the last 3 days. However, today I went to start it, pressed play and the game starts to load. It will stay on loading screen until well after the bar shows that it's loaded but, but now instead of going into the game selection I just get an error message saying that the game has stopped working.

Anyone have a fix for this. It's kinda making me sad :)"
,jebusfuss,2012-04-03T04:43Z,Okay well i wanted to try and see if this would work installed and crack and keygen all work just when i loaded the game it said something about it couldnt tell if my disc was a real copy and i dont know how to fix it if anyone could help that would be great thanks
,Ali_Black,2012-05-15T02:38Z,Hi. I am having the same problem as @neamis. I can't seem to fix it myself. Please help. I want to try this game and this is very frustrating.

,Ellonnah,2012-06-04T19:52Z,"I am having the same problem at @TxicAnnie, I played the game fine at first. Now when I start playing it shuts down and says that it has stopped working."
,actualfantasy,2012-06-11T00:44Z,Uh... I can't find the keygen anywhere. Where's it located?
