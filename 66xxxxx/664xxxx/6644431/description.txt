Folks, this is my first upload and my connection may suck sometimes so you'll need to be patient at first (this is not a huge file, though) and to seed after you're finished so that the torrent keeps alive and well.

All files were downloaded from TPB, I just put them together.

Credits and virtuals hugs go to the original scanners, they are the reason why we can still afford an internet connection (them and Baby Jesus, probably) and also to the users who uploaded these here in the first place - MrDowntown and mirrormaster82, they rock.
