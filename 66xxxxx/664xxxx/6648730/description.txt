Release Information:

Bummer! World War III happened and killed most of the world's population.
The ones that got toasted were the lucky ones. Survivors live in constant
fear of being murdered or enslaved by violent gangs, renegade military
units and, of course; mutants.
Outfitted with a heavily armored car, unlimited firepower and a thirst
for vengeance, our Heroine  the Wasteland Angel roams the radioactive
wastes, travelling from one God-forsaken town to the next, protecting
survivors from being enslaved. Shes on a mission, to defend those that
can't defend themselves.
Wasteland Angel is a throw-back to the era of vintage arcade shooters,
where players fend off waves of enemies and ultimately face-off against
epic end-level bosses. From a top-down isometric view, players pilot the
Wasteland Angel's overpowered vehicle as its dual machine guns cut a
swath across the terrain. To handle whatever the gangs, muties and
renegades throws her way, Wasteland Angel has upgradeable weapons and
ammo that can rip enemies from this life and toss them into the next.
