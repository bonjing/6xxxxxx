,Smeshuljak,2011-09-03T19:22Z,"The problem I'm having with this game is, after I've installed it and everything, it crashes after startup screen... 

Any ideas?"

,Southpark0075,2011-09-03T20:06Z,"Extremezone i was wondering when a good Upload of Heroes of might and magic VI comes out Ca, Please tell me i can't wait."
,lolocar,2011-09-03T21:28Z,"I crash at startup, the game launches and shows the game picture then crashes. I installed Direct X and v credist included and it still didn't work."
,druhklam_orbowetsch,2011-09-03T21:31Z,Many thanx once again!!!
,Smeshuljak,2011-09-03T22:05Z,"The startup crash appears to be a windows7 compatibility problem...

How to solve it: go to where you've installed the game ( C:\Program Files\Meridian4\Wasteland Angel\bin\x86\dx9 - or something similar ) and right click the Angel application... There go to compatibility and change it to windows XP service pack 3...

Worked for me."

,underclock4,2011-09-04T13:32Z,"Just can't even get this to leave the blocks!! Installed, added the files to the installation folder as stipulated-nothing! Tried compatibility mode-zilch! 
My System: Amd Phenom Quad Core 965 BE; Windows 7X64 Ultimate; 8GB ram; Raedon 5670 GDDR5,1GB, Directx11.

Give up, but if there's anyone who can help I'll appreciate. Looks like a cool game and would love to give it a crack.

Cheers."
,YourMumhasadick,2011-09-04T15:30Z,Error MSVCR100.dll is missing from your computer? Who got this working by just copying the 4 files from the TinyISO folder? cant see any exe to copy over?
,underclock4,2011-09-04T16:13Z,"@yourmonhasadick:Agree-there are 3 files to add to the installation folder-that's it! Instructions said to 'apply crack', but there's no crack! Beats me how some people get this to work.........."
,Dimmis80,2011-09-04T19:29Z,To those that have problems and don't know where to put copy/paste the crack.Copy and then Paste the 4 files inside the Bin Folder-EX:Wasteland Angel\bin\x86\dx9\ and overwrite everything.I have not play the game i just run it to see the options menu and it looks that works great..Again a million thanks @extremezone.:-)
,underclock4,2011-09-04T20:23Z,"@Dimmish80: Tried the instructions u gave below before and did not work. I posted my specs earlier.
Cheers."

,Dimmis80,2011-09-05T09:18Z,@underclock4 did u follow the instructions step by step.?What exactly is the problem.??You copy/paste the crack and the game wont running.??Did u try to update your graphicks card drivers or your sound card drivers.???I to have Win 7 64 and the game is working..
,MicrosoftWeird,2011-09-05T12:02Z,Pleeeeease put up here DJMax Trilogy. Thanks much~
,underclock4,2011-09-05T12:11Z,"@Dimmish80: Hi there, thank you for showing an interest. I'm not not new to patches and cracks, and yes I did follow the instructions to a 't', even tried uninstalling and installing several times but to no avail. My graphic card is Raedon HD 5670 GDDR5 1GB; AMD Phenom x4 965 BE; 8GB Corsair Vengeance RAM; Win 7 Ultimate.
Well, the issue is that the program just wouldn't open and all my drivers are up-to-date and BTW all my software are from PB.
Cheers!"
,Dimmis80,2011-09-05T12:34Z,"@unterclock4 your welkome mate.Very strange thing that the game wont running to your system because like u said your drivers are up to date and u have a good system all around.Good Rig.Anyways i Don't know what else to propose..It might be a compability problem something that u can't find..Aaa now i thought about Service Pack 1 for Win 7.Do u have it installed.??If u have it already or that wont work u can try a similar and better game than this-""Gatling Gear"" witch is here in PB.Cheers."
,underclock4,2011-09-05T16:16Z,"@Dimmish80: Hi mate, thanks for having my back. Yeah, I have Service pack 1, tried several compatibility modes-from XP to Vista and I do have 'Gatling Gear' running on my system for a couple of weeks now without a hitch.
Well mate, that's that's for now...just give up, and I'm not one to easily give up.

Cheers! "

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6630904/Bastion_CRACKFIX_for_TiNYiSO_Release-FANiSO

It is for the Bastion game but it works on this one. I have tried it."
,flatusgass,2011-09-26T18:22Z,"HUH???? Steam tries to launch after I attempted my first startup of this game. BEWARE!!!!

The asshole Nazi's at Steam will permanently ban your account if they discover you have games installed that you didnt pay for. I didnt even know this was a Steam game. 

Hope the people at Steam get rectal cancer!"
,flexy09,2011-09-30T15:09Z,"Thanks Inquisitorlee, does the trick for me. "
,henchman44,2011-10-27T00:46Z,"Tried the Tinyiso and Bastion crack, they both work (Vista x86) but I get this error after the intro movie:

ERROR: Audio file Not Found 'dlc\01\sounds\Weapons\DropFlare.ogg'

Anyone else having this problem?"
