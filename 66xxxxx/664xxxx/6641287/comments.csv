,scenetome,2011-08-31T02:48Z,"This brand new 4 part series hosted by Donal McIntyre explores the history of the Irish prison service since its formation in 1854. The shaping of modern Ireland is that of the prison - the rebellions, escapes, hunger strikes and executions. The series also examines the changing face of the modern prison service now increasingly under pressure from increased violent crime and drugs gangs."
