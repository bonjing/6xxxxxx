Hey everyone, this is My first torrent so let me know if you have any problems.

This torrent is for the first three games of the Geneforge series, the masterpiece RPG experience of Spiderweb Software.

From www.spiderwebsoftware.com :

There are three .EXE files, one for each game. Simply run them and install. Then unzip the corresponding .ZIP file and place the .EXE into the installation directory of the game and run it to crack the game.


I have looked all over for Geneforge torrents for a while now when I found this one on some backwater site, took forever to download it. I figured I'd upload it here so more people could find it.
