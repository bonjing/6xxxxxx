Great copy, and great movie.  John Goodman and Michael Parks give great performances, and the whole thing is like a Tarantino/Coen Bros. flick.  Kevin Smith finally made a real movie!"
,dlarrym1111,2011-09-04T02:18Z,"@Memeth_Astrodog - FYI - Kevin Smith wrote and directed this film(RED STATE)  AND this is why he would care about good or bad criticism of this/ HIS film. 
He spent less then 10 million bucks (actually one of Kevin Smith's biggest budgets of his career) to make this film.  
I am talking about the same KEVIN SMITH that wrote and directed and starred in:  CLERKS, CLERKS II, DOGMA, The ""JAY and SILENT BOB"" series of films, MALL RATS, JERSEY GIRL . . . .

NOTE: NOT the stupid as shit reality show with the group of mentally ill, ugly as shit, too much make up wearing WHORES. . . and the SUPER GREASY ASSED, MAN WHORE, testosterone taking, small dicked, NO BRAINED, SHORT BUS RIDDING ASS WIPES) . 

. . . I am talking about the 2004 movie called JERSEY GIRL . . . ANYWAY. 

 GOOGLE it if you want.

AWESOME MOVIE in quality A10/V10 and in plot and acting!"
,ezloopz,2011-09-04T02:36Z,Smith died after finishing the jersey trilogy... this is obviously the work of an imposter.. cool cover tho

,Phatfish,2011-09-04T05:10Z,The picture is lagging for me like there is wrong framerate or even frames missing. All other videos work just fine in VLC so I don't know what the problem might be.
,freelancer4,2011-09-04T05:28Z,this movie sucks balls just like Kevin Smith !!!
,SmilingAhab,2011-09-04T06:57Z,"Aaaaaand this is why I stick to mid-sized cities. The only thing that made this movie scarier than my weakness to violence was the fact that this could very well be on CNN for how crazy-stupid some people are getting in America. This is literally happening somewhere in the American South right now. Except without John Goodman, of course, which is why (besides Kevin Smith doing a horror) I even watched it. 

Just look at some of the stuff dominionists and the New Apostolic Reformation are saying. These people got an inch away from getting a bill to genocide gay people passed through in Uganda, and are now working for GOP presidential candidates and are in the highest echelons of the American and European political and business worlds. 

Some have said that this movie falters because it's one of Smith's where we can't pin down what he's pissed at, but the whole movie shows it: the sleep of reason produces monsters. And we're breeding a lot of monsters. At least, that's my theory. "
,Krass_Man_85,2011-09-04T09:56Z,"Good copy, shit movie. It's a believable premise, but it was really poorly executed. Bad acting, bad writing, really terrible action scenes... Only watch this if you have some time to kill and don't expect a lot."

*SPOILER REVIEW*

*This is not a light watch.


I almost rated this 0.4, however I felt this would be unfair as its not a poorley made movie at all... 

Its just... its not for normal people. LOL  

It has a 10-15min dedicated to some crazy ass preacher talking about Sin and how homo's will bring about the end of the human race. By this point my eyes were bleeding and the only reason i continued to watch was because I believed it couldnt get any worse. I fucked up.

The police/goverment... acting sloppy. dialog is a joke!

1- Not a hack n slash or shoot'em up.
2- Plot is weak!  ""crazy gun christians have a shoot out"".  Simple.
3- Zero character relations at all. whats the point of killing off the main character kid when the audience viewers dont even care who the punk is. 

I have no idea what this genre of movie intends to be. It is not Horror as described.

Quote from IMDB: ""They immediately gave the green light to Zack and Miri Make a Porno, but declined on Red State fearing its story was too bleak to attract an audience.""

The largest domestic terrorist group is the liberal Earth Liberation Front but you never hear of them.  You have union thugs bashing people all the time - no coverage.  The US own president had a bomber from the Weatherman Underground as a friend, no problem.  But hey, those crazy Christians and the militia are the real threat.  Any day now... you'll see...any day now...well, okay nothing yet.  But we just hate them."

I am AMAZED at the ridiculous 10/10 ratings here. dont ever believe people watching stuff on their 15' PC monitors.

Sound is OK, about what you can expect from standard AC3 audio.

Video however is BROKEN, intense frame skipping which you might not even notice if all you ever object your eyes to are low quality movie rips leeched off the internet. And the picture is actually free of artifacts and very clear despite the low resolution thanks to the original HD TV source.

But the frame skipping is very noticeable if you know anything about video quality at all, and even amplified by the fast paced editing and hand held camera. My advice - wait for a better source rip."

[V],mirrormaster82,2011-09-20T20:54Z,"Wow 129 comments and more than a half are comments related about opinions of the movie.Listen morons,people here are interested about the quality of the copy not the movie itself...so if you want your lame opinions of the movie to be heard,go and do it somewhere else..."
,Timohept,2011-09-21T05:54Z,"@mirrormaster82 , that isn't true at all. Some people do want some feedback on the movie itself. I don't care to watch a crappy movie, yes, even if it is in ultra high definition bluray infinite megapixel madness. I'm more concerned if the movie is a good movie, than how many grains of dirt I can see if I pause the movie and stare at ground. "
[V],mirrormaster82,2011-09-21T18:57Z,Timohept: Go to imdb or RT to see feedback on the movie
,Hamzter2000,2011-09-22T18:45Z,"Well, ""Mirror"" this, ""we're"" actually looking for both; that is comments on Video/Sound Quality, and what you loked about the movie.

After reading 20 diffrent opinions, you kinda get the drift if it's worth the download or not.


Thank you for Commenting, whatever's your Opinion."
,viscousgalaxy,2011-09-26T02:05Z,Video is 10 - Audio is non existent for some reason.  Tried with DIVx and WMP no joy and with VLC all i get is a crackling or what sounds like static feedback.
,djb28,2011-09-27T17:46Z,"Say what you need to , to make yourself feel better Slaney. The fact is, You are downloading a movie. It is illegal. It doesn't matter if you paid for tickets to the show, Or have the BluRay on order. You are here. You are downloading. You are a thief! Just like the rest of us!"
,geeman777,2011-09-27T18:36Z,can't get sound for some reason.

,subliminal_city,2011-11-03T22:07Z,"In all honesty, who cares what someone else that you with all probability don't know thinks about a movie or not. Most people can't be subjective when it comes to reviews anyway - so reading someone else's review or thoughts/opinions about something is just as stupid as... can't really think of anything as stupid as that, comparing who has the best ideology, who has the better God, who is right and who is wrong. "
,subliminal_city,2011-11-03T22:09Z,"subjective = objective in the statement above.
Just to clarify."
,teddansen,2011-11-28T17:43Z,"I don't think people should rate how the movie is itself, and only rate the quality of the audio and picture. No one cares what you think about the movie. Stop trying to ruin it for everyone with your pompous opinions on how the movie itself was."

Great work again extremezone, shit movie though lol"
,lol55,2012-03-24T23:18Z,"this is a gread upload but the film is worse
even my shit when i eat beans is better than this movie
but if you have no life you should try ""feast 1-3"""
,lol55,2012-03-24T23:20Z,"yokohama, you know what i mean"
,StepRazor,2012-05-12T01:02Z,"To people around the world that may think this movie is ridiculous, it is not.  This may also be applied to my fellow Americans on the east coast.  Ruby Ridge, Waco, Northern Idaho, and the labyrinthine factions of the Mormons.  This shit (figuratively speaking) has happened and most likely will happen again.  Its not a joke.  I applaud Kevin Smith for making this film, even if everyone derides it as shit.  He went 180 against his type and made a sharp, cut-throat ""what-the-fa..???"" movie. And for people wondering about the film's budget, it was 4 Mil.  There were no divas, and the 'big' names did it for FAR less than warranted (possibly even less than scale).  This movie is NOT a joke.  If you live in the western United States you know this to be true."
