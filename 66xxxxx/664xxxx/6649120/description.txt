Information
------------------------------

It's perhaps not the most comforting of thoughts, but flying isn't always the safest way to travel. Aircraft tumble from the skies for many reasons: extreme weather conditions, engine failure, lack of fuel, terrorist attack... And that's before we even get to structural failures, fire or human error. This series uses first-hand pilot testimony and computer-generated animations in order to examine some of the world's more dramatic aeroplane incidents, reliving the crucial moments when pilots lost control. Passengers recall life-or-death situations, while the animation aims to recreate an accurate picture of stricken planes' final moments before crashing or destruction. 
........................Why Planes Crash: Fire In The Sky ................................
The Federal Aviation Administration has found that up to three flights out of 100,000 are diverted due to smoke or fire in flight, but the situation is no less dangerous for being commonplace. Witness some of the disastrous consequences in this episode.
