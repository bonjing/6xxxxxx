It's international week, which means there are no Championship games in the npower Football League, 
so that leaves the focus on Leagues One and Two. In League One, one of the pre-season favorites are 
Huddersfield Town. Town just missed out on promotion last season, beaten in the play-offs by Peterborough, 
and will be hoping they can secure one of the automatic promotion spots this time around. Lee Clark's side 
faces a short trip to Oldham to face Paul Dickov's team. Meanwhile, how is Paolo Di Canio's Swindon Town 
adapting to life in League Two? There are extended highlights of their match with Rotherham. 
Presented by Manish Bhasin.
