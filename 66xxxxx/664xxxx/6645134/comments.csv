,Sinthyses,2011-09-02T00:46Z,"Anyone wanna lay odds that chumpley here posted this torrent to keep his comic collection safe while he formats his hard drive while simultaneously not understanding in the slightest how torrents work, guaranteeing an amusing unpleasant surprise for himself in the near future?"
,xenoFLASH,2011-09-02T00:47Z,I don't think so...
,bugmeless,2011-09-02T01:02Z,A single 2.75GB RAR file - that doesn't look suspicious at all ...

Have I read them all?  No, saving them for a rainy, non internet day.  (well, that an a tablet to read them on would work also).

,prophan,2011-09-02T13:25Z,"I'm in the TB, mostly stuff I own in print. Still no urge to get this 2.75GiB zip.

remove all the ads, where needed, sort every-
thing to my own liking and the read until the end of my days."
,cartman19987,2011-09-03T03:33Z,"I have a little over 100 gb in my collection. I can read them on my small phone screen, but having a full-sized tablet would be awesome."
