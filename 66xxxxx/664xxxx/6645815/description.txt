Pencil is special. Pencil is versatile. There is not a single drawing medium that can perform so many tasks as a pencil. Because it can produce lines of different widths, the same pencil can be used for shading, texture making, and emulating a wide range of tonal differences.

To some, a pencil is no different from a pen or a marker because they can all be used for sketching. This kind of thinking ignores the fact that the look of pencil is unique and cannot be duplicated. The ability to visually understand and appreciate the differences is essential. The intention of this book is to clarify the differences between pencil and other sketching media. Many publications on pencil sketching and drawing never venture to the heart of things and discuss in detail the unique characteristic of pencil. They all speak rather briefly about the medium and move quickly into techniques and demonstrations. Very few spend time talking about the
â€œart of pencil sketching.â€

To me, the real understanding of pencil sketching goes beyond knowing the â€œstate-of-the-artâ€ pencils and accessories. It is about creative seeing, such as how to isolate things from a complex visual field. It is about emotions and feelings and the communication between artist and object. I believe that the in-depth discussion of the fundamentals is what will set this book apart from other similar publications.
