"La Proie" is a superbly tense and adrenalin-rushing thriller from Eric Valette, the director of the French horror sleeper "Malefique" and the hopelessly flopped Hollywood remake "One Missed Call". Although most unfortunate for them, I don't really mind when acclaimed European directors' debuts in Hollywood fail, because this usually means they return to their native country and strike back with a vengeance. In case of Eric Valette, he strikes back with a testosterone-packed thriller full of breathtaking stunts, convoluted plot lines, interesting characters and unexpected shock moments.
