Vital Signs, a Pakistani synthpop and progressive rock band was formed in Rawalpindi in 1986. The group was founded by Rohail Hyatt (keyboards, rythem guitarist, drummer, percussions and syth player) and Shahzad Hassan (bass player), who were soon joined by Junaid Jamshed (vocalist and harmonist). They were widely known as Pakistan's most successful rock stars during late 1980s and 1990s.
 
The band initially gained prominence from their single / Video 'Dil Dil Pakistan' first aired on PTV Home on 14th August 1987. Shoaib Mansoor, director of the video 'Dil Dil Pakistan', wanted the band to record the song which later became a critical hit and was voted as the 3rd most popular song of the world by BBC World Service during 2003.

Vital Signs were signed by major record label EMI Records and afterwards released their debut album Vital Signs - 1 (1989). Two years after, the band recorded their critically acclaimed album Vital Signs (1991). The album saw the band to travel and perform in United States and thus becoming the first Pakistani rock band to go abroad. Vital Signs released their third album, Aitebar (1993), which outsold its predecessor. The band found renewed success and popularity with their forth album Hum Tum (1995), which was the highest selling Vital Signs album of all time.
 
After the release of their fourth studio album, the band concentrated on their personal projects and Vital Signs drifted away. Junaid Jamshed went on to pursue a career as a solo singer, Shahzad Hasan concentrated on his work as a music producer and Rohail Hyatt formed a production company.

In 2006, EMI records released a compilation album having title 'The Very Best of Vital Signs (2006)' including singles 'Maula (1997)' and 'Dil Mangay Aur (1999)'
