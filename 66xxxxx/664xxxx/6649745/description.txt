Logan introduces Yukio to Cyclops as they make their way to Madripoor. 
After dropping off the duo, Cyclops heads home. Yukio and Wolverine are 
then ambushed by pirates and easily dispatch them. Logan goes on ahead 
leaving Yukio to handle the pirates alone. At night as Logan reaches another 
shoreline, vagrants jump him only to be shocked at his power. Two bikers 
chain Wolverine's leg from a motorcycle and drive him to a post and hang him 
upside-down. Not showing any concern, Logan cuts himself down and takes the motorbike. 
As soon as a mob of people come after him, a young girl throws knives at the men, 
killing them. The girl states that she saved Logan in hopes that he could work with her, 
but he turns her down. After she says she works with others who try and stop Kurohagi, 
Logan wants answers. She questions his reasons for wanting to kill Kurohagi, 
but he will not answer. She tells Logan where to find Kurohagi, in the most brightly 
lit tower on the island called Dragon Palace. Meanwhile, blindfolded Yashida cuts 
candles off a table and lines them up along the flat side of his katana, entertaining 
guests to his daughter's wedding, and throws them on to pillars of a gold statue of 
Kurohagi's father. As Kurohagi thanks Yashida for the show, a subordinate tells him 
that Logan is on the island. Despite Min's warnings, Logan still chooses to go. 
Knowing now Wolverine is on the island, Kurohagi sends the behemoth Vadhaka to 
take him which sends tremors through the island. 
The creature lands in front of Logan stating he will not pass
