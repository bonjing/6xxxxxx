At the time of its release in 1999, this rich historical epic based on a novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz was the most expensive Polish film ever made (US$8 million). Set in 17th century Poland during the Cossack uprising against the Polish nobility, violence rages and, adding sparks to the fire, both a dashing Pole and a brutish Ukrainian have their eyes on the same beautiful girl. The award-winning film is noted for the performances and set design.
