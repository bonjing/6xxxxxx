This is the Pink Floyd Pulse tour from 1994.  The original torrent was 14 gigabytes, in dvd format, with many extras and a menu, but not many seeders.  I am giving you only the actual Pulse concert video, both CDs merged into one 2 hour video, and in lossless mpeg2 quality.

I realize that the torrent is still rather sizy, but if you are only after the concert video then this is way better than 14 gigs!

If you want the extras, I will be uploading the bonus music videos seperately, because I believe that you shouldnt get more than you ask for when it comes to torrenting.  If you enjoy my work then please rate up and/or comment, but most of all please SEED!

If you have problems playing this video, or any video files, you obviously havent heard of VLC player.  I have yet to come across a video that VLC doesnt support.  Enjoy!
