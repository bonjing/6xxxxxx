i have a small TV so upscaling it would be better :(....but if you guys really like downloading my stuff at correct screen ratio, i would be happy to re encode it..however i just reencode Pirates of the Caribbean and Thor both from BOZX's torrent at 1280x720 (Full Screen) and i dont really want to download those movies again took me 3 days to download 6.5gb at 100kbps :( .... i will try starting from Super 8, it will be at 1280x544 AVCHD...thanks for the comment torrentking64 xD"
