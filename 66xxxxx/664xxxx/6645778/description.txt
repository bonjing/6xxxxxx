Created by Texas-based Gearbox Software, Brothers in Arms aims to be one of the most realistic and authentic World War II shooters ever. Based on a true story, the game puts players in the role of Sgt. Matt Baker, a D-Day paratrooper squad leader as he leads the squad through the European campaign. Each battlefield has been meticulously recreated from aerial reconnaissance images, US Army Signal Corps photos and eye-witness accounts of war-torn Normandy.
