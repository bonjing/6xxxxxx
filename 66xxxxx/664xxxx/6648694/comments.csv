,gpriore,2011-10-30T02:03Z,You're NOT supposed to open the ISO!!! It is an image which you are supposed to just burn directly to a blank Blu-ray disk using an image-burn software.

,OhioStateFan79,2012-01-06T01:26Z,Without a Blu Ray Burner is there any other way to play this. I usually use PS3 Media Server.  I tryed mounting to virtual clone drive but it wont mount.  If the only way is to burn the disc thats crazy blu ray discs still cost too much. Also tryed multiple different file convert programs but no luck. PLease Help 2012 is for 3d porn but theres not much on the bay yet.
,Dryssa,2012-03-04T08:13Z,Is this actually in 3-d?  When I play it using VLC or Windows Media Player Classic on my 3-d TV it shows up only in 2-d (even after changing my TV to 3-d mode).
