,felesar2,2011-09-05T11:13Z,"Love FXG drops, but this film is awful. Worth it for steadfast followers of all things FXG for that reason alone - if you're looking for entertainment out of this one, I wish you luck.
A-10, V-10, M-2"

Sounds like it's worth checking out to me. Thanks FxG - sincerely appreciated. Thx to all s/l's.

Will seed to 10 or more. "
