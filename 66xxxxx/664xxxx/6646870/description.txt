"Having conquered the Glastonbury main stage last year with their Saturday headline slot featuring a guest appearance by U2's The Edge, Teignmouth trio Muse make their only European festival appearance this year when they take to the stage at Reading and Leeds. With a reputation for stunning live shows to accompany their prog rock power, Muse have consistently upped the ante to become one of the most successful rock acts around the world. As of this year they've chalked up over 10 million album sales worldwide and are due to begin recording their sixth album later this year. In the meantime, expect to hear many of their epic hits from Grammy award winning album The Resistance when they return to the festival."
