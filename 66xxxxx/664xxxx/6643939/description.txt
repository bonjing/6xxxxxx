It's sort of tragic that the Original Mirrors didn't last longer, and are so obscure. A practically flawless new wave album, something that deserves more recognition - I've heard other "classic new wave" albums that pale in comparison to this.

It's so consistently good that it's hard to pick out highlights, but "Could This Be Heaven?" is, well, heavenly, and  their cover of the Supremes' "Reflections" is...better than the original. Yes, really.
