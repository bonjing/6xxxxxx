THANKS KIRILL!!!  "
,kirill539,2011-09-01T17:28Z,"Yeah, it is the real deal...
Listening to the whole thing right now. Sounds as complex as Systematic Chaos, but really, really good. First three are epic tracks!"
,bjxm,2011-09-01T17:45Z,Kirill Thanks You Very Much will seed as hard as it gets! the sounding is Awesome and i believe that the writings from the banda without Portnoy its actualy more well doned and MORE preciseze than with portnoy itÂ´Â´s just my opinio tho! BUT nontheless  the album must be killer in the minimum! XD and i hope to ear more of John Myung Lead bass ; ) XD big Hug thanks you :D 
,rnlafferty,2011-09-01T17:46Z,TOTALLY LEGIT! EXCELLENT ALBUM! SEED BROS SEED!

,RockyMM,2011-09-02T11:51Z,And it will be bought. This is for us who can help themselves and wait for proper release.
,lerxstmj,2011-09-02T16:13Z,Downloading! Not a shame when you already have your pre-order.

,Kerkman,2011-09-06T01:35Z,"@bjxm that song was renamed to ""Bridges In The Sky"""
,Nerepla,2011-09-06T15:21Z,oh god i'm coming to u :D
,tito7702,2011-09-12T21:46Z,"@randyrhoads Dude, I'm downloading this torrent and I WILL BUY the album. Downloading torrents doesn't mean to be an asshole with your band. Trully DT fans will agree with me"
,TacoMagoo819,2011-09-14T07:48Z,Thanks so much! Hope it's good.
,yoncenator,2011-10-19T03:17Z,Also not a shame if you just spent over $100 in tickets and are planning to buy a shirt there too.  I met Mangini once when he was playing with Missing Persons.  He was one of the best drummers I've ever seen!
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-04-28T06:56Z,"People have been criticizing this album quite a bit, but i think its quite good. Basically what i expect. "
