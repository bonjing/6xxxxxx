Encode:
presenting you another brand new movie.
dvd was not the greatest in bitrate since the complete disc was shrinked to dvd-5 size
regardless the of the bonus material.
Audio is 5.1 but sounds a bit strange if you ask me.
Looks like the producer intended it to be like that, all action scenes have perfect 5.1,
its just when the actors speak it sounds different. but its no biggy.
Still made the usual,brightness,sharpness,rgb
looks like a very nice movie.

btw: there is a scene after the endcredits

I attached the deleted scenes in a seperate file with lower bitrate for the one who want
to see them afterwards.
if not just deselect them.
enjoy
