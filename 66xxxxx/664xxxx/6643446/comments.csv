,hauntnut,2011-09-03T09:03Z,This file contains hardcoded subs. 
,baltogok,2011-09-03T16:16Z,I am having trouble with the sound on this show. I have tried using VLC (switching between audio tracks) WMP and Zune. None have any sound.
,baltogok,2011-09-03T16:18Z,"Ok scratch my last comment, i reinstalled VLC and it works now. Great upload. Thank you."
[V],neon,2011-09-03T19:21Z,@hauntnut ...are you drunk..theres no hardcoded subs on this file....theres no subs of any kind 
,azb8496,2011-09-06T03:31Z,"I'll second the subs (French I think), but only during the first 40 seconds of the film."

,p0pb0rn,2011-11-06T20:54Z,"hey you guys, just wanted to let the uploader and all the folks downloading this, 90 minutes into the movie the audio goes OUT OF SYNC. the part where bavmorda's skull wearing knight rides off screaming ""i have the child,"" theres a broadcast glitch that throws the audio off.. shame really, i was hoping this would hold me over until the bluray, but the quality of this hdtv rip has little improvement over the dvdrip, imho. there are other hdtv rips of willow, just do a search for ""willow hdtv"" in google. not trying to complain, just wanting to let people know in case their trying to archive this film"
,p0pb0rn,2011-11-08T18:12Z,"i see the problem now. this is a re-encode of ortamci's 2.5gb hdtv rip. i found this out only by downloading the ""other hdtv rip"" i was talking about in the post above. the video glitch is there in the other version, (along with the french subtitles in the first 40 seconds). however, the audio does NOT go out of sync on the ORIGINAL RIP (not this re-encode). not sure what happened to this encode, but there you have it"
,p0pb0rn,2011-11-13T21:16Z,"you guys (uploader included)

this re-encode is OUT OF SYNC. grab the original 2.5 gb hdtv rip from google, cause this is dvdrip quality at best,

and 90 minutes in the video goes OUT OF SYNC"
,ghkj21,2011-11-18T08:12Z,"This was the best of 3 other willow torrents I tried.
The quality was good. It has subtitles that appear to be hard coded but on my machine selecting a subtitle track in the menu and then the program not finding one available eliminated the default subtitles. 
enjoi"
