,jeffreybaks,2011-09-03T22:39Z,"Looks like people are still having problems getting it working, please try this if nothing else works.

For anyone having troubles getting there game to work right

1. Download the game from http://tehparadox.com/forum/f43/%5Bfslfsclbslwu-%5Ddeus-ex-human-revolution%5Beng-iso-2011%5D1gb-9dls-2799367/ and extract the Rars(files are interchangeable). Then extract/mount the ISO image. I just extracted the game files to my programs files directory manually(create your own game directory - there's is no install!).

2. Download the replace files: http://filesmelt.com/dl/Deus.Ex_.Human_.Revolution_.Crack-ALI213_.rar copy over and replace files in the game directory you created.

3. Download the crack: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6631263/Deus_Ex._Human_Revolution_CRACK_ONLY_V1.1622.0.rar copy over and replace the game file in the game directory you created.

Thats it, you should be ready to go, if you need any help email me at jefferson3891@hotmail.com "
,Windsong67,2011-09-05T20:36Z,"Cant even start the game! crashes before it gets anywhere with same error code as all the others (""Access violation 0xC0000005) so i go to steam forums and find TONS of other users experiencing same crashes even well into game. Game is not stable AT ALL, let alone version 1.0 worthy."
,welltell,2011-09-05T23:22Z,Registered right now today to thank you... this is the only upload ever that ran at full speed. At a fast 600 KB/s... Lets hope the game runs on my computer.... and if you keep seeding games at this speed you will have a large fan base. 
,welltell,2011-09-06T03:21Z,Loaded up the game... installed the crack.... played the first 10 minutes of the game... its working good.
