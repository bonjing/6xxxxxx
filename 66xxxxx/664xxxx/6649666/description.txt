Alice in Chains Biography:

(Amazon.com)

Alice in Chains (Formed in 1987, by guitarist Jerry Cantrell bassist Mike Starr, drummer Sean Kinney and Vocalist Layne Staley) is one of the most influential American rock bands in the early 90\\\'s.
Drawing equally from the heavy riffing of metal and the gloomy strains of post-punk, the band developed a bleak sound that balanced grinding metal riffs with subtly textured acoustic numbers.
They were hard enough for metal fans than their dark subject and punky attack placed them among the front ranks of the best Seattle-based grunge bands.

By combining the unique voice and intense delivery of Layne Staley with evocative songwriting and vocal harmonies of Cantrell Alice in Chains created an immediately identifiable sound that also proved to
be quite diverse as their repertoire grew to include both driving angry rock songs and mellow acoustic compositions.

The band found commercial and artistic success in the early 90\\\'s, which stressed Staley\\\'s increasingly clear abuse of heroin. They often found their attempts to follow up the success in the studio or on
the road to be hampered by Staley\\\'s erratic drug-fueled behavior. Ultimately, Alice in Chains failed to maintain a consistent career in the post-grunge music world and limped into the break when Cantrell
turned its attention to solo projects (which often include contributions from Kinney and Inez) Staley finally succumbed to his grief when he overdosed in April 2002

Jerry Cantrell Mike Inez and Sean Kinney reformed and played shows in late 2005 and early 2006 with a variety of guest vocalists including Billy Corgan, Pat Lachman, Wes Scantlin, Maynard James Keenan, Ann
Wilson and Phil Anselmo. In Late 2006 William DuVall joined Alice in Chains as a singer in the band\\\'s reunion concert with Velvet Revolver and ex-Guns N \\\'Roses bassist Duff McKagan. In September 2009 Alice
in Chains released their first studio album since 1995 album called \\\"Black gives way to the Blue\\\".

Summary

(Amazon.com)

The new Alice In Chains album Black Gives Way To Blue is the sound of a new beginning of a legendary band returning to life. Right from the album\\\'s powerful and deeply meaningful opener \\\"All Secrets Known\\\"
through its redemptive closing title track, Black Gives Way To Blue-the first new Alice In Chains album in more than 14 years-is not just another rock reunion, but something far more inspiring.
Alice In Chains in the present tense. No replacements. No substitutions. It does no disrespect to the enduring memory of Alice In Chains\\\' late, great lead singer Layne Staley, to say that for all that he
brought to the group\\\'s music in his lifetime, Alice In Chains always was-and always will be-very much a band. So after taking a more than respectful break to mourn the loss of their brother and band
mate-to heal and explore music individually-the surviving members of Alice In Chains-Cantrell, drummer Sean Kinney and bassist Mike Inez-gradually began to make music again. The band came together for the
first time in 2005 to take part in a benefit for the victims of the tsunami in Indonesia. The following year, Cantrell, Kinney and Inez decided that the time was right for Alice In Chains to reclaim its
legacy again on tour. They did so with the help of a new guitarist and vocalist William DuVall, a gifted singer and player in his own right from Atlanta who previously worked with Neon Christ, Comes with
the Fall, and as part of Jerry Cantrell\\\'s touring band. As live audiences discovered, DuVall brings a sound and stage presence all his own. Yet when DuVall and Cantrell blend their voices-as Cantrell and
Staley did so often-there could be little doubt that the spirit of Alice In Chains was once again alive and well. Black Gives Way To Blue is the next step for a group that over the course of their career
earned multiple Grammy nominations and sold more than 19 million albums worldwide and achieved 11 Top Ten singles. At the same time, the album offers the full, bracing impact of Alice In Chains-a band that
kept heavy rock exciting at the dawn of the Nineties and helped set the stage for an even grungier Seattle sound-still clearly firing on all cylinders. Recording on Black Gives Way To Blue began in October
of 2008 at Dave Grohl\\\'s Studio 606 in Northridge and finished at Henson Studios in Hollywood. The band produced the album with Nick Raskulinecz, whose past credits include Foo Fighters and Rush. Black Gives
Way To Blue combines some classic Alice In Chain textures with a renewed sense of energy and possibility,from the epic and fantastically electric rocker \\\"A Looking In View\\\" to the exquisite and romantic
ballad \\\"Your Decision\\\" to the album\\\'s stunning first single \\\"Check My Brain,\\\" a throbbing rocker in which a band associated with the Pacific Northwest makes a wry and witty observation on working and
living in California. Through Black Gives Way To Blue, there is a deep sense of the unique life that this band has lived, of \\\"Lesson Learned,\\\" to borrow the title of another standout track. In the end, the
album offers a kind of shared group autobiography by a band that has survived so much. Together, they are in a way \\\"Last Of My Kind,\\\" to use the title of another album highlight penned by
Jerry Cantrell-long a dominant songwriter within Alice In Chains-with lyrics from DuVall. \\\"Imitations are pale,\\\" DuVall and Cantrell sing together on \\\"Black Gives Way To Blue,\\\" a brand new Alice In Chain
classic that really has it all-the brooding hurt, the brute force and the beautiful introspection. Listen closely to Black Gives Way To Blue, and you\\\'ll know right away this is Alice In Chains.
