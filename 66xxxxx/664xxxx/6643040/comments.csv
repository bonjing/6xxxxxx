,SmokeyAU,2011-09-01T11:22Z,"We've run out of seeders though... Stuck at 53%. Please come back,"
,Fangular,2011-09-01T17:53Z,It's true.. I'm stuck on 74% with an ETA of 16 *weeks*. It's the same with Project Runway.. this just isn't working I'm afraid!
,LaLuna666,2011-09-01T18:17Z,"I have downloaded it to the end, but it doesn`t work properly. First AVI had to repair the broken file and then it`s choppy as hell and picture freezes, so you might as well wait for it to be uploaded by someone else :) Thanks for the effort though. "
,Fangular,2011-09-01T19:24Z,"Oh ok.. the Project Runway Australia episode is probably OK though.. or it probably would be if I could just download the last 15% (my curent ETA is infinity, and I really don't want to wait quite that long..) 

And the thing is that UglyDucklingxyz is the *only* person on PirateBay who uploads Aus PR - so I'm extremely grateful and I don't really have much choice but to keep trying, to get that episode at least!"
,UglyDucklingxyz,2011-09-01T19:58Z,"@LaLuna666

Not sure what you mean by choppy, etc. The video plays normally for me, so it must be a problem on your end.

At the very least you can now help seed ;)"
,zoria31,2011-09-01T21:31Z,"UglyDucklingxyz: How come there's no seeds? I'm stuck at 82% and it says 0 seeds. I'd love to help seeding, but it's frustrating when i can't even download it."
,UglyDucklingxyz,2011-09-01T22:28Z,"Unfortunately, I'm on a sluggish internet connection at the moment (the upload is abysmal), so that's why. I'm using the ""initial seeding"" option which is supposed to help spread all the pieces around faster, or at least it did for last week's episode. Perhaps not everyone is seeding the pieces they received? "
,Whaley1,2011-09-02T01:16Z,"Thankyou for the up. much appreciated. I'll just wait and seed forever, patience people. "
,Whaley1,2011-09-02T01:16Z,"Thankyou for the up. much appreciated. Will seed, patience people."
,Whaley1,2011-09-02T01:18Z,"Thanks for the up, will seed. patience."
,Fangular,2011-09-02T16:42Z,This is a perfect version - not choppy at all - it's flawless! Thank you.
