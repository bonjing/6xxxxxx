,hauntnut,2011-09-03T22:23Z,"The quality on this one is no better than the smaller versions out there; it appears that the source for this is not, in fact, an actual screener, but an already-ripped copy of the screener which has been reconverted into a DVD ISO. And by the way, if you're going to make a DVD ISO, why not have the subtitles as an optional feature rather than hard-coding them? Waste of bandwidth."
