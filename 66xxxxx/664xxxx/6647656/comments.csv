Then copy all it contents in the main game folder.
Then copy orbit folder files(in the downloaded crack) to C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher(by default).
then launch the game via the launcher(the one you copied to main game folder).
Wait for at least 45 sec to 1 min , the game will run and you will be able to save games.
IF IT DOESNOT RUN THE FIRST TIME, TRY IT(JUST DOUBLE CLICKING THE LAUNCHER.EXE) 3-4 times, THE GAME MUST RUN.

Very strange. Have installed a number of times from the setup.exe and meets no such windows. Installs without any problem.

@cpktnwt
You have copied _all_ files from the SKIDROW folder to the installation folder? Try and run both the Launcher.exe and CoJ_TheCartel.exe as administrator. Remember also to block the game in the firewall so that it can't connect to the internet. When the procedure is done correctly, one should not need steam at all."

Usually, when someone uploads another crack that means this one might not work and the new one is the probably the fixed version.................just a thought........"
,Fant92,2011-09-07T20:45Z,"I really don't get people bashing this game. I've been playing it for hours and it's great fun! Yeah, no blockbuster, but just a fun FPS. Definitely worth a download at least."

,WV25705,2011-09-08T06:23Z,Kudos to Skidrow with another great release.  Works flawlessly on Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit.
,olsen_man,2011-09-08T06:24Z,This works on win 7 x64 if you follow the install notes.. is this the official released game? 
,xaleeeeeel,2011-09-08T09:06Z,how to fix save game??
,Liongooder,2011-09-08T12:45Z,Thanks extremezome but when i launch the game it says COJTC stopped working my system is Windows Vista 32bit
,DontPissMeOff,2011-09-08T17:31Z,"Thanx extremezone for the upload.
The game, however, is an absolute piece of shit comparing to the previous Call of Juarez Bound in Blood. Graphics like from year 2000. Sound issues - it helps to change your speaker configuration to stereo. No 3D support. Cars blow up even if you only shoot windows LOL. After finishing Deus Ex this game is just unbearable. I'm gonna give it another try and then I'll uninstall it."
,TorrentMonster,2011-09-08T18:27Z,"Downloading this game is just a waste of time!
Me and plenty of other people have already said how bad this game sucks and i just want to repeat that, because this game is just a peice of crap and its obvious that they guys at ubisoft havent been using a lot of effort into making this a great game!"
,KRCO95,2011-09-08T19:30Z,This game is schit i download with zamunda and game sucks so do not download this game is shit or download if you wont soory for my bad english...:)))
,zabeast,2011-09-08T22:35Z,"if the game won't autosave:

To be able to play the game again where you left off, you have to finish the chapter, you can not exit the game in the middle of the chapter because you will have to start that chapter again. The good thing is that chapters are not very long, 10 to 20 minutes (so far). Even every Level you gain when collecting money or secret agendas will be saved so don't worry
when you exit the game, the continue button is gone but it's OK, just choose Campaign, choose your character and the chapter (eg: Chapter 3, means you finished chapter 2 and ready to start chapter 3, when you collect Secret agendas in that chapter you will notice that the level you reached in chapter 2 will continue and not reset)"
,Subtracting,2011-09-08T23:59Z,To the people bad mouthing the game. First off its just your own opinion so shut the fuck up and let other people download and decide for themselves if the game sucks or if its decent. I've played both the other Call of Juarez games and I loved them so keep your opinions to yourself and stop wasting comment space. On-Topic: Torrent works great thanks for the upload and thanks to the Skidrow team again for releasing clean torrents and cracks.

I had feared this... but then I'd expected it to be sandbox and let us drive around and it doesn't, so to hell with it. It's certainly not its drug war theme that appealed to me anyhow.

I am disappointed with SKIDROW
maybe it's not their fault it clashes with x64
anyway here is how to get it to work

=============================
#############################
=============================

Install SKIDROW release and update (and just in case, copy crack folder contents to installation folder)
DL: Call.Of.Juarez.The.Cartel.STEAM.RETAIL.Incl.Update.And.Crack-ALI.6646652.TPB.torrent

Copy the ""Ubisoft Game Launcher"" folder to:
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft

Copy the ""Update"" folder contents to:
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Call of Juarez The Cartel and replace files.

Start the game with administrator privilages

And just so you know, I wouldn't waste my money on this game. it's nothing compared to COJ 1 and 2"
,SeVeNcE,2011-12-16T18:37Z,"YET ---  the save doesn't work

anyway the game isn't worth it, it's just a fps where you run sometimes and shoot sometimes, and every now and then you blow up something.

unfortunately The Cartel II is a modern shooter also, though luck for us.

damn I miss the old western days"
