IRON MAIDEN - Beat Club, Bremen, '81 (German TV)

This is the famous appearance of Iron Maiden on Beat Club, a German weekly TV show in the '70's/early '80's that also
featured bands like Saxon, Dokken, April Wine and....ABBA.
The band plays live for half an hour in front of a studio audience and seems a bit nervous. They make quite a few mistakes throughout
the set ('Sanctuary'!). Nonetheless, it's a great, energetic show from Maiden in what I consider their best period.
The video is a PAL recording, taken from what I guess is a 2nd generation video tape. Picture quality is pretty good,
although there is some colour bleeding. I think I'd give the picture a VG to VG+ rating. Audio quality
is great, but in mono. Furthermore, the Maiden concert was aired on Beatclub in two parts, on 2 different dates. For some reason,
they decided to show 'Santuary' on both dates... Rather than butcher the videotape to edit one 'Sactuary' out I decided to leave
both shows intact.  

The video tape was transferred to DVD using a stand alone DVD recorder. There's no fancy menu
and just automatic tracks every 5 minutes. But at least the audio is in sync!
Please feel free to re-author the DVD, though. I just don't have the time or the knowledge.

All in all, this is a highly recommended piece of Maiden history, and one of the few
proshots of Maiden w. Paul DiAnno.
 
I can't upload screenshots, but I'm sure you'll like this.

Enjoy!
