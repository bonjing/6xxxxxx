,b3nt_m,2011-09-04T09:43Z,Seed - please
,Unhappydisgustingwow,2011-09-05T01:21Z,What is the point of uploading torrents if you aren't going to seed the fucking things? 
,marthafar,2011-09-05T13:04Z,"There's only one seed at the moment so when I stop seeding, the seeding stops. It resumes when I start again. It isn't always convenient for me to keep the machine running (and, therefore to keep seeding) continuously. Once more than one person can seed I am sure that the availability will improve. 

unhappydisgustingcow: if you don't like it, feel free to fuck off and find it somewhere else."
