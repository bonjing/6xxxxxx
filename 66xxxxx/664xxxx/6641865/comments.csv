Don't think so, the tracks overlap as they do on the other torrents.

Might not bother most people but I find it very annoying."

You get what you pay for."
,PhreakU,2011-09-06T02:11Z,"I've sampled this in my home studio (monitors, mixer) & it sounds like a 320kbs CDrip to me.

As for ""wateva111"" extremely inaccurate douchebag comment:
The only track that has a 'glitch' is track 7: The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie
There is a portion (3 secs) of the end of track 6, repeating at the beginning of track 7.
All tracks are complete.

You could easily fix track 7 by using dBpoweramp to re-write/crop the file -or- record a duplicate minus the first 3 secs."
