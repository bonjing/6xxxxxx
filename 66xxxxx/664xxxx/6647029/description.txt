Description :

Relive the action, drama and atmosphere of the amazing 2011 Isle of Man TT 

fuelled by Monster Energy. The Official Review features comprehensive coverage 

of every race, practice and the unique festival atmosphere which surrounds the 

worldâ€™s great road race. This is racing at its most extreme â€“ speeds of more 

than 190mph just inches from hedges, houses and walls.
New trackside camera angles, breathtaking aerial footage and white-knuckle on-

board sequences put you at the heart of the action for unrivalled race coverage, 

exclusive behind-the-scenes access and special features. This year revealing 

thermal imaging technology appears alongside the stunning ultra slow-motion 

camera footage. Once again, expert commentary and analysis comes courtesy of 

former racers Steve Parrish and James Whitham, and, new for 2011, TT-winner 

Steve Plater joins the team.
â€˜King of the Mountainâ€™ John McGuinness reclaimed his crown with stunning rides 

in the Dainese Superbike and PokerStars Senior TT, although fanâ€™s favourite Guy 

Martin made the Morecambe missile work for his 17th victory every mile of the 

way. Michael Dunlop, Bruce Anstey, Michael Rutter and the Sidecar team of Klaus 

Klaffenbock and Dan Sayle all made welcome returns to the top step of the TT 

podium, plus the 100th anniversary of racing on the legendary 37.7-mile Mountain 

course celebrated new victors â€“ Lincolnshireâ€™s Gary Johnson and TT Sidecar 

regulars John Holden and Andrew Winkle. Eight races, seven winners and some of 

the closest competition seen in a century of racing on the Moutain â€“ and it is 

all here.
