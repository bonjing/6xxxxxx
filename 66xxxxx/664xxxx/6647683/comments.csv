,chuckbrow,2011-09-03T01:46Z,"Thanks for including a sample.

What's a PPV rip?

by the way, this file is twice as big as most movies I download - usually DVD rips compressed down (Xvid or x264) to 700MB so I look forward to seeing the sample to see if it's twice as crisp!"
,nightyman,2011-09-03T02:28Z,"PPV Pay Per View - This means someone paid to watch the movie at a place that has these new videos. They recorded it and now is sharing with you.  The quality is limited by the resolution the videoprovider has, this is not a direct dvdrip."
,levizz,2011-09-03T08:36Z,"Horrible quality AND aspect ratio is square.

Isn't worth downloading (don't do it). "
,Kemo5abe,2011-09-03T08:37Z,"Quality, anyone? A / V ?"
,snowbirds,2011-09-03T08:38Z,"Thanks for the up.

Like his other PPVRIP torrents, the quality here is much worse than normal PPV rips I've seen.  Very grainy, pixelated, fuzzy and dark.  Not in widescreen, rather it is a TV screen ratio.  Quality is more like a cam, IMO.  

V -7.5
A - I can't never tell on my earbuds how good the audio is.  pretty good I guess."
,5amjr,2011-09-03T11:38Z,@IwannaFan2 don't want to sound greedy but with this file+ transformers ppv out am i right in thinking a R5 is close?
,seviucha,2011-09-03T12:12Z,"v: 3

really bad copy ;/ "
,knightmare420,2011-09-03T13:11Z,No screens Hmmmm will wait til the r5 i think
,MetalRemol,2011-09-03T15:03Z,I saw screens of this copy and it's not even close to R5 quality but slightly better than TS i think.
,Ethedor,2011-09-04T02:27Z,"never download iflix movies
i dont even understand why u people wasting our time and bandwidth on these shitty cameraish low res sh*tmovies...
""quality release from iflix"" lol

at least u should put ts or cam after iflix so anyone can know that this torrent is not what im looking for...."
,dlarrym1111,2011-09-04T02:46Z,"@nightyman: and any others: It is far worse then just uploading a PPV to share. That is true enough, but this person is getting his ""copy"" ny placing a Camera on a tripod and placing it in fron of a regular 4:3: TV and that is how it is recorded. it is so retarded I can't say this enough!!. 
It would be a different if this  person used a TIVO type DVR to record this or all his PPV movies. If these movies were captured this way (TOAST even has PLUG in just for copying from TIVO and covering it to XVUD, DVD-R, DIVX, h264, or whatever format you want, ALSO FYI - the TOAST app by ROXIO also allows the aspect ratio to be as it was intended (LETTERBOX) not 4:3 like this upload is. YES, UNLESS you want to watch this on your nice flat screens in an old-school 4:3 ASPECT ratio, STOP DOWNLOADING NOW because this is this uploads aspect ratio.

This isn't meant to be mean to this up-loader but is meant to be constructive criticism. If this person would only listen to the comments, he could change what he is doing instead of misleading thousands of TPB members and guests.

I don't know why this up-loader isn't forced to label that his uploads are PPV movies being recorded on a CAM aimed at a damn TV SET!!! AND. . .YES, it is in 4:3 aspect ratio (as are all older TV sets which is what is happening here. . . .USUALLY, Up-loaders that mislabel a CAM as being a true rip are always told to quit mis-representing there uploads. I don't get it???

I would and will run like hell from this guys/gals uploads!!!!!"
,dlarrym1111,2011-09-04T02:58Z,"One last thing, It is absolutely possible using TOAST or similar DVD authoring software to create a perfect DVD quality rip from a ""Pay Per View"" source. 
TOAST has a PLUG-in just for this purpose. It will allow the creation of a perfect copy in the correct aspect ratio of any PPV that is recorded onto a DVR or a TIVO. This guy orders a movie through PPV, then he/she is putting a CAMERA in front of the TV set that the movie is being shown on!!! THIS is where the problem lies. 

This is omly meant to be some contructive critasism not just a bashing this guy/gal.

PLUS I think all the downloaders should have the right to know what they are wasting there bandwidth on. The TPB in the past has stopped people from mis representing what they are uploading. Why isn't this person being treated the same way??????? His description are not true. It should say something like this: 
""ALL my uploads are from CAMS placed infront of a 1998 TV set and are in 4:3 aspect ratio and are not real rips"" 

For some reason no one in the TPB management seems to care?"
,dlarrym1111,2011-09-04T03:00Z,"Maybe it isn't as much as the TPB not caring, this uploader is being deceptive and getting around an thing put in place to prevent mis information some how. 
The bottom line is if someone is going to upload, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE be honest and tell us what we are downloading."
,redactedwv,2011-09-04T06:11Z,"@ dlarrym1111 - 

Well there's no arguing with this:  ""be honest and tell us what we are downloading.""

Haven't downloaded, so i can't comment on anything truly relevant, but i did want to say that it is clear you meant no offense and were genuinely trying to be helpful. 

Don't remember what off the top of my head, but i know i've gotten/seeded good stuff from iwannafan in the past... If dlarrym1111's info applies, hopefully it will be helpful to a solid uploader (and others)."
,wizzkid1970,2011-09-04T06:33Z,why you fool even bother with these ppvrips they are all and i mean all worse than cams by a long way lets stop giving these fools our time and hopefully they will stop posting this crap ppv
,5amjr,2011-09-04T08:20Z,"Sure the ppv's are poor in quality but more often than not the R5 files seem to appear soon after the ppv.
For any PB newbies the movie quality improves with each file release, first CAM-TS-R5-DVD-Blurayrip etc, normally anyway! lol"
,RodBrasil,2011-09-04T17:42Z,"A=7.5

,joo-loved-it,2011-09-04T21:03Z,"@dlarrym1111
I don't believe the catharsis was necessary.
the numbers say it all.....people are willing to accept this so called ""garbage"" be it may.
you are actually abusing the whole concept of leaving comments.
Just be like everyone else and leave an A/V rating and let the people decide for themselves.
you are not helping, you are only insulting the uploader for doing you a favour and risking litigation so you can watch your latest releases.
geez whingers like you should all just be rounded up, taken out back and out down(inhumanely). "
,joo-loved-it,2011-09-04T21:03Z,put down*
,5amjr,2011-09-05T08:26Z,"@joo-loved-it it's the uploaders choice to risk adding files to PB, like most i'm very grateful but don't shoot someone for having an opinion!
Chill out + get up off your knees it's a free site!"

,redactedwv,2011-09-05T23:42Z,"Tourentte's Syndrome: 

An inherited neuropsychiatric disorder with onset in childhood, characterized by multiple physical (motor) tics, and at least one vocal (phonic) tic; these tics characteristically wax and wane. Tourentte's is defined as part of a spectrum of tic disorders, and is universally associated with the exclamation of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks directed at uploaders of media utilizing the bittorrent sharing protocol. 

While there is no 'typical' case of Tourentte's, all patients share an inability to submit constructive comments in the space provided by online torrent indices, regardless of a file's quality or provenance (see also: wizzkid1970)."
,effezie,2011-09-06T02:22Z,Movie Excellent! Download Okay. Seeded and Thanks
,5amjr,2011-09-06T09:12Z,"@maralfayazian when any torrent you have downloaded asks for passwords or directs you to other sites delete them. They are usually fakes, spam or in some cases trojans/viruses.
For movies stay away from rar files and if your unsure just check out the comments as someone will probably have mentioned it.
Once u become a regular DL'r u will learn what to DL + what to leave alone."

,Dj_iron,2011-09-09T23:48Z,ween can we expekt a dvdrip or BDrip oof this!!!
,Superhombre,2011-09-10T01:40Z,I used the NCH Prism File Video Converter freeware to resize this to 16:9 widescreen. I am watching it now and it's not bad. It will do until the r5 gets released on October 20th or so.

You are my hero.  You are so right about USAhater.  

@USAhater You are smart. Intelligent. Beautiful, and you probably have a fancy education that was taught to you in a school house with dirt floors and no computers.  I'm glad you found P'Bay though.  Hopefully the American cinema you so anxiously seek to ""pirate"" will pull you out of the depths of the Bollywood bs and bring you into the real world. Tom Cruise is REAL!!!!!
