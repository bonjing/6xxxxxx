Robbie Robertson 1987


Robbie Robertson is the self-titled solo debut by Robbie Robertson, released in 1987. The album won the Juno Award for "Album of the Year", and producers Lanois and Robertson won the "Producer of the Year" Juno award, both in 1989 as there were no Juno Awards held in 1988.

The album is notable for the contributions from the members of U2 and Peter Gabriel, both of who were also working with producer Daniel Lanois at the time. U2 was recording The Joshua Tree and Gabriel was recording So. U2's contribution is heard in the song "Sweet Fire of Love" which is a duet of sorts between Robertson and U2 lead singer Bono. The other track featuring U2 is "Testimony", again with vocals from Bono. Gabriel's contributions are heard on the song "Fallen Angel", which was dedicated to Robertson's former Band bandmate Richard Manuel, and "Broken Arrow" which reverberates with Gabriel's signature Rhodes electric piano. In addition, Tony Levin and Manu KatchÃ©, who were recording with Gabriel, are featured prominently on this record. (The album notes give Ashcombe House, London as a recording venue: this should read Ashcombe House, Bath, Peter Gabriel's home and recording studio at the time the album was recorded).
