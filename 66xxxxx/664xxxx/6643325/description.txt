                It's the last day of camp and everyone's thinking
                about the summer they've had, the home that awaits
                them and any unfinished business that might need
                taking care of. Most of all, they're excited about
                the last night prom - even the dateless Chunk Bunk.
                And with the secrets that have been lurking between
                the boys all summer threatening to spill out at any
                moment, it certainly promises to be a night to
                remember.


                                                      
                                       
                                                
                                        
                                         
                                                
                                                                     
                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           
                                                                      


                Encoded at crf 21 because this series is less
                compressible than most scripted series. It would go
                over 5000 kbit/s on crf 19.
