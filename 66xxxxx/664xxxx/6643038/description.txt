Brief, accessible, and sophisticated, ANALYZING POLITICS, Fifth Edition, presents a clear outline of the discipline of political science and helps students understand the practical and immediate uses of applying analytical approaches to the study of politics. This text is notable for its early coverage of methods and theory and the use of a case study approachâ€”introduced and used to acquire in-depth information about a particular subject while also pointing to its limitations. While the text covers fundamental concepts with contemporary, political examples, discussions of feminism and environmentalism offer a distinct departure from other texts and a unique opportunity to professors and students of political science. In this edition, new chapter opening examples highlight recent controversies that will spark student interest, frame core concepts of the chapter, and illustrate to students how politics is about their lives.
