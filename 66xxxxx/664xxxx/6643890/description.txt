Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple Computers decided to sponsor
two huge outdoor Rock n Roll Festivals, one in 1982 and the next in 1983.
Both Festivals were held in San Bernardino County just East of Los Angeles,
California at Glen Helen Regional Park.

The 1983 US Festival today is still listed in the Guiness World Book of
Records as "Largest Rock Festival Attendance" with a record crowd
for all four days of 670,000 fans. Van Halen also set a world record as the
highest paid artist for a single apperance $1,000,000.

The US Festivals werent simply just loud, crude rockfests with top of the line
recording artists, women in bikinis and the sweet smell of marijuana
billowing above the crowds, these shows also had technology expositions,
air conditioned pavillions that showcased the technology behind the shows.
This was the opening day and beginning of Rock & Roll EPCOT !
