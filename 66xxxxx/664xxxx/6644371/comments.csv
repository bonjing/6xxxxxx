[T],trialNerror,2011-09-01T16:07Z,"I'm not sure if I'll continue releasing this series as TASTETV already does it and can post it sooner than I since Ghost Hunters is airing at the same time and that takes priority in my duties.

However, I might continue releasing this series because TASTETV seems to be a scene thing and only has a torrent on TPB via TVTeam and scenebalance.   

Eh, might as well keep it going just for something to do.  :D  That, and so far there's nearly 100 peers downloading from me.

Thank you's to the helpers and supporters.

Screw you's to the trolls and hit 'n' runners."
