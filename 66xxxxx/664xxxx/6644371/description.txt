Tales of this episode: The Philadelphia Experiment, Ape-Man, and Zapped to Death.
 
In the 1920s, a Soviet scientist hoped to crossbreed humans and apes to build an invincible army; Thomas Edison's work led to an unfortunate result; a UFO expert testing invisibility and teleportation learned that the Navy had already done so.
