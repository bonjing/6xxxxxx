From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about plan by the feds to seize Liberty Dollars from collectors and people using the silver and gold coins in barter and as a substitute for inflation-ridden dollars issued by the private Federal Reserve banker cartel. The federal government considers use of the coins to be domestic terrorism. 

Alex also follows the latest developments in NATO's military coup in Libya and the installation of al-Qaeda as the bankster replacement for Col. Gaddafi, who is now on the run with a bounty on his head.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
