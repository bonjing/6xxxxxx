,wierd-old-guy,2011-08-31T17:34Z,UNFORTUNATELY.....you can't simply provide a program and tell some of these blathering idiots to protect the program from calling home: They screw it up almost every time! So MANY good programs have been messed up from idiots it's countless & really a drag.

Really!
Never screw up my torrent:D
But people,why screwed up my torrent???
There are two choises:

1.Pay the software  for 40 dollars/

2.Download the torrent,and follow the instructions.


I know it:D

,grandmasdiary,2011-09-08T08:18Z,"Well, this is weird:
I followed the instructions to a T, and I even blocked it in my firewall. 
Then I started it, it had the green icon on the lower left corner saying it was registered. 
i then turned my router back on and
started a scan, but IE popped up saying it was a pirated version, my IP has been reported, blah blah blah.

I expected the program to shut down, but it didn't.
Instead, it started an automtatic update, and then started the scan, and it's still scanning happily in the background, reporting errors and things like it shuld be doing!"
