Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.

================================================================

Alan Watt is a long-term researcher into the causative forces behind major changes in historical development. His background is that of a renaissance man with a background in three professions, plus having various books published in religions, philosophy, poetry, mainly under pseudonyms. For much of his life (for main income) he was heavily involved in the music industry as a singer/songwriter/session-musician.

Born in Scotland, he watched the subtleties of politics and media as they guided the population of the U.K. covertly into a European Amalgamation. He has been warning the North American people for some years now that the same process of amalgamation is being carried out.

With historical documentation, he shows how cultures are created and altered by those in control, always to lead the people like sheep into the next pasture.
