,Dykaren05,2011-09-04T20:52Z,Why not rename and repost?
,fsr1947,2011-09-05T00:23Z,"you are not seriously expecting folks to rename 1000 files???

Better to give up on this set of photos if the poster can't be bothered to properly upload the files..."
,reichert,2011-09-05T06:05Z,"
I f you use a small application called ""A Better Finder Rename"" it is the most complete renaming solution available , it takes only seconds to do so...

rename *. jpg *. php"
,onlinehot,2011-09-05T14:21Z,"CORRECT COMMAND

rename *. jpg *. php"

,homeskillet42069,2011-09-12T01:40Z,"First off THANKS Onlinehot for upping as much as you do.  Always quality too and nice quantity!

I am having trouble doing a mass change to .jpg, the prior link is not a language I know.  It sounds like you have already fixed it on your end, would you mind re-upping the files?  Tons more will be able to enjoy your content & I'm sure everyone else who is struggling would appreciate it.

If not, no biggie I'll just grab your next up and be plenty happy with that. :)"
