Plot:Iria, a beautiful princess from a small kingdom has refused every prince who has asked for her hand in marriage. When Iria nears 18 years old, her father the King worries that his daughter will not find a prince of her liking, which would be horrible since without a prince there will be no heir! One summer night, Iria whispers to the moon sharing her worries. An enchanted and clever frog overhears Iria, who is unaware that her four legged friend is actually under a spell and needs Iria's kiss to become a handsome "real Prince" once more.
