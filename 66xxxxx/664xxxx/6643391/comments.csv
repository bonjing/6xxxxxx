,DriftH.,2011-09-01T23:12Z,makes you wonder what ask me what you want to know and I'll answer you the bast i can. i put this torrent up because the other The Sims Deluxe Edition torrent had a problem with disc 2 and i want to give back to TPB.
,Thorn-Rose,2011-09-04T05:16Z,"Drift, could you please seed it so that people can start getting it and then seeding it for you? If there are no seeders-- no people getting it out there-- then it's pretty useless to be trying to ""give back to TPB"". With two comments and no seeders, this does seem like a suspicious torrent and even if it isn't suspicious, it's certainly one that won't get downloaded."
,nightmare1967,2011-09-23T03:19Z,Can you seed please DriftH. or take it down.
,SanelR,2011-10-26T20:47Z,"heey, can you play this game ?

ByeBye."
