If you are familiar with my past projects then this one is pretty self explanatory. 
This is a best of the best of my previous 5 projects (A Mix Of All That Was, In This Twilight, A Million Miles Away, All That There Ever Was, Banged And Blown Through) and my last NIN project ever, 
unless they tour again. This is the best sounding, or most interesting in alot of cases, source of each NIN song ever played live all mixed together to sound like one long continuous concert. All of these tracks 
are from bootlegs recorded by fans and none are of official nature. The main setlist is 8 hours and 15 minutes long, with another bonus set that is 3 hours and long that contains tracks done with other artists joining NIN on stage. 
Tracks range from 1988 through 2009 and it is very interesting to hear the differences in the way the band sounded throughout the years.  The project is created totally by me, ETS member NotinCnStopMeNow,  except for the artwork 
which ETS member wizfan made.  Any additional info and disscusion can be found here: http://www.echoingthesound.org/phpbbx/viewtopic.php?t=52622&start=0&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight=
