Alexander and Sadiku's fourth edition of Fundamentals of Electric Circuits continues in the spirit of its successful previous editions, with the objective of presenting circuit analysis in a manner that is clearer, more interesting, and easier to understand than other, more traditional texts. Students are introduced to the sound, six-step problem solving methodology in chapter one, and are consistently made to apply and practice these steps in practice problems and homework problems throughout the text.

A balance of theory, worked examples and extended examples, practice problems, and real-world applications, combined with over 350 new homework problems for the fourth edition and robust media offerings, renders the fourth edition the most comprehensive and student-friendly approach to linear circuit analysis.

This edition adds the Design a Problem feature which helps students develop their design skills by having the student develop the question as well as the solution. There are over 100 Design a Problem exercises integrated into the problem sets in the book.

Alexander/Sadiku also offers you the convenience of ARIS -- the text-specific web site -- which allows you to assign homework online or create printed homework sets and solutions to your students. The website also features solutions and KCIDE software, which reinforces the books problem-solving approach.
