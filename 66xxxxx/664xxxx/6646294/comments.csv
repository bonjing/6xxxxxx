,shiva1985,2011-09-06T14:57Z,"@All major Hindi Movie Uploaders:
This shit-laden movie is everywhere...if underground groups will not upload Indie movies like ""That Girl in Yellow Boots"" than who will...?? just because its not a mainstream movie and most of the dumb-asses here are bothered about this Bodyguard crap...its everywhere and I can't find even a mention of ""That Girl in Yellow Boots"" on any P2P site...you are defying the very ethos of p2p filesharing...thats really not done...!!"
