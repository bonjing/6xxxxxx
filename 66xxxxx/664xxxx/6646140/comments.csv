,mrpeeman,2011-09-05T18:25Z,"Great torrent thanks guys. Got a couple of crashes every now and again but that is probably due to the make-shift pc i'm playing it on.

Got to about chapter 3 and i got another crash but this time it took all of my saves with it - and i have no idea where they are stored anyway so can't even check it out! Anyone know much about this?

Awesome game and awesome torrent. Only seeded 4gb but that's all i can atm!"
,mrpeeman,2011-09-05T18:35Z,Nevermind - found them! (For anyone else in this situation i found it in C:\Users\*your name*\My Documents\ALI213\*number*\Storage.. Now to get them to work again :)
,mrpeeman,2011-09-05T19:41Z,"Sorry for triple post but i seriously have no idea what to do with the save files. They wont show up in the load game menu anymore and i have no idea where to put them or how to kick start them into working again :(.

The files have no extention, and include things like ""user"" ""saveindex"" ""gamea1"" ""gamer1""

Any help would be appreciated"

I've tried everything from installing the latest drivers, directX etc. but still can't manage to play the game. I've done some research about the game's crashes, fixes, bugs etc. and tried to patch the game everything and still I can't run the game. I have an ATI HD graphic card and also tried the atiadlxx.dll trick to start the game but to no avail I was unable to play the game."
