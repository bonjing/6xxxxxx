[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-09-23T10:01Z,@xholic79 Yes this is not like C&C 4 where they screwed up big time. No need to be on-line to play C&C 3 TW.

[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-12-16T01:12Z,"@redblaze1 what Virtual Drive software are you using?

@Those with DL issues I have put my upload back on again. But remember many do not constantly upload and speeds will depend on there upload speed."
,poppy20,2011-12-24T18:45Z,"Wonder why this uses the fully gay .mdf format. Anyway you can just rename the .mdf to .iso to get a proper iso file that you can burn with non-gay software like imgburn (no need to use gay poweriso or alcohol120) or extract with winrar to scan for viruses before you install.

Thanks for the upload."
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-12-29T02:03Z,@poppy20 - Your bitching about format will not make me change it. It works and dose what it should do. Now my games do not and will not contain viruses! Now if you do not like the format then look else where!
