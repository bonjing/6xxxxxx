├óΓé¼┼ôThe Desolate Lands in my mind is a project I formulated in the mid 90├óΓé¼┬▓s around 96. There are songs I recorded as a testament to that. It├óΓé¼Γäós basically a conceptual album, a ├óΓé¼┼ôwhat if├óΓé¼┬¥ the world went through some sort of catastrophic event like a global nuclear war, apocalyptic type thing. What├óΓé¼Γäós left after that? Not much, many deaths, a lot of sick people, some people who will try to take advantage of the situations etc. So The Conqueror is like the hero & a mercy killer in these days & times. I wanted this to be like a movie on disc or MP3├óΓé¼┬▓s. Thanks to a lot of MC friends, DJ├óΓé¼Γäós & producers (especially DJ Extremidiz). We├óΓé¼Γäóve crafted a project that I feel really hits the nail on the head & accomplished what we set out to do with this.├óΓé¼┬¥ ├óΓé¼ΓÇ£ Gage
