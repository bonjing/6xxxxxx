Hello users of TPB, I\'m a new uploader here and I\'ll be going with the username
Heu-Vid as you may see.
This is actually my first upload ever. I came up with this brilliant ideÃ¡ to convert MKV files to VOB files. So that\'s what I will be uploading here today and hopefully more in near future. Depends on how many comments I get and seeders ofcourse.


What\'s a Vob file?.. And what\'s it\'s purpose?...

Yeah, so Vob files can be played on a Playstation 3 and MKV cannot. So basiclly I\'m just converting over MKV\'s to Vob so you can enjoy your good quallity ripp on your Playstation 3 without converting it yourself or downloading lesser quality ripps.



Why would I want to do that?...

I\'ve been downloadning on TPB for quite some time, I love it. So I figured I could try to upload something that people might want, I know I\'d appreciate if someone converted my MKV\'s to Vob so I could watch it instantly on my PS3. However, I\'m here to give something back to the community!

THANKS to \'youssef0eddoumali\' for uploading the series in MKV!

Hopefully thanks to me for converting it so it may be played on PS3.
