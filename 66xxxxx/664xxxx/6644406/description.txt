From electronic wire taps to baby monitors and long-distance video and listening devices, startling changes occur everyday in how we gather, interpret, and transmit information. An extraordinary range of powerful new technologies has come into existence to meet the requirements of this expanding field.

Your search for a comprehensive resource for surveillance devices is over. Understanding Surveillance Technologies: Spy Devices, Their Origins and Applications serves as a provocative, broad-based, and visually appealing reference that introduces and describes the technologies rapidly moving into mainstream computer and consumer markets. It discusses information gathering and tracking devices from a variety of traditional and emerging technologies. It highlights common uses, possible abuses, countermeasures, and issues of legality and privacy.

The format of this book is modular. Each chapter starts with an introduction, then describes some of the devices within the category and the context in which they are used. This is followed by a history, common applications, and legal and ethical implications, and print and Web resourcs. With the exception of the introductory first chapter, each chapter stands on its own and they can be read in any order.

From handheld magnifying glasses to sophisticated magnetic resonance imaging machines, "spy" devices allow us to see beyond the basic senses that nature gave us in ways we wouldn't have imagined two hundred years ago. Understanding Surveillance Technologies: Spy Devices, Their Origins and Applications gives you the groundwork toward understanding more advanced technologies such as radar, sonar, video cameras, and genetic profiling.
From the Back Cover
This is the first comprehensive text to cover this fascinating field from origins to present-day practices. Secret agents are no longer the only people using spycams, radio beacons, and tiny audio listening devices called 'bugs.' Spy devices are now an important part of almost every investigation, office environment, phone system, traffic advisory, and newscast, and are being incorporated into consumer devices in almost every home in the developed world. Never before has it been so important to learn about these technologiges and understand how they can affect your life, your government, your children, and your work.

This book is designed to be modular so you can read it in any order. Select the chapters that interest you, and follow the corss-references to find out more about related topics. Learn how one-meter-resolution satellites can see into your back yard, or the industrial yard down the street; find out how search and rescue professionals find lost hikers and victims of natural disasters. Learn how forensic experts solve cases using chemicals, microscopes, and minute traces of fibers and blood. Discover the history and progress of DNA research and how a simple cheek swab can identify an adoptee's biological relatives or establish a deadbeat parent's financial responsibilities.

This text is an excellent introduction for beginning surveillance professionals, including surveillance consultants, forensic investigators, law enforcement agents, and military recruits. It can also serve as a text for political science, sociology, and graduate business courses, laying a foundation for further study and professional development.

The text is extensively illustrated with more than seven hundred photos, diagrams, and charts to clarify the concepts, illustrate how the technologies are used, and provide examples of actual surveillance devices. Coverage includes over 900 pages organized into 18 chapters that include

- Acoustic Surveillance
Audio, Infrasound, Ultrasound, and Sonar Surveillance
- Electomagnetic Surveillance
Radio, Radar, Infrared, Visual, Aerial, Ultraviolet, and X-Ray Surveillance
- Chemical/Biological Surveillance
- Biometrics, Animal, and Genetic (DNA) Surveillance
- Magnetic Surveillance
- Cryptologic Surveillance
- Computer Surveillance

In addition to practical information on products and applications, this book provides extensive histories and information on legal debates and political decisions related to surveillance, privacy, and the protection of individual freedoms.

Understanding Surveillance Technologies includes references for further study in each chapter, including carefully annotated lists of books, articles, journals, Web sites, and films. Each chapter has a glossary of common terms related to that specific subject area. For the emerging field of surveillance, professionals are predicting this reference will be the industry standard introductory text.
