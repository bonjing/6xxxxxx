,evilmonkey99,2011-09-03T09:51Z,"Wow i was skeptical to say the least when downloading this file. I have over 530 bluray movies that i've downloaded probably around 4 or 5TB anyways and i never imagined a movie could be as such good quality being less than 2gb. The audio is even 5.1 so that is good too. Just being me though if I larger file comes out with this same movie, i'll download it. But this is awesome quality. Not bluray video quality but HDTV quality."
