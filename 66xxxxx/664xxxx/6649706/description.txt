06 "Cyber Battlefront / Technical Difficulties"
"Dennou Sensen" (é›»è„³æˆ¦ç·š)  November 5, 2010  

As Tony tries to learn more about the whereabouts of Yinsen, Laboratory #23 is 
attacked by a virus which causes the robotic cleaners to go berserk and greatly 
reduces the temperature in the complex. Tony and Chika try to shut out the virus with a firewall, but this allows the virus to infect computers around the city and even takes over some fighter jets. In order to lure the culprit out and protect the Arc Station, Tony takes the virus into the Iron Man armor in order to fight it. Hearing Tony's promise to protect people, the culprit, a boy named Sho who was approached by Zodiac, is reminded of his promise to his late mother to protect others and destroys the virus. As Iron Man returns, he is attacked by more Zodiac mechs but is saved by someone piloting a new armor, Ramon Zero.
