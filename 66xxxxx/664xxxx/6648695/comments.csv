,bog23man,2011-09-03T11:48Z,"Just a quick note, if anyone would like me to reseed any of my old torrents 
please let me know and I will as I now have 100MB upload speeds (Finally)
If you do... could you please just send me a comment to my latest torrent with the 
name of the film.

Information. 
I Only normally seed to a 40:1 Ratio, the reason for this is that if 40 people download
the film and not one seeds either the film is rubbish or the torrent is dead due to hit and run.
BUT I can always reseed no problems (If I have to).

OR maybe I so just leave them there ? I have 1TB of server space so ? 
please comment on this bit, just thought it may become a bit of a nightmare
to find things that was all.

P.S If any of my new torrents say 0 Seeds for some reason TPB doesn't take 
the ISP Server(SeedBox) as a seed, don't know why !!and no torrent is restricted to 
download speed..(100MB max)"
