Lola is a beautiful and deadly member of the Sy Kuang, an ancient society of assassins. When the most powerful gangster in Chinatown marks her for death, Lolaâ€™s hope for survival is to bring down her former employerâ€™s entire crooked organization with the help of Dennis, an FBI agent who has no idea of her true identity.
