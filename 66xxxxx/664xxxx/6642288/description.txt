However, Sauron's "life force" is bound to the Ring, allowing him to survive while the Ring remains. Isildur, corrupted by the its power, refuses to destroy the Ring. When Isildur is killed by Orcs, the Ring is lost in a river for 2500 years. The Ring is found by Gollum, who possesses it for centuries until it is taken by the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins.
