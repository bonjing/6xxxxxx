In this spin-off of "Friends", Joey Tribbiani moves to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career. 

The show is all about Fun Loving Guy, who is new in town and starts afresh with is acting career.

In Season 2, the fun is taken to the next level, and things get pretty exciting.

All the episodes are in AVI format, and are lightwieght, so that any player, any system can play these.

Enjoy :)
