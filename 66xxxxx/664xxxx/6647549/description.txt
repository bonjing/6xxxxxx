Garmin MapInstall Special v3.14.4


This executable disables the online check for the 25 digit unlock codes generated by JetMouse.

Instructions:
- Install MapInstall 3.14.4 (get it from the Garmin website)
- Replace the original MapInstall.exe with the patched one

The file downloaded from Garmin's website is an update, but if you haven't installed a previous version, just extract the MapInstall_xxxx.exe to a temporary folder and launch MIMAIN.msi

Don't forget to seed! This file is tiny, so an upload ratio of 3.0 or more would be greatly appreciated.
Enjoy!
