Storyline: Kaufman financed the construction of Dead Reckoning, a heavily armored vehicle that can travel through the zombie-infested areas with ease. Armed with remote-controlled heavy machine guns and video cameras, Dead Reckoning primarily functions as a moving fireworks launch base: zombies are fascinated by fireworks and will stare at them, ignoring anything happening around them. Riley Denbo (Simon Baker), designer and commander of Dead Reckoning, has recently retired. Unlike Kaufman, Riley is respected for his work in protecting the city from danger, as well as bringing critical food and medical supplies which the citizens can no longer acquire safely themselves.
