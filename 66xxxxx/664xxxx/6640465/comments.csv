all my muscles feel worked-out. I was actually covered in sweat and out of
breath - had to stop the video and take a few short breaks. BTW Im not a big
fat guy, just out of shape. I have a 10Lb & a 15lb kettlebell and switch based
on my own preference. In the US, good places to find cheap Kettles are Walmart 
(I know but they have em cheap), Ross/TJ mAXX/Big Lots (any outlet store might
have em in the exercise section.)"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-01T20:33Z,"Day 4 - today was 'butt & hips' and despite the name it killed me. Been going 4 days now, every morning. Been doing Core on m/w/f and other days going through others in order so: M -Core, T- Arms+shoulders, w-Core, th-Butt+hips ..etc. Next Monday Ill start Core week2 and that way my body never gets in a rut always different exercises. Im already much thinner - strengthening my abs/stomach/back muscles really pulled everything in. Working on eating better to help with my shrinking spare tire. Eating less food more often so metabolism is always burning and im always digesting (no fat storage) trying to eat mostly meat and veggies. :D"

[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-03T22:00Z,All I have are these 3 Kettleworx torrents (see description for other 2) - There is another torrent out there but so far I have been unable to Download it - If I do Ill post it here and SEED
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-04T22:17Z,Day 6 - Finally got to Fast ABs and Holy Crap!! The video has 3 10minute Ab workouts with warm-ups/cool downs for each. I could not finish most of these exercises :( They are so easy but when you're doing them it feels like someone is taking a hacksaw to your Abs - they work but good luck going the full time.... 
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-12T22:47Z,"2 weeks in, today was a great day - started Core Week 3 and Ive gotten in such good shape and such a strong core that it was easy today, no pain, no shaking, no weakness, and not only did I not wimp out on any exercises including the Core-Row (my nemesis) I actually did an extra set, rewound the video for a 4th set :D Im thin, toned, defined - I notice it in everything I do :D"
