Takes more than one listen to absorb the variety of styles going on here, PM & TIG were obviously happy to let their combined creative streaks run wild.  I prefer the more upbeat stuff, songs like "Dream Sequence 1" and "Thundertunes" which sound like the Primitives years ahead of time.  Some great bass work by Pauline's Penetration bandmate/boyfriend Robert Blamire, and while her voice is not technically proficient it has a winsome, airy quality.
