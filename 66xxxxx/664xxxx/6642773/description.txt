The Four Seasons by Italy's Antonio Vivaldi has always been a greatest
favorite of my classical choices. Perhaps even the best - although I have
some Bach Chopin and Beethoven pieces that are equally on the same list.

I have always best liked the renditions by the Italian group I. Musici - 
often found on the Philips Label (Holland). We are posting this here
for you in full 320k bitrate - Ive only just gotten back from the shop with a
brand new CD for this conversion as I donated my previous copy of this to the
Local Library years ago and kept some mp3 versions for myself at more reasonable
bitrates to my own liking. You can convert this set of files to 192k or 224k or 
whatever quite instantly with available software you could also download for free.

Its funny, the CDs of this title were all in the $20 range, while this version,the best of all that have been produced of this greatest work, was cheaper by far -
perhaps they sell many more and can afford to discount - its on the Philips
(Holland) label


enjoy this lovely music as most a favorite for a lifetime!

Please look for our 720p music video posting as well of this programme
as it is already posted for you too - great sound (excellent 160k bitrate
on the video clip)!
