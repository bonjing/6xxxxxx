Description:
Description: Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were
two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were archenemies, they were closest
of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat
the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between
Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-MEN.
