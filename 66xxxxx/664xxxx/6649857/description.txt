Every investigator should own the Cadaver Dog Handbook... Rebmann, David, and Sorg do a wonderful job of providing a foundation for the understanding of scent evidence and are a welcome addition to the limited research in this field. Handlers and administrators, as well as researchers and legal experts, should review this text and determine its many applications for themselves.
