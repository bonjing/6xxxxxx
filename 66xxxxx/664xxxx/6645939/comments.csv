,Steiners82,2011-09-05T20:51Z,"Same resolution, four times the size and way worse audio than
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6624403/Adventure_Time_305a_Fiona_and_Cake.flv 
Not worth the download."
,dinosaur58,2011-09-06T23:16Z,"Wow, Thanks Steiners82, saved me the DL. It must have increased in size during conversion from flv to avi. Will wait for 720p, or capture it myself."
,99jay88,2011-09-08T23:40Z,With Demonoid offline I am still hoping for someone to post this in HD.  PLEASEEEEEEEE!  :)
,99jay88,2011-09-09T02:55Z,"Audio Quality = 3
Video Quality = 6"
,dinosaur58,2011-09-10T20:48Z,"If anyone has the right software and skills to sync it I captured [and deinterlaced] a clean 720p video stream + 6 channel AC3 audio of this episode. The sync 'wanders' off and back on twice. It's weird, I've seen this once before and could never get it to work. I would offer to upload the raw 1080p transport stream [which is synced], but it's 700 mb for 11 min."
,xddp76hd,2011-09-11T02:44Z,700 mb isn't huge for one file. Just upload that and someone can encode the 720p version.
,dinosaur58,2011-09-11T20:16Z,"Done!

Full 1080p Raw Transport Stream.
760Mb, Plays on my PC using MediaPlayerClassic."
,dinosaur58,2011-09-12T05:47Z,"That was quick! Here is the 160Mb 720p mkv encoded by Asussin.

I will stop seeding mine as soon as the current peers finish."
