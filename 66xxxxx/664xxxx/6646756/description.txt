DeanK is back, and he has brought the multiMAN application for your jailbroken PS3
consoles with him. He released version 02.04.00 a couple of weeks ago, and has added to
that things like Wallpaper and Dev_Flash support. He has already made several other
improvements to his multifunctional/multilingual tool for your PS3, such as making it more
user friendly, by preventing 3.60+ game updates. You can see the rest of the official updates
for version 02.05.00 release below.
