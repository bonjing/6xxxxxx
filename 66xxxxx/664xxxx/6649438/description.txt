Almost 2,500 fonts from Adobe font folio 11 and about 100 I've collected from here and there. The fonts from the Adobe font folio are the entire western fonts folder copied into a single folder along with the ones I collected so, if you're looking for an easy to install font pack, this might be the one for you.
