,joshw220,2012-03-02T00:35Z,"Hey guys I googled this and it appears to be a Scam,  there were a ton of websites and blogs slamming this company, but thanks to the piratebay we can watch it for free without having to pay 2,700 bucks to attend or pay for the over priced DVD's. Then make the judgement ourselves, Thanks again uploader."
,Jazzdancer,2012-05-07T16:10Z,"It simply amazes me what we can find on TPB!  I just heard of this course a few minutes ago, one look here and all I have to do is download.  Just amazing. Thank you afadxb!  Big time - thank you."
,Jazzdancer,2012-05-07T16:50Z,"I dwnlded the first cd - it's real and the dwnld was fast!  

Did I say thank you yet!!! not enough anyway - THANK YOU!!!!"
,Jazzdancer,2012-06-04T20:32Z,"I've watched the basic course and have to say I'm not an experienced trader, but I still didn't find the first course very useful so I'm glad you made it available and I didn't have to pay for it. Also after the first hour or so, the instructor started to grate on me. Too bad it's the same guy for the adv course.  Just fyi on my personal take.  The video and sound quality are good.  BTW the first course was filmed in 2003.  Hopefully, the advanced course will be more useful. "
