,Belastigen,2012-05-27T09:10Z,"Nice upload. Download speed's a bit unreliable, but hey. I'll seed this for as long as I can (Which at this rate will be a few months or more.) and hopefully I'll finish the download in the next couple of days."
,Belastigen,2012-05-27T09:12Z,"And xy535, they are all .mkv which runs fine in VLC."
