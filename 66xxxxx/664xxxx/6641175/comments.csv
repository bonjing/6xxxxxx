,PESSO114,2011-08-31T09:21Z,only one question: WHAT IF THE PLANE HAS 4 ENGINES?
,broxi53,2011-08-31T10:11Z,Not tried this yet but install instructions are in the Docs folder. for all engine configs.
,PESSO114,2011-08-31T10:45Z,"sorry, found my answer...yeah, the instructions are pretty clear...add-on works fine"
,wetmouse,2011-09-02T06:37Z,"lollol123lol123 is PMDGCRACK. Never, EVER follow one of his links unless you want trojans and viruses. In fact, never follow ANY links posted here as everything you need is already here and such  links are ALWAYS from scammers. PMDGCrack, by the way, has been banned at least twice now and has just opened this account (lollol123lol123) to continue his spamming for Russian mobsters."
,Obama_bin_Laden,2011-09-12T02:29Z,i like wet operations. your mom's snapper is a good start.
,anscad,2011-09-14T13:10Z,I have this add on and it's a bitch to install in all my payware planes but when it works it is pretty cool. Be sure to follow the instructions in the Read Me file closely. Also when you edit the entries make sure that everything in the cfg is identical from the .0 value to the last one.
