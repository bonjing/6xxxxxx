Software development happens in your head. Not in an editor, IDE, or design tool. Youâ€™re well educated on how to work with software and hardware, but what about wetwareâ€”our own brains? Learning new skills and new technology is critical to your career, and itâ€™s all in your head.

In this book by Andy Hunt, youâ€™ll learn how our brains are wired, and how to take advantage of your brainâ€™s architecture. Youâ€™ll learn new tricks and tips to learn more, faster, and retain more of what you learn.

You need a pragmatic approach to thinking and learning. You need to Refactor Your Wetware.
