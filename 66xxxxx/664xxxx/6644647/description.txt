Iâ€™ve seen lots of people asking â€œWhat song was that playing during the credits of episodeâ€¦.â€ and so on about the different music choices in AMCâ€™s Television Series The Walking Dead. There may not have been very many songs but I thought they were pretty good and it took me a bit of searching to find all the titles and then get the songs, so I thought some people might be interested in downloading them all from one place. 

Iâ€™m still really new at this so I hope there arenâ€™t problems with the torrent. If so, Iâ€™ll try to fix it and then re-post.
 
The track list is:

1)	Space Junk- by Wang Chung (End of Episode -1 â€œDays Gone Byâ€)
2)	Iâ€™m A Man- by Black Strobe (End of Episode -2 â€œGutsâ€)
3)	Sunshine- by John Murphy (Driving to the CDC- Episode 5 â€œWildfireâ€)
4)	Tomorrow is a Long Tme- by Bob Dylan (Credits of Season Finale- â€œTS-19â€)
5)	The Sun Ainâ€™t Gunna Shine Anymore- The Walker Brothers (Various Promos/Trailers)

All are Joint Stereo MPEG-1 Layer 3 audio files (except for # 5 = Stereo)
#1, 2, & 3 are 44,100 KHZ 
#4 & 5 are 48,000 KHz

I donâ€™t really know what other details to give- Itâ€™s not really my area. Sorry!
