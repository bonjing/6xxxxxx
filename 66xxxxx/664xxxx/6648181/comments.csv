,wcmorr02,2011-09-18T03:46Z,"How long should it take to restart?  I used the program and took care to only download and install the drivers.  The machine needed to reset to finish installing.  It tries restarting, but stays stuck on the Windows screen.  I tried three times... first time 15 minutes and then I manually restarted... let it go for 45 minutes... restarted again... then left it for an hour and a half and finally I just restarted from a restore point and have been fine.  When trying to restart it would stay on the black screen with the windows logo glowing.  I do not think my machine was ""stuck""... you could tell the logo was glowing and moving.  The OS would just never load. 

Is it supposed to take this long?  Anyone have any suggestions?"
,GearCloud,2011-09-19T13:03Z,new version i would download it and see if it contains trojans or not.........

,Pumpsoul,2011-09-21T01:03Z,"Now i get it. That´s why everytime i run the install drivers it came out a windows saying ""Driver Base is old, do you want to connect?"" Or something like that.
Anyway hope to find the drivers missing, because last version couldn´t find it for some hard, old and dusty hardware :P"

Unlike other driver finders, this is a download containing nearly 3GB of drivers. Since they're all there, you can run it on any computer, even without internet access."

,cochino,2011-10-13T18:30Z,"There are no virii HERE. There is a link to a Russian search engine Yandex (Яндекс). They actually trade in NASAQ (NASDAQ:YNDX).

When installing simply do not accept the defaults. Disable all uselless or unknown options and you will not end with that nuisance.

But as a device driver utility it is great.

JUST DO NOT ACCEPT USELESS OPTIONS!
