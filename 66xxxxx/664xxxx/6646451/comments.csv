,minertje,2011-09-13T02:04Z,"Thanks for the upload!

The game runs fine although I got a problem. 
My powered minecart (minecart+furnace) can't push other carts !

 Other minecraft downloads on this site had there own problems like ghost car (drowning of rails and becoming black). 

No ghostcars in this version, but pushing one or more carts isnt possible. 

Someone got a solution ?"
,minertje,2011-09-13T02:19Z,"Update of problem:

Powered minecart cant push west-east, east west. Nord-south south-east is possible. "
