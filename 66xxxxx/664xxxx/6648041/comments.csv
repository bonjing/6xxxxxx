@kimsballs
It doesn't really surprise me that, even though you are getting this content for free, you bitch about it being in multiple rar files."

,Mr_Gamer,2011-09-03T10:03Z,"@kimsballs ""multiple rar files for a TV show??? What is this 2003?"" - Multiple RAR-Files is a standard releaseform. Initially it's intended so that pepole can download peice by peice from a cloud-site/file server. But an additional benefit is that RAR seems to download faster than a single large file. Less room for errors to occur as well. To make it easy, download Total Commander (the ULTIMATE file-handling tool, with roots back in MS-DOS) and download the command prompt version of RAR and add it to Total Commander's packing tools. No need for WinRar. Pepole need to learn how to overcome slight ""inconveniences"". ;) - Thanks for the upload!"
