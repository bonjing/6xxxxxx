If possible this should be seeded again with subtitles. The new scene with Han Solo talking to Jabba the Hut is a bit meaningless without the subtitles. Jabba speaks an alien language and with no subtitles it's impossible to know what he's saying."

You can add it to the file by downloading MKVtoolnix 4:

Use MKVtoolnix to make a new MKV file - it takes about 1 to 2 mins to do with the subtitle added. :)
