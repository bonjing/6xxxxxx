Whenever I download hi res .mkv files from sceneline I find that they will not play on the Divx player (ONLY those from sceneline have this problem).  That means that I cannot watch them on my Blue Ray players but have to watch them on my computer where VLC will work.  I simply can't figure out why only the .mkv files from sceneline have this problem.  Any idea folks?  Better yet, any solution?"
