,russell1nash,2011-09-11T19:57Z,@neli00: thanx for the confirmation! I'm dloading NLUPPER002's dvd9 as well and we'll see if that one stands the test of splitting...:)
,russell1nash,2011-09-13T13:38Z,"well, i will go for a dvd5 just for watching it without burning it... "
,russell1nash,2011-09-14T19:59Z,"@neli00: thanx for the tip! 
However, i went for a dvd5, watched it and, for my money, this installment is simply not worth it! :(
After watching the movie, i decided i simply don't want it for my collection, since i don't think i'll re-watch it... 
Anyways, thanx for your comments and your advice! Glad to share TPB with pirates like u!"
