,falcon.other.one,2011-09-04T04:31Z,"From the number of Files alone, safe bet it's a segmented RAR package. This is a legacy distribution method, for anyone seeding to newsgroups with message size limitations. Very old practice, and still widely used. Many modern players work well with RARs. If you're curious to learn more, a search engine should turn up scads of good links.

Several whole-file torrents are up, too, if you don't need a RAR package."
