In return, I ask for assistance, the installation was successful, but whenever I try running the game, the game crashes and Windows attempts to find out what the issue is, but never found out, (I am using Windows Vista.) but, however, when it tried to install DirectX, it somehow encountered a dumb error, and it ignored that, but it still gave me the option to run the game, which still, never works, though I also get a window saying the game has been tested on Windows XP 32 bit, but I've seen gameplay videos of it running on Vista, please help me."

,wirama,2011-10-03T10:07Z,I try several suggestion but I think this game itself is broken and can't execute the program correctly... I suggest you try other Battlefield 2142 torrent
