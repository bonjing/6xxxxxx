This is an absolute "must have" for Irish fans - a rare CD of the "Original"
old fashioned sounding Irish Tenors with such rarities as "A Little bit of
Heaven" along with the essentials as Danny Boy and When Irish eyes are smiling
The Rose of Tralee and My wild Irish rose etc (track listings below) As to the
piracy warnings on this CD from the disc I purchased at the store this morning
(new but opened cd) I can only submit that some stuff should be for free - 
that includes Irish music for rightly spirited folks in order to keep them in 
the rightness of their being. The right source of funding should be a public pool - mainly taxes and expropriation of excess profits from the Bill gates genre if you get my drift.

The artists will make as much this way and everyone will have the music -
something the artists should NOT begrudge or the music would be worthless
anyways perhaps! (Not real Irish in that case eh)

cheers! see you at the pub and ill sing you down if challenged to show
in strength of Spirit!
