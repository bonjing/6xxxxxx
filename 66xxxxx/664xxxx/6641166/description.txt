[DESCRIPTION.]:
A decade after the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in
New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, the Conspiracy
Files looks at why some people still question what really
happened on 9/11. Conspiracy theories continue to evolve
and now question every aspect of the official account. Why,
they ask, was the hole in the Pentagon so small? Why did the
World Trade Centre buildings collapse as if being demolished
by explosives? Why did one skyscraper fall when it was never
hit by a plane? And why was the world's greatest military
power so unprepared and so slow to react when warnings
had been received?
The death of Osama Bin Laden might have been expected to
put an end to the conspiracy theories, but the failure to
release any pictures of Bin Laden's death and the hasty
disposal of his body in the Arabian Sea, has instead given
these theories a new burst of life.
Featuring key witnesses, CIA and FBI interviewees and
leading sceptics, the programme analyses the evidence and
looks at what makes conspiracy theories so persistent and so
powerful.
