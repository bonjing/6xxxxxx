Developers Andres Ã–man, the project leader behind Showtime - Home Theater System,
and Red Squirrel, the one who brings us all the unofficial builds while we wait for an
official release, are back at it again and giving us new official and unofficial builds. While
no official announcement has been made about v3.1.203 from lonelycoder.com , we have
included the latest v3.1.208 changelog from the PS3 Showtime Repack.
