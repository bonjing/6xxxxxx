,jawick,2011-09-04T19:04Z,Thanks for this and OLTL!!!
,ninjasource,2011-09-05T06:26Z,"preempt? what does it mean?

do u mean that you will quit making ups of B&B?

your uploads are extremely qualitative and thanks for everything you have done during the years! :-)

but if youre finished with B&B this is a really sad day :-(

kind regards / Ninjasource"
,tinnaheimis,2011-09-05T22:03Z,"Hi, thx for the uploads! I remember you saying something about upping dec 2009 episodes, is that right?"
[V],ClaudiaZ,2011-09-06T13:38Z,"Don't worry ninjasource! Preempted means no B&B episode was aired on Monday. But I will keep posting it, no worries! Thanks you all for your words, anyway!

@tinnaheimis, yeah, I re-shared them some months ago when someone asked me to."
