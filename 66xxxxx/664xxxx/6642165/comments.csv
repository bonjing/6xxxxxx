[V],Iznogoud9,2011-08-31T13:23Z,"You're welcome. My internet connection can be a little iffy at times, but now I'm having reasonably good upload speed (~250 kb/s). I will seed until there are other seeders.

Darn, 'Edit' is 'temporarily disabled.' I forgot to put French in languages, Eddie performed 'Dress To Circle' in Paris in French."
,barrygateaux,2011-08-31T22:09Z,"think all eddie izzard fans know about the show he did in french. 
been wanting to see how that show went. often heard about it, but never had a chance to see it 'til now.

merci!"

,drako314,2011-11-07T04:48Z,"The quality varies but some of these are really old so to be expected,
also coming from 1080 hi def screen PoV.
A=10
V=6-8

But the sound is great some have subtitles but these just need to be turned off. 
As always Eddie is hilarious and i recommend this as it is a very complete collection of his shows."
