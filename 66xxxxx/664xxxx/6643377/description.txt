I cannot imagine anything as uniquely beautiful as Yanni's live at The Acropolis
to move the Human spirit and inspire it towards real joy of the heart 
with greatest passion towards the kind of human achievement which
comes from being willing to allow for the spirit to flourish and thrive
in real sense of inner beauty of existence.

Here are all ten tracks from the Album in 320k bitrate - easily convertible
for your ipod if neccessary - or we'll post a 128k or 160k or even a 192k
folder separately if there is a request to do so
