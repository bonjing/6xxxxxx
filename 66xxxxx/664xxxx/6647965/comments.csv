,redback38,2011-09-05T03:36Z,@mbmalone....Theyre in no particular order and not in folders but im sure youll work out where to put them......16 bit dos support requires an xp install disk and modify the script to look for the drive letter for your dvd drive so it knows where to look....other than that they pretty much have all needed files encoded in the script.the williams files go in additional files(add all builds folder)and requires the java script and the custon willaims script to bring it all togetherthe atari stuff is all encoded inside the script and just requires you to run the scripts.any dramas?.....let me know:-)
,mbmalone,2011-09-05T16:21Z,"I downloaded the whole thing and saved the note you wrote. It was working fine on my HP. I will try to combine your files with my own project. ... and it is really cool to be able to play a game during a long spyware scan, that is no joke. :-)"
