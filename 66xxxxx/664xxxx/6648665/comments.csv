,barron3916,2011-09-04T03:18Z,@ DexterIdolizer.......download vlc media player do a google search for it its free!! NEVER PLAY DOWNLOADED MOVIES IN WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER!!!!
,ArtieT,2011-09-04T09:05Z,"As Barron says, you must try VLC or another media player. Sometimes only one will work. Three good ones to have are:  

VLC

KMPlayer

Media Player Classic Home Cinema (sometimes works when the first two don't)

Hope this helps!"
