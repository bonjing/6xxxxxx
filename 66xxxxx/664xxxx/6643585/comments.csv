,burt007,2011-09-01T08:11Z,Thanks a lot madushatissera you are the man. Much much appreciated.
,burt007,2011-09-01T08:31Z,"The watermark is not watermark, watermarks are usually transparent this one is more than that. But still it is a start (better than nothing). There is a software called calibre and it is free to download and can connect to your kindle also can remove DRM (digital rights management) and convert to any format without watermark, (pdf too) if you have energy to do this, Please. I know I may be asking a little too much but the amount of people who havebeen searching for this books for years will really appreciate this.
Thanks "
,madushatissera,2011-09-01T11:05Z,"first of all, tnx :)
I used a software called kindle pc converter v4, but i only have a demo version of it, that version leaves that ugly thing after converting. Calibre is less useful, it converts without a watermark or something, but the page set up is so bad, so it is hard to read the text."
,paxtonfettel,2011-09-02T22:50Z,"Guys, like you, I'm tired of searching for the All-in-One book. And I'm not paying to buy DRM removing software, can't even find the darned software in piratebay. I found THIS instead, and this is awesome - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5580017/C_Programming_A_Modern_Approach"
,burt007,2011-09-03T09:34Z,"paxtonfettel, That book is not same, but that is besides the point. Also DRM removal software doesn't work unless you have purchased the book and if you have kindle hardware. I have tried and it doesn't work. You have to have serial no. and a valid e-mail address and pid number as well in order for it to work. But thanks for pointing to this book, I am downloading it, take care."
,madushatissera,2011-09-03T15:35Z,"it seems good paxtonfettel, tnx!!!"
,burt007,2011-09-06T08:11Z,"Ohh I really wish I could open the otherone C all in one desk reference for dummies for Kindle. It doesn't open in PC using Kindle for windows. If some one can remove DRM (digital right management) and re-save it as mobi or something else, I will really appreciate it. Here is the link for that torrent.

Thanks"
,blik22,2011-09-06T18:18Z,"please madushatissera convert the ebook with calibre, because this watermark covers a lot of useful information :( an ebook hard to read better then unreadable at all! so pleaseeeeeee we're waitting.... "
,burt007,2011-09-07T09:04Z,"I agree with blick22, I know it may be a bit of trouble for you, but it can be done. Or remove DRM from the book you uploaded for kindle and turn it to mobi format.

I tried to remove that stamp in pdf, downloaded atleast three software but cannot figure it out how to remove that stamp.

Thanks."
,hopbest,2011-11-08T16:50Z,"madushatissera thanks for Ur upload but it is very hard to understand the content with bold red watermark. 

not worth to download unless until watermark is there. please do something to make it more readable."
,burt007,2011-11-25T06:55Z,"madushatissera is gone from this scene, he is no longer available."
,madushatissera,2011-11-25T17:32Z,"sorry, i can't find a crack for my kindle pc converter, so there is no way to remove that stamp"
,burt007,2011-12-04T08:15Z,Where can I send you that crack? Give me an address.
,burt007,2011-12-05T07:31Z,"If you are kind enough of sharing the serial no. of Kindle for pc, we may be able to open the kindle book or do something with it. In any case this book is nowhere to be found on the net, and since you have purchased it you can open it and many things can be done with it, even screen capture by pressing print screen button and turning it to jpeg is possible, of course this is a long process but......Please do something."
,chessie-james,2012-02-04T21:10Z,"You dont need the serial for his Kindle, you need the PID for the book, then you can remove the DRM. There are also other tools to remove the DRM, but only madushatissera can do it!! Thanks for the effort matey."
,burt007,2012-02-28T08:22Z,I hope he provides PID for this and than we can remove this ugly mark. So if you ever read this madushatissera please provde PID and maybe we can do something with this. This book is not available anywhere else.
,johncf,2012-04-13T07:35Z,Maybe we should make a group buy. Buy the book and remove the DRM ourselves.
