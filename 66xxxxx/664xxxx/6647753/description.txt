PLOT SUMMARY:   

This is the story of "E" Easy Company, 506th Regiment of the 101st 
Airborne Division from their initial training starting in 1942 to 
the end of World War II. They parachuted behind enemy lines in the 
early hours of D-Day in support of the landings at Utah beach, 
participated in the liberation of Carentan and again parachuted 
into action during Operation Market Garden. They also liberated a 
concentration camp and were the first to enter Hitler's mountain 
retreat in Berchtesgarten. A fascinating tale of comradeship that is, 
in the end, a tale of ordinary men who did extraordinary things.
