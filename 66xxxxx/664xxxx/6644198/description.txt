Eric Sardinas and Big Motor â€“ Sticks & Stones [2011]

August 30, 2011

When your band is called Big Motor and your instrument of choice is an electrified resonator you just know that Eric Sardinas isnt going to be your regular rock musician. On Sticks & Stones he revels in his own idiosyncratic rootsy approach which is based around pouring all his energy, emotions and visceral spontaneity into 11 intense songs that make this album his best yet.
Eric has for long been a one man link between traditional down home southern roots music and explosive contemporary rock blues. But more than that, he delves into the traditions of the past and reconditions them for the present but looks to the future for his own take on southern fried rock & roll. Sticks & Stones is the kind of barnstorming roots rock album that rides rough shod overâ€¦
