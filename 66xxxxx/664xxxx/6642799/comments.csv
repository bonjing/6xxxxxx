[T],karaokeking123,2011-09-01T16:56Z,"to be honest, im not to sure why myself.
the adobe file was 15mb i thought it was a large file.i then converted it into mobi using calibre wich took about 35mins to do.it was only when i stated to u/l i noticed how big the file was.if someone has already downloaded this into kindle,i would very much like to know if it is readable,please let me know,thanks."

,prush242,2011-09-01T19:53Z,"Same here, it seems to be a popular download, but I only got 98.7% of it. D'oh!!

karaokeking123: well done!

If you want to email me the zipped .pdf at rush (the number ""3"" here without paren) at msn dot come, I can try re-converting it with caliber."
,prush242,2011-09-01T20:07Z,"OK, got 100%"
[T],karaokeking123,2011-09-01T20:20Z,"i am reseeding this,but just had a thought,just d/l the adobe file (15mb)then convert useing calibre"
,prush242,2011-09-01T21:35Z,"Tried converting to mobi. Calibre wants to do the mobi as a series of pictures, that's why it gets so big--each page is a picture. Try it without pics, and you get three pages.

Anyone have any idea how to get around this issue?"
,th-mach,2011-09-03T00:29Z,"The PDF has an OCR layer, so you need to export the document to a reflowable format (like HTML), then convert to MOBI. You would probably want to do it with Acrobat Pro, then edit/proofread the result, then convert in Calibre. The proofing process will no doubt be a big job. If the quality of the original OCR isn't that great, you might want to re-OCR the images in Abbyy. (I.e., export the pages as images using Acrobat, then OCR the images with Abbyy.)

Or just read the damn PDF."
