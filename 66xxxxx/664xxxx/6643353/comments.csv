Anyone know how I should fix this, or should I just download SKIDROW's?"

,fallout11,2011-09-18T21:46Z,"No problems with install or running here, played it to about halfway through before the grind became too monotonous.  Puzzles and thought are mostly gone replaced with senseless lengthy boss fights and random difficulty spikes. Hate to say it, but I agree with the blogs/reviewers that say they've run Deathspank into the ground.  Quit and uninstalled it.
