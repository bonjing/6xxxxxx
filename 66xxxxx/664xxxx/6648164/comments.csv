,wikidesi,2012-02-01T10:54Z,"Using this software Central instance and database instance cannot be installed on 32-bit OS, from SR3 only dialog instance can be installed on 32-bit OS. If u have installation master of version before SR3 (SR2 which supports 32-bit), you can use the exports from this software."
