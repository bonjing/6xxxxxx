Description:

"ROOTS is not a magazine about the game Deus Ex. It does not give you any clues to the solution of the labyrinthine mysteries of Deus Ex. Instead, it unearths the game's cultural roots. 

Everything has an origin, a history. The world of Deus Ex is no exception, drawing from a multitude of sources. The history of art, technology and philosophy flows through it. ROOTS explores the elements and ideas that have contributed to the DNA of Deus Ex."
