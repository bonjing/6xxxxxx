,brickz1,2011-10-05T10:23Z,"Audio: 8
The only problem with the audio is at certain parts of the movie the lip sync seems to be a little off causing it to briefly look like old Japanese horror film back in the black and white movie days.
Video: 9
Video is amazing, only a few blurry points, this is freaking great for a movie that hasnt even been released on DVD yet."
