,OOKell,2011-09-04T11:09Z,"I am just wondering, why is this file 350MB when the last VTV upload was 550MB?  Isn't 550 better for BBC shows which tend to run longer than other networks?"

,lister888,2011-09-04T14:35Z,@buketsful Slight over-reaction. I'm thinking Bantha-Poodoo is trolling a bit.
,1stand15th,2011-09-04T15:13Z,"Woah there buksetsful, way to make all Brits seem like fools.

If you've inhabited the internet for any short period of time you should have come across the word 'troll' before..."
,Vastiny,2011-09-04T15:51Z,"Bantha-Poodoo is just a troll, I've seen him on various other torrents aswell, he's just the same. Just ignore him people."
,crazykats,2011-09-04T16:57Z,@buketsful: also english is germanic based technically which means that the brits changed the language first. ;) you got a lil too angry there
,systemrooterrr,2011-09-04T18:01Z,"Dont feed the trolls! lol 

@ VTV, many thanks!
great quality for HDTV"
,elsmeghead,2011-09-04T20:29Z,"Bantha-PooDoo was also slagging off Torchwood on its most recent torrent saying its full of ""pooves"". I think he gets some perverse pleasure from dissing anything by Russel T Davies. We reckon bantha is a closet homosexual desperately trying to suppress his own gay urges in a world that he's afraid won't accept him."
,Openmind1,2011-09-04T21:03Z,MANY TANKS!

[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-11T21:49Z,"After 2 amazing episodes, this one bored the ever living shit out of me, Made up by Ep10 though :)"
,edetech,2011-09-17T17:09Z,A bit predictable if you are also a fan of old Twilight Zone series. ;)
