Ponthan Mada is a 1994 Malayalam film written and directed by T. V. Chandran. The film stars Mammootty and Naseeruddin Shah. It is based on two short stories, Ponthan Mada and Sheema Thampuran by C. V. Sreeraman. Set in the 1940s British India, the film is about the irrational bonding of the low-caste Ponthan Mada (Mammootty) with his colonial landlord Sheema Thampuran (Naseeruddin Shah), who was expelled to British India from England during his youth for supporting the Irish Republican Army. Crossing the class boundaries, the two communicate through Thampuran's window with Mada hanging from a palm tree.
