,wolftone1916,2011-09-12T23:55Z,Seriously this many seeders and one comment?
,mot6,2011-09-14T18:50Z,howz the quality of video?
,Psyclerk,2011-09-16T05:19Z,"Garbage video quality. The other torrent I tried had a lot of static-like noise/artifacts in the video. This rip tries to smooth them out but only makes the whole thing blurry. As I said in the other torrent, this would be ok for someone who just wants to see what the movie is about, but for this film, you need high quality video due to the importance of the visuals.

Nice try, uploader, but this one won't fly. Thanks for the effort though, glad someone is trying to get this movie out there."
