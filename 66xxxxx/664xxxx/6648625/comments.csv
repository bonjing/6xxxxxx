stronghold will be released at the end of september :P ur a little too early."
[T],TalmudTimmy,2011-09-05T08:27Z,This was a stupid movie. Weak plot and crappy ending. Stephen King has lost it...not that he was great to begin with.
,dubblue,2011-09-05T17:26Z,thank you
,anashe,2011-09-05T17:49Z,"dont ask stupid questions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,hs etremezone ever uploaded shit quality????????"

Great quality rip. However the movie isn't really that great. For a horror flick, there isn't much horror. And as a fan of the COTC films, i really feel like this movie lacked depth. Characters are underdeveloped and the movie is too short. Doesn't have much of a story at all. Sad."
,Biglez,2011-09-06T23:01Z,This film sux big donkyballs! Worst crap ever made in the CoC series...watch it if youre a big fan of CoC...otherwise its just a waste of time!

,ozwick,2011-09-07T18:21Z,Read the cover dipshits. It's based on CoC which means it's just some hollywood piece of shit sequel they've pumped out based on the sales figures of the other films. Stephen King didn't even write this HURR DURR
,geeman777,2011-09-07T19:07Z,"I was a fan of the 1st film but they have gradually got shitter and then this one comes out and proves anything will pass for a film these days. don't bother wasting your time, you'll regret it big time. or just watch it if your that big a fan, at least i can say ""i told you so"". good quality as always."
,read7,2011-09-09T01:03Z,"just skimmed threw it on my nero player and its real clear, good sound seems like a 10-10....thankx"
,s3xt0y,2011-09-09T01:53Z,"@TalmudTimmy
It's based on the story by stephen king its not actually made by him."
,954blade,2011-09-09T14:48Z,Thanks ez.
,nDALLAS,2011-09-09T21:34Z,"dude amir, do you know extremezone, does he owe you a favor you dumbass? NO, don't ask stupid questions. Yes, there are such things as stupid questions, and you are full of 'em. Mayybe you should try something like, ""hey bro have you ever played stronghold I hear it's good"" and let the man do what he wishes. Otherwise shut it! HAH i love being mean to stupid people via comments on this! That is wrong isn't it? Perfect rip!"
,ashen77,2011-09-10T20:46Z,"nDALLAS: There are such things as stupid people to, and your one of em'.  Please die.

This movie is aweful. The original was bad enough, but this takes it to new levels. Stephen King is a terrible writter. I think he became popular because a 5 year old can read and understand his stuff. Not that he had anything to do with this pile of shit.

X, you are the bollocks!"
