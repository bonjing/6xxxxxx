The blurb says you will need 1650mb to run this but the file is only 188.75mb. Looks like a lot of the content is missing making it a waste of time. "

The game works fine for me. I always CHECK before uploading the torrent.

So its simply a small  matter of configuring your PC.

Hope this helps :)

[T],Hyperdrive25,2011-09-20T12:43Z,"I have been playing this game for some time now and I have never noticed the above mentioned error. This is a small sized rip of the game for persons with low download speeds.

I have found out that the full version is more than 1Gb. I may upload the larger version in the days to come....

Thanks for bearing with me and my sincerest apologies for any inconvenience given."

,Night_Cat,2012-05-22T06:52Z,"He's dim, Jed.

Chess Master installed okay, but when I tried to play a game, it kept giving me an error message - Failed to attach personality.

Coincidentally, that's also what happened when George W. Bush was born.

This is pointless. It doesn't work. Don't bother.

I have a Thinkpad with Windows XP (32 bit) and service pack 2."
