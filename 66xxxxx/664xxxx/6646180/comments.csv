,blumacaw,2011-09-04T15:05Z,"@srikar: Just leave it alright...... You don't make any sense. Are you a kid?
The extended version is just 6 minutes longer. 
Talking to you is a waste of time. Just don't talk about this harry potter anymore. "
,blumacaw,2011-09-04T15:06Z,@ilocano68: I think its megui. 
,srikar9,2011-09-05T11:01Z,"@blumacaw
did i ask u? mind your own business."
,blumacaw,2011-09-06T10:25Z,"@MRShanku: Bro, a friendly piece of advice, ignore this srikar9. He/she's just a damn kid who knows nothing about encoding, uploading and related stuff. "
,srikar9,2011-09-06T10:58Z,"@blumacaw and @mrshanku
