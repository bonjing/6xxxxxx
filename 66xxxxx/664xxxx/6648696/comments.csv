Is this real stereoscopic 3D, the kind that's on 3D Blu-Rays?

Or is it anaglyph (the crappy red and blue glasses)?

Thanks guys"

Sorry lol. So it is like 3D Blu-Rays?

Thanks. Something to test if i get a 3d monitor:P"
,fdhypno,2011-10-09T17:13Z,"What program should I play BD-isos in? I've tried mounting it with first PowerISO then when that did not work, I tried Daemon-Tools which worked just as well. I imagined the mounted copy would act like any normal DVD, and I would be able to play it as a virtual disc in my media player. I could not. I tried VLC, WMP and Winamp, which are the ones I use for any other media, but all of them gave me a little explanatory answer that this disc was created in a way that the media player couldn't handle. I also tried opening the file directly into VLC, which works for some DVD's although it is seriously slow. It was loaded, but after stating the length was about 650 hours, it just stopped the playback.

So after this long adventure I am asking you which program I am supposed to watch DVD's in. I am certain that since this torrent has a high demand, and was in fact uploaded by somebody ""Very Important"", and the comments still do not mention anything like my problem, it is not this file that is bad/broken, but either the programs I use or how I use them.

Thanks for your help in advance."

,beschoenen,2012-01-06T00:45Z,is this sbs? (side by side)
,rogertw,2012-02-19T11:52Z,"Nope, this is not 3D. Not stereoscopic, not even red and green. 

It is nice quality, very soft porn with attractive model type women pretending to play with each other and themselves.

If you like hot babes, HD quality and don't want anything more than a video playboy type experience, this is a good torrent.

If you want 3D or anything a bit harder, don't waste your bandwidth ;)"
