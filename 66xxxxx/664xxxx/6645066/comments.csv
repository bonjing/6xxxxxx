What a shame!!!!See the criminals Karaxhic and Mladic who are behind the bars. They will have the same fate as Milosavic. They will die like dogs in jail. They have deserved it.
For those who want to see this ""documentary"", I'd recommend to see this link before:

,andoroo,2011-09-03T16:46Z,"@noniboy, from article Ratko Mladic Arrest: the Uses and Hypocrisy of U.N. â€œGenocideâ€ Read the damn thing 
â€œYasushi Akashi, former UN Representative in Bosnia, admitted in the Washington Times of 1 November 1995, that â€œit is a fact that the Bosnian government forces have used the â€˜safe areasâ€™ of not only Srebrenica, but Sarajevo, Tuzla, Bihac, Gorazde for training, recuperation and refurbishing their troops.â€ In other words, the so-called safe areas were used as military posts to train Mujahedin fighters from Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, Turkey and the entire Islamic world, free to commit their treachery by attacking Serbian villages and returning like thieves in the night back to the safety of their UN protectors who conveniently looked the other way to these violations. Prior to the events at Srebrenica, these â€œHoly Warriors of Islamâ€ had attacked 42 surrounding Serbian villages and over 3,000 Serbian villagers had been slaughtered without fear of being reprimanded or punished by the UN.  Yet, when Serbs were provoked to retaliate against these Muslim assaults from these so-called â€œsafe-areas,â€ they were condemned by the entire world."
