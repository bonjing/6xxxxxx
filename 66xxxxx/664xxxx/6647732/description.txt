This group is a "must have" for every warm blooded human being
to enjoy and experience in their walk on the planet - equally speaking!

This 1994 CD did include the great song "escucha me" which
was their most well done as original - 320k for your disco type power amp too!

You should, in fact, have all their best stuff - and that's mainly
pretty much all they do - across the board - They are among my favorites
along with Yanni - for a different effect - yet Euro humanly vibrant even 
more are both groups offerings!

enjoy!
