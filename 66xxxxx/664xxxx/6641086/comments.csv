Could you please post more PADI videos? :)"
[T],scuba-doo,2011-08-31T01:26Z,"i would appreciate itif not every upload i make gets spammed about ""uploading PADI videos"" i have previously mentioned that i am not at home and have said the PADI videos will come as soon as i get home to upload them. It will be 2-3weeks to just relax.

Patience is a virtue 

thank you."
,huvudverk,2011-08-31T19:19Z,"Hehe, didn't mean to nag, I have browsed a lot of your torrents and haven't seen that discussion.

Looking forward to your future PADI-posts.

A big hug from me to you. :=)
