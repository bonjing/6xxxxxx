Claps for Caroline is six piece band from TÃ¶rÃ¶kszentmiklÃ³s, Hungary. 
â€œ- Who is Caroline? - Who is she?â€
Everybody ask these important questions for usâ€¦so let see the answer.
â€œClapping: Producing sound for applause or other purposes.
For: A preposition.
Caroline: Caroline or Carolyne is a given name for women. It is a feminine form of Charles.â€ 
So, first of all: we love music. Our is core-based, but not metal-core at all.A little bit more melodic.
Just try to mix some other genres e.g.: disco,pop,etc. and youâ€™ll get issue. Thatâ€™s correct! 

We also love hard things like breakdowns, screams. So, you can find your music-style in our music. Band was formed in 2010 april.
