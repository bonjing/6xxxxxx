[T],IceBane,2011-09-02T06:06Z,"Some People ask me why i do my screens smaller then then the movie.

Well there are reasons for that.
I Upload to about 16 different sites and not all of them will do Thumbs properly and others wont do full size properly. and then there is bandwidth issues to consider. 
also you should never judge a moving image from a still picture as there will always. that is why we at the kingdom always include a Sample of the video. "
