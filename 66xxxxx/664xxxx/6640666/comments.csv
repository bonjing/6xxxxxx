Unfortunately haing watched the first disk I found out that the quality isn't the best (but is very watchable) and the Dutch subtitles are hardcoded for the 2nd episode on each disk. it looks like it may have been a pirate copy itself ;-) Anyway I'm going to return them to the place I bought them and get another version that hopefully is much better quality. if your Dutch then you won't mind. but having hardcoded subs for every 2nd episode really pisses me off"
