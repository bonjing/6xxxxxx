I've already uploaded 14GB in about 10 hours, but I can't upload a 121GB large torrent on my own.
Try to upload as much as you can, and at least try to get a ratio of 1."

,youfreaker,2011-10-14T21:05Z,"@Rin- Sorry, I already stopped uploading this torrent. I'm uploading One Piece and Naruto (shippuuden) episodes at the same time. And because I already reached a ratio of 10, I paused this torrent so I could upload Naruto and Shippuuden. I just unpaused this torrent.
Please actually keep seeding when you finished the download"
