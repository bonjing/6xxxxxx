The Four Seasons by Italy's Antonio Vivaldi has always been a greatest
favorite of my classical choices. Perhaps even the best - although I have
some Bach Chopin and Beethoven pieces that are equally on the same list.

I have always best liked the renditions by the Italian group I. Musici - 
often found on the Philips Label (Holland). We are be posting that for 
you too - both in video (already posted) and mp3 formats.

For this particular torrent, we offer the Academy of Ancient Music 
featuring Conductor Christopher Hogwood doing this great piece some
kind of justice in their fair efforts too equally I'm sure

For those who like this work so much that they wouldn't
want to miss out on hearing different renditions that are in the main
popular, help yourselves here too certainly!
