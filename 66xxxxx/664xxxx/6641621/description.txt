Description......: This two-hour special goes inside the history of the second most used illicit drug in America. The human 
                   appetite for this narcotic goes all the way back to 3000 B.C., when South Americans chewed coca leaves, 
                   thinking they were a gift from God. But it wasn't until 1855, when cocaine was first extracted from the coca 
                   leaf and used in powder form that its use spiked. Initially it was utilized as an anesthesia. Soon, famed 
                   psychologist Sigmund Freud touted it as an effective cure for depression and impotence. In 1886, John 
                   Pemberton, an Atlanta pharmacist, added it to his new soft drink: Coca Cola or Coke for short. In 1914, the 
                   drug was outlawed, but the damaged had been done. The 70's ushered in another boost in the drug's use, 
                   fueled in part by new drug cartels in South America. To combat cocaine's rise, the Reagan administration 
                   started the War on Drugs in the 80's.
