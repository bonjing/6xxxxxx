I am a longtime supporter and would greatly appreciate screenshotcompare pics just to see."

like evreting in the FASM
but i aspected to see HAPPY FEET DOULOGI in the FASM rip because in my opinian is the best qulity.
I love HAPPY FEET and my child she loved.
i cant belive whay  nobody not converted in FASM FOR PS3.Is the best movie for children, and for us.
I just hope is not just my request , i belive is a lot of people how want to see this movie in the best quality ( FASM - PS3 ) And i hope sombody it will encode for PS3 SOON.          "
