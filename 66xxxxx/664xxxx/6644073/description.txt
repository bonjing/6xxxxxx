Gandalf the Grey gives his life in battle against the Balrog, giving the Fellowship of the Ring time to escape. Weeks later, Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee continue their journey to Mordor to destroy the Ring. At night they are attacked by Gollum who seeks the Ring for himself. Frodo and Samwise capture Gollum, but Frodo takes pity on him, understanding the burden of the ring. Requiring a guide, Frodo persuades Gollum to lead them to Mordor. In Rohan, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli pursue the Uruk-hai who have taken Merry and Pippin prisoner. Meanwhile, King ThÃ©oden has been entranced by GrÃ­ma Wormtongue, who is secretly in the service of Saruman. Incited by Saruman, Orcs and Wild Men of Dunland, lay siege to the lands. Ã‰omer accused GrÃ­ma of being a spy and is banished for undermining him. Ã‰omer sets forth to the countryside to gather the remaining loyal men of the Rohirrim. Ã‰omer's army later ambush and kill the Uruk-hai holding Merry and Pippin. Merry and Pippin flee into the forest and meet Treebeard, the oldest of the Ents.
