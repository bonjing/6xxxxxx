Hurry Up, We're Dreaming is the sixth studio album by French dream pop project M83 (and their first double LP), following 2008's Saturdays = Youth. It includes lead single "Midnight City," which received the Best New Music stamp from Pitchfork, as well as an intro track featuring Zola Jesus. It's set to release on October 18, 2011.
