Am I missing something?"

,popay100,2012-02-26T18:01Z,presets is not fixed :((((
,abelard33,2012-04-30T07:09Z,"The Team Dynamic installer doesn't work quite right, at least not on Lion. No presets are present, and the standalone program crashes almost all the time. The VST is functional, but you have to build all your presets from scratch. Tried loading them from another computer---no help. Restoring defaults and scanning does not help."
