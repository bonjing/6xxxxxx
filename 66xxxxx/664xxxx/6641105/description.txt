The Four Seasons by Italy's Antonio Vivaldi has always been a greatest
favorite of my classical choices. Perhaps even the best - although I have
some Bach Chopin and Beethoven pieces that are equally on the same list.

I have always best liked the renditions by the Italisn group I. Musici - often found on the Philips Label (Holland). We are be posting that for you too
- both in video and mp3 formats.

This time around we bring you a lovely audio rendition equally by 
Il Giardino Armonico, Conducted by Giovanni Antonini at 192k bitrate
as we prefer it for this type of material - There is a 320k torrent of this
CD we found here earlier today so feel free to experiment if you wish.
Please note we didnt see a note indicating what was part of the Four Seasons
and what was extra bonus material on the other torrent I make mention to,
however we have separated the tracks for you to avoid confusion - especially
for those new to this material!
