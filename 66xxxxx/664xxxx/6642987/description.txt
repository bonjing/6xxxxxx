Enjoy one of the greatest pieces of music ever - Vivaldi's The Four Seasons
in a jazzed up rendition that is a bit of a stretch at times, however its actually
quite nicely done and well worth having even if you already have I. Musici or Sir
Neville Marriner doing the traditional rendition for you - as you certainly should
in the first place too!
