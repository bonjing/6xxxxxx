,eNdEmiOn06463,2011-08-31T22:44Z,"Indeed! This is bad, really bad. It kinda pisses me of as they mess with the ""not another"" concept and then put up this crap instead. "
,RobTortureWright,2011-08-31T23:51Z,"I'm Astonished that good or decent actors like Burt Reynolds and Vinnie Jones agreed to this piece of shit film, i mean why would you agree to star in a film after reading a script that a 5 year old kid could write better jokes into ? clearly they must have been paid LOTS of cash and have decided to ruin their career by doing this, good luck wasting 99 minutes of your life.
