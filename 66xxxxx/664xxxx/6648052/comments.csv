,Crinsom_Thorn,2011-09-03T22:07Z,Serial is invalid.
,geekcat,2011-09-03T23:52Z,"The serial is fine - I am burning a DVD right now from a downloaded avi file. (use Nero Vision Xtra)

You need to make sure that you have copied the whole key - it's long.
Don't open the program or configure it before you replace the dll.

Thanks, S4A - works like a charm!"
[V],scene4all,2011-09-04T16:55Z,"Hmm, looks like the serial.txt got fucked up, can someone clarify this for me? Its actually 2 separate keys they start with 9X and they are both 8 blocks, but for some reason i see both the keys are 2gether (all in one line). So remember this, the first key starts with 9X and ends with 9C, and the second key starts with 9X and ends with TH."
,marlpz,2011-09-04T20:30Z,"I got one serial only. 9X*******TH and no 9c

But serail is not valad in order to download the third party software required to run the ""Recorde"" video converter."
,mvc123,2011-09-05T03:04Z,"scene4all, I was totally dumbfounded until you posted the answer, you are right, i used the first serial and it worked beautifully.   Thankyou"
,dynamiel,2011-09-05T15:17Z,"scene4all, the serial text file has been formatted with unix newlines, no returns. In Notepad it looks like 1 line.
I suggest to open the serial text file with Wordpad, or use Damn NFO Viewer."

,cwgate,2011-09-18T09:37Z,"Deleted it all and downloaded again.  This time gets past ""Extracting"" phase and asks for serial which is OK then it fails later because it can't find Data1.cab. Is this file corrupted?"

I appreciate the heads up for opening up the serial in word pad.I would have never got it.
Thanks buddy, your number one in my book."
,jubcheng,2011-09-23T10:18Z,....... is it possible to use the Patent Activation Crack on other versions as well other than Nero Multimedia Suite Platinum HD 10.6.11800 ?
,crazysoccerman14,2011-09-23T17:30Z,"Fuck the uploader.

Are you too fucking stupid to not know how to separate serials?

Also, I cannot find the nero folder within the common files folder.

But now I have 15 different programs to uninstall :D

THANKS AGAIN"
,cuddlycowey,2011-09-24T08:31Z,"Seriously I agree with the guy above me... why is this program stealing 4 gigs from my harddrive yet i cant seem to find any files for it. i even ran a search and nothing comes up... i had all this space then after i tried to install it took up all this space but is nowhere to be found

uploader if you could plz help me get this shit off my computer i will pay you"
,fonejacker13,2011-09-25T04:09Z,"I got the 'cab1' problem too. Win7 64Bit (fresh install).

,jujubead,2011-09-25T05:57Z,want install all files magicaly bout 4 gib dissapered cant find it anywhere... serial dont work tried different ways and nothing will reformat my hard drive after downloading this so be wise it sounds good but save yourself the time it want work upon fiest install it then installs bout 7-10 different programs on top of the normal dowload SOMETHING FISHY DONT DONT DOWNLOAD
,Franpa,2011-09-27T11:18Z,"This crack worked like a charm, just copy the DLL file to the correct folder along with the BAT file, execute the BAT file and done. Works fine with the serial number that this crack injects into the registry too http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6640543/Nero_10.6.11300_patch_only_WORKS

Oh and lastly, with the BAT file you'll want to edit it with Notepad and change it to read regsvr32 ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Nero\AdvrCntr5\AdvrCntr5.dll"" for x64 users and regsvr32 C:\Program Files\Common Files\Nero\AdvrCntr5\AdvrCntr5.dll"" for x86 users. (With the quotes! and ran as administrator)"
,Scorpio975,2011-09-30T08:36Z,Serial does not work. Cannot transplant .dll if the program will not install and the crack program doesn't work either.

,xExekut3x,2011-10-02T21:39Z,"Question about programs like this: I followed the instructions to the tee, and it appears to work fine. Is it safe to use this program while I have an active internet connection? I disabled the Nero Update service. Is it OK to update it? I just always have this nagging thought in the back of my mind that programs like this send out frames to their servers alerting them of suspicious or illegal activity. Should I be worried?"

Not so sound like an ass but if you are Downloading this stuff you don't really care about whether or not you should be ""worried""  if you are then don't use it.. I myself would not be worried. you can always shut off updates if you want "

Thank you for putting up with the rude idiots."
,freverambr,2011-10-13T22:05Z,"Yep; does work, very simple to install - copy and overwrite a file and away we go ---

BUT; it is a bit unstable and fairly regularly gives an error message that it is unable to complete the task right at the end of the burn process and aborts the copy.

Trying to find out why.

I may go back to N10 normal edition which NEVER gave any problems at all."
,bax666,2011-10-14T13:48Z,GREAT!!! tHANKS

,McGunt,2011-11-01T16:59Z,NERO really need to get their shit together. On previous paid & legit versions their own serials & activations don't even work. This is why we do what we do
,McGunt,2011-11-01T17:01Z,They also make me want to kill puppies!
,lonewolf1,2011-11-02T01:49Z,This completely destroyed my Vista PC. I could not recover or repair the damage it did to my registry. Could not get through to system restore or safe mode or even repair off a Vista Disc. In the end I had to rebuild from scratch but this time i put on Win 7.
,SwedishMeatball,2011-11-16T05:49Z,"Thank you for the great upload.

Great download speed. Done in 10 minutes. Thank you seeders! I returned the favor and seeded to 200%.

Installed under Windows 7 Ultimate x64.

The install did not work the first two times. Halted with error ""Cab1.??? corrupted or missing"". The 3rd time I installed, I used XP sp2 compatibility settings. After it installed the ""Boot Validator"" made me reboot, which it did not do the 1st & 2nd times. It completed the install APPARANTLY properly after the reboot.

As I wanted to be able to run this in native Windows 7, I uninstalled everything and disabled the the compatability settings, so it installed in native Windows 7 mode. I also opened the x64 regitry items file in the crack folder using the registry editor. It said the registry entries were added. Rebooted and ran the install again. It did not force a reboot after the ""Boot Validator"" installed, and seemed to complete the install properly.

I am not really sure what made the differences.

This program will not open dvd-video compliations that I made with the other newer version of nero that I tried first, which would not load some avi files. It said that I needed to update, because the compilations were made with a newer version.

I did try to update. I did not get flagged as a pirated copy. However, it also said that updates were available, but did not list any programs that could be updated. Perhaps that will change the next time I try to update?

This Copy of Nero is obviously the Box version, not the download version, as it did not have to download software from the site, like the other, newer version did. 

I am in the process of burning my first DVD-video. It loaded avi files that other, newer version of Nero on here would not load. So, other than the update issue, it looks good at this point."
,SwedishMeatball,2011-11-16T06:40Z,"OK, ignore what I said about it not listing updates for me to install. It is doing so now!

Still don't know if the updates will allow me to open the compilations I had done with Nero 11. I can't update till the burn is finished."
,InnocentlyBeautifulLove,2011-11-19T21:01Z,"ok i dont see how hard it is for everyone!! I Downloaded it ,it did take a lil bit BUT... well worth it and if u all would open the serial with wordpad not notepad u would see that there are 2 diff codes!!! I used the 2nd one n everything works great! MAKE SURE U DISABLE automatic updates! If I get any probs ill let ya know but for now its workin wonderful! THANK YOU SCENE"

,porygon90,2011-12-28T21:20Z,"Even if you copy the whole string of both serials and paste it where it asks there will only be enough room to take up the first one so you kinda don't need to worry. 

Nice and easy great torrent all around."
,lionbums,2012-01-03T04:16Z,Works perfectly thanks very much!
,lionbums,2012-01-03T04:19Z,Oh crap I opened the program and forgot to copy the crack .dll! Will this make any problems in the future or is it ok that I put it in right now?
