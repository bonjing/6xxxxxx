Melanie's long awaited fifth album 'The Sea' features 10 brand new tracks, including 'Stupid Game', 'All About You' and 'Burn'. The album opens with the title track 'The Sea', which Melanie co-wrote with Richard "Biff" Stannard, who Melanie has previously worked with on 'Goin' Down' as well as various Spice Girls tracks. Melanie collaborated on the song 'Weak' with Jez Ashurst and Ina Wroldsen and it is one of Melanie's personal favourites. The closing track from the album is the epic eight minute long 'Enemy', which Melanie wrote with long serving band member Greg Hatwell.
