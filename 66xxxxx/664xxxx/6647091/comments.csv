,Cerealism,2011-09-02T19:11Z,"Aww yeahhh, seeding like a damn farmer now. I just need more seeds on your other two torrent. 5 is slow and 1-3 hasn't started at all. :("
,EMP714,2011-09-02T22:01Z,"Sorry for the slow speeds, I've been seeding all three torrents since I uploaded them :("
,ancient78,2011-09-02T22:40Z,"thank you very much for uploading part 4 , now the collection is complete :)"
,EMP714,2011-09-02T23:17Z,"@ancient78:

No problem!
I love the Geneforge series, and not having any torrents really annoyed me. I am by no means an expert, or even a novice of this torrent stuff but I learned enough to get these games out to the people who want em!"
,JakeKlein,2012-04-20T23:14Z,"Thanks! Works great. To anyone who says it's only the demo, the torrent has a key generator included that registers the copy unlocking the full game."
