"Spiderweb Software brings you Geneforge 4: Rebellion, the next chapter in their fantasy epic. Once again, return to the world of the Shapers, where you will explore a vast world, choose what side you will fight for, and create and mold your own army of strange, powerful monsters."


Geneforge 4: Rebellion features:

*Enormous world, with over 80 areas to explore.

*Choose among several sides, each with its own beliefs, cities, and quests. Help the rebels or fight them. Your choices will shape the world.

*Dozens of different endings.

*Many paths to victory. Slay your enemies or use stealth and diplomacy to outwit them. Become engrossed in the storyline or just go out and wreak havoc.

*Lots of replay value.

*Prior experience with the Geneforge series is completely unnecessary.
