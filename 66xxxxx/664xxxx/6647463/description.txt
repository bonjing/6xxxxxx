These shows were recorded at the Fillmore East on 27 & 28 February
1970 just before the release of Cricklewood Green. This double CD
of previously unreleased recordings sees the band at the peak of
their powers coming as it does between their stroming Woodstock 
appearance of 1969 and the Isle of Wight performance in late 
August 1970. (Ripped with Rubyripper on Ubuntu 11.04)
