The hard pressing sound of Aaronâ€™s Agony first spread within a microscopic town of northern Italy. 
Since the beginning in 2004â€“when they were called THE CHOICE â€“till their first demo (recorded in 2008), theyâ€™ve experimented several changes in style as well in their band composition.

Today we listen to diÃ¨â€™s biting voice perfectly blending throughout the rhythmic potency of max and johnniâ€˜s guitars, Zackâ€™s bass strings together with the energy of gabryâ€™s drums. 

A great line-up able to merge its music power and hormonality together with an original gothic-fantasy genre from which they derive their lyrics.
