Zeitgeist: Moving Forward, by director Peter Joseph, is a feature length documentary work which will 
present a case for a needed transition out of the current socioeconomic monetary paradigm which 
governs the entire world society. This subject matter will transcend the issues of cultural relativism and 
traditional ideology and move to relate the core, empirical â€œlife groundâ€ attributes of human and social 
survival, extrapolating those immutable natural laws into a new sustainable social paradigm called a 
â€œResource-Based Economyâ€. 
This ilm will feature experts in the ields of public health, anthropology, neurobiology, economics, en- 
ergy, technology, social science and other relevant subjects which relate to social operation and culture. 
The three central themes of the work are Human Behavior, Monetary Economics, and Applied Science. 
Put together the work creates a model of understanding the current social paradigm; why it is critical to 
move out of it - coupled with a new, radical, yet practical social approach based on advanced under- 
standings which would resolve the current social woes facing the world today. 
One of the unique attributes of this work, which separates it in style from most documentaries, is that it 
has a parallel dramatic/cinematic theme, with notable actors, which abstractly play out various gestures 
related to the overall message of the ilm. The work also vigorously employs numerous 2d and 3d visual 
abstracts/animations, while returning to the standard, traditional documentary orientatio
