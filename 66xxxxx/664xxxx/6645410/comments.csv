,Green-Banana,2011-10-05T19:51Z,"If this was uploaded on September 2nd, wouldn't it be missing all the September updates from the 3rd to the 30th?  Wouldn't it be more accurate to round it down to August instead of tricking people into thinking you have every September update included in this torrent?  I mean, it is kind of skeevy.  "
,SOULREAPERDRAGON,2011-10-09T06:03Z,does this have hair colors (?_?)
,Green-Banana,2011-10-09T07:54Z,"What does ""Script Message"" mean for certain packages such as the Spellbook or some ""chair"" in 25?  I would have clarified these items which MAY require external patches or whatnot as to whether they'll work solely with the provided files in this torrent.  "
,Green-Banana,2011-10-10T07:35Z,"The Xylo-Cat object seems broken--It's in the catalogue, but when I select to place it, the object never shows and disappears in Live Mode.  It can only be deleted with NRaas.  Where do I begin?  It used to work.."
,Norunyana,2011-10-23T18:18Z,"That's awesome, thanks! I hope you will get well soon."
