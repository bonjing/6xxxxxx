This is the COMPLETE Sims 3 Store items listing as of September 2011. All files have been put into .package form by set, so no need to deal with the horrid installer! 

Due to my uncertainty about whether or not I'll be able to continue this collection in the future due to my health I have also included the decrapified sims3packs. [b]Use one or the other, NOT both! Using both will result in duplicate items!!![/b] Using a sims3pack from this torrent and the one from the store will ALSO result in duplicates as the process to break the copyright protection changes the sims3pack just enough for it to appear as a totally different file!

If you aren't sure how to install a .package file for the Sims 3, please check out the tutorial on Mod the Sims via the link provided.
