Storyline:

Anton is a doctor who commutes between his home in an idyllic town in Denmark, and his work at an African refugee camp. 
In these two very different worlds, he and his family are faced with conflicts that lead them to difficult choices between 
revenge and forgiveness. Anton and his wife Marianne, who have two young sons, are separated and struggling with the possibility 
of divorce. Their older, ten-year-old son Elias is being bullied at school, until he is defended by Christian, a new boy 
who has just moved from London with his father, Claus. Christian's mother recently lost her battle with cancer, and 
Christian is greatly troubled by her death. Elias and Christian quickly form a strong bond, but when Christian involves 
Elias in a dangerous act of revenge with potentially tragic consequences, their friendship is tested and lives are put in 
danger. Ultimately, it is their parents who are left to help them come to terms with the complexity of human emotions, pain and empathy.

*I don't take requests because I don't have time and everyone will fill the comment section with them instead of commenting about quality and other tehnical specs of the movies or say thanks.Thank you for understanding!
*For best performance I suggest you use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback
*These movies were made especially for PC and they don't play on a PS3.If you want to re-encode for PS3 or test for other devices be my guests.
*I'll ask everybody to stop with the "it doesn't work","it's out of sync" comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine.
