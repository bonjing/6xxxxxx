This certainly is an accurate capturing of Amy Winehouse in concert. She's a bit tipsy,
her between songs banter with the crowd is all at once funny, charming and rambling.
She seems to lose her train of thought a time or two, but when she sings, there is no
denying the magic and power of her voice. Her wonderful backing band does a stellar job
throughout and the home turf of London makes for a very appreciative and supportive crowd.
