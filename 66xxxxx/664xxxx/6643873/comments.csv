,thorhammer2000,2011-09-02T02:10Z,"Much appreciated! This is a true PDF, by the way, not the horrible bitmap PDF that is also doing the rounds (which is about 52 MB). "
,raymond_u,2011-09-02T10:01Z,"Hey thorhammer - not sure what you mean; do you mean that the other one is an image of each page? Mine is real text in each page; i.e. you can highlight text etc.

Funny; I used to download these items from your uploads! ;)"
,raymond_u,2011-09-08T11:36Z,Sorry guys; Autosport 8 Sept will be coming; but I'm having some difficulties getting it so won't be on for a few more hours.
