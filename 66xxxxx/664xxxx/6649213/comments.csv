,Tijauna,2011-09-04T02:58Z,"Is anyone else having this problem? After I takeoff I lose all controls, but on the ground I can still taxi, rotate, etc..."
,gdavej,2011-09-04T17:24Z,"Hi Tijauna, are you still having problems? If so, check page 18 in the manual on the Fly-by-wire control system. You need to turn the SEC switch off (it's the back section on the left hand console). I turned off all 3 switches (they are all ON by default, contrary to the manual), and I can now control the aircraft in flight."

,jager963,2011-09-06T20:36Z,"Thanks for the up mickyfinny, nice plane except those stupid mirrors in the cockpit. why oh why would anyone wanna build a model like that only to stick mirrors with some cheap blue sky effect and fuselage..honestly why??? btw that non control thing seems also to have somthing to do with autopilot engaging too as after it locks up the autopilot is switched on,,,thanks for the fix"
