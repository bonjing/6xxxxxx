,vivatpb5776,2011-09-06T11:05Z,"I was skeptical about the .torrent because I figured there was no way a 1080p movie could fit in a 1.5GB file. The video quality was very good but the extra bullshit ruined it for me. No one needs a greeting embedded within the video file, a reference to some websites, or even a small bug of your name in the movie. Not cool dude."

der is NO greeting embedded within the video file, any reference to websites, or even a small bug of his name in the movie.ive checked it"
,Crewit,2011-09-09T04:04Z,Great quality! and only 1.5 GB. Fantastic upload! Thank you..
,Dreadpope,2011-09-10T04:54Z,I know its free and all but the putting your own name as a bug in the corner of the movie is a newb move. Going to another torrent for this one.
,BlueMemory,2011-09-10T21:26Z,"@blastoise483 uhh you're pretty blind then.
The website references and greetings w/e only show in the very beginning of the logo stuff, so it's not big deal. Unfortunately there IS a tiny watermark that says ""scorp"" on the bottom right corner. I mean it's really tiny but it just bothers me. The The quality is excellent though, but I'm going to find another torrent."
,rockNrollaBgd,2011-09-14T14:55Z,scorp is backkkkkkk!
