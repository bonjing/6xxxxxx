Kino Mutai - iPod

DVD Rip to iPod

Producer: Salvatore Oliva 

Filipino Kino Mutai, an art specialized in the use of unusual techniques but not for that ineffective, such as biting and scratching the eyes. Though they should be used as a last resort, in specific survival situations, these natural and instinctive gestures can be extremely useful if we know when, now and where to apply them. The extended experience of Oliva guarantees complete and effective teaching in this project that is specially focused on ground fighting, with options of defense and attack from the most common positions.
