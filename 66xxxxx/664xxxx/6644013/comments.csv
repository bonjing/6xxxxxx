,dread.pirate.roberts,2011-09-01T22:13Z,"Subs missing, IDX file but no SUB"
,vacuoso,2011-09-02T18:52Z,"link to sub file? 
the subtitles won't show up without the sub file, right? please help."
,l33tfeeg,2011-09-03T10:02Z,The subs are missing. But the ones in http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6644186/TrollHunter.2010.LiMiTED.720p.BluRay.x264-NODLABS torrent work absolutely fine! :)
,epicfrog,2011-09-04T12:48Z,"when DASH uploaded the dubbed version, it may have been ""pedestrian"" but this version doesn't even have the english subs, making it even less watchable than the dubbed version. unless you're fluent in norwegian. for all of us who don't really want to get the very large 720p version of this movie, please attach some usable sub files for this version."
,l33tfeeg,2011-09-08T04:20Z,@epicfrog You dont have to download the whole 720p movie. Download ONLY the subs from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6644186/TrollHunter.2010.LiMiTED.720p.BluRay.x264-NODLABS they work absolutely fine with this 700 mb BDRiP of the movie.
