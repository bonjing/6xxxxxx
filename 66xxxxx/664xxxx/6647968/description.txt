"The Benefit of Avoiding the Mindbanger"

When Sarah (Danneel Ackles) accidentally gets 
involved with her ex-boyfriend Joe (Pete Wentz), she 
begins losing a sense of who she really is. Ben 
(Ryan Hansen) tries to help and stages an 
intervention only to end up doing the same thing with 
his ex-girlfriend. Elsewhere, Fitz (Andre Holland) 
attempts to keep Sarah and Ben sane, while Riley 
(Jessica Lucas) is shocked by Aaron's (Zachary 
Cregger) actions when he tries to impress a woman 
with his money.
