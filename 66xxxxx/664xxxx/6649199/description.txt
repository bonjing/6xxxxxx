Timecop is a 1994 science-fiction thriller film directed by Peter Hyams and co-written by Mike Richardson and Mark Verheiden. Richardson was also executive producer. The film is based on "Time Cop", a serial written by Verheiden and drawn by Phil Hester and Chris Warner which appeared in the series Dark Horse Comics, published by Dark Horse Comics.
 
The film stars Jean-Claude Van Damme as a U.S. Federal agent in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when time travel is possible. It also stars Ron Silver as a rogue politician and Mia Sara as the agent's wife. The story follows an interconnected web of episodes in the agent's life (or perhaps lives) as he fights time-travel crime and investigates the politician's unusually successful career.
