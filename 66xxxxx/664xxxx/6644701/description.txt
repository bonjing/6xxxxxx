Proper Notes.....: Although it's not expected for every group to include the 14 sec "viewer discretion is advised" warning in the
                   beginning of the show, the intro sequences are required. TASTETV cut out an additional 17 secs past the warning 
                   which is part of the show. Additionally, their improper method of ivtc has left missing and blended frames
                   throughout. Enjoy a complete and properly ivtc'd release!
