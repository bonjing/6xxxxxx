Not to mention an old version of DAZ-loader (current is 2.0.6) and other odds."

,c71ck,2011-09-02T19:27Z,"you should have no problem installing over the partion of your comp that just has your OS on it,  it won't touch your partion with files on it. when installing, just tell it to either create a new partion or install over the OS partition... and i am just giving it to you guys as i got it... it works fine for me, i use it for my business and never had any complaints after installing it."

Thanks!"
