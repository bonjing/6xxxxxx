You've never seen anything like it.

An utterly engrossing story of rampaging neo-Nazi skinheads that may well be one of the most disturbing films ever. It's intoxicating violence and willingness to suspend moral judgement on its hypnotic characters make the film complex.

Emotionally powerful and never afraid to portray the ugly, destructive face of ignorance and prejudice, 'Romper Stomper' excites, disturbs, and boldly challenges the viewer.

Winner of 3 Australian Institute Awards, including Best Actor (Russell Crowe), film critics have hailed Romper Stomper as one of the most brilliant, provocative and truly exciting motion pictures to appear on the screen.
