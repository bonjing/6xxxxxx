,Treehuger,2011-09-09T17:11Z,"@robidew
Files are rared for two reasons that I know of.

1: Because if something were to contain a virus you could scan it before you unarcive so you are not at risk.

2: It is a loop hole in the pirating laws. if you are DLing a rar you are not actually Dling the copywriten material.

Its not hard to unrar at all either so i never understood peoples problem with it.

Next time ask a little nicer and maby you will get a response quicker.

cheers for the upload :)"
,strathmeyer,2011-09-21T08:35Z,"They use rars to break the files up to download them over Usenet, because there are connectivity issues and they usually only get parts of files. The distributors are usually too lazy or unwilling to unrar them before making torrents. Many unscrupulous posters use rars to password protect torrents and make them useless or hide viruses."
,robidew,2011-10-22T08:41Z,Well good! Now I have a reason or two. Thanks everyone.
