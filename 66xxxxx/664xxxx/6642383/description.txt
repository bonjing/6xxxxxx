We are happy to bring you the Bee Gees 1979 Greatest Hits Album CD
as our best Disco offering/supplement yet!

Given the kind of audio material this is we bring it to you at
320k for preservation - those who need the deepest bass from what is
the best of Disco standards over the years - easily convert to 128k
or whatever to efficiently fill your ipod's limited space perhaps

Enjoy!
