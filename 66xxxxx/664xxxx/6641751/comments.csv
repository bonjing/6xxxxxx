[T],prathaprabhu,2011-08-31T20:28Z,Gentlemen the whole language is about 1.5TB of data. So don't expect me to upload everything in one day.
,nyroi,2011-08-31T21:59Z,"He He, take your time my friend, i will wait."
[T],prathaprabhu,2011-09-01T04:03Z,What should i do? seeded about 150GB + but still 1 active seeder and that too it's only me.
,nyroi,2011-09-01T16:24Z,"Hard to say, but it is not fun to upload something when nobody is interested in sharing."
[T],prathaprabhu,2011-09-01T18:46Z,True - anyways i will have to stop seeding in sometime if i don't see any seeders. As i will have to carry on with other languages one by one.
,hatito,2011-09-02T01:20Z,"thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you

[T],prathaprabhu,2011-09-03T19:37Z,"I am very disappointed. Seeded about 500GB in 3 days but I am the only one who is active.

Thanks and stopping this for other."

,hatito,2011-09-15T03:11Z,"mr. prathaprabhu, i downloaded professional x64 and x86 versions, and ultimate x64 and x86 versions, and i'm seeding, but i'm stuck on 99% because ultimate x64 does not complete... is there a chance that someone seed this so i can at least keep these 4 versions alive? thank you!"
[T],prathaprabhu,2011-09-16T03:24Z,I don't have the files anymore in my server.
,hatito,2011-09-17T04:58Z,"Somehow i completed the following:

,sayarrr,2011-09-17T06:12Z,"Sure you completed, I nearly seeded my ass off. That last part was difficult. 
Now on to the English version, should be a lot easier."
,hatito,2011-09-17T20:18Z,Thank you very much sayarrr... will do the same with the english torrent. Greets.

No hay fuentes que tengan el 100%"
