Whenever I download hi res .mkv files from sceneline I find that they will not play on the Divx player (ONLY those from sceneline have this problem).  That means that I cannot watch them on my Blue Ray players but have to watch them on my computer where VLC will work.  I simply can't figure out why only the .mkv files from sceneline have this problem.  Any idea folks?  Better yet, any solution?"

these guys are probably also uploading this to usenet hence they use .rar.  if bitorrent downloading becomes a felony like the assholes want, we may all be scurrying back to usenet and needing these rars."
