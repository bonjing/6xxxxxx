,Abrahambel,2011-09-01T21:20Z,In my opinion this is very decent production of a historical religious story. I wonder what is you take on the scholarship behind it?.

For newbies, it's a good introduction, and for scholars there is little new. However, when was the last time you saw any TV documentary by anyone on anything that was more than skin deep? Complex documentaries don't have enough appeal to be viable. That's why Michael Moore is so popular - he's stupid."

Additionally I was interested in your opinion about it. Otherwise you're completely right about the goal and propose of this work which is mainly to provide a whole idea about that subject to the novice; for any further deep or broad understanding, books are more appropriate I believe. 

Thanks for your clarification."
