,Speed1986,2011-09-04T22:25Z,"I'm having the same problem as dejaded1.
I'm on Windows 7 -64 bit, 8GB RAM, Geforce GTX460 (1GB) and Intel i5 CPU.
My screen goes totally black everytime I try to load the game and then I have to hit the reset button. Anyone having the same problem or anyone who can help out?"
,julinho-jf,2011-09-07T05:01Z,"If the game donÂ´t open, download Steam Client here: http://cdn.steampowered.com/download/SteamInstall.msi

Install it, update and run the game again.

Enjoy it!!!"
