Hopefully someone can release a highres fixed version now?"

,kidcudix,2011-09-16T09:37Z,"thanx, excellent quality 10/10...... greetings from Colombia."
,BoonDockSaiNt30,2011-09-22T16:02Z,"Up yours Trexwarrior. Jealous you don't have a PS3??? osku3000, uninstalling the updates will not let you get online. That just isn't something I recommend you doing. Just wait for one that isn't protected. Besides DvD/Bluray doesn't release untill October 8th."
,stardust2222,2011-12-28T06:03Z,this downloaded as some weird TEACHER file. I cant access it. Can someone comment on what that is exactly?

,strikerace100,2012-01-21T02:36Z,"**DO NOT DOWNLOAD***
CINAVIA PROTECTED
I DOWNLOAD TO WATCH NOT REWRITE THE DAMN THING !!!!"
,strikerace100,2012-02-08T18:46Z,"Cinavia is copy protect software embeded in the file that mutes the sound after a period of time when streaming from your computer to the PS3. It is a pain in the ass. Many flatscreen hi-def televisions will not play computer input in a full screen mode. If you stream the media from your computer to the PS3 you get a full screen movie experiance without having to burn the file to DVD. When you do burn it the blue ray player will still not play the file properly. 
IF YOU SUBMIT A FILE WITH CINAVIA AT LEAST MENTION IT SO PS3 USERS WILL NOT WASTE THEIR TIME!"
