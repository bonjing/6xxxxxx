Un gruppo terrorista minaccia di far saltare due piattaforme petrolifere, chiamate Ruth e Jennifer, a meno che il governo inglese non sia disposto a sborsare una grossa somma. Per scongiurare la minaccia entra in scena Rufus Excalibur, uno scozzese tanto ricco ed eccentrico che mantiene in piena efficienza un gruppo di esperti sub. Lo stesso Rufus mette a rischio la propria vita


[u]Storyline[/u]

Misogynist freelance marine counter-terrorism consultant Rufus Excalibur ffolkes [sic] (Roger Moore) is asked by Lloyd's of London to develop a contingency plan should any of the North Sea oil installations they insure be threatened.

Months later, "Esther", a North Sea supply ship, takes on board a group of men posing as reporters who are visiting the oil production platform "Jennifer". The leader of this group, Lou Kramer (Anthony Perkins), along with his second-in-command (and possible lover), Harold Schulman (Michael Parks), hijack the ship, and two scuba diving henchmen attach limpet mines to the legs of "Jennifer" and its oil drilling rig, "Ruth". From the bridge of "Esther", Kramer issues a ransom demand for GBP 25 million or he will blow up "Ruth"; then, if the ransom is still not paid, he will destroy "Jennifer". For good measure, he rigs "Esther" with explosives and has all the charges wired to a control panel that never leaves his side.

This film was a vehicle for both Moore and Perkins to try to escape typecasting. Previously Moore had been practically typecast as a womanising, happy-go-lucky playboy in such series as The Saint, The Persuaders! and James Bond. In contrast to those parts, he is shown here as a bearded, eccentric, arrogant cat-loving, misogynist, yet he does show heroic qualities and is a master strategist. Moore once said in an interview that he preferred this film to all the James Bond movies he had starred in, despite acknowledging he was miscast in the lead role.
