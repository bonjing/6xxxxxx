This group is a "must have" for every warm blooded human being
to enjoy and experience in their walk on the planet - equally speaking!

This 2005 CD did not include the great song "escucha me" which
was on the 1995 version we threw it in here as an xtra - 320k for your 
disco type power amp too!

That said, you should have all their best stuff - and that's mainly
pretty much all they do - across the board - They are among my favorites
along with Yanni - for a different effect - yet Euro humanly vibrant even 
more are both groups offerings!

enjoy!
