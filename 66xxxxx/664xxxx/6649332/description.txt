One of Sweden's top trumpeters, Bosse Broberg is highly regarded in Scandinavia for his work as a soloist and an interpreter of standards. But his talents as a composer and bandleader take center stage on Regni, an excellent hard bop big-band date that finds him leading Sweden's Nogenja Jazz Soloist Ensemble. A primary inspiration on this Swedish release is Gil Evans, whose influence asserts itself on Sir Gil Ahead, Monkey Serenade, the mysterious Froggy-Woogie and other pieces recalling his orchestral work with Miles Davis in the 1950s. Because of the complex nature of the music, listeners may need to listen to the CD several times in order to fully absorb it. Like a lot of Evans' experiments, Regni is an album that reveals more and more of its richness with each listen. (allmusic.com)
