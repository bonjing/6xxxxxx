Imagine Elvis in Sid Viciousâ€™s body with a little Frank Sinatra thrown in and you have Hasil Adkins, the originator of psychobilly and star of this deranged, shot-on-video documentary. Chronicling 56-year-old Hasilâ€™s boozing, womanizing and law-breaking, audiences are treated to some surreal jaw-dropping antics and raucous, homegrown rock â€™nâ€ roll. Viewers will delight in the various ancedotes of paranoia as related by cronies, acquaintances and authorities.

Filming takes place in Adkins' own yard, his shack, and at various concerts. Adkins is notable for helping create an entirely new form of rock/rockabilly/country fusion, which he plays entirely by himself (with a guitar and drums simultaneously).


Enjoy and Seed!!
