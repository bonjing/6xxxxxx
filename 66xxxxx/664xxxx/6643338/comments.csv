,deadwetdog,2011-09-13T20:22Z,wow this many people and the only coment if from uploader odd for such a popular game oh well thanks Manoloseven
,ManoloSeven,2011-09-13T23:52Z,"@deadwetdog Many people just don't have accounts here, although I've already seen people that registered just to thank the uploader... Anyways, you are welcome! ;D
@All
Please remember to seed, try to get your ratio at least bigger than one so that the torrent is kept alive, if you can get a 2+ ratio that's very good! You're just not keeping it alive, you are helping to spread! Thank you!
By the way, 1.8 is coming and I'll reupload it so that people find it as 1.8 xP
But just see my torrent profile, you'll find not just minecraft, but other torrents as well ;D"
,IplayMC,2011-09-23T17:42Z,"sry, im new at TPB, but what means seeding?"
,ManoloSeven,2011-09-23T23:57Z,"@IplayMC
Seeding is when you have the entire file (and so you are a seed) and you are online to send missing parts of the file to other users. Hope I helped  =p"
