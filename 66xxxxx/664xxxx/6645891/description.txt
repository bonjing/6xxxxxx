The Tenerife Sur convention centre is located near the sea in a vast semi desert area filled with a local type of volcanic rock known as â€œchasneraâ€ . This Terrain inspired the architects to create the geometric shapes, integrated into the landscape, that comprise this building. The roof of plant fiber panels is like flowing liquid thanks to the placement of the gaps between them, which divide and multiply, producing cracks for light and ventilation and intensifying the sensation of weightlessness on the surface.
