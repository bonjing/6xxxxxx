We all know conflict is unavoidableâ€¦especially in the workplace. Whether itâ€™s a fight over resources, a disagreement about how to get things done, or an argument stemming from perceived differences in identities or values, itâ€™s a managerâ€™s role to navigate relationships, and build compromises and collaborations.
Conflict 101 gives readers the tools they need to ensure not only that employees get back on track, but that disagreements breed positive results. Readers will learn how to:

- Build trust
-Harness negative emotions
-Encourage apologies and forgiveness
-Use a solution-seeking approach
-Say what needs to be said

Incorporating anecdotes taken from the authorâ€™s twenty years of experience as a conflict resolution professional, the book helps readers more deeply understand how conflict is created, how to respond to it, and how to manage it more effectively.

Job hunting has radically changed since the last time many people looked for a job particularly now that the nation is in the midst of recovering from a global economic meltdown.

This uplifting book explores the most relevant and pressing issues in the current labor market to show readers what techniques are working right now.

Readers will also discover what to do after they secure employment to ensure that they stay visible in their field and advance on the job.
