Melanie C - the titan she-warrior of successful post-Spice careers Â–
is back with her fifth solo album The Sea. I was ready to jump the
mark and call this out to be one of her strongest record to date but
despite being touted as her most varied album in years, some of the
material here seem rather hit and miss.

Sonically, The Sea has come together as a compilation that plays to
MelanieÂ’s strengths and everything weÂ’ve liked from her solo
discography. ThereÂ’s meant to be a winning combination of ballads,
modern dance/pop and her signature spunky rock sound Â– a deliberate
throwback to her Northern Star debut which spawned mega hits like Â‘I
Turn To YouÂ’ and Â‘Never Be The Same AgainÂ’.
