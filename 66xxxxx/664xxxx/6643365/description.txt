Red Hat Enterprise Linux is an enterprise platform well-suited for a broad range of applications across the IT infrastructure. The latest release, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, represents a new standard for Red Hat by offering greater flexibility, efficiency, and control. It works across a broad range of hardware architectures, hypervisors, and clouds. Corporations and agencies that standardize on Red Hat Enterprise Linux are free to focus on building their businesses, knowing they have a platform that delivers more of what they need. 

Virtualization is a native feature of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, allowing your applications to have a consistent environment across physical, virtual, and cloud environments. All the work that you do to set up your applications â€“ configuration, creating security policies, defining policy-driven resource allocation, ensuring regulatory compliance, and optimizing performance through system tuning and application diagnostics â€“ is transportable across all of your deployments. And because Red Hat Enterprise Linux itself is independent of and portable across networks, hardware, and hypervisors â€“ including Hyper-V and VMware - your operations are consistent and efficient wherever you choose to run them. 

Red Hat Enterprise Linux provides support for your new and existing applications, the latest middleware products, modern cloud software architectures, and new runtime frameworks. But Red Hat provides much more than just a universal interface for applications. Red Hat Enterprise Linux offers a pervasive foundational environment for developing datacenter policies, procedures, and services. From identity management and governance, to a responsive, flexible, and complete Web applications stack, to effective management of scores of servers and massive storage, Red Hat Enterprise Linux should be a critical part of your datacenter infrastructure.

included in this torrent :

Multi-doc in US language as still usefull anyway.
you can uncheck,unselect all of them,or some partialy if you don't need them before starting your torrent.
run and load a server is not a simple game and represent high potntialy risks if you don't get or have a suffisant knowledge in this topic by far as well.
reserved to advanced users only !!!
So be prudent and be advertised as well.
...
Use a suffisant up speed,please,to download this torrent.
Remember : slow upload may get slow download then.
Important note :
Btw :
FDM,FlashGet,opera brother and MediaGet are strictly prohibited !!!
as i am forced to go in super seed mod to allow you to connect,continue and finish your download.I noticed that with these following torrent download managers so.
However as far as i know i'm absolutely not forced to share in super seed mod anyway.
As simple peer sharing,the results are exactly the same and even better sometimes also...
To all Japanese peers :
port 6881 is no longer more allowed and is banned now...
Choose another one so. 
don't forget to regulary check all your trackers from the list of your torrent
if you don't want to get possible bad surprise,sometimes.
You can still add more trackers as well,sure.
GL mates and seed a bit with me,please !!!
Enjoy
cheers ;)
