============================================

Walking the edge - the excitement - the fear - the arousal. The rush of life - but where does it all lead? Who's watching?

Tito gets into trouble with the mafia and is cornered in a dark alley where a gun is pointed at him. In the few seconds before his certain death his world becomes a surreal, psychological landscape of sex and evil.
