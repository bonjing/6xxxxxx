Free education
free medical care 
guarantied job 
6% annual growth 
1 month of free vacation 

sound's like they needed a war 

It does sounds unbelievable, but history has shown us that US ( Who had 58 war's since WWII ) did far worst things than that, including financing and arming Bin Laden and supporting right wing militant separatist group's all around the world for their own gain under the ""freedom fightnig bulls***"". We really do see those country's live better now, after US occupation   c c c :) 


""Portraying the Serbs as evil and everybody else as good was not only counterproductive but also dishonest.

 I'm not taking sides, i just wanna hear all sides of the story cuz I have problem with news system.
For me dude when 600 000 ppl relocate - that is genocide, it doesn't matter which nationality they are. You don't try to help ppl with bombs, that sh*t doesn't help no one. 
I don't give a f*** about blaming game tripping. Everyone uses a propaganda, There is no Innocent in war. You think that is social acceptable for a young american to take a gun and kill someone ? I don't. And don't get me wrong, I'm talking in general. fuck nationality we all live on THE EARTH

,noniboy,2011-09-02T16:20Z,"4w0nr4, objectivity is what I need too, but you can't blame croatians,bosnians or albanians for the wars in Yugoslavia. They had the right to live free without the ombrella of serbian chauvinism. I agree that both sides have made crimes but you can't compare  Srebrenica with Jasenovac or other massacres. Srebrenica reminds me of Auschwitz, Buchenwald or Treblinka extermination camps during WWII."
,4w0nr4,2011-09-02T16:55Z,"  Noni boy ...scroll up, see if you can find where i supported any side . I'm not saying that one side is  ok and other side is bad. They are both guilty equally, or whatever. Botom line is that I don't even give a F who's right. It's the terrible thing to happen to a civilian population.

I'm not blaming anyone but history sez that they Unconstitutionally separated from SFRJ YU, Sh*t imagine New York separates from US hehe.

 in difference to other ppl who comment stuff with 1/4 of their brain, i know that you cannot explain 16 centuries  of history easy like good-bad, this guys are ok and  others are not. The fact is that, that population was the biggest multicultural and multi religious society in the world for a long time. 
My point is that you cannot state that one side is genocidal and other is not. They both did that sh*t, fuck they invented ethnic cleansing term -
and not yesterday but few centuries ago !  

And yeah Noni compare ... you can because it was 4th largest naci death camp in Europe during WWII. 600 000 death  by UN Stat. U are comparing Srebrenica with how many deaths 
Lead by who ?  "

,4w0nr4,2011-09-02T17:36Z,"Ok let me recapitulate comments here: 

I'm pulling this info from the network so don't bi*tch about it 

1934 Croats killed Serbian King Aleksandar I 
during the WWI they killed at least 100 000 ( a lot of sources said more) during 1990-1995 they killed and ethnically clean their land ( unconstitutionally too), made al least 200 000 ppl refuges ( a lot of sources said more ) etc etc  

Bosnian Alia Izedbegovic or whatever spelling is, wanted Muslim state, wrote a book how to make a great Muslim land in the middle of sovereign country, brought Mujaheddin's to fight against the stat where he lived etc etc

Albanian's 1912 attract on Serbian borders with ethnic cleansing, 1946 killing Serb's  trying to create Great Albania, 1987 After that Tito died another riot and then 1999 US supported war 

Serbs, been there from 6th century AD, never in the history had an occupational ambitions, Created Kingdom in 1922, Lead by Croat Tito guy for 50 yrs  did Srebrenica genocide, killed Innocent Bosnians , killed innocent Albanians destroyed SFRJ, Killed every single citizen of other country, whenever they had opportunity. 


am I getting this rigth ? 
"
,noniboy,2011-09-02T19:03Z,"(I meant that you can't compare Srebrenica with other war crimes in Yugoslavia during 1991-1999.) 
 I believe in the principle that all nations have the rights for democracy and freedom and if these are denied or restrain by other nations, they must fight.
I live in Albania and can remember very well how 1 million children,men,women and old people fled from Kosovo to Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro to escape from Milosevic's genocide. Who was to blame for that, the kosovo guerilla or serbian paramilitary? You 4w0nr4 would say both, but you can't always blame both parties because otherwise you'd have to say that the British, French and Americans were as much guilty as the Germans for WWII apocalypse. 
 Any civilized nation should know how to apologize for what their leaders did in the past. Denying the crimes  is no more than arrogance. Sometimes the truth is as simple and bitter as that. We must have the courage to see it right in the face. Otherwise we will keep making the same mistakes we have done in the past."
,papilloon,2011-09-02T19:13Z,"@4w0nr4

for somebody not taking sides, your really keenly defend serbs. You say you don support nobody, buth from that last txt of yours you clearly chosed a side. Your drawing out txts only about that serbs were victims in las hundred years. Thats not objectively like your saying.  Am I getting this right!"
,noniboy,2011-09-02T19:26Z,"4w0nr4, the history cannot be described in 2-3 paragraphs. The history between albanians and serbians is so long and complicated that you'd need a book to decribe it. We can't discuss here about history because I think this isn't the right forum to do it :)  Anyway I respect your opinions. I hope in a better future where neighbor nations will live in harmony and friendship away from hate and war."
,noniboy,2011-09-02T19:29Z,"No, I was talking about 1998 war in Kosovo and the genocide against albanian people in Kosovo from Milosevic regime."
,Idea1987,2011-09-02T19:41Z,"@noniboy

Any conflict by them self produce masive population displacement. Only one genocide happend and that is in Srebrenica not Kosovo.

From wiki:
In the 2008 joint study by the Humanitarian Law Center (an NGO from Serbia and Kosovo), The International Commission on Missing Person, and the Missing Person Commission of Serbia made a name-by-name list of 13,472 war and post-war victims in Kosovo killed in the period from January 1998 to December 2000.[104][105][106] The list contained the name, date of birth, military or civilian status of victim, type of injury/missing, time and place of death. There are 9,260 Albanians and 2,488 Serbs, as well as 1,254 victims that can not be identified by ethnic origin

When you look modern conflict like Iraq, Afghanistan, others conflicts in Africa you can see that in two years there were much bigger civilian casualties.Rwandan Genocide for example is far worse looking by the scale then genocide in Srebrenica.More then 800 000.And genocide in Darfur, Sudan 400 000 people.

And let me remaind you ethnic cleansing and genocide are not the same. Ethnic cleansing is a way to remove the population by forced migration while genocide is physical destruction in whole or in par of one ethnic group."
,4w0nr4,2011-09-02T19:57Z,"I partially agree. There was a genocide all over the Yugoslavia. Most of that did not get to TV. Srebrenica did Oluja didn't. I'm talking about all sides in the war Serbs, Croats, Muslims. You can't relay on some paid PR to tell us what the truth is. But I am confused with right to democracy. Since you live in Albania you probably have a better insight than me, but considering State propaganda ( everywhere, not talking specifically) you or me could be wrong. I saw documentary, i read a lot today about the topic, and as I saw it, in former Yugoslavia, everyone lived nice. Up until 1990. Even your fellow citizens are saying that they had more rights and better life style in Kosovo than in Albania ( between '45-'90). 
i saw a lot of persecution on both sides. Serbs did terrible things in Kosovo ( since it was their land for the last 15 centuries, Battle of kosovo with turks, 800 churches or whatever older than xxx yrs ) on the other side KLA or UCK as your ppl call it did terrible things too. I can't understand how a Leader of KLA who is publicly marked as terrorist, and with a lot of ties to Veliki Trnovac and Europian Heroin connection can be a president ( or W/E he is now ) and peace negotiator with US. 
Again I agree that denial of crime is the same as the crime, but that things happen all the time. How many ppl were held responsible in US for crimes ( and for mistakes) in the last 60 wars ?  
1 mil ppl.  You mean the entire population of kosovo ( all nationalities) 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Kosovo encyclopedia

and about WWII? aren't they? 
Carpet bombing? Children old ppl or maybe you don't know but the biggest sea catastrophy wasn't Titanic 
it was http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Wilhelm_Gustloff
3 ships with refugees 20000 dead 

etc etc 

I agree that civilized society should be aware of that. But i haven't seen one in the last 500 yrs at least. would you call US civil ? hehe Civilized ppl will do anything to avoid war  

this is smartest thig you said today :) 
Any civilized nation should know how to apologize for what their leaders did in the past. Denying the crimes is no more than arrogance. Sometimes the truth is as simple and bitter as that.

From article - Ratko Mladic Arrest: the Uses and Hypocrisy of U.N. â€œGenocideâ€ 
â€œYasushi Akashi, former UN Representative in Bosnia, admitted in the Washington Times of 1 November 1995, that â€œit is a fact that the Bosnian government forces have used the â€˜safe areasâ€™ of not only Srebrenica, but Sarajevo, Tuzla, Bihac, Gorazde for training, recuperation and refurbishing their troops.â€ In other words, the so-called safe areas were used as military posts to train Mujahedin fighters from Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, Turkey and the entire Islamic world, free to commit their treachery by attacking Serbian villages and returning like thieves in the night back to the safety of their UN protectors who conveniently looked the other way to these violations. Prior to the events at Srebrenica, these â€œHoly Warriors of Islamâ€ had attacked 42 surrounding Serbian villages and over 3,000 Serbian villagers had been slaughtered without fear of being reprimanded or punished by the UN.  Yet, when Serbs were provoked to retaliate against these Muslim assaults from these so-called â€œsafe-areas,â€ they were condemned by the entire world."

Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG). Article 2 of this convention defines genocide as ""any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life, calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group

I have to say ur pretty retarded when u say that forceing ppl to migrate and genocied r the same.Obviusly operation Storm (Oluja) was anounced to serbian ppl couse its proven in Haag    that that same ppl started to leave the area before it began.On other hand when serbian started to bomb vukovar,they did it surrounding all of town preventing ppl to leave and bombing it for 6 months.And ofc serbian afther math told that they were freeing it???? wtf?
