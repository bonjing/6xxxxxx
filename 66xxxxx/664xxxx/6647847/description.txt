This disc had copy protection present (Marker style). To those of you who still think copy protection works: You're just wasting about 2-3 minutes of our time, We're still going to rip the disc. You're wasting your time and money. If the music is good, it will stand fine on it's own.

We rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.
HHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)
