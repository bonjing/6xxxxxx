Plot : 
Emotionally-packed and moving fact-based story about the passengers aboard doomed flight United 93 that was the fourth terrorist attack plane on September 11, 2001. The passengers on the flight, as a result of a delay on takeoff that placed them behind the planned attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, are able to learn of the attacks and discern that this is no mere high-jacking. While the real events that caused the ultimate crash of the plane can never be known, the events depicted would appear to be as might be expected. The scariest part of the film is the unpreparedness of the FAA and the military in dealing with the situation, which is also well-depicted here.

* What is DXVA?
 DXVA, or DirectX Video Accelleration, is a system built into Windows operating systems 
 since Windows XP that allows programs, if they support it, to offload the decoding of 
 certain media codecs to the GPU. Doing so reduces the strain on the CPU and allows for 
 even High Definition content to be played on a relatively weak system.
