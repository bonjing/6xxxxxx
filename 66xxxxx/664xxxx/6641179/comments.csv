[T],dynstab2,2011-09-06T21:31Z,"This is the current edition for this very title and will stay current in 2012 (no anouncement for 8th). There's an 8th ed. for the ""An Applied Approach"" series by the same author. Look for Intermediate Algebra - An Applied Approach 8th Edition (TPB uploader: betadoctor). HTH"
