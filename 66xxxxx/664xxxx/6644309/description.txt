This is a set of clips from a live performance by this group of their most
popular songs - going back to 1990

720 X 480 DivX 2000k bitrate 192k audio (thats all the audio there was on the
disc and for this kind of genre of music on these clips - it made a powerful
difference to use 192k rather than 128k for anything other than an ipod)
