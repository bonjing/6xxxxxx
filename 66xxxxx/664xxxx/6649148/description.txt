If one man could be called "The King" in respect of greatest beauty
in his Christianly spirit in giving us such great music it was dear Mr. Elvis
Presley of the good ole USA!!!!!!!!!!! Amen to that brother and amen once more
sister!

I will never have as much of a unique favorite as him as he was
best in his own way! I'm sure this Irish spirited man is from Italy too!


Enjoy this great 2CD album set in complete 192k bitrate format
