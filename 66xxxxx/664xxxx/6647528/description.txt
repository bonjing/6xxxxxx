The Rush Limbaugh Show 02-Sept-11 mp3 NOT CF



Note:  My stream capture files are .aac format.  There are slight pauses in the original (which I never noticed when I listened to them) but after converting to mp3 they make a click sound.  I've tried to remedy this with different converters but all make that click sound.  I'll look for a better stream next week.

Any ideas appreciated as I captured this stream as a backup to jwhitts and rarely listened to it let alone converted it.
