Once dubbed \"the Jay-Z of the South\" by Pharrell Williams, T.I. gradually came into his own and established himself as one of rap\'s most successful MCs during the early 2000s. Like Jay-Z, T.I. â€” born Clifford Harris in Atlanta, GA â€” carried a balance of smoothness and toughness, and although 2001\'s I\'m Serious didn\'t shoot him out of the gate Ã  la Reasonable Doubt, he consistently grew and launched a string of major hits with 2003\'s \"24\'s.\" Throughout the six following years, T.I. maintained a consistent presence on urban radio stations in America: 2003\'s Trap Muzik, 2004\'s Urban Legend, 2006\'s King (released in tandem with T.I.\'s debut screen appearance in ATL), 2007\'s T.I. vs T.I.P., and 2008\'s Paper Trail â€” all released through the MC\'s deal with Atlantic â€” were Top Ten albums, with the latter three even spending time at the very top of the chart.
