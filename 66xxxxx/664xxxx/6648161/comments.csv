,man_made_oblivion,2011-09-03T07:42Z,it'd be nice if any of these stupid freaking buttons worked! the pirate bay is great for downloading torrents but man this whole site is so shitty for making torrents it's unbelievable. I have torrents that need deleted or edited and i can't even do it...f*** it i quit
