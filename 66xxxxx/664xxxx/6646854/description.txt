This trainer was tested with version mentioned.(read NFO)!
With infinite life you can additionally deactivate the hit-indicator and the shaking of the screen when getting hit. This cheat is activated using standart settings.
You can set the Lifeenergy temporarily to 200 using the '+' key, whenever you get hit it goes down again to 100 or 0.
This cheat is usefull if you didn't activate NP3 and want to increase the health really fast like using a healthpack.
The values for EP, Credits and practice points can be decided by yourself and can then transfered to the trainer using the CHANGE button. Credits and practice points get added as soon as you collect one ofthese points.
EP points are in the menu the changed value. It is recommended to deactivate the cheat afterwards.
With NP0 you got unlimited hacking time. The alarm drops to 0, but you don't get kicked out of the menu.


The trainer is primarily in German,but when you click about you get the details in English.

All credits goes to Drolle.
