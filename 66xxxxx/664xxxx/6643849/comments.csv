,Urei1601s,2011-12-03T01:10Z,Did an install on SL and it worked great. Upgraded to lion with no issues. On a different machine it does not want to authorize. This is the first time I have had issues with an .auz 
,SVDZ,2011-12-14T18:27Z,The readme says that I shouldn't run it when connected to the internet. What happens when I do?
,Samosith,2012-01-04T15:29Z,it doesnt come with any instruments... >_>
,aryyanii,2012-01-08T21:04Z,If anyone has downloaded successfully please give steps. Thanks.
,deplasma,2012-01-30T23:12Z,"Works perfectly!  Just ran the instruments included .dmg, followed the install, dragged the .auz file into the registration window after ableton opened, and everything works fine.  Also said yes to download the sound pack upon opening.  Works great"

,bwomp,2012-04-21T20:10Z,Is this only the Akai APC edition?  Or is it the full edition?
,okiringo,2012-05-18T02:50Z,"Anyone know how to get the compressors or gates that come with Live by default? I installed this and everything, got a Max Live pack..but still no gate/comp.  thanks!"
,okiringo,2012-05-18T02:55Z,"Actually, nevermind... I found it. But the VST search function isn't working. Anyone know why?"
,okiringo,2012-05-18T03:27Z,"sorry about the spam, but I enabled Audio Units and if I search for comp, it will come up there..but why won't it get results from VST's?  There are Soundtoys and Waves VST's under the VST's section, but none of them come up on search results"
