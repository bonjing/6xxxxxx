Guest Stars --- Bob Hope, Elke Sommer, Walt Disney, and The Beach Boys.

This was Jack's first TV special a few months after his successful 
weekly TV series was cancelled in 1965. However, Jack had been 
in color on TV every time he appeared as a guest on "Shower of Stars", 
a monthly mid 1950s big-budget CBS extravaganza that aired 
once a month in addition to his own B & W series.

If you've seen this special before, it's because a black & white film
print (kinescope) had circulated in the public domain for years.
I just deleted my copy of that and replaced it with this one.
Thanks to Preacher 08 for this and all of the 1960s and 70s
Jack Benny specials from that DVD set!!
