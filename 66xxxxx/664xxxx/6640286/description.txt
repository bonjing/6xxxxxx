"Ry Cooderâ€™s new album, Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down, is a protest album for the Internet age. Inspired by a headline on the website Truthdig (â€œNo Banker Left Behindâ€), these 14 songs tackle what the legendary guitarist sees as the death of news â€œstoriesâ€ in favor of â€œcontentâ€â€”shallow, context-less sound bites that fail to capture the complexity of world events, to convey texture or impart a sense of consequence.
Drawing on his wide range of musical influences (blues, rock, jug bands, norteÃ±o), the man behind Keith Richardsâ€™ guitar tuning and The Buena Vista Social Club sings fiercely about war and immigration policy; Wall Street and white flight. True to his albumâ€™s mission, he narrates from a number of perspectives, many of them rarely heard."
