,Silvak,2011-08-31T08:10Z,Thanks.   Not what I was expecting but a decent enough story.
[T],MrDowntown,2011-08-31T16:06Z,"Yeah I liked the very end, but over all a strange let down"
[V],mirrormaster82,2011-09-01T00:04Z,"End was great,almost everything else - blah,but hey since flash fucked up the whole universe,DC can always ( if the 52's don't click well ) issue ""FLASHPOINT:EPILOGUE"" in which Barry suddenly remembers everything ( before the 52,and before flashpoint ) and just go back to their old titles and numbering...if the majority of readers don't decide to drop all DC titles that is...and that's coming from me,DC fan ( well,bat fan...but hey )."
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-01T00:35Z,Thats exactly what I hope theyll do when they wake up
,garouterry,2011-09-02T22:53Z,"thanks for this guys. I'm very excited for the new DC 52, and will keep an open mind for all of these new things going on. So excited to read all the titles. This is a serious shot in the arm for the comic book industry, one that it really needs."
,achyu1,2011-09-07T15:50Z,Where can I find the rest of the issues from the same series.I want only the flashpoint titles and not the other side stories like lois lane resistance
