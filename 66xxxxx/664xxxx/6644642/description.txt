Suicide Squad v3 Raise the Flag 1-8 complete.  According to Wikipedia there is an upcoming Suicide Squad set to start sometime this month.  Since I've been on a Deadshot kick I figured I'd upload this.  The original Suicide Squad and the 2001 series are both up on TPB. If they need seeders comment and I can reUL the series.

Also in terms of Crossgen, I'm going to release a series over the weekend.  Probably Mystic.  I may start splitting the larger series into halves as 400+MB tends to UL very slowly with my internet connection.
