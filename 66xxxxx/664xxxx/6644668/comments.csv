,Divinitium,2011-09-07T03:25Z,It's a fake album do not download it
,shopuntilyoudrop,2011-09-07T17:43Z,"Divinitum doesn't know what he's talking about. It's definitely DT (I'm listening to it now), probably ripped from a pre-release copy sent to radio stations. "

,f_2_o,2011-09-30T20:45Z,"epic fail after mike portnoy.. sucks big time..
well it has been a while since they put something extraordinary like awake album.. dt is dead 2 me now"
,Barroquecore,2011-10-15T00:17Z,"Portnoy was DT's biggest soul. Without him, they are pretty much dead indeed. I hope Myung finds another band. The last of my faith lies with him."
,maximus_363,2012-06-03T03:58Z,you can tell portnoy isnt on this record but it is still amazing
