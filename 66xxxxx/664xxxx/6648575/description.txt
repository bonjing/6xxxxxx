Description:
After the fall of â€œMother Russiaâ€ many western entrepreneurs with no scruples have started doing illegal affairs with the new republics. One of the most profitable business is surely the uranium trade, but the competition in this field too is very high... An important company, the New Gold Company, entrust a charming but cruel agent to kill a famous trader, David Fergusson, who does business with soviet criminals. Mr Fergusson is a shy and careful man, but he has a weak point, he canâ€™t resist the female charm... and this will be fatal for him. Do not pass! Enjoy yourselves!
