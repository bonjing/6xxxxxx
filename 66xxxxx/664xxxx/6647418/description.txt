Sarah Bettens, former lead singer of Belgian alt-rock group Kâ€™s Choice, is back with her more toned-down sophomore solo effort, Shine, the follow-up to 2006â€™s critically acclaimed Scream. Bettens has lost much of the dark edge she displayed as the front person for Kâ€™s Choice, and instead has delivered a beautifully crafted, made-for-AAA-radio album with Shine. Itâ€™s clearly less Kâ€™s and more of the breezy, guitar-driven alt-pop of the artists mentioned above, in particular Garrison Starr. Bettens seems to be able to write this type of catchy fare in her sleep, with her sultry and smoky vocals tempered nicely by the slick production of Brad Wood (Sunny Day Real Estate, Smashing Pumpkins, Ben Lee).

The first track, â€œCanâ€™t Get Out,â€ is neatly crafted; the introspective, somber verses lead to a wide-open, harmony drenched chorus, setting the tone for whatâ€™s to come. The title track showcases equal parts bluesy songstress and blissful pop, making the first two cuts a very radio-friendly one-two punch. Kâ€™s Choice fans looking for a return of the â€œNot an Addictâ€ days might dig on â€œDaddyâ€™s Gun,â€ though Bettens still manages to take a dark subject and weave some pop into it. As bright and airy as some of these songs are, Bettens is at her best when she tones things down just a little, and thatâ€™s mostly clear on â€œRescue Meâ€ and the beautiful, slightly twangy â€œJust Another Dayâ€ and â€œThe Soldier Song.â€

Bettens is an artist whose name you may not recognize by itself, but her voice is one that you will know youâ€™ve heard before, even if the style of music is toned down and exhaling more mainstream air. Adding to that aura is the fact that Bettens has licensed songs to Showtimeâ€™s Californication and CWâ€™s Out of Site, and is being commissioned to write a theme song for Pepsi, after prior work with Nike and Leviâ€™s. Itâ€™s a symbol for todayâ€™s music business model, which is less about major labels and more about independent artists finding new ways to be heard. That all doesnâ€™t mean Bettens is a sellout â€“ it means sheâ€™s a damn good artist and songwriter, and that for once some big wigs found that out and did something about it.
