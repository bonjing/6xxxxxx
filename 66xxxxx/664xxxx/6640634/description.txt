From the Inside Flap
Though controversial, offshoring is an economic reality in today's global business environment. Researchers estimate that 300,000 domestic jobs have been exported overseas in the past three years, and that several million will follow in the next several years. Yet, this book does not advocate business process offshoring for the sake of cutting jobs; rather, it objectively addresses the tactics and strategies involved. Rich in practical advice, Offshoring Opportunities gives managers, executives, and consultants an understanding of the breadth of complex issues that swarm around them, such as assessing the organization's suitability for offshoring, the business models available, and managing service provider relationships for value. Offshoring Opportunities provides a framework for thought and discussionâ€”one that managers can apply to their specific pressure-packed, real-world situations. It includes:

    * A historical backdrop to the economics that explains why business process offshoring is so prominent today
    * Real-life case studies in many diverse industries, driven by various business needs
    * A comprehensive examination of the factors involved in undertaking an offshoring initiative
    * An exploration of common business drivers that spur companies to consider offshoring, including cost cutting, time-to-market, and capitalizing on capabilities not found in-house, and how these varying motivations can influence how the offshoring relationship is constructed
    * A complete explanation of the Offshoring Value Delivery Framework, a strategic and tactical decision framework and model that guides managers through all the critical issues and decision points, from the rollout of an offshoring initiative throughout its lifecycle

Faced with increasing global competition, few companies can afford to ignore the offshoring trend. This book helps executives, managers, and consultants assess offshoring options in the context of their specific operations and business goals. It's a valuable how-to guide for companies that don't know whether to start, where to start, or even where they want to end up.
