The Story:
 When I was a wee lad, my mother had a cassette tape called
 "Monte Video & The Cassettes", which was one of her favorite tapes.
 She listened to it all the time, and I grew very fond of it,
 but unfortunately, the tape got lost in a move.
 I tried to find them on the internet for years, but to no avail.
 Finally, years later it was found in a box, but was in rough shape.
 We tried playing it, but everything was dragged and distorted.
 I thought to myself: "Hey, I bet someone has this on eBay!"
 Well, I didn't find the cassette, but I got one even better; the record!
 It was in excellent condition, and my mom was excited to listen to it,
 but I told her "No, wait! We have to record it to MP3!"
 I bought a 3.5mm audio cable and a 5.3mm converter,
 downloaded some software, and BAM! Here we are!

tl;dr version:
 Monte Video wasn't on the internet before. Now it is. You're welcome.

Someone told me there's also a song called "Don't Mention My Name" somewhere...
If anyone knows anything about that, let me know.
