,immagical,2012-03-10T12:42Z,"all or most keygens come back by virus scanners as a trojan because of the capabilitys,  and what it actualy does..   ""THEY CALL THEM FAULS POSITIVES""   JUST TURN YOUR AV OFF TILL YOU USED THE KEY GEN THEN TURN BACK ON.."

Thanx for uploading this. i will try to seed at least for a few days, but too many seeds bog down my network and make my video streaming freeze up. hopefully more people will seed."
