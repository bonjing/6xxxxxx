,bball230,2011-09-01T05:06Z,yeah what does this do? i havent used it with the latest games like madden or anything and im sitll fine. i dont get what its for?
,micko84,2011-09-01T19:50Z,"surely you know what abgx360 is and how to use the program, if not goto the homepage. you wouldnt use this for madden anyway cause its a wave12 game, this is for wave 13 games, so far the only one i know is bodycount, all you do is put the files in your stealth folder and abgx does the rest,

Video ISOs - are needed for AutoFixing newer games that have corrupt or incorrect Video data"
,bball230,2011-09-02T06:03Z,"Oh okay thanks for the explaination. I didnt download wave 12 or anything to use with madden, is that already supported in abgx360? i didnt do anything special. i guess ill download this one and put it in the stealth folder just incase i decide to burn bodycount.. or future games.

Thanks"
