,rocco_sifredi,2011-09-03T16:35Z,Is this the real thing folks ?
[T],zingooo,2011-09-03T17:31Z,I instaled steam without registration and then i started the game ...
,TempDude29,2011-09-03T18:46Z,This rip works for me. Though I must admit I'm a bit dissappointed in the game itself. 
,nota369,2011-09-03T18:58Z,download at your own risk. something's wrong in this repack
,Fgtfgtj,2011-09-03T20:04Z,"@nota369 say it properly,is this has setup error like witcher and deathly hallows 2 repack ???"
,akkipatil,2011-09-03T20:04Z,"This game is working 100% perfect. Just:

1ยบ Execute as administrator
2ยบ Enter in campain mode

Its perfect upload and reapack,"
,nota369,2011-09-03T20:18Z,dear Black box say properly what you have ripped.there's something more than other languages 
,rocco_sifredi,2011-09-03T21:04Z,"I can confirm, the game's working...
I am disappointed a bit, the look of the game makes you think this is a joke. The guns look giant for a 2011 game , they remind me of Quake back in '95..llooll
However, I played the first mission, the forest looks decent but it's way behind...2005 Crysis graphics. But don't take my word for it, just check it for yourself."
,Jurek755,2011-09-03T23:19Z,"has anyone crack fix for this version? I win 7 64 bit and it's not. Installs a whole but still did not go, needs another crack "
,RKO1989,2011-09-04T08:22Z,Man d.7z files of mine just got corrupted...Shit gotta download again!
,thegrimlegion,2011-09-04T09:58Z,"Thanks for the upload! The game doesn't work for me (the logo pops up and a few seconds later it tells me that it has stopped working) but I'm sure it's not release-specific, it's probably because of ATI cards or something... like Brink, could never get that piece of shit to work either. xD"
,mokies,2011-09-04T11:15Z,"When it's BlackBox rip, IT'S GOLDEN & SMALL! :)

+1 to this."
,akkipatil,2011-09-04T12:46Z,"Please provide ""Mafia 2 + 3 DLC"" Repack Black Box"
,G4M3R67,2011-09-04T14:51Z,"Game works fine,run the game as administrator if it doesnt start first time,worked for me."
,vineet120,2011-09-05T09:31Z,downloading!
,TheKcgames,2011-09-05T17:56Z,"The Rip is working good,,but i cant save the game..whenever starting the game,,it begins a new game ..any suggestion.."
,kakajeet,2011-09-05T19:23Z,"To all who cant save the game, here's the solution. 
download this crack- http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6647686/Call_Of_Juarez_The_Cartel_-_Crack_Only_SKIDROW.
Then copy all it contents in the main game folder.
Then copy orbit folder files(in the downloaded crack) to C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher(by default).
then launch the game via the launcher(the one you copied to main game folder).
Wait for at least 45 sec to 1 min , the game will run and you will be able to save games.
IF IT DOESNOT RUN THE FIRST TIME, TRY IT(JUST DOUBLE CLICKING THE LAUNCHER.EXE) 3-4 times, THE GAME MUST RUN.
I AM PLAYING IT AND I AM ON CHAPTER 3. ITS A NOT BAD NOT GOOD GAME(JUST TIME PASS)."
,TheKcgames,2011-09-05T19:29Z,"well sorry for my previous comment....just have to go to campaign and load chapter,, xD..
blackbox is awesome as always,,thanx"
,Fgtfgtj,2011-09-06T11:17Z," skidrows butterlike working games are conviction and forgotten sands from ubisoft. Now only 2 reasons that save wont work.
1. Skidrows team member changed.

2. Or they fed up of ubisoft DRMs.

Hope this official release of game skidrow bring savefix."
