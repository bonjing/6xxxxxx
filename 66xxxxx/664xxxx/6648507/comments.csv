,80sforeternity,2011-09-11T19:07Z,"Dear 80zforever, I use ThePirateBay for many years. The reason I registered yesterday is to come in contact with you mate. As you can see from my chosen name, I too love the 80s. I enjow (as a true hetero) extremely sensual spiritual rides into other dimensions as soon as I discovered your 53 volumes. I now know I am officialy am peeking into heaven. I would like to come in contact with you in order to:

- help you publish this stuff
- upload one gigantic 53 volume set perhaps better than each volume separate?
- why are many albums reuploaded? better sound quality?
- i am a true high fidelity audio freak my music setip cost xxxx$ so I was wondering mate, could you / we offer a 320 kbit version of all this creations?

I enjoyed listening to 80s music now more than 15 years. I was only used to the known stuff ( duran duran, aha, talk talk, and other well known new wave bands)

Since I discovered your compilations I must say I truly can hear these bands have spent much less effort in marketing themselves, and instead spent that time, love and dedication to make music, share their message, love and caring with the world.

That to me is the job Angles have.

These are not bands, these are Angles you are hearing! Once you listen couple of sounds in any of your volumes, you can hear it. They don't play for money.

This distinguishes the today's bands with the bands you have shared with us. I really wanna help in any way I can. I am by the way a young architect from The Netherlands. wish to hear from you about uploading one huge file and or uploading 320K versions MP3. Cheers mate! "

[V],80zforever,2011-09-13T18:50Z,"80sforeternity, itâ€™s great to hear from people like you who discovered and enjoyed these torrents. That was my intention from the very beginning. I appreciate your offer to help publish these 53 volumes in one torrent. Itâ€™s a good idea but there are two things to be considered. Firstly I am in the process of â€œre-finingâ€ them, meaning to delete duplicate songs, replace bad quality songs with better ones, and adding some bonus tracks that did not make it to the compilation, of course as time permits. Going over these mixes I think this is only needed up to volume 25. Now the other thing is that I doubt you can upload a torrent as large as 10GB. If I am understanding correctly, tpb would not allow you to post such a large torrent.

In terms of my collection and a possible 320 rip, please note I am in the process of getting a new turntable and then we will see what happens. From the other hand not all that I have posted are my own rips. Some came from great 80s collectors I have come to know, (like the coolest dude ever, Edward) and some I have found over the years on music blogs etc. Almost 70% of the vinyl LPs posted were my own rips. So if one day I start posting them in a better quality, it would be limited to those I own, again if time permits.

I think youâ€™re too young to have experienced it, but my generation was so lucky to witness the huge new wave explosion of 1979-1983. There was so much good music created that went unnoticed. Only if we had internet back thenâ€¦.. I donâ€™t necessarily call these bands Angels. They rode the wave of the new wave, hoping to make it big. Itâ€™s a very long story and I can probably go on and on forever as to how some of these bands remained so obscure. Simply many did not get the right exposure or did not have any luck. 

Anyhow it was great to hear your comments. Cheers"

And 80sforeternity, great to see another 80s fan"
,z-nith,2011-09-14T02:51Z,"on second thought, however, why would a self-proclaimed HIFI nut be satisfied with 320kbps CBR lossy files? I'm an absolute nut with audio and only the vinyl, SACD, or  properly-engineered high-resolution file will do...you'd be mighty impressed if you knew what I ran!! I've been obtaining copies of these songs on vinyl for some time...just so i can have the ""total experience"""
