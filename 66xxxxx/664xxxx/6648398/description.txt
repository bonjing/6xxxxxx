The Original Spinners (release in the UK as The Detroit Spinners) is the 1967 debut album by The Spinners for Motown Records. The LP includes the group's earliest singles on the label (such as Top 20 R&B hits "I'll Always Love You" and "Truly Yours"), as well as their first ever single "That's What Girls Are Made For" (which was released on the already defunct Tri-Phi Record label). None of the group's other material from Tri-Phi appear on this album. The lineup on the cover features Bobbie Smith, Edgar "Chico" Edwards, Henry Fambrough, Billy Henderson, and Pervis Jackson. Former member George Dixon (who is not pictured on the album because of his departure back in 1963) actually only appears on "That's What Girls Are Made For", The other tracks all feature Edwards. This is both Dixon's and Edwards' only appearance on an Spinners studio album (Edwards would leave the group soon after this production of this album was completed).
