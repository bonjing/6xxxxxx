,nimitmak,2011-09-03T13:02Z,Thanks yify.
,skillet92,2011-09-03T14:58Z,Pls mention the bitrate for each movie....video and audio bit rate!
,rcr29budcar,2011-09-03T16:09Z,"Is this the real deal or is it like the prequel trilogy that you uploaded as Bluray and turns out to be HDTV and NOT Bluray? Before someone tells me to look at the skull, I did, and YIFY put up a prequel trilogy listed as Bluray and its clearly the HDTV version and not the Bluray version.  The puppet Yoda in Ep I is a dead giveaway. In the real bluray the puppet is replaced by a better looking CGI Yoda. So, is this really Bluray or is it HDTV like your sucky upload of the prequels?"
,rockyash7,2011-09-03T16:28Z,"+1

thanks.."
,B.KITZ,2011-09-03T16:42Z,Thanks dude ... My favourite series of movies ..... 
,tegrant,2011-09-03T17:27Z,"I am so excited for these! And them being 700mb in size is great as well...as I find anything smaller is accompanied by lower quality  as well.  Thanks, Yify."
,xidio,2011-09-03T21:22Z,"Lol Bluray, the shitty version.

Vader goes: No... Noooooooo in the end of EP6.
Taken from EP3, when padme died.

Added a random Grasshopper in the Cantina, Ep4.
Added dinosaur and shit in Mos Eisley, Ep4."
,surenlokka,2011-09-03T21:41Z,please upload Thats.What.I.Am.2011 movie...
,rcr29budcar,2011-09-03T23:48Z,"YIFY, thanks guy.  I missed the apology. Sorry.  It is appreciated."
,bigdump,2011-09-04T01:23Z,"xidio: yes, because the movies all totally suck now because of a grasshopper, right?? fucking moron...."
,rcr29budcar,2011-09-04T05:04Z,"Yeah, not only a grasshopper, but the crybabies like that should be a little happier now because Han and Greedo shoot at the same time now!  My bad, that will still ruin it for u babies cause ""Han shot first"" boo hoo!  These movies are not ruined! And Lucas said from the beginning that they were a work in progress.  His view is a movie is never completed, just abondoned. And they do belong to him, so he can do what he wants to them! And if you want the originals they r included with the DVD releases, go get them and stop crying.  Allot of people like the new ones! They R NOT ruined! And the no wasn't taken from Ep. III, its new. "
,rcr29budcar,2011-09-04T05:05Z,"And YIFY, when do you think you'll have the prequel blurays up? Any idea? Thanks for the upload."

,miketheratguy,2011-09-07T11:43Z,"My download just finished so I haven't had time to watch these, but I did some preliminary skimming through, watched for a while, and here are my first impressions. First, subs are included but not hardcoded. That means without them, NO subs appear onscreen, including alien language- just so you're aware.

Next, these are definitely the blu-ray rips. Darth Vader says ""No"" during the Empire's death, as reported (actually he says it twice. It's not as horrible and egregious as I thought it would be but still, no one was really asking for it to begin with), Han and Greedo still shoot at the same time (with Han still shifting awkwardly, though not as awkwardly as in 1997) and the other little things you've heard about- such as the Ewoks blinking- are here. If you want the br rips, download with confidence.

Also, if you want quality, download with confidence. As always (well, almost. Lion King, cough cough) YIFI means fantastic quality. These rips are vibrant and clear and to me the audio and video popped on my 43 inch plasma. With such crisp A/V and things like color-corrected lightsabers (AT LAST), I'm very pleased with the presentation and it seems to have lost little if anything in this size.

Is it worth downloading? Yes. Just do what I did- download and burn the original, untouched trilogy (found here on TPB) and then burn this set as well, which would easily fit on one dvd. That way you have the unaltered classics should you ever feel the nostalgia, and you'll also have a copy that's crisper in every respect than any version we've yet had. Bottom line- No, we don't like the alterations. But in my opinion, the changes this time are outweighed by the fantastic video and audio so if you tolerate any altered versions, this set is the one to get."
,CosmAvngr,2011-09-08T22:38Z,"""YIFI means fantastic quality. ""

WTF?  Perhaps if you are legally blind. The YIFY releases I downloaded looked worse than DVD.

You get these to watch on your Phone/iPod, not for quality keepers."
,xBSAACHRIS434x,2011-09-08T23:56Z,@CosmAvngr no one else can compete with this quality for the file size that ups good movies steadily. YIFY means fantastic quality w/ a tiny filesize.
,bigdump,2011-09-09T04:50Z,"@CosmAvngr: go buy the fucking dvd then, you thankless, ungrateful asshole...."
,CosmAvngr,2011-09-09T20:16Z,"Hey, no need to insult people for telling the truth.

These are NOT high quality, These are extremely low bit rate and it shows.

Some people want that and it is fine. 

Just don't start telling fairy tales that these are ""fantastic quality"" releases.

They look pretty much exactly like what you would expect from the low bit rate. "
,CosmAvngr,2011-09-10T00:34Z,"Ok. So I shouldn't judge on past performance. Downloaded ANH.

V: 8
A: 4

Video was better than I was expecting given past releases.

Audio was wretched. Actually painful to listen to.

So perhaps OK for laptop speakers, but I played it through my Home Theater.

Seriously? 31 KB/s for the soundtrack? 

Sure there have been some improvements in Codecs but this is laughable. Even the vocals sound clipped.  This completely ruins it for me.

I am not just looking at the number. As soon as it started playing it was like fingernails on a chalkboard bad in opening orchestral soundtrack.

I don't understand the obsession with staying under 700MB. Give the soundtrack another 50KB/s at minimum. It still wouldn't be great, but at least it wouldn't be painful.

,bigdump,2011-09-10T21:51Z,*sigh* how do you tell a complete fucking moron that they're a complete fucking moron in a way that a complete fucking moron would understand....?
,kalbloke,2011-09-12T08:18Z,"Thanks YIFY All your work is really appreciated.
Yet, since we've been moving fron DVDs to BluRay 720p, we're also moving towards 5.1 sound.
You guys have always done great work - and also always stayed with the upcurve. Just a thought.
Cheers and thanks."
,lastjedi,2011-09-16T23:36Z,amazing how YIFY or anybody that has left comments doesn't bother to mention if this has the deleted scenes or the behind the scenes making of the movies special features that come with the blu ray release.so if this is really  a blu ray rip then this should come with the bonus stuff and i have a feeling it doesn't since nobody here including YIFY didn't mention it.
,miketheratguy,2011-09-17T03:42Z,"Lol yes, they're fantastic quality. I have the physical dvds, and superior rips of those same dvds that other more experienced rippers have made. YIFI's release here blows them both away.

These movies are 700 mb each, and especially for that size the quality is excellent and crisp. If you're the kind of person who wants to see every pore on Harrison Ford's skin when you stick your nose against an 80 inch screen and are willing to live with a file twelve times the size of this one to get there, then by all means download a different version.

And no, the deleted scenes and extras are not part of this release, being that they're separate video packages on other discs that are not included on the discs that house the films themselves (nor are they even part of the package at all unless you get the box set, from what I understand)."

,ifartedandshatmyslef,2011-09-29T19:07Z,"Yify,
Let me just say what a wonderful job your doing! Keep up the good work.

And also I'm downloading the Star Wars movies for my mum, she loves Star Wars, she grew up watching them."
,zeripou,2011-11-08T10:50Z,"Merci YIFY!!!!
U handle it!"
,Metexie,2012-02-13T20:52Z,"Decided to finally watch Star Wars movies. 

Great quality for something so old. Thanks!"
,Sagiy20,2012-04-01T06:03Z,"OMG, what a crappy quality.

YIFY, you should have went with the 1.0kbps audio quality instead of the holy 48kbps or whatever you had there...
Would have been much less crappy that way... then I could put the movie on mute and enjoy the mediocre picture quality. :""/"

,arickrol,2012-05-13T17:00Z,"This is NOT the original theatrical release.  In the version of A New Hope in this torrent, Greedo shoots first.

As we all know, Han shot first in the original film.  Be aware when downloading that this is not the ORIGINAL trilogy.

Audio and visuals are good.  But, there's no subtitles when Greedo talks.

If you don't mind that this isn't the original trilogy, feel free to download."
