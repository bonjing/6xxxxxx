,Zarkow,2011-09-03T15:32Z,How is the quality? PPV/VOD can be a little iffy.
,Chattermouth,2011-09-04T02:18Z,"The quality is fine. It's not bluray quality, of course, but it's more than good enaugh."
,BoonesFerry,2011-09-12T09:05Z,"Quality is on par for the file size. 
Thank you. "

Also note that the screen shots are wrong! The movie has far higher resolution."
