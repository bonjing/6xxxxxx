Info:
Butch Walker has worn any number of hats in his near decade-long solo career. One of the more remarkable aspects of his musical shape shifting is that these style changes occur naturally and without pretense. Instead of chasing the next big sound, Walker instead flips the calendar back years (if not decades) and uses the past for inspiration. Having dabbled in arena rock, singer/songwriter fare, glam rock and alt-country up until now, Walker has yet again shed his musical skin on his sixth solo full-length. The Spade, recorded with his loosely collected backing band the Black Widows, finds Walker entrenched in a set of raucous, raw rock thatâ€™s more concerned with fun than perfection. The high points are among the most fun songs Walkerâ€™s recorded: album opener â€œBodegas And Bloodâ€ features a sing-songy guitar line thatâ€™s impossible not to mimic; lead single â€œSummer Of â€™89â€ simultaneously nicks the melody of Dixie Chicksâ€™ â€œGoodbye Earlâ€ and graciously tips its cap to Bryan Adamsâ€™ seminal hit; and â€œBullet Belt,â€ like many of Walkerâ€™s songs, relays the singerâ€™s scrappy hair-metal days.

Walkerâ€™s solo output has been nothing if not consistently strong over the years, but The Spade isnâ€™t perfect. While the band hit the mark more often than not, the snarly, bratty â€œEvery Single Body Elseâ€ and sultry, sinewy â€œSweetheartsâ€ are dead weight; the natural inclination is to hit the â€œskipâ€ button and speed to the far-superior tracks that follow each number. But the real highlight is â€œSynthesizers,â€ a keyboard-heavy anthem that dips a toe into honky-tonk delight and puts Walkerâ€™s keen -Ron Paul 2012 - sense of self-awareness and critical eye full center. â€œI didnâ€™t name my band after an animal/I donâ€™t have any feathers or neon clothes,â€ he proudly declares, before rhetorically asking, â€œFor once in your life, wonâ€™t you do what feels right/Instead of waiting on the next big compromise?â€ At age 41, Walker has seen the trends come and go. Heâ€™s even been a part of themâ€”something he readily admits. But where other acts might look for ways to enact some revisionist history, Walkerâ€™s never shied away from his past mistakes. Instead, heâ€™s learned to look back and just laugh. Perhaps thatâ€™s whatâ€™s made his solo work so endearing over the years; in a scene where everyoneâ€™s so damn serious, Walker prefers to take it all with a grain of salt. If only more acts would follow suit.
