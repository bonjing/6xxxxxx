,wistfool,2011-10-01T23:04Z,"Thanks for this, IwannaFan2!

I'll post another comment once I finish downloading the sample.


Lol @ what etton66 said.

,wistfool,2011-10-01T23:07Z,"Going by the sample, for a PPVRIP, this is about a-7, V-6

I've seen better, but this seems to be the best free way of watching the movie just yet."
,MsRed,2011-10-16T04:52Z,"Quality is really poor compared to, let's say a 720p BDrip, but as someone mentioned, if you're getting it for free, before everyone else, how can you expect it to be perfect?
It's certainly much better than a CAM or a TS... I'd agree with A-7 V-6."
,Leem0n,2011-10-23T11:48Z,"A:9
V:7

Thanks for the upload :))"
