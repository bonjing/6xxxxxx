A business man and weekend dad is getting worn down by family trouble, business failure and the continuous loss of his favourite football team

"Scruffy, endearing and comic," the popular debut feature by Reykjavik rock video director RÃ³bert I. Douglas is an acerbic portrait of an Icelandic hoser, and an engaging parody of the Icelandic (and American) Dream. ThÃ³rhallur Sverrisson has the lead as none-too-likable 'entrepreneur' TÃ³ti, a failure at every one of the thousand crazy schemes he turns his maladroit hand to. TÃ³ti is abusive to family and friends, loathed by his ex-wife (who is now dating an American), and a stifling bore to the young daughter he sees every other week. Even his favourite soccer team is a loser. TÃ³ti's latest crackpot idea, illegally importing Bulgarian cigarettes, threatens to drown him in debt and unsold goods. But when it transpires that the smuggled smokes contain a sought-after herb, it seems that TÃ³ti's luck might have turned. Or has it? "A surprisingly funny journey . . . The Icelandic Dream rides on a grungy charm"
