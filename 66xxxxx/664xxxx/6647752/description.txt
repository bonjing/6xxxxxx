Prior to the release of his fourth studio album, ex-Soul Coughing frontman Mike Doughty sent out a press release that highlighted some key points concerning Yes and Also Yes\\\\\\\' creation. The tone of the 11-point list, which leaned toward the comedic, but with Doughtyâ€™s signature dark wit, dutifully reflected the timbre of Yes and Also Yes\\\\\\\' 14 tracks, a solid collection of smart, sardonic, occasionally sweet gems that play out like a career overview. Opening cut and single â€œNa Na Nothing,â€ which was supposedly â€œpartially stolen from a song written by Nikki Sixx, Dan Wilson, and Matt Gerrard,â€ is built off of a clean, winning hook set atop a bed of acoustic guitars and propelled by a thick backbeat that leans hard on \\\\\\\'90s alt-pop. Four of the cuts, the sparse â€œRussell,â€ the punk-infused â€œHave at It,â€ the German-language rave-up â€œMakelloser Mann,â€ and the vivid â€œTelegenic Exes, #1 (Hapless Dancers)â€ clock in at under two minutes, but Doughty, who â€œused a capsule of the antidepressant duloxetine as a percussion instrument on some tracks,â€ infuses real emotion into each, which renders their brevity poignant. Elsewhere, the loose and likeable â€œDay by Day Byâ€ echoes Soul Coughing\\\\\\\'s winning marriage of deep grooves and beat poetry, the lovely â€œHoliday (What Do You Want?),â€ co-written by Dan Wilson and featuring a nice, raw, duet-style harmony from Rosanne Cash, feels like the less intoxicated, younger sibling of the Pogues\\\\\\\' classic â€œFairytale of New York,â€ and the Smashmouth-esque â€œWeird Summerâ€ and â€œVegetable,â€ like nearly everything on this typically fine set of work, sound like future fan favorites and live staples.
