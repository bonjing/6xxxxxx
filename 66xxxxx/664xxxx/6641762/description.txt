Hey Guys ! this is the final part of the epic trilogy . Many of you must be wondering that " why the file size is so high " ? I would like to explain you that this is the final part and its runtime is above 4hr and it contains lot of fast moving scenes thats why this file is 5gb big . Also it won 11 oscars and I felt it would be unjustice if i ripped it around 4 gb . The format is .mkv since i muxed the subtitles .

This is the closest you can get to true bluray Quality in such less size ..

Thank You !!
