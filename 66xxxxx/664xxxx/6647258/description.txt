Release Notes

Another game using the new XGD3 format which is not (yet) rippable as a traditional .iso release
So we again chose a GOD container for JTAG boxes as we think it's a convenient format. If you prefer files, simply convert the GOD to iso and extract it afterwards
Copy the files to your hdd under /content/000000000.../ and simply start it from your dashboard
