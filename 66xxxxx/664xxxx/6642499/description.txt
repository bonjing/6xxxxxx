The Big Book of Secret Hiding Places
by Jack Luger

The biggest and best book on concealment of physical objects ever printed! This huge former Loompanics book tells how searchers find hidden contraband and how to hide your stuff so it can't be found. Topics covered include identifying hiding places in the home, on your person and in automobiles, descriptions of the different types of searchers you may encounter, and the intensity of the searches they may conduct, as well as the tools and techniques searchers use, including mirrors, metal detectors, vapor detector, dogs and more. And what items might you need to hide? A partial list might include prohibited items, unobtainable after-the-crash items, things that must remain secret or items that can be easily hidden and easily stolen. There is even a lengthy chapter included on concealing weapons and the best tactics for employing them.
