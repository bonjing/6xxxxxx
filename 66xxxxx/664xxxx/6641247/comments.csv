thanks for the feedback but cant u download the movies from the links i have give and upscale them atleast except third one because it wasnt edited properly"
,blumacaw,2011-08-31T09:51Z,"@srikar9: whats the point in upscaling a dvdrip which is not more than 1GB.
And this is the only source available for harry potter 1 and 2 extended version: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6479437
They are just massive."
,skillet92,2011-08-31T12:33Z,"dude the torrent which i gave u all are the offical bluray 1080p releases which have been converted into 540p!
