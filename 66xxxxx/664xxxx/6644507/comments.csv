,mustafa-crap,2011-09-02T06:05Z,Would you just fuck off with your comic books.
,Doomext,2011-09-03T03:43Z,"@mokakeyk: I am glad you enjoyed the upload, I will wait until I have a large collection again before I make another upload.

@mustafa-crap: If you do not enjoy it, don't click on the upload and then proceed to post a rude comment. We all have different tastes, and we all share the same right to upload whatever we please. This is the pleasure of TPB."
,PonkGamPonk,2011-09-07T06:45Z,Anyone else getting an error message when trying to dl this?
,mokakeyk,2011-09-07T15:52Z,"At PonkGamPonk in case you if still have not downloaded it, I've had errors too, while downloading the torrent, e.g. (error passing meta-file), to fix this, download the torrent and wait for it to be fully downloaded (778KB out of 778KB), it might take about 15 to 20 seconds to download the torrent which is almost 1MB if you have a slow connection like me, after downloading open it it with your desired torrent client."
