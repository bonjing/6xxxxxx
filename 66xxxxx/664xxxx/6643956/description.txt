About The Book
George Hart, back in England following his heroics in the Zulu Wars, is asked to undertake a dangerous mission to Afghanistan. Although he suspects the Establishment sees a part-Zulu officer as expendable, George can see that his dark skin will help him go undercover, and soon, accompanied only by a Pathan guide, he is descending the Khyber pass. On the way he meets Yasmin, an alluring Afghan princess, and together this unlikely trio must prevent a tribal uprising and head off a catastrophic British invasion.
