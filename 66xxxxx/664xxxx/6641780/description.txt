Prophylaxis follows in the tradition of J Church having an unpronounceable album title with more than two syllables in the word. But that doesnt mean these guys have taken the experimental route. As a matter of fact, the songs are a lot catchier and bouncier, with a mature, laid-back tone and they pull it off without coming across as pretentious or boring.
