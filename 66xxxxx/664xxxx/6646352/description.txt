Release Notes: Hitting a century of releases has long been seen as a major milestone in any labels journey. In less than 6 years, "the label that delivers tune after tune" (Mixmag) has become a genuine leading light of today's trance scene, unearthing leading talent and cementing itself as beacon of high standards; "find them in the dictionary under Quality Trance" (Trance International).

Enhanced Recordings decided that to celebrate their 100th release, they would ask their fans for their input and help decide the tracklist; over the past month, thousands of votes have poured in from over 80 countries around the world, seemingly trying to answer the impossible - what were your favourite 5 Enhanced Recordings tracks from the first 99 releases.

With the votes counted, Enhanced's founder Will Holland has put together and mixed both Discs, with Disc One containing the top 14 voted Enhanced Recordings Classics, and Disc Two consisting of 14 brand new remixes from some of Enhanced's most established names and newest recruits, who have each selected a past Enhanced Recordings release to dust off and update for 2011.

I split this CD, some of you might think I got it wrong in some places, but believe me I went through it many times (spent 2hr's on it) and I don't think it'll be better than this. Enjoy :)
Be patient while downloading, totally worth the wait.
