The newest addition in 2011 of Doug Boutwell, author of Totally Rad Actions - one of the most respected action games to Photoshop.This console system connected to the Photoshop, which allows you to overlay images with textures, and then either change them with the click of a mouse, or use them as a separate image layer

The filter comes with many pre-loaded a very high quality textures, while you have the opportunity to add their own, no copying and pasting of files.



PS: TIP:
By default, the filter is placed in C: \ Documents and Settings \ \ Application Data \ Totally Rad Dirty Pictures \ support.
We must find the file there dirtypictures.jsx (included if off show hidden files and folders) and copy it to *** \ Program Files \ Adobe \ Adobe Photoshop \ Presets \ Scripts.
When you run the filter asked to specify the folder with the textures.
