[c/o Channel 4]

Channel 4 explores the dramatic stories of individual firemen on September 11: the stories of
those who died, those who survived and those who still bear the scars.

Of the 2752 people who died on 9/11, 343 were New York firemen - by far the greatest loss of
life by any emergency service in the world in a single day.

Ten years on, many of the firemen and their families are finally able to speak about this for
the first time. Their courage and sacrifice made them national heroes but in the 10 years
since many have paid a terrible price for their bravery.

This film tells the story of the close-knit and unusual brotherhood who call themselves 'New
York's Bravest', and shows how their bold tradition of rushing into the heart of skyscraper
fires cost lives - but saved many more.
