The Four Seasons by Italy's Antonio Vivaldi has always been a greatest
favorite of my classical choices. Perhaps even the best - although I have
some Bach Chopin and Beethoven pieces that are equally on the same list.

I have always best liked the renditions by the Italian group I. Musici - 
often found on the Philips Label (Holland). This rendition features
Violinist Pina Carmirelli while our other posting by I Musici has
Roberto Michelucci doing the honours equally. The best in the business
along with Anne Sophie Mutter from Germany supremely too!

enjoy this lovely music as most a favorite for a lifetime!

Please look for our 720p music video posting as well of this programming
as it is already posted for you too - great sound (excellent 160k bitrate
on the video clip)!
