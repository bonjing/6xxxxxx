eh about this release

R E L E A S E   I N F O R M A T I O N

In 2010, we released "Facit", our second album
with my band Sakert! (Sakert! is a band where
I've sung in Swedish. I also have a band where
I sing in English - Hello Saferide.) We are
lucky enough to have super sweet listeners in
different countries and some of them wrote me,
saying they were google translating "Facit"
and babelfishing it and asking their
grandfather with Norwegian ancestors for
translation, and it all turned out very weird.

"How sad", I thought, "that I can't just
translate the songs."

Which is when I thought: "Um, why don't I just
translate the songs."

"What if", I thought, "I translate them almost
word by word, and it nearly turns into a third
language, English words used in a Swedish way?"

So I did, and we decided to record the songs
and turn them into an album. During the
process, the translated songs pretty much felt
like new to us. Everything seemed different
when sung in another language, and
producer/guitar player Henrik Oja found some
new sounds for them.

About the album, then. Well, "Pa Engelska"
mostly contains songs from "Facit", but it
also features two tunes from our first album,
SÃ¤kert!. The songs are about working too hard,
loving too much, talking too little, growing
up too slow in the northern parts of Sweden,
and about fearing your country's politics is
going somewhere where the rich get richer and
the poor get poorer. They're about crying at a
wedding. They feature a lot of sad guitars and
folk-ish violins. Every time I go abroad I
meet someone who asks me about the famous
Scandinavian melancholia and I guess this
album pretty much embraces that. The songs are
simple and sad. In a fun way, hopefully.

Sakert! is a project based in Umea, Sweden. On
tour and on album, we have been: Annika Norlin,
Henrik Oja, Daniel Berglund, Mats Hammarstrom,
Jakob Nystrom, Lovisa Nystrom, Frida Johansson,
and some other people who occasionally help
out.

We've been nominated to a lot of awards, like
the Swedish Grammys, and won a few. We sold a
lot of albums and we always try to make people
cry when we play. Um, that's about it.
