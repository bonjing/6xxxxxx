This is the complete 2CD set from Philips of the Johann Sebastian Bach
Brandenburg / Violin Concertos Original Release Date: August 17, 1993

It is performed by the truly great group - I. Musici of Italy
with other noted artists as indicated

My most favorite Bach piece is done by the talented Mr.Roberto Michelucci,
it is the Bach Violin Concerto in A minor and I do hope you will enjoy that
as the first part of this offering you might experience perhaps in order
to find early satisfaction with your overall bandwidth investment.

He is also the best at doing Vivaldi's Four Seasons in my own view
(he does so with the I. Musici group - together) and we will post
that CD offering for you too

enjoy!
