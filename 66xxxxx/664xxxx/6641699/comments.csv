,ShinraArmy,2011-09-01T17:24Z,"You're kidding me, someone actually uploaded? Dude! Nice job!"
,sora1203,2011-09-08T22:18Z,Good day! This is actually my 1st time reading a comic and I would just like to ask some questions regarding the said collection. What number do the 2 missing issues count as? And do I need to read them according to the numbering the uploader has numbered it? Thanks so much for the response!
,kiroaepi,2011-09-14T03:41Z,"FYI - Although you might notice on the cover of The Reverse Flash that it says ""Issue 1 of 3"" it is actually a misprint as the The Reverse Flash was meant to be a one shot. Threw me for a loop."
