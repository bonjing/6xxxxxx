PLOT:
Tim and Allie seek shelter in a remote desert compound after becoming
lost and stranded. A strange Manson-like character, Preacher (Drago)

and not wander "where you are not invited." At first, Preacher and his
mail-order wife Oksana (Nedeljakova) deny the faint screams and cries
that emanate from one of the crumbling outbuildings. When Allie sneaks
outside to investigate, she discovers that she and Tim have stumbled onto
a bizarre cult worshiping an entity that may -- or may not -- dwell inside
a haunted little boy
