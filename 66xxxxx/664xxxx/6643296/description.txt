                           DESCRiPTiON 

 The stories of firefighters who served during the terrorist attacks in New    
 York on September 11, 2001, who accounted for 343 of the 2,752 dead. Their    
 bold tactic of rushing into the heart of skyscraper fires cost many lives, but
 also saved a great number of others. This documentary speaks to survivors and 
 the families of those who died to explore what happened on the day, and the   
 difficulties of the 10 years that followed. 
                                  
                                 Enjoy!
