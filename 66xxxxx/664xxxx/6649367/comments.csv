,niltonnunes@intra.co.mz,2011-09-04T20:26Z,"Well,i've downloaded...hope no block as of now!"
,niltonnunes@intra.co.mz,2011-09-04T20:33Z,"Yep...he's right!what is the point?
This will only give us the opportunity to download a couple of updates and then get blocked right away"
,niltonnunes@intra.co.mz,2011-09-05T18:10Z,"Hi,any news on upcoming keys???
the last one i used did not get blocked until now,KIS12 updated twice already and is still working.
Very good!"
