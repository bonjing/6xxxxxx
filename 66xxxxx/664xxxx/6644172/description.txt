Gotfrom http://193.198.207.6/wiki/file/xyz/, a Wikileaks mirror, and decrypted it using a password in a book, "ACollectionOfDiplomaticHistorySince_1966_ToThe_PresentDay#", available here: http://pastebin.com/SBq9Xpsr

Extracted (use 7-Zip to extract), it is a file called cables.csv, and is 1.61 GiB in size. It seems to be the full Wikileaks cable cache, unredacted and now decrypted.

I haven't seen the decrypted file on any torrents yet, so I'm putting it up here.
