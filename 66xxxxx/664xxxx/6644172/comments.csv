USA is putting 10X more lives at risk every day. You know what these documents reveal? US troops committed a serious war crime, killing innocent civilians by random, including children. To cover it up and eliminate all witnesses, they launched a missile strike to blow the whole place to pieces. 
And that's one example.
Putting lives at risk???? FU"

,jerenskyy,2011-09-05T03:53Z,didn't like millions of ppl have access to the network where these were stored? that's not very secure.

If you don't have enough RAM, just split the file in multiple pieces."
