Comedian Zane Lamprey embarks on a world-wide bar hopping adventure in this beer-centric release, in which he learns about local drinking customs in Belgium, Ireland, Mexico, France, and other exotic locales.

Zane Lamprey travels around the world engaging in local drinking customs and traditions. Each episode begins with an overview of the places Zane will visit on his trip. Typically over the course of the episode, Zane will introduce different local alcoholic beverages and frequently spend some time with either a bartender or alcohol-maker to learn more about the drinks discussed. Many times when a new term or item is introduced, a note will appear on the screen to provide further information or help with pronunciation.

A number of recurring segments and gags surface in almost every episode. A voice-over feature starring "The Professor" will occasionally appear to introduce an in-depth history or description of something culturally significant, a locale, or the science behind a particular drink. Zane also often refers to his drinking buddy, a stuffed monkey named Pleepleus, who appears at random points in the show.
