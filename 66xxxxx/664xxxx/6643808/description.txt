I'm so Hollow were a quartet from Sheffield, that used traditional rock instrumentation, as well as tapes and treatments to present a tormented form of new wave, blurred between catchy melodies, anguished rhythms/vocals and frozen atmosphere.

Subtle variations characterize the most interesting songs. Check 'Unbroken Line', (based on a slow-motion piano pattern & horror synth effects), 'Touch' (set upon a line of feedback, robotic beat & warm vocal harmonies), 'Emotion/Sound/Motion' (whose first part is a moody synthscape, while the second part explodes to a suspenseful rhythm groove).
