i am wondering if a new release possible.

I runed this sequence with several players (such as vlc, media player classic + CCCP codec, splash pro EX, windows media player) and none of them showed me errors at that runtime. I tested 1 minute before and after the time you specified with no problem. 
I trully, think the problem is from you. Please tell me what you used to watch the movie. 
Can you describe the error? It brokes or what?"

i see. 
i use portable vlc 1.1.5, and am not sure this is caused by version difference. i will sync a later version and check.
thanks a lot."
