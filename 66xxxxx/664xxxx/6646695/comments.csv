thanks IwannaFan2"
,inviman,2011-09-02T16:21Z,"It's real, but the quality is really bad, the ratio is 4:3 and images are blurry. Check for the screenshots in other scenerelease website."
,IrishCeltic,2011-09-02T16:25Z,First of all it isnt fake so stop guessing. A/9 V/9 Good job IwannaFan. Great download speed also.
,IrishCeltic,2011-09-02T16:28Z,@Inviman. You are right about one thing which is the ratio is 4;3 but who cares. The quality isnt as bad as you make it out to be and why are you judging on screenshots? Some right ungreatful fuckers out there. 
,rick_xtreme,2011-09-02T16:38Z,good torrent (not a fake) its on other sites too with completed downloads and positive comments ;-)

,torrent_ho,2011-09-02T19:08Z,thx for the up man :) h8 these fuckin shit heads who rate without watching!! Go hang yourself ya c_nt
,xBSAACHRIS434x,2011-09-02T20:42Z,"This i def the best quality so far.....
 A7 V8 (for a PPVRIP) and if you think this is fake your dumb. A PPVRIP is when someone watches a pay per view film (usually in a hotel room) and records the video (usually to a DVR like TiVo).
It is in 4:3, so it looks like your watching a VCR tape."
,ido1972,2011-09-02T21:34Z,"this is no fake so shut the hell up losers. good job, good work. thanks."
,RedBusterd,2011-09-03T01:44Z,Why did you guys use 4:3 ratio? Did you crop it or what?
,ericv1984,2011-09-03T06:18Z,"RedBusterd, who the fuck cares? It's free so shut up."
,drjp99,2011-09-03T06:50Z,"The quality is real bad. Video artifact and audio is poor.  I've seen better camrips. I don't care what fanbois say. Wait for a better release. This one sucks.

,RobTortureWright,2011-09-03T10:55Z,"I honestly think theres some people out there who would watch a dvdrip and give it A-V of 5, you guys seriously need to think about the scoring system and if your a whiny little fuck who complains then go hide in sewer and wait for a dvdrip."
,RobTortureWright,2011-09-03T10:59Z,"I honestly think theres people out there who would watch a dvdrip and rate it A-V of 5, you guys need to rethink this scoring system.

And if your a whiny little fuck who wants perfect quality everytime then go hide in a sewer until the dvdrip is released."
,michaeldevon,2011-09-03T11:10Z,"Cheers for the up. Just downloaded. A6 V6. Not to bad when streamed to tv via xbox, bad overall pretty poor. i'd wait"

The movie is all about visual effects, so it gets a 5 because of mediocre A/V quality of this copy."

Just nice cars and girls ... other than that terrible movie. Arrogant attitude of actors suck ass ... and the little loony bots? I don't get it, things supposed to be serious and then these loony bots? What is this Ice Age or something? ... Story line of the movie are quite confused."
,kiwikoji,2011-09-04T01:55Z,"I took a shia labeouf on this movie, then burnt it.

Hollywood dribble crapping all over my memories of kewl transformers."
,PokerPimp,2011-09-04T06:18Z,blurry but watchable...I think whoever recorded it changed the aspect ratio and made it pixelate.. audio a little bad buit not too bad
,PokerPimp,2011-09-04T06:19Z,sorry a/v is like 6:v and 5:a
,luminouss,2011-09-04T14:16Z,"Just finished watching.

AV quality is OK, had to zoom for ratio but all the same cause the movie itself aint all that good."
,Ponczek51,2011-09-04T17:11Z,Is this widescreen? Cam?
,AriGold45,2011-09-09T11:18Z,"^^ Did you not read the title? PPVRip IFLIX means it's a Pay-Per-View rip from IFLIX... Jesus Christ, could you not put that together yourself?"
,theshape31,2011-09-10T03:24Z,"This is an upscaled cam.  Someone literally recorded the PPV on a video camera.  This is so unbelievably awful.  These uploads should be deleted by a mod, or forced to change the title to what it actually is.  Please help vote these releases down."
,baron9876,2011-09-13T01:06Z,@theshape31 YESSSSS you talk sense that people who've only just cottened on to the download scene do not get. WE WANT PRE RELEASE SCREENERS OF HIGH BUDGET FILMS AGAIN TPB. dont tell me they aint out there
,Trev,2011-11-13T19:35Z,"Didn't like the video quality, SHadowy images. Not Recommended to download"
