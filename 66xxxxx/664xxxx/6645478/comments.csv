,metalman390,2012-04-23T00:39Z,"The description says the file is an iso, but when I extract the zipfile it's not, an iso but a separate files. I tried running the installer but I get this message:

""this installation package could not be opened. contact the application vendor to verify that this is a valid windows installer package""

I tried creating an iso with nero, using all of the files in this torrent. I mounted the iso using alcohol 120 but nothing happens. The setup.exe file does nothing either.

How do I use this?"
,metalman390,2012-04-23T00:43Z,"Correction, the original download file IS an iso, but still not working with alcohol or via the installer itself."
