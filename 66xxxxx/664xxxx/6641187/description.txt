Notes: Wow where do we start? Firstly the TLA release has video corruption
at 53m07s. Also when there is movement the video becomes so blocky that
it makes the whole release unwatchable, this may be due to their bitrate
varying so much that it drops as low as 500 and as high as 1500 within a
very short space of time within the show. Video cut and screencap included.
