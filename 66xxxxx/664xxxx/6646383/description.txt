How I Met Your Mother is framed by the year 2030, when Ted Mosby (voiced by Bob Saget) gathers his daughter and son to tell them the story of how he met their mother. Flashback to where the story begins in 2005 with Ted (Josh Radnor) as a single, 27-year-old architect living with his two best friends from Wesleyan University, Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student, and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher, who have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall proposes. Their engagement causes Ted to think about marriage and finding his soul mate, much to the disgust of his friend Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), a womanizer with an unnamed corporate job. And thus, Ted begins his search for his perfect mate.
