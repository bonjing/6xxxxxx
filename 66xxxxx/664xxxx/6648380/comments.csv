,RoV666,2011-09-04T20:19Z,"You need a software called Medieval Cue Splitter, with this you open the .cue file, and click on the split button and that's it."

And to the previous poster, I would avoid Medieval Cue Splitter.  Their are questions as to it's output being accurate.

Foobar can do these conversions relatively easily.  And re-encoding a FLAC stream into separate files doesn't cost you any quality as the initial decode is to WAV and then your re-encoding back to FLAC."
,RoV666,2011-09-05T12:52Z,"I did a little research on medieval's app, it seems it has trouble splitting some types of files, it happened to me a few times; it seems you can get the better results with foobar2000 and CueTools."

,severed1314,2011-09-27T16:24Z,It's not a waste of time. It's a 2 minute fix with a free program mentioned above. Stop bitching and thank the uploader.
