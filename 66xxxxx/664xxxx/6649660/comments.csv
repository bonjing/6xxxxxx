,hootieman,2011-09-05T11:54Z,What no episode 8? or is it taking a break over the weekend like some tv shows do
,hootieman,2011-09-05T11:56Z,"eztv has over 30 pages of uploads, how can it be fake. Plus this show ends in 2012 they are doing a 6 episode finale season. Im not quite sure why there wasn't a season 8 episode 8. Episode 7 doesn't seem like a season Finale"

,rubengarciajr,2011-09-05T20:22Z,great... one episode and Entourage is over.
,AndroidLove,2011-09-05T20:32Z,"Is there any official link that says that Entourage in the final Season 08 would turn into a no nudity, barely there cock-tease show with ridiculously stretched plot lines???!!!!

I mean seriously, from Eps 01 (and I haven't seen this eps so no spoilers for this one)

- Ari Gold gets dumped and they've been dragging it

-Vince is trying to come to terms with himself and they've been dragging it

-Turtle is trying to do his own thing and they've been dragging it

- Eric's trying to get over Sloan and they've been dragging it

-Johnny wants his show to finally succeed and they've been dragging it

Is there any changes to the pacing or at least some gratuitous nudity please coming up!!!??

>END RANT<

Now gonna go watch this episode cos I'm  obligated to and still just have to.... sigh...

Thanks to the uploader and keep seeding!"

The end song was by Richard Ashcroft ex from the  superb band The Verve. Its from the album Human Conditions, tracks called Running Away.
If you like it  try Verve album A Northern Soul, fucking brilliant."
