,segelmorot,2011-09-06T00:55Z,How do You play it? Neither my VLC or WMP caplay this...
[T],insinuendo,2011-09-06T01:35Z,"I use my OPPO ...

You can always burn to disc.

As for playing with a puter, I'll pass."
,ZoOMBeE,2011-09-06T03:55Z,"@segelmorot, Use PowerISO or similar to mount a virtual drive and play from it with VLC, MPC, WMP, etc.. I dont know if theres any compatibility issue with the 3D. If so, Ill try other players or configs. As soon as my download finishes, I'll post here."

,ZoOMBeE,2011-09-18T01:52Z,"To play Blu-ray 3D on a PC you must have either NVidia 3D Vision kit or a 3D ready TV with an HDMI 1.4 cable (wont work with 1.3) and a Blu-ray 3D player such as PowerDVD v.1x.0. The latest the better.

Been downloading for a week now still only 77% complete. will be quicker to wait for the general release on DVD."
,scoobyboy,2011-11-12T20:58Z,"HELP NEEDED.....

I am new to all this and am stuck. i am trying to copy the image file to my external H/D and its saying the file is too large which is complete nonsense as my H/D is a 500gb with nothing on it.
also when trying to burn to disk it is also saying file is too large. most DVD's are 4.7gb but this will need about 5.0gb??????.....
im sure is sothething simple but as i say this is all new to me so any help will be much appreciated.

thankyou"
[T],Beebe85,2011-11-15T01:25Z,Thank you this works perfect with viera Panasonic 3dhdtv
,tjaffz,2011-11-15T05:01Z,"@scoobyboy

If you can't copy files larger than 4 GB you might have FAT32 as the file system on that HD. Try to convert to NTFS (in Windows use command ""convert drive_letter: /fs:ntfs"") or if you're using Linux then use ext4.

It's actually 46.61 GB and that's closer to 50 GB (compared to the 5.0 GB you mentioned) and that requires a Blu-Ray Dual Layer disc (BD-R DL or BD-RE DL) if you want to make an optical disc to play in a BD 3D compatible player."
,awind,2011-11-25T20:13Z,"Thanks for the upload; at first i burnt the iso file on a 50GB Blu-ray disk; but it did not work on a LG blu-ray 3D player with a Panasonic 3D TV; Then i tried it on a Sony playstation 3 with the Panasonic 3D TV and its works!  Thanks.
So you need a PS3 and a 3D TV with active 3D glasses"
,awind,2011-11-25T20:24Z,It works fine with a Playstation 3 and a Panasonic 3D TV
,choconet01,2011-11-30T12:47Z,"SCOOBYBOY:
Surely your Drive is FAT (File System) your need format ir as NTFS, to support +4GB  Files. Google how to do it. It's easy, obviously you need backup your info previously. Greetings."

100% downloaded, but say it is corrupted. Cannot mount or open. Double check with Utorrent force re-check no errors. But when I check md5 of iso with another app, it gives different hash. Is this hash for both iso and text file together?. How can I fix this issue without re downloading"
,thefiddler11,2012-04-22T15:21Z,"I saw this movie in the theater and it has to be one of the best 3D movies out there--visually stunning. I would have purchased this if it were available (other than on eBay where it costs a fortune), so I was glad to find it here. It took about 5 days to finish downloading it, but I am very glad that this is the uncompressed version. I used ImgBurn (freeware) with an LG WH12S39K Blu-Ray drive and a Titan double layer BD-R (about $5 per disc from Shop4Tech in a 10-pack on sale). It took a little under an hour to burn. My 3D TV has not arrived yet, so I haven't seen how it plays on a larger screen, but it plays just fine on the computer using PowerDVD Ultra Version 12 (albeit with red/blue glasses which is rather lame--at least it shows that the disc plays in 3D). Hope this was helpful to someone. Many thanks for the upload!"
