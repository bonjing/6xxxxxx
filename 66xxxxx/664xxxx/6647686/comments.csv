,twojastara,2011-09-03T18:42Z,How can you know that you can save if you can't play the game? Stupid retard.
,Skaffaman,2011-09-04T12:43Z,I was just repeating his words Stupid retard.
[T],rlf-rls,2011-09-04T13:26Z,Guys it's bad crack. I can play game but autosave doesn't work and everybody have the same problem.
,marco699,2011-09-04T14:53Z,"I have just tried this and it does work, when you start game go to campaign under new game and you can see  the option  start from where you left of or any chapter you have all ready played.

Not like most games that give you the continue option. 

If you guys are still haveing problems I will take a look at the crack I have and give details on how to get it working.

,kakajeet,2011-09-05T19:05Z,"To all who cant save the game, here's the solution. 
download this crack- http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6647686/Call_Of_Juarez_The_Cartel_-_Crack_Only_SKIDROW.
Then copy all it contents in the main game folder.
Then copy orbit folder files(in the downloaded crack) to C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher(by default).
then launch the game via the launcher(the one you copied to main game folder).
Wait for at least 45 sec to 1 min , the game will run and you will be able to save games.
IF IT DOESNOT RUN THE FIRST TIME, TRY IT(JUST DOUBLE CLICKING THE LAUNCHER.EXE) 3-4 times, THE GAME MUST RUN.
I AM PLAYING IT AND I AM ON CHAPTER 3. ITS A NOT BAD NOT GOOD GAME(JUST TIME PASS)."

I finished the game without quitting..but when I quit the game and exit steam all my 10 hours savegames and my profile has gone.
All newest blackbox releases are worthless.
