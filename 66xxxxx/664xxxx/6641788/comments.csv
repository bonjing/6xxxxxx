,JohnCCool,2011-10-09T18:01Z,"Dear 80zforever'm an admirer, in relation to this record found a flaw in the track 7 ""In Your Eyes"" in the 4:04 minutes that ends abruptly, leaving no sound until the 4:42 minute. I tried different programs, and even downloaded a second time, always with the same result. Always admire this excellent collection of 80 years (I'm downloading the part 115 years of 4 Rare 80s), best regards"
