,omniTed,2011-09-09T03:10Z,Hi I'm running win7 ultimate x64 and I can't install this thing. Where can I go to get it installed?
,jiraia,2011-09-25T16:06Z,Can anyone help me? in the info it says to stop the process (SbieCrtl and SbieSvc). But i can't find this programms running (checked by task manager). So i can't replace the cracked file in installation directory.
