FSX ONLY

The Airport Zurich (formerly Zurich-Kloten) is the main airport of Switzerland. Situated approx. 13 km from the city center it has three runways with two of them crossing each other. The airport has three Docks (A, B and E) whereas Dock B, being the oldest, was put out of service for aviation purposes in 2003. Until 2008 Dock B was available for events and exhibitions. Since then it has been knocked down and replaced with a completely new building which will be taken into service in 2011.

The ground layout has been developed from high resolution photo real images and matches the data of the real airport. The airport itself has been recreated to the smallest of details including all buildings and airport institutions, docking systems and many more features taking advantage of the techniques of FSX
