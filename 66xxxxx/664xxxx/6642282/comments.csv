,mickyfinny,2011-08-31T22:01Z,Well ive cut traffic down to 10% through 
,mickyfinny,2011-08-31T22:09Z,"Stupid comments section,UT2 10% traffic and im now getting 10fps.Its a shame cos this is a really nice airport and im not getting its full potential,need to upgrade i suppose...."
,Diggy11,2011-08-31T22:39Z,"Thanks for the upload mickyfinny, much appreciated, will definately use and enjoy this one. I never use AI programs. Running an i7 980X cpu and 480 graphics card and getting 11 to 37 fps with default ultratrike and cavok conditions. There are a few moments when the picture gets jittery with low frames but picks back up to normal.....very typical with aerosofts products in my experience."

,olufsen01,2011-09-02T15:12Z,"I cant get it to work, it only lagging like hell. a scenery failuse som where i gues?"
,mysteryfancy,2011-09-02T16:30Z,"@ Hi micky, Hi olufsen 01

I have a high end PC and despite good frame rates, the jerky scenery from time to time.
However, setting all controls are on the far right and traffic bei 50%.
This I have noticed with Aerosoft Scenerys many times.


@ wetmouse

Thank you for your warning!


@ all

Sorry for my English"
,green_leader,2011-09-02T17:18Z,"For those who experience heavy lags with AS Mega Zurich: The reason might be komu-bglmanx for FSDreamTeam Scenery. Even if FSDT Zurich is uninstalled, the Addon-Manager is looking for it. As soon as you deactivate the komu bglmanx, AS Mega Zurich runs without any lags."
,FSKing,2011-09-02T20:15Z,"@green leader: 

Thx for your hint! But how can I deactivate the bglmanx.dll? delete it?"
,roume1,2011-09-03T05:56Z,"REQ: LatinVFR Montego Bay, Key West, Cayman Island and Las Americas... Thanks in Advance...!"
,green_leader,2011-09-03T15:16Z,"@FSKING:
you can delete it, but in this case all FSDT-Scenerys - if you have any of them - will stop working. 

You can move it to a temporary folder with all corresponding files ( bglmanx_aerosoft.dat, bglmanx.dat, bglmanx_fsdt.dat) or rename them.

To deakctivate you have to edit the dll.xml file and remove the bglmanx-section. "

But I do have these lags, even though all these file are overwritten due to the new installation, aren't they?! Thx for your help."

,stefano45,2012-01-01T00:43Z,thank you!
,iramacky,2012-01-30T01:26Z,"As always Micky thank you very much, Your one of my best and most trusted uploaders. Iv downL a nice bit of your work, again thank you very much and i hope to see more of your fine and trusted uploads. Stay blessd m8"
,Juppie902,2012-02-08T23:18Z,"The lags are horrible.
Got komu's crack for FSDT, ( I kinda wanted GSX only, the fsdt sceneries arent so much of interest to me ) but the crack applies to an old version of Addon Manager therefore GSX is not even on the list of addons.
Got Zurich X, LAS, and Geneva.
Tried to land with Zurich X scenery activated and it lagged (with the NGX) that badly that every 500 ft fsx got stuck for 2 minutes (and i had -1800 descent rate while approaching), i deactivated the scenery and it didnt help, so if I de-activate the bglmanx all my products will be de-activated but ill be able to use the trial of the scenery lag free ? :\ doesn't looks like a nice deal."
,MaorC,2012-03-27T14:42Z,"I installed it and i read the readme , replaced the BGL in the Aerosoft  Zurich X 2012  Scenery and all the airport is black , i cant see anything except many lights ...
Help please ?"
