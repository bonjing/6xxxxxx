,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-09-02T04:06Z,never mind.... 
,rengelgeer,2011-09-03T22:46Z,"Are you gonna fix the file or not? Because I think this isnt it, Vray Plugin isn't 2.25Gigs
Plz respond"
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-09-04T13:18Z,"uhm its 2.25GiB because there are multiple Vray versions included and also for different versions of Cinema 4d (see title...). 
That simply takes up space sorry THOUGH you can uncheck what you don't want 

and don't be such a hater, asking nicely work better trust me :]"

,MrRobinO,2011-09-15T15:12Z,"Wierd.. I installed 1.2.5.1 for my R11.5 but it doesn't show up in rendersettings

Something i've missed?"
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-09-16T01:41Z,"did you go to general and ticked the ""VrayBridge"" on?  I never had R11.5, only R12 and R13 roght now :P so for me its a dead end...  though you can watch so basic tutorials on youtube to double check if you missed something vital... good luck!"

Have Fun!"
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-09-17T14:21Z,This Version Of Vray WORKS WITH R13! :P  (happy dance)
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-09-20T19:06Z,(just install 1.2.5.5 -originally for R12-)
,tangucho,2011-09-25T08:30Z,"I am sorry but I can't get it to work. I even get the 1.2.6 version of VRay and that even don't work.

How do I activate on general settings. Can you please explain with more detail. There are some noobs here."
,telek88,2011-10-05T08:32Z,"Have you tried it on Lion? i just can't make it work with 11.5, and 12, 13 neither. after i've made everything you described in the installation tutorial, i just couldn't see ""vraybridge"" in the general settings. Anyone with the same problem?"
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-10-18T17:04Z,"I didn't tried lion as I don't have lion... :\

and if you installed it properly you can find Vraybridge under render settings/general, for R13 there is a little drop down menu in the left corner of the window   and for R12- you can find it under render settings/general and select VrayBridge...  its that simple comon' guys!"
,jannyc,2011-11-04T22:46Z,"Ok figured it out.

I'm running: Mac ox lion c4d 13

1) download 1.2.5.5 keygen by karate chicken
2) download this torrent (duh)
3) place vray bridge folder in the 'plugins' folder
4) right click on the c13 logo --> show contents
5) go contents --> macOs --> paste the lib files in here
6) open keygen and paste in in your 11 number c4d serial (found inside cinema 4D (help --> personalize)
7) the keygen will generate a .key file, place it in the main c13 directory
8) change permissions on your .key file to 'read & write'
9) open c4d, the vray bridge should appear in your render settings
10) pat yourself on the back"
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-11-21T17:58Z,yeah nicely said ... thats 110% correct :)

,Chofox913,2012-05-30T01:15Z,"Help! I'm on c4d r13, installed it just as jannyc said, but my c4d crashes when i try to open it! help!"
,TTparty82,2012-06-10T20:34Z,"Thanks for C4D R13, Thanks for Vray. However, i Installed vray according to instrucctions, everything seems fine, BUT Vray is not rendering, when you press render button, nothing happens, I tried to render some of the example files in the torrent, it's not working. When I create a new scene and use other renderer it does work. "
