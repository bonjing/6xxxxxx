Eddie Galaxy: Intergalactic Exterminator

Gameplay is remarkably simple.  Move the mouse around,
left-click to fire.

  Sometimes when you destroy a mushroom, a radio will
pop out and drift down the screen.  Pick it up to be
assigned a special mission.  Accomplish the special
mission before time runs out, and you will receive 
500 points and a bonus item.
Bonus items include:
	Bonus lives
	Shields	(let you take one hit without dying)
	Power Boosts (increase your rate of fire)
	Wingmen (fly alongside you, shooting with you)
	Autocannon
	Nuclear Warhead
	Neutron Beam
	Shotgun
	Laser-Guided Missiles

	The last five are special weapons, which you
fire by right-clicking.  They come with a limited
amount of ammo.  Whenever you die, you lose all the
power-ups you had, so be careful.

	Pass each level by destroying the giant
insect that inhabits it.  Each planet consists of
four such levels, and then after an action-packed
bonus stage, you fly off to the next planet, receiving 
vital statistical information before you land.  When you
finish the last, you loop back to Earth again.

	To quit the game, press ESC and then choose
Exit Game.  You can also toggle the music and sound
effects from here.  Continue puts you back into the 
game.
