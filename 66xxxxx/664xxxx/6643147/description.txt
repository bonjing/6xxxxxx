Notes ....: The current and previous rulesets did not get in detail into reference frames settings. The high.definition.x264.standards.revision.3.1.addendum.1 elaborated and provided a formula explaining how max reference frames are to be calculated following h264 specs. While rules work well for standard WS releaeses ("--ref 5 or higher is required unless the vertical resolution is greater than 864, then 4 must be used to respect L4.1"), it is not accurate for full screen 1080p (1:~1.33).
Blu-Rays in general follow h264 L4.1 and 4 reference frames, but they are all in 1:1.78 frame as they are meant for WS HD TVs (meaning FS movies have large black areas on the sides). For rips however all those black parts are cropped out.
For this specific movie the vertical res is 1080 (1488*1080=1.378), however the horizontal resolution plays a big part unlike in widescreen movies. 
The formula the rules were simplified from is:
ref = 12288 * 1024 / (vertical resolution * horizontal resolution * 1.5)
this gives a ref5 for 1488*1080 and silimiar resolutions: "12582912 / 2410560 = 5.21"
Using the --level 4.1 switch basically automates the ref frames setting according to h264 requirements. See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC#Levels
Bottom line: all the above blubbering is to explain why this rip has ref 5 and not 4 as we try to do things right (as much as possible) :)
