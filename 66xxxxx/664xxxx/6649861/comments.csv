,argon1204,2011-09-04T06:19Z,"pls seed, don't just fuck leech"
,starbar222,2011-09-04T08:04Z,Sigh preview looked much better the sounds and video made me sick glad i didn't pay to see this thanks for the upload tho ;)
,Agalloch9,2011-09-04T08:19Z,"Downloaded, and watched it just then.

Audio - 8/10
Video - 6/10
Movie - 8/10

The video is intentionally grainy and glitchy, due to it being ""recovered"" from the Moon landing in 1974, as per the description of the film.

It's decent enough for a cam copy. The audio, however, is the highlight of this copy.

The film itself is very good, in my opinion. It wasn't scary, but it kept you on edge for most of it. I recommend it.

Thanks for the upload, Froggie!"
,steve2011,2011-09-04T11:00Z,nice for a ts xvid been waiting 4 this

,avalon57,2011-09-04T11:53Z,"In the process of downloading this film.Why pray tell is the d/l up to 8x slower than the u/l rate to seeders and leechers,I think it is out of order!My normal site is I P Torrents and it whipes the floor with this torrent site.Thanks for the eventual movie when it has finally finished."
,dzlrules,2011-09-04T12:15Z,"Not even a good work of fiction, let alone legitimate footage of a space mission."
,avalon57,2011-09-04T12:33Z,"To tell you honestly,just downloaded the same film and it took 8 minutes,which shows this site is way too slow.your film isn't 25% done yet and has been downloading for over an hour!"
,Eaz77,2011-09-04T12:36Z,"Almost tempted downloading this, been waiting for this one, but as a general rule avoiding TS.

Thanks for upload though."
,TorrentGuy96,2011-09-04T13:24Z,"@scfc4eva It says English SUBS, and Russian Camrip (didnt see A: OWN at the time) so I wasnt sure if it was russian with english subs

Sorry about being so dumb, will seed for as long as i can to make up for it XD"
,TorrentGuy96,2011-09-04T15:14Z,"Only getting 20-30 KB/s :'(

Come on guys!"
,dirtp00r,2011-09-04T17:20Z,"Haven't watched the movie yet but I spot checked it in several places. Looks pretty good. Audio is very clear, video looks exceptional for a CAM.
I think the first couple minutes are missing from the beginning. It starts out with an astronaut talking as if the credits have already ran and there are none that come later but looks like if there is some missing, it ain't much and nothing you need to see that is vital to the plot.
Thanks very much to the uploader. I have set my upload to max and will seed for a few days."
,dirtp00r,2011-09-04T17:21Z,"Rats! I forgot to say the audio is in English, no subtitles."
,nassb3103,2011-09-04T18:52Z,why is it so slow??? 34 kb/s lmao
,callum_007_y,2011-09-04T23:34Z,wont download for me :(
,bluesborn,2011-09-05T00:21Z,As has been mentioned part of the beginning is missing.The entire video is 1 hour 14 minutes and 12 seconds long.The quality is about what can be expected from a competent uploader-good but still just a cam.It seems watchable so far.Thanks for the effort uploader.
,DJR3D51GN,2011-09-05T01:56Z,"my house just told me not to bother watching as the quality looks rubbish ""as if it was filmed in the seventies or something"" he felt slightly foolish when i showed him the trailer and remarked that its set in the seventies and its like that on purpose looooool"
,Demoman01,2011-09-05T03:02Z,When mine finishes i will keep it seeding.
,dirtp00r,2011-09-05T03:47Z,"Just finished watching it. It's creepy. Almost like an M. Night Shyalman film. It is like a cross between M. Night and Paranormal Activity.
I didn't think the quality was that bad. Certainly not DVD but one of the best cam jobs I've seen.
Yes, it's meant to look like the 70's because it's supposed to be ""lost"" footage from the Apollo era.
I think it's worth the download. But, I plan to hit the theater and see it.
My download was really slow, too. took over 12 hrs I guess because down loaders are not seeding while dwnldg. I am seeding between 25 and 35 kbps (DSL).
I'll keep seeding for a few days at 100%."
,jonjo187,2011-09-05T10:06Z,will it work on the ps3??
,ust2,2011-09-05T12:27Z," Jesus enough text files attached to it? lol I don't think i've ever had to deselect so many things.

 Still downloading, but.. I wish more people would just post clearly labeled A/V's though.

 Hate having to read everyones comments to get the gist of the quality, and a lot of comments tend to have spoilers or are just plain flaming..

 So if you're going to rate something, start with the A/V rating please, you can post you fucked my mother after that for all I care."
,magasu,2011-09-05T16:27Z,"Not too bac for a CAM copy. I'd give it a CAM 8/10.

Watchable, even though the film sux. 'Blair witch reject' meets 'The Thing,' in space. Only nowhere near as good. How these people made it through astronaut training, I will never know. 

Thank's for the upload."
,dubblue,2011-09-05T17:28Z,thank you
,chanixz,2011-09-05T17:32Z,anymore A/V rating? tnx

,ust2,2011-09-06T00:46Z," A:8
 V:3-6 (really varies)

 Not a good movie to watch a cam version of.. just the way most of it was originally filmed already lessens the quality. 

 It's like watching a cam recording a cam recorded video in most scenes lol *mind blown* "
,theoryTim,2011-09-06T02:06Z,"Since the original is probably very grainy at points, this probably would differ much from a dvd rip.  The key point is the audio, which is pretty good.

A: 8/10

M: 5/10"
,redrumpanda,2011-09-06T02:45Z,No one gives a shit what if you think it's a good movie or not comment on the A/V and tell the uploader thank you. FFS you people act like you are some kind of movie critic.

,normskis69,2011-09-08T02:59Z,Could've been much better if the science fiction part of the storyline was more believeable and altogether less ridiculous.
[T],TalmudTimmy,2011-09-08T04:04Z,What a waste of time downloading. The Hollywood Jews who produced this crappy film made it using a bloody handy cam. Is this the new trend in movies? Make them cheaper? Weak.
,SumeklamKidd,2011-09-08T07:05Z,"I enjoyed the movie: made me feel like I was there on another Apollo mission gone oh so wrong. Even a few genuinely frightening moments, hard to do in a movie... All in all, an excellent flick that captures the spirit of Apollo missions. 

That said, I wish it would have been about intelligent aliens on the dark side of the moon telling us to stay the hell away from the moon, or else! I think that would have been a better story, IMHO."
,pennknig,2011-09-08T13:28Z,"I am soooo glad I didn't pay to see this movie in the theatre!

It was hard to tell, the movie is supposed to look and feel old so at some points i couldnt tell if it was just the movie. It is a cam job though so you have to put that into account.  Very entertaining movie, a few frightenting parts but I didnt lose interest at all throughout the whole movie :D I recommend downloading this torrent."
,AgentClaret,2011-09-10T21:04Z,"These comments are hilarious... people bitching about free stuff, rampant antisemitism, swearing like kids on a playground in 5th grade... and it'd be a lot funnier if it wasn't real life and these people weren't breathing up our oxygen!
