In dedicating his latest book to plant breeders, Armitage conveys his enthusiasm for the breathtaking range of ornamental plants now available to avid gardeners. Many green thumbs specifically count on annuals to bring vibrant color to beds and borders during the traditional growing season, and this encyclopedic reference provides a wealth of photographs to help delineate the ever-increasing arrays of annuals that can be found at nurseries and garden centers. Armitage's lively text is both informative and entertaining, and instead of emphasizing cultivation requirements, he provides savvy, up-to-date recommendations for the most desirable species and cultivars to enliven one's garden, from stunning forms of ornamental okra to fuchsias and tropicals such as ginger lily and the unusual twining vine Basella alba. A terrific resource for gardeners and an essential book for anyone who gardens in warmer regions, where many of these plants are among the choicest of year-round specimens. Alice Joyce
