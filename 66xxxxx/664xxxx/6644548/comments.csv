Alice has always pushed the boundaries, but this time he may have pushed them too far. He's become less the ""shock rocker"" and more the hard rock version of Weird Al Yankovic. ""Ghouls Gone Wild""...? Yikes!"

,bttm4top28,2011-09-17T17:47Z,BaronVonWatermelon....ur kidding right? im 31 yrs old and been a Coop fan since 9yrs old. This album is f@#kin great. if ur an older man then ull never get it by now. Alice has not changed a bit. this cd is a great sequal. Disco Bloodbath Boogie Fever is a great song and u obviously do not get it. he sings about shooting up a disco club. read the lyrics u turd. ur not gona walk into a danceclub and not hear dance music when u walk in right? Every1........dont let this guy fool u. this a great cd. I mean the guy is 63yrs old......hes done everything. by the time i heard the cd the 4th time......every song was my favorite. 
,bttm4top28,2011-09-17T17:51Z,oh yea....and the pop track is great too. Kesha is playing the role of the Devil. The Devil is tryin to control Steven. And if u have to ask who Steven is then u r not an Alice Cooper fan. 
,gogox,2011-10-01T03:02Z,I'll just say that this album exceeded my expectations. It's been quite a few years since I heard something this good.
