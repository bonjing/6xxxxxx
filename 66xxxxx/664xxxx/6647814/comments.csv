,xenoFLASH,2011-09-03T16:32Z,"This movie kicks ass. Question: Does the 5.1 audio cut out at certain parts of the movie, just as the 2.0 audio does? Just wondering."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-09-03T18:04Z,where do you think it cuts out at?  give me a specific time code.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-09-03T21:58Z,there are 0 audio drop outs.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-09-03T21:58Z,Natalie Portman is so awesome by the way.
,xenoFLASH,2011-09-04T15:39Z,"Agree with you about Natalie. The part with the giant frost-beast, with it bashing thru things, the sound will stop, like it just gets to loud, maybe? I have no clue if this is due to my xbox or not."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-09-04T16:11Z,"hmm, dunno bud, didn't experience any issues."

I was wondering if you could do Iron Man 1 and 2 for me in 720p and Spider-Man 1 and 2 as I really want to gather a bit more of a Marvel collection before the avengers is released :)"
