[T],MrDowntown,2011-08-31T04:43Z,"So, my 2 cents - This is crap. Maybe itll get better but so far its an info dump with lots of color and messy panels and little to no actual story. Looks like those that believe 52 relaunch is going to be a flop were right ...

Here's a example: ""Hi Batman, im green lantern, heres my story and my powers and my shoe size and boom boom, and blah blah blah BOOM - PS.. im awesome!""

Secondly, as for my god-awfully slow initial seed - Im very sorry -my internet has slowed to a crawl - No idea why but its ruining my life.

,w_prill,2011-08-31T04:51Z,"I agree, the hype proved to be a let down.  I just hope it improves..."
[T],MrDowntown,2011-08-31T04:57Z,Exactly 52 leechers - priceless!!! :D
[T],MrDowntown,2011-08-31T04:59Z,"It may be like Stephen Colbert - when he left the Daily Show and I watched his first Ep, he was nervous, all over the place and I was like wow, this guy sucks on his own - Now he rules the world so..

Yeah, this may get better after they info-dump all the new people in."

,angelboy80001,2011-08-31T05:48Z,"THANK YOU! havent read yet, going to wait till read flashpoint 5 but hope it better than im expecting lol"
,shadownights23,2011-08-31T06:15Z,hell ya man your awesome for this... with me i never was into dc do the reboot dont mean jack to me...i enjoyed this honestly but like i said i have the advantage of not really knowing anything pre reboot
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-08-31T06:25Z,"The art was pretty good. As for the story, I'll quote you ""little to no actual story"" :P"

,plattekak,2011-08-31T07:21Z,"i'd say it's above average... if they want to restart the whole story then you need to get rid of everything know until this point... 
but hell.
i was reading some of frank miller's work before reading this and i have to say that this is way worse although it has something of the all star batman likeness"

,angelboy80001,2011-08-31T17:18Z,"by the way read it and flashpoint finale, dissapointed in flashpoint and as for this.. was ok.. reminded me a lot of 90's comics tho.. more to do with great art than great story.. lets see what part 2 and the other 51 bring i guess "

,pavlx,2011-08-31T17:38Z,"I'm with you MrDowntown, that's Geoff Johns in charge, and while I'm a little dissapointed now, I have faith. Oh and THANK YOU for the ul ;)"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-08-31T17:48Z,"I better watch my back.

Hopefully, the 52 will get better or eventually everything will go back to normal.

Yeah after readin FP5 I was like - um...what? why did i waste my time with this? So flash caused it all and nothing else was resolved - jumbled mess"
,Shamash9,2011-08-31T20:05Z,"It had tons of action, the updated costumes instantly appealed to me. I love the practical additions to Batman's costume, especially the steel nut crusher things he's got attached to his gauntlets. There was quite a bit of info thrown at us, but I like the slow trickle of character intro's, as I felt it gave supes, bats and gl each a shining moment. I think the fact that it was supes, bats and gl and not ww counts as gl's official induction into the DC holy trinity, taking WW's place."
[T],MrDowntown,2011-08-31T20:33Z,"The one thing I did like about GL (if he'd ever shut up) was that they upped his power - GL's have always been said to be able to manifest anything they can imagine but so far they always had very limited imaginations, using SWAT members as a shield instead of just a bubble & putting out fires all over gotham was pretty cool.

Batman being hunted as a vigilante is always better and more realistic. Batman inc as a comcept was very flawed - You realize how many lawsuits Batman Inc would have filed against them - Bruce would be bankrupt in a day.

Im intrigued to see more about Cyborg (does he has his own run? or just in JL?"
,iThinkDC,2011-08-31T22:13Z,Thank You *-*
[V],mirrormaster82,2011-08-31T23:59Z,"Congrats for uploading it,I was busy almost whole day,So I just read it...Yeah,bad,almost copy-paste All star Batman and Robin,but hey - it's only first issue,so...we'll see..."
,Lyxnman,2011-09-01T05:32Z,Mr.DT a #1 that's an info dump? say it isn't so!
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-01T07:51Z,"I get what youre saying but, this was literally the green lantern just telling us his whole life story"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-01T07:53Z,"Also the whole concept of new readers. Hmmm.. super man!? whats this now? #1 - well, howdy, better buy her up"
,ShinraArmy,2011-09-01T17:15Z,"Ahhh, brand new! And I didn't have to wait in line all night long...so thank you very much MrDowntown, I shall seed to at least 5.2 ratio."
,Shamash9,2011-09-02T08:28Z,"I think the only new readers they're going to get are people who read comics but shy away from DC for one reason or another. They might make some inroads in the digital realm, but I don't t think anyone expects DC to start a new comics fad or anything. But if it gives DC and the comics industry a shot in the arm and small boost of momentum, then I'm all for it! The first issue of Justice League was a little ham-fisted with it's info, but it had fantastic pacing and was loaded with action. Hell, in his own title, Superman has scarcely decked a motherfucker since New Krypton exploded a year ago, and green lantern has been having Dragonball Z shouting battles in space; so it's nice, as a fan of these characters, to see their shit on display and in such a grand fashion. Worth a read and worth $3. "
,garouterry,2011-09-02T22:55Z,"c'mon guys, it's just the start. lighten up. they're catering to old and esp. new readers so of course there would be loads of info drops. DC got this. "
,holykarmor,2011-09-06T10:39Z,Can you please keep post justice league 2 & 3 too? Thank you
,APiseasy,2012-01-22T15:37Z,"THANX :)
