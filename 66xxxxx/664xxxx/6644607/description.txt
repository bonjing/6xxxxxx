Build your own nightclub empire and turn night into day! Start a new
adventure and make you dance the night away as the ruler of her own
nightclub empire! Assemble in the large cities of the world strip clubs,
bars, shops, cinemas and discos. Put on your customers the best offer
and weigh up how much return can bring an investment. Even if you start
small, you can gradually with some tactical skill displace your
competitors out of the city and thus create a true nightclub empire.
Only if you have a good nose for the location planning and set the
prices intelligently, you will expand beyond the borders. You can create
clubs, shops and cinemas and these apply also equip and. An important
issue is security, so bodyguards are among your staff. Only if you
overlook all costs, you'll make it on time, in the night club business
to get out very big.
