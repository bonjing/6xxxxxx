If you could, name the file something like: 'So.You.Think.You.Can.Dance.S04E01.Belgian-Dutch.XviD'

Or maybe just in the title so it doesnt come up with the U.S. versions in searches.

,cudchew,2011-09-02T20:29Z,The Belgium/Netherlands dancers are much lower quality compared to SYTYCD US/Canada/Australia.  It's funny to watch Dan Karaty bite his tongue every week so he doesn't only have bad things to say to the dancers.
