         Oh! Competition! Nice! But...
         
         RUTAN was a little too fast to make us NOT check their 
         release with our proper-goggles on :)

         And it took 20 seconds to find the flaw, and how they cheated.
         
         00m00s-20m58s = 7,9 avg.drf
         20m58s-42m02s = 6,7 avg.drf

         This means that RUTAN did a 2nd pass segment encode with 20m58s
         as the cut between the segments. If they had done a full 2nd pass
         encode the drf would have been much more similar between the segments.

         Reminder of the rules

         "The second pass must be done as spanning the entire episode with
         bitrate distribution based on need determined from a stats file
         referencing the entire episode; segmenting with arbitrary bitrates is
         banned."

         Better luck next time, cheaters
