CaptainBaboon42- Only gave everyone the demonata and darren shan series but I have found the thin executioner/2 books of the city trilogy and the 2 books that are out of the Larten Crepsley series. With all do respect captain Thnx and with this new torrent people will notice ur genius and I will also have new books and thank you for providing us with those and here are the books you werent able to share. This books are also in JPG. format so there is a Pdf copy of the books and a JPG. format for the books for each one.
