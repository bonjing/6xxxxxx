ip logged as peer blocking...
find a quick solution or i will be forced to ban you !
you stay off to 0 % without up and down since many hours now ! what are you doing,guy ?
away ? drinking ? pissing ? what else ?
you are not alone on this torrent ! huh ?
 therefore stop dreaming and act now !
2-3 other peers cannot connecting correctly by your fault...Not cool at all !
do you sleep or what ?
...
disconnect and see and find what's wrong with you ! don't insist anymore !
check your tracker list and see if some are not blocking you.
Anyway,in this case,if you cannot connecting,then
abort and let your place to an other peer and review your settings.right ?
Be mature,guy !
sorry to be rude but i
hope it is clear enough so.
seed is now temporarily stopped then !
Will restart asap...

you are still extremely slow dude...
Difficult for me to resolve your ip so.
Try to be more cooperative,please !
try to disable dna acceleration to see if better otherwise switch to 80 port to check if better.
check your tracker list and update or delete all who could blocking you.
Add other ones also if you want but be sure most of your trackers are ok,right ?
Ty for understanding"
