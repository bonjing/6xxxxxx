Exclusive features of Enterprise Server to reduce your costs
Mandriva Enterprise Server 5 eliminates repetitive tasks, letting you make the most of your teams by focusing on missions with high added value.

Mandriva Enterprise Server 5 will instantly reduce your operating costs.

Server installation wizard

Designed to save time when you are starting up the system, the Server Installation Wizard helps you quickly set up Free Software bricks, pre-configured by Mandriva for maximum efficiency.

This makes the integration with other bricks and the implementation of services fast and easy.

Its simplified interface saves you a lot of time: with just a few clicks, you install your web hosting service, messaging service, database, and file servers.

Mandriva Directory Server

When your services are enabled, you access Mandriva Directory Server (MDS) to manage your directories and enterprise services safely and flexibly via a complete web interface.

MDS is totally integrated in MES 5. It allows you to delegate some of the administration to your colleagues and to offer your users a single password change counter irrespective of the platform used.

MDS also has a rich and documented API so that you can easily populate an existing directory.

Five-year maintenance

Like our other versions, Mandriva Enterprise Server has a basic life cycle of five years (until 2014).

Maintenance involves the regular supply of updates to the server software (security and bug fixes).

LSB 4.0 certification

Linux Standard Base (LSB) develops and promotes a set of standards enabling inter-operatibility and compatibility between different Linux-based distributions.
 These enable applications to run seamlessly on any LSB-compliant system.

LSB helps software vendors coordination to port or build their applications to LSB.

About Mandriva

Mandriva Linux was launched in 1998 under the name of Mandrake Linux, with the goal of making Linux easier to use for everyone.
 At that time, Linux was already well-known as a powerful and stable operating system that demanded strong technical knowledge and extensive use of the command line;
 MandrakeSoft saw this as an opportunity to integrate the best graphical desktop environments and contribute its own graphical configuration utilities to quickly become famous for setting the standard in Linux ease of use.

In February 2005, MandrakeSoft merged with Brazil's Conectiva to form Mandriva S.A., with headquarters in Paris, France.
 The company's flagship product, Mandriva Linux, offers all the power and stability of Linux to both individuals and professional users in an easy-to-use and pleasant environment.
