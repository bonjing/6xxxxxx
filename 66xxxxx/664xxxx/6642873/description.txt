Kapten's third release is out from "bump" side. "All Nite Long" is a disco-tic house tune, while "Bring The Noize" reminds me of some bass music. "He Sure Can Scream" goes techno, then "Ill-Natured" has a kind of rock taste. Another version of "Photosynthesis" (included in All Around EP) closes the EP.
