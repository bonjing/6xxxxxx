The default language is Spanish but it DOES include English. If you don't want the spanish in there you can always remove it by unchecking it in mux

,Sub20hz,2011-09-12T23:13Z,i tried downloading this and went to hit the button for english and it didnt work.  Can anybody help me out.  I also tried to load it into tsmuxer (which i have never used) that didnt work either and the program kept closing.  
,Bargetti,2011-09-13T07:47Z,"@Sub20hz

If you are using Windows Media Player you will need a external audio switcher, like haali media splitter. if you are using VLC you would 

1.right click when your mouse is hoovering over the picture.

2. Select Audio

3. Audio Track

3. Track 2 [English]


but tbh, I would say download mkvtoolnix, then drag the movie into the ""Input"" Area, 

Then ""Uncheck"" the ""A_AC3"". Should be the first audio file and the second one down from the top.
of you still can't find it, then if you select one of the audio codecs and look at the bottom of the window and it says [Default Track flag -Yes] then remove that one and leave the other. I will try to check up on this page again to see if you got it"

,JYongz,2011-09-13T11:51Z,anyone could rip a 3D SBS in better quality? 
,Sub20hz,2011-09-13T16:23Z,thanks i am muxing right now.  I am also burning them to blu so i can play them on my system.  If the case is that they are wrong with the SBS business i know my tv has a button that i can press that will reverse the SBS.
,Sub20hz,2011-09-13T17:04Z,it worked beautifully thank you.  Is there a way to add chapters with that program? Or possibly just be able to fast forward so i can watch a few choice scenes over and over again?
,JYongz,2011-09-14T10:19Z,@webchella thankss for this but could you rip a better quality of thor 3D SBS? 1080p perhaps?
,Sub20hz,2011-09-15T06:01Z,i found a 1080p version on another site but the audio kept going out.  a 1080p version would be great.  Transformers 1080P woul be amazing...
,JYongz,2011-09-15T06:25Z,@Sub20hz can give me the link of the site? i give a try? thankss
,Bargetti,2011-09-15T11:28Z,if your TV has a 3D options setting then I am almost positive that in the options you can reverse them from the plain TV options settings. On my Samsung it is labeled L/R Change. but if your TV Doesn't have it then I would not give any kudos to your TV manufacturer. But I doubt it is not in your 3D options menu. Try messing with it a bit without screwing up your settings.
,akshajb,2011-09-16T18:46Z,@Sub20hz hey what does SBS backwards mean I have sony ex720 and i streak it through my laptops vlc media player through hdmi 1.4 i dont have bluray player
