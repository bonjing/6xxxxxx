Joe Purdy's voice seems to fit perfectly with the smoothness of an acoustic guitar. From the quick talking rhythm you find in the song Outlaws to the smooth twang hidden though out the song Canyon Joe this album is one of Joe Purdy's best. if you're just starting out in his music or you've been a fan from the start this album is a must add to anyones collection.
