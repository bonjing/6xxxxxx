I made a big mistake by UPX'ing the Aneesoft Software, which causes corruption while encoding.

HERE'S HOW TO FIX:
1. Replace the files in ""App"" folder with the untouched version.
2. Download from here: 
M*e*d*i*a*f*i*r*e*.*c*o*m*/*?*5*3*u*d*5*w*i*l*o*x*h*p*l"

=====================
1. Extract the .paf installer to desired location.
2. Download the untouched version from M*e*d*i*a*f*i*r*e.
3. Paste the original files from M*e*d*i*a*f*i*r*e into ""App"" folder. Select ""Yes"" to replace existing files with the same name.
4. Complete

Now when you encode, convert, etc.. it will work flawlessly.

Sorry for the inconvenience.. "
