Notes:

This is the firts show with new leading singer, Arnel Pineda.

In the firts couple of song, is hard to hear the keyboards and the voice. This is basically
because of the lousy jobs of the local crew on making the audio mix. This problem is fixed
after a few songs.

The chilean host talk way too much after the second set, and is really annoying.ThatÂ´s why
we made separate tracks for all the parts were he talks. We would like to take this oportunity
to say that most people here in Chile are not like this, and that this guy is mentally ill.

Excellent show. Arnel is an amazing singer. Hope you guys enjoy it as much as we did.

THIS RELEASE IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE STEPHANI COUSINS!!!
