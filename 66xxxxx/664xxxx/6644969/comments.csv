Anyone actually downloaded, burnt and played this yet? A bit of further information would be fantastic."
,se7enus,2011-09-02T08:28Z,"Dirty_nigger- It's twat's like you who I scrape from the dregs of society for my day job, go take a long hard look in the mirror and understand the meaning of your sad excuse of a life, drag your lifeless body from your pit and reflect on how useless you have become, you add to the problem not resolve it. You are part of the generation full of Fuck up's, you will not get the better of my you dirty little. Just seed you little shit."
,verbaln,2011-09-02T09:01Z,"so is this another game that gives the ""disc unreadable"" crap after you try and play it?"
,se7enus,2011-09-02T10:01Z,"I am educated, clearly you are not... That is all.. Seed my minions."

,se7enus,2011-09-02T10:11Z,"Bay is the best torrent site I have used, I have never had any rubbish to be honest, my worst experience actually being a Resident Evil 5 torrent which claimed the gold edition turned out to be the standard resident evil 5, hardly a complaint if you ask me, the last torrent for Rugby Challenge that was floating about was quickly removed by Pirate Bay (it is still roaming around many other sites may I add) I have confidence in this torrent but a little reassurance would go a long way, excited for this title."

,brooko1980,2011-09-06T14:23Z,"Can anyone confirm if this works or do you get asked to update or anything? It fails on verification on abgx too..

@ coggs73 - I think it may well mean ur console is banned, and therefore wont complete the update, one of my old xboxs does the same when trying to update it too.

,apb1977,2011-11-12T10:02Z,"I downloaded this, no problem.  HOWEVER, what I got was a zip file.  I extracted the file and didnt get an iso file but three folders.

I tried burning the DVD file onto dual layer disc, and it burned OK but when I put it into the X-box it reads it as a DVD file and not a game.

How can I download this as an iso file, or change it to an iso file?"
,Nath14,2012-05-31T12:37Z,it says its verified on the site but thats bs it still doesnt wanna verify this game VERY ANNOYING don't bother download unless u wanna get banned
