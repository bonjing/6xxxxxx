,Vastiny,2011-09-03T18:23Z,"Downloading now, will report back with a review to shut up gramranger, eztv never delivers crap torrents"
,Vastiny,2011-09-03T18:28Z,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this video.

Video quality is a liiittle bit low for being HD, but it's nothing to cry over - it's perfectly watchable.
Audio quality is PERFECT.

I don't see what gramranger's problem is"
,Dizzious,2011-09-04T06:59Z,"Vastiny - video resolution here is 624x352. That's complete and utter crap if you're watching it on a screen that's larger than about 10"". 

Compare that to standard TV quality - you know, the standard resolution of the old big glass CRT televisions? Those were 640x480. This is 624x352. So yes, the video quality here is shit if you're watching it on anything other than a cellphone. 

720p (which is the lowest ""hdtv"" resolution) for comparison, is 1280x720. 

So this is not HD. Not in any way, shape, or form. "
,crispy94,2011-09-04T08:07Z,its not HD but its still pretty good quality. so really your both wrong
,BlinkyBill26,2011-09-04T10:16Z,wow dizzious ur a cunt this is a perfect torrent im watching on a screen that is 1280X1080 and the quality is pretty much perfect and its a small dl aswell so watch almost straigh away THANK YOU FOR ANOTHER GREAT UPLOAD EZTV

,paper_planes,2011-09-05T19:00Z,"Jesus some people are ungrateful, cheers for the upload EZTV"
,batut,2011-09-06T20:31Z,"@gramranger, @Dizzious

,MuppetStrangler,2011-09-08T09:48Z,"Haters gonna hate,thanks for the up eztv,awesome like always!"
,the_gray_mac,2011-09-08T13:23Z,"why do so many people bitch about this, its free, stop complaining!

looks fine to me, on 17"" pc screen"
,Fuzzles,2011-09-09T00:29Z,LOL @ bitching about a cartoon not being in HD
,Spambolo,2011-09-09T20:31Z,"The other thing to bear in mind is, the first few minutes represent the characters playing a video game, and have a slightly different art style with pseduo blocky NTSC 'tv lines' overlaid on them. No, this isn't as good quality as the usual 350mb torrents, but even on a 43 inch plasma TV it's more than watchable."
,poitras,2011-09-10T12:38Z,Pay no attention to gramranger or anyone else who says an eztv upload isn't good. I've never had anything but excellent quality from any and all eztv uploads. Thanks dude!
,DillanP,2011-09-18T18:24Z,"This is an eztv torrent, so I am 99% sure it is going to be top quality. I shall report back soon."
,Phreak-Wen-C,2011-12-15T11:59Z,"We are all spoiled little bitches.

Props for the up/"
