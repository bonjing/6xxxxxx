Don't bother."
,Sammi84,2011-09-07T15:47Z,"I just downloaded this torrent. The speed was great, I was getting 1.5 Mbytes/s.

And I find the quality to be top notch HD BluRay quality. I don't know what crack Keithuk has been smoking, but I have absolutely no complaints about the quality. No jumps no pixelation.
