,wizzkid1970,2011-09-03T05:22Z,shove your crap ppvrip up your ass as thats all they worth
,snowbirds,2011-09-03T08:35Z,"Thanks for the up.

The quality is much worse than over PPV rips I've seen.  Very grainy, and dark.  Not in widescreen, rather it is a TV screen ratio.  Quality is more like an average cam, IMO.  

V -7
A - I can't tell.  pretty good I guess."

All the assholes cursin can go and fuck themselves.
Go and watch it in a 3D theater and pay or shut up you spoiled momma's boys and suffer the slavery you've brought upon yourself by buying a fancy new TV that demands hdtv signal you RETARDS!"

really bad copy ;/ "
,Demonikred,2011-09-03T15:32Z,"You know why faggots bitch and moan so much about something they get for free? Its because their connection sucks big time and they dont have the sense to download the sample first so they download in full and after 8 hours of waiting and mastabating about how good this movie is gonna be they find that the quality is not that good. Isnt that right wizzkid1970,BlackLabeled?"
,w00th00t,2011-09-03T17:58Z,"Why are you guys whining about something you just downloaded for FREE.. If you don't like the upload, just delete the files you downloaded!

Jeez and then they say women are the nagging ones.."
,majuaraan,2011-09-03T21:36Z,thats why i love ppv when you watch it on a crt it looks just like a dvdrip
,Kiraqt1,2011-09-04T03:14Z,"""why u whining its free"" 

Well its a fucking fake-labeled piece of shit CAM on a tripod stand in a 4:3 screen

No1 would ofc download this shit or even bother to comment if the uploader had the fucking decency to be honest.

So shut up fags"
,kakaba,2011-09-04T09:45Z,nice upload but its still a ppvrip i would wait for the dvd release
,AUSIEJOHN,2011-09-04T16:43Z,"Instead of sitting there FUCKING YOURSELF, why dont you share and fuck some one else you homo fucked up pieces of shit? Get a fucking life for fuck sake! Im sicking of hearing fuck this and fuck that! Its all free for fuck sake! Fuck Fuck Fuck! YOU UNDERSTAND? ITS FUCKING FREE! Any way, to change the subject,,, ANYONE WANT TO SUCK MY COCK?

Oh, well thats great, then you and the 2 other people still waching shit on a goddamned fat-tv, can close the fucking hole to your cave and wither away. dont say that this copy is great because its not.. just imagine how an actual movie would look on your stoneage screen. hmm makes you wonder doesnt it? dumbass"

,rabbit42,2011-09-04T23:43Z,"clearly states its a PPVRIP  rip too, and that's a lie... Guess you *can't* trust those green skulls :("
,DeafMackem,2011-09-05T02:23Z,"Can't believe some people on here cursing and everything. Google ""PPVRIP"" Its ripped from a HOTEL TELEVISION idiot. Of course the quality won't be that good. thanks to the uploader for sharing it with us. I'll wait for blu-ray :)"
,VG-Saint,2011-09-05T03:32Z,Awesome Movie!
,Sugar_Skull,2011-09-05T04:09Z,I'm not gonna DL because it seems that the quality is low. but the people who are talking shit like wizz kid fuck off ur a twat. He put it up for us. I'm gonna wait but thanks any way fan2
,amc28,2011-09-05T07:20Z,seed please thanks to uploader
,dlarrym1111,2011-09-05T08:18Z,"@SKiNmanikin: just because you think peoples comments are bull shit when it is really constructive critisism, then go home and cry about it. I haven't said one word that I can't back. YOU go FUCK your self. I will not have to go and pay at the theater, (although I may to see it on the big screen, but a decent extremezone copy or .BONE. copy will show up in a couple weeks so o need to go any where to spend money. Even if on your old school TV it looks fine that isn't what the man says, He usues the word RIP as meaning it as the same as a DVDrip. CAMRIP's is an incorrect term and not used because a CAM cannot be a RIP. This guy puts a CAM and aims it at his TV. Its not even from a TIVO or other DVR. Why is it this up-loader is the only one that can't seem to have his uploads in LETTERBOX and ONLY 4:3. Even on a 4:3 set, I would want the black bars and for it to be wide screen not like this piece of crap. I am just letting other downloaders know the truth. If your pussy is hurting, go and douche it, but don't wine about it. why not have a LITTLE Cheese with your WINE(ing). You would think the up-loader him or her self would protest but because what I say is true, they wisely keep there mouth shut.  EVOLVE or get left behind!!!!"
,dlarrym1111,2011-09-05T08:33Z,"@Demonikred & @SKiNmanikin and @AUSIEJOHN and @Kiraqt1:  It may be free, as is my RIGHT to speak on this subject. You must be a damn NAZI as often as you tell people what they should or shouldn't speak/complain or praise about. Have you never heard of CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM? People's comments that you all look at as complaints are suggestions, IF THIS UPLOADER TOOK THEM TO HEART, that might help his uploads be better. If you had a bugger hanging out of your nose in a fancy restaurant, wouldn't you WANT someone to tell you about it. well this upload is IwannaFan2's bugger hanging out of his nose.

A damn DOG SHIT is free also, but that doesn't mean I am taking it into my home!!! is a dog shit in the park, that doesn't mean I want to take it home with me!!! Its not that it is free, ALL do see that, It is that NOWHERE does this uploader take the time to let us (the downloaders) know that it is in 4:3 aspect ratio. ANd that it isn't a true RIP. HELL, Even a dog shit in the park lets me know what it is by its smell. Which smells the same as this upload!  Nuff said. don't read it if it bothers you. If you go to an art gallery and you think a piece of art is vulgar, do you think it will be removed because you don't like it??? If you don't like what people leave as comments, no one is making you look and read them. simply turn your eyes away, it is very easy."
,dlarrym1111,2011-09-05T08:35Z,"I do see where it says the aspect ratio, but it claims it is a RIP and it is a CAM. SO Still my point is valid."
,Mickey3Fingers,2011-09-05T22:14Z,"Sorry I agree this aint NO RIP. Although ive seen alot worse, I wouldn't download it tho unless your desperate to see this movie. Wait 2 weeks for a R5"
,Mickey3Fingers,2011-09-05T22:16Z,Forgot to say thanks to Iwannafan2 for taking time to upload so all us cheap scroungers can save a few quid :)

,reev3r,2011-09-07T12:22Z,"Wow, I am so thoroughly disappointed by the comments I have been reading lately. Isn't this supposed to be a COMMUNITY!?!?!? That means leave your comments regarding torrent quality and move on, not be a detriment to pirates the world over and be a bunch of little bitches.

RATE THE TORRENT AND MOVE ON!!! Nobody wants to have to read a hundred comments calling each other fags and fuckers just to get to the bits about torrent quality.

For those of you that have rated the torrent, THANKS!!! It is nice to see that some still have a semblance of solidarity..."
,Capn_Cunt,2011-09-07T19:08Z,"dlarrym1111 as for your rights etc the internet isnt policed by a single nation and therefore falls into chaos.  So we have the right to be dicks and treat you lke the pitiful unstable over emotional little shit dick that you obviously are.  You wrote several naive and long winded paragraphs about your insignificant and irrelevant personal opinions that not only matter none to us but considering your overall lacking of character and as far as can be seen from reading your posts, lack of balls, your opinion is rendered less than zero on the scale of shit that matters at all.  Do us a favor and go back in time and kill your mother."

,dragonzer0,2011-09-13T08:04Z,"Thanks IwannaFan2.
I don't see what people are complaing about. These people must be watching it on crap viewers. someone said it was grainy. If they were refering to the shots that were filmed through the snow, tha's what it was supposed to look like idiot.  I burned and watched it on tv and it was 10-10. I prefer these ppv (pay per view) rips because they are full screen. Wide Screen is like watching a movie on half of my tv. I have downloaded several ppv's and they have all been good. So to those that think these are crap don't download them, and quit complaining."
,h8shit,2011-09-13T15:31Z,You fuckin FAKERS leave the uploader alone UNLESS you CONTRIBUTE !!!!!!!!!!!!
,mik1180,2011-09-16T19:05Z,@dlarrym1111 - whats the point in typin a fukin essay in these comments! 1. no one will read it ans skip to the actual reviews. 2. you clog up the system with your rant. 3. get a life!!
,THEflerp,2011-09-17T09:57Z,"Wow. This is a CAM yet again. Stop mislabeling. I don't care about the aspect ratio (PPVR are supposed to have this ratio), it's the fact that it was recorded on a camera instead of a DVR. I'm not wasting time with IFLIX again, any TS is better than these torrents. Bad print."
,theadrock1,2011-09-17T10:36Z,Can anyone please direct me to a link to a rip of this movie that isn't shit? I'd appreciate it
,weirdneighbour,2011-09-20T22:44Z,"watchable on an old CRT TV ... i can see where purist HD guys would/will be pissed... good enough for me to be glad i didn't waste money at theatre, or waste time waiting til better version here .. Watch in the dark as is dark in dark scenes ... thanx "
,DarthExile,2011-09-30T01:11Z,how come these ppv version also come out like shit wtf 
,xBSAACHRIS434x,2011-10-03T20:20Z,"@dlarrym1111 THIS IS NOT A CAM!!! PPVRIP stands for pay per view rip. The uploaders order movies in a hotel room and record them. Thus, they do rip them. The quality is sometimes terrible like this one. BUT THIS IS NOT A CAM!!!!"

,tigersquall,2011-10-13T08:37Z,"@buschmanmax look at this title of this torrent. this is a straight copy/paste from the title of this torrent:

Captain America The First Avenger 2011 PPVRIP IFLIX

notice the last line where it says nothing about how this is not a true PPVRip and it is in fact a CAM of a 4:3 1980's TV screen?

sorry if i'm being ""illiterate"" but most people generally trust that the title of the torrent has some relevance to what is inside."
