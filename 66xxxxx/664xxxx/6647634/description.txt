PLOT 
In a rough style, by way of unique footage, the brutal consequences 
of modern wars are exposed. The film also depicts the ability of 
women and children to handle their everyday life after a dramatic 
war experience. Many of them live in tents or in ruins without 
walls or roofs. They are all in need of money, food, water and 
electricity. Others have lost family members, or are left with 
seriously injured children. Can war solve conflicts or create 
peace? The film follows three children through the war and the 
period after the ceasefire.
