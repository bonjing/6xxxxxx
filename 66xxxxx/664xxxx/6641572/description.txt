So annoyingly rare..even in this day an age.. i had to track them down on vinyl from ebay.

I ripped these from vinyl myself... so the quality is not 100%. but its good enough i promise

I have uploaded these albums in a zip file. 
(extract the files using winzip, winrar or expamder)


their other album (White Side of Night 1983) is missing from this torrent and my collection. please get in touch if you have it.. as i would love to hear it.
