The definitive guide to switchmode power supply design--fully updated

Covering the latest developments and techniques, Switchmode Power Supply Handbook, third edition is a thorough revision of the industry-leading resource for power supply designers. New design methods required for powering small, high-performance electronic devices are presented. Based on the authors' decades of experience, the book is filled with real-world solutions and many nomograms, and features simplified theory and mathematical analysis.

This comprehensive volume explains common requirements for direct operation from the AC line supply and discusses design, theory, and practice. Engineering requirements of switchmode systems and recommendations for active power factor correction are included. This practical guide provides you with a working knowledge of the latest topologies along with step-by-step approaches to component decisions to achieve reliable and cost-effective power supply designs.

From the Back Cover
The bestselling reference--packed with essential new material! The leading hands-on guide in this rapidly expanding area of electronics, Keith Billing's revision of the Switchmode Power Supply Handbook brings additional state-of-the-art techniques and developments to engineers at all levels. Offering sound working knowledge of the latest in topologies and clear, step-by-step approaches to component decisions, this handbook gives power supply designers practical, solutions-oriented design guidance, free of unnecessarily complicated mathematical derivations and theory. The Handbook features many new fully worked examples, as well as numerous nomograms--everything you need to design today's smaller, faster, and cooler systems. Turn to the new Part 4, and you'll find cutting-edge design expertise on: electronic ballast; power factor correction. In addition, the previously updated parts 1-3 still provide fully applicable sections on: thermal management techniques; transformers, chokes, input filters, EMI control, converters, snubber circuits, auxiliary systems, and much more. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.
