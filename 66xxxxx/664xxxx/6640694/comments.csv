,cur37ious,2011-08-31T01:08Z,"Thanks for ""Silent Girl"", k3.  Have been looking for book 3, ""Passages"" of Lois McMaster Bujold's ""The Sharing Knife"" series.  Found one torrent with all 4 in it, but no seeders, so it gets to 59.7% and stops.  I've read 1 & 2 in hardcopy, found 4 (""Horizon"") as a solo torrent, but can't find 3 anywhere."
