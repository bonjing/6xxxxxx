There seems no reason why the courtship of a wealthy bachelor like George Finch should not run sweetly to its natural conclusion. But George has fallen in love with Molly Waddington. And Mrs Waddington prefers the idea of an aristocrat to the reality of George, whom she suspects is half-witted.

Itâ€™s America during Prohibition and shy young George Finch is setting out as an artist â€“ without the encumbrance of a shred of talent. George falls in love with Molly, whose imperious stepmother Mrs Waddington insists heâ€™s not the man to marry the stepdaughter of one of New Yorkâ€™s most fashionable hostesses. Poor George â€“ he doesnâ€™t seem to stand a chance.

How George eventually triumphs over the bossy Mrs Waddington makes for a dizzying plot featuring some of Wodehouseâ€™s most appealing minor characters â€“ Mullett the butler and his light-fingered girlfriend Fanny, J. Hamilton Beamish, author of the dynamic Beamish Booklets, Officer Garroway the poetic policeman, and Sigsbee H. Waddington, the hen-pecked husband who longs for the wide open spaces of the West.
