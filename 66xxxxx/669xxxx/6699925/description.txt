The best film ever made about the Indian art of love - the Kama Sutra!
Positions, kisses and embraces from Vatsayana\'s book are presented here
in a classy way, with good looking actors, in pleasant surroundings,
attractively lit and irresistibly erotic.

\"Woman is the sacrificial fire. The lips of her vulva - the fuel, the hairs
around them - the smoke, and her love temple itself - the flame. The act of
entry is the kindling, the blaze of pleasure is the spark. In this fire the
gods offer up semen seed of which sacred offering man is born.\"

The best film ever made about Tantra and the Kama Sutra! The nine great
secrets of the tantric lovemaking are revealed here, along with demonstration
of positions from Vatsayana\'s book.

\"The search for ecstasy is as old as human history. Long ago in India, a
mystical sect called the tantrics, began experimenting with lovemaking
postures, yoga, breath control and meditation. Over the period of some 2000
years they evolve way to attain through sexual union a state of blissful
oneness, that their texts merely hint at.\"

\"When you have exhausted every means by which you can become bodily one, it is
time to realize that the true union is the union of mind and spirit.\"
