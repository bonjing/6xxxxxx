Acorn is a new image editor built with one goal in mind - simplicity. Fast, easy, and fluid, Acorn provides the options you'll need without any overhead. Acorn feels right, and won't drain your bank account.

* Take screenshots using Acorn and edit
  them right away.

* Chain together image filters to create
  stunning effects.

* Layer based image editing, an industry
  standard.

* Make new images and layers using your
  built-in iSight.

* Easy image and canvas resizing, just by
  changing the size of your window.

* Take advantage of every pixel of your
  monitor with full screen image editing.

* Tablet sensitive for pressure strokes and

  using the tablet's eraser.
* Vector shape and text layers.

* Freeform, elliptical, rectangular, and
  magic wand selections.

* Gradients.

* Create and apply custom text styles.

* Control opacity and blending modes for
  each layer.

* Write plugins using the Python scripting
  language, as well as in Objective-C.

* GPU powered. The same graphics card
  that makes your gaming experience
  smooth, helps Acorn fly through the
  toughest of graphics operations.

What's New:

* Fixed a bug where opening a zero length

* PDF would crash Acorn.

* Fix: Turned off support for automatic
  background termination in Mac OS X10.7.

* Fix: Hiding the palette with the tab key
  and then trying to use the brush tool
  where it just was would previously fail.

* Now it works as expected. Hurray!

* Fixed a bug where using the eyedropper
  tool to pick up a color wouldn't draw with
  the right color depending on what the
  colorspace your image was in.

* Fixed a bug where you would get an error
  after a warning when canceling a save for
  an image in a flat format when you had
  multiple layers.
