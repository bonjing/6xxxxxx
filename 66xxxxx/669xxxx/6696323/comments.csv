,Pimbax,2011-09-23T17:04Z,"Can you upload the pc version?

Or.. When will the pc version be released?"
,asrocker,2011-09-23T17:34Z,"Shame its the USA version, but thanks anyways :)

NeCso not everyone knows as much as you when it comes to torrents, how they gonna learn when they just get called stupid.

It will work if you have Lt+1.91/1.92 and you have a USA console."
[V],.Dude.,2011-09-23T17:38Z,"gn4ggy: PC version yet to be released,wait till 29th."
,neCso,2011-09-23T17:38Z,"gn4ggy, GOOGLE !!!!"

,bobro,2011-09-23T19:35Z,"Necso please don't be so cynical,
if youre already are taking the effort to respond, you might as well just explain the whole thing to gn4ggy. btw .dude. youre the best"
,clos7891,2011-09-23T20:08Z,im a noob sorry but will this work on 1.61 firmware
,Xoo1g,2011-09-23T20:52Z,Please upload RF or a Europan version :)
,neCso,2011-09-23T21:21Z,"salazam, you are the bitch, not me.
XGD2 is disc format (if this says anything to you)
JTAG is a mod for XBOX 360. With it you can play mooded games and do other stuff.
You have to know your dashboard, in order to know if it's gonna work. But I doubt it. You probably don't even know your name. Do some googling before you write here. Comments is for the game, not for you stupid brains. I don't came here saying ""when on PC ?"", ""can you help me, I'm a noob and I can't understand anything ?""."
,bobro,2011-09-23T21:24Z,"@clos7891
nope you'll need an firmware update to at least LT+ and have an usa console"
,nooralmadi008,2011-09-23T23:25Z,NiCe job but we need pal version

,chegue7,2011-09-24T15:09Z,i have 13146 dash number.if i update to 13599 my xbox will reflash?
,Paki0786,2011-09-24T16:53Z,How do you find out what LT version you are using?
,MastaWayne23,2011-09-24T18:46Z,"i put in the game, selected ""yes"" for the update, let it run, and after a few seconds, gave me an error saying ""the update could not be read from the disc"" i powered the console down, and powered it up again, and it took me to the same error. i removed the disc then powered down and up again, same error. my xbox is bricked right now, but some one is taking a look at it for me so il let all of you know how it turns out. i was using LT+ v 1.91 by the way, and hadnt signed into xbox live for about 5months, so didnt do any serious updates. this copy didnt work for me. if it worked for you some how, let me know your procedure. i used ABGX360 v 1.0.2"
,cesargoon,2011-09-24T19:47Z,Thank you sooo much!!! i've been playing the demo nonstop can't wait for the real thing!

,alex22408,2011-09-24T22:47Z,masterwayne23 uneed to update yur abgx to version 1.5 that was the problem if wasnt properly patched
,m3ll0nh34d,2011-09-25T00:06Z,"This game isn't released until Sept 27th and currently abgx doesn't hold the needed XeX/SS info to patch properly. Anyone who just burns this and pops it in their xbox is... well... a moron. Enjoy your bans, those who do. "
,kingofkings34,2011-09-25T01:00Z,"yo mastawayne the same happenend to me i put in the disc then it ask for the update after that is keeps saying insert the disc .is there any way out of it plzz help i,m a n00b"
,m3ll0nh34d,2011-09-25T04:48Z,"Like I said this isn't released until the 27th so abgx does not have the verified Xex/SS CRC info to compare it to an original. 

Already 2 ""bricked"" boxes in comments... this game ain't going near my xbox until I can properly verify and patch it if necessary. I would hope that most ppl with modded boxes would know better than just burn & play anything. "
,m3ll0nh34d,2011-09-25T04:54Z,"@kingofkings34 I don't know your setup but that error msg prob means the update flashed your drive back to its original firmware, as the last Kinect (13599) dash update did. You'll most likely have to flash it again with LT+ to play any backups. "
,m3ll0nh34d,2011-09-25T04:57Z,This torrent IS legit. FIFA Soccer 12 NTSC. Thanks to .Dude. for the upload
,kaimann,2011-09-25T11:12Z,"thank you so much ,I appreciate your hard work,this game works like a charm.I just can't believe that I am playing the game on 25th and it doesn't his the stores until 27th.

I extracted with winrar  ,tested with abgx and used image burn in to a verbatim dual layer,it is working great.my unit was updated with latest firmware about a month ago,not sure what version.

god bless ZRY "
,kaimann,2011-09-25T11:15Z,"God bless Dude 

I will be seeding for a while"
,Richyp007,2011-09-25T11:41Z,"Hey anybody who bricked their xbox by this you can save it download the latest dashboard from xbox.com pop it on a usb stick, insert it into the 360 and power on it should save it.  But be warned you will need to flash firmware on drive again as the update puts your drive back to stock."
,bobro,2011-09-25T14:48Z,"Lucky for me i already have a banned console so i can play freely.
I only have a PAL version.
when i put it in; the xbox recognizes the disc but wants to do a dash update, when installing it couldn't read the disc properly anymore.
Is this because of PAL???? or do i need to update my fw?"
,bobro,2011-09-25T14:49Z,Edit PAL console version; NTSC disc of course
,jorgejgs,2011-09-25T23:32Z,I'm downloaded and i'm seeding as i can
,mentokings10,2011-09-26T06:06Z,so on September 27th i can play this game on live? and can i download game updates safely? 
,promoweb,2011-09-26T10:18Z,"Please can you tell me how you patched the game with wave 2, because i patched it with 360 waves patcher v2.1.6 and it didn't work. I don't want to play online, so get banned it's not a problem for me.

I have Hitachi Drive and my dash is 12365 or something, i haven't updated to the latest dash because i read that your settings go to stock.

,lmikey18,2011-09-27T18:29Z,Is this game online safe or will it be online safe anytime soon?
,kubqq,2011-09-27T19:16Z,"Can I use this game in POLAND? It it PAL? Region FREE?

and wtf   "" RROD ""?

Please help me."
,stitchfp,2011-09-27T23:19Z,"For those of you who where stupid enough to try and update of a copy here is your problem

You've started reading the update from the copy, your firmware has been flashed to stock and now you can't read copys to complete the update

you are NOT bricked, you simply need to insert a legit disk with the update on. AFAIK dead island and fifa 12 have this update!

There is also a chance you will screw your xbox by updating it

you people should do your research! the correct method should be reflashing your xbox to stock, updating to current dash and then flashing to 1.91/1.92

Its all over the internet, google is your friend

how are you people going to cope when LT 2.0 is out? i mean really."
,aslan248,2011-09-28T17:23Z,"@stitchfp..so im ok ya reckon,I have the latest dash update and im flashed with lt 1.91?Anyways there is supposed to be a new dash update within the next month or so."
,kraider,2011-09-28T19:56Z,"i updated my xbox with the latest dash 13599,iextreme 1.51, nothing bad happened. all the older games like fifa 11 gears 2, black ops, crysis 2, still works with no problem. I am asking if i patch fifa 12 that is wave 13 to wave 2 will it still work. cause i tried 2 times burning it and failed.i also patched deus ex to wave 2 and run it throht abgx and it was red saying video and sm other stuff CRC doesnt match, if i burn it can i play it in my xbox. is there anyone that could help me!?"

,MushBear,2011-10-02T18:29Z,"WARNING: Do not press ""update now"" if you don't know how to re-mod your xbox. I pressed it and my console stopped working. If you did the same as me, there is a place called ""GMODZ"" in Markham that fixed mine. Just google it. 

Anyways, if you have the latest updated stuff, this torrent works. "
