::Plot::
  In 1914, the extraterrestrials known as Mondoshawans arrive at an ancient Egyptian temple and collect the only weapon capable of defeating the Great Evil which appears every five thousand years. The weapon consists of four stones, representing the four classical elements, and a sarcophagus that contains a Fifth Element in the form of a human, which combines the power of the other four elements into a "Divine Light" against the Great Evil. They give a key to their human contact, a priest, and instruct him to pass it on to future generations.
In 2263, the Great Evil appears in the form of a giant ball of black fire and destroys a terrestrial battleship. As the Mondoshawans return to Earth, they are ambushed by the shape-shifting Mangalores, hired by the industrialist Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman). Their spacecraft is destroyed and the only thing Earth scientists could recover was the hand of the Fifth Element, which they use to create a humanoid woman, known as "Leeloo" (Milla Jovovich). Terrified of her unfamiliar surroundings, she escapes and jumps off a ledge to land in the flying taxicab of Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis), a former major in the Special Forces.
Dallas delivers Leeloo to the current priest of the Mondoshawan key, Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm) and his apprentice, David (Charlie Creed-Miles), whereupon Cornelius learns that the four Element stones were entrusted to Diva Plavalaguna, an opera singer. Because the Mangalores failed to obtain the stones, Zorg kills them, but their compatriots attempt to obtain the Elements for themselves. General Munro (Brion James), Dallas' former superior, re-enlists Dallas and orders him to travel undercover, as a radio contest winner, to meet the Diva on a luxury cruise in space. The publicity of the contest attracts the Mangalores and Zorg to the space liner as well. Dallas takes Leeloo with him, while Cornelius instructs David to prepare the temple and stows away aboard the vessel.
The Diva is killed when Mangalores attack the ship; but Dallas retrieves the Elements from the Diva's body. He then fights the Mangalores, killing their leader, to liberate the ship. Zorg arrives and searches for the Elements; he finds a carrying case, assumes the elements are in it, and leaves behind a time bomb that causes the liner's occupants to evacuate. Zorg departs on his spacecraft, but discovers the case to be empty, so he returns to search for the Elements. At this, a dying Mangalore activates his own bomb, destroying the ship and killing Zorg and the remaining Mangalores, while Dallas, Cornelius, Leeloo, and talk-show host Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker) escape with the Elements aboard Zorg's spacecraft.
The four return to the Egyptian temple as the Great Evil approaches. The group arranges the stones and activate them by contact with the classical element that each stone represents; but Leeloo has become disappointed in humanity, and initially refuses to release the Divine Light, whereupon Dallas confesses his love for Leeloo and kisses her. In reply, Leeloo releases the Divine Light, causing the Great Evil to become dormant as a new moon in Earth's orbit.
