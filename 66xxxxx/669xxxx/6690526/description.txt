                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Seven Dwarves is a documentary series which follows the lives of seven dwarf  
 actors as they share a house together as they perform in a production of the  
 pantomime Snow White in Woking.                                               
                                                                               
 The series takes a look at the life of 26 year old Craig who has come from
 Lincoln to Woking to play 'Prof'. Craig went to drama school and has a career 
 in films and adverts as well as pantomime. Craig suffers with Moore Federman
 Syndrome, which is a very rare condition leaving him with the proportions of 
 a seven-year-old boy.
