,Jon_Millet,2011-11-06T23:25Z,"Hey TrialNerror,I would like to say thank you for these TREMENDOUS uploads that you provide! In fact,the *0nly** reason that I reg'd w/pbay was to tell you how much I/we appreciate your hard-work!!

You have also re-stoked my interest in the supernatural,I once cataloged *every** Most Haunted tv episode,and also had an out standing collection of true/supernatural horror classics,like; "" The Smurl Haunting"",

..I was in a bad relationship and lost *80%** of my collection.
P.S. Another great T.V show is called ""Sensing Murder"",theres a British(I think) series,and an American version of it also.Great stuff!"
