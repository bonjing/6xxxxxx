
"The Mambo Kings", the film version of Oscar Hijuelos' Pulitzer Prize- winning novel about the lives of two Cuban mambo musicians, offers audiences some of the world's greatest Latin American stars. 
Among them are singer Celia Cruz and banaleader-multi instrumentalist Tito Puente. Together with Joe Cuba, Machito, Tito Rodriguez and Sonoro Matancera, they offer you on this compact disc a nice sampling of authentic music from the times when Mambo was King.
The mambo, an Afro-Cuban rhythm originally developed in Afro-Cuban relegions, was introduced in Cuban dance halls during the 1940s. It became a dance fad in the USA in the 1950s until supplanted by the cha cha cha. However, the mambo had more influence on Latin American music in the long run. Among the most successful mambo band were those of Tito Puente, Machito, and Tito Rodriguez...(From Liner Notes)
