,Victus13,2011-09-25T11:44Z,"Wicked torrent. 

Much appreciated.

Though, I have to say after looking through the list a few of the games in there are not RPGS.

Specifically the Madden Series. :P"
,enders9,2011-09-26T07:58Z,"Yeah there are a few games in there that aren't RPGs, but most of them are RPGs. I actually forgot I had the Madden games in there until you mentioned it, I thought I deleted them because iirc they didn't run quite right on ePSXe.

And for some reason piratebay isn't letting me edit the list of games into the description section, so sorry about that. It keeps saying it's disabled."
