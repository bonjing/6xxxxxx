For this unique and impressive anthology, some of South Africa\\\'s top storytellers were invited to interpret the theme of touch. The result is a scintillating collection of twenty-two stories about all kinds of human interaction. There are tales of love lost, and of newfound intimacy. Some describe encounters with strangers, others explore family relationships. Most deal with touch in a physical and emotional sense; one or two consider the idea of \\\'keeping in touch\\\'.

Touch: Stories of Contact brings us work from such established luminaries as Andre Brink, Nadine Gordimer, Damon Galgut and Ivan Vladislavic, as well as exciting new Voices such as Alistair Morgan and Julia Smuts Louw. Whether poignant or light-hearted, fictional or autobiographical, these innovative stories remind us of the preciousness of touch and are a testimony to the creative talents of South Africa\\\'s writers.
