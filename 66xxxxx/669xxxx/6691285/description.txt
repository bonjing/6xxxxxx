Workaholics.S02E01.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 98MB]

[/b][/color] From the minds of the hilarious and irreverent Internet sketch group Mail Order Comedy, "Workaholics" is a workplace comedy featuring three friends who work together from 9 to 5 and live together from 5 to 9.

Dress codes, deadlines and rising before noon are not things these guys are used to.
Their brains are stuck on college cruise control and now they're trapped in an office environment with "grown ups." Together they're a three man spring break, they do their jobs and sometimes they even do them well, but they show up late, leave drunk, play pranks on one another and bend all the rules.
They live for the day... even if they don't know what day it is.
