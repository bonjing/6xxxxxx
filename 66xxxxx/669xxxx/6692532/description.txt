Randy Rhoads died in a plane crash during the Diary Of A Madman tour on March 19, 1982. After taking a couple weeks off, Ozzy decided he would rather try to go back out than sit around. April 1st they were back on the road with Bernie Torme filling in on guitar, but Bernie decided against filling in long term after a couple weeks and Brad Gillis was brought in. This was Brad Gillis's 10th gig into the tour, recorded at the Mid South Coliseum in Memphis, TN.

This is a nice sounding boot and one of the few documents of the Ozzy shows with Brad Gillis on guitar.
