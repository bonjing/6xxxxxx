[Notes]

The legendary Hendrix Winterland performance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Winterland is drawn from six stellar shows recorded over three days (October
10, 11 and 12, 1968) at San Francisco's historic Winterland Ballroom. These
special performances celebrated the two year anniversary of the Jimi Hendrix
Experience and came just as the groundbreaking album Electric Ladyland was
released.

Winterland presents some of Hendrix s most spectacular guitar work and is
filled with rare live versions of classic songs such as "Manic Depression,"
"Are You Experienced?," "Tax Free," and "Little Wing" that are not part of
any other Sony Legacy release. Fans will also enjoy Hendrix's dramatic
interpretations of Cream s "Sunshine Of Your Love" and Howlin Wolf s
"Killing Floor" [with the Experience joined by Jefferson Airplane bassist
Jack Casady] as well his rendition of Bob Dylan s "Like A Rolling Stone,"
which has been selected as the lead track for this special release.

This special deluxe box set features never before released music from each
of the six unforgettable Winterland performances. The new standard and
deluxe editions of Winterland are markedly different from a single disc
compilation, long out of print, that was briefly issued by Rykodisc in 1987
and 1988.

The deluxe edition also presents a rare interview with Hendrix recorded
backstage at the Boston Garden a few weeks after the Winterland
performances. This previously unreleased bonus provides fans with a unique
window into Hendrix's views about his background, his approach to the guitar
and songwriting and future direction of his music.

The deluxe edition also features a 36 page booked filled with previously
unpublished images by acclaimed photographers Robert Knight, Allen
Tannenbaum and Jim Marshall as well as an essay by noted Rolling Stone
journalist David Fricke.

This official bootleg recording showcases Jimi's love for the blues and
includes versions of Howlin' Wolf's "Killing Floor," the Muddy Waters
influenced "Catfish Blues" as well a majestic rendition of "Red House". The
recording also features an impromptu, extended rendition of Traffic's "Dear
Mr. Fantasy" with Buddy Miles sitting in for Mitch Mitchell. "Dear Mr.
Fantasy" is presented here in two separate parts. When the recording was
originally made, the first side of the tape ended abruptly and came off the
spool. The tape operator then hurriedly flipped the reel over, rethreaded
the tape and snapped on the record button.
