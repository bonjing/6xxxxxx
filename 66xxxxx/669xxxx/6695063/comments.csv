,Zeze1234,2011-09-23T05:52Z,"Not sure if my download got slightly corrupted somehow, but, at least in my file, at around 4:42 there's a litte ""cut"" on the video, and after that the sound if out of synch by 200ms. Since i was using VLC i just set the Audio Delay to 200ms (just press K on Vlc), and it's fine, but just letting you know."
,Nisota,2011-09-23T06:04Z,Is it just me or is eztv.it down for everyone? 
,ahiromu,2011-09-23T06:29Z,"You do a great job 95% of the time, as mentioned audio is out of sync (+200 ms is about the adjustment that works).

eztv.it hasn't worked for me for quite awhile"

,stangace,2011-09-23T09:30Z,"there must be one file floating around right now w/ people just tacking their names onto it or something cause I downloaded this file in mkv format from another site w/ the same exact problem

THE SOUND IS OUT OF SYNC

but I guess that's what you get w/ rush jobs like this"

Approx 300ms in advance of the video.  OK to adjust on my PC, but no good on my TV.

Thanks for good work."
