Dancing With the Stars -They kicked it off with a “Meet the Cast Special” show, essentially stretching a one-hour results show into two. Though I shouldn’t complain; two hours in two nights is a much better idea than a three-hour premier. I still haven’t recovered from the Bachelor Pad premiere. Ye gods."
