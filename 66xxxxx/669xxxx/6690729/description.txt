iiO (pronounced "eye-oh") was a New York City-based house music act composed of singer-songwriter Nadia Ali and producer Markus Moser. The group gained prominence for its 2001 single "Rapture", which reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. Following the success of "Rapture", iiO released several singles and the studio album Poetica in 2005. The album reached number 17 on Billboard's Top Electronic Albums Chart.

In April 2011, iiO's second studio album and final project Exit 110 was released featuring Ali on vocals.Meanwhile, in 2010 Ali had stated in interviews she was focussed on her solo career and had planned no future collaborations with iiO.Moser, on the other hand, said he decided to use material Ali had recorded before she left iiO to release a new album due to a demand by fans.
