,Clunk47,2011-09-30T16:52Z,"@ghandi253 Shut the fuck up, spoiled little punk bitch, it's free. Instead of bitchin' maybe you could say ""THANKS FOR THE EXCELLENT COPY ON RELEASE DATE!!!"" THANK YOU SUNDOX :)"
,Clunk47,2011-09-30T16:55Z,"@ghandi253 BTW I was referring to you calling them lazy, ""lethargic"", for not including a sample. Fuck samples. Make your own if you want one."

Audio sounds like it was put through a phone filter in the beginning of the movie so the audio sounds like a recorded phone call."
