Here's the latest Apple wireless bluetooth drivers for Windows 7 64 bit.
The drivers included are 4.0.0.1 Magic mouse, 4.0.0.1 Wireless keyboard, 4.0.0.1 Multitouch trackpad. And a few others for possibly wired multitouch things.

I've updated to Boot camp 3.3 and these are the files I found inside Windows. These drivers work, I have tested the magic mouse and keyboard.
