,info0,2011-09-24T00:26Z,"Actually, PC version can be downloaded from Origin if you live in USA. I could download it, but see no point as it's got date protection in place :(.

27th September date will be lifted and you'll be able to install it."
,huzzi96,2011-09-24T21:20Z, hey dude can u plz tell me the date when will the fifa 12 will release in PAL..?
,FatFreddy33,2011-09-25T17:48Z,"@FLAMinEK - this isn't XGD3 -__- , read the damn description."
,FatFreddy33,2011-09-26T13:19Z,"Hi guys, get the pal version here - https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6702770"
,FatFreddy33,2011-09-26T14:04Z,"@FLAMinEK - yeah, you're coming to my torrent which happens to be a ""XGD2"" torrent and are posting crap about a breakthrough. -__-"
,FLAMinEK,2011-09-26T16:34Z,think your an ignorant twat hitman
,FLAMinEK,2011-09-26T16:40Z,"you obviously don't follow the xbox modding scene and have no idea about it all. you obviously have no life and just come on here re-posting torrents that are already on here trying to get your name ""noticed"" cus you are a virgin but failing.
the so called crap about a breakthrough is actually quite significant"
,FatFreddy33,2011-09-26T17:08Z,"You're coming to my torrent, commenting on MY torrent and are telling me I'm ignorant. LOL!

You think this torrent is bad? Report it here - https://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29

You think I'm a bad uploader? Report it here - https://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29

I bet you didn't even know what suprbay was. Suprbay is TPB's own forum where the ""Real"" torrenters hang out, unlike noobs like you who just go around posting useless comments.

I never said that breakthrough wasn't important, in fact someone commented on that here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6692944/Gears_Of_War_3_%5BEnglish%5D_%5BRegion_Free%5D and I never said anything because that game is XGD3. 

You fail at life, so please just go back to your mom and dad."
,FLAMinEK,2011-09-26T19:13Z,whatever what a load of tosh
,wackeypei,2011-09-30T12:27Z,thnx

,FatFreddy33,2011-09-30T20:03Z,"@sebasbeta - Sorry, I don't speak Spanish... Do you want me to upload the Spanish version of this?"
,chronic2011,2011-10-01T02:13Z,Hey hitman u find it kinda weird how this isnt verified on abgx? Its been a while....
,ALXHUNTER,2011-10-04T01:09Z,Thanx Mate! Game Works Fine! Burned 2.4x with ImgBurn!!! Cheers
,DARKSUPR3MACY,2011-10-06T21:19Z,"@FLAMinEK Your a hypocritical moron..  You call someone else ""ignorant"" and then follow the post with the most ignorant thing I've read in months.  It's people like you that made me stop uploading in the first place. I hate dealing with little 10 year old pussies such as yourself. 
And one more thing, you say ""you obviously have no life and just come on here re-posting torrents that are already on here trying to get your name ""noticed"" cus you are a virgin but failing"", when A, he has 2 pages of stuff and you only have 1 thing no one could give less of a shit about.  And B, so what if this is the case?  I would much rather he did that and maintain the torrent then having to download it from the original uploader who might have 1000 seeds and 31000 leechers...  Chill your little pussy-cunt and run back to TTG."
,bachalu,2011-10-10T09:35Z,"Hey!, Where can i get the full PC version??"
