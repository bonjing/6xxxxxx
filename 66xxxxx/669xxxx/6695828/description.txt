Non-Dairy creamer was the eighth Loss Leader sampler from Warner/Reprise records came out in 1971.  This sampler was mainly to introduce listeners to some of the labels newer acts such as Little Feat, Curved Air and Brownsville Station (to Name a few).  I took the liberty of adding 12 more tracks to this compilation by artists like Deep Purple, Captain Beefheart and Van Morrison.
