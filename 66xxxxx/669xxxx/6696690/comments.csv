Zou jij ook de back to the Future trilogy in DVD kunnen oploaden?"
,barnabee18,2011-11-15T01:28Z,"Something super fishy about this torrent. I've been downloading this torrent for over a week now at shitty download speeds even though it has plenty of seeds and leeches. It finally completed, but when I went to open the file, the file size was zeroed out, like WTF! Is this my cable company (Cox) protecting their own, or...wtF? WTF!"
,arkhanrj,2011-11-25T17:14Z,this must be the slowest torrent ever!!!! I think Ill just be able to watch it next year.
