Thanks! Quality is good. You got the aspect ratio wrong but that's easy to fix, at least in VLC player.
V:8 / A:9

It's good picture the aspect ratio may not be the actual picture but, it's full screen so when I watch it on my tv its full screen (widescreen). I started making all my movie rips at 624 width and 352 height. I think its a good aspect ratio but, if you don't like it don't download plain and simple."
