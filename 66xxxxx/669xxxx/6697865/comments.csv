,edzi07,2011-10-08T23:08Z,"all ones i've looked at so far have comments on about subs not being there. i in the next day or two am gonna download, watch and say wether or not its good quality, and if subs are there"
,edzi07,2011-10-09T23:05Z,"This is complete shit, sound is all fucked up for me, although does have harcoded subs but 100% do not download"
,dauts,2011-10-11T14:40Z,"i hate mkv files !!!  just upload the iso or dvd shrink files vob.  mkv sucks, you have to convert it and when you do, it loses quality!"

For a bluray, it's very pixulated, blotchy, blocky, and colour washed.
Don't waste your time downloading this torrent

You downloaded a 4.37gb torrent for a bluray. How big do you think the source is? Do you think you can magically compress it by a factor of 10 and retain quality?"
,jdanonymous,2012-01-26T06:29Z,"@dauts fuck off, mkv is decent way for distributing HD x264 in a smaller format. there are plenty of morons uploading 25gb isos, why don't you leech off of them. The only reason you'd have to convert it is if you're using a shitty, non open-source mobile player, in which case, download the MP4: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6840138/X-MEN_FIRST_CLASS_2011_1080p_BluRay_QEBS5_AAC51_PS3_MP4-FAS

I'm waiting to download before I can judge the quality, but thanks for the rip regardless uploader."
