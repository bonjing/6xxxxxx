I cant get bootcamp to run.

And i see a 2 gig LoL torrent, but dont know if that is legit...

Any work arounds ?"
,khendrix,2011-09-23T18:58Z,The workaround is included in the torrent ;)
,cabetoto,2011-09-24T19:05Z,"This works perfectly after the mac Closure, it even allows to play the current dominion beta without needing to use bootcamp or the windows version.
Boompje and many others have worked hard and long to get this out. You can go to his page and use hte donate button to get him a beer for his efforts."
,cabetoto,2011-09-24T19:06Z,This is the page where you can donate and read a guide on how to install the game and keep playing even after Riot did their best to shut us down

Much better than the riot client."
,Sexwulf,2011-10-24T21:04Z,Works perfect :)
