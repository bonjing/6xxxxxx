"Free Falling / Shes Gone"

The fifth-year residents return for the first 
day of a year that will make or break their 
careers: Meredith faces the consequences of 
tampering with Derek's clinical trial and is 
terminated at the hospital; April tries to 
step up to the plate as Chief Resident in the 
wake of a giant sinkhole in the middle of 
Seattle; and Cristina and Owen are still at 
odds over their drastically different feelings 
for their unborn child. 
News of Meredith and Derek's unsteady 
relationship raises a red flag for Zola's 
adoption counselor; Alex quickly realizes that 
he has become the outcast of the group after 
ratting out Meredith; and Cristina makes a 
tough decision regarding her unexpected 
pregnancy. Also, Chief Webber brings Henry in 
for a last minute surgery, alarming Teddy.

18/Slow
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
