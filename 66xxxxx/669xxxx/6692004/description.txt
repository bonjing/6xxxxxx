First I want to thank the Anonymous original Open Manager coder for this talented
piece of code,
then the Payload Developers: Mathieulh, AerialX, Hermes, and Kakaroto for their
efforts on improving the Payload,
then all the Modified Open Manager coders: Moh_sakhaii, Dean, Jurai2, Drizztbsd
and everybody else that i forgot...
they all contributed in improving the OM to reach the way it is now, all efforts should
be continued to make it better each day.
