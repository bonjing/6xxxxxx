,Phntzm79,2011-09-23T04:24Z,It's funny the genesis of these uploads happened because I wanted to put her songs on my ipod but couldn't download them from Anonymous because of Zero seeders and bad trackers!So I found the songs!End of Story.

You have uploaded these songs in almost 10 torrents with small variations. I personally am interested in one song; ""video games"". After downloading this track from 3 of your uploads I find (just before and after the 2 minute mark)  you have recorded other shit in the background (which is possible if audio is stripped from the music video clip - I haven't bothered with watching that). I suggest if you are going to create multiple torrents of what is essentially a small amount of data take the time to listen to it first. Frickin' numbnuts!!"
,Phntzm79,2011-10-25T03:18Z,"Gh057man, You are an idiot. I uploaded the material in different forms to give people options as to what they wanted to download and as I was getting the material!I noticed the glitch in the song you mention but I didn't create these recordings, I simply found the material and made it available.Your freak show response about a glitch in one song tells me that you are an emotionally unstable an immature personality and probably gay!The main purpose of this was to give people her first album which was hard to find!as it existed on iTunes for a very short time. If you are only interested in one song, you are again an idiot! Phantazm79

,Gh057man,2011-10-25T16:24Z,"Thanks for you efforts anyway - but I found a 320Kbps version elsewhere (Piratebay won't allow me to mention that place here but it rhymes with nice 'o' c*nt)

Yes ... perhaps my comment bordered on an abusive rant - purely out frustration of anothers carelessness (hell.. I'm not perfect either - a fact you so kindly pointed out). Yet, labeling someone an idiot for being interested in one song is such an illogical conclusion to reach since you know not why I sort out this one song. 
Otherwise ... damnit! ... my secrets out! You indeed have me pegged - I am an emotionally unstable, immature and wussy gay Aussie. ;)  Have a nice day... mate.  "
,Phntzm79,2011-11-02T06:38Z,10486 downloads of these files and still going strong!Thanks for seeding!Phantazm79.
,Phntzm79,2011-12-04T15:49Z,Your nest is already full of shit and empty of any meaning! Time to make Birds nest soup or burn this fucker down! Peace! Phantazm79.Sheepish Grin! The Horror! The Horror! 
,Phntzm79,2011-12-04T15:50Z,"If you check out my latest Lana Del Rey Discography torrent, you will be happy to notice that a perfect, high quality, no glitches version of the song you wanted is there! What I think you fail to understand, is that when you shit on someone's work, you damage the whole torrent world and shit can your reputation at the same time! This whole thing is a work in progress! Yes? Phantazm79. "
