,LIlweedkila510,2011-09-22T09:40Z,So then is this another ISO for the JTAGS? And do you think anyone would every bypass the extra layer of security so it can be played on flashed 360's? 
,Mooneg,2011-09-22T09:54Z,"omg don't troll us ,i was like yeah!! finaly it came out ,and then in description it says that this is another jtag...this torrent should be named Gears Of War 3 Jtag [English] [Region Free]"

@LTlweedkila510 yes we will be able to bypass the new security it's just a waiting game."
,Krock0,2011-09-22T12:37Z,"Tank you .

Hahà , not JTag only . This can bee played in X360Key or Wasabi . That's why this is different of JTag releases . This is ISO ."
,jgotti85,2011-09-22T13:39Z,Dead island is also xgd3 good thing i never updated my ix lt plus because unlike you i can play just fine had my same box now 3 years and no bann or flags and i play weeks early sometimes to everyone moding they know thats why you update most of the time you burn a game so there is no safe just beware of the big updates before you just go downloading them you can message me on xbox if you want to play just pm me ...
,jgotti85,2011-09-22T13:43Z,Can someone upload the full game no j-tag i play dead island just fine on lt plus ..no reason why gears wont work ... 
,FatFreddy33,2011-09-22T13:44Z,"@Kcrock0 and clo329 - thank you, I can only wonder what is happening to humanity's intelligence. :P

@the first 3 comments - you asses are getting this for free, I didn't tell you to download it, so either take it or leave.

@LIlweedkila510 - Learn English so I can understand, thank you."
,FatFreddy33,2011-09-22T13:46Z,"@jgotti85 - try your luck. THIS GAME ISN'T JTAG, I SAID THE ONLY PROPER WAY OF THIS GAME WORKING THAT I KNOW OF IS JTAG. 

Sorry for the caps, but I want these other people to read it PROPERLY before they comment."
,clo239,2011-09-22T14:14Z,@jgottia85 only some dead island copies are xgd3 there are also some that are xgd2 that is why you can play that game.

,gymrat780,2011-09-22T15:07Z,Upload a non-jtag copy you fucking jackasses! I work long and hard during the week and have been waiting for the torrent to come out.
,FatFreddy33,2011-09-22T15:32Z,"@gymrat780 and bobo3166 - are you blind? This isn't a JTAG version, and the problem is the official game is XGD3, there is nothing uploaders can do.

And I didn't see any torrents on your pages, how about you upload something and then effing talk?

@jgotti85 - do post on how it works. and thanks for not being an idiot like some of the others.

@bubbles1z - thanks for the info."
,fatydrop10,2011-09-22T15:35Z,Can anyone confirm that you can burn this game with one of the programs that are in the comments and play the game????????

,FatFreddy33,2011-09-22T16:05Z,"@fatydrop10 - it might work, but that program isn't free, and I can't find it on TPB so I wouldn't recommend it."
,RKangeL,2011-09-22T16:05Z,"The-szk, thanks for uploading the iso game in that way we can keep it while the new flash come out and don't have to wait to download it still. But as you said i'll try my luck anyway. I let you know if works. Thanks again."

JUST SOME NEW XBOX 360 INFO HOW TO DO THE RIGHT STEPS AND BURN THE GAME TO THE NEW GUYS HERE:

1. IM DOING A DOWNLOAD NOW FOR THE 87 FILES OF THIS GAME 

2.THEN EXTRACKTING THE RAR-FILES INTO 1 ISO FILE, AND 1 DVD-TEXT FILE OF THE GAME TO PUT 2GETER IN A FILE AT THE DESKTOP. 

3. TESTING THE GAME IN ""abgx360 GUI"" THAT GIVES U A 100% GARANTE IF THE GAME IS REAL. 

4. BURNT ALL MY 50:th XBOX360 GAMES WHIT ""ImgBurn"" and it takes about 35 min. AND THE ONLY DISC GARANTIE WORKING IS ""VERBATIM DVD+R DL 8.5 GB"" WORKS FINE. MAKE SURE U HAVE DUAL LAYER BURNER IN U COMPUTER. 

5. THEN IT DEDPENDS OF U XBOX360Â´s FLASH/CHIP. I HAVE THE NEWEST LT+ 1.9 NOW AND IT WORKS PERFECT.

NOTE: WHEN I DOWNLOADED THE GAME ""BODYCOUNT"" AND WHEN I STARTED IT IN THE MENY DASHBOARD, I WAS ASKED IF I WANTED 2 UPDATE MY XBOX JUST TO START THE GAME  AND I PRESSED (YES)... 

WARNING..!!!!

(- DONÂ´T DO THAT...!!!!!). U WILL HAVE TO FLASH U XBOX360 ALL OVER AGAIN TO PLAY ANY OF U BURNT GAMES. (Only Original Games works).

FINALLY: HAVE ANYONE DONE THIS STEPS YET AND TRYIED IF THIS GAME ACCTUALLY WORKS...???

WHO CAN UPLOAD A REALLY WANTED WORKING COPY WHITOUT JTAG OF ""GEARS OF WAR 3""...???
MY GOD HOW LOOOOONG WE ALL WAITED FOR THIS GAME.

And install this program http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6595354/WinRAR_v4.01_x86__x64 [WinRaR] and extract the files. Then you'll get an iso image, and do what iggeman said on the first page.

,blitzx5,2011-09-27T00:49Z,@dolphane XGD3 is a disc format so if your drive can't read it you can't play XGD3 games
,blitzx5,2011-09-27T00:54Z,@dolphane Actually I'm not too sure how this whole thing works with your drive. It'd do you some good to do a google search.
,Raexhard,2011-09-27T00:54Z,Also I hear that when the new firmware comes out that I will have to update my xbox with it. How would I do this exactly? Sorry I'm new to this. :)
,blitzx5,2011-09-27T00:59Z,@dolphane Correction... apparently you're right. You can play XGD3 original games with no problem. I don't know about XGD3 backups but yeah...
,blitzx5,2011-09-27T01:05Z,"Guys... hate to break it to you but if you don't know how to flash firmware, that means you don't have the tools to do so. If you want your drives updated to the latest LT firmware when it comes out, you go to a local modder and pay them to do it for you."

,Loving.Carol,2011-09-28T06:23Z,"Thanks u 4 this Hitman

sorry for a noob question

am i right the only proper way to extract a XDG3 game ISO's is using the upcoming 0800 V3 firmware with xbox360 drive Benq or Liteon.

because a standard PC DVD/DL drive cannot read second partition of an XBOX 360 XGD3 game disc.

so if you din't extract this ISO using the above method will this work???

ofcourse after LT 2.0

thank again 4 this."
,junaid.kh,2011-09-28T09:16Z,"Fellows. im confused.
I HAVE BEEN USING ""ACTIVATE ISO"" SINCE BLACK OPS. N IT WORKS. ALSO UPDATED FOR KINECT, STILL WORKS.

,viso1,2011-09-28T14:26Z,"so how are you suposed to get this to play on your jtag.  with other game i just use image browser from xbox backup creator , but that cant recognise it.  NXEtoGOD says it dosnt have an xbe or xex file.
ive put both nxe and extracted games onto my xbox but nothing i try seems to open it to put on my jtag. i even tried mounting the image through deamon tools on which you can see a default.xex and the system update folder and video and audio folder but you cant transfer from that, it only comes up as something like 20meg, the rest must be hidden ?
any ideas?"

,jer77od,2011-09-29T04:23Z,wait wait hold on. if the new XGD3 game discs are supposed to hold an ENTIRE extra GB of data how the hell can you burn it with a commercially ready dual layer cd? i understand THIS game will fit. But another GB is 9.5GB ready... where in the world would you get those.. Or will the same discs work? it it just an entirely new and different and more compressed piracy scheme? Thus maintaining the 8.5GB size. 
,Hacker222,2011-09-29T06:02Z,There will be a feature called LITEMAX that will downsize the files and make them able to burn on regular dvdrDL's =] 
,SimStim,2011-09-29T17:30Z,"@jer77od at 2011-09-29 04:23 CET: 

Look at the regular size of a 360 iso, it's not using 8.5 GB in the first place, only around 7.8 GB, so +1GB (not entirely 1 GB actually) means around 8.8 (in fact, it's only about 180 MB beyond regular DVD DL).

So, how I understand the new LT-MAX to work is that those 180 MB are being ""presented"" to the system without actually being used. Partitioning on the DL media is altered for that purpose (enlarged to hold additional copy protection data). Check abgx, only few games reach as close as 180 MB to the max limit of a DL. Problems will only arise once a game master actually uses part of the additional 180 MB for game data.

As this is all new tech, I wouldn't expect that to happen any time soon. There's still just a hand full of AP2.5/2.6 game titles out there, and that tech's out for a year now. Games are still being released with SS1, etc. Most developers have more important things to do than catch up with the latest trickseries...but when they do, I'm sure C4E will have an answer to that as well. =)
"
,jer77od,2011-09-30T02:24Z,"@SimStim i never thought of it that way. FINALLY SOMEONE W/A BRAIN. thank you. I did realize the average 7.5-7.9GB but i just assumed ""if its there, take it"" ~1GB is about 12% more data. 12% better game. ETC. more content = better game? thats up for debate. im only to assume games like BF3 and POS MW3 would use all they can get. wouldn't you agree? i know i would. w/an average of 7.9GB for XGD2 and up to ~8.8 XGD3. theoretically only using ~300MB. this sure is good news for ppl who like to mod :)"

,ShinoBoy,2011-10-01T15:11Z,"Anyone know if this is 0800 compliant?  I hear if someone tries to rip an XGD3 game normally, it will have incorrect data and won't be burnable.  However, games ripped as ""0800"" are verified to be good rips.

So yeah, it works but will most likely get you banned.

[WARNING] ODE Releases on LT+ 2.0 will get your console Flagged!

most of you already knew this but these ODE releases will fail AP2.5 checks and FLAG your console for most likely a ban!

but some people on here have gone ahead and ignore warnings and tried to play, got disconnected from live and flagged!

Playing these ODE releases will result in flagging as the AP2.5 data (and most likely SS, DMI, video partition) is incorrect on those images, as a file on the X360key handles all the AP2.5 data. you were warned!

it does say ODE in the game name and u need to read the NFO of each game... these releases were fro X360key + Jtag only and were not ripped using C4evas 0800!"

Download this instead. Works 100%

I used the same method for both, the other rip works and this one doesn't. It was released even before XGD3 ripping firmware was released so there's no way this one ripped GOW3 correctly.

Jtag isnt the only way to make this game play. Update your drives custom firmware AFTER you have updated to the latest 360 dashboard. Then run this game through ABGX making sure you get all greens. Then burn this game onto a VERBATIM disk as you would any other XGD3 game. Any other writeable media is garbage. Do all that correctly and I guarantee your game will work (Until the next dashboard update) In my experience all AP2.5 games work until a new system update is released. Once you update your system, you're gonna have to repatch your game file with abgx and reburn. Everyone needs to stop wasting their time asking questions on here and complaining that their shit is now ""unreadable"". Anybody ever heard of GOOGLE?? Never had I had a question about ripping games or changing the firmware on my drive that google search results couldnt answer."
