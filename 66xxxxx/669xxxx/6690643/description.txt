John Q (2002 Denzel W) Waging All-out Unviolent War looks like this

Violence - Violating anyone's rights.  Do those with resources beyond what it takes to survive, have the right to withold those excess resources that could save a child's life?  Not according to conscience.  'I will admit just one tyrant in my life; the still, small voice within.'  Gandhi.

How much longer will you allow these tyrants to rule you?

* Head
* Flesh
* Stuff
* Subordination of others
* Subordination of your conscience to Society, Institutions

Life is the Tyrant - Heart, Consciene, Good (your Inside knows)

It is now, or never.  For you.  For the young for eternity now.

Choose.  Life.

Wage Love.

Or die.
