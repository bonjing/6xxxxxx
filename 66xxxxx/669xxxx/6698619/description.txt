A young free-spirited girl tired of her strait-laced and reactionary family surroundings breaks free to pursue an entirely new life. She jo ins the ranks of guidance-counselors running a small institution at an abandoned farm for troubled teens in a very remote part of Northern Iceland.

It is the 70Â´s and the counselors are under the influences of the time; hippiedom, sitars and therapy consisting of pseudo-psychoanalysis in the guise of confrontational and truth-seeking group therapy encounters. The arrival of a mysterious young girl sets on its head their deeply felt counter-cultural belief that all authority is bad and is undermined when their own authority and moral superiority is challenged and attacked by the rebellious teens under their care.

Deceit, desires and tragedy soon set into motion events that affect all players at the institution. (optional)The film is artfully shot by Norwegian cinematographer Sven KrÃ¶vel and effectively conveys the filmÂ´s theme of desolation by utilizing the barren landscapes as a backdrop
