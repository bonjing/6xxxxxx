Dean Lennox Kelly returns for the landmark 100th
episode of Shameless, as Mickey give Mimi an
ultimatum: either the new boiler goes or he does; and
suddenly Micky finds himself on The Jockey sofa
Kelly tells Marty to keep his distance but it's
easier said than done. There's uproar in The Jockey
when Frank pockets Cynthia's scratch card. And when
Cynthia is assaulted, Frank becomes the prime
suspect. Carl kicks off against the accusers, but
Kelly shows Carl CCTV footage of Frank near the crime
scene. Frank remembers nothing but scratch marks on
his chest tell a different story. While Frank hands
himself in, a distressed Carl seeks to prove his
dad's innocence and phones Kev Ball, who returns to
the Chatsworth like a knight in shining armour. New
video footage jogs Frank's memory, but puts him in a
stickier situation. Can a deal be made with gangster
Growbag Macready? Frank's fate rests in his hands
