This contains two albums by the Japanese band Mono; 
Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined
and One Step More and You Die

Both are really good albums, I got to see them at their first US show years ago and have been in love with them since. These are good cd rips, no skips.

If you like Godspeed you Black Emperor then you will like Mono.
