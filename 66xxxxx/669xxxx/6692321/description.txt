Long lost Christie stories found! This audiobook presents two recently rediscovered Hercule Poirot short stories by Agatha Christie. The stories were found inside 73 notebooks discovered at Greenway, Christie's family home in Devon, when the archive at the National Trust property was being established. "The Mystery of the Dog's Ball" was eventually reworked into the novel Dumb Witness, but unlike other Christie short stories-turned-novels it remained unpublished. The other story, "The Capture of Cerberus" was written to complete The Labours of Hercules, a collection which followed the 12 cases Poirot chose to end his career. Christie eventually rewrote the story with the same title for that collection. David Suchet brings breathes new life into them here in this exclusive audiobook production!

In 'The Capture of Cerberus' Poirot is holidaying in Geneva, trying to take his mind off the impending war. But a chance meeting with an old acquaintance leads to an investigation involving a Nazi dictator and an enormous hound...

'The Incident of the Dog's Ball', probably written in 1933, Poirot receives a letter from an elderly lady, written two months before and asking for help. Now she is dead, and Poirot is convinced that her beloved terrier Bob holds the key to her death.
