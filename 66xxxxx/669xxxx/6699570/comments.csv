,sputnikwood,2011-09-26T00:47Z,"Judging from the sample clip and for those that are extra picky:

Audio: 10  The higher 640 Kbps 6 channel audio really packs a punch.

Video:  7.5 There is nothing wrong with the video if you are not extra picky, but I think it is because of the slightly lower video bitrate I see small block artifacts throughout the faster action sequences. If the video didn't have these artifacts, this will be a perfect compromise of video+audio and file size.  "

                                    Is this dts

   Thank you"
,sputnikwood,2011-09-28T08:43Z,"@nani  

The info states AC3 @ 640 Kbps, so it's not DTS"
,falconss,2011-09-30T11:05Z,"video bit rate is about 2693 Kbps too low 
sound is good
 to get true 1080 P you need 8,000+ kb/s | AC-3, 640 kb/s which would be 9 GB + at least 
a 4GB will not cut it 
cheers "
