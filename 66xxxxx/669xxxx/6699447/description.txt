I've been looking for this movie for a long time and since I finally found it, I wanted to share it.
Starring John Ritter, Annette O'Toole and Rue McClanahan this is the story of Frank Baum and how the "Wonderful Wizard of Oz" came about. I hope everyone enjoys this story as much as I did especially since this is my first attempt at creating a torrent.
