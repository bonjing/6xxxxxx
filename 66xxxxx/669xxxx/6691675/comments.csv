RIP = stripped of all FMV.

""Extremely compressed"" = ...?  Faggotry?"

,KennuX,2012-05-13T18:37Z,"@Adv3rZe478
Ripped mean's it was ripped from the original disk and compressed to a minumum size to lower the download time.Once it's done downloading it still has to extract 4 gb of the game data."
,Carrot_Bottom,2012-05-17T21:56Z,"I downloaded it. It tool 2 hours to download it and 30 minutes to install it. Click the ""Play Just Cause"" icon created on the desktop and nothing happens, just says ""Just Cause has stopped working""! I have a very good gaming laptop and it wouldn't work, how unfortunate. Save your time and avoid!"
