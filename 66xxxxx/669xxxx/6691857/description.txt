This is called The Ultimate 70s Series from Time Life and came
in a boxed set of 10CDs as pictured in the enclosed and mp3 embedded image

There are certainly some great favourites in here, and so if you prefer
you could just pick and choose - but then - why not take the whole lot - just 
as easy to share around I would guess - just as well!

cheers
