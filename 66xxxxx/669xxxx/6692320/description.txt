These guys are pretty good and deserve more exposure than they get. So help these guys out, tell all your friends about them, show them this torrent. These guys have a southern rock sound. These guys are somewhere between 3 Doors Down and Shinedown. Well, just check em' out.

Their only 3 releases so far.

Wake Up
So Long
Stereoside

All in 320, 500x500 art, and proper ID3's.

Note: Some site like Amazon list 11 tracks for the self titled album, I believe this is a mistake, I purchased the CD to get the song, and it wasn't there. The song is "Make It Look Easy" if you have this song, please post a link to it.
