I am sorry about the double torrent, I am new and was a bit confused. It won't happen again though : ).

@ TurboTacoKid 
I just figured out how to seed, so I am seeding now, my upload rate is a little slow though I will be able to setup a different connection with a high upload speed this weekend."
