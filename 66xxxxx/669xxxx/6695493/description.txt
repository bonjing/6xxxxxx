Three women race to unlock the secrets behind a series of horrifying visions that seem to predict a gruesome series of murders in this lurid thriller inspired by actual events. In the year 1432, the town of Caravaggio became the scene for a stunning religious phenomenon. The locals claimed to have experienced a vision of the Virgin Mary, and the subsequent mania inspired a talented young artist named Michelangelo Merisi. In time Merisi became Caravaggio, an artist whose mastery of lighting and striking attention to detail cemented his status as one of history's great artists. Flash forward to the early-21st Century, and young Canadian May is in the town of Caravaggio preparing to take her vows as a nun. May's divine duties are interrupted, however, by a series of disturbing premonitions that seem to show parallels to the events that unfolded back in the 15th Century. Meanwhile, talented art student Lisa and Italian translator Claudio become swept up in the grim proceedings, and an arcane secret comes to light.
