ReleaseNotes:

George Strait has routinely been releasing amazing music for the past 3 decades, so it comes as no big surprise that this album is again loaded with pure country gems. So what more could he possibly add after all these years, and his slew of #1 hits? Well, for the first time since the debut of his long career, George co-wrote 3 songs on the CD -- and his son, Bubba Strait, also had a hand in writing 4 songs on the album. Both of them teamed up to help pen the first single, "Living For The Night", which is an amazing ballad. It's one of the strongest singles of 2009, and is quickly becoming yet another huge hit for his collection.
The whole album was recorded in Key West, Florida -- and it seems to have a nice overall laid back feel to it.
