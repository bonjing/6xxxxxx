    The second episode of the documentary series takes a       
    look at bizarre and extraordinary feathered dinosaurs,    
    many of which have only just been discovered. These      
    feathered beasts are revolutionising our understanding    
    of life on Earth as they blur the boundaries between       
    what we know of dinosaurs and birds.                      
                                                             
    China sits at the heart of the feathered dinosaur         
    discoveries and is the home of one of the most unusual     
    discoveries on Earth: the epidexipteryx. Only the size    
    of a pigeon, this predator was the most bird-like of     
    any dinosaur and is the first known case of ornamental    
    feathers.                                                  
                                                              
    But feathers were not just confined to the small. From   
    caudipteryx to sinosauropteryx and the 8-metre-long       
    gigantoraptor, feathers may have been used for flight,     
    for insulation or even to intimate and attract. These     
    dinosaurs not only hint at how animals might have        
    developed flight, but also suggest that dinosaurs may     
    still live among us today - as birds.
