From the reviews: â€œAmateur astronomer Tammy Plotner takes you on a journey with your eyes to learn in a very non-technical entry-level manner what to see on the Moon. â€¦ The book is divided into a chapter for each day of a lunation cycle â€¦ . I thoroughly enjoyed reading this guide to observing the Moon. I highly recommend it to anyone interested learning about our celestial companion. You will have hours of enjoyment as this book opens up the Moon to your eyes.â€ (Robert Garfinkle, The Observatory, Vol. 131 (1223), August, 2011)

Whether you use binoculars, a small telescope or a large one, you will find the Moon offers new horizons rich in exploration opportunities. Moonwalk with Your Eyes guides the reader quickly through lunar basics: how to determine the lunar day and what lunar terminology you might encounter here and in other books. From there, you'll be taken on a guided visual journey that encompasses what can be seen at any give time for all levels of observers.
