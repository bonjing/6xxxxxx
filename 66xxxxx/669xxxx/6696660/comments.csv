,logan-xart,2011-09-25T04:05Z,"kinda sad, none of you stingy ass fucks is sharing...after all these hours I am no closer to getting this file...

...good thing Im downloading it from someone else...

...fucking leeching cowards..."
,logan-xart,2011-09-25T07:10Z,"...after 24 hours...still dont have this file...

...fucking leeches..."
,logan-xart,2011-09-25T19:12Z,"going on 36 hours and you fucking leeches still arent sharing...

ive already downloaded another one, and could have downloaded 100 others if thy existed...

...this is prime example of what is wrong with this scene...

...someone should invent a way for those who dont share to not get any of what they are downloading...

...fucking pussies are on mommas computer downloading but not sharing...

...you stingy fucks arent cool, you are just pathetic little bitches..."

It's 1.23GB in size, but you'll finish downloading that one long before you'll ever see the light at the end of the tunnel on this one, if ever. Available here:
