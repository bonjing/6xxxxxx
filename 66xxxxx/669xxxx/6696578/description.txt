Oil is the fuel that runs our lives, from domestic heating, to filling our cars. To most of us it is a necessity, to those in the oil business it is black gold, where fortunes can be made and lost!

 Tanker Truck Simulator gives you the opportunity to share in that wealth. Form your own transport business, providing all the oil needs of a huge city. Take control of one of five oil tankers and set off on the road to forming your business empire. 

Game Features:-

* Your hard earned business will grow if you are able to make successful deliveries. From your initial truck purchase to building a fleet with drivers that you hire, the decisions are yours. Plot your routes and schedules across the busy city. Buy and sell tankers as income allows, but always ensure that you have funds for fleet maintenance. A broken down truck might just cost you that contract!

 * The oil delivery business has never been so real with complex animations and features that brings the "black stuff "to life! Roll out the hoses by hand, ensuring you have set the correct pressure for the Tanker transfer. Operate superbly animated delivery staff, complete with state of the art ragdoll physics and motion capture that bring them to life on the screen! Or if you prefer, you can concentrate on the driving and let the amazing artificial intelligence take care of all the dirty work!
