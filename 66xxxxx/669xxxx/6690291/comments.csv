,SoftWarez,2011-09-21T05:19Z,it will stay dead cause the fucking new utorrent deleted my torrent on torrent list when i restarted my PC. Fuck you utorrent.
,idontcare007,2011-09-21T05:51Z,"why do you use utorrent?
Use vuze, or if you have a mac, use transmission :)"
,jbistro,2011-09-21T10:07Z,Tixati all the way! And some ppl prefer programs like uTorrent over vuze cause they use up less memory. It's a chugfest with vuze and other programs running if ur pc ain't up to speed.

,SoftWarez,2011-09-21T13:59Z,"Lol yeah, i think im going to start using Vuze. I will reupload them, as soon as possible. Dont worry, you will all get these!"

I switched to Linux and use Ktorrent, which is actually better than both of them combined. Regardless, uTorrent didn't fuck up, you did. Human error accounts for %99 of computer problems."
