,tensigh,2011-09-21T14:03Z,Can you PLEASE not split the file into multiple rar files??? They don't decompress and it doesn't save space. It's stupid to do this on files that are already compressed. Please stop.
,minadress,2011-09-23T15:15Z,perfect. will the next episode be availeble after airing in US?
