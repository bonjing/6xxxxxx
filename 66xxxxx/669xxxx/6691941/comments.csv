               thanks..!"
,QoMSoL,2011-09-28T12:59Z,"The quality is really good for the size. But are these really extended cuts? I feel like some parts are missing from the way the EC looked like when I watched it on dvd. You know, like the description of gifts from Galadriel and the info on how old Aragorn really is. Stuff like that."
,QoMSoL,2011-09-28T13:00Z,Maybe I should be looking for Director's cut or something...
,rakinmahmood,2011-09-29T15:09Z,are these movies ripped from the original blu ray extended edition?

,c3bhm,2011-10-09T04:46Z,"Curious about the consistent 3.99 gig filesize:
Wouldn't 4.7 be more ideal, so that it fits perfectly onto one DVD?

(Not complaining - very grateful - just curious!)"
,c3bhm,2011-10-11T00:55Z,"Slow (speeds rarely got over 100kB/s), but the visual quality is fantaaastic.  Sound is in perfect synch and confirmed that there are hard-coded English subs for the dwarven and elvish scenes.  This is THE version to get if you're an afficionado/superfan and can't afford to buy the blurays.  (And yes these ARE the extended versions.)"

,scabior,2011-10-17T04:57Z,"Not that I don't appreciate this and not to sound annoying, but is there any reason why the subtitles for the elvish are in a weird yellow font and not the pretty font they are originally in?"

,FatFreddy247,2012-03-09T00:01Z,"can anyone give me some advice:

these files play fine on my PC with VLC Media Player although only in stereo.

when i stream them to my network connected blu-ray player the video stutters, stops then speeds up and i get very broken sound.

if i pop one of the files to a usb stick and pop it into the usb slot on the tv plays fine in stereo

if i burn a file to blank blu-ray as data i get the same issue as streaming so its not a network bottleneck issue (gigabit/switched)

other MKV's i have downloaded from here play fine except the Jurassic Park Trilogy they are jumpy too"

What does seed mean? Does it mean that when I have downloaded the movie, that I let the movie upload again? For how long time? How much should I seed?

Thanks SaM! "
,pilti,2012-04-04T01:26Z,"Hi Skywalkz!

I am glad you ask.
Seeding is the same as sharing the movie with others. So when you have downloaded for example 30 megabytes, you can upload those 30 megabytes to other people. You can see how much you have seeded looking at how much you have uploaded. You should seed at least the same size as you downloaded. So this file you should upload at least 12.04 GiB. Though I recommend you upload 3 times the size :)

,osriccc,2012-05-20T20:07Z,"Dude, you have to say the following:

1. The movie has hardcoded yellow subs for the non-english parts.

2. The credits are completely cut off, maybe because they last like forever in the extended editions, but man...

The movies have excellent quality, if it wasn't because of the hardcoded subs and the credits being cut off really baddly, this rips would be perfect. Please specify that next time because in the case of this movie, credits are really important. Anyway, been downloading this for a long, long time, will seed but be warned about this things. I'm looking for another release already."

,drunkenmonk666,2012-06-10T18:55Z,"@Tyestor

Aspect ratio, you need to look into it. Cinematic films are not (often) shot in 16:9. They're shot in 1.85:1 or 2.39:1.. 

What does that mean? It means that you can't display a film properly in 1920x1080. It also means that blu-rays count the black bands around the image as pixels. This torrent doesn't.
