[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-29T18:51Z,"Dear DC, thanks for ruining Starfire. Replacing her with a cardboard cut-out was definitely the right move ...*sigh :(

For those of you who did not read this comic: The NEW starfire walks around in an itty-bitty bikini, we learn from her new teammates that her race of aliens ONLY have a short term memory so she doesnt remember friendships, relationships (anything with Teen Titans or that she's learned experienced) From starfire we learn she ONLY want sex, with anyone, all the time - because everything else Bores her. -Thx DC."
