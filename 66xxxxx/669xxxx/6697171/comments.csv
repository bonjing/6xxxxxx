,axen81,2011-09-24T09:28Z,"This season premiere was really bad I think :(

Hope it gets better."
,Anvil11,2011-09-24T12:56Z,"I disagree axen, I thought it was great having it all set in water, very differant enviroment that made for very exiting battles."
,guirat,2011-09-24T14:32Z,"If it really were set in water, the blaster bolts and lightsabers would have left a trail of bubbles as the energy caused the water around them to boil.  The blaster bolts probably would not have gotten very far as all their energy was used up by the water.

Anyway, great job as always, eztv!"
,shawnaldo,2011-09-24T18:54Z,complaining about how real a cartoon is? kinda stupid to act like you know how a technology that doesn't exists works. 
,Neo_aeoN,2011-09-25T14:05Z,"Yeah right on @guirat! I know like, How DID they hear underwater? AND how the hell did the pressure of being so deep not crush them into 2d cartoons!? And WHY would sharkface have legs? Someone should think a lot harder how it would really be in outer space. I mean Charles Darwin was from Mars right? For real though, it's like the target audience has been slashed by a couple of years this season if the opening has any bearing on the rest of the season. Clone Wars is EPIC. But - a teen amphibian prince to save an underwater world? Should be Kevin Costner."
,ianbrannan,2011-09-30T08:09Z,"Ok guys, i just want to point out a couple of things logically here, seeing you guys want to try to put logic to Science Fiction:

First: Last i checked Star wars was something like 20,000 years in the future. So I think human(alone) technology would be just a smidgen better then what we understand now.

Second:  200 years ago the idea of flight was Laudible, the concepts of diving vessels that could go below 100 feet were in its infancy. And the idea of going into space....Crazy man's nightmares. All the above we can do today.

Third: my favorite, how can they hear? well we can do that today. Between two divers? its called a mike/speaker combination. Im assuming they would have an external mike as well, and a computer would be able to translate the sonic waves in water into speach, same way we can listen to whales sing underwater."
,ianbrannan,2011-09-30T08:12Z,"The reality guys, is alot of what they did underwater (with the exception of the weapons) Is actually probably pretty plausible today.

Submarines, Divers, underwater talking, swimming at depths exceeding 100 meters, diving out of aerial vessels and safely landing(look up HALO jumps). And thats all today, 2011...can you imagine what they could do in the year 20,2011?"

Star Wars takes place ""a long time ago."" You disappoint me, sir."
