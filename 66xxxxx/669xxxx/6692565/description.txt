Pirates of the Flying Fortress is rife with betrayal and bloody intrigue
upon the high seas. A band of fame-hungry pirates led by the legendary
Captain Ed Teal, have become trapped in a cursed archipelago when their
ship ran aground, where they will be damned to remain forever until aided by
a hero with a strong back and a (somewhat) loyal disposition

Plots within plots and schemes within schemes devolve the crew of the
Wandering Wrath into mistrust and outright mutiny, and all the while the
lives of the islands' innocents hang perilously in the balance
