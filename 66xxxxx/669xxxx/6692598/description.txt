Bandits and Rebels is a piano and guitar duo - the result of Carlos Bandera and Sean Dorian putting notes together with nothing else to do. They both met as freshman and worked together in the band Break Before Dawn - both of which they are active members in - and they frequently would improvise together while waiting for rehearsals. This impromptu musical musing led them to create a softer and more ambient project together that would allow them to see what they wanted to see and hear what they wanted to hear.
