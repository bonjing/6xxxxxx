,Phntzm79,2011-09-21T23:07Z,The First Album Was Hard To Find!This Torrent is the Shit Legit!
,Phntzm79,2011-09-23T00:48Z,"She has been in the music business for a while and previously made an entire album with mega-producer David Kahne, shelved for reasons unclear. Del Rey found success when she started writing her own pop songs, though when asked if she writes alone her voice goes hard and she says: ""If there's a man in the room when you write he gets 50%."" It's a nearly true indictment of the frosty world of music royalties, but also an indication of her steeliness."

,Phntzm79,2011-10-13T15:00Z,"GQ: Did it change at all when you connected with David?

Lana Del Rey: I thought it was going to be the beginning of everything, but my record was shelved for two and a half years. But because it was so dark, no one wanted to spend money on promoting it. After two and a half years, everyone came to the understanding that it wasn't the project they thought it was. I was the only person on their roster, they signed me because they liked me. It was a passion project. Working with David, we thought good things were going to come. But just because you work with someone famous doesn't mean you're gonna be famous and no one wrote about that album. It was only out for two and a half months on iTunes. You would think it gave me a nice launching pad, but things stood still for a long time, until only for the last three or four months.  "

,Phntzm79,2012-01-18T16:22Z,"Lana Del Rey[Elizabeth Grant] is taking a lot of criticism after her Saturday Night Live performance from super ugly, crazy Scientologist actor turned singer Juliette Lewis! This ugly bitch is so crazy she attacks Elizabeth Grant one day then changes her mind the next day! Elizabeth Grant was clearly really nervous about the SNL gig, and it showed! Big Fuckin' Deal! She is human! In defense of Elizabeth Grant, I will upload what I think is her best live performance of the song Video Games from the Corinthia Hotel in London.Peace, Phantazm79 "
,Phntzm79,2012-01-18T16:27Z,"The haters will be assimilated! This is what I think is the best live performance of her hit song, Video Games. This shows her in her best light, dark room, alone, sexy, vulnerable but cool! Peace, Phantazm79 "
,Dr_Zee,2012-01-18T21:33Z,"All of this is confusing. Phntzm79, could you just leave a detailed chronological order of her releases? Please. 

Example: 
Kill Kill 
(Date)
(Tracks)

Lana Del Rey EP 
(Date)
(Tracks)

Lizzy Grant 
(Date)
(Tracks)

Singles 
'Bootlegs'
Etc. 

No offense, but trying to wade through all this bullshit is confusing. I only heard the song she did on SNL and I like her voice a lot. And I am interested in hearing the rest of her stuff before I rush out and buy it. 

Thank you.  "
