DigitalPh33r (now known as JonCJG)'s "Arby 'n' the Chief" Season Five


I'm a fan of Jon's machinima, so I decided to download them all in .avi 

format either through zamzar from youtube, or when it gave me this 

"target has size of 0 bytes" error, I would use the flashgot addon for 

firefox and convert to .avi with Pazera FLV to AVI convertor. I thought 

that there might be a chance that some other fans may want these videos 

as well, so I figured I would upload them for the lulz. If you're 

unsatisfied with the quality of the video I'd welcome suggestions on 

how to download them while keeping its original quality.


I will upload Hard Justice, It's a Wonderful Live, One Life Remaining, 

and Arby 'n' the Chief in their "seasons" as they are completed, and I 

get around to downloading them, in the event the reader would want 

those as well.


I'm a fan of machinima, but my horizons are limited, if anyone sees 

this and would like to recommend some lulzy machinima for my viewing 

pleasure, feel free to do so.


Love,
