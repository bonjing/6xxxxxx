Description: From the early cave dwellers who first stumbled upon psychedelic mushrooms to the over 6000-year-old tradition of
opium cultivation in the East to a modern pharmaceutical industry with over 24,000 drugs on the market, drugs have
played a role in our lives since well before recorded human history. Explore the reasons we've used drugs through
the ages, while considering the devastating consequences that accompany the choice to use certain drugs. This
fascinating, fresh, and insightful documentary will ask the question: overall, have drugs done more to help us or
hurt us? Host Dean Norris (Hank from Breaking Bad) will journey through the millennia and look in on the greatest
civilizations in human history to discover if drugs helped these societies flourish or fail and whether drug use
was holy or hedonistic, a savior or a curse?
