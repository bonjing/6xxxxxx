,dr3ad,2011-09-22T22:58Z,"Resident Evil 4 HD is only released on Games on Demand for download to the harddrive and id not released on dvd so it might not use XGD3, but i'm no expert"

,sal_man,2011-09-23T23:20Z,I transfered it to a portable hardrive using horison... the game only appears for a split second in games section in xbox and disappears.. ??? 
,wendroll,2011-09-24T20:41Z,"it is JTAG version, I check its on my NON JTAG console - it doesn't work ;("

but it doesn't show up in xm360
am i doing it wrong?"
,Davenporterk,2011-09-26T18:12Z,"Where is the profile for this game? And whoever said that crap about XGD3, first of all this is a Game on Demand game thus no need to worry about disk size and second....XGD3 is already broken."
,abdouhoua,2011-09-29T22:19Z,"i can't understand why i see the film back to the futur and its realy resident evil 4 xbox360
