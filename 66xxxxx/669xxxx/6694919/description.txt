Even though it appears to be an album of brand new material, Heroin is in fact Rap-A-Lotâ€™s attempt to collect and repackage various Z-RO songs from the past few years. And though it may have been released without input or even approval from the rapper himself, Heroin holds up as a capsule view of Roâ€™s recent output. The opening three songs provide a deadly combination. Mike Deanâ€™s â€œNever Let It Goâ€ is brawny Houston funk that would make Pimp C proud. Even though the song is almost a year old, mixtape favorite â€œDenzel Washingtonâ€ holds up to the any of 2010â€™s massive street anthems. Most crucial of all, â€œDriving Me Wildâ€ brings to bears all of Z-ROâ€™s essential qualities â€” his deft rapping, soulful singing, and love for a brooding atmosphere. The remainder of the album is spotty but the material is never less than stellar, and â€œDo Bad On My Own,â€ â€œEyez On da Prizeâ€ and â€œCome Back Wit Itâ€ confirm Z-ROâ€™s reputation as one of the few true heavyweights of this era.
