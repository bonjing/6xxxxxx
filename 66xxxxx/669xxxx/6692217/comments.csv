It is an amazing and good drug and should be legal.  It brings people together and releases your negative energy.  It shows you how excellent you can be.  You stay in control the whole time and once it is over you maintain the memories of the breakthroughs you made.  It is a healing drug for the mind and could be used to help people."
,snowbirds,2011-09-22T06:20Z,ecstacy fucking rocks.  they use it in therapy.  it makes you love people.... it heals old emotional wounds.  it connects you with other people....  don't believe the fear bullshit propaganda that says otherwise...
,Swapp,2011-09-22T07:19Z,"Are you thinking of weed? that dont hurt no one. Ecstasy can make you crazy, and in combination with alcohol be lethal. also if you get bad  Ecstasy not porperly made you have a good chance of getting fucked up.. in a bad way that is..."
,deefit,2011-09-22T10:26Z,"gwnick: you CAN get addicted to xtc. It fucks with your serotonin system and can give you a life full of depression. I was a long time user, and found it very hard to quit"
,geeman777,2011-09-22T21:16Z,"It's just the same as most drugs including alcohol, done in moderation it can be harmless enough. it's when people do stupid amounts and mix drugs that it can be deadly or have bad long term side affects. so long as you know what your doing you should be fine. of course there is risk of getting a dodgy pill but there is also a risk you'll be eaten by a shark if you go in the sea, or hit by a car or shot by someone (which statistically speaking are far more likely)."
,JeyDey,2011-09-25T22:02Z,"TO ALL COMMENTED SO FAR:

X, or Ecstacy, contains Heroine. Look that up. (sometimes its just pure molly, yeah but a lot of times its got the Herps in it)"

You're an A-grade tosser. Speaking of looking things up, try ascertaining correct spelling of Heroin. If Ecstasy or MDMA has been synthesised correctly, there will be NO heroin contained therein. Heroin is a semi-synthetic opiate and MDMA is a phenylethylamine. I'm of the opinion 'the herps', whatever the fuck that is, has eaten away the bulk of your pre-frontal cortex...the little you had to start with."
