,gwerinos,2011-11-15T11:36Z,Absolutely wonderful.  I will seed this forever!  
,Superdestruktiv,2011-12-06T00:44Z,"Excuse my stupidity, but how do I seed this? Yes, I know it does this automatically. The problem is that I downloaded this to my external hard drive, so when I unplugged and replugged my computer it stopped seeding. This is a great torrent, but it takes forever to download, so I'd like to help sharing. How do I do this? (I use ÂľTorrent.)"

If only the drive letter has changed:

1. Remove the torrent from your client
2. Add the torrent again and specify the current folder the files are located in. The client will then re-check the files and start seeding or downloading.

If you have renamed the files too:

1. Stop the torrent
2. On the ""Files"" tab right click on the files you have renamed and select ""Relocate..."" then specify the new file path for all changed files.
3. Right click on the torrent in the list and select ""Force Re-check"""

,Leolus109,2012-06-07T00:36Z,"As long as my computer is on, I will seed this forever! Just as soon as I finish downloading, of course.

I don't see anything about the videos' quality, though..."
