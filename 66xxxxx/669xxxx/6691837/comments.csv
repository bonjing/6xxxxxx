,Fallen_Gri,2011-11-14T13:34Z,Doesn't work on psp. File comes up corrupted. Works on ipod fine. ;/
,Fallen_Gri,2011-11-14T13:40Z,After a little investigation the most likely answer is that the file resolution is too high for the PSP giving the corrupted error. PSP resolution is 480Ă272 this file is 720 x 384. It may not be right but is most likely.
