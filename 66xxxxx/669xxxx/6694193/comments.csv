,Swisher223,2011-09-26T17:06Z,"I've noticed that the application is trying to connect to the internet even if the nfo says it cannot. Also, why is the application trying to access dwmapi.dll file in the system32 folder. Blocking either of these processes doesn't seem to affect the game. "
,miguelsz3,2011-09-27T00:37Z,"@Swisher223
Not a bloody clue... The only thing I know about dwmapi.dll is that its some kind of ""Window Manager API"". Too tired to care right now... Might research into it later."
