,bucknastee,2011-09-21T21:57Z,"Best quality on so far. It's your typical cam. No problems with too bright or too dark scenes. This one doesn't have the seats in view, but it does look like it is zoomed in a little too much. The top and bottom of the screen seems to be cut, close up scenes on people's faces have the top of their head missing, which directors usually don't do. Overall best quality on Pirate Bay so far."

But I did have to play it in DivX Player for some reason.
It's all good though."

Watchable movie, blurry video, but still watchable. On the other hand, audio is awful. I understand that this is Cam, but, still it is hard to hear and understand the speeches. Anyway, thank you for your effort. Nice work."
