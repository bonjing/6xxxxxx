Try in a drugstore. "
,vandammage,2011-09-28T15:52Z,Sorry internet explorer didn't show the description field so I didn't see the specs.
,vandammage,2011-09-28T16:07Z,"P.S for anyone that is downloading this, the credits are cut from both movies. 1st has awsome quality but 2nd looks awful!"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-10-14T14:03Z,"Credits are indeed cut, 5 min from the first movie & 4 min from second. I never watch the credits and others neither. Also it saved about 600 MB.

Secondly, the second movie (my rip) was encoded with higher encoding settings then the first one.
My rip:
 Encoding settings: cabac=1 / ref=5 / me=esa / subme=9 / me_range=64 / trellis=2 /  bframes=6 / b_pyramid=2 / rc=2pass / bitrate=6000 
Encoders can tell you how high these settings are.

You can see that the snap shots from blu-ray.com don't look great either:

so you can't expect from the rip to look better, even though I dear to say my rip looks slightly better thx to the encoding grain filter.
