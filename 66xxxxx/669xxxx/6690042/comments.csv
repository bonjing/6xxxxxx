Thank you SO much for this upload!!!

I had these albums on vinyl and then on cassettes that I recorded from the orginal vinyls. Alas the years managed to take their toll on both and I never managed to replace them until now.

So again: thank you VERY much for the upload. This is utterly CLASSIC music and music that NEEDS to be HEARD and SHARED!"
