"Hosanna Roseanna"

Harry (Kathy Bates), against her better 
judgment, agrees to defend Eric Sanders 
(Alfred Molina), a man accused of savagely 
killing his wife. She takes the case at 
the request of Oliver Richard (Mark 
Valley) - a hot-shot attorney from the 
very firm that fired her the previous year. 
The extremely high-profile case brings 
Harry toe-to-toe with the head honcho 
herself, D.A. Roseanna Remmick (Jean 
Smart). Meanwhile, new associate Cassie 
Reynolds (Karen Olivo) represents an artist 
whose painting was unceremoniously altered 
by the purchaser. Elsewhere, Tommy 
Jefferson (Christopher McDonald), forces 
his way into sharing Harry's new office 
space and pursues a box store giant, vying 
to be their local counsel in a huge class 
action lawsuit.
