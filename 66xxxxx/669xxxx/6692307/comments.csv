,sputnikwood,2011-09-22T00:08Z,"The game installs and runs with the provided crack (virus scanned clean) BUT I can't seem to change the graphic settings like game resolution and so forth. It only runs in 640x480 even when I have set it to 1920x1080 under the Settings.exe.

Please post if you are able to find a fix."
,71460,2011-09-22T00:56Z,A game where you have to kill defenseless animals? What's next? Kill people? oh... wait
,smoketwojoint5,2011-09-22T01:00Z,"Yeah, same here...Game installs fine and plays...You just cant change any of the graphic settings at all and its on low settings by default...Any fix will be appreciated."
,Cerebral222,2011-09-22T06:38Z,"Nice game, thanx ErikZown. @ smoke, just use the settings.exe to launch the game, it's in the :
C:\Program Files\theHunter\game folder , worked perfectly for me, hope this helps."
,sputnikwood,2011-09-22T07:47Z,"I also downloaded the official copy over at their site:

http://www.thehunter.com/pub/

Im not sure if the game available at their site is the same as this 2012 version.  Is the 2012 version a stand alone game that does not require you to sign in? It is because I created an account and downloaded their game client (around 800mb) and it is then that this version...the game resolution can be set.  Also, when I was installing their client, the files were checked, confirmed and patched.  It is only through their website that you can pick the ""area"" where you do the animal hunting.  For non-paid members you are given a standard rifle and a couple of accessories.  The game was launched through their website; this is also where you select your hunting area.

I also used the crack in this official client and it did let me into the game (with 1920 resolution) but there is no game setting for u to select the hunting area.  

I am going to try this game out.  It does look to have a steep learning curve.

The forest setting in this game is quite beautiful I have to say, Crysis 1 quality."
,doobtribe,2011-09-22T07:55Z,"Launching from settings.exe doesn't do anything for me, it doesn't apply them to the cracked game's exe :("
,doobtribe,2011-09-22T08:08Z,"Ok seems the only workaround that is to log in and launch the game from thehunter website once. After that is done the settings are saved. A better crack could'v been done, but its better than nothing at all and a thanks is deserved none the less."
,sputnikwood,2011-09-22T10:46Z,This game is really a patience tester.
,rednitro,2011-09-22T10:55Z,"Don't know what the crack is doing but i figured this is a free game.
You need to go to http://www.thehunter.com/pub/ register and you can launch the gmae from there.
If you become a paying member you get more options ect.
But its free :)"
,Mr_Klymer,2011-09-22T11:38Z,"How to configure graphics:
1)Apply your settings on Settings.exe

The free version of the game allows you to hunt Mule deer. If you would like to hunt the other species you can do so by buying a license at the hunter store."
,Thantius,2011-09-22T15:08Z,"Question is, does this torrent have the stuff that you dont get with the free version of the game?"

""Question is, does this torrent have the stuff that you dont get with the free version of the game?""

No, it does not. This torrent is pointless. The game is amazing though, as is it's graphics. I'd suggest downloading it from http://www.thehunter.com instead. It's free to play forever and no crack needed. 

You will have to pay if you want extra equipment, environments and animals, but so will you with this download as well. Very cheap to play though and def worth it. Been on it since February and I'm not going anywhere... :)"

From what I've seen you're wrong.
The free version gives you one weapon but this allows all weapons/items that I could order from the website.
The free version puts you on ""whiterun island"" (in my experience) This puts you at ""Loggers Point"".
As of yet I don't know how to change location/time (without using the website which removes the extra weapons)"
,Knowing2,2011-09-22T19:24Z,"Cont:
It also has all animals from what I can see but without an account and launching it from the website (which from I can see removes the benefits) I am unsure if you are able to track your progress.

ErikZown: Any help here? Confirm extra weapons and animals?"

No problems for me. Try re-downloading that file?"

But you can only play from one location and one Island which gets rather boring at time, the developers made this clever we need a better cracking group which creates something for us to select area to start in, as far as i know you can't hunt moose or black bear in this standard starting area"

Yes you're right. I definitely agree we need a better crack. I apologise, after researching I found you can only hunt 5 animals in the starting area. "
,Thantius,2011-09-22T23:20Z,"Besides, more than half the fun of the game is examining your kill after you're done hunting, and this you do on your account on their website.. i doubt this game can be cracked properly to allow all functions :( i would buy it cuz this game is fantastic, but really.. monthly fee? unacceptable for this kind of game imo."
,rednitro,2011-09-23T10:29Z,"I would be happy to spend some money on this, but the monthly fee is keeping me back.

Going online once also fixes your resolution.
Once you start a game from the webite you get promted to choose a resolution.
After that your settings are set.
Playing this offline with no crack is not much fun with only 1 map."

,thermobaric,2011-11-03T16:22Z,"the game works great, and you can set the graphics (watch the other comments).

PEOPLE WHO SAY THIS TORRENT IS POINTLESS
it isn't, coz if you download the free one you have 1 weapon, a small island, and 1 kind of animal.

THIS torrent has multiple weapons, a bigger island, and 5 or 6 animals, and UNLIMITED ammo. so..

thank you very much erik!"
,Pirate0571,2011-11-23T14:55Z,I need a Activation code??
,Brooce,2011-11-30T21:02Z,Yeah it definitely has content that isn't available in the free version. As others have pointed out though you can't switch islands.
,Cithramir,2012-03-15T21:22Z,"Look this upload is great and all but you are shooting at all sorts of animals but you cannot confirm your kills you cannot Calculate scores due to there being no website to upload your data to. Maybe if there was a stats calculator to see how many shots you fired how your accuracy is...

The Free version has 1 gun but it has everything else like statistics and achievements..I played this one for a while checked out everything was fun till i saw i that scores didnt work the island switching witch is fine atleast you dont have to buy licenses.. "
,dudew8,2012-03-16T16:24Z,"Thanks, this game is fun =)
Nice graphics too"
,Pooshybear,2012-04-21T10:33Z,"Great work! Fast download, easy to install.

However, does this have more than 1 map available? If so, how can I play on the different maps. Since the current only map doesn't have turkey, bear or moose."
