Our third album of deep and mysterious longform ambient music. 

A continuous 57 minute piece split into eight parts. 

The music is generative: 
each note is played in a long loop, the length of each loop if different for each note. So although the music may seem to vary only slightly, it never quite repeats itself. 

released 27 August 2011
