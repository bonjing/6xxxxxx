,vivatpb5776,2011-09-23T03:23Z,"This is clearly mislabeled. This uploader purports that there are two episodes when the season (14) just started last night. According to this website:

http://www.ultimatefighter.com/full-episodes

...there has only been one episode of Season 14. Also, if you compare the length of this release with the length of another .torrent, you will see that the time points are just about identical."
,conardenator,2011-09-23T06:16Z,"@vivatpb5776 It's two hours long buddy, therefore the length of two episodes."
,johnnydoc,2011-09-23T09:21Z,thanks man
,scottymadlove,2011-09-23T21:59Z,Let's not bicker kiddies! Episode 1 of TUF 14. Is a special 2 hour episode. They said it like a 100 times on the UFC fight night a week before the show aired.
,evilchadercheez,2011-09-29T02:51Z,the only point of this comment is to point out that vivatpb5776 is a complete fucking idiot.  somebody should really put him to sleep permanently via rear naked choke!  jackass...
