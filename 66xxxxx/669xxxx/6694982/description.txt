ReleaseNotes:

If Nirvana's Nevermind heralded alternative's ascendancy into the mainstream, Creed's mega-successful 1997 debut showed just how quickly--and craftily--alt.rock's musical hallmarks could be utterly co-opted by it. Fueled by vocalist Scott Stapp's Weiland-inspired growl, Creed rode the Seattle pop-suffused string of hits included here to become one of the 90's most successful rock acts--if one whose level of critical revile nearly matched its multi-million sales. This CD/DVD combo features 13 of the band's signature performances (including all eight of its number one singles), songs that often turn on a Christianity-inspired message that could be as opaque (the anthemic "Higher") as it was overt ("My Own Prison," "What's This Life For").
