Here's a rare release, the Venus long play album Welcome to the Modern Dance Hall in FLAC -8 format!

Venus originally started as a five-member Belgian band in 1997. They achieved moderate success in Europe for ten years, only to disband in 2007. Probably the most famous of their tracks is 'Beautiful Days' (off the album Vertigone), used in advertisements and the ending crawl for the 2004 Enki Bilal animation Immortel (ad vitam).

You can tell these guys to be a precursor to newer indie acts like Arcade Fire.

Welcome to the Modern Dance Hall was their first long play album, released in 1999 under the Sonica Factory label.
