[b]Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D

Sources:

Video: Russian DVD-9

Audio: My previous cleaned Line(from imagine originally) and endcredits from visualize
thx all

Encode:

hey, have you waited for my version? 
was loads of work btw. more than 10h

Work Done:

DVD-9 had a damaged cell on layer break, fixed that
fixed rgb colours - they were a bit off
added sharpness,rgb,brightness,denoise
For the Audio:
visualize audio was beyond repairing with all that crackle. so left me no choice to use my own cleaned full line from imagine, which was complete just the word "you" at the end and the endredits was missing, so i took that part from visualize audio and cleaned it up, you wont even notice the cut at the end.
but to all fairness credits to whom it belongs, so thx to all audio line supplier involved in this version.

Synced my old clean audio to the r5, yes it will be lipsync :P,
attached the endcredits line at the end
cleaned the russian 5.1 track from voice and entered all back into the russian track.
its now perfect ;)
no crackles - no hiss - no noise
as it should be

PS:
and as my fellow competitors joke around: yes its super duper hq 7.1 dts, or whatever fits you most in describing this hours of work.

enjoy
