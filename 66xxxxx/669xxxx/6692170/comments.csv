[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-21T20:22Z,Wow... where to start. Well as you know Batman has relaunched and the timeline is a jumbled mess. My personal favorite stories are No Man's Land [amazing] and actually Dick Grayson as Batman - So from Battle for the Cowl on. I missed a lot too - Suddenly Bruce had a son with Tali al Ghul and now he's good and robin but I missed everything before that.
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-21T20:26Z,"Dick Grayson as Batman:
Battle for the Cowl
Batman & Robin Volume 1
Batman 687-713
DC 864-881

Red Robin series was great
Gotham City Sirens also

But to catch up on Batman story - not really sure myself - I missed a lot before Bruce Wayne's death"
