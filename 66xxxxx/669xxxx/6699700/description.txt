Gary Lineker introduces highlights from the Premier League. 
The day's early kick-off sees Everton travel to Eastlands to face Manchester City. 
The home side can call upon some incredible attacking talent, with likes of Sergio Aguero, 
Carlos Tevez, Edin Dzeko, Samir Nasri and David Silva all competing for places in Roberto Mancini's 
starting line-up. Everton boss David Moyes has to work on a strictly limited budget, 
but the Toffees are always difficult opponents, as they demonstrated with a 2-1 victory at City last season. 
Elsewhere, newly-promoted Swansea head to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea, while Liverpool host Wolves 
and Stoke take on Manchester United. West Brom boss Roy Hodgson leads his side out against former club Fulham, 
while Newcastle meet Blackburn and Wigan host Tottenham.
