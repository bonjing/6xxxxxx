Trackmania United-RELOADED
Release: 2007 | Developer: Nadeo | Language: English | PC | Size: 927 MB
Genre: Racing

Like the Trackmania's before it, United features three main modes of play - Race Puzzle and Platform. These three modes are basically the same as the previous titles - Race is for timed races either against preset Bronze, Silver and Gold times or other players online, Puzzle is also timed but you have to build the track before racing with a pre-determined amount of blocks, and Platform is about staying on a usually airborne track from start to finish with as few resets as possible. All three offer unique gameplay and really show off the fun and addictive nature of the Trackmania formula.

To showcase these three modes, United again has a system much like all the other Trackmania titles - you choose which of the three modes you want to play, and then you have a choice of five difficulty settings - "Start", "Easy", "Normal", "Hard" and "Extreme". Each of these modes have a selection of tracks to choose from (except Extreme which has one track) and naturally, the harder the difficulty, the harder and usually larger/longer the tracks. In Race mode specifically, you also have the option of choosing which environment you want to race in, such as "Stadium", "Desert", "Coast" and "Rally" to name a few, which determines the tracks and car used. These environments are unlocked one by one when completing the single player Race mode, and they really offer distinct differences from one to another, mainly because cars actually feel very different from one to another now in United. However, with that said, the actual racing/driving gameplay in United is basically the same as it has always been - which means it is very fast, very arcadey, and very fun.
