Sound:Video:Network:backup:Recovery:Prepare:Burn:Write:Clean:Repair: And much much more for most : Burn this ISO to a CD or DVD: and its ready to go.
You can also use it on an USB pen drive or HDD, Follow Readme in USB folder if you donâ€™t know how to do this. 

This is a win7-PE Recovery Boot CD: I made It for myself with windows 7 ultimate. It has every tool I need on it and much More. I think some others will find it useful so here it is. Enjoy!.

It works fine on all my systems, But no doubt some systems will not load it, as with all Multi Boot systems. So Just wait for the windows 7 desktop to completely Load and the Black Dos box in taskbar to close down completely afore trying to use it, There is a lot to decompress and it takes a few mins to finish up, The mouse will drop in and out in this process. And some error boxes will come and go as it loads, You can close them as they appear if they do not auto close, This is normal as it works out your system. Once Loaded it should be fast and Stable :-)
