                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Boyzone star Ronan Keating leads a team of intrepid celebrities donning       
 wetsuits for a gruelling 56-mile relay swim across the freezing-cold waters of
 the Irish Sea. Also taking the plunge are Gadget Show guru Jason Bradbury,    
 former Atomic Kitten singer Jenny Frost, comedienne-turned-clinical           
 psychologist Pamela Stephenson and Olympic butterfly medallist Steve Parry.   
 They are joined by four experienced `super-swimmers' and two specially chosen 
 members of the public - student Nikki and teacher Olly - who make up the 11-  
 strong team hoping to raise 1million for Cancer Research UK.                 

                                 Enjoy!
