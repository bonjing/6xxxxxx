,NanoEntity,2011-09-22T04:31Z,"Thanks DUDE

Two Worlds 2 has really amazing story and the game overall is really good, some bugs here and there but nothing game breaking.

I recommend grabbing this DLC addon :)"
,Insomneac,2011-09-22T05:02Z,"I've never heard of Reloa.

Are they an off-pin of Reloaded? :)"

,CaptainCaustic,2011-09-22T14:41Z,"How can I get the serial for the DLCÂ´s ?
Not by the keygen, or what?"
,CaptainCaustic,2011-09-22T14:45Z,Anyone got the DLC serial?
,CaptainCaustic,2011-09-22T14:46Z,"Fuck, this comments doesnt work for me..."
,Aikon_News,2011-09-22T23:23Z,"How can i start play this DLC?? cuz i cant find any new quest in the log... and i cant find the boat. So how start play this new DLC??

Free hugs for all"
,Oldtimer30,2011-09-22T23:30Z,Keygen does not work. It worked on the original release. There is no phone activation option given.
,Oldtimer30,2011-09-23T00:17Z,Finally got a serial number to work. Took me 10 different generated serials to get one to work.
,true_Menace,2011-09-23T00:51Z,"Confirmed! Works great.
1. Just keep trying the keygen until it passes.
2. Start a new game, and choose ""Pirates of the Flying Fortress"".
3. Import your character.
4. Play game :)"
,xcoders,2011-09-23T17:58Z,"NFO From RELOADED:

1. Unrar.
  2. Install the addon. The original Two Worlds II is required.
  3. Start the game offline* and use the keygen from the Crack dir on the disc
     to activate using the phone method.
  4. Play the game.
  5. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT!

  * We recommend using a firewall on all executables. Remember that the game
    has 2 executables."
,Oldtimer30,2011-09-23T20:46Z,As I stated it works but it may take you more than 5 serials to get one to work. That's the problem not the instructions.

,..mull,2011-12-21T19:01Z,"Don't work for me! When i'm using the phone activator the say that the code is incorrect.

Should i just keep trying. And use different serial until they say it's correct?(I use the keygen and it passes the first serial check, then i come to the ""activator"" page)"
