IMPORTANT NOTE: PLAN B 3.0 (NOT this 'WORLD ON EDGE' ) IS THE WAY OUT. Brown just watered down 3.0 in this 'World on Edge' to appeal to a broader, more cowardly, audience! Use this 'World on Edge' (2011) to verify the Plan B 3.0 (2006) data to verify that the definitive PLAN B 3.0 WAS RIGHT ON TARGET!

AT MOST, WE HAVE 9 YEARS TO REDUCE THE WORLD'S USE OF CARBON FUEL 80 PERCENT - BY 2020, AT  THE LATEST OR - 

A. THE RAIN FORESTS WILL BURN, AND 
B. THE ARCTIC TUNDRA WILL MELT, PUTTING HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF TONS (BILLIONS, WITH A 'B')  OF CARBON AND METHANE RESPECTIVELY INTO THE ATMOSPHERE... AT WHICH POINT NO FORCE IN THE 

UNIVERSE COULD STOP THE WARMING CYCLE TO KILL CIVILIZATION, FOREVER. 
(it could be too late already, but most CLIMATE scientist say we've got till 2020 TO COMPLETE THE JOB.)

PLAN B 3.0 IS THE SCHOLARLY ACTION PLAN:

A. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS WITH PLAN A - STATUS QUO - CIVILIZATION RUIN AND COLLAPSE
B. PLAN B 3.0 - EXACTLY WHAT WE DO BY 2020 TO SAVE CIVILIZATION

83 PAGES OF SCHOLARLY REFERENCES FROM THE WORLD'S LEADING UNIVERSITIES - 

*  CLIMATE SCIENTISTS 
*  TECHNOLOGISTS 
*  SOCIAL SCIENTISTS
*  PROVEN LARGE SCALE INSTALLATIONS OF ALL PROPOSED SOLUTIONS

AT MOST (YES, AT MOST) you/we have 9 YEARS TO AVOID INEVITABLE, UNSTOPPABLE DESTRUCTION OF CIVILIZATION FOR ALL FUTURE GENERATIONS...
...Unless the 3000 scientists that have devoted themselves to Climate Science at the Leading  Universities of the world are the ones LYING, and not the oil/gas company paid SHILLS. 

UNLESS YOU TURN THE 2012 ELECTION INTO THE EQUIVALENT OF -
A. THE FIGHT TO WIN WWII, OR AT MINIMUM,
B. THE LAUCH OF US INTO THE 1960'S SPACE RACE...

...THIS IS WHAT YOU GUARANTEE FOR ALL FUTURE GENERATIONS - 

* CIVILIZATION COLLAPSE 
* DESTRUCTION OF OUR CHILDREN'S FINANCIAL FUTURE
* GLOBAL WARS FOR FOOD
* ENTIRELY DEAD SEAS
* SEA LEVEL RISE DESTROYING TRILLIONS $$$ IN PROPERTY, DISPLACING 100'S MILLIONS
* UNMITIGATED HELL ON EARTH, FOREVER

If you want to talk, moan, groan, whine, belittle - go elsewhere.  There are 10's of authoritative AUTH-WHORES (authors) that happily will take your $ for their books.

BUT IF YOU WANT A MASSIVELY FACT BASED, SCHOLARLY PLAN OF ACTION, THIS IS IT.  THERE AIN'T  NOTHIN' ELSE; NOTHIN' ELSE NEEDED.
