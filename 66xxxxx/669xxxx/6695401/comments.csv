,dansmail26,2011-09-26T15:28Z,Comments don't seem to be showing up
,dansmail26,2011-09-26T21:26Z,Has anyone else installed it?  Any problems?
,lutinx,2011-09-27T17:27Z,Is it working do we have to install the core?????
,Saki33,2011-09-30T17:38Z,"I installed it, but didn't need the keygen. After installing then ran as administrator diasable_activation. Opened program and pasted in the registration from the read file. it worked perfectly. 

I did this two days ago and this is from memory. Sometimes these installations work better when you install the trial version rather than the full version, run the disable, and then paste in the registration after opening the program. I may have done that but I don't remember now. I do remember I didn't use the keygen or install core.

Oh, almost forgot my manners; thanks heaps to virana!"
,tbits76,2011-10-14T20:06Z,"Yeah, I got a virus as soon as it finished downloading.  Even if it is a false positive, it's just annoying.  I think I'll stick with the version I have for now."
