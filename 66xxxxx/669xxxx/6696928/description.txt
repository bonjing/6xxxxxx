Plot..Tom and Jerry & the Wizard of Oz Classic Style:

 This version of the movie features a sepiatone opening. I really like the contrast between the sepiatone blandness of the Kansas world and the colorful land of Oz, so I recommend watching this version of the movie instead of the regular version which is all in color. Pointing out how the change from the muted colors of Kansas to the brilliantly colored Oz helps kids learn about creative ways to change the mood and feel of the story.
