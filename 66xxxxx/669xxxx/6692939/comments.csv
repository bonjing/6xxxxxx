,dollarscholar,2011-10-13T21:52Z,"FINAAAAALLLY!!!! It was mind boggling me that there was not a single torrent for Arliss!! Not one episode, let alone a whole season!!! This show was AWESOME, aired right before 6 feet under on HBO!!! I can't understand why this is the first torrent to come up for the show, thank you anonymous!!! Now will someone please upload the entire series!?!?! I mean, shows from the freaking 50s and 60s got entire series torrents, and old crap like punky brewster, alf, and all these random cartoons that are 20 years old got complete series torrents, so why doesn't ARLISS!?!?!? Can someone please make it happen!? I'll pay you!"
