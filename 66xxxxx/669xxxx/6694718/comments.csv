,FLAMinEK,2011-09-23T19:47Z,"cipherpunk where you been man lt1.6 is really old.
flash ya drive to stock run system update then reflash drive to lt1.91. then not long probably after this do it all again with LT2.0
best advice get a x360usb pro,ck3lite,probe3 and ext molex psu.pays for itself after a few flashes and a 8 year old could do it."
,FLAMinEK,2011-09-24T00:37Z,"wow $60.
for a $100 you could get complete flashing kit from xconsoles"

,kraider,2011-09-29T14:21Z,@gizllzon5 what did you do man cause i have hitachi with the latest dash 13599 ixtreme 1.51. did you patch the game to a lower wave and how did you burn it? THNX
,jmugwump,2011-09-29T16:15Z,How is this out almost 2 weeks before its official release? Not that I'm complaining...is this the final version of the game? Collision detection in the game pretty spotty so far...seems unfinished....thanks for the upload though. Hopefully Dark Souls/RAGE aint XGD3 either.
,dcontra,2011-10-01T16:28Z,"I have checked iso with abgx360 and it have this error:""Unable to parse file system because it appears to be corrupt""
