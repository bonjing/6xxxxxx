,WIL300,2011-09-23T18:43Z,Hi thanks for this. Is there a chance that you can do a rip with 7.1 audio in mkv or is that only possible by doing a full bluray rip. Cheers
,LigGeorge,2011-09-23T20:04Z,The dts master hd 7.1 sound stream is 4gb so it's impractical to put it inside the mkv file.Also there is alredy the hole bluray available (40GB) and the bluray 3d (36 GB).Search for them.Or do you want the main movie only?
