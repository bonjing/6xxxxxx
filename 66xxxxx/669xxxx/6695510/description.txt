See What DiskAid Can Do for You

I Want Disk Use on the iPhone (iPhone USB Drive)
There is no such thing as the \"Disk Use\" on the iPhone, and I cannot use my iPhone as an external storage like I used to on my iPod Classic to copy files from a computer to another. Thanks to DiskAid desktop application, I can transfer files using the USB cable.

Access Data on the iPhone
I have many text messages (SMS) and my \"Camera roll\" is full on my iPhone I would like to transfer all of these simply and rapidly on my computer. I learned that DiskAid is easy and lets me browse and copy all iPhone/iPod touch files quickly.

Apps File Sharing Support
It is annoying to launch iTunes in order to transfer documents to apps or retrieve files stored in these apps document\'s folders. DiskAid automatically displays every app\'s icon and lets me easily access them and rapidly transfer data, back and forth!
