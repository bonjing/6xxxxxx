Veppam (Tamil: à®µà¯†à®ªà¯à®ªà®®à¯; English: Heat) is a 2011 Indian Tamil action thriller written and directed by newcomer Anjana Ali Khan,[2] starring Nani, Karthik Kumar, Bindu Madhavi and Nithya Menen. The story narrates events from the slum areas of Chennai, showcasing characters and their struggles. The film, jointly produced by Gautham Menon's Photon Kathaas and R. S. Infotainment,[3] had been in production for over one year.[4] The film released on 29 July 2011, while a dubbed Telugu version, titled Sega, released simultaneously in Andhra Pradesh.[5] Veppam received mixed critical response upon release.[6]


Plot

The whole film unfolds in a slum in Chennai. Balaji (Muthukumar), after his mother's death and his father Jothi (Shimmore), a drunkard, leaves him on streets, works hard and ensures a decent living for his younger brother Karthik (Nani). Karthik, who studies in an engineering college, spends all his time with his friend Vishnu (Evam Karthik), who is also brought up in the locality. There is Revathy (Nithya Menen) in the neighbourhood, who loves Karthik desperately. Meanwhile Jothi takes to illegal ways and makes money working for a woman drug peddler Ammaji (Jennifer). Knowing that Vishnu is in love with Viji (Bindhu Madhavi), a call girl in the locality, Jothi decides to exploit him for his selfish gain. He gives him an assignment - to transport drugs to Pondicherry, promising to give him Viji if he completes the work. Vishnu takes the help of Karthik and goes to Pondy. However sensing that something is fishy, Vishnu returns to Chennai. What follows next is the story of 'Veppam'.

[edit]Production

Veppam was shot in 46 days.[2] Since the story was set in Chennai, it was mostly filmed in and around Chennai, with songs being canned in Mahabalipuram, Pondicherry and Kodaikanal.[7] Anjana revealed that the story revolves around three friends - two boys and one girl - from the slums, played by Nani, Karthik Kumar and Nithya Menen, respectively, with Bindu Madhavi playing the role of a call girl.[8][9] Nani and Bindu Madhavi had acted in several Telugu films before and would make their Tamil film debut through Veppam.[2] The film was also supposed to be Nithya Menen's debut Tamil film, however due to the long delay in production, it would become her second Tamil release after 180. Nani and Nithya had starred together in the Telugu sleeper hit Ala Modalaindi (2011), which prompted the makers to dub and release the film in Telugu as well.[5][10] Anjana had initially signed up with another producer, but since the project failed to take off, director Gautham Menon, under whom she had worked as an assistant director, stepped in and took over the production.[2] Produced under approximately US$550,000, the film's domestic theatrical rights were sold for US$600,000, while the television rights, international theatrical rights and the rights to the Telugu dubbed version had been sold for a total of US$270,000.[1]
