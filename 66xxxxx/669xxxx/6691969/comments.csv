And just to copy and paste what I said elsewhere as a help to others that love FO:NV

Just as a heads up to the FALLOUT fans like me -
I would not play this DLC just yet. In 7 more days (9/27/2011) 2 MORE DLCs are coming - http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas_add-ons#Gun_Runners.27_Arsenal

One is a repeat and consolidation of old stuff but the Gun Runner's Arsenal is going to have 27 new weapons and 40 new weapon mods and new challenges and achievements!!!

Now, why wait? Because the problem with Lonesome Road is that it is the LAST DLC with a mission and will NOT extend game play past the end of the story like Broken Steel did for FO3.

So, if you play this DLC, you will essentially have no reason - no enemies or missions to use the new weapons, etc. on unless you want to replay some old DLCs or restart the game.

This both pleases me (I like that they care to keep making DLC material) and pisses me off! Why the FUCK would you wait till the very end of production to release 27 new weapons??????!!!!!!

All that said...27 new weapons and 40 new mods is incentive enough to make me want to repaly the game but who the fuck has all that time(unless you are still a kid or student with no real job or financial responsibilities) with RAGE, SKYRIM, ARKHAM CITY and many others being released between now and Xmas??? lol "
,chris1010,2011-09-21T19:57Z,"@brianxxx
real job ? financial responsibilities ?...sounds like a hollow frase for somebody who is pirating software and thus stealing the wages of the people who are working to create this stuff..."
,brianxxx,2011-09-21T20:42Z,"Well, it isn't me stealing. I have been a long time fan of FO and I own my copies. Too good not to support.

But my point was simply that it is hard to restart such and in-depth game when you are working or have a family...such as I do. I miss my single dude days sometimes!!!!! lol"
,villiii,2011-09-21T20:58Z,"Chris, please read about the motives behind piracy before you go making statements like that. There's a big difference between piracy and theft."
,Bart13412,2011-09-22T08:38Z,"Torrent works,

you've got winrar folders with a BIN and a CUE file. I just copied them to my desktop, mounted the CUE file with daemon tools, installed it and it worked.

Don't forget to click on the lonesome road .esm file (data files) in the launcher menu."
,Salve92,2011-09-22T14:19Z,"@Bart Thanks, I was wondering what the hell I was supposed to do with all those winrar folders."
,Lazein,2011-09-25T16:17Z,"Mounted it, installed it on the NV folder. Doesn't work. I think its the launcher"
,Lazein,2011-09-25T16:23Z,The NV launcher doesn't update.
[V],matimike,2011-09-26T04:31Z,"just like plug n play, perfect, thank you"
,6H6P6,2011-10-06T21:45Z,"Works great thanks. I'm going to take my time with this one, seeing as it's the last DLC. Time to put the Gun Runners Arsenal to work!"
,dreamchaser89,2011-10-08T10:42Z,Thanks for share it with us :)
,ismellfunny67,2011-10-14T00:57Z,Pretty fun DLC. I have to say that Honest Hearts is still my favorite. Lonesome Road I blew through in one sitting.
,ImSoJaded,2011-11-07T12:12Z,"Considering that Lonesome Road cannot be bought in Eastern-Europe where Cenega/ZeniMax are giving us the shaft (guess what, Lonesome Road will be in the Ultimate edition slated for release in February so they expect us to buy the whole game and all DLCs again to have Lonesome Road too), the reasons for piracy are not so black and white as some of the white knights suspect. A good part of it is simple human pride: you, as a company, are much more powerful so you can bribe/force legislators to work to your benefit, we, the common people are just returning the favor. You treat us like crap, we treat you like crap."
,orca_blaze61182,2011-12-10T04:39Z,"Tracked, received a letter from my internet provider."
,fawknA,2012-01-16T01:44Z,i end up buying the games i pirate. that is if it appeases my interests
