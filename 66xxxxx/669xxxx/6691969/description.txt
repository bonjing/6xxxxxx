   Release Information:

   In Lonesome Road you are contacted by the original Courier Six, a man by
   the name of Ulysses who refused to deliver the Platinum Chip at the start
   of Fallout: New Vegas. Ulysses promises the answer as to why he didn't
   take the job,but only if you make one last journey into the
   hurricane-swept canyons of the Divide, a landscape torn apart by
   earthquakes and violent storms. It's up to you whether you take the job
   or not.

   The road to the Divide is a long and treacherous one, and of the few to
   ever walk the road, none have ever returned. Is finding answers to your
   own past worth the risk? Bring all your gear, all your weapons, but leave
   your companions behind...this is one road you must walk alone.
