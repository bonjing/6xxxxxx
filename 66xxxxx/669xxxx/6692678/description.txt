Mart Crowley's epochal 1967 comedy-drama about a gay Manhattan birthday party and its shattering aftermath came to the screen in 1970 with its original cast, most of whom would be taken in the AIDS epidemic a decade later, intact. The film marked the stunning debut of director William Friedkin ("The Exorcist," "To Live and Die in L.A."), who returned to Manhattan gay life in his 1980s thriller, "Cruising." Kenneth Nelson (the original Matt in "The Fantasticks") stars as Michael, the vicious host tearing down the wall of his fis friends' self-defenses and his own. Leonard Frey, who would go on to win an supporting actor Oscar nomination as in "Fiddler on the Roof," plays the birthday boy.
