troubleshooting: if hi-rez texture pack isnt loading properly, go to Options &gt; Configure Graphics Plugin... Make sure "Show texture enhancement options" is checked. If not, check the box, then hit OK, and go back to Configure Graphics Plugin. Now go to the tab called "Texture Enhancement" at the top of the window and make sure under Hi-resolution textures that the format is set to "Rice format."
