Well, the picture above is a screenshot of the actual title screen, and I did upload this one here a little while ago: http://i998.photobucket.com/albums/af105/bigtmoose/ZeldaMMHD.png

Other than that, just search in google for Djipis Majoras Mask texture pack. I saw about a dozen different ones before I tried the mod myself."
