,oemm1,2011-09-22T08:02Z,DOES NOT WORK!
,soulmaril,2011-09-22T10:31Z,Not a Chance!. The activation is not working and will not ever work unless supplied with a crack.
,xxxtsh,2011-09-22T11:36Z,"Other solution:
After you enter serial no, search .tmp file in your %TMP% folder (type %tmp% in start -> run). Filesize: 3,22 MB. This is an unwrapped installer. Rename it's extension from .tmp to .exe"
,NicksRof,2011-09-22T13:30Z,Works like a charm... now we need shade v1.01

Doesnt work neither with changing TEMP files ...or this key...inside key file!!
Before you write some ideas ...please try it...because this is just funny...
Still doesnt work... someone who have this already installed or unpacked should make custom installer..."
,xorxor,2011-09-22T20:23Z,"""How it is possible to rename tmp into exe when installer open?""

Use magic function called ""copy""."
,frkaipanika385,2011-09-22T21:59Z,it is not possible to copy file when used by windows in this case used by shade installer
,Markocuts,2011-09-22T22:13Z,"xxxtsh has got the method, just not explained it properly. The copying process has to be done by someone who manages to get it activated. It goes as follows:

1. Run the wrapper

2. Enter valid details in wrapper and get past the activation process

3. The shade installer will then open

4. Open the temp folder by going to run --> %tmp% 

5. Copy the latest temp file which is called nsu77F4.tmp

6. Rename the file as an .exe

I have just paid for it (hence being able to get past the activation process) and as of yet am unsure as to how good it is."
