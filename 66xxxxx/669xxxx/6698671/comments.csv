Color quality, sharpness, and detail are all fine, but there are vertical bars across the entire screen.  They're partially opaque, and not so noticeable against dark backgrounds since the lines are dark, but against light color backgrounds they stand out.  You can see them in the first few seconds of the video in the bright area above the torch in the Sony Pictures logo, and they appear throughout the entire movie.  This is a product of lousy DVD-ripping (MPEG-encoding) software, and was not on the original DVD source.  I think I'm going to keep my slightly inferior copy of this movie rather than replace it with this one and have to live with the vertical bars."
