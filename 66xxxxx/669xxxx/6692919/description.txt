Arcade artwork for MAME cabinet builders

The artwork servers get hit hard and occasionally go down, it freaks out the BYOAC users.

Some suggested a torrent be made, so I did.

Here is "http://arcadeartlibrary.com/arcade_art/" complete from September 19 2011 

It's about 2.3 GB

Also "http://vectorlib.free.fr/" complete from September 21 2011

Weighing in at 721 MB

RAR'd for a total of 2.65 GB

Let's all seed it, it will be slow at first but eventually will gain speed as more people start seeding.

Cheers!
Craig
