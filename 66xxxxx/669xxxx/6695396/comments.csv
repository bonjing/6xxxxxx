You do know it's bad advertisement for that community of yours. Who wants a community that brings you useless subs with their releases."

Deaf people, perchance.

Lots of people are deaf ye know.

Maybe ye just think of yourself, don't consider others as much as ye should do, so ye don't even consider somebody may include  subtitles for deaf fans, which are there as part of the transmission when aired, but not when captured digitally.

It's called, egocentrism, not a very noble personality trait ye've got there."
