    Johnny Worricker (Bill Nighy) is a long-serving MI5 officer. 
    His boss and best friend Benedict Baron (Michael Gambon) dies
    suddenly, leaving behind him an inexplicable file, threatening
    the stability of the organization. 

    Meanwhile, a seemingly chance encounter with Johnny's striking
    next-door neighbour and political activist Nancy Pierpan
    (Rachel Weisz) seems too good to be true. Johnny is forced to
    walk out of his job, and then out of his identity to find 
    the truth.
