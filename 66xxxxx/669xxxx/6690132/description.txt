MLK Jr. - 'MY PROBLEM IS NOT THE VIOLENT RACISTS (CORPS, PRES, CONGRESS, PRESS, ETC); MY PROBLEM IS THE GOOD PEOPLE THAT WILL NOT, DO NOT STAND UP LONG ENOUGH, WITH ENOUGH COURAGE, WILLINGNESS TO SACRIFICE, INTENSITY, SOLIDARITY... SO THAT GOOD WILL PREVAIL.'

This movie is an enormously serious and important look at how we need to wage all-out unviolent war to save Humanitys Mother - Earth, our Home, before life-support is totally and irreversibly destroyed.

This is the Courage we need.
This is the Unviolence we need.
This is the cleverness we need.
This is the Inventiveness we need.
This is the URGENCY we need.
This is the Solidarity we need.


The film depicts the historic protest in 1999, as thousands of activists arrive in Seattle, Washington in masses to protest the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999. The World Trade Organization is considered by protesters to contribute to widening the socioeconomic gap between the rich and the poor while it claims to be fixing it and increasing world hunger, disease and death.

The movie takes an in-depth look at several fictional characters during those five days in 1999 as demonstrators protested the meeting of the WTO in Seattles streets. The movie portrays conflicts between the peaceful protesters and a minority committing property destruction whose actions were widely covered by the media. Although the protest began peacefully with a goal of stopping the WTO talks, police began teargassing the crowd and the situation escalated into a full-scale riot and a State of Emergency that pitted protesters against the Seattle Police Department and the National Guard.
