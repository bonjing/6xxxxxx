,ptv83,2011-09-26T18:47Z,"youtube rips.. but terribly they've been left in flash video format (.FLV Files) ... and NOT RIPPED in HD.. they're tiny, blurry and.. well horrid.

Audio=Youtube quality
Video=Horseshit .. badly ripped and now actually WORSE than youtube quality.

Would be better if you want them on your compiter and not ""in the cloud"" to load on youtube in HD, hit the fullscreen button and record with FRAPS or another screen recorder."
