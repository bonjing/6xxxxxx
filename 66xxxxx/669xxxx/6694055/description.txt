    Juha is a sales manager of a refrigerator company. His                   
    perfect-looking family and glittering array of modern kitchen            
    appliances have just been featured in a magazine article, but in         
    reality Juha is a womanising chauvinist more at home on the road than    
    with his family. This side of Juha is well known to his colleagues in    
    the company's advertising department. On one of his business trips,      
    Juha picks up a good-looking hitch-hiker Maria, resulting in some of     
    the most daring sex scenes seen in Finnish cinema up to that time.
