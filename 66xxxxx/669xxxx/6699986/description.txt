Windows Tiny7 Unattended Activated CD (x86)



Info


Thank you for trying the very first edition of Windows Tiny7

Based on: Windows 7 Ultimate x86 build 6.1.7600.16385 RTM

To install Windows Tiny7 from this CD, set your PC
up so it will boot from the CD-ROM in the PC's BIOS.

There is no upgrade option available in Tiny7, because the option
is removed.

Only install Tiny7 onto a freshly formatted partition or hard disk.

You do not need any product key in this release - the installation
of Tiny7 is unattended, apart from in the very beginning where you
choose which drive or partition to install to.

All installations are set to US English. If you do not want the US
keyboard settings, you will have to change this in Windows when it
has installed (as opposed to choosing it at install time), its easy
enough, just open the "Keyboard Settings" folder in the desktop
eXPerience folder and read the included ReadMe.txt that is there.

Desktop eXPerience Folder

Most of these folders contain quick solutions to things that otherwise
would be buried away in the Windows GUI, or you would have to know the
command to run the item, like "control userpasswords2" will open the
screen to change your Windows 7 login password, or "intl.cpl" runs the
"Regional and Language Options" from Control Panel.

[eXPerience folder contents]
- Comodo Firewall - Download link to Comodo Firewall.
- Desktop Icon Layout - Allows you to save your desktop icon setup.
- Hibernation - Turns Hibernation on/off with one double click.

Quick Launch Enabler

On the desktop is a tool that can enable Quick Launch in just one
click. You should run this ONCE only, if you want Quick Launch
like on XP/Vista.

If the program doesn't make Quick Launch the first time, just remove
the Quick Launch toolbar and run the enabler again.

Special note:

I have used this modded OS for a few days and it seems every bit as fast
as Windows XP. If you have always wanted to use Vista, but were holding
out for Windows 7 - its worth it! This slimmed edition boots up fast,
shuts down fast, opens applications fast, even VMware v5.5 runs fast
on it once its started up. File copying seems no slower than XP. All
in all this new Windows really blows away XP because of all the new
features. You have to remember XP is from 2001 when no one even had
such a thing as "Wireless" or a SATA drive. Now all this new hardware
runs on Windows XP but the OS was never designed to run it really.
You might wonder why not just use Vista - don't even go there. Lets
just pretend Vista never existed. In fact Microsoft should have not
ever released it but I guess they had to in order to improve on it
and eventually get it right - with Windows 7.
