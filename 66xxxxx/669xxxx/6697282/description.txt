It's been a long arduous wait, but the premiere is finally here! Zak craps his pants, Nick gets scratched, and Aaron offers himself as fresh meat. The team examines Ashmore Estates, constructed in 1916 and operated until 1959 when it was purchased and utilized as a private psychiatric care facility, to attempt to find out why ghosts have been harassing people.
