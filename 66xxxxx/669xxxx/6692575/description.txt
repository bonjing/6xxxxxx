Oldblivion

Oldblivion is a piece of software which allows graphics cards which are pre DirectX9 to run Elder Scrolls: Oblivion from Bethesda. This means that Oblivion can run on cards such as Geforce 3, Geforce 4, Radeon 9200 and so on. Oldblivion is still in an early development phase, but it\'s fairly stable. However, there still are a few bugs and kinks to work out.

Supported Graphics Cards:

The following cards have been tested, and run successfully with Oldblivion:

    GeForce 3 series
