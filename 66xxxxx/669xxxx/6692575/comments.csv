,brutal_product,2011-09-22T06:48Z,"will seed this 1+:1 if confirmation, from reputable sources. 

@djroosta is this 'your groups' mod ?

ps..looks clean"
,djroosta,2011-09-22T13:45Z,"@brutal_product - It is not my own Mod, It was a request on the forums to upload it here as the other torrent has no seeders. The website i got it  from is the main site listed in the description, which by the looks of it the website has caused a few problems for people.

I've never used this nor have i played oblivion on the PC, so I Don't Know who created it (See Website).

And yes, It is Clean ( I Do not like viruses in any torrents or on any of my uploads, If their was a virus in it i Wouldn't upload it)

Thanks :)"
