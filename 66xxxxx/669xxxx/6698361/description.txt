Agatha Christie's Marple

From Agatha Christie, the best selling mystery writer of all time, comes the adventures of Miss Marple, an elderly amateur sleuth whose curiosity and sharp intellect foil even the most ruthless of English criminals. Never failing in her observance of the proper niceties, Miss Marple nonetheless stares down high-society murderers, low-class burglars and avaricious blackmailers, all while kindly educating her friends about manners and high ideals.

In this upity version of the elderly (not so spinster-ish) Marple is a British television series based on the Miss Marple and other murder mystery novels by Agatha Christie. It is also known as Agatha Christie's Marple. The title character was played by Geraldine McEwan from the first to third series(04-09), until her retirement from the role. She was replaced by Julia McKenzie, from the fourth series onwards. Each episode is known for having many well-known co-stars.

The episodes (that have been adapted from the original novels and the screenplays) have been written by Kevin Elyot, Stephen Churchett, Stewart Harcourt, Tom MacRae, Patrick Barlow, Paul Rutman, and Russell Lewis.
