[T],thetorrentlord,2011-09-25T02:15Z,"Thanks for the upload. Just to let down-loaders know this is an avg. of 54 min. each show. These are available here, not my torrent, (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3680260) as standard avi files of decent quality even on a large screen TV. They avg. about 700MB each. I have watched all 9 seasons and IMHO I find it bettter than any American TV show about spies. Either way enjoy the action and great story lines."
