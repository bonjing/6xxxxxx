â–¬FlatOut 2 is a racing video game developed by Bugbear Entertainment and published by Empire Interactive and Vivendi Universal Games. It is the sequel to the 2004-2005 release FlatOut.
This game is themed more on the street racing/import tuner scene than its predecessor. Another notable change is the tire grip; players can now take more control of their car, worrying less about skidding in tight turns. The game has three car classes: derby, race and street.
