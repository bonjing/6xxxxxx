,johanjack,2011-09-24T21:37Z,Guys it says no seeders but I'm seeding do not be alarmed :)
,iasi_me,2011-09-24T22:46Z,"This is good, finnaly from AppStore Flatout 2.. thank  s Anonymous !  

There is and FALCON 4 if you can upload .. thanks anyway  great upload !"
,johanjack,2011-09-25T02:19Z,Thanks man when the download finishes make sure you seed! I have a crappy connection I've only uploaded 130 MB so far srry guys. Don't know why it's saying 2 seeders. No guarantees about buying anything else from the app store unfortunately I'm on a tight budget. 
,johanjack,2011-09-25T04:02Z,FALCON 4 does look like a sweet game though.. I'll see. Btw guys I'm on a laptop so there may be random times where I can't seed. Just wanted to apologize in advance for this.
,Phuque2,2011-09-25T08:01Z,Fake. MAS doesn't give games on DMG.
,johanjack,2011-09-25T15:45Z,I made it into a DMG. Calm down people. 
,johanjack,2011-09-25T16:01Z,"To the guy who's stealing all my upload, you better seed. "
,ClassZero,2011-09-26T18:26Z,holy shite. 13% in 2 days. what the hell is the uploader using a 2400 baud modem. narrow your upload connection to 2 peers or super seed please before I grow old and die. LOL
,johanjack,2011-09-26T23:09Z,I narrowed down my connection. Hang in there.
,dragoon353,2011-09-28T02:57Z,??????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!no seed
,Phuque2,2011-09-30T03:13Z,Told you it's fake. The fucking game doesn't work!
,johanjack,2011-09-30T04:20Z,could you maybe tell me what happens when you open it?
,johanjack,2011-09-30T04:23Z,"Try this, right click on the app and click on ""Show Package Contents"" then go Contents and then Mac OS. There should be a file called FlatOut 2. Terminal should open briefly and then the app should open. This should help if your system doesn't recognize it as it an app. Btw this requires 10.6.6 or higher."
,Tsc2772,2011-09-30T04:23Z,Yeah i can tell you the Flatout 2 DMG File dose nothing will not open or anything.
,johanjack,2011-09-30T04:23Z,It requires 10.6.6 to run. This could be a problem. 
,johanjack,2011-09-30T04:27Z,Try opening it with disk utility that's how I made the .dmg
,johanjack,2011-09-30T04:30Z,Take a look at this: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2138997?start=0&tstart=0
,johanjack,2011-09-30T04:33Z," You can also try deleting the following files:

Home > Library > Preferences > com.apple.frameworks.diskimages.uiagent 
Home > Library > Preferences > com.apple.diskimages.fsck"
,johanjack,2011-09-30T04:34Z,"And make sure when you right click on the dmg open with it should say ""DiskImageMounter"""
,Tsc2772,2011-09-30T04:37Z,okay did that and i get a message from the mac app store saying that this has been purchased from the mac app store and to install it i wants the original mac app user id and password how do you get around that one?
,Tsc2772,2011-09-30T04:49Z,well i am on mac lion 10.7
,awwgoddammit,2011-09-30T05:24Z,Yep....same here....needs yer apple password. 
,iasi_me,2011-10-01T12:02Z,"I open the DMG and copied the game on desktop, I double clik and apearr apple ID  but need a password for this.   

I have Snow Leopard 10.6.8  and I want to play this game from appstore if is possible.  thanks good job"
,johanjack,2011-10-02T17:37Z,"1. Log in the new App Store (from your dock) and download Twitter (recommended) or another free app

2.Create a desktop folder called App Store Crack
Now go to the Applications folder, locate Twitter, right click, Show Package Contents, navigate to Contents folder and copy _CodeSignature, _MASReceipt and CodeResources to the â€œApp Store Crackâ€ folder


3. Now drag Flatout into the Applications folder. Right click, Show Package Contents, navigate to Contents folder and delete _CodeSignature, _MASReceipt and CodeResources. Now paste in the files you copied from the Twitter.app in the previous step.

"
,iasi_me,2011-10-02T19:04Z,Thanks jack ! I will try quickly
,sandbarmark,2011-10-03T00:27Z,No luck on copying those files from another MAS purchase. Flatout 2 will run for a very short time (long enough to just show up on the dock) and then kill itself.
,sandbarmark,2011-10-03T00:55Z,Not sure how to make this work. All the above solutions have failed.
,anonymousfag,2011-10-04T18:49Z,"@ sandbarmark 
yep, same here. tried everything but failed"
,Tsc2772,2011-10-04T19:45Z,@ sandbarmark Yeah same here everything has failed. I wish there was to get this game to work. But i think the only way to get it to work is with the original mac app store ID and password. 
,sandbarmark,2011-10-06T23:54Z,@Tsc2772 & Anonymousfag: DroidIP may be willing to make a rip.
,Tsc2772,2011-10-08T04:12Z,@ sandbarmark Yeah That would be pretty sweet if he did!
