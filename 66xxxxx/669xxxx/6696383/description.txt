Stanley Donen's hilarious but affectionate 1978 spoof of 1930s skid-row studio double features, written by Larry Gelbart (TV's "MASH"). It consists of two 45-minute "features" - "Dynamite Hands," a black-and-white saga about a boxer, and "Baxter's Beauties of 1933," a backstage musical in color. Casts are same in both films - George C. Scott, Eli Wallach, Trish Van Devere, Red Buttons, Barbara Harris, Barry Bostwick and Harry Hamlin. They also appear in phony trailers for other films, including a World War I flying-ace adventure. The films send up all manner of 30's melodramas and musicals, notably Clifford Odets' "Golden Boy" and the Warner Bros. musical "42nd Street." So far the film has not been released on DVD in the US.
