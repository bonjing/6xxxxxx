[T],PirateBoy,2011-09-21T02:33Z,"@jareehDr0

512kbps is just the bandwidth of your internet connection. IT IS NOT THE DOWNLOAD SPEED. My connection was also 512kbps bandwidth but now it is 2mbps. Listen, bandwidth is the maximum connection speed that you get, it is not the download/upload speed. The corresponding download/upload speed is approximately 1/8 of the bandwidth. That is, if your bandwidth is 512kbps, dwnld/upld speed is approx. 60-70kbps. (512/8 kbps). If you want to get better speed, then you have to change your internet plan. If you don't believe me, then check your bandwidth and download speed here:

http://www.internetspeedtest.in/"
,al21918,2011-09-21T02:59Z,The thing about the 512kbps and the 64kB/s of download speed it is because the operator gives you the bandwidth in bits and the browsers and the utorrent gives you the download speed in Bytes. A Byte is a group of 8 bits. So 512kbps is the same as 64kB/s
,al21918,2011-09-21T03:01Z,"By the way, i'm only getting about 10kB/s on this torrent... :("

,dumas1000,2011-09-21T04:08Z,"Most people are going to get extremely slow speeds when downloading from of a file that is getting hammered by leechers. Any file uploaded by extremezone is death for most people in terms of their connection speed and their bandwidth. In case you're new and don't realize that. If you're speeds are low, discontinue this download and either wait a week to 10 days to pick it up again, or wait for Kaos Blackbox to release a repack/rip, which will hopefully become in a size more manageable. It sucks, I know. Those're the breaks. I want this file too, but there's no way I can download it, so I won't even try."

- Game starts ok

I solved this way:
- Never had problems with F1 2010, so I copied values from file ""hardware_settings_config.xml"" from F1 2010 to F1 2011. And now it seems it works.
The file for F1 2010 is in  "".../Documents/My Games/FormulaOne/.."" and for F1 2011 is in "".../Documents/My Games/FormulaOne2011/..""

,mrmouth,2011-09-23T16:00Z,"^ Thats retarded.

The confusion has to do with GFWL live. The common response of creating an offline account is pointless. You cannot even install the new version (updated mid 2011) offline, let alone create an offline account. So maybe it is that most people have not updated to the newer version and it is working for them.

 But oddly enough, the other game by codemasters that requires GFWL is Dirt 3, and that works on my PC, F1 2011 does not. Difference? The Razor launcher...

 This shit simply does not work for me. Ive tried everything. Desperately need a new crack, minus a launcher."

 This is a GFWL issue. They say to create an offline GFWL account, which is no longer possible, unless I am missing something.

 In July, Microsoft combined Xbox Live and GFWL. It changed everything, and I have no idea how or where to create an offline account. It even load unless connected to the internet.

 The only other game on my PC that needs GFWL is Dirt 3, also a Codemasters game. And it works just fine.

Simply go into your installed programs through the control panel and UNINSTALL Games for Windows Live and the Games for Windows Live Marketplace.

,mrmouth,2011-09-25T11:16Z,"Thanks Zappe. I kind of had a feeling it had something to do with Comodo as someone else having the same problem mentioned they used it too.

,keftes08,2011-09-25T17:00Z,First time ever got a problem. Installed and copyed crack. after that used f1 2011 launcher but after the intro razor1911... kept crashing saying binkw32.dll So i did a little research and found another crack not from here in which there was the dll and so. The only problem know is that it just crashes after the intro and nothing happens any help?? Win7 64bits
,Stefanos0879,2011-09-25T17:12Z,@TheBigHase .. i believe that you are right about it .. the only way is to ignore it ... i thought that i solved the problem .. but today i saw again the virus warning .. i believe/hope! that is harmless .. everybody seems to have the same problem .. either anti-virus or firewall wont let you run the game .. unless you disable the protection that you have .. 
,keftes08,2011-09-25T17:42Z,Found the problem. I have made a shortcut for f1 2011 launcher. It seems that u have to use the one stored in the computer. I used it and started know the problem is that is stucks in Checking storage devices . And i am just waiting and waiting and nothing happens. Any help Stefaneeee
,Sarubala,2011-09-25T17:56Z,"Just to complete what Efstratios2 has said, before you reinstall ""game for windows live"" software, you must update you Windows XP using Windows update. The problems most of you are having are related to bad Windows installation. If you connect to Windows update and there is an error, use this fix: startup>execute>regsvr32 wuaueng.dll> enter, and execute>regsvr32 wups.dll. The Windows Update will work now (maybe you don't even need to actually update Windows, only to fix it). For those who are having problems with other operating systems, Efstratios2 solution will do. Great game and upload!!! Tks extremezone!!!!"

,stuhar,2011-09-25T18:04Z,"zonealarm toolbar stops the crack working stopping the service or reinstaling zonealarm without the toolbar allows the game to run but first you must re apply crack files.the same thing is with kerpesky and any other firewall software that uses the same system as zone alarm, this toolbar also stopped sptd working on deamon tools until deamon tools intruduced the dtsoft virual drive to its software."
,bidi-bidi-bidi,2011-09-25T18:19Z,"@sadfate2wander: no, too many people have the same issue.

This release works fine on my xp partition but crashes at launch on my 7 partition, and nothing will fix it.

People are reporting the same issue on the official forum, so even if we cannot be sure it is with the official game it may be an issue with the original game itself (and/or graphic card driver. Catalyst 11.8 is reported to make similar crash at launch on F1 2010).

One sure thing, it is not related to the launcher included in this release, because it crashes the same if you keep original files of this release and try to launch it using the gcw mini image.

Those having the crash at launch may have to wait for an official patch, and/or another crk, and/or new ati driver (11.9RC doesn't solve the issue btw). Until that the best chance is to use it under winXP."

Tips:

Restart after you finish the download
Turn off the UAC feature in windows 7 (I don't use the UAC feature)
Disconnect from the net
Turn off Windows Defender(I don't use this)
Disable your AV
Block the game with your firewall after you got it to work

Works great on my system 43FPS(high and ultra settings AAx4)

I have windows 7 64 bit and had the same problem as lots and lots of other people. I click on razor launcher, hit esc then nothing happened.  I have now got the game to work.

Ok all I did was go into the redist folder found in this download. Basically i just clicked on anything that says application or windows installer. First i tried gfwlivesetup but that didn't work, then xlive redist but still no joy. The last one i tried was dotnetfx40_client_x86_x64. Now I aint got a fucking clue what this does but it ran for a while, repaired something or another and now the game launches fine!!

all other games i have on my pc like deus ex human revolution etc still run perfectly so i haven't broke anything. Sorry i can't be more technical but i know there are a lot of frustrated people out there who can't get this to work. As I said just go in the redist file and try running everything that is an application and keep your fingers crossed.

,MinaJunior,2011-09-28T21:48Z,"This fix WORKS and KEEPS your saved data.

Tested be me and another user.

If you can't load the game because it crashes when loading your saved games, then just do this:

Go to your savedgames folder, usually under C:\Users\Your_User\My Documents\My Saved Games\FormulaOne2011\saveddata\ .

Delete the file named GTEHXOSJZ_0.

Then, copy GTEHXOSJZ_1 in the same folder, to a file named GTEHXOSJZ_0.

You'll have again the two files GTEHXOSJZ_0 and GTEHXOSJZ_1.

Just run the game, and loading saveddata should be ok now 

If it doesn't work, try reversing the files (deleting 1 and renaming 0 to 1).

The only thing I lost doing this was my keyboard configuration.

Hope it helps.

It sounds like your profile is corrupt and THERE IS A FIX 

For anyone who has this issue(Crash on start up), please try the following:

If you still have your original Profile data while game is still crashing: 

Look in ""My Documents\My games\FormulaOne2011\savegame\Autosave_0077556GHS4 4"" or similar(Folder names might vary because of different system setups)

Backup your Autosave_etc. Folder

There are 2 files there, GTEHXOSJZ_0 and GTEHXOSJZ_1. Delete file named GTEHXOSJZ_0.

Make a copy of GTEHXOSJZ_1 in the same folder and rename it to GTEHXOSJZ_0.

You'll have again the two files GTEHXOSJZ_0 and GTEHXOSJZ_1.

Just run the game, and loading savedata should be ok now 

If it doesn't work, try reversing the files.

The only thing you may lose is your custom keyboard/controller configuration.

I Hope this helps you people.

If nothing happens, it is a problem with GFWL, in my case was Windows Live Sign-In assistant service which had stopped. Run services.msc and check if this service is active or not, if not try to start it, then if you come across error 1053 reinstall Windows Live Sign-In Assistant and the game should work just fine.

Note: This solution worked for me, I have NO guarantee it will work for anyone else, I noticed this case for me when my legit copy of Fable III wouldn't start and my Windows Live Messenger wouldn't log, all because of the Sign-In Assistant, kind of luck I had even come across the cause of the problem at all."

It sounds like your profile is corrupt and THERE IS A FIX

For anyone who has this issue(Crash on start up), please try the following:

If you still have your original Profile data while game is still crashing:

Look in ""My Documents\My games\FormulaOne2011\savegame\Autosave_0077556GHS4 4"" or similar(Folder names might vary because of different system setups)

Backup your Autosave_etc. Folder

There are 2 files there, GTEHXOSJZ_0 and GTEHXOSJZ_1. Delete file named GTEHXOSJZ_0.

Make a copy of GTEHXOSJZ_1 in the same folder and rename it to GTEHXOSJZ_0.

You'll have again the two files GTEHXOSJZ_0 and GTEHXOSJZ_1.

Just run the game, and loading savedata should be ok now

If it doesn't work, try reversing the files.

The only thing you may lose is your custom keyboard/controller configuration.

I Hope this helps you people.

Greetings from Colombia.
