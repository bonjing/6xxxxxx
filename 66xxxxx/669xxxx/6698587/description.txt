This is an all new album created by Dehartuz (Tushar). I have dedicated this album to Christ and so I am freely distributing it on the internet and to the other sources if I find them. I hope the listeners will ignore my voice to be flawed because I have given my passion into this song album. I started creating it in 2004 and now I have created this bunch of some musical tracks on my own.

All the songs are unique. Please find my keyword \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Dehartuz\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" on the internet. Distribute this album whereever you like. Send me comments, suggestions, questions, and all messages to my email: aroratushar@gmail.com or tushu_aror@yahoo.com.

I have created all these songs in the timespan of multiple years, therefore difference as aging and perfection between my vocals and melodies can be noticed. These songs are my personal copyright and therefore others are required to obtain my genuine permission to reproduce these songs.
