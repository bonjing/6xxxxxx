[T],dynstab2,2011-12-01T00:43Z,"Confused over the 4 uploads available for this Hibbeler text? This one is the 4th entry in the index so represents a (third) duplicate. I do not duplicate an indexed upload unless there is a significant advantage for the user. What you get with this upload is 1) a saving of more than 40 MB in download and 2) significantly better quality, text and figures (quasi-native PDF)."
