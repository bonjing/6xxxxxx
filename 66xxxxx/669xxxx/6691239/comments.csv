,brizownthepi,2011-09-21T19:22Z,Vuze seems to upload super slow - thanks for your patience!
,brizownthepi,2011-09-22T20:25Z,"Please seed this as long as possible - I have a monthly data transfer limit & after a while, I do have to stop my torrents from seeding or my monthly bill is too large.  Thanks everyone!!

I will seed some of the Road Trip series over the weekend - if I have them in FLAC, I'll upload 2 seperate versions..."
