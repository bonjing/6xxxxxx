,aaronbewza,2011-09-22T19:40Z,"Command-line users:
This build works with command line, but if you are seeing the GUI and don't want to, it can be disabled.
To disable the GUI, add "" -verbose"" or "" -v"" (minus the quotes, note the space) to the command.
Normally this would display diagnostic information, but it also disables the GUI.

example:

mame bublbobl -v

...would run Bubble Bobble with no GUI.

To create a .INI file to manually configure MAME options, add "" -createconfig"" or "" -cc"" to the target box in a shortcut to the MAME exe, and run it. The .INI will be created in the same directory."
,MasterFasterVDOWN,2011-09-23T18:08Z,"For command line build:

download the source from the release topic: http://www.retroroms.net/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=6204&forum=3

and remove the OSD=winui from the compile32.bat (or compile64.bat) and then recompile the source using the official dev tools from mamedev.org"
