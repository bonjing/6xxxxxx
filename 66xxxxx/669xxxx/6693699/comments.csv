,TiGORiN,2011-09-22T15:11Z,Can anyone confirm that this work?
[V],.Dude.,2011-09-22T15:56Z,Has anybody completed the download?
,rhinowar,2011-09-22T16:10Z,"Very disappointing dude.   Just as crowuk stated it doesn't work.
 no nfo or instructions or anything"
,Dutchlike,2011-09-22T16:13Z,Why put Cracked up there when it so clearly isn't?
,paketep,2011-09-22T16:18Z,"@crowuk No, it doesn't. Block the maniaplanet addresses in your firewall or disable your network, launch the game, choose the online profile, and when it can't connect tell it to stay offline. Single and multi offline work perfectly."
[V],.Dude.,2011-09-22T16:19Z,checking comments..
,paketep,2011-09-22T16:21Z,"@rhinowar, @Dutchlike: it works if you launch it like I said. Not the best ""crack"" in the world (an activated profile, really), but it's better than nothing."
[V],.Dude.,2011-09-22T16:27Z,"Can anybody out ther upload just the offline profyl.

,WarCoke,2011-09-22T16:44Z,thanks dude i owe ur torrents
,rhinowar,2011-09-22T16:58Z,yup same as crowuk for me.  I don't know how u got it to work paketep.  I think that this title isn't worth it anyways.
,paketep,2011-09-22T17:06Z,"@crowuk: same thing happened to me the first time, I think it's because I selected ""stay offline"" before trying to get online with the correct profile. Perhaps selecting ""multiple profiles"" in the launcher will allow you to choose profile again. In any case, since I had tried another version, I uninstalled, reinstalled, and it worked. Yeah, sad, and here's hoping we get a better crack, but I've tried this ISO in two computers and both run it OK."
,xarrro,2011-09-22T17:14Z,"YES IT WORKS,as all recent releases.
You have to do this:

1-Unrar
2-Mount
3-Turn off internet (take off cable or shut wireless)
4-Install
5-Open game and DONT create new profile
6-Use existing russian profile
7-Only can play in local
If you ever run the game with internet ON then you are not able to play it again.Need new instalment.
Follow this steps and everything runs well.
Cheers."

just like the adobe stuf?"
,bobdihi,2011-09-22T20:04Z,For crying out loud just post the bloody profile without the game. Lots of people got the game already. No use of downloading it again.

,TiGORiN,2011-09-22T21:26Z,"Yea, it sure works if you block the internet, but I don't think the game worth it... in my opinion."
[V],.Dude.,2011-09-23T03:25Z,"Listen guyz,no need to complain!
Atleast something is better thn nothing..

For those who cannot get it to works,follow these steps:
1.remove ny previous installatio using a good uninstaller.
2.reinstall the game.
3.run the game.(if u r using windows 7,ur firewall automatically asks whether u want to allow it to connect or not,so just cancel it)
4.in configure-- select single profile.
5.press on advanced-- go to networks tab..uncheck (check internet connection)
6.play the game.
SOLO and Multi would not work..they require an internet connection.

You can only play Local-- campaigns."
[V],.Dude.,2011-09-23T05:02Z,"and yup,disconnect from the internet everytym b4 you start the game."
,rodzandz,2011-09-23T07:57Z,"Thanks Dude!
Once again a rock solid release!
Great stuff as always!
Cheers m8!"
,Rulerofwax,2011-09-23T08:43Z,"It does not work for me. I installed this, and (using Windows 7) when the network options came up, I unchecked both. In game, I tried to use the existing profile, but it has to connect once to be able to update and all that - so it didn't work for me. I tried enabling it firewall access to see if it could connect even if I said play offline. It still didn't work. I might try to reinstall it tomorrow, and see if that does anything."

[V],.Dude.,2011-09-23T12:25Z,"Ok guyz,disregard all my previous comments.

,xarrro,2011-09-23T15:51Z,"Why tha hell humans have brain? We all were much happier without a brain.
Simple as disconect any internet (cable or wireless) install and play using existing russian profile .
Simple as that.No need anything else."
,WarCoke,2011-09-23T17:06Z,"Hey dude can you try to make the simpliest Crack ever, that is only extract (or install) and play SP and multiplayer. please i like this game, i disliked other TMs but this one is that where is something ... magical"

,smurfmurfet,2011-09-24T09:34Z,"I didn't disconnect and it works fine. When Maniaplanet asked to connect to my internet, via AVG, i said Block instead. And It works fine. 

The game works fine, no problems. But i would like access to the solo campaign instead of fan made tracks."

The guy's German is pretty bad, but I tried translating it:

""I'm not sure if all of these steps are necessary, but it works for me.

Software:
NEXT-Soft Hex-Editor MX
Cheat Engine 6.1
Trackmania 2 Canyon Offline Profile (Copy it somewhere else for editing)

1. Open ultra.profil.Gbx with the hex editor.
2. There are 2 entries with of the name. In this case at the first profile, which comes with the installation; ""trackmaniaca"". Edit the first entry somewhat (I only changed one character) and save the file. Copy it into the profile folder (\TrackManiaInstall\1\Config)
3. Start TM2 and log in, then alt+tab to Windows.
4. Open the hex editor and edit the second entry just like the first one. Save and copy into the profile folder again.
5. Start Cheat Engine, select the Trackmania process and return to the game. Click on Profile (bottom left) and return to the main menu.
6. Alt+tab again.
7. In Cheat Engine, select Value Type Text and enter the name of the profile: ""trackmaniaca"" and tick unicode. Now click on Search.
8. Take down all the entries and change them to the name you entered in the hex editor.
9. Untick unicode and search again.
10. Take all the entries again, edit them and return to the game.
11. Exit the game. The entered name should now appear once you restart the game and you can log in.

If you get an error message about the key when logging in, you did something wrong.""

Bare in mind, I haven't tried any of this so I don't really know what he's talking about. Hope it helps though."

pw mazdass"
,paketep,2011-10-10T01:09Z,"Ok, it works. The Hex Editor steps are not needed. Just:

1) Launch the game. Enter and exit profile.
2) Launch cheat engine. Look for instances of ""trackmaniaca"" in memory. Should be about 20 in unicode and 12 in standard encoding.
3) Change ALL of them to any other name. It's VERY IMPORTANT that the name must still be 12 characters, in small letters
4) Exit the game

That should be enough. The next time you launch the game, the name of the profile should be changed, and there will be no problem playing with other people using the same profile with changed names.

,jufr,2011-10-18T20:25Z,Guys leave Hamachi and come to Tunngle. Its the same as Hamachi but it has its own servers so you dont have to allways post your hamachi network and etc and that way everybody plays together in 1 trackmania 2 server!
,jufr,2011-10-18T20:27Z,"Here I leave the main steps of the tutorial:

1 - Download Tunngle
2 - Register on Tunngle website
3 - Install the program and log on: (this program will install a ""new network card"" that its the virtual network you need to play. Choose it as a home network with Internet access when windows ask about it)
4 - Within the program you will see a list of servers: go to Sports -> Trackmania 2 Canyon
5 - Already in the area of the chat, on the top right there is a button with a ""?"". Click on it and follow the tutorial to connect to the server and make some modifications in the game (like patching the profile ""trackmaniaca""). In order to play online you have to do this!
6 - After doing that tutorial enter the game with the internet on (if you blocked the game on the firewall or other program please disable that).
7 - Now go to Local Play -> Local Network and you should have some servers there (maybe only a couple but you can create you're own if you want). When i played there was 2 servers with 8 players in 1 of them.
8 - Join and have fun!
