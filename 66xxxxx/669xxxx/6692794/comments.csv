,TeamSwampThing,2011-09-22T15:40Z,"@Muserchair

gunninghawk put up the same torrent while i was creating this one, so i never even saw it. i hate putting up duplicates up of the same thing, splintering torrents like this is what causes torrents to die quickly. but like i said i tried to get rid of it, but no cigar. now we're stuck with it"
,MuserClair,2011-09-22T17:57Z,"cheers for the reply - i'm usually pretty good at spotting dupes, and always prefer to dl the first ul for the very reason you gave.  didn't spot GH's ul myself either, actually :-)

Cheers anyways, and thanks for the ul ;-D"
