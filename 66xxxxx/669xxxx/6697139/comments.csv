,pyro126,2011-11-16T01:25Z,Does TLA (as opposed to LOL) mean something? The rest of the episodes of the season from EZTV are all LOL and this one has really bad sound. I'm not trying to sound all pissy or whatever (I love what a good job EZTV does) I just want to know if I should be looking out for TLA if the sound has something to do with that. Keep up the good work EZTV and thanx.
