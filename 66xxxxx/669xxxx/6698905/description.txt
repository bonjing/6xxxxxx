One of my most favourite love songs has always been "Have I told you lately"
and Rod Stewart does it best on the jukebox in my home town

The track is included as a bonus on this 320k mp3 CD of his, called
"Greatest ballads" - it includes many of his vintage numbers
from the 70s - however if its how he feels about them he can certainly
get off on his version of what constitutes a Ballad for his
own repertoire per se.

Then again there's Ms. Barbara Mandrell's If loving you is wrong I don't
wanna be right - Here is Rod Stewart's delivery of it too!

Enjoy - those that are his fans from the 70s
