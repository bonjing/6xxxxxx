,kwyjiboo,2011-09-23T02:58Z,"@jseplin why do you say ""virus"" and ""fake""? I've been downloading from sceneline for months and NEVER had a problem. Just because you're too lazy to unrar doesn't mean you can bitch around with false claims. Just so you know, the release groups release their stuff rared..."
,ColdyBT,2011-09-28T19:26Z,"Good stuff. 
I mean it's HD for free like when it's released to blu ray i mean then you would have them already.
I never complain if it's free and plus we don't have a lot of those programs if any (up to date) over here."
,ProtoX4,2011-10-06T08:57Z,"Wrong, sceneline always releases first, then someone else comes and unrars it and re-releases unrar'd."
