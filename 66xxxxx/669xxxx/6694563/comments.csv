Note that this will only work on USB loaders that can boot different .DOL files. Step by Step (I use Usb Loader GX):

1.Go to ULGX and load MEtroid Prime Trilogy

2. When promted click Defualt.

3. Make a SAve account.

4. Restart your wii and load ULGX.

5. Instead of clicking Default, click the metroid game you want to play.

6. Enjoy! Note that this will save to the account you made in step 1. "

disputing the morality of torrenting this game when you are here yourself? or did you come to abrogate our efforts with your senseless jargon? either way it's pathetic "
,NeonYouki,2011-09-25T03:14Z,"OK, so 22 people have this torrent and I'm the only one seeding it?  Please start seeding the torrent.  Even if you only seed for a day, it still helps.  I will only be seeding for 5 more days and then its on and off seeding, so please start seeding this.  It makes my connection boggy when I'm uploading at over 330K on average."
,NeonYouki,2011-09-28T06:08Z,"@NiggerKnives - You do realize that not everyone has money to blow on expensive gaming systems and games to help make the rich people richer, right?  Also, there are many people who make free games as well.  So, it isn't the cost to make them.  Its just that you have to know who to look to for the money,  I for one would be fine playing free games that have an ad when you first play it and then smaller ads in game like models of coke bottles and such.  They don't need to charge the gamers and we don't need to pay them."
