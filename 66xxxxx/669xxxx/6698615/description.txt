BLOSSOM DEARIE GIVE HIM THE THE OOH LA LA 
Audio CD June 23, 1998 
Original Release Date: 1957 
Label: Polygram Records
Format: Flac

Blossom Dearie is rightly considered one of our premier cabaret artists. But Ms. Dearie began her career as a bona fide jazz pianist and singer. She first was heard in 1951 as the female answer voice on King Pleasure's be-bop vocalise "Moody's Mood For Love" and, beginning in 1957, recorded a series of LPs for Verve, of which OOH-LA-LA was the second. Then as now, what impresses most about Blossom Dearie is her fresh sound--light but not delicate, funny, swinging and lyrical when called for.

What might be come off in a lesser talent as a cute schoolteacher routine--Miss Crabtree painting the town a shade of red--is offset by honest musicianship and a real schoolteacher's attention to the English language as spoken. Dearie is one of the greatest lyric interpreters the music world has ever known. Every performance here is a little gem; the Cole Porter title tune receives its definitive performance, sexy as hell, and unknown Dearie treats like "They Say It's Spring" and "Try Your Wings" are just plain sweet and lovely.
