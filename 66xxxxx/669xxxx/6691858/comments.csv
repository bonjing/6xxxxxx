,Zeiken,2011-09-22T03:37Z,"The patched version works fine on custom all custom firmwares even if you convert the cso to iso. I tested it on psp go 6.20 PRO B9 BETA and PSP 2000 PRO B-9,  6.60ME-1.4 and 6.39 PRO B9 BETA.

However the non patched version doesn't work on any of the previous I've tested. I've tried using all the above, re un packing the rar and copying but it just doesn't work at all. 

And the patched one freezes at the first video at the end. You can press X to continue but what if that happens in the other videos? Then the game will be screwed. Patched versions of games are just unreliable like Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep Patched - It was a disaster. 

Something's wrong with the non patched version. It doesn't matter how high your CFW is it won't work at all."
,Zeiken,2011-09-22T04:26Z,"I tested further and the game crashes after you look for saeko. Theres a small scene and after The blond girl asked to go join you the screen turns blue and the game crashes. I've tested the crash in iso and cso format there's no way around it. This game needs some work before it's playable. 

Thanks for the upload though!"
,rayronald,2011-09-22T10:59Z,It crashes after the scene with the blond girl. At the very first minutes of the game. 
,NitrogenUA,2011-09-22T15:58Z,"thanks for reporting back. man, i felt it needed more testing, not enough time sadly. i wonder if i should delete this or leave it for testing purposes, but as of now THIS ONE DOES NOT WORK!"
,OfChaos,2011-09-22T23:00Z,"Oh great. :(

I downloaded this torrent and seeded for *8* hours, only to find it didn't even work. >.<

This sucks. (Using 6.20 ProB9 with Perm patch)

I hope you can upload a fixed game AND a patch for those who downloaded this torrent."
,OfChaos,2011-09-22T23:02Z,"Just to clarify, it crashes after Lisa begins to take you to the prison."
,OfChaos,2011-09-22T23:14Z,"You really should take down this torrent, a LOT of people are downloading it..."
,NitrogenUA,2011-09-23T00:15Z,"I would love to, but actually it refuses to delete. I guess all we can do is to abandon this torrent until solution is found."
,Zeiken,2011-09-23T00:39Z,"There's a working version of this game on demonoid. It's called Persona 2 PSP Untouched.

I tested the demonoid version on 6.20 PRO-B9 Beta on my PSP GO. Everything works. No crash in the opening and talking to Saeko in the Bike racks sence where you leave with Lisa works I did the battles and everything is flawless! You should upload that version here and take this one down fast!"
