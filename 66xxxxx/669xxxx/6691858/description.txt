Persona 2 - Innocent Sin

Language: English
Region: US

Tested on PSP-1000(5.50 GEN + Prometheus 4) & PSP-2000 (6.20 TN-E) + Prometheus Iso Loader v1.

Instructions:

Extract game from appropriate archive to ISO directory on your Memory Stick. This can be done using WinRAR, 7-Zip or Total Commander.

If using custom firmware of version 6.39 or higher feel free to use P2IS.rar.

In order to play the game on older custom firmwares you should use P2IS patched.rar. Patched version of the game is compressed to cso. It refused to work out of cso for me, so uncompressing is not recommended.

And remember these files are for the custom firmwares ONLY!

Enjoy & Have fun! :)
