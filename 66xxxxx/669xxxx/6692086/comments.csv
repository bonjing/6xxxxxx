Thanks in advance"
[T],Nicodemus75,2011-09-22T19:36Z,"I think it was actually freedomczar that said he was going to post Laura Ingraham podcasts.  He used to post them, but stopped.  It would also be nice if someone posted Sean Hannity podcasts on a daily basis.  Hannity is actually #2 rated radio show, with Rush at #1 and Glenn at #3"
