You have nothing to share but bleating at all levels? Whats your problem? Take it or leave it. Thats your choise

description (for legasthenikers only)
DaisyDisk allows you to visualize your disk usage and free up disk space by quickly finding and deleting big unused files.

The program scans your disk and displays its content as a sector diagram where the biggest files and folders at once become obvious. To drill down to a folder, just click on a segment. To bubble up, click in the center. Move the mouse over the diagram and see the name and path of each file, and enclosed files (if any). Hit Space to quickly preview file content, without launching another application. In this way, walk around your disk and drag-and-drop all unneeded files into the ""collector"". Expand the collector to check its contents. When done, clean it up with a single click.

Thanks uploader"
,ClassZero,2011-09-26T23:42Z,"nobody2007 why defend lazy buggers that cannot be bothered to post the version and a description? Downloaders should be given some info to make a decision if it is a dupe or worth the time.

I look at this kind of shite and leave it."
,WinterGale,2011-09-29T04:25Z,"I think the uploader's description pretty much says it all: Daisy Disk app and code generator.

That this is the Daisy Disk app with a code generator...duh...

If you're looking for the app description use the Mac App Store.

BTW, thanks for the great upload!"
[V],joshua13,2011-10-02T21:32Z,"""use the mac app store or ""google it"" are poor excuses for laisy posting. The poster should put something brief at least so we don't all have to spend extra time. He can always just copy and paste from the publisher site, etc."
,Rizzo220,2011-10-18T02:48Z,"Marrten is right. I can't believe OS Lion doesn't have something like this as a disk utility. 
Cheers mate!"
,telobyte,2011-12-12T18:46Z,Daisy Disk v2.1 with working crack. Thanks.
