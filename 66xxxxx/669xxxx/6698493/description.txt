  Lelung Rinpoche is one of Tibetan Buddhism's three principal          
  reincarnations, a 40- year-old lama on a mission to recover the       
  scattered teachings of his predecessors. In Dharamsala, he's          
  honoured as a holy man, yet in recent years Lelung has spent more     
  time in Ruislip, as a garden shed-dwelling guest of the Duek         
  family. Cameras follow Lelung on a trip to India, Mongolia and        
  China, and it's a life that seems less contradictory than you might   
  imagine, perhaps because its principal has a kind of steely modesty   
  that makes him at home everywhere he travels.
