 You would think St. Louis and not Helsinki would be the backyard of The Latebirds, but alas they seem to nail a gorgeous, deliberate Americana style on the opening title track of Last Of The Good Ol' Days could be mistaken for a Jeff Tweedy solo track and not a seasoned Finnish-cana outfit. The bombast at the close might not be to everyoneâ€™s liking, but it seems to gel nicely. Meanwhile the sweet roots pop of â€œAmong The Survivorsâ€ shines with its tight rhythm section and barroom keyboards.

 With guest appearances by Wilcoâ€™s Nels Cline, Minnie Driver and Tom Petty and The Heartbreakersâ€™ Benmont Tench and Dave Rawlings among others, The Latebirds have a very credible batch of songs from start to finish. Although a few songs such as â€œTime To Liveâ€ and â€œNo1â€ sound just a bit too polished, resulting in a loss of that spark, the group soars on the Dylan-ish â€œSummer Becomes Fallâ€ if backed by Tench and company. And the gentle â€œLike Father Like Sonâ€ oozes folksy campfire fodder.

 If thereâ€™s one true standout aside from â€œYou Cynical Youâ€ it has to be â€œFearless,â€ a haunting rocker revolving around Russian journalist Ana Politkovskaja who was murdered in 2006. The song hits its groove early and doesnâ€™t come off too preachy or soapbox-ish. Another keeper is the barnstorming â€œKickinâ€™ Meâ€ recalling an early, confident Tom Petty. 

 brief reprise of the opener is bizarrely found near the homestretch but a five-song â€œWoodstock Sessionsâ€ bonus EP (with Kris Kristofferson, Levon Helm and David Rawlings appearing here) more than atones for the miscue with delicate covers of â€œThe City Of New Orleansâ€ and Townes Van Zandtâ€™s â€œTo Live Is To Fly.â€
