-----------------------------

"Real Love" is a song written by the English rock musician John Lennon. Lennon made six takes of the song in 1979 and 1980 with "Real Life", a different song that merged with "Real Love". The song was ignored until 1988 when the sixth take was used on the documentary soundtrack Imagine: John Lennon.
"Real Love" was subsequently reworked by the three remaining members of The Beatles (Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr) in early 1995, an approach also used for another incomplete Lennon track, "Free as a Bird". "Real Love" was released as a Beatles single in 1996 in the United Kingdom, United States and many other countries; it was the opening track on the Beatles' Anthology 2 album.
It is the last "new" credited Beatles song to originate and be included on an album. To date, it is the last single by the group to become a Top 40 hit in the US.
