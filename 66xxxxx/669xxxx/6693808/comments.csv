,RafVne2,2011-11-27T06:05Z,"@azxo
So did I...he he he... I've been using a free AVG for a while now, but after I read your post I tried that too, and ... voila.... i entered the key and it asked me to dowload additional software.... shit... well for as long as those keys last, i'm fine with it :).

and @Naruto
Hey thanks for posting those keys... you should post some more if you got'em so same keys won't be used over and over. Well I guess it doesn't matter, they'll block them eventually"
,RafVne2,2011-11-27T06:51Z,"ueah but firewall is so shitty... doesn't tell you anything... it's just ""blocked"",""blocked"" Why? no way of finding out..."

,Imok86,2011-12-05T15:13Z,"Works just fine. Everything i did was:
1. deactivated my internet connection
2. installet with the first key
3. restartet PC, reactivated internet connection and updated AVG
The Only problem i got is that i installed the 64 bit version but it installed in the ""program files (x86)"" anyway... don't know why"
