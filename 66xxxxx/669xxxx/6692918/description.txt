"Reign of Doomsday" is a 2011 comic book crossover storyline published by DC Comics that will run through the Superman family of books. The crossover involves Doomsday hunting down Steel, Superboy, Eradicator and Cyborg Superman, the four main characters introduced in the wake of the controversial The Death of Superman storyline in 1992.[1] Though the current iteration of the character was not present in the original The Death of Superman storyline, Supergirl will appear in the crossover as well due to being part of the Justice League.[2] The storyline itself draws its title from Reign of the Supermen, the immediate follow-up to The Death of Superman.
