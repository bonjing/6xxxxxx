                The Sleeper Under the Hill.
                When a farmer is found horribly murdered in the
                middle of a stone circle, suspicion points at a group
                of druids. DCI John Barnaby and DS Jones hurry to the
                scene of the crime, where they are joined by new
                pathologist Kate Wilding on her first assignment.
                Druid high priest Leticia Clifford shows Barnaby that
                sacred ley lines run through the stone circle and
                later is convinced she has made an exciting
                discovery. But before she can share her theory, she
                is stabbed to death. When a third body is found,
                Barnaby starts to believe that basic human greed -
                rather than spiritualism - is the real motive for
                murder.
