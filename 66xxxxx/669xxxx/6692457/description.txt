This will only work on an iPhone 3g, to check go to settings&gt;general&gt;about and make sure the model # starts with MB

the first thing you need to do is plug the iphone and and make sure itunes doesnt open, then use ireb for iphone 3g and keep the iphone in dfu mode. then open itunes hold shift and click on restore then browse to the Jailbreak 3g file included and double click. to unlock go on cydia and let it update and click complete upgrade, reboot then go back on cydia&gt;manage&gt;sources&gt;repo666&gt;ultrasnow&gt;install

Because this hactivates the phone you will need to install push fix for youtube to work and push notifications, on cydia homepage find more package sources and add the iphoneModding repo and install push fix. 

this is mainly to unlock/jailbreak an iPhone 3g without updating the baseband, if you need to unlock and your baseband is upgraded to much you need to use the secendary jailbreak folder, also if you dont care about saving your baseband, you can just use the redsn0w from the folder.

THIS WONT WORK ON MAC
