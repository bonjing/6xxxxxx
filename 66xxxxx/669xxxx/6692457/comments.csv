,skyserfer,2011-10-08T02:54Z,"Damn DVM

I usually don't right comments, but I had to thank you.
I tried so so so many jailbreaks, cuz mine would not get out of anything, this thing did it so easy and simple

Thanx again"
,isakdenende,2011-11-20T21:40Z,I switched cell phone carrier before using this jaikbreak and now I can't update Cydia with the app. Is there a way to update Cydia thru the computer?
,d.v.m.,2011-11-21T06:57Z,"@isakdenende there is a way but its far too complicated, just let cydia refresh and click complete upgrade"
,isakdenende,2011-11-21T18:35Z,"@d.v.m. Thanks for your reply mate. My problem is that when I refresh cydia it keeps saying ""Unable to load - The Internet connection appears to be offline"", even tho I have a wifi connection (but no service). Thus I can't complete the upgrade."
,d.v.m.,2011-11-22T01:12Z,@isakdenende then use the secondary jailbreak folder and follow the instructions for that jailbreak but choose install cydia
,d.v.m.,2011-11-22T01:20Z,"@isakdenende it also might be the country where you live, You might have to do some research and change the repositories to where you live."

,tommyhawkster,2011-12-16T08:39Z,"Like skyserfer, I'm not a big comment writer but I too had tried to jailbreak using nearly every method out there without success.  This worked flawlessly.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  "
,ghosty7,2012-03-17T05:07Z,"Apple iphone 3g 16gb
in the (general) screen from phone it reads: 
Version: 4.2.1 (8C148)
Carrier: AT&T 9.0
Model: MB499LL
Modem Firmware: 05.15.04 

I got a sim card from At&T for free - result: (No Service) on phone.

I want to use it as a AT&T gophone - Is that possible?

It has Wi-Fi that works great. 

I have a Mac Pro. Help me tap this iphone.
Thank you salty dogs! (hard R here)
