,jackddrinker,2011-09-25T18:01Z,good rip. terrible film
,Aurasan,2011-09-26T00:14Z,"Hey Jap, are you even Japanese?
More than likely you're some fat dude sitting in a basement trolling.
If you really really are some pissed off Japanese dude, its a little thing called penis envy my friend. look it up.
Sorry about the quake and wave too. (seriously, my heart goes out to Japan on that one)
If you didn't wanna get nuked, you shouldn't have provoked it by bombing Pearl Harbor. Again with the killing of innocent women and children.
I shit, roll it in seaweed paper and rice, and serve it to you as sushi.
Ahh, brown roll! Itadakimasu!
Lastly, your facts are off. Not all Americans are fat. Obesity is not nearly as big of a problem as some claim it to be.
Also if you want to talk government, at least our president doesn't lie to us. Yours let women and cildren suffer radiation from the tokyo electric plants saying ""oh everything is fine""
I love Japan.

Quote ""...Also if you want to talk government, at least our president doesn't lie to us."" 

Lol, really he/they don't? 

We must be living in different worlds.  I have never heard of any leader, political or Royal that has not greatly deceived His/Her Nation at some point or another.

So I suppose 911 is all true??
How about the reasons for invading Afghanistan or Iraq...I suppose those weren't lies either?lol.

At least our Presidents don't lie to us...lol

...too funny.  stop kidding yourself the only difference is that in other parts of the world people don't have as much ""freedom of speech"" and liberties as we do in North America, so their political leaders don't have to be sneaky or deceptive like ours do.  The only difference is that our leaders are better at playing the political game and covering up their lies & deceptions. 
Instead of pointing out the downfalls of an oppressed people and Nations that aren't at par with North American standards, work to better the situation by first educating your self with the facts and then acting as a concerned human, an earthling as you are.  Don't forget Nations may split up people and put up borders to restrict the free movements of a people, but don't ever be mistaken that we on Earth are One people, separated. Nothing will ever change if we don't."
,Kadanz,2011-09-27T03:16Z,"anywayz....

How about we go back on-topic? how's the movie?"
,aradiel,2011-09-27T10:41Z,"This movie is just awful on every level. I didn't have a problem with the plot, just the execution. The acting was wooden, almost to the point of being intentionally bad. The choreography in the fight scenes was like two elementary school children going at each other. Very little was explained. Less made sense. They left this wide open for a sequel, but really, why bother?

That said, my interest in this genre kept me going to the end. It was watchable. It's just not very good. Game of Thrones this is not."
,aradiel,2011-09-27T10:43Z,"I realise I forgot to comment on the A/V. The sound was fine. The picture was mostly fine, but as mentioned, it became extremely pixelated at the end of the movie. Obviously most of you won't reach the end of the movie to notice."
,y3n007,2011-09-28T19:39Z,"Extremezone thank you for all your uploads but I think sometimes you just get bored and upload any crappy movie you can find, as this one is.....wish you could upload nothing but quality movies but then again every one has different likings so thank you for thinking about everyone......"
,cryskonig,2011-09-28T21:08Z,"@aurasan - Actually the US government placed an ILLEGAL trade embargo on Japan during that time leading up to Pearl Harbor. Also, the US government received radio transmissions from Australia letting them know about the bombing party heading toward Hawaii and did nothing. Prior to Pearl Harbor there was only around an 18% approval rating for the US to enter the war, afterwards it rode somewhere in the 80% range. If your friends sell guns and tanks and they want to make money isn't that a great way to ""create a market"" for them? Stop watching FOX News lol."
,cryskonig,2011-09-28T21:13Z,"Also, I agree with Frosty except on one small point. The only reason that we think we have freedoms is because we CAN say what we want. The problem is that nobody truly listens anymore. As long as we can watch American Idol we don't give a shit about the truth. So, our American freedoms are an illusion anyway.

,ashen77,2011-09-30T01:29Z,I live in the west and cant think of a better time or place to live in. We've got roofs over our heads and 0 starvation.... how can we complain so much?

,spckifuhgn,2011-09-30T21:26Z,must be seen to be believed
,LukeScooto,2011-10-01T02:11Z,"The guy saying 0 starvation is way off. You must live in the suburbs in a ritzy house, theres lots of starvation in this country, although its probably a result of lifestyle choices more then anything.
The guy saying our president doesnt lie to use...everything else you said was 100% correct except for that statement, which im sure you reread and figured you might have made an error there. 
The guy just going back to 911 and Iraq lies, buddy, your head is just as far up your ass as the other guys, do you think Obama is telling us the truth 100% all the time, and never ever lieing to us? Let me guess, because you love Obama so much and he's such a great president doing such a great job, when he lies to us its for our own good and its ok. Right? 
Ahhhh, how great it is to be 22 and still in a liberal college that only teaches Democratic talking points and nothing else. I miss those days. Not."
,Hex-bag,2011-10-01T08:13Z,thanks for the upload
,thefloorjacker,2011-10-01T20:03Z,"@Aurasan, All americans are all fat, fat and have no brain and also your president is a slave nigger, lol, hes an actor not a president. O! and all governments lie, your just to thick to realise that............ muppet."
,arontj,2011-10-02T06:54Z,"@thefloorjacker
Guess a ""slave nigger"" has gotten further in life than you.
but agree on the fact americans have a problem in obesity. Still not ALL of them are retard.
And second, saying that the population of an entire nation is stupid, is stupid you dumbass.
Anyways, this chat has gone off topic.
