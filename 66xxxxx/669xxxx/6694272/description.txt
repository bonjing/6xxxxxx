The Boys - Butcher, Baker, Candlestickmaker 03 (of 06)

Writer: Garth Ennis Penciller/Inker/Covers: Darick Robertson
The story of Billy Butcher, the Boys' mysterious leader, is told at last. 
From the backstreets of London's East End to the carnage of the Falklands 
War, from the heights of love to the depths of tragedy, the most violent 
man in comics reveals the terrible nature of the forces that drive him. 
And when he's done, he'll be ready... to finish things once and for all.
