so hope he reconsiders :-(

thanks loads for the ul, MrD :-)"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-22T18:35Z,"everything Ive read/heard - thats the end - which is why he released this mini. Its a good and bad thing, we want more but dont want it to start getting stupid - they had a clear goal in mind and accomplished that - but who knows maybe they make something else or spinoff or a second huge storyline - guess we'll see :D"

First off, you could be friendlier

Secondly, We do not scan comics. Minutemen/DCP, etc are scanners - they buy comics and scan them. They are the ones who do the work. We here just find them and upload them. We cannot upload something that doesnt exist. Im still searching for comics taht have come out MONTHS ago, bc No one has scanned them. When something is released has no say on when it is scanned, and therefore when we can upload it.

Its just a comic -calm down. If you need it that badly - hit the comic shop and buy one -and while ur at it, scan it for everyone else."

,MuserClair,2011-09-23T11:09Z,"yeah, you're right MrD - ennis is a fantastic writer and gets the balance right between writing a great ongoing story, and not eeking it out so it becomes ridiculous.  That said, i'm gonna miss the boys massively when it ends - it's been a regular part of my life since it started, and i can only hope he does a few specials, if not a vol 2!

oh, and MOURGOLYKOS, the guys who ul do an amazing job, and will consider reasonable, polite requests for scans - you need to think about the polite and reasonable part of that.  if the scan is there, they will ul it for you, however, if i was one of the guys whose torrents you've been bombarding with borderline rude comments demanding an ul, i don't think i'd have been as polite as MrD.  you got a problem with waiting, buy the comic.
THEY'RE doing YOU the favour - don't forget that."
