[T],stevekasian,2011-10-08T07:39Z,"Hifi can log all the IP addresses they want to log. There is absolutely no legal precedent for, nor is there any legal remedy in, prosecuting a leaser of an IP address for ""unauthorized use of software"" based on tcp/ip requests arriving at the plaintiff's servers, having allegedly originated from said leaser's IP address.

NOT GONNA HAPPEN. It is a fairly comical threat on the part of Hifi though.

That being said, since they've FINALLY gotten rid of that idiot boundary spanner Jim Skorna - you know, the jackoff who would always address any support requests regarding actual bugs in the software by talking those customers in circles until they just got fed up and went away (kinda like politicians do) - I just MAY come back as a paying customer of ASE. Speaking directly to one of the developers about fundamental problems with the functionality of the software has always been the biggest challenge in getting to the bottom of the numerous problems with ASE. Now that SP3 has effectively fixed some of the deal-breakers in that regard, and now that Damian Clark is personally fielding support requests, I believe it's time to reconsider my boycott of Hifisim."
,thesaguaro1,2011-10-11T23:01Z,"For a good laugh, here is their ""announcement"":
Announcement - 09/29/2011
Illegal Active Sky Pirates to be prosecuted! Unfortunately over the past 6 months pirate access has significantly damaged our server resources and ability for us to provide proper services to legitimate customers. We have logged thousands of illegal active user IP addresses and will begin prosecuting against them seeking criminal charges and damages starting next week. We anticipate this will create a great relief in our servers and provide much better service for legitimate customers. If you are a current illegal user, this is your final warning. Become a legitimate customer or stop using the software immediately. Those who convert to legitimate customers will not be prosecuted. All illegal access on or after 10/5/2011 will be strongly prosecuted in accordance to local and international laws."
,uberwagn,2011-10-12T04:43Z,"How are you sure, steve? "
,irikimoss,2011-10-25T23:31Z,"really really dunno why, but since i started using ASE with the release of SP3, my FSX is crashing 50% of the times.

I've made a lot of tests, and all comes down to ASE SP3. DAMN :S

and NO, im not from HiFi :E"
,escobarseason,2012-01-18T18:58Z,"Can anybody confirm this is working in 2012?
or is there another decend (working) weather engine for fsx?"
