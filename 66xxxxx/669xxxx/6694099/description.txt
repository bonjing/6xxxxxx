The changes include improved location change detection, improved precipitation interpolation, a new ATC wind lock feature, and fixed winds aloft interpolation logic that would occasionally result in improper wind directions.

 
Active Sky Evolution is the latest effort in high-fidelity weather simulation with a focus on realism.  Advanced flight and weather planning, comprehensive mapping, an in-flight weather radar gauge, private wx data network access, advanced air effects and universal graphics add-on compatibility are just some of the innovate features that set Active Sky apart from the rest

Have fun chaps :+)
