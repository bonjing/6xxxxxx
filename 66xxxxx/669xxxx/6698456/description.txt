Hey guys! Autumn is my favorite time of year and Halloween is without a doubt my favorite holiday so I put together a little compilation of creepy ghost stories that I have archived to share with all of you. Some of these (Gayle house records and Alfred Hitchcock) are for small children but the rest are just great ghost stories that are awesome to listen to while the lights are low. The Gayle House Records file was one that I found a couple of years ago but when I was a child we actually ordered the "45" record from the back of a comic book. You remember the black and white adds don't you? This one in particular may bring back some wonderful memories of your youth so one of these rainy October nights, turn down the lights,turn up the ghost stories and enjoy!
