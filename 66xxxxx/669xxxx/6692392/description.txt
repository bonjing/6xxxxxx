I couldn't find any good Oingo Boingo on here so here it what I have.


This is 3 full albums; Anthology, Good for your soul, Boi-ngo, and some rare songs including the amazing yodeling skills of Danny Elfman.

I am always looking for more Oingo so hit me up if you have any that you want me to add. I also have most of their stuff on vinyl that I am trying to get into here.
