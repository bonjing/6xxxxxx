Aluminum Structures, Second Edition demonstrates how strong, lightweight, corrosionâ€“resistant aluminum opens up a whole new world of design possibilities for engineering and architecture professionals. Keyed to the revised Specification for Aluminum Structures of the 2000 edition of the Aluminum Design Manual, it provides quick lookâ€“up tables for design calculations; examples of recently built aluminum structuresâ€“from buildings to bridges; and a comparison of aluminum to other structural materials, particularly steel. Topics covered include:

    * Structural properties of aluminum alloys
    * Aluminum structural design for beams, columns, and tension members
    * Extruding and other fabrication techniques
    * Welding and mechanical connections
    * Aluminum structural systems, including space frames, composite members, and plate structures
    * Inspection and testing
    * Load and resistance factor design
    * Recent developments in aluminum structures
