,Sciguy77,2011-09-23T17:51Z,"This isn't even scheduled to air until Oct 2nd, but I'll give it a try since Torrentzone is a VIP uploader.  There are still no seeders showing up -- will re-post once I have the 'avi complete and take a look . . . "

,aelfred,2011-09-26T11:13Z,"It is common for dexter to have it first episode ""leaked"" a week earlier google it and you will see only Season 5 did not have the first episode leaked."
,scottsasse,2011-09-26T23:11Z,Many THANKS torrentzone!! I'm so crazy over this series that I think I'm gonna go kill something:)
,Sicy,2011-09-27T16:38Z,The internetz is amaze balls. Thank you. 
,TheSageM,2011-09-27T19:47Z,Thanks a lot :-)
,Aeromance,2011-09-27T21:19Z,"I cannot believe this. 
How you got the season premiere of such a highly praised show in this quality, I will never know. 
But it is real, really real.
Obviously, you won't believe me and you would be smart to be skeptical of comments.
The only logic I can give you is what I used: with so many seeders (and leechers) and comments, how can none of them be negative if it was a fake?

It's real and it's amazing and I can't think of a way to thank the uploader enough. "
,TheHumanBot,2011-09-28T19:12Z,I would get it but i'm a frijolero (mexican)... i need subtitles for those parts where people talk too fast.
,belgeko,2011-09-29T06:12Z,Im downloading now will seed on full if this is real. Thank you who ever got this and how did i miss it 5 days ago
,belgeko,2011-09-29T07:16Z,Just finished watching THANK you looks to be an interesting season.
,Mdawg13,2011-09-30T08:14Z,Showtime intentionally leaked this episode. The 1st episode of last season was also leaked before it was aired as well as with Weeds & Californication. It was done to garner interest in the show & create internet buzz.
,BalisongBrad,2011-10-02T07:20Z,"I am SOOO Excited Right Now! Haven't Watched it Yet, but based on all the positive comments, I'm guessing that this is the real deal! It's times like this that I wish I had a faster internet connection... stupid hillbilly town and its 1.5mb max speed! RRR... 
But Back To The Topic At Hand... THANK YOU! Me and The Wifey Are Ecstatic! I probably just woke my neighbors up with excitement! "
,Jack0ff,2011-10-02T22:55Z,@Mdawg13 - you are a moron. this came from a promotional dvd showtime gives out to industry insiders.
,vipastyle,2011-10-03T07:10Z,Thank you so much! Let everyone enjoy the fun by keeping this file seeded for a while.
,Johnny24071982,2011-10-04T20:34Z,Guys be careful of this torrent. I got a Copyright Infringement email from the server from which I download. Just thought I'd let you guys know.
,siciliana21,2011-10-05T13:30Z,Cheers to the uploader! Dexter is back!! A/8 V/9
,mohiergauth,2011-10-06T01:00Z,"One of two things possible here:

1.) All of you who are like, ""Awesome, you rocks!"" and all that shit are really fucking stupid OR
2.) You are bots.

This is a PW protected fucking zip in a zip torrent. Advertisements, and fucking surveys to get the password. Fuck you guys."
