Libra - is the seventh astrological sign in the Zodiac, originating from the 
constellation of Libra. In astrology, Libra is considered a ""masculine"", positive 
(extrovert) sign. It is also considered an air sign and is one of four cardinal signs. 
Libra is ruled by the planet Venus (which also rules Taurus).

Individuals born when the Sun was in this sign are considered Libra individuals. Under the 
tropical zodiac, the Sun enters Libra on the moment of autumnal equinox by definition on 
September 23, leaving it on October 22...
