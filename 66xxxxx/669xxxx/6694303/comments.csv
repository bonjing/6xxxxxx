,lavandina,2011-09-23T11:01Z,is this real?
,Grunge91bd,2011-09-23T12:47Z,"I just downloaded this and listened to it. Idk if this torrent is bullshit, but if its legit then this remaster sucks. Its a lot louder but when you listen to the songs at high volumes it sounds distorted."
,lavandina,2011-09-23T14:47Z,"Downloaded too. The remaster definately sucks. And the so called extras are also stupid and cheap. The live concert has been available for years, and the alternate mixes are mostly the same song. So glad I didn't put any money in this scam. Thanks for the torrent, though."
,bodgg77,2011-09-23T16:27Z,"Yeah, all this stuff has been previously available on bootlegs for years
thanks for uploading though, getting it for nothing but i suppose the idea of this release is to have the packaging not the widely available music remastered or not

in utero was alot better in retrospect"
,weedfactory,2011-09-23T19:01Z,"this are the first leaked mp3's converted to flac, so NOT lossless"
,Grunge91bd,2011-09-23T19:40Z,Yea looks like im gonna have to wait a few more weeks until someone uploads a real lossless torrent of this ripped from the actual disc. Thanks anyways Vicerock for putting this up.
,yerisan710,2011-09-24T08:32Z,"yes is this real

days....!!!!"
,fimskiy,2011-09-25T00:41Z,transcode from mp3!!!
,weedfactory,2011-09-25T03:04Z,"AGAIN, STAY AWAY FROM THIS TORRENT

MP3 TO FLAC !"
,jimclip,2011-10-02T05:33Z,"Spectral view show this is not true lossless.....haircut up around 17-18k, transcoded from lossy format, probably MP3. BAD BAD BAD, why even bother uploading this???? What's the point of deceiving people when there's no money involved, huh? Freaking loser !!!! Guess I should've known given that this was uploaded several days before the actual release....for those who care, a proper EAC rip with logs etc (done by JWB no less) is posted at Demonoid :)"
