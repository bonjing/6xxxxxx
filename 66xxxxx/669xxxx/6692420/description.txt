Kokowaah is a German film directed by its leading actor Til Schweiger. It was released in German-speaking countries on 2011 February 3.
The film is a comedy. The plot concerns the travails of an established author of fiction who must deal with the emergence of his 8-year-old natural daughter (Emma Tiger Schweiger), the previously unknown product of a one-night indiscretion in Stockholm.
The title is the way a German who cannot speak French might attempt to say coq au vin (chicken in winesauce).
