,musicfromrizzo,2011-09-21T23:44Z,merci - the eclectic aspect endeavours to do justice to some of the somewhat fringe aspects of the appeal range that sums up the seventies - mainly I try to stay conservative or in any event only include what I have to that stretches this in any way. Sometimes its the only way to be able to keep everyone in that is within our target audience we try to serve here. danke!
