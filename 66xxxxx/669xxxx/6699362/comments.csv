,mendota,2011-10-01T04:50Z,"This one is edited. Tyson's ""Fuck""s were bleeped. But ""snatch"" and ""come on his face"" weren't.

Oh well..."
,sharpshot94549,2011-10-02T21:26Z,"Mentoda. I just watched Tyson's part again. Despite his speech problem, nothing he says gets bleeped. I do have to say that on the TV version he told Jeff Ross to ""Suck on a fuckin' exhaust"" but with his speech problem they bleeped suck and fuckin' because they both sounded the same. Also, snatch wasn't bleeped on the TV Version and it is cum, not come."
