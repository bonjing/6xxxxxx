@thunderbum. I tried one bottle of Diet regular flavour Two if by Tea a friend gave me. It was really good, but it's still pretty pricey with shipping charges added in."

Yes, and while it is very good, I have to agree with Out-Git about it being rather pricey.

But, as Rush says, he always wants the best, and he delivers with the tea.  It's just not that much better to justify the price (for me) at this time.

On the other I hand, I do agree with Rush about Macs!  :)  And, they are rather pricey, too.  So, I have a great computer, but I drink store brand soda!!

RESPECT WE MUCH

PS - I use that line because Rush used it on a caller one day soon after the Sharpton performance art!!!

I posted a TON more on (the now defunct) Mininova, and a bud from there posted them to Demonoid.

Does anybody here have interest in some?  I would be glad to help out the group and especially the great dudes keeping us ""Flush with Rush""!!!
