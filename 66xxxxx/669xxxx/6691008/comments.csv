,r00ted,2011-09-30T18:38Z,"Any confirmation if these maps are ready and compatible with a classic ""TomTom XL"" - it's the cheap-o GPS that I got last year for black friday....and have read of some problems with certain maps needing a ""nav core"" flash or soemthing....?"
,MarcosVS,2011-10-12T16:41Z,"Hi r00ted,
These maps are compatible with all devices tomtom.
See the compatibility table that is within the torrent.
Only with the new line of GPS Start is not working.
If your GPS is unlocked just need to run the program to activate the map."
