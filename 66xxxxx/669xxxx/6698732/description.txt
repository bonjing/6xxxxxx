INVASIO BARBARORVM 2: AFRICA VANDALORVM II

Simply follow the installation instructions.

The installer recognizes your installation directory of M2TW automatically.
If you get an installation directory with \"MyProduct\" in it, then your installation is not entered properly in the registry or you are running a 64bit system. In this case you will have to browse manually to your Medieval II Total War directory, NOT to your mods directory!
