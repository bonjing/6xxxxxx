 Tashi, Arun and Nitin - flat mates, buddies    
 and partners in crime. Tashi is to get         
 married in a month but still doesn't know      
 if his fiancee is THE ONE! Arun can't make     
 up his mind who he wants to kill first -       
 his girlfriend (who has just dumped him) or    
 his stupid, annoying boss (whose idea of       
 creativity is sketching a smiling banana).     
 And Nitin is about to discover that eating     
 delicious Tandoori Chicken off a street        
 vendor is going to give him the worst case     
 of Delhi Belly he's ever known! Three regular  
 blokes, living the regular life except for     
 one small detail - they are on the hit list    
 of one of the world's deadliest crime          
 syndicates. Will they be able to get away      
 before the shit hits the roof and it comes     
 crashing down? Delhi Belly is the meanest      
 comedy you're ever likely to see.
