,shdwolf1,2011-09-21T01:56Z,"so tell me, why are you posting all these almost useless pictures that no one is dl'g? Are you trying to get your skull, or just trying to mass spam the tpb site in hopes of forcing ppl away? I can tell you this, it's irritating as sh*t seeing dozens of posts on stupid sh*t from you. if you have to post, why not put all your dinky posts into one big torrent? I'm not saying you don't have valid pictures, but having to wade thru your crap just to find something I do want to dl is getting real old!"
,Glenn1963,2011-09-21T02:39Z,"Says the complainer who's never posted a single torrent.  

In a category with maybe 36 torrents posted in a single day, is it really all that difficult to ignore the ones you don't want?  All named ""Amazing...""?"
,shdwolf1,2011-09-21T09:35Z,"yo glen(also a non poster, I note), fuk off! This spammer has posted hundreds of torrents of every picture he can snatch from the internet, just hoping for his skull. I SHOULDN""T HAVE TO WADE THRU his obnoxious spam! 
Just ignore it, move along, don't rock the boat, is the same crap ppl like you said to blacks getting on a bus in '65, to jews told to display their star, and ignore what went on around them in '39, to villagers hudled in huts while their neighbors were hacked to death with machetes. 
What this guy is doing is straight out spam! Don't tell us ""it's not too bad, put up with it""'; it's still spam, and coming back once a week means hundreds of this spam to wade thru, not just 36..  "
,Chisinau_Moldova,2011-09-21T14:49Z,"I couldn't agree more,I've mentioned on a few of his uploads and asked him does he know what Amazing means?Because people wearing glasses is not amazing.

Like shdwolf1 says,why not put all your little torrents into one or two normal size?You have some 1-2 mb torrents,that's fucking retarded.

Like I said elsewhere,why not just ask if you can suck someone's cock for your skull?

Please fuck off with you NOT amazing torrents and stop spamming."
,Chisinau_Moldova,2011-09-21T14:51Z,"PS:I've uploaded tons of stuff in the past under a different name,the system went down and wouldn't let me in with my name so I had to start with new one,so I am not someone with no uploads."
