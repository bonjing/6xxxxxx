,paparies,2011-09-25T01:29Z,"Skulls generally mean that torrents from this user are PROBABLY legit/real/virus free. PROBABLY.

,eddiesadvocate,2011-09-25T21:06Z,"Why haven't any of these idiots, talked about the quality of the torrent?"
,gus_the_bus2000,2011-09-25T22:43Z,since no one will comment on quality i will. good for a cam but still a cam
,verocious,2011-09-26T05:30Z,Thank you gus_the_bus2000. Much appreciated. :)
,teemu92,2011-09-28T06:15Z,is this a cam version?

,Pingsterness,2011-09-29T22:47Z,5 days and no screens? Come on guys?
,TrustedQualityRatings,2011-09-29T22:58Z,"I WILL! rate this when it is finished downloading! Keep checking back. As always you can trust my ratings unlike some people on here which is why I created this account. 

I will rate as a cam and as a whole both out of 10 and also provide feedback and details about the quality. "
,TrustedQualityRatings,2011-09-30T02:01Z,"As a Cam - 7/10
In general quality - 5/10

Have not watch the movie to rate it as a film yet I skimmed through bit by bit and watched the first 5 minutes. 

It doesn't look all that different from the previous uploads except for the fact that its a little brighter but not much. It is the full movie. I would have rated it more but like I said it is dark. Thankfully, the film doesn't have much if any dark or night scenes though. However it is a little blurry, just a small glaze but at some parts it gets even more blurry. The sound is good for a cam as long as your not looking for Surround Sound or anything. This movie is watchable if your not picky, I'm sure there will be a better version out soon if you want to wait though. 

For the complainers about my ratings - I know it is only a cam and its free and believe me, I am thankful for the uploads, but some people want to know the quality before they download it and decide for themselves weather or not they want to wait or watch now. 

Hope I helped! :)"
,wugs05,2011-09-30T22:39Z,ty trustedqualityratings im new to this and it does help wish your name was shorter
,i_steal_media_hohoho,2011-10-01T15:32Z,1431 seeders and only 18 comments. Is this film watchable? A? V?
,i_steal_media_hohoho,2011-10-01T18:41Z,"A-9
V-7

This is pretty good for a cam. You still get the usual lighting issues, but on the whole it's good..."
,lissandroZS,2011-10-04T16:22Z,"baaaaaaaaaaaad quality...

,Avalon_42,2011-10-07T11:09Z,"Thanks for the upload, Any chance you could please get Moneyball ?"

,texassy,2011-11-11T20:50Z,"Ok Cam movie, but worth missing. Full of big stars, but too close to reality (up to the silly inoculation) which means dull and plodding. "
,dazzler5,2011-11-15T21:00Z,am deaf and rely on subtitles to watch movies ur spec mentioned english subtitles but found none when i downloaded! double check ur specs next time would mean lot to us thanks anyway
,Cowz,2011-11-28T13:05Z,can someone just shut down the m천천vilek site so we dont have to see all their spam shit anymore ?
[H],Eppo,2011-11-30T15:17Z,"@pmfabri
you're obviously not helping. Either stfu or report em."
,beeftv,2011-12-08T00:47Z,"VIDEO: VERY blurry, and only half framerate.

AUDIO: there is some static noise, but other than that, it's clear and there is no problem hearing what they are saying.

Overall, watchable if you can live with the low framerate. I can't. Fuck the idiot who made it."
,YardBoy,2011-12-17T05:28Z,"Thanks, have re-seeded 1.30X, but it's going really slow.  I suspect the leechers don't want the worst TS/CAM I've ever watched.  Most of the video looks like it's thru a greasy lens.  The audio gets quite bad near the end.  Wish I had waited for the DVD Rips now out."
