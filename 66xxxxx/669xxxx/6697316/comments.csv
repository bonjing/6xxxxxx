,FcuKUweBoll,2011-09-24T06:54Z,"i'm all for file sharing bro, but the aussie film industry needs every cent"
,Bobman84,2011-09-24T12:52Z,"^ They need to deserve every cent first, wouldn't you think? Why is it all our actors flee to the USA?"
,MatDryw,2011-09-24T14:15Z,Outstanding. Will Seed.
,kameko,2011-09-24T14:32Z,@bobman84 because only in the USA can you be successful making the shittiest movies for the dumbest audience in the world.
,samon24,2011-09-24T15:24Z,^ain't that the truth
,awesomewelles,2011-09-25T04:27Z,US film industry hasnt done anything truly original in fucking years. Aussies consistantly kick ass.
,rayzoredge,2011-09-27T05:51Z,"thank you, been waiting for this. "
,catfly,2011-10-01T09:44Z,"In the US films are made by committees,  carefully formed by focus groups and advertisers. As soon as the Aus film industry gets big enough to have committees, they will make the same 'something for everyone, but nothing for you' films. However this will probably never happen LOL cos there is no money for Aus films."
