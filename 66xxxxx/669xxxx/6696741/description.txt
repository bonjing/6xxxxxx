Synopsis
--------

18 18 "The DMV" Jeff Siergey Hugh Davidson, Larry Dorf, Ben Falcone, 
Rachel Ramras September 20, 2011 (2011-09-20) 1.739

After running a stop sign when taking Bugs to the movies, Daffy must take a driving test in order to get a 
driver's license when he doesn't have a driver's license. The same thing happens to Lola (who ends up running 
a red light) and Porky (whose driver's license expired). Even if they passed the written test, their driving 
instructor is Yosemite Sam. Both Daffy and Lola get their licenses while Porky failed the written portion 
(but in reality had perfect test scores that got mixed up with Daffy and Lola's respectively). 
Bugs tries to take Porky home, but crosses the double yellow lines, and worse, left his wallet with his license at home.
