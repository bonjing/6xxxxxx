[T],Nicodemus75,2011-09-21T01:46Z,Thanks for posting Saturn. Please don't stop just because I am double posting. I am not sure I am going to keep it up if people don't want it.

[T],Nicodemus75,2011-09-22T18:43Z,"glennbeck.com generally releases the podcasts about 15-20 mins after each hour.  All 4 hours are generally available about 1:20 pm EST. Since I wait for the 4th hour to be posted before I put up the torrent, I can generally get the torrent up around 1:30 pm EST. Each hour of the podcast is actually available much earlier, but I wouldn't want to post them as individual hours - it just doesn't make much sense."
