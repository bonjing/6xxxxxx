,thunderbum,2011-09-21T22:09Z,"Hi WillKane - many thanks for today's podcast :)

I personally haven't heard from Jwhitt. Maybe someone here has. He popped in a few days ago to say 'hi' but beyond that  I haven't any idea where he is or how he's doing. I can only hope he's okay.

Back several weeks ago he mentioned he'd be away for about 2 weeks thanks directly to Obummer's economics but he'd be back around the 15th.

JWhitt - if you're reading comments, could you let us know how you're doing? There's a bunch of people worried about you...

Semper Fi!"
,fizdude,2011-09-21T23:08Z,"Thank you very much Willkane!!! And yeah J, if you're reading this please let us know how you're doing and if all is well. We miss you!"
,dmechanic,2011-09-21T23:50Z,"Yea JWhitt62, are the are you still down with those Obamanomiks?
Hope you doing fine!"
,JWBly,2011-09-22T00:20Z,"I hope jwhitt62 is doing OK.  I know all of us appreciate his dedication in bringing Rush to us for...geez, how many years now?  When he comes back, we should all PayPal him a dollar so that he can buy himself something nice at the EIB store!"
,dbit35,2011-09-22T00:47Z,thanks

Also thanks to WillKane for filling in.  I have started posting the Glenn Beck podcasts including the 4th hour, which weren't available before and someone else started posting Laura Ingraham. Great that all this material is becoming more available. "

,sel96,2011-09-22T17:25Z,Many thanks to both WillKane and JWhitt62. I really appreciate your torrents!
,WillKane,2011-09-22T22:05Z,"Nicodemus75,

I posted Laura Ingraham and (Mark Levin) for 6 months in 2008 - here and on Mininova.

I listen to Rush, Levin and Jim Bohannon, while working on websites. Levin and Jimbo actually provide free podcasts on their sites."
,thunderbum,2011-09-22T23:05Z,"@Nicodemus75: I'll have to start grabbing the 4th hour Glenn Beck - many , many thanks!

...Ingraham and Levin? Worth listening to! :)

@JWBly - great idea! I'll chip in some $$ as well.

@WillKane - again - thanks kindly for filling in. Your efforts are appreciated!"
