A better quality version of this excellent Romanian/Moldovan documentary by Thomas Ciulei was needed. 

A father cleans chickenpox blisters on the face of his son, bare trees wait for snow, and another year begins as a landscape and a house gradually come into view. An elderly man has to manage a farm in a Moldavian village and raise three children because his wife has left to work in Italy, from where she occasionally telephones and sends gifts and money, so important to survive in one of the poorest countries of Europe.

Romanian with English soft subs.
