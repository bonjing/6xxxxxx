These are great songs from Celine Dion that once monopolized
quite a bit of the time I spent listening to my walkman as I
tend to be focused to completely absorb an artist or genre at
times - mainly I listen to Irish music and Italian too - although
essentially its British all the way when I'm not en-wrapped into Disco
too for the evening - or Oldies mainly plus Clayderman flavoured too just
as equally at times.


Enjoy some great Celine Dion here at 320k for you!
