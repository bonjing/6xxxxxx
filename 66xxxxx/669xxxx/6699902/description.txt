Based in Maidstone, Kent, England, Chicory Tip are best remembered for their catchy pop song â€˜Son Of My Fatherâ€™, which topped the UK Charts for three weeks in 1972. 

Founder members Barry Mayger and Rick Foster went through school together from infants up until 1961 when, at the age of 15, they left to take up apprenticeships.
It was when they joined a Youth Club and saw their first live band that they decided what they wanted to do. Within three months they had formed a group calling themselves â€˜The Sonicsâ€™, and gave their first live performance during an interval spot at the Youth Club.
Over the next few years various members came and went, then in 1967 the line up of Barry Mayger , Rick Foster, Peter Hewson, and Mick Russell felt it was time for a change of name, and Barry came up with â€˜Chicory Tipâ€™. Within three years they landed a recording contract with CBS. During this time Mick, the drummer, got married and moved to Wales, and was replaced by Brian Shearer
Although their first two singles were played on BBC Radio 1, it was their third release that made it into the top 100 singles chart, and Chicory Tip performed for the first time on â€˜Top Of The Popsâ€™.
