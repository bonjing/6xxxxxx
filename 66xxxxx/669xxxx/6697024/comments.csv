[T],youssef0eddoumali,2011-09-24T16:46Z,thx so much for this man
,GeorgeWest,2011-09-25T07:34Z,"First, thanks for all the great TTC stuff. You are spreading enlightenment and education to those that can't get it due to some socially unjust reason. I can't think of a more noble use of the Internet or torrent technologies. 

Now, tell me why you posted this torrent twice in about one week. Was the first one defective? It was only half the size of the latter one."
[V],dohduhdah,2011-09-25T11:46Z,Because people were interested in a high quality version. The low quality version became available first and later a high quality version also became available. Normally I would only have shared the high quality version and in the past sometimes others provided a compressed version.
,raenkae,2011-09-29T01:18Z,Thanks! Just the stuff needed. Come on. Let us seed this for a long time.
,phreak33,2011-09-29T14:53Z,"Love your torrents dohduhdah. 
I'm looking for a demonoid invite. 
I have a fibre line and I upload at 2.5 MB/sec (That's MegaBYTE, not bit) 24/7 with no bandwidth restrictions. I think my uploads for this month (so far) is somewhere around 1.9TB.

Email me truckerdude at ""google's free email service""
Thanks!"
