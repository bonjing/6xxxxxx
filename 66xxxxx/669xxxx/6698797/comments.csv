Why audio 1? Bacause channels are horrible. It's 2.0, but left channel is like front in 5.1, and right is like surround (or inversely).
P.S. Sorry for my english."

,skinny_gorilla,2011-09-26T04:45Z,"Wow! This is a pretty weak copy, Man! I lost my time. I should peak Extremezone as always but I thought BD rip with the same capacity will have better quality-WRONG. 

Next time I will because this one is a pure Absurdity...

Not worth downloading!!!Sorry mate."
,chooray,2011-09-26T23:31Z,"I'd have to agree with the rest. Audio is 2.0. If your watching this on a laptop its not bad, but on a big screen, there's pixelation issues."

,chrome176,2011-10-05T17:34Z,"Sounds is fucking terrible on the PS3 - You can't even understand what is being said.  

Pass on this, it's not watchable (on PS3) with such terrible audio."
