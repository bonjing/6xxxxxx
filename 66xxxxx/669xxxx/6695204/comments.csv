,zooter6,2011-09-24T06:05Z,"so we're goin' with the ""season 3"" title now?"
,SGreenwell,2011-09-24T10:27Z,"@ Zooter - According to Wiki, this is the start of season three, yes:

,xhizors,2011-09-24T21:48Z,No episode one???
,Fatfox,2011-09-26T03:41Z,"This is a bit unclear from the studio - this is actually Part 2 of a 3 Part Special, however apparently they've gone with calling it the Start of Season 3, even though Season 3 will only start properly in 2012.

So it could just as easily be the end of S02, or a Stand Alone 3-Parter. But no.

@ xhizors - look for Archer S02E14 - that's actually S03E01."
,joo-loved-it,2011-09-27T08:47Z,how do they possibly fuck it up so bad that it goes straight from s02 e14 to s03 e02?
,kiefchief92,2011-09-30T03:13Z,Thanks!
