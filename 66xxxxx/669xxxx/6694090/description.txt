Encoders note: 
Well friends here it is brand new QEBS 5.0 engine. I know many of you are asking 
what the fuck is this thing. Well let just say it is the tool which is at least
twice as efficient as normal x264 using low bitrates. This mean that even if you
could find better looking encodes, the QEBS encodes will have at least a class
better looking quality than anything else in similar size. Developing QEBS is not
easy and yes during each revision progress not all our choices were good and you
could not be satisfied with the quality in certain areas. To test our progress
we need to reencode the same movies over and over again and that is why we again 
give you the same movies, but this time reencoded with our new engine, which
progressed so much, that we decided to give him so much higher number 5.0 and 
start to differ our new releases created with it by using QEBS5 in the name.
Wanna know how good the video commpression can be, check this out :)

Check out the new instruction for fixing your player problemms.
Regards to all encoders especially Big thanx to Atom, FLAWL3SS and FraMeSToR crew
, Filix, Rok3r, Kempas, Stun, Askeen, Faolanscath and all who likes my work.

REMEMBER!
_________________________________________________________________________________
1. All FASM releases were done by THE PEOPLE for THE PEOPLE, so if you think they
   are worthy share them anywhere you want, but if you like the movie, show your
   gratitude to the creators by going to cinema or buying Bluray/DVD!
_________________________________________________________________________________
2. UNFINISHED/SAMPLE movies HAVE synchro problems, full movies DON`T. This is the
   nature of highly compressed content. The QUALITY of the display depends ALSO
   from the PLAYER you use. There are some buggy players which display those
   movies at the significiant worse quality!! If you have any problemms with your
   video player check "Instruction for fixing your player problemms" folder.
_________________________________________________________________________________
3. Please COMMENT my work ONLY if you have actually seen it. If you LIKED this
   release - tell others about it. If you didnt, leave a comment saying  why, so
   I can learn from your opinions and provide you with something better in the
   future. Everything here has been done with the reason, so if you do not
   understand something dont assume its done bad. Of course we also make mistakes
   so any observation is welcome.
_________________________________________________________________________________
4. I have found that XBox360 can play stereo AAC directly and 5.1 through WINDOWS
   media center extender. For more info read this forum: 
  
_________________________________________________________________________________
5. WDTV devices are causing so much problemms with AAC. I am not sure is this
   also the case with this release, so its better for me to give you stright link
   to the disscussion regarding this: http://wdtvhd.com/index.php?showtopic=23287
_________________________________________________________________________________
6. Movies can be directly streamed through WWW using Adobe Flash Player 9 or new.
_________________________________________________________________________________
7. FASM Quality Enhancer Bitrate Squeezer is h264 compression method optimized
   directly for lowbitrate HD contents. It is constantly being improved,  each
   revision brings quality to a new level. Its efficiency over standard x264
   encoding is explained by the same reason as XVID encodes are better than DIVX3
_________________________________________________________________________________
8. Any subtitles made for different releases, but taken from the same source
   (Bluray) should also work with this release. If you are looking for them visit
   http://subscene.com/
_________________________________________________________________________________
9. AAC sound must be decompressed and send through HDMI or SPDIF as PCM. Please
   also note that if you do have video card with HDMI that means you do have two
   different sound cards. Please make sure you do send the sound to the correct
   one. Its quite different from AC3/DTS where you send compressed sound directly
   from the source.
_________________________________________________________________________________
10. FASM 540p releases will concentrate almost totally on size to keep it as low
    as possible and STEREO sound to allow play these directly on most devices
    possible (even on newer cellphones.). Almost because the quality will be
    better than you expect it to be at this size...
_________________________________________________________________________________
11. FASM 810p releases will concentrate on the best balanced quality/size ratio,
    will introduce special smaller black bars effect. It will include true HD
    quality of the video and special stereo AAC LC sound to retain surround
    effects on small size. Such encodes should work directly on XBOX.
_________________________________________________________________________________
12. FASM 1080p releases will concentrate on quality, but the size will be low
    enough to fit below 4GiB limit and will contain AAC5.1 sound encoded to be
    almost transparent to source. The goal would be to create Rip with quality
    better than Bluray original itself (without guarranty that the size limit
    allows it).
