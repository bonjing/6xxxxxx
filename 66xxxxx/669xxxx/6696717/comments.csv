It's 1.23GB in size, but you'll finish downloading that one long before you'll ever see the light at the end of the tunnel on this one, if ever. Available here:

,blaackboxen,2011-10-13T04:31Z,"WTF, ""conservatives""?  Where the fuck are all the seeders??

Or is it that trackers REALLY REQUIRE FASCISM to function?"
,Actionsho,2011-10-19T08:56Z,"I'm liberal and the only seeder. I put these up because I believe in the spread of information.

I don't believe that the lack of seeders reflects a fascist conspiracy, just a lack of interest among users in general.... also these are all available on Yt... no real reason to download except if you want to watch offline."
