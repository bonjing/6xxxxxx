Tales of the Realm by Robert Kirkman
Fantasy meets reality! What if the amazing elements of sword & sorcery were blended with the familiar hustle and bustle of modern life on Earth? Find out as we follow three actors as they fight to make it big in a slightly different Hollywood on the hit TV show "Tales of the Realm!" It's the light-hearted adventure that dares to ask: is sharing a dressing room next to a sludge troll fun? And what's the best dragon to ride to work? 
A very cool series, short but sweet.
