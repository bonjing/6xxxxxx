Ok, first uploaded torrent, so bear with me folks.

After learning of the demise of SWG in Dec. I decided to look around and see if anyone had come up with Private servers. Yes they do! But, Sony decided to remove the upload of the client, so that was a pain that took about an hour or two to remedy.

So here ya go:

3 "disks" of the install in ISO (basic install)
Launchpad Enhanced.exe for the SWGemu (does fixes and implements necessary patches.
And for those of you using Win 7 and/or Gadgets: Server Status Gadget.


Enjoy!


Installation:
1. Mount and install via Power ISO (or whichever you use, I use Power ISO)
2. Kill the Sony Launcher (friggin useless. tells you it can't accept new accounts or provide patches)
3. Activate Launcher Enhanced.exe (installs patches)
4. (Optional) Use the gadget install to get a server status gadget for the 2 free servers

Coincidentally, you need to make an account on this site to have account details unlocked for the game servers:

After all that, run the launcher, and have fun!
