,Bryanrocks0,2011-09-22T06:42Z,I love the Catwoman and Batman sex scene. This is an awesome issue and I'm loving this series so far.
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-29T18:55Z,"I felt the EXACT opposite - I love Selina Kyle, her personality, her background, the choices she has to make, her relatioship with batman...

This Comic stripped that all away along with her clothes and made it a comic about selinas Boobs.

This is my summary of this comic: Catwoman getting dressed [she doesnt have a face, just boobs] ATTACK!! no time to finish dressing, just run around the city with my boobs hanging out because I dont know how to use a zipper, hey its batman... and graphic Sex scene -The END!

I enjoy looking at well-endowed women like every warm-blooded straight male - bur REALLY!? REALLY? They took one of my favorite characters and... you know what - fuck it... as the guy in the last comic stated - thats obviously what people want .... Im done"
,a321a,2011-11-05T05:44Z,"Yeah, because comics have serious and mature stories. Deep personalities.

People running around in underwear punching each other. Things blowing up. Half-naked chicks 'saving the world'.

Personality? Background? Choices? They just added more boobs to a pile of boobs. What a tragedy.

""Your cleavage now comes with 50% more cleavage.""
- AAAAARGRHGH!! They're ruinin' tha' stories and tha' characters!

Those fucking americans..."
