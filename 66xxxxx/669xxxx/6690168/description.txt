ReleaseNotes:

The material on disc one is essential even to casual fans. These sixteen tracks are drawn
from the band's first four albums and features the dual guitar attack of Duane Allman and
Dickie Betts, along with one of the finest white blues singers around in Greg Allman.
Disc two picks up with the band recovering from the tragic loss of Duane Allman and releasing
the most commercially successful album of their career, BROTHERS AND SISTERS (No. 1, 1973),
and their only top 10 hit single "Ramblin' Man." The rest of the disc culls highlights of
their best material from the next three decades.

We rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.
HHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)
