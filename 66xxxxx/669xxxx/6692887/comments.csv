I will seed to 40-50 until the upload is established!"
,Phntzm79,2011-09-22T13:51Z,The files in this one are the same as V3-1 but the Torrent is improved significantly with many more added trackers.Seeeeeed Please!
,Phntzm79,2011-09-23T04:21Z,It's funny the genesis of these uploads happened because I wanted to put her songs on my ipod but couldn't download them from Anonymous because of Zero seeders and bad trackers!So I found the songs!End of Story. 
,Phntzm79,2011-09-24T18:48Z,Post some comments after you download my files and listen to her music!Peace and share.Phantazm79
,Phntzm79,2011-10-01T16:40Z,It's cool that this torrent is starting to get going!I'm still seeding.I think there will be much more interest in her music because it has a quality and a simplicity that is cool and hot! She changes her voice and has a clean sound!
,Phntzm79,2011-10-07T14:39Z,Singles are at 320kbps but First album is at 256Kbps!Post some comments after you listen to these cool tracks!Phantazm79.Seed and share!Peace
,Phntzm79,2011-10-07T15:00Z,It's still a mystery why her first album was pulled from iTunes kus the songs are cool!It took me a long time to find them in cyberspace! in the 1's and zeros.Phantazm79.Share and Seeeeeeeed to at least 1.00 please!Peace to all.
,enzored,2011-10-10T20:38Z,"thanks, i appreciate it. i found her on youtube and all the songs are beautiful funny and interesting. even though i'm not getting her lyrics because i'm not an english speaker..
by the way, was the album title 'first album'?? or was it self-titled? "
,Phntzm79,2011-10-11T08:45Z,The Cover said Lana Del Ray aka Lizzy Grant so it was self-titled!
,Phntzm79,2011-10-14T13:09Z,Thank You people for seeding!! I did a test and downloaded these files to check speed and seeders.I got the files in 4.5 min and had>85 seeders using http://tracker.publicbt.com! Keep up the good pirate seed ratio and don't hit and run!Pirate Forever!Peace to all!

,Phntzm79,2011-10-21T17:32Z,"307 Seeders!Great for a torrent for an unknown new artist! When her second album drops, I predict she will be appreciated at another level!Phantazm79."
,Gh057man,2011-10-23T14:52Z,"@Phntzm79
You have uploaded these songs in about half a dozen torrents with small variations. I personally am interested in one song; ""video games"". After downloading this track from 4 of your uploads I find (just before and after the 2 minute mark)  you have recorded other shit in the background (which is possible if audio is stripped from the music video clip - I haven't bothered with watching that). I suggest if you are going to create multiple torrents of what is essentially a small amount of data take the time to listen to it first. Frickin' numbnuts!!"
,Phntzm79,2011-10-23T17:46Z,"Gh057man, You are an idiot. I uploaded the material in different forms to give people options as to what they wanted to download and as I was getting the material!I noticed the glitch in the song you mention but I didn't create these recordings, I simply found the material and made it available.Your freak show response about a glitch in one song tells me that you are an emotionally unstable an immature personality and probably gay!The main purpose of this was to give people her first album which was hard to find!as it existed on iTunes for a very short time. If you are only interested in one song, you are again an idiot! Phantazm79"
,Phntzm79,2011-10-23T20:12Z,I will upload more Lana Del Rey material this week! with a corrected version of Video Games mp3 to get that Gh057man Bitch to shut the fuck up about one song!What a Pussy! Actually Wussy! Half Wimp Half Pussy!
,Phntzm79,2011-10-23T20:17Z,410 Seeders! Great work people and Thanx for seeding!Phantazm79
,Gh057man,2011-10-26T03:53Z,"Thanks for you efforts anyway Orgzm79 - but I found a 320Kbps version elsewhere (Piratebay won't allow me to mention that place here but it rhymes with nice 'o' c*nt)

Yes ... perhaps my comment bordered on an abusive rant - purely out frustration of another's carelessness (hell.. I'm not perfect either - a fact you so kindly pointed out). 
My problem is not the fact you uploaded multiple varied torrents but that these uploads each included a track with the same obvious  'glitch'. If I understand correctly you were aware of this prior to uploading. It would be courtesy to inform users of such a problem so they can either download the material and live with it but not waste f***ing time if otherwise!

Also labeling someone as an idiot for being interested in one song is such an illogical conclusion to reach since you know not why I sort out this one song.
Otherwise ... damnit! ... my secrets out! You indeed have me pegged - I am an emotionally unstable, immature and wussy gay Aussie. ;) Have a nice day ... mate. "
,Phntzm79,2011-10-27T10:08Z,Your a funny guy Gh057man!
,Gh057man,2011-10-27T15:22Z,"Hey dude -  the issue has long dissipated from my end. So, bygones. :) ... Oops ... I forgot about the comment I left for you on my own torrent *sheepish grin*. "
