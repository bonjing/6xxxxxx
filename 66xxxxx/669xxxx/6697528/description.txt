Mr Holland returns with the latest series of the BBC2 flagship music show with a typically
broad mix of quality artists including Snow Patrol, Emeli Sande, The Duke Spirit, Trombone
Shorty, Roy Harper and Little Dragon.

Snow Patrol return to the Later... studio with songs from their sixth studio album Fallen
Empires, including current single Called Out in the Dark. Aberdonian raised singer-songwriter
Emeli Sande makes her terrestrial TV debut performing an acoustic version of her smash
debut single Heaven, after collaborating with everyone from Tinie Tempah to Professor
Green. Cheltenham formed modern rock band The Duke Spirit, fronted by the indomitable
Liela Moss, perform songs from their third album Bruiser, including current single Surrender.
Young New Orleans trombonist Trombone Shorty and his funky band Orleans Avenue storm
the studio, having been championed by the likes of Jeff Beck and Wynton Marsalis. With
tunes from the Treme raised frontman's latest album For True, the iconoclastic singersongwriter
Roy Harper finally returns to the BBC in his 70th anniversary year with a classic
song or two from his new archival collection Songs of Love and Loss. And from Gothenburg,
Sweden, Little Dragon make their show debut in their own right after guesting with Damon
Albarn's Gorillaz, with songs from their acclaimed electro-tinged third album Ritual Union.
