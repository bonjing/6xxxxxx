,sinner77,2011-09-23T05:55Z,The skull shows that he is a trusted uploader........so no worries there
,intrinsic75,2011-10-22T11:30Z,"The ""trusted"" skull doesn't always mean its a good quality download. But, I'm going for it if it's that small."
,intrinsic75,2011-10-22T11:43Z,VERY slow so far. My ETA says 1d7h.  :-(
,intrinsic75,2011-10-22T12:11Z,2d 16h now. It's getting slower.
