No offence geez', but ye are talking crap!

You downloaded this earlier and it's the same version as this...
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6687255/Area.51.2011.DVDRip.XviD-NYDIC

As per ""Files"" x1 top left corner of page and you've simply renamed as 1-3-3-8.com_Area.51.2011.DVDRip.XviD-NYDIC.avi, it's the same

As you can see on Bones torrent, we're all getting a bit pissed off about people uploading 51 as Area 51 and you are worse by saying it is the feature film version, not the SyFy one, deliberately misleading, at least the others are just making a mistake, it seems, whereas you are more concerned about getting the number of downloaders on your torrent than telling people the truth.

I don't usually complain about uploads, can't recall if i ever have actually because the material is free and i'm thankful for the free material, but this is now getting beyond a joke regards the expected film Area 51 and those who keep upping the SyFy and saying it's the Area 51 feature, so same goes for you as i've commented here... http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6690732/Area.51.2011.DVDRip.XviD-WiDE.

Knowing the feature film version, Area 51 as opposed to 51 from SyFy, was initially released in Norway on 23 March 2012 and was temporarily withdrawn for retakes etc so states on IMDB it's not yet released, it's possible an illicit DVD of the film has got circulated, things like that happen with torrent, so when uploaders say it's Area 51 and the IMDB page states not yet released, some of us know there is a possibility it is actually the earlier released version of the feature version non SyFy film, because it's been around since March, just withdrwn for rewrite/reshoot.

We downloaders rely on people being honest and factual regards what uploaders throw up, so far, again and again and again, same BS, different encodes/rips of the SyFy version being desribed as and linked to the Area 51 feature.

So don't pump out BS Stu.

You grabbed this from Bone or somebody earlier, and to say it's not the SyFy version and link to the feature film version, you couldn't have even looked at the film because it says a SyFy production in the first minute of the title sequence.

I won't trust what ye say on your torrents again!!!"

Yep, i've been pissed off about a couple of wrestling shows which were unwatcheable recodes of webrips made to look better by converting to XviD at twice the filesize but were itter crap, is all, in just over 4 years since i registered to make torrent comments on TPB, upload etc, used TPB for longer but was mainly a TorrentSpy user before 2007.

I don't complain about uploads like some idiots who whinge, whinge, whinge constantly.

But this 51/Area 51 BS is beyond annoying at this point, if uploaders say Area 51 and link to the feature but what they're upping is the SyFy version, which most everybody who's a sci fi fan on TPB has already downloaded or seen on SyFy channel, it is just wasting our time and bandwidth when we dl the same film over and over again because you guys can't check and get the versions correct, so it's understandably annoying the crap out of us now, i'm just one who will articulate that annoyance."
