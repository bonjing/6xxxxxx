  Matt Baker and Ellie Harrison head to Scotland to explore Loch        
  Etive. The fast, white waters make it the perfect training ground     
  for the RNLI's international flood rescue team, as Matt finds out     
  when he joins their ranks for the day. Meanwhile, Ellie discovers     
  how a fluke of nature has brought local mussel farms to the brink of  
  collapse and explores the industrial heritage behind one of           
  Scotland's most beautiful landscapes. And with more and more of us    
  choosing to holiday in Britain, John Craven investigates the impact   
  of the "staycation" on our countryside. Down on the farm, harvest is  
  nearing its end - but has it proved fruitful for Adam? Plus a         
  reminder of how to vote for your favourite image in the Countryfile   
  Photographic Competition.
