The music of Arborea is a reflection of their visual imagery that captures the epehemeral beauty of nature. It has translucent qualities with many textures and complex layers, a simple yet complex design like nature. Red Planet reveals glimpses of their world that will capture and invite you in like a warm fire.

As before, Buck and Shanti play all the instruments with the welcome addition of Helena Espvall of Espers who provides the sonorous cello accompaniement on â€œSpainâ€ and â€œArms and Horsesâ€.
