Thirty years may have passed since their landmark album Dare! helped to define the early-80s electro scene, but the Human Leagues signature sound remains just as relevant today thanks to synth pop starlets like La Roux, Ladyhawke, and in particular, Little Boots, who collaborated with lead vocalist Phil Oakey on her 2009 debut, Hands. For Credo, their their first studio album since 2001s Secrets, the Sheffield trio don't require much of a makeover in order to compete with their younger upstarts.
