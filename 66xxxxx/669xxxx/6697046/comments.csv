,stonerz101,2011-09-25T16:44Z,@tacohot Thanks for the information But this is the cracked version. Basically the same thing. But notch doesnt offer the objet in the installer that allows u to play the game(:
,Konkor,2011-09-30T17:32Z,Actually you can use any cracked loader. If you copy the official jar file from the minecraft site into your directory then copy the cracked loader from an official thread it will still work. Stonerz stop acting like such a faggot because there are other ways to download minecraft.
