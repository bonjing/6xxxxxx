Summary:
 
The three remaining teams roll into Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta, and learn that when it comes to food, Georgia is famous for two things: peaches and peanuts. Tyler announces the Truck Stop Challenge to create an original dish incorporating both items, but instead of providing these Georgia specialties, they must beg and borrow from the locals downtown. Chef Kevin Rathbun determines the winner and hands out a game changing reward - a guaranteed spot in the finals. All bets are off as Tyler reveals the game-changing Speed Bump: each team will lose their lead chef for the day.
