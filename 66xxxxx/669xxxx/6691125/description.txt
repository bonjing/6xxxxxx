From Wikipedia:
The stories center around a singular family, the Crossovers, all four members who are involved in different genres of sci-fi/fantasy. Carter, the father, is a typical superhero named Archetype, with strength and flight. Calista, the mother, fights vampires and other supernatural menaces. Cris, the daughter, through a portal in the basement, visits a sword and sorcery land to become the warrior princess Eradika and lead her forces into and out of battles. Clifford, the 10-year-old son, disgruntled, becomes involved with a small alien force. Eventually, all four aspects of their secretive lives come crashing together, sometimes literally, endangering many.
