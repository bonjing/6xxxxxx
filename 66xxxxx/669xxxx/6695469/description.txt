Federal Reserve Bank Meeting Agenda:

A) Call to order

 1) Chairman The Ben Ber-nank: Presentation on merits of TWIST program
 2) Enjoy $16 corn muffins

B) Adjourn to hotel bar

No smoking while on official Fed business, so those enjoying cigars please wait until after the meeting. Complementary stacks of $100 notes will be provided (no one likes an unevenly lit cigar). You're welcome to use the unburned notes for more $16 corn muffins and drinks at the bar.
