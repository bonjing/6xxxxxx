Tnx for your answer. That is what I'm actually doing. Using the Rzr-launcher, the game boots up. I get the codemaster's intro screen, and the F1 2011 title, then.. nothing. Screen just stays black. No menu, nothing. As I mentioned before, I'm still able to access the M$ account menu, log in, log out etc. but the game never starts.. I don't even get the option to start, quit, options..

Is anyone else having this problem?

1) Install

First: Download and install openal32.dll from here: http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?openal32
.
Second: Download and install microsoft windows live from here: http://www.microsoft.com/games/en-us/aboutGFW/pages/gfw3intro.aspx
.
Third: Install the game. Allow to install DirectX and C++ during installation. 
.
Fourth: After install go to the installed folder(C:/ Program files(86)/ Blackbox..) There double click and open the ""F1_2011_Launcher"" file (with RZR icon). When its open you can see som 8bit videos and wiered music. Press the ""Esc"" button in your key board and the game will launch. it worked for me. good luck. Thanks seeders. :D"

,thiyago88,2012-04-13T00:36Z,"Funfando!!! so que o uploader devia colocar o metodo de instalaÃ§ao para que as pessoas sem experiencia consigam executar o game corretamente.Ja que ele nao colocou vou colocar:
Emule a iso no Daemaon tools
Execute o instalador 
O jogo vai instalar Rapidamente mas quando terminar a instalaÃ§Ã£o  vai abrir uma janela do CMD prompt de Comando do windows Decodificando os arquivos de audio 
so depois disso clique em next do instalador.
Apos isso abra a pasta redist da iso que voce emulou e instale o Opem AL e o Game for windows live.Nao execute o icone de atalho do desktop va a pasta do jogo e execute o F1_2011_Launcher como ADM no windows 7. E complicado mais vale a pena o game esta muito bom sem lag e isso ai galera faÃ§am bom proveito do tutorial  pois eu tive que aprende na marra."
