[T],dynstab2,2011-09-21T12:59Z,"This author is unknown to me and to... Google! More info needed. The only calculus author I know going by this name (spelling?) is Maurice D. Weir who has been the coauthor of Thomas' Calculus, now in its 12th ed. and available on TPB (along with solution manual)."

It looks beautiful on my iPad, and rather than renting from the Nook or Kindle applications for $100+, I now own the textbook in a digital format. Thanks again."
