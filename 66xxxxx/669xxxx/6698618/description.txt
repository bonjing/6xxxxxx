Ben Webster  Music For Loving With Strings
Released: 1995
Label: Verve
Format:Flac

Following in the footsteps of his idol Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster's corpus of work has stood up to the test of time. His lyrical sound has made him one of the great tenor saxophone masters in jazz history. On Music For Loving, Webster plays mostly ballads, the style in which Webster feels most comfortable and sounds best. His smoky, romantic sound is perfect for tunes such as "Prelude to a Kiss" and "(I Don't Stand) a Ghost of a Chance (With You)."
