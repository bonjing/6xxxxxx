Release Notes:

Here we are with another release to share with all Rewind 2010 DvDRiP XviD - ViSUALiSE..
a pretty straight forward rip on this one as dvdr was used as source files :P

Played with the colors, sharpen'd, denoised and ran some other filters through this
to get this looking nice for every one

Can we just say a big thanks to wobs and rfc for showing the support to us inwhich they 
are ;) cheers guys :P 

Hope you all Enjoy This Release........If not the Re-encodes that will follow  :P
