Platinum-selling singer, songwriter, and musician Gavin DeGraw will release a brand-new album, entitled SWEETER, on J Records on August 9th, 2011. Gavin first broke through with the 2003 release of his debut album, Chariot, which sold over a million copies, earned platinum certification, and yielded three hit singles: I Dont Want To Be, Follow Through, and the title-track, Chariot. Gavins self-titled second album debuted at No. 1 on the digital sales chart and at No. 7 on Billboards Top 200 album chart in 2008, earning Gavin his first Top 10 album. It spawned the hit singles In Love With A Girl, which Billboard dubbed a rocking homerun, and the gold-certified We Belong Together. In 2009, Gavin released Free as a gift to his die-hard fans clamoring for recorded versions of Gavins live favorites. (Amazon)
