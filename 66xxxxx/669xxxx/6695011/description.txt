"Biology 101"

As the Greendale study group gathers in 
the library, they wonder whether they 
will see their old friend Pierce, who 
left the study group in a huff after last 
spring's paintball game. Jeff quickly 
butts heads with their new biology 
teacher Professor Kane and is kicked out 
of class - leading to a crisis within the 
group about whether they will all stay 
together. Dean Pelton is feeling 
empowered after a summer at "Dean Camp" 
but finds a new nemesis in Vice Dean 
Laybourne, dean of the highly regarded 
Air Conditioning Repair Annex at 
Greendale.

Evolve...or die.
