NGC 4594 was an obscure quintet who issued just one single, \"Skipping Through The Night\" on Smash Records in 1968. Alongside their sole 45, this CD for the very first time offers a dozen recordings from a \'lost album\' the band made during 1967/68. NGC 4594 formed in Storrs, Connecticut, but swiftly relocated to NYC before eventually disbanding in late 1968. For fans of West Coast-influenced Psychedelic music. Sleeve-notes by Tune In\'s Gray Newell tells the story of NGC 4594 for the very first time!

Formed in Storrs, Connecticut in 1967, they chose a truly astronomical moniker in their search for stardom (NGC-4594 being otherwise known as the \'Sombrero\' galaxy). Their 45 features very pleasant psychy soft-rock with the odd jazzy feel. Going Home is the more commercial, slightly more upbeat. Skipping is the gem here with its mellowed-out aura and trilling flute - somewhere between Boston\'s Freeborne and UK\'s Caravan. Delightful.
