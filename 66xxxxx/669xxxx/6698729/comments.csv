I've been using splash pro ex (you can find it here) and its awesome. Has this really cool feature which somehow makes the motion how you see it on the new 240hz led tv.

I'm assuming the movie is an awesome 1080p rip, just because it's BOZX and I've gotten plenty of good rips from him including both 720p and 1080p versions of THOR (10/10)

I'll rate a/v once it's done, which on my connection could be awhile:/"
,below90hz,2011-09-24T23:23Z,"@SD_rocks

I hate to be the bearer of bad news but guys who know their stuff think 8475Kbps IS a low bit rate. Absolute minimum for 1080 resolution of a live-action film should be > 9000Kbps. 10k and above is preferable.

Your screenshots are the EXACT same quality as BOZX. The only difference is the processing: your screenshot is much higher contrast. The human eye prefers contrast, and the darker blacks mask the macroblocking better - but it is only creating the illusion of looking ""better"". Increase the brightness of your monitor you'll see the macroblocking is still there. Someone with a trained eye won't even have to do that, it's obvious there is no increase in resolution or quality between the two screenshots."
,himadri18,2011-09-25T00:04Z,The screenshots reflects a poor vdo quality for a 10 gb movie. I will rather wait for a better rip......
,nintendomanb,2011-09-25T00:51Z,"@SD_rocks 
It's my opinion that the original does look better just because when increasing contrast, you run the risk of blending the darkest colors together, as well as the brights- the other colors are ""stretched to fit"" in an attempt to make other things in the mid range more visible. This new shot does just that -just a little too heavy with the contrast. 

Of course, with that being said, it does look prettier if you aren't focusing on the brights or the darks, even if its just got higher contrast put on it.

Are those serious questions?? Really?

It clearly states ""English"" under spoken languages.
And as far as video FPS, it should be common knowledge for anyone who even care about FPS that when it comes to motion pictures that they are all shot and released at 24 frames per second, give or take .033 second of a second.


@war59312 Like I said if it matters so much to you that you are willing to act like a little whiny bitch about it then buy it or do it your damn self. :)
People who upload do it because they choose to when they don't have to and they put more effort and time into it than you are obviously willing to, so that right there revokes your right to bitch and whine about how crappy it is, it is FREE after all, you're not paying for shit so don't complain about shit.

BOZX is so childish, soon after I left a comment complaining about the blocky first snap shot (in comments of this torrent) I got a few minuses at my torrents, lol even at those which were not yet completed by anybody ;-)

We may be paying for the internet but not for the movie and thats what piratebay offers us. Both the audio as well as the video quality of the film is great. THANKS A LOT... ""BOZX"" for such a nice upload. There may be other better uploads of the same but considering the data size of the film, this is one of the best RIPs of the Bluray movie."

,evilfud,2011-12-09T06:09Z,"Ok after 5 days of encoding and trying everything i can i am running into the problem of stretching the movie vertically because of the 1920x800 when i use uncropmkv on it i get audio out of sync and very bad pixelizing. I am going BD-R on standalone players. Please let me know if you know a sure fire way to get this working. I need quality as im shooting on 115"" 1080p."
