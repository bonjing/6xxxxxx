,tangucho,2011-09-25T09:58Z,"Works perfectly. I install with the setup icon. I just want to let you know guys that VRay 1.2.6 has been released and its all over the internet. Its totally working with this and with the keygen posted here also. Just be careful and set all your permissions to Read and Write, especially the file generated by the keygen. it took almost an hour to realize why it wasn't working."

,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-10-28T01:12Z,"what you also could do is check ""sprbay.org"" its like a really big forum where everybody posts there problems and get helped really fast (REALLY FAST) I'm sure there is a post for your problem and the peeps helping you out are serious PROs at torrenting and internet stuff. And as your problem is that your bandwidth or something is being annoying I guess thats the firrst place you should look for answers. (I'm not the best at long distance ""please make my internet faster"" stuf ^^)"

Plugin 'Depth of fied' (id 1001400)
