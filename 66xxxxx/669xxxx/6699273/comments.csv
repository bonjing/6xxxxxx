Asshole! Spoiler alert!"
,axismundi,2011-09-26T12:06Z,"That wasn't a spoiler, Amy is in this episode for 2 seconds and no way at all do they suggest she's leaving the show, at all, period. So relax."
,BinkyDeath,2012-01-13T21:38Z,"axismundi & xJDxMUSHx - Maybe you should BOTH refrain from commenting on the film/movie etc itself AT ALL. We only care what the quality of the torrent is - NOT your views on the actual film. Both of you please just DON'T give your opinions, your reviews, your personal thoughts, likes and dislikes or anything else on the content of the episode/film. Axismundi - you gave a spoiler by saying the previous guy didn't give a spoiler. How did that make sense to you?
It makes no difference to this torrent now but would you both just remember in future that nobody cares what your personal opinion is on the film and keep it to yourselves in future every time? Noone cares if you like or dislike something because their tastes may vastly differ from yours. Don't add them for that reason AND also because the next downloader may not have seen the film/episode yet. 
This is not a review forum - the comments are for the quality of the file ONLY  and maybe to thank the uploader too.
I hope this is a good quality upload since the previous ones have all been lousy - but noone's bothered to comment on that when they should have done instead of whined about and given spoilers.
I'll try to get back to comment on the quality later if I can to help others instead of wasting their time."
,BinkyDeath,2012-01-13T22:00Z,"It's the same file as all of the other copies I've found so far:
TV Rip from the BBC One HD channel (so the resolution is tiny since it's copied from an HD channel).
It has the exact same tinny-sounding audio problems for the first 25 seconds of the episode as all of the other torrents I've found so it must have been a problem with the BBC transmitter. :( That means that all of the TV Rips from the BBC 1 HD channel will have this fault. 
Recording from the normal BBC 1 channel makes more sense if the finished resolution is going to be so tiny - plus you wouldn't have the channel label in the top left corner.
The HDTV label in the torrent title shouldn't be there as it's not High Definition by a long shot.
I would expect better quality and higher resolution for the file size - but I guess it's about average quality for the usual rips around for this resolution. Not horrible quality, but not good either. Not dissing the uploader here - just my observation on the quality.
v:7 a: 1-8 (variable) if you want points for quality.
Then again - I can't find a better copy below 1Gb, only the same copy under different file/torrent names or some differing in file size, probably due to the coding, which seems to make no real difference to the quality of the fininshed copy. 
One's as good as the other (especially at this low resolution) if it has been ripped from the BBC One HD Channel as the transmission is pretty poor."
