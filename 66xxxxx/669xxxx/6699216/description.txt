"Dude Ranch"

Our favorite family decide to don their cow 
boots and hats and head to Jackson Hole, 
Wyoming for some fun and adventure in the 
great outdoors. While vacationing on Lost 
Creek Ranch, they try their hands at a little 
cattle herding, skeet shooting and horseback 
riding; there are also some big firsts, a 
huge surprise and an actual face off between 
Jay and a foe - a cowboy named Hank!
