Football highlights with Manish Bhasin. 
After the exertions of midweek Carling Cup action, it is back to the demands of league action 
for many of the clubs in the npower Football League. That includes Middlesbrough, 
who have started the season brightly and who take on Ipswich Town at the Riverside. 
It is almost a year since Tony Mowbray took charge of Boro, a club he represented with 
distinction for a decade, and the results have improved markedly under him. 
He steered the club away from relegation last season, and Boro have taken that form into the 
start of this Championship campaign. The show also includes highlights of the BBC's live 
offering from Saturday evening between Watford and Nottingham Forest.
