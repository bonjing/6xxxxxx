600,000 plus died during the U.S. War Between the States using these antique weapons, weapons with an effective 50-200m range...   The tactics employed were dated, but the deadly effect of a .44cal ball round with 30-60 grain of black powder from a revolver or a .50, .54, .58 even .69cal mini ball round from a black powder rifle is not disputed.  

Check with your local gun club, we have Black Powder weekends once a month at the range.  I use a 1863 Zouave .58cal Rifle and at 300m, those watermelons never see it coming and you'd be shocked to see how fast you can aim, fire and hit 6 targets with a Remington 1858 New Army revolver at 50-75m...  With my 1847 Walker I can punch through 4 old stacked cars doors and still blow apart the looting watermelon hiding behind.

I'm not saying Black Powder is a first line of defense, use modern smokeless weapons as a first choice always, but having that 6 shot .44cal 1851, 1860 or 1858 revolver loaded, primed and holstered on your hip...  Well, less than $300 on an antique copy revolver or rifle might just save your life when some of those 300 pound pumped up rioters-looters decide your home or business is next on the list to destroy and your life is in danger!"
