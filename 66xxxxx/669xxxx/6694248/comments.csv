What stands u out frm the rest of the crowd is the SIZE of ur ups.It helps people like me with low bandwith to watch gud bengali movies in very decent qlty.
So if after compressing some of the old movies if the qlty is bad i think it is better to skip.
Just keep uploading in the small size
I am also very happy to know of ur pedigree frm ur previous comments....my respect for u has gone up a notch or two!!
thks
take care"
