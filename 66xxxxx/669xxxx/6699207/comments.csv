,TheMainEvent,2011-10-23T11:59Z,But where are the libraries? Where to download them?
,MattyBoy1964,2011-10-25T14:24Z,"Same problem as TheMainEvent, where are the libraries? Do we have to download them from elsewhere? If so, where please?"
,StormnHunt,2011-11-16T20:10Z,"This is a standalone, search for the libraries, it's not hard."
,MH20,2011-12-13T23:22Z,"hey guys, i got this one. but i cant active it in the service and when i want to run alicias keys it says that i need to , like. activate the program for using library or something like that. not sure now, it wont let me run alicias keys at any case :("
,twotap,2011-12-18T18:49Z,"Any idea how to get this to work with Sibelius 7? I put kontakt's VST plugins in the VST plugin folder for sibelius but it still doesnt show up in ""Playback Devices"" for sibelius."
,jackmedia,2011-12-23T13:18Z,"@Rosie1966...You said this will support 3rd party libs...Will this also support expansion packs powered by Kontakt5 from Native Instruments?

@Steve_612...I have AVG, and I didn't catch that.

,jackmedia,2011-12-23T14:04Z,"@ MH20...are you running on a PC or Mac? If you actually own Alicia's Keys you can run it in the Kontakt 5 free player demo if you download it. One problem you may be experiencing is if you are running a PC you need an additional system requirement in order to operate the VSTi. You need to have the SSE2 (Streaming SIMD Extensions 2) for additional support to power the instrument. Oh and one more thing...NI says sys reqs for the new Kontakt is supported by Windows 7, which explains why I am not able to download their demos. Time for an upgrade...Vista is such a memory hog anyway.! *smh

@ twotap...if you have ReWire, which should come with your version of Sibelius...when you have your Kontakt 5 open it should ask you where you want to store your VSTi files. You should note well the place you want it. In your case it is Sibelius 7. 

Open Sibelius...then navigate to the top of your menu bar and click on ""play."" Down at the bottom of the play menu click on ""playback devices."" From there if you don't see K5 yet, click on the ""audio engine option."" Browse and locate your VSTi Kontakt 5 file in the ""virtual instruments and effects folder."" Once you locate click ""rescan."" Close the window and then close Sibelius. Restart Sibelius and then go back to playback devices. Now you should see K5 as an option and then click ""activate""...then click ""show"" and K5 will pop open. Now you are ready to use it.

If that doesn't do it...I don't know."

,straterrific,2012-01-03T01:47Z,Same issue as mainevent and mattyboy.  Loaded fine but clearly did not load included libraries.  Pretty much useless without them.  Any suggestions?

,nerdhound,2012-04-18T17:27Z,"@ALL Noobs - Learn about Keygens, adopt an attitude that allows such things. If you fuck your shit up? ... Learn from it and rebuild. Most importantly STOP trying to freak out other Noobs out with your 'Trojan' or 'Virus' Talk.

Just Learn, Really

For everyone else, NO Problem with this Torrent.

Oh, If you're asking for 'Libraries' then this particular Torrent isn't for you. (in that they don't exist)"
,fdjkltrj,2012-05-23T23:07Z,"There is indeed a trojan in this torrent, and not just false positives. After installation, I had a C:ProgramDataTpScrextpscrex.exe which wasn't there before. The file had just been created, because it had the current time and date. It had also been added to the Windows startup. Now, since I don't own any ThinkPad (tpscrex.exe is part of ThinkPad FullScreen Magnifier), it doesn't take much intelligence to figure out that this is malware disguised as another program. Other than this, Kontakt 5 seemed to install and work just fine, but if you care about your computer you should try find another torrent."
,fdjkltrj,2012-05-23T23:08Z,(meaning = there could be more surprises hidden in there somewhere)
,element7x,2012-05-26T16:13Z,Found a Trojan/Sisron on the setup file. Not a false positive or your typical hacktool flag. This one is lethal guys. Don't download.
