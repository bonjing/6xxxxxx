BRAND NEW ARC! Great jumping-on point for new readers. One of the greatest horror franchises of all time returns, now under the control of its original creator! Clive Barker has touched HELLRAISER only twice: once to write THE HELLBOUND HEART, and once more to write and direct the original HELLRAISER film. Now witness Barkers long-awaited return to tell a new chapter in the series official continuity-a trajectory that will forever change the Cenobites...and Pinhead! Kirsty Cotton faces her greatest foes -- both new and old. And Pinhead is her greatest fear! But what could he have planned for her?
