,LMTPBay,2011-09-23T11:34Z,"This isn't your rip, don't take credit for shit that isn't yours."
,tommyrobby,2011-09-23T11:50Z,seed please
[H],politux,2011-09-23T14:49Z,He put his name on the House screener too.  If you're going to upload something that you got from another source it is kinda silly to put your tag on it as if it were yours.
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-09-23T14:55Z,"@LMTPbay, I don't see him taking credit anywhere. What's your problem ?"
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-09-23T14:57Z,"C'mon guys, you're allowed to put your name in the torrent file. It'd be wrong if he says he's created the file, when he really hasn't."
[T],soupucia,2011-09-23T16:28Z,"@LMTPBay, politux

Both releases were spread via P2P only and were tagged as NoGrp. As long as they arent scene releases and tagged NoGrp, I will feel free to tag it however i want it.

And politux:

Saves the Day - Daybreak (2011) [mp3] politux = Saves The Day-Daybreak-(Deluxe Edition)-2CD-2011-MTD (same file size for disc1)

Isn't it ironic?"
,xXwatchtowerXx,2011-09-23T16:52Z,"is this the epi. that will go on tv or are there things gonna change

i never downloaded a dvdscr from a tv-show before
always a hdtv version"
,aParadox,2011-09-23T18:28Z,"No it's not, because it's from his source, you douchebag soupucia."
[T],soupucia,2011-09-23T18:52Z,"At least politux is a respected user and he's entitled to an opinion. Your opinion, aParadox, doesnt mean shit to me, sorry."

Isn't it funny.. People get angry when you steal somebody else's work.. Even when he just made a video file, not the episode.."
[H],politux,2011-09-24T00:52Z,"@soupucia 

Hey man sorry for being a dick earlier.  I misunderstood the reason you had put your name in the title.  "
[T],soupucia,2011-09-24T01:35Z,@politux no problems man 
,dflanagan,2011-09-24T01:35Z,Any reason that people just can't say thank you?

,balanced,2011-09-24T02:54Z,ok fine:  frig you flanagan and your sissy stuff.
,lampost,2011-09-24T07:02Z,Are you really complaining about someone stealing someone else's work while you are illegally downloading things? That seems wonderfully retarded...
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-09-24T07:03Z,"On a different note, this is gonna premier on Oct 2nd, any idea how this leaked out ? Great upload btw :)"
,klinic,2011-09-24T09:53Z,"People are getting so wound up over the title, lol. You should get out more."
,dac1949,2011-09-24T14:39Z,"thx, great show!"

@soupucia thanks for the upload and to everyone for sharing!"

,amyadkins,2011-09-25T03:43Z,"Anyone know where I can find English subtitles for this episode?  It's amazing that they already have Portuguese and Italian subtitles up already for this but not in English even though the show is in English and you'd have to translate from English into the other language anyway, would just make more sense to upload the original English subtitles concurrently with the translated ones, wouldn't you think?"
,vanillaroom,2011-09-25T14:09Z,"I do not care man, you can put your name in any crap you want, this is the essence of piracy. Thanks for sharing."
,dac1949,2011-09-25T14:40Z,"amyadkins,

You do not know what you're talking about. There are freeware groups of subtitles workers, what for pure generosity, pleasure and very hard job, builds the subtitles from ""audio Torrents"" for multiple languages​, ...so you found Pt.br and others."

,magikp,2011-09-26T04:02Z,"thank you thank you thank you, soooo happy i love this show"
,GrassyAss311,2011-09-26T05:15Z,Anyone who is mad cause he put his name in the file is a idiot. You honestly think any of these files where actually created by the person posting? These files get passed down so much and the name gets changed so much its not even funny. I think the only people that must get credit are the scenes or ripping crews that actually rip/burn the movie/tv shows.  Thanks for takin the time to hunt down this episode. And fuck all these idiots bro i download and upload mass files and always change the name and add mine sinse im doing the work to post it. You would be suprised how many people dupe even on private trackers
