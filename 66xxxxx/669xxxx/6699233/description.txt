Well, here's a Spotify HQ stream rip and MP3 encode of the Rockabye Baby! Bon Jovi album that you seemingly can't get anywhere illegally. ;D To be perfectly honest, I think Bon Jovi kind of sucks ass. I did this rip for a friend, and I guess it's for the torrentable availability that I now upload this torrent. Someone with a fondness may bring forth a better pack.

This is the whole album as a continuous MP3 file. I'm not going to separate them, because this isn't what I love. I'm not sloppy when it's things I love, but Bon Jovi in any shape isn't one of those things. Caveat emptor.

Anyway.
