When the severed hand of a young man is found close to Harold Penton's estate, Hale is
convinced that Penton is guilty of rape and murder. Penton, a wealthy businessman and
philanthropist, is also a recluse and very keen to protect his privacy. His bodyguard, Jimmy
West, does his best to prevent Hale from getting too close, insisting, along with Penton's
doctor, that he is too ill to be questioned.

Eve and the team use forensic evidence to move forward in their investigation and, although
they make a compelling discovery, they still struggle to prove who is responsible for the
young man's death.
