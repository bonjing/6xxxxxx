,langes01x,2011-09-25T05:51Z,2 GB but only 720 pixels wide? What the heck is this? It's worse resolution than 480p ...
,hootieman,2011-09-25T08:05Z,The audio cut out like the other one does from ExtraTorrent?
,sun2244,2011-09-25T14:05Z,720x304 is low resolution
,Jack_Raiden,2011-09-26T00:56Z,"Another excellent SD (480, non-HD) release from Feel-Free. Proper/high bitrate (esp 5.1 AAC audio), beautiful. Thanks again BONE, seeders.

The fools come out for movies like this! langes01x and sun2244 are such. 720x304 has been the standard SD resolution for years. It is not HD nor is it stated as such you bunch of dunces. Another ProTip: BD/BRRip concerns source, not resolution."
