1 - The map can be started by pressing the button you set in the config.cfg
2 - You can only play solo. You can not play in private match or online.
3 - The multiplayer maps does not work anymore, only the map zombie walk.
4 - If black ops crash, BOOptimizer.exe run as administrator.
5 - It is mandatory to start BOOptimizer.exe if you want to play the zombie map.
6 - If you have a message like this: "Server unknown script compile error function" is that you play with the version SKYDROW and that the map is compatible with.
You can try reinstalling the game but I'm not sure this will solve the problem.
