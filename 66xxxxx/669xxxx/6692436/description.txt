The second episode of the documentary series takes a look at bizarre and extraordinary
feathered dinosaurs, many of which have only just been discovered. These feathered beasts
are revolutionising our understanding of life on Earth as they blur the boundaries between
what we know of dinosaurs and birds.

China sits at the heart of the feathered dinosaur discoveries and is the home of one of the
most unusual discoveries on Earth: the epidexipteryx. Only the size of a pigeon, this predator
was the most bird-like of any dinosaur and is the first known case of ornamental feathers.

But feathers were not just confined to the small. From caudipteryx to sinosauropteryx and the
8-metre-long gigantoraptor, feathers may have been used for flight, for insulation or even to
intimate and attract. These dinosaurs not only hint at how animals might have developed
flight, but also suggest that dinosaurs may still live among us today - as birds.
