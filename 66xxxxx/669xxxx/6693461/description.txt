Did a re-encode with episode 01 of AnarkiDotNET's upload: 
 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4843790/Cardcaptor_Sakura_%5BDIGITALLY_REMASTERED%5D

The first few minutes now has subtitles (from dream up to Sakura and Toya's fight).

Doesn't have the opening and closing songs as compared to original.
