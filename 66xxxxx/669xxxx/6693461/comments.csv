,dark_moonx1,2011-10-27T08:19Z,I'm still seeding this... ^^
,ajhong2,2011-12-19T07:30Z,I don't see any way to enable the subtitles on VLC nor do they automatically pop-up. Is there something I'm missing?
,ajhong2,2011-12-22T12:34Z,"Never mind, I figured it out. I used MKVToolNIX and the extractor to take out the text file and re-merge it as a subtitle. Still I thank you for the upload dark_moonx1."
