Storyine: 1990. The rave scene has arrived from Ibiza and warehouse parties are exploding across the UK. In Manchester, best mates Matt and Dylan have embraced the culture with open-arms, but they have dreams of being more than just punters. As the government moves to outlaw the scene, itÃ¢Â€â„¢s now or never and they quickly rise through the ranks to join the promoting elite. They are taken on a wild journey from the exclusive VIP rooms of London clubs to the outrageous parties in Ibiza super-villas and the hedonism of Amsterdam. ItÃ¢Â€â„¢s everything they dreamed of and more. But as their success continues to grow, they find themselves caught up in a darker and far more sinister world. Matt and Dylan start to drift apart as they are forced to question the dreams they set out to achieve and their once solid friendship.
