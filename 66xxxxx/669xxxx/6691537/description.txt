Never Shout Never has been
reborn. While the moniker has
long referred to
20-year-old Christofer Drew, it is
now the name of a full band
with the
messy-haired singer-songwriter
at its helm - and the change
couldn't have
come at a better time
With six EPs and two albums
under his belt, over 2.5 million
Facebook fans
nearly 50 million MySpace profile
views and over 157 million song
plays
it's clear that Drew has achieved
breakthrough success since his
first
upload. However, the talented
guitarist experienced some dark
moments
following the release of his Butch
Vig-produced album, Harmony,
becoming "a
little bitter towards the music
industry" and left shaken by the
breakup
from his girlfriend of almost two
years. But, through his search for
a
higher consciousness, he found a
path of enlightenment that led
to a whole
new outlook on music and life
In an almost therapeutic way,
Drew has woven his experiences
into Time
Travel, the first album recorded
and produced by Never Shout
Never, which
now includes Drew, Caleb
Denison (guitar/drums/
percussion), Taylor MacFee
(bass) and Hayden Kaiser (guitar,
percussion). The band members,
who each
contributed backing vocals on
the full-length, holed up in
Springfield, MO
just one hour outside of their
hometown of Joplin, and
dedicated themselves
to making Never Shout Never's
most impressive album to date
