Ripper :

What isRipper ? 
Ripper takes a list oflinks and retrieves their direct links/URLs.

Why?
This allows you to downloadlinks en masse using your favorite
download manager, such as IDM or FlashGet.

For example, after MFRipper has finished a list of links, you can copy them
and use IDM's Batch Download From Clipboard function.

Entering Links:
Only 1 link per line, or 1Folder link.
MFRip will rip the folder for you.

Note:
If afolder link is entered, any other links entered with it will be ignored.
You will have to re-enter those other links if you still wish to grab them.

Passwords:
MFRipper will prompt you for a password when appropriate.
Simply enter the password to the file to continue ripping links.

Captcha:
MFRipper will prompt you for a Captcha when appropriate.
Enter it until you get it right to continue ripping links.

You can get a new Captcha image by hitting the Refresh button.
