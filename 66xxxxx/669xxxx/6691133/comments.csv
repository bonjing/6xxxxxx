,doczenith1,2011-09-28T05:19Z,Why 59.94FPS?
,SoundHound,2011-09-28T16:36Z,"Standard NTSC HD video broadcasts have a frame rate of 29.97.  When video is in a progressive format the frame rate is doubled ie: 29.97x2=59.94 fps or Hz.  In this case the over-the-air signal from my local FOX station is 720p.  There are many other formats or frame rates for HD video content.  29.97 Drop frame rate was introduced when color broadcasts came out as the 30fps frame rate was slower due to the added color information and programs would run slightly longer than wall-clock time.  It gets very complicated and confusing and I had to write a term paper about it.
