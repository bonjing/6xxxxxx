,catfly,2011-09-23T10:11Z,much thanks. can't wait to see what happened in this show - that season ender was amazing.
,Crustynudger,2011-09-23T10:58Z,Why do all ASAP releases have repetitive blurriness? Its like the camera pops in and out of focus at one second intervals. Every episode they release has it. Well sloppy.
,namgod12,2011-09-23T15:01Z,"very good , but did anyone find errors on show,Lisbon has an injury due to shooting but she drives a car with one hand , does not engage any gears  to drive off, nor does she release hand brake, must be a remarkable car, wish I had one like hers , from the UK"
,MaskWhoRU,2011-09-24T10:38Z,ty!!!!!
,Fabrix7777,2011-09-24T12:09Z,"@namgod12   LOL, man the car in the stated have all automatic gear so you really need just a hand to drive it."
,Annetta11,2011-09-29T19:48Z,Thanks a loT!!
,master-t,2011-09-29T20:32Z,love you man :)  
,Shaktipat,2011-09-30T01:22Z,"-I`m grateful for the upload, but here`s one thing: This is one of the uploads that has a focus/blur issue, like some other uploads have: The focus gets blurry, just a tiny little bit, with the same intervals.. every other second.. the whole time.. and it is really bothering, gets me kind of dissy. -Is this an issue with a program? It has been like this with almost every episode in avi format, so now I`m going to skip them, and download only 720p. Takes more time, but it`s worth it. To bad, because otherwise the quality is great."
,Shaktipat,2011-09-30T01:24Z,"-I see others have commented this as well, and it`s true:  All uploads from ASAP have this.. I`ll stay away from this from now on! DON`T DOWNLOAD ASAP, IT`S SLOPPY WORK!!!"
,seaburnsafc,2011-10-01T08:34Z,Shaktipat & Crustynudger stop moaning. what do you for free. stop downloading & wait to watch on tv if you not happy. you idiots.
