Mandel is known propagandist that has a fix on justifying serbian war crimes (during 90's when Serbian dream of Great Serbia followed after the fall of Yugoslavia) by attacking USA. And attacking USA for anything it does is the right opium of many who don't care for context as long as it's USA playing the act. If anything, Serbia is getting a escape card by the international tribune for anything it did. War criminals who Serbia claimed are NOT in serbian territory were discovered exactly when Serge Brammetz said that EU doesn't have patience with Serbia anymore and if those men aren't ""found"" Serbia won't enter EU. Lo! and behold, soon they were ""found"" in Serbia living quite normal life. Mandel accuses USA of propaganda but keeps a closed mouth on serbian propaganda that was way into the madness. Serbian ""newsreporters"" for example took footage of bosnians and croatians that were attacked by serbs and with cut-and-paste aired it serb media as ""serbs being attacked by croats and bosnians"". 
In Sarajevo, serb newsreporters made claim that ""serbian children were being thrown to the lions in zoo's"". This operation was lead by none other that rock band ""White button"" which was composed of bosnians and a croat.
Sure, USA is the bad guy here, Mandel. "

If someone suggests he has an agenda, they are under no burden to prove it to you, they are entitled to have an opinion regardless of whether you happen to agree."
