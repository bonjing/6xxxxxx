It was released May 19, 2009 (see 2009 in music).[1] It features the songs from his 1968 classic album, Astral Weeks. The live performances on the DVD were filmed from two separate concerts by Van Morrison at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, California with a fourteen member band. The DVD is featured as an Amazon.com Exclusive in the United States with a release date of May 19, 2009. Morrison has already released an album on CD and vinyl on February 24, 2009 entitled, Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl with material from these two concerts.

As producer of the CD and DVD, Morrison insisted on no post-production engineering so that the sound would be as close as possible to the live concert performances.
