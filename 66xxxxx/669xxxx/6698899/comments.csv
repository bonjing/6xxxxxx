,omnimodis,2011-09-25T19:00Z,Thanks.  What's with the cmd.exe autostarting (I didn't touch anything just minimized the installer and then the cmd.exe opened and it's compressing all these files inside the game folder).  Never seen that before with any of your releases.  
,noorida,2011-09-26T03:56Z,"well the game works fine and thank you very much for it .dude!

,Walsheh,2011-09-26T19:50Z,"didn't work for me :\

1. unrarred it
2. ran setup.exe
3. installed
4. CMD finished
5. ran the game and failed?"

,Lerianis2,2011-09-28T01:27Z,"Okay, I found out how to 'fix' the error I reported, but it's a crappy fix. You have to find settings.cfg in the directory you installed in, manually edit it, and set the game to 'fullscreen = false'..... which pretty much ruins the game!

I have to say that this crack should be nuked."

,zagiel80,2011-10-05T00:54Z,"1. Incredible repack. Dude, you're a God. Smooth, no ugly half-broken install tools, unbelievable bandwidth save. Thanks a lot.

2. I've been looking for some good action RPG for last couple of days and couldn't find anything solid. Discovered this by chance and thanks to Dude had in half an hour.

3. Saves work - just get to your desktop icon properties, go to advanced and mark a checkbox ""run as administrator"".

4. Escaping from Death into the church: you're doing it well, guys, when your press the arrow between inner and outer white circle. You can see that the Death gets a punch when you press in the correct moment. The only problem is that you must also keeping walking forward. So you hold the forward while concentrating on the reflex mini-game.

5. Overall, it is very nice game. I have a low-to-medium-end graphic card, with many 2010-2011 releases lagging like hell, but this game excels on it - not a single lag, beautiful animations and textures, not mentioning the daemonic mode. Cut-scenes are professional - keep you interested and have no simplistic body language, like many others games do. Sense of humour is typically French but idiotic. Gameplay seems like hack-and-slash at start, but later you start using tactics, like which weapons are better for removing opponent's armour piece / flash and which combos end up on the body part you want to be dealt with. Weapons swings are a bit slower that in similar games, but at least can you can plan a combo, of which there are many and you develop each one of them on usage. At least weapon makes you feel its weight and not like if it was a wooden gimmick.

6. Can't really understand how somebody can write such negative comments, except for hidden fanatic christians and game's devs being angry that the game was leaked so soon. Graphics are beautiful yet optimized, you can skip the cut-scenes with space and I've never seen a console-aimed game that had such a good key customization."
,zagiel80,2011-10-05T00:57Z,As for the camera angles - map a key for centering camera somewhere close and you're good.
