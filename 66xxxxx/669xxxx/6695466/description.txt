DigitalPh33r (now known as JonCJG)'s "Arby 'n' the Chief" Season Three


I'm a fan of Jon's machinima, so I decided to download them all in .avi 

format either through zamzar from youtube, or when it gave me this 

"target has size of 0 bytes" error, I would use the flashgot addon for 

firefox and convert to .avi with Pazera FLV to AVI convertor. I thought 

that there might be a chance that some other fans may want these videos 

as well, so I figured I would upload them for the lulz. If you're 

unsatisfied with the quality of the video I'd welcome suggestions on 

how to download them while keeping its original quality.

For this season, the episode "Party" was originally split into 5 parts, 1 being the main video, while the other 4 parts posing as flashbacks in seperate videos using "Youtube's annotations" or something like that. The reason for the .wmv extension is that I merged all the parts together in Windows Movie Maker to create one single file.


I will upload Hard Justice, It's a Wonderful Live, One Life Remaining, 

and Arby 'n' the Chief in their "seasons" as they are completed, and I 

get around to downloading them, in the event the reader would want 

those as well.


I'm a fan of machinima, but my horizons are limited, if anyone sees 

this and would like to recommend some lulzy machinima for my viewing 

pleasure, feel free to do so.


Love,
