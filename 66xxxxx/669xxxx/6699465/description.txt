given a job at a boutique through Nucky's connections, and        
crosses paths with his mistress Lucy. Agent Van Alden learns

Nucky celebrates his birthday and uses the event to try and       
expand his influence over both the Mayor of Jersey City and a     
United States Senator. Margaret is tasked with delivering a dress 
to Lucy, and finds solace from her disillusionment by shoplifting 
lingerie. Chalky exacts revenge on a local Ku Klux Klan leader    
for a lynching. Jimmy and Capone expand their business operations
