http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1629439/

Not Area 51 as per torrent description IMDB url...
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1519461

Can uploaders STOP putting the wrong IMDB links for this SyFy version!!!

You keep putting the wrong IMDB, most people have already downloaded this, if you put the Area 51 link as is done here, and people D/L it believing that it's the non SyFy feature we are all expecting at some point, it's just wasting our time and bandwidth, just because whomever is putting torrent NFO descriptions together can't get this frackin' film right.

I'm sick of it and i'm pretty sure all other sci fi fans using TPB are frackin' sick and tired of the same mistakes being made by most regular uploaders of films who keep putting 51 up made by SyFy but naming it Area 51 and putting the proper feature film IMDB url we're all waiting for as information but it isn't and they keep getting it wrong.

I mean, how many of you guys need to make the same mistake over and over again before you realise how completely frackin' dim it's making ye all look.

How hard is it to CHECK FIRST, the fact it's the SyFy version is there in the first minute of the title sequence FFS!!!

I don't usually complain about uploaders, but enough is enough already!

Stop making the same dimwitted frackin' mistake will ye."
