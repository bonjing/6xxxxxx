,123487,2011-09-21T15:00Z,Did they up the bitrate because last seasons eps were half the size?
,karo13,2011-09-21T16:00Z,it says on my bittorrent that there are 0 seeders and 48 peers D:
,fraren,2011-09-21T16:58Z,Hey I really enjoy your files but why did the filesize double compared to last season?
,Darksteel1335,2011-09-21T22:24Z,"The reason for the file size is because everyone for some reason have kept the pilot episode for ""New Girl"" on the end of it."
