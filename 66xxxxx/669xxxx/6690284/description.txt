Emphasizing how to work with natural light rather than using supplementary lighting to create an artificial environment, photographers can use these simple techniques to mold existing light into the desired quality and shape. All situations are discussed, including overcast and sunny days, backlighting and flare, window light, daylight studios, natural reflectors, and studio lighting at home, offering a plethora of ideas for finding, diffusing, and creating light. As photographers learn the advantages of shooting with available lightâ€”no set up, more spontaneity, more time to concentrate on the subject, and the ability to capture preexisting relationshipsâ€”they not only become better photographers but gain confidence and an increased awareness of their artistic medium.
