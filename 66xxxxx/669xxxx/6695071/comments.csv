,surenlokka,2011-09-24T10:45Z,"please if you can upload all the seasons of Criminal Mind (2005) tv series in mkv(size=150mb,
Resolution: 852x480)  format...thanks ......please reply........"
,The.Buzzsaw,2011-11-12T22:11Z,"Sorry surenlooka ( http://thepiratebay.org/user/surenlokka/ ) but the best I could do would be 7-10 Gb per season which is between 350Mb and 365Mb per file. However, a good person to ask about that is RiddlerA ( http://thepiratebay.org/user/RiddlerA/ ). He was the originator of low-size/great-quality uploads on TPB. I'm sure that if it can be done, he can do it. "
