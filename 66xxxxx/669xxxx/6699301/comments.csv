,putterer,2011-09-25T02:51Z,can someone confirm/deny the sound issues reported by Fezman?  thanks.
,Fezman92,2011-09-25T03:24Z,Just redownloaded it. The feedback is only for the first 20 seconds. 
,edetech,2011-09-25T04:28Z,Many thanks!  I think you must work at the BBC to get these out so quick. ;)
,Sattori,2011-09-25T10:13Z,Thanks!
,ChrisNerd,2011-09-25T15:44Z,the video quality is full of artifacts. hardly HD.
,Essa75,2011-09-25T16:35Z,@putterer  there seems to be an audio issue at the very beginning of the episode!! Downloaders be aware......
,poptop99,2011-09-25T17:13Z,"I watched this on sky plus from bbc hd just now and the sound was robotic for the announcer before it and for the first 10 seconds or so.  It was ok after that and not really the uploaders fault.  

Why has spoilerboy got a chip on his shoulder.  "

Also why has spoilerboy got a chip on his shoulder?"
,catfly,2011-09-26T02:23Z,"I'm not anti-poove - but cannot see why there is a gay dr who section in this episode. The guys 900+ years old (and sex-less anyway when it comes to humans)- surely he can come up with a better distraction than trying to snog the guy, give us a break."
,Ravenswing77,2011-09-26T08:42Z,Is it true that Spoilerboy is a wannabee nancy boy who's too busy wiping the jizz from his lips to type coherent sentences?  YES!
,clearshock,2011-09-26T14:30Z,"@catfly thanks for the spoiler, inconsiderate cunt."
,otoryu,2011-09-27T18:56Z,"@Spoilerboy

I'm from the Gay Military's PR department and I can tell you that we had nothing to do with this episode.  The BBC's totally unaffiliated; they're just too awesome to listen to wannabe trolls who cannot form coherent arguments based in reality"
,otoryu,2011-09-27T18:56Z,*reality.
,stevieb,2011-10-01T12:26Z,thanx :D
