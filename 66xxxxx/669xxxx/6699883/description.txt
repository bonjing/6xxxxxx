In 1993, Warner Brothers continued their tradition of ever-expanding animated programming, with the hilarious Animaniacs. Hailed by critics as a wonderful show not only for children but adults as well, Animaniacs would seamlessly blend the past with the contemporary in an amalgam of material that would entertain fans of all ages for five seasons. Although not totally encapsulating all of the aired first season, this first DVD set distributed by Warner Home Video, contains most of the season - with 25 full episodes and a extra to keep you happy.
