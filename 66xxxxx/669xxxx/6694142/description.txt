This is it: the one the audiophiles at SteveHoffman.tv swear by! This is the definitive CD edition of the classic Getz/GIlberto album, Verve Super Best series, POCJ-9202. This is the only CD to feature the original mix of the album as it was mastered in 1963: Astrud Gilberto panned hard-left, drums panned hard-right.

All tracks are ripped as-is from the CD. Some tracks, however, featured an odd ringing sound around 15.6 kHz. Perhaps someone had a TV tube on in the studio. The noise is particularly harsh on "The Girl from Ipanema," and spectral analysis shows it to a lesser degree on several other tracks. So for these tracks, in addition to the directly-ripped versions, I present de-ringed versions for which I very carefully removed the harsh ringing sound.
