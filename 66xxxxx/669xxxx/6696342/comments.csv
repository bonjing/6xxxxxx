,eyezpinned,2011-09-25T15:50Z,"this appears to be legit disc to flac. the easiest way to to tell is to load the audio file into a spectrogram, mp3s and mp3 to flac conversions have a sharp cutoff at about 18000 hz. true lossless audio goes well into the 20000 range. these audio files pass that test."
,kornchild2002,2011-09-27T10:41Z,"Although I am not making a comment about this release (since I haven't downloaded it yet), spectrograms aren't a surefire way to tell if a lossless file is from an actual lossless source.  Lame can be made to encode frequencies higher than 18KHz producing spectrograms that look like lossless files.  The same thing holds true for the iTunes AAC encoder at 224kbps and above.  There really isn't a foolproof way to determine if lossless tracks are actually from a lossless source."
