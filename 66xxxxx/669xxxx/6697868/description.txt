Kaname Chidoriâ€™s one of the most popular girls at her high school â€“ unfortunately, 
itâ€™s her growing popularity off campus she should be worrying about. Unbeknownst to Kaname, 
terrorists are plotting her abduction, believing she possesses the rare and coveted abilities of â€œthe Whispered.â€ 

Thatâ€™s where Sousuke Sagara enters the picture. Heâ€™s a hotshot soldier from the clandestine 
counter-terrorist organization known as Mithril â€“ and heâ€™s going undercover at Kanameâ€™s school 
to try and keep her safe. He may be an ace in the cockpit of an Arm Slave mech, but thereâ€™s no 
training in the world that could prepare him for the warzone of high school.
