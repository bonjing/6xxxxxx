***********************************

Instructor's Solution Manual (ISM) for "Mechanics of Materials: An Integrated Learning System, 2nd Edition" by T. A. Philpot (c2011)). Strategic grouping of the 16 chapters in 3 small bookmarked PDF files. Problem statements (with figures) and solutions included. Units: US and SI (mixed).

Comment: Detailed solutions. Thourough treatment of hyperstatic problems (including those involving temperature variations). An excellent problem set to accompany well-known textbooks like the ones by Beer&Johnston, Hibbeler, Craig Jr, etc. Use of colour. All 3 files archived separately (7-Zip) for separate download if needed (via the .torrent file).
