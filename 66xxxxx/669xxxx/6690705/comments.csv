,melvox,2011-09-21T14:27Z,Can anyone confirm if this is virus-free and working?
,Illanair,2011-09-21T23:18Z,It is most likely virus free - and working depends on what you mean. The game runs horribly on anything newer than XP. Crashes and poor performance in the main menu is common in Vista/7
,bakaonna,2011-09-22T03:30Z,"Weren't GOG supposed to release DRM-free games that work both on older and newer versions of Windows? Still, it might explain the need for a separate software-rendering exe."
,Kvass187,2011-10-05T07:43Z,"Works ok. No DRM, No virus."
,foudrenoir75,2012-01-06T02:12Z,"I tryed another popular version and I had a few video problems with it. This one is easier to install, works great and there's no virus."
,H4ck3tt,2012-02-07T16:31Z,"Simply does not work on Vista ... after trying everything under the sun, there is nothing but a black screen, and then a ""Not Responsive"" error ... as for the torrent itself: fast downloading speed, no viruses, and easy to install! +1"

,snusbagaren,2012-03-11T19:21Z,"Worked right after install, but get crash from time to time. Will try to google some more."
,Arbiter89,2012-03-20T23:19Z,"Thanks for the upload, bro! Really wanted to play this game."
,Jonatoor,2012-03-23T19:08Z,"Works good on my win7 64bit home edition. Only yjing is that it crash when I click the ""ring"" inside game, I think it is ""review game.."" somthing. No virus.

,STFUuNoob,2012-04-21T10:49Z,"@h4ck3tt: Nothing works on Vista, dude ^_^"
