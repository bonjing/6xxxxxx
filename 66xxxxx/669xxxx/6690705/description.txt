The Good Old Games DRM-free release of Dungeon Keeper II, patch 1.7. This means the patch adding secret creatures and the Maiden. 
The torrent also includes the game manual, reference card, and the editor.

The game runs on more recent versions of Windows OS, on single-processor and SMP architectures. It does have some problems with hardware rendering on non-nvidia video cards; the software mode runs well, though, and the GOG installer will create two different .exe files, for each mode.

Since my previous upload was deleted and I got banned due to it (apparently, it not being in the shape of a scene release caused a pattern-matching error), I'd like to ask downloaders to post a few comments for feedback - good and bad, as is your experience with the torrent and its contents.
The game contains a setup*.exe file, the installer, and three zip files (password-free) containing the manual files and editor.
Since I'm uploading the same files as before, I believe the two peer swarms will be able to merge seamlessly, and the people already downloading will be able to continue.

The game works out-of-the-box on wine.
