[T],Nicodemus75,2011-09-22T18:47Z,"Arvsventure: The website does not actually provide a ""podcast"" in the traditional sense.  While I think they did at one point in the past, and with gbtv.com up and running they may move to a podcast in the future, the only official release are mp3 files downloadable from the website. I wish they did a ""podcast"". What I mean by ""official"" is that these are not rips, but the mp3s provided by glennbeck.com"
