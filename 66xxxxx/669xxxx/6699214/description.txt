Covert One:
The Hades Factor
The Cassandra Compact
The Paris Option
The Altman Code

Very clearly, for the record, I did not rip any of these and I have just compiled and converted them to the format I prefer. I have listened to them all, and they all work fine for me. Thanks to all the original posters, which can be found on Demonoid!


Enjoy and Seed!!
