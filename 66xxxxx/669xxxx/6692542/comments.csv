Thanks Stumpie"

,efcalways,2011-10-25T09:10Z,great audio and video but after about 38 mins the movies starts over again from the opening credits.
,efcalways,2011-10-25T09:18Z,"ok, kept it playing as it still said there was another hour and half left to go, but at the exact same spot it has gone again to the opening credits. Dont waste your time downloading this as it is just the first 40 mins played over 3 times."
