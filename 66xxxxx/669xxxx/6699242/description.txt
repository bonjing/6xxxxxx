[b]Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D


Source: R1 DVD-5 playON

Encode:
well DVD was already completely shrinked to dvd-5 with 3 languages and bonus material
leaving not much space for the movie itself, so the movie itself already had very low
bitrate, which made it very hard to make a decent video out of it, had to make 9
different encodes to finally get a good version, was also a bit dark and had a slight
noise in it. i am sure this is the best possible video that can be done from this dvdr.
added brightness, slight sharpness, rgb and denoise

Note:
there were 7 mins of deleted scenes on the disc which are here attached as a single
file for those who want to see them.
enjoy

Video: 720x304 @bitrate 1800 2pass
Audio: English AC3 5.1 @384
Sample: yes, included
Bonus: yes, 7mins of deleted scenes[/b]
