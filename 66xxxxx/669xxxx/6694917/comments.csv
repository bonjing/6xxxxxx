Why post this older version for Lion users when the newest version of 7 is only about half a screen down and works just fine on Lion? Nobody who can run Lion would need 6 over 7. "
,Phuque2,2011-09-23T16:06Z,pryingeyes this only proves that TPB only gives morons and spammers skulls so they can post dupes like retards. Specific PD6 versions are already shared. Who the fuck even knows what outdated version this old shite is.
