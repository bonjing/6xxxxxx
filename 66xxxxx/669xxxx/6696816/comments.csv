By the bye, sometimes the subs from DVD version can differ from blu ray edition. It may have extra minutes or raws."
,jenchai,2011-09-23T23:30Z,"You can use that software to adjust the time delay, framerate and everything."
,bharatrn,2011-09-26T16:09Z,"Hi Gabe,
Would it be possible for you  to upload English subs for A propos de Nice and taris?
Thanks again."
[T],-Gabe-,2011-09-26T19:39Z,"Hi there
Sorry to say but there is no sub for that on Internet. Try to watch it with a good french listener :)"
