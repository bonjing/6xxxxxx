Oldies used yo refer mainly to the great stuff of the 50s and 60s early too
That term has evolved I gather. I can only describe this as oldies fashioned
stuff with great music hits of the 40s much in here too!

This is the finest music of songs - not from Time Life or Readers Digest
however sometimes an even better lineup is possible from these folks equally
I say! Even more so all too often in some cases certainly!
Try this great offering of music - We even have traditional
Greats such as "Danny Boy" by the uniquely incomparable Ms. Ruby Murray
and Tony Bennett, Judy Garland, Al Martino and lots more!

Enjoy and share Liberally please!
