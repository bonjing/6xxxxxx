"The Veda Rays are an indie band currently based out of Brooklyn, New York. Combining elements of post-punk, art rock and experimental, the group's sound is further characterized by the visceral rush of garage simmering just atop the surface of their narcotic noise-pop sheen. "

â€œThe Veda Rays are a darkly inspiring spiral galaxy I get immersed in. This is art rock for a tougher crowd.â€

"Akin to numerous legendary ensembles of yore ...The Rays were borne in a swaggering haze of sex, drugs (metaphorically speaking) and of course, rock 'n' roll. Yet unlike a bazillion indie rockers, contemporary and otherwise, the Rays know how to write songs that stick in your memory banks!"

One of my favorite new bands to come out of Brooklyn. Enjoy!!
