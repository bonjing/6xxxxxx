A guy asks if the movie is the french one prior to the imdb info being posted. Not if the language is french or the movie is in france.

What's ridiculous is you assuming he meant the language when its right there for all to see in the torrent info. Then you repost the same info that he's already seen while presumably loling at your own stupidity.

Definately not the behaviour of a geek."
,clewis7,2011-09-29T11:04Z,"Storyline:
Five friends returning from a marriage in Canada return home to the United States. Not far from the border, two customs officers stop them to check their identity. Suspicious, they take their time especially with Jalil, a man of Arab origin. The situation worsens when a customs officer finds a small bag of marijuana in the luggage. Then things degenerate rapidly: a customs officer grabs the little dog that's part of the group and slits open its belly to be sure it's not a mule. When Gab makes a move, he's shot. The customs officer orders the surviving friends to undress and put on orange coveralls. Gradually, it dawns on the four tourists that they are in the hands of former torturers from Guantanamo. "
,garfiel,2011-10-08T03:55Z,Audio issue??  At about the 50 minit's into the movie the audio moves.  I found that cutting it at 48 minit's then moving the sound on the rest by -600  (.6 of a second) and then putting it back together it was reasonably in sync.
