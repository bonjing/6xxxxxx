,TorrentGuy96,2011-09-24T19:05Z,"@The_Collection Curse these long titles, I tryed but it says editing cant be done at the moment, is there another way to change it?"
,sephalon,2011-09-24T20:47Z,I'm getting a pretty significant audio desync. Probably about 2 seconds. Anyone else?
,TorrentGuy96,2011-09-24T21:14Z,"@sephalon What are you using to play the video? I used both VLC and WMP, worked fine for both :S"
,Uocjat,2011-09-24T21:29Z,@sephalon had that on windows media player classic aswell but works fine for me with normal windows media player
,sephalon,2011-09-25T08:18Z,"@TorrentGuy96: Media player classic. Unlike Uocjat, I can't play it on WMP modern at all. It's not a big deal, MPC lets me set an audio offset. But in general you can expect a lot of folks to be using MPC, cause it's what CCCP installs."
