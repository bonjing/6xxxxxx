    A girl trying to escape her over-active libido becomes a pawn in the     
    hands of international espionage in this sexploitation opus from         
    director Barry Mahon.                                                    
                                                                             
    Laura was raised in a rooming house run by her widowed mother, and       
    when one of the tenants forces himself upon the attractive teenager,     
    she discovers she has an overpowering weakness for older men. Hoping     
    to run away from her troubling desires, Laura hops a bus to Los          
    Angeles and appears unannounced at the door of her Aunt Mary, where      
    she hopes she can find a place to stay.                                  
                                                                             
    When Laura learns that Mary earns her living dealing narcotics, she      
    flees, and while drinking away her sorrows at a nightclub, she meets     
    Schneider, a suave but mysterious gentleman who works for a black        
    market arms merchant. Schneider offers Laura a job entertaining the      
    dealer's customers, but while the money is good, she soon learns that    
    her new employers are significantly more sinister than she imagined.
