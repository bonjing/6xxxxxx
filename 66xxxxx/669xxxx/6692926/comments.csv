,namorax2,2011-09-22T07:54Z,why are you uploading your video library in alphabetical order? Isnt there enough spam on here already?
[T],drock232,2011-09-22T08:27Z,It's not spam chief these are good quality torrents that I've ripped from my dvd collection. I'm only sharing my collection instead of being a leecher like everyone else.
,asc11,2011-09-22T08:44Z,"@namorax2: I just examined drock232's torrents on TPB, and guess what, Wise Man (or at least Wise Anatomical Portion of a Man).  Over the last ten months, drock232 has shared ABOUT 600 MOVIES here. Almost EVERY ONE is STILL SEEDED! And most by several users. That's a good indication of how much people appreciate them.
Of course, this accomplishment pales before your brilliant record of ... oh, wait ... you HAVE no record!
You may now slink back into whatever crevice you ventured forth from."
