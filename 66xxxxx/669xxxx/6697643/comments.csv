I watched this the other day, from CBC: ""The Nature of Things: Masters of Space"" about the mostly US-led weaponization of orbital space. An orbital space battle would make lots of modern tech unusable for eons into the future. Worth a checkout. I noticed it's been up-ed to TPB:

Comment if you cannot get a fill, I missed the first few minutes, but have my own DVR copy."

I understand from a friend who works at Cabelas that Black Powder revolvers/rifles are selling fast for eh, Christmas presents.  Considering the 1847 Colt Walker .44 was the most powerfull sidearm into the 1930's and the cylinder of the Remington 1858 can be exchanged for another in less than 5 seconds with practice, akin to a modern revolver speed loader...  Maybe low tech is not such a bad thing to start looking into.  "
