As you've noticed this upload is not in the High resolution category !!!

It's a BRRip at a compatible definition for a normal TV!!! 

So, it has a resolution like a DVDRip non-up-scaled[720x296] only the source was an 1080p video file .mkv !"

Search my other uploads and you'll see that I've uploaded another BRRip [HD this time 720p] NOT contested !!!!

So it's you're choice not to download this one !!!

Sorry if the result did not pleased you !

Thanks anyway !!
