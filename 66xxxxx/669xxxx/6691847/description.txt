A fiercely independent 15-year-old girl falls under supernatural attack in this harrowing horror film from Spain. When Emma Hawkins begins to suffer from involuntary fits, her parents begin to fear that she has a serious medical problem. Though their concerns are initially eased following a series of rigorous physical and psychological tests, it soon becomes obvious that something horrible is stirring deep inside of Emma's soul. No doctor can help Emma now, and in order to purge the blackness within, her parents must turn to a healer with the power of God on their side.
