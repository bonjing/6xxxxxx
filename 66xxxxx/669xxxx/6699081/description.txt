From the Inside Flap
Although fear and greed have always driven the marketsâ€”â€” as well as good and bad investment decision-makingâ€”â€” behavioral finance as a discipline has only recently attracted serious attention from both financial professionals and investors. Given the run up in stock prices during the late 1990s, and the subsequent popping of the technology bubble, understanding investor behavior is now more important than ever.

As a wealth manager and practitioner at the forefront of the practical application of behavioral finance, Michael Pompian understands the behavioral biases that investors have. Through his experiences, he has discovered specific ways to adjust investment programs for these biases, and now he shares these findings in Behavioral Finance and Wealth Management.

Comprising four distinct parts, Behavioral Finance and Wealth Management is a comprehensive guide to both understanding irrational investor behavior and creating portfolios for individual investors that account for these behaviors.

Part One provides a straightforward introduction to the practical application of behavioral finance. These chapters include an overview of what behavioral finance is on an individual level, a history of behavioral finance, and an introduction to incorporating investor behavior into the asset allocation process.

Part Two contains a detailed review of some of the most commonly found biases, complete with general and technical descriptions, practical applications, research reviews, implications for investors, diagnostic tests, and advice on managing the effects of each bias.

Part Three takes the concepts presented in the first two parts and pulls them together in the form of case studies, which clearly demonstrate how practitioners and investors can use behavioral finance in real-world settings.

Part Four explores some special topics in the practical application of behavioral finance, with an eye toward the future of what might lie ahead for the next phase of this discipline.
