Screeching vocals, electrifying riffs, keys and driving beats are streaming from the cracks of a shed in the hills. Growing up on a diet of Led Zeppelin, Frank Zappa, and Hendrix, the sisters picked up their instruments in late 2006 and after a month started playing as a band. 

Stonefield, formerly known as Iotah have had the privilege to play alongside bands such as Children Collide, The Spazzys and Tex Perkins and have won various awards including a nomination for the 2008 youth awards, winning the group Music award for the Macedon Ranges Youth Awards 2010 , placing first in several Battle Of The Bands and were awarded Freeza Central â€œBand of The Monthâ€ last year.

Amy, the eldest is on drums and lead vocals. Hannahâ€™s on guitar, Sarah plays keys and backing vocals and Holly is the killer bass player/screamer.

In 2010 they won triple jâ€™s Unearthed High competition, which led to two songs â€˜Through The Cloverâ€™ and â€˜Foreign Loverâ€™ being played on high rotation on the jâ€™s. An invitation to play at One Movement in Perth saw the band play in front of thousands of industry folk and fans and has led to a spot on the 2011 Glastonbury and The Great Escape line ups.

Stonefieldâ€™s debut release â€˜Through The Cloverâ€™ is a five track EP featuring the breakthrough song â€˜Through The Cloverâ€™ and follow up single â€˜Foreign Loverâ€™.

To round off 2010 the band brought in the New Year with The Temper Trap, NERD, Gyroscope and more at the Pyramid Rock Festival.
