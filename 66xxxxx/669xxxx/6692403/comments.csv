The next book you download should very well be the DSM  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4882984/DSM-IV-TR"
,UnviolentPeacemaker,2011-09-22T03:02Z,"Oh, dead, you again. Goodness, you must have a pretty profoundly meaningless existence where the best you can do is to try and build your pitiful self up by criticizing the work of others.  Dead Pond Scum.  Smith too, like you, was dead."
,dead97gsx,2011-09-23T01:43Z,"

I did not criticize anyone's work...I did on the other hand imply that you were a nit-wit.
Reality requires something of you but it's not too hard, I promise."

dead97gsx is as his name implies dead from the pineal gland outwards. Unfortunately for him he is a figment of his own imagination. an imagination so troubling that his struggling soul cons his ego into looking in the right direction. His ego has long since had its own existence seperate of his being and indeed the world at large, he (the ego) doubtless feeds off porn and the less protective or innocent's energy. The eensy teensy wheensy little squeak that was once his conscience is naturally in cahoots with his poor downtrodden soul. Hence he (not ego) secretly yearns for truth and your posts are their goal. Anarchy&Peace brothers and you too poster! "
