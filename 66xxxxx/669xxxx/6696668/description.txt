Mechanic Bruce Van Natta is just seconds from heading home when the 12,000-pound logging truck heâ€™s working under crashes down on top of him. With massive internal injuries, he can feel his life slipping away until two identical angels appear above him, setting off an unbelievable series of events. Then, 8-year-old Emaleigh Shelt and her family scramble for cover in a hallway as a furious F4 tornado bears down on their house. But as the massive twister lifts the building off its foundation, Emaleigh sees a glowing figure covering them with giant wings shielding them from harm. Plus, after a full day of searching for Taliban fighters in Afghanistan, Army Spc. Ethan Anderson and his squad bunker down for the night. As he sleeps, Ethan has a vivid dream of his late grandfather, who tells him he must wake up right now â€” just seconds before enemy fighters open fire on his camp.
