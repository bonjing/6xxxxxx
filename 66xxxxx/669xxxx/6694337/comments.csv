,hahalolfailmupp,2011-09-23T12:32Z,Press F2 Until it changes that is. 
,zzz112,2011-09-23T15:58Z,i have a problem. when the update is 100% it starts again from the beginning and keeps doing that
,orion1394,2011-09-24T13:29Z,.sfv file? can someone help with how on earth i can get these to open? it says unrar but i don't see a single file here that winrar can use
,orion1394,2011-09-24T13:31Z,ok nvm all i had to do is open the top file with winrar... sorry
,888orion,2011-09-24T17:10Z,"@hahalolfailmupp - where's the crack content that you say to use for this step:

5. Copy the crack content to the install directory.

?

I've followed the install notes, including waiting til the gears show in the keytro to press F2, but when I click on guest, I still receive this message:  

""Starcraft II: Starter Edition cannot play in offline mode.""

help?"
,the_fuzz128,2011-09-30T12:06Z,"Okay, wait. Which file do you unrar? All i have is "".001, .002, .003"" ect. type files. And a system information file called ""rzr-s214"" and one called ""rzr-s214.sfv"" What do i unrar?"
,the_fuzz128,2011-09-30T15:55Z,"Nevermind, it was the "".001"" file for everyone else thats wondering. And Rarzilla doesn't work for it, gotta use WinRar. And is this still gonna work since they came out with 1.4.1 yesterday?"
,supercoke1,2011-10-08T06:47Z,"Nothing happens in the keytro when i press f2, it just changes the text on the gear wheel thing from razor1911 to skid row sucks lol

Also, does this even work now that its 1.41?"
,NHProwess,2011-10-11T17:24Z,everything worked except it crashed when i ran keytro.exe
,SarethW,2011-10-23T00:09Z,"so far it seems to be working just fine, thanks a lot for the uploader, people that comment on how to use the crack, and Razor1911!!
thanks so much :)! "
,texasfan898,2011-10-26T18:25Z,"I followed the instructions but when i click guest it tells me that i need an authorized language pack from blizzard, what do i do?"
,SarethW,2011-11-02T14:49Z,"Actually I don't think this works anymore with 1.4.1
I heard people still got it right with mixing it up with Reloaded cracks but I'm not sure :(
Plz upload a 1.4.1 crack soon!"
,Brule,2011-11-11T14:32Z,"i download this crack and the game worked great, thanks, but there is a way to make the crack work on the pt-br version of the game?"
,AcidOverdose,2012-02-05T07:20Z,"I followed the directions and once I got ingame I hit Guest, and says I have to have a saved character and battlenet account. I do have a battlenet account, but when I sign in it says begin starter edition. This doesn't work"
,Serravax,2012-02-19T16:58Z,"Nice, and it's working with the 1.4.2 patch!

Thanks"
,dank9104,2012-03-26T00:46Z,"How to Install Properly:

1: Unplug/Disable Internet Connection

2: Install SC2 (DO NOT INSTALL/RUN SC2_COPY OR KEYTRO UNTIL STEP 5!) 

3: Extract Starcraft II Wings Of Liberty v1.4.0 Update-RazorDOX into your game directory eg: C:Program Files (x86)StarCraft II

4: Run sc2-1.4.0-enGB (THIS MAY TAKE A WHILE DO NOT CLOSE UNTIL ITS FINISHED)

5: Run SC2_Copy

6: Run Keytro and wait until you see the gear with Razor1911 "
,dank9104,2012-03-26T00:47Z,"7: Now do not run Starcraft II.exe instead go to Support folder and run SC2Switcher.exe

8: Play as guest"
,Shahoul,2012-04-16T20:06Z,this actually screwes me b/c i can no longer use SC2Allin1 to play skirmish
,Flagellum82_Dei,2012-05-03T06:44Z,"""SC2:Starter Edition cannot play in offline mode"" , i did exactly step by step install. I was offline during installing. F2 key works proper (text on wheel changed when i hit F2) Any ideas why cannot i launch the game ?"
,IlanF,2012-05-18T13:35Z,"Awesome! it works on 1.4.3 too!
Just remember, in win7 run as admin"
,keithasdf,2012-05-29T05:30Z,an interesting keytro indeed
,keithasdf,2012-05-29T05:41Z,so playing as guest is the only option??
,amoeba,2012-06-04T08:52Z,"I'm confused. I followed the instructions in the description, and it tells me that Starter Edition cannot run in offline mode. So I uninstall and reinstall, following dank9104's directions, and it still doesn't work. Am I missing something?"
