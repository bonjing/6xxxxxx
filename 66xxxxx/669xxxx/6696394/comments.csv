,broken_bazooka,2011-09-24T17:44Z,"Eh? with over 100 games tested, I can safely say that almost all games work with no patch.
You are clearly doing something wrong."

,xzero001,2011-09-26T19:57Z,"Funciona Perfecto Rebug 3.55 no hay necesidad de usar los .elf's ni ningun otro archivo. Solo funciona en INTERNO.

Shadow of the Colossus es una leyenda viviente en el mundo de los videojuegos.. ahora no hay excusa para no jugarlo.. se ve mejor que nunca.. solo aproximate con una mentalidad abierta y recuerda que a veces el precio que decides pagar es demasiado caro."
,RKangeL,2011-09-26T22:22Z,"Hey Guys, Anybody know why 2 files??? Are they the same isn´t it???

,agent17,2011-10-04T04:24Z,@Thaiger39 - I have the same problem saying it damaged. using Winrar on Windows xp. anyone?
,Shmion9000,2011-10-09T11:29Z,"It's not very clear - what you have to do is: (using 7-zip) select the two .rar files, right click them and extract with 7-zip. You have to extract both into the same folder at the same time. If you try copying the two separate extracted folders into each other, Windows'll ask you if you want to overwrite the files."
,vgvgvg7412,2011-10-11T20:46Z,"This is simply amazing!

,sharanx18,2011-10-24T01:12Z,@binoysupper: i have the same problem! ico works but sotc doesn't!! what to do!!!
,mextus,2011-11-14T00:03Z,"@bino, char: I had the same problem because I transferred the files via USB and I had used the wrong splitter on the shadow of Colossus files. That file is 6 GB but only used by Colossus so Ico works. My solution was to use the splitter made by the guy who made Multiman and selecting the 666-option for splitting. Your mileage may vary. Another option is to move the file to your PS3 via FTP. Much smoother, especially if you have a small hard drive on the PS3 and need to do this often. When i splitted the files with the wrong option Ico worked but not Colossus. Now both work and SoTc is awesome!"
