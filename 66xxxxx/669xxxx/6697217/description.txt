Tashi, Arun and Nitin - flat mates, buddies    
and partners in crime. Tashi is to get         
married in a month but still doesn't know      
if his fiancee is THE ONE! Arun can't make     
up his mind who he wants to kill first -       
his girlfriend (who has just dumped him) or    
his stupid, annoying boss (whose idea of       
creativity is sketching a smiling banana).     
And Nitin is about to discover that eating     
delicious Tandoori Chicken off a street        
vendor is going to give him the worst case     
of Delhi Belly he's ever known! Three regular  
blokes, living the regular life except for     
one small detail - they are on the hit list    
of one of the world's deadliest crime          
syndicates. Will they be able to get away      
before the shit hits the roof and it comes     
crashing down? Delhi Belly is the meanest      
comedy you're ever likely to see.
