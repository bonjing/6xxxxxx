,kenbeavers,2011-09-23T16:42Z,I will be seeding as much as I can! Everyone please seed. Nobody likes leechers!
,kenbeavers,2011-09-26T16:40Z,"More of you need to seed. I've been the only one seeding, and I have so far uploaded over 18 gigs, but the DL speed will be faster if more people seed."
,Niosis,2011-09-29T16:09Z,"Hey kenny,

It looks like you need some help. I'll try to seed as much as possible when I finally get the file downloaded. Right now it's stuck at 82.3% so there's not much I can do. I imagine there are quite a number of people in my same situation."
,boomkidd,2011-09-30T11:13Z,"DUDE, SEEEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ALSO stuck at 80 something percent...The fuk man...took 5 days to get there!!!
C'MoN!"
,Niosis,2011-10-02T04:41Z,"My advice to all people thinking about downloading this...

STAY AWAY.

I'm not trying to diss on ken beavers but he's complaining about how people need to seed when in fact no one's been able to finish the file.

At time of posting, there is ZERO (0) seeds on this file. 

Again, not hating on kenny, but it's his responsibility to seed the file at all times - and he has failed. Especially since it's NIGHT TIME right now - when most people are downloading and it's easy to seed by leaving your computer on as you go to sleep.

Sorry kenny. I deleted all data and .tor files associated with this torrent. It's going to be quicker for me just to find a season 1-7 torrent and dl 8 individually."
,Niosis,2011-10-02T04:44Z,"Hate to double post but there's no edit feature....

Also, it would appear as if kenny has also posted this file on other torrent sites.

DO NOT BE FOOLED.

It may say 30 something leechers in the description but in reality there is 150+ people leeching... with ZERO seeds."
