,Tleilaxu_Ghola,2011-09-24T15:08Z,"Quit bitching about download speed. 

When you have 3 times as many seeders as leechers, as is common when a new, more anticipated release comes out, you are going to have fewer connected peers and lower speeds than you normally would. 

Please learn a little bit about how peer file sharing works before you post these stupid, whiney complaints about the download being slow."

Also worth noting that if someone decides not to download a sample vid or an .srt (or any other file included), they register as a leecher - regardless of the fact that they might have seeded 20 gigs of the movie itself. S/L ratio doesn't really tell the story.

Enjoyed the Movie, made it a little to much comedic for my liking, but hey cant complain for a decent flick! Good Download speed, took about 5 minutes. 

@American haters, thanks, you just make our efforts to ride you from the world that much more enjoyable! "

@71460 

Like my knowledgable friend here says, democracy originated in Greece.

For more information visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy

Or LRN2 GOOGLE"
,grrrr716,2011-10-18T07:38Z,"@Barosanescu

What an absolutely idiotic statement. The word ""democracy"" comes for the Ancient Greek ""Demokratia"", and has been in use as a word and a concept for 2400 years. America neither invented it nor is the best country in the world at implementing it by any stretch of the imagination"
,GIANNIS17,2011-10-18T19:54Z,"@chubbytrans

Although I can't read repopomans' comment I firmly believe that your attitude towards Greek citizens is totally unfair and If I may fascist. Your country (I guess Finland based on your uploads) may LEND an ammount of money in Greece but that doesn't mean it owns anything Greek. Greek citizens consequently me have dignity and you have to respect it.


As for the people talking shit about America, I think they should first think that the wear American clothes, watch American movies and play American games. So this whole anti-American bullshit is totally bullshit. Think before you write and act.

As for the movie I can't say I am too excited, but I had a good time. Thanks extremezone, as well as all the seeders."
,D-Had,2011-10-19T05:42Z,"Thank you very much for the UL man, will seed.

Oh, and what is with all the arguing about America?  Every country has its faults, democracy indeed was most famously implemented in ancient Greece, and to go on and on about how much you either love or hate a country on a torrent page seems a bit out of place."

Poor choice of actor though, and far too much sarcasm."
