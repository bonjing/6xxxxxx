How to install the Windows
Developer Preview from an ISO
imageThe Windows Developer
Preview is delivered as an .iso
image that must be converted
into installation media stored on
a DVD or a USB flash drive. On
Windows 7, the easiest way to
convert this file is to use
Windows Disc Image Burner. On
Windows XP and Windows Vista,
a third-party program is required
to convert an .iso file into
installable mediaâ€”and DVD
burning software often includes
this capability.
