,Mariner1500,2011-09-21T11:01Z,Can I install this on a seperate partition and then choose which OS (existing or this one) to load during start-up?
[T],L3G3ND,2011-09-21T11:13Z,"yes, you can but i will never do that. Since after win 7 the microsoft supports only single os. And its win 8 and unstable beta. It will bang your hardware."
,morrig,2011-09-21T11:17Z," Yes you can, after install on booting get option to boot to either system.Type in search msconfig,click on system configuration,on boot set which system to default to and timeout,I have mine at a few secounds."

 Wrong I am running both Win7 and 8 for nearly a week with np problems,just missing the start menu,but loving every thing else."

i hadnt made win 7 or 8 the the developers does not support using 2 os after 7.

First go to task manager and check your normal cpu usage."
,morrig,2011-09-21T13:12Z," All I'am saying is it's a beta and there is always problems with such,and the only problem I have found is with Firefox,which when using cool preview it seems to open up multiple plug in containers causing  power used to nearly double and cpu to 75% and freeze firefox.
 As win 7 still there can always go back to it's use as main system,check out-

,Mariner1500,2011-09-21T14:27Z,"@PrimE-Rulz: With respect, I am dual booting Windows 7 and XP now. Perhaps I've misunderstood when you say MS only supports single OS with Win 7 installed."
,Baboe2000,2011-09-21T15:24Z,"Mariner1500.
I had dual boot. Win 7 And 8 but during installing win 8 will change ur MBR. So if you use a bootloader for win 7, it's not working anymore.
After installing a bootloader for win 7, win 8 was not working anymore.
Or is there a new bootloader??"
,Baboe2000,2011-09-21T15:35Z,"@mariner1500: Dualboot works fine but if u use a bootloader for win 7, win 8 will unable that (it changes ur MBR) 
Installing a bootloader again for win 7 will change ur MBR again and Win 8 will not be able too start up. Thats what happend on my comp."
,Mariner1500,2011-09-21T16:00Z,"@Baboe2000: I am unaware of any dual bootloader compatible with Windows 7 and 8, however my search continues. Meanwhile, what do you make of the info in Step Three of the lifehacker link above (graciously provided by morrig)?"
,Baboe2000,2011-09-21T16:01Z,sorry for double post
,Baboe2000,2011-09-21T19:47Z,"@mariner1500: This is actually the dualbootscreen of win 8. Here u can choose which system u want to start. Also u can choose ur default system startup. I used the msconfig of win 7 to set my default startup.
At this moment it's working all. Did a repair of win8. "

[T],L3G3ND,2011-09-25T19:12Z,"hey., beta's doesnt need a crack. It is for promotional purpose of win 8 officially avilable on their web."
