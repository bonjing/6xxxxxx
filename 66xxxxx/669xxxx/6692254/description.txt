This is Ladytron's complete set at Bonnaroo in 2008

Sorry the tracks are only numbered, not named.
It was a great day, I was working at the festival and got to see this set. I like some of their tracks live alot better than the studio.

I will upload more live stuff if people want it. I have alot of bonnaroo live and talking heads live.


enjoy and keep seeding
