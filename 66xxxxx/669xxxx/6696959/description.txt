  The search for Britain's best amateur baker continues with Mel        
  Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. Ten bakers remain and this week their       
  bread making skills are put to the test. Paul Hollywood and Mary      
  Berry keep a close eye on the bakers who face three increasingly      
  complicated challenges over two days and have to work with yeast for  
  the first time. The contestants start with the signature bake, a      
  free-form flavoured loaf that produces a variety of interesting       
  results, including a combination of chocolate and onion. Next is the  
  technical challenge - focaccia - that really separates the wheat      
  from the chaff. Finally, a mammoth six-hour hour challenge requires   
  the bakers to create a display bread basket that is filled with 24    
  bread rolls.
