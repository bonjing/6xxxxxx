,Up_Load,2011-10-11T09:11Z,Does not seem to be a true retail DVD copy. The uploader just seemed to have converted from an .avi file using a tool such convertX. The chapters do not show up because of this. Fact is the uploader has done a number of times. Quality is definately substandard. I shall not be downloading from this uploader anymore.
