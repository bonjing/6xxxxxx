                                     Proper Reason

               of sync throughout by 200ms

                                     Side Note

               TLA failed to provide source proof for a couple of their
               releases. This is odd as their releases seem to be of much
               worse quality than those of even IMMERSE. This can be seen
               here http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/82313. Also,
               a lot of the CA rips have a solid green line along the bottom
               of their caps. This would sugest that it may not be directly
               capped and should be labled as AHDTV to represent this.
