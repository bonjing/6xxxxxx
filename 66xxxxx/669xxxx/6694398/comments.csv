,SteFFgame,2011-09-22T19:21Z,Really the best game i ever played
,d0XX0b,2011-09-22T20:09Z,"Oh I forgot to mention that you *may* need to run the game as administrator on Windows Vista/7. I have Win XP x64 and I didn't need to do that, so that's why I forgot to mention it. I'm not sure it's required though."
,alnawaris,2011-09-22T20:11Z,yes the best one indeed
,dumas1000,2011-09-22T21:09Z,"I should trying running the ps2 version off an emulator, because the PC really had no legitimate, functional gamepad support. It is a good game, but I cannot come anywhere close to playing it effectively with a mouse and a keyboard. They are people who can, obviously, but I'm certainly not the only gamepad only player out there."
,dumas1000,2011-09-22T21:11Z,"I meant to say that the PC version of Indigo Prophecy has no effective gamepad support. Not even Pinnacle Profiler, unless you know how to create a pin yourself. "
,SteXDudE,2011-09-22T21:13Z,just one question: is it patched ?
,d0XX0b,2011-09-22T22:08Z,"Yes, 1.1 patch is included.

Probably should have mentioned that, huh. Sorry."
,d0XX0b,2011-09-22T22:10Z,"Bah, I would add that to the description but torrent editing is ""temporarily"" disabled. Temporarily my ass, it's been disabled for... I have no idea how long now."

,d0XX0b,2011-09-24T18:07Z,"No problem.

Because I had two .iso images (RELOADED's original and the one I modified), while I was the only seeder I was afraid that I may have accidentally packed the wrong one and added it to the torrent. I'm glad I didn't. :D"
