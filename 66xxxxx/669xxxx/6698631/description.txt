  Miriam Cooke meanders through the mystic majesty of mid Wales.        
  Miriam's journey begins at Pistyll Rheadr, the UK's tallest single    
  drop waterfall at 240ft (80m). She walks a section of "the mountain   
  connoisseur's" route, the Cambrian Way, in the company of rambler     
  George Tod. With the help of natural navigator Tristan Gooley,        
  Miriam learns to find her way in the wild by looking at trees and     
  meets a fearsome raptor that has transformed its image from           
  persecuted pest to lucrative tourist attraction. Journey's end finds  
  Miriam at Tregaron, where she takes the reigns for a go at harness    
  racing.
