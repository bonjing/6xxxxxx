,THOR4,2011-09-24T07:20Z,Hey man how do i uninstall/remove this?
,Daeshan,2011-09-24T10:05Z,"@THOR4
it comes with a start menu folder which you can uninstall from there, if not go through change or remove programs.

@AzDeRi
I see you have a few servers built in onto this game, can i get whitelisted?"

,qiip99,2011-09-24T15:31Z,omg.. server donÂ´t start...
,harisg0,2011-09-24T15:52Z,How we seed ??
,slitherdmd,2011-09-24T16:32Z,Can you please put me on the white list to the servers? Nickname: Vintoxic
,wakow,2011-09-24T17:17Z,any way to install separately from 1.8? So I could older version if I ever wanted? Thanks!
,AzDeRi,2011-09-25T02:07Z,"@wakow
press windows key + r
type in %appdata% and hit enter
rename .minecraft folder to .minecraftbackup or whatever
just make it back to .minecraft to play 1.8"
,AzDeRi,2011-09-25T02:09Z,"And sorry everyone who asked for getting whitelisted. I cannot whitelist any more ppl because server is already overloaded with current people. But still if you need help with setting up your own server, please feel free to contact me with an email message.

,AzDeRi,2011-09-26T16:40Z,"Installer doesn't work with Windows XP 32-bit. Windows XP users must copy the "".minecraft"" folder to application data folder, which can be found by pressin Windows key + r and typing in %appdata%"
,AzDeRi,2011-09-26T16:43Z,"@qiip99

You must have java installed and classpath configured correctly. You can check it out by typing ""java"" in command prompt and hitting enter. If it says ""is not recognized as an command"" reinstall newest JRE.

After this running another of .bat files inside server folder should do the trick."
,godziothc,2011-09-27T18:54Z,"Heya, were having issues with the server. I create my own (quad core/4gb ram/30mbit connection) and my friends get the connection lost error. The server reports a disconnect.overflow error for my friends though I can play there with no problems. I was reading about it and it looks like a game issue but you guys appear to run it fine so what is your secret :) We play through tunngle and i'm using the 2gb server batch file."
,AzDeRi,2011-09-27T19:17Z,"@godziothc
I have another computer running minecraft server. Computer has only 512mb RAM and 3GHz 1-core processor. So, the computer is obviously not the reason for this. I am pretty sure the reason is your tunngle. You can simply open your router ports, make server ""offline"" from server properties file and tell your friends your ip-address. Should work without any problems."
,godziothc,2011-09-27T19:50Z,"@AdZeRi
Damn man that was fast :) Good to see TPB community alive and well. He updated java and i do have online mode=false. They can join up no problem, its just the time they can stay connected"
,godziothc,2011-09-27T23:03Z,"Yea you sure were right, we're using my direct ip address not the tunngle/hamachi one and everything works like a charm...again thanks for this easy to install and compatible release "
,the88shrimp,2011-09-28T07:00Z,works perfectly i havent tried the server yet but the rest works fine
,AzDeRi,2011-09-30T00:58Z,"NEW VERSION OUT! GO GO GO!

,ArKL1Te,2011-10-02T06:02Z,"""Just run install.bat and launch game from desktop!""

The icon didn't appear on desktop :/"
,AzDeRi,2011-10-04T21:32Z,"@ArKL1Te

As told before, installer wont work with windows xp. But go download new version. This installer should work just perfectly."
,DazBones,2011-10-06T04:54Z,Hey can i get white listed per chance?
,AzDeRi,2011-10-07T01:40Z,"@DazBones
