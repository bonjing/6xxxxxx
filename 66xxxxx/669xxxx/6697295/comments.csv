Naming a torrent posting ""VIDEO_TS"" is an extremely poor choice of title.
""VIDEO_TS"" is the name of the standard folder on every video DVD.
In the future, I would suggest that you name your torrent postings according to the actual subject matter of the torrent, since most people who use this web site are not mind readers."
