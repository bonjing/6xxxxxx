This is a made-for-TV docudrama about the famous 1938 War of the Worlds radio broadcast by Orson Welles and the Mercury Theater. It cuts back and forth in real time between the people putting on the radio play, showing all the interesting activities behind the scenes, and various groups of panicked listeners who thought the invasion from Mars was really happening. (The picture quality is soft, but watchable.)
