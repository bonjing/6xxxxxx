La terra trema: Episodio del mare
The Earth Trembles

1948

Luchino Visconti

La terra trema recounts the struggle of a fishing family to escape from poverty and exploitation. In 1947, Visconti went to Sicily, with a small amount of capital advanced by the Communist Party, to make what was initially to have been a short documentary. He stayed there for six months, and the project gradually expanded in scale until what was proposed became a mammoth epic on the conditions of the poor workers and peasants and their struggle to liberate themselves from oppression.

I wanted to provide a smaller file, since the other ~800mb file is crap. Excellent quality. Soft-subbed English. Thanks for seeding.
