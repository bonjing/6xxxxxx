The word PO, as used in Po Music, comes from Dr. Edward de Bonoâ€™s concept of
Lateral Thinking. Derived from words like possible, positive, poetry and
hypothesis, Po is a language indicator to show that the process of provocation
is being used to move from a fixed set of ideas in an attempt to discover new
ones. Po Music represents ideas as provocation rather than as an accurate
description of what things are: a positive, possible, poetic hypothesis.

Fans of Joe McPhee were no doubt surprised to hear a tight reading of Sonny
Rollins' "Oleo" burst forth on the opening track and perhaps surprised yet again
when, after stating the theme, Raymond Boni's wah-wah guitar suddenly sprawled
over the proceedings. But McPhee was ever the adventurer and Oleo was a
statement of sorts, signaling his reluctance to be pigeonholed into one area of
the avant-garde. "Oleo" is followed with a suite dedicated to three Pablos --
Picasso, Casals, and Neruda -- and features bassist Francois Mechali in
Spanish-tinged mode, providing a lovely arco lead-in for the ensemble. The
entire piece is a thing of restrained beauty. Much of the remainder of the album
also features McPhee coming face to face with "the tradition," either
explicitly, as in his cover of Benny Golson's "I Remember Clifford," or in the
relatively straightforward thematic material of his own pieces. There's even the
occasional injection of a trace of funk! Special mention should be made of reed
player Andrew Jaume, a longtime associate of McPhee's, who is outstanding here,
especially on tracks like the gorgeous "Astral Spirits," a deep, touching paean
to the Ayler brothers. Oleo was released on disc along with a solo recording of
McPhee's under the title of Oleo & A Future Retrospective
